5|$|Schumacher {{was born}} in Hürth, North Rhine-Westphalia, to Rolf Schumacher, a bricklayer, and his wife Elisabeth. When Schumacher was four, his father {{modified}} his pedal kart by adding <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>motorcycle</b> engine. When Schumacher crashed it into a lamp post in Kerpen, his parents {{took him to the}} karting track at Kerpen-Horrem, where he became the youngest member of the karting club. His father soon built him a kart from discarded parts and at the age of six Schumacher won his first club championship. To support his son's racing, Rolf Schumacher took on a second job renting and repairing karts, while his wife worked at the track's canteen. Nevertheless, when Michael needed a new engine costing 800 DM, his parents were unable to afford it; he was able to continue racing with support from local businessmen.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, {{purpose-built}} motobikes like the Derny and VéloSoleX, with stronger frames and sometimes with only token {{ability to be}} wholly human-powered were introduced in France. Many years later, manufacturers would re-introduce this concept as the moped, <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>motorcycle</b> fitted with pedals {{that can be used}} as a starting aid but which cannot, practically, be ridden under pedal power alone.|$|E
25|$|Assisted by Luciano Zen, {{and after}} hours of running the normal {{agricultural}} business, Francesco had started in 1947 to design <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>motorcycle.</b> Word has it, that some engine parts were cast in Francesco's kitchen, confirming that at least initially, the project was not regarded as a serious business proposition. What most likely started as an evening pastime garage project of two technical enthusiasts was {{to become one of}} the most successful motorcycles in history. A simple four stroke 75 cc bike with girder forks and a fully enclosed drive chain.|$|E

50|$|The 916 was <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>motorcycle</b> {{than the}} 888, with a chrome-moly trellis frame which was {{shared with the}} Ducati 748 in 1995 and beyond. This was {{combined}} with striking new bodywork that featured aggressive lines. In contrast to Japanese inline four-cylinder competitors of the time, its V-twin engine produced less outright power, but a more even torque spread. The 916 model {{was replaced by the}} 996 model in 1999.|$|R
500|$|Fujisawa and Honda visited Kreidler and Lambretta showrooms, {{as well as}} others, {{researching the}} kind of {{motorcycle}} Fujisawa had in mind. [...] Fujisawa said these designs had [...] "no future" [...] and would not sell well. His concept was a two wheeler for everyman, one that would appeal to both developed and developing countries, urban and rural. The new motorcycle needed to be technologically simple to survive in places without up-to-date know-how and access to advanced tools or reliable spare parts supplies. The common consumer complaints of noise, poor reliability, especially in the electrics, and general difficulty of use {{would have to be}} addressed. Because Honda was a large company growing larger, it needed a mass-appeal product that could be produced on an enormous scale. The design had to be sorted out before production began, because it would be too costly to fix problems in the vast numbers that were to be manufactured. The scooter type nearly fitted the bill, but was too complex for developing countries to maintain, and the small wheels did poorly on badly maintained or nonexistent roads. Another of Fujisawa's requirements was that it could be ridden with one hand while carrying a tray of soba noodles, saying to Honda, [...] "If you can design <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>motorcycle,</b> say 50cc with a cover to hide the engine and hoses and wires inside, I can sell it. I don't know how many soba noodle shops there are in Japan, but I bet you that every shop will want one for deliveries." ...|$|E

The [...] "People's Car" [...] would be available to citizens of the Third Reich through a savings plan at 990 Reichsmark ($396 in 1930s U.S. dollars)—about the price of <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>motorcycle</b> (the average income being around 32 RM a week).|$|E
50|$|In 1974, Auranthic Corp., a small {{manufacturer}} in California, produced <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>motorcycle</b> called the Charger. It had a 30 mph and a 50 mi range {{on a full}} charge.|$|E
5000|$|The {{speedway}} {{originally had}} a dolomite and clay mix surface, but was paved {{during the early}} to mid-1980s before the asphalt was dug up and the original surface was restored. During the time the track was asphalt <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>motorcycle</b> track {{was placed on the}} infield, the track running just inside asphalt track, but when the asphalt was dug up the bikes once again raced on the 400 m [...] "D" [...] shaped main track.|$|R

50|$|A moped (/ˈmoʊpɛd/ MOH-ped) is <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>motorcycle,</b> {{generally}} {{having a}} less stringent licensing requirement than motorcycles or automobiles because mopeds typically travel {{about the same}} speed as bicycles on public roadways. Strictly speaking, mopeds are driven by both an engine and by bicycle pedals, but in common usage and in many jurisdictions the term moped is used for similar vehicles including a scooter, though this is quite erroneous.|$|E
50|$|Croix-en-Ternois has <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>motorcycle</b> {{race track}} named Circuit de Croix-en-Ternois. The circuit is just over 1 mi long {{and is known}} for its long main {{straight}} and twisty in-field section. The circuit is used very regularly for various car and bike race meetings, and is also frequently open for track days. The circuit is also used by the British Motorcycle Racing Club (BEMSEE) as a round of their annual race calendar.|$|E
50|$|The Cardellino was <b>a</b> <b>small</b> single-cylinder, {{two-stroke}} <b>motorcycle</b> {{produced by}} Moto Guzzi from 1954 until 1962.|$|R
50|$|The Suitcase Cycle was <b>a</b> <b>small</b> step-through <b>motorcycle</b> modification, {{designed}} by Lawrence Shapiro, for quick breakdown and compact transport via general aviation (GA) aircraft, {{as well as}} land and sea transport. Most commonly, Honda CT90 trail bikes were converted, although several other motorbikes models were as well.|$|R
50|$|The Honda SL70 Motosport, {{which was}} {{introduced}} in 1970, is <b>a</b> <b>small</b> street/trail <b>motorcycle</b> with <b>a</b> four-stroke engine, a four-speed manual gearbox, and a full-cradle frame. The bike was extremely popular with younger riders who used it off-road as a trail bike and mini motocrosser. For the latter role, it was essentially replaced by Honda's XR75 in 1973.|$|R
50|$|In the beginning, Hernán helps {{his brother}} and his wife {{get ready for a}} their big move to Spain.

He works at an agency delivering messages on <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>motorcycle.</b> One day, at a gas station, he meets Pato, an attractive woman working the pumps. Hernán invites Pato to rent the room his brother vacated.|$|E
50|$|In case of {{the power}} {{assistance}} stopping at a speed up to 25 km/h, the riders {{are not required to}} carry motorcycle helmets, however, this speed limit shall not be exceeded even while pedaling only.Electric bicycles, for example Specialized Turbo, without 25 km/h speed limitation for power assistance are considered <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>motorcycle</b> and besides license plate (yellow with black letters), driving license and insurance, a motorocycle helmet must be worn at all time from the start of 2017 and onwards.|$|E
50|$|An underbone {{motorcycle}} is <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>motorcycle</b> {{built around}} a single tube frame called the underbone. This ‘underbone’ supports the whole vehicle and runs low all across {{the length of the}} motorcycle. There is a similarity in appearance to the scooter, largely due to the fuel tank position, the open-frame design which the fuel tank position allows and the splash guards. However, the entire power train, namely the engine position, power transmission and wheels are based on the design of conventional motorcycles.|$|E
50|$|The name derny is now {{applied to}} all such vehicles, {{regardless}} of manufacturer. It {{is used by the}} Larousse dictionary as a generic term for <b>a</b> <b>small</b> pacing <b>motorcycle</b> used in cycle races. The machine has to be bump-started. It can then pace riders up to 90 km/h, although races rarely exceed 80 km/h. Riders behind Derny-pacers ride conventional track bicycles.|$|R
50|$|The Harley-Davidson Baja 100 was <b>a</b> <b>small</b> {{displacement}} off-road <b>motorcycle</b> {{made for}} Harley-Davidson in Italy by Aermacchi, which was 50% owned by Harley-Davidson at the time.

5000|$|The Honda CL70 Scrambler was <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>motorcycle</b> with a [...] {{four-stroke}} engine, a {{pressed steel}} frame and a four-speed manual gearbox. It {{was built by}} Honda between 1969 and 1973. It essentially replaced the Honda CL90. It was very similar to a CL50 with a larger engine. As a scrambler, it had a high-mount exhaust and a high rear fender. This allowed the look, though not really the capability, of extended off-road capability, before real dual-sport motorcycles were available.|$|E
50|$|Peppermint Patty {{arrives on}} <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>motorcycle</b> and alerts the kids about an {{upcoming}} motocross race, {{and suggests that}} Charlie Brown and Snoopy enter. Linus volunteers to be the pit crew and the two pool their limited financial resources to purchase a shabby old bike.

50|$|However, any pedelec {{where the}} power {{assistance}} is triggered by merely turning wheels rather than pedal motion (a {{large number of}} cheap versions or notoriously front hub assistance), are required to have a licence plate for <b>a</b> scooter / <b>small</b> <b>motorcycle</b> (so called snorfiets or bromfiets), a valid driving licence and an insurance.|$|R
50|$|The Honda DN-01 {{is one of}} <b>a</b> <b>small</b> {{number of}} <b>{{motorcycle}}s</b> offered by a major motorcycle manufacturer with an automatic transmission, the others being the Honda VFR1200F, NC700SD/NC750SD, and NM4; Yamaha FJR1300AE; and the Aprilia Mana 850.|$|R
2500|$|As part of war reparations, Harley-Davidson {{acquired}} {{the design of}} <b>a</b> <b>small</b> German <b>motorcycle,</b> the DKW RT 125, which they adapted, manufactured, and sold from 1948 to 1966. Various models were made, including the Hummer from 1955 to 1959, but they are all colloquially referred to as [...] "Hummers" [...] at present.
