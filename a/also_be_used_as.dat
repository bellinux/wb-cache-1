5|$|Dammar oil, {{from the}} Canarium strictum, used in paint as an oil drying agent. Can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> a lamp oil.|$|E
5|$|Ytterbium can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> a dopant to {{help improve}} the grain refinement, strength, and other {{mechanical}} properties of stainless steel. Some ytterbium alloys have rarely been used in dentistry.|$|E
5|$|Another type of {{approach}} is tissue engineering, using biomaterials to help scaffold and rebuild damaged tissues. Biomaterials being investigated include natural substances such as collagen or agarose and synthetic ones like polymers and nitrocellulose. They fall into two categories: hydrogels and nanofibers. These materials can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> a vehicle for delivering gene therapy to tissues.|$|E

5|$|HST's {{guidance}} system can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> a scientific instrument. Its three Fine Guidance Sensors (FGS) are primarily {{used to keep}} the telescope accurately pointed during an observation, but {{can also be used}} to carry out extremely accurate astrometry; measurements accurate to within 0.0003arcseconds have been achieved.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the Federative Committee on Anatomical Terminology {{accepted}} female prostate as {{an accurate}} {{term for the}} Skene's gland, which {{is believed to be}} found in the G-spot area along the walls of the urethra. The male prostate is biologically homologous to the Skene's gland; it has been unofficially called the male G-spot because it can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> an erogenous zone.|$|E
5|$|Pathogenic {{micro-organisms}} include bacteria, fungi, and viruses. They kill or debilitate {{their host}} and are relatively host-specific. Various microbial insect diseases occur naturally, but may <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> biological pesticides. When naturally occurring, these outbreaks are density-dependent {{in that they}} generally only occur as insect populations become denser.|$|E

5|$|Spiders can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> food. Cooked {{tarantula}} spiders {{are considered}} a delicacy in Cambodia, and by the Piaroa Indians of southern Venezuela– provided the highly irritant hairs, the spiders' main defense system, are removed first.|$|E
5|$|A {{compound}} {{in the milk}} of the tammar wallaby called AGG01 {{has the potential to}} be a new and powerful antibiotic. AGG01 is a protein, and in laboratory tests has proven to be 100 times more effective than penicillin. It has killed over 99% of the pathogenic bacteria, (both Gram-positive and Gram-negative), that it was incubated with, including Salmonella, Proteus vulgaris and Staphylococcus aureus. It also killed one species of fungus. Subsequent analysis of the genome has led to the discovery of several cathelicidin peptides, which could <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> antibiotics.|$|E
5|$|Because of its {{excellent}} thermal {{and chemical}} stability, boron nitride ceramics are traditionally used {{as parts of}} high-temperature equipment. h-BN can be included in ceramics, alloys, resins, plastics, rubbers, and other materials, giving them self-lubricating properties. Such materials are suitable for construction of e.g. bearings and in steelmaking. Plastics filled with BN have less thermal expansion as well as higher thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity. Due to its excellent dielectric and thermal properties, BN is used in electronics e.g. as a substrate for semiconductors, microwave-transparent windows and as a structural material for seals. It can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> dielectric in resistive random access memories.|$|E

5|$|Cnidarians form {{an animal}} phylum {{that are more}} complex than sponges, about as complex as ctenophores (comb jellies), and less complex than bilaterians, which include almost all other animals. However, both cnidarians and ctenophores are more complex than sponges as they have: cells bound by inter-cell {{connections}} and carpet-like basement membranes; muscles; nervous systems; and some have sensory organs. Cnidarians are distinguished from all other animals by having cnidocytes that fire like harpoons and are used mainly to capture prey. In some species, cnidocytes can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> anchors.|$|E
5|$|Cowpeas {{thrive in}} poor dry conditions, growing well in soils up to 85% sand. This makes them a {{particularly}} important crop in arid, semi-desert regions where not many other crops will grow. As {{well as an}} important source of food for humans in poor arid regions the crop can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> feed for livestock. Its nitrogen fixing ability means that as well as functioning as a sole-crop, the cowpea can be effectively intercropped with sorghum, millet, maize, cassava or cotton.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, Adolf Hitler {{decided to}} expand the Reich Chancellery (Reichskanzlei), which he {{considered}} too small for his needs. On 21 July 1935, Leonhard Gall submitted plans for a large reception hall (that could <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> a ballroom) to be built onto the old Chancellery. The drawings were unique {{because of the large}} cellar that led a further one-and-a-half meters down to a bunker which later became known as the Vorbunker.|$|E

5|$|Maple {{syrup and}} its various {{artificial}} imitations {{are widely used}} as toppings for pancakes, waffles, and French toast in North America. They {{can also be used}} to flavour a variety of foods, including fritters, ice cream, hot cereal, fresh fruit, and sausages. It is also used as sweetener for granola, applesauce, baked beans, candied sweet potatoes, winter squash, cakes, pies, breads, tea, coffee, and hot toddies. Maple syrup can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> a replacement for honey in wine (mead).|$|E
5|$|New {{gameplay}} features distinguish Shadow the Hedgehog {{from previous}} Sonic games. For example, Shadow can use guns to combat enemies, adding {{an element of}} third-person shooter gameplay. Parts of the scenery, such as traffic signs, can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> weapons. Another new feature {{is the ability to}} drive vehicles, such as motorcycles and alien aircraft. Although Shadow can outrun the game's vehicles, the latter have unique capabilities, such as crushing enemies and traversing otherwise impassible acid-covered areas.|$|E
5|$|Personnel {{experienced}} in direct laryngoscopy {{are not always}} immediately available in certain settings that require emergency tracheal intubation. For this reason, specialized devices {{have been designed to}} act as bridges to a definitive airway. Such devices include the laryngeal mask airway, cuffed oropharyngeal airway and the esophageal-tracheal combitube (Combitube). Other devices such as rigid stylets, the lightwand (a blind technique) and indirect fiberoptic rigid stylets, such as the Bullard scope, Upsher scope and the WuScope can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> alternatives to direct laryngoscopy. Each of these devices have its own unique set of benefits and drawbacks, and none of them is effective under all circumstances.|$|E

5|$|The Lebanese {{identity}} card {{may be used}} to verify identity and nationality having the same effect as a valid Lebanese passport, and may <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> a travel document within Syria and Jordan in lieu of a Lebanese passport. In domestic non-electronic identification the driving licence has remained in a leading position. A driving licence is valid for almost every situation where non-electronic personal identification is needed even though they are not officially recognized as such.|$|E
5|$|The PocketStation was a {{miniature}} game console created by SCE as a peripheral {{for the original}} PlayStation. Released exclusively in Japan on December 23, 1999, it featured a monochrome LCD, a speaker, a real-time clock and infrared communication capability. It could <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> a standard PlayStation memory card by connecting it to a PlayStation memory card slot. It was extremely popular in Japan and Sony originally had plans to release it in the United States but the plan was ultimately scrapped due to various manufacturing and supply-and-demand problems.|$|E
5|$|The term {{is mostly}} used in {{historical}} contexts {{and not in}} daily speech. In Danish, Skånelandene is used more often. The terms have no political implications as the region is not a geopolitical entity but a cultural region, without officially established political borders. In some circumstances, the term Skåneland, {{as opposed to the}} terms Skånelandskapen and Skånelandene, can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> a figure of speech for the province Scania.|$|E
