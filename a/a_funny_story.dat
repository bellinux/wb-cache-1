500|$|Discussing the {{likelihood}} a Tangled sequel, Howard {{explained to the}} Los Angeles Times [...] "We don't {{want to do a}} sequel for the sake of sequels ... The story has to be worth telling." [...] Because the original film [...] "buttons up" [...] well, the directors wanted to avoid simply creating a movie wedding featuring Rapunzel and Flynn because [...] "that's not entertainment", so Greno and Howard conceived <b>a</b> <b>funny</b> <b>story</b> about Pascal and Maximus instead, providing the animators and writers with [...] "an opportunity {{to do a lot of}} slapstick" [...] that was mostly absent in Tangled. Wanting the film [...] "to be a movie for everyone", the directors [...] "figured out a way to give [...] exactly what they wanted, so there is a beautiful grand wedding in the short, but what happens pretty quickly, those two goofballs Maximus and Pascal lose the wedding rings ... It turned into this big, zany, cartoony, fun, action-packed short." [...] In the short, Pascal and Maximus encounter [...] "a trail of comical chaos that includes flying lanterns, a flock of doves, a wine barrel barricade and a very sticky finale".|$|E
500|$|Other reviewers {{were less}} positive. The {{political}} {{journalist and author}} Andrew Rawnsley was critical of Blair's writing style in The Observer. [...] "It is Tony Blair's boast that he wrote every word in longhand 'on hundreds of notepads'. That I believe," [...] he wrote. [...] "He was the most brilliant communicator of his era as a platform speaker or television interviewee, but {{he can be a}} ghastly writer. Anyone thinking about taking this journey needs to be given a travel advisory: much of the prose is execrable ... I could say that it is a pity that Tony Blair did not employ a ghostwriter to prettify the prose and organise his recollections more elegantly." [...] Rawnsley does, though, praise the book as being [...] "a more honest political memoir than most and more open in many respects than I had anticipated." [...] Julian Glover, a columnist in The Guardian, said that [...] "no political memoir has ever been like this: a book written as if in a dream—or a nightmare; a literary out-of-body experience. By turns honest, confused, memorable, boastful, fitfully endearing, important, lazy, shallow, rambling and intellectually correct, it scampers through the last two decades like a trashy airport read." [...] The Sunday Telegraph was extremely critical of Blair's writing style. [...] "If Blair wants to tell you <b>a</b> <b>funny</b> <b>story,</b> he makes the mistake of signalling in advance that you should be laughing—what happened was 'hilarious', his first weekend at Balmoral was 'utterly freaky'—thereby strangling the anecdote at birth. The book, like its author, is slightly embarrassing." [...] In the journal History Today, Archie Brown, Emeritus Professor of Politics at Oxford University was critical of what he believed to be Blair's flawed sense of leadership, but had praise for the chapter on the Northern Ireland peace process: [...] "Blair's role in the Northern Ireland settlement was perhaps his single most noteworthy achievement. His account of it is also the best chapter in a book which, even by the standards of memoirists who fancy themselves to be remarkable leaders, is strikingly egocentric." ...|$|E
