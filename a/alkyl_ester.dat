40|$|AbstractThe {{demand for}} a {{sustainable}} and non-toxic alternative insulating fluid {{has been on the}} increase because of the negative environmental impact of mineral-based insulating fluids. Natural ester appeared to be a viable alternative, but it has poor thermo-oxidative properties and higher melting temperature. This report presents the influence of chemical modification on the properties of natural ester-based alternative insulating fluid. <b>Alkyl</b> <b>ester</b> derivatives were synthesized from laboratory purified palm kernel oil. A straight chain <b>alkyl</b> <b>ester</b> was first synthesized to enhance the flow properties of the oil. It was then followed by a process that converts the double bond to an epoxy group. Side-branched ester samples were synthesized from the laboratory synthesized epoxy <b>alkyl</b> <b>ester</b> of palm kernel oil. The chemical modification was performed through esterification reaction involving the epoxy <b>alkyl</b> <b>ester</b> of palm kernel oil and acid anhydrides under nitrogen and in the presence of boron trifluoride etherate as catalyst. The reactions were monitored and the products confirmed using FTIR and GC–MS. The melting point and thermo-oxidative stability of the fluids were examined using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The melting point of the ester derivatives was found to reduce with side chain attachment and antioxidant significantly improved the thermal stability. The dielectric behavior and electrical breakdown properties of the ester derivatives were analyzed and compared. The dielectric loss was dominated by mobile charged particles and the charged particles appeared to exhibit faster dynamics compared with purified palm kernel oil. This may be attributed to the mobility of the charges which is related to the viscosity of the esters. The esters possessed excellent breakdown strengths suggest that the processing to optimize the physical properties did not have a negative influence on the electrical breakdown strength.

As a result, the reaction mechanism and formalism for mechanism development are suitable for extension to larger oxygenated hydrocarbon fuels, together with an improved kinetic understanding of the structure and chemical kinetics of <b>alkyl</b> <b>ester</b> fuels that can be extended to biodiesel fuels.

40|$|AbstractDiesel {{engines are}} {{efficient}} systems popularly used to meet electricity and other power requirements for agriculture, industry, transportation and decentralized power generation. Vegetable oils can be successfully used in Compression Ignition (CI) engine either through engine modifications or fuel modifications, later being more feasible option. Fuel modification options include blending of vegetable oils with mineral diesel, transesterification, cracking/pyrolysis, micro-emulsion, and hydrogenation to reduce polymerization and viscosity, transesterification of vegetable oil {{with a short}} chain alcohol i. e. methanol or ethanol being most popular. Several non-edible plant oils {{have been found to}} be promising crude oils for the production of biodiesel. Methanol is most commonly used in commercial production of biodiesel. Fatty acid <b>alkyl</b> <b>esters</b> (FAAE) produced from higher alcohols is of interest as they may have different fuel properties in comparison to methyl or ethyl esters. In the present investigations, preparation of methanol, ethanol, propanol and butanol were used for formation of <b>alkyl</b> <b>esters</b> of Jatropha, Karanja and Castor. The composition of Jatropha, Karanja and Castor oil were analysed and alcoholysis process for preparing <b>alkyl</b> <b>esters</b> of Jatropha, Karanja and Castor oil with various alcohols was optimised. Alkyl ester-diesel blends were used to test the diesel engine at different load conditions and extensive performance and emissions studies were conducted in single cylinder direct injection compression ignition engines. It is concluded that lower blends of ethyl, propyl and butyl esters of Jatropha and Karanja feedstock have physico-chemical properties similar to methyl esters. However, deviation from the properties became larger for higher blending ratio. Therefore, in order to get engine performance in close range of diesel, the optimum blending ratio of higher <b>alkyl</b> <b>esters</b> need to be even less than methyl esters. Lower blends of higher <b>alkyl</b> <b>esters</b> are expected to give engine characteristics in close proximity to diesel overcoming the limitations of bio-diesel, while retaining the advantages...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{therapeutic}} {{potential of}} gallic acid and its derivatives as anti-cancer, antimicrobial and antiviral agents is well known. We {{have examined the}} mechanism by which natural gallic acid and newly synthesized gallic acid <b>alkyl</b> <b>esters</b> and related protocatechuic acid <b>alkyl</b> <b>esters</b> inhibit HIV- 1 protease to compare {{the influence of the}} aromatic ring substitutions on inhibition. We used Zhang-Poorman’s kinetic analysis and fluorescent probe binding to demonstrate that several gallic and protecatechuic acid <b>alkyl</b> <b>esters</b> inhibited HIV- 1 protease by preventing the dimerization of this obligate homodimeric aspartic protease rather than targeting the active site. The tri-hydroxy substituted benzoic moiety in gallates was more favorable than the di-substituted one in protocatechuates. In both series, the type of inhibition, its mechanism and the inhibitory efficiency dramatically depended on the length of the alkyl chain: no inhibition with alkyl chains less than 8 carbon atoms long. Molecular dynamics simulations corroborated the kinetic data and propose that gallic esters are intercalated between the two N- and C-monomer ends. They complete the β-sheet and disrupt the dimeric enzyme. The best gallic ester (14 carbon atoms, Kid of 320 nM) also inhibited the multi-mutated protease MDR-HM. These results will aid the rational design of future generations of non-peptide inhibitors of HIV- 1 protease dimerization that inhibit multi-mutated proteases. Finally, our work suggests the wide use of gallic and protocatechuic <b>alkyl</b> <b>esters</b> to dissociate intermolecular β-sheets involved in protein-protein interactions. - See more at: [URL]...|$|R
