5|$|Recently Karnataka {{has emerged}} as a hot spot for health care tourism. Karnataka has the highest number of {{approved}} health systems and <b>alternative</b> <b>therapies</b> in India. Along with some ISO certified government-owned hospitals, private institutions which provide international-quality services have caused the health care industry to grow by 30% during 2004–05. Hospitals in Karnataka treat around 8,000 health tourists every year.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{some of the}} factors associated with the choice of <b>alternative</b> health <b>therapy</b> that have attracted the greatest attention in the largely exploratory research carried out to date. Patients of an alternative health centre and a comparable community sample were interviewed by telephone. The <b>alternative</b> <b>therapy</b> respondents showed a substantially lower level {{of confidence in the}} efficacy of conventional medicine in general, but they were not clearly less satisfied with their recent experiences with medical practitioners and treatment. Even though {{there was no evidence that}} they suffered more from persistent medical conditions, they were clearly less satisfied with the ability of conventional treatment to relieve them. <b>Alternative</b> <b>therapy</b> respondents preferred <b>alternative</b> treatment for a wide range of symptoms, but they were selective in their choices of treatment. They perceived themselves to be substantially more "unconventional" than did the community sample. Overall, the variables that best distinguished the <b>alternative</b> <b>therapy</b> group from the community sample were "unconventionality" and "general lack of confidence in conventional medical treatment", both of which made significant independent contributions. It is suggested that research in the area should now move from an exploratory approach to the testing of explicit explanatory propositions. <b>alternative</b> <b>therapy</b> unorthodox <b>therapy</b> <b>alternative</b> medicine health attitudes...|$|R

40|$|The idea of {{religious}} practice being ‘post-secular’ raises questions concerning secularisation, sacralisation {{and the various}} meanings of the prefix ‘post’. This paper investigates a kind of practice that is ever increasing in late modern, Western societies and elsewhere; namely, the practice of <b>alternative</b> <b>therapy</b> and the conceptualisations and world-views pertaining to it. The {{focus is on the}} themes of suffering and death in relation to <b>alternative</b> spirituality and <b>therapy.</b> Some answers are given to the following questions: is <b>alternative</b> <b>therapy</b> a kind of post-secular religious practice? If so, what kinds of answers or consolations does <b>alternative</b> <b>therapy</b> offer in the face of suffering and death? How do possible ‘alternative theodicies’ relate to holism as a paradigmatic principle? To what extent does, for example, ‘reincarnationism’ seem to function as explanatory model regarding suffering, evil and death...|$|R

25|$|Currently, {{allergic}} {{diseases and}} asthma are usually treated {{with one or}} more of the following drugs: (1) antihistamines and antileukotrienes, which antagonize the inflammatory mediators histamine and leukotrienes, (2) local or systemic (oral or injectable) corticosteroids, which suppress a broad spectrum of inflammatory mechanisms, (3) short or long-acting bronchodilators, which relax smooth muscle of constricted airway in asthma, or (4) mast cell stabilizers, which inhibit the degranulation of mast cells that is normally triggered by IgE-binding at FcεRI. Long-term uses of systemic corticosteroids are known to cause many serious side effects and are advisable to avoid, if <b>alternative</b> <b>therapies</b> are available.|$|E
25|$|Many <b>alternative</b> <b>therapies</b> and {{interventions}} are available, ranging from elimination diets to chelation therapy. Few {{are supported by}} scientific studies. Treatment approaches lack empirical support in quality-of-life contexts, and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and real-world relevance. Scientific evidence appears to matter less to service providers than program marketing, training availability, and parent requests. Even {{if they do not}} help, conservative treatments such as changes in diet are expected to be harmless aside from their bother and cost. Dubious invasive treatments are a much more serious matter: for example, in 2005, botched chelation therapy killed a five-year-old boy with autism.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{evidence}} of consistent benefit of <b>alternative</b> <b>therapies</b> for menopausal symptoms despite their popularity. The effect of soy isoflavones on menopausal symptoms is promising for reduction of hot flashes and vaginal dryness. Evidence does not support a benefit from phytoestrogens such as coumestrol, femarelle, or the non-phytoestrogen black cohosh. There is {{no evidence}} to support the efficacy of acupuncture as a management for menopausal symptoms. As of 2011 there is no support for herbal or dietary supplements in the prevention or treatment of the mental changes that occur around menopause. A 2016 Cochrane review found not enough evidence to show a difference between Chinese herbal medicine and placebo for the vasomotor symptoms.|$|E

25|$|No {{controlled}} {{clinical trials}} {{have been conducted}} on ADEM treatment, but aggressive treatment aimed at rapidly reducing inflammation of the CNS is standard. The widely accepted first-line treatment is high doses of intravenous corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone or dexamethasone, followed by 3–6 weeks of gradually lower oral doses of prednisolone. Patients treated with methylprednisolone have shown better outcomes than those treated with dexamethasone. Oral tapers of {{less than three weeks}} duration show a higher chance of relapsing, and tend to show poorer outcomes. Other anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive therapies have been reported to show beneficial effect, such as plasmapheresis, high doses of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), mitoxantrone and cyclophosphamide. These are considered <b>alternative</b> <b>therapies,</b> used when corticosteroids cannot be used or fail to show an effect.|$|E

500|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet achieved {{national media}} exposure in the US in October 1994, when NBC's Dateline television programme reported {{the case of}} Charlie Abrahams, son of Hollywood producer Jim Abrahams. The two-year-old suffered from epilepsy that had remained uncontrolled by mainstream and <b>alternative</b> <b>therapies.</b> Abrahams discovered {{a reference to the}} ketogenic diet in an epilepsy guide for parents and brought Charlie to John Freeman at Johns Hopkins Hospital, which had continued to offer the therapy. Under the diet, Charlie's epilepsy was rapidly controlled and his developmental progress resumed. This inspired Abrahams to create the Charlie Foundation to promote the diet and fund research. A multicentre prospective study began in 1994, the results were presented to the American Epilepsy Society in 1996 and were published in 1998. There followed an explosion of scientific interest in the diet. In 1997, Abrahams produced a TV movie, ...First Do No Harm, starring Meryl Streep, in which a young boy's intractable epilepsy is successfully treated by the ketogenic diet.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Dreamz Unlimited {{attempted}} a comeback with Khan portraying {{the title role}} in Santosh Sivan's historical epic Aśoka, a partly fictionalised account {{of the life of}} emperor Ashoka. The film was screened at the Venice Film Festival and the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival to a positive response, but it performed poorly at Indian box offices. As losses continued to mount for the production company, Khan was forced to close srkworld.com, a company that he had started along with Dreamz Unlimited.

500|$|The {{degree to}} which {{individuals}} {{are involved in the}} New Age varies. Heelas argued that those involved could be divided into three broad groups; the first comprised those who were completely dedicated to it and its ideals, often working in professions that furthered those goals. The second consisted of [...] "serious part-timers" [...] who worked in unrelated fields but who nevertheless spent much of their free time involved in movement activities. The third was that of [...] "casual part-timers" [...] who occasionally involved themselves in New Age activities but for whom the movement was not a central aspect of their life. MacKian instead suggested that involvement could be seen as being layered like an onion; at the core are [...] "consultative" [...] practitioners who devote their life to New Age practices, around that are [...] "serious" [...] practitioners who still invest considerable effort into New Age activities, and on the periphery are [...] "non-practitioner consumers", individuals affected by he general dissemination of New Age ideas but who do not devote themselves more fully to them. Many New Age practices have filtered into wider Western society, with a 2000 poll for instance revealing that 39% of the UK population had tried <b>alternative</b> <b>therapies.</b>|$|E
