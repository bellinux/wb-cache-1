50|$|<b>General</b> <b>knowledge</b> {{has been}} found to robustly predict {{proofreading}} skills in university students. A study found that proofreading had a larger correlation with <b>general</b> <b>knowledge</b> than with <b>general</b> intelligence, verbal reasoning, or openness to experience. In a multiple regression analysis using <b>general</b> <b>knowledge,</b> <b>general</b> intelligence, verbal reasoning, five factor personality traits, and learning styles as predictors, only <b>general</b> <b>knowledge</b> was a significant predictor.|$|R
50|$|High scorers {{on tests}} of <b>general</b> <b>knowledge</b> tend to also score highly on {{intelligence}} tests. IQ {{has been found}} to robustly predict <b>general</b> <b>knowledge</b> scores even after accounting for differences in age, sex, and five factor model personality traits. In the Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory of intelligence, <b>general</b> <b>knowledge</b> is considered a component of crystallized intelligence. Standardized IQ tests may therefore include measures of <b>general</b> <b>knowledge,</b> such as in the information subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale.|$|R

40|$|A {{method for}} {{integrated}} case-based and generalization-based reasoning and learning is described. The primary role of <b>general</b> domain <b>knowledge</b> {{is to provide}} explanatory support for the case-based processes. A general explanation engine - the ACTIVATE-EXPLAIN-FOCUS cycle - utilizes a presumably rich, multirelational knowledge model in producing context-dependent explanations. 1. Introduction Case-based reasoning covers {{a wide variety of}} methods. While some methods emphasize problem solving and learning by use of specific cases instead of <b>general</b> domain <b>knowledge,</b> others use <b>general</b> <b>knowledge</b> 1 combined with cases. Among the latter, various approaches to what types of <b>general</b> <b>knowledge</b> to incorporate, as well as to how <b>general</b> <b>knowledge</b> is used, are taken. <b>General</b> <b>knowledge</b> may be used for an additional problem solving method, e. g. a method that is applied if the case-based method fails, and/or it may be used within the case-based method itself. The <b>general</b> <b>knowledge</b> may be of a s [...] ...|$|R

50|$|<b>General</b> <b>knowledge</b> {{has been}} found to predict exam results in a study of British schoolchildren. The study {{examined}} cognitive ability and personality predictors of exam performance and found that <b>general</b> <b>knowledge</b> was positively correlated with GCSE English, mathematics, and overall exam results. <b>General</b> <b>knowledge</b> test scores predicted exam results, even after controlling for IQ, five factor model personality traits, and learning styles.|$|R

50|$|<b>General</b> <b>knowledge</b> {{has been}} found to have weak {{associations}} with measures of creativity. In a study examining contributions of personality and intelligence to creativity, <b>general</b> <b>knowledge</b> was positively correlated with tests of divergent thinking, but was unrelated to a biographical measure of creative achievement, self-rated creativity, or a composite measure of creativity. The relationship between <b>general</b> <b>knowledge</b> and divergent thinking became non-significant when controlling for fluid intelligence.|$|R
50|$|People high in <b>general</b> <b>knowledge</b> tend to {{be highly}} open to new {{experiences}} and in typical intellectual engagement. The relationship between openness to experience and <b>general</b> <b>knowledge</b> remains robust even when IQ is taken into account. People high in openness may be more motivated to engage in intellectual pursuits that increase their <b>knowledge.</b> Relationships between <b>general</b> <b>knowledge</b> and other five factor model traits {{tend to be}} weak and inconsistent. Though {{one study found that}} extraversion and neuroticism were negatively correlated with <b>general</b> <b>knowledge,</b> others found that they were unrelated. Inconsistent results have also been found for conscientiousness.|$|R

40|$|<b>General</b> <b>knowledge</b> {{is widely}} applicable, but {{relatively}} slow {{to apply to}} any particular situation. Specific knowledge can be used rapidly where it applies, but is only narrowly applicable. We present an automatic scheme to migrate <b>general</b> <b>knowledge</b> to specific knowledge during reasoning. This scheme relies on a nested rule representation which retains the rule builder's intentions about which of the possible specializations of the rule will be most useful. If both <b>general</b> and specific <b>knowledge</b> is available and applicable, a system may be slowed down by {{trying to use the}} <b>general</b> <b>knowledge</b> as well as, or instead of, the specific <b>knowledge.</b> However, if <b>general</b> <b>knowledge</b> is purged from the system after migration, the system will lose the flexibility of being able to handle different situations. To retain the flexibility without paying the price in speed, a shadowing scheme is presented that prevents <b>general</b> <b>knowledge</b> from being used when specific knowledge migrated from it is available and [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{shows some}} idea as follows: First, {{integrated}} {{design of the}} Twin Towers as the changing action from IAIN to UIN Sunan Ampel. The religion and <b>general</b> <b>knowledge’s</b> position of Twin Towers’ integrated design is not mixed into one, but it works individually, and at the certain time are united in mutual dialogue. Second, Islamize design is done in order to criticize the <b>general</b> <b>knowledge</b> which has western sources and are secular, materialistic, and individualistic. In the process to Islamize the knowledge, Islamic knowledge tries to intervene the <b>general</b> <b>knowledge</b> in order to filter it so the knowledge will be Islamized. Consequently, to Islamize knowledge is to give an Islamic concept into <b>general</b> <b>knowledge.</b> Third, there are {{the similarities and differences}} between integrated design knowledge based on Islamic knowledge and integrated Twin Towers. The difference is in its epistemology process. The similarity is in the curriculum (ontology) and objective (axiology). In the curriculum, the examined knowledge is religion and <b>general</b> <b>knowledge.</b> While the objective, Islamize knowledge and integrated Twin Towers aims to integrate religion and <b>general</b> <b>knowledge,</b> to dialogue, to communicate, and to synergy, so it can be a knowledge which is intact-integral-integrative. ...|$|R

In opposition, contextual knowledge is the knowledge obtained from the interpretation of a situation.
