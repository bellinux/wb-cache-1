40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a graph representation called the Value Flow Graph (VFG). The VFG represents {{the flow of}} values between the {{versions of the same}} variable in the Static Sigle Assignment (SSA) form <b>and</b> <b>visually</b> <b>characterizes</b> the properties of SSA. We show the conventional definition of the (most commonly used) SSA form is overly conservative and propose a new relaxed variation of SSA form. We then discuss and characterize the optimality, in terms of size, of the proposed form and of the conventional SSA form with the minimality of the VFG.

40|$|This {{study focused}} on {{electrochemically}} <b>and</b> <b>visually</b> <b>characterizing</b> tin (Sn), platinum (Pt) and rhodium (Rh) nanoparticles on platinum sputtered mica electrodes by means of Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) and Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy (STS). The {{purpose of this study}} was to analyze the correlation between the distribution of tin on platinum and rhodium electrode surfaces and the electrochemical activity of these surfaces toward ethanol oxidation. Pt, Rh, and Sn nanoparticles were synthesized, purified, cleaned and deposited in different combinations on Pt coated mica electrodes to create a surface made up entirely of nanoparticles. Then the electrochemical behaviors of the modified Pt electrodes were found through cyclic voltammetry. The surface nanostructure was characterized using STM and composition through STS. Together composition, surface structure and electrochemistry yield a thorough characterization of the modified electrodes, which can be studied to optimize Pt ethanol fuel cell catalysts. Two of the electrodes studied, consisting of nanoparticle deposits (nominal compositions Pt 2 Sn and Rh 2 Sn), showed higher current peaks at low potentials in the CV scans compared to pure Pt and Rh electrodes. These electrodes also showed a homogenous distribution of the different types of nanoparticles...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the population density of Pratylenchus brachyurus and Pratylenchus zeae associated with Brachiaria brizantha, B. decumbens and B. humidicola and their influence on forage availability and quality. The experiment was conducte in the Hisaeda Farm, Terenos, MS, Brazil. Soil, roots and plant aerial part were harvest with ten replications each, in one square meter randomized sets encompassing three treatments: Good, Intermediary <b>and</b> Bad, <b>visually</b> <b>characterized,</b> considering the percentage of green material. P. brachyurus and P. zeae density were evaluated in soil and plant roots. Dry matter of green, dead and re-growth materials, plant nutritional status and forage quality were assessed in the aerial plant part. Soil fertility was determined in all harvested samples. Both nematode species were identified from all samples, with a larger numbe in the roots (between 87 - 311 P. brachyurus and 1 - 61 P. zeae. 10 g- 1) than in the soil (0 - 8 P. brachyurus and 1 - 39 P. zeae. 200 cm- 3), however, {{no significant differences were}} found in the number of specimens between treatments. Considering that these forage species are perennial and host Pratylenchus spp, there is a tendency to increase the population of these pathogens over time, becoming a serious phytosanitary problem...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Streptococcus pneumoniae is {{a leading}} {{pathogen}} with an extracellular lifestyle; however, it is detected by cytosolic surveillance systems of macrophages. The innate immune response that follows cytosolic sensing of cell wall components results in recruitment of additional macrophages, which subsequently clear colonizing organisms from host airways. In this study, we monitored cytosolic access by following the transit of the abundant bacterial surface component capsular polysaccharide, which {{is linked to the}} cell wall. Confocal <b>and</b> electronmicroscopy <b>visually</b> <b>characterized</b> the location of cell wall components in murine macrophages outside membrane-bound organelles. Quantification of capsular polysaccharide through cellular fractionation demonstrated that cytosolic access of bacterial cell wall components is dependent on phagocytosis, bacterial sensitivity to the host’s degradative enzyme lysozyme, and release of the pore-forming toxin pneumolysin. Activation of p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling is important for limiting access to the cytosol; however, ultimately, these are catastrophic events for both the bacteria and the macrophage, which undergoes cell death. Our results show how expression of a pore-forming toxin ensures the death of phagocytes that take up the organism, although cytosolic sensing results in innate immune detection that eventually allows for successful host defense. These findings provide an example of how cytosolic access applies to an extracellular microbe and contributes to its pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is a bacterial pathogen that {{is a leading}} cause of pneumonia. Pneu-mococcal disease is preceded by colonization of the nasopharynx, which lasts several weeks before being cleared by the host’...|$|R

The theoretical perspective is the social construction of knowledge, identified through the institutional and social context to the analysis of signals as a driving force of knowledge throughout the across the academic career, {{due to the fact that}} any physical phenomenon to be studied is a signal. Hence the proposal promotes visual thinking and the development of advanced mathematical thinking. Given the academic background and content of the subjects prior to the issue is considered the TFS as a linear combination of orthogonal functions <b>and</b> aims to <b>visually</b> <b>characterize</b> the concepts involved correlating the physical phenomenon in this case the signals are linear time-invariant.

A highly aesthetic and subversive {{performing art}}, Butoh often evokes "images of decay, of fear and desperation, images of eroticism, ecstasy and stillness. " Typically performed with a white layer of paint covering the entire body of the dancer, Butoh is <b>visually</b> <b>characterized</b> by continual transformations between postures, distorted physical and facial expressions, and an emphasis on condensed <b>and</b> <b>visually</b> slow movements. Some of the general characteristics of Butoh performance include "a particular openness to working with the subtle energy in the body; the malleability of time; the power of the grotesque. ...|$|R
40|$|In this research, the {{oxidation}} and {{melting behaviour}} of AZ 91 D magnesium alloy granules was investigated throughout using in-situ melting technique when the granules {{were covered by}} flux. The granules were heated inside an electrical resistance furnace at four different temperatures of 650, 700, 750 and 800 °C for 30 min. Thermal {{analysis was used to}} detect the granules characteristic temperatures during the technique. The products of the heating process were examined <b>visually</b> <b>and</b> <b>characterized</b> by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The results showed that due to occurrence of severe oxidation and combustion, particularly at 800 °C, a significant amount of the granules transformed to a powdered state. The presence of the mould materials within the oxidation residue was detected indicating that severe mould-magnesium reaction occurred during heating. It was found that the granules melted during the heating process. However, the presence of oxides on the granules prevented them from fusing to form a single melt...|$|R

Pt and Sn nanoparticles were synthesized, purified, cleaned, and deposited onto a graphite surface to characterize the surface nanostructure using STM. Samples of Pt and Sn nanoparticle solution were also analyzed using UV-vis absorption to properly depict at what point in time the metal in the solution will drop down to a ground state where no absorption would occur, signaling the completion of an initial reaction. Together STM and UV-vis absorption were used to determine the particle size distribution and its relationship to time associated with the synthesis...|$|R
40|$|The role {{of images}} {{in the last ten}} years has changed radically due to the advent of social networks: from media objects mainly used to {{communicate}} visual information, images have become personal, associated with the people that create or interact with them (for example, giving a “like”). Therefore, in the same way that a post reveals something of its author, so now the images associated to a person may embed some of her individual characteristics, such as her personality traits. In this paper, we explore this new level of image understanding with the ultimate goal of relating a set of image preferences to personality traits by using a deep learning framework. In particular, our problem focuses on inferring both self-assessed (how the personality traits of a person can be guessed from her preferred image) and attributed traits (what impressions in terms of personality traits these images trigger in unacquainted people), learning a sort of wisdom of the crowds. Our characterization of each image is locked within the layers of a CNN, allowing us to discover more entangled attributes (aesthetic patterns and semantic information) and to better generalize the patterns that identify a trait. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art results <b>and</b> captures what <b>visually</b> <b>characterizes</b> a certain trait: using a deconvolution strategy we found a clear distinction of features, patterns and content between low and high values in a given trait...|$|R

Here, the outcome of heart transplantation was related to preoperative renograms, and the differentiating and prognostic value of renography was analyzed. Methods: The study population consisted of 50 {{patients with}} ischemie CM expecting heart transplantation. Anatomical renal pathology was excluded in all patients. Dynamic renal scintigraphy was performed with 99 mTc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine. Background-subtracted renograms were inspected <b>visually</b> <b>and</b> <b>characterized</b> numerically. Mean parenchymal transit time (mPTT), renal tracer content at 15 min (RTC 15) and retention index (Rl) were determined.
