Mary Margaret understands since her own romantic arrangement is not ideal. Sean shows up on a break from work and proposes to Ashley; she accepts and they {{go out for a}} drive. David shows up next to give Mary Margret her Valentine, but mistakenly gives her Kathryn's. Mary Margaret says she thought if two people were meant to be together they would find a way, but maybe she and David need another way. She tells him he should probably go home.|$|E

Registered Nurses treat patients, record their medical history, provide emotional support, and provide follow-up care. Nurses also help doctors perform diagnostic tests. Nurses are almost <b>always</b> <b>working</b> {{on their own or}} with other nurses. Nurses will assist doctors in the emergency room or in trauma care when help is needed.|$|E

25|$|Buttons and Buttonholes: the three-roll-two {{construction}} {{features a}} lapel that hides the third button, {{in order to}} provide extra freedom of movement thanks to a longer opening in the front. The buttonhole on the lapel is called “occhiello” in Italian, and it means “little eye” for its elongated almond shape. There isn’t really a tradition for a specific type of buttonhole in Naples, but there is a tendency of Neapolitan tailors to prefer slightly shorter and thicker buttonholes that resemble those of a shirt, while “regular” buttonholes of English tradition are more elongated and slender. Some tailors add a little teardrop shape {{at the end of the}} buttonhole, but that’s an aesthetic choice that does not refer to a particular tradition. For what concerns the buttons on the sleeves, they are <b>always</b> <b>working</b> buttons, and they are always overlapping, as if they were kissing each other.|$|E
500|$|Until {{he began}} making spoken {{dialogue}} films with The Great Dictator, Chaplin never shot from a completed script. Many {{of his early}} films began with only a vague premise – for example [...] "Charlie enters a health spa" [...] or [...] "Charlie works in a pawn shop." [...] He then had sets constructed and worked with his stock company to improvise gags and [...] "business" [...] using them, almost <b>always</b> <b>working</b> the ideas out on film. As ideas were accepted and discarded, a narrative structure would emerge, frequently requiring Chaplin to reshoot an already-completed scene that might have otherwise contradicted the story. From A Woman of Paris onward Chaplin began the filming process with a prepared plot, but Robinson writes that every film up to Modern Times [...] "went through many metamorphoses and permutations before the story took its final form." ...|$|E

At the time, she was {{deciding}} whether she wanted to release a greatest hits album or a new studio album. Lopez stated that {{when it comes time to}} make an album, she doesn't sit down and write for the entire thing. She revealed that she is <b>always</b> <b>working</b> on new music and that her albums [...] "happen organically" [...] when she has recorded enough material. Lopez explained: [...] "I don't ever stop. I keep going with it. These records, like 'Follow the Leader,' [...] they just kind of came about. It wasn't something like, 'Oh, I'm going to sit down and make a record right now.'" [...] Among the songs she recorded, two were chosen to be included on Dance Again... The Hits: [...] "Dance Again" [...] and [...] "Goin' In".|$|E

500|$|Sarmiento {{was born}} in Carrascal, a poor suburb of San Juan, Argentina on February 15, 1811. His father, José Clemente Quiroga Sarmiento y Funes, {{had served in the}} {{military}} during the wars of independence, returning prisoners of war to San Juan. His mother, Doña Paula Zoila de Albarracín e Irrázabal, was a very pious woman, who lost her father at a young age and was left with very little to support herself. As a result, she took to selling her weaving in order to afford to build a house of her own. On September 21, 1801, José and Paula were married. They had 15children, 9 of whom died; Domingo was the only son to survive to adulthood. Sarmiento was greatly influenced by his parents, his mother who was <b>always</b> <b>working</b> hard, and his father who told stories of being a patriot and serving his country, something Sarmiento strongly believed in. In Sarmiento's own words: ...|$|E
500|$|Cecil John Rhodes, {{the founder}} of De Beers, was contemplating moving into the town. [...] The {{citizens}} feared that his presence there, given his prominent role in the breakdown of Anglo-Boer relations {{leading up to the}} war, would antagonise the Boers. [...] Consequently, the mayor of Kimberley, as well as various associates of Rhodes, tried to discourage him. However, Rhodes ignored the advice and moved into the town just prior to the onset of the siege, very narrowly evading capture when the Boer ultimatum expired at 5pm on 11October while he was still en route. It was a calculated move to raise the political stakes and thereby force the British government to divert war resources to lifting the siege on his mining operation. [...] Since most of the resources in the garrison were owned by De Beers, Rhodes inevitably became an important factor in the defence organised by Colonel Robert Kekewich. As head of the mining company that owned most of the assets in the town, the military felt that Rhodes proved {{to be more of a}} hindrance as he did not cooperate fully with them; civil and military authorities were not <b>always</b> <b>working</b> together, especially after the death of the second in command of the garrison, Major Scott-Turner. The military took the following view of Rhodes: ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2001, Reznor {{successfully}} completed rehab, and eventually moved from New Orleans to Los Angeles. In a 2005 interview with Kerrang, he reflected on his self-destructive past: [...] "There was a persona that had run its course. I {{needed to get}} my priorities straight, my head screwed on. Instead of <b>always</b> <b>working,</b> I {{took a couple of}} years off, just to figure out who I was and working out if I wanted to keep doing this or not. I had become a terrible addict; I needed to get my shit together, figure out what had happened." [...] In contrast to his former suicidal tendencies, he admitted in another interview that he is [...] "pretty happy".

The spirit he created {{on the set of}} The Andy Griffith Show was joyful and {{professional}} all at once. It was an amazing environment. And I think it was a reflection of the way he felt about having the opportunity to create something that people could enjoy. It was always with respect and passion for the opportunity and really what it could offer people in a very unpretentious and earthy way. He felt he was <b>always</b> <b>working</b> in service of an audience he really respected and cared about. He was a great influence on me. His passing is sad. But he lived a great rich life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Given Kubrick's fear of flying, {{the entire}} film {{was shot in}} England. Sound-stage works were done at London's Pinewood Studios, which {{included}} a detailed recreation of Greenwich Village. [...] Kubrick's perfectionism {{went as far as}} sending workmen to Manhattan to measure street widths and note newspaper vending machine locations. Real New York footage was also shot to be rear projected behind Cruise. Production was followed by a strong campaign of secrecy, helped by Kubrick <b>always</b> <b>working</b> with a short team on set. Outdoor locations included Hatton Garden for a Greenwich Village street, Hamleys for the toy store from the film's ending, and Mentmore Towers and Elveden Hall in Elveden, Suffolk, England for the mansion. Larry Smith, who had first served as a gaffer on both Barry Lyndon and The Shining, was chosen by Kubrick to be the film's cinematographer. Kubrick refused to use studio lighting, forcing Smith to use the available light sources visible in the shot, such as lamps and Christmas tree lights. When this was not adequate, Smith used Chinese paper ball lamps to softly brighten the scene. The color was enhanced by push processing the film reels, which helped bring out the intensity of color.|$|E
