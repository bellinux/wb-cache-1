This capability allows the visual warning lights to remain passive until an aircraft is detected and known to be tracking on an unsafe heading. This leaves the nighttime sky free of unnecessary light pollution thus decreasing public annoyance issues while improving the environmental habitat.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{engineering}} specifications that define <b>aircraft</b> <b>proximity</b> management functions are currently under an intense review. Simultaneously, in an operational context, {{the frequency of}} <b>aircraft</b> <b>proximity</b> incidents is anticipated to increase due to the growth in traditional air travel, {{and the introduction of}} aerial vehicle operations (without a human pilot), and of personalised jets. The design of the airspace rules and procedures needs to be dependable thus assuring that minimum miss-distances and response times will not be violated during all the close proximity situations that arise in actual operations. These important assurances need to be captured as design requirements and objectives (Fulton, 1999, 2002). The development of generalised optimisation strategies and mathematical solutions are used to baseline system performance. An important operational issue in all air transport systems (it is equally applicable to sea transport) and a specific design requirement {{is to be able to}} determine the closest point of approach (CPA) (Tarnopolskaya, Fulton, 2008, 2009; Krozel, Peters, 1997) between aircraft trajectories. The CPA identifies a local minimum in relative range (miss-distance). Several systems have been proposed to manage the varying degrees of proximity arising. These are classified by the time required to reach CPA. The analysis in this paper is generally applicable for all time intervals and aircraft speeds that permi...|$|E

5000|$|The {{final report}} reached the {{following}} final conclusion: The occurrence {{was the result}} of controlled flight into terrain, that is, an airworthy aircraft {{under the control of the}} flight crew was flown unintentionally into terrain with limited awareness by the crew of the <b>aircraft’s</b> <b>proximity</b> to terrain. The crew continued the approach below the minimum descent altitude (MDA) when they were not visual with the runway environment contrary to standard operating procedures. The investigation report identified a range of contributing and other safety factors relating to the flight crew of the aircraft, TransAsia’s flight operations and safety management processes, the communication of weather information to the flight crew, coordination issues at civil/military joint-use airport, and the regulatory oversight of TransAsia by the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA).|$|R

40|$|Specifying {{proximity}} warning {{functions for}} aircraft in managed airspace has received considerable attention. However, similar functions for aircraft operating in unmanaged airspace have received comparatively little analysis {{despite the fact}} that these functions are stressed to a greater physical degree, and perhaps more frequently, than in managed airspace. The mid-air collision hazard and its associated risk are re-examined from both an historical and a systematic engineering modelling viewpoint. Historic measures of this transport risk in managed airspace have been based on fatalities normalized by flight hours or flight movements. However some of these data may not be available in unmanaged airspace. Another approach to measurement directs attention to populations at risk where several measures are now well known: collective risk, individual risk and the frequency of occurrence of the hazards that give rise to such risk. A decision support methodology is presented that relates both transport and population-based approaches. A cohesive and consistent set of aspired goals for various stakeholder groups can be set taking into account the different stakeholder needs. A case study is drawn from historic mid-air collision data to illustrate the process. A consistent basis for national-level policy decisions harmonised with proactive engineering design requirements is achieved. The strengths, limitations and implications of this approach for engineering design purposes are discussed.

40|$|Lasers {{have been}} used for {{important}} atmospheric research almost since their inception. Present day lidar systems continue this serious work and lasers are currently being used in increasingly sophisticated ways to expand our knowledge of atmospheric processes. Langley Research Center, for example, has been performing airborne and ground-based stratospheric volcanic-aerosol lidar measurements for the past 27 years and the University of Utah has been measuring cirrus cloud radiative properties with lidar for the past 20 years. Although the widespread use of lasers probing the atmosphere is too voluminous to cite in an extended abstract, one critical fact must be noted: atmospheric lidar measurements must increasingly be performed wherever they are needed and thus the problems associated with the operation of lidars and aircraft in the same airspace are becoming increasingly vexatious. The lidar community is quite sensitive to this issue and procedures such as the issuance of Notices to Airmen (NOTAMS), informing the FAA of lidar operations, and use of ground-based aircraft observers are already being widely utilized. Current measures, however, depend largely on pilots receiving the NOTAM and acting on it or approach control vectoring the aircraft away from the lidar site. Perhaps a better approach is to provide the lidar site with an autonomous capability to automatically interrupt laser operations while any aircraft is close-by. This abstract describes our efforts to develop and test an inexpensive radar system for use as an <b>aircraft</b> <b>proximity</b> warning and laser shut-down device during atmospheric lidar operations...|$|E

Three types of proximity maps are presented: presence maps that indicate the local density of traffic; conflict maps that determine locations and probabilities of potential conflicts; and outliers maps that evaluate the probability of conflict due to aircraft not belonging to dominant traffic patterns. These maps provide traffic flow managers with information relating to the complexity and difficulty of managing an airspace. The intended purpose of the maps is to anticipate how aircraft flows will interact, and how outliers impact the dominant traffic flow for a given time period. This formulation is able to predict which "critical" regions may be subject to conflicts between aircraft, thereby requiring careful monitoring. These probabilities are computed using a generative aircraft flow model. Time-varying flow characteristics, such as geometrical configuration, speed, and probability density function of aircraft spatial distribution within the flow, are determined from archived Enhanced Traffic Management System data, using a tailored clustering algorithm.

In this research, an approach to predicting the onset of loss of-control events is developed using a Laplace-based method, where a state space model is used to simulate {{the dynamics of the}} aircraft. Laplace transformations are then used to calculate the control authority required to reach a predefined limit on the aircraft's angle-of-attack, where the limit represents the control loss boundary. This method is applied to the short period dynamics of the NASA Generic Transport Model, and the remaining amount of allowable control authority the pilot has before reaching a loss-of-control situation is then determined.

40|$|Increasing the {{efficiency}} of aircraft operations offers a shorter term solution to decreasing aircraft fuel burn than fleet replacement. By estimating the current airspace inefficiency, we can {{get an idea of}} the upper limit of savings. Oceanic airspace presents a unique opportunity for savings due to increased separation differences vs. overland flight. ^ We assess fuel burn inefficiency by comparing estimated fuel burn for real world flights with the estimated optimal fuel burn. For computing fuel burn, we use the Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) with corrections based on research by Yoder (2005). Our fuel burn results show general agreement with Yoder’s results. ^ Optimal operation depends on flying 4 -D trajectories that use the least amount of fuel. We decompose optimal 4 -D trajectories into vertical and horizontal components and analyze the inefficiencies of each separately. ^ We use the concept of Specific Ground Range [Jensen, 2011], to find optimal altitudes and speeds. We combine the optimal altitudes and speeds with an <b>aircraft</b> <b>proximity</b> algorithm to find pairs of aircraft in a vertical blocking situations. To find the fuel optimal horizontal track in a wind field, we use methods from the field of Optimal Control. The original problem formulation can be transformed into a Two Point Boundary Value problem which we solve using MATLAB’s bvp 4 c function. ^ From our set of flights, we hypothesized a scenario where aircraft stack {{in such a way that}} they cannot climb to their optimal altitudes because of separations standards. Using aircraft positions we find when aircraft were within separation standards and were blocked from climbing or descending to their optimal altitude. We split our inefficiency results into a blocked and non-blocked set to see if blocking had an effect on mean inefficiency. ^ Our set of flights consisted of real world flights that flew through WATRS and CEP airspace regions during the month of April 2016. Using the optimal altitude for actual flight Mach profiles, we compute a mean inefficiency of 4. 75 % in WATRS and 4. 50 % in CEP, both of which are roughly 2 to 2. 5 percentage points higher than studies using proprietary performance models and data. BADA overestimates optimal altitudes, leading to an overestimate in inefficiency. Inefficiency due to off-optimal speed for WATRS is 2. 18 % vs. 1. 86 % in CEP. ^ Blocking events result in a 2. 59 percentage point increase in mean inefficiency due to off-optimal altitude in WATRS flights, and a 1. 21 percentage point increase in mean inefficiency due to off-optimal altitude in CEP flights. ^ Using wind-optimal horizontal tracks gave a 1. 24 % mean inefficiency in WATRS, and a 0. 41 % mean inefficiency in CEP. ^ The results indicate that, in total, flights through WATRS and CEP have approximately the same inefficiency due to off-optimal altitudes, but that blocking effects are more prevalent in WATRS. In addition, flights through WATRS are farther from their wind-optimal horizontal tracks than flights in CEP. ...|$|E
