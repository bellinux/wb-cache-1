5|$|In {{the last}} <b>arc,</b> <b>Air,</b> Yukito's final wish to save Misuzu's life is heard. The {{timeline}} of the Dream arc has been reset, {{although it is}} now seen through the viewpoint of a crow Misuzu finds and names Sora. New things are revealed that were not seen following Yukito in the Dream arc. After Misuzu finds Sora and brings him back home, her condition worsens and eventually she forgets even who Haruko is. Misuzu's father, Keisuke Tachibana, shows up during this arc wanting to take Misuzu back to his home, but Haruko pleads with him to grant her more time, and they agree on extending the time for three more days. After the three days pass, Keisuke comes back and sees the love between Misuzu and Haruko; he decides to let them stay together. The remainder of this arc has Misuzu and Haruko spending time together like mother and daughter, culminating in Misuzu's death.|$|E

40|$|Tests {{have been}} carried out on the <b>Arc</b> <b>Air</b> Gouging Process to assess the {{effectiveness}} of exhaust ventilation systems and protective equipment against fume and noise. The measures are described in some detail. The results show that adequate protection can be achieved by making use of an exhaust booth with a face velocity of 300 fpm. Investigation into the efficiency of an air fed welding visor showed that it reduced exposure to par-ticulate fume by about 80 per cent and could thus find use in workshops and semi-confined spaces (coupled with local exhaust ventilation). Measurements of the noise generated confirmed the existence of a serious hazard to hearing but the use of certain ear defenders can provide the necessary protection...|$|E
40|$|Flow {{uniformity}} {{in a high}} enthalpy {{facility is}} investigated. The scramjet research facility is composed of a rectangular combustor duct connected to a 100 MW electric <b>arc</b> <b>air</b> heater. The Mach 3. 3 flow is accelerated through a two-dimensional contoured nozzle. Instream measurements were made with water-cooled Pitot probes and stagnation point heat flux gages at stream enthalpy levels ranging from 4 to 7 Mj/kg. Flow surveys were made on the flow centerline and off centerline {{in order to measure}} the three dimensional uniformity of the flow in the rectangular duct. Measurements indicated that although the flow in the aspect ratio 6 : 1 duct was relatively uniform on the centerline, three dimensional viscous effects were apparent near the corners. Flow through the nozzle and constant area duct was modeled computationally using a two dimensional, Navier-Stokes, reacting gas code. The computations predict that the flow in the test section is in vibrational equilibrium. The computed and measured Pitot pressure and heat flux profiles are in reasonable agreement with the experimental data...|$|E
3000|$|Spectroscopy {{was used}} to {{determine}} the density and temperature of G <b>Arc</b> <b>air</b> plasma in the wavelength range of 200 – 1100  nm. The air plasma spectrum was sketched through the origin software (Fig.  3). The spectrum shows some reactive species like N 2, O, [...] H_α, 1 pt H_β([...] 486.1 [...] nm), H_γ([...] 410.2 [...] nm) [...] in plasma. Different species of hydrogen were generated in the collision of water molecules with electrons (H_ 2 O + e→H + OH + e). N 2 and O lines arise from air gases which were excited in the discharge process. Considering Fig.  3 there is no emission in the interval of 200 – 300  nm wavelengths. Reactive oxygen species radiates at 777  nm. Generally, oxygen species {{is one of the most}} important materials for sterilization which has been mentioned in many reports on plasma sterilization. Atomic nitrogen radiates at 745  nm and N 2 as the other important reactive particle is detected in the range of 320 – 400  nm [11, 12]. Ultraviolet peaks are at 364.5, 388.5, 388.9, and 397  nm and the peaks of NO are at 296, 357.7, and 378.9  nm [13]. Such waves are radiated due to collisions between electron and neutral species. Ultraviolet radiation destroys organic components and dissolves hydrogen peroxide and ozone from each other to finally produce hydroxyls in plasma which removes the pollutants and increases the internal electrical energy efficiency.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The present work aims {{to throw}} {{light on the}} effects of arcing in air on the surface state of contact pastilles made of silver-nickel Ag-Ni (60 / 40). Also, the {{photoelectric}} emission from these electrical contacts has been investigated in the spectral range of 196 - 256 nm. In order to study the effects of arcing on the EWF, the metallic samples were subjected to electrical <b>arcs</b> in <b>air,</b> at atmospheric pressure and room temperature, after that, they have been introduced into the vacuum chamber of an experimental UHV set-up for EWF measurements. Both Fowler method of isothermal curves and linearized Fowler plots were used for the measurement of the EWF by the photoelectric effect. It has been found that the EWF varies with the number of applied arcs. Thus, after 500 <b>arcs</b> in <b>air,</b> the observed EWF increasing is probably due to progressive inclusion of oxide on alloy surface.
