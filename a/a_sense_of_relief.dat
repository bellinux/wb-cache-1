Alcohol myopia limits those {{under the influence}} of alcohol to see the world through a nearsighted lens; in other words, consumption of alcohol will lead individuals to temporarily forget about previous worries or problems, for these feelings lay outside of the restricted set of immediate cues that the drinker can respond to. By depriving him of the attention capacity necessary to process undesirable thoughts, alcohol myopia can bring the drinker <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>relief.</b>|$|E
25|$|Regular season {{dominance}} led to {{some success}} in the post-season. The Athletics' lone World Series championship of the era was a four-game sweep of the cross-bay rival San Francisco Giants in the 1989 World Series. Unfortunately for the A's, their sweep of the Giants was overshadowed by the Loma Prieta earthquake that occurred {{at the start of}} Game 3 before a national television audience. This forced the remaining games to be delayed for ten days. When play resumed, the atmosphere was dominated more by <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>relief</b> than celebration by baseball fans. Heavily favored Athletics teams lost the World Series in both 1988, to the Los Angeles Dodgers, and in 1990, to the Cincinnati Reds. The latter was a shocking four-game sweep reminiscent of the A's loss to the Boston Braves 76 years earlier. The team began declining, winning the A.L. West championship in 1992 (but losing to Toronto in the ALCS), then finishing last in 1993.|$|E

2500|$|When {{the church}} {{was built in the}} late 19thcentury, Beckwithshaw was a little hamlet, {{about two and a half}} miles from Harrogate, and its ecclesiastical {{district}} had to be carved from Pannal parish. In 1886 the view was described thus: [...] "In the immense sweep of country which meets the view from the higher grounds lying between Harrogate and Otley and which, beautiful as it is, conveys an idea of loneliness to the mind from the very few habitations that are seen, the eye rests with <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>relief</b> upon the newly-erected edifice at Beckwithshaw."The Yorkshire Post and Leeds Intelligencer, 1886 However, in January and February 1885 there had been an outbreak of scarlet fever, and the school was closed for at least six weeks.

2500|$|According to Dr. John Lane, {{director}} of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, in 1997, although Van Vliet's work has associations with mainstream abstract expressionist painting, more importantly he was a self-taught artist and his painting [...] "has {{that same kind of}} edge the music has". [...] Curator David Breuer asserts that in contrast to the busied, bohemian urban lives of the New York abstract expressionists, the rural desert environment Van Vliet was influenced by is a distinctly naturalistic one, making him a distinguished figure in contemporary art, whose work will survive in canon. Van Vliet stated of his own work, [...] "I'm trying to turn myself inside out on the canvas. I'm trying to completely bare what I think at that moment" [...] and that, [...] "I paint {{for the simple reason that}} I have to. I feel <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>relief</b> after I do." [...] When asked about his artistic influences he stated that there were none. [...] "I just paint like I paint and that's enough influence." [...] He did however state his admiration of Georg Baselitz, the De Stijl artist Piet Mondrian, and Vincent van Gogh; after seeing van Gogh's paintings in person, Van Vliet quoted himself as saying that, [...] "The sun disappoints me so." ...|$|E
2500|$|People {{experiencing}} the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon can often recall {{one or more}} features of the target word, such as the first letter, its syllabic stress, and words similar in sound and/or meaning. Individuals report {{a feeling of being}} seized by the state, feeling something like mild anguish while searching for the word, and <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>relief</b> when the word is found. While many aspects of the tip-of-the-tongue state remain unclear, there are two major competing explanations for its occurrence, the direct-access view and the inferential view. The direct-access view posits that the state occurs when memory strength is not enough to recall an item, but is strong enough to trigger the state. The inferential view claims that TOTs aren't completely based on inaccessible, yet activated targets; rather they arise when the rememberer tries to piece together different clues about the word. Emotional-induced retrieval often causes more TOT experiences than an emotionally neutral retrieval, such as asking where a famous icon was assassinated rather than simply asking the capital city of a state. Emotional TOT experiences also have a longer retrieval time than non-emotional TOT experiences. [...] The cause of this [...] is unknown but possibilities include using a different retrieval strategy when having an emotional TOT experience rather than a non-emotional TOT experience, fluency at the time of retrieval, and strength of memory.|$|E
