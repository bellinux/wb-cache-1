Emma {{encounters}} a 19-year-old pregnant maid named Ashley Boyd (Schram), crying about not having <b>a</b> <b>future</b> <b>for</b> both her and her baby. Emma tells Ashley that she knows how it feels to have a baby at a young age. She encourages Ashley to take charge and change her life.

Ashley attacks him, leaving him unconscious on the floor of his shop.|$|E

25|$|Nadezhda von Meck {{saw things}} very differently. To her, filling {{the roles of}} mother, nurse, governess, dressmaker, housekeeper, and valet was far easier to bear than the humiliation of seeing her husband as a cog in the machine of a {{government}} organization. Neither did fulfilling all those domestic duties lower her resolve or weaken her energy in urging {{him to make a}} break. Russia, desperately short of railways, was expanding its communications network rapidly, and Nadezhda was far-sighted enough to see that <b>a</b> <b>future</b> <b>for</b> her husband lay there.

With Bushmaster PMVs and Light Armoured Vehicles, 1 RTF was able to secure the job sites incorporated into its expanded role. The Reconstruction Task Force was tasked with reconstruction and the improvement of provincial infrastructure (schools, hospitals, bridges etc.) and community-based projects to assist the Afghan Government in securing <b>a</b> <b>future</b> <b>for</b> its people. The task force also provided trade training to the local population and military engineering training to the Afghan National Army.|$|E
25|$|The Calder and Hebble Canal company bought Ramsden's Canal on 1 January 1945, in an {{agreement}} with the London, Midland and Scottish Railway company. They paid £4,000 which included a short length of the Narrow Canal, and the rest of that canal was abandoned. The canal was used to carry coal to a power station, and was used by some 80 barges each month. Along with most of the operating British canals, it was nationalised on 1 January 1948. The coal traffic ended in October 1953, and was the last commercial traffic to use the canal. With the passing of the Transport Act 1962 responsibility passed from the British Transport Commission to British Waterways. Under the terms of the Transport Act 1968, the canal was classified as a cruiseway, meaning that it had <b>a</b> <b>future</b> <b>for</b> leisure use. In 2012, responsibility passed to the Canal and River Trust.|$|E

25|$|There is, moreover, {{significant}} political complexity to be treated, {{more than enough}} to complicate any consideration of individual culpability: it is imperative to note that some Social Democrats viewed the National Socialists {{as an alternative to the}} Christian Social Party and later Vaterländische Front in the context of reunification with Germany; for example, Karl Renner, a chancellor who served in both the First (1919–33) and Second (post-1945) Austrian Republics, favored a German Anschluss as an alternative to the then Austrofascist regime, under which Berg, Webern, and the Social Democrats suffered. And Webern's professional circle in Vienna included, besides many Jews, many Social Democrats; for example, for David Josef Bach, a close friend of Schoenberg's as well, Webern conducted many workers' and amateur ensembles. Under the Nazis, some Social Democrats expected, there might be more work and protections for workers and laborers, as well as other social reforms and political stability, if not democracy; Webern may well have hoped to again be able to conduct and to be better able to secure <b>a</b> <b>future</b> <b>for</b> his family.|$|E

With the help of her new tenant and friend, Patrick Lockhart, Jennifer begins looking forward to a new life with Abby and the baby.
