40|$|AbstractThe mouse macrophage-derived {{apoptosis}} inhibitor of macrophage (<b>AIM),</b> {{which is}} incorporated into adipocytes and induces lipolysis by suppressing fatty acid synthase (FAS) activity, possesses three potential N-glycosylation sites. Inactivation of N-glycosylation sites revealed that mouse <b>AIM</b> contains two N-glycans {{in the first}} and second scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domains, and that depletion of N-glycans decreased <b>AIM</b> secretion from producing cells. Interestingly, the lack of N-glycans increased <b>AIM</b> lipolytic activity through enhancing <b>AIM</b> incorporation into adipocytes. Although human <b>AIM</b> contains no N-glycan, attachment of N-glycans increased <b>AIM</b> secretion. Thus, the N-glycosylation plays important roles in the secretion and lipolytic function of <b>AIM.</b> Structured summary of protein interactionsAIM physically interacts with FAS by anti tag coimmunoprecipitation (View interaction...|$|R
