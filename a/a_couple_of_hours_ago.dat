If it ever felt a fire before, it's as much as ever it did; for it's sitting in the old Lodge chimney, staring at ours as if its ravenous eyes would never shut again. It's sitting there, at least," [...] said Mr. William, correcting himself, on reflection, [...] "unless it's bolted!" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was then}} close on two o'clock of an unusually bleak November afternoon. The winds of Heaven, which of a truth do oft use the isle of Thanet as a meeting place, wherein {{to discuss the}} {{mischief}} which they severally intend to accomplish in sundry quarters later on, had been exceptionally active this day. The southwesterly hurricane had brought, a deluge of rain with it <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago,</b> then--satisfied with this prowess--had handed the downpour over to his brother of the northeast, who breathing on it with his icy breath, had soon converted it into sleet: whereupon {{he turned his back}} on the mainland altogether, and wandered out towards the ocean, determined to worry the deep-sea fishermen who were out with their nets: but not before he had deputed his brother of the northeast to marshal his army of snow-laden cloud on the firmament.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{trademark}} of Sam is his {{ability as a}} speechwriter. He is an extremely talented writer, {{one of the very}} few people Toby recognizes as an equal in his field. Sam is seen in many episodes to rewrite speeches over and over, unwilling to put words in the President's mouth that he isn't completely satisfied with. After a pipe bomb explodes at a university in [...] "20 Hours in America, Part II", killing 44 people, including three swimmers, Bartlet gives a speech, written by Sam, that includes the following: [...] "... More than any time in recent history, America's destiny is not of our own choosing. We did not seek nor did we provoke an assault on our freedoms and our way of life. We did not expect nor did we invite a confrontation with evil. Yet the true measure of a people's strength is how they rise to master that moment when it does arrive. Forty-four people were killed <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago</b> at Kennison State University; three swimmers from the men's team were killed and two others are in critical condition; when after having heard the explosion from their practice facility they ran into the fire to help get people out ... ran 'into' the fire. The streets of heaven are too crowded with angels tonight. They're our students and our teachers and our parents and our friends. The streets of heaven are too crowded with angels, but every time we think we have measured our capacity to meet a challenge, we look up and we're reminded that that capacity may well be limitless. This is a time for American heroes. We will do what is hard. We will achieve what is great. This is a time for American heroes and we reach for the stars. God bless their memory, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America." [...] Bartlet campaign advisor Bruno Gianelli asks Sam when he wrote the last part. He replies, [...] "in the car", which prompts the response, [...] "Freak".|$|E
5000|$|A {{multiplayer}} beta for Uncharted 3 began worldwide on June 28, 2011, {{with early}} access for PlayStation Plus members and all buyers of specially marked copies of Infamous 2. The beta launched for all PSN members on July 5. The multiplayer beta allow for Team Deathmatch, Three-Team Deathmatch, Team Objective, Free For All, Plunder, Hardcore, Co-op Hunter, Co-op Arena and Co-op Adventure modes. Two maps were accessible first, Chateau and Airstrip, but two more maps were unlocked {{over the course}} of the beta, Yemen and Syria. At launch, players were experiencing console freezes, game-breaking glitches, lagging issues and long connecting times. Naughty Dog released the first patch for the multiplayer beta on June 29, 2011, titled version 1.01. However, some gamers still reported that their PlayStation 3 was still getting locked completely and required a hard reboot. Naughty Dog wrote on Twitter:"We have found a problem with matchmaking <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago</b> and a fix is on its way. Today will be a better day. Thanks for your support :)"On July 5, Naughty Dog released the second patch, titled version 1.02, which included some significant improvements and tweaks. In the update, aside from inclusions such as Facebook integration and 1080i upscaling, a number of in-game elements such as medals and power plays were altered for a more balanced online experience. On July 6, Naughty Dog released the third patch 1.03 in Europe and it should have fixed any European connectivity issues. Naughty Dog's Co-President, Christophe Balestra wrote on Twitter:"Okay... I just pushed #uncharted3 beta patch 1.03 in Europe which should eliminate the matchmaking problems."Naughty Dog released the fourth patch, titled version 1.04 on July 8, which fixed issues related to the Facebook, the XP and cash during playback of cinema files. On July 8, Naughty Dog revealed that just one day after the beta went fully public on July 5, it passed the one million unique player mark in the Uncharted 3 multiplayer beta and the player count was still growing. Naughty Dog also advised players to reap the rewards from the beta, such as the Uncharted 3 PSN Beta Tester Avatar and Treasure Hunter's Starter Pack, along with in-game cash for the full release of the Uncharted 3 multiplayer component. Naughty Dog confirmed on July 12, that player progress in the Uncharted 3 multiplayer beta has been reset for some, sending them back to level one. User data that keeps track of level, cash and unlocks cannot be retrieved by the studio. However, beta players who were looking forward to rewards in the final version of Uncharted 3 based on their multiplayer beta play history will still get those rewards. Naughty Dog's Christophe Balestra announced on Twitter that the Uncharted 3 beta had reached 1.5 million unique players. On July 14, when the beta actual should have been ended, Naughty Dog extended the beta for an additional 24 hours, to give players a little more time to level up the multiplayer stats. On July 15, Sony announced that the beta for Uncharted 3 is the [...] "LARGEST online beta ever to appear on the PlayStation 3".|$|E

The mechanic says there are some minor transmission problems, which he'll fix while you wait.

After an hour you poke your head into the garage and ask what's going on, and the mechanic tells you he's {{right on top of}} the problem and is almost finished. After two more hours you storm out and find a maze of parts scattered all around and the mechanic thumbing through a repair manual and looking perplexed. You ask him what he's doing, and he says he thinks he needs to replace the torque converter but he's not sure where it is and the diagram in the book is no help. Seriously worried now, you ask him if he's really a trained mechanic, and he says that actually he's not- he's a body repairman- but the shop policy is that everybody is supposed to work on everything and if you'll just have patience he'll figure it out sooner or later [...] . and while he's got your hood up he might just have a look at a couple of valves that seem like they're about to go.
