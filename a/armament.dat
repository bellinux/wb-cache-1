5|$|Dreadnoughts {{also carried}} lighter weapons. Many early dreadnoughts carried a {{secondary}} <b>armament</b> of very light guns designed {{to fend off}} enemy torpedo boats. The calibre and weight of secondary <b>armament</b> tended to increase, as the range of torpedoes and the staying power of the destroyers expected to carry them also increased. From the end of World War I onwards, battleships had to be equipped with many light guns as anti-aircraft <b>armament.</b>|$|E

Noot for the 19 April 1940 design {{does not give}} any <b>armament</b> specifics, as these likely remained unaltered from the earlier 16 February 1940 drawing. This drawing provided the following: a main <b>armament</b> of nine 283mm guns, a secondary <b>armament</b> of twelve 120mm dual purpose guns, and an anti-aircraft defense consisting of fourteen Bofors 40mmguns and eight Oerlikon 20mmcannons.|$|E

5|$|In 1937 eight /75 caliber AA guns in two quadruple mounts {{were added}} to improve the light AA <b>armament.</b> The ships were more {{extensively}} refitted with large amounts of light AA guns {{at the expense of}} the 5-inch/51 caliber guns in 1942, as the attack on Pearl Harbor had shown pre-war light AA <b>armament</b> to be inadequate. The 1.1 inch quad mounts were removed and 24 Bofors 40 mm guns were added in six quadruple mounts (later increased to 40 guns), while 42 Oerlikon 20 mm guns in single mounts were also added. The 3-inch AA gun <b>armament</b> was increased to 10 guns, while the 5-inch gun <b>armament</b> was reduced to 6 guns.|$|E
50|$|The Independent European Program Group (IEPG) was {{established}} as a forum for <b>armaments</b> cooperation in 1976 {{with the aim of}} creating a European <b>Armaments</b> Agency.

Its membership reached 19 in 2000: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and the United Kingdom.

5|$|In early 1942, the Mahan-class destroyers began {{a wartime}} <b>armament</b> {{refitting}} process, {{but most of}} the class was not fully refitted until 1944. The notable refits to the Mahan class included the removal of one 5-inch/38 gun, typically replaced with two twin Bofors 40 mm guns (1.6in) and between four and six 20 mm Oerlikon (0.9in) guns to increase the ships' light anti-aircraft (AA) <b>armament.</b>|$|E
5|$|The IJN {{made several}} {{changes to the}} ship as she was repaired. Her {{fighting}} top was removed and her boilers were replaced by 16 Miyabara water-tube boilers. She retained her main guns, but their breeches were replaced by Japanese-built ones. Her secondary <b>armament</b> of eight 152 mm guns in twin turrets were retained, while her four casemated 152 mm guns were replaced by six Japanese-built 15 cm/45 41st Year Type guns; her light <b>armament</b> was revised to ten QF 12-pounder 12 cwt and four 37mm guns. Four 18-inch above-water torpedo tubes replaced her original torpedo <b>armament.</b> Her crew now numbered 668 officers and crewmen.|$|E
5|$|The {{contracts}} {{for the class}} were awarded on 20 and 21 July, respectively. Without armor or <b>armament,</b> South Carolina would cost $3,540,000, while Michigan would come in at $3,585,000. With armor and <b>armament,</b> the ships cost about $7,000,000 each.|$|E

Only an {{aircraft}} currently in production {{could be used}} to satisfy the extremely tight deadline and the Pe-2 was selected for modification by the State Commissariat for Defence (—NKO) as the fastest twin-engined aircraft in service. The order only authorized four days to modify the aircraft's fuel, <b>armament</b> and radio systems, but this deadline was met when the modified aircraft made its first flight on 7 August and it passed its manufacturer's trials the following day.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the war Rossia {{returned}} to Kronstadt where she underwent a three-year refit that strengthened her <b>armament.</b> She was fitted with mine rails in 1914 and laid one minefield during World War I that damaged two German light cruisers. She was reconstructed beginning in late 1915 to further strengthen her <b>armament,</b> but played no part during the rest of the war as her crew became involved in revolutionary activities in 1917. She was taken over by the Bolsheviks in late 1917, but was put into reserve in 1918 and sold for scrap in 1922.|$|E
5|$|Both North Carolina and Washington, {{designed}} {{prior to}} radar, were originally fitted with many fire-control and navigational optical range-finders. The former lasted until 1944, {{when it was}} replaced by a Mark 27 microwave radar—though it was supplemented by a Mark 3 main <b>armament</b> fire control radar. The range-finders were removed in favor of additional 20mm guns sometime between the end of 1941 and mid-1942. In addition, the ships were commissioned with two Mark 38 directors and were originally fitted with a CXAM air search, two Mark 3s and three Mark 4 secondary <b>armament.</b>|$|E

40|$|Culminating in the {{creation}} in 2004 of the European Defence Agency (EDA), the post-Cold War development of European <b>armaments</b> organizations has impressed social scientists and policymakers alike as a momentous development. However, their theoretical diversity, prior analyses of <b>armaments</b> organizations err in their focus on recent organizations of a European character. The narrow focus on institutions tied to the EU has led scholars to neglect the long-term and incremental dynamics driving the development of <b>armaments</b> organizations on both a transatlantic and European basis. In fact, European states' participation in international <b>armaments</b> organizations is neither a recent phenomenon nor one that has historically been distinctly rooted in broader processes of European integration. By examining the development of European and transatlantic <b>armaments</b> organizations prior to the EDA, this article sheds new light on how this domain of international organization emerged {{and is likely to}} develop. Abstracting from the prior evolution of <b>armaments</b> organizations, this field is likely to continue to evolve along polycentric lines, with intergovernmentalism, rather than 'Europeanization' and 'Brusselization' remaining the motive forces for future change...|$|R

The upper deck had twenty-four 60-pounder guns and two long 36-pounder chase guns. Two 3-pood shell guns were mounted fore and aft on revolving platforms. In 1862 her <b>armament</b> was revised and two 60-pounder and the two long 36-pounder guns on her upper deck were removed. Four years later, it was rearranged with two 60-pounders moved from her upper deck to the lower deck and two long 36-pounders moved from the lower deck to the upper deck.|$|E
