Her audience expected [...] soul artists to have been born in poverty and have had a rough and painful life in order to sing soul music because of how emotional it is. People also expected someone with <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>like</b> Stone's to be black.|$|E

To contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions, Christie sometimes showed [...] "foreigners" [...] as victims or potential victims at the hands of English malefactors, such as, respectively, Olga Seminoff (Hallowe'en Party) and Katrina Reiger (in the short story [...] "How Does Your Garden Grow?"). Jewish characters are often seen as un-English (such as Oliver Manders in Three Act Tragedy), but they are rarely the culprits.|$|E

He holds seven stars in his right hand and has a double-edged sword coming out of his mouth. The vision is also notable for being the only identifiable physical description of Jesus in any form in the Biblical canon.|$|E

2500|$|S. Parkes Cadman {{was born}} in Wellington, Shropshire, England, where he worked in a coal mine for ten years, {{beginning}} at age 11. A voracious reader, he read books while working in the mine, in between hauling loads of coal. He became interested in theology and began speaking at age 18 as a lay preacher in local Methodist churches. He studied at Richmond College of the University of London and at Wesley College seminary. While a seminarian in 1888, he heard Catherine Booth of the Salvation Army speak in London, recalling years later, [...] "I have not heard since anything which moved me more deeply than that remarkable address [...] [...] [...] delivered in the purest English, with faultless diction, in <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>like</b> the pealing of a silver bell across a still lake." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scott-Heron's 1971 album Pieces of a Man {{used more}} {{conventional}} song structures than the loose, spoken-word feel of Small Talk. He {{was joined by}} Jackson, Johnny Pate as conductor, Ron Carter on bass and bass guitar, drummer Bernard [...] "Pretty" [...] Purdie, Burt Jones playing electric guitar, and Hubert Laws on flute and saxophone, with Thiele producing again. Scott-Heron's third album, Free Will, was released in 1972. Jackson, Purdie, Laws, Knowles, and Saunders all returned to play on Free Will and were joined by Jerry Jemmott playing bass, David Spinozza on guitar, and Horace Ott (arranger and conductor). Carter later said about Scott-Heron's voice, [...] "He wasn't a great singer, but, with that voice, if he had whispered {{it would have been}} dynamic. It was <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>like</b> you would have for Shakespeare." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although Beckett {{refused to}} be drawn on the {{backgrounds}} of the characters, this has not stopped actors looking for their own motivation. Jean Martin had a doctor friend called Marthe Gautier, who {{was working at the}} Salpêtrière Hospital, and he said to her: [...] "'Listen, Marthe, what could I find that would provide some kind of physiological explanation for <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>like</b> the one written in the text?' [...] said: 'Well, {{it might be a good}} idea if you went to see the people who have Parkinson's disease.' So I asked her about the disease ... She explained how it begins with a trembling, which gets more and more noticeable, until later the patient can no longer speak without the voice shaking. So I said, 'That sounds exactly what I need.'" [...] "Sam and Roger were not entirely convinced by my interpretation but had no objections." [...] When he explained to Beckett that he was playing Lucky as if he were suffering from Parkinson's, Beckett said, [...] "'Yes, of course.' He mentioned briefly that his mother had had Parkinson's, but quickly moved on to another subject." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although Otis Redding {{originally}} {{wrote the}} song, Joss Stone sampled Aretha Franklin's version instead. [...] "Headturner" [...] appeared on her third album, Introducing Joss Stone in 2007. She approached her song {{by taking the}} texture and sound of Franklin's song, but keeping her own composition. Aretha's version became an icon for the feminist movement, demanding for a little respect. Stone's version also portrayed the same message, as well as expressing self-confidence {{and a little bit}} of sass. Stone was inspired and highly influenced by Aretha Franklin. She would mimic Franklin's singing style growing up. Stone has such an amazing voice that her [...] "soulful vocals have seen her described as 'the white Aretha Franklin'". In fact, Stone reached out to Franklin to sing one of her written songs and Franklin agreed to do it, but Stone believed the contract conditions were too impeding. Although, many loved Joss Stone, she did receive criticism and was questioned as a singer because of her background. Her audience expected soul artists to have been born in poverty and have had a rough and painful life in order to sing soul music because of how emotional it is; people also expected someone with <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>like</b> Stone's to be black.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2005, Hudson {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Effie White for the film {{adaptation}} of the musical Dreamgirls, which also starred Jamie Foxx, Beyoncé Knowles and Eddie Murphy. The role, originally created in a Broadway performance by Jennifer Holliday, marked Hudson's debut screen performance. She won the role over hundreds of professional singers and actresses, including Fantasia Barrino. Filming of Dreamgirls began on January 9, 2006, and the film went into limited release on December 25, 2006, and national release on January 12, 2007. Hudson has won particular praise for her show-stopping onscreen rendition of the hit song, [...] "And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going", the signature song of the role, which had earlier been recorded, and had already reached the status of musical standard, because of the definitive performance of Jennifer Holliday. The New York Observer described Hudson's performance of the song as [...] "five mellifluous, molto vibrato minutes that have suddenly catapulted Ms. Hudson... into the position of front-runner for the best supporting actress Oscar". Newsweek said that when moviegoers hear Hudson sing the song, she, [...] "is going to raise goose bumps across the land."

2500|$|Opinions {{differed}} about Fancourt's melodramatic {{style in}} his roles, especially {{his interpretation of}} his best-known role, that of the Mikado of Japan, and his famous Mikado laugh. Frederic Lloyd, who joined the D'Oyly Carte in 1951 and had studied the company's history, told an interviewer that Fancourt invented his interpretation, concerned that the earlier movements used during the Mikado's song could {{be taken as a}} Fagin-like caricature. [...] According to Lloyd, Fancourt had said that, because of his Jewish background, [...] "I just couldn't go through those movements, it would bother me", and Lloyd reported that, when Fancourt showed Rupert D'Oyly Carte and his stage director J. M. Gordon his new business for the song, they were delighted. Jessie Bond, who had played Pitti-Sing in the 1885 première, was unimpressed: [...] "Who, I want to know, intended that the Mikado should prance about like a madman, hissing out his lines like a serpent? ... The raving monster we so often see now is not one bit like the suave and oily Mikado created [...] at the Savoy." [...] The Times thought that he [...] "undoubtedly loses {{a good deal of the}} Mikado's humour... his 'humane Mikado' scene is the one which seems to have travelled farthest from the 'Savoy tradition'." [...] A later Times review commented more favourably: [...] "Mr Darrell Fancourt... can (and did) add a terrifying aspect to the benignity of his humaner punishment manifesto, and left us wondering how his vocal cords ever managed to function normally after those expressions of emphasis with which he punctuated its paragraphs." [...] The Manchester Guardian praised Fancourt's fresh approach and added, [...] "He makes more of the punishment-fitting-the-crime song than we can remember having seen from any other actor." [...] The Pall Mall Gazette said, [...] "Mr Fancourt has recognised that people can do with a 'thrill' in these Grand Guignol days. So he has given us a Mikado who really does curdle the blood, with <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> <b>like</b> a steam hammer slowly crushing a ton of Brazil nuts, and a make up of ghastly villainy, and a fiendish, gurgling laugh, which must be heard to be appreciated." [...] Another critic described the sound of Fancourt's laugh as [...] "a dragon getting up steam". With respect to Fancourt's portrayal of the Pirate King, fellow actor Henry Lytton told an interviewer, [...] "The King should be a story book pirate, not a real one and blood thirsty to boot. But that's the way Mr. Fancourt plays it".|$|E
