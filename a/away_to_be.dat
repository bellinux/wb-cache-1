5|$|Following the 1991 {{decision}} {{to build a}} new Rikshospitalet at Gaustad, it was decided to extend the Ullevål Hageby Line of the tramway there, which would pass under the Sognsvann Line. Plans called for a transfer station at Blindern, but this was later discarded in favor of a new station, Forskningsparken. It would replace Vestgrensa, which was considered too far <b>away</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a suitable transfer point. Forskningsparken would also serve {{the northern part of the}} Blindern campus. Not until 1998 were the necessary political agreements in place to allow construction to start. The new light rail started services on 1 June 1999, and the rapid transit station opened on 22 August. With the opening, Line 4 of the metro was extended from Blindern, via Forskningsparken, to Ullevål stadion. There were complaints from local residents that the increased traffic on the line was causing too much noise, and neighbors demanded that noise shields be built.|$|E
5|$|Revolt also flared in {{neighbouring}} Kent. Sir Simon de Burley, a close {{associate of}} both Edward III {{and the young}} Richard, had claimed that a man in Kent, called Robert Belling, was an escaped serf {{from one of his}} estates. Burley sent two sergeants to Gravesend, where Belling was living, to reclaim him. Gravesend's local bailiffs and Belling tried to negotiate a solution under which Burley would accept a sum of money in return for dropping his case, but this failed and Belling was taken <b>away</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> imprisoned at Rochester Castle. A furious group of local people gathered at Dartford, possibly on 5 June, to discuss the matter. From there the rebels travelled to Maidstone, where they stormed the gaol, and then onto Rochester on 6 June. Faced by the angry crowds, the constable in charge of Rochester Castle surrendered it without a fight and Belling was freed.|$|E
5|$|Villa Real was now {{surrounded}} by hostile territory, and any Spanish help {{was too far}} <b>away</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> of value. The colonists quickly ran short of food and responded by taking up arms and riding against the Indians {{in search of food}} and slaves. The Indians abandoned their towns and hid their women and children in caves. The rebellious populations concentrated themselves on easily defended mountaintops. At Quetzaltepeque a lengthy battle was fought between the Tzeltal Maya and the Spanish, resulting in the deaths of a number of Spanish as a result of rocks being cast down upon them from the mountaintop. The battle lasted various days, and the Spanish were supported by indigenous warriors from central Mexico. The battle eventually resulted in a Spanish victory, {{but the rest of the}} province of Chiapa remained rebellious.|$|E

5|$|After the Dissolution, {{two of the}} abbey's manors in Wiltshire {{were sold}} by the Crown to John Thynne and {{thereafter}} descended in his family, who much later became Marquesses of Bath. The Thynnes have preserved many of the abbey's Wiltshire records at Longleat {{up to the present}} day. The ruins of the abbey itself was stripped of lead and dressed stones hauled <b>away</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used in other buildings. The site was granted by Edward VI to Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset who established a colony of Protestant Dutch weavers on the site. When Seymour was attainted in 1551, the abbey site reverted to the crown, but the weavers remained until they were removed in the reign of Queen Mary. In 1559 Elizabeth I of England granted the site to Peter Carew, and it remained in private ownership until the beginning of the 20th century. Further stones were removed in the 17th century, so that {{by the beginning of the}} 18th century the abbey was described as a ruin. The only building to survive intact is the Abbot's Kitchen, which served as a Quaker meeting house. Early in the 19th century, gunpowder was used to dislodge further stones and the site became a quarry. The Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882 stopped further damage to the site and led to the first historical and archaeological surveys.|$|E
5|$|Clarke privately tells Warren that {{he thinks}} Elizabeth is {{innocent}} {{and that he is}} not sure that the pair are doing God's work. Warren threatens that Clarke himself will be tried and convicted if he objects further. The trial resumes—Elizabeth having been tortured overnight—and Elizabeth's mouse, Snowflake, is released, so that it might lead them to the witch. Warren has sprinkled crumbs in front of Elizabeth. When Snowflake approaches Elizabeth, Pike declares her a witch, and sentences her to be burned. Thomas and Sarah later say goodbye to a hooded and bound Elizabeth, who awaits execution. Clarke dismisses them. He removes the hood from the figure to reveal that he has bound Warren in Elizabeth's place; Clarke believes Warren has been tainted with evil, and that the latter is no longer doing God's work. Clarke puts back the hood, and Pike enters, happy that the trial has seen a revival of trade and visitors to the village. Warren is taken <b>away</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> burnt. Clarke releases the real Elizabeth, but she reveals that she truly is a witch; she breaks Clarke's neck, killing him. There are sounds of excitement from outside as flames light Elizabeth's face. She tells Snowflake that she will go to her master, then transforms into a raven and leaves.|$|E

25|$|Like {{the other}} tribes {{of the kingdom}} of Judah, the tribe of Judah is entirely absent from the ancient Song of Deborah, rather than present but {{described}} as unwilling to assist in the battle between Israelites and their enemy. Traditionally, this has been explained as being due to the southern kingdom being too far <b>away</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> involved in the battle, but Israel Finkelstein et al. claim the alternative explanation that the southern kingdom was simply an insignificant rural backwater at the time the poem was written.|$|E
25|$|By birth Jeanne was {{connected}} to Clan Forbes. The marriage {{seems to have taken}} place a few years before Clan Leslie joined with Clan Gordon in their feud against Clan Forbes. The Leslie's were supporters of Mary, Queen of Scots, Catholic pretender to the throne of England, who was imprisoned (and eventually executed) by Queen Elizabeth I and her son, the future James I of England, taken <b>away</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> raised protestant.

25|$|In March 1778, Ann {{died of an}} illness, {{possibly}} pneumonia, at Penrith. After {{the death}} of his mother in 1778, his father was inconsolable and sent his children <b>away</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> raised by their relatives. William was taken in by his mother's family and eventually sent to Hawkshead Grammar School, and Dorothy was sent to live with Elizabeth Threlkeld, Ann's cousin, in Halifax. She and William did not meet again for another nine years. Although Hawkshead was Wordsworth's first serious experience with education, he was taught to read by his mother and attended a tiny school in Cockermouth of low quality.|$|E
25|$|Coal also {{contains}} {{low levels of}} uranium, thorium, and other naturally occurring radioactive isotopes which, if released into the environment, may lead to radioactive contamination. Coal plants emit radiation {{in the form of}} radioactive fly ash, which is inhaled and ingested by neighbours, and incorporated into crops. A 1978 paper from Oak Ridge National Laboratory estimated that coal-fired power plants of that time may contribute a whole-body committed dose of 19µSv/a to their immediate neighbours in a 500 m radius. The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation's 1988 report estimated the committed dose 1km <b>away</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 20µSv/a for older plants or 1µSv/a for newer plants with improved fly ash capture, but was unable to confirm these numbers by test.|$|E
25|$|Following the war, {{no reason}} {{could be found}} not to unite the two earlier railway {{stations}} into a single building. In particular, both railways {{had come into the}} ownership of the same company, the ÖBB (Austrian federal railways). The modern Südbahnhof was built between 1955 and 1961 to plans by Heinrich Hrdlicka, in which the twin stations were united in a single building. Two underground platforms serve the S-Bahn network (lines S1, S2 and S3). At about the same time, the line between Vienna and Gloggnitz was electrified. During the re-building, the Südbahnhof was extended towards the Schweizergarten, while the constituent parts of the old main hall were numbered and taken <b>away</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used at a depot in Floridsdorf.|$|E

25|$|Yum-Yum {{is being}} {{prepared}} by her friends for her wedding ("Braid the raven hair"), after which she muses {{on her own}} beauty ("The sun whose rays"). Pitti-Sing and Peep-Bo return to remind her of the limited duration of her impending union. Joined by Nanki-Poo and Pish-Tush, they try to keep their spirits up ("Brightly dawns our wedding-day"), but soon Ko-Ko and Pooh-Bah enter to inform them of a twist in the law that states that when a married man is beheaded for flirting, his wife must be buried alive ("Here's a how-de-do"). Yum-Yum is unwilling to marry under these circumstances, and so Nanki-Poo challenges Ko-Ko to behead him on the spot. It turns out, however, that Ko-Ko has never executed anyone, not even a Blue bottle, and cannot execute Nanki-Poo, because the ex-tailor is too soft-hearted. Ko-Ko instead sends Nanki-Poo and Yum-Yum <b>away</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> wed (by Pooh-Bah, as Archbishop of Titipu), promising {{to present to the}} Mikado a false affidavit in evidence of the fictitious execution.|$|E

When coal is burned, uranium, thorium and all the uranium daughters accumulated by disintegration— radium, radon, polonium— are released. Radioactive materials previously buried underground in coal deposits are released as fly ash or, if fly ash is captured, may be incorporated into concrete manufactured with fly ash.|$|E
25|$|Corsica {{had been}} {{controlled}} by the Genoese since 1284 when they established their supremacy over the Pisans in the naval Battle of Meloria. Towards {{the end of the}} 15th century the Ottoman Turks expanded their control of the Mediterranean westwards and became a dominant maritime power in the region. In 1480 they sacked Otranto in southern Italy and in 1516 they took control of Algiers. In {{the first decades of the}} 16th century Turkish corsairs in galleys and fustas often rowed by Christian slaves began attacking villages around the Corsican coastline. Many hundreds of villagers were captured and taken <b>away</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sold as slaves. The Genoese Republic responded by building a series of towers around the coastline. Most were built to a similar circular design with a roof terrace protected by machicolations. Nearly one hundred were constructed before the Genoese decided in around 1620 that they were unable to defend the island and abandoned the building program.|$|E
