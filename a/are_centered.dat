Episodes 204 and 205 <b>are</b> <b>centered</b> on a soccer match developed by the Kasumiōji Soul Reapers who appeared in season 9.|$|E
5|$|Any initial two {{disjoint}} given circles can {{be rendered}} concentric as follows. The radical {{axis of the}} two given circles is constructed; choosing two arbitrary points P and Q on this radical axis, two circles can be constructed that <b>are</b> <b>centered</b> on P and Q and that intersect the two given circles orthogonally. These two constructed circles intersect each other in two points. Inversion in one such intersection point F renders the constructed circles into straight lines emanating from F and the two given circles into concentric circles, with the third given circle becoming another circle (in general). This follows because the system of circles is equivalent {{to a set of}} Apollonian circles, forming a bipolar coordinate system.|$|E

5|$|As {{the player}} {{progresses}} through the {{different levels of}} the game, the city viewed through the apartment window in the level selection screen gradually becomes more vibrant and colorful. If the player triggers three secret flowers in each level, the cityscape is replaced with a bright field with mountains in the background. The music changes in scope as the game progresses, growing in scale and complexity and adding to the narrative arc. The credits level is played {{in a similar manner}} to the main levels, but as the player flies through each flower the name of a person involved in the game appears above it. Flower includes PlayStation Network trophies in keeping with the game's feel. While some are objective-based, many <b>are</b> <b>centered</b> on relaxing and watching the scenery.|$|E
5|$|Miyamoto {{initially}} intended Ocarina of Time to {{be played}} in a first-person perspective to enable players {{to take in the}} vast terrain of Hyrule Field better, as well as to be able to focus more on developing enemies and environments. This concept was overridden once {{the idea of having a}} child Link was introduced, and Miyamoto believed it necessary for Link to be visible on screen. Ocarina of Time originally ran on the same engine as Super Mario 64, but was so heavily modified that designer Shigeru Miyamoto considers the final products entirely different engines. One major difference between the two is camera control; the player has a lot of control over the camera in Super Mario 64, but the camera in Ocarina of Time is largely controlled by the game's AI. Miyamoto says the camera controls for Ocarina of Time are intended to reflect a focus on the game's world, whereas those of Super Mario 64 <b>are</b> <b>centered</b> on the character of Mario.|$|E
5|$|SR522, named Lake City Way within Seattle city limits, {{begins at}} an {{interchange}} with I-5 in the Roosevelt neighborhood of northern Seattle, east of Green Lake. The interchange only allows movements south towards Downtown Seattle on I-5, {{and includes a}} connection to the freeway's reversible express lane system. The highway travels northeast from the interchange, tunneling under the intersection of Roosevelt Way NE and NE 75th Street; the intersection itself is connected to SR522 by a series of ramps to collector streets. Lake City Way continues northeast through Maple Leaf as a four-lane arterial street before turning north on its approach to Thornton Creek. After crossing the creek, the highway enters the Lake City neighborhood, passing several car dealerships. Lake City itself is a designated urban village, with mixed-use development and apartment buildings that <b>are</b> <b>centered</b> around the intersection of Lake City Way between NE 125th Street and NE 145th Street. At NE 145th Street, SR522 intersects SR523 and crosses into Lake Forest Park.|$|E
