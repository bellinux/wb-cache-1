40|$|A novel {{silicon-on-insulator}} (SOI) microdosimeter {{has been}} designed and fabricated using planar processing techniques to realise a device with a micron-scale well-defined sensitive volume. Cylindrical structures were employed to allow for an improved definition of the average chord length of the sensitive volume over that of previous elongated parallelepiped solid-state detector designs. The structures were manufactured on individual silicon mesas situated {{on top of a}} buried oxide insulating layer. The mesa design eliminated lateral charge diffusion. Two kinds of test structures were designed with sensitive region widths of 2 mum and 10 mum. In addition, an array of 900 cylindrical diodes was fabricated to increase the charge collection statistics. TCAD (Technology Computer Aided Design) modeling of the electrostatic potential and electric field profile of the cylindrical microdosimeter was carried out to obtain 3 D potential and electric field profiles.
