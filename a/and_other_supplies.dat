5|$|After several {{damaging}} air attacks, {{the naval}} surface combatants from both America and Japan {{withdrew from the}} battle area without either side securing a clear victory. However, the U.S. and its allies gained tactical and strategic advantage. Japan's losses were greater and included dozens of aircraft and their experienced aircrews. Also, Japanese reinforcements intended for Guadalcanal were delayed and eventually delivered by warships rather than transport ships, giving the Allies more {{time to prepare for}} the Japanese counteroffensive and preventing the Japanese from landing heavy artillery, ammunition, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>supplies.</b>|$|E
5|$|After several false {{starts in}} early September, the Continental Army {{established}} a siege around Fort St. Jean. Beset by illness, bad weather, and logistical problems, they established mortar batteries that {{were able to}} penetrate into the interior the fort, but the defenders, who were well-supplied with munitions, but not food <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>supplies,</b> persisted in their defence, believing the siege would be broken by forces from Montreal under General Guy Carleton. On October 18, the nearby Fort Chambly fell, and on October 30, an attempt at relief by Carleton was thwarted. When word of this {{made its way to}} St. Jean's defenders, combined with a new battery opening fire on the fort, the fort's defenders capitulated, surrendering on November 3.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{constant}} bombing sorties, Potez 25 and Breguet 19 aircraft {{were also}} used for daily supply missions to the besieged army garrison at Rogatica.

On 23 March, a ZNDH Potez 25 was shot down by the Partisans and the crew were killed. Three days later an Avia Fokker F.9 was damaged whilst dropping ammunition to Rogatica but managed to return to base safely. As {{a result of the}} determined re-supply effort by the ZNDH, the Rogatica garrison succeeded in holding out until relieved by German-NDH forces on 17 April.|$|E

5|$|Baum's {{detachment}} was a mixed {{force of}} 700 composed primarily of Hessians but also including {{small amounts of}} dismounted Brunswick dragoons, Canadians, Loyalists, and Indians.

After a rain-caused standoff, Stark's men enveloped Baum's position, taking many prisoners, and killing Baum. Reinforcements for both sides arrived as Stark and his men were mopping up, and the battle restarted, with Warner and Stark driving away Breymann's reinforcements with heavy casualties.|$|E
5|$|Britain's hold on Gibraltar was {{reconfirmed}} in 1729 by the Treaty of Seville, which satisfied neither side; the Spanish {{had wanted}} Gibraltar returned, while the British disliked {{the continuation of}} the restrictions imposed by the Treaty of Utrecht. Spain responded the following year by constructing a line of fortifications across {{the upper end of the}} peninsula, cutting off Gibraltar from its hinterland. The fortifications, known to the British as the Spanish Lines, and to Spain as La Línea de Contravalación (the Lines of Contravallation), were later to give their name to the modern town of La Línea de la Concepción. Gibraltar was effectively blockaded by land but was able to rely on trade with Morocco for food <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>supplies.</b>|$|E
5|$|Congressional {{reaction}} to the losses suffered by Lt. Col.

Materially, the AFL–CIO established the Polish Workers Aid Fund. By 1981 it had raised almost $300,000, which was used to purchase printing presses and office supplies.
