And I will never, ever forget how he stopped almost as if he was suspended like a marionette. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> 'I remember the kind of dresses she used to wear. They were old and faded and gray.' And then he walked some more. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> 'I remember how she was always bent over the stove, trying to stretch what little we had.' And that was the beginning, that night, of his walk. And he walked that floor until just about daybreak.|$|E
5|$|As an {{opponent}} of the Vietnam War, Bedell signed a petition urging against United States military intervention in Iraq. This petition was signed {{with the names of}} 70 former Congressmen from the 1970s and was presented in a press conference on March 15, 2003. Bedell said that it was unbelievable for the United States to settle disputes with war, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> that an Iraq war would be similar to the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 38, Home retired due to ill health; the tuberculosis, {{from which}} he had {{suffered}} {{for much of his}} life, was advancing <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> his powers were failing.

5|$|I {{was playing}} the nice girl. It's really hard to play. All the other {{characters}} came from somebody and I said to Mike , 'Where do I come from?' <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> 'You were the fantasy girl.'

5|$|Invites to Golden League meets never materialised, but he {{continued}} to run at smaller events. He ran a European leading time of 10.06seconds at Papaflessia in Greece, and won the 100m and 200m races at the 2009 European Team Championships. He was the fastest entrant at the national championships but 2008 runner-up Simeon Williamson won the final by some distance. The result took Chambers by surprise <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> that limited opportunities to race had made him complacent. He later withdrew from the 200m race citing exhaustion.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} his {{lifetime}} the Linnean collection in Uppsala was considered one of the finest collections of natural history objects in Sweden. Next to his own collection he had also built up a museum for the university of Uppsala, which was supplied by material donated by Carl Gyllenborg (in 1744–1745), crown-prince Adolf Fredrik (in 1745), Erik Petreus (in 1746), Claes Grill (in 1746), Magnus Lagerström (in 1748 and 1750) and Jonas Alströmer (in 1749). The relation between the museum and the private collection was not formalised and the steady flow of material from Linnean pupils were incorporated to the private collection rather than to the museum. Linnaeus felt his work was reflecting the harmony of nature <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> in 1754 'the earth is then nothing else but a museum of the all-wise creator's masterpieces, divided into three chambers'. He had turned his own estate into a microcosm of that 'world museum'.|$|E

5|$|Auden began {{summering}} in Europe, {{together with}} Chester Kallman, in 1948, first in Ischia, Italy, where he rented a house, then, starting in 1958, in Kirchstetten, Austria, where {{he bought a}} farmhouse from the prize money of the Premio Feltrinelli awarded to him in 1957, <b>and,</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> shed tears of joy at owning {{a home for the}} first time. In 1956–61, Auden was Professor of Poetry at Oxford University where he was required to give three lectures each year. This fairly light workload allowed him to continue to winter in New York, where he lived at 77 St. Mark's Place in Manhattan's East Village, and to summer in Europe, spending only three weeks each year lecturing in Oxford. He earned his income mostly from readings and lecture tours, and by writing for The New Yorker, The New York Review of Books, and other magazines.|$|E
5|$|On 13 July 1999, Kouao took Climbié to Cameron's house, {{asking her}} to take Climbié {{permanently}} because Manning did not want her. Cameron refused but agreed to take her for the night. Cameron, her son Patrick, and her daughter Avril, observed that Climbié had numerous injuries—including a burn {{on her face and}} a loose piece of skin hanging from her right eyelid—which Kouao said was self-inflicted. Manning's account in the subsequent inquiry differed <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> that he hit Climbié because of her incontinence, beginning with slaps, but progressing to using his fist by the end of July. It was highly likely {{that at least some of}} the injuries were the result of deliberate physical harm.|$|E
5|$|Speaker {{guided the}} 1920 Indians {{to their first}} World Series win. In a crucial late season game against the second-place White Sox, Speaker caught a hard line drive hit to deep right-center field by Shoeless Joe Jackson, ending the game. On a dead run, Speaker leaped with both feet off the ground, snaring the ball before {{crashing}} into a concrete wall. As he lay unconscious from the impact, Speaker still held the baseball. In the 1920 World Series against Brooklyn, Speaker hit an RBI triple in the deciding game, which the Indians won 3–0. Cleveland's 1920 season was also significant due {{to the death of}} Ray Chapman on August 17. Chapman died after being hit in the head by a pitch from Carl Mays. Chapman had been asked about retirement before the season, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> that he wanted to help Speaker earn Cleveland's first World Series victory before thinking of retirement.|$|E

5|$|The first {{sport to}} {{interest}} Bolt was cricket, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> {{if he was}} not a sprinter, he would be a fast bowler instead. As a child, he was a supporter of the Pakistani cricket team and admired the bowling of Waqar Younis. He is also a fan of Indian batsman Sachin Tendulkar, West Indian opener Chris Gayle, and Australian opener Matthew Hayden. During a charity cricket match, Bolt clean-bowled Gayle who was complimentary of Bolt's pace and swing. Bolt also struck a six off Gayle's bowling. Another bowler complimentary of Bolt's pace was former West Indies fast-bowling great Curtly Ambrose.|$|E

25|$|In 1964, {{archaeologist}} Kwang-chih Chang {{said that}} {{it seemed like the}} Mongoloid race originated in South China, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> that it seemed like the Mongoloid race was differentiating itself from other races in the Late Pleistocene. Chang based these thoughts on a skull found in Sichuan and a skull found in Guangxi.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the first}} series, series two {{contained}} {{a great deal}} of studio filming. Chibnall said this was because of the changed nature of the story, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> that nearly all the major story moments in the second series occurred on a stage. David Tennant said that while the Jurassic Coast and several locations from series one are still featured in series two, most shooting occurred on studio sets near London.|$|E

25|$|Two {{days prior}} to the execution, a letter written by Saddam {{appeared}} on the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party website. In the letter, he urged the Iraqi people to unite, and not to hate the people of countries that invaded Iraq, like the United States, but instead the decision-makers. He said {{he was ready to}} die as a martyr <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> that this is his death sentence.
