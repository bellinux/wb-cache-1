A spherically symmetric simulation is one-dimensional, while an axially symmetric simulation is two dimensional.

Nor was he less a master of parliamentary tactics and of those sudden changes and movements in debate which, as in a battle, sometimes change the fortune of the day. His confidence in himself, and {{in the majority of}} the chamber which he had moulded to his will, was unbounded; and long success and the habit of authority led him to forget that in <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>like</b> France there was a people outside the chamber elected by a small constituency, to which the minister and the king himself were held responsible.|$|E
25|$|This {{could be}} a reason why {{environmental}} Kuznets curves {{have been found to}} be applicable to only certain types of pollutants. Yandle et al. argue that the EKC has not been found to apply to carbon because most pollutants create localized problems like lead and sulfur, so there is a greater urgency and response to cleaning up such pollutants. As a country develops, the marginal value of cleaning up such pollutants makes a large direct improvement to the quality of citizens' lives. Conversely, reducing carbon dioxide emissions does not have a dramatic impact at a local level, so the impetus to clean them up is only for the altruistic reason of improving the global environment. This becomes a tragedy of the commons where it is most efficient for everyone to pollute and for no one to clean up, and everyone is worse as a result (Hardin, 1968). Thus, even in <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>like</b> the US with a high level of income, carbon emissions are not decreasing in accordance with the EKC.|$|E

On a visit to Coburg, he refused to attend the marriage of Victoria's granddaughter Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, because her father, Victoria's son Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, assigned him a seat in the gallery with the servants. Confronted by the opposition of her family and retainers, the Queen defended her favourite. She wrote to her private secretary Sir Henry Ponsonby: [...] "to make out that the poor good Munshi is so low is really outrageous & in <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>like</b> England quite out of place...

Theodore Sedgwick of Massachusetts expressed this sentiment by declaring that it is [...] "a chimerical idea to suppose that <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>like</b> this could ever be enslaved ...

2500|$|There {{are three}} systems of social {{stratification}} {{which are the}} caste system, estates system, [...] and class system.

For example, in <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>like</b> India and Philippines person born in a poor family, they are supposed to remain poor also in their entire lifetime. The houses they live and the states they come from are the visible indicators. The stratification may be superior or inferior and thus influences the occupation and the social roles assigned to a person. Estate system is a state or society where individuals in this state were required to work on their land to receive some services like military protection, proper houses. Communities ranked according to the nobility of their lords. The class system is about income inequality and socio-political status. People can move the classes when they increase their level of income or if they have authority. People are expected to maximize their innate abilities and possessions. Social stratification characteristics include its universal, social, ancient, it’s in diverse forms and also consequential.|$|E

[...] Muti, breaking with opera protocol and the strict conventions of composer Verdi himself, turned to the audience and delivered a small speech, referring to the severe budget cuts announced by the Berlusconi government which would particularly affect the funding of the arts. He spoke of the need to keep culture alive in Italy, prompted, as he later stated, by the belief that [...] "killing culture in <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>like</b> Italy is a crime against society. Culture is the spiritual glue that holds a people together." [...] He then invited the audience to participate in an encore of the [...] "Va, pensiero" [...] chorus – the invitation and the encore also a break from tradition for an opera performance. The opera audience stood up and sang along with the on-stage chorus. Muti recalls that [...] "80 percent of the audience knew the lyrics" [...] and sang along, while [...] "some members of the chorus were in tears." ...|$|E

[...] And what do our brothers do? [...] Exactly the opposite!

[...] Our brothers indeed were right when they said that the Arab only respects he who exhibits bravery and courage. [...] But when these people feel that the law is on their rival's side and, even more so, if they are right to think their rival's actions are unjust and oppressive, then, even if they are silent and endlessly reserved, they keep their anger in their hearts.

2500|$|Stalin {{claimed to}} be a loyal Leninist. Nevertheless, he was—according to Service—"not a blindly obedient Leninist". Stalin {{respected}} Lenin, but not uncritically, and spoke out when he believed that Lenin was wrong. During the period of his revolutionary activity, Stalin regarded some of Lenin's views and actions as being the self-indulgent activities of a spoiled émigré, deeming them counterproductive for those Bolshevik activists based within the Russian Empire itself. After the October Revolution, they continued to have differences. Whereas Lenin believed that all countries across Europe and Asia would readily unite as a single state following proletariat revolution, Stalin argued that national pride would prevent this, and that different socialist states would have to be formed; in his view, <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>like</b> Germany would not readily submit to being part of a Russian-dominated federal state. Stalin biographer Oleg Khlevniuk nevertheless believed that the pair developed a [...] "strong bond" [...] over the years, and after Lenin's death, Stalin relied heavily on Lenin's writings—far more so than those of Marx and Engels—to guide him in the affairs of state. Stalin adopted the Leninist view on the need for a revolutionary vanguard who could lead the proletariat rather than being led by them. Leading this vanguard, he believed that the Soviet peoples needed a strong, central figure—akin to a Tsar—whom they could rally around. He read about, and admired, two Tsars in particular: Ivan the Terrible and Peter the Great.|$|E
2500|$|Since the 2006 (79th) Academy Awards, {{submitted}} films {{no longer}} have to be in an official language of the submitting country. This requirement had previously prevented countries from submitting films where the majority of the dialogue was spoken in a language that was non-native to the submitting country, and the Academy's executive director explicitly cited as a reason for the rule change the case of the Italian film Private (2004), which was disqualified simply because its main spoken languages were Arabic and Hebrew, neither of which are indigenous languages of Italy. This rule change enabled <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>like</b> Canada to receive a nomination for a Hindi-language film, Water. Previously, Canada had been nominated for French-language films only, since films shot in Canada's other official language (English) were ineligible for consideration for the Foreign Language Film category. Before the rule change, Canada had submitted two films in different languages—the invented-language film A Bullet in the Head in 1991 and the Inuktitut language film [...] in 2001. Inuktitut, one of the country's aboriginal languages, is not official throughout Canada, but was (and still is) official in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories. Neither film earned a nomination. The rule change, however, did not affect the eligibility of non-English speaking American films, which are still disqualified from the Foreign Language Film category due to their nationality. Because of this, a Japanese-language film like Letters from Iwo Jima (2006) or a Mayan-language film like Apocalypto (2006) were unable to compete for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, even though they were both nominated for (and, in the case of Letters from Iwo Jima, won) the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film, which does not have similar nationality restrictions. The nationality restrictions also differ from the practice of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) for their analogous award for Best Film Not in the English Language. While BAFTA Award eligibility requires a commercial release in the United Kingdom, that body does not impose a nationality restriction.|$|E
