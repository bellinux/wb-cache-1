40|$|The basic {{optimization}} problem of road design is quite challenging due to <b>a</b> <b>objective</b> function {{that is the}} sum of nonsmooth functions and the presence of set constraints. In this paper, we model and solve this problem by employing the Douglas-Rachford splitting algorithm. This requires a careful study of new proximity operators related to minimizing area and to the stadium norm. We compare our algorithm to a state-of-the-art projection algorithm. Our numerical results illustrate the potential of this algorithm to significantly reduce cost in road design...|$|E

FCM algorithm is {{the improvement of}} K-means algorithm. In change detection problem, FCM algorithm is a soft partition for changed and unchanged class. The idea of FCM is that make the object in the same cluster have the largest similarity and least similarity between different clusters. The algorithm iteratively minimizes <b>a</b> <b>objective</b> function which depends on the pixels to the cluster centers in the feature domain.|$|E
