5|$|<b>A</b> <b>moderately</b> strong {{hurricane}} with {{winds of}} 105mph (165km/h) was first spotted on October 6 east of Jamaica. Passing {{a short distance}} south of the island, the hurricane tracked northwestward and brushed the Yucatán Peninsula before turning north-northeastward into the Gulf of Mexico. Late on October 9, it made landfall a short distance east of Apalachicola, Florida at peak winds with an estimated pressure of 969mbar. Rapidly weakening to tropical storm status, the cyclone continued northeastward and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from North Carolina on October 11. Later that day, it was last observed about 250mi (400km) southeast of Cape Cod.|$|E
5|$|An area of {{convection}} {{acquired a}} closed circulation and became Tropical Depression One-C on August 22. It stayed disorganized {{for the next}} several days. It organized more fully and intensified into a tropical storm on August 25 and was named Alika. After peaking as <b>a</b> <b>moderately</b> strong tropical storm on August 25, wind shear caused by the pre-Ele tropical depression and an upper-level low near Hawaii weakened the storm to a depression on August 27. Alika dissipated the next day, having never threatened land.|$|E

5|$|By 1500UTC on September 27, the National Hurricane Center {{declared}} Bonnie extratropical, {{since it}} was losing tropical characteristics. Bonnie re-acquired tropical characteristics, and the National Hurricane Center resumed advisories on the storm by 2100UTC on September 28. However, post-analysis indicated that Bonnie remained tropical during that time period. Bonnie re-strengthened to a strong tropical storm before vertical wind shear weakened it while approaching the Azores. Shortly before becoming extratropical on September 30, Bonnie passed through the Azores as <b>a</b> <b>moderately</b> weak tropical storm. One location in the Azores reported tropical storm force winds. In addition, one man {{was killed by a}} rock fall on the island of São Miguel. No damage was reported in association with Bonnie.|$|E

He fought in the Mexican–American War (1846–1848), as the colonel of a volunteer regiment. Before the American Civil War, he operated a large cotton plantation in Mississippi and owned as many as 74 slaves. Although he argued against secession in 1858, he believed states had an unquestionable right to leave the Union.|$|E
5|$|Europium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Eu and atomic number 63. It was isolated in 1901 and {{is named after}} the continent of Europe. It is <b>a</b> <b>moderately</b> hard, silvery metal which readily oxidizes in air and water. Being a typical member of the lanthanide series, europium usually assumes the oxidation state +3, but the oxidation state +2 is also common. All europium compounds with oxidation state +2 are slightly reducing. Europium has no significant biological role and is relatively non-toxic compared to other heavy metals. Most applications of europium exploit the phosphorescence of europium compounds. Europium {{is one of the}} least abundant elements in the universe; only about % of all matter in the universe is europium.|$|E
