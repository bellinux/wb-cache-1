5000|$|Along {{with the}} rebrand {{of the league}} in 2013, the league made the {{decision}} to change the uniforms. Before, the uniforms in the Lingerie Football League consisted of an <b>athletic</b> <b>bra</b> and underwear that were more revealing than protective. The uniforms had lace and ribbons and the athletes all had to wear garter belts. The league traded these uniforms in for [...] "performance wear." [...] The league felt like the uniforms were too heavy on sex appeal. In accordance with the name change, they thought it was appropriate to also change the uniforms. The new uniforms resemble the uniforms worn by volleyball players.|$|E

5000|$|The bra's main {{components}} are a chest band that wraps around the torso, two cups, and shoulder straps. The chest band is usually {{closed in the}} back by a hook and eye fastener, but may be fastened at the front. Sleep <b>bras</b> or <b>athletic</b> <b>bras</b> do not have fasteners and are pulled on over the head and breasts. The section between the cups is called a gore. The section under the armpit where the band joins the cups is called the [...] "back wing".|$|R
