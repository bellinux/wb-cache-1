500|$|After {{recording}} the song at Cosmos Studios and Kinglet Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, the band felt relieved {{to have a}} song that they were happy to release as their debut single. Band member Liam Payne called the song [...] "perfect", and Harry Styles said, [...] "When we were recording in the studio we knew instantly that we wanted this track to be our first single." [...] Styles spoke to MTV News, [...] "I think for us we wanted to release something that wasn't cheesy but it was fun.

[...] Payne added, [...] "We always wanted [...] to be something that people didn't expect <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> heard it, it wasn't what we expected either so it kind of fitted perfectly." ...|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from the}} {{occasional}} performance of [...] "Everything Must Go," [...] {{none of the}} album's songs have been played live since 2010. In the same year, Lazzara answered questions on his Formspring account, commenting that New Again [...] "was a gigantic step backwards" [...] {{and that he was}} [...] "not fully satisfied with what we put out". In 2012, Reyes said of New Again: [...] "I didn't like how we had to constantly change producers and the songwriting didn't turn out originally as it was, it just kind of bummed us out a bit." [...] Discussing New Again in 2016, Rubano called the period [...] "the golden time where I was like 'oh, we're doing music, that we all really like, that we can't wait to get out' and things were going pretty good for a little while". However, when the album was released, the [...] "critics seemed to like it, but it didn't really hit , <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> started the touring cycle for it there was a very decisive mood turn in a band that already was insanely moody all the time".|$|E

It leaves you guessing, and the movie still works with 20 minutes gone out of it.' I thought, 'Oh, my God, that's what we’ve got to do. We've got to have a missing reel!' I'm going to use it in a way where it actually says 'missing reel' for 10 seconds, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> come back, you're arriving in the third act.

2500|$|Closing track, [...] "Tomorrow's Food", was {{the first}} song written for the album. Einziger stated that the song was {{conceived}} in 2009 with Lee Hartney from The Smith Street Band and [...] "was written {{at a time when}} I didn’t know whether or not {{we were going to go}} back and start working on new music for a new album. I’d been off at Harvard for a while and Brandon was really focusing on painting and for a little while there we didn’t have all that much communication. I just sort of wrote that guitar part, the chord progression and the changes and stuff and Brandon just sort of responded to it. We kind of just put it aside <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> started working on new music for this album, I think we always knew that we wanted to record it in the studio and make it really great.

2500|$|The song's melody {{grew out}} of some {{unstructured}} jamming on 7 January 1969 during rehearsal sessions on the sound stage at Twickenham Studios. Over the next few minutes, McCartney introduced some of the lyrics, reworking [...] "Get back to the place you should be" [...] from fellow Beatle George Harrison's [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] into [...] "Get back to where you once belonged". McCartney had played bass on Jackie Lomax's recording of [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] a few months earlier. On 9 January McCartney brought a more developed version of [...] "Get Back" [...] to the group, with the [...] "Sweet Loretta" [...] verse close to its finished version. For the press release to promote the [...] "Get Back" [...] single, McCartney wrote, [...] "We {{were sitting in the}} studio and we made it up out of thin air... we started to write words there <b>and</b> <b>then...</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> finished it, we recorded it at Apple Studios and made it into a song to roller-coast by." ...|$|E

As the expected revenue stream from continuing with honest communication increases with their ability, high ability sellers remain honest while low ability sellers find it too costly and sometimes lie about quality for short-term gain. Thus, cheap-talk communication facilitates the market's learning of a seller's ability and strengthens reputation effects. We study this new reputation mechanism and the induced market dynamics, first when sellers cannot restart {{with a new}} identity <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> they can. <b>We</b> extend the analysis to various other situations such as voluntary refund and moral hazard. ...|$|R

40|$|Social {{development}} of Muslim society in Indonesia {{related to the}} study of hadith seems quite dynamic. Each organization has its own characteristics in defining and positioning hadith as the second of Islamic authority after Qur 2 ̆ 7 an, such as the Majlis Tafsir Al-Qur 2 ̆ 7 an (MTA). The problem begun since there is a research mentioning that MTA is almost considered not positioning hadith as explanatory of Qur 2 ̆ 7 an. It is dealing with the MTA jargon its self, returning to the Qur 2 ̆ 7 an and sunnah shahihah. This article discusses about how MTA, which is currently led by Ahmad Sukino, positions the hadith as the second of Islamic authority after Qur 2 ̆ 7 an. In addition, MTA states that only sunah shahihah can be used as dalil or hujjah. MTA also distinguishes human cultural behaviors with pure religious behaviors as they are generally called ‘ibadah. Thus, for MTA, no ‘ibadah except there is nash sharih, both from the Qur 2 ̆ 7 an <b>and</b> sunnah. <b>Then,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> read more deeply and critically, MTA is actually inconsistent in understanding and practicing Islam textually, but sometimes they use the fikih and usul fikih as a means to analyse the Qur 2 ̆ 7 an and hadith...|$|R
