5|$|McCudden's {{fortunes}} {{changed in}} the new year. He dispatched a two-seater on 26 January and another on 2 February 1917. On 5 February he attacked a <b>Albatros</b> C.III returning from a photo-reconnaissance mission. Diving {{out of the sun}} to blind the gunner, he shot it down over the frontline where it was shelled by British artillery. Ten days later he engaged an <b>Albatros</b> escorted by a LFG Roland C.II. After a brief dogfight and pursuit, the <b>Albatros</b> escaped but he destroyed the Roland which crashed near Monchy. Twenty-four hours later McCudden was awarded the Military Cross for his fifth victory. His award was gazetted on 12 March.|$|E
5|$|At some point, a rednosed <b>Albatros</b> D.V made a {{short-lived}} attempt to help Voss; Rhys-Davids {{put a bullet}} through its engine, and it dropped away.|$|E
5|$|McCudden did not score {{again during}} the year but had a {{remarkable}} escape on 27 December 1916. Flying from Arras to Monchy on patrol, his flight of six DH.2s engaged an enemy formation of <b>Albatros</b> D.IIs. McCudden rushed {{to the aid of}} Alexander James, a member of his flight, who had been attacked by a German fighter. He attacked the <b>Albatros</b> head-on but his gun jammed after 20 shots. As he fought to clear the jam he found himself amid a number of German fighters.|$|E
5|$|On 23 April 1917, Ball {{was under}} strict orders to stay over British lines, but still engaged the Germans {{five times in}} his Nieuport. In his first combat that day, using his {{preferred}} belly shot, he sent an <b>Albatros</b> into a spin, following it down and continuing to fire at it until it struck the ground. It was No.56 Squadron's first victory. Regaining an altitude of , he tried to dive underneath an <b>Albatros</b> two-seater and pop up under its belly as usual, but he overshot, and the German rear gunner put a burst of 15 bullets through the Nieuport's wings and spars. Ball coaxed the Nieuport home for repairs, returning to battle in an S.E.5. In his third combat of the day, he fired five rounds before his machine gun jammed. After landing to clear the gun, he took off once more, surprising five <b>Albatros</b> fighters and sending one down in flames. His fifth battle, shortly thereafter, appeared inconclusive, as the enemy plane managed to land safely. However, its observer had been mortally wounded.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{also shows}} his taste for aircraft: a gyrocopter—Little Nellie—features in You Only Live Twice, a Cessna 185 Seaplane in Licence to Kill, an Acrostar Jet in Octopussy, the Space Shuttle in Moonraker and an Aero L-39 <b>Albatros</b> in Tomorrow Never Dies.|$|E
5|$|Like the French, the German air {{services}} used {{a variety}} of disruptive camouflage patterns until April 1917, when lozenge camouflage was introduced; it used up to five colors. German aircraft were however sometimes painted in deliberately conspicuous colors, like the bright red of Manfred von Richthofen's <b>Albatros</b> D.III, advertising the pilot's prowess to intimidate the enemy.|$|E
5|$|The Sukhoi Su-28 (also {{designated}} Su-25UT – Uchebno-Trenirovochnyy) is {{an advanced}} basic jet trainer, {{built on the}} basis of the Su-25UB as a private initiative by the Sukhoi Design Bureau. The Su-28 is a light aircraft designed to replace the Czechoslovak Aero L-39 <b>Albatros.</b> Unlike the basic Su-25UB, it lacks a weapons-control system, built-in cannon, weapons hardpoints, and engine armour.|$|E
5|$|In June {{he joined}} No. 66 Squadron RFC at Aire, {{equipped}} with the Sopwith Pup. He undertook a refresher course but his tenure there was unremarkable. He was ordered to fly with the group rather than fly solo patrols. He flew 47 hours in 66 Squadron and 21 patrols. He encountered the enemy six times but could not score. Finally on 21 and 26 July he shot down one <b>Albatros</b> D.V fighter for his 6–7th aerial victories.|$|E
5|$|MI6 sends James Bond, agent 007, {{into the}} field to spy on a {{terrorist}} arms bazaar on the Russian border. Despite M's insistence on letting 007 finish his reconnaissance, British Admiral Roebuck orders the frigate HMS Chester to launch a missile attack on the arms bazaar. Bond then discovers two nuclear torpedoes mounted on an L-39 <b>Albatros,</b> and as the missile is too far along to be aborted, 007 hijacks the L-39 and flies away seconds before the bazaar is destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Voss was bequeathed an <b>Albatros</b> D.III in the squadron's insignia. During {{his brief}} spell with Jasta 5, Voss scored a further half dozen victories. However, {{he was not}} always successful; {{he was one of}} the three German fighters who {{attacked}} and seriously damaged Captain Keith Caldwell of 60 Squadron on 28 May 1917, just after Voss's 31st victory, but the wily New Zealander escaped.|$|E
5|$|As {{an active}} civil airfield, {{operations}} at Duxford are {{regulated by the}} Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). In 2002 a privately operated Aero L-39 <b>Albatros</b> suffered a braking failure on landing, overran the runway and {{came to rest on}} the M11 motorway, a student pilot being killed after ejecting at ground level. An Air Accidents Investigation Branch inquiry recommended a review of arrangements for aircraft taking off or landing towards the M11. As a result, the CAA and Duxford agreed to a reduction in the runway's 1500m declared length, from 1350m to 1200m, in order to provide a greater margin of error.|$|E
5|$|Holden {{claimed his}} first aerial victory while No.2 Squadron was still flying DH.5s, before it began {{converting}} to Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5s in December 1917. On 18 February 1918, he shared {{in one of}} the unit's first two victories in the S.E.5, helping send an <b>Albatros</b> down in a spin. He claimed another three aircraft shot down over the following month, giving him a total of five victories. At least one of these took place during the Spring Offensive, on 22 March, when all available Allied aircraft were thrown into battle to stem the German advance.|$|E
5|$|On 18 August 1917 McCudden scored {{his first}} victory as an {{official}} member of 56 Squadron over an <b>Albatros</b> D.V. Another the following day and two on 20 August raised his tally from 7 to 11 victories. He was pleased with his success but berated the armourers for the frequent gun-stoppages. Over the next four weeks his machine suffered engine difficulties and gun-jams. He could only claim damaged enemy aircraft and once suffered a galling experience when the DFW C.V reconnaissance he was attacking holed his engine while his guns jammed. It had to be sent for major repairs. He received a new fighter, B4863, which then became his regular mount.|$|E
5|$|On 8 June he {{made his}} first {{official}} observer qualifying sortie which he passed. At this time the German Luftstreitkräfte (Air Service) introduced the Fokker Eindecker fighter equipped with Synchronization gear. Firing through the propeller, the Germans had a machine that soon became a serious threat to McCudden's unit. The enemy succeeded establishing a period of air superiority at this time. McCudden still flew regularly as an observer with the new commanding Officer, Edgar Ludlow-Hewitt, who had taken over command on 20 November 1915. He recorded a flight of 2 hours 40 minutes on the 27 November which included an abortive chase after a <b>Albatros</b> C.I reconnaissance aircraft. On 16 December 1915 he acted as aerial gunner, when he drove off an attack on his flight by the German ace Max Immelmann. While firing at the Fokker, McCudden witnessed a piece of paper or fabric fall off the German machine. Although the ground was diligently searched, no trace of it was found. On 19 January 1916, McCudden exchanged fire with another German observer without result.|$|E
5|$|On the German {{side of the}} lines, Voss {{had changed}} clothing. He wore a {{colourful}} civilian silk dress shirt beneath his unbuttoned knee-length brown leather coat. His polished brown boots shone from below the coat's hem. His Pour le Mérite was at his throat. He was to lead {{one of the two}} scheduled afternoon patrols. Leutnant Gustav Bellen was his righthand wingman; Leutnant Friedrich Rüdenberg had Voss's other side. After takeoff at 18:05 hours, Voss, with his new Fokker Triplane, advanced its throttle and soon outdistanced his two wingmen flying slower Pfalz D.IIIs. A few minutes later, Oberleutnant Ernst Weigand in <b>Albatros</b> D.V number 1187/17 led a second flight skyward; three Pfalz D.IIIs followed him, piloted by Leutnants Erich Löwenhardt, Alois Heldmann, and Max Kuhn. None of the Jasta 10 aircraft would ever catch their Staffelführer.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{record of}} the reflector sight being used with fighter aircraft was in 1918. The optical firm of Optische Anstalt Oigee of Berlin, working from the Grubb patents, developed 2 versions {{what came to be}} known as the Oigee Reflector Sight. Both used a 45 degree angle glass beam splitter and electrical illumination and were used to aim the plane's machine guns. One version was used in operational trials on the <b>Albatros</b> D.Va fighter biplane and Fokker Dr.1 fighter triplane. There was some interest in this sight after World War I but reflector sights in general were not widely adopted for fighter and bomber aircraft until the 1930s, first by the French, then by most other major airforces. These sights were not only used for aiming fighter aircraft, they were used with aircraft defensive guns and in bombsights.|$|E
5|$|Three days later, on 26 April, Ball scored another double victory, flying S.E.5 no.A4850, and {{one more}} on 28 April. This last day's {{fighting}} left the S.E.5 so battered by enemy action that it was dismantled and sent away for repair. The following month, despite continual problems with jamming guns in the S.E.5s, Ball shot down seven Albatroses in five days, including two reconnaissance models on 1 May, a reconnaissance plane and an <b>Albatros</b> D.III fighter on 2 May; a D.III on 4 May, and two D.IIIs the next day, 5 May. The second of these victims nearly rammed Ball as they shot {{it out in a}} head-on firing pass. As they sped past one another, Ball was left temporarily blinded by oil spraying from the holed oil tank of his craft. Clearing the oil from his eyes, he flew his S.E.5 home with zero oil pressure in an engine on the brink of seizure. He was so overwrought that it was some time after landing before he could finish thanking God, then dictating his combat report.|$|E
5|$|Voss, an avid motorcyclist, had {{a love of}} {{machinery}} {{that led him to}} consort with his enlisted mechanics, Karl Timms and Christian Rueser; he was even on a first name basis with them. In time, they would transfer squadrons to accompany him. Voss contravened uniform regulations at times and could often be found in the hangar working on his machine beside the mechanics, dressed in a grubby jacket without insignia. His care extended to his craft's exterior; he adorned his <b>Albatros</b> D.III with both a swastika and a heart for good luck. And although he was a casual dresser around his home airfield, when flying he would be well-dressed with a silk shirt beneath his aviation gear. He joked {{that he wanted to be}} presentable to the girls of Paris if he were captured; however, the shirt's silk collar protected his neck from chafing while he swivelled his head about watching for other aircraft during flight.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Albatros</b> C.IV was a German {{military}} {{reconnaissance aircraft}} {{built in the}} autumn of 1915 by <b>Albatros</b> Flugzeugwerke. It was a single-engined biplane, and was based on the <b>Albatros</b> C.III, with which it shared many parts. It was eventually abandoned, in favour of the C.V.|$|E
25|$|He {{began by}} driving down an <b>Albatros</b> {{two-seater}} reconnaissance plane over Passchendaele on 25 September 1917. The next day, he destroyed an <b>Albatros</b> D.III {{in the same}} vicinity.|$|E
25|$|Three days later, while flying another <b>Albatros</b> {{he fought}} eight English fighters and took {{multiple}} machine gun hits. With his wings breaking up he {{still managed to}} land, though the <b>Albatros</b> flipped over and was totally destroyed.|$|E
25|$|Pilot Stackard {{scored a}} double kill on the {{afternoon}} of 11 September 1917 from his Sopwith Camel (B3863). He destroyed two <b>Albatros</b> D.V aircraft over Leke, West Flanders, one in flames. He shared both kills with Joseph Fall and Arthur Wood. His tenth victory occurred on 13 September 1917, when he sent another <b>Albatros</b> D.V out of control east of Leke. It was shared with Flight Sub-Lieutenant Stearne Edwards. He scored another double victory on 24 September 1917 from Sopwith Camel (B3883). First, he sent an <b>Albatros</b> D.III out of control over Leke, shared with Joseph Fall and Arthur Wood. Then, he drove an <b>Albatros</b> D.V out of control over Middelkerke.|$|E
25|$|Jasta 34 {{was founded}} with <b>Albatros</b> D.IIIs, on 20 February 1917. By 6 March 1918, they were {{operating}} <b>Albatros</b> D.V and <b>Albatros</b> D.Va fighters. The following month, on 10 April, they received Fokker Dr.I triplanes and Pfalz D.IIIs. On 15 June 1918, they took Fokker D.VIIs on strength. Near {{the end of}} August, they also received some Pfalz D.XIIs. The unit's aircraft markings featured white or silver tails and rear fuselages.|$|E
25|$|Hilborn {{would not}} score his fifth victory until 18 July 1918. At 0807 hours, he {{destroyed}} an <b>Albatros</b> D.III over Stoccareddo. Eleven days later at 0740 hours, he would score his final triumph with 66 Squadron, destroying one more <b>Albatros</b> D.III, over Feltre.|$|E
25|$|Cunningham scored {{again on}} 5 February 1918, when he {{destroyed}} an <b>Albatros</b> D.V over Beythem. On 12 March, he destroyed an <b>Albatros</b> over Westrozebeke, Belgium. Five days later, he destroyed another over Zuidhoek. He destroyed another one east of Demuin, France on 3 April 1918.|$|E
25|$|Naval 4 then {{upgraded}} to Sopwith Camels. Chadwick would first score {{with one of}} them on 25 June, when he flambeed an <b>Albatros</b> recon two-seater over Roulers. On 3 July 1917, he drove down a German recon machine over Ghistelles. Three days later, he would share in the destruction of an <b>Albatros</b> two-seater in the same area. On a 10 July evening patrol, he drove down an <b>Albatros</b> D.V, then aided Ronald M. Keirstead to drive down a second one. Chadwick was now a Camel ace.|$|E
25|$|Second Lieutenant Kemp and Lieutenant Thomson {{were cut}} off from their patrol and {{attacked}} by four enemy planes on 1 June 1918. Thomson turned and fired 200 rounds into an <b>Albatros</b> D.V, which crashed. Observer Kemp shot down another over Comines. They were then attacked by an <b>Albatros</b> scout from above. During that encounter, Kemp, age 20, was fatally wounded. Pilot Thomson spun down to 2,000 feet, and then turned and fired upon the <b>Albatros,</b> driving it off. Thomson successfully flew his aircraft home.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Albatros</b> D.I was a German fighter {{aircraft}} {{used during}} World War I. Although its operational career was short, {{it was the}} first of the <b>Albatros</b> D types which equipped the bulk of the German and Austrian fighter squadrons (Jagdstaffeln) for the last two years of the war.|$|E
25|$|On 1 May 1918 at 0850 hours, Hilborn scored {{his first}} aerial victory over Fonzano, Italy; he set an Austro-Hungarian <b>Albatros</b> D.III afire with {{a burst of}} machine gun fire at 14,000 feet for his first kill. The <b>Albatros</b> {{plummeted}} about 1,000 feet before it came apart. Three days later, Hilborn {{was one of a}} flight of four Sopwith Camel pilots who tackled a formation of 14 enemy fighters at 0945 hours. Hilborn destroyed another <b>Albatros</b> D.III, this time over Conegliano. On 11 May 1918 at 1050 hours, while flying as a wingman for famed ace William George Barker, Hilborn destroyed a third <b>Albatros</b> over Torre di Mosto. At noon on 20 May, again flying as Barker's wingman, the young British Columbian destroyed an Austro-Hungarian Berg D.I over Fontane, Italy.|$|E
25|$|As the new <b>Albatros</b> fighters {{came into}} service the Halberstadts were quickly replaced, {{although}} a few survived into early 1917. Manfred von Richthofen flew a red Halberstadt D.II {{for a few weeks}} in February and March 1917, after the spar of the lower wing of his <b>Albatros</b> D.III cracked in combat.|$|E
25|$|The Dawn Princess {{was renamed}} <b>Albatros</b> after the sale to V-Ships {{and she was}} {{chartered}} to Phoenix Reisen, a German travel/cruise company, initially for five years from 27 March 1993 onwards. On 18 August 1993 the <b>Albatros</b> set on her first cruise for Phoenix Reisen from Germany to North Cape, Norway.|$|E
25|$|He would score once more, on 16 June 1917. His final tally included: an <b>Albatros</b> D.III {{destroyed}} singlehanded; {{two more}} D.IIIs destroyed in victories shared with other aircrews; a two-seater reconnaissance plane and four D.IIIs singlehandedly driven {{down out of}} control; two <b>Albatros</b> D.IIIs driven down and shared with other aircrews.|$|E
25|$|On 9 May 1918, {{observer}} Kemp {{and pilot}} Thomson, in Bristol F.2b (C4851) {{were cut off}} from their formation by an <b>Albatros</b> D.V. Kemp emptied a drum into the <b>Albatros</b> which side-slipped and nose-dived, and was destroyed, crashing between Comines and Wervicq. This was Kemp's first victory. His next four were all from Bristol (C859). On 14 May 1918, Kemp scored his second aerial victory. He and his pilot followed an <b>Albatros</b> D.V down to 4,000 feet and fired about 100 rounds at it over the Wervicq and Zillebeke, West Flanders. The enemy plane crashed and the crew was captured. While on a patrol with other Bristol Fighters on 17 May 1918, Kemp and Thomson engaged a formation of enemy aircraft. They dived on an <b>Albatros</b> D.V, and fired a burst of about 200 rounds into it. It went down in a vertical dive and was destroyed, crashing between Armentières and Lille. Kemp scored a double victory that day, as another <b>Albatros</b> D.V was sent out of control over Armentières. On 18 May 1918, Kemp scored his fifth victory when a Pfalz D.III was sent out of control south of Merville, Nord.|$|E
25|$|Original {{equipment}} upon foundation {{was four}} Fokker E.IVs, two <b>Albatros</b> D.IIs, two Fokker D.IIs, and a Halberstadt D.II. Later in the war, during the Summer of 1918, the unit operated <b>Albatros</b> D.Vs, Pfalz D.IIIs, Fokker D.VIIs, Fokker Dr.I triplanes, {{and a few}} Fokker D.VIIIs. The triplanes often had their cowlings painted black, with white facing.|$|E
25|$|A Saroléa <b>Albatros</b> is {{on display}} at Old Warden in the Shuttleworth Collection.|$|E
