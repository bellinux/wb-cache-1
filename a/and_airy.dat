5|$|The Hotel Valley Ho is a {{striking}} example of the mid-century modern architectural style. Varney's use of masonry, cast and poured concrete, natural stone, and wide expanses of glass make for a close connection between the building and its environment. Stone floor and wall patterns link the exterior entry and the lobby, as does {{the extension of the}} redwood ceiling. The hotel is now considered one of the finest examples of organic architecture. Rooms in the two adjacent wings added in the late 1950s are unusual, and remarkably forward-thinking even by mid-century design standards, for their high nine-foot-ceilings. The prevailing trend at the time of original construction was low-ceilinged rooms, in some cases with ceilings only seven feet above ground level, but the Valley Ho's rooms feel exceptionally roomy <b>and</b> <b>airy</b> thanks to its original decision to buck design trends.|$|E

It is {{designed}} {{in the form of a}} , with a trellis pattern on the ceiling which is reflected in the design of the marquetry floor (illustrated below), giving the impression of being in a pergola rather than an interior. The marquetry floors of the private rooms distinguish these smaller more intimate rooms from the larger state rooms where such delicate features would have been damaged by more frequent use. The walls of the boudoir are heavily mirrored and contain overdoor and mirror carouches by José Conrado Rosa. Next to the boudoir is the Queen's bedroom; it was from this light <b>and</b> <b>airy</b> room that the demented shrieks of the Queen were reported by William Beckford, who visited the palace in 1794.|$|E

25|$|Each saloon had 64 seats, {{arranged}} in eight bays of four around a table, {{either side of}} a central gangway, with two toilets situated in the vestibule at one end. The interior was finished in laminated plastics, creating a light <b>and</b> <b>airy</b> feel. They were fitted with a public address system, double-glazed windows and central fluorescent lighting along their length, the first coaches in Ireland to be so treated. Heating was by steam, supplied from a Steam Heating Van.|$|E

The fittings were made of oak and she was furnished with spring beds.|$|E
25|$|The Minster {{was built}} {{by the city of}} Bern {{as a symbol of the}} growing power of this city-state.

The Gothic style allowed a taller central nave and larger windows than had been possible before, creating an impressive and (for the time) light <b>and</b> <b>airy</b> structure.|$|E

25|$|The {{fashion for}} disguising the service wings led to feats of {{architectural}} engineering. In the country, where space was more available, the wings were hidden behind screens of trees, shrubs and grassy banks as at Waddesdon Manor and Mentmore Towers. While the rooms within were light <b>and</b> <b>airy,</b> the wings were often designed to have windows {{facing away from}} the principal areas {{of the house and}} its gardens. In towns where space was limited the servants fared less well, with their daytime, and sometimes sleeping, quarters in the basement.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} arts that are {{native to the}} Nashi People, such as the rarely seen Nashi {{handmade}} embroidery, Dongba painting, Dongba wooden carving and so on. Much of the wood carving that characterizes Nashi houses are made by Bai craftsmen today. Absorbing architectural styles of the Han, Nashi houses are built in a standard Han style of one courtyard with one, two, three or four buildings around it, sometimes with linked adjoining courtyards. The mud brick and wood structures at first sight {{have been described as}} crude and simple in appearance, but a closer inspection reveals elaborate and delicate patterns on casements and doors, elegant pillars and pillar supports, and a very comfortable <b>and</b> <b>airy</b> living environment.|$|E
25|$|Stone Roof, {{a private}} {{residence}} in Nagano, Japan, built in 2010, {{consists of a}} roof which is meant to spring from the ground, providing a complete enclosure to the home. A local stone was chosen to intimately relate itself to the preexisting natural environment of the mountain side. The exterior stone work is made light <b>and</b> <b>airy</b> by cutting each stone into thin slices and bracing each slice as a pivoting panel. In this way, the heavy quality of stone is diluted and provides the eye with an illusion of lightness, allowing light and air directly into the space within. With this choice of material and construction, {{a new kind of}} transparency emerges; one that not only frames nature the way a glass curtain wall would, but also deeply relates itself to the mountain side.|$|E
40|$|Since {{the dawn}} of {{telescopic}} astronomy astronomers have observed and measured the "spurious" telescopic disks of stars, generally reporting that brighter stars have larger disks than fainter stars. Early observers such as Galileo Galilei interpreted these disks as being the physical bodies of stars; later observers such as William Herschel understood them to be spurious; some, such as Christian Huygens, argued that stars show no disks at all. In the early 19 th century George B. Airy produced a theoretical explanation of star images sufficient to explain all historical observations, but astronomers were slow to fully recognize this. Even today conventional wisdom concerning stars and telescopes stands at odds to both historical observations <b>and</b> <b>Airy's</b> theory. We give {{a detailed analysis of}} both historical observations <b>and</b> <b>Airy's</b> theory, illustrating how Airy's theory explains the historical observations, from Galileo to Huygens to Herschel. We argue that the observations themselves appear in all cases to be valid and worth further study.

25|$|From {{the summit}} of Carl Side a system of ridges descends southward towards Millbeck. The main spur runs {{straight}} for a mile, the first half being of gentler gradient and culminating in a large patch of white stones at about 1,600ft. There is a very short rocky arête here, before the spur falls abruptly to the valley floor. On {{the eastern side of}} this section are the crags of Doups. The southern ridge sends out shorter branches on either side, just above the patch of white stones. On the western side across the rocky col of Long Doors is Dodd, a fell on Forestry Commission land that is largely wooded. To the east is Carlsleddam, a steep sided spur that appears sharply peaked from below: though less inspiring close up it does have a narrow <b>and</b> <b>airy</b> summit ridge.|$|E
25|$|Although Kent {{intended}} the First Lord {{to use this}} space as his study, it has rarely served that purpose; it has almost always been the Cabinet room. There {{have been a few}} exceptions. Stanley Baldwin used the Cabinet Room as his office. A few Prime Ministers, such as Tony Blair, occasionally worked at the Cabinet Room table. Painted off-white with large floor to ceiling windows along one of the long walls, the room is light <b>and</b> <b>airy.</b> Three brass chandeliers hang from the high ceiling. The Cabinet table, purchased during the Gladstone era, dominates the room. The modern boat-shaped top, introduced by Harold Macmillan in the late 1950s, is supported by huge original oak legs. The table is surrounded by carved, solid mahogany chairs that also date from the Gladstone era. The Prime Minister's chair, the only one with arms, is situated midway along one side in front of the marble fireplace, facing the windows; when not in use, it is positioned at an angle for easy access. The only picture in the room is a copy of a portrait of Sir Robert Walpole by Jean-Baptiste van Loo hanging over the fireplace. Each Cabinet member is allocated a chair based on order of seniority. Blotters inscribed with their titles mark their places.|$|E
