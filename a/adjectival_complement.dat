The findings reveal that Mongolian only tolerates inherent resultatives; derived resultatives are ruled out. The acceptability of <b>adjectival</b> <b>complements</b> in inherent resultatives runs from 'Totally open-scale/Totally closed-scale' down to 'Lower closed/Upper closed-scale'. On the other hand, <b>adjectival</b> <b>complements</b> in direct perception expressions are of no diverse acceptability, i. e. all layers of APs are licensed. Furthermore, durative verbs are likely to yield open-scale APs whilst punctual verbs seem to favour closed-scale APs...|$|R

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} role of the {{accessibility}} of subjects in the development of <b>adjectival</b> <b>complement</b> constructions, such as it is important to honour those who have done honour to us (CB). Throughout history, these mandative constructions have patterned with both that- and to-complements, whose distribution changed over time. It is shown that, from the rise of the to-clauses {{at the expense of the}} that-clauses in Middle English onwards, these two types of complement start to differ in terms of accessibility, with to-clauses attracting subjects with more accessible subjects. Accessibility of subjects may therefore have promoted the rise of the to-infinitive. However, this general trend is strongly reversed in the Modern English period, for which constructional, informational and stylistic factors are invoked. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This book revisits {{the notion}} of deontic {{modality}} {{from the perspective of}} an understudied category in the modal domain, viz. adjectives. On the basis of synchronic and diachronic corpus studies, it analyses the semantics of English adjectives like essential and appropriate, and uses this to refine traditional definitions of deontic modality, which are mainly based on the study of modal verbs. In a first step, it is shown that the set of meanings expressed by extraposition constructions with deontic adjectives {{is quite different from the}} set of meanings identified in the literature on modal verbs. <b>Adjectival</b> <b>complement</b> constructions lack the directive meanings of obligation or permission, which are traditionally regarded as the core deontic categories, and they have semantic extensions towards non-modal meanings in the evaluative domain. In a second step, the analysis of adjectives is used to propose an alternative definition of deontic modality, which covers both the meanings of verbs and adjectives, and which can deal with the different extensions towards modal and non-modal categories. This is integrated into a conceptual map, which works both in diachrony, defining pathways of change from premodal to modal to evaluative meaning, and in synchrony, accommodating refinements within each set of meanings. In the process, this study points to the emergence of partially filled constructions, and it offers additional evidence for well-established changes in the history of English, such as the decline of the subjunctive and the rise of the to-infinitive in complement constructions. This monograph is of particular interest to researchers and graduate students with a focus on mood and modality, and the interface between syntax, semantics and pragmatics, as well as that between synchrony and diachrony. nrpages: XX, 363 status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 In this {{dissertation}} I set out {{to solve}} a series of puzzles related {{to the notion of}} a DP periphery, defined as an area around the edge of a given domain targeted by operations such as movement and agreement. In solving these puzzles, I argue for a peripheral area in the nominal domain. Early arguments for a peripheral boundary in the nominal domain are found in the justifications for a functional D {{as the head of the}} noun phrase (Abney, 1987; Szabolcsi, 1987, 1994; Horrocks & Stavrou, 1985). More recently, the nominal domain has been argued to contain a peripheral area on the basis of CP/DP parallelisms (Giusti, 1996; Aboh, 2004). Here I am minimally concerned with proposing functional projections as parallels to other domains; rather, I make use of DP-particular projections [...] such as DP and NumP [...] to account for the three puzzles I present. I present the first puzzle in chapter 2 : the licensing conditions for nominal ellipsis and nominal gapping in English and in French (Lobeck, 1995; Sleeman, 1996; Jackendoff, 1971; Yoshida, Wang, & Potter, 2012). I argue for a unified analysis of these phenomena, the mechanics of which serve as the functional basis for the remaining arguments in this dissertation. I propose a system of feature agreement, which I call Mutual Agree, in which nominal ellipsis is licensed when a higher, licensing head agrees with a lower, ellipsis head. Mutual Agree not only accounts for all instances of nominal ellipsis and gapping in English and French, but it also restricts the ellipsis mechanism to only license ellipsis in appropriate contexts. The second puzzle I consider (chapter 3) is the functional structure of phrases that undergo degree inversion (Matushansky, 2002; Den Dikken, 2006; Troseth, 2009). The main goals of the chapter are twofold. First I argue for an analysis of degree inversions that derives the interpretive parallels between simple degree inversion constructions and those with complex post-degree structure. I follow Troseth's (2009) proposal that degree inversions are derived via predicate inversion and then propose that the degree phrase predicates of these inversion constructions are complex, relative-like clauses. Second I argue that the variable ordering patterns found in degree inversions can be given a simple syntactic account if we assume that some degree words can take a null complement as opposed to an overt <b>adjectival</b> <b>complement.</b> The features that are involved in Mutual Agree also play a role in degree inversion; I specifically argue that the feature of contrastive focus is what causes the movement of a predicative degree phrase out of the small clause configuration and to a prenominal position. The final puzzle I present (chapter 4) explores the possibility of island `repair' under nominal ellipsis (for discussions of repair in the clausal domain, see Ross, 1967, and Merchant, 2001). I first show that the system of Mutual Agree accounts for why certain elements, but not others, may escape nominal ellipsis in order to be candidates for island repair. I demonstrate that apparent repair of DP-internal island violations occurs in certain nominal ellipsis scenarios. I argue that this occasional repair is due to the fact that repair is only an illusion (Barros, Elliot, & Thoms, 2014, 2015). Repair effects are the result of the ellipsis site potentially containing a non-island-violating construction; this ambiguity results in acceptance of the ellipsis-containing structure. I conclude in chapter 5 by returning to what the three preceding chapters reveal about the function of projections in DP. I argue that the combination of (i) evidence from ellipses, (ii) evidence from ellipsis escape, and (iii) evidence from non-elliptical movement reveal what appears to be an articulated, albeit small, periphery of sorts...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a reevaluation of {{the choice between}} the two analyses for German partial fronting phenomena proposed in the literature, remnant movement and reanalysis. We show that the empirical arguments which were presented {{in favor of an}} extraction analysis are not convincing, and we provide empirical evidence supporting a reanalysis-like approach. Turning to a detailed data discussion, we compare three different kinds of partial constituents: verbal, adjectival, and nominal ones. <b>Adjectival</b> <b>complements</b> pattern with coherently selected verbal complements whereas nominal complements turn out to be less restricted. On the theoretical side, we show that a reanalysis-like theory can be given a formally precise rendering in the HPSG architecture in terms of a lexical argument-raising specification, which is already widely employed in HPSG analyses of coherence in Germanic and restructuring verbs in Romance languages. The account we propose generalizes previous HPSG approaches to partial complements of different categories and correctly predicts the interaction of (partial) VP topicalization with embedded partial NPs or APs...|$|R

40|$|Customer reviews contain {{opinions}} of the customers who purchased products and expressed opinions concerning their satisfactions and criticisms. Due to vast availability of product reviews in the web, it is extremely time-consuming and at times confusing for a new customer to manually analyze the reviews prior to buying a product. Reviews generally involve the presence of product feature specific factual information along with the opinion sentences depicting {{the pros and cons}} of a bought product. The unstructured format of the text reviews from most of the web review sources necessitates the automatic identification of opinion sentences from the customer reviews, and also the identification of explicitly visible and implicitly present product features associated with the opinion sentences. In this paper, a process has been described where typed dependency relations such as open clausal <b>complements</b> or <b>adjectival</b> <b>complements</b> have been utilized to identify opinion sentences specific to product features. The typed dependency relations in the identified opinion sentences are then used to associate a product feature to an opinion sentence with the help of the product feature associated frequent words extracted from a previously managed customer review corpus...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present an {{overview}} of the most relevant syntactic functions of infinitives within the sentence in English, based on the British 2006 Corpus (BE 06) designed by Paul Baker and displayed by the server of Andrew Hardie, Corpus Query Processor (CQPweb). The corpus reveals that infinitives are a very frequent non-finite form employed in English. The most relevant syntactic functions that infinitives took in the corpus were as verbal periphrasis, as verb complements, as noun <b>complements,</b> as <b>adjectival</b> <b>complements,</b> as nominal predicates and as verb subjects. In English there are specific contexts in which the infinitive is not preceded by the particle to, such as after an extensive number of auxiliary, perception and permission verbs. Furthermore, there are other specific contexts in which the infinitive is preceded by the particle to, such as after a large number of direct objects in transitive verbs and functioning as a verb subject and as a noun or adjective complement. The major claim of this study is that infinitives in English do not constitute a uniform group; in fact, they display a variety of syntactic functions within the sentence directly reflecting their nominal and verbal properties...|$|R
40|$|Grammatical {{descriptions}} of contemporary Swedish normally state that Swedish {{has a strong}} subject requirement: finite clauses (except imperatives and conjoined clauses) must contain an overt subject. If the clause lacks a referential subject, the expletive det is inserted either in initial position, e. g. the so-called fundament, or in the subject position following the main verb in a matrix clause. In this article, a new clause type is presented and analyzed. The initial det in examples such as det var bra att du sa (‘it was good that you said’) at first {{appears to be an}} expletive subject, but can be interpreted as the missing object of the embedded clause, which means that the matrix clause has no overt subject. The new construction resembles so-called tough constructions such as det är lätt att säga (‘it is easy to say’), but differs in several respects: it is not restricted to <b>adjectival</b> <b>complements,</b> the complement clause is finite, and the fronted object can only appear in initial position [Spec, CP], not in the postverbal subject position [Spec, IP]. So far the new construction has mainly been attested in informal spoken language, but it seems to be spreading to other registers and used with initial elements in addition to det...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{investigate}} {{the properties of}} the copula-like verb 'ficar' in Brazilian Portuguese using Pustejovsky's generative lexicon (GL). The verb 'ficar' can be translated as 'stay' or 'become', depending on its complement. With locatives, only the STAY reading is possible. With <b>adjectival</b> <b>complements,</b> both BECOME and STAY readings are possible. I propose that 'ficar' takes an eventuality as its complement and I argue that {{there is no need to}} create multiple lexical entries for it, since the readings are the result of the possible combinations between the transition denoted by 'ficar' and {{the properties of the}} stative complements. I argue that the BECOME reading with adjectival predicates is the result of combining part of the qualia of the adjectival predicate with the TRANSITION of 'ficar'. The STAY readings of 'ficar'+adjective are the result of shadowing the transition. In the case of 'ficar'+locative, the BECOME reading is unavailable. Departing from the hypothesis that subevents have to be linked to arguments in order to be able to be modified by certain types of modifiers or be selected by certain types of heads, I argue that the transition, in the case of locative complements, is not associated to any argument because nothing in the qualia of the locative complement is compatible with a transition, given that there is not motion component in either 'ficar' or the locative. Unlinked to any argument, the TRANSITION can only be part of the 'constant' meaning of the verb, which explains why it is not available for modification...|$|R

It shows that with bare infinitival complements, the subject of the SC is not the topic; this contrasts with adjectival SCs, where the subject must be a topic. The differences between verbal and adjectival SCs then follow. Finally, the article compares raising verbs with <b>adjectival</b> SC <b>complements</b> and raising verbs with infinitival complements, showing again that the differences in the syntax and semantics of such construc-tions are related {{to whether or not the}} subject of the embedded clause must be a topic...|$|R
40|$|Applying the {{framework}} of Radical Construction Grammar to diachronic phenomena, the present paper examines Copular Constructions in Old and Middle English, with {{special attention to the}} loss of the Copula weorðan ‘become’. First we reconstruct the extension of the OE Verbs is, beon, weorðan and becuman to various types of Copular Constructions. We further argue that schematic Copular Constructions emerge in overlapping usage areas resulting from these developments, in which abstraction is made of the Copulas' particular aspectual semantics. These schematic Copular Constructions in turn undergo some changes themselves. In Middle English a Passive Construction developed out of an original Copula Construction involving Adjectival Participles. However, the constructional profile of weorðan comprised an association between Participial and <b>Adjectival</b> Subject <b>Complements</b> much stronger than in other copulas, and this conflicted with this development, with the archaisization of weorðan as a result. This process of archaisization was further strengthened by the takeover of Weak Verbs in -ian (type ealdian ‘become old’) by new copulas like becuman. In general, we show how diachronic construction grammar might account for the loss of a function word otherwise difficult to account for. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} in {{some more}} detail the syntax and semantics of inherent complement verbs in Igbo. This is {{in addition to}} Emenanjo (1984, 1986) and Nwachukwu (1987). Here, we have followed Nwachukwu (1987) to assume that inherent complements in Igbo {{are not the same}} as the direct objects of transitive verbs. However, contrary to Nwachukwu (1987), it has been observed that there is only a semantic bond between inherent complements and their inherent complement verbs. The bond is not necessarily syntactic. The pronominalization test distinguishes between the objects of transitive verb and inherent complements. Whereas the object complement of transitive verbs can be pronominalized, inherent complements cannot. Contrary to Nwachukwu’s (1987) view, it has also observed that there is no movement operation affecting inherent complements when inherent complement verbs license internal arguments. Rather, it is the internally licensed arguments that get raised for feature checking purposes. Also, contrary to the view about Igbo dialects in literature, all Ngwa-Igbo <b>adjectival</b> inherent <b>complement</b> verbs can license internal arguments. The data used in this paper are drawn from the Ngwa dialect 1 of Igbo which the author speaks with native speaker’s competence...|$|R

40|$|In Dutch V-final clauses the verbs tend to form {{a cluster}} in which the main verb is {{separated}} from its syntactic arguments {{by one or more}} other verbs. In HPSG the link between the main verb and its arguments is canonically modeled in terms of argument inheritance, also known as argument composition or generalized raising. When applied to Dutch, this treatment yields a number of problems, making incorrect predictions about the interaction with the binding principles and the passive lexical rule. To repair them this paper proposes an alternative, in which subject raising and complement raising are modeled in terms of different devices. More specifically, while subject raising is modeled in terms of lexical constraints, as for English, complement raising is modeled in terms of a more general constraint on headed phrases. This new constraint not only accounts for complement raising out of verbal complements, it also deals with complement raising out of <b>adjectival</b> and adpositional <b>complements,</b> as well as with complement raising out of PP adjuncts and subject NPs. It is, hence, a rather powerful device. To prevent overgeneration we add a number of constraints. For Dutch, the relevant constraints block complement raising out of CPs, V-initial VPs and P-initial PPs. For English, the Empty COMPS Constraint is sufficient to block complement raising entirely. status: publishe...|$|R
