25|$|Like many Allied leaders, Wilson {{believed}} {{after the}} {{victory at the}} Marne {{that the war was}} as good as won. He told Joffre's staff officer General Henri Mathias Berthelot (13 September) that the Allies would be in Elsenborn on the German-Belgian frontier in four weeks (Berthelot thought three). Wilson also helped to persuade Joffre (late September) to allow the BEF to redeploy further {{to the left of the}} Allied line. When French, Murray and Wilson arrived to confer with Foch (then commanding the French Armies in that sector) in early October 1914, Foch greeted Sir John with a handshake but threw his arms around Wilson’s neck <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>him</b> on both cheeks.|$|E
25|$|Morlot {{received}} {{promotion to}} general of brigade on 20 September 1793. The Battle of Kaiserslautern from 28 to 30 November 1793 saw him leading a brigade in Lazare Hoche's Army of the Moselle. The brigade {{was made up}} of the 1st Battalions of the 44th and 81st Line Infantry Demi Brigades and the Ardennes Volunteers, the 2nd Battalions of the 71st Line and Haute-Marne Volunteers and the 6th Battalion of the Meurthe Volunteers. Ultimately, the French withdrew with 2,400 killed and wounded plus 700 men and two guns captured. Prussian and Saxon casualties numbered 806. During the battle Morlot led five battalions in an assault on a position defended by infantry and many cannons. Forced back by superior numbers, he was able to avoid being trapped by enemy cavalry and resume his unit's place in the battle line. After seeing what he had done Hoche praised <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

25|$|Brabourne hosted 17 Test matches between 1948 and 1973, {{starting}} with two matches against the West Indies in India's first home series after the World War II in 1948–49. The first test {{to produce a}} result at the Brabourne was the fourth it hosted, when India beat Pakistan in 1952. India won their first ever test series after taking a 2–1 lead {{on the basis of}} this victory. Vijay Hazare scored a hundred in each of his four test match appearances at the ground, the most by any player. Indian batsman Abbas Ali Baig became the first Indian cricketer to be kissed on a cricket field during the third Test between India and Australia at the Brabourne in 1960. When Baig reached the fifty run mark, a young woman ran onto the ground from the North Stand <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>him</b> on his cheek in full view of a packed crowd. During a test match in 1964, several members of the visiting England team faced fitness issues, forcing England to request India to provide a substitute fielder. On successive days, A. G. Kripal Singh and Hanumant Singh took the field as substitutes for Micky Stewart.|$|E

It was Nasser's first visit to Saudi Arabia since 1956. At the request of the Egyptians, due to assassination rumors, the banners and flags normally put up to celebrate a visiting dignitary were omitted, the sidewalks were cleared of people, and the car was a special bulletproof model. On the evening of his arrival, Nasser was welcomed at a banquet and reception for 700 guests. In less than 48 hours they reached full agreement.

Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club was also critical of the case of the week and the episode in general. While admiring the show's decision to address the controversial issue of Islamophobia in the United States, he did not like the show's characterization of Rashad, the father, noting inconsistencies about whether his storyline was one of redemption or not. [...] "There are three seemingly equal interpretations: that Veronica Mars writers believe that the cartoon is worth ruining someone's life over; that Rashad is a complex character who can be petty and vindictive; or, it's just a bunch of stuff that happens and there is no moral." ...|$|E

When news arrived that the Portuguese capital, Lisbon, had fallen to Pedro's forces, Amélie of Leuchtenberg left Paris with her infant daughter and stepdaughter for Portugal. They arrived in Lisbon on 22 September 1833 and disembarked the next day. Charles John Napier, a British naval officer who had fought alongside Pedro, wrote about the emotional reunion: [...] "I never saw [...] so happy and pleased; he went onboard just a little above Belém; he was received at the ladder by the empress [...] who hugged <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>him</b> with the greatest affection: the queen [...] was very moved and could not hold her tears. The little Princess [...] Amélia, his youngest daughter, took much of his attention: she became somewhat scared of seeing his bushy beard and did not warm to his caresses." ...|$|E
500|$|... is a green-haired {{girl who}} is the third member of the Mew Mews {{formally}} introduced to the readers. Infused with the DNA of a Finless Porpoise, Retasu's legs can change into a porpoise's tail while she is underwater, greatly improving her swimming ability and giving her an appearance of a mermaid. In the anime adaptation, this change can only occur when Retasu is {{in the presence of}} Mew Aqua. Retasu is portrayed as a shy and intelligent character lacking self-confidence and is the subject of frequent bullying from three girls. She is afraid of her Mew Mew powers at first, causing them to go out of control at her school until she is calmed by Ichigo and Minto. The other members of the group consider Retasu to be a kind and selfless person. As the series progresses, Retasu becomes a more confident person through the other Mew Mews' regular encouragement. In the anime, Retasu has a strong love interest towards Ryou <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>him</b> once, that only Bu-Ling is aware of their relationship.|$|E

Naomi found a guy she thought would be perfect for Sonya and then asked her and Toadie to come on the date for moral support. Naomi's date ended up having an argument with Sonya, causing Toadie to apologise to Naomi for ruining her date and comforting her. Naomi continued to cause problems for Sonya and Toadie's marriage and when Sonya went away, Naomi decided to make her move. She invited herself over to Toadie's house, where they enjoyed watching DVDs together. Moloney explained that it was all innocent to begin with, but when they began trying out wrestling moves, Toadie should have realised {{that it was not a}} good idea. However, Toadie did not stop Naomi and she pinned him to the floor <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>him.</b> Moloney admitted that Toadie was [...] "mortified" [...] by the kiss, but it made him realise that he has no emotional investment in Naomi at all. Sheila then told Toadie that Naomi had been trying to seduce him for weeks and Toadie felt [...] "duped." [...] Moloney said [...] "He trusted Naomi and appreciated their friendship, and now he's been blindsided. He feels utterly betrayed when he discovers the whole situation was premeditated." ...|$|E

[...] He endeared people to him with mannerisms which Sherrington states to have been [...] "very symbols of him." [...] One example of Head's {{confidence}} and unflappability occurred when he was listening to a female patient's heart.

("Deep Breath, Death in Heaven") When she met him again, Missy pretended to be an android <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>him</b> passionately. ("Dark Water") Despite still being manic and a psychopath, she later showed a willingness to reform, spending centuries in the Doctor's custody as a show of her commitment. Later, she felt torn between the Doctor, who represented her repentance, and her past incarnation, who represented a return to her old ways; she ultimately chose the Doctor, for which her past incarnation killed her in disgust ("The Doctor Falls").|$|E
2500|$|In {{the third}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Jacob named the place Peniel, {{saying that he}} had seen God face to face and lived. And at sunrise, Jacob limped from the injury to his thigh. Because of this, the Israelites do not eat the sinew of the vein that is the hollow of the thigh, because the man touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh. When Jacob saw Esau coming with 400 men, he divided his family, putting the handmaids and their {{children}} foremost, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph at the back. Jacob went before them, and bowed to the ground seven times as he approached his brother. Esau ran to meet him, embraced him, <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>him,</b> and they wept. Esau asked who the women and children were. The third reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E
2500|$|Ancient {{sources tell}} of another favorite, Bagoas; a eunuch [...] "exceptional in beauty {{and in the}} very flower of boyhood, with whom Darius was {{intimate}} and with whom Alexander would later be intimate."

2500|$|Nyrop {{writes that}} the most common example is the [...] "intense feeling which knits parents to their offspring", but he adds that kisses of affection are not only common between parents and children, but also between {{other members of the}} same family, which can include those outside the {{immediate}} family circle, [...] "everywhere where deep affection unites people." [...] The tradition is written of in the Bible, as when Orpah kissed her mother-in-law and when Moses went to meet his father-in-law, he [...] "did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent" [...] (Exodus 18:7); and when Jacob had wrestled with the Lord he met Esau, ran towards him, fell on his neck <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>him.</b> The family kiss was traditional with the Romans and kisses of affection are often mentioned by the early Greeks, as when Odysseus, on reaching his home, meets his faithful shepherds.|$|E
2500|$|Folk poetry {{has been}} the source of affectionate kisses where they {{sometimes}} played an important part, as when they had the power to cast off spells or to break bonds of witchcraft and sorcery, often restoring a man to his original shape. Nyrop notes the poetical stories of the [...] "redeeming power of the kiss {{are to be found in}} the literature of many countries, especially, for example, in the Old French Arthurian romances (Lancelot, Guiglain, Tirant le blanc) in which the princess is changed by evil arts into a dreadful dragon, and can only resume her human shape in the case of a knight being brave enough to kiss her." [...] In the reverse situation, in the tale of [...] "Beauty and the Beast", a transformed prince then told the girl that he had been bewitched by a wicked fairy, and could not be recreated into a man unless a maid fell in love with him <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>him,</b> despite his ugliness.|$|E

She then tried to convince Daniel to work things out with Amber, but his [...] "unwavering confidence in their love" [...] had been knocked. Kaplan expressed her wish for Imogen and Daniel to become a couple, saying [...] "I have wanted them to be together from the start. I think they balance each other out and Daniel brings out the best in Imogen, so I'm always hoping that it happens secretly!" [...] Phillipps later admitted that Daniel and Imogen were better suited than Daniel and Amber. He thought they should get together and hoped the writers had noticed that there was a demand for them to be a couple on social media sites.|$|E
