5|$|Culture: <b>Although</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> {{differences}} between Eastern and Western cultures, including {{as to how}} often family names or initials are used, the effect seems to apply across cultures. In their study with subjects from Thailand, where the family name is rarely used, Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun found a much stronger effect for first name than family name. Kitayama and Karasawa found no special effect for initials in Japan, where name initials are rarely used, but did find an overall name-letter effect.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis {{is mostly}} {{based on the}} {{clinical}} appearance and the medical history. The most important diagnostic feature {{is a history of}} recurrent, self healing ulcers at fairly regular intervals. <b>Although</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> causes of oral ulceration, recurrent oral ulceration has relatively few causes, most commonly aphthous stomatitis, but rarely Behçet's disease, erythema multiforme, ulceration associated with gastrointestinal disease, and recurrent intra-oral herpes simplex infection. A systemic cause is more likely in adults who suddenly develop recurrent oral ulceration with no prior history.|$|E
5|$|Robert is a {{young boy}} who suffers from {{mathematical}} anxiety due to his boredom in school. His mother is Mrs. Wilson. He also experiences recurring dreams—including falling down an endless slide or being eaten by a giant fish—but is interrupted from this sleep habit one night by a small devil creature who introduces himself as the Number Devil. <b>Although</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> Number Devils (from Number Heaven), Robert only knows him as the Number Devil before learning of his actual name, Teplotaxl, later in the story.|$|E

50|$|Elections to Manchester Borough Council {{were held}} in 1946. One third of the council was up for election, <b>although</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>many</b> {{additional}} vacancies. The council stayed under Labour Party control.|$|R
5|$|Sea anemones {{are found}} in both deep oceans and shallow coastal waters worldwide. The {{greatest}} diversity is in the tropics <b>although</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> species adapted to relatively cold waters. The majority of species cling on to rocks, shells or submerged timber, often hiding in cracks or under seaweed, but some burrow into sand and mud, and a few are pelagic.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> Cortinarius {{species with}} some degree of violet colour, C.violaceus and its close {{relatives}} are easily distinguished by their much darker purple colour. Cortinarius iodes of the southeastern United States has a slimy purple cap and paler violet stipe. The other species in the section Cortinarius are dark purple and superficially similar, but can be differentiated based on host and geography as they do not occur in the same locations as C. violaceus. Certain Leptonia species in northwestern North America, including L. carnea and L. nigroviolacea, have a similar color, but are easily differentiated due to their pink spore print.|$|E
5|$|M-17 {{begins at}} exit37 along US Highway 23 (US23) on the Ann Arbor– Pittsfield Township border. West of this {{cloverleaf}} interchange, Washtenaw Avenue is Business Loop Interstate 94 (BLI-94) and Business US23 (Bus. US23). M-17 follows Washtenaw Avenue east of this interchange through Pittsfield Township and Ypsilanti Township. The street is five lanes wide through {{an urban area}} between Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti running east-southeasterly. <b>Although</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> residential areas near M-17, particularly to the south, the road itself is dominated by commercial development, including numerous restaurants. M-17 crosses into the city of Ypsilanti at Hewitt Road. This intersection provides access north to Rynearson Stadium, home field for the Eastern Michigan University (EMU) Eagles football team.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "63" [...] M156 is {{currently}} in production in the C63 AMG, and tuned as the M159 in the SLS AMG, <b>although</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>many</b> models that <b>were</b> previously in production.|$|R
50|$|<b>Although</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>many</b> {{models and}} {{versions}} of the car, its production can nonetheless be split into three distinct generations and two derivatives. In total 639,478 Volgas were built from 1956 until 1970.|$|R
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> diverse pathogens, many {{of which}} are {{constantly}} mutating, it is a surprise that a majority of individuals remain free of infections. Thus, maintenance of health requires the body to recognize all pathogens (antigens they present or produce) likely to exist. This is achieved by maintaining a pool of immensely large (about 109) clones of B cells, each of which reacts against a specific epitope by recognizing and producing antibodies against it. However, at any given time very few clones actually remain receptive to their specific epitope. Thus, approximately 107 different epitopes can be recognized by all the B cell clones combined. Moreover, in a lifetime, an individual usually requires the generation of antibodies against very few antigens in comparison with the number that the body can recognize and respond against.|$|E
5|$|Transcription in archaea {{more closely}} resembles {{eukaryotic}} than bacterial transcription, with the archaeal RNA polymerase being {{very close to}} its equivalent in eukaryotes; while archaeal translation shows signs of both bacterial and eukaryal equivalents. Although archaea only have one type of RNA polymerase, its structure and function in transcription seems {{to be close to}} that of the eukaryotic RNA polymerase II, with similar protein assemblies (the general transcription factors) directing the binding of the RNA polymerase to a gene's promoter. However, other archaeal transcription factors are closer to those found in bacteria. Post-transcriptional modification is simpler than in eukaryotes, since most archaeal genes lack introns, <b>although</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> introns in their transfer RNA and ribosomal RNA genes, and introns may occur in a few protein-encoding genes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Although</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> {{different}} dialects and accents, {{the transcription}} would be fairly standard.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Although</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>many</b> speakeasies in Saratoga Springs {{during this}} period, six were {{well known as}} [...] "lake houses": The Arrowhead Inn, Riley's Lake House, The Piping Rock Club, Newman's Lake House,The Meadow Brook (earlier Mayfair), and Smith's Interlaken.|$|R
5000|$|Elagabalus , Aelagabalus, or Heliogabalus [...] is a Syro-Roman sun god. <b>Although</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>many</b> {{variations}} of the name, the god was consistently referred to as Elagabalus in Roman coins and inscriptions from AD 218 on, {{during the reign of}} emperor Elagabalus.|$|R
50|$|<b>Although</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>many</b> {{figures who}} {{conducted}} {{some form of}} research about the Tol language, the key researchers that played enormous roles in collecting most of the data {{that we know about}} it include Lyle Campbell, David Oltrogge, Dennis Holt, and Steffen Haurholm-Larsen.|$|R

50|$|<b>Although</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>many</b> {{individuals}} {{trying to}} lead United States industries towards {{a more comprehensive}} approach to quality, the U.S. continued to apply the Quality Control (QC) concepts of inspection and sampling to remove defective product from production lines, essentially ignoring advances in QA for decades.|$|R
50|$|<b>Although</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>many</b> local actions (including {{attacks by}} Polish partisans, {{who had a}} strong {{presence}} in the area) the German defence line on the Narew held through the remainder of 1944, until the 2nd Belorussian Front's advance in the East Prussian Operation of January 1945.|$|R

50|$|The Ben Hur trailer was nicknamed {{after its}} major manufacturer, the Ben Hur Mfg. Co., <b>although</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>many</b> other {{companies}} that produced it between 1941 and 1945. Its primary purpose was to transport general cargo; the Signal Corps modified it to carry several different generators.|$|R
50|$|<b>Although</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>many</b> {{individuals}} {{who served as}} officers in the American Civil War and the Indian Wars who were living {{at the time of}} the Order's founding, that service did not qualify them for membership as those wars were considered to be domestic rather than foreign wars.|$|R
