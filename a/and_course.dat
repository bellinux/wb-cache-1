5|$|At 05:37 {{an enemy}} contact report was made, <b>and</b> <b>course</b> {{was changed to}} {{starboard}} to close range. Neither ship was in good fighting trim. Hood, designed twenty-five years earlier, lacked adequate decking armour {{and would have to}} close the range quickly, as she would become progressively less vulnerable to plunging shellfire at shorter ranges. She had completed an overhaul in March and her crew had not been adequately retrained. Prince of Wales, with thicker armour, was less vulnerable to 15-inch shells at ranges greater than , but her crew had also not been trained to battle efficiency. The British ships made their last course change at 05:49, but they had made their approach too fine (the German ships were only 30 degrees on the starboard bow) and their aft turrets could not fire. Prinz Eugen, with Bismarck , had Prince of Wales and Hood slightly forward of the beam, and both ships could deliver full broadsides.|$|E
5|$|During British rule, a Governor was {{the chief}} {{administrative}} and political officer of Bombay. The executive Government of the Presidency was administered by the Governor.

Bombay Castle was the official residence of the Governor of Bombay until the 1770s, when it was moved to Parel; a century later, in 1883, it was moved to Malabar Hill.|$|E
5|$|Following the German {{destroyer}} attack, the High Seas Fleet disengaged, and Collingwood and {{the rest}} of the Grand Fleet saw no further action in the battle. This was, in part, due to confusion aboard the fleet flagship over the exact location <b>and</b> <b>course</b> of the German fleet; without this information, Jellicoe could not bring his fleet to action. At 21:30, the Grand Fleet began to reorganise into its night-time cruising formation. Early on the morning of 1 June, the Grand Fleet combed the area, looking for damaged German ships, but after spending several hours searching, they found none. Collingwood fired a total of 52 armour-piercing, capped and 32 HE shells from her main armament and 35 four-inch shells during the battle. Prince Albert was a sub-lieutenant commanding the forward turret during the battle and sat in the open on the turret roof during a lull in the action.|$|E

5|$|Following the German {{destroyer}} attack, the High Seas Fleet disengaged, and Iron Duke and {{the rest}} of the Grand Fleet saw no further action in the battle. This was, in part, due to confusion aboard Iron Duke over the exact location <b>and</b> <b>course</b> of the German fleet; without this information, Jellicoe could not bring his fleet to action. At 21:30, the Grand Fleet began to reorganise into its nighttime cruising formation. Early on the morning of 1 June, the Grand Fleet combed the area, looking for damaged German ships, but after spending several hours searching, they found none. Iron Duke returned to Scapa Flow, arriving at 11:30. Over the course of the battle, Iron Duke had fired ninety rounds from her main battery, along with fifty rounds from her secondary guns.|$|E
5|$|Following the German {{torpedo boat}} attack, the High Seas Fleet disengaged, and Benbow {{and the rest}} of the Grand Fleet saw no further {{significant}} action in the battle. This was, in part, due to poor communication between Jellicoe and his subordinates over the exact location <b>and</b> <b>course</b> of the German fleet; without this information, Jellicoe could not bring his fleet to action. Benbow fired briefly at a group of torpedo boats at about 21:10, with a salvo of 6-inch shells and a single 13.5-inch round. At 21:30, the Grand Fleet began to reorganise into its nighttime cruising formation. Early on the morning of 1 June, the Grand Fleet combed the area, looking for damaged German ships, but after spending several hours searching, they found none.

5|$|Having {{observed}} the sessions and received {{feedback from the}} drivers and the teams about the circuit conditions, the series' president of competition Brian Barnhart <b>and</b> <b>course</b> designer Tony Cotman opted to postpone the qualification session to race morning, with the running of a third practice session and a Sunday morning warm-up instead of it. Power topped this extra session, ahead of Kanaan and Ryan Hunter-Reay, with Justin Wilson—a new arrival at Dreyer & Reinbold Racing—in fourth position. After the session, track officials started grinding down the concrete {{in order to provide}} a track surface that was suitable for racing the following day. Hunter-Reay topped the Sunday morning warmup before qualifying, setting the fastest lap time by over half a second ahead of second-year driver Mike Conway in another Dreyer & Reinbold car.|$|E

5|$|Hersing {{attacked}} {{a convoy of}} fifteen merchant ships escorted by fourteen destroyers in August south-west of Ireland. He took U-21 {{between two of the}} escorting destroyers and briefly used his periscope to gauge the speed <b>and</b> <b>course</b> of the transports before firing two torpedoes and diving. Hersing reported both torpedoes hit and the destroyers immediately rushed to begin their depth charge attacks. After a five-hour hunt, the destroyers withdrew to rejoin the convoy. The experience led Hersing to change tactics in future attacks on escorted convoys; instead of attacking the ships {{from as far away as}} possible, he chose to fire his torpedoes at closer range and then dive under the transport ships, where the destroyers would be unable to launch their depth charges for fear of damaging the transports. As of 1918, she was assigned to the III U-boat Flotilla. Later in 1918, the submarine was used as a training boat for new crews. She survived the war, but on 22 February 1919, she accidentally sank in the North Sea while under tow to Britain, where she would be formally surrendered.|$|E
5|$|Major Himalayan-origin {{rivers that}} {{substantially}} flow through India include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, {{both of which}} drain into the Bay of Bengal. Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi; the latter's extremely low gradient often leads to severe floods <b>and</b> <b>course</b> changes. Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, and the Krishna, which also drain into the Bay of Bengal; and the Narmada and the Tapti, which drain into the Arabian Sea. Coastal features include the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh. India has two archipelagos: the Lakshadweep, coral atolls off India's south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea.|$|E
5|$|Measure 32 was {{a medium}} pattern of {{obtrusive}} polygons in navy blue or black, against background polygons of lighter grays and greens. This measure emphasized mistaken identity <b>and</b> <b>course</b> deception to complicate submarine attack. Patterns were carried across the bow, and light gray was used aft to blend with the wake. This measure {{was based on}} the World War I dazzle system modified by observations in the western Pacific; and was applied to most surface ships in the Pacific during 1944 and 1945. Different patterns were devised for classes with large numbers of ships so the pattern would not identify the class of ship.|$|E

5|$|Moltke and {{the other}} battlecruisers {{followed}} the move, which put them astern of König. Hipper's badly battered ships gained a temporary moment of respite, and uncertainty over the exact location <b>and</b> <b>course</b> of Scheer's ships led Admiral Jellicoe to turn his ships eastward, towards {{what he thought was}} the likely path of the German retreat. The German fleet was instead sailing west, but Scheer ordered a second 16-point turn, which reversed course and pointed his ships {{at the center of the}} British fleet. The German fleet came under intense fire from the British line, and Scheer sent Moltke, Von der Tann, Seydlitz, and Derfflinger at high speed towards the British fleet, in an attempt to disrupt their formation and gain time for his main force to retreat. By 20:17, the German battlecruisers had closed to within 7,700yards (7,040m) of , at which point Scheer directed the ships to engage the lead ship of the British line. However, three minutes later, the German battlecruisers turned in retreat, covered by a torpedo boat attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{new design}} reduced the bomb aimer's setup {{workload}} to dialling in four settings. Two of {{these could be}} set before the mission; the altitude of the target above sea level and the terminal velocity of the bomb, {{a function of the}} particular bomb being used on that mission. The only settings that had to be adjusted in flight were the measured wind direction and speed. The altitude, airspeed <b>and</b> <b>course</b> were all measured by the internal instruments and presented to the user in windows {{on the side of the}} computor case. Once set, the computor would automatically update the calculations and display the resulting bombing angle in another window. The computor could even account for steady changes in altitude, allowing the bomb run to take place in a shallow climb of up to 5 degrees or dive of up to 20 degrees.|$|E
5|$|While Royal Oak was {{attacking the}} battlecruisers, a German torpedo boat {{flotilla}} launched {{an attack on}} the British line. Royal Oaks secondary guns were the first to open fire, at 19:16, followed quickly {{by the rest of the}} British line. Following the German destroyer attack, the High Seas Fleet disengaged, and Royal Oak and the rest of the Grand Fleet saw no further action in the battle. This was, in part, due to confusion aboard the fleet flagship over the exact location <b>and</b> <b>course</b> of the German fleet; without this information, Jellicoe could not bring his fleet to action. At 21:30, the Grand Fleet began to reorganise into its night-time cruising formation. Early on the morning of 1 June, the Grand Fleet combed the area, looking for damaged German ships, but after spending several hours searching, they found none. In the course of the battle, Royal Oak had fired 38 rounds from her main battery and 84 rounds from her secondary guns.|$|E
