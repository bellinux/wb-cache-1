50|$|Social and {{political}} considerations often {{are also important}} in setting tariffs. Tariff structure and levels are influenced in some cases {{by the desire to}} avoid an overly high burden for poor users. Political considerations in water pricing often lead to a delay in the <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> <b>tariff</b> increases in the run-up to elections. Another criterion for tariff setting is that water tariffs should be easy to understand for consumers. This is not always the case for the more complex types <b>of</b> <b>tariffs,</b> such as increasing-block tariffs and tariffs that differentiate between different categories of users.|$|R
25|$|The {{autonomy}} of the local corporations, however, remained limited. Important decisions such as the <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> <b>tariff</b> increases, investment decisions, and {{the selection of the}} General Manager of each Local Corporation still required the <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> the central government. Investments are financed by foreign grants channeled through the central government. Furthermore, the Boards of the local corporations often did not play an active role. For example, in Ibb the Board met infrequently, did not discuss the corporation's accounts and was reluctant to even discuss a tariff increase. In 2009 a study recommended to transform local corporations into public companies with clear business plans and more autonomy, but this recommendation was not implemented.|$|R
40|$|The {{necessity}} of guaranteed {{water supply and}} quality service underlay a legislative decision made to ensure an administrative supervision of that activity. One of the basic instrument s of the control is a procedure of handling a tariff of water and sewage rates and charges. Pursuant to the Act of 7 June 2001 on {{water supply and sewerage}} treatment service, the revision and <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> <b>tariffs</b> has been vested in individual municipalities, and the regulations governing their activity have practically remained intact since the implementation of the Act, notwithstanding the many problems and doubts that have been arising as to the functioning of public administration organs, administrative courts, or the operations of companies. The paper presents issues related to the revision and <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> <b>tariffs.</b> The key issues that have been analysed include the defi nition of a tariff and a tariff application, establishing the legal nature of such documents, and the identifi cation of the principles as well as limits of tariff revision performed by a municipality executive body in the process of tariff approval. It also contains de lege ferenda conclusions which point to the need to replace municipality bodies involved in the process with specialised central or regional organs, to ensure participation of a professional and independent regulator, free from the pressures of local politics (maintaining, of course, the ex ante supervision). 151271585 Studia Prawa Publiczneg...|$|E
40|$|For <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> <b>tariffs</b> {{imposed by}} the Decree DM July 5, 2012 (Quinto Conto Energia) for {{photovoltaic}} systems integrated with innovative features, is defined as “non-conventional photovoltaic module” a “photovoltaic module whose use is possible and effective only for applications like architectural, being itself a building element”. In this context, the concentrating photovoltaic systems suitable for building integration (BICPV) are low concentration parabolic trough (LCPV, C < 10 suns), which need a single axis movement {{in order to ensure}} uniform illumination of the photovoltaic cells, and luminescent solar concentrators (LSC, C = 2 - 3 suns), able to concentrate both the direct and diffuse radiation. These systems are highly versatile: they have a linear or planar geometry easily to integrate. They are also multi-functional as they may offer additional features such as sun shading or night lighting. In this thesis are presented two different solutions for BICPV: the linear parabolic trough Solar Flight and the solar window based on LSC. Both systems are equipped with an integrated MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking), and the energy produced by the photovoltaic cells is used to power white or RGB integrated LED bars for ambient lighting. Have been cured all the different phases of prototyping two modules: the optical and mechanical design, the realization of electronic circuits, the characterization lab tests and finally the installation of the modules in a passive house presented in Madrid during the international Solar Decathlon Europe 2012 competition...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This research focused on determining the roles and institutional arrangements for economic regulation of urban water services in Sub- Saharan Africa. Urban water service delivery mainly supplied by state owned utilities is constrained due to many factors {{one of which is}} related to insufficient or lack of a clear economic regulatory framework. The research used a multiple case study approach and systematically analysed the roles and institutional arrangements of economic regulation of urban water services in three countries of Ghana, Mozambique and Zambia. Based on literature as the source of information, the research developed the existing political and socio-economic environment in the different countries which can affect the design and determination of the roles and institutional arrangements for economic regulation. A further analysis was made of the perceptions on the roles and institutional arrangements of the regulatory framework in the Sub-Saharan African context through a questionnaire distributed beyond the three case countries. The study obtained primary data from focus group discussions, key informant interviews, official documents and observations. Lessons obtained through literature from regulatory institutions in other continents have also been included and these are Jamaica, Latvia, Jakarta in Indonesia, and England and Wales. The factors which can affect the roles and institutional arrangements of economic regulation of urban water services were divided into three groups as: including country governance, socioeconomic and sectoral factors. Country governance factors, which include political stability and fragility, are a key factor in the decision of whether to establish a regulatory agency. On the other hand, socio-economic factors influence the focus or areas which must not be ignored by economic regulation. The third type of factors which include the robustness of a policy framework, and performance levels of utilities, affect the effectiveness and efficiency of an economic regulator. Based on the evidence from the research, economic regulation in Sub-Saharan Africa should address five key roles, which are [i] <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> <b>tariffs</b> that will lead to service providers achieving commercial viability, [ii] "consumer protection" [iii] monitoring and enforcing performance standards, [iv] setting up of a knowledge bank on urban water services, and [v] ensuring that the poor gain sustained access to water services. There are a number of specific regulatory functions within each role. Sub-Saharan African countries are in a unique situation where the urban poor comprise as much as 60...|$|E
50|$|Water supply {{policies}} and regulation are usually defined {{by one or}} several Ministries, {{in consultation with the}} legislative branch. In the United States the United States Environmental Protection Agency, whose administrator reports directly to the President, is responsible for water and sanitation policy and standard setting within the executive branch. In other countries responsibility for sector policy is entrusted to a Ministry of Environment (such as in Mexico and Colombia), to a Ministry of Health (such as in Panama, Honduras and Uruguay), a Ministry of Public Works (such as in Ecuador and Haiti), a Ministry of Economy (such as in German states) or a Ministry of Energy (such as in Iran). A few countries, such as Jordan and Bolivia, even have a Ministry of Water. Often several Ministries share responsibilities for water supply. In the European Union, important policy functions have been entrusted to the supranational level. Policy and regulatory functions include the setting <b>of</b> <b>tariff</b> rules and the <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> <b>tariff</b> increases; setting, monitoring and enforcing norms for quality of service and environmental protection; benchmarking the performance of service providers; and reforms in the structure of institutions responsible for service provision. The distinction between policy functions and regulatory functions is not always clear-cut. In some countries they are both entrusted to Ministries, but in others regulatory functions are entrusted to agencies that are separate from Ministries.|$|R
5000|$|Dozens of {{countries}} around the world have established regulatory agencies for infrastructure services, including often water supply and sanitation, in order to better protect consumers and to improve efficiency. Regulatory agencies can be entrusted with a variety of responsibilities, including in particular the <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> <b>tariff</b> increases and the management of sector information systems, including benchmarking systems. Sometimes they also have a mandate to settle complaints by consumers that have not been dealt with satisfactorily by service providers. These specialized entities are expected to be more competent and objective in regulating service providers than departments of government Ministries. Regulatory agencies are supposed to be autonomous from the executive branch of government, but in many countries have often not been able to exercise a great degree of autonomy. In the United States regulatory agencies for utilities have existed for almost a century at the level of states, and in Canada at the level of provinces. In both countries they cover several infrastructure sectors. In many U.S. states they are called Public Utility Commissions. For England and Wales, a regulatory agency for water (OFWAT) was created as part of the privatization of the water industry in 1989. In many developing countries, water regulatory agencies were created during the 1990s in parallel with efforts at increasing private sector participation.

50|$|Tariff {{increases}} have to {{be approved}} by NWASCO based on tariff adjustment guidelines published, in their second and improved version, in 2005. Proposals for tariff increases can be submitted in advance for a period of up to six years. The approval process includes ten steps, including a public hearing with consumper representatives and an analysis of service quality and costs. The regulator can exclude costs from the proposal if it considers them unjustified, but otherwise the regulator mostly has to follow specific calculations that are specified in the guidelines. On the one hand, if the utility has not met previously agreed targets for the share of metered customers, water quality and service continuity the approved tariff will be lower than if the targets are met. On the other hand, if special efforts have been made to improve access, performance or efficiency, higher tariffs will be approved. Sanitation tariffs are usually 30 percent <b>of</b> water <b>tariffs.</b> In contrast to the detailed procedures for the <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> water <b>tariffs,</b> sanitation tariffs are set as a share <b>of</b> water <b>tariffs</b> without taking into account the performance of the sanitation services.|$|R
5000|$|In 2001 a {{conflict}} erupted between {{various members of}} the MWSS regulatory office. The chief of the office, Rex Tantiongco, resigned in July 2001 after he failed to gain support from other members of the office for the <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> another <b>tariff</b> increase after the one granted by the Arbitration Panel. His successor, Herman Cimafranca, called the office a [...] "toothless paper tiger". He said it had no role in approving tariff increases, as evidenced by the earlier referral to increase the rate of return to an arbitration panel and not to the regulatory office. In October 2001 the Board of MWSS approved the first amendment to the concession contracts. It allowed tariffs to be changed quickly as a result of on exchange rate fluctuations, instead of recovering losses from exchange rate fluctuations only through gradual adjustements. This led to another immediate tariff increase.|$|R
40|$|The main {{economic}} {{functions of}} the insurance sector are to cover financial risk and to mobilize long-term savings. The sector can also {{play an important role}} in developing the private sector and modernizing the securities market. But to play its economic and financial roles, the insurance sector must operate within a framework of stable, liberal regulation that provides incentives for efficiency, allows companies to innovate, and creates a contestable market with relatively free entry and exit. In most developing countries, regulation has deviated greatly from this ideal. Often dominated by state-owned companies, the insurance industry in many developing countries features: (a) strict controls on new entry; (b) prohibitions against majority ownership by foreign companies; (c) fixed premiums (especially for compulsory lines); (d) prior <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> <b>tariff</b> changes and new products; (e) high local retention ratios (which discourage reinsurance from overseas companies); (f) insurance reserves used as a captive source of funding for public deficits; and (g) weak prudential controls and inadequate monitoring of solvency. In recent years there has been a growing trend away from direct controls on premiums, products, and investments, and toward more monitoring of the solvency of companies, through more effective supervision and clear prudential controls. The author argues that Tunisia's insurance sector has been hampered by restrictive regulations, by the country's low incomes (which limit long-term savings capabilities), and by it pay-as-you-go social pension system. Tunisia's life insurance is seriously underdeveloped. The insurance is seriously underdeveloped. The insurance industry also suffers from structural problems. Worst of all, prudential regulations and standards are unequally applied, and some companies are still operating with insufficient capital(in a few cases, with greatly negative equity). What is needed? Capital-deficient companies need to be restructured and recapitalized, state-owned companies need to be privatized, and the market needs to be opened up to majority foreign-owned firms. Supervision must be strengthened and corrective measures applied more equitably and forcefully. The social pension system must be radically reformed, to include one fully funded pillar that will generate long-term savings and transform the prospects for life insurance business.

40|$|Chilean {{legislation}} is quite conservative, especially compared with international practice. However, its application {{has not been}} free of criticism, and it proved necessary to seek mechanisms that combine limitations {{set forth in the}} GATT/WTO regulations and others self-imposed by Chilean law. Legislation on antidumping measures was introduced in Chile in 1992. The Distortions Commission has recommended and the President has adopted such measures on just six occasions, of which two correspond to extensions of existing measures. Legislation on safeguard measures was introduced in 1999. In the 1999 - 2002 period, seven safeguard measures were adopted. The traditional agricultural sector was the main user of the measures, and no measure was in place for more than 12 months. The context in which the Commission was created in 1981 and the type of measures adopted by this entity support the idea that the objective of the Commission was to alleviate the political pressures generated by the difficult economic situation rather than to correct problems originated by the price distortions of goods. In {{the second half of the}} 1980 s, the Commission supported the liberalization process that started in 1985. Adopting safeguard legislation in 1999 helped to gain <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> further <b>tariff</b> reductions from 11 percent to 6 percent. During the decade of the 1990 s and until the present day, the philosophy of minimal use to further liberalization has been maintained.

More specifically, a ten percentage point decrease in tariffs reduces the wage premium by 1. 1 %.
