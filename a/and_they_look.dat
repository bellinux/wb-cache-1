5|$|At Quantico, someone slips a {{newspaper}} article under Scully's door enabling her to identify the original body as a crew member on a Russian ship. Mulder and Scully meet at the processing plant <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> at the strange, fluke-like man. Skinner wants to prosecute the creature and subject it to a psychiatric evaluation, which Mulder thinks would be difficult. Skinner tells Mulder of Craig's death and admits that {{this would have been}} an X-File had they still been open. Mulder raises his discontentment claiming that with X-Files, a certain pair of agents could have saved a life. Skinner simply responds saying everyone takes their orders from someone, implying the decision was not his and came from higher up the chain of command.|$|E
5|$|On a field trip, Veronica meets Gia (Krysten Ritter). On the bus home, Veronica {{talks to}} Meg one more time, {{but she is}} still passive-aggressive. Veronica {{explains}} to the audience that she and Duncan are dating. At a rest stop, Veronica sees Weevil and they debate about the stabbed gang member. Meanwhile, Veronica's bus drives away without her. Instead, Weevil takes Veronica on his motorcycle before they run across the limo with Duncan, Gia, and the others in it. They tell Veronica that the bus full of students drove off the cliff and into the sea, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> over at the crashed bus.|$|E

6000|$|... [Gaily.] Well, I met Arthur at a {{week-end}} party. He'd {{come home}} on leave {{and all sorts}} of important people had been asked to meet him. I was frightened out of my life. The duchesses had strawberry leaves hanging all over them <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> at me down their noses. And the Cabinet Ministers' wives had protruding teeth <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> at me up their noses.|$|R
60|$|The man stopped half-way, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> at each other; but Sikes's eyes sunk {{gradually}} to the ground.|$|R
25|$|The {{rocks on}} the plains of Gusev are a type of basalt. They contain the {{minerals}} olivine, pyroxene, plagioclase, and magnetite, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> like volcanic basalt as they are fine-grained with irregular holes (geologists would say they have vesicles and vugs).|$|E
25|$|In return, Edmund {{helps her}} get {{released}} from prison so she can help her own daughter, Bianca, with her anorexia. Dimitri is also there for his former stepdaughter. At Bianca's intervention he admits he still loves Erica. Slowly, Erica and Dimitri work their way into becoming friends. He escorts her to the Crystal Ball in 1998 <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> {{to be on their}} way to a reconciliation. By the time Erica realizes she still loves him, he is presumed dead. During his funeral she talks about her and Dimitri as soul mates and acts as though she is his widow. Alexandra Devane Marick reveals that she married Dimitri during his trip to Europe. Erica does not believe Alex is the type of woman Dimitri would ever be with and doubts they were ever married.|$|E
500|$|In a {{detailed}} review, Jason Lipshutz from Billboard wrote, [...] demonstrates an originality in sound {{that was necessary}} for the revitalization of the boy band movement. The electropop currently dominating Top 40 radio is seamlessly weaved into the pop harmonies made standards by 'N Sync, Backstreet Boys and 98 Degrees -- for instance, the title track sounds like a hybrid of Backstreet Boys' [...] "Larger than Life" [...] and an LMFAO song, and even includes a Katy Perry name-check. Up All Night has its ups and downs, but One Direction complete two important tasks on their debut album: the boy band notches a long-lasting hit with [...] "What Makes You Beautiful," [...] <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> forward instead of back. Get ready {{to hear a lot}} more of One Direction. Matthew Horton of Virgin Media opined that the album brims with [...] "punchy pop rock", and considered the dance-orientated [...] "Stole My Heart": [...] "the only misstep, which only reinforces their decision to go pop rock." [...] MSN Musics Ben Chalk called the album: [...] "manufactured, calculated and commercial", assessing that the resulting album [...] "is a corking pop album". In his review, he also complimented the album for its collection of singles: [...] "' is a collection of highly polished pop gems, which knows its market and gives it what it wants".|$|E
60|$|They {{had both}} {{become aware of}} a sort of {{sibilant}} breathing, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> round them in bewilderment.|$|R

2500|$|The {{influence}} of Arabic literature on European writers is proven by what [...] Reinhart Dozy quoted on his book [...] "Spanish Islam: History of Moslems in Spain", of the Spanish writer AlGharo, who deeply regretted {{the neglect of}} Latin and Greek and {{the acceptance of the}} language of the Muslims, he said [...] "The intelligent and eloquent people are bewitched by the sound of Arabic <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> down on Latin. They have started to write in the language of those who defeated them" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "As a union, we {{are making}} {{reasonable}} demands, such as a wage increase, decent working conditions, and for Starbucks to adhere to their values of Corporate Social Responsibility.’ The company isn't following these principles, which are the base of our daily work and behavior in the stores," [...] said Giordano. He said the union workers in Chile are [...] "glad and proud" [...] to announce their union, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> forward to more international solidarity with the IWW. [...] "We believe our purpose will be stronger, as we strive together," [...] he added.|$|E

2500|$|The {{game was}} {{released}} in Japan on December 8, with no date set for North American or European releases. Both IGN and GameSpot played an import copy of the game, and both were impressed. IGN's Gantayat again praised the absence of loading times, arguing [...] "the technical feats this game pulls off with the grey and limping PS2 hardware are impressive." [...] He praised the pre-rendered CG cutscenes, and the smooth transition from these scenes to the gameplay itself. GameSpot's Bethany Massimilla wrote [...] "The visual style {{of the game is}} strongly inspired by cel-shading techniques, but the characters here aren't the flat and cartoony sort that you might ordinarily associate with the cel-shaded style. They exist and move in full 3D with lots of attention to detail in their attire and their movement, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> great." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the {{rehabilitation}} cell, Zelena reads [...] "Hansel and Gretel" [...] to her unborn child, {{before going into}} pain, screaming and banging on the door. Regina and Robin show up <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> at her pregnant body, which has accelerated by seven months (from two months), a result of Emma's dark magic. Zelena is {{rushed to the hospital}} and says that Emma did this with her onion rings. Dr. Whale is there and Zelena says tells him to get her [...] "angry baby" [...] out, and Whale reminds her about the last baby he delivered, which she tried to steal. He then mocks her, telling her that she must have realized that having a baby was so much more fun than stealing one. Regina asks why his hair is blonde and spiked, with Dr. Whale replying that since Emma changed her hairstyle, he though he could do the same as well. As Dr. Whale continues to joke about Zelena, Regina mutters that they [...] "really need a new doctor in this town." [...] Belle and Mary Margaret rush in and tell them that Emma is coming for the baby, and that the only thing she needs other than Excalibur to snuff out the light are the cries of a newborn child. Zelena begs Regina to take off the cuff so she can defend herself and her baby, but Regina says no. Zelena immediately delivers a baby girl, as Regina and Mary Margaret wait in the hall. Mary asks if Regina is ready to meet her new family, but she says she doesn’t know. As Robin hold the newborn, Emma appears, throwing Whale against the wall yet again. Robin and Regina prepare to fight her, but Emma reveals that she wants Zelena instead, and disappears with her.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, you know," [...] he said, [...] "some of the {{established}} charitable institutions are rather conservative, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> upon you as an interloper, and your methods as a little too broad." ...|$|E
60|$|While the {{listeners}} were smiling their comments {{there was a}} quick movement behind their backs, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> round. Tess, pale-faced, {{had gone to the}} door.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Well,' he said, 'you see {{the ladies}} are here, ain't they? If we sent them away, don't {{you think it}} might hurt their feelings, eh? One doesn't like to be rough, you see; <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> regular blues, don't they, eh?' ...|$|E
