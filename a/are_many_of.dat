5|$|Above the {{transport}} layer, {{there are certain}} protocols that are sometimes used and loosely fit in the session and presentation layers, most notably the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols. These protocols ensure that data transferred between two parties remains completely confidential. Finally, at the application layer, <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the protocols Internet users would be familiar with such as HTTP (web browsing), POP3 (e-mail), FTP (file transfer), IRC (Internet chat), BitTorrent (file sharing) and XMPP (instant messaging).|$|E
5|$|In 1962, {{the trust}} {{successfully}} lobbied {{for the house}} to become a national historic landmark. In 1972, the Trust donated the property to the National Park Service and it became the Longfellow National Historic Site {{and open to the}} public as a house museum. On display <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the original nineteenth century furnishings, artwork, over 10,000 books owned by Longfellow, and the dining table around which many important visitors gathered. Everything on display was owned by the Longfellow family. The site was renamed to Longfellow House–Washington's Headquarters National Historic Site on December 22, 2010, to ensure that the connection to Washington was not lost in the memory of the general public.|$|E

25|$|What {{remains of}} the heerlijkheid system <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the manors and castles.

Nevertheless, areas of lower income colonias exist in some cases cheek-by-jowl with rich neighborhoods, {{particularly in the case}} of Santa Fe.|$|E

25|$|The honorary {{officers}} of the UOHC announced the appointment of his youngest son, Rabbi Ephraim Padwa, as the new rabbinical head of the community. They hoped the Padwa name would help hold together an increasingly fractured community that could fast split up with Reb Henoch's death. Another son, Rabbi Yosef is a highly respected rabbinical authority, Rabbi Shalom Friedman, the oldest son-in-law, is a respected rabbi in the community as <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the Padwa grandchildren.|$|E
25|$|The {{singular}} number {{indicates that}} the denoted thing is one or indivisible (as in méilė – love, smė̃lis – sand, píenas – milk). The plural number, when it can be {{in contrast with the}} singular, {{indicates that the}}re <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the things denoted by the word. But sometimes, when a word doesn't have the singular number, being a plurale tantum noun, the plural form doesn't indicate real singularity or plurality of the denoted object(s).|$|E
25|$|Much {{the same}} {{considerations}} apply to bass drum pedals and the stool, {{but these are}} not always considered breakables, particularly if changeover time between bands is very limited. Swapping the snare drum in a standard kit can be done very quickly. Replacing cymbals on stands takes longer, particularly if there <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them, and cymbals are easily damaged by incorrect mounting, so many drummers prefer to bring their own cymbal stands.|$|E

25|$|Choir stalls {{are of the}} 15th century, as <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the pew bench ends. The pulpit and lectern {{are also}} of the 19th century. There is a canopied stoup, and a 12th-century lead-lined tulip bowl font on a stem with rope moulding. The church has five bells cast in ca.1500, 1641, 1763, 1795, and 1877. A brass {{engraving}} in the chancel floor {{is dedicated to the}} rector John Dyer (died 1499) who paid for the rebuilding of the chancel.|$|E
25|$|Two {{problems}} ensue {{from the}} multiplicity of transcription systems used for Tlingit. One is that there <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them, thus requiring any reader to learn each individual system depending on what sources are used. The second problem is that most transcriptions made before Franz Boas's study of Tlingit have numerous mistakes in them, particularly because of misinterpretations of the short vowels and ejective consonants. Thus {{it is important to}} check any given transcription against similar words in other systems, or ideally against a modern work postdating Naish and Story's work in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|The Downtown Ossining Historic District {{is located}} at the central {{crossroads}} of Ossining, New York, United States, and the village's traditional business district known as the Crescent. Among its many late 19th- and early 20th-century commercial buildings <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the village's major landmarks—three bank buildings, four churches, its village hall, former post office and high school. It was recognized as a historic district in 1989 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places, {{as one of the few}} downtowns in Westchester County with its social and historical development intact.|$|E

25|$|Israel's {{military}} technology is most {{famous for its}} firearms, armored fighting vehicles (tanks, tank-converted armored personnel carriers (APCs), armoured bulldozers, etc.), unmanned aerial vehicles, and rocketry (missiles and rockets). Israel also has manufactured aircraft including the Kfir (reserve), IAI Lavi (canceled), and the IAI Phalcon Airborne early warning System, and naval systems (patrol and missile ships). Much of the IDF's electronic systems (intelligence, communication, command and control, navigation etc.) are Israeli-developed, including many systems installed on foreign platforms (esp. aircraft, tanks and submarines), as <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> its precision-guided munitions. Israel is the world's largest exporter of drones.|$|E
25|$|John A. Howe Branch Library, 105 Schuyler Street. The Georgian Revival {{style was}} used for this 1929 {{building}} to complement the nearby Schuyler Mansion. It is a one-story, nine-bay structure of brick in Flemish bond on a raised basement, set off by a stone water table with a projecting central entrance pavilion, narrow arched Palladian windows set with 12-over-23 double-hung sash, separated by pilasters topped by scroll-carved stones. On the roof is a stone balustrade with carved pineapple finials. Inside <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the original oak finishings and furniture. The children's room has a fireplace with stone tiles {{telling the story of}} Rip Van Winkle.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} ways to {{represent}} tries, corresponding to different trade-offs between memory use and speed of the operations. The basic form is that of a linked set of nodes, where each node contains an array of child pointers, one for each symbol in the alphabet (so for the English alphabet, one would store 26 child pointers and for the alphabet of bytes, 256 pointers). This is simple but wasteful in terms of memory: using the alphabet of bytes (size 256) and four-byte pointers, each node requires a kilobyte of storage, and when there is little overlap in the strings' prefixes, the number of required nodes is roughly the combined length of the stored strings. Put another way, the nodes {{near the bottom of the}} tree tend to have few children and there <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them, so the structure wastes space storing null pointers.|$|E
