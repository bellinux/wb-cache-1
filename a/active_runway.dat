5|$|The general concept pre-dated the Mk. IV and was {{essentially}} a UK version of the German Lorenz beam system. Lorenz, or Standard Beam Approach as it was known in the UK, used a single transmitter located off {{the far end of}} the <b>active</b> <b>runway</b> that was alternately connected to one of two slightly directional antennas using a motorized switch. The antennas were aimed so they sent their signals to the left and right of the runway, but their signals overlapped down the centreline. The switch spent 0.2seconds connected to the left antenna (as seen from the aircraft) and then 1second on the right.|$|E

25|$|Prior to {{the runway}} reconfiguration, all of O'Hare's runways intersected {{each other with}} the {{exception}} of 4R/22L. This created problems in inclement weather, busy times, or high winds, and several near-collisions. The redevelopment, which essentially eliminates most <b>active</b> <b>runway</b> intersections, is intended to reduce collision hazards and delays.|$|E
25|$|On July 6, 2005 a {{fully loaded}} Israir 767 accidentally taxied onto an <b>active</b> <b>runway</b> at JFK, and a Douglas DC-8 cargo {{aircraft}} narrowly avoided collision by taking off at full throttle above them, with only 45 feet of clearance over the 767.

25|$|Luxembourg's Ministry of {{transport}} stated that three {{investigations into the}} incident had been launched. It did not state whether the van had permission {{to be on the}} <b>active</b> <b>runway</b> or not. The investigations are being carried out by Luxembourg's Administration Des EnquÃªtes Techniques, Directorate of Civil Aviation and Administration of Air Navigation (AET). A preliminary report revealed that the van had been given permission to be on the <b>active</b> <b>runway.</b> The clearance had been issued before Flight 7933 started its approach. Flight 7933 also had permission to land on the runway that the van was on. Representatives from the NTSB and the Association Luxembourgeoise des Pilotes de Ligne assisted the AET in their investigation. The event was initially classed by the AET as an accident but was downgraded to a serious incident as the damage to the aircraft involved was not structural.|$|E

The One-Eleven aborted its take-off and an emergency evacuation was performed with all 93 people on board escaping uninjured. The Aztec was written off and the substantially damaged One-Eleven was repaired and returned to service.|$|E
25|$|The UK had {{for some}} time used a blind landing system known as Standard Beam Approach, an {{adaptation}} of a pre-war German system known as a Lorenz beam. Lorenz, and Standard, used two radio transmissions that were picked up by conventional voice radio sets.

25|$|During 2011 the {{airfield}} underwent {{a number of}} changes. Runway 07/25 was closed as an <b>active</b> <b>runway</b> and was re-opened as Taxiway C, running {{the full length of}} the old runway. The previous Taxiway C was closed and its northern part, between Runway 10/28 and the old Runway 07/25, was opened as an extension of Taxiway E. Another notable change has been the relocation of the airport's Fire Services which have been moved from north of the fuel farm to a more central position, between the terminal and some of the flying clubs, on the Taxiway B ramp.|$|E
25|$|There was {{no further}} {{communication}} between Flight 954 {{and the ground}} controller. This left the ground controller {{with the assumption that}} Flight 954 was holding at the 32R run-up pad and in no danger of conflicting with other traffic and the flight crew with the assumption that they were cleared to taxi to the 32L run-up pad and could cross Runway 27L without danger of a collision with aircraft using that runway. Moreover, Flight 954's flight crew had never received word that Runway 27L was an <b>active</b> <b>runway,</b> and had no reason to anticipate encountering other aircraft while taxiing across it.|$|E
25|$|Northwest 1482 {{was cleared}} {{from the gate}} towards Runway 03C, but it missed turning onto taxiway Oscar 6 and instead entered the Outer taxiway. To correct the error they were {{instructed}} to turn right onto Taxiway Xray but they turned onto the <b>active</b> <b>runway</b> 03C. They realised the mistake and contacted air traffic for instructions who told them to leave the runway immediately, five seconds later (at 13:45 EST) the crew saw a Boeing 727 heading towards them. The Boeing 727 was operating the Northwest 299 flight to Memphis and had just been cleared for take-off. The 727 wing hit {{the right-hand side of}} the DC-9 and cut through the fuselage just below the windows until it cut off the DC-9's #2 engine. The DC-9 caught fire and was destroyed; the 727 just had a damaged wing and was later repaired.|$|E

25|$|On 7 June 2001, a Beechcraft B300C Super King Air 350, {{registration}} F-GOAE, {{departed from}} Le Mans-Arnage Airport (LME), France, to Santiago De Compostela Airport (SCQ), Spain, on a cargo flight according to instrument flight rules. Near the destination airport, the meteorological conditions {{were reported to}} be good, and the crew requested a visual approach to runway 17, even though the <b>active</b> <b>runway</b> was 35. Once cleared to land, the aircraft encountered a fog patch and from this moment it began a high ate descent (2000 to 3000ft/min). A minute after entering an unexpected and unforeseen fog patch, the aircraft struck some trees in level flight and with an airspeed of 148 kt. The wings and engines detached from the fuselage, and they dragged along a scrubland area until {{they came to a}} stop. The crew suffered minor injuries and the aircraft was completely destroyed.|$|E
25|$|Clipper Victor, {{which was}} the first Boeing 747 to carry fare-paying {{passengers}} in 1970 (N736PA), was involved in the Tenerife disaster on March 27, 1977, the deadliest aviation accident in history. On that day, Clipper Victor operated a charter flight, PA 1736, from Los Angeles to Las Palmas in the Canary Islands, Spain, via New York. The aircraft, along with many other aircraft, diverted to Los Rodeos Airport on Tenerife because of a bomb scare at Las Palmas. After Las Palmas airport reopened, the diverted aircraft began preparations for departure. Clipper Victor was instructed to taxi along the <b>active</b> <b>runway</b> after the preceding KLM. Although visibility was extremely poor due to thick fog, the pilot of the KLM aircraft (also a Boeing 747) commenced takeoff without clearance and collided with the Pan Am airplane still taxiing on the runway. A total of 583 people were killed. 335 passengers on the Pan Am plane died while 61 survived.|$|E
25|$|On 11 October 2016, China Eastern Airlines Flight 5643, an Airbus A320, was {{involved}} in a serious runway incursion incident during takeoff from Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport. The aircraft was cleared for takeoff from runway 36L for a domestic flight to Tianjin. As it was accelerating down the runway, China Eastern Airlines Flight 5106, an Airbus A330-343 entered the <b>active</b> <b>runway</b> via taxiway B3. The aircraft had just landed on runway 36R after a flight from Beijing and had reportedly been cleared to taxi to the terminal. It left the runway via B3, crossed taxiway Bravo and entered the active departure runway via taxiway H3. This crossing is located 2110 meters from the threshold of runway 36L and 2400 meters from the point where the A320 commenced takeoff. The A320 was accelerating through 110 knots when the crew noted the A330 entering the runway. The crew selected TOGA thrust and continued their takeoff. The aircraft rotated at about 130 knots and climbed over the A330 with a separation of just 19 meters.|$|E
