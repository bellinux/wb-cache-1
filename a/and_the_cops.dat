5|$|After rescuing Camille from Medrano, Bond follows Greene to a {{performance}} of Tosca in Bregenz, Austria. Meanwhile, {{the head of the}} CIA's South American section, Gregg Beam (David Harbour), strikes a noninterference deal with Greene for access to putative stocks of Bolivian oil. Bond infiltrates Quantum's meeting at the opera, identifying members of Quantum's executive board, and a gunfight ensues. A Special Branch bodyguard working for Quantum member Guy Haines (Paul Ritter), is killed by antagonists after Bond throws him off a roof. M assumes Bond killed him, and has Bond's passports and credit cards revoked. Bond heads to Italy and convinces his old ally René Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini) to accompany him to Bolivia. They are greeted by Strawberry Fields (Gemma Arterton), a consular employee who demands Bond return to the UK immediately. Bond seduces her and they attend a fundraising party Greene holds that night. At the party, Bond again rescues Camille from Greene. Leaving, Bond and Camille are pulled over by Bolivian police working for Medrano. They had earlier attacked Mathis and put him in the boot of Bond's car to frame Bond. In the ensuing struggle, Mathis <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>cops</b> are killed.|$|E

40|$|When {{faced with}} the noun phrase (NP) versus {{sentence}} (S) coordination ambiguity as in, for example, The thief shot <b>the</b> jeweller <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>cop</b> hellip, readers prefer the reading with NP-coordination (e. g., "The thief shot <b>the</b> jeweller <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>cop</b> yesterday") over one with two conjoined sentences (e. g., "The thief shot <b>the</b> jeweller <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>cop</b> panicked"). A corpus study is presented showing that NP-coordinations are produced far more often than S-coordinations, which in frequency-based accounts of parsing might be taken to explain the NP-coordination preference. In addition, we describe an eye-tracking experiment investigating S-coordinated sentences such as Jasper sanded <b>the</b> board <b>and</b> <b>the</b> carpenter laughed, where the poor thematic fit between carpenter and sanded argues against NP-coordination. Our results indicate that information regarding poor thematic fit was used rapidly, but not without leaving some residual processing difficulty.

40|$|AbstractIn off-spin bowling (finger-spin {{delivery}} with a sidespin, right-handed bowler), {{the ball}} rolls over <b>the</b> middle finger <b>and</b> rotates counterclockwise, {{as seen by}} the batsman.

The off-spin bowling action was recorded in five bowlers with a smart cricket ball <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>COP</b> was determined. In two bowlers, <b>the</b> <b>COP</b> was located at <b>the</b> middle finger <b>and</b> moved clockwise, i. e. against {{the sense of the}} ball, inherent to rolling motion. In one bowler, <b>the</b> <b>COP</b> was shifted slightly to the index finger, indicating a small contribution by the index to torque generation.
