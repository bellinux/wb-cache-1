40|$|Background: Current {{air quality}} {{standards}} for particulate matter (PM) use the PM mass concentration [PM with aerodynamic diameters ≤ 10 μm (PM 10) or ≤ 2. 5 μm (PM 2. 5) ] as a metric. It {{has been suggested that}} particles from combustion sources are more relevant to human health than are particles from other sources, but the impact of policies directed at reducing PM from combustion processes is usually relatively small when effects are estimated for a reduction in the total mass concentration. Objectives: We evaluated the value of black carbon particles (BCP) as an additional indicator in air quality management. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of health effects of BCP compared with PM mass based on data from time-series studies and cohort studies that measured both exposures. We compared the potential health benefits of a hypothetical traffic <b>abatement</b> <b>measure,</b> using near-roadway concentration increments of BCP and PM 2. 5 based on data from prior studies. Results: Estimated health effects of a 1 -μg/m 3 increase in exposure were greater for BCP than for PM 10 or PM 2. 5, but estimated effects of an interquartile range increase were similar. Two-pollutant models in time-series studies suggested that the effect of BCP was more robust than the effect of PM mass. The estimated increase in life expectancy associated with a hypothetical traffic <b>abatement</b> <b>measure</b> was four to nine times higher when expressed in BCP compared with an equivalent change in PM 2. 5 mass.

Noise pollution is an irritant to residents, especially in urban areas near roads with high traffic volume. In addition to its adverse effects {{on the quality of}} life, traffic noise can induce stress that could lead to sleep disturbance and anxiety. Traditionally, noise barrier walls have been used for highways to mitigate traffic noise. However, using barrier walls as a noise <b>abatement</b> <b>measure</b> has proven to be very expensive. In addition to the cost, noise barrier walls are not always effective because they must break the line of sight to work properly, which is not always possible in case of intersections or driveways.

Discriminating {{the contribution of}} the local atmospheric circulation and the regional and long-range transport processes, in determining PM 2. 5 and pollutants levels, is very important for deciding any effective <b>abatement</b> <b>measure.</b> This is particularly true in the Northeastern part of the Po Valley, one of the most polluted areas in Europe. This study proposes a method for assessing the relative importance of regional and long-range transport episodes and of local sources on PM 2. 5 mass and ionic composition. Air mass back-trajectories were combined with PM chemical composition and local wind data and the relative contributions were estimated. Air mass histories show that the levels of PM 2. 5 increased when air masses had arrived from Northern to Central and Northwestern Europe and significantly dropped when the trajectories originated from the Mediterranean area. Furthermore, results reveal that relatively fast winds from quadrant I were associated with clean air and increasing sea-salt components. Diversely, air mass stagnations were closely accompanied by severe pollution events. Heavily polluted episodes were recorded in correspondence of days characterized by low-mobility atmospheric conditions and when air masses had spent most time over the Po Valley region. These results can help understanding the sources, the chemistry and dynamics of PM 2. 5 in Northeastern Italy. The proposed approach is easily applicable to other environments...|$|R

In {{this thesis}} a {{framework}} for integrating life cycle assessment and investment analysis is derived, aimed to (1) unite economic and environmental perspectives, and (2) strengthen system borders. The application of the model is shown in {{a case study of}} a bioenergy facility in central Norway. Prices and environmental impacts are calculated, and the results are compared to those for electricity generated from natural gas. Two examples of utilisation of the results are presented. Methods. Hybrid life cycle assessment is employed to enable the use of the price model from input-output analysis. The price model is extended to facilitate the integration of investment analysis. The resulting framework embodies all aspects from investment analysis, including tax and discounting. The result is a model performing a state of the art hybrid life cycle assessment and a net present worth analysis to obtain environmental and economic results with consistent system borders.

This paper explores the quantitative connection between urban waste water treatment, coastal eutrophication, and fish biomass in the mesotrophic Gulf of Riga (northern Europe). The probable effect on the water quality from one clearly defined <b>abatement</b> <b>measure,</b> improved urban sewage treatment has been studied. Furthermore, the implementation cost and the likely effect on total fish biomass have also been assessed. Computer simulations using the previously published model CoastMab suggested that good water quality according to the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive could be achieved if urban sewage treatment would be upgraded to Nordic and German standards, and not only around the Gulf of Riga but in the whole Baltic Sea drainage basin. The Secchi depth would double according to these simulations while total phosphorus and summer chlorophyll concentrations would decrease by 54 % and 53 %, respectively. The total fish biomass {{should be expected to}} decrease by about 42 % if “good” water quality (as defined in European Union directives) should be achieved. However, changes in total fish biomass could also be offset by changes in other important determinants such as climate related variables or fishing pressure.

Upgrading urban sewage treatment to this extent would cost 468 - 1, 118 million euros per year. Treatment could have substantial positive effects on the water quality of the Gulf but could also have adverse side effects on the total fish biomass...|$|R

Costs are assessed from different perspectives. In particular the user perspective and the society perspective have been applied for the analysis in GHG-TransPoRD.
