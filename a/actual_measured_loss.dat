30|$|The ideal {{approach}} to diagnosing menorrhagia should be readily available, inexpensive {{and able to}} <b>measure</b> <b>actual</b> blood <b>loss.</b> However, to date no such test exists. Attempts {{have been made to}} increase the accuracy of diagnosing menorrhagia using PBACs. Initial studies have demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity of > 80 % for a PBAC score of > 100 [10]. Other reports have demonstrated that the same sensitivity and specificity can be achieved, but with a cut-off point of 185 [11]; still more recently one study has reported that there is no correlation between the observed PBAC and <b>actual</b> <b>measured</b> blood <b>loss</b> [12]. The advantage of the PBAC is that it does provide semi-objective comparative information {{in the absence of a}} more valid and reliable test. In our study, we employed PBAC scores as the semi-quantitative means for assessing MBL in the study group.|$|R
30|$|In this study, {{there was}} a trend of {{increasing}} serum potassium level (i.e., hyperkalemia). The potassium level was maintained within the normal range during the experimental period by adjusting isoflurane concentration and propofol infusion rate together based on serum potassium level measurement at regular intervals. A possible explanation could be that only the brain was subjected to mild hypothermia (33.4 [*]±[*] 0.3  °C) while the whole body temperature (36.6 [*]±[*] 0.3  °C) was still within the normothermia range. With regard to administering potassium to correct hypokalemia, if observed, during hypothermia, potassium should only be administered to replace <b>actual</b> <b>measured</b> <b>losses</b> from gastrointestinal or urinary routes to prevent hyperkalemia and arrhythmias upon rewarming [42]. Furthermore, rewarming too quickly after hypothermia can cause dangerous electrolyte shifts, leading to potentially lethal arrhythmias [43]. Therefore, {{it is suggested that}} controlling the rewarming rate as low as 0.2 – 0.5  °C/h is preferred to reduce the neurological risks [13, 44].|$|R

We used the last one, which, although subjective, is {{the most widely used}} in the literature studies that analyzed the LNG-IUS efficiency for treating heavy menstrual bleeding, therefore allowing us to compare our results with those from other authors. Initial studies demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity of > 80 % for a PBAC score of > 100 [5]. On the other hand, Reid et al.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the shearing process on the iron loss of non-oriented electrical steels with grain sizes of 10 μm- 150 μm was investigated. The deterioration ratio of iron loss was clearly smaller in sample with small grain sizes. The droop height, reflecting the amount of plastic deformation, displayed {{a good relationship with}} the deterioration of iron loss under the effect of the material grain size. To clarify the strain distribution around the sheared edge, the elastic strain in a sheet sample with the thickness of 0. 30 mm and grain size of 10 μm was evaluated by using synchrotron radiation. The width of the region of elastic strain due to shearing was two or three times of the material thickness. The results of the plastic strain distribution obtained by the measurements were then used to estimate the iron loss deterioration rate in 5 mm width sheared samples. The estimated loss deteriotation coincided with the <b>actual</b> <b>measured</b> iron <b>loss...</b>|$|R

It {{is very important that}} the volume of blood loss during childbirth be reported with accuracy. However, it is traditionally accepted that the most commonly used method of estimating blood loss is 2 ̆ 7 inaccurate, This study attempted to determine the accuracy of the attending midwives 2 ̆ 7 visual estimation of blood loss, during vaginal delivery, by <b>measuring</b> all blood <b>loss</b> with electronic weighing scales and comparing it to their visually estimated figures. One hundred and seven women, booked for confinement at a large metropolitan hospital, were selected for the study during their labour. Related samples t tests and Pearson 2 ̆ 7 s product moment correlation coefficients compared the <b>actual</b> <b>measured</b> blood <b>loss,</b> and the attending midwives 2 ̆ 7 estimated blood loss. Significant differences were found, supporting the hypotheses at the 0. 05 level of significance, that subjective visual estimation of blood loss during childbirth remains an inaccurate method. Both under and over estimation occurred regardless of the midwives 2 ̆ 7 years of experience or education. The findings from this study imply that midwives should adopt more reliable methods of <b>measuring</b> blood <b>loss.</b> Furthermore, midwifery curricula should incorporate a component which prepares midwives for precise and accurate estimation of blood loss during childbirth...|$|R
40|$|Empirically based {{models are}} used {{worldwide}} to estimate soil erosion. The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) {{is one such}} model that has been intensively tested and validated under conditions in the United States. RUSLE estimates average soil loss {{as a function of}} five main factors: rainfall erosivity (R), soil erodibility (K), crop management (C), support practice (P), and topographic (LS) factors. This study investigated the application of RUSLE to Mediterranean conditions. The validation and calibration of RUSLE in the study area utilized field plots' soil erosion measurements. The results found the RUSLE soil loss estimation to be three times the actual soil loss (7. 8 and 2. 6 Mg/ha, for RUSLE and <b>actual</b> <b>measured</b> soil <b>loss,</b> respectively). The difference between the RUSLE factors and the measured factors were responsible for the differences between the soil loss estimation by RUSLE and the <b>measured</b> soil <b>loss.</b> Specifically, the RUSLE K-factor showed three times the magnitude of the measured K-factor, the RUSLE C-factor underestimated the measured C-factor, and the RUSLE P-factor overestimated the measured P-factor by three times. Adjusting the RUSLE factors according to the measured ones increased the model's predictability, whereas the adjusted-RUSLE soil loss estimation underestimated the <b>measured</b> soil <b>loss</b> by 14 %. The adjustment of RUSLE, according to the prevailing conditions of the study area, increased the model efficiency three times (0. 26 and 0. 86 before and after adjustment of the mode,l respectively). For more accurate and reliable validation of the RUSLE under the Mediterranean conditions, it is advisable to conduct long-term soil loss experimentation and measurement...|$|R
40|$|Aims This {{study is}} {{designed}} to evaluate the impact of heavy menstrual bleeding on women’s {{quality of life and}} to explore their help-seeking behaviour patterns by comparing women with objectively measured heavy menstrual bleeding to women with <b>measured</b> normal menstrual <b>loss,</b> to correlate <b>actual</b> <b>measured</b> menstrual blood <b>loss</b> with the individual woman’s perceptions of her bleeding, and to compare women who perceive they have heavy menstrual bleeding with women who perceive their bleeding to be normal in relation to their assessment of the impact of menstrual bleeding on their quality of life. Background & methodology Heavy menstrual bleeding has a significant effect on women’s daily life and economic consequences for society. This thesis presents the results of a novel study of a self-selected group of women from the NSW community, who responded to an online survey by a market research company. The survey asked a range of questions around menstruation and the woman’s perception and tolerance of the menstrual cycle. Of 1, 575 women who answered the original survey and 628 of these offered to participate in further research about menstruation. Most of these women were contacted later by phone and 63 agreed {{to take part in the}} present study. The sixty-three respondents had their menstrual blood <b>loss</b> (MBL) <b>measured</b> for three cycles using the alkaline haematin method. Women were categorised according to <b>measured</b> blood <b>loss</b> into normal or heavy menstrual bleeding groups. Women with more than 80 mL of blood loss for at least two cycles were included in the heavy group. Data were analysed using SPSS version 20. Alpha was set at 0. 05 for all analyses.

40|$|This article critiques {{the federal}} policy and {{legislation}} that makes USDA a financial intermediary {{designed to give}} farmers access to credit {{in light of the}} federal class action settlement of claims between African-American farmers and USDA. The challenged statutory scheme allows locally elected farmers to make decisions regarding these low-cost loan funds. USDA 2 ̆ 7 s approach has both federalist and economic underpinnings. The article identifies the arguments supporting devolution of power from the federal government to local jurisdictions and examines the competing theories of information costs, transaction costs, and agency costs as they relate to USDA as a financial intermediary. Finally, it critiques both the federalism and economic justifications of USDA 2 ̆ 7 s decision to allow local farmers to make credit decisions. Challenging the fairness to minority constituent concerns of locally controlled political processes, the article suggests that local constituencies that do not mandate accountability for minority interests may unfairly influence the supposedly democratic majoritarian regime. Given the absence of monitoring for compliance within the federal programs, there is inadequate justification for the role of the county committee in the lending process. Finally, the article proposes more stringent monitoring, record keeping and reporting requirements in order to determine promptly whether discriminatory lending patterns exists and recommends an alternative way to <b>measure</b> <b>actual</b> <b>loss</b> by allowing compensation for loss of prospective inheritance...|$|R

By using the formal of one-color ink thickness and ink density, the second density that correspond the first major density is transferred to the equal thickness. Then they are added together. According to the formula the real ink density is calculate. Then use the above formula to work out ink thickness. In this way, overprint densities come out, and make contrast with the <b>actual</b> <b>measure</b> data, so the new model formula is built up. The result shows that the average error between the overprint density calculated by ink thickness and the <b>actual</b> <b>measure</b> data is about 0. 07. However, the average error between the calculated density using the simple adding method and the <b>actual</b> <b>measure</b> data is about 0. 5, so this method is practical and more accurate...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} new method for using {{validation}} data to correct self-reported weight and height in surveys {{that do not}} weigh and measure respondents. The standard correction from prior research regresses <b>actual</b> <b>measures</b> on reported values using an external validation dataset, and then uses the estimated coefficients to predict <b>actual</b> <b>measures</b> in the primary dataset. This approach requires the strong assumption that the expectations of actual weight and height conditional on the reported values are the same in both datasets. In contrast, we use percentile ranks rather than levels of reported weight and height. Our approach requires the much weaker assumption that the conditional expectations of <b>actual</b> <b>measures</b> are increasing in reported values in both samples, making our correction more robust to differences in measurement error across surveys. We then examine three nationally representative datasets and confirm that misreporting is sensitive to differences in survey context such as data collection mode. When we compare predicted BMI distributions using the two approaches, {{we find that the}} standard correction is biased by differences in misreporting while our correction is not. Finally, we present several examples that demonstrate the potential importance of our correction for future econometric analyses and estimates of obesity rates...|$|R

Methods A sample of 1144 Chinese adolescents was randomly selected from four schools in Wuhan, China, including 665 boys and 479 girls with ages ranging between 10 and 17 years. <b>Actual</b> <b>measured</b> weight and height and perceived weight status were compared to anxiety and depressive symptoms measured using the revised Self-Rating Anxiety Scale and Children's Depression Inventory. A general linear model was used to compare differences in psychological symptoms among the teenagers with different measured and perceived weights. Results When compared with standardized weight tables (WHO age- and gender-specific body mass index (BMI) cutoffs (2007 reference)), girls were more likely to misperceive themselves as overweight, whereas more boys misclassified their weight status as underweight. The adolescents who perceived themselves as overweight were more likely to experience depressive and anxiety symptoms (except girls) than those who perceived themselves as normal and/or underweight. However, no significant association was found between depressive and anxiety symptoms <b>actual</b> <b>measured</b> weight status.
