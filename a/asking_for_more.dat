5|$|During 1934 {{and early}} 1935, all feature films {{released}} in the Dutch East Indies had been produced by The Teng Chun, based on Chinese mythology or martial arts, and targeted at low-class audiences, generally ethnic Chinese. This situation {{was created by the}} Great Depression, which had led to the Dutch East Indies government collecting higher taxes, advertisers <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> money, and cinemas selling tickets at lower prices; this ensured that there was a very low profit margin for local films. During this period cinemas in the country mainly showed Hollywood productions.|$|E

5|$|For his campaign, Romney {{assembled}} a veteran group of Republican staffers, consultants, and pollsters. He was little-known nationally, though, and stayed around the 10percent support range in Republican preference polls {{for the first}} half of 2007. He proved the most effective fundraiser of any of the Republican candidates and also partly financed his campaign with his own personal fortune. These resources, combined with the mid-year near-collapse of nominal front-runner John McCain's campaign, made Romney a threat to win the nomination and the focus of the other candidates' attacks. Romney's staff suffered from internal strife; the candidate himself was at times indecisive, often <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> data before making a decision.|$|E

5|$|When {{the team}} {{returned}} to play more matches in Australia, MacLaren {{became involved in}} controversy for criticising the standards of play in New Zealand and for comments made in the press there. He also queried the first-class status of Bill Ponsford's record innings of 429, scored against Tasmania. On the journey home, MacLaren {{sent a message to}} Lancashire <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> money; the committee declined to send the sum and shortly afterwards terminated his contract as coach. Lancashire told the press that MacLaren's knee injury meant that he could not continue.|$|E

25|$|Not much coal {{seems to}} have traversed {{the part of the}} canal that was open, so that quite apart from the {{shortage}} of capital to continue construction, the Company was making an operating loss and was unable to pay its debts. An extraordinary general meeting was called on 3 May 1780, at which those present decided to make a call of 10% on all shareholders. This was a difficult time to ask for money, as the American War of Independence (1775–83) had ruined many of the Glasgow businesses, dependent on the American tobacco business. Moreover, <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> money to keep a bankrupt business going was inopportune.|$|E
25|$|In 1998 the Feyenoord Supporters Vereniging were {{wondering}} {{about whether or}} not {{it would be possible to}} create more atmosphere inside the stadium mainly during important matches. As a result, a few huge flags were produced and brought into the stadium prior to matches played by Feyenoord. The flags were a success, but people started <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> activities and a meeting between fans and officials were arranged. In 2000 Harry Veth was given permission to establish a group of five Feyenoord fans called TIFO team Feyenoord Rotterdam. Besides creating more flags and small pieces of paper released from the second platform the team also started to organise bigger activities. The first big activity was held on 10 December 2000 when Feyenoord faced Ajax and 40 fog machines were activated when the players entered the pitch. In the following years many different and various activities were held to improve the atmosphere inside the stadium. Feyenoord's TIFO team became famous abroad as well and the Italian TIFO foundation awarded Feyenoord the Best of TIFO Award 2000/2001.|$|E

25|$|On 6 January 1941, while Göring was on holiday, Raeder {{approached}} Hitler <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> {{support to}} assist the growing successes of the U-Boats. Despite Göring's resistance, and {{under pressure from the}} navy, Hitler gave Raeder one Gruppe (Group) from Kampfgeschader 40 (I./KG 40). The furious Göring returned and immediately engaged in political manipulation to have it returned to Luftwaffe control. He proposed that it be returned in exchange for an Atlantic command. Regardless of Raeder's objections, on 28 February 1941, Hitler agreed to Goring's compromise and authorised the formation of a Luftwaffe naval command, under the control of Luftflotte 3 (Air Fleet 3) and its commander Hugo Sperrle. Named Fliegerführer Atlantik, it was based at Lorient. Martin Harlinghausen was elected to command the organisation. He had been a naval officer in the 1920s but had moved to the Luftwaffe and acted as chief of staff for X. Fliegerkorps in Norway, and was a leading authority in anti-shipping attacks with bombs. He was a logical choice to lead Atlantic air operations.|$|E
25|$|Poitier was {{the first}} male actor of African (Bahamian) descent to be {{nominated}} for a competitive Academy Award (for The Defiant Ones, 1958). He {{was also the first}} actor of African descent to win the Academy Award for Best Actor (for Lilies of the Field in 1963). (James Baskett {{was the first}} African American male to receive an Oscar, an Honorary Academy Award for his performance as Uncle Remus in the Walt Disney production of Song of the South in 1948, while Hattie McDaniel predated them both, winning as Best Supporting Actress for her role in 1939's Gone with the Wind, making her the first person of African descent to be nominated for and receive an Oscar). His satisfaction at this honor was undermined by his concerns that this award was more of the industry congratulating itself for having him as a token and it would inhibit him from <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> substantive considerations afterward. Poitier worked relatively little over the following year; he remained the only major actor of African descent and the roles offered were predominantly typecast as a soft-spoken appeaser.|$|E
25|$|With {{their success}} in Memphis, the AWA started to book them as well, having the Midnight Rockers split their time between Memphis and the AWA {{territory}} – in Memphis the Midnight Rockers were heels but in the AWA they were faces (good guys), something which was possible {{before the advent of}} national television deals and easy internet access. On December 27, 1987 The Midnight Rockers defeated The Original Midnight Express (Dennis Condrey and Randy Rose) for the AWA World Tag Team title. Since they had won the AWA World Tag Team titles, Jannetty and Michaels were forced to vacate the AWA Southern Tag Team titles in January 1988. While in the CWA, they had a brief feud with The Rock 'n' Roll Express over the AWA World Tag Team titles. After a short while in the AWA Jannetty and Michaels began <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> money and a guaranteed contract from owner Verne Gagne. When this request was denied the Midnight Rockers quit the AWA without having found another promotion for which to work. Before they left the promotion, they lost the AWA Tag Team Championship on March 19 to Badd Company (Pat Tanaka and Paul Diamond).|$|E

GameSpot's Jason Ocampo agreed, {{noting that the}} [...] "campaigns feature familiar plot twists", while praising the [...] "new twists" [...] on the Age of Empires series-style gameplay.

500|$|Stevens' signing had {{far-reaching}} ramifications on player {{contracts in}} the NHL. [...] At the time, the deal {{made him the}} highest-paid defenceman in the league. In addition, the deal included a $1.4 million signing bonus. Several defencemen considered superior players to Stevens, including Ray Bourque and Chris Chelios, were earning less money, and Capitals defenceman Kevin Hatcher held out until he received a contract {{similar to that of}} Stevens. [...] General managers worried that these players would begin demanding bigger contracts. [...] The players did end up <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> money, and this escalation was one of the factors in the 1994–95 NHL lockout several seasons later.|$|E

500|$|H. T. Wensel {{from the}} National Bureau of Standards, Tompkins, and W. Bradford Shank from the Los Alamos National Laboratory acted as {{technical}} advisers. Relations between MGM and the scientists soon soured, as the scientists began <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> accuracy which required [...] multiple script changes, and Tompkins eventually resigned. Oppenheimer sent David Hawkins, a philosophy professor from the University of California {{to act as}} a mediator between Marx and the scientists. Although the original intention was that a substantial sum of money would be donated to scientists' associations like the Federation of Atomic Scientists, in the end, no scientific organizations accepted any money. Tompkins received payment of one hundred dollars. [...] (...) [...] At the time, there was a legal requirement that permission be obtained to depict living well-known public figures in films. Lise Meitner, Niels Bohr and Sir James Chadwick all refused to allow their names to be used in The Beginning or the End, which Marx regarded as unfortunate, as it made the film's Manhattan Project scenes look like an all-American affair.|$|E
500|$|In May 1951 Weird Tales {{once again}} began to include reprints, {{in an attempt}} to reduce costs, but by that time the earlier issues of Weird Tales had been {{extensively}} mined for reprints by August Derleth's publishing venture, Arkham House, and as a result McIlwraith often reprinted lesser-known stories. [...] They were not advertised as reprints, which led in a couple of cases to letters from readers <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> stories from H. P. Lovecraft, whom they believed to be a new author.In Weinberg's opinion, the magazine lost variety under McIlwraith's editorship, and [...] "much of the uniqueness of the magazine was gone". [...] In Ashley's view, the magazine became more consistent in quality, rather than worse; Ashley comments that though the issues edited by McIlwraith [...] "seldom attain Wright's highpoints, they also omitted the lows". [...] L. Sprague de Camp, towards the end of McIlwraith's time as editor, agreed that the 1930s were the magazine's heyday, citing Wright's death and the departure for other, better-paying, markets of several of its contributors as factors in the magazine's decline.|$|E
500|$|Hollis was {{involved}} with Perfect Dark for the first 14 months of its three-year development cycle, during which progress was troubled and long delayed. He explained, [...] "each of us was <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>more</b> than the other could give. This situation ended with my departure, and with very deep regret I was unable to see Perfect Dark to completion". By the end of 1998, half of the team members, including Doak and Ellis, also left Rare to form Free Radical Design. What followed by those remaining on the project was a comprehensive re-design of the game, with the story and characters being the main items kept intact. Game designer Mark Edmonds was promoted to team leader because he was familiar {{with most of the}} game engine at the time. Rare also assigned more people to the development team, which eventually became three times bigger than GoldenEye 007s. The new team was [...] "uniquely shielded from the outside world" [...] and did not have a production manager, a schedule, meetings, or any sort of deadlines. According to artist B Jones, [...] "People would just do things they thought were cool and would work".|$|E
