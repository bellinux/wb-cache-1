The only true zoom lens for rangefinder cameras is the Contax G2 Carl Zeiss 35-70mm Vario-Sonnar T* Lens <b>with</b> built-in <b>zoom</b> viewfinder. A very few lenses, such as the Konica M-Hexanon Dual or Leica Tri-Elmar, let the user select among two or three focal lengths; the viewfinder must be designed to work with all focal lengths of any lens used. The rangefinder may become misaligned, leading to incorrect focusing.|$|R

Closest focusing distance is approximately 50 cm (19.2 inches).|$|R
50|$|Further, {{the use of}} {{triangular}} tiles {{has also}} been proposed for motion compensation. Under this scheme, the frame is tiled with triangles, and the next frame is generated by performing an affine transformation on these triangles. Only the affine transformations are recorded/transmitted. This is capable of dealing <b>with</b> <b>zooming,</b> rotation, translation etc.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a new <b>approach</b> for visualservoing <b>with</b> respect to a set of 3 D {{straight}} lines. The main di#erence with respect to previous approaches is that the new scheme can be used <b>with</b> a <b>zooming</b> camera or even if the reference image has been learned with a di#erent camera. The zoom is particularly useful {{in order to keep the}} visual features in the camera field of view and/or to bound their size in the image reducing the influence of noise on features extraction.
