25|$|The Walking Dead is {{a graphic}} adventure, played from a third-person {{perspective}} {{with a variety}} of cinematic camera angles, in which the player, as protagonist Lee Everett, works with a rag-tag group of survivors to stay alive {{in the midst of a}} zombie apocalypse. The player can examine and interact with characters and items, and must make use of inventory items and the environment. Throughout the game, the player is presented with the ability to interact with their surroundings, and options to determine the nature of that interaction. For example, the player may be able to look at a character, talk to that character, or if they are carrying an item, offer it to the character or <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> it. According to Robert Kirkman, The Walking Dead game is focused more on developing characters and story, and less on the action tropes that tend to feature in other zombie-based games, such as Left 4 Dead.|$|E
25|$|Many {{survivors}} found {{a temporary}} haven in the First Precinct station house. After a Brooklyn Eagle reporter found her dazed near the Washington Street entrance, Kate Claxton was taken there. Dressed only in thin theatrical garb, she {{huddled in the}} station house. The enormous disaster would occur to her only in small, incongruous pieces. Sitting quietly in Captain Smith's office, she would suddenly mourn for some lost article of clothing, her seal skin sacque or jewelry. Later on, the thought that {{she had lost her}} purse and was penniless would haunt her. From time to time people would enter and she would <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> H. S. Murdoch, the actor who had been on stage with her during her final minutes inside and who had rushed to his dressing room for outerwear. No one had seen him; she would beseech the person to go look for him. Eventually a waterproof cloak was found for her and she was driven to her rooms at Pierrepoint House.|$|E
500|$|However, {{in another}} interview, it was {{revealed}} that Douglas himself called the show's producers to <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> a guest appearance. [...] "I am a big fan of the show, so when the opportunity to guest-star came along, I had to grab it", Douglas said on his official website. [...] "It's been awhile since I've performed in front of a live audience, and it was great to flex that old theater acting muscle. It was also my first experience with a television sitcom." ...|$|E
50|$|The FOP {{distributes}} questionnaires {{for candidates}} for president and Congress <b>asking</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> their views on issues relating to police officers.|$|R
25|$|On 6 June, the Cotidianul {{newspaper}} conducted {{interviews with}} representatives of the five main political parties, <b>asking</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> their stance on same-sex marriage.|$|R
60|$|The farmer <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> their tour, {{and said}} he trusted {{that they would have}} a good time. Then Sam ventured to mention Songbird.|$|R
500|$|In {{interacting}} with other characters, Shadowrun allows the player to gain information using {{a bank of}} terms. Whenever Jake hears a new and unusual term, this word is highlighted and is then added to the bank that he can use; from that point on, when speaking with NPCs, Jake is able to <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> this new word; only in this manner can a player progress with the game. As {{the title of the}} game implies, Jake is described as a [...] "shadowrunner", a mercenary type of character common within the Shadowrun world. The player is given the option to hire other shadowrunners as henchmen with [...] "nuyen", the game's currency that {{can also be used to}} purchase guns and certain key items scattered throughout various locations.|$|E
2500|$|Clark's {{adoptive parents}} explain how {{they found him}} in a {{spacecraft}} in the second episode [...] "Strange Visitor (From Another Planet)" [...] and how they initially believed that {{he was part of}} an experiment when investigators <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> debris from a Russian space station. Clark later learns that he is from Krypton after finding the spacecraft in the custody of the secret government agency Bureau 39. Clark questions why he was abandoned, but later learns of Krypton's destruction through a series of messages left for him by Jor-El in the episode [...] "Foundling." [...] The series explored more of the history and culture of Krypton in a story arc that spanned the final episodes of the third season and the first episodes of the fourth.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few weeks}} before the game's launch, No Man's Sky was claimed to be using the superformula based on work done by Dr. Johan Gielis in 2003, and {{subsequently}} patented by Gielis under the Dutch company Genicap which Gielis founded and serves as Chief Research Officer. Murray had mentioned the superformula while describing the procedural generation aspects of the game in an interview with The New Yorker during development. Genicap anticipates developing a software tool using the superformula for their own product that they can see being used in video game development, which Hello Games would be infringing on if they had used the superformula in the game. The company states they have attempted to reach out to Hello Games to <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> its use for No Man's Sky but have not received anything back. Genicap said {{they did not want to}} stop the launch of No Man's Sky, considered the game to be [...] "very impressive", and that they would like to talk more with Hello Games to exchange knowledge with them, but [...] "if the formula is used we'll need to have a talk". Murray replied that No Man's Sky does not use the superformula, and was working to arrange a meeting with Genicap to discuss the situation and their respective mathematics.|$|E
50|$|Mike {{moves in}} with Katherine and {{she decides to}} throw a housewarming party. While {{inviting}} the women, they notice Susan and Katherine being very civil and Edie <b>asks</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> it.|$|R
50|$|A {{member of}} the {{audience}} is invited onto the floor as Paul Hendy <b>asks</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> their fear of (e.g. Oranges). They then enter the booth and stay in there for 30 seconds.|$|R
50|$|His riders {{were stopped}} by Khalid's army {{at the town}} of Buttah. Khalid <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> the signing of pact with Sajjah; {{they said it was}} just because they wanted revenge against their terrible enemies.|$|R
6000|$|... "The Morrison place," [...] mused Buster. [...] "I {{know that}} family. When I {{get a chance}} I am going to <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> this," [...] he added.|$|E
60|$|Paul Ruttledge. Do {{you want}} me? Well, Charlie, I will stay here, I won't go; but bring {{all the rest}} to see me, I want to <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> that vision.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then perhaps he's speculating in {{building}} lots; we deal in them," [...] Carmen rejoined with a laugh. [...] "I sometimes meet my father's friends, but don't <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> their business." ...|$|E
50|$|To {{start the}} show off, he gave each {{potential}} date a miniature interview, <b>asking</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> their hobbies and profession. After {{he talked to}} all six, Dave eliminated one man and one woman from the show.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, {{while working for}} Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, he cooperated with the FBI to help {{investigate}} a fraud case, and <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> the possibility of working for them as a career.|$|R
5000|$|Enforcer {{plays and}} {{performs}} {{in a style}} very similar to older speed metal bands like Agent Steel, Exciter and Anvil. When Sweden Rock Magazine <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> playing [...] "old school", they answered that heavy metal is not old school, it is timeless.|$|R
60|$|He {{decided that}} when he came {{alongside}} of the Broadway file he would get out, {{and go to the}} side door of the bakery and watch the men receiving the bread. Perhaps he would find courage to speak to them, and <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> themselves. At the time it did not strike him that it would be indecent.|$|E
60|$|Annie flushed at this {{intimate}} {{comment and}} suggestion {{from a woman}} whom as a girl she had never admitted to familiarity with her, but had tolerated {{her because she was}} such a harmless simpleton, and hung upon other girls whom she liked better. The word monument cowed her, however. She was afraid they might begin to talk about the soldiers' monument. She answered hastily, and began to <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> their families.|$|E
6000|$|... "If you're in earnest," [...] Hunterleys advised, [...] "you go to Washington and <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> it some day. The time's coming, if it hasn't already arrived, {{when your}} country {{will have to}} develop a {{different}} class of politicians. You see, whether she wants it or not, she is coming into touch, through Asia and South America, with European interests, and if she does, she'll have to adopt their methods more or less. Poor old Roche! There was something more he wanted to say, and if it's what I've been expecting, your country was in it." ...|$|E
5000|$|On the pilot, Nikki hooks {{her friends}} up to a lie {{detector}} and <b>asks</b> <b>them,</b> [...] "Do {{you want to have}} sex with me?" [...] The tests are done by John, an expert polygraph examiner. In the episode [...] "Already Wet", she does the tests with her parents and <b>asks</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> their sex life.|$|R
2500|$|Peter also opposed her {{in regard}} to these matters and <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> the Savior. [...] "Did he then speak {{secretly}} with a woman, in preference to us, and not openly? Are we to turn back and all listen to her? Did he prefer her to us?" ...|$|R
50|$|Universities {{and most}} {{societies}} {{would not accept}} women, but Ward obtained information any way she could. She wrote frequently to scientists, <b>asking</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> papers they had published. During 1848, Parsons was made President of the Royal Society, and visits to his London home meant that she met many scientists.|$|R
6000|$|... "So the {{children}} {{went into the}} garden and looked under the tree. They found two apples there, and they took them up and ate them--one apiece. Then they sat down and began to wait for their uncle to come. While they were waiting Anna proposed {{that they should not}} tell their uncle that they had found the two apples, and so he would give them three more, which he would take from the tree; whereas, if he knew that they had already had one apiece, then he would only give them two more. Ernest said that his uncle would <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> it. Anna said, 'No matter, we can tell him that we did not find any.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Then, {{at about}} 8.50 or 9, I {{leave them alone}} in the Chapel (which opens, as you know, into my sitting-room), and there they stay till past 10, talking over points among themselves, often two or three coming in to me, [...] "Bishop, we can't quite make out this." [...] What do they know and ask? Well, take such a subject as the second Psalm, and they will answer you, if you <b>ask</b> <b>them,</b> <b>about</b> prophecy and the prophetic state. Test them as to the idea they form of a spiritual vision of {{something}} seen, {{but not with the}} fleshly eye, and they will say, [...] "Yes, our minds have that power of seeing things. I speak of Mota, it is far off, but as I speak of it, I see my father and my mother and the whole place. My mind has travelled to it in an instant. I am there. Yes, I see. So David, so Moses, so St. Peter on the housetop, so St. Paul, caught up into the third heaven, so with his mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 25. There is {{a mighty}} feast at a Tory sheriff's to-day in the City: twelve hundred dishes of meat.--Above five lords, and several hundred gentlemen, will be there, and give {{four or five}} guineas apiece, {{according}} to custom. Dr. Coghill and I dined, by invitation, at Mrs. Van's. It has rained or mizzled all day, as my pockets feel. There are two new answers {{come out to the}} Conduct of the Allies. The last year's Examiners, printed together in a small volume, go off but slowly. The printer over-printed himself by at least a thousand; so soon out of fashion are party papers, however so well writ. The Medleys are coming out in the same volume, and perhaps may sell better. Our news about a cessation of arms begins to flag, and I have not these three days seen anybody in business to <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> it. We had a terrible fire last night in Drury Lane, or thereabouts, and three or four people destroyed. One of the maids of honour has the smallpox; but the best is, she can lose no beauty; and we have one new handsome maid of honour. Nite MD.|$|E
5000|$|Jeffrey Eugenides and Paul Auster {{both laughed}} when journalists <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> being {{some of the}} authors whose books are most shoplifted. [...] "It's {{one of those things}} authors argue about" [...] among themselves, Eugenides said, adding that he and Auster had {{discussed}} their status as authors of frequently stolen books.|$|R
5000|$|The Company {{received}} {{a demand for}} Government duty of 3d a mile as a result; evidently this took them by surprise for Thomas Grahame wrote to the Stockton and Darlington Railway directors <b>asking</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> the duty. Grainger described the operation as [...] "a springless coach with accommodation for thirty passengers".|$|R
5000|$|When the {{surviving}} {{members of the}} patrol returned to Medingen Mission Station, Rev. Reuter <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> their officers and, [...] "was told a confusing and contradictory story of what had happened". Decades later, Rev. Reuter's daughter recalled in a televised interview, [...] "My father roused on <b>them,</b> <b>asking</b> how they could leave their Captain like that." ...|$|R
50|$|The band also {{encounter}} Spinal Tap, who jokingly <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> {{the similarities}} between their album's covers.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{corruption}} scandals {{took place}} during the presidency of Cristina Kirchner, and other were revealed after it. The usual approach to those scandals was to completely ignore them, and make no mention about corruption whatsoever. This approach was abandoned after the decline of kirchnerite media, as independent reporters would usually <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> the scandals. The answers are always generic, and never address any specific details of the scandals.|$|E
50|$|Then we see Bolivar Trask telling Henry Peter Gyrich {{about his}} newest {{creation}} and a factory {{to build new}} Sentinels, he calls it Master Mold. Master mold is a huge Sentinel that creates smaller ones. Then Cameron Hodge and a government official named Leader come to <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> the revolt. Gyrich says he allowed it to happen to break the mutants' spirit. Then he tells them that Gambit had told them of the revolt.|$|E
5|$|Along with immense {{improvements}} to machinery and construction techniques over its six-year course, the war provided planners {{an opportunity to}} conduct a survey of 375,000drivers, <b>asking</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> their preferred route to travel to their destination. Using this information, a course was plotted from Windsor to Quebec, bypassing all towns along the way.|$|R
5000|$|At his trial, Hickman pleaded {{insanity}} as his {{motive for}} the crime, although he had initially told police that he needed the $1,500 ransom to attend a Bible college. Evidence against his insanity defense included prison guards from Oregon, who testified that Hickman had <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> [...] "how to act crazy." ...|$|R
