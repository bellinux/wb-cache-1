5|$|Bounded on each {{sides by}} {{military}} training grounds, the I-80 corridor is overflown by commercial airliners traveling west from Salt Lake City International Airport. The freeway veers north around the Cedar Mountains in <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>gap</b> {{between them and}} the Lakeside Mountains. Further east, the highway passes the Stansbury Mountains, which are located in the Wasatch-Cache National Forest. After the mountain ranges, the freeway arrives at the southern shore of the Great Salt Lake and closely follows the shore towards the western suburbs of Salt Lake City. However, the historical routes from which the route of I-80 was derived were routed further from the lake, passing through the towns of Grantsville and Tooele before crossing a bottleneck between the Oquirrh Mountains and Stansbury Island in the Great Salt Lake. These communities are now served by SR-138 and SR-36 respectively.|$|E
5|$|Giampaolo Caruso led {{the group}} into Ans and towards the {{climb to the}} finish. At {{the foot of the}} climb, Daniel Moreno, Caruso's teammate, {{attacked}} and built <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>gap</b> ahead of the group. The group did not initially chase him, as all the other riders looked for Valverde to do the work. Eventually Valverde did start to chase Moreno and caught him at the final bend. He opened his sprint from a long way out, with Joaquim Rodríguez (Katusha) right behind him. Rodríguez slowed as they approached the line, however, and Valverde took the victory. Julian Alaphilippe came around Rodríguez in the final metres to take second place.|$|E

5|$|Much as {{they had}} in {{previous}} stages, race leader Denis Menchov {{and the man in}} second place Danilo Di Luca stayed right with one another all through the climb, as Di Luca tried repeatedly to shed Menchov with attacks, but was unable to. Pellizotti, who had also been holding their wheels, took the opportunity with the two of them taking energy out of each other, to come clear and move into third position on the road. Basso, who was up the road, dutifully sat up and waited for his better-placed teammate and paced him to <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>gap</b> over Menchov and Di Luca before cracking. It was enough to ensure Pellizotti second on the stage, to keep him third in the overall classification. Di Luca managed to outsprint Menchov to the line and claim 8 bonus seconds to narrow his deficit to 18 seconds, but with only a flat stage and an individual time trial remaining the superior time trialist Menchov had the advantage.|$|E

At first {{they were unable to}} get anything to happen, but later noticed that the container was being removed to replace the object within. During one such event they took the opportunity to roll up a small ball of metal foil and drop it into the circular ring cut into the surface of the table that held the globe. This introduced <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>gap</b> under one edge, which they could blow into to cause the paper to move.|$|E
25|$|To {{achieve a}} loose patch clamp {{on a cell}} membrane, the pipette is moved slowly towards the cell, until the {{electrical}} resistance of the contact between the cell and the pipette increases to a few times greater resistance {{than that of the}} electrode alone. The closer the pipette gets to the membrane, the greater the resistance of the pipette tip becomes, but if too close a seal is formed, and it could become difficult to remove the pipette without damaging the cell. For the loose patch technique, the pipette does not get close enough to the membrane to form a gigaseal or a permanent connection, nor to pierce the cell membrane. The cell membrane stays intact, and the lack of a tight seal creates <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>gap</b> through which ions can pass outside the cell without entering the pipette.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} state's first {{connected}} {{state highway}} system, the Washington State Legislature designated the Sunset Highway between Seattle and Idaho in 1913. Later in 1915, the Legislature also designated the North Central Highway between Ellensburg and Davenport. The State Highway Board selected two routes that would partially connect the main cities of Western Washington to Eastern Washington and Idaho. In 1923, by which time the entire road had been improved and a new connection had filled in <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>gap,</b> the Sunset Highway became State Road 2 (Primary State Highway 2 after 1937), but retained its name. The North Central Highway became State Road 7 (Primary State Highway 7 after 1937), but retained its name. Another highway, named Primary State Highway 18 between George and Ritzville. By that time, most of the route of Interstate 90 became US 10, which was established in 1926. Until 1940, the route headed south from Seattle to Renton, then east to Issaquah, in order to travel around Lake Washington.|$|E

25|$|At 7.30am the {{infantry}} battalions set {{off from the}} east of the town; first the 2nd Battalion Royal Dublin Fusiliers, then the 1st King's Royal Rifle Corps and lastly the 1st Royal Irish Fusiliers (the 1st Leicestershire Regiment were left to guard the camp). The first part of the advance went well and they reached a small wood {{at the foot of the}} hill where they found some shelter but beyond the wood there was a wall with <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>gap</b> and then open ground. Some of the Dublins were pinned down in a ditch ahead and the Fusiliers were lining the wall to the left. Shortly after 9am Symons rode up to the wood being followed by an aide-de-camp holding up a red pennant, to find out why the attack had stalled. He ordered the men to proceed, rode through the wood and dismounted, then walked through the gap in the wall still being followed by his pennant. After a few moments he returned and was helped to remount his horse. He then rode back from the front lines until he was out of sight from his troops before he asked for assistance from the Indian stretcher bearers as he had been shot in the stomach.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} lap, Abt led from Lynn, who was {{followed}} in turn by, Bird, Vergne, Heidfeld, d'Ambrosio, Turvey, Sarrazin, Piquet, di Grassi, Rosenqvist, Duval, Carroll, Félix da Costa, Dillmann, Frijns, Gasly, Engel, Prost and Evans. Abt opted to conserve electrical energy, meaning he could not establish a large lead over both Virgin drivers. Lynn defended from teammate Bird but the latter grew frustrated over his manoeuvres. Bird was granted permission to pass Lynn at the second corner on the ninth lap. Vergne was overtaken by Heidfeld for fourth place at {{the end of the}} same lap. Abt was struggling with his brakes, and his team requested that he focus on restoring electrical energy. Bird used this handicap to his advantage and challenged him for the lead. Bird attempted to pass Abt twice on lap 14 but could not get past. Two laps later, Bird took the lead from Abt by aggressively turning to the inside of Abt at the turn five hairpin. Vergne and Heidfeld attacked Lynn who was struggling to manage his car's electrical energy. Heidfeld took advantage of <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>gap</b> left by Lynn to move in front of Lynn for third heading towards the turn two chicane on the 16th lap. Vergne passed Lynn to move into fourth place at the turn one hairpin on the next lap.|$|E
25|$|After the enroute {{navigation}} {{test flight}} was completed, the AAIB's test pilot flew several approaches to Campbeltown Airport {{with the same}} aircraft while investigators monitored its position on the radar equipment that was used {{the night of the}} accident. When the test aircraft flew the approach as indicated on the navigation chart that was found clipped to the pilot's control wheel, there was <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>gap</b> in radar coverage when the aircraft was at its most distant point from the airport, beginning at 10.1nm and ending on the return segment at 9.4nm from the MAC VOR. Other trials were conducted at lower altitudes, and in those trials the coverage gap was widened considerably. Investigators tried approaches at low and descending altitudes involving a steeper left turn to 157° (where the heading bug was set on the HSI), and then flying that heading until intercepting the correct course to the MAC VOR. When this track was flown at 1,400 feet, the last radar contact was at 7.9nm from the MAC VOR. The last radar contact with the accident flight was at 8.1nm from the MAC VOR, at an altitude of 1,340 feet. Flying this track with the accident flight's known and projected descent profile brought the test aircraft to within 0.2nm of the crash site at an altitude of 200 feet, which was within the margin of error for the differences in wind {{on the day of the}} accident and on the day of the test flight.|$|E
