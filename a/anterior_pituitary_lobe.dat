In addition, the bone marrow of hypophysectomized dogs was cultivated in using the plasma of normal and hypophysectomized dogs separately, cortisone was added to each preparate. The results obtained are as follows: (1) Adrenalin eosinopeia is due to its direct influence upon the eosinophil partly through the pituitary body. (2) ACTH acts as glucocorticoid in ACTH cosinopenia. This brings about the similar result to cortisone eosinopenia.

40|$|To assess {{pituitary}} vascularization {{in children}} with hypopituitarism, central diabetes insipidus (DI), or Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Dynamic MR images were obtained through the pituitary stalk after injection of gadopentetate dimeglumine in 21 patients (11 boys and 10 girls, aged 4 - 17 years) and 10 age-matched control subjects.

40|$|The {{histological}} {{distribution of}} gonaclotrophs containing either LH or FSH, but not both gonadotropins, {{has been demonstrated}} before in the juvenile and adult chicken throughout the caudal and cephalic <b>anterior</b> <b>pituitary</b> <b>lobes.</b> In the present investigation, the distribution of FSH- and/or LH-containing gonadotrophs was further investigated in the chicken embryo by use of the same homologous antibodies as used in our earlier study. Fluorescent dual-labeling immunohistochemistry revealed that during embryogenesis LH and FSH reside exclusively in separate gonadotrophs, as has been described before in the post hatch bird. LH-immunoreactive cells were observed {{for the first time}} at day 9 of embryogenesis. This is as much as 4 days earlier than the FSH-immunoreactive cells, which appeared at day 13 of embryogenesis. Our results confirm that FSH- and LH-containing gonadotrophs are distributed throughout both <b>lobes</b> of the <b>anterior</b> <b>pituitary.</b> No conspicuous differences were observed between the sexes in any of the aspects investigated. The described situation is unique in that it seems to imply the existence of separate cell lineages for FSH-and LH-producing cells, as opposed to the single gonadotrope lineage described in all other species studied so far, with the exception of bovine. Our data indeed raise the question as to which signaling and/or transcription factors may cause the unique dichotomy observed in the chicken gonadotrophs. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

40|$|Raloxifene is a {{selective}} estrogen receptor modulator with a benzothiophene structure, that exerts an estrogen-like action on some target tissues and an anti-estrogenic {{action on the}} uterus and breasts. A limited number of data {{are available on the}} effect of raloxifene on neuroendocrine function. Since beta-endorphin (beta-EP) is considered a marker of neuroendocrine function, the aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the effects of a 14 day treatment with a raloxifene analog, LY 117018, on beta-EP content in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, <b>anterior</b> and neuro-intermediate <b>pituitary</b> <b>lobe,</b> and in the plasma of fertile and ovariectomized (ovx) rats. The effect of LY 117018 in ovx rats was compared to that of 17 beta-estradiol. beta-EP contents were measured by a specific radioimmunoassay. While ovariectomy determined a significant decrease in beta-EP levels in the <b>anterior</b> and neurointermediate <b>pituitary</b> <b>lobe</b> and plasma (p < 0. 01), no changes of beta-EP content in the hypothalamus and hippocampus were found. The administration of 17 beta-estradiol or LY 117018 in ovx rats significantly increased beta-EP concentration in the <b>anterior</b> and neurointermediate <b>pituitary</b> <b>lobe,</b> in the hypothalamus and plasma (p < 0. 01), though they did not significantly modify hippocampal beta-EP content. When LY 117018 was administered together with 17 beta-estradiol in ovx animals, a clear anti-estrogenic effect in all organs and in plasma was observed, resulting in significantly lower beta-EP content with respect to the group treated with 17 beta-estradiol alone (p < 0. 01). The chronic administration of LY 117018 in fertile rats significantly decreased beta-EP content in the <b>anterior</b> <b>pituitary,</b> hippocampus and plasma (p < 0. 01), while it increased beta-EP hypothalamic content and did not change beta-EP content in the neurointermediate lobe.

Adrenalectomy did not alter hypothalamic levels of either peptide, or ir-βEP in neuro-intermediate lobe, in which tissue ir-ACTH was below detection limit at routine dilutions. Dexamethasone (0. 2 - 200 μg/d) concurrently suppressed plasma ir-ACTH and ir-βEP, with a near maximal effect at 20 μg, and a half-maximal effect between 2 and 6 μg; similar dose-response characteristics {{were found for}} thymolysis. Step-wise increases in <b>anterior</b> <b>pituitary</b> content of both peptides were found, with no change in hypothalamic levels of either peptide, or neuro-intermediate lobe ir-βEP. 9 α-fluorocortisol (0. 2 - 200 μg/d) produced plasma, <b>anterior</b> <b>pituitary,</b> and hypothalamic effects equivalent to dexamethasone, but with one-tenth the potency.

40|$|Under {{physiological}} conditions, {{the production}} of cortisol is tightly regulated by the so-called hypothalamuspituitary- adrenal (HPA) axis (Figure 1 a). Adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) producing cells in the <b>anterior</b> <b>pituitary</b> <b>lobe</b> respond to the hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) by increasing the transcription of the pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene.

By binding to its receptor (the melanocortin type 2 receptor; MC 2 R), ACTH induces the expression of several steroidogenic enzymes in the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex that are required for the biosynthesis of cortisol, including CYP 17 A 1 and CYP 11 B 1 4. MC 2 R activation also triggers phosphorylation of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STAR), which facilitates cholesterol transport over the mitochondrial inner membrane.

50|$|The {{pituitary}} gland is formed within the rostral neural plate.

40|$|Conference Theme: Special Neuroendocrine SystemsThis review {{summarizes}} the recent {{findings on the}} effects of endocrine manipulation on the hypothalamic and pituitary contents of met-enkephalin and β-endorphin. In the pituitary, gonadectomy decreases β-endorphin content in both the anterior lobe and neuro-intermediate lobe. Orchidectomy results in a decrease while ovariectomy leads to an increase in anterior lobe met-enkephalin contents. Adrenalectomy only leads to an increase in β-endorphin contents in the <b>anterior</b> <b>pituitary</b> <b>lobe.</b> Hypothyroidism induced by propylthiouracil treatment is accompanied by a decrease of β-endorphin in the neuro-intermediate lobe and a decrease in met-enkephalin in the anterior lobe while thyroidectomy entails a decrease in met-enkephalin in the anterior lobe only. Chemically induced diabetes mellitus results in a decrease in β-endorphin content in the hypothalamus and the neurointermediate lobe, and a reduction in met-enkephalin level in the anterior and neuro-intermediate lobes. All these changes are reversible with appropriate hormone treatments.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Pituitary cysts {{are common}} {{findings}} on pathologic exami-nation and imaging studies. They are {{generally considered to}} be rarer in children than in adults; however, no good data exist to substantiate this opinion. We reviewed MR imaging studies to evaluate the frequency and imaging features of pituitary cysts in children. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed T 1 -weighted sagittal images in 341 patients < 15 years of age to evaluate for pituitary cysts. Paramagnetic contrast was administered in 86 of the 341 patients. Sagittal or coronal fast spin-echo T 2 -weighted images were performed in 166 patients. For patients having pituitary cysts, pituitary function was examined by assessing blood levels of pituitary hormones. RESULTS: A cystic pituitary lesion was recognized in 4 patients (1. 2 %) aged 1 – 4 years.

In the neurointermediate lobe, stalk transection reduced the GluDCase activity by more than 95 %. By using an antiserum to rat brain GluDCase and the unlabeled antibody [...] peroxidase method of Sternberger, GluDCase immunoreactivity was localized in many terminals within the neurointermediate lobe of the hypophysis.

B-EP concentrations were significantly increased by desogestrel in the anterior lobe and by progesterone, desogestrel and medroxyprogesterone acetate in the neurointermediate lobe. Progesterone and progestins significantly reduced B-EP increase induced by estradiol benzoate in the anterior lobe. Estradiol benzoate treatment did not modify the effect of progesterone and desogestrel on B-EP in the neuro-intermediate <b>pituitary</b> <b>lobe.</b> Norethisterone acetate and progesterone increased B-EP concentrations in the medial-basal hypothalamus, while the other steroids were inactive. In contrast, in the hypothalamus all progestins attenuated the increase of B-EP induced by estradiol benzoate (p less than 0. 01). These data indicate that progesterone and progestins modulate the hypothalamic and pituitary B-EP concentrations in concert with estrogens.

40|$|Background: The sellar and parasellar {{region is}} an area where many {{heterogenous}} neoplastic, inflammatory, developmental and vascular pathologies can occur. Differentiation among various diseases may be not easy, because many of these lesions could mimic the clinical, endocrinologic and radiologic features of pituitary adenomas, which can be the cause of possible misdiagnosis. Case Report: We report a case of a 52 -year-old man who presented with a persistent headache for the last 5 – 6 years and visual disturbances. Endocrine system examinations disclosed only insignificant hyperprolactinaemia. The MRI revealed an hypointense area – its presentation was similar to that of pituitary adenoma.

40|$|Pituitary {{tissue is}} rarely {{to be found}} among the {{constituents}} of ovarian teratomas (dermoid cysts).

We describe a unique example of lymphocytic hypophysitis incidentally encountered in a mature left ovarian teratoma from a 30 -year-old woman in the 19 th week of pregnancy. Amidst various fully differentiated derivatives of all three embryonic layers, the cyst wall also included a miniature replica of the <b>anterior</b> <b>pituitary</b> <b>lobe</b> 0. 5 cm in diameter. While a full set of adenohypophyseal hormone-producing cell types could be identified, there was characteristic pregnancy-related hyperplasia of lactotrophs. This was further overlaid by prominent mononuclear inflammation, including infiltration by T lymphocytes, follicular aggregates of B cells, and attendant destruction of parenchyma. There was no significant inflammatory reaction elsewhere. Discounting the non-standard location, the ensemble of the clinical setting and histology were felt to be indistinguishable from the classical paradigm of lymphocytic hypophysitis complicating pregnancy. To date, lymphocytic thyroiditis is the sole form of organ-specific inflammatory process within an ovarian teratoma on record.

40|$|Abstract: The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) plays a {{fundamental}} role in regulating various biological activities. Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L 1 (UCH-L 1) is a deubiquitinating enzyme, {{belonging to the}} UPS. To date, {{it has been reported that}} UCH-L 1 is highly and restrictedly expressed in neural and reproductive tissues and plays significant roles in these organs. Although the expression of UCH-L 1 in the anterior pituitary gland has been reported, the detailed localization and the role of UCH-L 1 remain obscure. In the present study, we detected UCH-L 1 protein exclusively in hormone-producing cells, but not non-hormone producing folliculostellate cells in the <b>anterior</b> <b>pituitary</b> <b>lobe.</b> In addition, the cytoplasmic expression of UCH-L 1 varied and was limited to gonadotropes and mammotropes. To investigate the role of UCH-L 1 in anterior pituitary cells, we performed a comparative analysis using genetically UCH-L 1 -deficient gad mice. Significant decreases in the numbers of gonadotropes and mammotropes were observed in gad mice, suggesting a close involvement of UCH-L 1 in these cells. Moreover, we also determined the expression of UCH-L 1 in cultured gonadotropes. Taken together, this is the first report to definitely demonstrate the presence of UCH-L 1 in mouse anterior pituitary gland, and our results might provide a novel insight for better understanding the role of UCH-L 1 in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and in the reproduction...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Little {{information}} {{is available on the}} circadian sequela of an immune challenge in the brain of aged rats. To assess them, we studied 24 -hour rhythms in hypothalamic and striatal norepinephrine (NE) content, hypothalamic and striatal dopamine (DA) turnover and hypophysial NE and DA content, in young (2 months) and aged (18 – 20 months) rats killed at 6 different time intervals, on day 18 th after Freund's adjuvant or adjuvant's vehicle administration. Results Aging decreased anterior and medial hypothalamic NE content, medial and posterior hypothalamic DA turnover, and striatal NE concentration and DA turnover. Aging also decreased NE and DA content in pituitary neurointermediate lobe and augmented DA content in the <b>anterior</b> <b>pituitary</b> <b>lobe.</b> Immunization by Freund's adjuvant injection caused: (i) reduction of DA turnover in anterior hypothalamus and corpus striatum; (ii) acrophase delay of medial hypothalamic DA turnover in old rats, and of striatal NE content in young rats; (iii) abolition of 24 -h rhythm in NE and DA content of neurointermediate pituitary lobe, and in DA content of anterior lobe, of old rats. Conclusions The decline in catecholamine neurotransmission with aging could contribute to the decrease of gonadotropin and increase of prolactin release reported in similar groups of rats. Some circadian responses to immunization, e. g. suppression of 24 -h rhythms of neurointermediate lobe NE and DA and of anterior lobe DA were seen only in aged rats. </p...|$|E
40|$|Most data on {{effects of}} natural and {{synthetic}} cannabinoids on <b>anterior</b> <b>pituitary</b> hormone secretion point out to a primary impact on the hypothalamus. There is also some evidence, however, of possible direct actions of these compounds on the <b>anterior</b> <b>pituitary,</b> although the presence of cannabinoid receptors in the pituitary has not been documented as yet. In the present study, we evaluated the presence of cannabinoid CB(1) receptor-mRNA transcripts in the pituitary gland by in situ hybridization. We observed CB(1) receptor-mRNA transcripts in the <b>anterior</b> <b>pituitary</b> {{and to a lesser}} extent in the intermediate lobe whereas they were absent in the neural lobe. We then examined whether CB(1) receptor-mRNA levels in both <b>pituitary</b> <b>lobes</b> responded to chronic activation by a specific agonist, as did receptors located in adjacent hypothalamic nuclei and in other brain regions. Daily administration of CP- 55, 940 for 18 days produced a small, but statistically significant paradoxical increase in CB(1) receptor-mRNA levels in the <b>anterior</b> <b>pituitary,</b> with no changes in the intermediate lobe, in contrast to reduced CB(1) receptor-mRNA levels observed in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMN), and to decreased CB(1) receptor binding in the VMN and the arcuate nucleus. The time-course of up-regulation of CB(1) receptor-mRNA transcripts in the anterior lobe was biphasic; daily administration of Delta(9) -tetrahydrocannabinol produced an early and marked decrease in CB(1) receptor-mRNA levels after 1 and 3 days, followed by normalization after 7 days and by a small increase after 14 days. We also checked whether endogenous cannabinoid ligands are present in the <b>anterior</b> <b>pituitary</b> and the hypothalamus. Although anandamide itself was detected only in trace amounts, concentrations of its precursor N-arachidonoyl-phosphatidyl-ethanolamine and of 2 -arachidonoyl-glycerol were found in both tissues, suggesting that endocannabinoids may be synthetized in the <b>anterior</b> <b>pituitary.</b> In summary, CB(1) receptors and corresponding ligands seem to be expressed in cells of the anterior and intermediate <b>lobes</b> of the <b>pituitary,</b> but the response of CB(1) receptor-mRNA transcripts in the anterior lobe to chronic agonist activation is different than the desensitization observed in hypothalamic nuclei...|$|R
40|$|The {{existence}} of independent control mechanisms of beta-endorphin (beta-EP) secretion from the anterior (AP) and intermediate (NIL) <b>pituitary</b> <b>lobes</b> is now ascertained. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the effect of surgical separation from the hypothalamus of the two <b>pituitary</b> <b>lobes</b> on beta-EP secretion. Two experimental models of surgical hypothalamo-pituitary disconnection were used: 1) rats with ablation of the medial basal hypothalamus (MBH); 2) rats bearing two entire ectopic <b>pituitaries</b> or two <b>anterior</b> <b>pituitaries</b> (APs) only, transplanted under the kidney capsule. In rats with MBH-ablation plasma beta-EP levels were significantly higher than in sham-operated controls. Plasma beta-EP levels increased in rats transplanted with entire pituitaries 3 days after surgery and were still elevated after 1 week. In rats transplanted with APs only, no significant beta-EP changes in plasma were evident. In both experimental conditions no significant difference was present in beta-LPH plasma levels. Concentrations of beta-EP in the ectopic NILs decreased gradually after transplantation. In all these results indicate that that NIL but not the AP is capable, when is disconnected from the hypothalamus, or secreting autonomously beta-EP...|$|R
40|$|Leukemia {{inhibitory}} factor (LIF) and LIF receptors {{are expressed}} in adenohypophyseal cells and LIF regulates pituitary hormone transcription and cell replication in vitro. Therefore, transgenic mice expressing pituitary-directed LIF driven by the rat growth hormone (GH) promoter were generated to evaluate the impact of LIF on pituitary development. Three founders were established with diminished linear growth and body weight (57 - 65 % of wild type [WT]), and intense <b>anterior</b> <b>pituitary</b> LIF immunoreactivity. Cystic cavities observed in <b>pituitary</b> <b>anterior</b> <b>lobes</b> were lined by cuboidal, ciliated epithelial cells, focally immunopositive for cytokeratin and S- 100 protein and immunonegative for adenohypophyseal hormones. Transgenic pituitaries showed decreased GH (40 %) and prolactin (PRL) (26 %) cells, and decreased GH and PRL mRNAs by in situ hybridization. ACTH cells increased 2. 2 -fold, whereas gonadotrophs and thyrotrophs were unchanged. Serum GH was undetectable (< 0. 78 ng/ml), PRL levels were one third of WT (P < 0. 05), IGF-I levels were 30 % of WT (P < 0. 001), and T 4 was normal. 10 human pituitary Rathke's cysts studied all showed conclusive LIF immunoreactivity in cyst-lining cells. Thus, intrapituitary murine LIF overexpression causes cystic invaginations from the anterior wall of Rathke's cleft, suggesting failed differentiation of Rathke's epithelium to hormone-secreting cells. Arrested murine pituitary maturation with formation of pituitary Rathke's cleft cysts, GH deficiency, and short stature provide a model to study human Rathke's cyst pathogenesis...|$|R
