5|$|In December 2007, the United States {{entered the}} longest post–World War II recession, which {{included}} a housing market correction, a subprime mortgage crisis, soaring oil prices, and a declining dollar value. In February, 63,000 jobs were lost, a five-year record. To aid with the situation, Bush signed a $170billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many Americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses. The Bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of Fannie Mae <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> <b>Mac</b> in 2003, and after two years, the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate. Many Republican senators, as well as influential members of the Bush Administration, feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector's risky practices. In September 2008, the crisis became much more serious beginning with the government takeover of Fannie Mae <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> <b>Mac</b> followed {{by the collapse of}} Lehman Brothers and a federal bailout of American International Group for $85billion.|$|E

When Beck asked Bevin about the issue during an interview, Bevin said {{the content of the}} report had been written by the fund's chief investment officer, and that he had only signed it because he was legally required to do so as president of the fund. Later, Bevin added that he had not physically signed the letter, but that his signature was added to the document digitally. Lawyers interviewed by the Lexington Herald-Leader said it would have been legal for Bevin to change the content of the letter, but not the accompanying facts and financial data. The Herald-Leader further noted that Bevin had not signed some previous investor letters. His campaign offered no explanation for the inconsistency.|$|E

Fannie Mae <b>and</b> smaller <b>Freddie</b> <b>Mac</b> owned or guaranteed a massive proportion of all home loans in the United States and so were especially hard hit by the slump.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} policy {{response}} to the 2007 – 09 financial crisis {{from the perspective of}} a senior Treasury official at the time. Government agencies faced severe constraints in addressing the crisis: lack of legal authority for potentially helpful financial stabilization measures, a Congress reluctant to grant such authority, and the need to act quickly in the midst of a market panic. Treasury officials recognized the dangers arising from mounting foreclosures and worked to facilitate limited mortgage modifications, but going further was politically unacceptable because public funds would have gone to some irresponsible borrowers. The suddenness of Bear Stearns’ collapse in March 2008 made rescue necessary and led to preparation of emergency options should conditions worsen. The Treasury saw Fannie Mae <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> <b>Mac’s</b> rescue that summer as necessary to calm markets, despite the moral hazard created. After Lehman Brothers failed in September, the Treasury genuinely intended to buy illiquid securities from troubled institutions but turned to capital injections as the crisis deepened. ...|$|R

The bill, {{if it were}} passed, would modify the budgetary treatment of federal credit programs, such as Fannie Mae <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> <b>Mac.</b> The bill would require {{that the cost of}} direct loans or loan guarantees be recognized in the federal budget on a fair-value basis using guidelines set forth by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. The changes made by the bill would mean that Fannie Mae <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> <b>Mac</b> were counted on the budget instead of considered separately and would mean that the debt of those two programs would be included in the national debt. These programs themselves would not be changed, but how they are accounted for in the United States federal budget would be. The goal of the bill is to improve the accuracy of how some programs are accounted for in the federal budget.|$|E
25|$|Fannie Mae <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> <b>Mac</b> {{were allowed}} to hold less capital than normal {{financial}} institutions: e.g., they {{were allowed to}} sell mortgage-backed securities with only half as much capital backing them up as would be required of other financial institutions. Regulations exist through the FDIC Bank Holding Company Act that govern the solvency of financial institutions. The regulations require normal financial institutions to maintain a capital/asset ratio {{greater than or equal to}} 3%. The GSEs, Fannie Mae <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> <b>Mac,</b> are exempt from this capital/asset ratio requirement and can, and often do, maintain a capital/asset ratio less than 3%. The additional leverage allows for greater returns in good times, but put the companies at greater risk in bad times, such as during the subprime mortgage crisis. FNMA is not exempt from state and local taxes. In addition, FNMA and FHLMC are exempt from SEC filing requirements; they file SEC 10-K and 10-Q reports, but many other reports, such as certain reports regarding their REMIC mortgage securities, are not filed.|$|E

50|$|He {{testified in}} favor of {{stronger}} legislation several times and gave numerous speeches which were well chronicled. These efforts were strongly supported by President Bush and Treasury Secretary Paulson. Reform legislation {{was passed by the}} House in May 2007 just as what was then considered only a “subprime crisis” was starting to appear. The Senate, however, did not pass the legislation, entitled the Housing and Economic Recovery Act (HERA) until July 2008. President Bush, who had called for GSE reform throughout his Presidency, signed HERA into law in an Oval Office ceremony on July 30. However, HERA was passed too late as stock market, foreign debt and mortgage-backed securities investors worried about their solvency. Lockhart had pushed both GSE’s to raise more capital for over a year and in March got their Boards to agree to raise significant equity. The new Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) combined OFHEO; the Federal Housing Board, which regulated the 12 Federal Home Loan Banks; and the HUD group that oversaw Fannie Mae's <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> <b>Mac's</b> mission <b>and</b> affordable housing goals. Lockhart became the first director of the new agency and Chairman of its Oversight Board, whose other members were the Secretaries of Treasury and HUD and the Chairman of the SEC.|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "GAO reviewed whether the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) should incorporate new business assumptions into the stress test used to establish risk-based capital requirements. The stress test is designed to estimate, for a 10 -year period, how much capital the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (<b>Freddie</b> <b>Mac)</b> {{would be required to}} hold to withstand potential economic shocks, such as sharp movements in interest rates or adverse credit conditions. Incorporating new business assumptions into the stress test would mean specifying details about the types and quality that would be acquired during the 10 -year stress period, the types of funding that would be used to acquire such mortgages, and other operating and financial strategies that would be implemented by Fannie Mae's <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> <b>Mac's</b> managements. GAO found that data for the enterprises show that new business conducted over a 10 -year period accounts for a large share of their on- and off-balance sheet holdings of assets and liabilities {{at the end of each}} 10 -year period. Because new business represents such a large share of enterprise holdings over time, it would have a major impact on the enterprises' financial condition, risks, and capital adequacy in the face of stressful events. However, determining the appropriate new business assumptions to include in the model would be difficult and inherently speculative. with OFHEO having to develop plausible scenarios for how enterprise management and the market would respond in a stressful environment. OFHEO can use supervisory review, which includes examination of the enterprises' ongoing business activities and enforcement actions, and should work in conjunction with the capital requirement to help ensure the safety and soundness of the enterprises. ...|$|R
