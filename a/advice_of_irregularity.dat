40|$|A {{numerical}} {{investigation has}} been conducted to {{determine the influence of}} Representative Volume Element (RVE) size and degree <b>of</b> <b>irregularity</b> <b>of</b> polymer foam microstructure on its compressive mechanical properties, including stiffness, plateau stress and onset strain of densification. Periodic two-dimensional RVEs have been generated using a Voronoi-based numerical algorithm and compressed. Importantly, self-contact of the foam’s internal microstructure has been incorporated through the use of shell elements, allowing simulation of the foam well into the densification stage of compression; strains of up to 80 percent are applied. Results suggest that the stiffness of the foam RVE is relatively insensitive to RVE size but tends to soften as the degree <b>of</b> <b>irregularity</b> increases. Both the shape of the plateau stress and the onset strain of densification are sensitive to both the RVE size and degree <b>of</b> <b>irregularity.</b> Increasing the RVE size and decreasing the degree <b>of</b> <b>irregularity</b> both tend to result in a decrease of the gradient of the plateau region, while increasing the RVE size and degree <b>of</b> <b>irregularity</b> both tend to decrease the onset strain of densification. Finally, a method of predicting the onset strain of densification to an accuracy of about 10 per cent, while reducing the computational cost by two orders of magnitude is suggested...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. State of {{railway track}} {{must meet the}} {{conditions}} of safety, comfort and smooth ride. The presence <b>of</b> <b>irregularities</b> deteriorates the dynamics of interaction of track and rolling stock, causes speed limiting, creates the possibility of movement safety violation. This brings up the question concerning {{the study of the}} factors leading to the possibility <b>of</b> track <b>irregularities</b> and the process of their development. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyse the processes of emergence and development <b>of</b> <b>irregularities</b> in the area of unequal vertical elasticity of railway track using mathematical modelling. Methodology. Railroad under the trains works as the system of elastic bodies, so the emergence and development <b>of</b> <b>irregularities</b> can be represented as the transition from elastic to permanent strain. Irregularity development will affect the dynamics of interaction between track and rolling stock not only at the wheel location directly in the area <b>of</b> <b>irregularity,</b> but also at a certain distance beyond. Therefore, to study the development <b>of</b> <b>irregularities,</b> including those along the track, it is necessary to model the process of wheel load movement along the area. The adopted model consists of a wheel set moving on inertia-free beam and resting on individual supports. It is described by Lagrange differential equations. The work introduced the hypothesis that the level of permanent strain is distributed in proportion to the dynamic deflection derivative. Findings. Location <b>of</b> vertical longwise <b>irregularity</b> does not necessarily reproduce the location of the problem area. While in operation the vertical irregularity extends not only in depth but also along the track, herewith the increase in length is accompanied by the displacement of local maxima and the emergence of new ones. This leads to the development of so-called «pits» when approaching unequal-elastic areas. Originality. The work provides further development of tasks for track and rolling stock interaction modelling, in particular aimed to take into account the unequal elasticity areas and their influence on the formation <b>of</b> the track <b>irregularities.</b> The paper proposes new approaches to modelling the transition from elastic to permanent strain that allows predicting the development <b>of</b> track <b>irregularity</b> sizes depending on the area characteristics. Practical value. The results obtained by the author can be used to determine the schedule for track equal elasticity renovation works, as well as to analyse the measures aimed at the prevention <b>of</b> <b>irregularities</b> in areas with variable elasticity of railway track...|$|R

40|$|In {{contrast}} to {{the way that the}} spreading <b>of</b> <b>irregularities</b> in a plasma is usually considered, the diffusion spreading <b>of</b> <b>irregularities</b> stretched along the geomagnetic field B is examined using a three-dimensional rigorous numerical model of quasi-neutral diffusion {{in the presence of a}} magnetic field, in conjunction with the actual height variations of the diffusion and conductivity tensors in the ionosphere. A comparison with the earlier constructed approximate model of unipolar diffusion was made. As in the previous case, the same peculiarities <b>of</b> <b>irregularity</b> spreading in the inhomogeneous background ionospheric plasma were observed. The accuracy of the approximate model for describing the process of spreading <b>of</b> anisotropic ionospheric <b>irregularities</b> is established. Time relaxation effects of real heating-induced ionospheric irregularities on their scale transverse to B are presented using the approximate analytical model for the case of a quasi-homogeneous ionospheric plasma. The calculated results have a vivid physical meaning and can be directly compared with experimental data on the radiophysical observations <b>of</b> artificial heating-induced <b>irregularities</b> created by powerful radio waves in the ionosphere...|$|R

40|$|The {{nature and}} {{movements}} <b>of</b> ionospheric <b>irregularities</b> at E- and F-region heights are considered. Experimental evidence from a mid-latitude station is discussed {{which suggests that}} the night-time irregularities which produce the spread-F, spread-E 8 or sporadic-E-cloud features on ionograms represent a class <b>of</b> <b>irregularities</b> which are frontal disturbances. These have quasi-sinusoidal cross sections at F-region heights. Wavelengths range from 25 to 350 km and periods range from 5 to 60 min. Their characteristics indicate that they may be produced by internal gravity waves propagating through the ionospheric regions. These night-time irregularities are somewhat similar to daytime travelling ionospheric disturbances which have been in the past, associated, by certain workers, with internal gravity waves. Another class <b>of</b> <b>irregularities,</b> with dimensions <b>of</b> the order of a kilometre, appear to be responsible for the fading patterns from which ionospheric drifts are calculated. When the movements of the two classes <b>of</b> <b>irregularities</b> are compared a certain amount of agreement is evident.
