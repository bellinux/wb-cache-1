40|$|The last decade, {{a lot of}} {{attention}} is given to adaptive methods based on artificial neural networks, which can significantly improve the symptom interpretation and system performance in case of malfunctioning. Such methods are especially considered in cases where no explicit algorithms or models for the problem under investigation exist. In such problems, automatic interpretation of faulty symptoms with the use of artificial neural network classifiers is recommended. Two different models of artificial neural networks, the extended back-propagation and the radial basis function, integrated in a hybrid system, where an expert mechanism supervises them, are discussed and applied with appropriate simulations to the diagnosis of a subprocess of the <b>alkali-cellulose</b> preparation process...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The main methods {{applied to}} clean plant {{material}} for radiocarbon dating are not compound-specific and gen-erally remove only the easily exchangeable components by an acid-base-acid sequence and additional optional steps like Soxhlet extraction to remove resins and oxidative bleaching with NaClO 2. The products are normally clean enough for stan-dard 14 C measurement, {{but in some}} cases it is desirable to have pure cellulose, which remains unchanged and immobile over longer time ranges, better representing the original plant material. In this work, 2 more compound-specific but still simple methods were tested to separate the cellulose from wood. The viscose method is based on the xanthification process used in the textile industry, where the <b>alkali-cellulose</b> with CS 2 forms a soluble cellulose xanthate, which is then extracted and cellu-lose is recovered. The second procedure is based on the wood/cellulose dissolution in ionic liquid 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazo-lium chloride [BMIM]Cl, when the dissolved cellulose could be precipitated again by simply adding a water-acetone mixture. This process was recently reported, but still not used in sample preparation procedures for 14 C dating...|$|E
