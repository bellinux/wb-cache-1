50|$|There are {{two major}} types of {{pavement}} surfaces - Portland cement concrete (PCC) and hot-mix asphalt (HMA). Underneath this wearing course are material layers that give structural support for the pavement system. These underlying surfaces may include either the aggregate base and subbase layers, or treated base and subbase layers, and additionally the underlying natural or treated subgrade. These treated layers may be cement-treated, <b>asphalt-treated,</b> or lime-treated for additional support.|$|E
40|$|Asphalt {{pavement}} with semi-rigid {{base has}} been widely used in China. After {{more than ten years}} of applications, there were some performance related problems with the use of semi-rigid base. The research presented in this paper is a comparison study on the performances of semi-rigid base and <b>asphalt-treated</b> base, in an effort to determine if <b>asphalt-treated</b> base may provide better result In this paper, the relationship between tensile stress at the bottom of base under traffic load is presented for the two different bases. The result shows that tensile stress at base bottom has a linear relationship with load weight The fatigue characteristics of <b>asphalt-treated</b> base and semi-rigid base are analysed and the results are also discussed. The analysis shows that for pavement with semi-rigid base, it is effective to use thick base to increase pavement life. For pavement with <b>asphalt-treated</b> base, subgrade can be strengthened to increase pavement life. Pavements with <b>asphalt-treated</b> base are more effective to stand excessive over-weight vehicles. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Behavior of {{granular}} material subjected to repeated load triaxial compression tests {{is characterized by}} a model based on rate process theory. Starting with the Arrhenius equation from chemical kinetics, the relationship of temperature, shear stress, normal stress and volume change to deformation rate is developed. The proposed model equation includes these factors as a product of exponential terms. An empirical relationship between deformation and the cube root of the number of stress applications at constant temperature and normal stress is combined with the rate equation to yield an integrated relationship of temperature, deviator stress, confining pressure and number of deviator stress applications to axial strain. The experimental program consists of 64 repeated load triaxial compression tests, 52 on untreated crushed stone and 12 on the same crushed stone material treated with 4 % asphalt cement. Results were analyzed with multiple linear regression techniques and show substantial agreement with the model equations. Experimental results fit the rate equation somewhat better than the integrated equation when all variable quantities are considered. The coefficient of shear temperature gives the activation enthalpy, which is about 4. 7 kilocalories/mole for untreated material and 39. 4 kilocalories/mole for <b>asphalt-treated</b> material. This indicates the activation enthalpy is about that of the pore fluid. The proportionality coefficient of deviator stress may be used to measure flow unit volume. The volumes thus determined for untreated and <b>asphalt-treated</b> material are not substantially different. This may be coincidental since comparison with flow unit volumes reported by others indicates flow unit volume is related to gradation of untreated material. The flow unit volume of <b>asphalt-treated</b> material may relate to asphalt cement content. The proposed model equations provide a more rational basis for further studies of factors affecting deformation of {{granular material}}s under stress similar to that in pavement subjected to transient traffic loads...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: An {{experimental}} {{program was}} conducted to determine the coefficient of hydraulic conductivity of both treated and untreated open-graded base samples made from four different gradations, three aggregate types and two binder types. For the same gradation, dolomite samples have the highest K value, followed by natural gravel and recycled concrete aggregate respectively. Treated open-graded samples have K values in excess of {{an order of magnitude}} while the difference in K value between the <b>asphalt-treated</b> open-grade samples was less than an order magnitud...|$|E
40|$|The {{coefficients}} of relative strength (CORS) of base courses {{for use in}} the American association state highway officials (AASHO) interim guide for the design of flexible pavements are determined here. Based on (1) volumetric strain [...] axial strain relationships at minimum volume, and (2) effective stress ratio-cohesion relationships at maximum effective stress ratio, CORS were determined from the results of laboratory triaxial tests on both <b>asphalt-treated</b> and untreated aggregate base course materials. The researchers conclude that volumetric strain-axial strain at minimum volume appear to be appropriate parameters for determining CORS...|$|E
40|$|The {{benefits}} {{of using a}} stabilized subbase in a concrete pavement structure are many; even still, the designer must consider the subbase stiffness and potential bonding with the concrete. Common on high volume roadways such as interstate highways, stabilized subbases provide erosion (pumping) resistant and uniform foundations for concrete pavement structures. Stabilized subbases typically are stabilized with either cement, {{in the form of}} cement-treated subbases (CTB) and lean concrete subbases (LCB, econocrete), or asphalt, in the form of <b>asphalt-treated</b> subbases (ATB). CTB and ATB are best controlled during construction using compactive efforts and LCB is best controlled using strength. Typical minimum thicknesses are 4 in. (100 mm) for CTB and LCB and 2 in. (50 mm) for ATB. Because of their increased rigidity relative to unstabilized subbases, pavement designers must consider the potential for bond at the stabilized subbase/concrete pavement interface. More on this topic is available in ACPA’s EB 204 P, “Subgrades and Subbases for Concrete Pavements. ...|$|E
40|$|Results to date (Fall 1996) the Caltrans Accelerated Pavement Testing (CAL/APT) Program are {{discussed}} and include {{those for the}} Phase I program and initial results from the Phase II program. The Phase I program involved {{a study of the}} comparative performance under Heavy-Vehicle- Simulator-(HVS) -loading of Caltrans dense- graded asphalt concrete (DGAC) and asphaltrubber, hot mix, gap-graded (ARHM-GG) as overlays on a fatigue-cracked asphalt pavement and an evaluation of pavement rutting from channelized traffic resulting from simulated Automated Vehicle Systems (AVCS). The initial part of the Phase II program includes an evaluation, under HVS-loading, of the performance of two pavements, one containing an <b>asphalt-treated</b> permeable base (ATPB) and the other an aggregate base (AB), designed and constructed according to Caltrans procedures. The HVS testing of pavements for the Phase I program was performed in South Africa while the Phase II program is being conducted at the University of California at Berkeley (UCB) Richmond Field Station...|$|E
40|$|To {{enhance the}} crack {{resistance}} of <b>asphalt-treated</b> base (ATB), {{a type of}} gapped and semiopened gradation ATB mixture, GSOG, was designed. Its design method was proposed based on the volume design method and performance tests. Firstly, several gradations were designed preliminarily in which middle particle sizes of coarse aggregates were partially or completely gapped according to the gradation specification. Secondly, their voids in coarse aggregates (VCA) were determined through dry rod compaction test on coarse aggregates, and then their theoretical voids were calculated. Gradations whose theoretical voids met the requirements were selected to fabricate specimens with Superpave Gyratory Compactor, and their voids were determined using vacuum sealing method and submerged weight in water method. Finally, gradations whose voids meet requirements were selected to fabricate different types of specimens for various performance tests, and the optimal gradation can be selected comprehensively considering their performances, especially focusing on their crack resistance. According to this gradation design method, the gradation of GSOG- 25 was designed, and its performances, including high-temperature stability, water stability, fatigue, and antireflection crack resistance, were measured and compared to ordinary ATB- 25. The results demonstrate that the performance of GSOG- 25 {{is much better than}} that of ordinary ATB- 25, especially in anticracking capacity...|$|E
40|$|The Long-Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) SPS- 2 {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} study structural factors, such as drainage, base type, concrete strength and thickness, and lane width, of rigid pavements. The SPS- 2 experiment section in Kansas, constructed in 1992, is a jointed dowelled plain concrete pavement. The experiment consisted of 12 standard SPS- 2 sections and 1 Kansas DOT control section. These sections have been monitored by the LTPP program since construction. Performance monitoring included measurements for ride quality (International Roughness Index [IRI]), faulting, cracking, and surface deflections. Performance parameters analyzed in this study included IRI, faulting, cracking (combined longitudinal and transverse crack lengths), and joint load transfer efficiency. The {{results show that the}} project has performed very well to date. Most sections are smooth and crack-free, with negligible faulting. The load transfer efficiency of the sections has been good too. The drainable sections with a permeable <b>asphalt-treated</b> base have performed the best. These sections were built smoother and remained so after 12 years of service. The section with low PCC slab thickness (8 inches) and low concrete design strength (550 psi) on a dense graded aggregate base has performed the worst. The combination of high slab thickness and high concrete strength tends to mask the effect of the base on pavement performance...|$|E
