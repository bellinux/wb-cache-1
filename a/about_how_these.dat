He advocated {{for the existence of}} such inhabitants, and suggested they may be more advanced than humans.|$|E
25|$|Trafficking {{proteins}} {{are more}} complex. They include intrinsic membrane proteins, peripherally bound proteins, and proteins such as SNAREs. These proteins {{do not share}} a characteristic {{that would make them}} identifiable as synaptic vesicle proteins, and little is known <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>these</b> proteins are specifically deposited into synaptic vesicles. Many but not all of the known synaptic vesicle proteins interact with non-vesicular proteins and are linked to specific functions.|$|E
25|$|An area of top {{scientific}} {{interest for}} Curiosity {{lies at the}} edge of the landing ellipse and beyond a dark dune field. Here, orbiting instruments have detected signatures of both clay minerals and sulfate salts. Scientists studying Mars have several hypotheses <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>these</b> minerals reflect changes in the Martian environment, particularly changes in the amount of water on the surface of Mars. The rover will use its full instrument suite to study these minerals and how they formed. Certain minerals, including the clay and sulfate-rich layers near the bottom of Gale's mountain, are good at latching onto organic compounds—potential biosignatures—and protecting them from oxidation.|$|E

25|$|The Deathly Hallows {{are three}} magical {{objects that are}} the focus of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – an unbeatable wand, a stone to bring the dead to life, and a cloak of invisibility. When owned by one person, they are said to give mastery over death. The objects are {{generally}} remembered only as part of a wizard's fairy tale called The Tale of the Three Brothers, and have become mythological over time, but a small number of wizards including Dumbledore still believe in their existence and seek them. According to Rowling, the story <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>these</b> objects came into existence is based upon Geoffrey Chaucer's The Pardoner's Tale.|$|E
25|$|Self-published, popular {{web pages}} present {{a variety of}} fanciful and less {{credible}} explanations <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>these</b> hills formed. They include sub-oceanic volcanism; limestone covered blocks created by the destruction of an active volcano in a cataclysmic eruption; coral reefs that were raised from the sea {{as the result of}} a massive geologic shift; and tidal movements. The lack of any exposed or associated volcanic rocks anywhere in the Chocolate Hills refutes the popular theories involving volcanic eruptions. These theories involving either a sudden, massive geologic shift, coral reefs being erupted from the sea, or tidal movements lack any collaborating evidence and support among geologists.|$|E
500|$|Freelance writer Dan Vebber, who {{is known}} for his work on the {{animated}} series Futurama, wrote [...] "The Book Job" [...] with contributions from the staff writers on The Simpsons. Matt Selman, an executive producer and writer on The Simpsons, was the one who conceived of the idea behind the episode. He was inspired by an article in The New Yorker about the book packaging company Alloy Entertainment—the publisher of series such as Gossip Girl and Vampire Diaries—and the company's use of ghostwriters. According to Selman, the article [...] "was all <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>these</b> executives take market research and come up with the ideas for these books and farms them out and slaps the name of fake writers on them and fabricates backgrounds for these authors who don’t exist.

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Second World War, the Australian Army did not possess any [...] "special forces" [...] units, however, late in 1940, the British government sent a military mission to Australia, headed by Lieutenant-Colonel J.C Mawhood, to investigate the possibility of establishing a number of such units within the Australian Army. The British proposed the establishment of independent companies that would receive special training in order to take part in combined operations and various other tasks, including [...] "...raids, demolitions, sabotage, subversion and organising civil resistance". This was a very broad notion of the role that the independent companies would play, and at the time there was a certain amount of confusion <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>these</b> units would be used and indeed for a while there was a deal of uncertainty about their future which for a while threatened the existence of the independent company concept.|$|E

Time magazine wrote that [...] "Clinton's endurance is legendary" [...] and that she would still be going at the end of long work days even as her staff members were glazing out.
