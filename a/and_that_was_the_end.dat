25|$|Despite being {{faced with}} dangers {{along the entire}} route of their journey, the battle weary Maedbdh along with Ailill and Fergus finally {{made it back to}} Cruachan <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the tale of the Táin Bó Flidhais.|$|E
25|$|The {{investigations}} {{were widely}} {{reported in the}} press, but eventually junta leader Prayut Chan-o-cha intervened: the embezzlement case had already been closed in 2006 by the then Attorney-General <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of it. Prayuth {{was afraid of the}} rising conflicts. He then dissolved the religious committee of the reform council. However, Paiboon, Phra Suwit and Mano continued to address the leading Sangha's shortcomings through judicial means. In the meantime, the DSI investigated further, and it was discovered that a used vintage car in Wat Paknam's museum had not been properly registered, allegedly to evade taxes. Somdet Chuang was charged with tax evasion by the DSI, and the accusations were reason enough for the government to further postpone the appointment. Fear of Phra Suwit Dhiradhammo and his ties to the army may {{have played a role in}} this stalling. In December 2016, the National Legislative Assembly amended the 2005 Monastic Act to allow other monks than Somdet Chuang to be appointed Supreme Patriarch. Finally in February 2017, Somdet Amborn was appointed by King Vajiralongkorn to serve as the next Supreme Patriarch.|$|E
500|$|More than 750 slaves <b>were</b> rescued in <b>the</b> Combahee River Raid. Newspapers heralded Tubman's [...] "patriotism, sagacity, energy, [...] ability", and she {{was praised}} for her {{recruiting}} efforts – most of the newly liberated men went on to join the Union army. Tubman later worked with Colonel Robert Gould Shaw at the assault on Fort Wagner, reportedly serving him his last meal. She described the battle by saying: [...] "And then we saw <b>the</b> lightning, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> guns; <b>and</b> then we heard <b>the</b> thunder, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> big guns; <b>and</b> then we heard <b>the</b> rain falling, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> drops of blood falling; and {{when we came to}} get <b>the</b> crops, it <b>was</b> dead men <b>that</b> we reaped." ...|$|R

2500|$|Eysenck’s {{attitude}} was summarised {{in his autobiography}} Rebel with a Cause: [...] "I always felt that a scientist owes the world only one thing, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> truth as he sees it. If the truth contradicts deeply held beliefs, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> too bad. Tact and diplomacy are fine in international relations, in politics, perhaps even in business; in science only one thing matters, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> facts." [...] He <b>was</b> one of <b>the</b> signers of the Humanist Manifesto.|$|R
500|$|Colin Greenwood {{admitted}} that the band, in attempting to make the disparate elements work together, [...] "felt like irresponsible schoolboys who were doing this... naughty thing, 'cause nobody does a six-and-a-half-minute song with all these changes. It's ridiculous". The song was at first intended to be humorous, and took its title from Marvin the Paranoid Android in Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series of books. Yorke said the title [...] "was chosen as a joke. It was like, 'Oh, I'm so depressed.' And I just thought, that's great. That's how people would like me to be. <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of writing about anything personal in the song. The rest of the song is not personal at all." [...] In an early interview, Colin Greenwood described it [...] "just a joke, a laugh, getting wasted together {{over a couple of}} evenings and putting some different pieces together". The band used Queen's [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody" [...] and the work of the Pixies as reference points while writing; yet Ed O'Brien denies they wrote [...] "a 'Bohemian Rhapsody' for the nineties", and Jonny Greenwood considers it too tense and simple to rival Queen's song.|$|E
500|$|Co-creator and {{executive}} producer Roberto Orci explained {{in an interview that}} the big reveal {{at the end of the}} episode, in which Olivia meets Bell in the parallel universe, was actually planned for a fourth season, but the writers decided [...] "let's actually answer something instead and not get, not just rely on that mystery forever. And so we actually chose to give kind of a big answer and have to come with a different show than we ever intended". The writers wanted to use an iconic image [...] for the scene, leading to staff writer Andrew Kreisberg's suggestion of the Twin Towers. Wyman first thought it was [...] "the greatest idea in the world" [...] before having doubts that its use would [...] "sensationalize" [...] it. He explained, [...] "But then, when we started thinking about it, we thought collectively America really understood 9/11 is such a monumental moment so we felt it wasn’t exploited but indicative of the times we’re living in right now. We used it <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the first season and then we were all really thrilled with where it was going." [...] The cast would later recollect on the series, and for Jackson, considered that the show has never [...] "had a better visual or a better cliff-hanger" [...] as this finale.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2013 interview, Cave {{explained}} that he returned to using a typewriter for songwriting after his experience with the Nocturama album, as he [...] "could walk in on a bad day and hit 'delete' <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of it". Cave believes that he lost valuable work due to a [...] "bad day".|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{his success}} in 1927-28, he lost form in 1928-29 and played only two matches, with little success, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of his {{first-class}} career. Slowness in the field may also have hampered his advancement. He continued to play successfully for Randwick, bowling mostly off-spin. He was the leading wicket-taker in Sydney grade cricket for three consecutive seasons: 1931-32 (62 wickets), 1932-33 (56) and 1933-34 (50).|$|E
2500|$|Also in 2005, St. Louis Cardinals radio {{broadcaster}} Wayne Hagin claimed manager Don Baylor {{said that}} Helton had [...] "tried the juice" [...] in the 1990s, implying steroid use. Helton vehemently denied the allegation and considered {{legal action against}} Hagin. Hagin later apologized clarifying his comments saying he was [...] "referring to supplements, creatine, not steroids" [...] when he said [...] "juiced". Baylor said of his conversation with Hagin [...] "We discussed creatine <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the conversation. Steroid use was never even a question with me in regards to Todd Helton. [...] has his facts wrong." ...|$|E
2500|$|In September 1980 {{without any}} notice Viacom changed {{the format of}} WRVR from jazz to country music with the famous segue of September eighth at 10:00 am of Charlie Mingus to Waylon Jennings <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of Roger Dawson's {{successful}} jazz and salsa shows on WRVR-FM which had often been sold out of 15 commercial spots per hour at the highest rates on the station. Hoping to acquire some of that revenue, Dawson was hired by all Spanish-language AM radio station WJIT as the only [...] "bilingual" [...] program at that station with Dawson continuing to play his salsa hits. However the low quality of AM non-stereo radio music never generated the ratings of his FM show and his show was discontinued by WJIT in 1982.|$|E

2500|$|... "I {{had just}} said to Dick McMullen, 'Be sure not to fire until they reach that mullein stalk,' when a commotion {{in the rear of}} our line caused me to look behind us, and to my dismay, my eyes rested upon the largest line of cavalry I had ever seen. There seemed to be no end to the line. There they stood in double ranks within forty feet of us. They were well mounted and admirably armed. How they got there in our {{immediate}} rear I know not, and from what direction they came I have never learned. The fact is, they were there in overpowering numbers, with pistol or gun ready to do damage upon the least show of resistance. Major [...] Boyd, commanding our regiment, quickly said: 'We are prisoners,' <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the Nineteenth Virginia Infantry as a body of armed soldiers." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to road manager Don Opperman: [...] "The way I {{remember}} it, the 'ooos' and the 'boos' {{were mixed}} together, but Stevie was pretty disappointed. Stevie [...] just handed me his guitar {{and walked off}} stage, and I'm like, 'Are you coming back?' There was a doorway back there; the audience couldn't see the guys, but I could. He {{went back to the}} dressing room with his head in his hands. I went back there finally, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the show." [...] According to Vaughan: [...] "It wasn't the whole crowd [...] It was just a few people sitting right up front. The room there was built for acoustic jazz. When five or six people boo, wow. It sounds like the whole world hates you. They thought we were too loud, but shoot, I had four army blankets folded over my amp, and the volume level was on 2. I'm used to playin' on 10!" [...] The performance was filmed and later released on DVD in September 2004.|$|E
2500|$|Marvel {{editor-in-chief}} Roy Thomas asked writer Len Wein {{to devise}} a character specifically named Wolverine, who is Canadian and of small stature and with a wolverine's fierce temper. John Romita, Sr. designed the first Wolverine costume, and believes he introduced the retractable claws, saying, [...] "When I make a design, I {{want it to be}} practical and functional. I thought, 'If a man has claws like that, how does he scratch his nose or tie his shoelaces?'" [...] Wolverine first appeared in the final [...] "teaser" [...] panel of The Incredible Hulk #180 (cover-dated Oct. 1974) written by Wein and penciled by Herb Trimpe. The character then appeared in a number of advertisements in various Marvel Comics publications before making his first major appearance in The Incredible Hulk #181 (Nov. 1974) again by the Wein–Trimpe team. In 2009, Trimpe said he [...] "distinctly remembers" [...] Romita's sketch and that, [...] "The way I see it, [...] sewed the monster together and I shocked it to life!... It {{was just one of those}} secondary or tertiary characters, actually, that we were using in that particular book with no particular notion of it going anywhere. We did characters in The [...] Hulk all the time that were in [...] issues <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of them." [...] Though often credited as co-creator, Trimpe denied having had any role in Wolverine's creation.|$|E

50|$|From {{the period}} of 1922 to 1928 the two main factors <b>that</b> took over <b>and</b> {{increased}} Colombia’s economy <b>were</b> <b>the</b> rise in external coffee prices (the main exportation product) and a huge increase in the international credits {{to the public and}} the bank system.
