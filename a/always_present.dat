5|$|A {{symbol of}} the Institute's {{academic}} and collegiate tradition, the old Model A is often dispatched to special events on campus. It is <b>always</b> <b>present</b> when new buildings are opened or dedicated. On December 5, 2006, the Wreck became the first car to drive across the new Fifth Street Bridge.|$|E
5|$|In Wicca, salt is {{symbolic}} of the element Earth. It is also believed to cleanse an area of harmful or negative energies. A dish of salt and a dish of water are almost <b>always</b> <b>present</b> on an altar, and salt is used {{in a wide variety}} of rituals and ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|The 'core' neuroacanthocytosis syndromes are chorea acanthocytosis and McLeod syndrome. Acanthocytes {{are nearly}} <b>always</b> <b>present</b> in these {{conditions}} and they share common clinical features. Some of these features are also seen in the other neurological syndromes associated with neuroacanthocytosis.|$|E

5|$|The Royal Family {{step onto}} the balcony of the palace and are applauded by the crowd, a title card {{explains}} that Logue was <b>always</b> <b>present</b> at King George VI's speeches {{during the war and}} that they remained friends {{for the rest of their}} lives.|$|E
5|$|The {{officers}} of the Lodge are elected or appointed annually. Every Masonic Lodge has a Master, two Wardens, a secretary and a treasurer. There is also a Tyler, or outer guard, who is <b>always</b> <b>present</b> outside {{the door of a}} working Lodge. Other offices vary between jurisdictions.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the pelvis}} is not <b>always</b> <b>present,</b> so {{forensic}} anthropologists {{must be aware}} of other areas on the skeleton that have distinct characteristics between sexes. The skull also contains multiple markers {{that can be used to}} determine sex. Specific markers on the skull include the temporal line, the eye sockets, the supraorbital ridge, as well as the nuchal lines, and the mastoid process. In general, male skulls tend to be larger and thicker than female skulls, and to have more pronounced ridges.|$|E
5000|$|Extranews - News segment {{presented}} by Edric Tjandra, Indra Birowo or Shogi. Edric <b>always</b> <b>presented</b> {{the news with}} perfunctory Chinese language.|$|R

50|$|These special {{awards are}} not <b>always</b> <b>presented</b> on a {{consistent}} annual basis. The Society chooses the special awards to be given for a certain year.|$|R
5|$|Rice is {{the basic}} {{ingredient}} in ceremonial dishes, and {{is a very important}} element of Palestinian meals. Rice dishes are usually the main dish of Palestinian dinner, because they consist of a variety of ingredients commonly found within the Palestinian land. Rice is usually not served alone or as a side dish (see ruz ma lahma below), but rather it is incorporated within a larger dish or tabeekh (dish), that would include soups, vegetables, and meat (chicken or lamb). Meat is almost <b>always</b> <b>present</b> in Palestinian dishes.|$|E
5|$|The model {{assumes that}} bubble nuclei are <b>always</b> <b>present</b> in a {{specific}} size distribution, and that a certain number are induced to grow by compression and decompression. An iterative computation is used to model ascent to limit the combined volume of the gas phase. Gas mixtures of helium, nitrogen, and oxygen contain bubble distributions of different sizes, but the same phase volume limit is used.|$|E
5|$|While {{the number}} and {{severity}} of symptoms varies among individuals, repetitive regurgitation of undigested food (known as rumination) {{after the start of}} a meal is <b>always</b> <b>present.</b> In some individuals, the regurgitation is small, occurring {{over a long period of}} time following ingestion, and can be rechewed and swallowed. In others, the amount can be bilious and short lasting, and must be expelled.|$|E
50|$|There {{is always}} one large buccal cusp, {{especially}} {{so in the}} mandibular first premolar. The lower second premolar almost <b>always</b> <b>presents</b> with two lingual cusps.|$|R
50|$|Pluto and Charon are tidally locked to each other. This {{means that}} Charon <b>always</b> <b>presents</b> the same face to Pluto, and Pluto also <b>always</b> <b>presents</b> the same face to Charon. Observers {{on the far}} side of Charon from Pluto would never see the dwarf planet; {{observers}} {{on the far side}} of Pluto from Charon would never see the moon. Every 124 years, for several years it is mutual-eclipse season, when Pluto and Charon each eclipse the Sun for the other, at intervals of 3.2 days.|$|R
50|$|When {{applying}} Scouts need {{to submit}} 3 hike logs or 2 camp logs {{and the social}} awareness/conservation badge work. The NSA is <b>always</b> <b>presented</b> in a ceremony.|$|R
5|$|Write {{amplification}} was <b>always</b> <b>present</b> in SSDs {{before the}} term was defined, {{but it was in}} 2008 that both Intel and SiliconSystems started using the term in their papers and publications. All SSDs have a write amplification value and it is based on both what is currently being written and what was previously written to the SSD. In order to accurately measure the value for a specific SSD, the selected test should be run for enough time to ensure the drive has reached a steady state condition.|$|E
5|$|Brachychiton rupestris {{is found}} in central Queensland from {{latitude}} 22° S to 28° S, with the western limits of its range defined by the 500mm rainfall isohyet. It grows on the tops and slopes of hills or ridges in low hilly country, in clay, shale, or basalt soils. It is an emergent tree in forests dominated by brigalow (Acacia harpophylla), hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii), or ooline (Cadellia pentastylis). It is <b>always</b> <b>present</b> in the Central semi-evergreen vine thicket—also known as Bottletree Scrub—of the Brigalow Belt. Other common species include broad-leaved bottle tree (Brachychiton australis) and belah (Casuarina cristata). The bottle tree is replaced by the kurrajong in similar communities in New South Wales.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, {{dermatologist}} Frederick Parkes Weber {{wrote an}} article about von Recklinghausen disease in the British Journal of Dermatology. erroneously citing Merrick {{as an example of}} the disease, which German pathologist Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen had described in 1882, but in the last year has been found that this conjecture was wrong. In fact, symptoms that are <b>always</b> <b>present</b> in this genetic disorder include tumours of the nervous tissue and bones, small warty growths on the skin, and (which is a peculiar characteristic of this disease) the presence of light brown pigmentation on the skin called café au lait spots.; however, these spots were never observed on Merrick's body. For this reason, although this diagnosis was quite popular through most of the 20th century, other conjectural diagnosis were advanced, such as those of who suffer Maffucci syndrome and polyostotic fibrous dysplasia (Albright's disease).|$|E

50|$|Due to {{the growing}} {{diversity}} of genres and categories, awards in some categories are now presented in alternate years, and awards are not <b>always</b> <b>presented</b> in every category.|$|R
50|$|In {{the media}} Gronings is used frequently. For example, {{on the local}} radio station Radio Noord, Gronings {{is used by the}} presenters and listeners. On local {{television}} Gronings is used less, but the weather forecast is <b>always</b> <b>presented</b> in Gronings. The news is <b>always</b> <b>presented</b> in Dutch, since not all viewers understand Gronings. In the second half of 2007, the local television broadcast a series in Gronings called Boven Wotter. Another program that is in and about Gronings is Grunnegers, which is actually some kind of education in Gronings.|$|R
5|$|In {{its native}} range, the {{sycamore}} {{is associated with}} a biodiverse range of invertebrates and fungi, but these are not <b>always</b> <b>present</b> in areas to which it has been introduced. It is sometimes planted in urban areas for its value as an amenity tree and produces a hard-wearing, creamy-white close-grained timber that is used for making musical instruments, furniture, joinery, wood flooring and kitchen utensils. It also makes good firewood. The rising sap in spring has been used to extract sugar and make alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, and honey is made by bees collecting the nectar.|$|E
5|$|Other {{defensive}} {{strategies used}} by plants include escaping or avoiding herbivores in any time and/or any place, for example by growing in a location where plants {{are not easily}} found or accessed by herbivores, or by changing seasonal growth patterns. Another approach diverts herbivores toward eating non-essential parts, or enhances {{the ability of a}} plant to recover from the damage caused by herbivory. Some plants encourage the presence of natural enemies of herbivores, which in turn protect the plant. Each type of defense can be either constitutive (<b>always</b> <b>present</b> in the plant), or induced (produced in reaction to damage or stress caused by herbivores).|$|E
5|$|Plant {{defenses}} can {{be classified}} generally as constitutive or induced. Constitutive defenses are <b>always</b> <b>present</b> in the plant, while induced defenses are produced or mobilized to the site where a plant is injured. There is wide variation in the composition and concentration of constitutive defenses and these range from mechanical defenses to digestibility reducers and toxins. Many external mechanical defenses and large quantitative defenses are constitutive, as they require large amounts of resources to produce and are difficult to mobilize. A variety of molecular and biochemical approaches are {{used to determine the}} mechanism of constitutive and induced plant defenses responses against herbivory.|$|E
25|$|The Special Academy Awards are {{voted on}} by special committees, {{rather than by}} the Academy {{membership}} as a whole. They are not <b>always</b> <b>presented</b> on a consistent annual basis.|$|R
40|$|We tested {{whether the}} tactile {{perception}} of sequences of taps delivered on the index fingertip can be modulated by sequences of auditory beeps. In the first experiment, the tactile and auditory sequences were <b>always</b> <b>presented</b> simultaneously, and were structurally either similar or dissimilar. In the second experiment, the auditory and tactile sequences were always structurally similar but not <b>always</b> <b>presented</b> simultaneously. When structurally similar and presented simultaneously, the auditory sequences significantly modulated tactile taps perception. This automatic combination of “redundant-like” tactile and auditory signals likely constitutes an optimization process {{taking advantage of}} multimodal redundancy for perceptual estimates...|$|R
25|$|The Circus {{is divided}} into three {{segments}} of equal length, with a greensward in the center. Each segment faces one of the three entrances, ensuring a classical facade is <b>always</b> <b>presented</b> straight ahead.|$|R
5|$|The {{explanation}} of this instability {{begins with the}} existence of tiny perturbations in the stream. These are <b>always</b> <b>present,</b> no matter how smooth the stream is. If the perturbations are resolved into sinusoidal components, we find that some components grow with time while others decay with time. Among those that grow with time, some grow at faster rates than others. Whether a component decays or grows, and how fast it grows is entirely a function of its wave number (a measure of how many peaks and troughs per centimeter) and the radii of the original cylindrical stream.|$|E
5|$|In early 1950, Disney {{produced}} Cinderella, his studio's first animated {{feature in}} eight years. It was popular with critics and theater audiences. Costing $2.2million to produce, it earned nearly $8million {{in its first}} year. Disney was less involved {{than he had been}} with previous pictures because of his involvement in his first entirely live-action feature, Treasure Island (1950), which was shot in Britain, as was The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men (1952). Other all-live-action features followed, many of which had patriotic themes. He continued to produce full-length animated features too, including Alice in Wonderland (1951) and Peter Pan (1953). From the early to mid-1950s, Disney began to devote less attention to the animation department, entrusting most of its operations to his key animators, the Nine Old Men, although he was <b>always</b> <b>present</b> at story meetings. Instead, he started concentrating on other ventures.|$|E
5|$|The {{prospect}} of sabotage was <b>always</b> <b>present,</b> and sometimes suspected {{when there were}} equipment failures. While there were some problems {{believed to be the}} result of careless or disgruntled employees, there were no confirmed instances of Axis-instigated sabotage. However, on 10 March 1945, a Japanese fire balloon struck a power line, and the resulting power surge caused the three reactors at Hanford to be temporarily shut down. With so many people involved, security was a difficult task. A special Counter Intelligence Corps detachment was formed to handle the project's security issues. By 1943, it was clear that the Soviet Union was attempting to penetrate the project. Lieutenant Colonel Boris T. Pash, the head of the Counter Intelligence Branch of the Western Defense Command, investigated suspected Soviet espionage at the Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley. Oppenheimer informed Pash that he had been approached by a fellow professor at Berkeley, Haakon Chevalier, about passing information to the Soviet Union.|$|E
