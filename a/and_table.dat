5|$|Salt is {{processed}} from salt mines, {{and by the}} evaporation of seawater (sea salt) and mineral-rich spring water in shallow pools. Its major industrial products are caustic soda and chlorine; salt is used in many industrial processes including the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride, plastics, paper pulp and many other products. Of the annual global production of around two hundred million tonnes of salt, only about 6% is used for human consumption. Other uses include water conditioning processes, de-icing highways, and agricultural use. Edible salt is sold in forms such as sea salt <b>and</b> <b>table</b> salt which usually contains an anti-caking agent and may be iodised to prevent iodine deficiency. As well as its use in cooking and at the table, salt is present in many processed foods.|$|E

5|$|Within the Liliaceae sensu Dahlgren there {{developed}} {{two main}} evolutionary subclades (see Cladogram II <b>and</b> <b>Table</b> 3). The first of these, characterised as the Lilieae s.s.

Divergence within Calochortus is dated to 7mya. This places {{the emergence of}} the Liliaceae at approximately the last (Maastrichtian period) of the Late Cretaceous periods (72 to 66mya) to early (Paleocene) Paleogene periods (66 to 23mya), formerly the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary, 65mya.|$|E
