50|$|Although <b>auditory</b> <b>fatigue</b> and NIHL {{protective}} measures {{would be helpful}} {{for those who are}} constantly exposed to long and loud noises, current research is limited due to the negative associations with the substances. Furosemide is used in congestive heart failure treatments because of its diuretic properties. Salicylic acid is a compound most frequently used in anti-acne washes, but is also an anticoagulant. Further uses of these substances would need to be personalized to the individual and only under close monitoring. Antioxidants do not have these negative effects and therefore are the most commonly researched substance for the purpose of protecting against <b>auditory</b> <b>fatigue.</b> However, at this time there has been no marketed application. In addition, no synergistic relationships between the drugs on the degree of reduction of <b>auditory</b> <b>fatigue</b> have been discovered at this time.|$|E
50|$|Both {{furosemide}} and {{salicylic acid}} are considered ototoxic at certain doses. Research {{has been done}} to determine their ability to protect against <b>auditory</b> <b>fatigue</b> and permanent damage through toughening phenomena, a state described by reduced active cochlear displacements. Although limited research has been done with these two substances in terms of protective drug regimes because of their associated risks, both have shown positive results in reducing <b>auditory</b> <b>fatigue</b> by the decrease in ROS formation through individual mechanisms described below.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two main}} types of <b>auditory</b> <b>fatigue,</b> {{short-term}} and long-term. These are distinguished from each other by several characteristics listed individually below.|$|E
40|$|<b>Auditory</b> <b>fatiguing</b> can be {{considered}} a suitable test to assess some cochlear mechanisms and diseases otherwise not easily detectable. Since spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAEs) originate from active sources within the cochlea they show sensitive and early vulnerability to noise, displaying informative time-courses after overstimulation in the short (0 - 6 s) and in the long term (1 - 10 min) depending on the frequency of the fatiguing stimulus. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions too, in subjects with SOAEs, show interesting modifications after pure-tone exposure, detectable either on distortion product audiograms or in the growth functions. The modifications take place within a period of 5 - 7 minutes and strongly depend on the frequency of the fatiguing stimulus and on the closeness between SOAE and distortion product place. The data suggest that not only the interaction place between f 1 and f 2 has to {{be considered}} from a biomechanical and clinical point of view, but also the specific distortion product place on the cochlear partition...|$|R
5000|$|Toxicologist Albert Donnay {{believes}} that chronic exposure to substances such as carbon monoxide, pesticide, and formaldehyde {{can lead to}} hallucinations of the type associated with haunted houses. Donnay speculates on {{the connection between the}} prevalence of gas lamps during the Victorian era and start of the 20th century stories of ghost sightings and hauntings, describing it as the [...] "Haunted House Syndrome". Donnay says that carbon monoxide poisoning has been linked to haunted houses since at least the 1920s, citing a 1921 journal article published about a family who suffered headaches, <b>auditory</b> hallucinations, <b>fatigue,</b> melancholy, and other symptoms associated with haunted houses.|$|R
40|$|SummaryPatients {{recovered}} from Ebola virus infection may experience short- and long-term physical, neuropsychological and social sequelae, including arthralgia, musculoskeletal pain, ophthalmic inflammation, <b>auditory</b> problems, <b>fatigue,</b> confusion, insomnia, short-term memory impairment, anxiety, depression and anorexia, all lasting from {{two weeks to}} more than two years. Currently there are no treatments for post Ebola sequelae. We hypothesize that cannabidiol (CBD) may attenuate some of these post Ebola sequelae, several {{of which have been}} postulated to result from inflammation and/or an autoimmune response. CBD has anti-inflammatory actions in various animal models. Clinical studies have shown that oral administration of CBD, compared to placebo, significantly reduces anxiety, has antinociceptive and anticonvulsant actions, and may be therapeutic for insomnia. Overall, CBD has a number of pharmacological effects that may significantly improve the mental and somatic health of patients suffering from post Ebola sequelae. In humans, CBD, at therapeutic doses, does not: 1) elicit dependence or tolerance; 2) significantly alter heart rate or blood pressure; 3) affect gastrointestinal transit; 4) produce significant cognitive or psychomotor impairments. Mild sedation and nausea are the most commonly reported adverse effects associated with CBD. CBD, based on its pharmacological effects and favorable safety profile, should be considered as a treatment for individuals with post Ebola sequelae...|$|R
5000|$|TTS (Temporary Threshold Shift): {{the hearing}} loss {{that will be}} {{recovered}} {{after a couple of}} days. Also called <b>auditory</b> <b>fatigue.</b> TTS is also measured in decibels.|$|E
50|$|Temporary {{threshold}} shifts {{related to}} <b>auditory</b> <b>fatigue</b> {{are related to}} the amplitude of a stimulus-driven traveling wave. This is believed to be true because the vibration propagated by the active process is not usually {{at the center of the}} maximum amplitude of this wave. Instead, it is located much further down and the differences associated between them explain the shift in threshold. The TTS that is experienced is the exhaustion of the active system located at the locus of the traveling wave driven by the cochlear amplifier described below. <b>Auditory</b> <b>fatigue</b> can be explained by the relative activity of the active process at low-level stimulation (<30 dB).|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to understand that noise exposure itself is the main influential factor in threshold shifts and <b>auditory</b> <b>fatigue,</b> but that individuals may be at greater risk when synergistic effects take place during interactions with the above factors.|$|E
50|$|The outer hair cells, or OHCs, can {{be thought}} of as microamplifiers that provide {{stimulation}} to the inner hair cells. The OHCs are the most fragile of the hair cells, hence their involvement in <b>auditory</b> <b>fatigue</b> and other hearing impairments.|$|E
50|$|Because of this latency, the {{acoustic}} reflex cannot protect against sudden intense noises. However, when several sudden intense noises are presented {{at a pace}} higher than 2-3 seconds of interval, {{the acoustic}} reflex is able {{to play a role}} against <b>auditory</b> <b>fatigue.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{all cases}} of <b>auditory</b> <b>fatigue,</b> {{sufficient}} recovery time should allow full correction {{of the hearing}} impairment and return threshold levels to their baseline values. There is currently no way to estimate {{the amount of time}} needed to recover from <b>auditory</b> <b>fatigue</b> because it is not usually detectable until after the injury has already occurred. Studies that measured recovery time have noted that the time required is related to the magnitude of the initial hearing loss. The most significant recovery was found to occur during the first 15 minutes following cessation of the noise exposure. When sufficient recovery time is not allotted, the effects become permanent, resulting in acquired noise-induced hearing loss. Up to 120 minutes of recovery time can be required of noises of only 95 dB. For comparison, common items that can produce noise at this level are motorcycles and subways.|$|E
50|$|In general, {{structural}} {{damages to}} any anatomical {{part of the}} ear can cause hearing-related problems. Usually, minor bending of the stereocilia of the inner ear is associated with temporary hearing loss and is involved in <b>auditory</b> <b>fatigue.</b> Complete loss of the stereocilia causes permanent hearing damage and is more associated with noise-induced hearing loss and other auditory diseases.|$|E
50|$|There {{are some}} {{factors that are}} known to {{directly}} affect the auditory system. Contact with ototoxic chemicals such as styrene, toluene and carbon disulfide heighten the risk of auditory damages. Those individuals in work environments {{are more likely to}} experience the noise and chemical combination that can increase the likelihood of <b>auditory</b> <b>fatigue.</b> Individually, styrene is known to cause structural damages of the cochlea without actually interfering with functional capabilities. This explains the synergistic interaction between noise and styrene because the cochlea will be increasingly damaged with the excessive vibrations of the noise plus the damage caused by the chemical itself. Specifically, noise damage typically damages the first layer of the outer hair cells. The combined effects of styrene and noise exposure shows damages to all three rows instead, reinforcing previous results. Also, the combined effects of these chemicals and the noise produce greater <b>auditory</b> <b>fatigue</b> than when an individual is exposed to one factor immediately followed by the next.|$|E
50|$|<b>Auditory</b> <b>fatigue</b> {{is defined}} as a {{temporary}} loss of hearing after exposure to sound. This results in a temporary shift of the auditory threshold known as a temporary threshold shift (TTS). The damage can become permanent (permanent threshold shift, PTS) if sufficient recovery time is not allowed for before continued sound exposure. When the hearing loss is rooted from a traumatic occurrence, it may be classified as noise-induced hearing loss, or NIHL.|$|E
50|$|Currently it is {{believed}} that <b>auditory</b> <b>fatigue</b> and NIHL are related to excessive vibrations of the inner ear which may cause structural damages. Metabolic activity is required {{in order to maintain the}} electrochemical gradients used in mechano-electrical and electro-mechanical transduction during noise exposure and sound recognition. The metabolic activity is associated with active displacements which are components of the sound-induced vibration involving prestin, a motor protein that causes OHC motility. Excess vibrations require increased metabolic energy.|$|E
5000|$|The tone decay test (also {{known as}} the {{threshold}} tone decay test or TTDT) is used in audiology to detect and measure <b>auditory</b> <b>fatigue.</b> It was developed by Raymond Carhart in 1957. In people with normal hearing, a tone whose intensity is only slightly above their absolute threshold of hearing can be heard continuously for 60 seconds. The tone decay test produces {{a measure of the}} [...] "decibels of decay", i.e. the number of decibels above the patient's absolute threshold of hearing that are required for the tone to be heard for 60 seconds. A decay of between 15 and 20 decibels is indicative of cochlear hearing loss. A decay of more than 25 decibels is indicative of damage to the vestibulocochlear nerve.|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{find out}} whether discotheque music affects hearing by exposing 48 young volunteers to discotheque music in discotheque {{sessions}} at two discotheques and evaluating their degree of <b>auditory</b> <b>fatigue</b> after exposure. Questionnaire interviews re-vealed that the majority of them visit discotheques regularly. A higher proportion of those attend-ing the louder discotheque found the music too loud. The prevalence of tinnitus is also higher in those at-tending the noisier discotheque. The degree of threshold shifts, however, {{does not appear to be}} related to the volume of music or <b>auditory</b> <b>fatigue.</b> The noise level exposure was es-timated to be 91 dBA to 98 dBA for weekly exposure and 85 dBA to 92 dBA for monthly exposure. To avoid hearing loss, patrons should avoid loud discotheques, or cut down their frequency of visits if they choose to continue patronisin...|$|E
40|$|Objectives To {{determine}} whether call center dispatchers wearing headsets {{are subject to}} <b>auditory</b> <b>fatigue</b> {{at the end of}} a work shift. Material and Methods Data was gathered at times when call centers were busiest. All call operators wore a headset for up to 12 h. Acoustic environment and noise exposure under the headset were continuously recorded during the entire work shift. Variations in auditory parameters were assessed using pure-tone air-conduction audiometry and an objective test based on distortion product otoacoustic emissions – contralateral suppression of distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) amplitudes (EchoScan test). Thirty-nine operators and 16 controls, all volunteers, were selected from 3 call centers (sales, assistance, and emergency) where all cognitive tasks were accomplished by phone and on computers. Results No acoustic shock was detected during the investigation. The highest normalized noise exposure (daily noise exposure level – L EX, 8 h) measured was 75. 5 dBA. No significant variation in auditory performances was detected with either pure-tone air-conduction audiometry or the EchoScan test. Nevertheless, dispatchers expressed a feeling of tiredness. Conclusions For an equivalent diffuse field noise exposure, the use of a headset does not seem to worsen <b>auditory</b> <b>fatigue</b> for call center operators. The dispatcher’s fatigue was probably due to the duration of the work shift or to the tasks they performed rather than to the noise exposure under a headset.

40|$|Noise induced {{hearing loss}} (NIHL) remains a severe health problem worldwide. Current noise metrics and models have {{assessment}} limitations on gradually developing NIHL (GDNIHL). In this study, we apply a complex velocity level (CVL) <b>auditory</b> <b>fatigue</b> model to quantitatively {{assess the impact}} of basilar membrane (BM) movement on GDNIHL. The transfer functions of chinchilla and human auditory systems, including the triple-path nonlinear (TRNL) filters to simulate the inner ear responses, are applied to obtain BM velocity distribution. Chinchilla and human experimental hearing loss data are used to validate the proposed CVL model’s effectiveness. The results reveal that the developed CVL model demonstrates high correlations with both chinchilla and human hearing loss data. The linear regression based correlation study indicates the proposed CVL model may accurately predict NIHL in both human and chinchilla...|$|E
40|$|In localizing {{the source}} of the sound the {{following}} was observed under various conditions in the horizontal plane of the examinee's ears. The range of localization for subjective median, 1. Increased proportionally according to the distance from {{the source of}} the sound. 2. Increased by visual stimulus. 3. Increased by <b>auditory</b> <b>fatigue.</b> 4. Decreased when the intense noise was at the background of the source. The sensitivity of localizing sound is separated to two sides, namely the displacement of the apparent source and the range of localization. There has been few reports concerning the latter. Sound localization is produced in the centrum by two auditory nerve excitation. The increased displacement is attributed to unequal nerve excitations, and the increased range of localization to the unclearness of nerve excitation...|$|E
40|$|A first {{experiment}} compared {{two methods}} {{for measuring the}} susceptibility to <b>auditory</b> <b>fatigue.</b> Fifteen subjects were exposed to a 1000 -Hz, 90 -dB SPL tone for 60 sec. The temporary loudness shift (TLS) of a 1000 -Hz, 55 -dB test tone was established by estimates of loudness (numbers), and also by adjustments of the test-tone level in order to reproduce the initial (pre-exposure) loudness. The correlation between the two values of TLS reaches 0. 85, however the TLS provided by the adjustment method is lesser (by an average of 8 dB) than the TLS deduced from the numerical estimates. A second experiment investigated the accuracy of loudness memorization by the method of level adjustment in the same paradigm as in the first experiment, but without the fatiguing tone. In some conditions, the memorized loudness is under-estimated (by about 4 dB) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{findings}} of a study by Cahn and Polich (2009) {{suggests that there is}} an effect of a meditative state on three event-related potential (ERP) brain markers of "low-level" auditory attention (i. e., acoustic representations in sensory memory) in expert meditators: the N 1, the P 2, and the P 3 a. The current study built on these findings by examining trait and state effects of meditation on the passive auditory mismatch negativity (MMN), N 1, and P 2 ERPs. We found that the MMN was significantly larger in meditators than non-meditators regardless of whether they were meditating or not (a trait effect), and that N 1 amplitude was significantly attenuated during meditation in non-meditators but not expert meditators (an interaction between trait and state). These outcomes suggest that low-level attention is superior in long-term meditators in general. In contrast, low-level attention is reduced in non-meditators when they are asked to meditate for the first time, possibly due to <b>auditory</b> <b>fatigue</b> or cognitive overload. 8 page(s...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNoise {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{pervasive}} hazards in the workplace. Despite regulations and preventive measures, noise-induced hearing loss is common. The current reference test is pure-tone air-conduction audiometry (PTA), but this test cannot be used to detect early hearing loss. Objective: In this study, we assess one-day <b>auditory</b> <b>fatigue</b> using both PTA and efferent reflexes (ER) measured using DPOAEs associated with contralateral acoustic stimulation (CAS DPOAEs). Design: The noise exposure history, PTA, and ER detection were performed in seven different companies where the LEX, 8 h was 85 dB(A). Hearing was tested before and at the end of the working day. Study sample: Forty-six volunteers were selected to carry out this study. Results: After a single working day, a greater impact of noise was measured using ER thresholds than PTA or DPOAEs. ER measurements are objective, easy to perform, and do not require a sound-attenuated booth. Conclusion: Screening workers by periodically measuring ER thresholds using CAS DPOAEs helps detect early changes in hearing status, before the onset of noise-induced hearing loss. These tests can be readily applied as part of a hearing conservation program...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 119 - 130) A {{description is}} given {{of some of}} the pressures, particularly the promulgation of federal occupational noise standards, which have prompted an expanding necessity and usage of hearing protection from industrial noise. The attenuated and non-acoustical properties of hearing protectors, specifically the insert type, are discussed in detail. Further, an analysis of the methods evaluating the degree of protection afforded by intra-aural devices is presented. It is suggested that current audiometric methods of assessing insert ear protector attenuation may not necessarily indicate the actual sound reduction provided under live industrial conditions. Finally, a study was conducted in which four workers were exposed to a monitored, high-intensity industrial noise source while wearing common, specified insert hearing protectors to determine if temporary <b>auditory</b> <b>fatigue</b> would develop from a given protected exposure. Following a 48 hour rest period, the procedure was repeated. While minimal temporary threshold shifts were observed subsequent to the protected noise exposure (TTS adjusted to 2 minutes post-exposure), insufficient data were generated from the noise exposure to quantitatively ascertain that the protectors provided adequate attenuation to preclude significant temporary aural fatigue. Limitations of the study and recommendations for further research are indicated...|$|E
40|$|Noise induced {{hearing loss}} (NIHL) remains as a severe health problem worldwide. Existing noise metrics and {{modeling}} {{for evaluation of}} NIHL are limited on prediction of gradually developing NIHL (GDHL) caused by high-level occupational noise. In this study, we proposed two <b>auditory</b> <b>fatigue</b> based models, including equal velocity level (EVL) and complex velocity level (CVL), which combine the high-cycle fatigue theory with the mammalian auditory model, to predict GDHL. The mammalian auditory model is introduced by combining the transfer function of the external-middle ear and the triple-path nonlinear (TRNL) filter to obtain velocities of basilar membrane (BM) in cochlea. The high-cycle fatigue theory {{is based on the}} assumption that GDHL can be considered as a process of long-cycle mechanical fatigue failure of organ of Corti. Furthermore, a series of chinchilla experimental data are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed fatigue models. The regression analysis results show that both proposed fatigue models have high corrections with four hearing loss indices. It indicates that the proposed models can accurately predict hearing loss in chinchilla. Results suggest that the CVL model is more accurate compared to the EVL model on prediction of the auditory risk of exposure to hazardous occupational noise...|$|E
40|$|<b>Auditory</b> <b>fatigue</b> is {{now known}} as Temporary Threshold Shift (subsequently {{abbreviated}} to TTS). It has been defined as the temporary elevation in the absolute threshold of hearing for a given test sound resulting from preceding auditory stimulation by a given stimulus sound (see Hirsh, 1952, page 177). Associated with the phenomenon there are six physical variables which sub-divide themselves into stimulus, test and recovery factors. In IMS study each of the latter factors was systematically Investigated using four groups of six undergraduate subjects. Thresholds were measured using the Bek 6 sy (1947) technique of threshold measurement. Control experiments were carried out to verify that TTS results from the application of the stimulus tone, to study the mechanisms involved in the Bekesy technique of threshold measurement and the effects of this technique on the measurement of TTS, to investigate any additive effects of TTS and to study the possibility of any measurement errors resulting from the physical test environment. The results of the experiments showed that the stimulus test and recovery factors all produced a consistent duality of results. It was concluded that the unitary definition of TTS is inadequate and that there are two TTS mechanisms. These are referred to as fatigue and temporal stimulation deafness. Fatigue is associated with moderately intense stimulus tones of fairly short duration. It increases linearly with logarithm of the stimulus duration; it is maximal at stimulus frequencies of 1000, 2000 and 3000 cps; it does not vary significantly with stimulus intensities of up to 90 db. but thence increases rapidly to a maximum; it is maximal at a test frequency equal to the stimulus frequency and recovery from it is complete within one minute of the cessation of the stimulus. Temporary stimulation deafness is associated with high intensity stimulus tones of fairly long duration. It increases linearly with the logarithm of the stimulus duration; it is maximal with stimulus frequencies of 4000 to 6000 cps; it increases rapidly as the stimulus intensity is increased; it is maximal at a test frequency an octave above the stimulus frequency and recovery from it takes longer than one minute from the cessation of the stimulus tone. It is hypothesized that fatigue is a neural, possibly bio-chemical, adaptation effect and that temporary stimulation deafness results from structural damage to the organ of Corti. Other work supports this differentiation. The phenomena of fatigue support either a "place" or a "volley" theory of hearing. The phenomena of temporary stimulation deafness are partially explicable in terms of the anatomical characteristics of the ear...|$|E
