A type of superplasticizer with high water reducing rate and early strength gaining property was characterized in this study.

Shotcrete structural applications, however, have been so far very limited mainly because of some concerns about material's durability and high-temperature behavior. The latter issue is {{the starting point of}} this research project aimed to investigate the thermo-mechanical properties of three shotcretes containing different accelerating agents (based on sodium silicates in one mix – C 1, and on sulfo-aluminates in two mixes – C 2 /C 2 F, no steel fibers/with steel fibers). The objective is to check (a) whether the heat-triggered mechanical decay of shotcrete {{is similar to that of}} ordinary concrete, and (b) how shotcrete low thermal diffusivity and relatively large porosity evolve at high temperature. The mechanical properties in compression are investigated both at high temperature (hot tests, C 2 and C 2 F) and past cooling (residual tests, all mixes). In terms of normalized mechanical decay, the two shotcretes containing an alkali-free <b>accelerating</b> <b>agent</b> behave similarly to ordinary concrete, while the shotcrete with an alkaline <b>accelerating</b> <b>agent</b> is more heat and age sensitive. Up to 850 °C, all mixes exhibit a markedly lower thermal diffusivity compared with ordinary concrete, and a higher porosity.

40|$|While use of LEDs {{in fiber}} optics and {{lighting}} applications is common, {{their use in}} medical diagnostic applications is rare. Since the precise value of light intensity is used to interpret patient results, understanding failure modes is very important. The contributions of this thesis is that it represents the first measurements of reliability of AlGaInP LEDs for the medical environment of short pulse bursts and hence the uncovering of unique failure mechanisms. Through accelerated life tests (ALT), the reliability degradation model has been developed and other LED failure modes have been compared through a failure modes and effects criticality analysis (FMECA). Appropriate ALTs and accelerated degradation tests (ADT) were designed and carried out for commercially available AlGaInP LEDs. The bias conditions were current pulse magnitude and duration, current density and temperature. The data was fitted to both an Inverse Power Law model with current density J as the <b>accelerating</b> <b>agent</b> and also to an Arrhenius model with T as the <b>accelerating</b> <b>agent.</b> The optical degradation during ALT/ADT {{was found to be}} logarithmic with time at each test temperature. Further, the LED bandgap temporarily shifts towards the longer wavelength at high current and high junction temperature. Empirical coefficients for Varshini's equation were determined, and are now available for future reliability tests of LEDs for medical applications. In order to incorporate prior knowledge, the Bayesian analysis was carried out for LEDs. This consisted of identifying pertinent prior data and combining the experimental ALT results into a Weibull probability model for time to failure determination. The Weibull based Bayesian likelihood function was derived. For the 1 st Bayesian updating, a uniform distribution function was used as the Prior for Weibull á-â parameters. Prior published data was used as evidence to get the 1 st posterior joint á-â distribution. For the 2 nd Bayesian updating, ALT data was used as evidence to obtain the 2 nd posterior joint á-â distribution. The predictive posterior failure distribution was estimated by averaging over the range of á-â values. This research provides a unique contribution in reliability degradation model development based on physics of failure by modeling the LED output characterization (logarithmic degradation, TTF â< 1), temperature dependence and a degree of Relevance parameter `R' in the Bayesian analysis...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the quantum teleportation of continuous variables modeled by Unruh-DeWitt detectors coupled {{to a common}} quantum field initially in the Minkowski vacuum. An unknown coherent state of an Unruh-DeWitt detector is teleported from one inertial agent (Alice) to an almost uniformly <b>accelerated</b> <b>agent</b> (Rob, for relativistic motion), using a detector pair initially entangled and shared by these two agents. The averaged physical fidelity of quantum teleportation, which is independent of the observer's frame, always drops below the best fidelity value from classical teleportation before the detector pair becomes disentangled with the measure of entanglement evaluated around the future lightcone of the joint measurement event by Alice. The distortion of the quantum state of the entangled detector pair from the initial state can suppress the fidelity significantly even when the detectors are still strongly entangled around the lightcone. We {{point out that the}} dynamics of entanglement of the detector pair observed in Minkowski frame or in quasi-Rindler frame are not directly related to the physical fidelity of quantum teleportation in our setup.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{leading edge}} of the {{response}} ofLimulus ventral photoreceptors to brief flashes was investigated using a voltage clamp. The {{leading edge of}} responses increases linearly with flash intensity when dim flashes produce less than one photoisomerization per square micron of cell surface. Brighter flashes accelerate the initial portion of the response, resulting in a fourth-power relationship between the magnitude of the response at brief times after the flash and the flash intensity. The onset of this nonlinearity with increasing flash intensity is determined by the local density of photoisomerizations within the receptor. Responses to bright 10 - 15 -iAm-diam spots therefore rise faster than responses to diffuse flashes producing the same number of photoisomerizations within the receptor. Background illumination shortens the response latency and suppresses the initial nonlinearity. These phenomena can be explained by a model of transduction in which light activates two parallel cascades of reactions. Particles released by the first of these cascades open ionic channels, while the second produces an agent that accelerates the rate of production of particles by the first. Injection of the calcium buffer EGTA slows the initial portion of the response to bright flashes and suppresses its nonlinearity, which suggests that the <b>accelerating</b> <b>agent</b> released by the second cascade is calcium...|$|E
40|$|With {{the first}} {{observations}} of solar γ-rays from {{the decay of}} pions, the relationship of protons producing ground level enhancements (GLEs) on the Earth to those of similar energies producing the γ-rays on the Sun has been debated. These two populations may be either independent and simply coincident in large flares, or they may be, in fact, the same population stemming from a single <b>accelerating</b> <b>agent</b> and jointly distributed at the Sun and also in space. Assuming the latter, we model a scenario in which particles are accelerated near the Sun in a shock wave with a fraction transported back to the solar surface to radiate, while the remainder is detected at Earth {{in the form of}} a GLE. Interplanetary ions versus ions interacting at the Sun are studied for a spherical shock wave propagating in a radial magnetic field through a highly turbulent radial ray (the acceleration core) and surrounding weakly turbulent sector in which the accelerated particles can propagate toward or away from the Sun. The model presented here accounts for both the first-order Fermi acceleration at the shock front and the second-order, stochastic re-acceleration by the turbulence enhanced behind the shock. We find that the re-acceleration is important in generating the γ-radiation and we also find that up to 10 % of the particle population can find its way to the Sun as compared to particles escaping to the interplanetary space...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new model}} of North Polar Coronal Hole (NPCH) to study dissipation/propagation of MHD waves. We investigate the effects of the isotropic viscosity and heat conduction on the propagation characteristics of the MHD waves in NPCH. We first model NPCH by considering the differences in radial {{as well as in the}} direction perpendicular to the line of sight (los) in temperature, particle number density and non-thermal velocities between plumes and interplume lanes for the specific case of OVI ions. This model includes parallel and perpendicular (to the magnetic field) heat conduction and viscous dissipation. Next, we derive the dispersion relations for the MHD waves in the case of absence and presence of parallel heat conduction. In the case of absence of parallel heat conduction, we find that MHD wave dissipation strongly depends on the viscosity for modified acoustic and Alfven waves. The energy flux density of acoustic waves varies between 10 ^ 4. 7 and 10 ^ 7 erg cm^- 2 s^- 1 while the energy flux density of Alfven waves turned out to be between 10 ^ 6 - 10 ^ 8. 6 erg cm^- 2 s^- 1. But, solutions of the magnetoacustic waves show that the parallel heat conduction introduce anomalous dispersion to the NPCH plasma wherein the group velocity of waves exceeds the speed of light in vacuum. Our results suggests all these waves may provide significant source for the observed preferential accelerating and heating of OVI ions, in turn coronal plasma heating and an extra <b>accelerating</b> <b>agent</b> for fast solar wind in NPCH.

The experiment results demonstrated that the stereocomplex degree of PLLA/PDLA-PEG-PDLA prepared by melt blending was closely related to the PEG block and PDLA block. POM results indicated that the blends with high L/D ratio showed large disordered spherulites, and the typical Maltese cross pattern was observed as the L/D ratios decreased. The results of PEG block on the stereocomplexation of PLLA/PDLA-PEG-PDLA revealed that the PEG blocks possessed two sides: <b>accelerating</b> <b>agent</b> for the mobility of polymer chains and decreasing nucleation capacity due to their diluting effect. The effect of PDLA block on the stereocomplexation of the blends was also well investigated. The results showed that the crystallization of sc-crystallites and hc-crystallites in the PLLA/PDLA-PEG 4 k-PDLA blends with different PDLA blocks presents an obvious competition relationship, and this is not beneficial to the formation of sc-crystallites with increasing PDLA block. The melting behavior of PLLA/PDLA-PEG 4 k-PDLA with different PDLA blocks after isothermal crystallization showed that the blends could achieve full stereocomplex when the crystallization temperature exceeded 160 °C, and a crystallite with high perfection could be formed as the crystallization temperature increased. This study systemically investigated the effects of the L/D ratios, PEG block, PDLA block, and crystallization conditions on stereocomplex crystallization of PLLA/PDLA-PEG-PDLA blends, which can provide potential approaches to control the microstructure and physical performances of PLLA/PDLA-PEG-PDLA blends...|$|E

Having reliable knowledge of the lifespan and maintenance requirements of such networks is crucial to be able to schedule maintenance and avoid emergency repairs which are very costly and disruptive especially when pipes are run under busy streets of towns, cities and other thoroughfares in highly populated areas. There is much research into improving the reliability and longevity of polyolefins. To do this, there needs to be an understanding of the failure mechanisms brought about by ageing. Newer resins are increasingly resistant to onset of brittle failure and as such current test methods are struggling to keep up with their assessment. Therefore, more discriminating laboratory experiments are required to measure the improved resistance of brittle fracture of these newer resins. When investigating Slow Crack Growth (SCG) in polyethylene (PE) {{it is important to understand}} how a crack is initiated and the mechanisms by which it propagates. Several of the main tensile, constant stress tests that are currently used to evaluate polymer life expectancies that have been proven by many researchers of SCG over the years are described, as well as several notching methods associated with the tensile tests. For the new experimental procedure the research partner required the following conditions:  To be a tension test with plane strain stress conditions,  For the sample to be in a bath at elevated temperature and with an <b>accelerating</b> <b>agent</b> (Arkopal N 100).  Failure times to be faster than the current setup using the Full Notch Creep Test (FNCT) and the samples used must have certain dimensions.  The evaluative procedure to be able to simply rank PE grades by failure time and then if possible correlate the failure times to life expectancy. For development of the new experimental procedures the starting point was the standard FNCT which has a square ligament cross section. By modifying ligament cross section, applied stress, notch depth, notch angle and notch geometry a more discriminating experimental procedure was developed which reduced the time to failure by roughly half when compared to the FNCT. This failure time can then be correlated to an approximation of the pipes ESCR, i. e. its lifetime whist in use. Results clearly demonstrated the transition for ductile to brittle behaviour with ageing of the polymer resins. A valuable acceleration of the failure process has been achieved which allows an increased number of assessments to be made on new resins. Failure processes have been observed optically and by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) to identify the micro-mechanisms of fracture.

40|$|Two continuous-flow analyses, the Gambino-Schreiber and Simmons procedures, {{for total}} and direct {{bilirubin}} in serum {{were compared with}} the manual method of Jen-drassik-Gr#{ 244 }f. Values for total bilirubin obtained by these automated methods were accurate and reliable. However, automated direct bilirubin values were too high and de-viated strongly from theoretical values. Serum bilirubin is differentiated into two types according to their properties. Unconjugated or “indirect-reacting ” bi-lirubin is attached to albumin; it is made water soluble {{by the addition of}} <b>accelerating</b> <b>agents</b> before the coupling reaction. Conjugated or “direct-reacting ” bilirubin is water soluble and will give the coupling reaction without pretreatment (1). Generally, the method most widely recommended for the determination of serum bilirubin in clinical routine analysis is based on the coupling of bilirubin with diazobenzene-p-sulfonic acid discovered by Ehrlich in 1883 (2). In 1938, Jen-drassik and Gr#{ 244 }fcombined caffeine sodium benzoate with sodium acetate as an accelerator, and diazotized with sulfanilic acid to form alkaline azo-bilirubin at pH 13. 4 (3). In 1960, Nosslin (4) modified the method of Jendrassik and Gr#{ 243 }fto include the quantitative determination of direct-reacting bilirubin by replacing accelerator with water and terminating the diazo reaction with ascorbic acid before treatment with alkali. Gambino and Schreiber adapted Nosslin’s modification to the AutoAnalyzer in 1964 (5), and this is the method cur-rently recommended by the Technicon Corporation. In 1961, Micha#{ 235 }llson(6) showed that misleading results could be ob-tained for direct-reacting bilirubin in the Nosslin modifica-tion, because the caffeine mixture was used in the total but not in the assay for direct-reacting bilirubin. He then sug-gested the inclusion of all reagents when either total or direct bilirubin is estimated, {{as well as in the}} blank, by varying the order in which the reagents were added. In 1968, Simmons (7...|$|R
