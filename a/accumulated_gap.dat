50|$|In the 21st and 22nd centuries, it is {{the years}} in which the Paschal Full Moon on the Gregorian tables falls on its latest {{possible}} date (18 April), the year 2019 and every nineteenth year after that, when the Aleppo method gives Easter approximately a month earlier than the Gregorian method. This is because the gradually <b>accumulating</b> <b>gap</b> between the Gregorian algorithms and the astronomical equinox and full moon means that in these years, the true full moon in March occurs just after the equinox; while the equivalent full moon in the Gregorian algorithm falls on 20 March (the approximated equinox), meaning that the Paschal Full Moon is delayed until the following month. In the year 2000 (which is technically part of the 20th century), however, {{this is not the}} case. One might think, based on the occurrences in 2019 and every nineteenth year after that, that the Aleppo method would give 26 March as Easter Sunday for 2000. However, the gap between the Gregorian algorithms and the astronomical equinox and full moon had not yet widened enough to place the true March full moon after the equinox; in 2000 a full moon occurred at 07:05 Jerusalem time on 20 March, before the March equinox at 09:36 Jerusalem time the same day; as a result, the Paschal Full Moon was not until the following month (as it is defined as the first full moon after the equinox), and the date given for Easter 2000 by the Aleppo method was therefore 23 April, the same as by the Gregorian method.|$|R

40|$|DNA {{replication}} forks {{pause in}} front of lesions on the template, eventually leading to cytotoxic chromosomal rearrangements. The in vivo structure of damaged eukaryotic replication intermediates has been so far elusive. Combining electron microscopy (EM) and two-dimensional (2 D) gel electrophoresis, we found that UV-irradiated S. cerevisiae cells uncouple leading and lagging strand replication at irreparable UV lesions, thus generating long ssDNA regions {{on one side of}} the fork. Furthermore, small ssDNA <b>gaps</b> <b>accumulate</b> along replicated duplexes, likely resulting from repriming events downstream of the lesions on both leading and lagging strands. Translesion synthesis and homologous recombination counteract gap accumulation, without affecting fork progression. The DNA damage checkpoint contributes to gap repair and maintains a replication-competent fork structure. We propose that the coordinated action of checkpoint, recombination, and translesion synthesis-mediated processes at the fork and behind the fork preserves the integrity of replicating chromosomes by allowing efficient replication restart and filling the resulting ssDNA gaps...|$|R

This has been part of a major political reform, the major manifestation of which was the replacement of the century-old 1886 Constitution by a new political charter in 1991.

40|$|Liberalization and {{privatization}} {{have made}} the regulatory environment more market-friendly throughout the OECD. However using a large new dataset on product market regulation, we show that regulatory policies in OECD nations have become more dissimilar in relative terms, even as all nations have liberalized. This seemingly contradictory finding is explained by different starting points and different reform speeds. Our data also show that this divergence in the regulatory settings lines up with the divergent growth performance of OECD nations, in particular the poor performance of large Continental economies relative {{to that of the}} US. The data, which tracks various types of product market regulation in manufacturing and service industries for 18 OECD economies over the past two decades, allows us to explore this link in detail. We find that productivity growth is boosted by reforms that promote private corporate governance and competition (where these are viable). Moreover, our detailed findings suggest how product market regulation and productivity growth are linked. In manufacturing, the productivity gains from liberalization are greater the further a given country is from the technology leader. This indicates that entry-limiting regulation may hinder the adoption of existing technologies, possibly by reducing competitive pressures, technology spillovers, or the entry of new high-tech firms. These results offer an interpretation of poor Continental performance. Strict product market regulations - and lack of regulatory reforms - appear to underlie the meagre productivity performance of some European countries, especially in those industries where Europe has <b>accumulated</b> a technology <b>gap</b> (e. g. industries producing or using information and communication technologies).

40|$|In {{this report}} we review recent {{experimental}} results on photoexcited carrier relaxation dynamics on high temperature superconductors (HTSC) probed by a femtosecond time-resolved optical spectroscopy, {{and compare the}} results with the data obtained on quasi two dimensional charge density waves. In these experiments, a femtosecond laser pump pulse excites electron-hole pairs via an inter-band transition in the material. These hot carriers rapidly release their energy via electron-electron and electron-phonon collisions reaching states near the Fermi energy within ~ 100 fs. If an energy gap {{is present in the}} low-energy density of states (DOS), it inhibits the final relaxation step and photoexcited carriers <b>accumulate</b> above the <b>gap</b> causing a transient change in reflectivity arising from excited state absorption. The relaxation and recombination processes of photoexcited quasiparticles, governed by the magnitude, anisotropy and the T-dependence of the low energy gap, are monitored by measuring the resulting photoinduced absorption as a function of time after the photoexcitation. This way, the studies of carrier relaxation dynamics give us direct information of the T-dependent changes in the low energy DOS. The technique is particularly useful to probe the systems with spatial inhomogeneities, where different local environments give rise to different relaxation rates. The data on series of HTSC-s show evidence for the coexistence of two distinct relaxation processes, whose T-dependences seem to be governed by two different energy scales: a T-independent pseudogap and a mean-field-like T-dependent gap that opens at Tc. The data suggest the origin of the two-gap behavior is in the intrinsic microscopic spatial inhomogeneity of these materials.

40|$|The authors look at {{differences}} in the scope and depth of pro-competitive regulatory reforms and privatization policies as a possible source of cross-country dispersion in growth outcomes. They suggest that, despite extensive liberalization and privatization in the OECD area, the cross-country variation of regulatory settings has increased in recent years, lining up with the increasing dispersion in growth. The authors then investigate empirically the regulation-growth link using data that cover a large set of manufacturing and service industries in OECD countries {{over the past two}} decades and focusing on multifactor productivity (MFP), which plays a crucial role in GDP growth and accounts for a significant share of its cross-country variance. Regressing MFP on both economywide indicators of regulation and privatization and industry-level indicators of entry liberalization, the authors find evidence that reforms promoting private governance and competition (where these are viable) tend to boost productivity. In manufacturing the gains to be expected from lower entry barriers are greater the further a given country is from the technology leader. So, regulation limiting entry may hinder the adoption of existing technologies, possibly by reducing competitive pressures, technology spillovers, or the entry of new high technology firms. At the same time, both privatization and entry liberalization are estimated to have a positive impact on productivity in all sectors. These results offer an interpretation to the observed recent {{differences in}} growth patterns across OECD countries, in particular between large continental European economies and the United States. Strict product market regulations-and lack of regulatory reforms-are likely to underlie the relatively poorer productivity performance of some European countries, especially in those industries where Europe has <b>accumulated</b> a technology <b>gap</b> (such as information and communication technology-related industries). These results also offer useful insights for non-OECD countries. In particular, they point to the potential benefits of regulatory reforms and privatization, especially in those countries with large technology gaps and strict regulatory settings that curb incentives to adopt new technologies.

30|$|It is {{expected}} that the global oil demand increase {{in the coming years}} will be due to a leap in energy demand (Pourafshary and Azimpour et al. 2009; Kong and Ohadi 2010). As most of the oil wells around the world are at their maturity phases (Hite et al. 2004), the drilling stage is now even of more importance than before to minimize oil waste. As drilling fluid is, however, the most important element in a drilling process advanced well control methods focus on controlling the properties of the drilling fluid which is an advantage over conventional drilling methods. An efficient drilling operation depends mostly on the rheological properties of the drilling fluids (i.e., mud density, plastic viscosity, yield point, gel strength, and filtration loss) to ensure wellbore stability (Sadegh Hassani and Amrollahi et al. 2016; Sami 2016; Aftab and; Ismail et al. 2017). The widespread applications of nanotechnology in the energy sector have been widely extended to {{the oil and gas industry}} for various purposes including drilling in the recent years (Sabet and Hosseini et al. 2016). Nanotechnology is a branch of science which deals with the manipulation of atoms and molecules in a nano scale to produce macro scale matter with unique properties (Serrano and Rus et al. 2009). Some experts have introduced nano-drilling fluids with advanced features as the next generation of drilling fluids that will transform the drilling industry (Evdokimov and Eliseev et al. 2006; Amanullah and Al-Tahini 2009; Rao 2010; Li and; Xu et al. 2012; William and; Ponmani et al. 2014; Al-Yasiri and Al-Sallami 2015). Using nanoparticle drilling fluids, features including friction and wear reduction factor and rheology properties can be altered (Jahns 2014). Some of the advantages of nano-based drilling fluids are improving the efficiency of shale stabilization, enhancing mud cake, improving cement, and enhancing anti-corrosion capacity (Amanullah and Al-Tahini 2009; Kong and Ohadi 2010). Drilling fluid is expensive any loss will increase the corresponding costs, also the loss of drilling fluid in the formation lowers well productivity as skin factor increases (Pourafshary and Azimpour et al. 2009). Due to their nano size, the nanoparticles <b>accumulate</b> in the <b>gaps</b> between the larger particles, making lumps that prevent the flow in the matrix (Wilson 2012).|$|R
30|$|Observing the {{interface}} between the threads and artificial bone in detail, the upper threads closely engaged the artificial bone, whereas the under did not contact the artificial bone closely, resulting {{in the presence of}} a gap. Based on this observation, it is believed that primary stability of the implants was mainly dependent on the friction between the upper surface of the threads and the bone. Potential causes for the gap under to the threads are as follows. During insertion, a rotational force is used to extend the implant into the artificial bone, resulting in slight expansion of the implant as the under thread surfaces rotate and compress the artificial bone upon contact. However, once the rotational force disappears, the implant shrinks by elastic recovery. This shrinkage results in a separation between the under thread surfaces and the bone. In ST and MK 3, the parallel implant groups, the threads contacted the artificial bone at the neck. This was a characteristic finding of the parallel implants as it was not observed with tapered implants. This gap was slightly smaller than that noted between the artificial bone and the threads positioned further apically. It is suggested that the elastic recovery force holed the threads and enhanced retention of the implant. The implant platform in MK 3 and MK 4 engaged the artificial bone closely and no gap was seen. However, white layers such as those around the threads were not observed. The insertion torque-time curves showed that a greater torque values was generated when the platform contacted the bone. This is presumably because the surface where the platform contacted the bone was large and flat, and therefore the force was dispersed and did not create sufficient plastic deformation to destroy the foam. For self-tapping implant of MK 3 and MK 4, it was confirmed that the bone debris, which occurred during tapping, were distributed over the contacting interface. This study revealed that most of the bone debris was accumulated in the chamber, although some were simultaneously <b>accumulated</b> in the <b>gap</b> between the threads and artificial bone. Therefore, it is thought that a greater decrease in reverse torque occurred because of the bone debris on the contact interface being gradually fragmented and flattened. One of the causes early lost might flattening of the irregularities of the contact area.|$|R

DNA is a promising candidate for this task since it offers excellent specificity in base-pairing combined with addressability at the nanometer scale. New applications in biosensing, e. g. interaction analysis at the single molecule level, or nanobiotechnology, e. g. ultradense DNA microarrays, have been devised that rely on stretched DNA bridges. The basic technology required {{is the ability to}} deposit spatially defined, stretched DNA-bridges between anchoring structures on surfaces. In this paper we present two techniques for spanning 2 mu m long dsDNA bridges between neighboring interdigitated electrodes (IDEs). The extended DNA used was linearized M 13 dsDNA (M 13 mp 18 7231 bp, ca. 2. 5 mu m length), either unmodified, or with chemical modifications at both ends. The first approach is based on the dielectrophoretic (DEP) concentration and alignment of linearized wild-type dsDNA. IDEs with 1. 7 pin spacing are driven with an AC voltage around 1 MHz leading to field strengths in the order of 1 MV m/sup - 1 /. The dsDNA is polarized and linearized by the force field and <b>accumulates</b> in the <b>gap</b> between two neighboring electrodes. This process is reversible and was visualized by fluorescence staining of M 13 DNA using PicoGreen TM, as intercalating dye. The resulting dsDNA bridges and their orientation are discernible under the fluorescence microscope using fluorescent particles of different color. The particles are tagged with sequence specific peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probes that bind to the DNA double strand at specific sites. The second approach is based on asymmetric electrochemical modification of a gold IDE with 2. 0 mu m spacings followed by spontaneous or stimulated deposition of a chemically modified M 13 -DNA. One side of the IDE was selectively coated with streptavidin by electropolymerization of a novel hydrophilic conductive polymer {{in the presence of the}} binding protein. The second side was modified with gold nanoparticles by reductive plating from aqueous gold chloride solution. An asymmetric double stranded (ds) M 13 DNA carrying a 5 -thiol group at one end and a 5 '-biotin at the other end was obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using two differently labeled primers. For DNA bridges to form spontaneously the modified IDE was incubated over night with a 50 nM solution of the modified M 13 DNA [...] Potential applications of DNA-bridge formation in biosensing and biotechnology are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{integrity}} of DNA replication forks {{is important for}} cell viability. In replication checkpoint-deficient budding yeast, disturbances caused by DNA damaging agents possibly result in fork collapse or DNA breaks/rearrangements. Previous studies from our laboratory indicated that 14 - 3 - 3 -deficient yeast cells cannot restart replication forks in response to hydroxyurea (HU) treatment. The data also indicated that in these cells ssDNA <b>gaps</b> <b>accumulate</b> behind the fork in an Exo 1 -dependent manner. However, while deletion of EXO 1 rescued the accumulation of ssDNA gaps, it was unable to rescue HU sensitivity and the slow fork progression/restart defect of 14 - 3 - 3 - deficient cells. These studies highlighted the fact that additional unknown targets of 14 - 3 - 3 proteins contribute to promote fork progression, stability and restart. From a list of established 14 - 3 - 3 -interacting proteins selected in silico {{on the base of}} their involvement in DNA transactions, we attempted to identify factors that suppress fork restart upon HU-release in 14 - 3 - 3 -deficient cells. We obtained evidence that Dpb 3, one of the two accessory subunits of Pol ε, physically interacts with yeast 14 - 3 - 3 (Bmh 1) in vivo and that deletion of DPB 3 partially suppresses the HU sensitivity of 14 - 3 - 3 -deficient cells. Extension of our analysis showed that DPB 3 deletion causes partial rescue of fork restart defects as well as cell cycle defects of the 14 - 3 - 3 - deficient strain. However, further analysis with 2 D gel electrophoresis revealed faster fork progression in dpb 3 ∆ cells under conditions of low dNTPs, arguing that DPB 3 deletion alone is sufficient to accelerate replication forks and, overall, S phase progression. Contrary to what observed with DPB 3, deletion of the gene coding for the other accessory subunit of Polε, DPB 4, did not affect the slow HU recovery phenotype of 14 - 3 - 3 -deficient cells. Similarly, our analysis ruled out the possibility of an involvement of translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerases in the fork acceleration phenotype of dpb 3 ∆ cells. Last conducted experiments focused on understanding the molecular mechanism by which DPB 3 deletion affects the fork progression, the extent of checkpoint activation and the level of enriched ssDNA gaps upon HU treatment. Overall, our studies on physical and functional interactions between Bmh 1 and an accessory subunit of Pol ε reveal a novel function for Dpb 3 upon replication stress in S. cerevisiae. This study will help expanding our knowledge on pathways controlling processive DNA synthesis and its link to genomic stability...|$|R
