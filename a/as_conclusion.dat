Shankara's exegetical approach Samanvayat Tatparya Linga with Anvaya-Vyatireka, states that for proper understanding all texts must {{be examined in}} their entirety and then their intent established by six characteristics, which includes studying what is stated by the author to be his goal, what he repeats in his explanation, then what he states <b>as</b> <b>conclusion</b> and whether it can be epistemically verified. Not everything in any text, states Shankara, has equal weight and some ideas are the essence of any expert's textual testimony. This philosophical difference in scriptural studies, helped Shankara conclude that the Principal Upanishads primarily teach monism with teachings such as Tat tvam asi, while helping [...] conclude that qualified monism is at the foundation of Hindu spirituality.|$|E

50|$|Negation {{introduction}} {{states that}} if an absurdity can be drawn <b>as</b> <b>conclusion</b> from p then p must {{not be the case}} (i.e. p is false (classically) or refutable (intuitionistically) or etc.). Negation elimination states that anything follows from an absurdity. Sometimes negation elimination is formulated using a primitive absurdity sign ⊥. In this case the rule says that from p and ¬p follows an absurdity. Together with double negation elimination one may infer our originally formulated rule, namely that anything follows from an absurdity.|$|E

The classic RTS gameplay has been praised as the core strength of the game.Some reviews criticised the lack of variety: the campaign features no distinctive story line and the gameplay may feel repetitive, as simple aggressive rush tactics usual lead to a fast victory. The lopsided AI opponents which are merely just enough for warm-up play as well as sometimes bad pathfinding were additional criticised points. It has also been noted that the game is essentially a reskinned version of 8-Bit Armies, now with dragons instead of tanks.

5000|$|As for modal logic, the {{inference}} rules modus ponens and necessitation suffice also for dynamic logic {{as the only}} primitive rules it needs, as noted above. However, as usual in logic, many more rules {{can be derived from}} these {{with the help of the}} axioms. An example instance of such a derived rule in dynamic logic is that if kicking a broken TV once can't possibly fix it, then repeatedly kicking it can't possibly fix it either. Writing [...] for the action of kicking the TV, and [...] for the proposition that the TV is broken, dynamic logic expresses this inference as , having as premise [...] and <b>as</b> <b>conclusion</b> [...] The meaning of [...] is that it is guaranteed that after kicking the TV, it is broken. Hence the premise [...] means that if the TV is broken, then after kicking it once it will still be broken. [...] denotes the action of kicking the TV zero or more times. Hence the conclusion [...] means that if the TV is broken, then after kicking it zero or more times it will still be broken. For if not, then after the second-to-last kick the TV would be in a state where kicking it once more would fix it, which the premise claims can never happen under any circumstances.|$|E
