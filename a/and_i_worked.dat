25|$|Bob Summers, my brother-in-law, {{has come}} into his own over the years too. Bob <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> a lot on MGM records with the Mike Curb scene, early 1960s. He also was chief {{arranger}} for the Mike Curb Congregation, and they recorded some of my material, great too! Also Bob <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> at Capitol Records for Ken Nelson and Cliffie Stone, passed recently. Too many country artists to even name nearly all of them: Hank Thompson, Wynn Stewart, Rose Maddox and others. Roy Lanham did one of his better albums at the Sound House, Merced, in El Monte (my old stamping grounds) and Mary Ford's home place, 9840 Kale Street. Bruce Summers (who is no longer with us), a piano man whom I played with a few times; a real swinger too.|$|E
25|$|Around 1954, {{parties were}} held at Florance's house, {{referred}} to as 'The Hovel'. According to Peter Oyston: over those years my sister <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> out that we had 82 callers a week, not counting those who came more than once. It was constant open house. My stepfather would start a party with his muso friends while my mother was at the theatre. And then my mother would bring back the cast and any {{people who came to}} see the shows. And the taxi drivers and, if the police called to quieten us up, then the police would be invited in and they'd join the party too. It really was an extraordinary time.|$|E
25|$|Cassidy <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> on Dillinger and Van Meter {{simultaneously}} on June 3. While {{the work}} was being done, Dillinger and Van Meter changed off. The work {{that could be done}} while the patient was sitting up, that patient was in the sitting-room. The work that had to be done while the man was lying down, that patient was {{on the couch in the}} bedroom. They were changed back and forth according to the work to be done. The hands were sterilized, made aseptic with antiseptics, thoroughly washed with soap and water and used sterile gauze afterwards to keep them clean. Next, cutting instrument, knife was used to expose the lower skin...in other words, take off the epidermis and expose the derma, then alternately the acid and the alkaloid was applied as was necessary to produce the desired results.|$|E

500|$|Monaghan told MTV {{he thought}} the couple {{represents}} Eminem and Scott. The clip was produced by Kathy Angstadt and MaryAnn Tanedo of HSI Productions. Shortly before its release, Eminem reported in a press statement: [...] "Joseph <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> pretty closely together {{to make sure we}} got this right". He said the difficult topic resulted in a powerful video because of the contributions of Rihanna, Fox and Monaghan. Fox donated her appearance fee to the Soujourn House, a battered women's shelter. On August 5, 2010, the video premiered on MTV and the music video website Vevo.|$|E
500|$|I wanted {{somebody}} with a tremendous {{understanding of how to}} make a pop video, because my biggest challenge working with directors is that I am the director and I write the treatments and I get the fashion and I decide what it's about and it's very hard to find directors that will relinquish any sort of input from the artist. ... But Francis <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> together. ... It was collaborative. He's a really pop video director and a filmmaker. He did I Am Legend and I'm a huge Will Smith fan, so I knew he could execute the video in a way that I could give him all my weirdest, most psychotic ideas ... But it would come across to and be relevant to the public.|$|E
500|$|In November 2008, McEntire {{announced}} {{that she would be}} departing from her label of twenty-five years and signing with the Valory Music Group, an imprint of Big Machine Records (coincidentally distributed by MCA and Mercury's parent, Universal Music Group). Under MCA, she had sold a total of sixty-seven million records worldwide and won two Grammys. The switch to Valory reunited McEntire with the label's president, Scott Borchetta, who had worked as senior vice president of promotion at MCA during most of the 1990s. McEntire later commented on her label switch, stating, [...] "I am thrilled to be joining the Valory team. Scott <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> together on some of the biggest singles of my career, and I am excited to renew our partnership." ...|$|E

500|$|Following {{the first}} race, Kurt Busch drove to victory lane. During the press conference, Busch said, [...] "To be in those positions, {{you have to}} have a good {{drafting}} partner. I had that with Regan Smith , had it with [...] McMurray on Saturday night [...] But you can't be in those positions if you don't build a great race car." [...] Also by winning the race, Kurt Busch would be the leader at the start of the Daytona 500, after Earnhardt was involved in an accident. Second-place finisher Smith stated: [...] "Kurt (Busch) <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> good all day and we had good cars hooked up together. I hope we find each other and do the same thing on Sunday." [...] The first event took 58 minutes and 12 seconds to complete and the margin of victory was 0.065 seconds.|$|E
500|$|Series creator Chris Carter {{noted that}} the episode's {{creation}} [...] "was {{the culmination of a}} lot of ideas. Generally, when we pitch stories to the staff everyone comments on them, and Darin Morgan called this the kitchen sink episode, because it had so much in it, he didn't know how we would pull it off. But I'm very proud of the script. David Duchovny <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> quite closely on the story and {{he had a lot of}} input, and then I sat down and wrote the script". He felt that the episode ended the season in the best manner possible, asking more questions than it answered. The episode tried to make similar cliffhangers as the previous season finale, with revelations such as Mulder's father being part of the conspiracy and later killed to [...] "prove anything could happen in [...] The X-Files".|$|E
500|$|Bagwell {{made his}} first public {{appearance}} at Minute Maid Park {{since the end of}} his career on June 28, 2007. Former teammate and long-time friend Biggio had just logged his 3,000th career hit in the seventh inning against the Colorado Rockies. Bagwell, who was in the dugout, emerged to congratulate him. The Astros fans, who had momentarily quieted after cheering Biggio for his achievement, erupted into cheers again the moment Biggio dragged Bagwell onto the playing field and to the first base line. [...] "The thing with Baggy is that he <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> so hard here for this city and for this organization", Biggio remarked. [...] "We made so many sacrifices as far as playing the game and giving your body to a city, a team." [...] Together, they bowed to the crowd as Bagwell raised Biggio's arm, and returned to the dugout. Biggio was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2015.|$|E

500|$|John Slattery, who {{was later}} cast as Roger Sterling, {{originally}} auditioned to portray Don Draper. Slattery felt Don was the show's biggest draw and was disappointed upon hearing of his character's sparse screen time. He recalled, [...] "I really did prepare {{the thing and}} went in <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> hard on it and then read for Don and they actually gave me adjustments and I went and I did it again. And then they sort of said, 'Well, look, here’s the deal. We have a guy. The reason {{we asked you to}} come in and read for Draper is because we didn't think that you’d come in a read for Roger because there wasn’t that much Roger in the script.'" [...] During production of [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes," [...] Slattery admitted he was unsure of whether to continue working on Mad Men. [...] "I was on the fence a little bit, even while shooting it. And I think Matt finally was like, 'Look man, we’re not jerking you around here. We’re serious about this and I’ve really thought this out. I promise you this will be a great character {{and it will be a}} big part of the show.'" ...|$|E
500|$|When Tisdale was twelve, {{she sang}} for then-President Bill Clinton during an {{event at the}} White House {{as part of a}} troupe. Hoping to expand her career, Tisdale and her family moved to Los Angeles, California. She landed her first role in 1997, guest {{starring}} on an episode of both Smart Guy and 7th Heaven. During this time, she also began doing modeling work for Ford Models. The following year, Tisdale appeared as a voice actor in both An All Dogs Christmas Carol (1998) and A Bug's Life (1998). She guest starred in an episode of Boston Public in 2000, earning a 2000 Young Artist Award nomination for [...] "Best Guest Performance in a TV Drama". Tisdale continued to make guest appearances on television shows and appear in minor film roles throughout the following years, with roles in films such as Donnie Darko (2001) and The Mayor of Oyster Bay (2002). During this time, Tisdale continued to work and attend school, stating [...] "I was always in regular school <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> in clothing stores growing up. I didn't 'make it' until I was 18, so I had already graduated public school. I definitely feel like I had the best of both worlds." ...|$|E
500|$|When Windsor {{took over}} the role in 1994, she was unhappy with the way Peggy was being scripted. She has commented, [...] "a few things weren't quite right about Peggy at the beginning. On a purely {{superficial}} level, the wig didn't fit right. And the clothes weren't right either. They appeared too downmarket. I was particularly worried about how the character was viewed by the producer and writers. I saw her as much ballsier than they did. I think they envisioned Peggy as this rather sad, vulnerable lady who spent all her time worrying about her children." [...] However, early in 1995, EastEnders acquired a new executive producer, Corinne Hollingworth, who shared Windsor's vision of Peggy. It was Hollingworth who decided that Peggy would be a central character, the new landlady of The Queen Victoria public house, one of the soap's main focal points. Hollingworth stated that Peggy was [...] "not {{going to be allowed}} to just sit in some flat polishing her nails". Windsor has said: [...] "It was like a dream. [...] let me go out with the costume designer and choose Peggy's wardrobe, which needed {{to be a lot more}} flash and upmarket. Corinne <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> on getting Peggy right and I finally began to believe...".|$|E

[...] We were like brothers during that association at Michigan. There is no one person who contributed so much to the University of Michigan as this great trainer.

[...] He put men in shape, trained them and developed them. They were 'usable' all the time. He is a trainer who has his men in the finest mental condition possible.
