5000|$|The Mohair Recourse Loan Program is {{a program}} {{authorized}} by the emergency provisions of the FY1999 USDA appropriations act (P.L. 105-277) that made interest-free recourse loans of $2.00 per pound on mohair produced prior to October 1, 1998. Final date to obtain a loan was September 30, 1999. The producer-owned mohair used as loan security had to be stored in <b>approved</b> bonded <b>warehouses.</b> Loans matured not later than 1 year following disbursement. Under the 2002 farm bill (P.L. 107-171, Sec. 1201-1205), mohair was designated a “loan commodity” and made eligible for marketing assistance loans and loan deficiency payments (LDPs).|$|R

The proposal was unpopular, {{and it was not}} until 1803 that the system was actually adopted. That year, imported goods were to be placed in <b>warehouses</b> <b>approved</b> by the customs authorities, and importers were to give bonds for payment of duties when the goods were removed.|$|R
50|$|The cycle {{starts with}} the {{mortgage}} banker taking a loan application from the property buyer. Then the loan originator secures an investor (often a large institutional bank) to whom the loan will be sold, whether directly or through a securitization. This decision is generally based on an institutional investor's published rates for various types of mortgage loans, while {{the selection of a}} warehouse lender for a particular loan may vary based on the types of loan products allowed by the warehouse provider or investors in the loan <b>approved</b> by the <b>warehouse</b> lender to be on the line of credit.|$|R
