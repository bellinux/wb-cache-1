5|$|As the Vanir {{are often}} {{considered}} fertility gods, the Æsir–Vanir War {{has been proposed}} {{as a reflection of}} the invasion of local fertility cults somewhere in regions inhabited by the Germanic peoples by a more aggressive, warlike cult. This has been proposed as an <b>analogy</b> <b>of</b> the invasion of the Indo-Europeans. Georges Dumézil stated that the war need not necessarily be understood in terms of historicity more than any other myth however.|$|E
5|$|The <b>analogy</b> <b>of</b> a {{game was}} first {{proposed}} by Hans-Georg Gadamer {{in an attempt}} to demonstrate the epistemic unity of language. He suggested that language is like a game which everyone participates in and is played by a greater being. Gadamer believed that language makes up the fundamental structure of reality and that human language participates in a greater language; Christianity teaches this to be the divine word which created the world and was incarnate in Jesus Christ.|$|E
5|$|The place-name 'Blyth' {{is first}} attested in 1130 as 'Blida', and takes {{its name from}} the river Blyth. The river-name comes from the Old English {{adjective}} 'blithe' meaning 'gentle' or 'merry', and still used today. Interestingly, the town of Blyth is referred to as 'Blithmuth' in 1236 and 'Blithemuth' in 1250. Had this name persisted, the town would today be referred to as 'Blythmouth', on the <b>analogy</b> <b>of</b> Tynemouth to the south.|$|E

5|$|A {{study by}} {{astronomer}} Steven J. Dick at the United States Naval Observatory considered the cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact by analyzing events of similar {{significance in the}} history of science. The study argues that the impact would be most strongly influenced by the information content of the message received, if any. It distinguishes short-term and long-term impact. Seeing radio-based contact as a more plausible scenario than a visit from extraterrestrial spacecraft, the study rejects the commonly stated <b>analogy</b> <b>of</b> European colonization of the Americas as an accurate model for information-only contact, preferring events of profound scientific significance, such as the Copernican and Darwinian revolutions, as more predictive of how humanity might be impacted by extraterrestrial contact.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Aristotle {{observed}} that the child does not take just any form, but is given it by the parents' seeds, which combine. These seeds thus contain form, or in modern terms information. Aristotle makes clear that he sometimes intends this third sense by giving the <b>analogy</b> <b>of</b> a woodcarving. It takes its form from wood (its material cause); the tools and carving technique used to make it (its efficient cause); and the design laid out for it (its eidos or embedded information). Aristotle further emphasises the informational nature of form by arguing that a body is compounded of elements like earth and fire, just as a word is compounded of letters in a specific order.|$|E
5|$|Professor Nathan Katz {{writes of}} the <b>analogy</b> <b>of</b> a burning building, {{used by the}} Buddha in the Lotus Sutra, which casts {{religious}} language as imperative. In the analogy, a father sees his children {{at the top of}} a burning building. He persuades them to leave, but only by promising them toys if they leave. Katz argues that the message of the parable is not that the Buddha has been telling lies; rather, he believes that the Buddha was illustrating the imperative use of language. Katz believes that religious language is an imperative and an invitation, rather than a truth-claim.|$|E

5|$|Julius Seelye Bixler {{reviewed}} the book twice, in 1952 and 1953. In his first review {{he wrote that}} he believed Stace was trying to have his {{cake and eat it}} with regards to the truth of both naturalism and mysticism. Bixler also wonders whether the revelation of God can really be free of concepts and thus whether time and eternity are utterly unrelated as Stace maintains. He identifies points in Stace’s thought where there is continuity between these two states and mystical language does appear to refer to concepts. Finally he rejects the book’s <b>analogy</b> <b>of</b> mystical experience to the evocative power of art, maintaining that art must be somewhat related to logic. Nonetheless, Bixler does concur that the book is a fascinating confessio fidei and personal statement. A year later, he reviewed Time and Eternity alongside Religion and the Modern Mind. As well as reiterating the points he had made earlier, Bixler judges the second book more favourably and recommends reading the two together to better understand the problems they address.|$|E
5|$|Stratton wrote Experimental Psychology and its Bearing upon Culture {{to explain}} both typical {{psychological}} experiment methodology {{and how the}} results obtained answered philosophical problems. The book covered experimental results in psychology and how they influenced overall social behavior and the everyday cultural life of people. It did so {{by looking at the}} history of experimental psychology, and then surveying experimental methods covering both their applications and limits. Stratton pointed out how psychological experiments differed from the ones in physiology. The survey of experiments also included studies on mental perception, including among the blind. Stratton noted that the blind did have a sense of space. He also described how measurements of mental phenomena were both possible and being done in practice, though he did believe the results had to be interpreted on a psychic scale different from the usual physical ones used for measures such as lengths and weights. He rejected the argument the mind was unitary and could not be studied by splitting it into parts, by drawing on the <b>analogy</b> <b>of</b> studying a tree by looking at its constituent parts, themselves not functionally trees. He presumed sensations were akin to trees in how they could be split up into parts.|$|E

40|$|Current {{research}} data on identifying analogies between word pairs has often overlooked {{the implications of}} the type of relations used. However, although the identification of different types of relations clearly involves distinct processes, not enough attention has been given to the identification of these differences. This study aimed to compare two semantic relations (<b>analogies</b> <b>of</b> belonging and inclusion) regarding the accuracy and response time in identification. 79 college students (18 to 26 years old) participated. Data analysis revealed a better performance and reduced response time to detect <b>analogies</b> <b>of</b> the belonging type. The theoretical implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Motivation – The {{purpose of}} this article is to reinvigorate debate {{concerning}} the nature <b>of</b> <b>analogy</b> and broaden the scope of current conceptions <b>of</b> <b>analogy.</b> Research approach – An analysis of the history of the concept <b>of</b> <b>analogy,</b> case studies on the use <b>of</b> <b>analogy</b> in problem-solving, cognitive research on analogy comprehension, and a naturalistic inquiry into the various functions <b>of</b> <b>analogy.</b> Findings and Implications – Psychological theories and computational models have generally relied on: (a) A single set of ontological concepts (a property called “similarity ” and a structuralist categorization of types of semantic relations) (b) A single form category (i. e., the classic four-term analogy), and (c) A single set of morphological distinctions (e. g., verbal versus pictorial analogies). The taxonomy presented here distinguishes functional kinds <b>of</b> <b>analogy,</b> each <b>of</b> which presents an opportunity for research on aspects of reasoning that have been largely unrecognized. Originality/Value – The various functional kinds <b>of</b> <b>analogy</b> will each require their own treatment in macrocognitive theories and computational models.
