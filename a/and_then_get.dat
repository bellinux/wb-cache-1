5|$|Corythosaurus {{is known}} from many {{complete}} specimens, including the nearly complete holotype found by Brown in 1911. The holotype skeleton is only missing {{the last section}} of the tail, {{and part of the}} forelimbs, but was preserved with impressions of polygonal scales. Corythosaurus is known from many skulls with tall crests. The crests resemble the crests of the cassowary and a Corinthian helmet. The most likely function of the crest is thought to be vocalization. As in a trombone, sound waves would travel through many chambers in the crest, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>get</b> amplified when Corythosaurus exhaled. A Corythosaurus specimen has been preserved with its last meal in its chest cavity. Inside the cavity were remains of conifer needles, seeds, twigs, and fruits: Corythosaurus probably fed on all of these.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} African nations {{did not show}} up in time, for various reasons such as {{difficulties}} flying through Istanbul, and finalisation of monetary arrangements (teams must pay first, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>get</b> reimbursed later). Former Kenyan Olympic participant and owner of the website Kenya Chess Masala said that the issue just paints Africa in bad image. On 5 September, the organisers confirmed at a press-conference that the host-nation was ready to pay for the poorer nations to travel. Bhari confirmed that the travel expenses were the main problem and wrote that 116 out of the planned 187 federations were on a travel subsidy, including his native Kenya whose players had not shown in the first rounds, though. He also explained that one of the biggest issues was the timing of the funding and that the teams were expected to pay on their own and be reimbursed upon arrival. Finally, Bhari had already reminded other federations to start planning their travel expenses for the 43rd Chess Olympiad in Batumi in 2018. In the end, 10 African nations did not arrive (Kenya, Cameroon, Mali, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Burundi, Liberia, Seychelles, Senegal, Central African Republic).|$|E
5|$|Charles {{writes a}} love song for Marge, who seems {{completely}} oblivious to him until he tells her {{that he is in}} love with her. She explains to him that she loves Homer, and that he should tell his wife how he feels about her. He agrees, and decides to take Marge back to Homer <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>get</b> rid of Verity. When the two arrive in Springfield, Homer and the children are ecstatic to see Marge. However, Verity has already decided to leave Charles, and has found a new partner: Marge's sister Patty. They were brought together by their hatred for Homer and begin to insult him. When an offended Homer threatens to vote in favor of a law that prohibits same-sex couples from adopting children, Patty forces Homer into confessing that he is too lazy to actually do it. At the end of the episode, Homer plays a guitar and expresses his undying love for his newly bought plasma television and (to a lesser extent) Marge.|$|E

Elliott raps her opening verse {{from the top of}} a pile of large tires while Ciara makes her debut in a gray jumpsuit with square aviator sunglasses. She soon appears in a slender black leotard and walks seductively along a construction walkway. Ciara and her dancers move to a dune in front of the site, where they perform a group choreography. The dancers wear white tops, torn blue jeans, construction belts and goggles. The second verse features an intense dance and switches halfway through to Ciara in a turquoise PVC dress and black strap stilettos, dancing in front of a pile of tires. She and her dancers return to the dune and dance to Elliott's words. The video ends in the sand dune as Ciara and her dancers slowly drop to the ground <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>get</b> back up.|$|E

The craft flipped over and fell onto the eastbound lanes of the highway. Both pilot and passenger were killed, and 4,000 customers in the area lost power. A traffic backup of several miles was rerouted onto the road's shoulder around the crash site until the road was reopened {{two and a half}} hours later.

However, Sam woke up and spoke harshly to him, and the opportunity for redemption was lost. Gollum followed through with his plan and led Frodo and Sam into Shelob's Lair.

25|$|As {{the series}} progressed, {{the scope of}} the plots expanded. Many early episodes were largely self-contained, with few plot-lines {{mentioned}} again, but the show developed a story arc and an ongoing episodic dimension. After Grandad died following the death of actor Lennard Pearce, his younger brother Uncle Albert (Buster Merryfield) emerged and moved in with Del and Rodney. After years of searching, both Del and Rodney find long-term love, in the form of Raquel (Tessa Peake-Jones) and Cassandra (Gwyneth Strong) respectively; Del also has a son with Raquel, Damien (played by five actors, most recently Ben Smith). Rodney and Cassandra marry, separate <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>get</b> back together again. Cassandra miscarries, but then she and Rodney eventually have a baby. Rodney finds out who his real father was. The Trotters finally become millionaires, lose their fortune, and then regain some of it.|$|E
25|$|It is very {{uncommon}} for patients not {{to respond to}} TB treatment at all (even transiently), because this implies resistance at base-line {{to all of the}} drugs in the regimen. Patients who fail to get any response at all while on treatment should first of all be questioned very closely about whether or not they have been taking their medicines, and perhaps even be admitted to hospital to be observed taking their treatment. Blood or urine samples may be taken to check for malabsorption of TB drugs. If it can be shown that they are fully compliant with their medication, then the probability that they have another diagnosis (perhaps in addition to the diagnosis of TB) is very high. These patients should have their diagnosis carefully reviewed and specimens obtained for TB culture and sensitivity testing. Patients who get better <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>get</b> worse again should likewise be question very closely about adherence to treatment. If adherence is confirmed then they should be investigated for resistant TB (including MDR-TB), even if a specimen has already been obtained for microbiology before commencing treatment.|$|E
25|$|In Tlalpan, {{settlements}} are in Ajusco Medio, Pedregales and Padierna, {{where the}} mountainous terrain and/or volcanic rock severely limits {{the ability to}} provide services, often leading to residents creating septic pits. Since 2003, illegal settlements in Tlalpan have grown from 148(peligra), to 191 settlements that the government recognizes the existence of. Many settlements have occurred because communal owners of ejidos have illegally sold parts of their land at cheap prices to settlers {{on the outskirts of}} the city proper. Most illegal building is done by the very poor but there are also cases in which those which money illegally take over large sections of land for their own use. Illegal settlements have been made by individual families but increasingly developers are working to build illegal settlements in protected areas as well, by buying land and creating subdivisions with services, hoping to fix things with authorities later. In the early 2000s, the borough conducted over 125 operations to evict illegal settlements, dismantling over 440 housing units, but since 2005, the borough no longer has the authority to do this. Many of these illegal settlements seek <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>get</b> court orders prohibiting their removal and demanding services, first potable water then drainage.|$|E

25|$|At Dover, Earnhardt won {{his second}} pole of the season, setting a new {{qualifying}} speed record of 161.849mph. This {{was the first}} time since 2002 that he had recorded more than one pole during a season. During the race, Earnhardt would lead 80 laps, but would finish 2nd to Jimmie Johnson. The following week at Kansas, he finished 8th. Making his 500th Cup start at Charlotte, Earnhardt led 19 laps early, but finished 15th while battling a tight race car. The following week at Talladega, Earnhardt led 38 laps and was about to receive a push from Austin Dillon to overtake Jamie McMurray on the last lap when Ricky Stenhouse Jr. tapped Dillon, causing that driver to spin out <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>get</b> hit by Casey Mears, leaving Earnhardt with a 2nd-place finish. The following week at Martinville, Earnhardt earned an 8th-place finish. The next week at Texas, he had a solid night, finishing 2nd to Johnson {{for the third time in}} the season (after Daytona and Dover). The next week at Phoenix, Earnhardt started by being forced to pit with a loose wheel early, putting him a lap down. However, a caution allowed him to use the free pass to get back on the lead lap and salvage a 4th-place finish.|$|E

500|$|Male giraffes {{use their}} necks as weapons in combat, a {{behaviour}} known as [...] "necking". Necking {{is used to}} establish dominance and males that win necking bouts have greater reproductive success. This behaviour occurs at low or high intensity. In low intensity necking, the combatants rub and lean against each other. The male that can hold itself more erect wins the bout. In high intensity necking, the combatants will spread their front legs and swing their necks at each other, attempting to land blows with their ossicones. The contestants will try to dodge each other's blows <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>get</b> ready to counter. The power of a blow depends on {{the weight of the}} skull and the arc of the swing. A necking duel can last more than half an hour, depending on how well matched the combatants are.
