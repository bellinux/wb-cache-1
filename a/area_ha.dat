The primate {{was thought to be}} extinct until the 1990s, when a small population was discovered in Na Hang District in Tuyên Quang Province of Vietnam. Heavy poaching for food as well as the wildlife black market and the destruction of habitat are the main reasons why the Tonkin snub-nosed monkey {{is considered one of the}} planet's most critically endangered primate species [...]By 2008, when a small population with three infants was discovered in a remote forest, fewer than 250 of the primates were thought to exist. In December 2013, Fauna & Flora international released the result of a population survey conducted between September and October of that year in the Khau Ca Species and Habitat Conservation <b>Area,</b> <b>Ha</b> Giang province, Vietnam. The survey identified between 108-113 individuals alive in the conservation zone, nearly half of the standing estimate for world population and the highest number at the site since populations began to be monitored. Researchers took this as an encouraging sign that conservation efforts were making an impact on the species' steeply declining numbers.|$|E

This has been made by a descriptive statistical analysis and a factor analysis was used to identify factors which characterize the soybean crop and also a classification or clustering between provinces with similar characteristics. The information parameters studied were: the tendency and dispersion measures for soybean yield of 15 provinces in which it was grown between the 2001 / 02 and 2010 / 11 or from 2001 / 02 to 2010 / 11; the correlations between area harvested acreage, seeded area, production and performance, and the factors that bind some variables that characterize the soybean crop that allows a grouping between provinces with similar characteristics. Analyses were performed by using data obtained from: 1) MinAgri (last 10 seasons) b) 2001 National Census c) CNA 2002. From a group of variables: region extension (ha); population density 2001; population of the region in 2001; NBI 2001, literate people older than 10 years 2001; illiterate people older than 10 years 2001; permanent workers in the farming sector 2002; seeded <b>area</b> (<b>ha)</b> 2002; cultivated area of oily plants (ha) 2002; tractors 2002; harvesters 2002; seeded <b>area</b> (<b>ha)</b> 2001 / 02; harvested <b>area</b> (<b>ha)</b> 2001 / 02; production (Tn) 2001 / 02.

The calculations incorporated one crop growth period to obtain the following: (1) water volume (m 3) required to grow one hectare of crop; (2) crop yield (kg) per 1, 000  m 3 (264, 172 gal) water volume; (3) total water volume (m 3) required per metric ton of crop produced; (4) daily water volume (m 3) required per metric ton of crop produced; and (5) land <b>area</b> (<b>ha)</b> required per metric ton of crop.|$|E
30|$|The fit of {{the model}} was significant, and the p values for <b>area</b> (<b>ha),</b> {{discount}} rate (%), rotation (year) and site index class were all less than 0.01. The constants representing area and rotation period are positive, which means that SEV increases when the rotation period and/or the harvested area increase. On the other hand, the constants representing discount rate and site index class are negative, which means that SEV decreases when the discount rate and/or the site index class increase. This multiple regression analysis identifies the significant factors that affect profitability and presents a statistic model that can simplify the calculation of forest profitability at other planted forests in Japan.|$|E

The results indicate that gated communities are mostly homogeneous enclaves. Their relevance to segregation patterns is structured through buffer zones: stronger social discontinuities cannot be found matching gated communities boundaries, but at a certain distance from the walls. Overall, gated communities lead to increased segregation by reinforcing the already existing levels of racial residential segregation in each metropolitan <b>area.</b> <b>ha</b> ls h...|$|E
40|$|NoThe {{commercial}} success of hydroxyapatite (HA) filled polyethylene composite has generated {{growing interest in}} improving the processability of the composite.

The results showed that low surface <b>area</b> <b>HA</b> filled composite exhibited better injection processing characteristics through improved rheological responses. The effect of reducing the surface area of the filler is to require less polyethylene to wet the filler and allows more polyethylene {{to be involved in}} the flow processes.
