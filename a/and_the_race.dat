5|$|In 1848, Kentucky Democrats {{nominated}} Linn Boyd for governor, but Boyd {{declined the}} nomination. Powell {{was chosen to}} replace Boyd on the ticket, {{largely due to the}} influence of James Guthrie. The Whig party nominated Senator John J. Crittenden, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> was complicated by former Vice President Richard Mentor Johnson's announcement that he would run as an independent Democratic candidate. Knowing the Democrats' chances were dimmed by having two candidates in the race, Powell arranged a meeting with Johnson, following which the latter withdrew his candidacy and pledged his support to Powell. Nevertheless, Crittenden won the election.|$|E

On lap 127 Clint Bowyer passed Kenseth, holding the lead for two laps until a second yellow flag was displayed due to debris. Hamlin and Michael Waltrip staggered their pit stops, enabling each of them to lead a lap under the caution. Bowyer regained the lead after Waltrip stopped, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> restarted on lap 134. Kenseth moved back into the lead on the next lap, with Bowyer falling back to tenth.|$|E
5|$|Regulations {{meant that}} the {{original}} sixth lap would be deleted <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> would be restarted {{from the beginning of}} said lap.

The race ran to a total of 58 laps, five from the first section and 53 from the second section.|$|E
5|$|Some {{teams had}} made {{modifications}} to their cars {{in preparation for}} the event. Honda introduced a more powerful version of its V10 engine for Saturday's qualifying session <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>race.</b> Sauber brought lighter components to reduce the weight of their cars and the Williams team arrived with a revised rear wing.

5|$|Some teams made {{modifications}} to their cars {{in preparation for}} the Grand Prix. Williams, Jaguar, Ferrari, Sauber and Prost all brought updated front wings. Ferrari also introduced a new underfloor and brought more powerful versions of their V10 engines for qualifying <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>race.</b> Williams installed extra cooling on their cars to combat high temperatures in qualifying. Minardi planned to introduce a new revision to their cars aerodynamic package which included a new engine cover, a titanium gearbox and rear suspension geometry. The team decided to only test the gearbox during the first free practice session.|$|E

5|$|The race began {{without a}} {{formation}} lap {{and despite the}} slow speed, drivers struggled for grip on the wet surface. After three laps under the safety car, conditions were unchanged; drivers reported on the circuit's condition via radio <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> was suspended. Light rain prevented the resumption of the Grand Prix for over forty-five minutes until the marshals and road sweeping trucks removed some of the excess water and dirt on the track. Resin on the newly laid track surface had prevented water from soaking into the ground. The rain had eased slightly during the suspension. Teams were allowed to change the set-up of their cars, which were largely optimised for dry weather conditions.|$|E
5|$|With {{the race}} {{scheduled}} for 19 June, the event conflicted with {{the conclusion of}} the 2016 24 Hours of Le Mans. Force India driver Nico Hülkenberg, who won the 2015 race with Porsche {{would not be able to}} return and defend his title, leading to accusations that Formula One Management had deliberately scheduled the race to conflict with Le Mans and prevent Formula One drivers from participating. In May 2016, the Azerbaijan government decided to abandon the use of daylight saving time, prompting event organisers to change the start time of the race. The revised start time negated the clash between the start of the Grand Prix <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> in Le Mans.|$|E
5|$|After Trump {{withdrew from}} {{sponsoring}} the event, DuPont became the primary sponsor. Between 1991 and 1995, national amateur teams took part alongside professional teams. The event attracted well-known competitors, including Lance Armstrong and Greg LeMond, and {{was attended by}} high-profile European-based professional cycling teams. In 1996, the Union Cycliste Internationale upgraded it to a 2.1 ranked race, meaning that amateurs could no longer compete. This made the race the highest ranked outside of Europe and the first North American stage race to be ranked 2.1. The 1996 race {{was the subject of}} a number of legal issues, including a dispute over rights to its profits between the race owners, Billy Packer and president of the United States Cycling Federation Mike Plant, which resulted in them suing each other. DuPont itself was involved in a dispute about the anti-homosexual employment policies of the local government in Greenville, South Carolina, with the company insisting that the race organizers exclude the city from the route. After 1996, DuPont dropped its sponsorship <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> has not been run since.|$|E

5|$|Amphibious {{landings}} at Inchon by X Corps hit North Korean {{forces from}} behind, allowing I Corps and IX Corps {{to break out}} of Pusan. Four days later I Corps troops pushed northward against crumbling enemy opposition to establish contact with forces of the 7th Infantry Division driving southward from the beachhead. Major elements of the North Korean Army were destroyed and cut off in this aggressive penetration; the link-up was effected south of Suwon on 26 September. The offensive was continued northwards, past Seoul, and across the 38th Parallel on 1 October. The momentum of the attack was maintained, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> to the North Korean capitol, Pyongyang, ended on 19 October when elements of the South Korean 1st Infantry Division and U.S. 1st Cavalry Division both entered the city. The advance continued, but against unexpectedly stiffening enemy resistance. On 25 October the first Chinese prisoners on the Eighth Army front were taken by I Corps troops. By the end of October the city of Chongju, forty miles from the Yalu River border of North Korea, had been captured.|$|E
5|$|At the New South Wales Championships in January 1997, Thorpe's time of 3min 59.43s in the 400m {{was eight}} seconds faster than his {{previous}} personal best; {{it made him}} the first 14-year-old to cover the distance {{in less than four}} minutes on Australian soil. Ranked fourth for the event countrywide, Thorpe went into the Australian Championships in Adelaide as a serious contender for selection in the national team for the 1997 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Fukuoka, Japan. With a top-three finish and a specific qualifying time required for selection, Thorpe focused on the 400m freestyle after injuries to world record holder Kieren Perkins and Daniel Kowalski; both had won Olympic medals in the event. Thorpe went on to win bronze behind 16-year-old Queenslander Grant Hackett, setting a new personal best of 3min 53.44s. The time was a world record for his age group <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> was the first of many battles with Hackett.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the {{formation}} lap, Daniil Kvyat was unable to reach the grid due to an electrical issue. Therefore, the field went to another formation lap <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> was shortened accordingly to 57 laps. At the start proper, Vettel got away well, passing through both Mercedes cars into the lead, followed by his teammate Räikkönen in second. As Rosberg and Hamilton went through the first corner, Hamilton was forced wide and lost additional places, falling down to sixth. Kevin Magnussen suffered a puncture on the first lap and made a pit stop for new tyres, while Esteban Gutiérrez had mechanical issues {{at the back of the}} field. Hamilton was able to pass fifth-placed Massa on lap four, as Vettel was leading from Räikkonen, Rosberg and Verstappen. On lap eight, Sainz was the first of the top-ten runners to pit for new tyres. Meanwhile, Hamilton was unable to pass Verstappen for fourth, discussing alternative tactics with his team on the radio communication. Pascal Wehrlein had a good start in his debut as well, running in 14th place at that point of the race.|$|E

5|$|Borgarello won {{his second}} stage with his {{victory in the}} seventh stage, out-sprinting Micheletto and Carlo Durando. In the final sprint, Micheletto felt that Durando encroached him and moved ahead; this action caused the Italian fans to rush on to the track in anger. The police then moved the two riders to a bar, until the crowd dispersed. Micheletto won his second stage of the race two days later. Before {{the start of the}} final stage, Micheletto became sick and Pavesi {{convinced}} him to continue the race and finish the final stage. Borgarello won his third stage of the race, while Atala-Dunlop consolidated their lead <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> win by having two riders, Micheletto and Galetti, finish in the top four.|$|E
5|$|Caracciola {{used the}} prize money—17,000Reichsmarks—to {{set up a}} Mercedes-Benz {{dealership}} on the prestigious Kurfürstendamm in Berlin. He also married his girlfriend, Charlotte, whom he had met in 1923 while working at the Mercedes-Benz outlet in Dresden. He continued racing in domestic competitions, returning again to Freiburg {{to compete in the}} Flying Kilometre race where he set a new sports car record in the new Mercedes-Benz 2-litre Model K, and finished first. Caracciola entered the Klausenpass hillclimb and set a new touring car record; he also won the touring car class at the Semmering hillclimb before driving a newly supercharged 1914 Mercedes Grand Prix car over the same route to set the fastest time of the day for any class. The recently completed Nürburgring was the host of the 1927 Eifelrennen, a race which had been held on public roads in the Eifel mountains since 1922. Caracciola won the first race on the track, and returned to the Nürburgring a month later for the 1927 German Grand Prix, but his car broke down <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> was won by Otto Merz. However, he won 11 competitions in 1927, almost all of them in the Ferdinand Porsche-developed Mercedes-Benz Model S.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{rain from}} Typhoon Phanfone made the track surface wet and reduced visibility. Starting {{from behind the}} safety car, the race was stopped after two laps and resumed 20 minutes later. Rosberg {{immediately}} fended off a passing manoeuvre by Hamilton heading into the first corner. His car then experienced oversteer, and Hamilton reduced the time deficit between them. Hamilton challenged Rosberg for the lead {{over the next four}} laps, overtook him on the 29th lap and pulled away. Jules Bianchi made contact with the rear of a tractor crane at Dunlop Curve on the 43rd lap that was tending to Adrian Sutil's car (which had crashed one lap earlier) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> was prematurely ended three laps later. The race result was counted back two laps, and Hamilton was declared the winner.|$|E
