3000|$|An {{interesting}} {{approach to}} audio feature generation, with similar goals to EDS, was pursued in parallel by Mierswa and Morik [49], based on earlier work on time series feature generation [20]. They proposed {{a framework for}} extracting domain-dependent [...] "method trees", representing ad hoc features for a time series. They applied their framework to music genre classification and reported an improvement over approaches that use off-the-shelf audio features [50]. The proposed method trees are essentially BOF features constructed from basic <b>audio</b> <b>operators,</b> {{with the addition of}} a complexity constraint (method trees are designed to have polynomial complexity). Using this method, Schuller et al. [51] reported an improvement in classifier performance in the domain of speech emotion recognition.|$|R

3000|$|The {{driving force}} behind the design of EDS and of our {{primitive}} <b>audio</b> <b>operators</b> is that the generated features should be optimally interesting (statistically) and simple (syntactically). To this end, the feature generation should exploit a large amount of knowledge about signal processing, as was demonstrated by Scheirer's tempo example. Without this knowledge, the feature space generated would be too small to contain interesting features, or would include features which are only superficially better than well-known ones. Moreover, some kernels (e.g., Boolean or arithmetic) embedded in classifiers (such as support vector machines, SVMs) are able to automatically reconstruct implicit feature combinations at the training phase [59]. These may incorporate domain-specific knowledge [60], and they eliminate the need for an extra and costly feature generation phase. Therefore, the primary task for feature generation is the construction of features containing in-depth signal information that cannot be extracted or reconstructed otherwise. This [...] "representational density" [...] argument was translated into a series of important extensions to the basic genetic programming algorithm. These are described in the next section, beginning with the definition of our core concept: analytical features.|$|R

5000|$|In {{devices such}} as two-way radios (also known as radiotelephones), the squelch on a local {{receiver}} can be adjusted with a knob, others have push buttons or a sequence of button presses.

40|$|With {{advanced}} autonomy, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) operations {{will likely}} be conducted by single operators controlling multiple UAVs. As operator attention is divided across multiple supervisory tasks, {{there is a need}} to support the operator's awareness of the state of the tasks for safe and effective task management. This research explores enhancing audio cues of UAV interfaces for this futuristic control of multiple UAVs by a single operator. This thesis specifically assesses the value of continuous and discrete audio cues as indicators of course-deviations or late-arrivals to targets for UAV missions with single and multiple UAVs. In particular, this thesis addresses two questions: (1) when compared with discrete audio, does continuous audio better aid human supervision of UAV operations, and (2) is the effectiveness of the discrete or continuous audio support dependent on operator workload? An experiment was carried out on the Multiple Autonomous Unmanned Vehicle Experiment (MAUVE) test bed with 44 military participants. Specifically, two continuous audio alerts were mapped to two human supervisory tasks within MAUVE. These continuous alerts were tested against single beep discrete alerts. The results show that the use of the continuous audio alerts enhances a single operator's performance in monitoring single and multiple, semi-autonomous vehicles. The results also emphasize the necessity to properly integrate the continuous audio with other auditory alarms and visual representations in a display, as it is possible for discrete audio alerts to be masked by continuous <b>audio,</b> leaving <b>operators</b> reliant on the visual aspects of the display. by Hudson D.

3000|$|The {{traditional}} view of feature generation, {{inspired by}} supervised concept induction, {{is that the}} performance of classifiers can be boosted if the [...] "natural" [...] features are not expressive enough. In this context, feature generation is an additional method for improving classifier performance, along with feature selection, kernel parameter tuning, and boosting. The situation is different when the items to classify are raw signals, as no [...] "natural" [...] features are known a priori. However, {{there is a huge}} body of technical knowledge about particular signals types (e.g., <b>audio)</b> and particular <b>operators.</b> For the most part, the link between signals and features for a particular classification task is still performed heuristically and manually in the signal processing research community. Here we introduce analytical features, in association with a feature generation scheme that produces feature sets adequate for arbitrary supervised audio classification problems. For efficiency, the generation of AFs exploits explicit knowledge representation constructs, notably heuristics, rewriting rules, and function patterns, all based on the AF dimensional typing system. We have shown that AFs improve classifier performance on concrete and difficult classification problems. More importantly, they fill the gap between the body of scientific knowledge about audio signals, and the feature identification problem inherent to all signal classification tasks. In this respect, AFs represent the knowledge-based counterpart of feature generation studies.|$|R
40|$|A future {{implementation}} of {{unmanned aerial vehicle}} (UAV) operations is having a single operator control multiple UAVs. The research presented here explores possible avenues of enhancing audio cues of UAV interfaces for this futuristic control of multiple UAVs by a single operator. This project specifically evaluates the value of continuous and discrete audio cues as indicators of course deviations or late arrivals to targets for UAV missions. It also looks at {{the value of the}} audio cues in single and multiple UAV scenarios. To this end, an experiment was carried out on the Multiple Autonomous Unmanned Vehicle Experimental (MAUVE) test bed developed in the Humans and Automation Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with 44 military participants. Specifically, two continuous audio alerts were mapped to two human supervisory tasks within MAUVE. One of the continuous audio alerts, an oscillating course deviation alert was mapped to UAV course deviations which occurred over a continual scale. The other continuous audio alert tested was a modulated late arrival alert which alerted the operator when a UAV was going to be late to a target. In this case the continuous audio was mapped to a discrete event in that the UAV was either on time or late to a target. The audio was continuous in that it was continually on and alerting the participant to {{the current state of the}} UAV. It either was playing a tone indicating the UAV was on time to a target or playing a tone indicating the UAV was late to a target. These continuous alerts were tested against more traditional single beep alerts which acted as discrete alerts. The beeps were discrete in that when they were used for monitoring course deviations a single beep was played when the UAV got to specific threshold off of the course or for late arrivals a single beep was played when the UAV became late. The results show that the use of the continuous audio alerts enhances a single operator’s performance in monitoring single and multiple semi-autonomous vehicles. However, the results also emphasize the necessity to properly integrate the continuous audio with the other auditory alarms and visual representations in a display, as it is possible for discrete audio alerts to be lost in aural saliency of continuous <b>audio,</b> leaving <b>operators</b> reliant on the visual aspects of the display.
