50|$|On the {{question}} of developing a new doctrine to attach liability the court commented that;:We must also deal with one other question which was seriously debated before us and that question is {{as to what is}} the measure of liability of an enterprise which is engaged in a hazardous or inherently dangerous industry, if by reason of an accident occurring in such industry, persons die or are injured. Does the rule in Rylands v. Fletcher apply or is there any other principle on which the liability can be determined? The rule in Rylands v. Fletcher was evolved in the year 1866 and it provides that a person who for his own purposes being on to his land and collects and keeps there anything likely to do mischief if it escapes must keep it at his peril and, if he fails to do so, is prima facie liable for the damage which is the natural consequence of its escape. The liability under this rule is strict and it is no defence that the thing escaped without that person's wilful act, default or neglect or even that he had no knowledge of its existence. This rule laid down a principle of liability that if a person who brings on to his land and collects and keeps there anything likely to do harm and such thing escapes and does damage to another, he is liable to compensate for the damage caused. Of course, this rule applies only to non-natural user of the land and it does not apply to things naturally on the land or where the escape is due to an act of God and an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stranger</b> or the default of the person injured or where the thing which escapes is present by the consent of the person injured or in certain cases where there is statutory authority.:This rule evolved in the 19th Century at a time when all these developments of science and technology had not taken place cannot afford any guidance in evolving any standard of liability consistent with the constitutional norms and the needs of the present day economy and social structure. We need not feel inhibited by this rule which was evolved in this context of a totally different kind of economy. Law has to grow in order to satisfy the needs of the fast changing society and keep abreast with the economic developments taking place in the country.:We cannot allow our judicial thinking to be constricted by reference to the law as it prevails in England or for the matter of that in any other foreign country.:We are of the view that an enterprise which is engaged in a hazardous or inherently dangerous industry which poses a potential threat to {{the health and safety of}} the persons working in the factory and residing in the surrounding areas owes an absolute and non-delegable duty to the community to ensure that no harm results to anyone on account of hazardous or inherently dangerous nature of the activity which it has undertaken.:The enterprise must be held to be under an obligation to provide that the hazardous or inherently dangerous activity in which it is engaged must be conducted with the highest standards of safety and if any harm results on account of such activity, the enterprise must be absolutely liable to compensate for such harm and it should be no answer to the enterprise to say that it had taken all reasonable care and that the harm occurred without any negligence on its part.:We would therefore hold that where an enterprise is engaged in a hazardous or inherently dangerous activity and harm results to anyone on account of an accident in the operation of such hazardous or inherently dangerous activity resulting, for example, in escape of toxic gas the enterprise is strictly and absolutely liable to compensate all those who are affected by the accident and such liability is not subject to any of the exceptions which operate vis-Ã -vis the tortious principle of strict liability under the rule in Rylands v. Fletcher. We would also like to point out that the measure of compensation in the kind of cases referred to in the preceding paragraph must be co-related to the magnitude and capacity of the enterprise because such compensation must have a deterrent effect. The larger and more prosperous the enterprise, the greater must be the amount of compensation payable by it for the harm caused on account of an accident in the carrying on of the hazardous or inherently dangerous activity by the enterprise.|$|E

5000|$|Random <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> Genealogical Kindness (RAOGK) is {{a web-based}} genealogical {{research}} co-op that functions solely by {{the services of}} volunteers. Volunteers from {{any part of the}} world may offer services to any requester, such as research of birth, marriage, and death records, public records, obituaries, and deeds. Some volunteers photograph burial sites, cemeteries and tombstones. Volunteers also offer [...] "lookup" [...] services in various history and genealogy books, such as those books owned by the volunteer or books held in libraries and historical societies. Any fees requested by the volunteers are reimbursements for actual costs involved, such as gas mileage, photocopying, record fees, or postage. However, in most cases, the services are rendered free of charge in the spirit <b>of</b> offering <b>a</b> random <b>act</b> <b>of</b> kindness to <b>a</b> <b>stranger</b> in search <b>of</b> family ties. Thus the name of the organization came into being from the nature of the services offered.|$|R
40|$|My {{investigations}} {{were made}} possible through the help and support <b>of</b> <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> individuals. Michael Lewis, Michael Trosset, and Steve Park gain my much deserved appreciation {{for their contributions}} mentioned within the text and for their time spent with me discussing problems small and large. I want here especially to thank friends not mentioned elsewhere. Lisa, Brian, Chris, and Sean helped me by reading through the thesis with me line by line, engaging in long discussions of pattern searches, plotting tedious graphs for me when I was running up on deadlines, and just being generally supportive. Their behind-the-scenes contributions kept me sane and motivated. Another individual who I have never met has earned my gratitude and respect: Danny Thorne at the University of Kentucky. I emailed {{him out of the}} blue after finding a reference on one of his old web pages to a function that had become a stumbling block to my work. He responded the following day with the answer and the explanation for the problem I was having, and I want to thank him for his <b>act</b> <b>of</b> kindness to <b>a</b> <b>stranger.</b> And Virginia Torczon, for all of your patience, wisdom an...|$|R
