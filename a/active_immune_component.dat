40|$|Many {{pathogens}} {{are able}} to manipulate the signaling pathways responsible for the generation of host immune responses. Here we examine and model a respiratory infection system in which disruption of host immune functions or of bacterial factors changes {{the dynamics of the}} infection. We synthesize the network of interactions between host <b>immune</b> <b>components</b> and two closely related bacteria in the genus Bordetellae. We incorporate existing experimental information on the timing of immune regulatory events into a discrete dynamic model, and verify the model by comparing the effects of simulated disruptions to the experimental outcome of knockout mutations. Our model indicates that the infection time course of both Bordetellae can be separated into three distinct phases based on the most <b>active</b> <b>immune</b> processes. We compare and discuss the effect of the species-specific virulence factors on disrupting the immune response during their infection of naive, antibody-treated, diseased, or convalescent hosts. Our model offers predictions regarding cytokine regulation, key <b>immune</b> <b>components,</b> and clearance of secondary infections; we experimentally validate two of these predictions. This type of modeling provides new insights into the virulence, pathogenesis, and host adaptation of disease-causing microorganisms and allows systems-level analysis that is not always possible using traditional methods...|$|R
40|$|Background: Breast milk is the {{principal}} source of nutrition during a critical period of immune programming - maternal and environmental exposures may influence breast milk composition and infant health. Objectives: To examine whether environmental and/or maternal factors influence levels of <b>immune</b> <b>active</b> <b>components</b> in colostrum and breast milk and identify associations between these factors and health outcomes. To examine if colostrum/breast milk immune composition can be grouped into specific 'lactotypes'. Methods: A prospective cohort study of mother/infant pairs in London, Moscow and Verona. Colostrum samples (days 0 - 6) and Mature Breast Milk (4 - 6 weeks) were analysed in duplicate using electrochemiluminescence, {{and the relationship between}} levels of <b>immune</b> <b>active</b> factors and maternal/environmental/infant factors was evaluated using mixed models. Lactotypes were identified using Principal Components Analysis. Results: Levels of <b>immune</b> <b>active</b> cytokines and growth factors in colostrum declined rapidly over time (r=- 0. 39 to - 0. 16; p< 0. 01). The effect of time could not be corrected using total protein or sodium as correction factors, due to different kinetics for each mediator measured. There were significant differences in colostrum and breast milk composition between countries, which could not be explained by the environmental and maternal factors examined. Using PCA there were two clusters of mediators, suggesting that four human breast milk ‘lactotypes’ exist, based on immune composition. There was some evidence in support of a relationship between human milk mediator levels and/or lactotypes, and infant health outcomes. Conclusions: The data support an important role for breast milk cytokines, and especially growth factor, levels as determinants of infant health. Further work is needed to identify improved methods for analysing colostrum and mature milk composition, which account for time of collection and/or stage of lactation. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{experiments}} where ferrets {{were exposed}} to two influenza strains {{within a short time}} have provided insight into the timing and contribution of each <b>immune</b> <b>component</b> to cross-protection. While mathematical models which capture the novel observations have been developed and analysed, they have many parameters and it is unclear whether the contributions of each <b>immune</b> <b>component</b> to cross-protection can be recovered from the data. We show using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods that within a simulation estimation framework, a model fitted to sequential infection data accurately captures the timing and extent of cross-protection, and attributes such cross-protection to the correct broad <b>immune</b> <b>components.</b> In addition, sequential infection data enables recovery of the timing and role of each <b>immune</b> <b>component</b> in controlling a primary infection. A major limitation of previous studies using single infection data is that they have produced discrepant estimates of these quantities. This evaluation demonstrates that sequential infection experiments provide richer information for quantifying the contribution of each <b>immune</b> <b>component</b> to cross-protection. This information enhances our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the control and resolution of infection, and generates new insight into how previous exposure influences the time course of a subsequent infection.

40|$|The body is {{constantly}} exposed to foreign molecules; some are harmful {{but most are}} harmless. Any molecule that interacts with the immune system (antigen) can activate it. To avoid activation {{of the immune system}} to harmless antigens, different immunologic mechanisms are employed. One such mechanism is oral tolerance, the generation of a suppressive (or tolerant) immune response to antigen initially administered to the body via the oral route. Subsequent exposure of this antigen to the body by any route will not generate an <b>active</b> <b>immune</b> response to that antigen since a tolerant response was generated initially. Mucosal tissues, particularly those of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract, are critical for housing <b>immune</b> <b>components</b> necessary for initiating and maintaining tolerance. Recent work in our lab has demonstrated an inability to induce tolerance when a feeding needle is used to administer the treatments for 14 or more consecutive days. Preliminary data suggest that cellular alterations occur in the esophageal mucosa. The goal {{of this study was to}} examine all aspects of the esophageal mucosa that might be altered by repeated feeding needle treatments and correlate any changes with a hindrance in oral tolerance induction to fed ovalbumin. To do this, we designed a pathology scoring system to account not only for changes in cellular populations but aberrant cellular growth and physical alterations such as abscesses and mucosal shredding.

This study compared {{the effect of the}} FoneAstra FH (F-FH) method with the Sterifeed Holder method currently used by human milk banks on human milk <b>immune</b> <b>components</b> (immunoglobulin A (IgA), lactoferrin activity, lysozyme activity, interleukin (IL) - 8 and IL- 10). Donor milk samples (N = 50) were obtained from a human milk bank, and pasteurized. Concentrations of IgA, IL- 8, IL- 10, lysozyme activity and lactoferrin activity were compared to their controls using the Student’s t-test. Both methods demonstrated no destruction of interleukins. While the Holder method retained all lysozyme activity, the F-FH method only retained 78. 4 % activity (p < 0. 0001), and both methods showed a decrease in lactoferrin activity (71. 1 % Holder vs. 38. 6 % F-FH; p < 0. 0001) and a decrease in the retention of total IgA (78. 9 % Holder vs. 25. 2 % F-FH; p < 0. 0001). Despite increased destruction of <b>immune</b> <b>components</b> compared to Holder pasteurization, the benefits of F-FH in terms of its low cost, feasibility, safety and retention of <b>immune</b> <b>components</b> make it a valuable resource in low-income countries for pasteurizing human milk, potentially saving infants’ lives...|$|R

They depend on females' own immunity and, {{because they are}} costly, on their physiological state. Therefore, trace metals, whether toxic and immunosuppressive (e. g., lead, cadmium, etc.) or necessary and immunostimulant (e. g., zinc, copper, iron, etc.), are likely to affect the amount of <b>immune</b> <b>components</b> transferred into the eggs. It may also vary with plumage eumelanin level, which {{is known to be}} linked to immunity, to transfer of antibodies, and to metal detoxification. In feral pigeons (Columba livia) injected with an antigen and experimentally exposed to lead and/or zinc (two highly abundant trace metals in urban areas), we measured specific antibody transfer and concentrations of two antimicrobial proteins (lysozyme and ovotransferrin) in eggs. As expected, lead had negative effects on specific antibody transfer, while zinc positively affected lysozyme egg concentrations. Moreover, eggs from lead-exposed females exhibited higher ovotransferrin concentrations; because it binds metal ions, ovotransferrin may enable egg detoxification and embryo protection. Finally, eggs' lysozyme concentrations increased with plumage darkness of females not exposed to zinc, while the relation was opposite among zinc-exposed females, suggesting that benefits and costs of plumage melanism depend on trace metal environmental levels. Overall, our study underlines the potential ecotoxicological effects of trace metals on maternal {{transfers of}} <b>immune</b> <b>components</b> and the role of plum-age melanism in modulating these effects...|$|R

This study investigated the short- and long-term effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) and an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (losartan) in thymic stromal lymphopoietin transgenic (TSLPtg) mice, which develop mixed cryoglobulinemia and severe cryoglobulinemia-associated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. Enalapril and losartan each reduced hypertension, proteinuria, glomerular extracellular matrix deposition, and mesangial cell activation in TSLPtg mice. These renoprotective effects were not observed with hydralazine treatment, despite a similar antihypertensive effect. Treatment with enalapril or losartan also decreased renal plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 in TSLPtg mice, assessed by immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase–PCR. None of the treatments affected immune complex deposition or macrophage infiltration. Overall, enalapril- and losartan-treated TSLPtg mice survived significantly longer than untreated TSLPtg mice.
