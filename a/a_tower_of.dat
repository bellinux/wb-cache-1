5|$|Cluj-Napoca is {{undergoing}} a period of architectural revitalisation that is set to bring the manner of expansion to the vertical. A financial centre, containing <b>a</b> <b>tower</b> <b>of</b> 15 storeys, is slated for completion in 2010 on Ploiești Street. Two 35-storey twin towers are projected to be constructed in the Sigma area in Zorilor, while the Florești area will host a complex of three towers with 32 levels each.|$|E
5|$|St. Seiriol {{established}} a cell {{and a community}} on Puffin Island (in Welsh, Ynys Seiriol or Seiriol's Island) {{half a mile from}} the coast {{at the same time as}} he founded the monastery. There is <b>a</b> <b>tower</b> <b>of</b> a 12th-century church on Puffin Island still. There is a tradition that St. Seiriol and perhaps Maelgwn Gwynedd (king of Gwynedd in the first half of the 6th century) were buried there. The island once had large numbers of puffins and guillemots. However, rats reduced the bird population to 40 in the 1890s.|$|E
5|$|The {{church has}} a nave with a north aisle and vestry, a Perpendicular Gothic west tower, a chancel and a south porch. The nave was rebuilt {{in the late}} 15th or early 16th century to meet <b>a</b> <b>tower</b> <b>of</b> {{approximately}} the same age; it is often dated to 1521, but appears to be built on older foundations. The southern side of the nave contains what are probably thirteenth-century buttresses {{and a pair of}} Perpendicular Gothic windows. The north aisle was originally built in the 13th century, and rebuilt by H.J. Underwood in 1890; the vestry was built in the 17th century and rebuilt in 1846 to designs by Chamberlain, through the generosity of the curate, Alexander Penrose Forbes. The church has been reroofed at least twice, in 1825 and 1897.|$|E

25|$|Divide {{and conquer}} is a {{powerful}} tool for solving conceptually difficult problems: all it requires is a way of breaking the problem into sub-problems, of solving the trivial cases and of combining sub-problems to the original problem. Similarly, divide and conquer only requires reducing the problem to a single smaller problem, such as the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle, which reduces moving <b>a</b> <b>tower</b> <b>of</b> height n to moving <b>a</b> <b>tower</b> <b>of</b> height n−1.|$|E

25|$|If z is {{an element}} of Lα, then z = {y | y ∈ Lα and y ∈ z} ∈ Def (Lα) = Lα+1. So Lα is a subset of Lα+1, which is a subset of the power set of Lα. Consequently, this is <b>a</b> <b>tower</b> <b>of</b> nested {{transitive}} sets. But L itself is a proper class.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to cremation and burial, other possible methods of disposing {{of the bodies}} of the dead have been suggested.

After losing Fornost and Barad Gularan, she moves to Annúminas, the ancient capital of Arnor. The Rangers there, led by Calenglad, need the player's aid.|$|E

25|$|In 2005, {{a team of}} {{researchers}} at Cornell University, including Hod Lipson, implemented a self-assembling machine. The machine is composed of <b>a</b> <b>tower</b> <b>of</b> four articulated cubes, known as molecubes, which can revolve about a triagonal. This enables the tower to function as a robotic arm, collecting nearby molecubes and assembling them into a copy of itself. The arm is directed by a computer program, which is contained within each molecube, analogous to how each animal cell contains an entire copy of its DNA. However, the machine cannot manufacture individual molecubes, nor do they occur naturally, so its status as a self-replicator is debatable.|$|E
25|$|In the 18th century, {{the time}} of day or night in Paris was largely {{announced}} by the church bells; in 1789 there were 66 churches, 92 chapels, 13 abbeys and 199 convents, all of which rang their bells for regular services and prayers; sometimes a little early, sometimes a little late. A clock had also been installed in <b>a</b> <b>tower</b> <b>of</b> the palace on the Île de la Cité by Charles V in about 1370, and it also sounded the hour. Wealthy and noble Parisians began to have pocket watches, and needed a way to accurately set the time, so sundials appeared around the city. The best known-sundial was in the courtyard of the Palais-Royal. In 1750, the Duke of Chartres had a cannon installed there which, following the sundial, was fired precisely at noon each day.|$|E
25|$|No {{explicit}} {{regulations are}} expressed in the bible concerning the treatment of a corpse itself, although historic rabbinical sources saw an implication that the dead should be thoroughly washed per Ecclesiastes, as children are washed when born; according to Eliezer ben Joel HaLevi, a prominent rishon, argued that the corpse should be cleansed carefully, including the ears and fingers, with nails pared and hair combed, so that the corpse could be laid {{to rest in the}} manner that the person had visited the synagogue during life. Washing of corpses was not observed among the Jews living in Persian Babylon, for which they were criticised as dying in filth, without a candle and without a bath; at the time, the non-Jewish Persians were predominantly Zoroastrian, and consequently believed that dead bodies were inherently ritually unclean, and should be exposed to the elements in <b>a</b> <b>Tower</b> <b>of</b> Silence to avoid defiling the earth with them.|$|E

25|$|In 2008 Bath {{won their}} first {{silverware}} in 10 years, beating Worcester {{to win the}} European Challenge Cup. After defeat in the 2003 and 2007 finals, it was third time lucky for the English team who ground out an impressive win over Worcester Warriors at Kingsholm. Outgoing skipper Steve Borthwick led by example and was <b>a</b> <b>tower</b> <b>of</b> strength in the lineout {{on his way to}} becoming FedEx Man of the match. Bothwick, who joins Saracens next season, was carried aloft by his jubilant teammates after a titanic tussle in appalling conditions. Worcester won the toss and opted to play with the wind at their backs in the first period. It mattered not as Bath dominated possession and territory in the first quarter, and deservedly took the lead on 15 minutes with an Olly Barkley penalty. Barkley went on to score a second penalty a drop goal and a conversion, but it was tries from Jonny Fa'amatuainu and Nick Abendanon that put the game beyond the reach of brave Worcester. Bath won 24–16.|$|E
25|$|The third {{match of}} the event was <b>a</b> <b>Tower</b> <b>of</b> Doom match pitting The Road Warriors (Hawk and Animal), Steve Williams, Jimmy Garvin and Ron Garvin against Kevin Sullivan, Mike Rotunda, Al Perez, Russian Assassin and Ivan Koloff. Two wrestlers started the match out {{on top of the}} cage for a two-minute period. After that period, a trap door in both the top-tier cages opened for fifteen seconds which allowed a locked wrestler to get down into the cage below with all the other wrestlers. The object of the match was to unlock the door and escape out to the floor. Jimmy Garvin's valet Precious held the key to the door. Ron Garvin and Ivan Koloff started the match. The match went back and forth with both teams exchanging blows. In the end of the match, Jimmy Garvin and Kevin Sullivan were in the ring. Sullivan grabbed Precious but Garvin rescued her by attacking him and {{performed}} a Brainbuster, which he called Bombs Away, on Sullivan. Sullivan eventually shoved Garvin out of the cage. As a result, Garvin's team won. However, Sullivan locked the cage door to lock himself with Precious. Hawk made the rescue by performing a Flying Clothesline on Sullivan.|$|E
25|$|Another {{secondary}} rivalry {{heading into}} the event was between Jimmy Garvin and Kevin Sullivan. On the March 27 edition of Clash of the Champions, Sullivan's Varsity Club teammate Mike Rotunda defeated Garvin in a College Rules match to retain the NWA World Television Championship. At the 3rd Annual Jim Crockett, Sr. Memorial Cup Tag Team Tournament, Garvin defeated Sullivan in a Prince of Darkness match. On June 8 edition of Clash of the Champions called Miami Mayhem, Garvin and his brother Ronnie Garvin defeated Rick Steiner and Rotunda in a tag team match. After the match, Sullivan, Steiner and Rotunda attacked the Garvins, resulting in Steve Williams making the save for Garvins. Williams became an ally of the Garvins against Sullivan and Rotunda. On the other side, The Road Warriors were scheduled to compete against The Powers of Pain {{in a series of}} Scaffold matches but Powers of Pain left the company and were replaced by Ivan Koloff and Russian Assassin. On June 11 edition of World Championship Wrestling, <b>a</b> <b>Tower</b> <b>of</b> Doom match was announced to take place between a team of Jimmy Garvin and a team of Sullivan. Road Warriors were added to Garvin's team and Koloff and Assassin were added to Sullivan's team.|$|E
