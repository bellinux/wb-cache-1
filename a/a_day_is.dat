5|$|Cobalt is {{essential}} to the metabolism of all animals. It is a key constituent of cobalamin, also known as vitamin B, the primary biological reservoir of cobalt as an ultratrace element. Bacteria in the guts of ruminant animals convert cobalt salts into vitamin B, a compound which can only be produced by bacteria or archaea. The minimum presence of cobalt in soils therefore markedly improves the health of grazing animals, and an uptake of 0.20mg/kg <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>is</b> recommended because they have no other source of vitamin B.|$|E
5|$|Low-dose aspirin use irreversibly {{blocks the}} {{formation}} of thromboxane A2 in platelets, producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation during the lifetime of the affected platelet (8–9 days).

The Axis troops begin the game on the western side of the line, whilst Allied forces begin the offensive in British Egypt. A command box in the game provides the player with an instant report of a unit or landscape once hovered over; data given on units includes their strength in terms of supply of infantry, provisions, artillery, and the number of moves that unit can make on one turn. Every two turns lasts one in-game day and units are available to enter combat phases once <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>is</b> finished.|$|E

25|$|Prevention {{of dental}} caries {{includes}} regular cleaning of the teeth, a diet low in sugar, and {{small amounts of}} fluoride. Brushing the teeth twice per day and flossing between the teeth once <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>is</b> recommended by many. Fluoride may be from water, salt or toothpaste among other sources. Treating a mother's dental caries may decrease the risk in her children by decreasing the numbers of certain bacteria. Screening can result in earlier detection.

There is no known method to grow back large amounts of tooth. The availability of treatment is often poor in the developing world. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) or ibuprofen may be taken for pain.|$|E
25|$|Greater than 75–95% of {{colorectal}} cancer occurs {{in people with}} little or no genetic risk. Risk factors include older age, male gender, high intake of fat, alcohol, red meat, processed meats, obesity, smoking, and a lack of physical exercise. Approximately 10% of cases are linked to insufficient activity. The risk from alcohol appears to increase at greater than one drink per day. Drinking 5 glasses of water <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>is</b> linked to a decrease in the risk of {{colorectal cancer}} and adenomatous polyps. Streptococcus gallolyticus is associated with colorectal cancer. Some strains of Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex are consumed by millions of people daily and thus may be safe. 25 to 80% of people with Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus bacteremia have concomitant colorectal tumors. Seroprevalence of Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus is considered as a candidate practical marker for the early prediction of an underlying bowel lesion at high risk population. It has been suggested that the presence of antibodies to Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus antigens or the antigens themselves in the bloodstream may act as markers for the carcinogenesis in the colon.|$|E
25|$|The {{benefits}} versus {{risks of}} placing a nasogastric tube {{in those with}} upper GI bleeding are not determined. Endoscopy within 24hours is recommended, in addition to medical management. A number of endoscopic treatments may be used, including: epinephrine injection, band ligation, sclerotherapy, and fibrin glue depending on what is found. Prokinetic agents such as erythromycin before endocopy can decrease the amount {{of blood in the}} stomach and thus improve the operators view. They also decrease the amount of blood transfusions required. Early endoscopy decreases hospital and the amount of blood transfusions needed. A second endoscopy within <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>is</b> routinely recommended by some but by others only in specific situations. Proton pump inhibitors, if they have not been started earlier, are recommended in those in whom high risk signs for bleeding are found. High and low dose PPIs appear equivalent at this point. It is also recommended that people with high risk signs are kept in hospital for at least 72hours. Those at low risk of re-bleeding may begin eating typically 24 hours following endoscopy. If other measures fail or are not available, esophageal balloon tamponade may be attempted. While there is a success rate up to 90%, there are some potentially significant complications including aspiration and esophageal perforation.|$|E

500|$|Ainsworth's tale of Turpin's {{overnight}} {{journey from}} London to York on his mare Black Bess has {{its origins in}} an episode recorded by Daniel Defoe, in his 1727 work A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain. [...] After committing a robbery in Kent in 1676, William Nevison apparently rode to York to establish an alibi, and Defoe's account of that journey became part of folk legend. [...] A similar ride was attributed to Turpin as early as 1808, and was being performed on stage by 1819, but the feat as imagined by Ainsworth (about 200miles in less than <b>a</b> <b>day)</b> <b>is</b> impossible. [...] Nevertheless, Ainsworth's legend of Black Bess was repeated in works such as Black Bess or the Knight of the Road, a 254-part penny dreadful published in 1867–68. [...] In these tales, Turpin was the hero, accompanied by his trusty colleagues Claude Duval, Tom King, and Jack Rann. [...] These narratives, which transformed Turpin from a pockmarked thug and murderer into [...] "a gentleman of the road [...] a protector of the weak", followed a popular cultural tradition of romanticising English criminals. [...] This practice {{is reflected in the}} ballads written about Turpin, the earliest of which, Dick Turpin, would appear to have been published in 1737. [...] Later ballads presented Turpin as an 18th-century Robin Hood figure: [...] "Turpin was caught and his trial was passed, and for a game cock he died at last. [...] Five hundred pounds he gave so free, all to Jack Ketch as a small legacy." ...|$|E
