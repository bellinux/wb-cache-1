500|$|The {{historical}} novel Wounds of Armenia (written in 1841, {{first published in}} 1858) was the first Armenian secular novel dedicated {{to the fate of}} the Armenian people and its struggle for liberation in the period of Russo-Persian war of 1826–1828. The novel dealt with the suffering of Armenians under Persian occupation. The basic concept of the novel was the assertion of feelings of national merit, patriotism and hatred of oppressors. These themes had a profound influence over wide layers of Armenian society. The hero, Agassi, personifies the freedom-loving national spirit and its will to fight against the foreign conquerors. [...] "Give <b>away</b> <b>your</b> life, but never give <b>away</b> <b>your</b> native lands", is his motto. The story begins with an abduction of an Armenian girl by a band of thugs sent by the Persian sardar that triggers an uprising led by Agassi.|$|E

It was released by Columbia Records on June 6, 2000, written by Carey and Diane Warren, and produced by Carey and Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis for Carey's seventh studio album Rainbow (1999). It was released as the album's third single and a double A-side with [...] "Crybaby". The song is a ballad, blending pop and R beats while incorporating its sound from several instruments including the violin, piano and organ. Lyrically, the song speaks of inner strength, and not allowing others to tear <b>away</b> <b>your</b> dreams.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} surviving {{version of}} the legend is a Dutch print about an Amsterdam woman named Jacamijntjen Jacobs. In 1621 Jacobs, while pregnant, was approached one day by a female beggar accompanied by three children, who pleaded that her children were starving. Jacobs told the beggar [...] "Take <b>away</b> <b>your</b> filthy pigs, I will not give you anything". The woman replied [...] "Are these my children pigs? May God then give you such pigs as I have here!" [...] Jacobs' daughter was born with the head and face of a pig, {{and at the time}} of publication in 1638–39 the daughter, by then in her teens, supposedly ate from a trough and spoke in a grunting voice.|$|E

500|$|In {{his late}} teens and early twenties, Murphy worked towards {{a career as}} a rock musician, playing guitar in several bands {{alongside}} his brother Páidi. The Beatles-obsessed pair named their most successful band [...] "The Sons of Mr. Greengenes", after a 1969 song by another idol, Frank Zappa. Murphy sang and played guitar in the band, which he has said [...] "specialised in wacky lyrics and endless guitar solos". In 1996, The Sons of Mr. Greengenes were offered a five-album record deal by Acid Jazz Records, but they did not sign the contract due to Murphy's brother still being in secondary school and the little money involved in ceding the rights to Murphy's compositions to the record label. Murphy confessed that [...] "I'm very glad in retrospect that we didn't sign because you kind of sign <b>away</b> <b>your</b> life to a label and the whole of your music".|$|E
500|$|Spears' {{cover of}} [...] "My Prerogative" [...] is musically {{different}} {{from its original}} version, with the bass and new jack swing sound replaced with a synthpop sound, synthesizers and elements typical of Bloodshy & Avant productions. It was noted by Christy Lemire of msnbc.com that the cover also contains elements of Bollywood music. At {{the beginning of the}} song, Spears says in a breathy voice the lines [...] "People can take everything away from you / But they can never take <b>away</b> <b>your</b> truth / But the question is, can you handle mine?". The rest of the lyrics do not deviate much from the original version, instead they are changed to fit a woman's perspective. Jennifer Vineyard of MTV commented the cover could be interpreted as a statement on Spears's life and the media reaction to some of her decisions at the time, including her engagement to American dancer Kevin Federline.|$|E

500|$|In August 2014, {{unreleased}} tracks {{from the}} album's recording sessions were {{leaked to the}} internet. Many of the album's released songs and outtakes are in their earliest forms and feature improvised lyrics by Kiedis. The leak included three songs never heard before including [...] "Goldmine," [...] "Fall Water" [...] and [...] "Rock & Roll" [...] along with the original version of [...] "Fortune Faded." [...] Many of the songs are featured under their working titles (which prior to release were also mentioned in various interviews): Soul Train ("By the Way"), Coltraine ("The Zephyr Song"), I Would Die ("I Could Die For You"), Drone ("This is the Place"), Throw Away ("Throw <b>Away</b> <b>Your</b> Television"), Epic ("Venice Queen") and New Wave ("Rivers of Avalon)" [...] To date, [...] "Strumming on [...] D and J", a song assumed to be an instrumental jam and that Frusciante mentioned during pre-album release interviews, has never been released.|$|E
500|$|By the Way diverged {{from the}} band's {{previous}} styles, containing few funk-driven songs. [...] "Can't Stop" [...] {{and the title}} track were the only songs which revisited the Chili Peppers' once trademark style of short, rapped verses. [...] "Throw <b>Away</b> <b>Your</b> Television," [...] while not having any rapidly sung lyrics, also contained a funk-oriented bass line, though hinted at experimental rock due to the heavy use of distortion throughout the verse and chorus. Other [...] "experimental" [...] tracks include the melodica-based [...] "On Mercury." [...] "Cabron," [...] the only track to be played entirely on acoustic guitar, has distinctive Latin influences. [...] "Tear" [...] and [...] "Warm Tape" [...] were keyboard based more so than guitar or bass, the latter being completely written on the instrument. Technically, By the Way saw the Chili Peppers employing several devices to distort and alter guitar and vocal sequences. [...] "Don't Forget Me" [...] utilizes a mellotron, wah pedal, and echoing techniques to convey an emotive atmosphere, while Frusciante uses a Big Muff for the solos on [...] "Minor Thing." ...|$|E
500|$|During the 1890s, Elgar {{gradually}} {{built up}} {{a reputation as a}} composer, chiefly of works for the great choral festivals of the English Midlands. The Black Knight (1892) and King Olaf (1896), both inspired by Longfellow, The Light of Life (1896) and Caractacus (1898) were all modestly successful, and he obtained a long-standing publisher in Novello and Co. Other works of this decade included the Serenade for Strings (1892) and Three Bavarian Dances (1897). Elgar was of enough consequence locally to recommend the young composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor to the Three Choirs Festival for a concert piece, which helped establish the younger man's career. Elgar was catching the attention of prominent critics, but their reviews were polite rather than enthusiastic. Although he was in demand as a festival composer, he was only just getting by financially and felt unappreciated. In 1898, he said he was [...] "very sick at heart over music" [...] and hoped {{to find a way to}} succeed with a larger work. His friend August Jaeger tried to lift his spirits: [...] "A day's attack of the blues ... will not drive <b>away</b> <b>your</b> desire, your necessity, which is to exercise those creative faculties which a kind providence has given you. Your time of universal recognition will come." ...|$|E

500|$|The rumour {{was that}} Griselda Steevens' reclusiveness and always being veiled were owing to her having {{been born with}} a pig's head. Chambers (1864) speculates that her unusual name {{may have contributed to}} the legend, and notes the common belief that she was named [...] "Grisly" [...] on account of her {{appearance}} when born. It was claimed that while pregnant with Richard and Griselda, Steevens' mother had said [...] "take <b>away</b> <b>your</b> litter of pigs!" [...] to a woman beggar asking for money to feed her children, and Griselda had then been born with the head and face of a pig. Dismayed by the popular belief that she had a pig's head, Griselda took to sitting on an open balcony to allow the public to see her face. This failed to stem the spread of the rumour, and she commissioned a portrait of herself to be hung in the main hall of the hospital. The portrait failed to have the desired effect; many of the public chose instead to believe a portrait in a pub neighbouring the hospital, which showed Steevens with a pig's head; the pub also displayed a silver trough alleged to have belonged to her. She eventually withdrew from public view completely before her death on 18 March 1746.|$|E
500|$|On 8 February, ZANLA cadres at Connemara Barracks in Gwelo {{surprised}} their ZIPRA counterparts, killed over 60 of {{them and}} forced the rest to flee into the bush. When the ZIPRA portion of the 13th Infantry Battalion, based at Glenville Camp near Entumbane, learned of this later in the day, it waited until its instructors from the British Army left in the evening, then attacked its ZANLA comrades, killing 12 {{of them and}} scattering the rest. Charged with restoring order, McKenna sent Devine's armoured cars and D Company, 1RAR, commanded by the American Lieutenant Dave Hill, to Glenville. Arriving late in the evening, the Elands drove into the camp and flattened the ZIPRA tents, killing many of the occupants and {{clearing the way for}} Hill's troops. Taken totally by surprise, the ZIPRA troops put up little resistance; 40 were killed and many more captured, including two officers, Captains Mpofu and Dlamini. On the morning of 9 February, the British instructors were bewildered to find the ZANLA half of their unit gone, and the remaining ZIPRA men squatting in rows in 1RAR captivity. [...] "What happened?" [...] asked the British sergeant. [...] "I am afraid that while you were <b>away,</b> <b>your</b> battalion fell apart," [...] replied McKenna.|$|E
500|$|The Supreme Court {{upheld the}} {{constitutionality}} of Sections 4 and 5 in South Carolina v. Katzenbach (1966). However, in Shelby County v. Holder (2013), the Supreme Court ruled that Section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act, which established the coverage formula that determined which jurisdictions were subject to preclearance, was no longer constitutional and exceeded Congress's enforcement authority under Section 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment. The Court declared that the Fifteenth Amendment [...] "commands {{that the right to}} vote shall not be denied or abridged on account of race or color, and it gives Congress the power to enforce that command. The Amendment is not designed to punish for the past; its purpose is to ensure a better future." [...] According to the Court, [...] "Regardless of how to look at the record no one can fairly say that it shows anything approaching the 'pervasive,' 'flagrant,' 'widespread,' and 'rampant' discrimination that faced Congress in 1965, and that clearly distinguished the covered jurisdictions {{from the rest of the}} nation." [...] In dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote, [...] "Throwing out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing <b>away</b> <b>your</b> umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet." [...] While the preclearance provision itself was not struck down, it will continue to be inoperable unless Congress passes a new coverage formula.|$|E

500|$|Dubbed an [...] "iconoclast" [...] by Boxoffice, Belle {{continues}} to garner media recognition {{for her role}} in Beauty and the Beast. Established as a cultural icon, the character maintains the distinction of being Disney's first feminist princess. Commentators believe that the character's role in Beauty and the Beast as one of Disney's first strong female characters is responsible for changing the way in which women would be depicted in subsequent animated films. According to Kevin Fallon of The Daily Beast, [...] "being a Disney princess meant singing songs about how much you love combing your hair with a fork and giving <b>away</b> <b>your</b> voice if it meant you got to marry the guy with that dreamy chiseled jaw" [...] prior to Belle's arrival. The Los Angeles Times Charles Solomon ranked Belle among the four Disney Princesses responsible for breaking [...] "the bonds of convention." [...] About.com's David Nusair agreed that Belle successfully [...] "updated the princess formula for an entirely new generation." [...] The Atlantics Lindsay Lowe echoed Nusair's sentiment, citing Belle as the character responsible for ending Disney's [...] "history of ... docile heroines." [...] The Daily Campus Cathy Schmidt recognized Belle and Ariel as [...] "the beginnings of the more modern Disney princesses." [...] Writing for Virgin Media, Limara Salt believes that the character [...] "proved that audiences could {{fall in love with a}} brown-haired intellectual." [...] A survey conducted by Disney after the film's release determined that Belle's love of books inspired young women to read. Justin Humphreys of The Hook expressed, [...] "Belle remains a most successful princess because people can relate" [...] to her. Elina Bolokhova of Parenting believes that Belle's [...] "bravery and independence helped redefine the meaning of a Disney princess." [...] According to Justine McGrath of Teen Vogue, Belle has [...] "become one of the most popular classic Disney princesses of all time." [...] Commending her intelligence and lack of vanity, the character was placed at number one on E!'s ranking of the Disney Princesses, while Cosmopolitan ranked her fourth. In the magazine's [...] "Definitive Ranking Of Disney Princesses", Seventeen ranked Belle fifth. Similarly, BuzzFeed also ranked the character fifth, praising her love of reading. A reader poll conducted by BuzzFeed also determined that Belle is the most popular Disney Princess, having garnered 18% of votes. Belle is the fifth most successful Disney Princess in terms of box office revenue, with Beauty and the Beast having grossed over $350 million. However, Belle was the lowest-selling Disney Princess on eBay in 2013, with sales of less than $7,000 despite the fact that she is often cited as a customer favorite.|$|E
