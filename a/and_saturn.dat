5|$|Gas giants, Jupiter <b>and</b> <b>Saturn,</b> are giant planets {{primarily}} {{composed of}} {{hydrogen and helium}} and are the most massive planets in the Solar System. Jupiter, at 318 Earth masses, is the largest planet in the Solar System, <b>and</b> <b>Saturn</b> is one third as massive, at 95 Earth masses.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Anlezark has {{tentatively}} {{suggested that}} Dunstan {{may be the}} medieval author of Solomon <b>and</b> <b>Saturn</b> citing the style, word choice, and Hiberno-Latin used in the texts. However, Clive Tolley examines this claim from a linguistic point-of-view and disagrees with Anlezark's claim.|$|E
5|$|In 1500, Nilakantha Somayaji of the Kerala {{school of}} {{astronomy}} and mathematics, in his Tantrasangraha, revised Aryabhata's model. In his Aryabhatiyabhasya, {{a commentary on}} Aryabhata's Aryabhatiya, he developed a planetary model where Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter <b>and</b> <b>Saturn</b> orbit the Sun, which in turn orbits Earth, similar to the Tychonic system later proposed by Tycho Brahe in the late 16th century. Most astronomers of the Kerala school who followed him accepted his planetary model.|$|E

25|$|The fourth {{match was}} between Ernest Miller (accompanied by Sonny Onoo) <b>and</b> Perry <b>Saturn.</b> The match started back <b>and</b> forth. <b>Saturn</b> had the early {{advantage}} until Miller performed an eye rake, <b>and</b> choked <b>Saturn.</b> Miller performed a superkick, but Saturn fought back with suplexes. After Saturn missed an axe handle, Miller fought back with kicks, <b>and</b> held <b>Saturn</b> for Onoo to attack him. Onoo accidentally kicked Miller, and Miller kicked Onoo. Saturn then pinned Miller after a Death Valley driver {{to win the}} match.|$|R

5|$|In 1614, German {{astronomer}} Johannes Kepler {{determined that}} {{a series of three}} conjunctions of the planets Jupiter <b>and</b> <b>Saturn</b> occurred in the year 7 BC. He argued (incorrectly) that a planetary conjunction could create a nova, which he linked to the Star of Bethlehem. Modern calculations show that there was a gap of nearly a degree (approximately twice a diameter of the moon) between the planets, so these conjunctions were not visually impressive. An ancient almanac has been found in Babylon which covers the events of this period, but does not indicate that the conjunctions were of any special interest. In the 20th century, Prof. Karlis Kaufmanis, an astronomer, argued that this was an astronomical event where Jupiter <b>and</b> <b>Saturn</b> were in a triple conjunction in the constellation Pisces. Archaeologist and Assyriologist Simo Parpola has also suggested this explanation.|$|E
5|$|In {{a revised}} version of the Nice model Jupiter trojans are {{captured}} when Jupiter encounters an ice giant during the instability. In {{this version of the}} Nice model one of the ice giants (Uranus, Neptune, or a lost fifth planet) is scattered inward onto a Jupiter-crossing orbit and is scattered outward by Jupiter causing the orbits of Jupiter <b>and</b> <b>Saturn</b> to quickly separate. When Jupiter's semi-major axis jumps during these encounters existing Jupiter trojans can escape and new objects with semi-major axes similar to Jupiter's new semi-major axis are captured. Following its last encounter the ice giant can pass through one of the libration points and perturb their orbits leaving this libration point depleted relative to the other. After the encounters end some of these Jupiter trojans are lost and others captured when Jupiter <b>and</b> <b>Saturn</b> are near weak mean motion resonances such as the 3:7 resonance via the mechanism of the original Nice model.|$|E
5|$|Manned Apollo {{flights were}} {{suspended}} for 20 months while the Command Module's hazards were addressed. However, {{the development and}} unmanned testing of the Lunar Module (LM) <b>and</b> <b>Saturn</b> V Moon rocket continued. The Saturn IB launch vehicle for Apollo 1, AS-204, {{was used for the}} first LM test flight, Apollo 5. The first successful manned Apollo mission was flown by Apollo 1's backup crew on Apollo 7 in October 1968.|$|E

5|$|NASA's ongoing {{investigations}} include in-depth surveys of Mars (Mars 2020 and InSight) <b>and</b> <b>Saturn</b> and {{studies of the}} Earth and the Sun. Other active spacecraft missions are Juno for Jupiter, New Horizons (for Jupiter, Pluto, and beyond), and Dawn for the asteroid belt. NASA continued to support in situ exploration beyond the asteroid belt, including Pioneer and Voyager traverses into the unexplored trans-Pluto region, and Gas Giant orbiters Galileo (1989–2003), Cassini(1997–2017), and Juno (2011–).|$|E
5|$|Saturn is a gas giant {{because it}} is {{predominantly}} composed of hydrogen and helium. It lacks a definite surface, though it may have a solid core. Saturn's rotation causes it to have {{the shape of an}} oblate spheroid; that is, it is flattened at the poles and bulges at its equator. Its equatorial and polar radii differ by almost 10%: 60,268km versus 54,364km. Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune, the other giant planets in the Solar System, are also oblate but to a lesser extent. Saturn is the only planet of the Solar System that is less dense than water—about 30% less. Although Saturn's core is considerably denser than water, the average specific density of the planet is 0.69g/cm3 due to the atmosphere. Jupiter has 318 times the Earth's mass, <b>and</b> <b>Saturn</b> is 95 times the mass of the Earth. Together, Jupiter <b>and</b> <b>Saturn</b> hold 92% of the total planetary mass in the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|The Sun {{has eight}} known planets. This {{includes}} four terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars), two gas giants (Jupiter <b>and</b> <b>Saturn),</b> and two ice giants (Uranus and Neptune). The Solar System also {{has at least}} five dwarf planets, an asteroid belt, numerous comets, {{and a large number}} of icy bodies which lie beyond the orbit of Neptune.|$|E

5|$|The Voyager 1 probe was {{launched}} on September 5, 1977, from Launch Complex 41 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, aboard a Titan IIIE launch vehicle. The Voyager 2 probe had been launched two weeks earlier, on August 20, 1977.

5|$|The inner Solar System is {{the region}} {{comprising}} the terrestrial planets and the asteroid belt. Composed mainly of silicates and metals, {{the objects of}} the inner Solar System are relatively close to the Sun; the radius of this entire region {{is less than the}} distance between the orbits of Jupiter <b>and</b> <b>Saturn.</b> This region is also within the frost line, which is a little less than 5 AU (about 700 million km) from the Sun.|$|E

5|$|According to the Nice model, {{after the}} {{formation}} of the Solar System, the orbits of all the giant planets continued to change slowly, influenced by their interaction with the large number of remaining planetesimals. After 500–600million years (about 4billion years ago) Jupiter <b>and</b> <b>Saturn</b> fell into a 2:1 resonance: Saturn orbited the Sun once for every two Jupiter orbits. This resonance created a gravitational push against the outer planets, possibly causing Neptune to surge past Uranus and plough into the ancient Kuiper belt.|$|E
