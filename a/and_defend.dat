5|$|Antbirds are monogamous, mate for life, <b>and</b> <b>defend</b> territories. They usually lay two {{eggs in a}} nest that {{is either}} {{suspended}} from branches or supported on a branch, stump, or mound on the ground. Both parents share the tasks of incubation and of brooding and feeding the nestlings. After fledging, each parent cares exclusively for one chick.|$|E
5|$|British {{imperial}} {{strength was}} underpinned by the steamship and the telegraph, new technologies invented {{in the second}} half of the 19th century, allowing it to control <b>and</b> <b>defend</b> the empire. By 1902, the British Empire was linked together by a network of telegraph cables, called the All Red Line.|$|E
5|$|Lek {{systems are}} known to exist among some populations of walruses. These males cluster around females and try to attract them with {{elaborate}} courtship displays and vocalizations. Lekking may also exist among California sea lions, South American fur seals, New Zealand sea lions and harbor seals. In some species, including elephant seals and grey seals, males will try to lay claim to the desired females <b>and</b> <b>defend</b> them from rivals. Elephant seal males establish dominance hierarchies with the highest ranking males—the alpha males—maintaining harems {{of as many as}} 30–100 females. These males commonly disrupt the copulations of their subordinates while they themselves can mount without inference. They will, however, break off mating to chase off a rival. Grey seal males usually claim a location among a cluster of females whose members may change over time. Male harp seals, crabeater seals and hooded seals follow <b>and</b> <b>defend</b> lactating females in their vicinity—usually one or two at a time,—and wait for them to reach estrus.|$|E

The new imperial possessions in Apulia were added to it in the 870s, before they were made into a separate thema (that of Longobardia) in about 910.|$|E
5|$|The {{offensive}} was to {{be conducted}} by Leningrad Front's 67th Army and Volkhov Front's 2nd Shock Army commanded by Major General M.P. Dukhanov and Lieutenant General V.Z. Romanovsky respectively. The 8th Army, commanded by Lieutenant General F.N. Starikov, was to conduct a limited offensive on the 2nd Shock Army's flank <b>and</b> <b>defend</b> elsewhere. 13th and 14th Air Armies provided air support.|$|E
5|$|The player {{constructs}} {{and manages}} a dungeon, recruiting and catering for minions {{to run it}} <b>and</b> <b>defend</b> it from enemy invaders. The primary method of control is the hand, used to pick up creatures and objects in the dungeon, carry them around, and drop them. The hand allows the player to 'slap' creatures and objects, and interact with them. Dungeon Keeper gameplay exemplifies a dark sense of humour.|$|E

5|$|Although {{weakened}} {{and pushed}} south beyond the Huai River, the Southern Song found {{new ways to}} bolster its strong economy <b>and</b> <b>defend</b> itself against the Jin dynasty. It had able military officers such as Yue Fei and Han Shizhong. The government sponsored massive shipbuilding and harbor improvement projects, {{and the construction of}} beacons and seaport warehouses to support maritime trade abroad, including at the major international seaports, such as Quanzhou, Guangzhou, and Xiamen, that were sustaining China's commerce.|$|E
5|$|Antbirds are diurnal: they feed, breed <b>and</b> <b>defend</b> territories {{during the}} day. Many {{of the family}} are, however, {{reluctant}} to enter areas of direct sunlight where it breaks through the forest canopy. Antbirds will engage in anting, a behaviour in which ants (or other arthropods) are rubbed on the feathers before being discarded or eaten. While this has conventionally been considered a way to remove and control feather parasites, {{it has been suggested}} that for antbirds it may simply be a way to deal with the distasteful substances in prey items.|$|E

5|$|Ants attack <b>and</b> <b>defend</b> {{themselves}} by biting and, in many species, by stinging, often injecting or spraying chemicals, such as formic acid {{in the case}} of formicine ants, alkaloids and piperidines in fire ants, and a variety of protein components in other ants. Bullet ants (Paraponera), located in Central and South America, are considered to have the most painful sting of any insect, although it is usually not fatal to humans. This sting is given the highest rating on the Schmidt Sting Pain Index.|$|E
5|$|Ants have colonised {{almost every}} landmass on Earth. The only places lacking {{indigenous}} ants are Antarctica {{and a few}} remote or inhospitable islands. Ants thrive in most ecosystems and may form 15–25% of the terrestrial animal biomass. Their success in so many environments {{has been attributed to}} their social organisation and their ability to modify habitats, tap resources, <b>and</b> <b>defend</b> themselves. Their long co-evolution with other species has led to mimetic, commensal, parasitic, and mutualistic relationships.|$|E
5|$|As Hand of the King, Tyrion {{attempts}} to control his cruel and incompetent nephew Joffrey, <b>and</b> <b>defend</b> Kings Landing from Stannis Baratheon, the rival claimant to the Iron Throne. Tyrion destroys much of Stannis' attacking fleet with wildfire, but is almost assassinated during the battle, presumably at Joffrey's or Cersei's command. Tyrion recovers to find himself stripped of power by his returned father, and without recognition for his heroics. Shae implores Tyrion to move to Pentos with her, but he opts to remain in Kings Landing.|$|E

5|$|Chavrusa {{learning}} {{tends to}} be loud and animated, as the study partners read the Talmudic text and the commentaries aloud {{to each other and}} then analyze, question, debate, <b>and</b> <b>defend</b> their points of view to arrive at a mutual understanding of the text. In the heat of discussion, they may wave their hands or even shout at each other. Depending {{on the size of the}} yeshiva, dozens or even hundreds of chavrusas can be heard discussing and debating each other's opinions. One of the skills of chavrusa learning is the ability to block out all other discussions in the study hall and focus on one's study partner alone.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth was {{regarded}} by her contemporaries as an efficient but ruthless politician who used political intrigues to protect <b>and</b> <b>defend</b> her daughters' rights. She was a caring parent, but was neither politically talented nor competent to prepare Mary and Hedwig for {{their roles as}} monarchs. Elizabeth failed to {{set a good example}} for her daughters, and her unbalanced character and questionable methods in politics would serve more as a warning to the young sovereigns. Her procrastinations and inability to make clear decisions threatened Hedwig's status, while her endless problems with Croatian nobles and failure to improve relations with her native Bosnia made Mary's reign insecure and tumultuous.|$|E
5|$|Every three months, the Trylon Cinema {{publishes a}} full {{schedule}} of screenings, approximately 10 {{percent of which}} are of first run films. The venue features a variety of regular exhibitions, ranging from the Trash Film Debauchery series of B movies, to the Defenders in which local cinephiles curate <b>and</b> <b>defend</b> screenings of personal favorite cult films, to Sound Unseen, a documentary project covering behind-the-scenes aspects of musicians' creative processes. The Trylon also hosts showcases of the films throughout various directors' careers. Take-Up Productions continues to use other venues such as the Heights and the Riverview for screenings necessitating larger houses. The Cinema is staffed almost entirely with volunteers.|$|E

5|$|Frog Fractions is a 2012 browser game {{developed}} by Twinbeard Studios, a company composed primarily of founder Jim Crawford. The game, released on October 25, 2012, {{has been described}} as a spoof of the edutainment game genre. In the game, the player begins by controlling a frog to eat bugs <b>and</b> <b>defend</b> fruit. Later on, the player may spend points on upgrades to improve their frog's abilities. The game does not actually teach the player about fractions; the player's score is given in fractions, but no knowledge of them is necessary to play.|$|E
5|$|Horses are prey {{animals with}} a strong fight-or-flight response. Their first {{reaction}} to threat is to startle and usually flee, although they will stand their ground <b>and</b> <b>defend</b> themselves when flight is impossible or if their young are threatened. They {{also tend to be}} curious; when startled, they will often hesitate an instant to ascertain the cause of their fright, and may not always flee from something that they perceive as non-threatening. Most light horse riding breeds were developed for speed, agility, alertness and endurance; natural qualities that extend from their wild ancestors. However, through selective breeding, some breeds of horses are quite docile, particularly certain draft horses.|$|E
