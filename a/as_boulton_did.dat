25|$|Despite his {{pioneering}} work with gas Murdoch {{never made any}} money from this invention due to his failure to obtain a patent. This may have been partly {{a result of the}} advice of James Watt, Junior, that the discovery was not patentable, and partly a result of the commercial failure of his earlier patent of 1791 for an early form of aniline dye. This failure to apply for a patent, despite the commercial participation of Boulton and Watt in this field, left the fledgling industry of gas production and lighting open for exploitation by other commercial interests, such as his former assistant Samuel Clegg and Frederick Albert Winsor. In large part this was due to the failure of Boulton and Watt to make sufficient effort to expand from the factory and mill lighting market which they dominated by 1809 into the street and domestic lighting market. This reason for this lassitude is unknown but can be attributed to lack of interest, a failure to appreciate the size of the potential market, and a lack of desire to be involved in smaller, less prestigious projects. By May 1809 Boulton and Watt faced little competition in any gas market due to their success in lobbying Parliament to block the granting of a charter for the National Heat and Light Company, their only real competitor in this field. However, despite blocking the charter until 1812 this advantage was squandered <b>as</b> <b>Boulton</b> and Watt <b>did</b> not develop the gas market, or technology, and in 1814 abandoned the gas business. A few decades later most towns in Britain were lit by gas and most had their own gasworks.|$|R

50|$|Boulton had {{commenced}} subdividing {{the land}} by 1864, {{and established a}} row of terrace cottages on the Mort Estate which {{came to be known}} <b>as</b> <b>Boulton</b> Terrace. Boulton took out a mortgage on the land in 1866, increasing his borrowing the following year. Boulton was declared insolvent later in 1867, and the property taken over by the Bank of New South Wales.|$|R
25|$|Besides Boulton's {{invention}} {{of a primary}} flight control, the aileron, the family name may also {{be associated with the}} well known British firm that provided wartime aircraft production <b>as</b> <b>Boulton</b> Paul Aircraft. Boulton Paul Aircraft Ltd was a British aircraft manufacturer that was created in 1934, although its start in aircraft manufacturing began earlier in 1914, and lasted until 1961. The company mainly built and modified aircraft under contract to other manufacturers, but had a few notable designs of its own, such <b>as</b> the <b>Boulton</b> Paul Defiant.|$|R

25|$|Among the {{products}} Matthew Boulton seeks {{to make in}} his new facility are sterling silver plate for those able to afford it, and Sheffield plate, silver-plated copper, for those less well off. Boulton and his father make small silver items throughout the 18th century, {{and there is no}} record of large items in either silver or Sheffield plate being made in Birmingham before <b>Boulton</b> <b>does</b> so. To make items such as candlesticks more cheaply than the London competition, the firm makes many items out of thin, die-stamped sections, which are shaped and joined together.|$|R
50|$|Early {{research}} on the steam engine before 1700 was {{closely linked to the}} quest for self-propelled vehicles and ships; the first practical applications from 1712 were stationary plant working at very low pressure which entailed engines of very large dimensions. The size reduction necessary for road transport meant an increase in steam pressure with all the attendant dangers, due to the inadequate boiler technology of the period. A strong opponent of high pressure steam was James Watt who, along with Matthew <b>Boulton</b> <b>did</b> all he could to dissuade William Murdoch from developing and patenting his steam carriage, built in model form in 1784.|$|R

5|$|In short, had Mr. <b>Boulton</b> <b>done</b> {{nothing more}} {{in the world than}} he has {{accomplished}} in improving the coinage, his name would deserve to be immortalised; and if it be considered that this was done in the midst of various other important avocations, and at enormous expense,— for which, at the time, he could have had no certainty of an adequate return,—we shall be at a loss whether most to admire his ingenuity, his perseverance, or his munificence. He has conducted the whole more like a sovereign than a private manufacturer; and the love of fame has always been to him a greater stimulus than the love of gain. Yet it is to be hoped that, even in the latter point of view, the enterprise answered its purpose.|$|R

5000|$|As {{almost a}} 1930s [...] "updated" [...] {{adaptation}} of the earlier Bristol F.2's concept, the UK introduced {{the concept of the}} [...] "turret fighter", with aeroplanes such <b>as</b> the <b>Boulton</b> Paul Defiant and Blackburn Roc where the armament (four 0.303 inch) machineguns was in a turret mounted behind the pilot, rather than in fixed positions in the wings.|$|R
5000|$|Its {{participants}} such <b>as</b> <b>Boulton,</b> Susanna Wright, Watt and Keir {{were fully}} {{integrated into the}} exchange of scientific and philosophical ideas among the intellectual elites of Europe, the British American colonies and the new United States, but were simultaneously engaged in solving the practical problems of technology, economics and manufacture. They thus formed a natural bridge across the science-technology divide, where the [...] "abstract knowledge" [...] of chemistry and Newtonian mechanics could become the [...] "useful knowledge" [...] of technological development, the results of which could in turn feed back into the wider scientific knowledge-base, creating a [...] "chain-reaction of innovation". [...] Susanna Wright was involved in analogous thinking in the biological sciences and law in the American colonies and early United States, particularly in the Mid-Atlantic, north of the Mason-Dixon line; {{she was born in}} 1697 in Warrington in Lancashire and moved to colonial Pennsylvania in her late teens in 1718 (following her parents four years earlier) after being educated in the Midlands.|$|R

5000|$|The United States {{considered}} powerfully armed destroyers, {{like the}} Bell YFM-1 Airacuda prototype, to counter a potential attack of high-performance bombers. The Lockheed P-38 Lightning and Bell P-39 Airacobra were also designed {{with the aim}} of mounting very heavy armament, including 37 mm guns, in the anti-bomber role. Great Britain, by contrast, favored specialized [...] "turret fighters", such <b>as</b> the <b>Boulton</b> Paul Defiant, which mounted heavy armament in a rotating turret.|$|R

The silver toys long made by the family firm are generally too light to require assaying, but silver plate has to be sent over 70 miles (110 km) to the nearest assay office, at Chester, to be assayed and hallmarked, with the attendant risks of damage and loss. Alternatively they can be sent to London, but this exposes them to the risk of being copied by competitors.Boulton writes in 1771, [...] "I am very desirous of becoming a great silversmith, yet I am determined not to take up that branch in the large way I intended, unless powers can be obtained to have a marking hall office at Birmingham." ...|$|R
