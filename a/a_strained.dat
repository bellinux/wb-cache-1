5|$|Though {{generally}} healthy {{throughout her}} life, in 2003 she had keyhole surgery on both knees. In October 2006, {{she missed the}} opening of the new Emirates Stadium because of <b>a</b> <b>strained</b> back muscle that had been troubling her since the summer.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{missed an}} {{exhibition}} game due to a knee injury. He was criticized for missing a practice in October 2013 due to oversleeping. He mainly played backup power forward during the season. Allen missed four games in January 2014 due to <b>a</b> <b>strained</b> right calf. In 51 games, Allen posted averages of 5.2 points and 5.4 rebounds per game.|$|E
40|$|Candidate live-virus {{vaccines}} for {{respiratory syncytial virus}} {{are being}} developed and are beginning to be evaluated in clinical trials. To distinguish candidate vaccine strains from wild-type strains isolated during these trials, we developed PCR assays specific to two sets of candidate vaccine strains. The two sets were <b>a</b> group <b>A</b> <b>strain</b> (3 <b>A),</b> its three attenuated, temperature-sensitive variant <b>strains,</b> <b>a</b> group B <b>strain</b> (2 B), and its four attenuated, temperature-sensitive variant strains. The PCR assays were evaluated by testing 18 group <b>A</b> wild-type <b>strains,</b> the 3 <b>A</b> <b>strains,</b> 9 group B wild-type strains, and the 2 B strains. PCR specific to group <b>A</b> wild-type <b>strains</b> amplified only group <b>A</b> wild-type <b>strains,</b> and 3 A-specific PCR amplified only 3 <b>A</b> <b>strains.</b> PCR specific to group B wild-type strains amplified all group A and group B <b>strains</b> but gave <b>a</b> 688 -bp product for group B wild-type <b>strains,</b> <b>a</b> 279 -bp product for 2 B <b>strains,</b> <b>a</b> 547 -bp product for all group <b>A</b> <b>strains,</b> and <b>an</b> additional 688 -bp product for some group <b>A</b> <b>strains,</b> including 3 <b>A</b> <b>strains.</b> These types of PCR assays can, {{in conjunction with other}} methods, be used to efficiently distinguish candidate vaccine strains from other respiratory syncytial virus strains...|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>strain</b> is <b>a</b> {{series of}} musical phrases {{that create a}} {{distinct}} melody of <b>a</b> piece. <b>A</b> <b>strain</b> {{is often referred to}} as a [...] "section" [...] of a musical piece. Often, <b>a</b> <b>strain</b> is repeated for the sake of instilling the melody clearly. This is so in ragtime and marches.|$|R

It was {{listed on the}} National Register of Historic Places as the W. <b>A.</b> <b>Strain</b> House in 1978. A boundary increase in 2001 expanded the area covered from 2 acres to 163 acres and the property listing name was changed to W. <b>A.</b> <b>Strain</b> Farm-Strain House.|$|R
5|$|Berkshire {{appears to}} have passed from Mercian to West Saxon control during Beorhtwulf's reign. The Welsh are {{recorded}} to have rebelled against Beorhtwulf's successor, Burgred, shortly after Beorhtwulf's death, suggesting that Beorhtwulf had been their overlord. Charters from Beorthwulf's reign show <b>a</b> <b>strained</b> relationship with the church, as Beorhtwulf seized land and subsequently returned it.|$|E
5|$|Cain {{started the}} 2014 season 1–3 with a 3.66 ERA {{in his first}} eight starts, before being placed on the 15-day DL with <b>a</b> <b>strained</b> right {{hamstring}} on May 30, 2014. Bruce Bochy stated that after the All Star break, Cain would move from the {{second place in the}} Giants starting rotation to fifth. Bochy added that Cain falling in the order {{had more to do with}} everyone else's successes than any shortcomings of Cain.|$|E
5|$|During spring {{training}} with the Nationals, Doug developed <b>a</b> <b>strained</b> lat muscle {{on his right}} side that {{put him on the}} disabled list to start the 2014 season. He returned on May 9 against the Oakland Athletics where he gave up 5 earned runs on 9 hits in 4.1 innings. He bounced back in his next start, against the Arizona Diamondbacks, Fister gave up just 1 earned run on 5 hits in 7 innings.|$|E

40|$|Efficient {{incorporation}} of exogenous galactose into lipopolysaccharide {{was observed in}} <b>a</b> <b>strain</b> with <b>a</b> galE::Tn 10 insertion and <b>a</b> <b>strain</b> with <b>a</b> deletion of galOPE. No incorporation was observed in <b>a</b> <b>strain</b> with <b>a</b> longer (galETK) deletion, indicating that incorporation into the galE mutants was due to {{a low level of}} expression of galTK from internal or fortuitous promoters. These galE mutants provided a convenient and specific way to radiolabel lipopolysaccharide...|$|R
5|$|He {{started his}} {{professional}} football career at Lumezzane and {{played for the}} first team twice before having an unsuccessful trial at Barcelona, and subsequently joining Internazionale in 2007. Inter manager Roberto Mancini brought Balotelli into the first team, but when Mancini left, Balotelli's disciplinary record fell away. He had <b>a</b> <b>strained</b> relationship with new manager José Mourinho and was suspended from Inter's first team in January 2009 {{after a number of}} disciplinary problems.|$|E
5|$|Hughes {{began the}} 2008 {{season as the}} third starter in the Yankees' rotation. In his first six starts, he had an 0–4 record and a 9.00 ERA. On April 30, he {{was placed on the}} {{disabled}} list with <b>a</b> <b>strained</b> oblique and cracked rib. On a May 2 visit to an optometrist, Hughes was found to be slightly nearsighted; as a result, he started wearing glasses on the mound.|$|E

40|$|<b>A</b> <b>strain</b> sensor uses {{optical fibers}} {{including}} strain insensitive portions and <b>a</b> <b>strain</b> sensitive portion. The optical fibers form a sensitive arm of an optical {{phase locked loop}} (OPLL). The use of the OPLL allows for multimode optical fiber {{to be used in}} <b>a</b> <b>strain</b> insensitive configuration. Only strain information for the strain sensitive portion is monitored rather than the integrated strain measurements commonly made with optical fiber sensors...|$|R
40|$|Cell {{extracts}} of Streptococcus species {{important in}} cheese starters stimulated {{the growth of}} Lactobacillus species common to Cheddar cheese. All Lactobacillus strains employed, {{with the exception of}} <b>a</b> <b>strain</b> of L. casei, were significantly stimulated by <b>a</b> <b>strain</b> of S. diacetilactis. L. casei was highly stimulated by both <b>a</b> <b>strain</b> of S. lactis and <b>a</b> <b>strain</b> of S. diacetilactis. The stimulant(s) was dialyzable and was partially inactivated by heat. The stimulatory principle was active at 10 C, indicating that the stimulatory effect may be influencing the growth of lactobacilli in Cheddar cheese during curing. Viable Streptococcus cells did not inhibit the growth of Lactobacillus species...|$|R

5|$|Bradley {{spent the}} entire 2003 {{campaign}} with the Indians. Despite being placed on the 15-day DL with <b>a</b> <b>strained</b> right hamstring and missing the final six {{weeks of the season}} with a lower back injury, he led the team in stolen bases, with 17. On August 30, while on the DL with a back injury, he was ticketed for speeding in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. After being stopped, he refused the ticket and sped away. He pleaded not guilty to speeding and fleeing charges on September 12, but was sentenced to a three-day jail term. The ruling was upheld by the Supreme Court of Ohio in December 2004.|$|E
5|$|Colbert {{often makes}} digs {{at the expense}} of Daily Show host Jon Stewart. He has implied <b>a</b> <b>strained</b> {{relationship}} with Stewart, in contrast with the real Colbert's admiration for the comedian, and suggests that his departure from The Daily Show occurred under dubious circumstances. The character has described Stewart as a sexual predator and has been known to become tearful when his name is brought up. On the other hand, Colbert has also implied that he only got his own show by blackmailing Stewart with incriminating photographs.|$|E

40|$|The {{solid-phase}} radioimmunoassay inhibition {{method was}} {{used to analyze the}} noncapsular surface antigens of group A Neisseria meningitidis for type specificity. By use of antisera prepared against group <b>A</b> <b>strains,</b> three serologically distinct lipopolysaccharide antigens and five outer membrane protein antigens were identified among group <b>A</b> <b>strains</b> from <b>a</b> variety of geographical origins. Two of the lipopolysaccharide antigens were unique to group <b>A</b> <b>strains</b> while the third was similar to those on strains of other meningococcal serogroups. Fractionation of outer membrane proteins in the presence of 2 % sodium deoxycholate followed by quantitative inhibition of the typing reactions with the subfractions revealed that the protein responsible for type specificity was not the principal outer membrane protein, but, most likely, the 31, 000 -dalton, heat-modifiable outer membrane protein. Thus, although group <b>A</b> <b>strains</b> may share <b>a</b> common principal outer membrane protein, typing is feasible using other surface antigens. In a survey of 82 group <b>A</b> <b>strains,</b> 93 % were typable with respect to outer membrane proteins...|$|R

5|$|He {{revealed}} in his 1996 autobiography {{that he had}} <b>a</b> <b>strained</b> relationship with his brother Bobby. Though the pair had different personalities, Jack felt that Bobby began to drift away from the Charlton family following his marriage to Norma, who did not get along with their mother. Bobby did not see his mother after 1992 until her death on 25 March 1996 {{as a result of}} the feud, though he and Norma did attend her funeral. Though the two brothers remained distant, Jack presented Bobby with his BBC Sports Personality of the Year Lifetime Achievement Award on 14 December 2008.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Tony {{married the}} family's {{housekeeper}} Joan Gustafson. They had two children, Jennifer and Mario. Madonna resented her father for getting remarried, and began rebelling against him. They would have <b>a</b> <b>strained</b> relationship {{for many years}} afterward. She attended St. Frederick's and St. Andrew's Catholic Elementary Schools, and West Middle School. Madonna was known for her high grade point average, and achieved notoriety for her unconventional behavior. She would perform cartwheels and handstands in the hallways between classes, dangle by her knees from the monkey bars during recess, and pull up her skirt during class—all so that the boys could see her underwear.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, while {{pitching}} on a wet mound in Cleveland, Shuey {{injured his}} right hip. Over {{the next several}} seasons, he had multiple surgeries on his hip, including repairing a torn labrum and removing bone spurs. He finished the 1999 season with an 8–5 record, a 3.53 ERA, and six saves. His eight wins tied for the most among Cleveland's relief pitchers. In 2000, new Indians' manager Charlie Manuel indicated the Indians would attempt to shift Shuey into the closer role. When Shuey spent time {{on the disabled list}}, Steve Karsay served as the Indians' closer. He again spent time on the disabled list in 2001 with <b>a</b> <b>strained</b> elbow ligament.|$|E
40|$|When {{chimeric}} <b>A</b> <b>strain</b> mice {{tolerant of}} (A x C 57 BL/ 1) F 1 hybrid skin grafts are injected with spleen cells from normal A donors the recipients develop weight loss, clinical evidence of runting, {{and death in}} some animals. Similar recipients injected with spleen cells from <b>A</b> <b>strain</b> donors immunized against C 57 BL/ 1 tissue show a more rapid onset of the runting process and increased mortality. Runting in. these experiments therefore results from an immune attack by the injected <b>A</b> <b>strain</b> lymphoid cells against the (A x C 57 BL/ 1) F 1 hybrid tissue harbored by the chimeric recipients. Since the hybrid tissues of the chimeric recipients were derived from spleen cell populations we conclude that the immunologic rejection of lymphoid and hematopoietic tissue is sufficient to cause the runting syndrome. C 3 H mice tolerant of <b>A</b> <b>strain</b> skin grafts because of the prior injection of viable or disrupted <b>A</b> <b>strain</b> spleen material were given 400 r of x-irradiation and an injection of C 3 H spleen cells. Only the chimeric C 3 H mice harboring viable <b>A</b> <b>strain</b> cells developed weight loss and clinical evidence of disease, showing again that runting occurs only when an attack can be made against viable lymphoid and hematopoietic tissue. Normal <b>A</b> <b>strain</b> mice injected intravenously with 850 million (A x C 57 BL/ 1) F 1 hybrid spleen cells reject hybrid skin grafts and do not develop runting, whereas the rejection of similar hybrid tissue present in chimeric <b>A</b> <b>strain</b> mice results in runting. It is concluded that runting will occur only when the immunologic attack is directed against lymphoid and hematopoietic tissue which has become established within host tissues. The possibility that runting may result from hypersensitivity reactions occurring in the lymphoid tissues is discussed...|$|R
