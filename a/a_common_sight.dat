5|$|Chatwin's books also {{inspired}} {{some readers}} to visit Patagonia and Australia. As {{a result of}} his work, Patagonia experienced an increase in tourism, and it became <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>sight</b> for tourists to appear in the region, carrying a copy of In Patagonia. The Songlines also inspired readers to travel to Australia and seek out the people Chatwin had based his characters on, much to their consternation, as he had failed to disclose to these individuals his intentions.|$|E

50|$|The Roborovski hamster {{has been}} found to be more common in the {{southern}} area of its distribution range, in areas such as Yulin, Shaanxi, China. It has been reported as <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>sighting</b> by locals in this city and in the sand dunes of the Ordos desert.|$|R
5|$|In the Indian Ocean, hawksbills are <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>sight</b> {{along the}} east coast of Africa, {{including}} the seas surrounding Madagascar and nearby island groups, and all along the southern Asian coast, including the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, and the coasts of the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia. They are present across the Malay Archipelago and northern Australia. Their Pacific range is limited to the ocean's tropical and subtropical regions. In the west, it extends from the southwestern tips of the Korean Peninsula and the Japanese Archipelago south to northern New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|The willie wagtail is insectivorous {{and spends}} much time chasing prey in open habitat. Its common name {{is derived from}} its habit of wagging its tail {{horizontally}} when foraging on the ground. Aggressive and territorial, the willie wagtail will often harass much larger birds such as the laughing kookaburra and wedge-tailed eagle. It has responded well to human alteration of the landscape and is <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>sight</b> in urban lawns, parks, and gardens. It was widely featured in Aboriginal folklore around the country as either a bringer of bad news or a stealer of secrets.|$|E
5|$|Electric trams were <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>sight</b> {{in early}} 20th century Salford, and had from 1901 {{replaced}} the earlier horse-drawn vehicles. A network of lines crossed the region, with coordinated services running through Salford, Manchester {{and the surrounding}} areas. Many served the new suburban housing and industrial developments built at the time, but in 1947 they were withdrawn in favour of more practical services– buses. The city is served by a complex road infrastructure, with connections from the M602 motorway to several major motorways, and A-roads including the A57 Regent Road and the A6042 Trinity Way. Salford City Council has also created both advisory and mandatory cycle lanes across the city.|$|E

5|$|The Canadian Rockies {{ecoregion}} supports 70 mammals, 16 reptiles and amphibians, 168 birds, and 41 fish species. There is a {{high concentration}} of raptors in the area, bald eagles are <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>sight</b> near Lake Coeur d'Alene in December and January when kokanee spawn. The most common fish present in area lakes is the Washington-native rainbow trout, which is the official fish of Washington state. Big game common in eastern Washington include black and grizzly bears, caribou, Rocky Mountain elk, bighorn sheep, and cougar. Whitetail deer, mule deer, and moose are also found in abundance. The gray wolf population has been making a recovery in the Inland Northwest. As of June 2016, there are 16 wolf packs in eastern Washington. In August 2016, photo evidence confirmed a solitary wolf in Mount Spokane State Park.|$|E
5|$|The {{leopard shark}} (Triakis semifasciata) is {{a species of}} houndshark, in the family Triakidae. It is found along the Pacific coast of North America, from the U.S. state of Oregon to Mazatlán in Mexico. Typically {{measuring}} 1.2–1.5 m (3.9–4.9ft) long, this slender-bodied shark is immediately identifiable by the striking pattern of black saddle-like markings and large spots over its back, from which it derives its common name. Large schools of leopard sharks are <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>sight</b> in bays and estuaries, swimming over sandy or muddy flats or rock-strewn areas near kelp beds and reefs. They are most common near the coast, in water less than 4m (13ft) deep.|$|E
5|$|War {{memorials}} became <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>sight</b> in British {{towns and}} cities following the First World War (1914–1918). Almost one million men from Britain {{were killed in the}} conflict, and monuments were erected in virtually every settlement in the country. The memorial raised in Spalding, a town in southern Lincolnshire in eastern England, was designed by the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, who had previously established his reputation designing country houses for wealthy clients. From 1917 onwards, Lutyens dedicated much of his time to the memorialisation of the war dead, first advising the Imperial War Graves Commission (IWGC) and later designing war memorials both for the commission and through his own practice. Spalding was one of his first war memorial commissions.|$|E
50|$|From May to September, {{humpback}} {{whales are}} commonly spotted traveling between {{the rocks and}} the mainland and are <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>sighting</b> on the short boat trip between the mainland and the rocks.

5|$|A {{majority}} of starling predators are avian. The typical response of starling groups {{is to take}} flight, with <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>sight</b> being undulating flocks of starling flying high in quick and agile patterns. Their abilities in flight are seldom matched by birds of prey. Adult common starlings are hunted by hawks such as the northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) and Eurasian sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus), and falcons including the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), Eurasian hobby (Falco subbuteo) and common kestrel (Falco tinnunculus). Slower raptors like black and red kites (Milvus migrans & milvus), eastern imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca), common buzzard (Buteo buteo) and Australasian harrier (Circus approximans) tend to take the more easily caught fledglings or juveniles. While perched in groups by night, they can be vulnerable to owls, including the little owl (Athene noctua), long-eared owl (Asio otus), short-eared owl (Asio flammeus), barn owl (Tyto alba), tawny owl (Strix aluco) and Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo).|$|E
5|$|In the 2000s, {{supporter}} {{culture in}} Sweden started {{to shift from}} being English-influenced to being more influenced by the Southern European countries and their football culture, making tifos and ultras <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>sight</b> in Swedish arenas. From acting as an almost uniform group of fans gathered under the same flag, (Änglarna), IFK fans created separate supporter factions, including Ultra Bulldogs, Young Lions and West Coast Angelz. IFK {{is the most popular}} football club in Sweden; a 2004 survey concluded that IFK Göteborg had support from 13% of Swedish football fans, and a 2017 survey again stated that IFK was the most popular club in Sweden, with a support of 10%. A majority, 55%, of football fans in Gothenburg support IFK, and the club is the fourth most popular in Stockholm (after AIK, Djurgårdens IF and Hammarby IF) and the second most popular in Malmö, after Malmö FF.|$|E
5|$|Once <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>sight</b> {{in much of}} the continent, {{the bald}} eagle was {{severely}} affected in the mid-20th century by a variety of factors, among them the thinning of egg shells attributed to use of the pesticide DDT. Bald eagles, like many birds of prey, were especially affected by DDT due to biomagnification. DDT itself was not lethal to the adult bird, but it interfered with the bird's calcium metabolism, making the bird either sterile or unable to lay healthy eggs. Female eagles laid eggs that were too brittle to withstand the weight of a brooding adult, making it nearly impossible for the eggs to hatch. It is estimated that in the early 18th century, the bald eagle population was 300,000–500,000, but by the 1950s there were only 412 nesting pairs in the 48 contiguous states of the US.|$|E

5|$|The {{modern art}} {{movement}} in the country officially emerged in the 1950s, culminating {{in the establishment of}} an art society. Expressionism and surrealism, as well as calligraphic art are the popular forms of art in the country. Abstract expressionism has gained popularity in recent decades. Pottery-making and textile weaving are also popular products that were widely made in Bahraini villages. Arabic calligraphy grew in popularity as the Bahraini government was an active patron in Islamic art, culminating in the establishment of an Islamic museum, Beit Al Quran. The Bahrain national museum houses a permanent contemporary art exhibition. The architecture of Bahrain {{is similar to that of}} its neighbours in the Persian Gulf. The wind tower, which generates natural ventilation in a house, is <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>sight</b> on old buildings, particularly in the old districts of Manama and Muharraq.|$|E
5|$|The {{relatively}} {{low levels of}} damage in the towns of Avaj or Ab-e-Garm in comparison to Changureh and Ab Darreh suggest a focus of damage to the northwest of the epicenter due to northwest propagation. In Changureh, only two buildings were left standing and over 120 casualties occurred. Ab Darreh also fared poorly; the disaster destroyed the town's only mosque, toppled 40 homes and killed at least 20 people. North of Avaj, {{in the village of}} Esmailabad, survivors recovered 38 corpses, a ninth of the total population, while searching for the missing, feared trapped in the ruins. In another village in the vicinity, Aliabad, two shepherds were the only known survivors. In the small village of Kisse-Jin, roughly 80 corpses were recovered following the rupture. Survivors crying and beating their heads and faces over loved ones were <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>sight</b> on Iranian state television.|$|E
5|$|Many birds call Adams home or a {{stopover}} {{on their}} migration routes. Songbirds include three species of chickadee, two kinglets, several thrushes, warblers, sparrows, and finches. One unique songbird {{to the high}} elevations is the gray-crowned rosy finch, who can be found far up the mountain, well above the tree line. Raptors {{that live in the}} forest and meadows include Accipiters, red-tailed hawks, golden and bald eagles, ospreys, great horned owls, and falcons. The many snags around the mountain provide forage and nesting habitat for the many species of woodpeckers that live there including the hairy woodpecker, downy woodpecker, and white-headed woodpecker. Jays such as the Steller's jay and gray jay are common and the gray jay is an especially familiar character, as they will boldly investigate campers and hikers. Another familiar character of the higher elevation forests is the Clark's nutcracker with its distinctive call. Swallows and swifts are frequently seen flying just above the water of lakes and some larger streams. Common mergansers and several other species of water birds can be found on many of the lakes as well. The American dipper with its unique way of bobbing about along streams and then ducking into the water is <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>sight.</b> Several grouse species, the sooty, spruce, and ruffed grouse and the white-tailed ptarmigan, call the forests and the lower slopes of the mountain home.|$|E
50|$|Renowned for {{its water}} birds and waders, over 200 {{species of birds}} have been {{recorded}} in the reserve. This warranted it being an Important Bird Area (IBA). The reserve is the only protected {{area in which the}} globally threatened and Kenya-endemic Hinde's babbler (Turdoides hindei) is known to occur. Mwea National Reserve also shelters two other rare species; the Pel's fishing owl (Scotopelia peli) and the white-backed night heron (Gorsachius leuconotus).

5|$|Unlike many waterfowl, mallards {{have benefited}} from human {{alterations}} to the worldso much {{so that they are}} now considered an invasive species in some regions. They are <b>a</b> <b>common</b> <b>sight</b> in urban parks, lakes, ponds, and other man-made water features in the regions they inhabit, and are often tolerated or encouraged in human habitat due to their placid nature towards humans and their beautiful and iridescent colours. While most are not domesticated, mallards are so successful at coexisting in human regions that the main conservation risk they pose comes from the loss of genetic diversity among a region's traditional ducks once humans and mallards colonise an area. Mallards are very adaptable, being able to live and even thrive in urban areas which may have supported more localised, sensitive species of waterfowl before development. The release of feral mallards in areas where they are not native sometimes creates problems through interbreeding with indigenous waterfowl. These non-migratory mallards interbreed with indigenous wild ducks from local populations of closely related species through genetic pollution by producing fertile offspring. Complete hybridisation of various species of wild duck gene pools could result in the extinction of many indigenous waterfowl. The wild mallard itself is the ancestor of most domestic ducks, and its naturally evolved wild gene pool gets genetically polluted in turn by the domesticated and feral populations.|$|E
