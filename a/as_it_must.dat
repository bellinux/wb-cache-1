5|$|The Second Generation is {{a single}} {{compilation}} book which picks the most important tales from the Tales series and details {{the children of the}} Companions, all of whom become players in the later story. This book is considered {{to be part of the}} main storyline, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be read to understand the events that happened between the War of the Lance and the Chaos War. This novel develops characters that would later be seen in the War of Souls trilogy.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the spacecraft's orbit and facilitate maneuvers, sixteen Sun sensors – eight primaries and eight backups – are placed around the spacecraft to calibrate solar direction relative to the orbiter's frame. Two star trackers, digital cameras used to map the position of catalogued stars, provide NASA with full, three-axis knowledge of the spacecraft orientation and attitude. A primary and backup Miniature Inertial Measurement Unit (MIMU), provided by Honeywell, measures changes to the spacecraft attitude as well as any non-gravitationally induced changes to its linear velocity. Each MIMU is a combination of three accelerometers and three ring-laser gyroscopes. These systems are all critically important to MRO, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be able to point its camera to a very high precision in order to take the high-quality pictures that the mission requires. It has also been specifically designed to minimize any vibrations on the spacecraft, so as to allow its instruments to take images without any distortions caused by vibrations.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} is centred on the Storkyrkan church, first mentioned in historical records in 1279 and gradually enlarged {{over the following}} centuries. In 1468–1496, {{during the reign of}} Sten Sture the Elder, its size was doubled — the chapels where transformed into aisles, while rounded windows and a taller roof allowed more light into the building. The building in the painting depicts the church <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> have appeared when Gustav Vasa became king — the buttresses added in the 1550s are not present in the painting, which seem to confirm that the 17th century copy was faithful to the original. The church still exists, although the present exterior is mostly a later Baroque design.|$|E

5|$|The {{painting}} {{is divided into}} an upper part depicting the halo phenomenon viewed vertically and a lower part depicting the city <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> have appeared viewed from Södermalm in the late Middle Ages. The medieval urban conglomeration, today {{part of the old}} town Gamla stan, is rendered using a bird's-eye view. The stone and brick buildings are densely packed below the church and castle, which are rendered in a descriptive perspective (i.e., their size relates to their social status, rather than their actual dimensions). Scattered wooden structures appear on the surrounding rural ridges, today part of central Stockholm. Though the phenomenon is said to have occurred in the morning, the city is depicted in the evening with shadows facing east.|$|E

25|$|A {{main supply}} valve with {{non-return}} valve, which supplies gas {{to the main}} gas supply hose of the umbilical. This is usually a quarter-turn valve, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be quick to operate and obvious whether it is open or closed.|$|E
25|$|Streptomycin is an {{antibiotic}} drug, {{the first of}} a class of drugs called aminoglycosides to be discovered, and was the first antibiotic remedy for tuberculosis. Streptomycin cannot be given orally <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be administered by regular intramuscular injection. In 1943, Albert Schatz discovered Streptomycin.|$|E
25|$|Japanese {{knotweed}} {{has a large}} {{underground network}} of roots (rhizomes). To eradicate the plant the roots need to be killed. All above-ground portions of the plant need to be controlled repeatedly for several years in order to weaken and kill the entire patch. Picking the right herbicide is essential, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> travel through the plant and into the root system below.|$|E

25|$|A pneumofathometer supply valve, which {{supplies}} gas to the pneumofathometer for the diver. This valve {{is usually}} near the main supply valve {{but with a}} different handle. It is usually a needle type valve <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be finely adjustable, but {{it must also be}} large enough to allow a fairly high flow rate, as the air may be used as an alternative breathing air source, or to fill small lift bags.|$|E
25|$|The extant {{fragments}} of the Histories (some discovered in 1886) show sufficiently well the political partisan, who took a keen pleasure in describing the reaction against Sulla's policy and legislation after the dictator's death. Historians regret {{the loss of the}} work, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> have thrown much light on a very eventful period, embracing the war against Sertorius (died 72 BC), the campaigns of Lucullus against Mithradates VI of Pontus (75-66 BC), and the victories of Pompey in the East (66-62 BC).|$|E
25|$|Tinamous are avid bathers. During {{heavy rain}} they may stand erect with their bill {{pointing}} skyward allowing the rain to wash over them. They will dust-bathe at regular intervals, {{and have been}} known to dust-bathe often enough to tint themselves the same color as the soil. They also sunbathe, and will do so while resting on one leg with an outstretched wing. Defecation for a tinamou is a slightly involved task <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> move aside the dense plumage that surrounds the cloaca to avoid soiling itself. Captive tinamous defecate once daily.|$|E

25|$|CRISPR/Cas9 often {{employs a}} plasmid to {{transfect}} the target cells. The main components of this plasmid {{are displayed in}} the image and listed in the table. The crRNA needs to be designed for each application as this is the sequence that Cas9 uses to identify and directly bind to the cell's DNA. The crRNA must bind only where editing is desired. The repair template is designed for each application, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> overlap with the sequences {{on either side of}} the cut and code for the insertion sequence.|$|E
25|$|If {{religious}} liberty includes, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>must,</b> {{the right to}} communicate such experiences to others, {{it seems to me}} an impossible task for juries to separate fancied ones from real ones, dreams from happenings, and hallucinations from true clairvoyance. Such experiences, like some tones and colors, have existence for one, but none at all for another. They cannot be verified to the minds of those whose field of consciousness does not include religious insight. When one comes to trial which turns on any aspect of religious belief or representation, unbelievers among his judges are likely not to understand, and are almost certain not to believe, him.|$|E
25|$|Ontario, Canada's {{most populous}} province, generates some 9,600 MW annually, {{over half of}} that coming from one dozen nuclear reactors. Ontario also has natural gas, and hydro facilities. However, Ontario faces a {{challenge}} <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> replace 80% of its generating capacity in the next twenty years—the old stations have time-expired and the nuclear reactors are overstressed. A debate continues over whether to go largely nuclear or go with renewables. Since the Green Energy Act 2009, the debate has become even more heated. As one of the outcomes of the Act, electricity prices have exponentially - by 95% for homeowners and by 115% for small businesses {{in the province of}} Ontario.|$|E

50|$|Two {{qualifications}} {{exist for}} the metaphor <b>as</b> mistake: <b>It</b> <b>must</b> be given by an authority figure, and <b>it</b> <b>must</b> have a certain aura of mystery around it. In this way, the metaphor becomes both right (given by authority) and wrong (not strictly true as a descriptor).|$|R

25|$|It {{is inconceivable}} that inanimate brute matter should, without the {{mediation}} of something else which is not material, operate upon and affect other matter, without mutual contact, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> do if gravitation {{in the sense of}} Epicurus be essential and inherent in it. And this is one reason why I desired you would not ascribe 'innate gravity' to me. That gravity should be innate, inherent, and essential to matter, so that one body may act upon another at a distance, through a vacuum, without {{the mediation of}} anything else, by and through which their action and force may be conveyed from one to another, is to me so great an absurdity, that I believe no man who has in philosophical matters a competent faculty of thinking can ever fall into it. Gravity must be caused by an agent acting constantly according to certain laws; but whether this agent be material or immaterial, I have left to the consideration of my readers.|$|E
