5|$|<b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>medical</b> garment, metal <b>corsets</b> endured {{well into}} the 20th century. The Mexican painter Frida Kahlo was a notable wearer of such <b>medical</b> <b>corsets,</b> {{following}} ongoing problems {{as a result of}} a serious road crash she experienced as a teenager. By 1944, Kahlo's doctors had recommended that she wear a steel corset instead of the plaster ones she had mainly worn since the accident; and Kahlo, whose paintings were heavily autobiographical, used the new corset as the basis for one of her best known self-portraits, The Broken Column. In the painting, Kahlo portrays herself weeping with agony, her torso split open revealing that her spine is a crumbling Ionic column, and her damaged body held together by the steel corset. A form of metal corset or orthopaedic brace used in the second half of the 20th century is called a Harris brace after its inventor, R.I. Harris. Harris braces are designed to immobilise the waist whilst healing, and are made with two bendable metal bands worn above and below the waist, and connected with rigid metal supports.|$|R

25|$|Aside from {{fashion and}} <b>medical</b> uses, <b>corsets</b> {{are also used}} in sexual fetishism, most notably in BDSM activities. In BDSM, a {{submissive}} {{may be required to}} wear a corset, which would be laced very tightly and restrict the wearer to some degree. A dominant may also wear a corset, often black, but for entirely different reasons, such as aesthetics. A specially designed corset, in which the breasts and vulva are exposed, can be worn during vanilla sex or BDSM activities.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Objective. To {{review the}} extent to which the {{literature}} supports the position that <b>a</b> <b>medical</b> home is important and to review {{the extent to}} which insurance is related to having <b>a</b> <b>medical</b> home. Methods. <b>A</b> review of literature concerning the bene-fits of <b>a</b> <b>medical</b> home on effectiveness, costs, and equity (reducing disparities) was conducted. Results. International and within-nation studies indi-cate that a relationship with <b>a</b> <b>medical</b> home is associated with better health, on both the individual and population levels, with lower overall costs of care and with reduc-tions in disparities in health between socially disadvan-taged subpopulations and more socially advantaged pop-ulations. Although important in facilitating use overall, insurance does not guarantee <b>a</b> <b>medical</b> home...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, Author {{presents}} basic definitions {{found in}} the Polish literature concerning medical error and medical event. Author proposes her own definitions for the terms. The concept of <b>a</b> <b>medical</b> event was first used in the recent Act of 28 April 2011 amending the act on the patient's rights and Patient's Ombudsman, and the act on obligatory insurance, Guarantee Fund and the Polish Motor Insurers' Bureau, while the notion of <b>a</b> <b>medical</b> error {{has been used for}} long. Thus, Author examines differences between the two terms. Based on analysis, Author concludes that the occurrence of <b>a</b> <b>medical</b> event does not require us to demonstrate who has contributed its occurrence, while such demonstration is required in the case of <b>a</b> <b>medical</b> error. The two terms are associated with different scopes of liability for the occurred medical event or error, that is, <b>a</b> <b>medical</b> event is limited to therapeutic activities activity of hospitals while liability for <b>a</b> <b>medical</b> error may be attributed to all medicinal entities...|$|R
