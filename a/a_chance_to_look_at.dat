500|$|Despite Volition's {{interest}} {{and desire to}} develop add-ons and expansions for FreeSpace 2, Interplay told them to stop. Volition was then acquired by THQ in 2000. As Interplay owns {{the rights to the}} FreeSpace series (as well as the Descent series) and Volition's owners, THQ, is only interested in pursuing development on what they own, Volition was unable to continue developing the FreeSpace franchise. Faced with source code which became practically useless to them, Volition released the source code for only game engines to the public under a noncommercial license on April 25, 2002. Mike Kulas, the President of Volition, said this was to give those outside the game industry <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the code of a commercial software product, a desire he and Matt Toschlog had when they were not yet in the industry. In the years since, no sequels to FreeSpace 2 have been made and Interplay has only published a limited re-release of it on February 2, 2004, to commemorate the company's 20th anniversary. [...] Interplay, by that time, was in financial trouble, failing to pay rent and wages to its workers. [...] Seeking investors to inject it with funds, Interplay changed business strategies: instead of developing and publishing single-player games, it sold licenses to those games and looked towards developing massive multi-player online games. Derek Smart, creator of Battlecruiser 3000AD, had casually mentioned his interest in the Freespace license, but nothing significant came out of this. In 2013, Interplay acquired the remaining rights to the FreeSpace franchise for $7,500 after THQ went to bankruptcy court.|$|E

It's bleak because I can't — many of us can't hear her sweet voice — but it's great because she did live, and she was ours. I mean African-Americans and white Americans and Asians, Spanish-speaking — she belonged to us and that's a great thing." ...|$|E

60|$|He was {{standing}} facing the girl now {{and for the}} first time he had <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her squarely and closely. She was very beautiful--that was undeniable; but Tarzan realized her beauty only in a subconscious way. It was superficial--it did not color her soul which must be black as sin. She was German--a German spy. He hated her and desired only to compass her destruction; but he would choose the manner so that it would work most grievously against the enemy cause.|$|E

[...] And {{he went to the}} open door, met Madame de Cintre on the threshold, took her by the hand, and led her into the room. She was dressed in white; but a long blue cloak, which hung almost to her feet, was {{fastened}} across her shoulders by a silver clasp. She had tossed it back, however, and her long white arms were uncovered. In her dense, fair hair there glittered a dozen diamonds. She looked serious and, Newman thought, rather pale; but she glanced round her, and, when she saw him, smiled and put out her hand. He thought her tremendously handsome. He had <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her full in the face, for she stood a moment in the centre of the room, hesitating, apparently, what she should do, without meeting his eyes. Then she went up to her mother, who sat in her deep chair by the fire, looking at Madame de Cintre almost fiercely. With her back turned to the others, Madame de Cintre held her cloak apart to show her dress.|$|E

50|$|Through the Keyhole {{originally}} {{started as}} a segment on TV-am, first being broadcast on its launch day on 1 February 1983.

Grossman was mistakenly given the job after someone confused him with a journalist. It became a regular feature of TV-am throughout 1983.|$|R

With themes like the environment, citizenship, violence and respect, we seek to stimulate the reflection of the participants about the reality that surrounds them, their school, their family, their neighborhood and country. At the end of the program, the participants share the knowledge they had learned with their community. Since 1995, the program has already been in more than 70 educational institutions throughout Brazil.|$|E
