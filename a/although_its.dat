5|$|A 2007 study {{suggested}} that Massospondylus {{may have used}} its short arms for defense against predators ("defensive swats"), in intraspecies combat, or in feeding, <b>although</b> <b>its</b> arms were too short to reach its mouth. Scientists speculate that Massospondylus could have used its large pollex (thumb) claw in combat, to strip plant material from trees, digging, or for grooming.|$|E

5|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the film}} was varied; <b>although</b> <b>its</b> script and cast were praised by many reviews, its animation quality was heavily criticized. The film was a commercial success, earning over thirteen times its less-than-$8 million budget. A sequel, Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil, directed by Mike Disa, and written by the Edwards brothers and Leech, was released in 2011 to negative reviews and financial failure.|$|E
