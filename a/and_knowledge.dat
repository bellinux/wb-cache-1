The 74 female participants completed the WOKI {{at the outset of the}} 1995 - 96 school year.

40|$|In teacher education, general {{pedagogical}} <b>and</b> psychological <b>knowledge</b> {{is often}} taught {{separately from the}} teaching subject itself, potentially leading to inert knowledge. In an experimental study with 69 mathematics student teachers, we tested the benefits of fostering the integration of pedagogical content <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> general pedagogical <b>and</b> psychological <b>knowledge</b> with respect to knowledge application. Integration was fostered either by integrating the contents or by prompting the learners to integrate separately-taught knowledge. Fostering integration, as compared to a separate presentation without integration help, led to more applicable pedagogical <b>and</b> psychological <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> greater simultaneous application of pedagogical <b>and</b> psychological <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> pedagogical content <b>knowledge.</b> The advantages of fostering knowledge integration were not moderated by the student teachers’ prior knowledge or working memory capacity.

40|$|Hegemonic discourses and {{ideologies}} {{of social work}} in South Africa, arose from the racist capitalism of colonialism and apartheid. Imperatives for social justice and social change therefore require that social work education reflect on and develop discourses of radical <b>and</b> critical <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> practice. The main aim {{of the study was}} to explore the extent to which South African social work <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> education, as reflected in various formal and narrative discourses, meets critical imperatives for social change and transformation. The study was qualitative in nature, using a depth-hermeneutic approach, with various interrelated, coherent empirical processes. These include reviewing extant theory to contribute to a framework of <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> practice constitutive of social change, conducting a politically engaged, critical thematic analysis of social work discourse constitutive of social change, as reflected historically in a selection of formal South African social work texts and in the narratives from group conversations among South African social work educators. Early South African social work <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> practice had emerged from the ‘social hygiene’ and eugenics movement, but later, Afrikaner nationalist ideology and liberal and racist capitalism shaped social work. In postapartheid South Africa, discourses of social development and reform within a free market rational economy; ideologies of liberalism and capitalism as solutions to structural social problems, neo-liberal discourses of individual responsibility and valorisation of agency, social control and regulation, are prevalent. Social work <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> practice consistently supported hegemonic ideologies of the state. Throughout the history of social work however, there was evidence of counterhegemonic, radical and critical discourse, albeit suppressed <b>and</b> hidden. <b>Knowledge</b> <b>and</b> practice constitutive of social change can be positioned on a continuum from oppressive, domesticating <b>and</b> colonizing <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> practice, to coercion and status quo maintenance, to institutional <b>and</b> societal reformist <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> practice; to transformational <b>and</b> critical <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> practice; and to radical <b>and</b> revolutionary <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> practice...|$|R
