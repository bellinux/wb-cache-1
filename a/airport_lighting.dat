40|$|The {{development}} of machine vision based pilot aids {{to help reduce}} night approach and landing accidents is explored. The techniques developed are motivated {{by the desire to}} use the available information sources for navigation such as the <b>airport</b> <b>lighting</b> layout, attitude sensors and Global Positioning System to derive more precise aircraft position and orientation information. The fact that <b>airport</b> <b>lighting</b> geometry is known and that images of <b>airport</b> <b>lighting</b> can be acquired by the camera, has lead to the synthesis of machine vision based algorithms for runway relative aircraft position and orientation estimation. The main contribution of this research is the synthesis of seven navigation algorithms based on two broad families of solutions. The first family of solution methods consists of techniques that reconstruct the <b>airport</b> <b>lighting</b> layout from the camera image and then estimate the aircraft position components by comparing the reconstructed lighting layout geometry with the known model of the <b>airport</b> <b>lighting</b> layout geometry. The second family of methods comprises techniques that synthesize the image of the <b>airport</b> <b>lighting</b> layout using a camera model and estimate the aircraft position and orientation by comparing this image with the actual image of the <b>airport</b> <b>lighting</b> acquired by the camera. Algorithms 1 through 4 belong to the first family of solutions while Algorithms 5 through 7 belong to the second family of solutions. Algorithms 1 and 2 are parameter optimization methods, Algorithms 3 and 4 are feature correspondence methods and Algorithms 5 through 7 are Kalman filter centered algorithms. Results of computer simulation are presented to demonstrate the performance of all the seven algorithms developed...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the science of measurement and control by outlining a unique methodology for objectively assessing the luminous intensity of all luminaires forming an airport landing lighting pattern, whilst in service, to check that the lighting pattern conforms to the strict standards set by airports ’ governing body within the UK the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Central to this methodology is a novel air-based measurement system consisting of charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras and dedicated image-processing software. This prototype measurement system is placed inside the cockpit of an aircraft and is used to take images of the airport landing lighting system whilst the aircraft approaches the airport. Developed image-processing techniques then allow unique luminaire identification and extraction from the hundreds of luminaires within the <b>airport</b> <b>lighting</b> pattern. The corresponding luminous intensity and alignment of each luminaire is derived using dynamic position and orientation information estimated from a visual environment model. By obtaining luminous intensity and alignment information for each luminaire within the pattern, it is then possible to derive its associated isocandela diagram. This then allows an assessment to be made regarding the luminaires ’ conformity to the CAA standards. The unique system has been teste...|$|E
