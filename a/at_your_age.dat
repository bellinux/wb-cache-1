2500|$|In reply, Eminescu stated that, {{regardless}} of the Slavic suffix in Eminovici, his own lineage was Moldavian and aristocratic. Author and psychologist [...] Vlad Mixich cites Eminescu's full answer as a sample of press insult in late 19th-century Romania: [...] "The things Mr. N. Xenopoulos says are, in my view, the figments of a fomenting imagination, excited by the sting of my putdown. But {{who do you think}} you are to be allowed, <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>age</b> and with the knowledge you don't have, to give yourself such superior airs?" ...|$|E
60|$|CRAMPTON (propitiating her). No, no. It's perhaps natural <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>age.</b>|$|E
6000|$|L. Perhaps not. <b>At</b> <b>your</b> <b>ages</b> you {{may think}} 'bride' sounds better; but wife's the word for wear, depend upon it. It is the great word in which the English and Latin {{languages}} conquer the French and the Greek. I hope the French will some day get a word for it, yet, instead of their dreadful 'femme.' But {{what do you think}} it comes from? ...|$|R

60|$|MISS BEECH. Of {{course you}} do. Nobody else would <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>age,</b> but you do.|$|E
60|$|BURGESS (shocked). What! Got the 'orrors, Mr. Morchbanks! Oh, that's bad, <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>age.</b> You {{must leave}} it off grajally.|$|E
60|$|MALONE. I hope not, Miss Robinson; but <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>age</b> {{you might}} think many things {{unreasonable}} that don't seem so to me.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{quantities}} of company," [...] replied her cousin, [...] "will interfere with you far less in your schoolroom with the Miss Lyddells, than alone with my Lady Marchmont, where, <b>at</b> <b>your</b> unrecognized <b>age,</b> {{you would be}} in rather an awkward situation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, child, what a colour you have!" [...] said Lady Belamour, {{taking off}} her mask. [...] "You need no aids to nature <b>at</b> <b>your</b> happy <b>age.</b> That is right, children," [...] as they curtsied {{and kissed her}} hand. [...] "Go into the house, I wish to speak with your cousin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is a pity," [...] {{he said at}} last, with a frown. [...] "Of course, you {{understand}} that Vyner and Son are not anxious to dispense with <b>your</b> services—not <b>at</b> all. In certain circumstances you might remain with us another ten or fifteen years, and then go with a good retiring allowance. <b>At</b> <b>your</b> present <b>age</b> {{there would be no}} allowance. Do {{you understand}} me?" ...|$|R
60|$|MISS FOSTER. I {{am afraid}} that even <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>age</b> George Austin held a very {{different}} position from the distinguished Anthony Musgrave.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] {{said the}} Philosopher, [...] "what's this? Cicero's De Senectute, <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>age,</b> too? Martial's Epigrams, Caesar's Commentaries. What! a {{classical}} scholar?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's done you good," [...] {{suggested}} the secretary with ironic seriousness. [...] "Takes your mind off that silly trouble. <b>At</b> <b>your</b> <b>age</b> too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One day Apelles said to me, after {{glancing at}} the drawing on which I was engaged: 'If you were ten years younger you might do {{something}} {{in the field of}} art, for you would make an excellent model for the picture I am about to begin. But <b>at</b> <b>your</b> present <b>age</b> you {{would not be able to}} sustain the fatigue of remaining in a constrained position for any length of time.' 'What is the subject?' I asked. 'A centurion in battle,' said he.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is {{this part}} of your European manners, Pamela?" [...] she whispered, [...] "that you dine alone in a {{restaurant}} with an acquaintance? Let me tell you frankly that I dislike the idea most heartily. My chaperonage is always <b>at</b> <b>your</b> service, and any girl of <b>your</b> <b>age</b> in America would be delighted to avail herself of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah, my love,' exclaimed Cornichon, 'at length I {{shall be}} able to give you the best proof of my devotion by showing you how I value the beauties of your mind above those of your body! While the most charming women of the court will fall victims to my youth and strength, I shall think of nothing but how to lay them <b>at</b> <b>your</b> feet, and pay heart-felt homage to <b>your</b> <b>age</b> and wrinkles.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You! <b>At</b> <b>your</b> <b>age!</b> No! You mean you're {{the late}} Charlemagne; {{you must be}} six or seven hundred years old, at the very least." ...|$|E
6000|$|At this Mrs. Luna broke {{again into}} {{articulate}} scoffing. [...] "It is very odd that <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>age</b> {{you should be}} so little {{a man of the}} world!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There {{is nothing}} unnatural in such feeling <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>age.</b> When you are older you will smile at such moods, {{and at the}} mishaps {{that gave rise to}} them.' ...|$|E

2500|$|If {{a worker}} delays {{receiving}} Social Security retirement benefits until after they reach full retirement age {{there is a}} Social Security benefits increase by a certain percentage—depending on date of birth. After age 70 {{there are no more}} increases in retirement benefits allowed. Social Security uses an [...] "average" [...] survival rate <b>at</b> <b>your</b> full retirement <b>age</b> to prorate the increase in the amount of benefit increase so that the total benefits are roughly the same whenever you retire. Women may benefit more than men from this delayed benefit increase since the [...] "average" [...] survival rates are based on both men and women and women live approximately three years longer than men. The other consideration is that workers only have a limited number of years of [...] "good" [...] health left after they reach full retirement age and unless they enjoy their job they may be passing up an opportunity to do something else they may enjoy doing while they are still relatively healthy.|$|R
60|$|If I had had {{any idea}} of your coming (see how {{naturally}} I use the word when I am three hundred miles off!) to London so soon, I would never have written one word about the jump over next week. I am vexed that I did so, but as I did I will not now propose {{a change in the}} arrangements, as I know how methodical you tremendously old fellows are. That's your secret I suspect.

6000|$|... "What!" [...] exclaimed the Mother; [...] "a whole keg of Nails, <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>age!</b> Why, {{you will}} kill {{yourself}} that way. Go quickly, my child, and swallow a claw-hammer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Jeff, what d'you {{think of}} doing?" [...] asked that austere relative, {{two days after}} the funeral. [...] "Of course <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>age</b> you can't carry on the school alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bless you for that, young 'un," [...] said Marble.

40|$|To my committee, I {{would like}} to express my {{gratitude}} for all you have done. Your constant belief that I could complete this document continually motivated me. Dawn, I greatly appreciate all the extra hours you gave me as we met weekly {{to ensure the quality}} of my dissertation. I know you were extremely busy, but you always had time for me and never rushed our conversations. Without your help this life changing journey would not have been the same. I would to thank my partner, Bernadette, who allowed my doctoral journey to begin by moving across the state in support of my wish to earn this degree. She is the person I have always modeled myself after when I needed extra motivation to just get it done. Also for her willingness to listen when I get on my theoretical tirades that always seem to take it one step too far; her ability to challenge my thought is priceless. As the rock in my life it is a blessing to know she is always in my corner. To my son, Paul Jr., and our future son due in April, I cannot express the motivation you give me <b>at</b> <b>your</b> young <b>age.</b> Every time I sit down to write, I know I am writing to you. Your genuine care for the world gives me hope for the possibilities that are in every child to change the world into a better place. Always remember that loving all people is the key to a happie...|$|R
