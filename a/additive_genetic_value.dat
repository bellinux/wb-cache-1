40|$|One {{specific}} hypothesis {{explaining the}} evolution of extra-pair reproduction (EPR) by socially monogamous females is that EPR is under indirect selection because extra-pair offspring (EPO) sired by extra-pair males have higher <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>value</b> for fitness than the within-pair offspring (WPO) a female would have produced had she solely mated with her socially paired male. This hypothesis has not been explicitly tested by comparing <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>value</b> between EPO and the WPO they replaced. We show that the difference in additive genetic breeding value (BV) between EPO and the WPO they replaced {{is proportional to the}} genetic covariance between offspring fitness and male net paternity gain through EPR, and estimate this covariance with respect to offspring recruitment in free-living song sparrows (Melospiza melodia). Recruitment and net paternity gain showed non-zero additive genetic variance and heritability, and negative genetic covariance. Opposite to prediction, EPO therefore had lower BV for recruitment than the WPO they replaced. We thereby demonstrate an explicit quantitative genetic approach to testing the hypothesis that EPR allows polyandrous females to increase offspring <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>value,</b> and suggest that there may be weak indirect selection against female EPR through reduced <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>value</b> for recruitment of EPO versus WPO in song sparrows...|$|E

A total of 6735 individually tagged fish were tested over a grow-out period of 278 days. Statistical analyses were carried out on 5097 body trait records available at harvest. Across the test environments, the NOVIT 4 strain exhibited the highest <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>values</b> for both growth and survival (19 % and 33 % above the pure strain mean respectively).

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that female extra-pair reproduction in socially monogamous animals reflects indirect genetic benefits requires {{that there be}} additive and/or nonadditive genetic variance in fitness. However, the specific hypotheses that male extra-pair reproductive success (EPRS) shows additive genetic variance (VA), heritability (h(2)), or inbreeding depression, and hence that females could acquire indirect genetic benefits through increased EPRS of sons, have not been explicitly tested. We used comprehensive genetic pedigree data from song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) to estimate V(A), h(2), and inbreeding depression {{in the number of}} extra-pair offspring a male sired per year and the probability that a male would sire any extra-pair offspring per year. Inbreeding depression was substantial: more inbred males sired fewer extra-pair offspring and were less likely to sire any extra-pair offspring. In contrast, estimates of V(A) and h(2) were close to 0, although 95 % credible intervals were relatively wide. These data suggest that females could accrue indirect genetic benefits, in terms of increased EPRS of outbred sons, by mating with unrelated social or extra-pair mates. In contrast, any indirect benefit of extra-pair reproduction in terms of producing sons with high <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>value</b> for EPRS is most likely to be small...|$|E
40|$|The forces {{driving the}} {{evolution}} of extra-pair reproduction in socially monogamous animals remain widely debated and unresolved. One key hypothesis is that female extra-pair reproduction evolves through indirect genetic benefits, reflecting increased <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>value</b> of extra-pair offspring. Such evolution requires that a female's propensity to produce offspring that are sired by an extra-pair male is heritable. However, additive genetic variance and heritability in female extra-pair paternity (EPP) rate have not been quantified, precluding accurate estimation of the force of indirect selection. Sixteen years of comprehensive paternity and pedigree data from socially monogamous but genetically polygynandrous song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) showed significant additive genetic variance and heritability {{in the proportion of}} a female's offspring that was sired by an extra-pair male, constituting major components of the genetic architecture required for extra-pair reproduction to evolve through indirect additive genetic benefits. However, estimated heritabilities were moderately small (0. 12 and 0. 18 on the observed and underlying latent scales, respectively). The force of selection on extra-pair reproduction through indirect additive genetic benefits may consequently be relatively weak. However, the additive genetic variance and non-zero heritability observed in female EPP rate allow for multiple further genetic mechanisms to drive and constrain mating system evolution...|$|E

This information {{can be used in}} a mixed linear model for simultaneous evaluation of fixed effects, gametic effects at the MQTL and additive genetic effects due to quantitative trait loci unlinked to the marker locus (polygenes). An equivalent model can be written at the animal level using the numerator relationship matrix for the MQTL and a method for obtaining the inverse of this matrix is presented. Information on several unlinked marker loci, each of them linked to a different locus affecting the trait of interest, can be used by including an effect for each MQTL. The number of equations per animal in this case is 2 m + 1 where m is the number of MQTL. A method is presented to reduce the number of equations per animal to one by combining information on all MQTL and polygenes into one numerator relationship matrix.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{theory of}} genomic {{selection}} {{is based on}} the prediction of the effects of quantitative trait loci (QTL) in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with markers. However, there is increasing evidence that genomic selection also relies on "relationships" between individuals to accurately predict genetic values. Therefore, a better understanding of what genomic selection actually predicts is relevant so that appropriate methods of analysis are used in genomic evaluations. Methods Simulation was used to compare the performance of estimates of breeding values based on pedigree relationships (Best Linear Unbiased Prediction, BLUP), genomic relationships (gBLUP), and based on a Bayesian variable selection model (Bayes B) to estimate breeding values under a range of different underlying models of genetic variation. The effects of different marker densities and varying animal relationships were also examined. Results This study shows that genomic selection methods can predict a proportion of the <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>value</b> when genetic variation is controlled by common quantitative trait loci (QTL model), rare loci (rare variant model), all loci (infinitesimal model) and a random association (a polygenic model). The Bayes B method was able to estimate breeding values more accurately than gBLUP under the QTL and rare variant models, for the alternative marker densities and reference populations. The Bayes B and gBLUP methods had similar accuracies under the infinitesimal model. Conclusions Our results suggest that Bayes B is superior to gBLUP to estimate breeding values from genomic data. The underlying model of genetic variation greatly affects the predictive ability of genomic selection methods, and the superiority of Bayes B over gBLUP is highly dependent on the presence of large QTL effects. The use of SNP sequence data will outperform the less dense marker panels. However, the size and distribution of QTL effects and the size of reference populations still greatly influence the effectiveness of using sequence data for genomic prediction. </p...|$|E

40|$|Adaptation in {{response}} to selection on polygenic phenotypes may occur via subtle allele frequencies shifts at many loci. Current population genomic techniques are not well posed to identify such signals. In the past decade, detailed knowledge about the specific loci underlying polygenic traits has begun to emerge from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here we combine this knowledge from GWAS with robust population genetic modeling to identify traits {{that may have been}} influenced by local adaptation. We exploit the fact that GWAS provide an estimate of the additive effect size of many loci to estimate the mean <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>value</b> for a given phenotype across many populations as simple weighted sums of allele frequencies. We first describe a general model of neutral genetic value drift for an arbitrary number of populations with an arbitrary relatedness structure. Based on this model we develop methods for detecting unusually strong correlations between genetic values and specific environmental variables, as well as a generalization of $Q_{ST}/F_{ST}$ comparisons to test for over-dispersion of genetic values among populations. Finally we lay out a framework to identify the individual populations or groups of populations that contribute to the signal of overdispersion. These tests have considerably greater power than their single locus equivalents {{due to the fact that}} they look for positive covariance between like effect alleles, and also significantly outperform methods that do not account for population structure. We apply our tests to the Human Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP) dataset using GWAS data for height, skin pigmentation, type 2 diabetes, body mass index, and two inflammatory bowel disease datasets. This analysis uncovers a number of putative signals of local adaptation, and we discuss the biological interpretation and caveats of these results.

40|$|Genetic {{trends for}} growth, feed efficiency, composition, and morphometry of {{carcasses}} were estimated in a French Large White (LW) pig population using frozen semen. Two groups of pigs were produced by inseminating LW sows with either stored, frozen semen from 17 LW boars born in 1977 or with semen from 23 LW boars born in 1998. In each group, 15 males and 90 females were randomly chosen and mated to produce approximately 1, 000 pigs/group. These pigs were performance tested with individual ADFI and serial BW and backfat thickness measurements, slaughtered at 105 kg of BW, and measured for carcass traits. The {{data were analyzed}} using mixed linear animal models, including the fixed effect of the experimental group (offspring of 1977 or 1998 boars), the random effect of the <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>value</b> of each animal, and, when significant, the fixed effects of sex, fattening batch, and slaughterhouse, the linear regression on BW, and the random effect of the common environment of birth litter. For each trait, the genetic trend was estimated as twice the difference between the 2 experimental groups. Results showed moderately favorable trends for on-test ADG (3. 7 +/- 1. 3 g/d per year) and feed conversion ratio (- 0. 014 +/- 0. 005 kg/kg per year) in spite of a tendency toward an increase in ADFI (7. 6 +/- 4. 7 g/yr). A strong reduction in carcass fatness (- 0. 35 +/- 0. 07 mm/yr for carcass average backfat thickness) and a large improvement in carcass leanness (0. 31 +/- 0. 10 mm(2) /yr and 0. 41 perpendicular to 0. 08 %/yr for loin eye area and carcass muscle content, respectively) were observed. Carcass shape measurements (back and leg length, back width, muscle thickness of hind limbs) were not affected by selection. Serial measurements of BW and backfat thickness showed that the major part of the genetic gains occurred during late growth and that the reduction in the backfat layer was more pronounced in the rear than in the front part of the carcass.

Milk score is a subjective measure of milk production used to assess milk production of range ewes when milk yield cannot be quantitatively determined.

Records were grouped according to parity as first, second, and greater (mature), and all records (lifetime). Estimates of heritability for MS were in the range of 0. 05 to 0. 18 for first, 0. 01 to 0. 27 for second, 0. 05 to 0. 10 for mature, and 0. 08 to 0. 13 for all lifetime parity groups. Estimates of genetic correlation between MS at first and second parities ranged from 0. 74 to 1. 00. Similarly, mature MS was highly correlated genetically with MS at first (0. 83 to 1. 00) and at second (0. 60 to 1. 00) parities, suggesting that <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>value</b> for milking ability at maturity could be evaluated as early as at first parity. Heritability estimates for LW ranged from 0. 00 to 0. 18 over all breeds and parity groupings. The genetic correlation between LW at first and second parity groups ranged from 0. 43 to 1. 00. Estimates of genetic correlation between LW at first or second parity with mature LW were mostly high and positive, except for Targhee (− 0. 10) and Polypay (0. 14) at first parity. Litter weight for mature ewes could be improved by selection at first or second parity. Estimates of genetic correlation at first parity between MS and LW were high (1. 00) for Rambouillet and Polypay, and near zero for Columbia and Targhee. At second parity, estimates of genetic correlation between MS and LW were positive and moderate for Rambouillet and Polypay but more variable for Columbia and Targhee. Estimates of genetic correlation between MS and LW were mostly positive and may be favorable with smaller estimates of standard errors using all lifetime records rather than first or second parity records. Although estimates are variable, the average of the estimates of the genetic correlation suggests that LW can be improved by selecting ewes for favorable MS...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Productive traits such as milk {{production}} and fat and protein percentage have economic {{importance in the}} livestock industry. Accurate prediction of breeding value of animals {{is one of the}} best tools available for maximizing response to selection program. It is a fact that the main objective of the breeding program, is to achieve the maximum economic benefit. For breeders of dairy cattle, milk, fat, and protein are the main sources of income that are the most important traits in the firm goals. For evaluating the dairy cattle based on these traits ({{milk production}}, fat, and protein percentage), prediction of breeding values is essential. The present study was performed in order to estimate the genetic and phenotypic parameters and genetic and phenotypic trends of production traits in the Mediterranean climate of Iran (including; Ardebil, Hamadan, East and West Azerbaijan and Zanjan provinces) using 105118 records for Test Day and 30985 records for 305 -day lactation records Related 8808 Herd of first lactation Holstein Cattle calving between 2003 to 2013. All records collected by Animal Breeding Center of Iran. Materials and Methods Records were edited using Fox pro 8. 0 and ACCESS 2010 software and the wrong and unusual records were removed from the dataset. All analyses were performed using the RR (random regression) routine of the WOMBAT software package using AIREML algorithm on Linux operation system. Test day records were analyzed with the following random regression model (RRM) : Where; Pk; kth fixed effect of province, YSl; lth fixed effect of year-season of calving, Yklimnptv; test day record i obtained at dimt of cow p calved at the nth age group in herd-test day m, HTDm; fixed effect of mth herd-test date, Cf; The fth fixed regression coefficient for calving age, agen; The nth calving age, k; The order of fit for fixed regression coefficients (k= 4), βr; The rth fixed regression coefficient, ka; The order of fit for additive genetic random regression coefficients, kp; The order of fit for permanent environmental random regression coefficients, αpr; The rth random regression coefficient of <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>value</b> for pth cow, γpr; The rth random regression coefficient of permanent environmental effect for pth cow, ∅r) dimt (; The rth coefficient of Legendre polynomials evaluated at days in milk t, emnptv; is The residual effect. Results and Discussion The heritability of milk yield, fat percentage, and protein percentage during days 5 to 305 of lactation were 0. 07 to 0. 2, 0. 019 to 0. 041, and 0. 019 to 0. 217, respectively. The repeatability of milk yield, fat percentage, and protein percentage during this period of lactation were 0. 65, 0. 09, and 0. 16, respectively. The study of production traits suggested that during the last 10 years in the Mediterranean climate of Iran, Genetic trend of Milk production was positive, but the genetic trend of fat and protein percentage, negative or zero. Figures 2 and 3 clearly indicate that using both types of records; test day records and 305 -corrected records, genetic trend for milk production compared with fat and protein percentage was positive and increasing. Heritability of production traits in early lactation was low. The great influence of environment on animals and the negative energy balance are the reasons for the low heritability in this period (2). This amount was being increased and reaches its maximum in the second half of lactation. Increased heritability in the second half of lactation is a function of increasing additive genetic variance and sharp decline in the variance of permanent environment. Similar trends for the results of other studies were reported in the country (1, 14). Conclusion Recent studies showed that the accuracy of test day records using random regression method was higher than 305 days lactation records. The results of random regression method and Test Day records showed that the heritability of milk production is the highest and heritability of fat percentage is. Result of this study showed that, during the last 10 years (from 2003 to 2013) in the Mediterranean climate of Iran, Genetic trend was positive in the amount of milk production, but genetic trend of fat and protein percentage, negative or near zero...|$|E
40|$|The {{profitability}} of pig production may be {{expressed as a}} function of reproductivity and productivity. The optimal selection pressure on reproductivity relative to productivity depends on the response to selection and the economic value of the response. Reproductive performance is primarily a function of the dam and involves age at first oestrus, conception rate, litter size and the interval between weaning and oestrus. An increase in the litter size would improve the reproductive performance. Mean litter size has been rather constant in most countries over the last decades. This means that there has been no response to selection or no selection pressure on litter size. It could also imply a relatively deterioration in the environment or negative effects of selection for production characteristics. It has not been established whether selection for litter size is worthwhile. The heritability of the trait, possible selection differential and the economic value of litter size are important components determining the response to selection. Of these, heritability seems to be the major limiting factor. Estimates of this factor have been consistently low (~ 0. 10). A negative correlation between direct genetic and maternal effect might reduce the effective heritability or response to selection. A dam may influence her offspring through the environment she provides as well as through the genes transmitted to the offspring. This environmental effect of the dam on her offspring is referred to as maternal influence. The present study was focussed on the effect of the post-natal maternal conditions on the fertility of the daughter. Maternal influences are partly due {{to the size of the}} litter in which a gilt is raised. Gilts raised in small compared with large litters might produce larger litters. This maternal influence affects h 2 estimated by daughter-dam regression but not h 2 estimated by paternal half sib analysis. It is not clear how important the maternal influence on litter size is. Systematic differences in h 2 estimated by daughter-dam or paternal half sib analysis, have not been found. A negative effect of being raised in large litters on the size of the first litter from gilts raised in large litters was reported (table 2. 6). So maternal effects might counterbalance the response to selection for litter size. The experiments were performed to estimate the effect of standardization level (litter size during the suckling period) on the development of the gilt, age at puberty, size of the first litter and number of corpora lutea after first oestrus of the weaned primiparous sow. The effect of maternal influences on the response to selection was studied by simulation. Three generations of Dutch Landrace gilts were reared. The first generation (192 gilts) was purchased and the litters produced were standardized at 8 piglets within 24 hours of birth. Litters produced by the gilts of generation two were standardized at 6 (low level) or 12 piglets (high level). Thus the effect of the standardization level on production and reproduction traits was measured in gilts of generation three. Gilts were inseminated at a fixed age of approximately 255 days. Growth of litters from birth to weaning at five weeks of age, expressed per piglet, at the high standardization level was 24 % lower than those at the low level. From weaning to 56 days of age the difference was 8 %. This resulted in a weight at 56 days of 15. 8 and 18. 7 kg for gilts raised at the high and low levels respectively. Milk energy intake was ca. 26 % lower for piglets raised in large compared with small litters. The intake of milk and creep feed (ME) from 21 days to weaning was reduced by ca. 19 % (table 5. 1). Relations between intake of milk and creep feed, and growth were stronger at the high than at the low standardization level. Milk production is a limiting factor for growth especially in large litters. The significant weight difference between both standardization level groups at 56 and 74 days of age had disappeared at insemination. At a fixed weight (~ 100 kg) high standardization level gilts deposited more backfat than those standardized at the low level. At the high standardization level 20 % of the gilts that produced a litter did so as a result of insemination at the first oestrus while at the low level this per centage was 49. This result was obtained although the age at first oestrus and conception rate were not affected by the standardization level, and gilts were inseminated at a fixed age. From a total of 111 high and low standardization level gilts which produced a litter, 96 were halothane negative. The estimate of standardization level effect on litter size obtained from halothane negative gilts, after correction for oestrus number at insemination, was - 0. 48 piglets (high-low; table 5. 5). The realized difference in standardization level was 5. 4 piglets which resulted in an estimate of the "m-value", defined by Falconer (1965), of - 0. 09. The coefficient m is the partial regression coefficient of daughters' phenotypic value on mothers' phenotypic value for litter size in the absence of genetic variation among the mothers. This m value can be split into a pre- and a post-natal component m 1 and m 2 (m = m 1 + m 2 ). Uterus weight was higher in low compared with high standardization level sows. The former also tended to have longer uterus horns. A tendency to a higher number of corpora lutea in low than in high standardization level gilts was observed in sows in which oestrus after weaning of the first litter was induced. Results obtained suggest that a low standardization level positively affects weaning weight and development of the uterus. This, in combination with a larger pool of primordial follicles might explain the positive effect on litter size. From a simulation study and derived formulae it was concluded that daughter- dam regression coefficients (trait: first litter size) are seriously biased by pre-and post-natal maternal effects while granddaughter-granddam estimates are biased to a much smaller extent (fig. 5. 5). Standardization of litters will eliminate the post-natal maternal effect as determined by litter size during the suckling period. Maternal influences affect the response to selection in two ways. Firstly the relation between <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>value</b> and phenotypic value will be changed. A value of - 0. 1 or - 0. 2 for m reduced the regression coefficient by 5 and 11 % respectively. Secondly, maternal effects result in an important permanent negative effect on litter size as, in a selection programme for litter size, the next generation of gilts will be born and raised in large litters. Selection of boars only from the largest litters does not result in a permanent negative effect. The reduction of the regression coefficient of <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>value</b> to phenotypic value by maternal effects can be eliminated by correction of the data. For this purpose accurate estimates of m 1 and m 2 are needed. It is doubtful whether this correction is worthwhile as the effect on the regression coefficient and thus on the response to selection is small. Standardization of litters will be more efficient as it also removes the permanent negative effect on litter size as far as is determined by post- natal maternal effects. It cannot be concluded from a negative daughter-dam correlation for number born that selection of replacement gilts born and raised in large litters would not bring about desirable genetic changes in litter size. The value of the regression coefficient of additive to phenotypic value is of significance. Over a range of plausible values for m this regression coefficient, and thus genetic change, decreased by 5 to 10 % due to maternal effects. So the genetic implications of maternal effects on litter size are limited. Selection will result in an additive genetic response. The permanent negative environmental effect on litter size, if replacement gilts are born and raised in large litters, does reduce the phenotypic value. To a large extent, standardization of litters will remove this, from an economic point of view, unfavourable effect. The response to several generations of selection for litter size might be zero because of this permanent negative environmental effect and/or the limited size of the experiment. Selection for fertility is possible but is not always evident because too few animals have been used. Large scale experiments or lines in which litters are standardized are needed to improve litter size or overall reproductive performance by selection. Points of interest for the future are - assessing the economically important components of overall reproductive performance - achieving accurate estimates of genetic and phenotypic correlations and heritabilities involved - combining the sources of information in an index and - assessing an optimal selection scheme. It may be postulated that the rather constant mean litter size over the last decades is probably caused by a low realized selection pressure. A higher selection pressure in combination with more efficient methods (larger scale experiments, standardization of litters, accurate data collection, combining sources of information) practized over a period of 10 years or more will result in a response to selection which is of economic interest...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to estimate the <b>genetic</b> parameters and <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>values</b> in segregating populations of papaya using the mixed model methodology. Two F 2 populations from Tainung and Calimosa hybrids were evaluated. The experimental design was an augmented block with four replicates, and Golden and Calimosa cultivars were the common treatment. Estimates of individual heritability were high for fruit length (FL) and weight (FW), moderate for fruit diameter (FD), and low for total soluble solids (TSS) and fruit firmness (FF). Considering FF and TSS as main traits for selection, genotypes of Calimosa-F 2 population showed better performance to FF, but worse concerning TSS. It was selected 18. 3 % and 24. 6 % of plants from Tainung-F 2 and Calimosa-F 2 populations, respectively. Negative correlation between TSS and FF was not able to reduce the genetic gains. The segregating populations from Calimosa hybrid are more promising for the selection of papaya lines. 201...|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} {{effects of}} genetic and enviromnental factors in producing individual differ-ences in educational achievement are compared across {{women and men}} and over birth cohorts. In a large sample of Australian twin pairs, the heritability of self-reported edu-cational attainment did not vary among women and men born before and after 1950. In a "psychometric " model of twin resemblance, based on separate self-reports in 1981 and 1989, genetic factors explained 57 % of the stable variance in educational achieve-ment, while environmental factors shared by twins accounted for 24 % of the variance. Corrections for phenotypic assortative mating for educational level, however, suggested that estimated common-environmental effects could be entirely explained by the corre-lation between <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>values</b> for mates. Taking this into account, heritability of "true " educational attainment in Australia may {{be as high as}} 82 % with the remaining variation being due to individual environments or experiences.

40|$|W. J. Ewens, {{following}} G. R. Price, has {{stressed that}} Fisher’s fundamental theorem {{of natural selection}} about the increase in mean fitness is of general validity without any restrictive assumptions on the mating system, the fitness parameters, or the numbers of loci and alleles involved, but that it concerns only a partial change in mean fitness. This partial change is obtained by replacing the actual genotypic fitnesses by the corresponding <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>values</b> and by keeping these values fixed in the change of the mean with respect to changes in genotype frequencies. We propose an alternate interpretation for this partial change which uses partial changes in genotype frequencies directly consequent on changes in gene frequen-cies, the fitness parameters being kept constant. We argue that this interpretation agrees more closely with Fisher’s own explanations. Moreover, this approach leads to a decomposition for the total change in mean fitness which explains, unifies, and extends previous decompositions. We consider {{a wide range of}} models, from discrete-time selection models with nonoverlapping generations to continuous-time models with overlapping generations and age effects on viability and fecundity, which is the original framework for Fisher’s fundamental theorem. ] 1997 Academic Pres...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} were to identify superior inbred lines and single-crosses, predict untested hybrids {{and analyze the}} importance of pedigree information and the prediction efficiency. We analyzed 24 experiments in the incomplete block design, including 20 tests of hybrids and 4 tests of inbred lines. The expansion volume (EV) and grain yield were measured in each plot. The analyses were made using ASReml software. Analyses of the general combining ability (GCA) effects and the <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>values</b> of the inbred lines, and the genotypic values of the hybrids in relation to EV showed that no inbred line selection strategy resulted {{in a set of}} clearly superior or inferior inbred lines and hybrids. Including pedigree information resulted in an increase in the variance of the GCA effects in relation to EV and a reduction in relation to yield. For both traits, there was an increase in the variance of the specific combining ability effects. The cross-validation study showed that the prediction of the genotypic value of a hybrid based only on the GCA effects is not efficient in the presence of dominance. With dominance, the efficiency of the hybrid prediction depends on the degree of relationship among the inbred lines. 201...|$|R

The Environment 3 The Environment in Behavioral Genetics Research Traditional behavioral genetic analysis has three types of latent variables: <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>values</b> (A), common environmental <b>genetic</b> <b>values</b> (C), and unique environmental values (E). 1 Neale and Cardon (1992, p. 14) define the unique environment as “all those environmental influences that are so random in their origin, and idiosyncratic in their effects, as to contribute to differences between members of the same family. ” They discuss variable C in the following way (p. 15) : “Any environmental factors that are shared by family members will create differences between families and make family members relatively more similar. The environment between families is sometimes called the shared environment, the common environment, or just the family environment. ” Similar definitions may be found in introductory texts to {{behavioral genetics}} (Carey, 2003; Plomin, DeFries, McClearn, & McGuffin, 2008) as well as more advance...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of litter size and average piglet weight at birth in Landrace and Yorkshire using a standard two-trait mixed model (SMM) and a recursive mixed model (RMM) is presented. The RMM establishes a one-way link from litter size to average piglet weight. It is shown {{that there is}} a one-to-one correspondence between the parameters of SMM and RMM and that they generate equivalent likelihoods. As parameterized in this work, the RMM tests for the presence of a recursive relationship between <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>values,</b> permanent environmental effects, and specific environmental effects of litter size, on average piglet weight. The equivalent standard mixed model tests whether or not the covariance matrices of the random effects have a diagonal structure. In Landrace, posterior predictive model checking supports a model without any form of recursion or, alternatively, a SMM with diagonal covariance matrices of the three random effects. In Yorkshire, the same criterion favors a model with recursion at the level of specific environmental effects only, or, in terms of the SMM, the association between traits is shown to be exclusively due to an environmental (negative) correlation. It is argued that the choice between a SMM or a RMM should be guided by the availability of software, by ease of interpretation, or by the need to test a particular theory or hypothesis that may best be formulated under one parameterization and not the other...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to genetic progress made by selection on <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>values,</b> short-term gains {{can be produced}} by recovering possible inbreeding depression or utilising putative overdominance. These are both caused mainly by dominance genetic variation which can be quantified using mixed model methodology. Inbreeding brings along a requirement for extra parameterisation in expressing and estimating dominance variance. The extra parameters specify how dominance is affecting the mean and (co) variances among inbred animals. The full description for breed crosses contains a very large set of parameters. The benefits from crossbreeding are highest with widely deviating allele frequencies between the breeds. Maximisation of heterosis can be done only on a temporary basis as a continued exploitation leads to stagnation in the overall genetic progress. Therefore efficient methods with immediate returns are needed {{to find the most}} promising breeds jointly with the most potential mating pairs. One possibility is the use of genomic tools in assessing populations for crossbreeding and in searching for major genes mediating dominance variation. The analyses are providing markers {{that can be used in}} choosing mating pairs that produce desirable dominance deviations in analysed marker brackets. Genome-wide marker sets can be used for discovering genome segments with maximum heterosis effect. The phenotypic records are available for such analyses, soon are also the large marker sets and their genotypes: the analytical tools need developers. ...|$|R
