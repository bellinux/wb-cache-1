5|$|In {{addition}} to the regular enemies, the player <b>also</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> defeat several bosses and mini-bosses throughout the game. By defeating enemies, the player gains experience points, which make the hero's level increase; when this happens, the player gets points to spend on four different disciplines, each of which gives the hero access to different abilities and enhances different stats associated with the discipline: Warrior is associated with physical attacks, Monk with defense and health points, Mage with magic attacks and magic points, and Sage {{with an increase in}} the weapon limit gauge. Sometimes when enemies are defeated, they drop items; the player can carry items with them, which are grouped into stacks, each taking up one slot in the inventory.|$|E
5|$|The nuclear {{pores are}} highly {{efficient}} at selectively allowing {{the passage of}} materials {{to and from the}} nucleus, because the nuclear envelope has a considerable amount of traffic. RNA and ribosomal subunits must be continually transferred from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Histones, gene regulatory proteins, DNA and RNA polymerases, and other substances essential for nuclear activities must be imported from the cytoplasm. The nuclear envelope of a typical mammalian cell contains 3000–4000 pore complexes. If the cell is synthesizing DNA each pore complex needs to transport about 100 histone molecules per minute. If the cell is growing rapidly, each complex <b>also</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> transport about 6 newly assembled large and small ribosomal subunits per minute from the nucleus to the cytosol, where they are used to synthesize proteins.|$|E

25|$|A crisis {{assessment}} <b>also</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> {{be completed}} {{which consists of}} gathering information regarding the individual's crisis state, environment, and interpersonal relationships {{in order to work}} towards resolving the current crisis. This step helps facilitate development of an effective and appropriate treatment plan.|$|E
25|$|GWI {{plans to}} {{rationalize}} its tariff system. Any modification in tariffs {{needs to be}} approved by the Public Utilities Commission. In addition, due to the political sensitivity of water tariffs, any modification de facto <b>also</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be approved by Cabinet.|$|E

25|$|Food {{packaging}} {{should no}} longer contain any organic matter (organic matter, if any, needs {{to be placed in}} a biodegradable waste bin or be buried in a garden). Since no trace of biodegradable material is best kept in the packaging before placing it in a trash bag, some packaging <b>also</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be rinsed.|$|E
25|$|A {{chronic disease}} {{in which a}} person craves drinks that contain alcohol and is unable to control his or her drinking.

Alcoholism affects physical and mental health, and can cause problems with family, friends, and work.|$|E
25|$|Morocco faces {{challenges}} on human development outcomes despite progress {{over the past}} decade, in particular. Overall illiteracy rates and gender disparity in access to secondary education remain high and the country continues to suffer poor outcomes on infant and maternal mortality. It <b>also</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> diversify its economy, become more competitive, and integrate further {{into the global economy}} if it is to reach higher growth levels.|$|E

25|$|An orienteering map, and a compass, are {{the primary}} aids for the {{competitor}} to complete an orienteering course of control points as quickly as possible. A map that is reliable and accurate is essential so that a course can be provided which will test the navigational skills of the competitor. The map <b>also</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be relevant {{to the needs of}} the competitor showing the terrain in neither too much nor too little detail.|$|E
25|$|Male mate {{guarding}} behaviour <b>also</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> {{ensure that}} the mate does not leave the mateship as this would lose access to future chances that the male may have to reproduce. Moreover, the male would also lose any maternal efforts that the female would have invested in to any potential offspring. Additionally, access to any social benefits or helping networks that the female brought to the relationship could be lost. Finally, the female could also use information, such as strengths or weakness, about the male to exploit him in the future.|$|E
25|$|It is TGA-labeled for {{migraine}} prevention, also {{in cases}} of neuropathic pain disorders, fibromyalgia and nocturnal enuresis. Amitriptyline is a popular off-label treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), although it is most frequently reserved for severe cases of abdominal pain in patients with IBS because {{it needs to be}} taken regularly to work and has a generally poor tolerability profile, although a firm evidence base supports its efficacy in this indication. Amitriptyline can also be used as an anticholinergic drug in the treatment of early-stage Parkinson's disease if depression <b>also</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be treated. Amitriptyline is the most widely researched agent for prevention of frequent tension headaches.|$|E

25|$|The {{adopted child}} {{can be either}} male or female. The adopted child must fall under the Hindu category. The adoptee <b>also</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be unmarried; however, if the {{particular}} custom or usage is applicable to the involved parties then the adoptee can be married. The child cannot be the age of sixteen or older, unless again it is custom or the usage is applicable to the involved parties. An adoption can only occur {{if there is not}} a child of the same sex of the adopted child still residing in the home. In particular, if a son were to be adopted then the adoptive father or mother must not have a legitimate or adopted son still living in the house.|$|E
25|$|The {{shift to}} an environment-conscious {{approach}} in Morocco {{has brought about}} scores of investment opportunities, most being in the utility and renewable energy industries. In addition to the rise in sales of photovoltaic panels, the business of wind turbines is also surging despite soaring prices on international markets because of the growing demand. To work towards a programme of sustainable development, a number of technological updates need to be made, including improvements to automobiles, the quality of energy products and {{increasing the number of}} renewable energy-producing plants. The government <b>also</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> promote water conservation and efficiency in order to prevent further scarcity. Despite these challenges, Morocco is working to conserve and protect its environment and its efforts were recognised when its Mohammed VI Foundation for Environment won the environmental prize National Energy Globe Award in Brussels in 2007.|$|E
25|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the game is}} to locate the missing parts of the ship's broken intelligence system in order to repair the starship. In order to advance within the game, the player must upgrade from the standard third class level to first class and thus gain access to areas that are restricted when the game begins. The game also requires the player to transport items throughout the ship through the Succ-U-Bus, a system of tubes that transfer objects placed in them {{to other parts of the}} ship; these tubes can be found in many areas of the ship. The player <b>also</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> use the parrot to solve certain puzzles. A talking bomb can be found in the game and unwillingly armed by the player; if that happens, the player has to either disarm it or distract it during countdown to prevent it from exploding.|$|E
