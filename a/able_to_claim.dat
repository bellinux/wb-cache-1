5|$|John {{was the son}} of the {{distinguished}} protostrator Alexios Axouch. The Axouchoi were a prominent family of Turkish origin, which was closely associated with the Komnenian dynasty and provided a number of distinguished generals. The two families also intermarried: John's mother Maria was the daughter of Alexios Komnenos, eldest son and co-emperor of Emperor John II Komnenos (r. 1118–1143). John was thus <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> a pedigree comparable, if not superior, to the reigning Angeloi, albeit from the maternal side.|$|E

5|$|Bhimsen rose {{to power}} by {{initially}} {{serving as a}} bodyguard and personal secretary of King Rana Bahadur Shah. Bhimsen had accompanied Rana Bahadur Shah to Varanasi after his abdication and subsequent exile in 1800. In Varanasi, Bhimsen helped Rana Bahadur engineer his return to power in 1804. In gratitude, Rana Bahadur made Bhimsen a kaji (equivalent to a minister) of the newly formed government. Rana Bahadur's assassination by his step brother in 1806 led Bhimsen to massacre ninety-three people, after which he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> {{the title of the}} mukhtiyar (equivalent to prime minister).|$|E

5|$|The SEAD {{campaign}} was halted, but although the IAF possessed no operational {{answer to the}} massive air defence array forming west of the Canal, it nevertheless still enjoyed supremacy in the air-ro-air arena. On July 30, 69 Squadron took part in Operation Rimon 20, a ruse designed to draw Soviet-flown MiG-21s into battle. In the ensuing dogfight, five Soviet fighters were downed, of which one was shot down by Avihu Ben-Nun with Shaul Levi and another by Aviem Sella with Reuven Reshef. With no side securing a clear advantage, yet both <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> military achievements, American pressure soon bore fruit and a ceasefire marking {{the end of the}} war came into effect on August 7, 1970.|$|E
5|$|Crane later becomes {{suspicious}} when {{he realizes}} the diagram made by Katrina he thought summoned the Horseman is {{really one of}} protection, and also that the corpse of Lady Van Tassel has a wound {{that seems to have}} been caused post-mortem. The corpse is revealed as that of a servant when Lady Van Tassel (Miranda Richardson) emerges alive to ambush Katrina. Lady Van Tassel tells Katrina that her family was driven from their ancestral home by the Van Garretts, who then sold it to the Van Tassels. She proceeded to pledge her soul to Satan and become a witch, summoning the Horseman to kill Van Garrett, his son, new wife, unborn child, and every villager who knew about his new will, marriage, and child, in order to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> everything that she deemed to be rightfully hers uncontested. She then sends the Horseman after Katrina to remove the last obstacle to inheriting the combined Van Garrett and Van Tassel estates.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{following}} week, the Royalist forces held the siege, {{but did not}} engage with the town again until 6 May, when they attacked the town in three places during a thick fog. The defenders were caught out slightly, as many of their soldiers were eating their evening supper. The Parliamentarians rallied quickly, and within an hour had repelled the attack. An account kept by the Lyme Regis garrison records that around one hundred of the besieging army had been killed, while the garrison had only lost one man. The following day, Maurice requested a parley so that the dead could be buried. That request was granted, {{in exchange for the}} town's defenders being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> any weaponry on the battleground. Over the next week, there was little fighting between the armies, and a further seven ships arrived to aid the town, including 240 soldiers from Sir William Waller's army, and on 15 May a further 120 men were sent by the Earl of Warwick.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the passage}} of the Occupiers' Liability Act 1957, the general {{principle}} was that landlords were not liable for injuries suffered by third parties on their property. The 1957 Act qualified this, providing in Section 4 (repealed by the Defective Premises Act) that where a landlord was obligated by his tenant to repair property and he breached this obligation, third parties injured {{as a result of the}} breach would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> providing that the tenant could. This provision was limited; it provided no remedy to the tenant himself, and only applied to lawful visitors, not trespassers. In addition, it only came into effect if the landlord was obliged to repair the property; if he simply had the option to do so, there was no remedy for an injured third party. Similarly, if a tenant failed to inform the landlord of something needing repair, any resulting injury could not be sued upon.|$|E
5|$|Trautloft noticed {{three of}} {{a flight of}} six intercepting Hurricanes of No. 32 {{squadron}} higher than the escorts, attempting to intercept the bombers. Soon {{they were joined by}} four squadrons of British fighters: No. 56 Squadron, No. 111 Squadron, No. 64 Squadron and No. 74 Squadron. Oesau was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> three Spitfires. Two 7./JG 51 aircraft crash landed in France. British losses show that no Spitfire was lost or destroyed in the ensuing battle. Only one No. 32 Hurricane, piloted by Pilot Officer Higgs, was destroyed in a collision with one of the Do 17s and only one other Hurricane was damaged. It is possible Oesau was responsible for damaging Higgs' Hurricane, causing him to lose control. Two Spitfires landed with light damage while a third was also slightly damaged and force-landed at RAF Manston. Over claiming of enemy losses was rife on both sides during the battle.|$|E
5|$|Halotus, as the Emperor's {{official}} taster, {{would probably}} have {{had a role in}} the plot, deceiving Claudius into believing the food was safe to consume. He is a prime suspect because he would have had access to everything eaten by the Emperor on the night of his death. It has been suggested that Halotus may have been the murderer but was working under orders of Agrippina. While it is uncertain whether Halotus would have had anything to gain from the death of the Emperor, Agrippina's political and personal advantage gained by the death of her husband was evident; with Claudius dead, Nero, Agrippina's biological son, would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> the throne. It was also known that the animosity between Agrippina and Claudius had grown during the months preceding the homicide. Other notable suspects included Locusta, a professional poisoner, and Xenophon, Claudius' royal physician, who, in line with the suggestion that the poison was not immediately fatal, is said to have carried an ailing Claudius out of the banquet, taken him to his room and forced a poisoned feather into his mouth on the pretence of encouraging him to regurgitate. Others say Xenophon used poisoned gruel.|$|E

5|$|In 1204, John lost Normandy, Brittany, Maine and Anjou to Philip II of France, leaving English {{power on}} the {{continent}} limited to Gascony and Poitou. John raised {{taxes to pay for}} military campaigns to regain his lands, but unrest grew among many of the English barons; John sought new allies by declaring England a Papal fiefdom, owing allegiance to the Pope. In 1215, John and the rebel barons negotiated a potential peace treaty, the Magna Carta. The treaty would have limited potential abuses of royal power, demobilised the rebel armies and set up a power-sharing arrangement, but in practice neither side complied with its conditions. John and the loyalist barons firmly repudiated the Magna Carta and the First Barons' War erupted, with the rebel barons aided by Philip's son, the future Louis VIII, who claimed the English throne for himself. The war soon settled into a stalemate, with neither side <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> victory. The King became ill and died on the night of 18 October, leaving the nine-year-old Henry as his heir.|$|E
5|$|On 20 February 1942 Finucane flew a two-Spitfire sortie to Dunkirk, France. The {{last few}} days had been {{monotonous}} and Finucane was eager to fly and asked Dick Lewis—a 29-year old Australian who had put his age down so he was accepted for pilot training—to fly as his wingman. At 10:55 GMT Finucane took off and headed over Manston toward France. Off the coast, they strafed a small ship and turned north to return home. Finucane spotted two aircraft taking off from Mardyck but lost sight of them. Both Spitfires dropped to sea level. Minutes later two enemy fighters came towards them. They were identified as Focke-Wulf Fw 190s. The Fw 190 had a higher performance than the Spitfire V in all departments other than turning circle and was more heavily armed. Finucane scored hits on the first Fw 190's wing but the enemy quickly gained the advantage and Finucane's Spitfire was hit with six machine gun rounds which blew a piece of fuselage into the cockpit and into his leg. Blood loss induced dizziness and Lewis protected his leader from six more astern attacks. In the last attack the two Fw 190s came from opposite directions. Lewis was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> one shot down and the other gave up over the mid-Channel. They taxied to 452's dispersal where Finucane passed out after shutting down the engine. On 2 March Finucane went on leave after spending over a week in hospital. No claim or loss was recorded by JG 26, the resident German fighter unit.|$|E
