40|$|Background: Bolivia, {{which is}} the poorest country in South America, is in great need of support from other countries. The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), {{as one of the}} country’s {{external}} contributors, has made plans to contribute to a project named Project 205, involving the introduction of a standardised chart of accounts and improved accounting regulations and institutions. This thesis, which is a proposed advancement of Project 205, focuses on Bolivian small and medium sized companies. Purpose and problem: The main purpose has been to investigate and discuss what would be an appropriate level of mandatory disclosure of accounting information for small and medium sized companies in Bolivia. In order to reach this purpose, the authors have investigated both the demand and supply of accounting information. That is, what accounting information do the most important external users demand from Bolivian small and medium sized companies and what are these companies’ prerequisites to account. Method: In order for the authors to answer the research questions, a field study has been conducted in Bolivia during May and June 2004. In the study, the Bolivian lenders and the state have been considered as the most important external users that hence have been investigated according to their demand for accounting information. Theory has been used to make this selection, along with the selection of what factors to investigate regarding small and medium sized companies prerequisites to account. The selections are explained further in the method chapter. Result, analysis and conclusion: The investigation shows that at present, there is a large gap between the users’ demand for accounting information and the small and medium sized companies’ abilities to present the demanded information. The authors have however concluded that most lenders are willing to lower their demand, given that the small and medium sized companies’ accounting information is supported by a standardised and trustworthy accounting system. The authors think that the financial reports to legally require from the Bolivian small and medium sized companies should be as simple as possible and preferably only consist of <b>a</b> simplified <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>statement</b> and balance sheet and possibly also a basic income statement. The authors have also identified three decisive requisites in order for the new Bolivian accounting system to function. First and far most, the accounting knowledge of small and medium sized companies has to be improved through education, since they today lack both technical and theoretical knowledge of how to account. A control organ is also of great importance in order to guarantee the reliability of the accounting. Ultimately, {{there is a need for}} changing the negative societal attitudes towards accounting in order to impede the enormous informality in the country and the infamous and widespread “double accounting”. The changing of the Bolivian accounting system naturally implies large costs, but the authors believe that these costs, in the long run, will be outweighed by the potential benefits, reason for why this project is considered worthwhile...|$|R

40|$|The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) have {{recently}} proposed to mandate {{the use of}} direct <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>statements</b> {{as part of their}} project to harmonise accounting standards. Despite the magnitude of the proposed change to <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> reporting, to date, the IASB and FASB have provided no empirical evidence under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to support their assertion that direct <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>statements</b> provide financial statement users with useful information. Given the growing evidence that adopting IFRS significantly changes the quality of financial reporting information, the usefulness of direct <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>statements</b> may have also changed. This thesis, therefore, examines the usefulness of reporting direct <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>statements</b> under IFRS in Australia. Australia is specifically examined because {{it was one of the}} few countries where all firms were mandated to report direct <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>statements,</b> and which prohibited the early adoption of IFRS. The findings of this research show that, relative to Australian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (AGAAP), direct <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>statements</b> are more value relevant after the adoption of IFRS. Moreover, the results demonstrate that direct <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>statements</b> provide financial analysts with useful information for their <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> forecasts, and this information is more useful under IFRS compared to AGAAP. Finally, this thesis provides evidence that, while financial analysts use information from direct <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>statements</b> when issuing stock recommendations, buy-and-hold investors are better off identifying mispriced stocks by using analysts’ <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> forecasts in discounted <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> valuation models. In sum, these results provide strong support for the current IASB/FASB proposal to mandate the use of direct <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>statements</b> and are consistent with IFRS improving the information set of investors...|$|R

50|$|In {{financial}} accounting, <b>a</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>statement,</b> {{also known}} as statement of cash flows, is a financial statement that shows how changes in balance sheet accounts and income affect cash and cash equivalents, and breaks the analysis down to operating, investing and financing activities.

The statement captures both the current operating results and the accompanying changes in the balance sheet. As an analytical tool, the statement of cash flows is useful in determining the short-term viability of a company, particularly its ability to pay bills.

40|$|The most {{thoroughly}} debated format {{issue in}} designing <b>a</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>statement</b> {{for a business}} enterprise concerns use ofthe direct or indirectmethod when reporting cash from operating activities. The article argues that {{the reason why we}} cannot solve this dilemma of using the direct or indirect method is related to the fact that our discussion is limited to using the axiom of double-entry bookkeeping within commercial accounting. In this article, however, the discussion of whether to use the direct or indirect method is not limited to commercial double-entry bookkeeping; it is also based upon another accounting framework, specifically designed to deal with cash transactions of governmental organizations: single-entry cameral accounting. The article argues that commercial accounting could learn from cameral accounting, separating cash from non-cash balance sheet changes, and directly prepare <b>a</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>statement</b> from the single-entries of the cash transactions on the cash account, before they are entered into the double-entry bookkeeping system, to provide a performance result (revenues minus expenses) and related balance sheet information (assets, liabilities and equity).
