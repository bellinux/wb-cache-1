5|$|The new {{alignment}} of US-6 was opened on December 30, 1983. The dedication was {{planned for the}} next day, but lines of cars formed at the barricades as soon as news broke that the highway was complete. Some were residents <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the area or visit relatives they had {{not seen since the}} slide; others were truck drivers frustrated by long detours. The Highway Patrol requested the ceremony be canceled and the highway opened early, as they were unable to disperse the crowds.|$|E
5|$|In 1790, {{at the age}} of thirty-one, Wollstonecraft made a {{dramatic}} entrance onto the public stage with A Vindication of the Rights of Men, a work that helped propel the British pamphlet war over the French revolution. Two years later she published what has become her most famous work, A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. <b>Anxious</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the revolution firsthand, she moved to France for about two years, but returned in 1795 after revolutionary violence increased and the lover she met there, American adventurer Gilbert Imlay, abandoned her and their illegitimate daughter, Fanny Imlay. Shortly after her return to Britain, Wollstonecraft attempted suicide in May; Imlay, however, managed to save her.|$|E
5|$|The maximum fine that Landis could impose was $29,240,000. To aid {{the judge}} in {{determining}} the sentence, Landis issued a subpoena for Rockefeller to testify as to Standard Oil's assets. The tycoon had often evaded subpoenas, not having testified in court since 1888. Deputy United States marshals visited Rockefeller's several homes, {{as well as the}} estates of his friends, in the hope of finding him. After several days, Rockefeller was found at his lawyer's estate, Taconic Farm in northwestern Massachusetts, and was served with the subpoena. The tycoon duly came to Landis's Chicago courtroom, making his way through a mob <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the proceedings. Rockefeller's actual testimony, proffered after the judge made him wait through several cases and witnesses, proved to be anticlimactic, as he professed almost no knowledge of Standard Oil's corporate structure or assets.|$|E

Lyons remained <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that Jaguar maintained its own identity and came to resent the association with British Leyland. He was delighted by Sir John Egan's accomplishments and by the new independence arranged in 1984.|$|E
25|$|Michael Shishman and Andronikos III met at Chernomen on the Byzantine–Bulgarian {{border in}} May 1327. Since the {{negotiations}} {{were supposed to}} be secret, they used for pretext the desire of the Byzantine empress Rita of Armenia to meet her daughter Maria Palaiologina, whom she had not seen for 23 years and Andronikos III was allegedly <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his sister as well. John Kantakouzenos, who was present during the negotiations, intentionally concealed their real purpose and described them as a private meeting between relatives and only writes about eight days of rejoicing and feasts.|$|E
25|$|Everyone {{was anxious}} about the divine work, {{including}} the King Indradyumna. After a fortnight of waiting, the King who was <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the deity, could not control his eagerness, and he visited the site where Vishwakarma was working. Soon enough Vishwakarma was very upset and he left the carving of the idol unfinished; the images were without hands and feet. The king was very perturbed by this development and appealed to Brahma to help him. Brahma promised the King that the images which were carved would be deified as carved and would become famous. Following this promise, Indradyumna organized a function to formally deify the images, and invited all gods to be present for the occasion. Brahma presided over the religions function as the chief priest and brought life (soul) to the image and fixed (opened) its eyes. This resulted in the images becoming famous and worshipped at Jagannath Puri in the well known Jagannath Temple as a Kshetra (pilgrimage centre). It is, however, believed that the original images are in a pond near the temple.|$|E

25|$|Unlike his similar {{project at}} Beaulieu Abbey, {{which he had}} also been granted by King Henry, Wriothesley chose to convert the main abbey buildings, {{including}} the church, into his house. It was an imaginative scheme, built {{under the direction of}} master mason Thomas Bartewe, a prominent contractor for King Henry's contemporary fortification works along the South Coast. He constructed a spectacular castellated gatehouse with four octagonal turrets which was forced through the middle of the nave to provide the appropriate seigneurial emphasis needed for a classic Tudor courtyard house. The cloister became the central courtyard of the house (a magnificent fountain was placed in the middle), the old refectory, {{with the addition of a}} grand porch, became the great hall, while the rest of the abbey was turned into fine apartments for the family. The church tower was initially kept as part of the house but it was soon demolished on the advice of John Crayford, one of the king's commissioners who helped to oversee the reconstruction on behalf of Wriothesley. Crayford was <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the tower pulled down as, if it was left standing, the chimneys would have to be raised some twenty feet higher - and at great cost - to avoid defacing the church tower with their smoke. Other features of the mansion included a private indoor theatre and a deer park.|$|E
500|$|The duke {{eventually}} {{lost his}} case in 1891, enabling a further sale {{that had been}} set up by Baron Pichon to proceed. This was to the leading firm of Messrs. Wertheimer of Bond Street in London, where the cup was seen by Augustus Wollaston Franks, who had been Keeper of British and Mediaeval Antiquities and Ethnography at the British Museum since 1866, and was president of the Society of Antiquaries. Samson Wertheimer agreed [...] "with much public spirit" [...] to sell the cup to the British Museum for the £8,000 (£ in [...] ) it had cost the firm. Franks was worried by the new American collectors such as J. P. Morgan, and in 1891 wrote to Sir Henry Tate, of Tate Gallery fame: [...] "A very wonderful gold cup has appeared returned to this country after an absence of 287 years, and I am <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it placed in the National Museum and not removed to America." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewer Alan Sepinwall, on {{his blog}} What's Alan Watching?, praised the {{decision}} to include a multiple-week mystery. He thought that spreading the case out allowed the episode {{to focus on the}} main story arc and Logan's subplot as well as allow the main mystery time to finish. He was also complimentary towards the Logan–Heather plotline, lauding Goglia's performance; he also stated that the episode gave him renewed interest in the Dean O'Dell case. Eric Goldman, writing for IGN, rated the episode a 7.7 out of 10, indicating that it was [...] "good". He was highly critical of the subplot involving Logan and Heather, stating that it [...] "rode the line of insufferable". While opining that it had some good comedic moments, he thought {{that the majority of the}} subplot involved heavy use of clichés. However, he was more mixed to positive towards the case-of-the-week. The reviewer felt a sense of anticipation that this storyline did not resolve itself in the episode: [...] "it's hard not to be <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> where this is going." ...|$|E
