2500|$|Immediately {{after the}} speech MSNBC host Chris Matthews admitted, [...] "I {{have to tell}} you, a little chill in my legs right now. That is an amazing moment in history right there. It is surely an amazing moment. A keynoter like I have never heard." [...] He added later in the night, [...] "...I have seen the first black {{president}} there. <b>And</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> say that is because I think the immigrant experience combined with the African background, combined with the incredible education, combined with his beautiful speech, not every politician gets help with the speech, but that speech {{was a piece of}} work." [...] Commenting the next day, Pat Buchanan, while complimentary towards Obama, was more critical of what he called a centrist speech: [...] "He is hiding what he truly believes. What does Obama believe about this war?" [...] On PBS, columnist David Brooks responded positively, [...] "This is why you go to conventions, to watch a speech like this," [...] while Mark Shields said, [...] "A star is born." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} {{published in the}} alternative weekly Montreal Mirror on June 8, Day addressed some of the perceptions that he was homophobic. He began by denying that he had ever referred to homosexuality as a [...] "mental disorder". He acknowledged having gay staffers working on his campaign: [...] "First of all, {{as far as my}} campaign, I don't ask people if they're homosexual, lesbian or heterosexual. People who are working on my campaign are doing so because they believe in me. That doesn't mean that they necessarily agree 100 per cent with everything I believe. But in principle they're saying we think you can take this Alliance to the next step and we think you'd be good for Canada. So I don't ask. Nobody has to pass a sex test to be on this campaign." [...] But the statement that made headlines in newspapers across the country was Day's acknowledgment that he would indeed consider using the Notwithstanding Clause to block a Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage, then a distinct possibility that was unnerving many social conservatives. After being pressed by journalist Matthew Hays on the Notwithstanding Clause question, Day replied [...] "Yes, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> say that is because such a significant number of constituents would reflect concern on that and would want the discussion. The Alberta position on this is that the definition of marriage changing would allow {{for the use of the}} Notwithstanding Clause. That's because the sense of the elected officials in Alberta is that the people would be significantly motivated on that issue." ...|$|E

2500|$|The two met in {{the semifinals}} of the 1998 US Open, where Sampras was slowed in the third set by a leg injury {{and called for a}} trainer, and Rafter broke Sampras twice in the {{deciding}} fifth set. [...] Sampras's loss denied him the chance to match two records—Jimmy Connors' mark of five U.S. Open titles and Roy Emerson's record of 12 Grand Slam singles titles. Sampras cited a leg injury as the reason Rafter won, an attitude that upset the Australian: [...] "He really does say some funny things at the wrong time", said Rafter, [...] "We are out there busting our guts and he doesn't show a lot of respect {{at the end of the}} day. He tries to play down the reason why he lost, giving no respect to the other player, and that is what really upsets me about him <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> try to piss him off as much as I can." [...] Following Rafter's successful defense of his 1997 U.S. Open title by defeating Mark Philippoussis in the 1998 final, when asked about Sampras' earlier comments about having to win another Grand Slam in order to be considered great, Rafter replied: [...] "Maybe you can ask him that question, if he thinks that now. For me, I won another Slam, and it hasn't sunk in yet. It's very, very exciting for me, especially to repeat it". For his part, Sampras said about Rafter, [...] "When I see him holding the US Open trophy, it pisses me off." [...] Rafter responded by calling Sampras a “cry baby” and saying that it would be better for tennis if someone besides the American were No. 1.|$|E

6000|$|... "It's {{all well}} {{enough for you}} to talk, young man," [...] broke out the farmer, angrily; [...] "it wasn't your four {{thousand}} dollars that was stolen. I wanted that money to pay off the mortgage on this farm. It's due to-morrow, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> wanted cash was because old Grisley insisted on cash and nothing else.

Hang it, make some allowance for the difference of circumstances! Besides, I'm in love, and that alters a man--and, I have heard some people say, not always for the better. Anyhow, I've done it with Farnaby, and it can't be undone. There will be no peace for me now, till I have spoken to Regina. I have read the note you left for me.

He has a family all to himself and should be called a Pika. Some folks do call him that, but more call him a Cony, and some call him the Crying Hare. This is because he uses his voice a great deal, which is something no member of the Hare family does. In size he is just about as big as one of your half-grown babies, Peter, so, you see, he really is a very little fellow. His coat is grayish-brown. His ears are of good size, but instead of being long, are round. He has small bright eyes. His legs are short, his hind legs being very little longer than his front ones. He has hair on {{the soles of his}} feet just like the members of the hare family." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{we have a}} Saying among us, in Defence {{of which}} we must enquire into the proper Sphere of Action which may be {{assigned}} to this Cloven-Foot, as hitherto described: The Proverb is this; Every Devil has not a Cloven-Foot. This Proverb, instead of giving us some more favourable Thoughts of the Devil, confirms what I have said already, that the Devil rais'd this Scandal upon himself; I mean, the Report that he cannot conceal or disguise his Devil's Foot, or Hoof, but that it must appear, under whatever Habit he shews himself; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reason</b> <b>I</b> gave holds good still, namely, {{that he may be}} more effectually conceal'd when he goes abroad without it: For if the People were fully persuaded that the Devil could not appear without this Badge of his Honour, or Mark of his Infamy, take it as you will; and that he was bound also to shew it upon all Occasions, it would be natural to conclude, that whatever frightful Appearances might be seen in the World, if the Cloven-Foot did not also appear, we had no Occasion to look for the Devil, or so much as to think of him, much less to apprehend he was near us; and as this might be a Mistake, and that the Devil might be there while we thought our selves so secure, it might on many Occasions be a Mistake of very ill Consequence, and in particular, as it would give the Devil room to act in the Dark, and not be discover'd, where it might be most needful to know him.|$|E
6000|$|... 136. In {{the midst}} of this desolation we have nothing to count on for real growth but what we can find of honest liking and longing, in {{ourselves}} and in others. We must discover, if we would healthily advance, what things are verily [Greek: timiôtata] among us; and if we delight to honor the dishonorable, consider how, in future, we may better bestow our likings. Now it appears to me, from all our popular declarations, that we, at present, honor nothing so much as liberty and independence; and no person so much as the Free man and Self-made man, who will be ruled by no one, and has been taught, or helped, by no one. <b>And</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> chose a fish for you as the first subject of sculpture, was that in men who are free and self-made, you have the nearest approach, humanly possible, to the state of the fish, and finely organized [Greek: herpeton]. You get the exact phrase in Habakkuk, if you take the Septuagint text,--"[Greek: poiêseis tous anthrôpous hôs tous ichthyas tês thalassês, kai hôs ta herpeta ta ouk echonta hêgoumenon]." [...] "Thou wilt make men as the fishes of the sea, and as the reptile things, that have no ruler over them." [...] And it chanced that as I was preparing this Lecture, one of our most able and popular prints gave me a wood-cut of the 'self-made man,' specified as such, so vigorously drawn, and with so few touches, that Phidias or Turner himself could scarcely have done it better; so that I had only to ask my assistant to enlarge it with accuracy, and it became comparable with my fish at once. Of course it is not given by the caricaturist as an admirable face; only, I am enabled by his skill to set before you, without any suspicion of unfairness on my part, the expression to which the life we profess to think most honorable, naturally leads. If we were to take the hat off, you see how nearly the profile corresponds with that of the typical fish.|$|E
