5|$|A {{music video}} {{was created to}} {{accompany}} the song featuring Gaga. It portrayed her and Knowles {{in a number of}} costumes, brandishing colorful guns towards men and paying homage to the film Reservoir Dogs and pinup legend Bettie Page. It received mixed feedback from critics who called it un-interesting, and felt that it did not present <b>anything</b> <b>new.</b> However, they complimented the costumes and the cinematic homage of the video. The video {{went on to win the}} BET award for Video of the Year.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{positive}} response the game {{would go on}} to receive, Year of the Dragon was developer Insomniac Games' last Spyro title. In an interview, CEO Ted Price said that the company stopped producing the games because they could not do <b>anything</b> <b>new</b> with the character, and that after five years of development on a single series, the team wanted to do something different. Future Spyro games were produced by, among other developers, Digital Eclipse, Equinox Digital Entertainment, Eurocom, Krome Studios, Étranges Libellules, and Tantalus Media.|$|E
5|$|E=MC² was {{generally}} well received by music critics, with many complimenting the record's broad genre influences, and musical and production styles. Some critics, however, {{felt that the}} album was too similar to The Emancipation of Mimi, and didn't offer <b>anything</b> <b>new</b> from the formula. The album debuted at {{number one on the}} US Billboard 200 with opening week sales of 463,000 copies; the highest first-week sales of Carey's career. It opened inside the top-five on the albums chart in Australia, Canada, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The album achieved worldwide sales of over 2.5 million copies.|$|E

The band's lead singer Max Bemis also premiered the song [...] "Crush'd," [...] playing acoustic in studio.|$|R
5|$|Final Destination 3 {{received}} a mixed response; some critics {{felt that the}} film was formulaic and did not bring <b>anything</b> <b>new</b> to the franchise while others praised it for being enjoyable and offering its audience what it wishes to see. Attention was given especially to death scenes involving a tanning bed and a nail gun respectively; these were favorably received, as was Winstead's performance. The film was a financial success and, {{at the time of}} its release, the highest-grossing installment in the franchise. The film was followed by two sequels—The Final Destination and Final Destination 5—released in 2009 and 2011, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Morton {{interviewed about}} 70 {{people who had}} known Madonna since her youth. He had {{to spend a lot}} of evenings in bars and clubs in New York chatting to people—including artists, musicians, and directors—who had an {{interesting}} perspective on Madonna and the world. After its release, Madonna received mixed reviews from contemporary critics, who pointed out Morton's poor writing skills and felt that the book did not present <b>anything</b> <b>new</b> about the singer. The book was a commercial disappointment. In the United States, the book reached eight on The New York Times Best Seller list, and sold half of its initial print.|$|E
5|$|Origins was {{developed}} by the United Kingdom branch of Climax Studios, after it was transferred from the United States branch, who faced issues with the game engine and the vision of the game; the script, monsters, and level design were redone, and aspects of Origins atmosphere and gameplay intentionally replicated those of the first Silent Hill game. Origins was generally positively reviewed, although some reviewers wrote that it followed the formula of the series too closely and failed to add <b>anything</b> <b>new.</b> Its PlayStation 2 port received a lower aggregate score, with criticism directed towards its visuals.|$|E

5|$|The 75-minute film premiered at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival {{before its}} {{television}} premiere on Animal Planet on May 25, 2008. While it was praised for its cinematography, {{for maintaining the}} depth of coverage of the television series, and for its accessibility to newcomers to the series, it was criticized for not offering <b>anything</b> <b>new</b> to fans. The Kalahari Meerkat Project noted that the film was not completely accurate but praised it overall and recommended against analyzing it. Several reviewers praised Goldberg's narration, but the script was criticized as being too simplistic for adult viewers.|$|E
5|$|Consisting of six chapters, Madonnaland finds Simone visiting Madonna's birthplace, Bay City, Michigan, {{where she}} spoke with the local people about the singer. The book also {{analyses}} Madonna's career and fame, with the author delving into her own music career and obscure Bay City bands. Simone had been initially commissioned to write a new biography about the singer. However, due to already available excess content on her, the author felt {{she would not be}} able to find <b>anything</b> <b>new.</b> Instead, she ended up writing Madonnaland about her own failure to create a Madonna biography, why Bay City did not have any commemoration for the singer, as well as unknown music bands, pop culture and celebrity life.|$|E
25|$|Two rings R, S {{are said}} to be Morita {{equivalent}} if the category of left modules over R is equivalent to the category of left modules over S. In fact, two commutative rings which are Morita equivalent must be isomorphic, so the notion does not add <b>anything</b> <b>new</b> to the category of commutative rings. However, commutative rings can be Morita equivalent to noncommutative rings, so Morita equivalence is coarser than isomorphism. Morita equivalence is especially important in algebraic topology and functional analysis.|$|E

On 23November/ 3December 1629O.S./N.S. the subdelegates returned to Himmelpforten and interrogated the conventuals as to alienations of convent possessions, but without learning <b>anything</b> <b>new.</b> Then the conventuals {{were ordered to}} the abbey quire to acknowledge the seizure of the convent by the Restitution Commission. They were told, that those who would convert to Catholicism until Christmas 1629, would be granted a lifelong annuity, whereas the others would lose their sustenance by Easter 1630 (i.e. 31 MarchN.S.).|$|E
25|$|According to the {{doctrine}} of the Roman Catholic Church, the era of public revelation ended with the death of the last living Apostle. A Marian apparition, if deemed genuine by Church authority, is treated as private revelation that may emphasize some facet of the received public revelation for a specific purpose, but it can never add <b>anything</b> <b>new</b> to the deposit of faith. The Church may pronounce an apparition as worthy of belief, but belief is never required by divine faith. The Holy See has officially confirmed the apparitions at Guadalupe, Saint-Étienne-le-Laus, Paris (Rue du Bac, Miraculous Medal), La Salette, Lourdes, Fátima, Pontmain, Beauraing, and Banneux.|$|E
25|$|Some items, such as {{clothes and}} children's toys, often become {{unwanted}} before they wear out due {{to changes in}} their owner's needs or preferences; these can be reused by selling or giving them to new owners. Regiving can take place informally between family, friends, or neighbours, through environmental freecycling organisations or through anti-poverty charities such as the Red Cross, United Way, Salvation Army, and Goodwill which give these items to {{those who could not}} afford them new. Other organizations such as iLoveSchools have websites where both new and used goods can be offered to any of America's school teachers so their life can be extended and help schoolchildren. The average American, for example, throws away 67.9 pounds of used clothing and rags. With the U.S. population at approximately 296 million people, that translates into 20 billion pounds of used clothing and textiles that are tossed into the landfills each year. This has partly motivated movements such as The Compact, whose members promise not to buy <b>anything</b> <b>new</b> for a year, and rely on reusing items that otherwise would be thrown away. Reuse not only reduces landfill inline with the waste minimization program but can help raise money for a good cause.|$|E

Roger assured her that there was no possibility of giving a dance without them, and Jessie seconded him as much as she ventured; but Mrs. Langford was unpersuadable, declaring that she would have no such things in her house. Young people in her days were contented to dance country dances; if they wanted <b>anything</b> <b>newer,</b> they might have quadrilles, but as to these new romps, she would not hear of them.|$|R

500|$|The review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes {{reported}} that 44% of critics gave the film positive feedback, based on 221 reviews, with the critical consensus reading, [...] "While Ben Affleck fits {{the role and}} the story is sporadically interesting, Daredevil is ultimately a dull, brooding origin story that fails to bring <b>anything</b> <b>new</b> to the genre."
