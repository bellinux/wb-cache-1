5|$|In 1960 Y.C. Liu, <b>a</b> <b>colleague</b> <b>of</b> Walter Simon's at SOAS, {{published}} Fifty Chinese Stories. These {{selections from}} classical texts {{were presented in}} both classical and modern Chinese, together with GR romanizations and romanized Japanese versions prepared by Simon (by that time Professor Emeritus of Chinese in the University of London).|$|E
5|$|Scalia {{enjoyed a}} warm {{relationship}} with fellow Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, considered {{a member of}} the court's liberal wing, with the two attending the opera together and even appearing together onstage as supernumeraries in Washington National Opera's 1994 production of Ariadne auf Naxos. Ginsburg was <b>a</b> <b>colleague</b> <b>of</b> Scalia's on the D.C. Circuit, and the Scalias and the Ginsburgs had dinner together every New Year's Eve.|$|E

5|$|Before {{creating}} Shaman King, Takei, {{an assistant}} of Nobuhiro Watsuki's Rurouni Kenshin, exchanged {{ideas about the}} series with the other assistants. As <b>a</b> <b>colleague</b> <b>of</b> Watsuki, he worked primarily as a manga assistant, only focusing on his own projects during his days off. He was influenced by street art from hip-hop and rap culture, which is apparent in his manga artwork. For drawing, he used calligraphy inks and pen nibs. When illustrating, he used Copic brand color markers.|$|E
5|$|Detectives also {{investigated}} {{the death of}} a woman who had been <b>a</b> <b>colleague</b> <b>of</b> Smith at the Rainbow. Patricia Lynott, a divorced mother of two from Ireland who had moved to Birmingham, had been found dead in her flat in October 2000. Police had not treated the death as suspicious, but after they discovered her connection to Smith, her body was exhumed for a second post mortem. This proved to be inconclusive, and in January 2003 a coroner's jury in Birmingham recorded an open verdict after hearing that the cause of her death could not be determined.|$|E
5|$|In 1937 Reich {{began an}} affair with a female patient, an actress who had been married to <b>a</b> <b>colleague</b> <b>of</b> his. According to Sigurd Hoel, the {{analysis}} would stop because of the relationship, then the relationship would end and the analysis would start up again. The patient eventually threatened to go to the press, but was persuaded that it would harm her as much as it would Reich. Around the same time, Reich also had {{an affair with}} Gerd Bergersen, a 25-year-old Norwegian textile designer.|$|E

5|$|Poliphilus {{is named}} after the book Hypnerotomachia Poliphili, one of Manutius's most famous books in the Latin alphabet, which was printed with the same roman as De Aetna but recut capitals; it was made for the Medici Society, who planned to create an English translation. Blado {{is named after}} the printer Antonio Blado, <b>a</b> <b>colleague</b> <b>of</b> Arrighi. Morison {{preferred}} Bembo's roman and was somewhat dismissive of Poliphilus. Unlike Bembo, both in metal featured a Greek-influenced Y with a curving head, as in the original.|$|E
5|$|There {{were several}} {{bystanders}} {{who witnessed the}} murder and managed to see {{the faces of the}} assassins, including Juan Manuel Bautista, <b>a</b> <b>colleague</b> <b>of</b> Buendía; Rogelio Barrera Galindo, a man who had parked his vehicle close to the journalist's; and Felipe Flores Fernández, a bus driver. Among the first to arrive at the murder scene was José Antonio Zorrilla Pérez, then-head of the Federal Security Directorate (DFS), Mexico's equivalent of the FBI, and one of Buendía's main sources for his political publications. Photos of Buendía's corpse circulated across Mexico {{and the rest of the}} world.|$|E
5|$|After a rough {{position}} of the burst had been determined, Enrico Costa of the BeppoSAX team contacted astronomer Dale Frail at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory's Very Large Array. Frail began making observations at a wavelength of 20centimeters at 01:30UTC, less than four hours after the discovery. While preparing for his observations Frail contacted astronomer Stanislav Djorgovski, who was working with the Hale telescope. Djorgovski immediately compared his images of the region with older images from the Digitized Sky Survey, but he found no new sources of light within the error box. Mark Metzger, <b>a</b> <b>colleague</b> <b>of</b> Djorgovski at the Caltech observatory, conducted a more extensive analysis of the data, but was also unable to identify any new light sources.|$|E

5|$|Manne's {{father and}} uncles were drummers. In his youth he admired {{many of the}} leading swing drummers of the day, {{especially}} Jo Jones and Dave Tough. Billy Gladstone, <b>a</b> <b>colleague</b> <b>of</b> Manne's father and the most admired percussionist on the New York theatrical scene, offered the teenage Shelly tips and encouragement. From that time, Manne rapidly developed his style in the clubs of 52nd Street in New York in the late 1930s and 1940s. His first professional job with a known big band was with the Bobby Byrne Orchestra in 1940. In those years, as he became known, he recorded with jazz stars like Coleman Hawkins, Charlie Shavers, and Don Byas. He also worked {{with a number of}} musicians mainly associated with Duke Ellington, like Johnny Hodges, Harry Carney, Lawrence Brown, and Rex Stewart.|$|E
5|$|Recruited {{by several}} firms in 1975, Romney joined the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), {{reasoning}} that {{working as a}} management consultant {{for a variety of}} companies would better prepare him for a future position as a chief executive. Part of a 1970s wave of top graduates who chose to go into consulting rather than join a large company directly, he found his legal and business education useful in his job. He applied BCG principles such as the growth-share matrix, and executives viewed him as having a bright future there. At the Boston Consulting Group, he was <b>a</b> <b>colleague</b> <b>of</b> Benjamin Netanyahu, with whom he formed a friendship that has lasted for more than forty years.|$|E
5|$|Richard {{was born}} in Normandy and became a monk at Canterbury, and a {{chaplain}} to Theobald of Bec, the Archbishop of Canterbury. At some point, he received an education, {{but it is not}} known where or who he studied with. The first notice of him in history is as a monk at Christ Church. He was <b>a</b> <b>colleague</b> <b>of</b> Thomas Becket while they both worked for Theobald. In 1157 he was appointed prior of St. Martin's priory in Dover. St. Martin's was a Benedictine priory and a dependent house of Christ Church Cathedral Priory in Canterbury, the cathedral chapter of the archbishops of Canterbury. Right before Becket's death Richard was employed by Becket to meet with Henry the Young King, but was unsuccessful in the attempt. After Becket's death, Richard took charge of Becket's body, and arranged for an immediate burial in Canterbury Cathedral.|$|E

5|$|George {{returns to}} Paris and learns from Andre Lobineau, <b>a</b> <b>colleague</b> <b>of</b> Nicole's, that Montfauçon is a {{location}} in Paris. Flap and Guido attempt {{to steal the}} tripod from the museum; but they are beaten to the theft by Nicole, who gives the artifact to George. In the sewers of Montfauçon, George spies on a secret meeting of people who {{claim to be the}} Templars, and he learns of their plan to find the Sword of Baphomet. After the group leaves, George uses the tripod and gem in the underground chamber to reveal the name of a village in Syria: Marib. He travels to the village and discovers that Khan has been looking for him. At a nearby rock formation called the Bull's Head, George finds a lens and deduces that it is represented on the manuscript as a crystal ball. He also discovers an idol with three bearded faces, Baphomet; and a Latin inscription that describes Britain. Khan arrives and holds George at gunpoint, but George manages to escape.|$|E
5|$|Stories for {{the show}} were often co-written by Burns, who also became a {{producer}} in the show's fourth season. Other writers include three acclaimed crime fiction writers from outside of Baltimore: George Pelecanos from Washington, Richard Price from the Bronx and Dennis Lehane from Boston. Reviewers drew comparisons between Price's works (particularly Clockers) and The Wire even before he joined. In addition to writing, Pelecanos served as a producer for the third season. Pelecanos has commented that he was attracted to the project because {{of the opportunity to}} work with Simon. Staff writer Rafael Alvarez penned several episodes' scripts, as well as the series guidebook The Wire: Truth Be Told. Alvarez is <b>a</b> <b>colleague</b> <b>of</b> Simon's from The Baltimore Sun and a Baltimore native with working experience in the port area. Another city native and independent filmmaker, Joy Lusco, also wrote {{for the show}} in each of its first three seasons. Baltimore Sun writer and political journalist William F. Zorzi joined the writing staff in the third season and brought a wealth of experience to the show's examination of Baltimore politics.|$|E
