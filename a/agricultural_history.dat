25|$|As Sydney rapidly expanded, {{following}} World War II, Carlingford underwent rapid urbanisation. James Ruse Agricultural High School, {{established in}} 1959, {{is a testament}} to the <b>agricultural</b> <b>history</b> of Carlingford as well as the rapid pace of urbanisation; which soon made the school, and its large farm, somewhat of an anomaly amongst the 1970s and 1980s housing which dominate the suburb. More recently, in the 1990s, the government policy of urban consolidation has seen the development of high-density units and apartment blocks around the town centre and the train station. There have also been redevelopments of older houses into medium-density townhouses, and duplex housing.|$|E

40|$|In this provocative, well-written {{extended}} essay, {{based on}} unusually keen {{reflections on the}} major secondary literatures on race relations in South Africa and in the southern United States, rather than on an independent examination of primary documents, British Empire specialist John W. Cell takes issue with several recent interpretations, including that of George M., Fredrickson's White Supremacy (1981). Racial segregation in both countries, Cell argues, was not primarily an outgrowth of their slave or frontier or <b>agricultural</b> <b>histories.</b> Rather, their self-conscious, formalized systems of discriminatory racial separation crystallized relatively suddenly after 1890 in the United States and after 1905 in South Africa; flourished in the "modern" urban and industrial, rather than the "traditional" agrarian, sector of society; were imposed by political, not social or economic, means; represented responses to political or economic threats or potential threats by persons of color, rather than mere legalizations of their already deprived socioeconomic status; and were fostered largely by white moderates, not extremists...|$|R
5000|$|The rising {{popularity}} of organic foods also raises important questions {{of interest to}} governments of different countries. Some research also states that people have a preference for buying organic food {{due to the fact}} that they believe it is stimulating the local economy. Demographic and <b>agricultural</b> <b>histories,</b> as well as governmental procedures, are fundamental to understanding recent food system localization practices. The growing recognition of the significance of local food and agriculture has raised considerable interest in farmers and consumers attempting to challenge global food systems. Much of the emphasis in new local food policy initiatives has combined specialty products from local farms with organic and ecological products. The turn to local food may cover many different forms of agriculture, encompassing a variety of consumer motivations and giving rise to a wide range of political changes, much as the laissez-faire economics of the nineteenth century prompted various responses with resistance to contemporary globalization.|$|R
