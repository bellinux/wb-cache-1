25|$|Vectors are {{fundamental}} {{in the physical}} sciences. They {{can be used to}} represent any quantity that has magnitude, has direction, and which adheres to the rules of vector addition. An example is velocity, the magnitude of which is speed. For example, the velocity 5 meters per second upward could be represented by the vector (0,5) (in 2 dimensions with the positive y axis as 'up'). Another quantity represented by a vector is force, since it has a magnitude and direction and follows the rules of vector addition. Vectors also describe many other physical quantities, such as linear displacement, displacement, linear acceleration, angular acceleration, linear momentum, and angular momentum. Other physical vectors, such as the electric and magnetic field, are represented as a system of vectors at each point of a physical space; that is, a vector field. Examples of quantities that have magnitude and direction but fail to follow the rules of vector addition: <b>Angular</b> <b>displacement</b> and electric current. Consequently, these are not vectors.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a system and method for correction of relative <b>angular</b> <b>displacements</b> between an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and its onboard strap-down photoelectric platform to improve localization accuracy. Because the <b>angular</b> <b>displacements</b> {{have an influence}} on the final accuracy, by attaching a measuring system to the platform, the texture image of platform base bulkhead can be collected in a real-time manner. Through the image registration, the displacement vector of the platform relative to its bulkhead can be calculated to further determine <b>angular</b> <b>displacements.</b> After being decomposed and superposed on the three attitude angles of the UAV, the <b>angular</b> <b>displacements</b> can reduce the coordinate transformation errors and thus improve the localization accuracy.

40|$|Background: Arm swing during gait {{is usually}} neglected, {{as it is}} not an {{essential}} component of walking that it spontaneously occurs, so there are doubts if it affects gait or not. The upper limb in hemiplegic cerebral palsy is more involved than the lower limb. The aim {{of this study was to}} enhance swinging of arm by using arm cycling and assess its impact on both upper and lower limb joints’ <b>angular</b> <b>displacements</b> during gait cycle of children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy. Methods: Forty-eight hemiplegic cerebral palsy children participated in this study (18 boys, 30 girls) with an average age of 5. 1  ±  0. 87  years. Children were randomly assigned to two groups, study group (A) and control group (B). The study group received arm cycling in addition to gait training exercise, while the control group received gait training exercises only. Three dimensional (3 D) motion analysis was used before and after the training program to evaluate the <b>angular</b> <b>displacements</b> of shoulder, elbow, hip, knee, and ankle joints during gait sub phases. Results: Results showed a significant improvement (p <  0. 05) in arm swing. Improvement was manifested by decreasing flexion <b>angular</b> <b>displacements</b> of shoulder and elbow joints. Also there was a significant increase (p <  0. 05) in flexion <b>angular</b> <b>displacements</b> of the hip and ankle joints during gait cycle. Conclusion: Using arm cycling exercise is an effective method for improving both arm swing and leg <b>angular</b> <b>displacements</b> during gait of hemiplegic children...|$|R

The multi-aspect scattered waves from a given target are modeled with a hidden Markov model (HMM).

The search strategies are detailed and example results presented on adaptive classification and detection of underwater targets. 1...|$|R
