40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to derive some economic indicators which can help in explaining the effect of government policies on sugar imports. The paper developed and statistically estimated an import demand function for sugar with the aim of providing quantitative estimates of the response of imports to the changing government policies. The results show that the factors which significantly affect sugar imports are: (1) the traditional non-policy variables: deflated imported price of sugar, and real income per capita. (2) the policy variables: deflated import subsidy, and year-ending stock. The estimated elasticities of deflated imported price, real income per capita, deflated import subsidy, and the ending stock are: - 0. 94, 1. 30, 0. 10, and - 0. 31 respectively. Results of the simulation assuming a 30 % increase in international price of sugar show that <b>annual</b> <b>quantity</b> of imported sugar in the 1991 - 1995 period will be 408578, 317712, 388722, 412896, 451686 ton, respectively. This projected <b>annual</b> <b>quantity</b> of imports is considered to be fairly sufficient, and their is no need for the government to grant the importers any subsidy...|$|R
