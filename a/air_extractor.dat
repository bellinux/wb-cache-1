2500|$|Mechanically the 2010 Shelby GT500 remains {{closely related}} to the 2007–2009 GT500, but the 2010 model has been {{upgraded}} with various features similar to or found in the 2008 Shelby GT500KR. A conical cold air intake and other enhancements to the GT500's supercharged 5.4L DOHC V8 have resulted in an increase in output to @6200rpm and @4500rpm, gains of 40hp and 30lb·ft of torque over the 2007–2009 GT500 respectively. The Tremec TR-6060 6-speed manual transmission returns for the 2010 GT500 but has been enhanced with larger clutch discs ( [...] versus the [...] discs used previously) and other measures to increase performance and noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) control. Additionally, the fifth and sixth gear ratios of the transmission have been changed from 0.80 to 0.74 and 0.63 to 0.50 respectively, contributing to an improvement in fuel efficiency that the 2010 GT500 enjoys over its predecessor. Complementing the transmission's gear ratio changes is a new, more aggressive 3.55:1 ratio rear axle which replaces the 3.31:1 axle used previously. According to Inside Linei drivers of the new 2010 Shelby can expect 0 to 60 times in 4.3 seconds from a stand still and 4 seconds flat with roll out. Elsewhere, the GT500's aluminum hood, in addition to be stylistically {{different from that of the}} Mustang and Mustang GT, features an <b>air</b> <b>extractor</b> that helps cool the engine. Various aerodynamic upgrades, such as the design of the front fascia and the aforementioned Gurney Flap spoiler, contribute to increased downward force and a reduced coefficient of drag. Suspension enhancements found in the GT500KR are used in the 2010 GT500 to improve handling and, specifically, provide better roll control. The 2010 GT500 features Ford's AdvanceTrac traction and stability control system standard with different settings to control the level of performance the driver desires.|$|E
50|$|The Ro 80 {{remained}} largely unchanged over its ten year production. From September 1969 the rectangular headlights were replaced with twin halogen units, and <b>air</b> <b>extractor</b> vents {{appeared on the}} C-pillar behind the doors. In August 1970 a slightly reshaped plastic grill replaced the metal grill of the early cars, and a minimal facelift in May 1975 saw the final cars getting enlarged rear lights and rubber inserts in the bumpers which increased the car's overall length by 15 mm to 4795 mm.|$|E

The front grill vents are removed and larger, free flowing <b>air</b> <b>extractors</b> sit on the hood and flank {{the side of the}} car. The rear now has a racing wing and diffuser.|$|R
2500|$|The {{proposed}} {{model was}} a true 2+2 (two front bucket seats plus limited use seats for two back passengers) sleek, steel-blue convertible with a long hood and a short, stubby rear deck. The XR-400's long [...] Ambassador wheelbase and truncated overhangs gave it athletic proportions, while the top-up appearance suggested a close-coupled two-seater sports car. Classic sports car touches included a hood line that slopped lower than the front fenders, doors that had a dip in their top, and simulated <b>air</b> <b>extractors</b> behind the front wheels.|$|R
50|$|Although the Jetstar I was priced {{similar to}} the Grand Prix, unless one bought the basic model there was little {{incentive}} for an Oldsmobile buyer to purchase a one over the Starfire. Adding power steering ($107), power brakes ($43), and automatic transmission ($242.10) - all standard on the Starfire - brought the Jetstar I's $3602 base price within $150 of the $4,148 Starfire, without its genuine leather interior and distinctive exterior trim. On the other hand, the performance-minded could elect the comparatively plain Jetstar I and its faux <b>air</b> <b>extractors</b> behind the front wheels.|$|R
50|$|The second {{generation}} CTS was wider and {{longer than the}} original, measuring 191.6 in long, 72.5 in wide and 58 in in height. Wheelbase remained unchanged at 113.4 in, but with a wider front/rear track of 61.8 / 62.0 inches (1575 / 1585 mm), donated by the larger STS. Other changes included a revamped exterior, with a new, larger grille, slimmer headlights and taillights, side <b>air</b> <b>extractor</b> vents located forward of the front doors, and new nine-spoke 18-inch wheels, surrounding larger high-performance brake calipers and rotors. Available features on the second-gen CTS included a Bose 5.1 surround sound system, GM's Stabilitrak ESC system, a tire pressure monitoring system, a navigation system with real-time traffic and weather data, an integrated 40 GB hard drive for music storage, swiveling headlights, and remote starting.|$|E
5000|$|Opel {{also offered}} a two-door Kadett coupé with reduced {{headroom}} for the passengers in the rear. The coupé body introduced in 1965 included a thick C-pillar with reduced side-windows between the C-pillar and the B-pillar. The thick C-pillar incorporated three prominent <b>air</b> <b>extractor</b> slots {{reminiscent of the}} gills on a fish, {{as a result of}} which this coupé acquired the soubriquet [...] "Kiemencoupé" [...] (gills coupé). A coupé body with larger side windows for the passengers in the back appeared in 1967 identified as the [...] "Coupé F", initially only on the more lavishly equipped cars, but from 1971 all Kadett B coupés used the newer body. The newer Coupé, with an increased quantity of glass, was slightly heavier than the [...] "gills-coupé" [...] as well as being less aerodynamically efficient, leading to a small reduction in claimed top speed.|$|E
5000|$|Bob Marcks, {{who later}} {{worked as a}} {{designer}} and product planner at Chrysler, commented in a 1970s interview that the general feeling shared by both designers and management was that Studebakers cars needed to project a more upscale image. To do this on Studebakers limited budget, the designers chose colors and upholstery materials comparable to those seen in Cadillacs and Lincolns, rather than the plainer variety that one might expect in a lower-priced car. The tasteful nylon brocade upholstery with contrasting-color vinyl trim that was standard in the Cruiser particularly reflected this philosophy.Studebakers final engineering innovation, flow-through [...] "Refreshaire" [...] ventilation with <b>air</b> <b>extractor</b> vents integrated into the taillamp assemblies, debuted on the 1966 models to wide acclaim. Refreshaire virtually eliminated the need for opening the vent windows in the front doors. In fact, the Cruiser, which had, since its 1961 introduction, been equipped with opening rear-door vent windows, lost that feature {{with the advent of}} Refreshaire.|$|E
50|$|The {{new version}} Cup of the GTV 3.0 24 valves was tested {{on the track}} at Varano. The car was {{prepared}} following the rules set up by Gruppo N (production vehicles with slight improvements), {{even though they are}} exclusively approved for mono-make races. Externally the GTV 3.0 Cup is recognisable for the presence of the aerodynamic kit, also available for the commercial series: back and front spoilers and lateral <b>air</b> <b>extractors</b> in the front wings. The whole suspension is lowered by a few centimetres and fitted with ‘slick’ or ‘rain’ Michelin racing tyres. In spite of the safety measures, the weight has been reduced by another 200 kilos. The mechanics remain the same as the commercial series, but with different regulations in the electronic chip and suspension, to gain a little more horsepower and better transfer them onto the road.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Relative {{to other}} western nations, {{there is a}} paucity of {{information}} on indoor air organic pollutants in Australia. While some data {{are available on the}} indoor levels of volatile organic compounds in Australian dwellings, corresponding information on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons levels is scarce. Therefore, this paper reports the results of the characterisation and quantification of airborne polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds in non-industrial environments in an Australian city. The most abundant and most frequently encountered compounds include, nonanal, decanal, texanol, acetone, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, toluene, hexanal, ethyl benzene, the xylenes and C 3 -benzene. The distribution of these and other compounds found in the buildings have been rationalised in terms of indoor activities and the building characteristics (distance from a major roads, floor materials, use of <b>air</b> <b>extractors</b> etc). In addition, multi-criteria decision making procedures have been employed to rank the buildings on the basis of forty indoor air quality-influencing variables. This approach offers a useful tool that could facilitate the identification of environments requiring attention, and assist the formulation and prioritisation of control strategies...|$|R
40|$|Background: Mumbai has a {{population}} of 21 million, and an increasingly recognised epidemic of drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB). Objective: To describe TB infection control (IC) measures implemented in households of DR-TB patients co-infected with the human immunodeficiency virus(HIV) under a Médecins Sans Frontières programme. Methods: IC assessments were carried out in patient households between May 2012 and March 2013. A simplified,standardised assessment tool was utilised to assess the risk of TB transmission and guide interventions. Administrative, environmental and personal protective measures were tailored to patient needs. Results: IC assessments were carried out in 29 houses. Measures included health education, segregating sleeping areas of patients, improving natural ventilation by opening windows, removing curtains and obstacles to air flow, installing fans and <b>air</b> <b>extractors</b> and providing surgical masks to patients for limited periods. Environmental interventions were carried out in 22 houses. Conclusions: TB IC could be a beneficial component of a comprehensive TB and HIV care programme in households and communities. Although particularly challenging in slum settings, IC measures that are feasible, affordable and acceptable can be implemented in such settings using simplified and standardised tools. Appropriate IC interventions at household level may prevent new cases of DR-TB, especially in households of patients with a lower chance of cure...|$|R
50|$|The Diablo GT was noticeably {{different}} on the exterior. While previous Diablo models had differed one from another with subtle fascia refinements or {{changes in the}} brake cooling ducts, the Diablo GT opted for an all new black carbon fiber front air dam with large brake ducts and a central vent for the oil cooler (the car still featured driving lamps, the single pair of round units featured on the Diablo VT Roadster). In the front luggage compartment lid, a large <b>air</b> <b>extractor</b> was added, while the small corner vents on the front fenders were changed to NACA style ducts. The fenders themselves were widened to accommodate a wider front track. In the rear, the bumper and its lamps were removed entirely, replaced by a carbon fiber diffuser that forced the fog and backup lamps into the outer pair of tail lamps, and shielded a pair of large center-mounted exhaust pipes. The engine lid featured a large central ram air duct protruding above the roof; a rear spoiler was standard equipment. This radical new body was composed mostly of carbon fiber, with the steel roof and aluminum doors being the only components to retain their standard material. Special 3-piece OZ wheels finished the GT's exterior package.|$|E
5000|$|In 1983, {{the front}} end {{underwent}} transformation with a larger grille, bumper, and corner lights. There was also a revised dashboard with round instead of square gauges. At the same time, the regular cab was lengthened slightly and the <b>air</b> <b>extractor</b> vents behind the cab doors changed from the high [...] "flag" [...] look to long, narrow ones that matched {{the height of the}} window opening. The cabs of the King Cab versions were unchanged. For a limited period, 1984 models built in the US had the single wall beds with rope ties, yet used tail lights on the rear bed corners with amber turn signals over the red stop/tail lights while the backup lights remained under the tailgate.

5000|$|One of {{the primary}} flaws with the HF89/90 had been a {{persistent}} lack of front grip; combined with overwhelming amounts of rear downforce, this created an intractably imbalanced car with a significant tendency to understeer. On slow, twisty circuits typical of American racing, this was a major competitive disadvantage. Thus, on the MkIII, the team first focused on creating more front downforce. This led to the inclusion of an integral front diffuser in the nose to stabilize underbody airflow and create a low-pressure zone directly under the front wheels. This was {{a break from the}} tradition of GTP and Group C cars, which had almost exclusively adhered to a single underbody with one set of tunnels running from front to rear. [...] Working in tandem with the standard ground effect tunnels under the rear of the car, the nose diffuser would balance front and rear grip while minimizing drag.To test and refine the design, a 20%-scale wind tunnel model was built, accurately replicating not just the car's external features but internal components as well — detailed down to the car's wiring, air ducting and engine bay plumbing. Several different nose concepts were modeled and discarded before settling on a final design. In an effort to conceal the innovative nose <b>air</b> <b>extractors,</b> the bodywork immediately behind the front wheels was painted black.|$|R
50|$|A {{system under}} the JBC brand uses {{extractor}} shields that concentrates heat where {{it needs to}} be, protect surrounding components and avoids damage to the board or the QFP. The system {{takes advantage of the}} properties of solder by melting it with hot <b>air.</b> The <b>extractor</b> has a spring system that gently pulls the IC upward when the liquid stage of solder has been reached. The IC is held by a vacuum nozzle similar to the ones used in pick & place machines. This system prevents damage to the pads on the PCB, the IC, avoids overheating surrounding components and blowing them off and also removes the risk of having operator errors by using tweezers or other tools that damage the PCB or IC.|$|R
40|$|The {{filtration}} efficiency of free-standing dust extractors fitted with filter bags {{of various types}} and challenged with wood dust of various grades has been measured. During each test, the air pressure inside the filter bag, the <b>extractor</b> <b>air</b> flow rate and the concentration of dust penetrating the filter bag were monitored. Needlefelt filter bags allowed a limited quantity of dust, usually at a concentration well below the maximum exposure limit (MEL) of 5 mgm ~ 3, to penetrate when they were clean and improved greatly as they became loaded with dust. Filter bags made from woven cotton let more dust through. Needlefelt bags with specially coated fibres were no more efficient than standard bags but those with a microporous membrane coating were highly efficient. However, an increase in {{filtration efficiency}} during loading was invariably accompanied {{by an increase in}} air pressure inside the filter bag and a drop in <b>extractor</b> <b>air</b> flow, all effects being more marked when fine dust was used. Some of the extractors leaked dust from around loosely fitting filter bags and dust collector bags, or through holes in the fan housing, indicating that not all aspects of design are ideal. Tests carried out on bags that had been used for long periods indicated that air entering the filter bag gives rise to an initial high external dust concentration, though this did not usually persist. Periodic cleaning of the bag is recommended. Vacuum cleaning the inside when the bag is removed from the cleaner almost restores its original condition, but results in the generation of large quantities of airborne dust. The use of a tool that fits inside the bag enables cleaning to be carried out effectively in situ without exposing the operator to significant con...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND Particulate air {{pollution}} was demonstrated to have serious {{short and long-term}} health effects, in particular in indoor environments. There is little literature data available to compare particle number concentrations measured in the office environment. Objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the particle number concentration levels in a controlled dynamic office environment. METHODS A Kanomax Model 3887 Handheld Laser Particle Counter was used for continuous (3 h), repeated (sample time 60 s with logging interval of 10 min) and real-time measurements of total number concentrations of particles in the range from 0. 3 µm to 5 µm. The particle counter has a calibrated flow rate of 2. 83 L/min,verified to ± 5 %accuracy. Particle concentrations were studied in a work environment characterized by the presence of three printers. Measurements were performed in different conditions: when printers were off,immediately after the printers had printed one page and after 20 minutes of operative printing process. Same measurements were taken with more or individually printers switched on and with air intake and/or emission switched on/off. All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 17. 0. RESULTS Preliminary analysis of the particle number concentrations showed clear variation (one-way ANOVA, p< 0. 005) during printing time and printers “at rest” in each environmental condition of air intake and/or emission. The average number concentration for particle with diameter of 0. 3 – 0. 5 – 5 µm during printing time were 9. 21 x 106 m- 3 (± 7. 32 x 104 m- 3 SD), 5. 09 x 105 m- 3 (± 4. 93 x 104 m- 3 SD), 4. 24 x 103 m- 3 (± 1. 62 x 103 m- 3 SD) respectively, values about three times higher than that during non operative printing process. Particle concentration was not depending significantly on the number of pages printed. The switching on of the <b>air</b> <b>extractor</b> showed to decrease significantly the 5 µm particle number concentrations (p< 0. 005). Further investigations are underway. CONCLUSIONS The control and the possibility of cutting down such emissions allow to hypothesize procedures and control measures for exposed workers’ protection.

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{performance}} of a sugar cane chopped harvester was analysed when fed with two sugar cane mass flows, measuring the invisible losses, which are impossible to measure in the field, harvester sugar cane cleaning efficiency and <b>air</b> velocity on <b>extractors</b> exit. The trial was done under controlled conditions at Copersucar Technology Center in January 2000. The results showed that the flow of sugar cane through the harvester doesn't influence the magnitudes of total invisible losses and raw material cleaning efficiency. The mean air velocity on the primary extractors exit was 12. 0 m s - 1, and 9. 2 m s - 1 on the secondary extractor, with a coefficient of variation of 21 %, indicating that the poor cleaning performance of the harvester could be related to air velocity difference inside the extractor.

The {{development}} of the energy audit at Los Alpes poultry farm, located in Los Alpes of Venecia, was made following the ASHREAE´S methodology. It consisted on the elaboration of the diagnosis of the farm´s energy consumption by equipment and broiler house, generating energy baseline´s information for guide decision-making on energy savings and identifying savings options to help improve their performance. Since the energy consumption varies according to climate and temperature at which the flock is developed, the average consumption of 30 000 kWh per flock is determined. From this value ventilation represents the 88 %, lighting 7 %, the cooling spray system 2 % and automated feeding system 2 % and others loads 1 %. Due to ventilation represents a significant use of energy on the farm, with an average consumption of 25 177 kWh, the opportunities for energy conservation were oriented towards improving the ventilation system in the broiler house, as the corrective maintenance in power transmission system tensor, to increase the flow of <b>air</b> displaced by <b>extractor,</b> and installing a suspended ceiling, which allow filling gaps in insulation, increase the air speed and reduce the volume of air to move.

40|$|A ventilação natural é uma das estratégias mais adequadas para o resfriamento passivo dos edifícios e para a manutenção da qualidade do ar. Uma das alternativas existentes para se alcançar tal proposição é a utilização de torres de vento situadas acima do nível da cobertura, as quais podem funcionar como captadores ou extratores de ar. Esta pesquisa tem como objetivo geral avaliar quatro tipos de torres, atuando como captadores: a unidirecional, com uma abertura para a entrada de vento, em locais onde o vento se movimenta predominantemente em uma direção; a tetradirecional, com quatro aberturas; a octodirecional, com oito aberturas e a dodecadirecional, com doze aberturas; em locais em que o vento age em várias direções. Para alcançar o objetivo utilizaram-se ensaios em túnel de vento e simulações no {{software}} CFX®, os quais permitiram estudar as características técnicas das torres analisadas e seus efeitos sobre a ventilação interna do ambiente, bem como contribuir para a difusão desse sistema de ventilação no Brasil. O desenvolvimento do trabalho foi dividido nas seguintes etapas: definição das geometrias das torres; definição, construção e instrumentação das maquetes; definição dos ângulos de incidência do vento; ensaios no túnel de vento e simulações no software CFX®: velocidade e pressão. Os resultados obtidos a partir de uma série de experimentos e simulações computacionais permitiram a análise e comparação dos diversos projetos propostos, auxiliando, portanto, na determinação das configurações mais adequadas, além da verificação da compatibilidade entre os dois tipos de estudo, concluindo que as torres octodirecional e dodecadirecional são as mais eficientes, pois proporcionam maiores valores de velocidade do ar interno na maioria das posições consideradas. Desta forma, utilizando o túnel de vento e o CFX®, as análises possibilitaram desenvolver melhorias para os ambientes avaliados, no que se refere ao desempenho da ventilação. Isso proporcionará melhores taxas de conforto aos usuários da edificação, considerando todas as aberturas para permitir o fluxo do vento em qualquer situação. Ademais, podem-se verificar as distribuições das aberturas de entrada e saída mais adequadas para captação e distribuição do vento no interior dos ambientes, proporcionando melhores condições de conforto térmico. Natural ventilation {{is one of}} {{the most}} appropriate strategies for passive cooling of buildings and the maintenance of air quality. One of the alternatives for achieving such proposal is the use of wind towers above the level of the roof, which can function as <b>air</b> catchers or <b>extractors.</b> This research aims to evaluate four types of towers, acting as air catchers: unidirectional, with an opening for the entrance of the wind, in locations where the wind moves predominantly in one direction, the tetradirectional, with four openings, the octodirectional, with eight openings and dodecadirectional, with twelve openings, in locations where the wind moves in various directions. To achieve the goal, tests in wind tunnel and simulations in CFX® software were performed, which allowed the study of the technical characteristics of the analyzed towers and their effects on the indoors ventilation, as well as the contribution to the spread of this ventilation system in Brazil. The methodology was divided into the following steps: the definition of the geometry of the towers; definition, construction and instrumentation of the models; definition of the angles of the incidence of the wind; wind tunnel tests and simulations in CFX® software: speed and pressure. The obtained results from a series of experimental and computational simulations allowed the analysis and comparison of the various proposed design configurations, helping, therefore, in determining the most appropriate settings, besides the verification of compatibility between the two types of study, concluding that the octodirectional and dodecadirectional towers are the most efficient ones, as they provide higher rate of indoor air speed in most considered positions. Thus, using the wind tunnel and CFX®, the analysis allowed the development of enhancements to the analyzed environments, concerning the performance of the ventilation. This will provide better comfort rates to the users of the building, considering all openings to allow the wind flow in any situation. Furthermore, the most suitable distribution of inlet and outlet openings for the catchment and distribution of the wind within the environments may be verified, providing better conditions of thermal comfort...|$|R
