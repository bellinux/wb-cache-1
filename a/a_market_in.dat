5|$|The {{period between}} the 16th {{and the end of}} the 18th century was {{characterized}} by the existence of self-sufficient regional economies separated by considerable distances, a lack of road, maritime or river communications, and the hazards and hardship of land transport. By the end of the 18th century, a significant national economy came into being, as Argentina developed <b>a</b> <b>market</b> <b>in</b> which reciprocal flows of capital, labour, and goods could take place on a significant scale between its different regions, which it had hitherto lacked.|$|E
5|$|Accompanied by Brady, Hindley {{approached}} 12-year-old John Kilbride in {{the early}} evening of 23 November 1963, at <b>a</b> <b>market</b> <b>in</b> Ashton-under-Lyne and offered him a lift home on the pretext that his parents would be worried about him being out so late. With the added inducement of a bottle of sherry, Kilbride readily agreed to get into the Ford Anglia car that Hindley had hired. Brady told Kilbride that the sherry was at their home, and they would have to make a detour to collect it. On the way he suggested that they take another detour, to search for a glove he said that Hindley had lost on the moor. When they reached the moor Brady took the child with him while Hindley waited in the car. Brady sexually assaulted Kilbride and attempted to slit his throat with a six-inch serrated blade before fatally strangling him with a piece of string, possibly a shoelace.|$|E
5|$|Historically part of Cheshire, Altrincham was {{established}} as a market town in 1290, {{a time when the}} economy of most communities was based on agriculture rather than trade, and there is still <b>a</b> <b>market</b> <b>in</b> the town today. Further socioeconomic development came with the extension of the Bridgewater Canal to Altrincham in 1765 and the arrival of the railway in 1849, stimulating industrial activity in the town. Outlying villages were absorbed by Altrincham's subsequent growth, along with the grounds of Dunham Massey Hall, formerly the home of the Earl of Stamford, and now a tourist attraction with three Grade I Listed Buildings and a deer park.|$|E

5|$|The first {{settlement}} {{formed in}} the Iron Age where a prehistoric track crossed the River Slea. It was a tribal centre and home to a mint for the Corieltauvi in the 1st centuries BC and AD. Evidence of Roman and Anglo-Saxon settlement has been uncovered, and by the late Saxon period the town was an economic and jurisdictional centre with a court and market. In the medieval period, records differentiate between Old and New Sleaford, the latter emerging in the areas around the present day market place and St Denys' Church. Sleaford Castle was constructed in the 12th century for the Bishops of Lincoln, who owned the manor. Granted the right to hold <b>a</b> <b>market</b> <b>in</b> the mid-12th century, New Sleaford developed into a market town and became locally important in the wool trade, while Old Sleaford declined.|$|E

In 1292, Edward I granted the right for the lord of the manor to hold <b>a</b> <b>market</b> <b>in</b> the village. Another charter was granted by Henry IV, with evidence that the market existed until approximately 1900. The Achards also established an annual fair to observe the feast of St. Thomas the Martyr on 7 July.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} how the business model of two leading Swedish municipally owned solid waste management companies exposes them to four different but related markets: <b>a</b> political <b>market</b> <b>in</b> which their legitimacy as an organization is determined; <b>a</b> waste-as-material <b>market</b> that determines their access to waste as a process input; <b>a</b> technical <b>market</b> <b>in</b> which these companies choose what waste processing technique to use; and <b>a</b> commercial <b>market</b> <b>in</b> which they <b>market</b> their products.
