Demonstrations of the techniques used to flood the meadows are still carried out occasionally.|$|E

5|$|Further {{analysis}} shows that several processes were in {{progress in the}} late Cretaceous seas and partially overlapped in time, then ended with the abrupt mass extinction.

5|$|Metagreywackes and metapelites {{from two}} areas {{traversing}} {{one of these}} aureoles near Yellowknife have been studied. Most of the Slave province rocks are granitic with metamorphosed Yellowknife metasedimentary and volcanic rocks. Isotopic ages of these rocks is <b>around</b> , <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kenoran orogeny. Rocks comprising the Slave province represent a high grade of metamorphism, intrusion and basement remobilization typical of Archean terranes. Migmatites, batholithic intrusive and granulitic metamorphic rocks show foliation and compositional banding; the rocks are uniformly hard and so thoroughly deformed that little foliation exists. Most Yellowknife Supergroup metasediments are tightly folded (isoclinal) or occur in plunging anticlines.|$|E
