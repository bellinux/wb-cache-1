5|$|Whereas the eponymous concept album's lyrics {{focus on}} human {{struggle}} <b>and</b> <b>self-determination,</b> A Beautiful Lies lyrics are more personal {{and the music}} introduces screaming vocals. The transformation that resonates throughout the album reflects the personal and artistic changes experienced by the band members {{before and during the}} creation of the record. The album widened the band's sound by combining elements from progressive rock, hard rock and emo. Such alternative rock style has been compared to bands like The Cure, U2 and The Smashing Pumpkins.|$|E
