5|$|A {{backstage}} segment occurred where CM Punk {{was interviewed}} regarding his title {{defense in the}} Championship Scramble later in the evening. Randy Orton interrupted the interview, and as he spoke with Punk, Cody Rhodes, Ted DiBiase, and Manu attacked Punk.

The battle of Karameh and the subsequent increase in the PLO's strength are considered to have been important catalysts for the 1970 events {{of the civil war}} known as Black September, in which the kingdom managed to expel the Palestinian groups to Lebanon <b>after</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> started to gain control over Jordan.|$|E
5|$|During evolution, darts {{appear to}} have been lost secondarily, i.e., <b>after</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> evolved and been functional. Vestigial darts (ones that exist only in a {{rudimentary}} condition) occur in the family Sagdidae, and in many Helicoidea, the surrounding organs have also degenerated (become non-functional). The sarcobelum is a fleshy or cuticle-coated papilla which {{is considered to be a}} degenerated, previously dart-bearing, organ.|$|E

5|$|In 1926, Thorpe married Freeda Verona Kirkpatrick (September 19, 1905 – March 2, 2007). She {{was working}} for the manager of the {{baseball}} team for which he was playing at the time.

5|$|In 1979 President Jimmy Carter pardoned Lolita Lebrón, Irvin Flores, and Rafael Cancel Miranda <b>after</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> served 25 {{years in}} prison. Andrés Figueroa Cordero was {{released}} from prison earlier because of a terminal illness. Governor of Puerto Rico Carlos Romero Barceló publicly opposed the pardons granted by Carter, stating that it would encourage terrorism and undermine public safety. Lebrón received a heroine's welcome by her supporters upon her return to her motherland. Lebrón married Sergio Irizarry Rivera and continued to participate in pro-independence activities. The couple had met while she was in prison, when the Nationalist Party ordered him to monitor her health. Their marriage took place eight years <b>after</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> met. They moved into a small house in Loiza. The house possessed few distinctive traits, mostly composed of religious iconography and a large flag of Puerto Rico in the living room.|$|E

5|$|Not long <b>after</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> returned, {{the attack}} began. Indian warriors {{set fire to}} several houses and stables, but a {{favorable}} wind kept the fires from spreading. Children used the water drawn by the women {{to put out the}} fires. A flaming arrow landed in baby Richard Johnson's crib, but it was doused by his sister Betsy. Help arrived from Lexington and Boone Station, and the Indians retreated.|$|E
5|$|Problems {{were also}} found with the Littlejohn adaptor fitted to the 2-pounder to {{increase}} its range and penetration power; <b>after</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been fitted the adapters could not be removed, and could only fire specially designed armour-piercing rounds, which took time to manufacture.|$|E

5|$|About half-past {{one o'clock}} on the morning, an {{explosion}} {{took place in}} Felling colliery, by which nine men and thirteen boys were hurried into eternity, several others severely burnt, and all the underground horses but one destroyed. The accident occurred {{at the time of}} calling course, or when one set of men were relieving another. Several of the morning shift men were standing round the mouth of the pit, waiting to go down, when the blast occurred, and the part who had just descended met it soon <b>after</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> reached the bottom of the shaft; these were most miserably burnt and mangled.|$|E
5|$|Always {{in need of}} funds, Raynald urged Manuel to {{send the}} promised subsidy to him, but Manuel failed to pay the money. Raynald made an {{alliance}} with Thoros II of Cilicia. They attacked Cyprus, subjecting the Byzantine island to a three-week orgy of violence in early 1156. They only left Cyprus on the rumour of an imperial fleet approaching the island, but only <b>after</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> forced all Cypriots to ransom themselves, {{with the exception of}} the wealthiest individuals (including Emperor Manuel's nephew, John Doukas Komnenos), whom they carried off to Antioch. Cyprus would never entirely recover from the devastation that Raynald's and Thoros's marauding raid caused.|$|E
5|$|As with The Quatermass Experiment, {{the film}} {{rights to the}} serial were {{purchased}} by Hammer Film Productions — in this case <b>after</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> only read the scripts, before the serial was even made. Titled Quatermass 2, the film was released in 1957 and once again directed by Val Guest, with Brian Donlevy starring; unlike the first film, Kneale wrote the screenplay himself. In the United States, the film was released under the title Enemy from Space.|$|E

5|$|Aston and Taylor {{subsequently}} {{decided to}} work together on a new archaeological television series, devising the format for Time Team. Whilst Taylor organised the film production side of the project with Channel 4, Aston located suitable sites to excavate, and gathered together a team of specialists to appear on the show, among them field archaeologists Harding and Carenza Lewis, artist Victor Ambrus, and historian Robin Bush. He knew the actor and television presenter Tony Robinson <b>after</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> met on an archaeological course in Greece, and successfully requested that he present the show. From an early stage, they had agreed that every episode would feature a practical process or a re-enactment alongside the field archaeology.|$|E
5|$|Bache's {{strategy}} for presenting these works {{was one of}} familiarity. He performed two-piano arrangements of Liszt's orchestral works prior to the debuts of the original versions, and performed some of Liszt's symphonic poems shortly <b>after</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been premiered at the Crystal Palace. He also provided informative, scholarly program notes, written by leading musical analysts and intimates in the Liszt circle. The English musical press, while generally hostile to the music he presented, noted and appreciated Bache's efforts. Liszt remained grateful; without Bache, he acknowledged, his music might not have gained the foothold that it did.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the storm}} struck, Honduras was facing {{decreased}} food supplies due to ongoing El Niño conditions.
