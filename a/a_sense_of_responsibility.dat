He visited Eliot and Wyndham Lewis, who produced a now-famous portrait of Pound reclining. In April 1939 he sailed for New York, believing he could stop America's involvement in World War II, happy to answer reporters' questions about Mussolini while he lounged on the deck of the ship in a tweed jacket. He traveled to Washington, D.C. where he met senators and congressmen. His daughter, Mary, said that he had acted out of <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility,</b> rather than megalomania; he was offered no encouragement, and was left feeling depressed and frustrated.|$|E

25|$|A {{substantial}} stride {{was taken}} {{in the direction of}} popular education in 1721, when King Frederick IV established 240 schoolhouses bearing the royal insignia and called them Cavalry schools after a division of the country into military districts. At the same time, the new religious movement of Pietism was spreading from Germany to Denmark. It aroused among church people <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> towards forthcoming generations and enjoyed royal support. A series of calls by the church for universal confirmation which could only be met by some degree of literacy, brought many new schools into existence. Thus, a limited kind of compulsory education was formally introduced.|$|E
25|$|Anne {{returned}} to Thorp Green in January 1843 where she secured a position for Branwell. He {{was to take}} over as tutor to the Robinsons' son, Edmund, who was growing {{too old to be}} in Anne's care. Branwell did not live in the house as Anne did. Anne's vaunted calm appears to have been the result of hard-fought battles, balancing deeply felt emotions with careful thought, <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> and resolute determination. All three Brontë sisters worked as governesses or teachers, and all experienced problems controlling their charges, gaining support from their employers, and coping with homesickness—but Anne {{was the only one who}} persevered and made a success of her work.|$|E

25|$|British {{political}} {{opinion was}} also {{shaped by the}} attempted Impeachment of Warren Hastings; the trial, whose proceedings began in 1788, ended with Hastings' acquittal, in 1795. Although the effort was chiefly coordinated by Edmund Burke, it also drew support from within the British government. Burke accused Hastings not only of corruption, but—appealing to universal standards of justice—also of acting solely upon his own discretion, without concern for law, and of wilfully causing distress to others in India. Hastings' defenders countered that his actions were consistent with Indian customs and traditions. Although Burke's speeches at the trial drew applause and focused attention on India, Hastings was eventually acquitted, {{due in part to}} the revival of nationalism in Britain in the wake of the French Revolution. Nonetheless, Burke's effort had the effect of creating <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> in British public life for the Company's dominion in India.|$|E

500|$|For A Dramatic Turn of Events, Dream Theater {{underwent}} a self-proclaimed musical change, reevaluating and restructuring themselves. The album has drawn stylistic comparisons {{to two of}} the band's past albums, Images and Words (1992) and [...] (1999). Many songs on the album were written with a specific purpose in mind as Petrucci, one of the album's primary composers, felt <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> to fans following Portnoy's departure. The album's title was derived from its recurring lyrical themes of dramatic changes in history that have affected people's lives, including contemporary uprisings such as the Libyan Civil War.|$|E

500|$|Abovian {{was born}} in 1809 {{in the village of}} Kanaker, then part of the Qajar Persian Empire, and now a {{district}} of Yerevan, Armenia. Abovian's family were descendants of the Beglaryan melik family in Gulistan, one of five Armenian families who ruled around the current day region of Nagorno-Karabakh. The Abovian family held the position of tanuter (a hereditary lordship) in Kanaker; Abovian's uncle was the last tanuter of Kanaker. His aunt was the wife of Sahak Aghamalian, the last melik of Yerevan {{at the time of the}} Russian annexation in 1828. [...] His social origins and descent imbued him at an early age with <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> to his people. He was born six years after his parents, Avetik and Takuhi, married. He had a brother, Garabed, who died at the age of three.|$|E

500|$|In {{composing}} A Dramatic Turn of Events, Petrucci {{admitted to}} feeling <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> to fans following Portnoy's departure. He also {{explained that the}} majority of the songs on the album were written to prove to people that everything was grounded and intact with the band. Opener [...] "On the Backs of Angels" [...] was designed to reflect Dream Theater's signature sound, the heavy [...] "Build Me Up, Break Me Down" [...] was written far into the making of the album to serve as a contrast to its progressive elements, [...] "Outcry" [...] was intended to be the anthem of the album, and [...] "Breaking All Illusions" [...] was used as an epic piece that would not bind the band to conventional songwriting arrangements. The final song written for the album was the ballad [...] "Beneath the Surface", which is also its closing track. Petrucci wrote the song himself, demoed and recorded it, and then presented it to the band, who were open to including it on the album.|$|E
500|$|The {{music was}} {{composed}} by Hitoshi Sakimoto, {{who had also}} worked on the previous Valkyria Chronicles games. When he originally heard about the project, {{he thought it would}} be a light tone similar to other Valkyria Chronicles games, but found the themes much darker than expected. [...] An early theme he designed around his original vision of the project was rejected. He redid the main theme about seven times through the music production due to this need to reassess the game. The main theme was initially recorded using orchestra, then Sakimoto removed elements such as the guitar and bass, then adjusted the theme using a synthesizer before redoing segments such as the guitar piece on their own before incorporating them into the theme. The rejected main theme was used as a hopeful tune that played during the game's ending. The battle themes were designed around the concept of a [...] "modern battle" [...] divorced from a fantasy scenario by using modern musical instruments, constructed to create a sense of atonality. While Sakimoto was most used to working with synthesized music, he felt that he needed to incorporate live instruments such as orchestra and guitar. The guitar was played by Mitsuhiro Ohta, who also arranged several of the later tracks. The game's opening theme song, , was sung by Japanese singer May'n. Its theme was the reason soldiers fought, in particular their wish to protect what was precious to them rather than <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> or duty. Its lyrics were written by Seiko Fujibayashi, who had worked on May'n on previous singles.|$|E
500|$|Before the launch, Blair {{announced}} that he would give the £4.6m advance and all royalties from his memoirs to a sports centre for injured soldiers. In an interview with Jonathon Gatehouse, he conceded, [...] "You wouldn't be human if you didn't feel both <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> and a deep sadness for those who have lost their lives. That responsibility stays with me now, and will stay with {{me for the rest of}} my life. You know, I came to office as prime minister in 1997, focusing on domestic policy and ended up in four conflicts – Sierra Leone, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq. And it does change you, and so it should." [...] BBC political correspondent Norman Smith said Blair's severest critics would see the donation as [...] "guilt money" [...] for taking the UK to war against Iraq in 2003. The father of a soldier killed there decried the donation as [...] "blood money", while the father of another serviceman who died said Blair had a [...] "guilty conscience." [...] A spokesperson for the Stop the War Coalition supported with the donation, but added, [...] "No proportion of Tony Blair's massive and ill-gotten fortune can buy him innocence or forgiveness. He took this country to war on a series of lies against the best legal advice and in defiance of majority opinion." [...] A spokesman for Blair said that it had long been his intention to give the money to a charity; he added aiding soldiers undergoing rehabilitation at the Battle Back Challenge Centre was [...] "his way of honouring their courage and sacrifice." [...] The announcement was welcomed by Chris Simpkins, director general of The Royal British Legion, who said, [...] "Mr Blair's generosity is much appreciated and will help us to make a real and lasting difference to the lives of hundreds of injured personnel." ...|$|E
