In the summer of 1997, Superman Lives entered pre-production, with an art department employed under production designer Rick Heinrichs. Burton hired Wesley Strick to rewrite Smith's script. Smith was disappointed, stating, [...] "The studio was happy with what I was doing. Then Tim Burton got involved, and when he signed his pay-or-play deal, he turned <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> {{he wanted to do}} his version of Superman. So who is Warner Bros. going back to? The guy who made Clerks, or the guy who made them half a billion dollars on Batman?" [...] When Strick read Smith's script, he was annoyed with the fact that [...] "Superman was accompanied/shadowed by someone/something called the Eradicator." [...] He also felt that [...] "Brainiac's evil plot of launching a disk in space to block out the sun and make Superman powerless was reminiscent of an episode of The Simpsons, with Mr. Burns doing the Brainiac role." [...] However, after reading The Death and Return of Superman, Strick was able to understand some of the elements of Smith's script. Strick's rewrite featured Superman as an existentialist, thinking of himself to be an outsider on Earth. Superman is threatened by Brainiac and Lex Luthor, who later amalgamate into [...] "Lexiac," [...] described by Strick as [...] "a schizo/scary mega-villain." [...] Superman is later resurrected by the power of 'K,' a natural force representing the spirit of Krypton, as he defeats Lexiac.|$|E
2500|$|The album's working {{title was}} Strawberries for Pigs, a name {{inspired}} by the reception the band's newer music received from some of their older fans. As Vanian explained, [...] "we were playing {{a lot of new}} material, and we had an audience that didn't want to hear about anything, they just wanted to hear Neat Neat Neat and New Rose nothing else. And they wanted to just smash everything. And they weren't interested in hearing music at all. So at one point, I turned <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'It's like giving strawberries to a fucking pig, this gig, you know?' And that stuck in our minds, and we used it".|$|E
2500|$|Nebraska Coach Callahan {{used his}} coach's {{challenge}} {{to have the}} officials review the preceding third-down play. The play was allowed to stand as an incomplete pass, as called on the field. Brown gave Bailey a swat on the helmet and Bailey jogged onto the field and calmly made the field goal. Nebraska tried two end-zone passes, both incomplete, and Texas won the game by 2 points, 22–20. [...] Bailey said afterwards, [...] "Actually, the only thing I really remember about being on the field was when the offensive line turned <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> 'Let's just block for 1.3seconds. [...] Just {{give him a chance}} to get the ball off.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Jesus looked <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> to his disciples, [...] "How {{hard it is}} for {{the rich}} to enter the kingdom of God!" [...] The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again, [...] "Children, {{how hard it is to}} enter the kingdom of God! 25 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God." [...] The disciples were even more amazed, and said to each other, [...] "Who then can be saved?" [...] Jesus looked at them and said, [...] "With man this is im{{possible}}, but not with God; all things are possible with God." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{remember}} Jimmy had {{a little}} bit of trouble with the solo on [...] "Stairway to Heaven"... e hadn't completely figured it out. Nowadays you sometimes spend a whole day doing one thing. Back then, we never did that. We never spent a very long time recording anything. I remember sitting in the control room with Jimmy, he's standing there next to me and he'd done quite a few passes and it wasn't going anywhere. I could see he was getting a bit paranoid and so I was getting paranoid. I turned <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> [...] "You're making me paranoid!" [...] And he said, [...] "No, you're making me paranoid!" [...] It was a silly circle of paranoia. Then bang! On the next take or two he ripped it out.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the initial}} {{draft of the}} screenplay, the {{original}} series cast appeared in a prologue, and Guinan served as the bridge between the two generations. The opening shot {{would have been the}} entire original series cast crammed into an elevator aboard the Enterprise-B, happy to be back together. The Enterprise-D's end also appeared—the saucer crash had first been proposed as the cliffhanger for Moore's original seventh-season finale [...] "All Good Things...", which eventually became the series finale. Kirk's death was initially developed in Braga, Moore and Berman's story sessions. Moore recalled that [...] "we wanted to aim high, do something different and big... We knew we had to have a strong Picard story arc, so what are the profound things in a man's life he has to face? Mortality tops the list." [...] After the idea of killing off a Next Generation cast member was vetoed, someone suggested that Kirk die instead. Moore recalled that [...] "we all sorta looked <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'That might be it.' [...] " [...] The studio and Shatner himself had few concerns about the plot point.|$|E

2500|$|Since the {{publication}} of his first book, My Story in 1975, he claimed that his wealth originated from being commissioned as a mineral-dowser and not from bending spoons and forks. In 2007, skeptics observed that Geller appeared to have dropped his claims that he does not perform magic tricks. Randi highlighted a quotation from the November 2007 issue of the magazine Magische Welt (Magic World) in which Geller said: [...] "I'll no longer say that I have supernatural powers. I am an entertainer. I want to do a good show. My entire character has changed." [...] In a later interview, Geller told Telepolis, [...] "I said to this German magazine, so what I did say, that I changed my character, {{to the best of my}} recollection, and I no longer say that I do supernatural things. It doesn't mean that I don't have powers. It means that I don't say 'it's supernatural', I say 'I'm a mystifier!' That's what I said. And the skeptics turned it <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Uri Geller said he's a magician!' I never said that." [...] In that interview, Geller further explained that when he is asked how he does his stunts, he tells children to [...] "Forget the paranormal. Forget spoon bending! Instead of that, focus on school! Become a positive thinker! Believe in yourself and create a target! Go to university! Never smoke! And never touch drugs! And think of success!" ...|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{passengers}} of the bus approached Treviño Morales weeping and saying: [...] "Please, sir. I {{do not want to}} do this. I will give you all the money I have and my own house, but please let us go." [...] Treviño Morales stared at him firmly, took away his club and then said, [...] "Okay, stupid asshole. Leave," [...] and while the crying man was walking away, Treviño Morales swung his bat and hit him {{in the back of the}} head—and then struck him more than 20 times until his head was completely destroyed. He then turned <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> to the kidnapped victims: [...] "This is what you have to do. Have some balls (courage). Anyone who does not want to can tell me and I will beat the hell out of you." [...] All of the men started fighting. Several other Zeta members, who were still on a bus with other passengers, ordered the women whom they considered the most beautiful to descend the vehicle so they could rape them. Then they took away the children from their mothers, and shot the rest of the bus passengers. The women were taken to a warehouse where many other women were held captive. Inside a dark room, the women were reportedly raped and beaten, while one heard the screams of the women and of the children being put in acid. A driver of one of the buses was then asked to turn on the bus engine, and then ordered to move the bus to where the kidnapped victims were handcuffed and laid down on the dirt floor. [...] "Drive on top of them," [...] one of the killers told the bus driver, who stood there motionless. [...] "Drive on top of them or I will put you there too, asshole," [...] the killer repeated. As the driver rode over his passengers with the bus, he felt like the vehicle was passing over speed bumps, but the only difference was that the bus driver and {{the passengers}} could actually hear the cries of the people as they were being run over. The gunmen, once the driver was finished, shot him in the head and shot the rest on board. The bus was then set on fire by the Zetas. Treviño Morales then gathered all the Zetas and said, [...] "We have had enough fun for tonight. Bring the winners." [...] His men brought all of those who had passed the gladiator-like competitions, and they were gathered in front of Treviño Morales.|$|E

6000|$|Whether her {{indifference}} {{was assumed}} or not, it was effective.

6000|$|After {{following}} him for four hours, he stopped, turned <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Rest, eat you fellows." [...] They did so. In {{about an hour}} they started again. After walking ten miles they heard the roaring of an immense cataract. Suddenly they find themselves {{face to face with}} a long deep gorge or canyon. 'Black Canyon,' they all cry. 'Stop,' says the Indian. He pushes a stone aside. It uncovers the mouth of a small cave. The Indian struck a light with two sticks. They follow him into this cave for about a mile when the cave opens into an immense Grotto. The Indian whistled, a bear and dog appeared. [...] "Bring meat, Nero," [...] said the Indian.|$|E
6000|$|He gave {{a look at}} {{the circle}} of {{mountains}} <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I love Chamouni." [...] The good soul! I was much of his opinion. If I had been born within sight of glorious Mont Blanc, with its apocalyptic clouds, and store of visions, not all the fat pork and flat prairies of Indiana and Ohio could tempt me. No wonder the Swiss die for their native valleys! I would if I were they. I asked him about education. He said his children went to a school kept by Catholic sisters, who taught reading, writing, and Latin. The dialect of Chamouni is a patois, composed of French and Latin. He said that provision was very scarce in the winter. I asked how they made their living when there were no travellers to be guided up Mont Blanc. He had a trade at which he wrought in winter months, and his wife did tailoring.|$|E
60|$|So Jim {{reckoned}} it wouldn't be no {{more than}} fair if me and Tom done a TENTH apiece. Tom he turned his back to git room and be private, and then he smole a smile that spread <b>around</b> <b>and</b> covered the whole Sahara to the westward, back to the Atlantic edge of it where we come from. Then he turned <b>around</b> again <b>and</b> <b>said</b> it was a good enough arrangement, and we was satisfied if Jim was. Jim said he was.|$|R

6000|$|It seemed abrupt, but I {{thought maybe}} the reader wouldn't notice it, because I {{changed the subject}} right away to {{something}} else. Anyway it loosened up Rowena from where she was stuck and got {{her out of the}} way, and that was the main thing. It seemed a prompt good way of weeding out people that had got stalled, and a plenty good enough way for those others; so I hunted up the two boys and said, [...] "They went out back one night to stone the cat and fell down the well and got drowned." [...] Next I searched around and found old Aunt Patsy and Aunt Betsy Hale where they were <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "They went out back one night to visit the sick and fell down the well and got drowned." [...] I was going to drown some others, but I gave up the idea, partly because I believed that if I kept that up it would arouse attention, and perhaps sympathy with those people, and partly because it was not a large well and would not hold any more anyway.|$|E
6000|$|On {{looking at}} his watch he found it was close on midnight; and, not sorry for the divertissement, he made up his fire and made himself his nightly pot of tea. He had got through a good spell of work, and thought himself {{entitled}} to a cigarette; and so he sat on the great oak chair before the fire and enjoyed it. Whilst smoking he began to think {{that he would like to}} know where the rat disappeared to, for he had certain ideas for the morrow not entirely disconnected with a rat-trap. Accordingly he lit another lamp and placed it so that it would shine well into the right-hand corner of the wall by the fireplace. Then he got all the books he had with him, and placed them handy to throw at the vermin. Finally he lifted the rope of the alarm bell and placed the end of it on the table, fixing the extreme end under the lamp. As he handled it he could not help noticing how pliable it was, especially for so strong a rope, and one not in use. 'You could hang a man with it,' he thought to himself. When his preparations were made he looked <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> complacently: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Gee, Oi'd like dat, but it ain't {{for poor}} blokes the loikes of me,' said he. That {{gave me an}} idea. There was a vacancy in the patrol, and at the next meeting I put it right {{straight}} to the fellows. I told them all about Sparrer and got 'em interested, and then I just kind of hinted at the brotherhood and democracy idea of scouting and what a mighty good turn {{it would be if}} Sparrer could be given a chance to get into the game, and then dropped the subject. The hint worked all right. They're a pretty good bunch, these fellows. They talked it all over and then they came around and asked me if I supposed Sparrer would like to join the Blue Tortoise Patrol. I told them that I was sure he wouldn't if he suspected that the invitation was charity on their part. They chewed this over {{for a while and then}} came <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that they really would like to take him in, and there wasn't any charity about it. I took the invitation to Sparrer and he went up in the air like a rocket, just as I knew he would.|$|E

60|$|Whenever my missionaries overcame {{a knight}} errant {{on the road}} they washed him, {{and when he got}} well they swore him to go and get a bulletin-board and {{disseminate}} soap and civilization the rest of his days. As a consequence the workers in the field were increasing by degrees, and the reform was steadily spreading. My soap factory felt the strain early. At first I had only two hands; but before I had left home I was already employing fifteen, and running night and day; and the atmospheric result was getting so pronounced that the king went sort of fainting and gasping <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> he did not believe he could stand it much longer, and Sir Launcelot got so that he did hardly anything but walk up and down the roof and swear, although I told him it was worse up there than anywhere else, but he said he wanted plenty of air; and he was always complaining that a palace was no place for a soap factory anyway, and said if a man was to start one in his house he would be damned if he wouldn't strangle him. There were ladies present, too, but much these people ever cared for that; they would swear before children, if the wind was their way when the factory was going.|$|E

Singing they do be sometimes, and dancing, but all the time they have cloven feet." [...] Yet he was so scornful of unchristian things for all their dancing and singing that he thinks that [...] "you have only to bid them begone and they will go. It was one night," [...] he says, [...] "after walking back from Kinvara and down by the wood beyond I felt one coming beside me, and I could feel the horse he was riding on and the way he lifted his legs, but they do not make a sound like the hoofs of a horse. So I stopped and turned <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> very loud, 'Be off!' and he went and never troubled me after. And I knew a man who was dying, and one came on his bed, and he cried out to it, 'Get out of that, you unnatural animal!' and it left him. Fallen angels they are, and after the fall God said, 'Let there be Hell,' and there it was in a moment." [...] An old woman who was sitting by the fire joined in as he said this with [...] "God save us, it's a pity He said the word, and there might have been no Hell the day," [...] but the seer did not notice her words. He went on, [...] "And then he asked the devil what would he take for the souls of all the people.
