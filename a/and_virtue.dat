5|$|Love in Several Masques is a play by Henry Fielding {{that was}} first {{performed}} on 16 February 1728 at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.

5|$|Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria (SV 325, The Return of Ulysses to his Homeland) is {{an opera}} {{consisting}} of a prologue and five acts (later revised to three), set by Claudio Monteverdi to a libretto by Giacomo Badoaro. The opera was first performed at the Teatro Santi Giovanni e Paolo in Venice during the 1639–1640 carnival season. The story, taken from {{the second half of}} Homer's Odyssey, tells how constancy <b>and</b> <b>virtue</b> are ultimately rewarded, treachery and deception overcome. After his long journey home from the Trojan Wars Ulisse, king of Ithaca, finally returns to his kingdom where he finds that a trio of villainous suitors are importuning his faithful queen, Penelope. With the assistance of the gods, his son Telemaco and a staunch friend Eumete, Ulisse vanquishes the suitors and recovers his kingdom.|$|E
5|$|La Cousine Bette is {{considered}} Balzac's last great work. His trademark use of realist detail combines with a panorama of characters returning from earlier novels. Several critics have hailed it as {{a turning point}} in the author's career, and others have called it a prototypical naturalist text. It has been compared to William Shakespeare's Othello as well as Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace. The novel explores themes of vice <b>and</b> <b>virtue,</b> as well as the influence of money on French society. Bette's relationship with Valérie is also seen as an important exploration of homoerotic themes. A number of film versions of the story have been produced, including a 1971 BBC mini-series starring Margaret Tyzack and Helen Mirren, and a 1998 feature film with Jessica Lange in the title role.|$|E

Because of the selectivity of his sermons, however, his parishioners begin to suspect him of Socinianism. When Sutherland is tricked into making a harsh criticism of the British and Foreign Bible Society, claiming that {{the text of the}} Bible without clerical guidance is more likely to lead to wickedness than to Christian faith <b>and</b> <b>virtue,</b> his doubts are revealed, and he is forced to resign his position.|$|E

30|$|Seven {{components}} {{were identified in}} the fifth and final domain in the analysis framework: Relationships <b>and</b> <b>Virtues.</b> This domain concerns enduring social relationships, momentary social interactions, <b>and</b> the individual <b>virtues</b> <b>and</b> behaviour that influence their quality (Rusk and Waters 2015). Gratitude is inherently social in nature because it relies on the actions of other people. Hence, gratitude in particular relates to the Relationships <b>and</b> <b>Virtues</b> domain. This section will outline the seven components in this domain and how they relate to appreciative functioning.|$|R

5|$|Sir Thursday is a {{young adult}} fantasy novel written by Australian author Garth Nix. It is the fourth book in The Keys to the Kingdom series, and was {{released}} in March 2006. Sir Thursday continues from the preceding book, following the adventures of Arthur Penhaligon as he attempts to retrieve the Fourth key of the Kingdom, and claim mastership of The Great Maze. As with the other books in the series, the theme of 'seven' is prevalent, along with the themes of sin <b>and</b> <b>virtue.</b> The book received generally favourable critical response, but was criticised for a slow pace, among other issues.|$|E

Both the melody and the lyrics were printed in Varpas in September 1898. Upon his death in 1899, Kudirka's tomb was engraved with the second stanza of the anthem (later destroyed by the authorities).|$|E
5|$|For George III, Pitt's {{appointment}} {{was a great}} victory. It proved {{that he was able}} to appoint Prime Ministers on the basis of his own interpretation of the public mood without having to follow the choice of the current majority in the House of Commons. Throughout Pitt's ministry, George supported many of Pitt's political aims and created new peers at an unprecedented rate to increase the number of Pitt's supporters in the House of Lords. During and after Pitt's ministry, George III was extremely popular in Britain. The British people admired him for his piety, and for remaining faithful to his wife. He was fond of his children, and was devastated at the death of two of his sons in infancy in 1782 and 1783 respectively. Nevertheless, he set his children a strict regimen. They were expected to attend rigorous lessons from seven in the morning, and to lead lives of religious observance <b>and</b> <b>virtue.</b> When his children strayed from George's own principles of righteousness, as his sons did as young adults, he was dismayed and disappointed.|$|E

25|$|Like many Renaissance artists before him, Milton {{attempted}} to integrate Christian theology with classical modes. In his early poems, the poet narrator expresses {{a tension between}} vice <b>and</b> <b>virtue,</b> the latter invariably related to Protestantism. In Comus, Milton may make ironic use of the Caroline court masque by elevating notions of purity <b>and</b> <b>virtue</b> over the conventions of court revelry and superstition. In his later poems, Milton's theological concerns become more explicit.|$|E
