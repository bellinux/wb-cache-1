50|$|Ghanaian Jollof rice {{is made up}} of {{vegetable}} oil, onion, bell pepper, cloves of pressed garlic, chillies, tomato paste, beef or chicken (some times alternated with mixed vegetables), jasmine or basmati rice and black pepper. The method of cooking Jollof rice begins with first preparing the beef or chicken by seasoning and frying it until it is well cooked The rest of the ingredients are then fried altogether, starting from onions, tomatoes and spices in that order. After all the ingredients have been fried, rice is then added <b>and</b> <b>cooked</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> meal is prepared. Ghanaian Jollof is typically served with side dishes of beef/chicken/well seasoned and fried fish and/or mixed vegetables.|$|R
25|$|The fresh {{leaves are}} an {{ingredient}} in many South Asian foods (such as chutneys and salads); in Chinese and Thai dishes; in Mexican cooking, particularly in salsa and guacamole {{and as a}} garnish; and in salads in Russia and other CIS countries. In Portugal, chopped coriander {{is used in the}} bread soup Açorda, and in India, chopped coriander is a garnish on Indian dishes such as dal. As heat diminishes their flavour, coriander leaves are often used raw or added to the dish immediately before serving. In Indian and Central Asian recipes, coriander leaves are used in large amounts <b>and</b> <b>cooked</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> flavour diminishes. The leaves spoil quickly when removed from the plant, and lose their aroma when dried or frozen.|$|R

40|$|AbstractRendang is a {{traditional}} Minangkabau food which voted by CNN viewers in 2011 {{as one of the}} most delicious foods in the world. The basic ingredients of rendang are beef meat, coconut milk and spices. The process of cooking rendang took around 6 to 7 hours at the temperature around 80 - 95 oC. There are 3 types of food will be produce during the cooking processes differentiated by water content and colors. They are as following: gulai (<b>cooked</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> sauce became thin <b>and</b> yellowish), kalio (<b>cooked</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> sauce was thick brown color) <b>and</b> rendang (<b>cooked</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> sauce was thick and dry and dark brown color). As the food is cooked in a relatively longer period of time and with various ingredients it is interesting to know the nutritional value of the food. This paper is presenting a preliminary results of the research which aim to evaluate the nutritional value of rendang by analyzing the chemistry compositions, protein digestibility (in-vitro), the profile of amino acid (HPLC), and measuring molecule weight of protein (SDS-PAGE). The result shown that the protein in rendang is decreased compare to fresh meat and kalio. The protein digestibility decreased in rendang compare to fresh meat and kalio and the amino acid content is decreased in rendang compare to fresh meat and kalio. The protein band is increased from fresh meat to kalio and rendang, where in fresh meat have 15 protein bands, 16 in kalio and 17 in rendang...|$|R

50|$|Sautéed {{reindeer}} (poronkäristys in Finnish, renskav in Swedish, finnbiff in Norwegian, báistebiđus in Sami) {{is perhaps}} the best known traditional meal from Lapland, especially in Finland, Sweden, Norway and Russia. Usually steak or {{the back of the}} reindeer is used. It is sliced thinly (easier if frozen rather than only partially thawed), fried in fat (traditionally in reindeer fat, but butter and oil are more common nowadays), spiced with black pepper and salt, and finally some water, cream, or beer is added <b>and</b> <b>cooked</b> <b>until</b> tender. <b>The</b> dish is served with mashed potatoes and lingonberry preserves or, more traditionally, with raw lingonberries mashed with sugar.

Some vinegar is usually added, occasionally with sugar to balance the flavor. Restaurants may offer minced pork that has been fried or chunks of white fish to act as a protein-rich addition to the soup. Finally, an egg is cracked into the hot broth <b>and</b> allowed to <b>cook</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> whites are set and the yolk is warmed through.|$|R
50|$|According to Minangkabau tradition, {{their true}} rendang is the dry one.

5000|$|Cassava {{is heavily}} {{featured}} in the Brazilian cuisine. In the guise of farofa (lightly roasted flour), cassava is combined with rice and beans to make the basic meal of many Brazilians. Farofa is also a frequent side dish to many Brazilian foods including the national dish feijoada, a salted-pork and black-beans stew. The dish vaca atolada ("mud-stranded cow") is a meat <b>and</b> cassava stew, <b>cooked</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> root {{has turned into a}} paste. Pirão is a thick gravy-like gruel prepared by cooking fish bits (such as heads and bones) with cassava flour. Boiled cassava is also made into a popular sweet pudding or [...] "cassava cake".

A popular variation in north India is the Gajar Ka Halwa carrot dessert, which has carrots grated <b>and</b> <b>cooked</b> in milk <b>until</b> <b>the</b> whole mixture is solid, after which nuts and butter are added. Carrot salads are usually made with grated carrots with a seasoning of mustard seeds and green chillies popped in hot oil. Carrots can also be cut in thin strips and added to rice, can form part of a dish of mixed roast vegetables or can be blended with tamarind to make chutney.|$|R

50|$|This dish {{is mainly}} served during Christmas season or for special occasions. The sofrito {{is the most}} {{important}} part of seasoning the rice. In Puerto Rican cooking sofrito, which is used as a base in many recipes, typically consists of the following ingredients: The Caribbean herb known as Recao, cilantro, onions, garlic, aji dulce peppers, cubanelle peppers, and piquillo pepper. The day of cooking the first step is cooking the pigeon peas if they are being prepared from dried form or fresh, although the canned variety are widely available in Latino markets or supermarkets in cities where there is a significant Puerto Rican population. In a separate pot (caldero), annatto (achiote)-infused oil, which gives the rice and ham the dish's distinctive yellow/orange color is then heated. Pork usually in the form of salt pork, ham, or ham hocks is added. Bacon, Salchichon (salami), longaniza, or chorizo can also be used alone or in combination. The sofrito is also sauteed in the oil to release <b>the</b> aromatics <b>and</b> <b>cooked</b> <b>until</b> most of <b>the</b> water has evaporated while stirring gently. Olives, capers, tomato sauce, and bay leaves are then added <b>and</b> <b>cooked</b> <b>until</b> sauce is thick almost to a paste. Rice, pigeon peas, salt, black pepper, cumin, and in some recipes orégano brujo and coriander seeds are then added and stirred until every grain of rice is coated with sofrito. Broth or water is then poured into the pot <b>and</b> <b>cooked</b> on high heat then lowered once boiling starts and covered with a plantain leaf and lid. In the countryside this is cooked over open fire pit.Note: Pigeon peas are believed to have a higher iron content than regular beans.|$|R
50|$|Alkyd {{coatings}} {{are produced}} in two processes; fatty acid {{process and the}} alcoholysis or mono-glyceride process. Higher quality, higher performance alkyds are produced in the fatty acid process where {{the composition of the}} resulting resin can be more precisely controlled. In this process an acid anhydride, a polyol, and an unsaturated fatty acid are combined <b>and</b> <b>cooked</b> together <b>until</b> <b>the</b> product has achieved a predetermined level of viscosity. Penta alkyds are made this way. More economical alkyd resins are produced from the alcoholysis or glyceride process where end product quality control is not as paramount. In this process raw vegetable oil, high in unsaturated component, is combined with additional polyol and heated to cause transesterification of the triglycerides into a mixture of mono- and diglyceride oils. To this resulting mixture acid anhydride is added to build the molecular weight of the resin into roughly the same product as in the fatty acid process. However, the alcoholysis process, also known as the glyceride process, produces a more randomly oriented structure. To remove the water produced as a by-product and to increase the reaction rate, surplus phthalic anhydride was added. Water was thus removed with the unreacted acid by heating the bulk to a temperature needed to do this. It meant that the reaction was not as controllable as would be desired. A new process was introduced, in which Xylene was added to produce an azeotrope with the water. This gave greater control at a lower temperature, this also produced resins at a lower viscosity, useful in making high solids paints; this process was known as the AZO process. In both cases the resulting product is a polyester resin to which pendant drying oil groups are attached. At the conclusion of both processes the resin is purified, diluted in solvent and sold to paint and varnish makers.|$|R
40|$|Recently, starch has {{attracted}} great consideration as a raw material on wood adhesives {{in the wood}} industry. Cassava and sago starchbased adhesive are renewable, biodegradable and environmental friendly product when compared with other petroleum-based adhesives. In this study, different starches-based adhesive has been produced. Mechanical properties of plywood made from Acacia mangium veneers with different starches-based adhesives (cassava and sago) as binder cured at different curing temperatures (100 °C, 120 °C and 140 °C) has been determined. All materials (starch, vinegar, water <b>and</b> glycerol) were <b>cooked</b> <b>and</b> stirred <b>until</b> <b>the</b> mixture reached 70 °C - 80 °C which become sticky and whitish. After that, starch-based adhesives were applied on the veneers by using spreader, and the plywood were pre-pressed for 30 minutes with 20 kg load before hot-press. Cassava starch-based adhesive showed the highest Modulus of Elasticity which was 12410. 56 N/mm 2 than sago starch-based adhesive, while Modulus of Rupture of the cassava starch-based adhesive at 100 °C showed highest mean value at 74. 19 N/mm 2. Sago-starch based adhesive at 140 °C showed the highest shear strength with 1. 11 N/mm 2. In short, cassava and sago starch-based adhesives gave good performance in mechanical properties such as bending for pressed temperature (100 °C and 120 °C), and shear at 140 °C pressed temperature...|$|R
25|$|Italian beef is {{made using}} cuts of beef from the sirloin rear or the top/bottom round wet-roasted in broth with garlic, oregano <b>and</b> spices <b>until</b> <b>cooked</b> throughout. <b>The</b> meat is roasted at medium heat (≤350°), which {{contributes}} to the sandwich’s famous ‘jus’ or gravy. This process can result {{in as much as}} a 45% reduction in yield. The beef is then cooled, sliced thin using a deli slicer, and then reintroduced to its reheated beef broth. The beef then sits in the broth, typically for hours. The inefficiency of this process, however, has started to concern many larger Italian beef producers and retailers. In response, some attempt to achieve higher yields by lowering the cooking temperature and placing the beef into food-grade polyester <b>and</b> nylon <b>cook</b> bags, which changes the outer appearance of the beef. Though this reduced time is sufficient for cooking the beef all the way through, it does not allow the jus to be harvested fully. Because traditional Italian beefs are dipped in the jus from their own roast, when this more efficient method is used, the sandwich’s potency is affected. Some companies even add MSG, phosphates and other additives in attempts to reach for higher yields.|$|R
