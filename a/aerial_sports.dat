25|$|By the 1980s Østfold County Municipality {{was working}} with {{proposals}} for establishing a civilian airport in Østfold. Although the county was home to Rygge Air Station, Østfold did not house any civilian airports. In 1986 the Civil Aviation Administration recommended that an airport be constructed at Rudskogen in Rakkestad. Widerøe stated that they would consider international flights to Gothenburg and Copenhagen. The plans evolved into a center for <b>aerial</b> and motor <b>sports.</b> Rudskogen Motorsenter was being planned as Eastern Norway's main road racing circuit and would be situated next to the airport. The airport would become the basis for sailplanes, hang gliding and parachuting, in addition to recreational aircraft.|$|R

Robida borrowed ideas from Jules Verne. Unlike Verne he was unconcerned with whether his machines could really work, purely interested in the image.In other futuristic illustrated stories Robida depicted many grotesque types of mechanical transport, including submarine pleasure boats, as well as television news, video phones, excursions {{to the moon and}} synthetic food.Other whimsical concepts of his prosperous world of the future included air taxis, translatlantic balloons, <b>aerial</b> hotels, underwater <b>sports</b> and a women-only stock exchange.|$|R
50|$|Detractors of aerial {{advertising}} maintain {{it has a}} highly limited and ineffective scope {{in the age of}} the internet. In particular, they state that the use of aircraft near two major metropolitan regions (NYC and D.C.) tends to be tightly regulated and restricted, and that, at least in the U.S., the use of <b>aerial</b> advertisement over <b>sporting</b> events with 30,000 or more in attendance is prohibited. Aerial advertising planes do fly before the events over the masses of tailgaters. A 2003 article by the Associated Press reports that aerial advertisement companies had lost a preliminary injunction against new federal security regulations, and all data indicate that the use of civilian fixed-wing aircraft over sporting events in the U.S. is forbidden.|$|R
30|$|Sleep {{comprises}} distinct stages: non {{rapid eye movement}}-sleep (NREM), {{divided into}} stages 1, 2, 3, and rapid eye movement (REM) stage. During sleep, metabolic activity is at its lowest point (i.e., slow breathing, low heart rate, and low cerebral blood flow) and the endocrine system increases the secretion of growth hormone via the pituitary gland allowing physiological restitution [18, 19]. Learning and the consolidation of motor memory are associated with slow-wave sleep (i.e., NREM stage 3), REM sleep [20 – 22], and sleep spindles [23] during the night, and result in an overnight plastic reorganization on a systemic level within the brain, including increased activation of the primary motor cortex [24]. There is currently little scientific evidence to support a specific influence of a given type of sport on sleep. Brandt et al. [25] described the perceived sleep quality of elite athletes during a competitive period, and found {{no significant differences between}} sports modalities (individual versus team sport). Conversely, it had been shown previously that athletes from individual sports go to bed earlier, wake up earlier, and obtain less sleep (individual vs team; 6.5 vs 7.0  h) than athletes from team sports [26]. Sleep disorders are also more prevalent in esthetic sports (33 %), while athletes in high risk <b>sports</b> (i.e., sliding, <b>aerial,</b> and motor <b>sports)</b> had significantly less sleep issues than the others [4].|$|R
