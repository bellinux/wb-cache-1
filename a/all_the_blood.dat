In the Vamana Purana too, the Matrikas arise from different parts of Devi and not from male gods although they are described and named after the male deities.|$|E
5|$|Rarely, Banai {{also appears}} in Khandoba's chief legend where he slays the demons Mani and Malla.

Finally, the dog of Khandoba swallows <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood.</b> Rarely, Banai is described as seated behind Khandoba on the horse and fighting with a sword or spear, a role generally assigned to Mhalsa.|$|E

5|$|Oral stories {{continue}} {{the process of}} Sanskritization of Khandoba— his elevation from a folk deity to Shiva, a deity of the classical Hindu pantheon— that was initiated by the texts. Khandoba's wives Mhalsa and Banai are also identified with Shiva's classical Hindu wives Parvati and Ganga. Hegadi Pradhan, the minister and brother-in-law of Khandoba and brother of Lingavat Vani Mhalsa, the faithful dog that helps Khandoba kill the demons, the horse given by Mani and the demon brothers are considered avatars of Vishnu, Krishna, Nandi and the demons Madhu-Kaitabha respectively. Other myth variants narrate that Khandoba defeats a single demon named Manimalla, who offers his white horse, sometimes called Mani, to the god. Other legends depict Mhalsa (or Parvati) and Banai or Banu (or Ganga) as futilely helping Khandoba in the battle to collect the blood of Mani, every drop of which was creating a new demon. Finally, the dog of Khandoba swallows <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood.</b> Sometimes, Mhalsa, or rarely Banai, is described as seated behind Khandoba on the horse and fighting with a sword or spear.|$|E

500|$|Saunders {{went to work}} in {{the logging}} {{industry}} in Gippsland, after which he moved to Sydney, where he was employed by the Austral Bronze Company. Seen by many as a role model and spokesman for Aboriginal Australians, in 1969 Saunders took up a position in the Office of Aboriginal Affairs as one of its first liaison officers. Among his tasks was promulgating information on recently legislated Federal funding for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander businesses and schooling, following up on recommendations made to government departments, and liaising with Aboriginal welfare groups. He later stated, [...] "I felt a sense of leadership of Aboriginal people and a desire {{to do something about the}} Aboriginal situation". His community work was recognised in the Queen's Birthday Honours of June 1971 when he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the Civil Division. He continued to serve with the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in Canberra until retiring in 1980. In July 1985 he was appointed to the Council of the Australian War Memorial, and held this position until his retirement. He was also involved in the RSL, though he fell out with leaders Alf Garland and Bruce Ruxton over Garland's suggestion that Aborigines be blood-tested to determine their entitlement to government benefits. [...] "They can take <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> they want from me," [...] Saunders declared in a 1986 interview, [...] "and they'll never find out what I am– least of all an Aborigine– bloody stupid!" ...|$|E

500|$|In 1993, the American media {{began to}} focus on the mature content of certain video games. Games such as Night Trap for the Sega CD, an add-on, {{received}} unprecedented scrutiny. [...] Issues about Night Trap were brought up in the United Kingdom, with former Sega of Europe development director Mike Brogan noting that [...] "Night Trap got Sega an awful lot of publicity... it was also cited in UK Parliament for being classified as [...] "15" [...] due to its use of real actors." [...] This came at a time when Sega was capitalizing on its image as an edgy company with attitude, and this only reinforced that image. [...] The most controversial title of the year by far was Midway's Mortal Kombat, ported to the Genesis and SNES by Acclaim. In response to public outcry over the game's graphic violence, Nintendo decided to replace the blood in the game with [...] "sweat" [...] and the arcade's gruesome [...] "fatalities" [...] with less violent finishing moves. [...] Sega took a different approach, instituting America's first video game ratings system, the Videogame Rating Council (VRC), for all its current systems. Ratings ranged from the family friendly GA rating to the more mature rating of MA-13, and the adults-only rating of MA-17. With the rating system in place, Sega released its version of Mortal Kombat, appearing to have removed <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> and sweat effects and toning down the finishing moves even more than in the SNES version. However, all the arcade's blood and uncensored finishing moves could be enabled by entering a [...] "Blood Code". This technicality allowed Sega to release the game with a relatively low MA-13 rating. Meanwhile, the tamer SNES version shipped without a rating.|$|E

Another scene involved Rick's group escaping from the slaughterhouse and passing by several crates, one of which read: [...] "Arctic Expedition Horlicks University, Attn: Julia Carpenter". Nicotero, who usually inserts several Easter eggs in the episodes he directs, added this as an homage to the film Creepshow (1982) and its director, George A.
