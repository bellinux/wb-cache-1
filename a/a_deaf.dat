5|$|In June 2010, Anurag Basu {{confirmed}} that his film would feature three lead roles, <b>a</b> <b>deaf</b> and mute man, a mentally challenged girl, and a narrator. With former titles like Khamoshi or Silence, media reports said {{the story was}} grim or dark. However, Basu stated that on the contrary, the film was happy. According to Basu, he paid homage to Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin by adding scenes inspired by the era of silent cinema and using physical comedy in the film, involving silent portions.|$|E
5|$|Ranbir Kapoor {{played the}} role of <b>a</b> <b>deaf</b> and mute man in the film. According to Kapoor, he took {{inspiration}} from screen legends such as the Academy Award winning actor, Roberto Benigni, Charlie Chaplin and his grandfather Raj Kapoor. Due to the protagonist's physical disability, Basu did not want to use any sign-language but, some behavioral patterns in the film. Kapoor described his character as a regular, happy-go-lucky and good hearted guy.|$|E

Webb coached him in lip reading. Following Gilda Radner's death, Wilder and Webb reconnected, and on September 8, 1991, they married. The two lived in Stamford, Connecticut, in the 1734 Colonial home that he had shared with Radner.|$|E

50|$|Disability {{identity}} {{refers to}} the particular disabilities with which an individual identifies. This may be something as obvious as a paraplegic person identifying as such, or something less prominent such as <b>an</b> <b>Deaf</b> person regarding themselves {{as part of a}} local, national, or global community of Deaf People Culture.|$|R
5|$|Around 1350BC, the {{stability}} of the New Kingdom seemed threatened further when Amenhotep IV ascended the throne and instituted a series of radical and chaotic reforms. Changing his name to Akhenaten, he touted the previously obscure sun deity Aten as the supreme deity, suppressed the worship of most other deities, and attacked the power of the temple that had become dominated by the priests of Amun in Thebes, whom he saw as corrupt. Moving the capital to the new city of Akhetaten (modern-day Amarna), Akhenaten turned <b>a</b> <b>deaf</b> ear to events in the Near East (where the Hittites, Mitanni, and Assyrians were vying for control). He was devoted to his new religion and artistic style. After his death, the cult of the Aten was quickly abandoned, the priests of Amun soon regained power and returned the capital to Thebes. Under their influence the subsequent pharaohs Tutankhamun, Ay, Horemheb, and possibly even Neferneferuaten/Nefertiti herself worked to erase all mention of Akhenaten's heresy, now known as the Amarna Period.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata {{in his fourth}} year as Thomaskantor (musical director) in Leipzig. The text {{is based on the}} day's prescribed reading from the Gospel of Mark, the healing of <b>a</b> <b>deaf</b> mute man. The librettist is Georg Christian Lehms, whose poetry Bach had used already in Weimar as the basis for solo cantatas. The text quotes ideas from the gospel and derives from these the analogy that as the tongue of the deaf mute man was opened, the believer should be open to admire God's miraculous deeds. The cantatas for this Sunday have a positive character, which Bach stressed in earlier works for the occasion by including trumpets in the score. In this work, he uses instead an obbligato solo organ in several movements.|$|E
5|$|In 1885, Helena {{made plans}} to move to New York in the United States to join her sister Lena and her husband. Goldman wanted to join her sister, but their father refused to allow it. Despite Helena's offer {{to pay for the}} trip, Abraham turned <b>a</b> <b>deaf</b> ear to their pleas. Desperate, Goldman {{threatened}} to throw herself into the Neva River if she could not go. He finally agreed, and on December 29, 1885, Helena and Emma arrived at New York City's Castle Garden, the entry for immigrants. They settled upstate, living in the Rochester home which Lena had made with her husband Samuel. Fleeing the rising antisemitism of Saint Petersburg, their parents and brothers joined them a year later. Goldman began working as a seamstress, sewing overcoats for more than ten hours a day, earning two and a half dollars a week. She asked for a raise and was denied; she quit and took work at a smaller shop nearby.|$|E

A radio message was sent and {{received}} by Sixth Army at 23:00 that the mission had been a success, {{and that they were}} returning with the rescued prisoners to American lines. After a headcount, it was discovered that POW Edwin Rose, <b>a</b> <b>deaf</b> British soldier, was missing. Mucci dictated that none of the Rangers could be spared to search for him, so he sent several guerrillas {{to do so in the}} morning. It was later learned that Rose had fallen asleep in the latrine before the attack. Rose woke early the next morning, and realized the other prisoners were gone and that he was left behind. Nevertheless, he took the time to shave and put on his best clothes that he had been saving for the day he would be rescued. He walked out of the prison camp, thinking that he would soon be found and led to freedom. Sure enough, Rose was found by passing guerrillas. Arrangements were made for a tank destroyer unit to pick him up and transport him to a hospital.|$|E
