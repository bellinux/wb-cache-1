A CNC SPDT lathe rests atop a high-quality granite base with micrometer surface finish quality. The granite base is placed on air suspension on a solid foundation, keeping its working surface strictly horizontal. The machine tool components are placed on top of the granite base and can be moved with high degree of accuracy using a high-pressure air cushion or hydraulic suspension. The machined element is attached to an <b>air</b> <b>chuck</b> using negative air pressure and is usually centered manually using a micrometer. The chuck itself is separated from the electric motor that spins it by another air suspension.|$|E
5000|$|Presta {{valve stems}} are 6 mm in diameter, whereas Schrader valve stems for bicycle tires are 8 mm, thus {{requiring}} a larger diameter {{hole in a}} bicycle rim. While not a concern on wider bike rims, it will weaken a narrow wheel rim, precluding their use on (road) racing bicycles. Another disadvantage of the Schrader is that the <b>air</b> <b>chuck</b> must depress the spring-loaded pin before air can flow during inflation (and potentially introducing debris into the tube or the seal inside the valve), whereas the Presta valve relies on a small knurled nut to keep it shut. To fill up a bicycle tire with a Presta-valved tube {{at a gas station}} requires an adaptor, while a Schrader-valved tube does not. Bike riders also need to purchase Presta pumps, or more commonly the dual valve capable pumps for both Schrader and Presta valves. As of this point, most CO2 inflators are also Presta only, although some manufacturers are developing Schrader compatible inflator heads which use pressure to open the Schrader valve. Presta valves are also available in a wider variety of stem lengths for aero-bicycle rims. A removable core Presta valve has become common in many applications, specifically tubeless tires where the ability to introduce sealant into the tire through the stem is considered useful.|$|E

40|$|A Pulse Forming Network (PFN), Helical Electromagnetic Launcher (HEML), Command Module (CM), and Calibration Table (CT) {{were built}} and {{evaluated}} for the combined ability to calibrate an accelerometer. The PFN has a maximum stored energy of 19. 25 kJ bank and is fired by a {{silicon controlled rectifier}} (SCR), with appropriate safety precautions. The HEML is constructed out of G- 10 fiberglass and is designed to accelerate 600 grams to 10 meters per second. The CM is microcontroller based running Arduino Software. The CM has a keypad input and 7 segment outputs of the bank voltage and desired voltage. After entering a desired bank voltage, the CM controls the charge of the PFN. When the two voltages are equal it allows the fire button to send a pulse to the SCR to fire the PFN and in turn, the HEML. The HEML projectile's tip hits a target that is held by the CT. The CT consists of a table to hold the PFN and HEML, a vacuum <b>chuck,</b> <b>air</b> bearing, velocity meter and catch pot. The Target is held with the vacuum chuck awaiting impact. After impact, the air bearing allows the target to fall freely for the velocity meter to get an accurate reading. A known acceleration is determined from the known change in velocity of the target. Thus, if an accelerometer {{was attached to the}} target, the measured value can be compared to the known value...|$|R
50|$|Further Narrative on Indy Pace Cars:In 1988 the Indianapolis Motor Speedway chose Oldsmobile to pace “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing”, with retired United States <b>Air</b> Force General <b>Chuck</b> Yeager {{behind the}} wheel. Traditionally a {{manufacturer}} builds many pace car replicas, often thousands. But in 1988 Oldsmobile chose to build only 50 Cutlass Convertible Indy Pace Car editions. All 50 (used on track on race day and in 500 Festival activities) were essentially hand built. General Motors/Oldsmobile contracted Cars and Concepts of Brighton, Michigan to build {{each of these}} 50 unique cars. Following the race 50 very select Oldsmobile dealers were {{given the opportunity to}} purchase one of these cars. The price was set at full invoice price for a standard International Series coupe (~$14,000) plus the cost of the convertible conversion (an additional $13,997). Each was highly optioned including the first ever application of Heads Up Display in an American production vehicle developed by Hughes Electronics. After the 50 were claimed, paid for and delivered to the lucky Olds dealers who said yes, the story of these cars gets more interesting. After the 50 were in the dealers’ hands across the country General Motors discovered some issue with the certification of these one-off models. Each dealer was asked to return them to GM (where they were to be destroyed) and receive full credit of their purchase price. Most of the 50 were returned for credit, but a few dealers objected and kept their cars leaving (by all accounts) less than 10 in the general population. Mr. Thomas Knobloch, a second-generation Oldsmobile dealer in Erie, Pennsylvania was one of those dealers who refused to relinquish his car. He instead held on to it as a collectible. Realizing its incredible rarity and place in both GM/Oldsmobile and Indy 500 history he drove less than 800 mi over his many years of ownership. The Knobloch family sold the car after his death.|$|R
