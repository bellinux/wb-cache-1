5|$|Cindy's remnant low {{moving across}} western and {{northern}} North Carolina {{combined with a}} frontal boundary to produce several supercell thunderstorms. These supercells spawned a number of tornadoes in western North Carolina, at {{the foothills of the}} Appalachian mountains, but their effects were minimal. Continuing north, Cindy brought over 5in (125mm) of rain to areas <b>as</b> <b>distant</b> as Salisbury, Maryland.|$|E
5|$|Music {{was also}} {{appreciated}} in Macedonia. In {{addition to the}} agora, the gymnasium, the theatre, and religious sanctuaries and temples dedicated to Greek gods and goddesses, {{one of the main}} markers of a true Greek city in the empire of Alexander the Great was the presence of an odeon for musical performances. This was the case not only for Alexandria in Egypt, but also cities <b>as</b> <b>distant</b> as Ai-Khanoum in what is now modern-day Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} election, the Referendum Party renamed itself the Referendum Movement. Goldsmith had been {{suffering}} from pancreatic cancer, and had been warned that competing the election would shorten his life. Goldsmith died in Benahavis, Spain on 18 July 1997, and the party disbanded shortly after. Some of its members transformed into the Democracy Movement, a pressure group {{closely associated with the}} former Conservative supporter and multi-millionaire businessman Paul Sykes. The Eurosceptic cause was weakened, however; with Blair's firmly pro-EU government in power, by 1998 the possibility of a referendum on the UK's membership of the EU was considered <b>as</b> <b>distant</b> as it had been in 1995.|$|E

5|$|In April and May 1941, Fusō and Yamashiro were {{attached}} to the 2nd Division of the 1st Fleet, but the two ships {{spent most of the}} war around Japan, mostly at the anchorage at Hashirajima in Hiroshima Bay. When the war started for Japan on 8 December, the division sortied from Hashirajima to the Bonin Islands <b>as</b> <b>distant</b> support for the 1st Air Fleet attacking Pearl Harbor, and returned six days later. On 18 April 1942, they pursued but did not catch the American carrier force that had launched the Doolittle Raid. Commanded by Vice-Admiral Shirō Takasu, the division set sail with the Aleutian Support Group on 28 May, {{at the same time that}} most of the Imperial Fleet began an attack on Midway Island (Operation MI).|$|E
5|$|The 1893–94 {{season was}} the 13th season of {{competitive}} association football and second {{season in the}} Football League played by Small Heath F.C., an English football club based in Birmingham. In 1892–93, the inaugural season of the Football League Second Division, Small Heath had won the divisional championship but failed to gain promotion via the test match system. This year, they finished <b>as</b> <b>distant</b> runners-up in the League, eight points behind Liverpool, but were successful in the test match, defeating Darwen 3–1 to confirm {{their place in the}} First Division for the 1894–95 Football League season. The club struggled financially during the season, and there were suggestions that it might have disbanded had promotion not been secured.|$|E
5|$|Hindenburg was {{the last}} battlecruiser {{completed}} for the Imperial German Navy, and as such had a very short career. She was commissioned 10 May 1917, and was fully operational by 20 October 1917, too late to see any major action in World War I. On 17 November Hindenburg and Moltke, along with the light cruisers of the IIScouting Group, were acting <b>as</b> <b>distant</b> support for German minesweepers off the German coast when they were attacked by British battlecruisers. The raid was brief; by the time Hindenburg and Moltke arrived on the scene, the British ships had broken off the attack and withdrawn. Six days later, Hindenburg replaced Seydlitz as flagship of the IScouting Group. On 23 April 1918, the ship took part in an abortive fleet advance into the North Sea that attempted to intercept an Allied convoy. Moltke sustained mechanical damage while en route, and as a result, Vice Admiral Hipper decided to cancel the operation. On 11 August, Hipper was promoted to Admiral and given command of the entire High Seas Fleet. Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter replaced Hipper as {{the commander of the}} IScouting Group; he raised his flag on Hindenburg the following day.|$|E

Styles of LBK pottery, some of a high quality, were {{discovered}} at the site from local populations as well <b>as</b> from <b>distant</b> lands from the north and east, even as far as 500 km away. Local flint as well <b>as</b> flints from <b>distant</b> sources were also found.|$|R

5|$|In {{the first}} ballot on November 2, 2004, Boustany and Mount {{garnered}} the most votes; Cravins {{was defeated by}} less than two thousand votes. As both fell short of a majority, a second ballot was mandated. In the subsequent campaign, Mount criticized Boustany for favoring {{tax cuts for the}} rich and being indifferent to health care, while Boustany rejected the attacks as false and stressed his willingness to work with Democrats and Independents. Boustany in turn portrayed Mount as liberal and favoring tax increases. Mount criticized Boustany for favoring the privatization of social security, an unpopular position in Louisiana, and <b>as</b> <b>distant</b> from the interests of individual voters. She received endorsements from U.S. Senator John Breaux, who had represented the 7th district for over fourteen years, and Governor Kathleen Blanco. Boustany was helped by Vice President Dick Cheney, who campaigned on his behalf in Lake Charles. Mount, however, was not endorsed by Democratic primary opponent Don Cravins, who complained about the state Democratic Party's endorsement of Mount in a partially party funded mailer that excluded him and which he believed contributed to his narrow loss. Cravins prepared a suit in federal court claiming that the state Democratic Party violated the Voting Rights Act.|$|E

50|$|WUA are {{fundamentally}} a participatory, bottom-up concept. Though they have existed for centuries, {{they have received}} particular attention in recent decades as a development tool.

25|$|Many of {{the flora}} and fauna have a broad {{circumpolar}} distribution in the South Atlantic and South Pacific Oceans. Thus many of the species that occur in Tristan da Cunha appear as far away as New Zealand. For example, the plant species Nertera depressa was first collected in Tristan da Cunha, but has since been recorded in occurrence <b>as</b> far <b>distant</b> <b>as</b> New Zealand.|$|R
50|$|Numerous {{rock art}} sites (the Coso Rock Art District) {{are found in}} the range, left by the ancient Coso People. The prehistoric Coso {{inhabitants}} exported volcanic glass (Coso obsidian) and this highly valued toolstone has been found <b>as</b> far <b>distant</b> <b>as</b> the Channel Islands of California. Little Petroglyph Canyon and Renegade Canyon within the Range are open for guided tours through the Maturango Museum in Ridgecrest, California.|$|R
25|$|Honduras was {{originally}} inhabited by indigenous tribes, {{the most powerful}} of which were the Maya. The western-central part of Honduras was inhabited by the Lenca.

25|$|The {{occupants}} of the Channel Islands became involved in European events of 1938–39 only <b>as</b> <b>distant</b> and worried listeners to the radio and readers of newspapers. The declaration of War by Britain on 3 September 1939 increased the concern, however life in the islands continued much as normal. By spring 1940 the islands were advertising themselves as holiday destinations.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} test these predictions, it is {{necessary}} to reconstruct the primordial abundances as faithfully as possible, for instance by observing astronomical objects in which very little stellar nucleosynthesis has taken place (such as certain dwarf galaxies) or by observing objects that are very far away, and thus can be seen in a very early stage of their evolution (such <b>as</b> <b>distant</b> quasars).|$|E

25|$|In general, animal utterances are {{responses}} to external stimuli, {{and do not}} refer to matters removed in time and space. Matters of relevance at a distance, such <b>as</b> <b>distant</b> food sources, tend to be indicated to other individuals by body language instead, for example wolf activity before a hunt, or the information conveyed in honeybee dance language.It is therefore unclear to what extent utterances are automatic responses {{and to what extent}} deliberate intent plays a part.|$|E
