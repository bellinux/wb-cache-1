5|$|Note {{that many}} optical peaks in diamond accidentally have similar {{spectral}} positions, which causes much confusion among gemologists.

5|$|Reception of the Game Gear was mixed, with {{praise for}} its full-color backlit screen <b>and</b> <b>processing</b> power for its time, criticisms over its large size and short battery life, and {{questions}} over {{the quality of}} its game library.|$|E
50|$|Its core {{business}} is machine tools for flexible sheet metal <b>processing</b> <b>and</b> tube <b>processing.</b> TRUMPF produces machines for punching <b>and</b> forming, laser <b>processing,</b> combined punch <b>and</b> laser <b>processing</b> <b>and</b> bending.|$|R

His award-winning online courseware is used internationally: SIVA - Courseware for Signal, Image, Video <b>and</b> Audio <b>Processing.</b> This online courseware offers broad, deep online curricula for Digital Image <b>and</b> Video <b>Processing</b> <b>and</b> Digital Signal <b>Processing.</b> SIVA includes hundreds of Signal, Image <b>and</b> Video <b>Processing</b> demonstrations delivering live, interactive audio-visual experiences of signal <b>and</b> image <b>processing</b> algorithms.|$|R
5|$|The Dnestr-M {{included}} many improvements {{over the previous}} versions such as {{an increase in the}} pulse length from 200μs to 800μs which increased the range of objects identified, more semiconductors, and many other scanning <b>and</b> <b>processing</b> changes.|$|E
5|$|Another {{chemical}} {{of interest}} found in P.indusiatus is hydroxymethylfurfural, which has attracted attention as a tyrosinase inhibitor. Tyrosinase catalyzes the initial steps of melanogenesis in mammals, and {{is responsible for}} the undesirable browning reactions in damaged fruits during post-harvest handling <b>and</b> <b>processing,</b> and its inhibitors are of interest to the medical, cosmetics, and food industries. Hydroxymethylfurfural, which occurs naturally in several foods, is not associated with serious health risks. P.indusiatus also contains a unique ribonuclease (an enzyme that cuts RNA into smaller components) possessing several biochemical characteristics that differentiate it from other known mushroom ribonucleases.|$|E
5|$|Equally as important, the Union Stockyards {{were founded}} in 1883. Within {{twenty years of}} the {{founding}} of the Union Stockyards in South Omaha, four of the five major meatpacking companies in the United States were located in Omaha. By the 1950s, half the city's workforce was employed in meatpacking <b>and</b> <b>processing.</b> Meatpacking, jobbing and railroads were responsible for most of the growth in the city from the late 19th century through {{the early decades of the}} 20th century.|$|E

5|$|Grouped into cooperatives, women play {{a leading}} role in the island's economy. Notably through microcredit, they engage in fishing-related activities, such as smoking fish <b>and</b> <b>processing</b> shrimp, oysters, and {{shellfish}} in general. As there is no industrial activity on the island (the closest such activity is in Ziguinchor), the island is experiencing a rural exodus of young people. They return to help their parents in the rice fields and participate in religious ceremonies during the dry season, but they tend to settle off the island permanently.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Bahrain {{was named}} the world's fastest growing {{financial}} center by the City of London's Global Financial Centres Index. Bahrain's banking and financial services sector, particularly Islamic banking, {{have benefited from the}} regional boom driven by demand for oil. Petroleum production <b>and</b> <b>processing</b> is Bahrain's most exported product, accounting for 60% of export receipts, 70% of government revenues, and 11% of GDP. Aluminium production is the second most exported product, followed by finance and construction materials.|$|E
5|$|Jabba the Hutt only speaks Huttese on film, but {{his lines}} are subtitled in English. His voice and Huttese-language {{dialogue}} were performed by voice actor Larry Ward, {{whose work is}} not listed in the end credits. A heavy, booming quality was given to Ward's voice by pitching it an octave lower than normal <b>and</b> <b>processing</b> it through a subharmonic generator. A soundtrack of wet, slimy sound effects was recorded to accompany {{the movement of the}} puppet's limbs and mouth.|$|E

5|$|Leaving Puerto Escondido, they {{continued}} {{up the coast}} to Loreto, where they restocked their supplies. They then visited the Coronado Islands, Concepcíon Bay and San Lucas Cove, collecting specimens at each stop. The work was exhausting; Steinbeck wrote in his letters that he had little time for sleep because the collecting and preparation took so long. In the cramped quarters of the boat, all the equipment had {{to be set up}} and stowed each time the boat moved to a new anchorage, which made the work of cataloguing <b>and</b> <b>processing</b> the specimens doubly arduous.|$|E
5|$|Marble {{quarrying}} <b>and</b> <b>processing</b> {{are major}} activities in Romblon. Among {{the most common}} marble products are categorized into the following: novelty items (gifts, ashtray, table bars), furniture (dining tables, baptismal fonts) and construction materials (tiles, balusters, marble chips). Other mineral resources with considerable quantity include nickel ore and gold mostly {{to be found in}} Sibuyan Island. Gold panning and small-scale mining is a lucrative undertaking in Magdiwang.|$|E
5|$|Mining is {{the basis}} of the oblast's economy, and mining {{enterprises}} remain the principal employers in such monotowns as Apatity, Kirovsk, Zapolyarny, Nikel, and Monchegorsk. The Kola Mining and Metallurgical Company, a division of Norilsk Nickel, conducts nickel-, copper-, and platinum-group-metals-mining operations on the peninsula. Other large mining companies include OAO Apatit, which is the largest producer of phosphates in Europe; OAO Olcon, one of the leading producers of iron ore concentrates in Russia; and OAO Kovdorsky GOK, an ore-mining <b>and</b> <b>processing</b> enterprise.|$|E

5|$|The {{municipal}} charter {{was passed}} by the state legislature on February13, 1832.
