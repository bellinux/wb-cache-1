5|$|As a term, neo {{soul was}} coined by Kedar Massenburg of Motown Records {{in the late}} 1990s as a {{marketing}} category following the commercial breakthroughs of artists such as D'Angelo, Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill, and Maxwell. The success of D'Angelo's 1995 debut album Brown Sugar has been regarded by several writers and music critics as inspiration behind the term's origin. While some artists have ignored the label, others have received the designation with controversy because it may seem contrived to music audiences and imply that soul music had ended {{at some point in}} time. In a 2002 interview for Billboard, Massenburg said that genre classifications are often unpopular because they may be suggestive of a short-lived trend. However, although he said neo soul is still essentially soul music, Massenburg felt there was a need to market artists of the genre for listeners to have <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> they were buying.|$|E

500|$|For the 1988 and 1989 seasons, {{the topics}} of love, marriage, and {{childbirth}} were addressed when the show presented a storyline in which the characters Luis and Maria fall in love, marry, and have a child named Gabi. [...] Sonia Manzano, the actress who played Maria, had married and become pregnant; {{according to the book}} Sesame Street Unpaved, published after the show's thirtieth anniversary in 1999, Manzano's real-life experiences gave the show's writers and producers the idea. [...] Before writing began, research was done to gain <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> previous studies had revealed about preschoolers' understanding of love, marriage, and family. [...] The show's staff found that at the time that there was very little relevant research done about children's understanding of these topics, and no books for children had been written about them.

500|$|Partially {{compensating}} for {{the missing}} texts are the physical artifacts that remain from the archaic and classical periods. The story of the circumstances around Troilus' death was a popular theme among pottery painters. (The Beazley Archive website lists 108 items of Attic pottery alone from the 6th to 4th centuries BC containing images of the character.) Troilus also features on other works of art and decorated objects from those times. It is a common practice for those writing about the story of Troilus as it existed in ancient times to use both literary sources and artifacts to build up <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{seems to have been}} the most standard form of the myth and its variants. The brutality of this standard form of the myth is highlighted by commentators such as Alan Sommerstein, an expert on ancient Greek drama, who describes it as [...] "horrific" [...] and [...] "erhaps the most vicious of all the actions traditionally attributed to Achilles." ...|$|E
500|$|Because {{of their}} {{intelligence}} and trainability, California sea lions {{have been used}} by circuses and marine mammal parks to perform various tricks such as throwing and catching balls on their noses, running up ladders, or honking horns in a musical fashion. Trainers reward their animals with fish, which motivates them to perform. For ball balancing, trainers toss a ball at a sea lion so it may accidentally balance it or hold the ball on its nose, thereby gaining <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> to do. A sea lion may go through a year of training before performing a behavior for the public. However, its memory allows it to perform a behavior even after three months of resting. Some organizations, such as the Humane Society of the United States and World Animal Protection, object to using sea lions and other marine mammals for entertainment, claiming the tricks are [...] "exaggerated variations of their natural behaviors" [...] and distract the audience from the animal's unnatural environment. Less entertainment-oriented zoos may still encourage animal play by throwing fish at animals in different directions and providing play equipment.|$|E
500|$|Justice Anthony Kennedy {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion, reversing the Ninth Circuit and holding that the exception {{did not apply}} to this case. The main reason for this finding was the decision that section one's exemption would only be confined to [...] "transportation workers". [...] "The wording of [...] calls for the application of the maxim ejusdem generis, the statutory canon that 'where general words follow specific words in a statutory enumeration, the general words are construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated by the preceding specific words...'". Under this method of reading the statute, {{he would be able to}} reach <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the exemption meant. He wrote, [...] "Under this rule of construction the residual clause should be read to give effect to the terms 'seamen' and 'railroad employees,' and should itself be controlled and defined by reference to the enumerated categories of workers which are recited just before it; the interpretation of the clause pressed by respondent fails to produce these results". Therefore, section one [...] "exempts from the FAA only contracts of employment of transportation workers". Kennedy's decision was joined by four other Justices to create a 5-justice majority.|$|E

On the next album, we decided that we needed to get somebody from [...] that understood where we were coming from." [...] Although Jive Records initially hired Russell Simmons and Larry Smith to produce Escape, commitments in New York kept Simmons from recording sessions. Hutchins had met Smith at Disco Fever in New York City; although they were friends and often discussed music, he said that they did not originally consider working together. Jive Records could not find a producer, and Hutchins asked Smith to come to Europe and produce the album. The producer initially refused for financial reasons, but called Hutchins the following day saying that he needed money to pay a hospital bill for a friend who had his finger tips ripped off. Smith and Hutchins then quickly met to develop music to show to the label, recording the bass for [...] "Five Minutes of Funk".|$|E

2500|$|Claudius Severus, another friend, from a Greek {{family of}} Paphlagonia, gave Marcus <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> these {{philosophers}} stood for.

Maximus is one of Marcus' three most significant friends, alongside Apollonius and Rusticus. He taught Marcus [...] "mastery of self" [...] and [...] "to be cheerful in all circumstances". Unlike Marcus' other friends, Sextus was a professional philosopher, devoted to teaching philosophy. Marcus continued to attend his lectures even after becoming emperor, scandalizing the polite classes of Rome. Catulus is totally unknown outside Marcus' brief words of praise in the Meditations and the notice in the Historia Augusta; Edward Champlin reckons him a senator.|$|E

Kemp stated: [...] "I've got many friends who are in the services, but you never really hear a squaddie giving his point of view. I'd never heard one talk publicly and I wanted to hear that voice." [...] This would be the view of the young men being sent to the foreign climes of Afghanistan from a situation such as being 18 years old and still living at home with mum and dad, as opposed to hearing from officers trained in media relations. The series would examine the experiences of soldiers at home, injured soldiers and the families of serving soldiers. Kemp wanted to ascertain the motivation of the troops, their level of political knowledge about the situation, their views on Muslims. Kemp stated his opinion that the public gaining <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> it's like for the soldiers is a good thing whatever anyone's political views on the war., informing the public what was happening out there and what the soldiers are doing for the people back home who are [...] "fortunate to live in a [...] country".|$|E

[...] (p.128) Rice believes that [...] "the Precession is fundamental to <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> powered the development of Egypt" [...] (p.10), to the extent that [...] "in a sense Egypt as a nation-state and the king of Egypt as a living god are the products of the realisation by the Egyptians of the astronomical changes effected by the immense apparent movement of the heavenly bodies which the Precession implies." [...] (p.56). Rice says that [...] "the evidence that the most refined astronomical observation was practised in Egypt in the third millennium BC (and probably even before that date) is clear from the precision with which the Pyramids at Giza are aligned to the cardinal points, a precision which could only have been achieved by their alignment with the stars. [...] " [...] (p.31) The Egyptians also, says Rice, were [...] "to alter the orientation of a temple when the star on whose position it had originally been set moved its position {{as a consequence of the}} Precession, something which seems to have happened several times during the New Kingdom."

[...] His book An Introduction to the New Testament (1937) is a [...] "skeleton of the course." [...] However, [...] "it does not give the flesh put on that skeleton by the lecturer" [...] (p. ix). [...] It was of course that [...] "flesh" [...] which made the course so interesting, due to Lake's lively imagination and engaging wit. [...] As he himself explains: [...] "The most important thing in a teacher's life is not to impart the knowledge of facts—which can be found much better in books—but to encourage another generation to look steadfastly at the vision which it sees, and to face its own problems in the light of that vision, controlled and guided by <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the past has done or not done" [...] (Paul, His Heritage and Legacy, 1934, p. xii). [...] He seems to have been effective, for James Luther Adams, one of his students during 1924–27, recalls: [...] "It was his characteristic interest to make historical figures come alive, so that we might see their significance today and not merely study them as so many items from a dead past." [...] "Something we all recognized in Kirsopp Lake," [...] writes Adams, [...] "was that he had the imagination of a Sherlock Holmes. [...] He took an almost childlike interest in digging out alternative answers to historical questions ... Students who thought themselves completely secularized and immune to any 'religious nonsense' attended his lectures and heard him publicly burrow down into the biblical concepts, taking as his point of departure something highly imaginative in one of the parables, and then rise up to fly with it. [...] The students used to call his courses 'Kirsopp's Fables.'" ...|$|E
