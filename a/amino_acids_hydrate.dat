40|$|Zinc from {{zinc chelate}} of <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> <b>hydrate</b> would not exert {{additional}} or different adverse effects in target species than those observed for zinc from authorised inorganic sources. Consequently {{it is concluded}} that the zinc chelate of <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> <b>hydrate</b> is a safe source of zinc for all animal species, considering the maximum authorised contents for total zinc in feedingstuffs. The use of zinc chelate of <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> <b>hydrate</b> as feed additive {{is not expected to}} modify the current consumer exposure to zinc. Therefore, no concerns for consumer safety are expected from the use of zinc chelate of <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> <b>hydrate</b> in animal nutrition up to the maximum authorised levels of total zinc in feedingstuffs. The additive should be considered as a skin and eye irritant and, due to its amino acid/peptide component, as a skin sensitiser. The risk of exposure by inhalation would be low. The use of zinc as a feed additive does not pose a direct concern for the soil compartment. However, there is a potential environmental concern related to drainage and run-off of zinc to surface water. Most vulnerable for these processes are acid sandy soils. In order to draw a final conclusion, some further refinement to the assessment of zinc-based feed additives in livestock needs to be considered, for which additional data would be required. The use of zinc-containing feed additives in aquaculture up to maximum authorised zinc level in feeds is not expected to pose an appreciable risk to the environment.

40|$|The use of {{iron chelate}} of <b>amino</b> <b>acids,</b> <b>hydrate,</b> as source of iron is {{considered}} safe for all animal species/categories when used {{up to the}} currently authorised maximum content of total iron in complete feed, {{with the exception of}} bovines and poultry for which the maximum tolerated level is 450 mg/kg complete feed, and pets, for which the maximum tolerated level is 600 mg/kg complete feed. The FEEDAP Panel is not in the position to derive a maximum safe iron concentration in feed for horses or fish. Consumption surveys include iron-containing foodstuffs of animal origin. Since the supplementation of animal feed with iron-containing compounds has not essentially changed during the last decades, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that the iron levels in food of animal origin used in exposure scenarios originated from animals fed iron-supplemented diets. Since iron chelate of <b>amino</b> <b>acids,</b> <b>hydrate,</b> will be used as a substitute for other iron compounds, its use in animal nutrition would not modify consumer exposure to iron. The additive should be considered as a skin, eye and respiratory irritant and, owing to its residual peptide component, as a skin/respiratory sensitiser. Considering the high background concentration of iron in soil and water, the supplementation of feed with iron chelate of <b>amino</b> <b>acids,</b> <b>hydrate,</b> is not expected to pose an environmental risk. Iron chelate of <b>amino</b> <b>acids,</b> <b>hydrate,</b> is an effective source of iron for all animal species and categories.

40|$|Manganese, an {{essential}} trace element, functions as an enzyme activator {{and is a}} constituent of several enzymes. Primary signs of manganese deficiency are impaired growth, skeletal abnormalities, depressed reproductive function, ataxia of the newborn and faults in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Manganese chelate of <b>amino</b> <b>acids,</b> <b>hydrate</b> is considered a safe source of manganese for all animal species/categories, provided that the current maximum total contents of manganese authorised in feed are respected. Dietary manganese {{does not appear to}} cause any adverse effects in consumers at usual intake levels; manganese intake resulting from the consumption of tissues and products of animal origin is low compared with the intake resulting from the consumption of food of plant origin. The use manganese chelate of <b>amino</b> <b>acids,</b> <b>hydrate,</b> does not result in higher manganese deposition in edible tissues and products than that resulting from commonly used inorganic sources. The use of the additive in animal nutrition is of no concern for the safety of consumers, provided that the current maximum total contents of manganese authorised in feed are respected. Handling the additive is a possible hazard to the respiratory tract and the health of users; in the absence of adequate data regarding irritancy to the skin and eyes and dermal sensitisation, the additive should be considered as a potential skin and eye irritant and, owing to its residual peptide component, as a skin/respiratory sensitiser.

40|$|Cupric chelate of <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> <b>hydrate</b> is {{safe for}} all animal species/categories {{up to the}} {{authorised}} maximum of total copper content in complete feed. Consumption surveys include copper from foodstuffs of animal origin. Since the supplementation of animal feed with copper-containing compounds has not essentially changed over the last decade, {{no change in the}} contribution of foodstuffs originating from supplemented animals to the overall copper intake of consumers is expected. No concerns for consumer safety are expected from the use of cupric chelate of <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> <b>hydrate</b> in animal nutrition, which would substitute for other copper sources. The additive should be considered as a skin and eye irritant and, owing to its amino acid/peptide component, as a skin/respiratory sensitiser. Potential risks to soil organisms have been identified {{as a result of the}} application of piglet manure. Levels of copper in other types of manure are too low to create a potential risk within the timescale considered. There might also be a potential environmental concern related to the contamination of sediment resulting from drainage and the run-off of copper to surface water. In order to draw a final conclusion, further model validation is needed and some further refinement to the assessment of copper-based feed additives in livestock needs to be considered, for which additional data would be required. The use of copper-containing additives in aquaculture up to the authorised maximum of total copper content in complete feeds is not expected to pose an appreciable risk to the environment. The extent to which copper-resistant bacteria contribute to the overall antibiotic resistance situation cannot be quantified at present.

40|$|The {{nitrogen}} K-edge {{spectra of}} aqueous proline and diglycine solutions have been measured by total electron yield near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy at neutral and high pH. All observed spectral features {{have been assigned}} by comparison to the recently reported spectrum of aqueous glycine and calculated spectra of isolated <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> and <b>hydrated</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> clusters. The sharp preedge resonances at 401. 3 and 402. 6 eV observed in the spectrum of anionic glycine indicate that the nitrogen terminus is in an “acceptor-only ” configuration, wherein neither amine proton is involved in hydrogen bonding to the solvent, at high pH. The analogous 1 s f ó*NH preedge transitions are absent in the NEXAFS spectrum of anionic proline, implying that the acceptor-only conformation observed in anionic glycine arises from steric shielding induced by free rotation of the amine terminus about the glycine CN bond. Anionic diglycine solutions exhibit a broadened 1 s f ð*CN resonance at 401. 2 eV and a broad shoulder resonance at 403 eV, also suggesting {{the presence of an}} acceptor-only species. Although this assignment is not as unambiguous as for glycine, it implies that the nitrogen terminus of most proteins is capable of existing in an acceptor-only conformation at high pH. The NEXAFS spectrum of zwitterionic lysine solution was also measured, exhibiting features similar to those of both anionic and zwitterionic glycine, and leading us to conclude that the R amine group is present in an acceptor-only configuration, while the end of the butylammonium side chain is fully solvated. 1...|$|R

It is rich in both essential and non-essential <b>amino</b> <b>acids.</b> As most edible legumes (Bhagya et al. 2007), lysine of brebra seed is higher than sulphur <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> (cystine and methonine). Since brebra seed is rich in content of <b>amino</b> <b>acids,</b> it can use as a potential source of protein for human being.|$|R
40|$|Methods of {{measuring}} <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> recycling in Lemna minor are described. The {{extent to which}} the recycling of individual <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> may underestimate protein turnover has been measured for a number of <b>amino</b> <b>acids.</b> The methods have been used to study the relationship between protein turnover and <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> recycling during nitrogen starvation. It is concluded that following the removal of nitrate from the environment, protein turnover is enhanced, the partitioning of <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> between protein synthesis and <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> metabolism is relatively constant, but the total amount of <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> recycling is increased...|$|R
