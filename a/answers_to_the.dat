5|$|An {{example of}} this is the {{psychology}} of perception. Scientists working in this field have discovered general principles of the perception of forms. A law of the psychology of forms says that objects that move in the same direction are perceived as related to each other. This law describes a relation between visual input and mental perceptual states. However, it does not suggest anything about the nature of perceptual states. The laws discovered by psychology are compatible with all the <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mind–body problem already described.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{years after}} the events of Star Fox 64, Krystal looks for <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{destruction}} of her home planet, Cerinia {{and the death of}} her parents. She lands on Krazoa Palace, after receiving a distress call from the planet and discovers that it was attacked by General Scales and the SharpClaw army. Krystal is persuaded by a wounded EarthWalker in the Palace to help by collecting all of the Krazoa Spirits and returning them to the palace, which would supposedly tilt the war in the dinosaurs' favour and stop Scales. However, after releasing the first one, a mysterious being sends Krystal into the spirit's path, trapping her in a floating crystal atop the Krazoa Palace until all the spirits can be returned.|$|E
5|$|Enlightenment {{philosophy}} {{had developed}} Western Europeans’ interest in Greece, or rather in an idealised Ancient Greece, {{the linchpin of}} Antiquity, as it was perceived and taught. The Enlightenment philosophers, for whom the notions of Nature and Reason were so important, believed that these had been the fundamental values of Classical Athens. The Ancient Greek democracies, and above all Athens, became models to emulate. There they searched for <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> political and philosophical problems of their time. Works {{such as those of}} Abbé Barthélemy, Voyage du Jeune Anacharsis (1788), served to fix definitively the image that Europe had of the Aegean.|$|E

5|$|Five {{important}} Upanishad texts, {{according to}} Olivelle – the Jabala plus the Aruni, Laghu-Samnyasa, Kathashruti and Paramahamsa Upanishads – provide different <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{question of when}} someone may renounce the worldly life to lead a monastic one. The Laghu-Samnyasa Upanishad, Kathashruti Upanishad and Paramahamsa Upanishad suggest that a man may renounce after sequentially completing the student, householder and retirement stages of life, and then getting the consent of his elders and direct family members. In contrast, the Jabala Upanishad and Aruni Upanishad assert that the choice is entirely up to the individual, without needing to have completed any stage of life nor requiring the consent of anyone else.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} three years of the war, Coastal Command sank more U-boats than any other service and {{continued}} to hold the technological advantage from 1943. A brief threat, {{in the shape of the}} German Type XXI submarine emerged but was too late to alter the course of the war. Technological <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Type XXI were available in the form of 3-centimetre radar and magnetic anomaly detectors in aircraft. At midnight 4 June 1945, official wartime operations ceased. The last mission was flown by Wing Commander J. Barret DFC, commanding officer of No. 201 Squadron RAF. By that time over 2,000 decorations had been awarded. These included four Victoria Crosses, of whom only one survived the war, 17 George Medals, and 82 Distinguished Service Orders.|$|E

5000|$|The current {{syndicated}} version {{found in}} most daily newspapers (under the official title Jumble, That Scrambled Word Game) has four base anagrams, two of five letters and two of six, followed by a clue {{and a series of}} blank spaces in which <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> clue fits. <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> clue is generally a pun of some sort.
