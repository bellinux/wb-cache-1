5000|$|One of {{the first}} uses of <b>austempered</b> steel was in rifle bolts during World War II. The high impact {{strength}} possible at high hardnesses, and the relatively small section size of the components made <b>austempered</b> steel ideal for this application. Over subsequent decades austempering revolutionized the spring industry followed by clips and clamps. These components, which are usually thin, formed parts, do not require expensive alloys and generally possess better elastic properties than their tempered Martensite counterparts. Eventually <b>austempered</b> steel made {{its way into the}} automotive industry where one of its first uses was in safety critical components. The majority of car seat brackets and seat belt components are made of <b>austempered</b> steel because of its high strength and ductility. [...] These properties allow it to absorb significantly more energy during a crash without the risk of brittle failure. Currently, <b>austempered</b> steel is also used in bearings, mower blades, transmission gear, wave plate, and turf aeration tines. [...] In {{the second half of the}} twentieth century the austempering process began to be applied commercially to cast irons. <b>Austempered</b> Ductile Iron (ADI) was first commercialized in the early 1970s and has since become a major industry.|$|E

50|$|Austempering is heat {{treatment}} that {{is applied to}} ferrous metals, most notably steel and ductile iron. In steel it produces a bainite microstructure whereas in cast irons it produces a structure of acicular ferrite and high carbon, stabilized austenite known as ausferrite. It is primarily used to improve mechanical properties or reduce / eliminate distortion. Austempering is defined by both {{the process and the}} resultant microstructure. Typical austempering process parameters applied to an unsuitable material will not result in the formation of bainite or ausferrite and thus the final product will not be called <b>austempered.</b> Both microstructures may also be produced via other methods. For example, they may be produced as-cast or air cooled with the proper alloy content. These materials are also not referred to as <b>austempered.</b>|$|E
50|$|By {{changing}} the temperature for austenitization, the austempering process can yield different and desired microstructures. A higher austenitization temperature {{can produce a}} higher carbon content in austenite, whereas a lower temperature produces a more uniform distribution of <b>austempered</b> structure. The carbon content in austenite {{as a function of}} austempering time has been established.|$|E
5000|$|During {{hydrogen}} embrittlement, {{hydrogen is}} {{introduced to the}} surface of a metal and individual hydrogen atoms diffuse through the metal. Because the solubility of hydrogen increases at higher temperatures, raising the temperature can increase the diffusion of hydrogen. When assisted by a concentration gradient where there is significantly more hydrogen outside the metal than inside, hydrogen diffusion can occur even at lower temperatures. These individual hydrogen atoms within the metal gradually recombine to form hydrogen molecules, creating pressure from within the metal. This pressure can increase to levels where the metal has reduced ductility, toughness, and tensile strength, up {{to the point where it}} cracks open (hydrogen-induced cracking, or HIC). Though hydrogen atoms embrittle a variety of substances, including steel, aluminium (at high temperatures only), and titanium, hydrogen embrittlement of high-strength steel is of the most importance. <b>Austempered</b> iron is also susceptible, though <b>austempered</b> steel (and possibly other <b>austempered</b> metals) display increased resistance to hydrogen embrittlement. Steel with an ultimate tensile strength of less than 1000 MPa (~145,000 psi) or hardness of less than 30 HRC is not generally considered susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement. In tensile tests carried out on several structural metals under high-pressure molecular hydrogen environment, it has been shown that austenitic stainless steels, aluminium (including alloys), copper (including alloys, e.g. beryllium copper) are not susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement along with a few other metals. [...] As an example of severe hydrogen embrittlement, the elongation at failure of 17-4PH precipitation hardened stainless steel was measured to drop from 17% to only 1.7% when smooth specimens were exposed to high-pressure hydrogen.|$|E
50|$|Austempering {{offers many}} {{manufacturing}} and performance advantages over traditional material/process combinations. It may {{be applied to}} numerous materials, and each combination has its own advantages, which are listed below. One of the advantages that is common to all <b>austempered</b> materials is a lower rate of distortion than for quench and tempering. This can be translated into significant cost savings by adjusting the entire manufacturing process. The most immediate cost savings are realized by machining before heat treatment. There are many such savings possible in the specific case of converting a quench and tempered steel component to <b>austempered</b> ductile iron (ADI). Ductile iron is 10% less dense than steel and can be cast near to net shape, both characteristics that reduce the casting weight. Near net shape casting also reduces the machining cost further, which is already reduced by machining soft ductile iron instead of hardened steel. A lighter finished part reduces freight charges and the streamlined production flow often reduces lead time. In many cases strength and wear resistance can also be improved.|$|E
50|$|Depending on the holding-temperature, {{austempering}} {{can produce}} either upper or lower bainite. Upper bainite is a laminate structure formed at temperatures typically above 350 C {{and is a}} much tougher microstructure. Lower bainite is a needle-like structure, produced at temperatures below 350 °C, and is stronger but much more brittle. In either case, austempering produces greater strength and toughness for a given hardness, which is determined mostly by composition rather than cooling speed, and reduced internal stresses {{which could lead to}} breakage. This produces steel with superior impact resistance. Modern punches and chisels are often <b>austempered.</b> Because austempering does not produce martensite, the steel does not require further tempering.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Single phase bainite {{structure}} {{which is}} {{obtained by the}} conventional austempering treatment reduces the ductility of ductile cast iron. Because of the reduction of ductility {{it is possible to}} worsen the fatigue properties. Therefore, semi <b>austempered</b> ductile iron which is treated from +ϒ is prepared to investigate the static strength and fatigue properties in comparison with fully <b>austempered</b> ductile iron (is treated from ϒ). In spite of semi <b>austempered</b> ductile iron shows the 86 % increase of ductility. Also, semi <b>austempered</b> ductile iron shows the higher fatigue limit and lower fatigue crack growth rate as compared with fully <b>austempered</b> ductile iron. By the fractographical analysis, it is revealed that the ferrite obtained by semi austempering process brings about the plastic deformation(ductile striation) of crack tip and gives the prior path of crack propagation. The relatively low crack growth rate in semi <b>austempered</b> specimen is caused by above fractographical reasons. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Carbidic <b>Austempered</b> Ductile Iron (CADI) is {{a recent}} {{addition}} to the <b>Austempered</b> Ductile Iron (ADI) family. The effect of chills on the microstructure and mechanical properties of CADI was investigated after Austempering. Three samples of chromium alloyed CADI, the first sample without chill, the second sample with bottom chill and the third sample with bottom and side chills were produced in order to evaluate the effect of chills on its mechanical properties. The samples were austenised for 2 hours at 925 ° C and then <b>austempered</b> at 325 ° C for 2 hours in a salt bath furnace. The microstructural features of the as-cast and the <b>austempered</b> CADI samples were analysed using Optical Microscope and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The mechanical properties of the CADI samples (as-cast and <b>austempered)</b> were evaluated for hardness, impact and wear. By austempering at 325 ° C for 2 hours a typical microstructure of bainite was produced in all the three samples. Hardness and wear resistance of <b>austempered</b> samples produced using bottom and side chills were considerably higher than the corresponding values in samples produced without using any chill and also by using only bottom chill. This enhanced mechanical property in the bottom and side chill sample is attributed {{to the presence of}} bainite, carbides and more of uniform fine graphite nodules...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{investigation}} was to examine the influence of dissolved hydrogen on the fatigue crack growth behavior of an <b>austempered</b> low-alloy AISI 4140 steel. The investigation also examined the influence of dissolved hydrogen on the fatigue threshold in this material. The material was tested in two conditions, as-received (cold rolled and annealed) and <b>austempered</b> (austenitized at 882 °C for 1 h and <b>austempered</b> at 332 °C for 1 h). The microstructure of the annealed specimens consisted of a mix of ferrite and fine pearlite; the microstructure of the <b>austempered</b> specimens was lower bainite. Tensile and Compact Tension specimens were prepared. To examine the influence of dissolved hydrogen, two subsets of the CT specimens were charged with hydrogen for three different time periods between 150 and 250 h. All of the CT samples were then subjected to fatigue crack growth tests in the threshold and linear regions at room temperature. The test results indicate that austempering resulted in significant improvement in the yield and tensile strength as well as the fracture toughness of the material. The test results also show that, in the absence of dissolved hydrogen, the crack growth rate in the threshold and linear regions was lower in <b>austempered</b> samples compared to the as-received (annealed) samples. The fatigue threshold was also slightly greater in the <b>austempered</b> samples. In presence of dissolved hydrogen, the crack growth rate was dependent upon the ∆K value. In the low ∆K region (< 30 MPa√m), the presence of dissolved hydrogen caused the crack growth rate to be higher in the <b>austempered</b> samples as compared to annealed samples. Above this value, the crack growth rate was increasingly greater in the annealed specimens when compared to the <b>austempered</b> specimens in presence of dissolved hydrogen. It is concluded that austempering of 4140 steel appears to provide a processing route by which the strength, hardness, and fracture toughness of the material can be increased with little or no degradation in the ductility and fatigue crack growth behavior...|$|E

30|$|TBF steel <b>austempered</b> at {{temperatures}} lower than its Ms indicates higher tensile strength “up to 1552  MPa” {{compared to the}} steel <b>austempered</b> {{at temperatures}} higher than Ms (Fig.  4 a). This is due to its finer lath structure and its bainitic ferrite/martensite (αm) mixed matrix. Tensile strength of this TBF steel is decreased with increasing austempering temperature, from 325 to 350  °C (Fig.  4 a) due to the decrease of martensite lathes in the mixed matrix. The strengthening effect of martensite lathes is more dominant in this steel than a small TRIP effect of (3 %) γr. TBF steel <b>austempered</b> at temperatures lower than Ms exhibits a smaller total elongation compared to that <b>austempered</b> at 425 and 450  °C, higher than the Ms (Fig.  4 b). This is due to steep fall of strain hardening {{at an early stage}} which may be caused by small internal stress hardening and initial martensite hardening resulting from a small volume fraction of second phase (Sugimoto et al. 2000), followed by great decrease of strain hardening at low strain (Fig.  5) which in turn results from insignificant TRIP effect of small γr volume fraction.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the application of}} the electron back scatter diffraction (EBSD) technique to characterise the retained austenite in <b>austempered</b> ductile cast irons.

Conventional metallographic techniques cannot reliably identify the prior austenite grains in <b>austempered</b> microstructures. This can be done by EBSD analysis of the retained austenite.
