5|$|In principle, the {{simultaneous}} occurrence of a Solar eclipse and <b>a</b> <b>transit</b> {{of a planet}} is possible. But these events are extremely rare because of their short durations. The next anticipated simultaneous occurrence of a Solar eclipse and <b>a</b> <b>transit</b> of Mercury will be on July 5, 6757, and a Solar eclipse and <b>a</b> <b>transit</b> of Venus is expected on April 5, 15232.|$|E
5|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{occurrence of}} <b>a</b> <b>transit</b> of Mercury and <b>a</b> <b>transit</b> of Venus does occur, but extremely infrequently. Such an event last occurred on 22 September 373,173 BC and will next occur on 26 July 69,163, {{and again on}} 29 March 224,508. The simultaneous occurrence of a solar eclipse and <b>a</b> <b>transit</b> of Venus is currently possible, but very rare. The next solar eclipse occurring during <b>a</b> <b>transit</b> of Venus will be on 5 April 15,232. The last time a solar eclipse occurred during <b>a</b> <b>transit</b> of Venus was on 1 November 15,607 BC. The day after the Venerean transit of 3 June 1769 there was a total solar eclipse, which was visible in Northern America, Europe and Northern Asia.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>transit</b> of Venus {{across the}} Sun takes place when the planet Venus passes {{directly}} between the Sun and a superior planet, becoming visible against (and hence obscuring {{a small portion}} of) the solar disk. During <b>a</b> <b>transit,</b> Venus {{can be seen from}} Earth as a small black disk moving across the face of the Sun. The duration of such transits is usually several hours (the transit of 2012 lasted 6 hours and 40 minutes). <b>A</b> <b>transit</b> is similar to a solar eclipse by the Moon. While the diameter of Venus is more than 3 times that of the Moon, Venus appears smaller, and travels more slowly across the face of the Sun, because it is much farther away from Earth.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-40 was, at {{the time}} of its discovery, the largest and most evolved star known to host <b>a</b> <b>transiting</b> planet.

5|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the view that}} science rests on foundational assumptions, coherentism asserts that statements are justified by being a part of a coherent system. Or, rather, individual statements cannot be validated on their own: only coherent systems can be justified. A prediction of <b>a</b> <b>transit</b> of Venus is justified by its being coherent with broader beliefs about celestial mechanics and earlier observations. As explained above, observation is a cognitive act. That is, it relies on a pre-existing understanding, a systematic set of beliefs. An observation of <b>a</b> <b>transit</b> of Venus requires a huge range of auxiliary beliefs, such as those that describe the optics of telescopes, the mechanics of the telescope mount, and an understanding of celestial mechanics. If the prediction fails and <b>a</b> <b>transit</b> is not observed, that is likely to occasion an adjustment in the system, a change in some auxiliary assumption, rather than a rejection of the theoretical system.|$|E

This high infrastructural development is necessitated by its role as <b>a</b> <b>transit</b> country for goods and services to Palestine and Iraq. Palestinians use Jordan as <b>a</b> <b>transit</b> country due to the Israeli restrictions and Iraqis use Jordan due to the instability in Iraq.|$|E
5|$|Having {{discovered}} the planet, the astronomers worked to discover <b>a</b> <b>transit</b> event using the Infrared Array Camera of the Spitzer Space Telescope, as ground-based observations could prove difficult if Gliese 3634 b was a rocky planet. While the observations did {{not suggest that}} Gliese 3634 b transited its star, a few orbital parameters were discovered, yielding the planet's true mass, which cannot be collected solely by radial velocity measurements.|$|E

5|$|In 1627, Johannes Kepler {{became the}} first person to predict <b>a</b> <b>transit</b> of Venus, by {{predicting}} the 1631 event. His methods were not sufficiently accurate to predict that the transit would not be visible in most of Europe, and as a consequence, nobody was able to use his prediction to observe the phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|Over {{longer periods}} of time, new series of transits will start and old series will end. Unlike the saros series for lunar eclipses, it is {{possible}} for <b>a</b> <b>transit</b> series to restart after a hiatus. The transit series also vary much more in length than the saros series.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes Venus only grazes the Sun during <b>a</b> <b>transit.</b> In {{this case}} it is {{possible}} that in some areas of the Earth a full transit can be seen while in other regions there is only a partial transit (no second or third contact). The last transit of this type was on 6 December 1631, and the next such transit will occur on 13 December 2611. It is also possible that <b>a</b> <b>transit</b> of Venus can be seen {{in some parts of the}} world as a partial transit, while in others Venus misses the Sun. Such <b>a</b> <b>transit</b> last occurred on 19 November 541 BC, and the next transit of this type will occur on 14 December 2854. These effects occur due to parallax, since the size of the Earth affords different points of view with slightly different lines of sight to Venus and the Sun. It can be demonstrated by closing an eye and holding a finger in front of a smaller more distant object; when you open the other eye and close the first, the finger will no longer be in front of the object.|$|E

5|$|The {{east and}} west wings of the {{building}} once each contained <b>a</b> <b>transit</b> room. Each of the rooms had a mounted transit telescope on a brick pier; the piers are still visible in the basement below the transit rooms. The western transit rooms were converted into office space by the 1920s. The eastern transit rooms were converted to office space more recently.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} {{observations}} and recording of <b>a</b> <b>transit</b> of Venus {{were made in}} 1639 by the English astronomers Jeremiah Horrocks and his friend and correspondent William Crabtree. The pair made their observations independently on 4December that year (24November under the Julian calendar then used in England); Horrocks from Carr House, then {{in the village of}} Much Hoole, Lancashire, and Crabtree from his home in Broughton, near Manchester.|$|E
50|$|From time to time, {{the project}} will observe eclipsing binary stars. Essentially these are stars that orbit each other. Much as a planet can {{interrupt}} the brightness of a star, another star can too. There is a noticeable difference on the light curves. It will appear as <b>a</b> large <b>transit</b> (<b>a</b> large dip) and <b>a</b> smaller <b>transit</b> (<b>a</b> smaller dip).|$|R

5|$|Apart from Zagreb and Vara≈ædin, the A4 {{motorway}} runs near {{a number}} of Croatian cities, and connects {{to the rest of}} the Croatian motorway network east of Zagreb. The motorway route was completed in 2008. The motorway's national significance is reflected in the positive economic impact on the cities and towns it connects, as well as its importance to tourism in Croatia. The genuine importance of the motorway as <b>a</b> <b>transit</b> route will be demonstrated upon completion of proposed expansion of Port of Rijeka and Rijeka transport node, since the A4 represents an integral part of the RijekaZagrebBudapest transport route.|$|E

He sponsored Proposition B to require Muni and other city departments to develop detailed customer service plans. The measure passed with 56.6% of the vote. Newsom sponsored a ballot measure from Rescue Muni; a version of the measure was approved by voters in November 1999.|$|E
5|$|During the First World War {{the estate}} {{was used as}} a {{military}} hospital, and in the Second World War was requisitioned by the War Office and used in turn as <b>a</b> <b>transit</b> camp, RAF HQ and US Army Command HQ. The estate was the venue for the 1936 Royal Show. One of the exhibition buildings, despite its temporary nature, was an innovative piece of modernist architecture still remembered as the Gane Pavilion. It was designed by Bauhaus architect Marcel Breuer as a show house for the Bristol furniture manufacturer Crofton Gane. For most of the 20th century Ashton Court was the venue for the North Somerset Show, however this is now held in Wraxall.|$|E
50|$|Preliminary {{identification}} of possible star candidates {{starts at the}} Haleakala telescope in Hawaii {{by a team of}} professional astronomers. Once they identify a star that dims slightly from time to time, the information is forwarded to a team of amateur astronomers who then investigate for additional evidence suggesting this dimming is caused by <b>a</b> <b>transiting</b> planet. Once enough data is collected, it is forwarded to the University of Texas McDonald Observatory to confirm the presence of <b>a</b> <b>transiting</b> planet by <b>a</b> second team of professional astronomers.|$|R

The Mercury transit occurred as predicted and was observed by Johann Baptist Cysat in Innsbruck, Johannes Remus Quietanus in Rouffach and Pierre Gassendi in Paris, vindicating the Keplerian approach. But their observations threw into question previous theories about the Solar System as Mercury was shown to be much smaller than expected.|$|E
5|$|It was {{initially}} unknown whether 55 Cancri e {{was a small}} gas giant like Neptune or a large rocky terrestrial planet. In 2011, <b>a</b> <b>transit</b> of the planet was confirmed, allowing scientists to calculate its density. At first it was suspected to be a water planet. As initial observations showed no hydrogen in its Lyman-alpha signature during transit, Ehrenreich speculated that its volatile materials might be carbon dioxide instead of water or hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-4b {{was named}} {{because it was}} the first planet {{discovered}} in the orbit of its star, Kepler-4. The star was, in turn, named for the Kepler Mission, a NASA satellite whose purpose is to discover Earth-like planets in a section of the sky between constellations Cygnus and Lyra using the transit method. Using this method, Kepler notes small and steady decreases in a star's brightness that are measured as a planet crosses in front of it. Initially, Kepler-4b was detected as <b>a</b> <b>transit</b> event by the Kepler telescope and considered a Kepler Object of Interest with the designation KOI 7.01.|$|E
