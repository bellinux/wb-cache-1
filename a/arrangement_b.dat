50|$|The current taxonomic {{arrangement}} of the Banksia genus is based on Georges 1999 monograph for the Flora of Australia book series.

50|$|Since 1998, American {{botanist}} Austin Mast {{and co-authors}} have been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence {{data for the}} subtribe Banksiinae, which then comprised genera Banksia and Dryandra. Their analyses suggest a phylogeny that differs greatly from Georges taxonomic <b>arrangement.</b> <b>B.</b> oligantha resolves as sister taxon (that is, next closest relative) to B. ilicifolia, and B. cuneata resolves as sister to these two. This suggests a monophyletic B. subg. Isostylis; yet the clade appears fairly derived (that it, it evolved relatively recently), implying that B. subgenus Isostylis may not merit subgeneric rank.|$|E
50|$|The current taxonomic {{arrangement}} of the genus Banksia is based on botanist Alex Georges 1999 monograph for the Flora of Australia book series. In this <b>arrangement,</b> <b>B.</b> paludosa is placed in Banksia subgenus Banksia, because its inflorescences {{take the form of}} Banksias characteristic flower spikes, section Banksia because of its straight styles, and series Salicinae because its inflorescences are cylindrical. In a morphological cladistic analysis published in 1994, Kevin Thiele placed it in the newly described subseries Integrifoliae, within the series Salicinae. However, this subgrouping of the Salicinae was not supported by George.|$|E

The species was placed near {{the middle of the}} series, between B. attenuata and B. ashbyi, but George also acknowledged that some characters that were not typical of the series: an unusually large pollen-presenter, and some characters similar to those of B. ser.

5000|$|Under Brown's taxonomic <b>arrangement,</b> <b>B.</b> menziesii {{was placed}} in {{subgenus}} Banksia verae, the [...] "True Banksias", because its inflorescence is a typical Banksia flower spike. Banksia verae was renamed Eubanksia by Stephan Endlicher in 1847, and demoted to sectional rank by Carl Meissner in his 1856 classification. Meissner further divided Eubanksia into four series, with B. menziesii placed in series Salicinae. When George Bentham published his 1870 arrangement in Flora Australiensis, he discarded Meissner's series, replacing them with four sections. B. menziesii {{was placed in}} Orthostylis, a somewhat heterogeneous section containing 18 species. This arrangement would stand for over a century.|$|E
