40|$|A {{method for}} calculating the extinction, absorption, and {{scattering}} cross sections of clusters of neighboring spheres for both fixed and random orientations is developed. The analysis employs the superposition for-mulation for radiative interactions among spheres, {{in which the}} total field from the cluster is expressed as a superposition of vector spherical harmonic expansions about each of the spheres in the cluster. Through the use of addition theorems a matrix equation for the expansion coefficients is obtained. Further <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>addition</b> theorems on the inverse of the coefficient matrix is shown to yield analytical expressions for the orientation-averaged total cross sections of the sphere cluster. Calculations of the cross sections of pairs of spheres and fractal aggregates of several spheres are presented. It is found that a dipole representation of the field in each sphere does not adequately predict the absorption cross section of clusters of small-size-parameter spheres when the spheres are highly conducting. For this situation several multipole orders are required for an accurate calculation of the absorption cross section. In addition, the predicted absorption of sphere clusters can be significantly greater than that estimated from {{the sum of the}} isolated-sphere cross sections. 1...|$|E

This paper presents multiplier and accumulator (MAC) architecture is used for high speed arithmetic computation in Binary FFT using selective rotation. By combining multiplication with accumulation and devising a type of carry save adder (CSA). The accumulator has largest delay in MAC was merged into CSA,and the performance was evaluated. The proposed CSA uses Booth algorithm and it has modified for sign extension {{in order to increase}} the bit density of the operand. The CSA propagates least significant bits (LSB) {{to reduce the number of}} input bits in adder. MAC accumulates the intermediate results instead of output of the final adder.

This method is habituated to reduce a computation cost,area and computational complexity. Develop the binary version of FFT, in order to reduce processing overhead.

Postgraduate Program of Sebelas Maret University Surakarta. This {{research}} aims at {{describing how}} utterances with implicature in The Da Vinci Code (a novel) are translated. The research {{focused on the}} types of implicature of the utterances, the techniques applied and the shift pattern of the pragmatic force of the target text {{as well as the}} accuracy and acceptability of the translation. The method applied in this research was descriptive qualitative. The data were obtained by some methods, namely content analysis, questionnaire, and interview. The research is a single case study. The source of data was The Da Vinci Code (a novel) by Dan Brown and its translation by Isma B. Koesalamwardi. This translation research is product oriented. The finding shows that there are four types of implicature, namely assertive, directive, commisive and expressive. The implicatures found in this research are mostly utterances utilizing the maxims of cooperative principles and those of politeness principles. Most of the translations do not have pragmatic shifts but some do. There are 13 translation techniques applied by the translator most of which do not shift the pragmatic force and some of them do. The accuracy rate of the translation is 2. 86 and the acceptability rate is 2. 85. The conclusion states that some of the translations shift the pragmatic force. It is affected by the <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>addition,</b> deletion and explicitation. The accuracy and the acceptability are also affected by the application of the technique. Key words: implicature, translation technique, accuracy, acceptability, pragmatic shift, maxim, cooperative principles, politeness principles. ...|$|E
