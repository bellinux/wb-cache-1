5|$|Agents Edgar Ross (Jim Bentley) and Archer Fordham (David Wilson Barnes) {{refuse to}} let Marston {{return to his}} family until he assists the Bureau in hunting down Dutch van der Linde (Benjamin Byron Davis), the leader of Marston's former gang. Marston learns that Dutch has been forming his own gang, and joins Ross, Fordham and <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>U.S.</b> {{soldiers}} in an attack on Dutch's hideout. During the assault, Marston chases Dutch up to a cliff, where the latter commits suicide by backing off the cliff and falling to his death. Marston is released from his deal with Ross and returns to his ranch where his wife Abigail (Sophie Marzocchi) and son Jack (Josh Blaylock) are waiting. Marston devotes his time tending to the ranch, having sworn to keep {{himself and his family}} away from the outlaw lifestyle forever. He is then suddenly forced to repel a surprise attack from a combined force of soldiers, lawmen and government agents led by Ross. Marston is able to fend off several waves of attackers and get his family to safety but stays behind to hold back the rest. Despite a valiant last stand, he dies after being shot numerous times by Ross and his men, and is buried by his family on the hill overlooking the ranch.|$|E

25|$|When the U.S. {{military}} first {{acknowledged the}} abuse in early 2004, {{much of the}} United States media once again showed little initial interest.

25|$|The secret {{agreement}} was concluded without any Japanese text {{so that it}} could be plausibly denied in Japan. Since only the American officials recorded the oral agreement, not having the agreement recorded in Japanese allowed Japan's leaders to deny its existence without fear that someone would leak a document to prove them wrong. The arrangement also made it appear that the United States alone was responsible for the transit of nuclear munitions through Japan. However, the original agreement document turned up in 1969 during preparation for an updated agreement, when a memorandum was written by <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>U.S.</b> officials from the National Security Council Staff; the Departments of State, Defense, Army, Commerce and Treasury; the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the Central Intelligence Agency; and the United States Information Agency.|$|E

25|$|In October 2002, {{four months}} before the United States invaded Iraq, Ramadan {{suggested}} U.S. President George W. Bush and Saddam Hussein settle their difference in a duel.

Ramadan's offer included the possibility that <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>US</b> officials would face off with a group of Iraqi officials of same or similar rank (President v.

Ramadan proposed that the duel be held in a neutral land, with each party using the same weapons, and with UN Secretary General Kofi Annan presiding as the supervisor.

Alam Gilani has since denounced the newspaper account, asserting that he was merely making light conversation with the journalist; the newspaper, however, stands by its account.
