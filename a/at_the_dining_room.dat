500|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> Diane orders them to {{wait for}} dinner until the turkey is ready. As suppertime is passing, the turkey is still very undercooked and the {{trimmings}} have gone cold. Carla and Norm start blaming {{each other for the}} turkey's slow cooking. Norm throws some of Carla's peas at her, and she then throws carrots back at him. Cliff throws mashed yams at Frasier, who accidentally throws gravy skin back at Woody, intended for Cliff. The whole gang is poised to start a food fight until Diane stands up and tells them loudly to stop. When she is close to scolding them, Sam throws cranberry sauce at her, so the food fight resumes. By the time the food fight ends, the turkey is finally cooked. The gang calms down and decides to eat what they can. Diane comes out of the kitchen and throws a pumpkin pie to spite Sam for throwing cranberry sauce at her. The pie misses Sam but accidentally hits Vera as she enters. Vera tells Norm to fetch his coat, and Norm says, [...] "Yes, dear." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fossey {{was born}} in San Francisco, California, the {{daughter}} of Kathryn [...] "Kitty" [...] (née Kidd), a fashion model, and George E. Fossey III, an insurance agent. Her parents divorced when she was six. Her mother remarried the following year, to businessman Richard Price. Her father tried to keep in full contact, but her mother discouraged it, and all contact was subsequently lost. Fossey's stepfather, Richard Price, never treated her as his own child. He would not allow Fossey to sit <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> table with him or her mother during dinner meals. A man adhering to strict discipline, Richard Price offered Fossey little to no emotional support. Struggling with personal insecurity, Fossey turned to animals {{as a way to}} gain acceptance. Her love for animals began with her first pet goldfish and continued throughout her entire life. At age six, she began horse riding, earning a letter from her school; by her graduation in 1954, Fossey had established herself as an equestrienne.|$|E
60|$|The June roses {{over the}} porch were awake bright and {{early on that}} morning, rejoicing with all their hearts in the {{cloudless}} sunshine, like friendly little neighbors, as they were. Quite flushed with excitement were their ruddy faces, as they swung in the wind, whispering to one another what they had seen, for some peeped in <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> windows where the feast was spread, some climbed up to nod and smile at the sisters as they dressed the bride, others waved a welcome to those who came and went on various errands in garden, porch, and hall, and all, from the rosiest full-blown flower to the palest baby bud, offered their tribute of beauty and fragrance to the gentle mistress who had loved and tended them so long.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} side of the hall is <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> front and <b>the</b> kitchen <b>at</b> <b>the</b> rear. <b>The</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> {{contains}} built-in bookcases of cedar with glass panel doors.|$|R

50|$|Barber {{was married}} twice and fathered five children; 3 sons and 2 daughters. Perhaps fittingly, Barber died peacefully on November 29, 2007, at his farm {{of natural causes}} while sitting <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> table reading a {{cookbook}} with a pot of chicken soup simmering on the stove. He was 84 years old and {{is survived by his}} wife and five children.|$|E
50|$|His major {{scholarly}} pursuits were {{works on}} the Pharisees, a Jewish sect in second Temple times from which modern Jewish tradition developed, and the Sifra, the oldest rabbinic commentary on the book of Leviticus, which was completed in Palestine in the fifth century. Even in his retirement he continued writing, working <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> table of his Riverside Drive apartment to complete several annotated volumes of the Sifra.|$|E

60|$|Van Teyl {{allowed himself}} to be led towards the door. Nikasti, with a due sense of his new duties, glided past them, rang for the lift, and watched them descend. Fischer turned <b>at</b> once towards <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
50|$|Baseman had {{his first}} major art museum retrospective, Gary Baseman: The Door is Always Open, in 2013 at the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles, California. The {{exhibition}} presented more than 300 artworks (including paintings, photographs, toys, sketchbooks, and videos) in an experiential home environment in which guests were invited {{to sit on a}} sofa or <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> table and explore, participate and visit. The Door is Always Open has since traveled to MOCA Taipei, Taiwan (Summer 2014) and to Shanghai chi K11 Art Museum (Winter 2015).|$|E
5000|$|Joshua Bowen Smith {{was born}} in Coatesville, Pennsylvania, in 1813, to an Afro-Indian mother and a British father. He grew up in Philadelphia and was educated on a {{scholarship}} from a Quaker philanthropist. In 1836 he moved to Boston, where he became the headwaiter <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> of the Mount Washington House hotel. There he became acquainted with two influential abolitionists, Senator Charles Sumner and John J. Fatal. For several years {{he worked for the}} catering business of H. R.

5000|$|Another Hitz {{idea was}} a closed circuit radio system, {{similar to the}} {{in-house}} television channels in modern hotels, to advertise services {{in each of his}} hotels. A guest would need only to switch on the radio to learn about the evening's scheduled entertainment and <b>the</b> day's menus. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> hotel <b>dining</b> <b>rooms,</b> Hitz hired a special chef (called a [...] "Tony") to make café diablo and Crêpes Suzette, and to sell the treat for an affordable 50 cents.|$|R
50|$|Suddenly, Arun hears a {{soft voice}} from behind. It is a woman in white saree. She looks pale and has dark kind eyes. She wears no jewels. After a brief introduction, she invites Arun for some {{refreshment}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> station <b>dining</b> <b>room.</b> She takes his hand and leads him away. Arun does not refuse the invitation as he feels {{it would be too}} impolite to reject it. The woman seems to take a pleasure in watching him eat.|$|R
50|$|The film {{opens in}} a fancy {{restaurant}} where {{the husband and}} a woman who is not his wife are polishing off a bottle of wine. Cut to home, where a dejected wife sits <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> table waiting for her husband. She briefly nods off before rousing and checking the wall clock indicating that it's getting late. Cut back to the fancy restaurant, where the husband settles the check with a large wad of bills. The waiter obliges by helping the husband and his lady companion with their hats and coats. The other woman kicks the husbands hat out of his hand.|$|E
5000|$|... "Oh! for {{one breath}} of cool Carthona air, which used so to refresh us after having taken a run round the green, or when at night {{after one of}} these hot windy days, tired and wearied out, we used all to sit <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> window, waiting for the Southerly wind to blow, then what a rush, what a {{scramble}} to get out, and what a glorious run we would have chasing each other round! Ah, then we were happy, at least I was, always looking forward into a bright future every day I thought would bring us more happiness" ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{author has}} stated that he began writing Antiquitas Lost while sitting at Anne Rice's dining room table. Although the author and Ms. Rice were neighbors from 2003 to 2005, they have never met. The author bought Ms. Rice's dining room table from an estate sale at one of her New Orlean's properties, the old St. Elizabeth's orphanage. [...] He {{has stated that}} he hoped working <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> table would bring him luck, and that he {{imagined}} that Ms. Rice may have sat {{at the same table}} while working on one of her Vampire Chronicles books.|$|E

50|$|In 1934, future President Lyndon Johnson met {{his future}} wife, Claudia Taylor, {{for their first}} date <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Driskill <b>dining</b> <b>room.</b> <b>The</b> Johnsons {{continued}} a lifelong love of the Driskill, and stayed there dozens of times {{during the rest of}} their lives. It became his campaign headquarters during his congressional career, especially during his famous 1948 Senate race, and became a favorite place on return trips to Austin during his presidency. He watched the results of the 1964 Presidential Election from its presidential suite and addressed supporters from its ballroom after his victory.|$|R
50|$|In 1936, Margaret Mitchell's Gone With The Wind is {{published}} {{and it is}} an instant nationwide sensation. As all things in Hollywood go, the movie rights are up for grabs and every studio in Hollywood wants it. While having lunch <b>at</b> <b>the</b> MGM <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> Louis B. Mayer is talking to his son-in-law David O. Selznick about the film rights. In time, Selznick establishes his own production company, Selznick International Pictures, and wants his studio to have a film that will cement both its fame and his as well.|$|R
50|$|After {{his flight}} and death, {{his wife and}} {{children}} remained in the house. Sometime almost two decades later, in the 1870s, they sold it to William Fitch, a relative of Ezra Fitch. Later it was the property of county treasurer John Broadhead. During his tenure, {{around the turn of the}} century, the front porch was redone in a Colonial Revival mode and the columns <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> entryway were added. In the early 20th century, Broadhead moved to Connecticut after he was accused of stealing $80-200,000 from the county. At a public auction in 1907 it was sold to Samuel Gray, a grain dealer from Saugerties.|$|E
50|$|In March 1915, Martanda Bhairava Tondaiman, the Raja of Pudukkottai came to Australia on a {{visit and}} checked in at the Hotel Majestic Mansions where he met Molly Fink <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room.</b> He was enamoured by Molly Fink and joined Molly, her mother and sister at Hotel Hydro Majestic near Sydney and {{subsequently}} accompanied them {{when they returned to}} Melbourne. Five months later, Martanda proposed to her and she accepted. The couple got engaged on 6 August 1915 and married on 10 August 1915 at the registrar's office in Melbourne. The newly-wed couple went to San Francisco in August 1915 to see the Panama Exhibition. Martanda returned to India with his Australian bride in October 1915.|$|E
50|$|Štrba uses {{a digital}} camera to capture moments and figures in film and still, which she then colors {{with the aid of}} {{computer}} programs. This digital manipulation provides Štrba’s images with a sense of painterliness and allows her to abandon naturalism and realist details in favor of complex visual textures. She often photographs around the family homes just outside of Zurich or in the Swiss mountains, where they spend many weekends and holidays. The product is a personal and poetically abstract documentation of the life around her, capturing her subjects <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> table, grooming, in the chaos of untidy rooms, or surrounded by nature. Overall, a personal story is told of the intertwined lives and relationships, speaking to memories, reactions, and nostalgic realization.|$|E
50|$|The {{diary of}} a Dutch tourist {{mentions}} the vase in the Piranesi workshop in 1776. Sometime that year it was acquired by Sir John Boyd during his Grand Tour. He was a wealthy West Indies proprietor {{and director of the}} British East India Company, and displayed it in the landscaped grounds of his neo-Palladian mansion Danson House <b>at</b> Bexley, where <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room's</b> wallpaintings took up the vase's Bacchic themes.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned up}} Tower, {{deliberately}} avoiding Dalton Street in its lower part, reached Mr. Bentley's door. The wrinkled, hospitable old darky actually seemed to radiate {{something of the}} personality with which he had so long been associated, and Hodder was conscious of a surge of relief, a return of confidence at sight of him. Yes, Mr. Bentley was <b>at</b> home, in <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room.</b> <b>The</b> rector said he would wait, and not disturb him.|$|R
50|$|The house {{contains}} {{a bird's-eye view}} by an unknown artist showing the house c. 1710, which depicts small tower-gazebos <b>at</b> <b>the</b> angles of its forecourt. In due course, the Brookes failed in the male line and the house descended to Robert Townley Parker of Cuerden, who added the south wing in 1825 and stuccoed the exterior, probably {{to the design of}} Lewis Wyatt, who worked for Parker <b>at</b> Cuerden Hall. <b>The</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> in <b>the</b> early 19th-century wing has inlaid 16th-century panelling brought in from elsewhere.|$|R
50|$|Five years later, in Grand Theft Auto V, Niko is briefly {{mentioned}} by Patrick McReary, {{who says he}} does not know whether Niko is alive or not when remarking on their bank robbery; the other two crew members, Michael Keane and Derrick McReary had died since then, and Packie had lost contact with Niko in the intervening years. Another reference appears {{at the end of the}} game: should Michael survive and find his family <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> table, his son Jimmy is stalking Niko on LifeInvader, a parody of Facebook. Apparently Niko had moved back to Broker in the intervening years in between games and is now working as a taxi driver for Roman's cab service. A closer inspection reveals that Niko has wished Roman a happy birthday, although Rockstar noted that the choice to inadvertently cause Roman's death is not non-canon.|$|E
50|$|Harberton's present {{manager and}} part-owner, Tommy Goodall (born 1933), is Thomas Bridges’s great-grandson, who still manages the estancia with his wife, American {{biologist}} Rae Natalie Prosser, {{with help from}} their daughter and her children. (Though the Bridges name has been daughtered out, there is a Thomas in every generation.) The principal enterprise {{in the 21st century}} is tourism. Visitors can tour the grounds, outbuildings, gardens, cemetery, and a botanical garden with replica Yamana huts. Nearby is the Museo Acatushún de Aves y Mamíferos Marinos Australes of the natural history of the region’s marine mammals and birds. It is also possible to visit Magellanic penguin rookeries at Isla Martillo not far away. Overnight guests can rent a room in the remodeled cookhouse or, with permission, camp on the grounds. Meals are available <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> and shop in the main complex of buildings.|$|E
50|$|After Fred leaves, Grudge {{once again}} hears the record playing upstairs, {{and sees a}} short vision of the {{deceased}} Marley sitting <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> table. Suddenly Grudge finds himself aboard a World War I-era troopship, which is carrying many coffins. A soldier on board introduces himself as the Ghost of Christmas Past (Lawrence) and explains that the ship is carrying the dead of all nations and from all past wars, with more war dead arriving even as he speaks. The Ghost suggests {{that the way to}} stop the killing is to spend more time talking to resolve conflicts, since when talking stops, fighting starts. He and Grudge revisit a scene from Grudge's past in which Grudge, a Navy commander, accompanied by his WAVE driver (Saint), visited a hospital in devastated Hiroshima and saw Japanese schoolchildren whose faces had been destroyed by the atom bomb.|$|E
50|$|On December 16, 1969, Liberal Backbencher Member of the National Assembly Robert Bourassa {{met with}} the {{president}} of Hydro-Québec, Roland Giroux over lunch <b>at</b> <b>the</b> parliamentary <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> in Quebec City. After the meeting Bourassa, who was about to launch a leadership bid for the position left vacant by the resignation of former Premier Jean Lesage, became convinced of the probability and suitability of the project and made the development of James Bay hydroelectricity a major plank of its leadership campaign. Elected as the party leader in January, Bourassa {{went on to win the}} April 29, 1970 general election, and his tenure as Premier of Quebec became closely linked to hydroelectric development in general and with the James Bay project in particular.|$|R
5000|$|Jack meets Hank, who hugs him {{at first}} sight, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{executive}} <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> (which Hank turned into an [...] "Everyone Dining Room"), much to Jack's horror. While eating, Hank convinces Jack to do an employee pitch day, where every employee can pitch their ideas to upper management. The pitch doesn't go well, so Jack pitches an idea of his own to Hank. His idea is the Voice-Activated remote (or [...] "Vo-Act"). Jack's idea is also unsuccessful as the characters on the TV can also control the television. With no apparent choice, he steals Kenneth's idea: the Blah-Bar, {{where there is a}} black bar on the bottom part of the screen which prevents people from seeing anything dirty. Jack tells this to Kenneth and asks him for what he wants, despite the fact that Kenneth wants nothing.|$|R
50|$|Internally {{the timber}} floors were predominately covered with carpet with the {{exception}} of the amenities areas. This was removed in 2010 and the original hoop-pine timber floors were polished and restored. The walls and ceilings are clad with timber tongue and groove boards and the timber joinery to door and window architraves is well crafted. The entry hall and central room have a timber panelled dado and a dressed timber arch announces the entry from the hall to the central room of the house. Ornate carved timber and tile surround fireplaces are located in one of <b>the</b> main <b>rooms</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> entry, <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> and a secondary room on the eastern side of the house.|$|R
