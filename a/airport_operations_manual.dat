WESTDOG's mission was nearly identical to that of SEADOG although WESTDOG's primary focus is earthquakes, but there are minor administrative differences between the two disaster operations groups (DOGs). Unlike SEADOG, joining WESTDOG requires a formal resolution by the airport authority, port authority, city, or county that owns the airport. WESTDOG has a written <b>operations</b> <b>manual</b> and a dedicated website (WESTDOG 2011-2013).|$|R

Moreover, {{it is likely to}} become even more so given the traffic increases which are expected over the next few years. The ground movement problem forms the link between other airside problems, such as arrival sequencing, departure sequencing and gate/stand allocation. This paper provides an overview, categorisation and critical examination of the previous research for ground movement and highlights various important open areas of research. Of particular importance is the question of the integration of various <b>airport</b> <b>operations</b> and their relationships which are considered in this paper.

40|$|With {{airports}} becoming busier {{and often}} struggling with insufficient capacity, {{the efficiency of}} the airports resource utilisation becomes more and more important all over the world. The efficiency may be improved by integration of the <b>airport</b> <b>operations</b> which historically were handled in separation. More effective resource utilisation would not only smooth the <b>airport</b> <b>operation</b> but also should have a positive environmental impact. The gate allocation problem is one of the important <b>airport</b> <b>operations,</b> which is often solved without considering the links with other <b>airport</b> <b>operations.</b> Modelling and analysis of new constraints which allow the ground movement information to be taken into consideration in the allocation planning in advance as well as design of appropriate solution methods are discussed. It is observed that when the additional information from the ground movement is incorporated in the allocation planning process the number of expected routing conflicts, both around gates and on taxiways, drops. This should results in a smoother <b>airport</b> <b>operation</b> during the day of operation. Data from Manchester Airport is used in this thesis to build the model, as well as to test and to validate the solution methods...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} new {{position}} distribution method——Information Flow Configuration Method Based on Fuzzy Clustering Analysis, aiming at improving the precision and reliability of the <b>airport</b> <b>operation</b> command simulation system. It analyzed samples through the fuzzy clustering method, with the operation command information used as the clustering samples, and 7 kinds of information attribute used as clustering index. Then by using Matlab, it realized the cluster of the command information, and the cluster pedigree chart was drawn as well. At last, the correlation coefficient confirms that this approach is feasible in distributing {{the positions of the}} simulation system. Forward The <b>airport</b> <b>operation</b> command center is the key to run an airport, which is in charge of carrying organization, command, cooperation, control and emergency assistance [1]. The <b>airport</b> <b>operation</b> command simulation system is a particular emulation training system on account of the <b>airport</b> <b>operation</b> (see Figure 1), by which can give the <b>airport</b> <b>operation</b> controllers more practical training to improve their occupational skills. This system can help us to realize the goal of "low cost, high efficiency, wide range", and can provide the technical support cultivate and train professional...|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} in closed access. In {{the past few}} decades, air traffic {{problems}} at major airports have been increased significantly and are expected over in the near future, which imposes a high requirement for more efficient cooperation across all <b>airport</b> <b>operations.</b> Thus, determining efficient <b>airport</b> <b>operations</b> is an important and critical problem for airports, airlines, passengers and other stakeholders. In this situation, {{the complexity of the}} problem means that advanced decision support systems are needed to guarantee efficient airside <b>airport</b> <b>operations</b> and to mitigate the environmental impact. The research Integrating and Automating <b>Airport</b> <b>Operations</b> has the main driver to decrease any detrimental effects of <b>airport</b> <b>operations</b> upon the environment. It represents a wide ranging multi-disciplinary and cross-institutional initiative to exploit recent research advances in automated search methodologies and decision support techniques for air operations (and other related areas). This research will build integrated computational models. As a part of the research, developing Human Machine Interface (HMI) is based on the user interface requirements making a platform to link the air operation models together, to build a computer simulation of the airport problem solving environment. The research is funded by EPSRC and focuses on the Manchester Airport...|$|R
