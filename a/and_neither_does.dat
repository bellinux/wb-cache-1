500|$|Icewind Dale IIs {{reception}} {{was generally}} positive. Game Informer hailed it as, [...] "one {{of the best}} RPGs ever released for the PC," [...] and GameSpot called it, [...] "simply a great role-playing game." [...] However, PC Format said, [...] "it's uninspired and uninspiring, giving itself a narrow remit and fulfilling that unspectacularly." [...] Certain reviewers compared Icewind Dale II to Neverwinter Nights. IGN said, [...] " [...] the pace of IWD2 is more varied, its balance better, the gameplay more interesting," [...] and Game Informer considered the interface superior to that of Neverwinter Nights. PC Format said, [...] "in the light of Neverwinter Nights in particular, there’s little that stands out in Icewind Dale II to recommend it," [...] and PC Zone said, [...] "it's not the BG2 killer we had all hoped for <b>and</b> <b>neither</b> <b>does</b> it stack up to Neverwinter Nights." ...|$|E

When speaking about his directorial experience with The Office, Reitman stated that [...] "Anyhow, the whole experience was awesome. They’re all geniuses over there. I didn’t have to contribute much {{at the end of}} the day because they’re all so on their game." [...] He also stated that [...] "Weird moment of production design surprise – There's a three ring binder on Creed's desk with the logo from the Academy of Tobacco Studies that we created for [...] Smoking.

500|$|How to Grow a Woman {{from the}} Ground takes {{influence}} from different genres, “drawing equally from traditional bluegrass, progressive acoustic, and singer/songwriter traditions”, with one critic calling {{the majority of}} the album very “roots oriented”. The album has a bluegrass or progressive bluegrass core; bluegrass mandolinist Ronnie McCoury became the album’s official “bluegrass guru” to ensure that there was “someone who could make sure we didn’t do anything clichéd or trite”. In regard to [...] the album’s style, Thile said that “All in all, How to Grow a Woman from the Ground is a bluegrass record. There are definitely some musical things that are out of the ordinary, but it sounds like a bluegrass record to me. It’s not all like “Brakeman’s Blues,” but “Brakeman’s Blues” doesn’t sound out of place, <b>and</b> <b>neither</b> <b>does</b> “The Beekeeper” sound out of place. It’s all related.” Much of Thile's work on the album was influenced by his divorce, and Thile claims that he could relate to the title of the album, a Tom Brosseau song. Thile said that he [...] "got my ass kicked by the last relationship I was in. This girl just left. It created a pretty serious complex for me. [...] I’ve always been able to talk to girls, but I’m scared of them. I just could relate to it. Like, man if I could just grow one, that would take care of a lot of problems." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{dialogue}} {{begins with}} Meno asking Socrates {{to tell him}} if virtue can be taught. [...] Socrates says {{that he does not}} know what virtue is, <b>and</b> <b>neither</b> <b>does</b> anyone else he knows. Meno responds that, according to Gorgias, virtue is different for different people, that what is virtuous for a man is to conduct himself in the city so that he helps his friends, injures his enemies, and takes care all the while that he personally comes to no harm. [...] Virtue is different for a woman, he says. Her domain is the management of the household, and she is supposed to obey her husband. He says that children (male and female) have their own proper virtue, and so do old men—free or slaves. Socrates objects: there must be some virtue common to all human beings.|$|E

60|$|On {{the present}} occasion, I shall, without further {{discussion}} of the other theories, attempt to contribute something towards the {{understanding and appreciation of}} the Utilitarian or Happiness theory, and towards such proof as it is susceptible of. It is evident that this cannot be proof in the ordinary and popular meaning of the term. Questions of ultimate ends are not amenable to direct proof. Whatever can be proved to be good, must be so by being shown to be a means to something admitted to be good without proof. The medical art is proved to be good, by its conducing to health; but how is it possible to prove that health is good? The art of music is good, for the reason, among others, that it produces pleasure; but what proof is it possible to give that pleasure is good? If, then, it is asserted that there is a comprehensive formula, including all things which are in themselves good, and that whatever else is good, is not so as an end, but as a mean, the formula may be accepted or rejected, but is not a subject of what is commonly understood by proof. We are not, however, to infer that its acceptance or rejection must depend on blind impulse, or arbitrary choice. There is a larger meaning of the word proof, in which this question is as amenable to it as any other of the disputed questions of philosophy. The subject is within the cognizance of the rational faculty; <b>and</b> <b>neither</b> <b>does</b> that faculty deal with it solely in the way of intuition. Considerations may be presented capable of determining the intellect either to give or withhold its assent to the doctrine; and this is equivalent to proof.|$|E
