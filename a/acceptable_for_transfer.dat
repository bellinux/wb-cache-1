40|$|The Department of Energy (DOE) has {{declared}} approximately 38. 2 tonnes of weapons-grade plutonium to be excess {{to the needs}} of national security, 14. 3 tonnes of fuel- and reactor-grade plutonium excess to DOE needs, and anticipates an additional 7 tonnes to be declared excess to national security needs. Of this 59. 5 tonnes, DOE anticipates that ~ 7. 5 tonnes will be dispositioned as spent fuel at the Geologic Repository and ~ 2 tonnes will be declared below the safeguards termination limit and be discarded as TRU waste at WIPP. The remaining 50 tonnes of excess plutonium exists in many forms and locations around the country, and is under the control of several DOE Offices. The Materials Disposition Program (MD) will be receiving materials packaged by these other Programs to disposition in a manor that meets the �spent fuel standard. � For disposition by immobilization, the planned facilities will have only limited capabilities to remove impurities prior to blending the plutonium feedstocks to prepare feed for the plutonium immobilization ceramic formation process, Technical specifications are described here that allow potential feedstocks to be categorized as either <b>acceptable</b> <b>for</b> <b>transfer</b> into the MD Immobilization Process, or unacceptable without additional processing prior to transfer to MD. Understanding the requirements should allow cost benefit analyses to be performed to determine if a specific material should be processed sufficiently shipment to WIPP. Preliminary analyses suggest that about 45 tonnes of this material have impurity concentrations much lower than the immobilization acceptance specifications. In addition, approximately another 3 tonnes can easily be blended with the higher purity feeds to meet the immobilization specifications. Another 1 tonne or so can be processed in the immobilization plutonium conversion area to yield materials that can be blended to provide acceptable feed for immobilization. The remaining 3 tonnes must be excluded in their present form. However, approximately 2 tonnes of this remaining material could be processed in existing DOE facilities to make them acceptable to the immobilization process. This leaves about a tonne that probably should be declared waste and shipped to WIPP. These specifications are written primarily for large lots of material, for example, 100 kg or more of plutonium in the lot. Small lots of material, such as is common for Central Scrap Management Office (CSMO) materials, will have to be handled on a case by case basis...|$|E
40|$|Routing {{protocols}} for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) {{have been}} explored extensively in recent years. Much {{of this work}} is targeted at finding a feasible route from a source to a destination without considering current network traffic or application requirements. Therefore, the network may easily become overloaded with too much traffic and the application has no way to improve its performance under a given network traffic condition. While this may be <b>acceptable</b> <b>for</b> data <b>transfer,</b> many real-time applications require quality-of-service (QoS) support from the network. We believe that such QoS support {{can be achieved by}} either finding a route to satisfy the application requirements or offering network feedback to the application when the requirements cannot be met. We propose a QoS-aware routing protocol that incorporates an admission control scheme and a feedback scheme to meet the QoS requirements of real-time applications. The novel part of this QoS-aware routing protocol is the use of the approximate bandwidth estimation to react to network traffic. Our approach implements these schemes by using two bandwidth estimation methods to find the residual bandwidth available at each node to support new streams. We simulate our QoS-aware routing protocol for nodes running the IEEE 802. 11 medium access control. Results of our experiments show that the packet delivery ratio increases greatly, and packet delay and energy dissipation decrease significantly, while the overall end-to-end throughput is not impacted, compared with routing protocols that do not provide QoS support...|$|R
40|$|Tests {{have been}} {{conducted}} to determine if satisfactory mass transfer performance is achieved using a fully pumping 5 -cm centrifugal contactor under conditions present in the Caustic-Side Solvent Extraction (CSSX) process. Tests utilized a commercially available contactor that had been modified by installation of a rotor housing bottom that had straight radial vanes on the process side. As received from the vendor, the housing bottom was equipped with curved (impeller-type) vanes that were intended to promote phase separation by minimizing mixing of influent solutions. Stage efficiencies exceeding 85 % were obtained under conditions, present in the extraction section of the CSSX flowsheet. Under CSSX stripping conditions the stage efficiency exceeded 90 %. In both cases, the efficiencies obtained exceed the minimum requirement <b>for</b> <b>acceptable</b> <b>transfer</b> of cesium in the CSSX process...|$|R
40|$|Objective This paper {{focused on}} optimal stress {{distribution}} in the mandibular bone surrounding a dental implant and {{is devoted to the}} development of a modified Osteoplant&# 174; implant type in order to minimize stress concentration in the bone-implant interface. Material and Methods This study investigated 0. 4 mm thick layers of two elastomeric stress barriers incorporated into the dental implant using 3 -D finite element analysis. Results Overall, this proposed implant provoked lower load transfer in bone-implant interface due to the effect of the elastomers as stress absorbers. The stress level in the bone was reduced between 28 % and 42 % for three load cases: 75 N, 60 N and 27 N in corono-apical, linguo-buccal and disto-mesial direction, respectively. Conclusion The proposed model provided an <b>acceptable</b> solution <b>for</b> load <b>transfer</b> reduction to the mandible.

40|$|Key words：valuing natural resources；Meta-regression analysis；international benefit transfer; The {{validity}} test Abstract: In {{the recent}} years benefit transfer method {{has become a}} hot research area {{in the evaluation of}} non-market natural resources. Amide a variety of adopted research methodologies,Meta-regression benefit transfer method has become a mostly used one. In this paper, a large dataset based on the empirical non-market valuation study results reported in the United States was analyzed. This dataset is used to estimate a meta-regression model that was used to predict the corresponding recreation resources and activities values in China. The convergent validity of the meta-analytic international benefit transfer is tested against the observed recreation activity values in China. In the process, a relative percentage error indicator, paired t-test, and the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test are used. The mean benefit transfer error is 18. 74 %, an <b>acceptable</b> value <b>for</b> international <b>transfer.</b> These results suggest that the international benefit transfer could be reliably used in valuing outdoor recreational activities in China...|$|R
40|$|Routing {{protocols}} for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) {{have been}} explored extensively in recent years. Much {{of this work}} is targeted at finding a feasible route from a source to a destination without considering current network traffic or application requirements. Therefore, the network may easily become overloaded with too much traffic and the application has no way to improve its performance under a given network traffic condition. While this may be <b>acceptable</b> <b>for</b> data <b>transfer,</b> many real-time applications require Quality-of-Service (QoS) support from the network. The main idea of the proposal is that QoS support can be achieved more efficiently by considering the link stability and signal strength of intermediate channels. We propose an on demand QoS routing scheme named signal Stability based QoS Routing (SSQR), that provides QoS support in terms of bandwidth and end to- end delay in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). SSQR is designed over Signal Stability based Adaptive Routing (SSA) and aims to find as well as maintain stable QoS routes in ad hoc network. The SSQR emphasizes on selecting QoS routes that can survive for longer period of time. This is accomplished {{with the help of}} signal stability which consists of signal strength and link stability. The performance of SSQR is extensively investigated by simulation in NS- 2. Our results validate that SSQR represents an important improvement in QoS provisioning in MANET by selecting longer-lived QoS routes in mobile wireless networks.

30|$|As {{described}} above, the {{key chain}} in our scheme serves the dual purpose of ensuring both secrecy and {{authenticity of the}} broadcast data. The nonforgeability of the successor key in a received packet derives from {{the authenticity of the}} contents of that packet; this necessitates the more sophisticated OCB block cipher encryption that prohibits any part of the broadcast message from being modified without also modifying the part that holds the successor key. In spite of its increased complexity, the advantage of this approach is that the authentication mechanism is decoupled from the actual broadcast data itself, which is particularly useful in scenarios where the broadcast data is not known before hand. By contrast, the broadcast authentication schemes proposed in [6 – 9] compute a hash of the broadcast data itself, with the initial hash being digitally signed. While such an approach is <b>acceptable</b> <b>for</b> bulk data <b>transfer</b> applications (such as network programming), where the cost of initial secure key exchange can be amortised over the broadcast, it is not efficient for applications that require dynamic or short broadcast messages to be sent at regular or irregular intervals, as may occur in battlefield control and asset monitoring applications.|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{determine}} {{perceptions of}} acceptable conducts amongst under and postgraduate optometry {{students and to}} compare them with students from other disciplines. MethodsStudents (under/postgraduate) of optometry (n= 156) and other courses (n= 54) from University of Minho participated in a voluntary online questionnaire about perception of conducts, classifying as acceptable or unacceptable 15 academic or professional scenarios. Results 210 questionnaires were analyzed. Differences in perceptions were found between optometry under and postgraduates in scenario 5, Chi-square(2, 156) = 4. 3, p= 0. 038, and scenario 7, Chi-square(2, 156) = 7. 0, p= 0. 008 (both with cheating more <b>acceptable</b> <b>for</b> postgrads). Differences between under and postgraduates from other courses were found in scenario 9 (taking supplies from classroom more <b>acceptable</b> <b>for</b> undergrads), Chi-square(1, 54) = 5. 0, p= 0. 025, and scenario 14 (forging a signature more <b>acceptable</b> <b>for</b> postgrads), Chi-square(1, 54) = 3. 9, p= 0. 046. Differences between optometry and other courses undergraduates were observed in scenario 2 (plagiarism more <b>acceptable</b> <b>for</b> optometry undergrads), Chi-square(1, 154) = 8. 3, p= 0. 004 and scenario 9 (taking supplies from classroom more <b>acceptable</b> <b>for</b> other undergrads), chi-square(1, 54) = 7. 8, p= 0. 005. Differences between optometry and other courses postgraduates were observed in scenario 7, Chi-square(1, 56) = 5. 8, p= 0. 016, scenario 10 (both with cheating more <b>acceptable</b> <b>for</b> optometry postgrads), chi-square(1, 54) = 8. 1, p= 0. 004 and scenario 14 (forging a signature more <b>acceptable</b> <b>for</b> other postgrads), Chi-square(1, 54) = 6. 1, p= 0. 026. ConclusionAcademic misconducts were mainly considered more acceptable than professional misconducts. Our results show that perceptions of acceptable conducts amongst optometry students are not very different from other students, and, against our initial prediction, do not show a general change in misconduct perception when students become more mature.
