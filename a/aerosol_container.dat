This paper {{focuses on}} a three-piece steel <b>aerosol</b> <b>container</b> {{deformation}} and burst pressure comparison and tries to point out some topics which could help to improve pressure resistance of an <b>aerosol</b> <b>container.</b> Different material thicknesses are tested {{to find out which}} one could improve the overall <b>aerosol</b> <b>container</b> performance the most. This research shows that a thinner material can give satisfying pressure resistance results what is important when trying to reduce material costs but further research will be needed to get necessary knowledge of deformation-burst schemes in depth...|$|E
40|$|A {{process and}} {{assembly}} determines the charge state of an <b>aerosol</b> <b>container.</b> The novelty is that: (a) the process determines {{the concentration of}} neutral particles {{in relation to the}} total aerosol particle concentration; (b) the respective concentrations are determined either alternately or simultaneously; (c) the defined aerosol charge condition can then be influenced using an ion source {{on the basis of the}} measurements taken by subjecting the aerosol to positive and negative charges; (d) the required concentration of the neutral particles can be adjusted using a high voltage electric field passed through the aerosol, separating the charged particles from the neutral particles. Also claimed is a suitable assembly in which the aerosol is contained in a chamber (1) between two high voltage electrodes (2, 3). Aerosol particles enter through an inlet (4) and are discharged (6) past a measuring instrument (5). USE - The process and assembly determine the charge state of an aerosol in a cont ainer. ADVANTAGE - The process is simple, reliable, and of low-cost...|$|E

40|$|Development of new {{technologies}} in can making industry is mainly focussed on Light-weighting combined with a better material utilisation. Regarding three piece aerosol cans this {{will end up in}} new challenges for the can design and related can production technology. Within this paper the development process of new laser welded tin plate cans will be presented. The development of the <b>aerosol</b> <b>container</b> was supported by finite element calculations (FEM) taking into account high-strength tinplate materials and considering Standard Loadcases like “axial loading” and “pressure loading”. The component geometries (dome, can body and bottom) have been optimised by simulations and DOE-methods. As {{the top and bottom of}} the can are laser welded instead of fitted with a traditional seam, there is a clear reduction in the material used. Material savings of up to 30 % compared to state of the art 3 -piece cans are achievable. Furthermore the application and development of toolings and machines for the new production technology has been taken into account. By using the latest laser welding technology, we have managed to save on material, thereby reducing the cost of the can. With the new look of a mono block can and great decorating opportunities a process for producing premium tinplate steel cans was developed. Flat tops can be applied as well as small caps. Sleeve labels and digital printing are graphical packaging options as well as traditional printing...|$|E
40|$|Charlotte Gray’s article “Second-hand-smoke {{story goes}} {{up in flames}} ” (CMAJ 1998; 158 [9]: 1178 - 80) {{demonstrated}} how entirely debased the pro-smoking lobby can be, and it also outlined the problems that can arise when scientific reasoning is ap-plied to what is primarily an ethical problem. To demonstrate just how un-sound arguments in favour of smoking in public can be, complete the follow-ing simple thought experiment. Imagine finding a novel carcino-gen that at modest levels clearly, {{in the words of}} the tobacco industry, is only “associated ” with lung cancer in animals and humans when inhaled as an aerosol. Reduce the concentration down a notch or two, and then pack-age the carcinogen in an inert and harmless base in an <b>aerosol</b> <b>container.</b> This new product can be marketed as Carcinogen-in-a-Can (CIAC). It is simple to use the product. When people near you light up, sim-ply whip out your CIAC and spray it liberally in their direction, providing the necessary reassurance that al-though the agent has been associated with lung cancer in rats and humans, studies to date have not conclusively demonstrated that the agent causes cancer when inhaled at low levels. In the event that low levels are shown to be harmful, you can simply reduce the concentration of the product, ar-guing once again that it is now safe. It is possible that the smokers near you will be upset by your apparently thoughtless and self-centred behav-iour, but they will undoubtedly be re-lieved to hear that this senseless and ill-mannered act gives you substantial enjoyment. (The more individuals who use CIAC, the more acceptable its use will become.) To argue that smokers should have a “right ” to expose others to a known carcinogen simply to satisfy their de-sire for a cigarette defies any system of ethical reasoning. In a civilized so-ciety, the ability of any individual to interfere with the well-being of an-other stops at the skin — which is why there never has been and never will be a rational argument in favour of smokers having a widespread right to smoke in public...|$|E
40|$|Title page of {{electronic}} version is not identical to title page in bound hard copy. The Australian brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) is a wildlife reservoir of tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis) in New Zealand. The disease is endemic over {{one third of}} the country. Possum control operations have reduced the prevalence of disease in livestock but have not fully controlled infection in wildlife or geographic spread of the disease. The disease is transmitted to livestock when they investigate the unusual behaviour of terminally ill possums. Reduction of disease incidence in possums through vaccination with bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) has shown promise both in pen trials and field studies. Integration of vaccination into existing control programmes may reduce transmission of tuberculosis among possums, and from possums to livestock. There are two parts to this thesis. Part one is a longitudinal, behavioural study of tuberculous and nontuberculous wild possums. Part two is a description of an aerosol delivery device (aerosol vaccinator) designed to administer aerosolised BCG vaccine to possums in the wild, and a record of its progressive development. The aim of part one was to identify aspects of behaviour of tuberculous possums that may influence disease transmission to livestock. Twenty two tuberculous and eight healthy possums were observed. Possums were radio tracked weekly and live trapped at bimonthly intervals on a 56 hectare site in the Wairarapa, New Zealand. Generally possums remained within their activity range apart from infrequent long distance forays. Possums were weak, lethargic and uncoordinated during the terminal stages of disease which lasted for one to three weeks. Only three possums made long forays when terminally ill with tuberculosis. The carcasses of 17 tuberculous possums were recovered of which 15 were in dense scrub or on long grass under scrub and two were on pasture. Of these 17 carcasses, 14 were within or near (< 200 m) to their activity range. Most tuberculous possums died in their activity range and in scrub. These possums represent little risk of infection to livestock, but a risk to other wildlife. However, the small number of tuberculous possums that died on pasture present an important risk to livestock. Interactions between diseased and healthy possums during long distance forays may cause considerable geographical spread of tuberculosis. Part two, the development of an aerosol vaccinator, consisted of pen and field trials. The aim of pen trials was to evaluate the willingness of possums to investigate novel objects and the influence of social hierarchy on this investigative behaviour. It also allowed refinements to aerosol vaccinator design. Four captive colonies were used. In each colony most possums (80 %) showed minimal neophobia and would actively investigate novel objects. A small proportion (20 %) would not approach a novel object. A loose social hierarchy existed with one dominant animal and a changeable middle order. In two of the four colonies, there was one possum clearly {{at the bottom of the}} social order. Social hierarchy did not affect the proportion of a colony which could investigate a novel object or vaccinator. However it did effect the order in which individual possums would investigate. The aim of the field trials was to evaluate the efficacy of an aerosol vaccinator with possums in the wild. During five field trials, the proportion of the possum population marked with dye from the device steadily increased and ranged from 0 %– 34 %. Trials were conducted over eight months and during this period a total of 56 % of the study population was marked with dye. Some possums would repeatedly use a vaccinator. These results justify further research into aerosol vaccination of wild possums with BCG. Three key avenues for future research include determining the proportion of a possum population which will use the device, developing an <b>aerosol</b> <b>container</b> suitable for dispensing BCG vaccine and determining whether the combination of vaccinator and aerosol vaccine elicits a protective immune response. The aerosol vaccinator may be use [sic] to deliver aerosolised materials other than BCG to possums. It may also be altered to suit use by other species...|$|E

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the work in}} practically determining how frequently used aerosol- and propane containers are affected at fire exposure from flammable liquids. The tested aerosol- and propane containers were chosen due to common appearance in ordinary grocery- and hardware stores. The tested <b>aerosol</b> <b>containers</b> had a volume range between 15 - 400 ml and the propane containers were filled with 0. 35, 0. 45, 5 and 6 kg of propane. The exposing heat source was burning liquid of heptane which corresponds to fire properties of common available flammable liquids that are for sale in ordinary stores. The study shows that the <b>aerosol</b> <b>containers</b> which are exposed to flames from a flammable liquid explodes within some minutes and develops often fire clouds within {{the vicinity of the}} exploding object. Minor <b>aerosol</b> <b>containers,</b> 15 - 400 ml, normally divide it selves into a few pieces when they explode. When storing several of minor <b>aerosol</b> <b>containers</b> together, unexploded <b>aerosol</b> <b>containers</b> can be expected to act as missiles as adjacent containers explode as they are exposed to flames from flammable liquids. In enclosures, the explosion also results in a significant blast wave. Fire exposed propane containers, named PC 5 (5 kg) and PA 6 (6 kg), releases pressure in different ways. The PC 5 container is made of composite material that seems to be partly combusted at heat exposure with following leakage through the composite material, pressure release through the safety valve cannot be determined to be the only way of releasing pressure at heat exposure. The aluminum container (PA 6) is designed both with a safety valve and a melting fuse. At one of the trials the safety valve opened briefly with a following release of the melting fuse. The opening of the melting fuse resulted in an outflow and pressure release of propane that initially developed a jet flame of 7 – 10 meters length. As the pressure went down, the jet flame decreased in length. The other test with the PA 6 container resulted in a more controlled pressure release by the safety valve during 5 opening intervals...|$|R

To study this problem the F- 4 C and F- 15 aircraft were analyzed to determine their maximum altitude ability in zoom-climb maneuvers. These trajectories must satisfy realistic dynamic pressure and Mach number constraints. Maximum altitudes obtained for the F 4 -C are above 90, 000 feet, and for the F- 15 above 100, 000 feet. Sensitivities of the zoom-climb altitudes were found with respect to several variables including vehicle thrust, initial weight, stratospheric winds and the constraints. A final decision on aircraft selection must be based on mission modification costs and operational considerations balanced against their respective zoom altitude performance capabilities...|$|R
50|$|Lyle D. Goodhue (September 30, 1903 - September 18, 1981) was {{an internationally}} known inventor, {{research}} chemist and entomologist with 105 U. S. and 25 foreign patents.
