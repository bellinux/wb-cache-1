This paper simulates the effect of reddening for the modest case of two main sequence T 1 = 6500 K and T 2 = 5500 K components of a detached eclipsing binary system. It is shown that simply subtracting a constant from measured magnitudes (the approach often used in the field of eclipsing binaries) to account for reddening should be avoided. Simplified treatment of the reddening introduces systematics that reaches ∼ 0. 01 mag for the simulated case, but can be as high as ∼ 0. 2 mag for e. g. B 8 V–K 4 III systems.

40|$|International audienceFirst {{simultaneous}} {{analysis of}} the ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) <b>atmospheric</b> <b>extinctions</b> from SPICAM / Mars Express solar occultations {{in the beginning of}} the northern summer (Ls= 56 - 97 °) is presented. The two SPICAM channels allow sounding of the Martian atmosphere in the spectral range from 0. 118 to 1. 7 μm at the altitudes from 10 to 80 km. Based on Mie scattering theory with adequate refraction indices for dust and H 2 O ice, a bimodal distribution of aerosol has been inferred from the SPICAM measurements. The coarser mode is represented by both H 2 O and dust particles with average radius of 0. 7 and 1. 2 μm, respectively, with number density from 0. 01 to 10 particles in cm 3. Clouds belonging to the aphelion cloud belt have been observed in mid-latitudes in the southern and the northern hemispheres at altitudes of 20 - 30 km. The clouds are formed of large particles, and their opacity in the UV and the IR is below 0. 03. The finer mode with a radius of 0. 04 - 0. 07 μm and a number density from 1 cm- 3 at 60 km to 1, 000 cm- 3 at 20 km has been detected in both hemispheres. In the southern hemisphere the finer mode extends up to 70 km, whereas in the northern hemisphere it is confined below 30 - 40 km. The lack of condensation nuclei is consistent, but could not fully explain the high water supersaturation observed between 30 - 50 km in the same northern hemisphere dataset [Maltagliati et al., 2011]. The average size of the fine mode (∼ 50 nm) and the large number density (up to 1, 000 cm- 3) most likely corresponds to Aitken particles (r< 0. 1 μm). This mode is unstable against coagulation and requires a continuous source of particles to be maintained, at least one order of magnitude more than estimations for the meteoric flux. A possible source is the dust lifting from the surface and dust devils. A detailed microphysical modeling is required to study the probability of survival of the observed bimodal distribution...|$|R
