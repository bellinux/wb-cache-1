5|$|Sabri Khalil al-Banna (May 1937– 16 August 2002), {{known as}} Abu Nidal, was {{the founder of}} Fatah - the Revolutionary Council, a militant Palestinian {{splinter}} group more {{commonly known as the}} <b>Abu</b> <b>Nidal</b> <b>Organization</b> (ANO). At the height of its power in the 1970s and 1980s, the ANO was widely regarded as the most ruthless of the Palestinian groups.|$|E
5|$|As Neerja boards Pan Am 73, it is {{revealed}} that the <b>Abu</b> <b>Nidal</b> <b>organization,</b> a Libyan-sponsored terrorist group, plans to hijack the plane in Karachi. The plane takes off from Mumbai's Sahar International Airport and lands in Karachi, where the four Abu Nidal terrorists, disguised as security officers escorting a Libyan diplomat, hijack the plane. Neerja quickly alerts the cockpit, and the three American pilots escape through the overhead hatch, fleeing to the terminal under fire from the hijackers. The American pilots had {{just enough time to}} escape, as the hijackers did not realize that the cockpit of a Boeing 747 is located upstairs.|$|E
5|$|Like Nasser, Gaddafi favoured the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and his group, Fatah, {{over more}} militant and Marxist Palestinian groups. As the years progressed however, Gaddafi's {{relationship}} with Arafat became strained, with Gaddafi considering him too moderate {{and calling for}} more violent action. Instead he supported militias like the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, As-Sa'iqa, the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front, and the <b>Abu</b> <b>Nidal</b> <b>Organization.</b> He funded the Black September Organization whose members perpetrated the 1972 Munich massacre of Israeli athletes in West Germany, and had the killed militants' bodies flown to Libya for a hero's funeral.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Abu</b> <b>Nidal's</b> <b>organization</b> {{was engaged}} {{in a series of}} {{international}} terrorist incidents aimed at Israel and Western countries. Setting himself up as a freelance contractor, <b>Abu</b> <b>Nidal</b> is believed by the United States Department of State to have ordered attacks in 20 countries, killing or injuring over 900 people. The ANO group's most notorious attacks were on the El Al ticket counters at Rome and Vienna airports in December 1985, when Arab gunmen high on amphetamines opened fire on passengers in simultaneous shootings, killing 18 and wounding 120. Patrick Seale, <b>Abu</b> <b>Nidal's</b> biographer, wrote of the attacks that their [...] "random cruelty marked them as typical <b>Abu</b> <b>Nidal</b> operations." ...|$|R
2500|$|The 1982 Lebanon War ( [...] , Milhemet Levanon Harishona, [...] "the first Lebanon war")—called Operation Peace for Galilee ( [...] Mivtsa Shlom HaGalil or Mivtsa Sheleg;by Israel, {{and later}} known in Israel as the Lebanon War and First Lebanon War, and [...] , Al-ijtiyāḥ, [...] "the invasion") by the Arabs—began on 6 June 1982, when the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) invaded {{southern}} Lebanon, after repeated attacks and counter-attacks between the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) operating in southern Lebanon and the IDF {{that had caused}} civilian casualties {{on both sides of}} the border. The military operation was launched after gunmen from <b>Abu</b> <b>Nidal's</b> <b>organization</b> attempted to assassinate Shlomo Argov, Israel's ambassador to the United Kingdom. Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin blamed <b>Abu</b> <b>Nidal's</b> enemy, the PLO, for the incident, and treated the incident as a casus belli for the invasion.|$|R
5000|$|Lebanon's {{civil war}} began in 1975 when Phalangist gunmen ambushed a bus killing the 27 Palestinian {{passengers}} on board. The {{complexities of the}} war were tied to Lebanon's sectarian political structure dividing Shia and Sunni Muslims and Christians. It was exacerbated by the influx of Palestinian refugees in 1948, and the expulsion of the Palestinian Liberation Front from Jordan after Black September into Lebanon. [...] In 1982 Israel invaded Lebanon {{in the middle of}} the civil war after a gunman from <b>Abu</b> <b>Nidal's</b> <b>organization</b> attempted to assassinate Shlomo Argov. The Israeli Prime Minister blamed the PLO for the incident, and used it as an excuse to begin Operation Peace for Galilee and the 1982 Lebanon War. [...] The aim was to eject the PLO from Lebanon following the 1978 South Lebanon conflict.|$|R
5|$|Prior to the Gulf War in 1990–91, {{when the}} Intifada's {{intensity}} began to wear down, Arafat supported Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait and opposed the US-led coalition attack on Iraq. He made this decision {{without the consent}} of other leading members of Fatah and the PLO. Arafat's top aide Abu Iyad vowed to stay neutral and opposed an alliance with Saddam; On 17 January 1991, Abu Iyad was assassinated by the <b>Abu</b> <b>Nidal</b> <b>Organization.</b> Arafat's decision also severed relations with Egypt and many of the oil-producing Arab states that supported the US-led coalition. Many in the US also used Arafat's position as a reason to disregard his claims to being a partner for peace. After the end of hostilities, many Arab states that backed the coalition cut off funds to the PLO and began providing financial support for the organization's rival Hamas and other Islamist groups. Arafat narrowly escaped death again on 7 April 1992, when an Air Bissau aircraft he was a passenger on crash-landed in the Libyan Desert during a sandstorm. Two pilots and an engineer were killed; Arafat was bruised and shaken.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Abu</b> <b>Nidal</b> <b>Organization</b> {{internal}} executions {{were the}} mass executions {{of members of}} the <b>Abu</b> <b>Nidal</b> <b>Organization</b> and their families by Abu Nidal and key associates during 19871988. The executions took place at a number of locations in Syria, Lebanon and Libya. The number of people executedmostly Palestiniansis estimated at 600.|$|E
25|$|The {{bomb was}} {{apparently}} planted by the <b>Abu</b> <b>Nidal</b> <b>organization,</b> to convince Saudi Arabia to pay protection money to Nidal {{so as to}} avoid attacks on their soil.|$|E
50|$|No group claimed {{responsibility}} for the attack. Nevertheless, one of the assailants was identified as Osama Abdel al-Zomar, an alleged member of the <b>Abu</b> <b>Nidal</b> terrorist <b>organization.</b> Al-Zomar was later on arrested in Greece, for illegal smuggling of explosives.Although al-Zomar was convicted by an Italian court for his part in the 1982 attack (while he was in Greek custody), nevertheless, the Greek authorities denied an Italian extradition request and instead deported him in 1989 to Libya, where <b>Abu</b> <b>Nidal's</b> home base was located, and where he is believed to be living.|$|R
50|$|The 1982 Lebanon {{war began}} on 6 June 1982, when Israel invaded again in direct {{retaliation}} over the assassination attempt by ANO (<b>Abu</b> <b>Nidal's</b> <b>organization,</b> a splinter group from Fatah) on Shlomo Argov, the Israeli {{ambassador to the}} UK, attacking Palestinian military bases and refugee camps affiliated with Palestine Liberation Organization and other Palestinian military movements, including the ANO. During the conflict, over 17,000 Lebanese were killed, and the Israeli army laid siege to Beirut. During the war, fighting also occurred between Israel and Syria. The United States, fearing a widening conflict and the prestige the siege was giving PLO leader Yasser Arafat, got all sides {{to agree to a}} cease-fire and terms for the PLO's withdrawal on 12 August. The predominantly Muslim Multinational Force in Lebanon arrived to keep the peace and ensure PLO withdrawal. Arafat retreated from Beirut on 30 August 1982 and settled in Tunisia.|$|R
2500|$|Israel {{ended the}} ceasefire after an {{assassination}} attempt on the Israeli Ambassador in Britain, Shlomo Argov, in mid-1982 (which was made by <b>Abu</b> <b>Nidal's</b> <b>organization</b> that was ostracized from the PLO). This led Israel to invade Lebanon in the 1982 Lebanon War on June 6, 1982 with the aim to protect the North of Israel from terrorist attacks. IDF invaded Lebanon and even occupied Beirut. To end the siege, the US and European governments brokered an agreement guaranteeing safe passage for Arafat and Fatah – guarded by a multinational force – to exile in Tunis. During the war, Israeli allied Phalangist Christian Arab militias carried out the bloody Sabra and Shatila Massacre in which 700-3,500 unarmed Palestinians {{were killed by the}} Phalangist militias while the Israeli troops surrounded the camps with tanks and checkpoints, monitoring entrances and exits. For its involvement in the Lebanese war and its indirect responsibility for the Sabra and Shatila Massacre, Israel was heavily criticized, including from within. An Israeli Commission of Inquiry found that Israeli military personnel, among them defense minister and future prime minister Ariel Sharon, had several times become aware that a massacre was in progress without taking serious steps to stop it, leading to his resignation as Israel's Defense Minister. In June 1985, Israel withdrew most of its troops from Lebanon, leaving a residual Israeli force and an Israeli-supported militia in southern Lebanon as a [...] "security zone" [...] and buffer against attacks on its northern territory.|$|R
25|$|On 3 June 1982, the <b>Abu</b> <b>Nidal</b> <b>Organization,</b> a {{splinter}} group of Fatah, attempted to assassinate Israeli ambassador Shlomo Argov in London. Israel {{carried out a}} retaliatory aerial attack on PLO and PFLP targets in West Beirut that led to over 100 casualties. The PLO responded by launching a counterattack from Lebanon with rockets and artillery, which constituted a clear violation of the ceasefire.|$|E
25|$|Two months later, {{just after}} the October 1973 Yom Kippur War, during discussions about {{convening}} a peace conference in Geneva, the <b>Abu</b> <b>Nidal</b> <b>Organization</b> (ANO) hijacked a KLM airliner, using {{the name of the}} Arab Nationalist Youth Organization. The operation was intended to send a signal to Fatah not to send representatives to any peace conference. In response, Arafat officially expelled Abu Nidal from Fatah in March 1974, and the rift between the two groups, and the two men, was complete.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Abu</b> <b>Nidal</b> <b>Organization</b> was {{established}} by Sabri Khalil al-Bannah (Abu Nidal), a Palestinian Arab nationalist and a former Ba'ath party member. Al-Bannah established his faction within the PLO, just prior the Black September in Jordan, and following internal disagreements within the PLO. During Fatah's Third Congress in Damascus in 1971, he emerged {{as the leader of}} a leftist alliance against Arafat.|$|E
50|$|After 7 days of {{surveillance}} and monitoring his calls, {{the apartment was}} raided by the DISIP commandos unit, and Atta was arrested, and transferred to Caracas Venezuela.With all the information collected by the surveillance, Atta was interrogated by the Venezuelan DISIP Counterintelligence Department. Venezuelan Counterintelligence officials found a false bottom in his suitcase, finding 2 false US passports, {{and a lot of}} letters hand written by Atta. Addresses, telephone numbers, names, and countries of the <b>Abu</b> <b>Nidal</b> Terrorist <b>Organization</b> were found in the false bottom of his suitcase. The Government of Venezuela deported Atta to the US, and arrested by the FBI. After that, Atta was extradited to Israel in 1990, tried and sentenced to life in prison. The Israeli supreme court later invalidated his extradition and set him free.|$|R
2500|$|... "And, of course, {{sophisticated}} {{delivery systems}} aren't {{required for a}} chemical or biological attack; all that might be required are a small container and one terrorist or Iraqi intelligence operative to deliver it. And that {{is the source of}} our urgent concern about Saddam Hussein's links to international terrorist groups. Over the years, Iraq has provided safe haven to terrorists such as <b>Abu</b> <b>Nidal,</b> whose terror <b>organization</b> carried out more than 90 terrorist attacks in 20 countries that killed or injured nearly 900 people, including 12 Americans. Iraq has also provided safe haven to Abu Abbas, who was responsible for seizing the Achille Lauro and killing an American passenger. And we know that Iraq is continuing to finance terror and gives assistance to groups that use terrorism to undermine Middle East peace." ...|$|R
5|$|Abu Iyad {{appointed}} <b>Abu</b> <b>Nidal</b> in 1968 as the Fatah {{representative in}} Khartoum, Sudan, then (at <b>Abu</b> <b>Nidal's</b> insistence) {{to the same}} position in Baghdad in July 1970, two months before Black September, when over 10 days of fighting King Hussein's army drove the Palestinian fedayeen out of Jordan, {{with the loss of}} thousands of lives. Seale writes that <b>Abu</b> <b>Nidal's</b> absence from Jordan during this period, when it was clear that King Hussein was about to act against the Palestinians, raised suspicion within the movement that <b>Abu</b> <b>Nidal</b> was interested only in saving himself.|$|R
2500|$|On December 20, 1991 both Zein and Maria Isa {{were convicted}} of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. [...] On April 1, 1993, Zein was indicted by the FBI in {{connection}} with his terrorist activities within the <b>Abu</b> <b>Nidal</b> <b>Organization,</b> but the charges were dropped because he was already on death row for his daughter's murder. He later died of diabetes complications on February 17, 1997. Maria's death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment without parole; she died on April 30, 2014, in a Vandalia, Missouri, prison {{at the age of}} 70.|$|E
2500|$|Zein Isa was {{a member}} of the <b>Abu</b> <b>Nidal</b> <b>Organization,</b> which at the time he murdered his daughter, was {{plotting}} to bomb the Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.C.. [...] A crucial factor in his trial was the fact that the FBI had bugged Zein's house on FISA order in connection with his suspected terrorist activities, and as such, had recorded Tina's murder on an audio cassette. [...] This was especially important in confirming the fact that Maria was an active participant in the murder, and that Zein's claim of self-defense against Tina was false.|$|E
2500|$|... 23 September 1983: Gulf Air Flight 771 was {{a flight}} from Karachi, Pakistan to Qatar via Abu Dhabi. While the Boeing 737-200 was on {{approach}} to Abu Dhabi International Airport, a bomb exploded in the baggage compartment. The aircraft crashed in the desert near Mina Jebel Ali between Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the UAE. All seven crew members and 105 passengers died. Most of the fatalities were Pakistani nationals, many returning to jobs in the Gulf after spending the Eid ul-Adha holiday with their families in Pakistan. The bomb was apparently planted by the <b>Abu</b> <b>Nidal</b> <b>Organization,</b> to pressure the Gulf States to pay protection money to Nidal {{so as to avoid}} attacks on their soil.|$|E

2500|$|On 3 June 1982 Israel's {{ambassador}} to the United Kingdom, Shlomo Argov was shot and seriously wounded in London by terrorists belonging to the Iraqi-backed Abu Nidal terrorist organization. The attack was ordered by the Iraqi Intelligence Service. Following the attack, the assassins drove to the Iraqi embassy in London, where they deposited the weapon. In his memoirs, Sharon stated that the attack was [...] "merely the spark that lit the fuse". Israeli prime Minister Begin used this as the [...] "internationally recognized provocation" [...] necessary to invade Lebanon. The fact that the <b>Abu</b> <b>Nidal</b> <b>organization</b> was the longtime rival of PLO, that its head was condemned to death by the PLO court, and that the British police reported that PLO leaders were on the [...] "hit list" [...] of the attackers did not deter Begin. Iraq's motives for the assassination attempt may have been to punish Israel for its destruction of Iraq's nuclear reactor in June 1981, and to provoke a war in Lebanon that Iraqi leaders calculated would be detrimental to the rival Ba'ath regime in Syria—whether Syria intervened to help the PLO or not! ...|$|E
2500|$|As Defense Minister, Sharon {{launched}} {{an invasion of}} Lebanon called Operation Peace for Galilee, later known as the 1982 Lebanon War, following the shooting of Israel's ambassador in London, Shlomo Argov. Although this attempted assassination was in fact perpetrated by the <b>Abu</b> <b>Nidal</b> <b>Organization,</b> possibly with Syrian or Iraqi involvement, the Israeli government justified the invasion by citing 270 terrorist attacks by the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) in Israel, the occupied territories, and the Jordanian and Lebanese border (in addition to 20 attacks on Israeli interests abroad). Sharon intended the operation to eradicate the PLO from its state within a state inside Lebanon, but the war is primarily remembered for the Sabra and Shatila massacre. In a three-day massacre between September 16 and 18, between 460 and 3,500 civilians, mostly Palestinians and Lebanese Shiites, in the Sabra neighborhood and the adjacent Shatila refugee camp {{were killed by the}} Phalanges— Lebanese Maronite Christian militias. Chatila had previously been one of the PLO's three main training camps for foreign terrorists and the main training camp for European terrorists; the Israelis maintained that 2,000 to 3,000 terrorists remained in the camps, but were unwilling to risk the lives of more of their soldiers after the Lebanese army repeatedly refused to [...] "clear them out." [...] The killings followed years of sectarian civil war in Lebanon that left 95,000 dead. The Lebanese army's chief prosecutor investigated the killings and counted 460 dead, Israeli intelligence estimated 700-800 dead, and the Palestinian Red Crescent claimed 2,000 dead. 1,200 death certificates were issued to anyone who produced three witnesses claiming a family member disappeared {{during the time of the}} massacre.
