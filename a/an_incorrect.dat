5|$|The film The Adventures of Greyfriars Bobby, {{released}} in the UK in February 2006, cast a West Highland White Terrier as Bobby. The appearance of a Westie caused protests from the Skye Terrier breed club, which complained about the filmmaker's use of <b>an</b> <b>incorrect</b> dog breed for the part.|$|E
5|$|The {{multiple}} choice section is scored {{immediately after the}} exam by computer. One point is awarded for each correct answer, no points are credited or deducted for unanswered questions, and points are no longer deducted for having <b>an</b> <b>incorrect</b> answer.|$|E
5|$|Each round {{began with}} a toss-up {{physical}} challenge in which both teams competed, with the winning team receiving both initial control of the round, and money for their score. After the toss-up, the host began asking trivia questions of the team in control. Each correct answer earned a monetary award, and allowed the team to maintain control, while <b>an</b> <b>incorrect</b> answer, or failure to respond within approximately ten seconds turned control over to the opponents. However, the team could dare their opponents to answer the question, doubling its value; in response, the opponents could double dare for quadruple the original value. When the team in control was challenged to a double dare, they had to either answer or compete in a physical challenge. <b>An</b> <b>incorrect</b> answer, or not responding within approximately five seconds on a dare or double dare, awarded both control and the appropriate {{amount of money to}} the team that issued it. The second round played the same as the first, with question values doubled. On Double Dare and Super Sloppy Double Dare, a question was initially worth $10. On Family Double Dare and Double Dare 2000, a question was initially worth $25.|$|E

5|$|In cladistics, a homoplasy is a trait {{shared by}} two or more taxa for any reason other than that they share a common ancestry. Taxa which do share ancestry {{are part of the}} same clade; cladistics seeks to arrange them {{according}} to their degree of relatedness to describe their phylogeny. Homoplastic traits caused by convergence are therefore, {{from the point of view}} of cladistics, confounding factors which could lead to <b>an</b> <b>incorrect</b> analysis.|$|E
5|$|McDonald {{was later}} {{appointed}} by Washington {{to serve as}} a lieutenant colonel in command of Virginia revolutionary militia forces during the American Revolutionary War. He also served on various revolutionary committees throughout the war. McDonald died on August 19, 1778, at his home Glengarry near Winchester after receiving <b>an</b> <b>incorrect</b> dosage of the medication potassium antimonyl tartrate.|$|E
5|$|No tornado watches or {{warnings}} {{were issued}} {{before the storm}} struck. This was later determined to be because of missing atmospheric sounding data, as well as <b>an</b> <b>incorrect</b> assessment of {{the height of the}} tropopause, which led to an underestimation of the strength of the thunderstorm which produced the tornado. Although a severe thunderstorm warning was issued at 2:57 pm, very few people received the warnings in time.|$|E

Wallace Reid: The Life and Death of a Hollywood Idol credits Dwan as the producer and Reid as the director, but gives <b>an</b> <b>incorrect</b> release date.

5|$|To {{begin the}} game, a {{category}} is revealed, {{and the three}} teams of three contestants are asked multiple choice questions under that category, with each question having four possible answers. The contestant who buzzes in with the correct answer earns the respective team 100 points; <b>an</b> <b>incorrect</b> answer loses 100 points, and opens up the question to the other teams. Contestants must {{wait until after the}} host reads the entire question (including the choices) to buzz in.|$|E
5|$|While hunting near Merkinė (Merecz) {{in early}} 1648, Władysław {{suffered}} from a case of gallstone or kidney stone. His condition worsened due to <b>an</b> <b>incorrect</b> medication.

5000|$|There are two {{styles of}} small-hole gauges: full-ball and half-ball. The full-ball gauges {{are easier to}} set {{correctly}} and maintain, {{under the pressure of}} measurement, a better representation of the bore. Half-ball gauges tend to spring just a little bit, and this may be enough to make <b>a</b> measurement <b>incorrect.</b> <b>A</b> lighter [...] "touch" [...] is required to accurately use the half-ball gauges.|$|R
30|$|The {{triggering}} of such productive retrieval processes {{with respect}} to incorrect alternatives as well as correct alternatives is contingent on the incorrect alternatives being competitive (Little & Bjork, 2015). Uranus, for example, would be <b>a</b> competitive <b>incorrect</b> alternative to the question, “Which outer planet was discovered by mathematics rather than direct observation?” because Uranus is an outer planet. In contrast, Mercury would be <b>a</b> noncompetitive <b>incorrect</b> alternative for this question {{because it can be}} rejected easily, given that it is an inner planet. Importantly, however, although the presence of competitive alternatives appears to be a necessary condition for eliciting retrieval as to why <b>a</b> given <b>incorrect</b> alternative is incorrect, it {{does not appear to be}} a sufficient condition: Little (2011) found that only about 30  % of test-takers engage in such a strategy without being explicitly instructed to do so.|$|R

5|$|According to Hinchliffe, this is <b>an</b> <b>incorrect</b> statement. Hinchliffe {{based his}} account on Rumpelhardt's {{testimony}} who claims that Schnaufer was never taken to England. Rumpelhardt {{was released on}} 4 August 1945 and soon after Schnaufer was admitted {{to a hospital in}} Flensburg, ill with a combination of diphtheria and scarlet fever. Interrogation had begun in late May 1945 by a team of twelve officers from the Department of Air Technical Intelligence (DAT), led by Air Commodore Roderick Aeneas Chisholm. The German prisoners were brought to Eggebek. Here they conducted a number of interviews with various members of the night fighter force.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{started in}} 1973. The airport {{needed to be}} built on permafrost. The runway is {{insulated}} against the ground, so it will not melt during the summer. The hangar is frozen into the ground, with the pillars being melted into place and then being frozen stuck. The runway was plagued with frost heave due to <b>an</b> <b>incorrect</b> construction method, forcing the airport to regularly re-asphalt the runway. In 1989, parts of the runway were re-insulated, giving these areas that previously had been the worst an acceptable solution. In 2006, this measure {{was conducted on the}} remaining parts of the runway. An upgrade to the terminal building to allow larger capacity was completed in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Deep Impacts {{state of}} health was {{uncertain}} during the first day after launch. Shortly after entering orbit around the Sun and deploying its solar panels, the probe switched itself to safe mode. The {{cause of the problem}} was simply <b>an</b> <b>incorrect</b> temperature limit in the fault protection logic for the spacecraft's RCS thruster catalyst beds. The spacecraft's thrusters were used to detumble the spacecraft following third stage separation. On January 13, 2005, NASA announced that the probe was out of safe mode and healthy.|$|E

5|$|During {{a game in}} 2013 {{between the}} Houston Astros and Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Culbreth, acting as the crew chief for the game, made <b>an</b> <b>incorrect</b> call in the 7th inning, for which he later {{received}} a two-game suspension and a fine. Houston manager Bo Porter made a pitching change, and Los Angeles manager Mike Scioscia called for a pinch-hitter. Porter attempted to make a second pitching change and Scioscia immediately contested it. After discussing the call with his umpiring crew, Culbreth allowed the pitching change, violating the MLB rule 3.05(b). He did not serve his suspension immediately, and he continued working regular games in the weeks following the incident.|$|E
5|$|Legumes such as clover or alfalfa {{are usually}} higher in protein, calcium, and energy than grasses. However, they require warm weather and good soil {{to produce the}} best nutrients. Legume hays are {{generally}} higher in protein than the grass hays. They are also higher in minerals, particularly calcium, but have <b>an</b> <b>incorrect</b> ratio of calcium to phosphorus. Because they are high in protein, they are very desirable for growing horses or those subjected to very hard work, but the calcium:phosphorus ratio must be balanced by other feeds to prevent bone abnormalities.|$|E
5|$|Madonna faced {{a lawsuit}} in 2004 over an image in the book. Titled Amarak Productions, Inc. vs. Morton, Madonna's former {{bodyguard}} and ex-lover Jim Albright brought a defamation case against Morton, based on <b>an</b> <b>incorrect</b> photo caption. The photo had a caption identifying the subject in it as Albright; it was actually one of Madonna's homosexual back-up dancers, Jose Gutierez. Amarak Productions, Inc. had employed Albright as Madonna's bodyguard in 1992, and he became romantically involved with her. While writing Madonna, Morton contacted Albright to gather information on their relationship. On discovering the misleading image, the lawsuit was filed by Albright who objected to the caption.|$|E

5|$|Milford {{remained}} {{the commander of}} the 7th Division, as well as the Morotai occupation force, until March 1946. He returned to Melbourne, replacing Major General John Chapman as Deputy Chief of General Staff on 11 March. An appointment as adjutant general followed in May. He retired on 23 April 1948 due to ill health but this was due to <b>an</b> <b>incorrect</b> diagnosis of prostate cancer. In 1946, he had been recommended for appointment as a Companion of the Order of the Bath for his leadership during Operation Oboe Two, and was duly presented with the Order in 1949.|$|E
5|$|On 19 April 2009, 21 polo ponies died {{shortly before}} a match in the United States Polo Open. Three days later, a {{pharmacy}} {{released a statement}} explaining that the horses had received <b>an</b> <b>incorrect</b> dose {{of one of the}} ingredients used in a vitamin/mineral supplement compound that had been incorrectly compounded by a compounding pharmacy. Analysis of blood levels of inorganic compounds in the supplement indicated the selenium concentrations were ten to fifteen times higher than normal in the blood samples, and 15 to 20 times higher than normal in the liver samples. Selenium was later confirmed to be the toxic factor.|$|E
5|$|On a computer, if {{the result}} of an {{addition}} is too large to store, an arithmetic overflow occurs, resulting in <b>an</b> <b>incorrect</b> answer. Unanticipated arithmetic overflow is a fairly common cause of program errors. Such overflow bugs may be hard to discover and diagnose because they may manifest themselves only for very large input data sets, which {{are less likely to be}} used in validation tests. One especially notable such error was the Y2K bug, where overflow errors due to using a 2-digit format for years caused significant computer problems in 2000.|$|E
