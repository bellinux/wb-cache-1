5|$|Arthur Lennig {{asserted}} that MGM's official budget for Greed was suspiciously high {{for a film}} with no stars, no built sets, a small crew and inexpensive film stock. Lennig suspects that MGM averaged the film's cost with the more expensive The Merry Widow {{in order to prevent}} von Stroheim from getting <b>a</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more profitable film. The Merry Widow ended up being a hit and earned more profits than Greed had lost; it cost $614,961 but earned $996,226 on its initial run.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the next}} season Tim Mara signed All-American University of Michigan quarterback Harry Newman, and free agent halfback Ken Strong. Mara broke his own rule by {{offering}} Newman a contract which allowed him <b>a</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gate. That same season Wellington Mara's mother finally allowed him to spend training camp living with the team.

5|$|Despite Riley {{serving as}} the act's main draw, he was not {{permitted}} to become an equal partner in the venture. Nye and Pond both received <b>a</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> net profit, while Riley was paid a flat rate for each performance. In addition, because of Riley's past agreements with the Redpath Lyceum Bureau, he was required to pay half of his fee to his agent Amos Walker.

5|$|Both Boycott and McGregor Blacker were {{involved}} in a protracted dispute with Mr Carr, the agent for the Achill Church Mission Estate, from whom McGregor Blacker leased the lands, and Mr O'Donnell, Carr's bailiff. The dispute began when Boycott and Carr supported different sets of candidates in elections for the Board of Guardians to the Church Mission Estate, and Boycott's candidates won. Carr was also the local receiver of wrecks, which meant that he was entitled to collect the salvage from all shipwrecks in the area, and guard it until it was sold in a public auction. The local receiver had a right to <b>a</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sale and to keep whatever did not sell. In 1860 Carr {{wrote a letter to the}} Official Receiver of Wrecks stating that Boycott and his men had illegally broken up a wreck and moved the salvage to Boycott's property. In response to this accusation, Boycott sued Carr for libel and claimed £500 in damages.|$|E
5|$|For the negotiations, {{the studio}} {{requested}} that the cast members accept a 45 percent cut of their salaries so that more seasons could be produced after season 23, or else that season would be the series' last. The actors {{were willing to take}} a pay cut, but wanted <b>a</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> back-end payments instead. At one point Shearer even offered a 70 percent pay cut in exchange for back-end percentages, but the studio was unwilling to make any deal involving back-end percentages. In the end, the studio and the actors reached a deal, in which the actors would take a pay cut of 30 percent, down to just over $300,000 per episode, prolonging the show to its 25th season. As well as the voice actors, everybody involved in the show took a pay cut. This included animators, writers, the post-production crew and even Jean himself. The further use of digital animation also saves money, as the animation of the show becomes more efficient.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{publication}} of his memoirs, Chaplin began work on A Countess from Hong Kong (1967), a romantic comedy based on a script he had written for Paulette Goddard in the 1930s. Set on an ocean liner, it starred Marlon Brando as an American ambassador and Sophia Loren as a stowaway found in his cabin. The film differed from Chaplin's earlier productions in several aspects. It was his first to use Technicolor and the widescreen format, while he concentrated on directing and appeared on-screen only in a cameo role as a seasick steward. He also signed a deal with Universal Pictures and appointed his assistant, Jerome Epstein, as the producer. Chaplin was paid $600,000 director's fee as well as <b>a</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gross receipts. A Countess from Hong Kong premiered in January 1967, to unfavourable reviews, and was a box-office failure. Chaplin was deeply hurt by the negative reaction to the film, {{which turned out to be}} his last.|$|E
