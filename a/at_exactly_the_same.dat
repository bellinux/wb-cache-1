5|$|The Beatles {{completed}} a final {{mix of the}} song on 21 April 1967. Due to the difficulty in getting the two 4-track machines to play <b>at</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time, only a mono mix was attempted. In October 1968, while preparing the Yellow Submarine soundtrack album for release, EMI's engineers created a mock-stereo (duophonic) mix from this mono mix, instead of returning to the master tapes. For the monaural version of the album, originally available only in the UK, the engineers combined the two channels from the duophonic mix, rather than using the April 1967 mono mix.|$|E
5|$|For {{the three}} {{sections}} of the ride where wrap-around projection is used, each robotic arm continues its steady movement on the track but is met by its own individual parabolic projection screen and projector traveling <b>at</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> pace. Each projection section uses a huge turntable with six of these enormous screens mounted facing outwards - one for each robotic arm as they pass by - and each screen is large enough that when {{in front of each}} ride bench its edges cannot be seen. The screens appear and disappear behind the edges of the physical sets. The robotic arms can then freely dive, turn and pivot each ride bench within the curved area, giving the illusion of extreme movement when synchronized with the projection, whilst the base of the arm on the track simply follows the slow circular path that each screen takes as it revolves. This is why each projection section of the ride is approximately the same length, as each ride arm must follow each identically-sized projection screen turntable for a set period of time.|$|E
5|$|Another {{innovation}} {{was the use}} of a dummy head to {{find the}} location of an enemy sniper. The tempting target of a realistic papier-mâché head was raised above the parapet on a stick running in a groove on a fixed board. To increase the realism, a lit cigarette could be inserted into the dummy's mouth and be smoked by a soldier via a rubber tube. If the head was shot, it was dropped rapidly, simulating a casualty. The sniper's bullet would have made a hole in the front and back of the dummy's head. The head was then raised in the groove again, but lower than before by the vertical distance between the glasses of a trench periscope. If the lower glass of a periscope was placed before the front bullet hole, its upper glass would be <b>at</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> height as the bullet had been. By looking through the rear hole in the head, through the front hole and up through the periscope, the soldier would be looking exactly along the line the bullet had taken, and so would be looking directly at the sniper, revealing his position.|$|E
5|$|Certain foreign {{partnerships}} and same-sex marriages are recognised as civil partnerships since 13 January 2011. While Glenn Cunningham and Adriano Vilar are {{often cited as}} the first same-sex couple to have their civil partnership formally recognised in Ireland, in fact several hundred couples were recognised together <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time. <b>The</b> couple formed a civil partnership at a ceremony in Northern Ireland in 2010.|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} by Paramount Pictures to celebrate the 500th anniversary of Columbus' voyage. The premiere debuted <b>at</b> almost <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time as Christopher Columbus: The Discovery, often leading to confusion between the two films.|$|R
50|$|The Amiskwi River is {{the longest}} {{tributary}} of the Kicking Horse River, beginning at Amiskwi Pass and flowing south for about 17.7 km then southeast for about 11.5 km until its confluence with the Kicking Horse River <b>at</b> almost <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> location as <b>the</b> mouth of the Emerald River.|$|R

25|$|Brownsville {{is among}} the southernmost of all {{contiguous}} U.S. cities. Within the contiguous United States, {{only a handful of}} municipalities in Florida's Miami-Dade and Monroe counties (plus Everglades City in Collier County) are further south than Brownsville, which lies <b>at</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> latitude as North Miami Beach in northern Miami-Dade County.|$|E
25|$|The speed {{regulator}} was furnished with an indicator {{that showed the}} speed when the machine was running so that the records, on reproduction, could be revolved <b>at</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> speed...The literature does not disclose why 78rpm was chosen for the phonograph industry, apparently this {{just happened to be}} the speed created by one of the early machines and, for no other reason continued to be used.|$|E
50|$|As {{users can}} take the USB devices {{containing}} their version of the operating system around with them employees can boot up their home computer with <b>the</b> <b>same</b> USB stick so it has <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> software environment as they use in their place of work thus enabling employees to work <b>at</b> home <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as they would in the office.|$|R
50|$|During evoked Ca2+ sparks, all {{clusters}} of ryanodine receptors, throughout the cell are activated <b>at</b> almost <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time. This produces {{an increase in}} Ca2+ concentration across the whole cell (not just locally) and {{is known as a}} whole cell Ca2+ transient. This Ca2+ then binds to a protein, called troponin, initiating contraction, through a group of proteins known as myofilaments.|$|R
50|$|In 1967, the {{government}} handed control of Hovercraft Development to the National Physical Laboratory. <b>At</b> almost <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time, Laithwaite severed his ties with BR. The two teams joined forces, re-organizing as Tracked Hovercraft {{to continue efforts}} to build a full-scale prototype. A combination of factors, including Laithwaite's persuasiveness and Bertin's successes in France, quickly gained the company government funding.|$|R
25|$|An exception-handling {{language}} {{without this}} unwinding is Common Lisp with its Condition System. Common Lisp calls the exception handler {{and does not}} unwind the stack. This allows the program to continue the computation <b>at</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> place where the error occurred (for example when a previously missing file has become available). The stackless implementation of the Mythryl programming language supports constant-time exception handling without stack unwinding.|$|E
25|$|On tandem {{bicycles}} the pedalling {{contribution of}} both riders is often combined and coordinated by the crank arms. There {{may be a}} second set of chainrings, often on the opposite side from the regular drive train, one on each crank set and connected by a separate chain. The most common implementation has both cyclists pedaling <b>at</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> pace and usually in phase, although it is possible to configure the system for out-of-phase pedaling.|$|E
25|$|The rubrics of the Roman Missal now {{prescribe}} {{that the}} priest should face {{the people at}} six points of the Mass. The priest celebrating the Tridentine Mass was required to face the people, turning if necessary {{his back to the}} altar, eight times. The priest is still expressly directed to face the altar <b>at</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> points as in the Tridentine Mass. His position in relation to the altar determines, as before, whether facing the altar means also facing the people.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{feasibility}} and desirability of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). We identify CSR with creation of public goods or curtailment of public bads. Using a model with pro 8 ̆ 5 t-maximizing rms, the paper {{shows that there}} is a direct parallel be-tween CSR and traditional models of private provision of public goods. Indeed, 8 ̆ 5 rms that use CSR will produce public goods <b>at</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> level as predicted by the standard voluntary contribution equilibrium for public goods. We compare CSR with government provision and charitable provision, discussing when CSR by private for-pro t 8 ̆ 5 rms could have a comparative advantage in dealing with public goods provision...|$|R
50|$|The {{discovery}} of hydrogen {{gas in the}} 18th century led to {{the invention of the}} hydrogen balloon, <b>at</b> almost <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time that <b>the</b> Montgolfier brothers rediscovered the hot-air balloon and began manned flights. Various theories in mechanics by physicists during <b>the</b> <b>same</b> period of time, notably fluid dynamics and Newton's laws of motion, led to the foundation of modern aerodynamics, most notably by Sir George Cayley.|$|R
5000|$|It {{has been}} alleged by some {{commentators}} {{that one of}} the promotional songs for the 2022 Winter Olympics, [...] "The Snow and Ice Dance," [...] has suspicious similarities with [...] "Let It Go." [...] A Chinese media outlet cited technical analysis of the two songs: Both songs employ a piano as the major instrument, have similar prelude chords and an eight-beat introduction, and they run <b>at</b> almost <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> tempo.|$|R
25|$|<b>At</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time as Winslow {{read the}} {{expulsion}} orders in Grand Pré, September 5 at 15:00 hrs, Captain Alexander Murray read {{the order to}} the 183 Acadian males he had imprisoned at Fort Edward. On October 20, 920 Acadians from Piziquid were loaded on to four transports. Unlike the neighbouring community of Grand Pré, the buildings at Pisiquid were not destroyed by fire. As a result, when the New England Planters arrived, many houses and barns still stood there.|$|E
25|$|Resonant {{vibrational}} modes due to {{vertical loads}} (such as trains, traffic, pedestrians) and wind loads are well understood in bridge design. In {{the case of}} the Millennium Bridge, because the lateral motion caused the pedestrians loading the bridge to directly participate with the bridge, the vibrational modes had not been anticipated by the designers. The crucial point is that when the bridge lurches to one side, the pedestrians must adjust to keep from falling over, and they all do this <b>at</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time.|$|E
25|$|The West Indies played 19 Tests in the 1930s in four {{series against}} England and one against Australia. The first {{four of these}} were played against an England team led by the Honourable Freddie Calthorpe that toured in 1929–30. However, as Harold Gilligan was leading another English team to New Zealand <b>at</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time, {{this was not a}} full-strength England side. The series ended one-all, with the West Indies first ever Test victory being {{recorded}} on 26 February 1930. West Indians George Headley scored the most runs (703) in the rubber and Learie Constantine took the most wickets (18).|$|E
5000|$|The Emerald River {{is a short}} {{river in}} British Columbia. It is about 6.5 km long and drains the waters of Emerald Lake to the Kicking Horse River. [...] The river exits the lake’s south end and flows in a {{southern}} direction for about 6.5 km to its mouth, which is <b>at</b> almost <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> place as <b>the</b> mouth of the Amiskwi River. It picks up three named tributaries; Hamilton Creek, Russell Creek and Kendel Creek.|$|R
500|$|Struthiosaurinae is a {{subfamily}} of ankylosaurian dinosaurs {{from the}} Cretaceous of Europe. It {{is defined as}} [...] "the most inclusive clade containing Europelta but not Cedarpelta, Peloroplites, Sauropelta or Edmontonia" [...] while being reinstated for a newly recognized clade of basal nodosaurids. Struthiosaurinae appeared <b>at</b> about <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time as <b>the</b> North American subfamily Nodosaurinae.

30|$|To {{research}} {{the influence of}} sample preparation, a d-optimal response surface design was used. The sample volume was varied at levels of 10, 25, 50, 100 and 200  mL. The receiver volume (volume of graduated flask) was set <b>at</b> either <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> volume as <b>the</b> sample volume, or at the double volume (for example, 25  mL of sample were either distilled into 25 or 50  mL). Finally as third factor, volumetric glass pipettes or graduated flasks were used to transfer the sample volume into the Kjeldatherm tube.|$|R
25|$|Most Japanese Prime Ministers {{have issued}} apologies, {{including}} Prime Minister Obuchi in the Japan–South Korea Joint Declaration of 1998. While South Koreans welcomed the apologies at the time, many South Koreans now view the statements as insincere, because of continuous misunderstandings {{between the two}} nations. In one example in 2005, the Koizumi Cabinet did not participate, but 47 Diet members visited Yasukuni shrine for a memorial service <b>at</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time Prime Minister Koizumi was issuing the apology. This was seen by South Koreans as a contradiction and has caused many South Koreans to distrust Japanese statements of apology.|$|E
25|$|The name 'spiders' {{was coined}} by Malin Space Science Systems personnel, the {{developers}} of the camera. One {{of the first}} and most interesting spider photos was found by Greg Orme in October 2000. The unusual shape and appearance of these 'spider webs' and spots caused a lot of speculation about their origin. The first years' surveillance showed that during the following Martian years, 70% of the spots appear <b>at</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> place, and a preliminary statistical study obtained between September 1999 and March 2005, indicated that dark dune spots and spiders are related phenomena as functions of the cycle of carbon dioxide (CO2) ice condensation and sublimation.|$|E
25|$|As the {{solution}} to be purified is heated, its vapors rise to the fractionating column. As it rises, it cools, condensing on the condenser walls and the surfaces of the packing material. Here, the condensate continues to be heated by the rising hot vapors; it vaporizes once more. However, {{the composition of the}} fresh vapors are determined once again by Raoult's law. Each vaporization-condensation cycle (called a theoretical plate) will yield a purer solution of the more volatile component. In reality, each cycle at a given temperature does not occur <b>at</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> position in the fractionating column; theoretical plate is thus a concept rather than an accurate description.|$|E
50|$|As T-tubules and the sarcomplasmic {{reticulum}} {{spread throughout}} the muscle cells, they allow for synchronised calcium release across the whole cell, as the action potential is travelling so fast, that it activates all of the L-type calcium channels <b>at</b> almost <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time. Therefore, in cells lacking t-tubules (including smooth muscle cells), the calcium that enters at the sarcolemma, has to diffuse gradually throughout the cell, activating the ryanodine receptors as a wave of calcium. This process is a much slower and results in reduced force of contraction.|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge was}} unable to meet the {{increased}} requirements imposed on it by the new Cologne Central Station (1894). After the construction work had already started for the Hohenzollern Bridge in 1907, the Cathedral Bridge was deconstructed in stages between 1908 and 1910. The Hohenzollern Bridge was completed 1911, demolished in 1945 during World War II and subsequently rebuilt. The current Hohenzollern Bridge's southern foundation is placed <b>at</b> nearly <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> place of <b>the</b> Cathedral Bridge's foundation and is the most heavily used railway bridge in Germany.|$|R

25|$|Taking to {{the court}} after was Belgian Kim Clijsters and Swiss Martina Hingis in the last quarter-final to be contested, {{and one of the}} most {{anticipated}} match-ups thus far in the tournament. Last year, Clijsters beat Hingis <b>at</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> stage before losing to Amélie Mauresmo. The fourth-seed squandered the first set, making 23 unforced errors, but began to find her game in the second set. She raced to a 5–2 lead in the second set, but let it slip before eventually winning 6–4 to push it to a deciding set. Hingis raced off to an early 2–0 lead in the last set, but all energy had been drained from her and she lost six of the last seven games of the match to hand Clijsters the victory, despite having forty-two unforced errors less than the Belgian. The semi-finals will feature Maria Sharapova against Kim Clijsters.|$|E
25|$|At Kansas, Johnson gambled {{by staying}} {{out on the}} last round of pit stops, and held off Harvick and Earnhardt again to win his third race at Kansas and of the season. In winning, he {{established}} a Cup record of 23 wins on 1.5-mile tracks, taking what was both his 200th top five and his 300th top ten finish. At Charlotte, he spun out on two occasions. The first time was early in the race while running 16th coming out of turn 4 but he was lucky to avoid hitting anything. He wasn't so lucky on the second spin late in the race; while running fifth, he spun out again <b>at</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> place, and hit the wall in pit road, causing some nose damage. Those spin-outs would leave him with a 40th-place finish. He rebounded the following week with a win at Dover, and also became one of four drivers to have won 10 or more races at one track. This gave him a total of 74 career wins, two fewer than Dale Earnhardt's 76.|$|E
25|$|This disc rotates {{at a fixed}} {{specific}} speed, set by the user. Each disc {{rotation speed}} is set to a particular frequency of the desired note. If the note being played (and making the lamps behind the disc flash) is <b>at</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> frequency as the spinning of the disc, then the disc appears to be static (due to the persistence of vision) from the strobing effect. If the note is out of tune then the pattern appears to be moving as the light flashing and the disc rotation are out of sync from each other. The more out of tune the played note is, the faster the pattern seems to be moving, although in reality it always spins {{at the same speed}} for a given note. Many good turntables for vinyl disc records have stroboscopic patterns lit by the incoming AC power (mains). The power frequency, either 50 or 60Hz, serves as the reference, although commercial power frequency sometimes changes slightly (a few tenths of a percent) with varying load. Unless reference and measured quantity are interchanged, the operating principle is the same; the turntable speed is adjusted to stop drifting of the pattern.|$|E
40|$|On the relevance-theoretic {{approach}} {{outlined in}} this paper, linguistic metaphors {{are not a}} natural kind, and ―metaphor ‖ is not a theoretically important notion {{in the study of}} verbal communication. Metaphorical interpretations are arrived <b>at</b> in <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way as literal, loose and hyperbolic interpretations: there is no mechanism specific to metaphors, and no interesting generalisation that applies only to them. In this paper, we defend this approach in detail by showing how <b>the</b> <b>same</b> inferential procedure applies to utterances {{at both ends of the}} literal-loose-metaphorical continuum, and how both literal and metaphorical utterances may create poetic effects. ...|$|R
5000|$|Aleksandr Vampilov {{never knew}} his father, because on January 17, 1938, Valentin {{was arrested on}} {{fabricated}} charges. He was shot in Irkutsk in March of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> year (and rehabilitated in 1957).

50|$|His missa pro defunctis - the Requiem mass - is {{a formal}} and staid setting, {{contrasting}} to the intensely emotional setting by his Spanish contemporary Tomás Luis de Victoria, who wrote his <b>at</b> almost <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time. Its use of cantus firmus technique is conservative, and even archaic; most cantus firmus masses {{had been written}} {{more than a hundred}} years before.
