On the contrary, our paper delves into a less walked path: the description of relations established within an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>chain.</b> We will start from the traditional definition of auxiliary verb as a unit that modifies the ‘main’ or ‘lexical’ verb, and proceed to show that such a conception makes the wrong predictions when it comes to explain those internal relations, for it only accounts for a subset of the cases.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the concept of}} later waiting time {{distributions}} for patterns in multi-state trials is generalized to cover a collection of compound patterns that must all be counted pattern-specific numbers of times, and a practical method is given to compute the generalized distribution. The solution given applies to overlapping counting and two types of non-overlapping counting, and the underlying sequences {{are assumed to be}} Markovian of a general order. Patterns are allowed to be weighted so that an occurrence is counted multiple times, and patterns may be completely included in longer patterns. Probabilities are computed through an auxiliary Markov chain. As the state space associated with the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>chain</b> can be quite large if its setup is handled in a naïve fashion, an algorithm is given for generating a "minimal" state space that leaves out states that can never be reached. For the case of overlapping counting, a formula that relates probabilities for intersections of events to probabilities for unions of subsets of the events is also used, so that the distribution is also computed in terms of probabilities for competing patterns. A detailed example is given to illustrate the methodology. ...|$|E

40|$|In this {{exposition}} {{we consider}} the wave dynamics of a one-dimensional periodic granular dimer (diatomic) chain mounted on a damped and an undamped linear elastic foundation (otherwise called the on-site potential). It is very well known that periodic granular dimers support solitary wave propagation (similar {{to that in the}} homogeneous granular chains) for a specific discrete set of mass ratios. In this work we present the analytical investigation of the evolution of solitary waves and primary pulses in granular dimers when they are mounted on on-site potential with and without velocity proportional foundation damping. We invoke a methodology based on the multiple time-scale asymptotic analysis and partition the dynamics of the perturbed dimer chain into slow and fast components. The dynamics of the dimer chain in the limit of large mass mismatch (<b>auxiliary</b> <b>chain)</b> mounted on on-site potential and foundation damping is used {{as the basis for the}} analysis.

It is observed that the amplitude evolution predicted by the described methodology is in good agreement with the numerical simulation of the original system.
