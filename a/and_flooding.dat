40|$|Recently, {{the number}} of natural {{disaster}} occurrence is increasing because of abnormal changes of weather in Korea. In Korea the storm <b>and</b> <b>flood</b> insurance system is in effect to prevent these natural disasters. The national storm <b>and</b> <b>flood</b> insurance Premium rate is very low {{and the risk of}} adverse selection resides because of choosing by who lives in high risk area. To solve these problems, the storm <b>and</b> <b>flood</b> insurance rate map are required.
