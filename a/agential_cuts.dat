However, sociomateriality is the first concept to be developed {{within the field of}} Information System (IS) studies, a division of management and organization theory. It has been argued that sociomateriality is 'the new black' of IS. Barad explains that human actors and technological objects are understood to emerge in sociomaterial assemblages.

40|$|This themed journal issue {{provides}} {{many examples}} of ways forward {{in the study of}} death and memory in the Viking world. While all contributions demonstrate that there are exciting new ways to study remains from funerary contexts that focus on different forms of citation involving material culture and monuments, this article will very briefly discuss dimensions that have not been addressed here. Specifically, it showcases how the mortuary citations approach can also use post-humanist theory for further development and exploration of mortuary practices in the Viking world. Although short, this article discusses rune stones, particularly rune stones with kuml inscriptions, which I have examined elsewhere. The term kuml appears on contemporary rune stones; it refers to different material entities such as rune stones, mounds/cairns, and other standing stones. The being and becoming of kuml is briefly discussed through the concepts of intra-action and <b>agential</b> <b>cuts</b> championed by Karen Bara...|$|E
40|$|Part 4 : Considering Communication and PerformanceInternational audienceAs {{people live}} their lives online more and more, they {{increasingly}} rely on digital bodies to extend their senses and to perform identities. With this hybridization of physical and digital embodiments, they become cyborgs and are compelled to negotiate the dualistic space defined by the binary opposition of actual and virtual reality. Whereas actuality typically connotes concrete existence, virtuality signifies phenomena that are ideal, essential and unrealized but that have actual effects. This paper seeks to understand how individuals negotiate the liminal space that combines virtual and actual reality, especially {{as it relates to}} their sense of self, in their performance of cyborgian identities. Drawing on Boland’s [1] Engine of Inquiry and Barad’s [2] <b>agential</b> <b>cuts</b> as a conceptual infrastructure, this paper analyzes one identity performance of a single Second Life user in order to answer the following research question: How are cyborgian identities enacted in virtual worlds...|$|E

40|$|This article leverages {{the work}} of Karen Barad to analyze digital self-imaging research.

Rather than beginning the study with the presumption that bodies, photos, cameras, and expressed selves are distinct and pre-existing entities that then interact with one another, or touch, selfies here are construed as networked material–discursive entanglements wherein bodies, photos, cameras, and expressed selves are always and already touching. Within this entangled phenomenon, then, this article suggests that what reads as touch (images that grab or repulse/efface) is in a sense the opposite of touch—it is a pulling apart of the entangled phenomenon wherein <b>agential</b> <b>cuts</b> demarcate the desired boundaries of entities like bodies, images, and self.

40|$|AbstractThis {{presentation}} {{is based on}} my article (Un) becoming Dysfunctional: ADHD and How Matter Comes to Matter (2016). The main theme of the article is to problematize the biomedical model of the so-called neuropsychiatric disorder Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Various neuropsychiatric disorders are a common feature today, not least in educational contexts where ADHD is a common diagnosis. The dominant perspective regarding ADHD is biomedical. This perspective has been questioned and challenged in theories where ADHD {{is seen as a}} social construction for power and social control. Theorists have also tried to see ADHD as a biopsychosocial disorder. The aim {{of this article is to}} think ADHD through quantum physicist and philosopher Karen Barad’s (2007) theory of agential realism. According to Barad, what we perceive as singular entities – or disorders – do not exist in advance. Barad pays attention to the world’s entanglements, and what we perceive as singular objects and subjects are effects of specific and various material-discursive practices acting as <b>agential</b> <b>cuts.</b> The theory of agential realism assigns performativity to matter, which highlights that ADHD is something that continuously comes into being together with human and non-human bodies. The material dimension has not previously been emphasized as a causal factor in studies on ADHD. In this article, the focus is on the agency of the book. As a conclusion, the importance of taking responsibility for every material-discursive practice with which we are always entangled is emphasized. What we think of individual diagnoses aren’t necessarily that individual as we think they are, and therefore we must challenge theoretical models that place individuals in ‘static’ and hierarchic strata...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} notable recent changes in autism science {{is the belief that}} autism is a {{heterogeneous}} condition with no singular essence. I argue that this notion of ‘autistic heterogeneity’ can be conceived as an ‘agential cut’ and traced to uncertainty work conducted by cognitive psychologists during the early 1990 s. Researchers at this time overcame uncertainty in scientific theory by locating it within autism itself: epistemological uncertainty was interwoven with ontological indeterminacy and autism became heterogeneous and chance like, a condition determined by indeterminacy. This paper considers not only the conceptual significance of this move but also the impact upon forms of subjectivity. This analysis is undertaken by integrating the agential realism of Karen Barad with the historical ontology of Michel Foucault. I argue that these two approaches are, firstly, concerned with ontologies of emergence and, secondly, foreground the inherently ethical nature of change. As such these theories can be used to articulate an ‘ethics of transformation’. I argue that the <b>agential</b> <b>cut</b> which brought about autistic heterogeneity is potentially problematic within an ethics of transformation, limiting the possibility of future change in subjectivity by imagining difference and resistance as properties of autism rather than the individual...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} I use a fictive {{microscope}} and fictive {{student in a}} science classroom as a focal point in order to elaborate on matter and things in science education. This paper {{is a part of}} a larger book project that aims to critically discuss science education from a Nordic perspective. The microscope and its setting; the science classroom, is chosen since the science subjects and its teacher particularly rely on and use tools and artefacts in their daily practice (Röhl, 2015). However, this practise and the use of things, matter and material in education are according to Fenwick “often missing from accounts of educational processes such as learning. Materials tend to be ignored as part of the backdrop for human action” (ibid, p. 141). With a sociomaterialistic approach, this paper opens up educational practices as collective sociomaterial enacments (Fenwick et al, 2015). Following Röhl (2015 and Fenwick et al (2015) this paper elaborates on following questions: What kind of education is configured through and with material objects? How are the range of actors - human and non-human - influencing what is enacted in education? How do some educational practices become stabilized? How do sociomaterial assemblages produce particular identities, discourses and possibilities? The goal therefore, leaning on Barad (2007) is not only to “simply to recognise that both social and material matter, but to examine how they matter” (ibid, p. 30). Inspired by writers such as Latour (1999, 2005), Mol (2000), Fenwick (2010, 2011) and Barad (2003, 2007) this paper “focus on materials as dynamic and enmeshed with human activity in everyday practices”(Fenwick et al, 2015, p. 143). Material refers here to things, tools and non-human actors (in this case a microscope). Social refers to meanings, desires, discourses and human actors (in this case a student in a science educational discourse). From a sociomaterialistic perspective (as well as ANT and STS) ideas, practices and facts are effects not of one thinker, nor of a specific action. Rather they are effects of assemblages and web of relations between actors, both human and non – human. For example, knowledge building or learning are an effects of joint exercises in assemblages of actors that are co-creators of meaning and knowledge. Realities therefore becomes a products of history, discourses, bodies and many other factors (Gunnarsson, 2015). The assemblages, and the effects of these, travels through time and space and is not one-dimensional nor singular, reality is multiple and created constantly in a myriad of different ways. We exist, according to Haraway (1991) in an ocean of powerful stories and narratives which opens up for new stories and realities to constantly take shape. The microscope and the student for example, are therefore not only passive objects or actors, they represent and create a synthesis of sociohistorical legacies and put in a chain of discourses, knowledge and power issues that comes into being in the classroom. A sociomaterialistic view are of special interest in education since human and non-humans intra-act towards a production of knowledge. Education is therefore understood as a results of an interplay between human and non-humans (Fenwick et al, 2015). In addition, a sociomaterial perspective annul a dichotomised (and reduced) view on education when effects of assemblages moves beyond time and space and beyond the local and global Röhl (2015). Methods/methodology (up to 400 words) Three threads will be followed into webs of actions and actors within earlier research, curricula, websites, analyses of google pictures and youtube-clips. The threads are connected to each other through societal and educational discourses that characterize science education (Carlone, 2003; Lederman, 2008; Lundin & Lindahl, 2014). A sociomaterialistic perspective however demands a “rethinking of causality as entanglements with surprising effects, not linear relations between causes and effects (Fenwick et al, 2015, p. 143). This rethinking is not easily done, the “methods and theories are difficult to apply (Fenwick et al, 2015, p. 121) and the elaboration is complex. In this elaboration, I will therefore use four notions to guide me. One of the ontological basis for the sociomaterial methodology lies within the view that “[i]t is not that separate, delineated entities come together to interact, rather things already loosely connected participate actively with each other to produce particular phenomena” (Fenwick et al, 2015, p. 134, my italic). The student and the microscope (i. e. the practical work that a student performs with a microscope in a science classroom) will therefore together be in the focal point. When a human (e. g. a student) repeatedly is encountered with a non-human (e. g. an equipment), it is created, with Barads perspective, an intra-action. The smallest unit in this elaboration is therefore not the student, not the microscope; it is the reality, the phenomenon that they create together in an intra-action. This phenomena must be understood as both student and microscope, where ”[o]ne is too few, two is too many” (Haraway, 1991, p. 35). However, this perspective are deeply complex. In order to make some elaborations that could be understood I will draw on Barad (2003) and do an <b>agential</b> <b>cut</b> and look at a specific intra-action (i. e. the microscope and the student), that will become the “apparatus of observation”. Barad describes the notion apparatus as “dynamic (re) configurings of the world, specific agential practices/intra-actions/performances” (ibid, p. 816) which can create boundaries in order to define e. g. activities and phenomena (Fenwick et al, 2015) It is through the apparatus that figurations (formations, configurations) are created and formed. Figurations points toward the performative, practices and actions that forms something into a figure or a stabilisation (such as a taken-for granted practice), or seen from an ANT-perspective, an ”immutible mobiles” (Latour, 1986). I argue that it is here that research with a sociomaterialistic perspective shows how questions above can be understood. Expected outcomes/results (up to 300 words) The analysis and elaboration of these threads are under process; however, some preliminary outcomes can be described. Firstly (1), the apparatus (the student and the microscope) becomes a prototype (Carlone, 2003) of the “real” scientist and his artefacts in a science lab. The apparatus therefore participate in figuration of the discourse of what science is and should do however with fewer resources and other objectives (Zogza and Ergazaki, 2013). Together with apparatuses in classrooms around the world, it becomes a phenomenon that creates powerful pictures and might contribute to a stabilisation of “taken for granted notions and sociohistorical legacies of science” (Carlone, 2003, p. 308). Secondly (2), when bringing in equipment into the classroom this imply that a number of institutions (such as manufacturers) indirectly govern the classroom (Röhl, 2015). Likewise the scientist they are driven by other objectives and the classroom might become remotely governed. Preliminary analyses shows that this remotely governing takes place through the apparatus. Thirdly (3), tools and artefact in school are often simplified versions. This might cause a reduction of learning possibilities and a vertical learning process. Tools and artefacts used in the science classroom are not at all harmless. In intra-action with the student, they becomes apparatus that performs and creates realities. I. e. things and matter “transmits knowledge and values across time and space (Fenwick & Edwards, 2010, p. 9). However, “intra-actions are constraining but not determining” (Barad, 2003, p. 826). When acknowledging this perspective there are therefore “possibilities for acting … at every moment, and these changing possibilities entail a responsibility to intervene in the world’s becoming, to contest and rework what matters and what is excluded from mattering” (ibid, p. 827). In other words, “[t]he future is radically open at every turn” (ibid, p. 826). Intent of publication Jobér, A. (2016). Cultural performativity in science education.
