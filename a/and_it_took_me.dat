500|$|In 1960 Leigh {{recalled}} her ambivalence {{towards her}} first experience of critical acclaim and sudden fame, commenting, [...] "that some critics saw {{fit to be}} as foolish as to say that I was a great actress. And I thought, that was a foolish, wicked thing to say, because it put such an onus and such a responsibility onto me, which I simply wasn't able to carry. <b>And</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> years to learn enough to live up to what they said for those first notices. I find it so stupid. I remember the critic very well and have never forgiven him." ...|$|E
500|$|The Klingon Targ {{was created}} by {{dressing}} a tamed wild boar (named Emmy Lou) in an outfit created by costume designer William Ware Theiss. Executive producer Robert Justman later recalled, [...] "That pig smelled horrid. A sweet-sour, extremely pungent odor. I showered and showered, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> a week {{to get rid of}} it!" [...] To appear as the Traveler, Eric Menyuk wore a prosthetic piece (created by Michael Westmore) on his forehead which ran into his hairline. He also wore a pair of false three-fingered hands, which were sold in the [...] "It's A Wrap!" [...] auction after the end of [...] His Traveler costume was also sold at the auction.|$|E

She said:I did 80% of the beats on Vespertine <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> three years to work on that album, because it was all microbeats — it was like doing a huge embroidery piece. Matmos came {{in the last two weeks}} and added percussion on top of the songs, but they didn't do any of the main parts, and they are credited everywhere as having done the whole album. [...] Drew [...] is a close friend of mine, and in every single interview he did, he corrected it. And they don't even listen to him. It really is strange.|$|E

500|$|Sergey Richter {{qualified}} {{to compete in}} the event by winning a medal in the 2015 European Games. This was Richter's second Olympics. He placed 9th at the London Olympics, missing the finals by one place. In regards to qualifying for Rio, Richter said [...] "the pressure ahead of Baku was unbearable <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> a few seconds to regain my composure in the final once I realized I clinched my place in the Olympics." [...] Richter scored 623.8 out of a possible 654.0 points during the qualification round of the 10 m air rifle. He would have needed a score of at least 625.5 to qualify for the finals. For the 50 m rifle prone, he scored 622.6 points. He required a score of at least 624.8 to qualify for the final round.|$|E
500|$|Over 13 {{seasons with}} the White Sox, Pierce was the ace of the {{pitching}} staff, leading the team in wins nine times and in strikeouts eight times. He was Chicago's Opening Day starter seven times (1951–52, 1954, 1956–59), and started the home opener in 1953 and 1961. He had an outstanding fastball and an excellent curveball, and in 1951 added the slider (for which he used his motion for the curve rather than the fastball) as a third strong pitch, {{as well as a}} changeup. He worked quickly with an over-the-top motion, dropping his back shoulder in a style similar to that later used by Sandy Koufax. In 1957, Paul Richards noted of Pierce's early style: [...] "He had a tendency to windmill in his delivery, which makes the ball spin too much and takes the life out of it. He flashed his curve-the Yankees always knew when he was throwing a curve. But mainly Bill didn't want to throw anything but fast balls in the old days. He laughed at the change-of-pace and the slider, so most of the strong right-hand hitters were laying back for him, waiting for a fast ball down the middle." [...] After Pierce finally tried the slider against the Yankees, to great effect, Richards noted, [...] "Then, for a while there, he began throwing nothing but sliders. He finally learned about that, too. Even today Pierce will pitch a whole ball game and almost never throw anything but fast balls. But only on certain days." [...] Yankees star Joe DiMaggio was among those praising Pierce's ability, reportedly remarking, [...] "That little so-and-so is a marvel. So little – and all that speed. And I mean speed! He got me out of there on a fastball in the ninth that I'd have needed a telescope to see." [...] Richards became Chicago's manager in 1951, and worked with Pierce to develop his two new pitches and slow down his pace, as well as significantly improve his control; Pierce later recalled, [...] "I learned to control my fastball better [...] Developing the slider helped me tremendously because it gave me a third out pitch. I threw it almost as hard as my fastball, but I could throw it for strikes better than the fast ball or good curve ... Richards made me work on it, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> about two years before it was consistent." [...] After issuing 249 walks in 391 innings in 1949–1950, Pierce gave up only 73 walks in 240 innings in 1951, and averaged more than 3 walks per 9 innings in three seasons afterward. His 1951 ERA of 3.03 was fourth best in the league, and he ranked sixth in 1952 with a mark of 2.57. On September 21, 1952 he broke Doc White's 1907 club record of 141 strikeouts by a left-hander, ending the season with 144.|$|E

A film takes a step like that <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>me</b> where I really don't want to go. I reacted against everybody, I felt alienated from those characters at that moment." ...|$|R
2500|$|Magnani was mystically {{inclined}} and consulted astrologers, {{as well as}} {{believing in}} numerology. She also claimed to be clairvoyant. She ate and drank very little and could subsist for long periods on nothing more than black coffee and cigarettes.

[...] "I wake up {{in a state of}} nerves <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>me</b> hours to get back in touch with reality."
