50|$|The {{refusal to}} re-register the Moscow Church under the Religion Law placed {{its status as}} a legal entity in jeopardy. The {{consequences}} of non-registration as a religious organization within the meaning of the Law were extreme for the Church and its members. As a result of the <b>arbitrary</b> <b>refusal</b> to re-register, the rights of the Church and its parishioners essential to the conduct of their religious activities on anything but the most primitive level were seriously jeopardized, including the ability to own and operate educational institutions including theological schools, to own and maintain religious buildings, to conduct charitable activities, the right to acquire, import and distribute religious literature and the right to invite foreign citizens to preach and conduct religious services.|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that the truth of cold fusion has been dis-credited or ignored in the science world since its infancy until now. Obviously, the poor {{reproducibility}} of cold fusion experiments is mostly to blame for this widespread, long-lasting denial. However, there is another important reason: the fact that the <b>arbitrary</b> <b>refusal</b> or neglect by most of the skeptics has prevented them from realizing and reconsider-ing new findings and progress made by the cold fusioners. While they remained on the sidelines, a new paradigm of science and technology has developed along with the evolu-tion of cold fusion research. This has monumental signifi-cance regarding the explanation and understanding of cold fusion. It was their clinging and depending on the old para-digm, their ignorance and refusal to acknowledge the new paradigm that trapped cold fusion R&D in so many scientif...|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the concept of non-state ‘actors of protection’ in international refugee law. This concept breaks with traditional State-centric readings of international law, as it connotes that a non-state actor may offer ‘protection’ against persecution, comparable to that normally offered by the State. Domestic courts have increasingly made use of the concept as a justification for withholding refugee status from asylum seekers fleeing persecution in areas torn by civil conflict. What is more, the concept has {{found its way into}} EU asylum law, and is now enshrined in Article 7 (1) of the Qualification Directive (recast). Following an analysis of relevant case-law from a number of jurisdictions, it is argued that domestic courts look to two key factors before pronouncing whether a non-state actor is in the position to offer ‘protection’. On the one hand, courts assess whether the non-state actor operates in collaboration or with the consent of the territorial State. On the other hand, they routinely speak to the functions exercised by the non-state actor. The paper suggests that the two factors should be applied concurrently as a safeguard against <b>arbitrary</b> <b>refusals</b> of asylum applications. Finally, it is argued that the classification of widely varying entities under the heading of ‘non-state actors’ is analytically problematic. It results in an assimilation of entities ranging from territorial administrations and peace enforcement missions to warring clans, while potentially it obscures the legal links these entities may have with the territorial State...|$|R
5000|$|Human Rights Watch accused Iraqi {{security}} forces of using torture and improper treatments on prisoners. Arbitrary arrests and {{long periods of}} isolation are now common. Human Right Watch interviewed 90 prisoners, among which 72 {{said they had been}} tortured during interrogation. Sarah Leah Whitson, HRW director, said that the Iraqi provisional government was not holding to its promise to stand by Human Rights: [...] "A new Iraqi government requires more than a change of leadership - it requires a change of attitude about basic human dignity" [...] [...] "During the first three days there was continuous torture. I was beaten with an aluminum rod and with cables. ? Then I was told to sign a statement with my hands tied behind my back, so I didn't even see the paper and I don't know what I signed." [...] Among bad treatments were such elements as beatings with cables, electric shocks, including on genitals, being tied and blindfolded for days, cells so crowded that it is only possible to stand, <b>arbitrary</b> detention, <b>refusal</b> of trials, access to lawyers or contacts with families. These treatments were inflicted to insurgents and criminals alike.|$|R
40|$|With {{adequate}} {{cost containment}} unlikely {{in the foreseeable}} future, health care use {{will have to be}} curtailed, ideally with open and explicit criteria for equitably allocating resources or rationing. Yet, consensus on any such criteria appears remote because Americans cannot say no to health care. Americans may refuse to accept rationing for two reasons. The absence of any global limitation on health care resources may encourage patients to believe that health care resources are not scarce and {{do not need to be}} rationed. A belief in vitalism [...] that everyone is morally entitled to unlimited longevity and good health [...] may discourage setting limits on one's own care. Together, these characteristics may foster the belief that denials of health care services, especially by health insurers, are <b>arbitrary</b> or unfair <b>refusals</b> to pay for existing resources and not a necessary method of rationing scarce resources. If this hypothesis is true, Americans are unlikely to achieve consensus on any equitable allocation of health care unless they face an actual shortage (credible scarcity) of health care resources that makes it necessary to ration care...|$|R
