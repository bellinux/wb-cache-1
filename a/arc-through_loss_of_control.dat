40|$|The {{objective}} of current master’s thesis {{was to investigate}} the associations between emotional fluctuations and emotion regulation difficulties in predicting binge eating episodes in a general population study using ecological momentary assessment (EMA). In addition, emotional experience was assessed in order to compare the differential impact of binge eating with and without <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>control.</b> The sample consisted of 97 women and 61 men in {{with a mean age of}} 22. 35 (SD = 4. 82). The gender differences in eating behavior were also of interest. The results pointed, that fluctuations in negative emotion did indeed predict binge eating with <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> among both men and women. Among women, the emotion regulation difficulties, restrained eating, as well as the interaction of negative emotion fluctuations and emotion regulation difficulties were significant predictors. Among men, impulsivity predicted binge eating episodes with <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>control.</b> Overall, binge eating with <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>control,</b> compared to without <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>control,</b> was significantly more associated with emotion regulation difficulties as well as increased negative emotions indicating the significance <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> in the assessment of eating pathology. It also appeared that women were considerably more sensitive to binge eating with <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> as it resulted in greater levels of negative emotions, whereas among men this tendency was not found. In addition, binge eating without <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> resulted in higher rates in several positive emotions both among men and women...|$|R
40|$|Decision {{making in}} risky {{situations}} is frequently required in {{our everyday lives}} and {{has been shown to}} be influenced by various factors, some of which are independent of the risk context. Based on previous findings and theories about the central role <b>of</b> perceptions <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and their impact on subsequent settings, spillover effects <b>of</b> subjective <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> on risky decision-making are assumed. After developing an innovative experimental paradigm for inducing <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>control,</b> its hypothesized effects on risky decision-making are investigated. Partially supporting the hypotheses, results demonstrated no increased levels of risk perceptions but decreased risk-taking behavior following experiences <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>control.</b> Thus, this study makes a methodological contribution by proposing a newly developed experimental paradigm facilitating further research on the effects <b>of</b> subjective <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>control,</b> and additionally provides partial evidence for the spillover effects <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> experiences on risky decision-making...|$|R

If changes in the mental state of the user {{are reflected in the}} brain signals used for <b>control,</b> the behaviour <b>of</b> a BCI is directly influenced by these states. We investigate the influence of a state <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> in a variant of Pacman on the performance of BCIs based on motor control. To study the effect a temporal <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> has on the BCI performance, BCI classifiers were trained on electroencephalography (EEG) recorded during the normal control condition, and the classification performance on segments of EEG from the normal and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> condition was compared.

50|$|Investigators {{then made}} the {{conclusion}} of the cause of the crash:The accident appears to result from the Captain’s use of the propellers in the reverse beta range, to improve <b>control</b> <b>of</b> his track on short final. A strong thrust asymmetry at the moment when coming out of the reverse beta range would have caused the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> yaw <b>control,</b> then roll <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the aircraft.The investigation could not exclude three other hypotheses which can nevertheless be classified as quite unlikely:* A <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> during a go-around.* A <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> due to a stall.* A <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> due to sudden incapacitation of one of the pilots.The Captain’s lack of recent experience on this airplane type, the undeniable difficulty of conducting an approach to runway 10 at Saint-Barthélemy and the pressure of time during this flight were contributory factors.The low height at which the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> occurred was an aggravating factor.|$|R

Affect theory proposes that <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> eating {{is used to}} cope with negative mood states. Self-report data suggest that negative affect {{may contribute to the}} etiology <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> eating, but this theory has not been well-tested using laboratory paradigms. We examined associations between pre-meal affective states and intake during a laboratory test meal.

Results indicated that pre-meal state negative affect was associated with greater carbohydrate and less protein consumption, as well as greater snack and dessert and less fruit and dairy intake. All girls experienced significant decreases in negative affect from pre- to post-meal, but intake during the meal was unassociated with post-meal affect. In support of affect theory, negative affective states reported among girls with <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> may be a driving factor for increased energy-dense food intake, which {{may play a role in}} excess weight gain...|$|R
