25|$|This {{is a rare}} form of synesthesia where {{individuals}} {{feel the}} same sensation that another person feels (such as touch). For instance, when such a synesthete observes someone being tapped on their shoulder, the synesthete involuntarily feels <b>a</b> <b>tap</b> <b>on</b> their own shoulder as well. People {{with this type of}} synesthesia have been shown to have higher empathy levels compared to the general population. This {{may be related to the}} so-called mirror neurons present in the motor areas of the brain, which have also been linked to empathy.|$|E
25|$|As a cost {{reduction}} measure, especially in high-volume consumer receivers, all the tube heaters could be connected in series across the AC supply using heaters requiring the same current {{and with a}} similar warm-up time. In one such design, <b>a</b> <b>tap</b> <b>on</b> the tube heater string supplied the 6 volts needed for the dial light. By deriving the high voltage from a half-wave rectifier directly connected to the AC mains, the heavy and costly power transformer was eliminated. This also allowed such receivers to operate on direct current, a so-called AC/DC receiver design. Many different US consumer AM radio manufacturers of the era used a virtually identical circuit, given the nickname All American Five.|$|E

500|$|The {{incident}} was widely reported and condemned by the Soviet press. Kharlamov himself believed that [...] "Bobby Clarke {{was given the}} job of taking {{me out of the}} game." [...] The slash was apparently done at the instigation of assistant coach John Ferguson. [...] "I remember that Kharlamov's ankle was hurting pretty bad. I called Clarke over to the bench, looked over at Kharlamov and said, 'I think he needs <b>a</b> <b>tap</b> <b>on</b> the ankle.' I didn't think twice about it. It was Us versus Them. And Kharlamov was killing us. I mean, somebody had to do it."

[...] With the tap placed at the anode end of the primary winding, the tube (valve) is effectively connected as a triode, and if the tap was at the supply end, as a pure pentode. [...] Blumlein discovered that if the tap was {{placed at a distance}} 15–20% down from the supply end of the output transformer, the tube or valve would combine the positive features of both the triode and the pentode design.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the sixth}} {{game of the}} series, Bobby Clarke slashed Kharlamov intentionally, {{fracturing}} a bone in his ankle. He would miss the seventh game of the series, {{and returned to the}} lineup for the final game of the series, but at much reduced effectiveness. At the time, many felt the slash was intentional. Assistant coach John Ferguson would later say [...] "I called (Bobby) Clarke over to the bench, looked over at Kharlamov and said, 'I think he needs <b>a</b> <b>tap</b> <b>on</b> the ankle'." [...] As for Kharlamov himself, he had little doubt that an attempt had been made to limit his effectiveness, [...] "I'm convinced that Bobby Clarke was given the job of taking me out of the game." [...] Kharlamov's injury, and his diminished play in the aftermath have been regarded as a turning point for the series in Canada's favour, who won the series in the eighth and final game.|$|E

She had invested great and desperate hopes in the cake, like an artist working on a great piece of art, and in her mind, she failed.

2500|$|While {{there are}} no hidden {{messages}} in the architecture, {{there have been numerous}} occurrences and reports of alleged ghostly phenomena. The Egyptian has been widely rumored to be the home of two ghosts. One is said to be that of Irv Kummerfeldt, co-founder of PET; Kummerfeldt had a heart attack and died at the top of [...] "Aisle One" [...] in the Egyptian Theatre's auditorium. His ghost has been reported in that area of the theatre ever since. The second ghost, [...] "Bob," [...] as theatre workers and preservationists have dubbed it, is much more free roaming. Bob has been seen throughout the building; objects have moved on their own, doors have opened on their own, and people have felt <b>a</b> <b>tap</b> <b>on</b> their shoulder when no one else is around. Occasionally, footsteps have been heard echoing across the auditorium. The theatre operators and preservationists lend enough credence to the ghost sightings and stories to {{keep an eye out for}} any information in old newspapers on who the ghost might have been.|$|E

After being on the {{receiving}} end of some stick work from Kharlamov while going for the puck, Clarke caught up with Kharlamov and laid a two-handed slash across his ankle, breaking it in the process. Though Kharlamov finished the game, he missed the seventh game and was largely ineffective in the eighth. When asked about the slash years later, Clarke said, [...] "If I hadn't learned to lay on a two-hander once in a while, I'd never have left Flin Flon." [...] 30 years after the series, Henderson criticized Clarke, calling the slash, [...] "the low point of the series." [...] Clarke responded saying that he thought it was [...] "improper to criticize a teammate thirty years later," [...] and that he did not [...] "understand why he would bring it up now." [...] Henderson has since retracted his criticism. Kharlamov, prior to his death in 1981, said he thought Clarke was tasked with [...] "taking me out of the game." [...] John Ferguson, Sr., an assistant coach with Team Canada in 1972, said, [...] "I called Clarke over to the bench, looked over at Kharlamov and said, 'I think he needs <b>a</b> <b>tap</b> <b>on</b> the ankle.' I didn't think twice about it. It was Us versus Them. And Kharlamov was killing us. I mean, somebody had to do it. And I sure wasn't going to ask Henderson."
