Enhanced antibacterial action of fine particles compared to bulk material is not exclusive to ZnO and is observed for other materials, such as silver.

5|$|Lygon's successor, the {{politician}} Rufus Isaacs, the Marquess of Reading, became the Lord Warden in 1934, holding jovial family gatherings there. His wife, Stella, attempted to restore Wellington's old bedroom to its earlier appearance during the Duke's tenure and, {{as part of}} this project, the 4th Duke of Wellington agreed to send the original contents of the room back to the castle, where they still remain. The politician Freeman Freeman-Thomas, the Marquess of Willingdon, became Lord Warden in 1936, followed by Sir Winston Churchill who followed him in 1941 during the Second World War. Churchill noted to the Minister of Works and Buildings that he had told King George V on taking up the position that he doubted that {{he would be able to}} live at Walmer Castle during the war, as it was within range of the German artillery along the French coast, or indeed that he would able to afford to live there afterwards, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>reason</b> he hoped that the state would maintain the castle and gardens, and decide what use it should be put to after the war.|$|E
5|$|On 28 October, {{selections}} began {{for women}} to be relocated to Bergen-Belsen. More than 8,000 women, including Anne and Margot Frank, and Auguste van Pels, were transported. Edith Frank was left behind and died from starvation. Tents were erected at Bergen-Belsen to accommodate the influx of prisoners, and as the population rose, the death toll due to disease increased rapidly. Frank was briefly reunited with two friends, Hanneli Goslar and Nanette Blitz, who were confined in another section of the camp. Goslar and Blitz survived the war, and discussed the brief conversations they had conducted with Frank through a fence. Blitz described Anne as bald, emaciated, and shivering. Goslar noted Auguste van Pels was with Anne and Margot Frank, and was caring for Margot, who was severely ill. Neither of them saw Margot, as she {{was too weak to}} leave her bunk. Anne told Blitz and Goslar she believed her parents were dead, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>reason</b> she did not wish to live any longer. Goslar later estimated their meetings had taken place in late January or early February 1945.|$|E

Also, it can lead to the development of alcohol-related problems in later years, such as alcohol dependence.|$|E
25|$|The Higgs {{particle}} is {{a massive}} scalar elementary particle theorized by Peter Higgs in 1964 when he showed Goldstone's 1962 theorem (generic continuous symmetry which is spontaneously broken) provides a third polarisation of a massive vector field. Hence, Goldstone's original scalar doublet, the massive spin-zero particle, was proposed as the Higgs boson. (see 1964 PRL symmetry breaking papers) and is a key building block in the Standard Model. It has no intrinsic spin, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>reason</b> is classified as a boson (like the gauge bosons, which have integer spin).|$|E

A few Spaniards acquired prime agricultural lands left vacant by the indigenous demographic disaster. Portions of the province could support sugar cultivation and as early as the 1530s sugar production was underway. New Spain's first viceroy, Don Antonio de Mendoza established an hacienda on lands taken from Orizaba.|$|E

40|$|Electronic {{nicotine}} {{delivery systems}} (ENDS) —commonly called ‘electronic cigarettes’ — {{are at the}} centre of a polarised debate. How should they be regulated? Central to the debate has been the concern that electronic cigarettes {{could lead to the}} ‘renormalisation’ of smoking <b>and</b> <b>that,</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>reason,</b> the regulation of ENDS should be modelled on the regulation of conventional cigarettes. I argue that concerns about the renormalisation of smoking can lend support to restrictions on marketing of ENDS but that these arguments are problematic when used to support restrictions on where ENDS can be used. The debate has been insufficiently sensitive to the ethical complexities surrounding attempts to manipulate social norms to change health behaviours; these complexities must also inform the debate about ENDS and their regulation...|$|R
