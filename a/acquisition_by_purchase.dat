40|$|While {{corporations}} have been increasingly recurring to minority acquisitions for accessing valuable external resources, empirical {{research shows that}} acquirers expected performance suffers upon minority acquisition announcements. Since the profitability of these transactions {{has been linked to}} acquirer’s ability to influence the target’s decisions, insights from research on ownership issues would suggest that acquirers could obtain more value from minority <b>acquisitions</b> <b>by</b> <b>purchasing</b> larger fractions of the targets’ equity. Yet, comparative corporate governance research remarks that larger minority equity ownership not necessarily leads to greater influence on corporate actions due to institutional-level and firm-level factors. This study explores whether these factors, by affecting the tightness of the relationship between influence and size of minority equity ownership, also moderate the relationship between acquirers’ expected performance and acquisitions of larger minority equity stakes. Through an event study on a sample of 197 minority acquisitions, we observe that acquirers report negative stock market reactions upon minority acquisitions’ announcement. Interestingly, we find that such effect is less negative when they purchase large minority stakes of target firms whose control is contestable. Conversely, we find that acquisitions of larger fractions of equity produce a more negative effect when the target’s controlling shareholder has significant control and when minority shareholder protection is weak...|$|R
50|$|Land for {{the forest}} was {{acquired}} by the town {{over a period of}} just over twenty years, beginning in 1936. Much of the land was historically in agricultural use, but the poor quality of the land for cultivation, and the cost of maintaining town roads into remote areas led to a decline in the hill farms in this area. Land <b>acquisitions</b> (some <b>by</b> <b>purchase,</b> other <b>by</b> taking for back taxes) were typically followed by efforts to replant the open lands that were previously pasture or cultivated land. Buildings were demolished, but foundations and other artifacts such as stone walls remain as a feature of the forest's landscape. The land was formally designated a town forest in 1958. It was not until the 1980s that it was brought under a formally developed management plan, and the recreational trail network was cut in the 2000s.|$|R

40|$|Announcements of {{acquisitions}} {{of publicly}} traded companies are usually accompanied by their share price booming by tens of percent. The underlying {{reason is that the}} acquirer of the company gains a controlling stake, due to which he can help the company pivot in the desired direction or benefit from synergy effects. A minority investor, by definition, is not capable of doing this, thus he is willing to pay a lower price for the shares than the acquirer of the controlling stake. The thesis analyzes whether a minority shareholder can profit from the <b>acquisition</b> premium <b>by</b> <b>purchasing</b> shares of companies which he believes will be later acquired. The paper consists of two parts - theoretical and analytic. The theoretical part discusses the significance of the acquisition premium and its value, with regard to the type of investor and his motivations for the acquisition.
