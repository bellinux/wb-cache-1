5|$|In 1978, the {{archaeologist}} {{and historian}} Patrick Healy discovered {{the remains of}} a prehistoric wedge tomb in the woods. All the survives is the skeletal outline of the main chamber and the outer double walls. Most of the stones were removed to build the low stone wall that runs <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the tomb.|$|E
5|$|By Monday May 8, {{the fire}} {{perimeter}} extended from west of Highway 154, {{in the hills}} burned in the 1990 Painted Cave Fire, <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> country of the Santa Ynez Mountains east through Mission Canyon, Rattlesnake Canyon, and into the hills above Montecito, reaching the area burned by the Gap Fire in July 2008 and the Tea Fire in November 2008. Intense sundowner winds caused the fire to spread rapidly during evening and nighttime hours during its first three days.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the Flames {{introduced}} a new third jersey to replace their throwback uniform. The newest design is Western-inspired, with a script Calgary in black <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the jersey, and black shoulders with points on the front mimicking cowboy wear. This uniform was used until the 2015–16 season, after which the throwback third uniforms used from 2010 to 2013 were revived anew.|$|E

5|$|The Germans {{launched}} a renewed effort {{to push through}} to Amiens on 5 April, two armies attacking <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the British Third Army. The New Zealanders experienced a heavy bombardment which began at 5:00am which cut off communications and later that day suffered two separate but disorganised attacks by infantry. The first was fended off but the second recaptured La Signy farm. An attempt to push on to the main trenches of the New Zealanders was rebuffed with heavy losses inflicted by the Wellington Company of the Machine Gun Battalion.|$|E
5|$|Vehicle {{occupants}} {{who wear}} seat belts {{have a lower}} incidence of TBI after a motor vehicle accident. However, if the strap is situated <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the neck (instead of the chest), this {{increases the risk of}} tracheal injury. Design of medical instruments can be modified to prevent iatrogenic TBI, and medical practitioners can use techniques that reduce the risk of injury with procedures such as tracheotomy.|$|E

5|$|Weather fronts. Significant shear is {{observed}} {{when the temperature}} difference <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> is 5°C (9°F) or more, and the front moves at 30 knots or faster. Because fronts are three-dimensional phenomena, frontal shear can be observed at any altitude between surface and tropopause, and therefore be seen both horizontally and vertically. Vertical wind shear above warm fronts {{is more of an}} aviation concern than near and behind cold fronts due to their greater duration.|$|E
5|$|Architecturally, smaller churches {{will feature}} bright lighting, large windows, a simple {{platform}} with a pulpit in the center, and an altar ("a bench <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> {{of the church}} below the platform"). Larger churches will have direct access from the balcony to the main sanctuary near the platform so that respondents to altar calls can easily come forward, a large open area {{in front of the}} platform to accommodate altar call gatherings, and the platform itself is usually large to accommodate a large choir and musical instruments. Because the Assemblies of God practice baptism by immersion, many churches will include a baptistry {{at the rear of the}} platform.|$|E
5|$|Cold fronts feature narrow {{bands of}} {{thunderstorms}} and severe weather, {{and may be}} preceded by squall lines and dry lines. Cold fronts are sharper surface boundaries with more significant horizontal wind shear than warm fronts. When a front becomes stationary, it can degenerate into a line which separates regions of differing wind speed, known as a shear line, though the wind direction <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> normally remains constant. In the tropics, tropical waves move {{from east to west}} across the Atlantic and eastern Pacific basins. Directional and speed shear can occur across the axis of stronger tropical waves, as northerly winds precede the wave axis and southeast winds are seen behind the wave axis. Horizontal wind shear can also occur along local land breeze and sea breeze boundaries.|$|E

5|$|Hannibal, on {{the other}} hand, had {{deployed}} his forces based on the particular fighting qualities of each unit, taking into consideration both their strengths and weaknesses. This aspect of Hannibal's leadership was highlighted {{in the use of}} a Spanish unit, the Balearic slingers, whom he placed behind the infantry to hurl their ranged missiles into the masses of Roman troops. He placed his Iberians and Gauls in the middle, alternating the ethnic composition <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> line, with himself at the front and center. Infantry from Punic Africa was on the wings at the very edge of his infantry line. These infantry were battle-hardened, remained cohesive and would attack the Roman flanks.|$|E
5|$|Jesé {{is able to}} play <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> line, {{operating}} {{either as}} an attacking midfielder, second striker or centre-forward, or in his favoured position out on the wing. During his time at the Castilla, Jesé was often deployed in a false 9 role in the team's 4–3–3 formation, and regularly switched flanks due to his ability to use both feet. In 2013, {{in his role as}} the club's sporting director at the time, Zinedine Zidane declared himself an admirer of Jesé's direct style of football and goal scoring ability. Following Jesé's promotion to Real Madrid's first team in 2013, manager Carlo Ancelotti played him in a winger position, where he could cut inside from the wing both with the ball and without, to create chances and score goals.|$|E
5|$|On 17 May, {{supported}} by Fliegerkorps VI, the German army took the initiative, as Kleist's 3rd Panzer Corps and 44th Army Corps began a counterattack on the Barvenkovo bridgehead {{from the area}} of Aleksandrovka in the south. Aided greatly by air support, Kleist was able to crush Soviet positions and advanced up to ten kilometres in {{the first day of}} the attack. Many of the Soviet units were sent to the rear that night to be refitted, while others were moved forward to reinforce tenuous positions <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>front.</b> That same day, Timoshenko reported the move to Moscow and asked for reinforcements and described the day's failures. Vasilevsky's attempts to gain approval for a general withdrawal were rejected by Stalin.|$|E

5|$|As B Company moved forward, {{their left}} flank was engaged by a machine-gun {{from a small}} party of Viet Cong to their front, while sniper fire intensified. The Australians {{continued}} to advance with co-ordinated fire and movement, but were now receiving fire from three directions. Ten minutes after stepping off, B Company crossed the front of A Company, forcing them to cease their covering fire. Without support, the Australians were now assaulting a well dug-in and largely unseen Viet Cong force that was disposed in a wide arc. Penetrating the position, the Australian flanks were increasingly exposed to fire, while the dense undergrowth obscured the Viet Cong pits and reduced visibility {{to just a few}} metres. Both the lead Australian platoons were soon enveloped, as fire swept <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of B Company from the Viet Cong engaging them with heavy machine-guns, claymore mines and light mortars. Meanwhile, Viet Cong snipers continued to engage the Australians from the rear, who unsuccessfully attempted to regain the initiative with small arms fire and grenades. The assault soon faltered with steadily increasing casualties.|$|E
5|$|Gidley {{lost control}} of the {{rear-end}} of his car exiting turn 11 while accelerating and hit the outside wall which broke his right-front suspension on the same lap. He stopped on the frontstretch and retired from the race. Gidley was unhurt. The ninth period of yellow flags were shown on lap 73 to allow track officials to recover Gidley's damaged car. The race resumed on lap 76 with Andretti leading the field. The tenth caution was necessitated when de Ferran went to the inside of turn three and came <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> wing of da Matta. Jourdain was collected, and Kanaan spun to avoid the two drivers who temporarily blocked the track. De Ferran, da Matta and Jourdain retired, while Kanaan continued without damaging his car. Andretti retained his lead at the lap-79 restart, Fittipaldi was passed by Fernández for fourth position in the first turn. Zanardi moved from eighth to sixth by lap 82, while Fernández got ahead of Junqueira for third on the same lap. Between the 85th and 86th laps, Fittipaldi drove aggressively in an attempt to move in front of Junqueira for fourth but was unable to pass him.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Nebi Samuel has officially been {{identified}} by the British as beginning on 17 November and finishing on 24 November 1917. But until 21 November infantry from the 75th Division was still continuing its advance towards Bireh. On that day, as the infantry division turned north east cutting <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the 52nd (Lowland) Division, their progress was blocked at Biddu by Ottoman forces entrenched on the height of Nebi Samuel, dominating Jerusalem and its defences. This hill, the traditional site of {{the tomb of the}} Prophet Samuel, was taken late in the evening by the 234th Brigade, 75th Division, after fierce fighting. The 52nd (Lowland) Division had taken the more difficult line, while the 75th Division was directed to the south western approaches. Several counterattacks by Ottoman forces during the following days failed. In close fighting, Ottoman soldiers strongly counterattacked, reaching the gates of the mosque before Gurkha infantry fought them off. Fevzi's Seventh Army had fought Allenby's two infantry divisions to a standstill.|$|E

5|$|The first Stuka loss on the Soviet-German front {{occurred}} early at 03:40–03:47 in {{the morning}} of the 22 June. While being escorted by Bf 109s from JG 51 to attack Brest Fortress, Oberleutnant Karl Führing of StG 77 was shot down by an I-153. The dive bomber wing suffered only two losses on the opening day of Barbarossa. As a result of the Luftwaffe's attention, the Soviet Air Force in the western Soviet Union was nearly destroyed. The official report claimed 1,489 Soviet aircraft destroyed. Göring ordered this checked. After picking their way through the wreckage <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>front,</b> Luftwaffe officers found that the tally exceeded 2,000. In the next two days, the Soviets reported the loss of another 1,922 aircraft. Soviet aerial resistance continued but ceased to be effective and the Luftwaffe maintained air superiority {{until the end of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|Israeli {{forces from}} the Carmeli Brigade first {{captured}} al-Birwa and positions overlooking it on 11 June 1948 as part of Operation Ben-Ami, a day before the first truce of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. During the fighting, 45 elderly residents hid in the church with the priest. The defenders of the village surrendered after losing men and running out of ammunition. The residents took refuge in nearby villages for thirteen days. Nevertheless, clashes continued during the truce. According to local militiamen from al-Birwa, 96 men from the village armed with rifles, and {{an equal number of}} men armed with non-firearms and unarmed women assembled near {{the front lines of the}} Arab Liberation Army (ALA). The rifle-armed force charged first <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> lines, followed by the men armed with axes, shovels, and sticks, and then the women who carried water to assist the wounded. Al-Birwa's ad-hoc militia took the small force of Haganah soldiers (who became part of the Israel Defense Forces on 26 May) by surprise and forced them back a kilometer west of al-Birwa. Afterward, al-Birwa's residents harvested their crops. They remained in the village until 24 June, when ALA commanders suggested that they join their families in the nearby villages. The militiamen claimed that the ALA stood by during the clashes because they did not receive orders from their superiors.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the 1 RAR Anti-Tank Platoon—commanded by Lieutenant Les Tranter—also {{engaged with}} Splintex from their 90mm RCLs, firing <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the mortars and {{relieving}} the immediate pressure on them. However, with the North Vietnamese having successfully achieved a break-in, and {{faced with the}} possibility of imminent annihilation, the 1 RAR Mortar Platoon second-in-command—Lieutenant Tony Jensen—was forced to direct the RCLs onto his own position, to which Bennett agreed. As the North Vietnamese attempted to turn the captured mortars against the Australians, the flechette darts swept the area, clearing everything above ground, causing heavy casualties among the assaulting force and damaging a number of mortar tubes. Elsewhere, the North Vietnamese assault had reached the Australian gun position, over-running two guns as desperate close quarters fighting broke out between the emplacements. The attackers subsequently succeeded in capturing No. 6 gun on the extreme edge of the gun-line and then attempted to destroy it with satchel charges. In both the mortar and artillery positions the North Vietnamese and Australians occupied adjacent pits, fighting each other at close range for their possession. The gun position officer—Captain Ian Ahearn—co-ordinated the defence, and the Australians finally drove off the assault with grenades and small arms, as well as Splintex rounds fired from the Anti-Tank Platoon. Meanwhile, with the assault falling mainly on 1 RAR and 102nd Field Battery, to the west 3 RAR had largely remained out of contact.|$|E
