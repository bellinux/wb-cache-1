40|$|AbstractObjectives: to {{determine}} the ability of duplex sonography to intraoperatively detect technical problems with renal artery reconstructions. Design: retrospective evaluation of a standard protocol. Patients and methods: the outcome of intraoperative duplex was compared with postoperative angiography, surface duplex, MRA, echo or direct inspection in case of re-exploration in 77 renal artery reconstructions in 62 patients. These included six extracorporeal reconstructions, eight and 17 reconstructions with an artery and autogenous vein respectively, 10 renal artery re-implantations in the <b>aorta</b> (<b>prosthesis),</b> 32 endarterectomies and four reconstructions of kidney transplant vessels. Results: intraoperative duplex was normal in 67 / 73 reconstructions with sufficient data. In six cases technical problems were revealed by intraoperative duplex and the reconstruction was re-explored. After re-exploration intraoperative duplex was normal in all cases. Confirmatory studies demonstrated normal results in 61 / 64 reconstructions with normal intraoperative duplex and abnormal results in 6 / 6 reconstructions with technical problems revealed by intraoperative duplex. Three reconstructions with normal intraoperative duplex occluded as demonstrated by angiography less than 2 weeks after surgery. Conclusions: renal duplex sonography is a valuable method available for intraoperative detection of technical problems. Haemodynamic duplex data were less important than B-mode imaging in discriminating between normal and abnormal reconstruction...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aim: Despite {{advances}} in medical imaging, infection of cardiovascular (CVS) devices remains a challenging diagnostic problem. Accurate and timely diagnosis typically requires {{the correlation of}} imaging findings with laboratory data. 99 mTcRHMPAORWBC SPECT/CT has high diagnostic yield in CVS infection, accurately defining the disease extent. The use of [18 F]FDG PET/CT for assessing CVS device infections is also rapidly growing, despite certain wellRknown drawbacks. To better clarify the role of these two imaging procedures we evaluated with [18 F]FDG PET/CT and 99 mTcRHMPAORWBC SPECT/CT within 7 days from each other. Patients and method: 12 patients with suspected CVS device infection (aortic valve n= 4, aortic valve + thoracic <b>aorta</b> <b>prosthesis</b> n= 5, vascular graft n= 3) were enrolled. When interpreting images, we considered positive for infection any site showing increasing uptake of radiolabelled WBCs from early to late and delayed images for 99 mTcRHMPAORWBC scintigraphy, {{and the appearance of}} focal [18 F]FDG uptake around the device for PET/CT, respectively. Results of the procedures were compared with transthoracic and/or transesophageal ecocardiographic findings, contrastRenhanced CT, microbiology, response to treatment, and clinical followRup. Results: According to the criteria described above, PET/CT and 99 mTcRHMPAORWBC imaging were concordantly trueRpositive in 6 / 12 and trueRnegative in 1 case. Imaging results were discordant in 5 patients (all with a negative 99 mTcRHMPAORWBC scan). Three patients presented falseRpositive results at PET/CT, that were in 2 cases of early aortic mechanical valve suspected endocarditis and in 1 case of suspected vascular graft infection. [18 F]FDG PET/CT detected lung cancer and vasculitis as the sustaining causes of fever in the remaining two patients with suspected vascular prosthesis infection and endocarditis, respectively. Conclusions: Although preliminary, these results suggest that even with the aid of specific interpretation criteria for [18 F]FDG, falseRpositive findings at PET/CT should be always considered and adequately ruled out, particularly in early postRsurgical infections...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in technology {{have resulted in the}} development of minimally invasive approaches to reduce risk of major aortic surgery. The problems of the complex study of the transluminally placed endoluminal aortic stent-grafts is becoming increasingly important because of the treatment of aortic pathology. The development of endoluminal treatment of this pathology required more accurate experimental data on the new devices and healing response of a stent-grafts. The experimental animal study of self expanding "nitinol/dacron" intraluminal stent-grafts (Medtronix/AneuRx, Cupertino, CA, USA) was carried out. Forty-eight adult sheep were used for this study. Eighteen bifurcated and 12 straight stent-grafts were placed to exclude abdominal aortic aneurysms created surgically. Eighteen straight stent-grafts were deployed in the thoracic <b>aorta.</b> Stent-graft <b>prostheses</b> were properly deployed and all aneurysms were excluded. All straight and 11 of 12 bifurcated were patent at the time of explant at the various time intervals between one week to one year. Stent-grafts were well incorporated and were without mural thrombus. There was no stent-graft migration. Results indicated that endoluminal stent-grafts can effectively treat experimental aortic aneurysms with consistent patency, secure fixation, and good incorporation into the aortic wall in this animal modelSeparate summary in Latvian, English, German, 28 p.

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{traditional}} “sandwich” {{technology of}} anastomosis between the dissected aortic wall and synthetic vascular prosthesis in the surgical treatment of acute aortic dissection type A {{does not fully}} meet the idea of an urgent surgical treatment of patients with this disease. We evaluated the experience of the new “invaginated” technique of anastomoses formation. MATERIAL AND METHODS We compared the results of surgical treatment of patients with the “sandwich” and “invaginated” technique of anastomotic formation. The parameters of bleeding, cardiopulmonary bypass time, mortality, as well as {{the state of the}} false lumen in the early and late postoperative periods have been studied. CONCLUSION Invaginative formation of anastomosis between the <b>aorta</b> and vascular <b>prosthesis</b> provides good immediate hemostatic effect and creates the best conditions for fi lling the false lumen in the treatment of acute aortic dissection type A. </p...|$|R
40|$|AIM: It was {{the aim of}} {{this study}} to {{investigate}} the long- term effects of reduced aortic compliance on cardiovascular hemodynamics and cardiac remodeling. METHOD: Sixteen swine, divided into 2 groups, a control and a banding group, were instrumented for pressure and flow measurement in the ascending <b>aorta.</b> Teflon <b>prosthesis</b> was wrapped around the aortic arch in order to limit wall compliance in the banding group. Hemodynamic parameters were recorded throughout a 60 -day period. After sacrifice, the mean cell surface of the left ventricle was documented. RESULTS: Banding decreased aortic compliance by 49 +/- 9, 44 +/- 16 and 42 +/- 7 % on the 2 nd, 30 th and 60 th postoperative day, respectively (p < 0. 05), while systolic pressure increased by 41 +/- 11, 30 +/- 11 and 35 +/- 12 % (p < 0. 05), and pulse pressure by 86 +/- 27, 76 +/- 21 and 88 +/- 23 %, respectively (p < 0. 01). Aortic characteristic impedance increased significantly in the banding group. Diastolic pressure, cardiac output and peripheral resistance remained unaltered. The mean left ventricular cell surface area increased significantly in the banding group. CONCLUSIONS: Acute reduction in aortic compliance results in a significant increase in characteristic and input impedance, a significant decrease in systemic arterial compliance and a subsequent increase in systolic and pulse pressures leading to left ventricular hypertrophy...|$|R
40|$|Before the {{development}} of standard aortic valve replacement, Hufnagel treated aortic insufficiency by implanting a ball-valve prosthesis in the descending thoracic aorta. In a patient who, after four major thoracic procedures, ultimately received two mechanical bileaflet valves in series (one in the ascending {{and one in the}} descending <b>aorta),</b> the downstream <b>prosthesis</b> became progressively immobilized, with total blockage of the leaflets in the open position due to insufficient transvalvular negative pressure gradient, After evaluation of this particular situation in an experimental model, we predicted blockage of the downstream prosthesis, once the ascending valve had regained normal function, and easily cleared the blockage of the distal valve by removing the two leaflets using balloon inflation. Normal circulation was clinically restored in three separate steps. (a) Normal function was re-established surgically in the ascending aorta position. (b) A second thoracotomy was avoided by endovascular dislocation of both blocked descending thoracic leaflets through endovascular balloon inflation. (c) Both leaflets embolized {{to the level of the}} left common iliac artery, where the nearly intact leaflets were removed. surgically, finally creating a near-normal circulatory situation...|$|R
40|$|Arterial {{prostheses}} seeded with autogenous {{vascular endothelium}} demonstrate a well-organized, cellular, inner lining. To determine {{the nature of}} the lining cells, six animals underwent replacement of the infrarenal <b>aorta</b> with Dacron <b>prostheses.</b> During the preparation of three such grafts, endothelium was scraped from the saphenous vein with a steel wool pledget, suspended in chilled Sack's solution, and mixed with blood used to preclot the graft. This suspension was omitted from the three control grafts. After six weeks, the grafts were removed, rinsed and examined. Fluorescent Factor VIII related antigen (F VIII-RA) strongly stained the lining cells. Silver nitrate Haütchen and electron microscopy preparations revealed a lining pattern characteristic of vascular endothelium. Endothelial cell-specific Weibel-Palade bodies were identified in the lining cell cytoplasm. Masson's trichrome staining revealed a relatively collagen-poor connective tissue within the seeded fabric. Transmission electron microscopy disclosed vascular smooth muscle cells between the seeded graft fabric and the lining cells. Vasa vasorum, arising from the outer capsule, penetrated the fabric to supply the inner capsules of the seeded grafts. It is concluded that the cells lining seeded canine arterial prostheses are true vascular endothelium supported by vascular smooth muscle cells, that the lining contains minimal connective tissue, and that vasa vasorum develop. Unseeded control grafts lacked these features...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivePressure {{recovery}} {{results in}} Doppler gradients greater than catheter gradients and {{is well established}} in association with bileaflet mechanical aortic valves. Because pressure recovery is influenced by orifice geometry, it might manifest differently with various valve prostheses. If true, then the reliability of Doppler echocardiography for the estimation of aortic valve gradients might be different with different prostheses. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to test, in an in vitro setting, the degree to which pressure recovery results in Doppler overestimation of gradients for three commonly used aortic valve prostheses. MethodsCarpentier Edwards Perimount, Medtronic Mosaic, and St. Jude Medical bileaflet prostheses were tested under various flow conditions in a pulsatile mock flow loop with a normal aorta size. Mean pressure gradient was assessed with transducers 1 cm and 10 cm distal to the valve and with Doppler echocardiography. Pressure recovery was defined as the difference between the Doppler gradient and a 10 -cm gradient. The percentage of the maximum pressure gradient composed of pressure recovery and the percentage of pressure recovery complete 1 cm distal to the valve were calculated. ResultsThere was substantial pressure recovery for all valves in all flow states. Pressure recovery was responsible for 50 % or more of the Doppler gradients for almost all conditions and was more than 70 % complete within 1 cm for almost all conditions. Multivariate analysis found that flow and valve area (but not valve type) were predictors of pressure recovery; that flow was the major predictor of the percentage of Doppler gradient composed of pressure recovery (with minor contributions from the <b>aorta</b> size and <b>prosthesis</b> type); and that valve type and aorta size were the major predictors of the percentage of pressure recovery complete at 1 cm. ConclusionsIn an in vitro model with a normal aorta size, substantial pressure recovery occurred with all three aortic valve prostheses. Although statistically significant differences were found between valve types in the percentage of pressure recovery and percentage of pressure recovery complete at 1 cm, the differences were small and clinically unimportant. Clinically, among patients with an ascending aorta diameter less than 3. 0 cm, Doppler echocardiography likely substantially overestimates aortic valve mean gradient, regardless of prosthesis type...|$|R

Methods: Ten rabbits were randomly selected to conduct the experiment. Five rabbits underwent direct anastomosis of infrarenal abdominal <b>aorta,</b> with glued <b>prosthesis.</b> In five other rabbits, reconstruction was done by sutured anastomosis. All animals were immediately examined by echo-Doppler for patency of anastomosis. The burst pressure of the glued anastomosis was measured and compared with that of a sutured artery. The animals were euthanized, and tissue samples were taken for histological examination immediately after the experiment. Results: Compared to conventional anastomoses, sutureless vascular anastomoses required shorter time of creation and significantly reduced blood loss (P< 5 %). There was no significant difference on the average blood flow through the anastomosis between two groups at the end of surgery. All anastomoses with glued prosthesis, examined by echo-Doppler, were patent at the anastomotic site, except one, which was stenosed immediately after surgery. In the control group, except one with stenosis, all conventional anastomoses were patent. Mean burst pressure at the anastomotic site for sutureless anastomoses was lower than in control group. Macroscopically, the BioGlue did not demonstrate any adhesion to the surrounding tissue as it was covered by the vascular prosthesis. Histological examination showed low-grade inflammatory reaction in glued anastomoses versus no inflammatory reaction at the sutured anastomoses. Conclusion: This technique may provide a feasible and successful alternative in vascular surgery. However, further long-term studies are necessary to elucidate the break pressure and degree of inflammation at the anastomotic site.

40|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{replacement of}} a diseased aortic valve, aortic root and ascending <b>aorta</b> with a <b>prosthesis</b> {{is known as}} Bentall procedure (Bentall and De Bono in Thorax 23 : 338, 1968). This is a nowadays standard surgical approach in which the Valsalva sinuses of the aortic root are sacrificed and the coronary arteries are reconnected directly to the graft. The important function of the natural sinuses {{in the presence of}} the natural valve is well established; however, very little information is available about whether or not their presence can affect the functioning of a prosthetic bi-leaflet valve and the coronary flow. In the present work, we study the effect of the aortic root geometry on the blood flow through such devices, focusing the attention on the coronary entry-flow. Three root geometries have been considered, two mimicking the prostheses used in practice by surgeons (a straight tube, and the more recent tube with a circular pseudo-sinus), and a third maintaining the natural shape with three sinuses, obtained by Reul et al. (J Biomech 23 : 181 – 191, 1990) by averaging numerous angiographies of the aortic root in healthy patients. Direct numerical simulations of the flow inside the three prostheses, assumed as undeformable, under physiological pulsatile inflow conditions are presented. The dynamics of the valvular leaflets is obtained by a fully-coupled fluid–structure-interaction approach and the coronary perfusion is reproduced by modulating in time an equivalent porosity, an thus the resistance, of the coronary channels. The results indicate that the sinuses do not significantly influence the coronary entry flow, in agreement with the in vivo observations of De Paulis et al. (Eur J Cardio-thorac Surg 26 : 66 – 72, 2004). Nevertheless, the peak pressure at the joints of the coronary arteries is smaller in the natural-like aortic root geometry. The latter also produces a further beneficial effect of a reduction in the leaflets’ angular velocity at the closure onto the valvular ring. These phenomena, if confirmed in more realistic clinical conditions, suggest that the use of a prothesis with physiologic sinuses would potentially reduce the local pressure peak, with the associated risk of post-operative bleeding and pseudo-aneurysm formation. It would also reduce the haemolysis effects caused by the red blood cells squashing between impacting solid artificial surfaces...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{assessed}} the feasibility {{and efficacy of}} a new sutureless connector for end-to-end arterial anastomosis. MethodsThe anastomotic device is a connector consisting of a bare-metal stent with spikes covering its outer surface, which is introduced through the prosthesis. The seal of the anastomosis is obtained by inflating a balloon anchoring the stent with the spikes in the prosthesis and in the receiving artery. This experiment was conducted in three phases: (1) A feasibility study was done on four cadaveric femoral arteries using a polytetrafluoroethylene prosthesis, with measurement of the penetration of the spikes into the layers of the arterial wall. (2) Bench tests were conducted in seven automated and in seven sutured anastomoses. Anastomosis sealing was tested using a pump system (≤ 250 mm Hg) in a water-filled closed circuit. (3) The infrarenal aorta of seven pigs was replaced with a 6 - to 8 -mm diameter prosthesis, using this automated device for the proximal anastomosis. The distal anastomosis was handsewn on the aortic bifurcation. After completion angiography, animals were euthanized for macroscopic and histologic studies of the <b>aorta,</b> connector, and <b>prosthesis.</b> Explantations were done immediately (2 pigs), and at 15 (2 pigs), at 30 (2 pigs), and 42 days (1 pig). Study end points were the automated anastomosis time compared with manual suturing, leakage, mechanical strength, and patency of the anastomosis together with the histologic changes of the aortic wall {{in contact with the}} spiked stent. ResultsTests performed on four cadaveric arteries showed complete penetration of the spikes into the arterial wall layers without metal fracture. Tests of traction showed that the median force needed to rupture the automated anastomosis was 18. 3 N (interquartile range [IQR], 17. 7 - 19. 9 N), with no significant difference from the handmade anastomosis (19. 5 N; IQR, 17. 9 - 20. 2 N, P =. 33). No leakage was demonstrated in vitro with a pulsatile flow and a pressure up to 250 mm Hg. The median automated anastomosis time on pig aorta was 2. 4 minutes (IQR, 1. 4 - 3. 3 min) vs 17. 0 minutes (IQR, 15. 1 - 17. 2 minutes) for the handmade aortic anastomosis performed on the same animals (P =. 002). There was no anastomotic leak. Histology showed incorporation of the connector spikes in the aortic wall, without intimal hyperplasia or false aneurysm. ConclusionsThis preliminary study confirms the feasibility of this sutureless system, suggesting its usefulness for a faster and simpler anastomosis in hybrid arterial surgery. Clinical RelevanceAutomated anastomotic devices are used routinely in gastrointestinal and in thoracic surgery but not in vascular surgery for bypass grafting. This study reports the preliminary results of a novel mechanical connector for sutureless arterial anastomosis that was developed to facilitate the construction of the aortic anastomosis when doing laparoscopic aortic revascularization or when performing an arterial anastomosis in a small confined space through a mini-laparotomy. This experimental study found that this sutureless anastomotic device using a bare spiked stent was safe, quick and easy to use with comparable tensile strength between handsewn and automated anastomoses. Future potential clinical application for hybrid arterial procedures using this device will need more experimental work to confirm its durability...|$|R
40|$|The {{treatment}} of abdominal aortic aneurysms {{in combination with}} obliterating atherosclerosis of the lower extremities {{is a very difficult}} problem in the definition of surgical approach. Its caused by increased frequency of atherosclerosis as the basis of this disease, old age and the presence of comorbidities, especially coronary heart disease (CHD), which determines the capabilities of this treatment and its prognosis. The aim of this research was to analyze the results of diagnostics and {{treatment of}} the patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm in combination with obliterating atherosclerosis of the lower extremities. Materials and methods: The research was conducted during the past 20 years in the Department of Vascular Surgery in Zaporizhzhya Regional Clinical Hospital in the age group of 40 to 80 years. 92 patients had aneurysm of the abdominal aorta in combination with obliterating atherosclerosis of the lower extremities. In this study were analyzed the results of treatment of the patients who underwent surgery only in a planned manner. All of them had manifestations of the lower limbs ischemia and severe comorbidities. Herewith, 8 patients had occlusion of the iliac arteries on both sides and 15 patients had occlusion of the iliac arteries on one side. 87 patients had iliac artery stenosis of varying severity. 53 patients from the same group had occlusion of the superficial femoral artery with the deep femoral artery stenosis. Choice of the surgical method was determined by the data of aneurysm’s state in the dynamics received by instrumental methods, the presence of comorbidities, patient’s age, the state of vital functions and the risk of bleeding and restore of the lower limbs circulation. The basic way of surgical interventions for abdominal aortic aneurysm in combination with obliterating atherosclerosis of the lower extremities was a resection of the aneurysm with opening of the aneurysmal bag and prosthetics of the <b>aorta.</b> Aorto-aortic (linear) <b>prosthesis</b> was performed in a case of spreading the aneurysm to the bifurcation of the aorta and absence of severe stenosis or dilatation of the iliac arteries; aortoiliac bifurcation prosthesis - in patients with severe lesions of common iliac arteries, aneurysmal expansion or occlusive-stenotic process but in a case of adequate arteries; aortofemoral bifurcation prosthesis - in a case of total injury of common and external iliac arteries by aneurysmal or stenotic process. To stabilize the results of surgical treatment in postoperative period were appointed drugs that can improve blood circulation in the lower extremities. Use of stent-grafts has not found widespread clinical application, so native experience in restoration of a blood flow in stenotic or occluded arteries using stents - grafts is still too young {{to be able to do}} any definitive conclusions about all the possibilities of this method of treatment, but the low invasiveness and relative ease of replacement demonstrate its clear advantages, and high clinical efficacy will include intravascular technology to the tactics of the "first choice.
