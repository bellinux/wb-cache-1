2500|$|... {{a sort of}} streetwise {{brand of}} Spanglish {{that even the most}} {{monolingual}} reader can easily inhale: lots of flash words <b>and</b> razzle-dazzle <b>talk,</b> <b>lots</b> of body language on the sentences, lots of David Foster Wallace-esque footnotes and asides. And he conjures with seemingly effortless aplomb the two worlds his characters inhabit: the Dominican Republic, the ghost-haunted motherland that shapes their nightmares and their dreams; and America (a.k.a. New Jersey), the land of freedom and hope and not-so-shiny possibilities that they've fled to as part of the great Dominican diaspora.

Woolf, who suffered from spectrophobia, had her mood so improved by Sackville-West that she purchased a mirror during a trip to France with her lover, saying she felt she could look in a mirror for the first time in her life.|$|R
