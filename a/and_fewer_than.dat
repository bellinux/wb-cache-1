5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid envelops {{the brain}} and the spine, and lumbar {{puncture}} or spinal tap is the removal of {{a small amount of}} fluid using a needle inserted between the lumbar vertebrae.

This combination distinguishes Guillain–Barré syndrome from other conditions (such as lymphoma and poliomyelitis) in which both the protein and the cell count are elevated. Elevated CSF protein levels are found in approximately 50% of patients in the first 3 days after onset of weakness, which increases to 80% after the first week.|$|E

There are about 72 freshwater species in total, being predominantly found in the palearctic and neoptropical zones.

5|$|The {{ecological}} {{conservation of}} seamounts is {{hurt by the}} simple lack of information available. Seamounts are very poorly studied, with only 350 of the estimated 100,000 seamounts in the world having received sampling, <b>and</b> <b>fewer</b> <b>than</b> 100 in depth. Much of this lack of information {{can be attributed to}} a lack of technology, and to the daunting task of reaching these underwater structures; the technology to fully explore them has only been around the last few decades. Before consistent conservation efforts can begin, the seamounts of the world must first be mapped, a task that is still in progress.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{stoppages}} across the UK peaked at 4,583 in 1979, {{when more than}} 29million working days had been lost. In 1984, {{the year of the}} miners' strike, there were 1,221, resulting in the loss of more than 27million working days. Stoppages then fell steadily throughout the rest of Thatcher's premiership; in 1990 there were 630 <b>and</b> <b>fewer</b> <b>than</b> 2million working days lost, and they continued to fall thereafter. Thatcher's tenure also witnessed a sharp decline in trade union density, with the percentage of workers belonging to a trade union falling from 57.3% in 1979 to 49.5% in 1985. In 1979 up until Thatcher's final year in office, trade union membership also fell, from 13.5million in 1979 to fewer than 10million.|$|E

Several of these took an important role with the club after they retired as players. Harry Morris, who joined the club's board of directors in 1903, was instrumental in planning the St Andrew's stadium, {{which has been the}} club's home ground since 1906. In his role as Birmingham's chief scout in the 1960s, Don Dorman was responsible for recruiting youngsters including Trevor Francis– the first player transferred between British clubs for a £1million fee– and future internationals Bob Latchford and Kenny Burns. Bill Harvey, Arthur Turner and Steve Bruce went on to manage the club. Turner led the team to their highest league finish and to the FA Cup Final in 1956, while Birmingham gained promotion to the Premier League twice under Bruce's managership.|$|E
5|$|Sledd {{nominated}} all of {{the original}} faculty members, a majority of whom he had previously selected to be professors at the University of Florida at Lake City. The new University of the State of Florida operated in Lake City during the first academic year of its existence (1905–06), while the buildings of the new Gainesville campus were being erected. Sledd managed the move of the school's assets from Lake City to Gainesville during the late summer of 1906, and participated in the official dedication of the campus on September 27, 1906. When registration for classes was held in Gainesville on September 24, 1906, there were 102 students <b>and</b> <b>fewer</b> <b>than</b> a dozen faculty members.

5|$|The {{outbreak}} of World War II in 1939 {{led to a}} severe drop in trade. Part of the Manod (Cwt-y-Bugail) mine at Blaenau Ffestiniog was used to store art treasures from the National Gallery and the Tate Gallery. The number of men employed in the slate industry in North Wales dropped from 7,589 in 1939 to 3,520 {{by the end of}} the war. In 1945, total production was only 70,000tons a year, <b>and</b> <b>fewer</b> <b>than</b> 20 quarries were still open compared with 40 before the war. The Nantlle Valley had been particularly hard hit, with only 350 workers employed in the entire district, compared with 1,000 in 1937. Demand for slate was dropping as tiles were increasingly used for roofing, and imports from countries such as Portugal, France and Italy were increasing. There was some increased demand for slates to repair bombed buildings after the end of the war, but the use of slate for new buildings was banned, apart from the smallest sizes. This ban was lifted in 1949.|$|E

5|$|Several basic {{offensive}} tactics {{come into}} play with a runner on first base, including the fundamental choice of whether to attempt a steal of second base. The hit and run is sometimes employed with a skillful contact hitter: the runner takes off with the pitch drawing the shortstop or second baseman over to second base, creating {{a gap in the}} infield for the batter to poke the ball through. The sacrifice bunt calls for the batter to focus on making contact with the ball so that it rolls a short distance into the infield, allowing the runner to advance into scoring position even {{at the expense of the}} batter being thrown out at first—a batter who succeeds is credited with a sacrifice. (A batter, particularly one who is a fast runner, may also attempt to bunt for a hit.) A sacrifice bunt employed with a runner on third base, aimed at bringing that runner home, is known as a squeeze play. With a runner on third <b>and</b> <b>fewer</b> <b>than</b> two outs, a batter may instead concentrate on hitting a fly ball that, even if it is caught, will be deep enough to allow the runner to tag up and score—a successful batter, in this case, gets credit for a sacrifice fly. The manager will sometimes signal a batter who is ahead in the count (i.e., has more balls than strikes) to take, or not swing at, the next pitch.|$|E

In the late 20th century, the breed again gained {{the attention of the}} United States public, and in 1985 the US association was reactivated, renamed the Cleveland Bay Society of North America. The US American Livestock Breeds Conservancy considers their status to be critical, which means there is an estimated global population of less than 2,000, <b>and</b> <b>fewer</b> <b>than</b> 200annual registrations in the United States. The UK Rare Breeds Survival Trust also considers their status to be critical, with less than 300breeding females registered worldwide. The Equus Survival Trust also considers the breed population to be at critical levels, meaning there are between 100 and 300breeding females left in the world. Currently, there are about 135purebred horses in the US and Canada recorded with the North American registry. There are also small populations in Japan, New Zealand, and Australia. In 2006, an estimated 550Cleveland Bay horses existed worldwide, of which about 220 were mares; the 2005 foal crop produced fewer than 50horses.|$|E
