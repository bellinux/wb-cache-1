5|$|In 1935, the United States Navy Naval Research Laboratory began {{studies and}} tests on low {{visibility}} camouflage for ships. Some measures were deceptive, like <b>a</b> <b>false</b> painted bow wave {{to give the}} impression of high speed at all times.

Imagine a simple system with only one variable, a boolean called A.

50|$|As for the results, the C-HOG and R-HOG block {{descriptors}} perform comparably, {{with the}} C-HOG descriptors maintaining a slight {{advantage in the}} detection miss rate at fixed false positive rates across both data sets. On the MIT set, the C-HOG and R-HOG descriptors produced a detection miss rate of essentially zero at <b>a</b> 10&minus;4 <b>false</b> positive rate. On the INRIA set, the C-HOG and R-HOG descriptors produced a detection miss rate of roughly 0.1 at <b>a</b> 10&minus;4 <b>false</b> positive rate. The generalized Haar wavelets represent the next highest performing approach: they produced roughly a 0.01 miss rate at <b>a</b> 10&minus;4 <b>false</b> positive rate on the MIT set, and roughly a 0.3 miss rate on the INRIA set. The PCA-SIFT descriptors and shape context descriptors both performed fairly poorly on both data sets. Both methods produced a miss rate of 0.1 at <b>a</b> 10&minus;4 <b>false</b> positive rate on the MIT set and nearly a miss rate of 0.5 at <b>a</b> 10&minus;4 <b>false</b> positive rate on the INRIA set.|$|R

5|$|After {{the stellar}} {{parameters}} were established, the Kepler science team ran models and fits {{to ensure that}} Kepler-5's transit event was not <b>a</b> <b>false</b> positive, such as an eclipsing binary star. Once the planetary nature of Kepler-5b was established, the Kepler team searched for the planet's occultation behind its star, hoping to find the temperature on its day side. They found both, {{and were able to}} set the equilibrium temperature of the planet. The use of speckle imaging using adaptive optics at the WIYN Observatory in Arizona and the Palomar Observatory in California isolated the starlight of Kepler-5 from background stars.|$|E

5|$|Before year 2000 some survivalists wrongly {{believed}} this process {{would be set}} in motion by the predicted Y2K problem causing societal collapse. Since many left-wing and right-wing conspiracy theorists believe that the September 11 attacks were <b>a</b> <b>false</b> flag operation carried out by the United States intelligence community, as part of a strategy of tension to justify political repression at home and preemptive war abroad, they have become convinced that a more catastrophic terrorist incident will be responsible for triggering Executive Directive 51 in order to complete the transition to a police state.|$|E
5|$|During {{his first}} season under Barcelona's new manager, former captain Pep Guardiola, Messi played mainly on the right wing, like he had under Rijkaard, though this time as <b>a</b> <b>false</b> winger with the freedom to cut inside and roam the centre. During the Clásico on 2 May 2009, however, he played {{for the first time}} as <b>a</b> <b>false</b> nine, {{positioned}} as a centre-forward but dropping deep into midfield to link up with Xavi and Andrés Iniesta. He assisted with a chip his side's first goal and scored twice to end the match in an emphatic 6–2 victory, the team's greatest-ever score at Real Madrid's Santiago Bernabéu Stadium. Returning to the wing, he played his first final since breaking into the first team on 13 May, scoring once and assisting a second goal as Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao 4–1 to win the Copa del Rey. With 23 league goals from Messi that season, Barcelona became La Liga champions three days later and achieved its fifth double.|$|E
