The local magistrate had the villagers assemble {{in the town square}} where they would temporarily relinquish their sickles. Within minutes, a mass of blow flies gathered around one sickle and none other, attracted to the scent of traces of blood unseen by the naked eye. It became apparent to all that the owner of that sickle was the culprit, the latter pleading for mercy as he was detained by authorities.|$|E

It concurs with Kurth's theory that Hill may have faked his death, suggesting that he arranged for someone else to be killed in his place. The journalist Jerry Buck noted in an article preceding the film's debut on NBC that the face of the shooting victim had been battered and that there were anomalies in the autopsy report, notably that Hill had a different eye color from that recorded for the dead person. Buck also wrote that Hill was in financial difficulties with the Internal Revenue Service in 1972 and facing <b>a</b> <b>murder</b> <b>case</b> against him. Sightings of Hill had also been reported in Mexico and New York City.|$|E

25|$|O'Connor did, however, {{state that}} the Court accepts certain forms of {{categorical}} presumptions of confidentiality. But these categorical presumptions {{are a lot more}} narrowly defined than what the FBI had previously used. Justice O'Connor gave the scenario of a paid informant as an example of an accepted categorical presumption of confidentiality. She stated that a paid informant can expect that his/her cooperation with the FBI will be kept secret, and that this makes documents related to a paid informant subject to being withheld or redacted in accordance with Exemption 7(D). She also stated that, in murder cases like this one, informants may also expect to have their interactions with the FBI be confidential. Justice O'Connor said that the Court would accept the FBI's presumption of the confidentiality of any documents related to an informant for <b>a</b> <b>murder</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E

25|$|One {{contention}} by {{some tax}} protesters {{is that a}} taxpayer {{should be allowed to}} introduce, as evidence in court, copies of statutes, cases or other materials to persuade the jury about what the law is. Courts do not allow this procedure as, under the U.S. legal system, the general rule is that neither side in a civil or criminal case is allowed to try to prove to the jury what the law is. For example, in <b>a</b> <b>murder</b> <b>case</b> the defendant is not allowed to persuade the jury that there is no law against murder, or to try to interpret the law for the jury. Likewise, the prosecution is not allowed to do this. Instead, disagreements about what the law is are argued by both sides before the judge, who then makes a ruling. Prior to jury deliberations, the judge instructs the jury on the law. Examples of applications of this rule in tax controversies are United States v. Ambort, United States v. Bonneau, and United States v. Willie.|$|E

25|$|A {{task force}} {{was formed to}} proceed with what was now <b>a</b> <b>murder</b> <b>case</b> and several leads were investigated, such as an ex-boyfriend of Karyn's {{as well as her}} ex-husband Michael. An autopsy of Karyn's body showed that Karyn had been shot six times, once {{in the back of the}} head and an {{additional}} five times in the forehead, before being dismembered and the body parts placed in the plastic bags. Police found several strands of dog hair on the duct tape and remnants of cinders and tall grass. Swann was suspected of the crime as his alibi initially did not cover him for a forty-minute period. Investigators were also suspicious of several actions that Swann had performed during the initial search for Karyn and because he owned a handgun matching the type that had shot Karyn. Swann participated with police during a search warrant and was eventually cleared of suspicion after footage from an ATM surveillance video cleared him for the missing 40 minutes of his alibi. Alibis for other suspects such as Michael Jr and Karyn's ex-boyfriend also ruled them out as suspects.|$|E
25|$|From May-to-Oct 1938 <b>a</b> <b>murder</b> <b>case</b> {{consumed}} {{his time}} - that of Mathias Warren, father to Earl Warren who {{was soon to}} be was Attorney General, then governor, and in time, supreme court judge. On hearing of the murder then district attorney Warren, who had cultivated a relationship with police in various departments and reporters, came to Bakersfield along with many friends seeking to help {{and there was some}} tension how the investigation would proceed. Powers insisted and Warren let Powers be in charge. Ultimately no one was charged with the crime - Powers ended up viewing it as a breaking-and-entering that became murder from a transient as Mathias Warren had chosen to live on a messy property while his wealth was tied up in land holdings. Of course the matter was covered in many newspaper stories. However, as time went on the importance of the case, at least to Powers, {{had more to do with}} the increasing prominence of Earl Warren. Powers noted the transients of the period were the Okies, indeed The Grapes of Wrath was set in Bakersfield, and that the local establishment tried to keep them pushed out of the way.|$|E
