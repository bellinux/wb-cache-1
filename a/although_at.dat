After being released from his contract with Universal due to a disagreement over who would produce the next album, Konietzko said he called Metropolis Records and asked if they'd be interested in signing KMFDM. The label agreed, <b>although</b> <b>at</b> the time only Konietzko himself was certain to participate.|$|E

5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>at</b> {{least some}} of the poems {{attributed}} to Narihira in imperial anthologies are dubious, there is a large enough body of his work contained in the relatively reliable Kokinshū for scholars to discuss Narihira's poetic style.

5|$|In {{an effort}} to cut Grant's supply line, Confederates in Louisiana under Major General John G. Walker {{attacked}} Milliken's Bend up the Mississippi on June 7. This was mainly defended by recently enlisted United States Colored Troops. Despite having inferior weaponry, they fought bravely and finally repulsed the Confederates with help from gunboats, <b>although</b> <b>at</b> horrible cost; the defenders lost 652 to the Confederate 185. The loss at Milliken's Bend left the Confederates with no hope for relief but from the cautious Johnston.|$|E

5|$|Offenbach's {{first piece}} for the company's new home was Ba-ta-clan (December 1855), a well-received piece of mock-oriental frivolity, to a {{libretto}} by Halévy.

5|$|The fifth book {{looks more}} to the future; for example, Monteverdi employs the concertato style with basso continuo (a device that {{was to become a}} typical feature in the {{emergent}} Baroque era), and includes a sinfonia (instrumental interlude) in the final piece.

5|$|A {{short period}} of {{rudimentary}} training followed {{under the tutelage of}} members of the Australian Instructional Corps. This was completed by April 1940, and that month the battalion– under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Godfrey, a First World War veteran who had previously commanded the 23rd/21st Battalion– embarked for the Middle East on the transport ship Neuralia, departing from Port Melbourne and sailing via Fremantle, Colombo, Aden and the Suez Canal. At this time it was attached to the 17th Brigade, which was assigned to the 6th Division. Recruited from Victoria– <b>although</b> <b>at</b> various times the battalion's composition was boosted by recruits from other states– the 17th also consisted of the 2/5th, 2/7th and 2/8th Battalions.|$|E
5|$|A {{survey of}} 1000 {{secondary}} school pupils and university students in Tayside conducted in February 2010 found 20% {{of them had}} previously taken mephedrone. <b>Although</b> <b>at</b> {{the time it was}} available legally over the internet, only 10% of users reported purchasing it online, with most purchasing it from street dealers.

Around 50% of users reported at least one negative effect {{associated with the use of}} mephedrone, of which teeth grinding is the most common. Detailed interviews with users in Northern Ireland similarly found that few purchased mephedrone online, with most interviewees citing concerns that their address would be traced or that family members could intercept the package.|$|E

Lieutenant Ramsay, the senior surviving officer, told his rescuers that neither the helm nor the emergency rudder were manned when the ships collided so the destroyer's turn towards Hipper was probably accidental. German accounts only mention four torpedoes fired by Glowworm, but British accounts say all ten were fired. This was confirmed by photographic evidence taken after the collision showing all of her torpedo tubes empty.|$|E
