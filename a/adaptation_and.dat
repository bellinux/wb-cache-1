40|$|Background: <b>Adaptations</b> <b>and</b> assistive {{technology}} (AT) {{have an important}} role in enabling older people to remain in their own homes. Objective: To measure the feasibility <b>and</b> cost of <b>adaptations</b> <b>and</b> AT, and the scope for these to substitute and supplement formal care. Design: Detailed design studies to benchmark the adaptability of 82 properties against the needs of seven notional users. Setting: Social rented housing sector. Main outcome measures: Measures of the adaptability of properties, costs of care, <b>adaptations</b> <b>and</b> AT, and relationships between these costs. Results: The adaptability of properties varies according to many design factors and the needs of occupiers. The most adaptable properties were ground floor flats and bungalows; the least were houses, maisonettes and flats in converted houses. Purpose-built sheltered properties were generally more adaptable than corresponding mainstream properties but the opposite was the case for bungalows. <b>Adaptations</b> <b>and</b> AT can substitute for and supplement formal care, and in most cases the initial investment in <b>adaptations</b> <b>and</b> AT is recouped through subsequently lower care costs within the average life expectancy of a user. Conclusion: Appropriately selected <b>adaptations</b> <b>and</b> AT can make a significant contribution to the provision of living environments which facilitate independence. They can both substitute for traditional formal care services and supplement these services in a cost-effective way...|$|R

5|$|After {{the third}} volume, a new editor was {{assigned}} to the series. Kamiya noted the third volume contained a lot of plot progression, and was going to balance it out in the fourth volume with more lighthearted and carefree events.. Volumes four and five were written as a single volume; since volume four lacked a climatic ending, Kamiya had to restructure the story. This, along with communication problems with his new editor, and other problems in Kamiya's life caused a month delay in volume four's release. After completing volume five, Kamiya was asked to submit volume six's manuscript before 2014 for the anime <b>adaptation,</b> <b>and</b> to complete the volume before the anime's premiere.|$|E
5|$|Also {{during the}} 1970s, Bill Morris was {{studying}} giant lambeosaurine remains from Baja California. He named them ?L. laticaudus in 1981 (type specimen LACM 17715). Morris used {{a question mark}} in his work because no complete crest had been found for his species, and without it a definitive assignment could not be made. From what was known of the skull, he considered it to be most like Lambeosaurus. He interpreted this species as water-bound, due to features like its size, its tall and narrow tail (interpreted as a swimming <b>adaptation),</b> <b>and</b> weak hip articulations, {{as well as a}} healed broken thigh bone that he thought would have been too much of a handicap for a terrestrial animal to have survived long enough to heal. This species was later (2012) assigned to the new genus Magnapaulia.|$|E

5|$|As {{with all}} Amarylidaceae genera, Narcissus {{contains}} unique isoquinoline alkaloids. The first alkaloid {{to be identified}} was lycorine, from N. pseudonarcissus in 1877. These are considered a protective <b>adaptation,</b> <b>and</b> are utilised in the classification of species. Nearly 100 alkaloids {{have been identified in}} the genus, about a third of all known Amaryllidaceae alkaloids, although not all species have been tested. Of the nine alkaloid ring types identified in the family, Narcissus species most commonly demonstrate the presence of alkaloids from within the Lycorine (lycorine, galanthine, pluviine) and Homolycorine (homolycorine, lycorenine) groups. Hemanthamine, Tazettine, Narciclasine, Montanine and Galantamine alkaloids are also represented. The alkaloid profile of any plant varies with time, location, and developmental stage. Narcissus also contain fructans and low molecular weight glucomannan in the leaves and plant stems.|$|E
5|$|Author Roald Dahl {{disapproved of}} the 1971 film <b>adaptation</b> <b>and</b> {{declined}} the film rights {{to produce the}} sequel, Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator. Warner Bros. and Brillstein-Grey Entertainment entered discussions with the Dahl estate in 1991, hoping to purchase the rights to produce another film version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The purchase was finalized in 1998, with Dahl's widow, Felicity ("Liccy"), and daughter, Lucy, receiving total artistic control and final privilege on the choices of actors, directors and writers. The Dahl Estate's subsequent protection of the source material was the main reason that Charlie and the Chocolate Factory had languished in development hell since the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|In 1930 both Cronjager and Dix {{moved from}} Paramount Pictures to RKO Radio Pictures. The {{following}} year, 1931, {{he received his}} first Academy Award nomination, for Cimarron.

In addition, he used over two million feet of film during the production, 250,000 of them during the land rush scenes alone; he communicated with his cameramen through army surplus field telephones. The film was nominated for seven Oscars, winning three (Outstanding Production, Best Screenplay <b>Adaptation,</b> <b>and</b> Best Art Direction). Cronjager lost to Floyd Crosby's work on Tabu.|$|E

5|$|In 1987, Jerry Weintraub's {{independent}} film company Weintraub Entertainment Group (WEG) obtained the film rights from Paramount.

After he was confirmed as the film's writer and director in April 1988, Stone travelled to Argentina, where he visited Eva's birthplace and met with the newly elected President Carlos Menem, who agreed to provide 50,000 extras for the production as well as allowing freedom of speech.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas with}} {{wet and dry}} seasons, soil {{nutrients}} diminish and erosion increases during the wet season. Animals have <b>adaptation</b> <b>and</b> survival strategies for the wetter regime. The previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season, as the crops have yet to mature. Developing countries have noted that their populations show seasonal weight fluctuations due to food shortages seen before the first harvest, which occurs late in the wet season.

Excessive rain during short periods of time can cause flash floods.|$|E
5|$|Interest in {{producing}} an English-language version of Let the Right One In began in 2007 shortly {{before it was}} released to audiences. In 2008, Hammer Films acquired the rights for the English <b>adaptation</b> <b>and</b> initially offered Tomas Alfredson, {{the director of the}} Swedish film, the opportunity to direct, which he declined. Reeves was then signed to direct and write the screenplay. Reeves made several changes for the English version such as altering the setting from Stockholm to New Mexico and renaming the lead characters. The film's producers stated that their intent was to keep the plot similar to the original, yet make it more accessible to a wider audience. Principal photography began in early November 2009, and concluded in January 2010. The film's budget was estimated to be $20 million.|$|E
