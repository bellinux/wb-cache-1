5|$|Agriculture is the {{economic}} foundation of most countries, and {{for developing countries}} <b>a</b> <b>likely</b> source of economic growth. Growth in agriculture can benefit the rural poor, though it does not always do so.

Crop diversity can protect againstcrop failure, and can also offer higher returns.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the relationship between related party transactions (RPT) and earnings management. This study argues there is a different influence between RPT <b>a</b> priori <b>likely</b> to result in expropriation and RPT <b>a</b> priori not <b>likely</b> to result in expropriation. RPT <b>a</b> priori <b>likely</b> to result in expropriation creates an incentive to management or controlling shareholder to overstate income to cover or mask their expropriation. This study uses non-absolute discretionary accruals based on Kazsnik model to proxy earnings management. Corporate governance mechanism should reduce the incentive to overstate income in a company that involves in RPT <b>a</b> priori <b>likely</b> to result in expropriation. The results of this study show that the earnings management (income increasing) is affected by the existence of RPT <b>a</b> priori <b>likely</b> to result in expropriation and corporate governance mechanism, but it is not affected by the size/value of the transactions. As expected, companies involving in RPT <b>a</b> priori <b>likely</b> to result in expropriation with weak corporate governance mechanism, tend to manage earnings that increase income. We find that strong corporate governance mechanism decreases the discretionary accruals in companies which have RPT <b>a</b> priori <b>likely</b> to result in expropriation...|$|R

5|$|In a study {{published}} in 2007, the National Institutes of Health deemed hexavalent chromium VI (chromium-6) to be <b>a</b> <b>likely</b> carcinogen in lab animals when consumed in large quantities in drinking water. Prior to the NIH study, a World Health Organization study found that chromium-6 was <b>a</b> <b>likely</b> cause of lung cancer when inhaled by humans. In 2010, test results released from a California non-profit group known as the Environmental Working Group showed that Norman's tap water has a chromium-6 concentration level of 12.90 parts per billion (ppb), which was the highest level detected among 35 U.S. cities sampled in the study. The group is studying chromium-6 levels in water supplies in an attempt to prove a causal link between the element's ingestion and cancer in humans, and as a result improve the country's water standards.|$|E
