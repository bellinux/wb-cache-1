500|$|Aeroflot, as {{the single}} state owned and governed airline, {{operated}} without any competitors and expanded according to the Soviet central government and central planning. By the beginning of World War II, Aeroflot, and {{the entirety of the}} Soviet civil aviation industry, was primarily a domestic freight carrier. In fact, in 1939, they surpassed the U.S. in volume of <b>airfreight.</b> Despite Stalin's strong xenophobia, Aeroflot commenced its first international route in 1936, operating between Moscow and Prague. After World War II, the Soviet government wanted to continue expansion by starting and increasing services from Moscow to the capitals of other Soviet republics. The ever-growing Soviet air transportation network began to shrink the railroad's importance in Soviet nations. As years passed, the Soviet regime recognized the aviation industry's increasing value, and officials in transportation planning attempted to establish regular air service to nearly every city in the union. By 1968, after Soviet engineers helped pioneer the introduction of jets and the jet age, Aeroflot and its subsidiaries served roughly 3,500 cities. At that time, [...] "the thirty largest Soviet cities were connected with all cities with a population of 500,000 or more" [...] (including nearly 80 percent of those with populations from 100,000 to 499,999, and 60 percent of the cities with 50,000 to 99,999 people). By joining these cities, infrastructure and industry benefitted heavily. The jet age and the introduction of new, faster and more reliable ways of air travel greatly changed Soviet aviation. Jets not only further shortened travel times; they allowed nonstop service between cities that had been otherwise out of reach for nonstop flights. Before the jet age, the longest nonstop service from Moscow was Yekaterinburg (Sverdlovsk) (roughly 1,100 miles); [...] sometime after the introduction of jets, mail could be delivered from Moscow to Vladivostok (nearly 4,000 miles east), the same day. The Soviet Union put the first jet in the world into service in 1956 on a Moscow to Irkutsk route (of about 2,600 miles) using a Soviet built Tupolev Tu-104. The Soviet government established a [...] "hubbing" [...] system unlike the West; in the Soviet Union, most cities had a direct link with Moscow. In the United States, most small cities were (and still are today) connected to larger cities and their airports; airlines then use these larger airports—or [...] "hubs"—to connect passengers to their flight and onto their destination. Because the Soviet Union essentially revolved around Moscow, this networking technique proved effective.|$|E
