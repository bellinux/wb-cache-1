3000|$|Future {{rangeland}} management in Libya must consider {{issues related to}} stock breeding and production to meet planned targets, with self-sufficiency in red meat production. When this is undertaken without {{taking into account the}} sustainable use of the ecosystem, there is a consequent deterioration of rangeland (vegetation and soil). The majority of Libyan rangeland under the 100 -mm isohyet is too degraded in terms of both soil fertility and vegetation for recovery within the short term either by natural improvement or even with human assistance. Cultivation practices within rangeland, where the rangeland has been converted to cultivation of field crops (El-Chaouch and Ben Mansoura, 1991; Jansen, 1988; El-Barasi and Saaed, 2013; EL-Barasi et al. 2013; [...] <b>Aburas,</b> 2014) has increased, resulting in damage to the natural vegetation through the widespread availability of tractors and disk ploughs for increasing grain production. Such practices have exerted serious impacts on the soil resources during ground preparation, making the rangeland more vulnerable to subsequent soil erosion.|$|R
30|$|Although {{there are}} {{a wide range of}} {{fieldwork}} techniques used for monitoring rangeland degradation, the costs of such methods are significantly higher than remote-sensing methods in comparison with the accuracy and reliability achievable, both in time and resources required. In addition, administration approaches in rangelands seek to keep the cost of monitoring low, and high fieldwork costs do not encourage sufficient samples to be taken to cover the whole of the area monitored. There is an inherent difficulty in all rangeland studies in collecting data, given the large geographical areas involved. This is especially true in Libya, where there is a particularly high cost of inventory. Moreover, {{there is a lack of}} the regularly updated information needed for monitoring in this area. In addition, the periods of time between the studies are not integrated with each other and are not repeatable, making it difficult for rangeland managers to detect rangeland degradation in a consistent manner. This is because most studies, which measure rangeland condition, are heavily reliant on fieldwork techniques (EL-Chaouch and Ben-Mansoura 1991; Alzznni et al. 1999; Omar Al-Mukhtar University 2005; El-Barasi and Saaed 2013; El-Barasi et al. 2013; <b>Aburas</b> 2014).|$|R

30|$|Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are {{well-known}} bacterial-originated polymers {{and serve}} as storage polyesters. In abnormal growth conditions, bacterial cells are committed to PHA [3 -hydroxybutyrate (PHB) and 3 -hydroxyvalerate (PHBV)] production. The 3 -hydroxybutyrate (PHB) used in various medical devices was found to accumulate in several bacteria, e.g., Azotobacter vinelandii and Alcaligenes eutrophus. The use of polyhydroxybutyrate in pharmaceutical practices is due to their bio-acceptance in patients (Bonartsev et al. 2007; Leja and Lewandowicz 2010 a, b). Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a polyester and extremely crystalline (> 50 %) in nature. The melting point of polyhydroxybutyrate is high in contrast to polyesters (Averous and Pollet 2012). Polyhydroxybutyrate serves as an energy storage source for microorganisms. Polyhydroxybutyrate and its copolymer (3 -hydroxyvalerate, etc.) are utilized {{in the production of}} degradable plastics (Ohura et al. 1999; Shimao 2001; Premraj and Doble 2005). Kadouri et al. (2002) reported three genes in Azospirillum brasilense strain Sp 7 that are involved in PHB synthesis, i.e., phbA, phbB and phbC genes for β-ketothiolase, acetoacetyl coenzyme A reductase and PHB synthase, respectively. Biodegradation of PHA is accomplished by microbiological mineralization and generates CO 2 and H 2 O (Bonartsev et al. 2007; Leja and Lewandowicz 2010 a, b). Bacterial-originated PHA depolymerases are known, which may help in the breakdown of polymer (polyhydroxyalkanoate). PHA depolymerases are multi-subunit enzymes, and each subunit has a specific property including a signal sequence, substrate-binding domain, catalytic domain and interconnecting domain (fibronectin type III or threonine similar sequence). Instead, the interconnecting domain of PHB depolymerase contains a cadherin-like sequence found in Pseudomonas stutzeri. PHA depolymerases and PHB depolymerases also differ in substrate-binding domains; PHA depolymerases have one domain, while PHB depolymerases have two domains (for a giant substrate). Polymers that contain cyclic or chain (R) oligomers are sensitive to enzymatic (PHB depolymerases) degradation. Alcaligenes faecalis T 1 utilizes the oligomer of 3 -hydroxybutanoate, and their depolymerase activity was also studied (Ohura et al. 1999; Shimao 2001; Premraj and Doble 2005). Degradation of PHB was also done by Ilyobacter delafieldii in the absence of oxygen (Schink et al. 1992; Jirage et al. 2011). During the cell lysis process, PHB granules are released outside and hydrolyzed by extracellular PHB depolymerase. PHB depolymerases are enzymes that initiate the intracellular degradation of PHBs. In addition to other genes (phaY, phaX, phaW), phaZ is known as the first structural gene for PHB degradation and releases the D- 3 -hydroxybutyrate monomer, which can be further oxidized by 3 -hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and the final product assimilated by the TCA cycle (Sharma and Dhingra 2016). Korotkova and Lidstrom (2001) reported the depA and depB genes, which encode PHB depolymerases for PHB degradation. Volova et al. (2010) reported an enhanced biodegradation rate of polymer films under the marine environment (seawater) instead of compact pellets, and Gracilibacillus sp., Enterobacter sp. and Bacillus sp. were identified. Similarly, Mabrouk and Sabryb (2001) found that the marine bacterium Streptomyces sp. SNG 9 is involved in PHB utilization. Weng et al. (2011) investigated the biodegradability of PHAs (PHB, PHBV) under controlled conditions (composting) and found that the degradation rate decreases with decreasing percentages of HV (40, 20 and 3 %). Oda et al. (1995) reported a Paecilomyces lilacinus fungal isolate and observed the degradation of PHB by secreting PHB depolymerases and glucose/lactose. <b>Aburas</b> (2016) isolated 20 fungal isolates to examine their PHB degradation potential; out of 20 isolates 11 (belonging to Aspergillus, Penicillium, Fusarium, Trichoderma and Alterneria genera) showed the PHB hydrolysis, with Aspergillus oryzae having an optimal PHB degradation potential at 30  °C and pH 6.5 in 1 % PHB containing minimal medium. Foster and Tighe (2005) introduced a new hydrolytic system for PHB degradation that served as an accelerated model (70  °C and pH 10.6) and modified the degradation characteristics.|$|R
