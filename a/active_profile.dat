30|$|In {{traditional}} profile polishing, the profiling {{reference is}} a polishing tool or abrasive particles, which move along {{the surface to}} be machined and remove materials in a uniform manner, achieving a processed surface. As a result, traditional profiling and polishing can only lower the surface roughness instead of improving {{the accuracy of the}} shape. In <b>active</b> <b>profiling</b> and polishing, abrasive particles generate relative movement according to the design basis, which marks the profiling for the design basis.

Micro-Partitioning {{supports}} 10 times as many LPARs as processors with fractional allocations. It was introduced with the POWER5 processor. All IBM POWER5 and POWER6 systems may be partitioned. Note that a full system partition may be defined where all resources are consumed by a single partition. System P servers with PowerVM enabled allow LPARs with shared CPUs to delegate their unused cycles into the shared pool. Dedicated processors are not available for sharing. Unused cycles become available for other partitions and are governed by the parameters specified when the LPAR is defined. Changes to a running partition can be made dynamically up to the maximum value set, {{and down to the}} minimum value set in the <b>active</b> <b>profile.</b> The changing of resource allocations without restart of the logical partition is called dynamic logical partitioning.

In this work, {{we focus on}} the parallelization of utility programs, a class of commonly used applications including compilers, transcoding utilities, file compressions, and databases. They take a series of requests as inputs and serve them one by one. Their high input dependence poses a challenge to parallelization. We use <b>active</b> <b>profiling</b> to find behavior phase boundaries and then automatically detect run-time dependences through profiling. Using a unified framework, we manually parallelize programs at phase boundaries. We show that for two programs, the technique enables parallelization at large granularity, which may span many loops and subroutines. The parallelized programs show significant speedup on multi-processor machines. ...|$|R

We present an <b>active</b> <b>profiling</b> technique in which controlled inputs to utility programs are used to expose execution phases, which are then marked, automatically, through binary instrumentation, enabling us to exploit phase transitions in production runs with arbitrary inputs. Experiments with five programs from the SPEC benchmark suites show that phase behavior is surprisingly predictable in many (though not all) cases. This predictability can in turn be used for optimized memory management leading to significant performance improvement. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Plunge shaving is {{the most}} {{advanced}} gear finishing technique which only needs radial infeed. Its advantages include increased productivity, accuracy, long tool life, and a simple machine structure. For the plunge shaving method, the gear tooth modification only depends on the surface geometry of the plunge shaving cutter. The analytical description of the gear with tooth modifications is firstly constructed by B-spline surface fitting. Then, the grinding wheel profile is parameterized and optimized for minimizing the surface deviations of theoretical and ground (from re-sharpening machine) tooth surfaces of the plunge shaving cutter, in which the topographic error has been reduced. The cutting trace of plunge shaving cutter has also been analyzed so that the shaving efficiency can be improved. Index Terms—Gear plunge shaving, Cone grinding wheel, Topographic error, Shaving cutter serration. et al. [9] proposed a method for shaving gears with double crowning by CNC shaving machine. For shaving methods other than plunge shaving, the gear tooth modification is accomplished by tooth modifications of the shaving cutter and the coordinated motions between cutter and gear. For the plunge shaving method, however, it only depends on the surface geometry of the plunge shaving cutter. Focusing on the surface geometry of shaving cutter, what’s really significant is precision of the region between SAP. (start of <b>active</b> <b>profile)</b> and EAP. (end of <b>active</b> <b>profile)</b> as shown in Fig. 1. In gear shaving, SAP. of cutter tooth shaves the gear tooth tip while EAP. shaves the gear tooth root.

30|$|Although the {{relational}} model in Eq. (13) is established {{based on the}} surface helical curve of the rotational parts, when the rotational parts with spiral grooves conduct rotational motion and rectilinear motion at a certain speed, and when the abrasive balls produce a transverse feed movement through extrusion under the function of gravity and then enter the spiral groove at a relatively low speed, it can be considered that a variation of N, the rotational speed of the abrasive balls, is negligible. The lead angle of helical motion is only related to the speed ratio of rotational and linear motion.
