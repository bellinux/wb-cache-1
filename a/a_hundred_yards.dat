5|$|In sport, an iron puddler, Robert Chambers of the company's Walker works, won the {{sculling}} {{championship at}} the 1857 Thames Regatta. The heavy work stirring the iron {{was said to}} have strengthened his arms and shoulders. Chambers also won the return match, held on the Tyne on 19 April 1859, even after a collision with a moored boat left him <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> behind.|$|E
5|$|The Storm Creek {{fire started}} on June 14 well {{north of the}} park in the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness, and for almost two months seemed to pose little threat to Yellowstone. Then, on August 20, the fire moved rapidly to the south also {{threatening}} the town of Cooke City, this time from the north. An effort to bulldoze a wide fire break and set backfires to try to starve the fires of combustibles almost led to disaster when an unexpected change in wind direction brought the fires to within <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> of parts of the town, forcing evacuations on September 6.|$|E
5|$|He {{believed}} {{that he and his}} men had secured Dai Do and wasn't expecting a sudden massive counterattack by the NVA. Company G took cover in the village cemetery and the fight raged through the night. The next morning, the bodies of more than three hundred enemy soldiers lay near their positions. Vargas's battalion commander arrived on the scene and ordered a renewed assault on the village. He carried to safety a Marine whose arm had been severed, and when the soldier pleaded for his arm, Vargas went back and found it. When the battalion commander, fighting like any other rifleman, was shot in the back three times, Vargas dragged him <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> to an evacuation point, firing at the enemy as he went with an AK-47 he had picked up on the battlefield. By {{the end of the third}} day of battle, the North Vietnamese retreated and Vargas finally allowed himself to be treated for a bullet wound in his side and shrapnel from mortar blasts.|$|E

5|$|Not one of {{the marchers}} even raised an arm {{to fend off the}} blows. They went down like ten-pins. From where I stood I heard the sickening whacks of the clubs on {{unprotected}} skulls. The waiting crowd of watchers groaned and sucked in their breaths in sympathetic pain at every blow. Those struck down fell sprawling, unconscious or writhing in pain with fractured skulls or broken shoulders. In two or three minutes the ground was quilted with bodies. Great patches of blood widened on their white clothes. The survivors without breaking ranks silently and doggedly marched on until struck down....Finally the police became enraged by the non-resistance....They commenced savagely kicking the seated men in the abdomen and testicles. The injured men writhed and squealed in agony, which seemed to inflame the fury of the police....The police then began dragging the sitting men by the arms or feet, sometimes for <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards,</b> and throwing them into ditches.|$|E
5|$|The ships {{headed for}} Batavia in the Dutch East Indies. Fearing the Japanese Navy, {{they sought to}} travel via the Lingga Islands hoping that the island group it sat in {{could be used as}} a hiding place. As they {{approached}} on 14 February, Judy indicated the approach of Japanese aircraft and the anti-aircraft gunners took up their positions in readiness. The Grasshopper was hit with a single bomb before the planes departed. Judy was below decks when the planes returned. The Dragonfly was hit by three bombs and sank quickly. The Grasshopper was hit by a further two bombs, and the order was given to abandon ship as a fire spread close to an ammunition compartment. Boats were lowered and the crew and evacuees were ferried just over <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> to shore whilst the Japanese planes strafed the vessels. It was only when they were ashore that they realised Judy was not with them.|$|E
5|$|In the lower, broader {{part of the}} estuary near Avonmouth, {{the tidal}} surge {{advances}} as a slight roll in the deepwater channels and the water rapidly spreads across the sands and mudbanks. Past Sharpness, the bore begins to form and when it encounters the large left-handed bend at Hock Cliff, it crashes headlong into the rocks. Reforming, it runs up-river close to the Overton shore before crossing the estuary towards Box Cliff. As it rounds the Horseshoe Bend it keeps to the outside but it afterwards moves across to {{the eastern side of}} the river. Above Langney Sands, the river abruptly narrows to <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards,</b> the sands diminish and the channel occupies the whole of the river. Now the bore is recognisably the spectacular phenomenon that people expect rather than a swelling flood of water. From Minsterworth to Gloucester, the width of the river varies little and the bore continues unhindered, climbing the banks on the outer side of bends and breaking over shallow places. At Lower Parting, close to Gloucester, it splits in two to pass either side of Alney Island. Both branches encounter and overcome weirs and rejoin at Upper Parting, and the much diminished bore continues upstream. In particularly high tides the water may overtop the weir at Tewkesbury, and even the foot of the weir at Worcester may experience a rise in water level of a foot or so.|$|E

25|$|Working with {{barbed wire}} was a nasty job under any circumstances, {{but when you}} were {{handling}} it {{in the dark and}} within <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> of rifles and machine guns that would shoot at the least sound, you were doing one of the most nerve-wracking bits of work that could possibly be imagined...the slightest move might mean death for half your party.|$|E
25|$|A second tarn to {{the east}} of Dow Crag stands in a small hollow below Brown Pike. This is Blind Tarn, so named because it has no visible inlet or outlet. About <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> across and twenty feet deep, the tarn has a respectable {{population}} of trout. Whilst other theories are possible, it must be assumed they have been introduced for sport.|$|E
6000|$|... "A nasty {{place for}} a fire," [...] the {{engineer}} said as the engine, following another <b>an</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> or more in advance, rolled on toward a block of apartment houses, from the centre {{of which could be}} seen dense clouds of black smoke ascending.|$|R

25|$|Pitman taught Latin, English, history, and science; Elizabeth taught art, Helen piano, and Leila {{was writing}} teacher and school nurse. Mary Choate's {{physician}} brother, Dr. Huntington Atwater, taught crafts and was school doctor. There was no formal {{relationship with the}} Choates' other foundation, Rosemary Hall, <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> to the east on Christian Street, but there were coeducational audiences for plays and recitals and Mary Choate hosted dances at the Homestead.|$|E
25|$|The {{church is}} T-shaped with {{irregular}} dimensions and bonds on the brick walls. The bricks themselves were supposedly dug and kilned <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> {{to the northeast}} of the church. There is a marker with a brass plaque indicating this in the churchyard. The chancel and west walls of the east-west wing that form {{the main body of}} the church and comprise its earliest sections differ significantly in their dimensions. The other structures of the church, the north wing and the porch, show a similar variability.|$|E
25|$|The main summit bears a cairn {{perched on}} the brink of the Mosedale Crags. To the west is a gentle slope, carpeted with short turf. The {{southern}} top also bears a large cairn and, <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> beyond, is The Chair. This is an armchair shaped windshelter built onto a rock outcrop, a few yards off the path. It provides a fine vantage point for views southward, and is so prominent on the climb from Dore Head that it once gave its name to the fell. Scoat Fell and Pillar obstruct the view northward. The Scafells are well seen, as are the Wasdale Screes.|$|E
60|$|Once on {{the plain}} outside the stockaded portion of the works, Sergeant Corney led the way by going in a southerly {{direction}} for a distance of <b>an</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> or more, and then striking sharply off toward the west, where was to be found the nearest cover.|$|R

25|$|A {{mile or so}} {{past the}} tunnel, 208 {{abruptly}} reaches NY207 outside the hamlet of Rock Tavern. 208 overlaps 207 for <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> as the two roads pass small Brown's Pond and a weir, then 208 once again turns left to go north alongside the pond, into some more open countryside. It passes the west boundary of Stewart State Forest, goes over a little-used rail spur, once part of the Wallkill Valley Railroad (WVRR) and then enters Maybrook, which it serves as the main street. A feature of this town is the large Yellow Freight terminal in its north end, continuing a tradition of importance in transportation {{that began with the}} village's origins as a major regional rail hub.|$|E
25|$|Butler also {{planned to}} bring the USS Louisiana, which had been packed with 200 tons of powder and {{disguised}} as a blockade runner, down to Fort Fisher, run it aground about <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> from the fort's seawall, and blow it up, hoping the explosion would demolish the fort as well. Although many in the Union high command (including Grant and Gideon Wells) doubted the plan would work, it was approved by Lincoln. The final Union plan was for the ships to gather at Hampton Roads, where the army troops would board the transports. Because the monitors used in the attack had to be towed to Fort Fisher, the navy would leave with a twelve-hour head start over the transports. The warships would refuel at Beaufort, then meet the transports at Fort Fisher, when the Louisiana would be detonated and the troops landed under the fire of the warships.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{its central}} {{position}} within the Lake District and great prominence the summit {{has some of the}} best panoramic views of any peak in the area. All of the main fell groups are laid out, serried ranks of hills filling the skyline, although surprisingly Wast Water and Windermere are the only lakes visible. <b>A</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> to the south west of the summit, overlooking the Napes, is the Westmorland Cairn. This cairn was erected in 1876 by two brothers named Westmorland to mark what they considered to be the finest view in the Lake District. From here ground falls away into the profound abyss of upper Wasdale. Further cairns mark the top of Gable Crag. It is testament to the high regard that many walkers have for Great Gable that the summit has become a popular site for the scattering of ashes following cremation.|$|E

It then ran under the Brampton Branch, under a footbridge, under the Midland line, under another footbridge, under the LD&ECR line, over its junction with Hyde's Sidings and finally into open country. This plethora of activity was crammed into <b>a</b> few <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> at Horns Bridge.|$|R
25|$|The Elgin Military Museum {{may well}} be the only such museum on the {{continent}} that has space dedicated to an elephant. However, Jumbo, the largest elephant ever held in captivity, met his demise here in St. Thomas, Ontario on September 15, 1885. In 1985, in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of his death, a life-size monument of this gentle animal was installed on the brow of the hill <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> up the street from the museum. Finding a home for the monument had proved to be a significant problem until several members of the museum board (who just happened to serve on the Jumbo Monument Committee) convinced other members of the museum board to permit the statue of Jumbo to be placed in the parking lot the museum had just built on Talbot Street. However, that is just the beginning of the 'menagerie' which also includes the kangaroo and dolphins.|$|E
500|$|The Knox and Kane Railroad (KKRR) {{operated}} sightseeing trips from Kane {{through the}} Allegheny National Forest {{and over the}} Kinzua Bridge from 1987 until the bridge was closed in 2002. In 1988 it operated the longest steam train excursion in the United States, a [...] round trip to the bridge {{from the village of}} Marienville in Forest County, with a stop in Kane. The New York Times described being on the bridge as [...] "more akin to ballooning than railroading" [...] and noted [...] "You stare straight out with nothing between you and an immense sea of verdure <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> [...] below." [...] The railroad still operated excursions through the forest and stopped at the bridge's western approach until October 2004.|$|E
500|$|Thomas {{visited the}} home of {{historian}} A. J. P. Taylor in Disley. Although Taylor disliked him intensely, he stayed for a month, drinking [...] "on a monumental scale", up to 15 or 20 pints of beer a day. In late 1946 Thomas turned up at the Taylors' again, this time homeless and with Caitlin. Margaret Taylor let them take up residence in the garden summerhouse. In May 1949 Thomas and {{his family moved to}} his final home, the Boat House at Laugharne, purchased for him at a cost of £2,500 in April 1949 by Margaret Taylor. Thomas acquired a garage <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> from the house on a cliff ledge which he turned into his writing shed, and where he wrote several of his most acclaimed poems. Just before moving into there, Thomas rented [...] "Pelican House" [...] opposite his regular drinking den, Brown's Hotel, for his parents who lived there from 1949 until 1953. It was there that his father died and the funeral was held.|$|E
