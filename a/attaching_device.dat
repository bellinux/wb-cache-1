25|$|After {{launching}} {{aboard the}} Shuttle Discovery, Williams arranged to donate her pony tail to Locks of Love. Fellow astronaut Joan Higginbotham cut her hair aboard the International Space Station and the ponytail was {{brought back to}} Earth by the STS-116 crew. Williams performed her first extra-vehicular activity on the eighth day of the STS-116 mission. On January 31, February 4, and February 9, 2007, she completed three spacewalks from the ISS with Michael López-Alegría. During one of these walks, a camera became untethered, probably because the <b>attaching</b> <b>device</b> failed, and floated off to space before Williams could react.|$|E

40|$|EP 1859730 A 1 UPAB: 20080115 NOVELTY - The sensor (100) has an <b>attaching</b> <b>device</b> (110) {{to attach}} the sensor around a {{wristband}} of a living organism. A light source (120) connected to the device radiates a light into a body part of the organism. A photoreceiver (124) provides a light intensity signal (126) based on an intensity of the light, where the signal is dependent on a vital parameter. An acceleration sensor (130) connected to the device provides an acceleration signal (136). The sensor is designed to transmit the signals to a processing device (140) that processes the signals to provide information (142) about the parameter. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following: (1) a method for providing information about a vital parameter of a living organism (2) a computer program for performing an information providing method. USE - Used in a medical field for providing information about a vital parameter e. g. pulse frequency and blood component proportions, of a living organism e. g. human being. ADVANTAGE - The design of the sensor facilitates reliable determination of {{the information about the}} vital parameter. The <b>attaching</b> <b>device</b> is provided for attaching the sensor around the wristband in the living organism, thus increasing mobility of a patient and/or animal during measurements...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAssessing the {{mechanical}} {{properties of materials}} at intermediate strain rates (1 - 200 /s) {{is one of the}} major concerns in impact engineering. Servo-hydraulic machines are usually used at this range of strain rates. However, detrimental oscillations appear on the measured load for strain rates above 10 /s. In this paper, we present a modified servo-hydraulic machine. The load is measured by a Hopkinson bar-like technique. Besides, the BCGO wave separation method is used to overcome the limited test duration problem. Moreover, the strain in the sample is measured using Digital Speckle Photographs (DSP) which is captured via high-speed video camera. This modified machine is an equivalent and alternative solution to the slow bar technique. It is applied to aluminium 2017 T 4 alloy at strain rates of approximately 100 /s. Compared to the piezoelectric force sensor, the Hopkinson bar-like method gives less-oscillating signals. The sample <b>attaching</b> <b>device</b> is also taken into account. It is considered as a rigid mass. This simple assumption is valid up to strain rates of some hundreds per second...|$|E
