5|$|The flag of Lithuania {{consists}} of a horizontal tricolor of yellow, green and red. It was re-adopted on March 20, 1989, almost <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> re-establishment of Lithuania's independence and almost three years before {{the collapse of the}} Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> {{payphone}} {{contract was}} set to expire, there was a competition that sought ideas to further repurpose the network of payphones. The competition, held by the administration of Michael Bloomberg, expanded {{the idea of the}} pilot project. There were 125 responses that suggested a Wi-Fi network, but none of these responses elaborated on how that would be accomplished.|$|E
5|$|The Courbet-class {{ships were}} {{completed}} less than <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> start of World War I {{and nothing is}} known of their activities during this time except that France, escorted by Jean Bart, carried the President of the French Republic, Raymond Poincaré, on a state visit to Saint Petersburg, Russia in July 1914. They were returning from Russia when World War I began, but made it to France without encountering German ships.|$|E

5|$|The Intifada {{began as}} an {{uprising}} of Palestinian youth against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. On June 7, 1986, about <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Intifada started, al-Wazir was deported from Amman to Baghdad, eventually moving to Tunisia days after King Hussein declared that efforts in establishing a joint strategy for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict between Jordan and the PLO were over.|$|E
5|$|Work {{began on}} the pair of Pisa-class ships in August 1904, nearly <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> keel of Amalfi, named after the eponymous city, was laid down on 24 July 1905 at the Cantieri navali Odero {{shipyard}} in Sestri Ponente. It was nearly three years before Amalfi was launched on 5 May 1908. The ship was completed on 1 September 1909, just over four years after her keel was laid.|$|E
5|$|A new women's {{suffrage}} {{bill was}} introduced, which the Senate of Argentina sanctioned on 21 August 1946. It {{was necessary to}} wait more than <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> House of Representatives sanctioned it on 9 September 1947. Law 13,010 established the equality of political rights {{between men and women}} and universal suffrage in Argentina. Finally, Law 13,010 was approved unanimously. In a public celebration and ceremony, however, Juan Perón signed the law granting women the right to vote, and then he handed the bill to Eva, symbolically making it hers.|$|E

5|$|Activated in 1949, the {{regiment}} trained {{for more than}} <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> outbreak {{of the war on}} June 25, 1950. On that day, half of {{the regiment}} led North Korean forces against South Korean troops by land and sea, pushing them back after several days of fighting. Over the next six weeks the regiment advanced slowly down the Korean Peninsula, acting as a forward unit of the North Korean army. Suffering from a lack of supplies and mounting casualties, the regiment was committed to the Battle of Pusan Perimeter as part of a push to force United Nations (UN) troops out of Korea.|$|E
5|$|Cars {{would be}} the final film worked on by Joe Ranft {{who died in a}} car {{accident}} <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> film's release, aged 45. The film was the second to be dedicated to his memory, after Corpse Bride (that showed the roles he had done in the other films directed by John Lasseter during the credits). This is also the last (non-documentary) movie for Paul Newman before his retirement in 2007 and his death in 2008. It {{turned out to be the}} highest-grossing film of his career.|$|E
5|$|HMS Curacoa was a C-class light cruiser {{built for}} the Royal Navy during the First World War. She {{was one of the}} five ships of the Ceres sub-class and spent much of her career as a flagship. The ship was {{assigned}} to the Harwich Force during the war, but saw little action as she was completed less than <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> war ended. Briefly assigned to the Atlantic Fleet in early 1919, Curacoa was deployed to the Baltic in May to support anti-Bolshevik forces during the British campaign in the Baltic during the Russian Civil War. Shortly thereafter the ship struck a naval mine and had to return home for repairs.|$|E

5|$|In 1599, Michael won the Battle of Șelimbăr {{and soon}} entered Alba Iulia, {{becoming}} the imperial governor (i.e. de facto ruler) of Transylvania. A few months later, Michael's troops invaded Moldavia and reached its capital, Iaşi. The Moldavian leader Ieremia Movilă fled to Poland and Michael was declared Prince of Moldavia. Michael kept {{the control of}} all three provinces for less than <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> nobles of Transylvania and certain boyars in Moldavia and Wallachia rose against him {{in a series of}} revolts. Thereafter, Michael allied with the Imperial General Giorgio Basta and defeated an uprising of the Hungarian nobility at Gurăslău in Transylvania. Immediately after this victory, Rudolf ordered the assassination of Michael, an action carried out on 9 August 1601 by Basta's men.|$|E
5|$|Into Temptation was {{produced}} by Coyle's production company, Ten Ten Films, and the company Farnam Street II, in association with Cabin 14 Productions. It was distributed by First Look International. About <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> film was released, Coyle asked Anne Marie Gillen to serve as executive producer. Gillen said she had not responded to a script in such an emotional way since the 1991 drama film Fried Green Tomatoes, which she also produced. Filming, which began in May 2008, took place entirely in Minneapolis. It included several scenes staged in the city's Uptown commercial district, where Coyle lived.|$|E
5|$|It {{was over}} <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> 2nd Division came {{together}} as a cohesive unit and, during the interim period between formation and arrival in the United Kingdom, many changes to its organization were made. The first brigade concentrations took place in May and June 1940, until which time all units had trained in their own garrisons. The 4th Brigade assembled at Camp Borden in Ontario, the 5th at Valcartier Camp in Quebec, and the 6th at Camp Shilo in Manitoba. The divisional artillery was concentrated at artillery training centres at Camp Petawawa in Ontario, and at Shilo.|$|E

5|$|Ray {{considered}} {{making a}} {{film on the}} Bangladesh Liberation War but later abandoned the idea. He said that, as a filmmaker, he {{was more interested in}} the travails of the refugees and not the politics. In 1977, Ray completed Shatranj Ke Khiladi (The Chess Players), a Hindi film based on a story by Munshi Premchand. It was set in Lucknow in the state of Oudh, <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Indian rebellion of 1857. A commentary on issues related to the colonisation of India by the British, this was Ray's first feature film in a language other than Bengali. It is his most expensive and star-studded film, featuring Sanjeev Kumar, Saeed Jaffrey, Amjad Khan, Shabana Azmi, Victor Bannerjee and Richard Attenborough.|$|E
5|$|The Port Chicago {{disaster}} highlighted systemic racial {{inequality in}} the Navy. <b>A</b> <b>year</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> disaster, in mid-1943, the U.S. Navy had over 100,000 African Americans in service {{but not one}} black officer. In the months following the disaster, the Pittsburgh Courier, a newspaper with a large nationwide subscription primarily of African Americans, related the incident and the subsequent mutiny trial in their Double V campaign, a push for victory over not just the Axis powers but also over racial inequality at home. The mutiny trial was seen as underscoring the tense race relations {{in the armed forces}} at the time.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, in 1962, {{the club}} won the Southern League {{title for the}} second {{successive}} season and {{was elected to the}} Football League Fourth Division, occupying the vacant place left by bankrupt Accrington Stanley. Two successive eighteenth-place finishes followed, before promotion to the Third Division was achieved in 1965. <b>A</b> <b>year</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> promotion, Oxford became the first Fourth Division club to reach the sixth round of the FA Cup, but have not progressed that far in the competition since. Oxford won the Third Division title in 1967–68, their sixth season as a league club, but after eight years of relative stability the club was relegated from the Second Division in 1975–76.|$|E
