40|$|This report {{analyses}} {{the education}} {{component of the}} Human Resource Development sector in order to recommend specific activities which {{take advantage of the}} capabilities of the Global Coalition for Africa (GCA). The paper looks at four sector-wide options and two sub-sector options, chosen because of the potential benefits from GCA involvement in them. The four sector-wide options are: 1) Increasing government support for Human Resource Development. 2) Diversifying the Supply of Educational Services. 3) Formulation of National Education Policy, and 4) Rationalization of High-Level Meetings. Of the four the best option for GCA is the first, which enables GCA to use its reputation and access to advocate for human development with national leaders. The sub-sector options discussed are 1) Vocational Education and Skill Training, and 2) Higher Education. Both of these areas need consensus building and coordination of development efforts. GCA could usefully promote both these areas {{in the second and third}} years of their program, after having highlighted the critical importance of human development in the first year. There are four international organizations with which GCA can collaborate as partners: 1) the Task Force of Donors to African Education, 2) the African Capacity Building Initiative, 3) UNDP’s National Long-Term Perspective Studies, and 4) UNESCO. GCA needs to establish liaison and mutual understanding with all four, but can be most productive by undertaking joint activities with the Donors to African Education during its first three years. The report outlines three possible levels of GCA involvement in the human development sector. Two annexes are included: Annex A describes the organization of the Donors to African Education and the activities of their working groups. Annex B contains an analysis of higher education in Africa and the activities of the major donors.

The Chinese government declared that the Chinese people and government firmly opposed [...] "two Chinas", [...] "one China, one Taiwan" [...] or any similar arrangements, as well as the claim that [...] "the status of Taiwan remains to be determined".

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we study}} how {{agricultural}} policy, and particularly how scale increase, has been {{framed by the}} responsible ministers {{over the last six}} decades. We analyse the different interpretations attached to scale increase and other policy issues, in a longitudinal study of the <b>memoranda</b> <b>accompanying</b> the yearly national budget for the Ministry of Agriculture. Our analysis provides a nuanced explanation for the continuous use of the contested concept of scale increase. We show that the framing of Dutch agricultural policy has undergone considerable changes regarding issues and solutions, the role of international policy and issues from other policy domains. We find that the policy and the policy frames have become more diverse, interdependencies have increased and as a result policy has become more complex and self-referential. Part of our findings can be explained as the occurrence of a paradigm shift. However this does not explain the continuous presence of the logic of scale increase as the way forward for Dutch agriculture. We state that the self-referential agricultural policy system has aimed to continuously improve itself by means of scale increase, without discussing or critically reflecting on the functioning of the system itself. In this process language played a powerful role: changing the language helped to maintain the existing system or paradigm in which scale increase is continuously positively framed as the solution for Dutch agriculture...|$|R
40|$|Using {{a dynamic}} {{multi-product}} partial equilibrium model, this paper firstly examines {{the potential impact}} of recent policy changes accruing from the mid term review of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in 2003 on the cattle and sheep sectors in Ireland. Secondly, this paper evaluates {{the potential impact of}} the implementation of a CAP budget neutral, common EU flat area payment across all Member States. The European Commission has signalled that it will be evaluating current differences in the level of support between Member States as, for example, in the explanatory <b>memorandum</b> <b>accompanying</b> the Commission’s Health Check proposals the Commission argues that it is “increasingly harder to justify the legitimacy of significant individual differences in the support level which are only based on past support” (CEC, 2008; p. 18). This paper demonstrates how there are significant differences in the level of CAP payments per hectare across Member States, as generally farmers in more prosperous Western and Nordic countries receive a much higher level of payment per hectare than farmers in relatively poorer Central and Eastern European countries. In relation to Ireland, similar to most other EU- 15 countries, farmers benefit from the current inequitable distribution of payments and the results indicate that any move towards equalising the level of payments per hectare will have a significant negative impact on agricultural production and net trade.

It was in the fundamental interests, they concluded, of the United Nations to restore promptly to the People's Republic of China its seat in the organization thus putting an end to a grave injustice and dangerous situation which had been perpetuated in order to fulfill a policy that had been increasingly repudiated.

40|$|Executive Order 12898, {{signed on}} February 11, 1994, broadly states that federal activities, programs, and {{policies}} should not produce disproportionately high and adverse impacts on minority and low-income populations. Moreover, the Order indicates that these populations {{should not be}} denied the benefits of, or excluded from participation in, these activities, programs, and policies. Because a presidential <b>memorandum</b> <b>accompanying</b> the order said that National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) documents should begin to address environmental justice immediately, much {{attention has been paid}} to assessment-related issues. Also important, a topic that appears to have received relatively little attention, is how decision makers should be expected to use information about environmental justice in their decision making. This paper discusses issues surrounding the use of environmental justice information in the decision-making process by focusing on the following five main topics: (1) the importance, or weight, attached to environmental justice within larger decision-making contexts; (2) the potential tension between localized environmental justice issues and regional or national issues and needs; (3) the use of environmental justice information to develop (perhaps in concert with affected minority and low-income communities) appropriate mitigation strategies, or to establish conditions under which activities, programs, and policies may be accepted locally; (4) the general implications of shifting the distribution of broadly defined risks, costs, and benefits among different population groups; and (5) the implications of implementing environmental justice on an individual, ad hoc basis rather than within a larger environmental justice framework. This paper raises the issues and discusses the implications of alternative approaches to them...|$|R

40|$|The federal {{government}} 2 ̆ 7 s new quarantining rules won 2 ̆ 7 t {{solve the problem}} they 2 ̆ 7 re designed to address, argues Kemran MestanLIZ is twenty-two. The mother of a six-month old baby, she is neither studying nor working, and she receives the parenting payment (single) from Centrelink. Because Liz lives in a “declared income management area” and is under twenty-five, the {{federal government}}’s new welfare legislation means {{that she will be}} subject to income management because she has been in receipt of the parenting payment for more than thirteen weeks [...] . This case study comes from explanatory <b>memorandum</b> <b>accompanying</b> the federal government’s Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Welfare Reform and Reinstatement of Racial Discrimination Act) Bill, introduced into parliament in late 2009. With this bill the government has kept its promise to reinstate the Racial Discrimination Act, but only at the cost of discriminating against poor people regardless of their indigeneity. “Liz” has not necessarily done anything to suggest she is unable to spend her money prudently for herself or her child, except for living in an area that the minister has deemed to contain “serious disadvantage". Dr John Falzon from the St Vincent de Paul Society describes the policy as “discrimination by postcode", and there are good reasons for questioning its aims and impact. From July 2010 the minister, Jenny Macklin, will be able to demarcate any area within the Northern Territory and quarantine half of an individual 2 ̆ 7 s income support payments and 100 per cent of any lump sum payments. The quarantined income can only be spent using a special card, the Basics Card, at designated stores. Tobacco, alcohol and pornography cannot be purchased using the card. The plan is to apply the same system across Australia by 2011 – 12, again in areas with concentrations of people of low socio-economic status. The categories of people whose welfare can be quarantined (or, as the government prefers to characterise it, “managed”) are described as disengaged youth (which is the category Liz falls into), long-term welfare recipients (excluding pensioners and recipients of disability benefits) and people deemed to require welfare quarantining by a Centrelink social worker or child-protection authority. Although the Northern Territory intervention was initially justified as “saving the children”, many if not most of the people likely to be affected by the new policies do not have children. The government says that a central principle of its welfare reform agenda, of which welfare quarantining is a “key tool”, is based on enhancing individual responsibility. This seems paradoxical: surely people who have less liberty to decide how to spend their money are being entrusted with less responsibility? Moreover, the government is offering incentives to people not included in the mandatory categories to voluntarily relinquish control over half of their income. These measures suggest that when the government speaks of responsibility, what it really means is obligation – that individuals will be required to behave in prescribed ways. The policy doesn’t appear to be intended to demonise marginalised people. With the opposition in disarray, the government has no need to resort to such tactics to secure votes. In fact, releasing the legislation in November, while the media was distracted by an opposition leadership scuffle, suggests that the government does not want to highlight the issue. Although Labor might never have initiated the policy, it has happily embraced the welfare quarantining introduced by the Coalition government. There are two distinct reasons why Labor has so enthusiastically embraced and extended welfare quarantining, one electoral, one ideological. To understand the electoral explanation, we need to recall the context of the introduction of the Northern Territory intervention, when welfare quarantining was established: an election was imminent and John Howard was looking for an issue to “wedge” Labor. Kevin Rudd refused to take the bait, going along with whatever the Coaltion threw at him. Because Mr Rudd has sought to avoid abrupt policy changes – to stick to his promises and convictions – he has shown a reluctance to reverse endorsed policies such as his support for quarantining. On the other hand, though, Mr Rudd and his government are keen to be respected players internationally. Hence, in April last year the government affirmed support for the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. (Australia was one of only four nations that initially failed to sign the agreement in 2007.) The problem, as the United Nations Human Rights Rapporteur asserted in September 2009, was that the Northern Territory intervention, which suspended the Racial Discrimination Act, was incompatible with Australia’s obligations. One obvious solution was to expand welfare quarantining to non-Indigenous people. This was an easier choice for the Rudd government because welfare quarantining is consistent with an increasingly prevalent ideological trend, implemented by both Labour and the Coalition. This trend has seen a shift from understanding poverty in terms of systemic failures, such as structural unemployment, to viewing it as a result of individual failures, such as incompetent, criminal or immoral behaviour. Hence, policy solutions are largely based on controlling the behaviour of disadvantaged people. Welfare quarantining {{is not the first time}} that Aboriginal people have been used as guinea pigs for implementing policies that were later applied to broader disadvantaged populations. In 1977 the Fraser government introduced a work for the dole scheme for Indigenous people called Community Development Employment Projects. Programs resembling this scheme were then applied to non-indigenous populations by Labor, which mandated activity agreements and introduced a Job Compact scheme that drew on the idea of reciprocal obligation. These policies were then the foundation for the Coalition government’s Mutual Obligation strategy, which intensified the punitive elements attached to activity requirements. Although the government would never describe its policies as paternalistic, its stated justifications for the policy are explicitly so. But paternalistic policies, like even some of the worst social policies, are based on a grain of truth. It would be naive to think that some people receiving income support do not spend their money in imprudent ways. Good social policy comes from considering all the relevant facts and giving them appropriate weight. It is a matter of what is emphasised and what is neglected. Welfare quarantining emphasises individual failures and neglects the causes of poverty, such as poor education resources and a lack of opportunities for fulfilling employment. Furthermore, welfare quarantining is by far the most significant change to welfare policy that the Rudd government has introduced. How is quarantining welfare payments meant to “tackle the destructive, intergenerational cycle of passive welfare”? This is not a rhetorical question, but a request to the policy-makers for further explanation. Not only is welfare quarantining unlikely to achieve its stated goals, it will have adverse effects, making the lives of the worst off even worse. Welfare quarantining will stigmatise the targeted populations; it sends out the message that people who receive welfare are irresponsible. Imagine having to pay for your groceries with a quarantine card: it’s likely you would be anxious that the surrounding people are thinking “this is one of those people that can’t be trusted with money and she probably abuses her kids. ” Thus a trip to the store could become an ordeal. Although people can gain exceptions from quarantining, the burden of proof lies on them, with the assumption of incompetence or untrustworthiness until demonstrated otherwise. Furthermore, gaining the proof could be a humiliating experience, such as requesting your child’s school provide evidence that your child has been attending regularly. The burden of proof should surely be reversed. Only if there is a strong case that an individual could benefit from welfare quarantining should it be considered. For example, in the case of child wellbeing, case by case welfare quarantining could be combined with improved universal services. That is, improved maternal and child health services could involve nurses more regularly visiting homes to provide healthcare for children, and thereby they would be well placed to report risks to child well-being. This would avoid stigmatising whole populations merely based on where they live and if they require welfare support, thus preserving Australian egalitarianism. Under the current arrangement though, to add to the injury of stigmatisation, the government will insultingly offer a one-off matched savings payment, but only on the condition that the person undertakes a money management course. Anyone capable of saving a single cent on an annual income as low as 11, 856, in the case of New Start allowance, surely has no need for such courses. What’s worse, on completing the money management course, the additional payment is itself quarantined; the government obviously doesn’t have much faith in money management courses. Welfare quarantining won’t increase personal responsibility, and it will certainly not break the cycle of intergenerational poverty, but on the other hand it will stigmatise whole populations. The government’s attention to addressing disadvantage is commendable, but policies that largely attribute the causes of disadvantage to individual failings, whilst ignoring the structural issues, are unlikely to have a significant positive effect. • Kemran Mestan is a PhD student in the Institute for Social Research at Swinburne University of Technology Photo: Andrew Jeffre...|$|R
