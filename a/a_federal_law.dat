5|$|In Congress, Nixon {{supported}} the Taft–Hartley Act of 1947, <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> <b>law</b> that monitors {{the activities and}} power of labor unions, and he served on the Education and Labor Committee.

5|$|Madison {{argued that}} a state, after declaring <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> <b>law</b> unconstitutional, could take action by {{communicating}} with other states, attempting to enlist their support, petitioning Congress to repeal the law in question, introducing amendments to the Constitution in Congress, or calling a constitutional convention. Madison did not assert that the states could legally nullify an objectionable federal law or that they could declare it void and unenforceable. By eschewing direct action in favor of influencing popular opinion, Madison tried {{to make clear that}} the Democratic-Republicans were not moving toward disunion.|$|E
5|$|The author {{contrasts}} Regents of the University of California v. Bakke {{with the}} Supreme Court's 1971 decision in Griggs v. Duke Power Co., which ruled that employers {{did not have}} to willfully discriminate against employees to violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger wrote that certain standardized tests given by employers could be discriminatory, even if that was not the employer's intent. Another case discussed by Heins is the 1980 Supreme Court decision in Fullilove v. Klutznick, wherein the court ruled constitutional <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> <b>law</b> requiring a percentage of funds for a building project to be used for minority workers.|$|E
5|$|Afroyim v. Rusk, , {{is a major}} United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court ruled that {{citizens}} of the United States may not be deprived of their citizenship involuntarily. The U.S. government had attempted to revoke the citizenship of Beys Afroyim, a man born in Poland, because he had cast a vote in an Israeli election after becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen. The Supreme Court decided that Afroyim's right to retain his citizenship was guaranteed by the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. In so doing, the Court struck down <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> <b>law</b> mandating loss of U.S. citizenship for voting in a foreign election—thereby overruling one of its own precedents, Perez v. Brownell (1958), in which it had upheld loss of citizenship under similar circumstances less than a decade earlier.|$|E

5|$|As a United States {{district}} court, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri conducts civil {{trials and}} issues orders. The cases it hears concern either federal question jurisdiction, where <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> <b>law</b> or treaty is applicable, or diversity jurisdiction, where parties are domiciled in different states. The court also holds criminal trials of persons charged with violations of federal law. Appeals from cases {{brought in the}} Eastern District of Missouri are heard by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (except for patent claims and claims against the U.S. government under the Tucker Act, which are appealed to the Federal Circuit). These cases can then be appealed to the United States Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|Much of the 1964 {{session was}} devoted to a bill to desegregate public {{accommodations}} in Kentucky. A rally {{in favor of the}} bill was held in March and was attended by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Reverend Ralph Abernathy, and baseball player Jackie Robinson. Despite this, the bill did not make it out of legislative committee. As a member of the Southern Governors Conference in October 1964, Breathitt was one of three governors to oppose George Wallace's proposed constitutional amendment to give states and state courts sole jurisdiction over their public schools, preventing <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> <b>law</b> to integrate them. Breathitt's opposition helped prevent the Conference's endorsement of the amendment, since endorsement required a unanimous vote.|$|E
5|$|Spent {{nuclear fuel}} is the {{radioactive}} by-product of electricity generation at commercial nuclear power plants, and {{high-level radioactive waste}} is the by-product from reprocessing spent fuel to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons. In 1982, the United States Congress established a national policy {{to solve the problem}} of nuclear waste disposal. This policy is <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> <b>law</b> called the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, which made the DOE responsible for finding a site, building, and operating an underground disposal facility called a geologic repository. The recommendation to use a geologic repository dates back to 1957 when the National Academy of Sciences recommended that the best means of protecting the environment and public health and safety would be to dispose of the waste in rock deep underground.|$|E

The ACLU also played a key role in initiating a nationwide effort to reduce misconduct (such as extracting false confessions) within police departments, by publishing the report Lawlessness in Law Enforcement in 1931, under the auspices of Herbert Hoover's Wickersham Commission. In 1934, the ACLU lobbied for the passage of the Indian Reorganization Act, which restored some autonomy to Native American tribes, and established penalties for kidnapping Native American children.|$|E
5|$|Free silver Democrats {{challenged}} Hunter's naturalization. It {{was finally}} concluded that Hunter, an Englishman, was naturalized under provisions of <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> <b>law</b> {{that allowed him}} to omit the standard preliminaries because of his service as a surgeon in the U.S. Army. Over the course of the contest, Hunter was also indicted for bribery, but was acquitted in short order for lack of evidence. Voting proceeded over several days, and demonstrators in the chamber galleries became disruptive in their support of various candidates. A Kentucky Post account from March 7, 1896, recorded that good-humored legislators began pelting each other with paper wads during the day's deliberations. This attempt at levity escalated until wrapped transcripts of the governor's message to the legislature were flying through the air. By March 11, tensions had reached the point that armed Democratic supporters were standing outside the state house in an attempt to intimidate Republican lawmakers and discourage them from entering. Attempts were made to unseat several legislators in the General Assembly, leading to threats of violence. Observers were banned from the gallery, and everyone entering the state house was searched for weapons.|$|E
5|$|The {{first person}} to officially occupy the {{position}} was Spanish conquistador Juan Ponce de León in 1509. At the time, the Spanish monarchy was responsible for appointing the functionary who would perform this office. The first native Puerto Rican to perform the function was Juan Ponce de León II, as interim governor in 1579. During this administration, all of those appointed to take the position had served another function within the empire's government or the Roman Catholic Church. In 1898, the United States invaded Puerto Rico and the Spanish government ceded control of the island to the United States. During the first two years, the entire government in Puerto Rico was appointed by the President of the United States. In 1900, the American government approved {{the establishment of the}} Foraker Act as <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> <b>law,</b> this act established a civilian government in the island. In 1947, the federal Elective Governor Act was enacted, which created a new system where, since 1948, the governor is elected through a democratic process every four years. The governor is in charge of Puerto Rico's executive branch and is responsible for appointing executive branch agency heads, including the Secretary of State, who fulfills the role of lieutenant governor, the legislative branch's Ombudsman and Comptroller and all judges in the judicial branch.|$|E
