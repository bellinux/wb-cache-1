2500|$|In late 2013 {{he again}} {{suggested}} that African Americans possess a [...] "slick" [...] style of boxing which {{is superior to}} other styles (presumably practiced by non-African Americans). [...] "The great Sugar Ray Leonard, right now, if he was boxing, {{the way that they}} want you to fight, the people that pull the strings of the puppet, he would be boring today. Ray Robinson – the great Robinson – would be boring today…Because the feeders of the people that buy entertainment. They're being fed that if they duck, don't buy it. If they're slick, and they beat [...] nine out of the 12 rounds, and the guy just can't hit him because they were slick and smart enough to hit and not get hit, 'He's not crowd-pleasing, he don't sell tickets.' Because they done fed the followers and they done fed [...] to the customers. The customers will drink <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> give them if it's promoted right…But when you take away the skill and you take away the slick, and you take away the boxing ability and say that's not entertaining, or that's not entertainment, then, to me, it's like trying to erase a culture that you know has dominated the sport way back then where you were slick. And I'm talking about black fighters. Yes, I said it", said Hopkins.|$|E
2500|$|In 1917, France {{had been}} badly {{shaken by the}} Great Mutinies of the French Army {{in the spring of}} 1917 {{following}} the failure of the Nivelle Offensive together with a huge strike wave, and at the time, many believed that France might simply collapse as a result of war exhaustion. In July 1917, a new government under Georges Clemenceau, aka [...] "le tigre", had come into power, utterly committed to winning the war. In this context, having one German spy for whom everything that went wrong with the war so far could be blamed was most convenient for the French government, making Mata Hari the perfect scapegoat, which explains why the case against her received maximum publicity in the French press, and led to her importance in the war being greatly exaggerated. The Canadian historian Wesley Wark stated in a 2014 interview that Mata Hari was never an important spy and just made a scapegoat for French military failures which she had nothing to do with, stating: [...] "They needed a scapegoat and she was a notable target for scapegoating". Likewise, the British historian Julie Wheelwright stated: [...] "She really did not pass on <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> couldn’t find in the local newspapers in Spain". Wheelwright went on to describe Zelle as [...] "...an independent woman, a divorcee, a citizen of a neutral country, a courtesan and a dancer, which made her a perfect scapegoat for the French, who were then losing the war. She was kind of held up as an example of what might happen if your morals were too loose”.|$|E
