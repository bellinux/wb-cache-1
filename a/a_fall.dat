Some fundamental properties are investigated. Relations among <b>a</b> <b>falling</b> -subalgebra, <b>a</b> <b>falling</b> -ideal, <b>a</b> <b>falling</b> -ideal, and <b>a</b> <b>falling</b> ♯-ideal are stated.

40|$|How does <b>a</b> <b>falling</b> cat {{change her}} {{orientation}} in midair without violating angular momentum constraint? This {{has become an}} interesting problem to both control engineers and roboticists. In this paper, we address this problem together with a constructive solution. First, we show that <b>a</b> <b>falling</b> cat problem {{is equivalent to the}} constructive nonlinear controllability problem. Thus, the same principle and algorithm used by <b>a</b> <b>falling</b> cat can be used for space robotic applications, such as reorientation of a satellite using rotors and attitude control of a space structure using internal motion, and other robotic tasks, such as dextrous manipulation with multifingered robotic hands and nonholonomic motion planning for mobile robots. Then, using ideas from Ritz Approximation Theory, we develop a simple algorithm for motion planning of <b>a</b> <b>falling</b> cat. Finally, we test the algorithm through simulation on two widely accepted models of <b>a</b> <b>falling</b> cat. It {{is interesting to note that}} one set of simulation results closely resembles the real trajectories employed by <b>a</b> <b>falling</b> cat...|$|R
