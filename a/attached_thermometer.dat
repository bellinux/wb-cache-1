60|$|At {{these great}} heights {{the weather was}} never fine {{for more than an}} hour at a time, and a driving sleet {{followed}} by thick snow drove me down on both these occasions. Another time I ascended a third spur from this great mountain, and was overtaken by a heavy gale and thunderstorm, the latter is a rare phenomenon: it blew down my tripod and instruments which I had thought securely Propped with stones, and the thermometers were broken, but fortunately not the barometer. On picking up the latter, which lay with its top down the hill, a large bubble of air appeared, which I passed up and down the tube, and then allowed to escape; when I heard a rattling of broken glass in the cistern. Having another barometer* [This barometer (one of Newman's portable instruments) I have now at Kew: it was compared with the Royal Society's standard before leaving England; and varied according to comparisons made with the Calcutta standard 0.012 during its travels; on leaving Calcutta its error was 0; and on arriving in England, by the standard of the Royal Society, +.004. I have given in the Appendix some remarks on the use of these barometers, which (though they have obvious defects), are less liable to derangement, far more portable, and stand much heavier shocks than those of any other construction with which I am familiar.] at my tent, I hastened to ascertain by comparison whether the instrument which had travelled with me from England, and taken so many thousand observations, was seriously damaged: to my delight an error of 0.020 was all I could detect at Momay and all other lower stations. On my return to Dorjiling in December, I took it to pieces, and found the lower part of the bulb of the <b>attached</b> <b>thermometer</b> broken off, and floating on the mercury. Having quite expected this, I always checked the observations of the <b>attached</b> <b>thermometer</b> by another, but--how, it is not easy to say--the broken one invariably gave a correct temperature.|$|E
40|$|The {{collection}} contains {{a series of}} recorded meteorological observations taken daily between 1877 - 1922 by pastoralist, astronomer and meteorologist Algernon Henry Belfield at Eversleigh Station in the New England region, 20 kilometres north west of Armidale. The collection comprises 42 Meteorological Observation Books, available as 28 PDF files containing scans of front cover, back cover and each page for each Meteorological Observation Book. The combined size of all data files is 477 MB. The original Meteorological Observation Books for years 1879, 1880 and 1881 are missing and therefore are not digitally available. Daily observations/readings include: <b>attached</b> <b>thermometer,</b> barometer, dry bulb, wet bulb, maximum temperature (Fahrenheit), minimum temperature (Fahrenheit), rain (measure), direction of wind, wind force 0 - 12, cloud coverage 0 - 10, visual daily weather observations including fine and clear, cloudy, fog, thunder, showery, dull, cloudless, squally. Monthly tallies were recorded including: total days of rain, total days of lightning, mean diurnal range, greatest diurnal range, greatest range, mean temperature, mean maximum, mean minimum, mean dry, mean wet, mean cloud, mean humidity, inches of rain, inches of rain (since beginning of the year), winds. The original Meteorological Observing Books were deposited in the University of New England Heritage Centre by Mr Richard E. H. Belfield, Algernon Belfield's grandson. The collection was digitised for Cultural Collections, University of Newcastle by William Oates, University Archivist at the University of New England Heritage Centre...|$|E
50|$|If the {{resistance}} of the absorbing element depends on the electron temperature, then {{the resistance}} {{can be used as a}} thermometer of the electron system. This is the case for both semiconducting and superconducting materials at low temperature. If the absorbing element does not have a temperature-dependent resistance, as is typical of normal (non-superconducting) metals at very low temperature, then an <b>attached</b> resistive <b>thermometer</b> can be used to measure the electron temperature.|$|R
50|$|A sling psychrometer, {{which uses}} <b>thermometers</b> <b>attached</b> to a handle or {{length of rope}} and spun {{in the air for}} about one minute, is {{sometimes}} used for field measurements, but is being replaced by more convenient electronic sensors. A whirling psychrometer uses the same principle, but the two thermometers are fitted into a device that resembles a ratchet or football rattle.|$|R
40|$|We use the {{temperature}} dependent c axis critical current and characteristic gap voltage as temperature gauges {{to assess the}} self-heating in stacks of intrinsic Josephson junctions etched out from the ultrathin Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8 + 	&# 948;(BSCCO) single crystals. The thermal resistance which characterizes the overall cooling efficiency {{is found to be}} &# 8764; 120 – 160 K mW- 1 for the two stacks studied. This value is in agreement with earlier reports for stacks of similar geometry, while it is about two to three times higher than for simple mesas made on the surfaces of mm-size BSCCO single crystals. The suggested method can guarantee the validity of {{the temperature}} estimations inside the stacks of various geometries and different cooling efficiencies without the need for <b>attaching</b> additional <b>thermometers...</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{sample in}} a fusion tube is <b>attached</b> to a <b>thermometer</b> {{with a rubber}} band, and {{immersed}} in the tube. A sealed capillary, open end pointing down, {{is placed in the}} fusion tube. The Thiele tube is heated; dissolved gases evolve from the sample first. Once the sample starts to boil, heating is stopped, and the temperature starts to fall. The temperature at which the liquid sample is sucked into the sealed capillary is the boiling point of the sample.|$|R
50|$|A {{bolometer}} {{consists of}} an absorptive element, such as {{a thin layer of}} metal, connected to a thermal reservoir (a body of constant temperature) through a thermal link. The result is that any radiation impinging on the absorptive element raises its temperature above that of the reservoir - the greater the absorbed power, the higher the temperature. The intrinsic thermal time constant, which sets the speed of the detector, is equal to the ratio of the heat capacity of the absorptive element to the thermal conductance between the absorptive element and the reservoir. The temperature change can be measured directly with an <b>attached</b> resistive <b>thermometer,</b> or the resistance of the absorptive element itself {{can be used as a}} thermometer. Metal bolometers usually work without cooling. They are produced from thin foils or metal films. Today, most bolometers use semiconductor or superconductor absorptive elements rather than metals. These devices can be operated at cryogenic temperatures, enabling significantly greater sensitivity.|$|R
5000|$|A {{calorimeter}} is {{an object}} used for calorimetry, or {{the process of}} measuring the heat of chemical reactions or physical changes as well as heat capacity. Differential scanning calorimeters, isothermal micro calorimeters, titration calorimeters and accelerated rate calorimeters {{are among the most}} common types. A simple calorimeter just consists of a <b>thermometer</b> <b>attached</b> to a metal container full of water suspended above a combustion chamber.It is very helpful in the study of thermodynamics and the law of heat transfer but the value that comes from the calorimeter is always an approximated value because there is a slight loss or gain of heat during operation or through the wall of calorimeter.|$|R
50|$|A {{sample in}} a sealed capillary, <b>attached</b> to a <b>thermometer</b> with a rubber band, is {{immersed}} in the tube. Heating is commenced, and the temperature ranges at which the sample melts can then be observed. During heating, {{the point at which}} melting is observed and the temperature constant is the melting point of the sample. A more modern method uses dedicated equipment, known as a melting point apparatus. A slow heating rate at the melting point is needed in order to get an accurate measurement. Record the temperature on the thermometer when the sample starts to melt and record the temperature again when all of the sample has melted (this gives you the melting point range, which is what is usually quoted in chemical literature).|$|R
5000|$|Oil {{is poured}} into the tube, and then the [...] "handle" [...] is heated, either by a small flame or some other heating element. The shape of the Thiele tube allows for {{formation}} of convection currents in the oil when it is heated. These currents maintain a fairly uniform temperature distribution throughout the oil in the tube. The side arm of the tube is designed to generate these convection currents and thus transfer {{the heat from the}} flame evenly and rapidly throughout the heating oil. The sample, packed in a capillary tube, is <b>attached</b> to the <b>thermometer,</b> and held by means of a rubber band or a small slice of rubber tubing. The Thiele tube is usually heated using a microburner with a small flame.|$|R
40|$|Quench {{detection}} for 9 -cell ILC cavities {{is presently}} a cumbersome procedure requiring {{two or more}} cold tests. One cold test identifies the cell-pair involved via quench field measurements in several pass-band modes. A second test follows with numerous fixed <b>thermometers</b> <b>attached</b> to the culprit cell-pair to identify the particular cell. A third measurement with many localized fixed thermometers is necessary to zoom in on the quench spot. We report here on a far more efficient alternative method which utilizes a few (e. g. 8) oscillating superleak transducers to detect the He-II second sound wave driven by the defect induced quench. Using a 9 -cell reentrant cavity we identified the quench location in one cold test by powering several modes of the fundamental pass-band. Results characterizing the defect location with He-II second sound detection and corroborating measurements with carbon thermometers will be presented...|$|R
40|$|Superconducting RF cavity quench {{location}} is presently a cumbersome procedure requiring {{two or more}} expensive cold tests with large arrays of thermometers. One cold test identifies the cell-pair involved via quench field measurements. A second test follows with numerous fixed <b>thermometers</b> <b>attached</b> to the culprit cell-pair to identify the particular cell. A third measurement with many localized thermometers is necessary to zoom in on the quench spot. By operating superconducting RF cavities at temperatures below the lambda point the second sound wave emanating from the location where quench occurred can be utilized to triangulate on the quench-spot. Here a method which utilizes a few (e. g. 8) oscillating superleak transducers (OST) to detect the He-II second sound wave driven by the defect induced quench is discussed. Results characterizing defect location with He-II second sound wave OST detection, corroborating measurements with carbon thermometers, and second sound aided cavity repairs will be presented...|$|R
40|$|Several 9 -cell {{cavities}} {{processed by}} electropolishing (EP) and RF tested at Jefferson Lab {{are found to}} be quench-limited. Pass-band mode excitation measurements provide the first clue of candidate cells responsible for the limit. A second RF test with <b>thermometers</b> <b>attached</b> to the equator region of candidate cells (typically only 2 candidates) reveals a hot spot caused by excessive heating of the operational defect and hence determines its location. High resolution optical tools inspect the RF surface corresponding to the hot spot to image and document the defect. All defects in cavities quench limited < 21 MV/m are sub-mm sized irregularities near but outside of the equator EBW. In contrast, no observable irregularities are found in some other cavities that are quench-limited ~ 30 MV/m. These two types of quench limited cavities have different response to a second EP processing. In this paper, we will give a summary of the test results and attempt to catalog the observed defects. An equation for quench gradient is given...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the temperature {{variation in the}} pulp chamber during photoactivation of two restorative composite resins (Filtek P 90 silorane-based composite and Heliomolar methacrylate-based composite) with either a quartz-tungsten-halogen (QTH) or lightemitting diodes (LED) light-curing unit (LCU) and using dentin thicknesses (0. 5 and 1. 0 mm). Standardized cavities (2 × 2 × 2 mm) were prepared in 80 bovine incisors, which {{were randomly assigned to}} 8 groups according to the photoactivation method and dentin thickness. Filtek P 90 and Heliomolar (both in shade A 3) were used with their respective adhesive systems (P 90 self-etch primer / P 90 adhesive bond and Excite adhesive). All experiments were carried out in a controlled environment (37 °C). The temperature variations (°C) were recorded using a digital <b>thermometer</b> <b>attached</b> to a K-type thermocouple. The results were analyzed statistically by ANOVA and Tukey's test (α= 0. 05). For composite/ dentin thickness interaction, temperature increase was significantly higher in 0. 5 mm dentin thickness (40. 07 °C) compared with 1. 0 mm dentin thickness (39. 61 °C) for Filtek P 90. For composite/LCU interaction, the temperature increase was significantly higher for Filtek P 90 (39. 21 °C - QTH and 40. 47 °C - LED) compared with Heliomolar (38. 40 °C - QTH and 39. 30 °C - LED). The silorane-based composite promoted higher temperature increase in the pulp chamber than the methacrylate-based composite...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{problem of}} {{simplicity}} involves three questions: How is {{the simplicity of}} a hypothesis to be measured? How {{is the use of}} simplicity as a guide to hypothesis choice to be justified? And how is simplicity related to other desirable features of hypotheses [...] that is, how is simplicity to be traded-off? The present paper explores these three questions, from a variety of viewpoints, including Bayesianism, likelihoodism, and the framework of predictive accuracy formulated by Akaike (1973). It may turn out that simplicity has no global justification [...] that its justification varies from problem to problem. Scientists sometimes choose between rival hypotheses {{on the basis of their}} simplicity. Nonscientists do the same thing; this is no surprise, given that the methods used in science often reflect patterns of reasoning that are at work in everyday life. When people choose the simpler of two theories, this “choosing ” can mean different things. The simpler theory may be chosen because it is aesthetically more pleasing, because it is easier to understand or remember, or because it is easier to test. However, when philosophers talk about the “problem of simplicity,” they usually are thinking about another sort of choosing. The idea is that choosing the simpler 1 theory means regarding it as more plausible than its more complex rival. Philosophers often describe the role of simplicity in hypothesis choice by talking about the problem of curve-fitting. Consider the following experiment. You put a sealed pot on a stove. The pot has a <b>thermometer</b> <b>attached</b> to it as well as a device that measures how much pressure the gas inside exerts on the walls of the pot. You then heat the pot to various temperatures and observe how much pressure there is in the pot. Each temperature reading with its associated pressure reading can be represented as a point in the coordinate system depicted below. The problem is to decide what the general relationship is between temperature and pressure for this system, given the data. Each hypothesis about this general relationship takes the form of a line. Which line is most plausible, given the observations you have made...|$|R
