5|$|Helvellyn may be {{included}} in <b>a</b> <b>traverse</b> of {{the full length of}} the Helvellyn range in either direction, but with a greater sense of climax when starting from the north. Most of the ridge track is a bridleway and so the route can be completed by mountain bike in a challenging six-hour circular route of 16 miles off-road and 10 miles on-road riding. This may begin (and finish) at Mill Bridge near Grasmere.|$|E

25|$|Layman {{only had}} time to make changes to Ravens armament. He closed the two {{foremost}} ports and replaced their guns with a single 68-pounder carronade that he mounted on <b>a</b> <b>traverse</b> carriage (i.e., pivot-mounted) immediately before the foremast {{in a way that}} it could fire over the gunwales. Similarly, a second 68-pounder, also mounted on <b>a</b> <b>traverse,</b> replaced the two stern chasers. Should gunboats threaten a becalmed Raven, she could present a powerful response on any azimuth.|$|E
25|$|The East Ridge {{was first}} climbed in descent {{as part of}} <b>a</b> <b>traverse</b> from the Dômes de Miage by Katharine Richardson, Emile Rey and Jean-Baptiste Bich on 13 August 1888.|$|E
25|$|The hill may be {{climbed in}} a short twenty-minute walk from the Church of St John's in the Vale. It only {{involves}} about 120m (400ft) of climb {{and is one of}} the shortest ascents in the Lakes. Alternatively, <b>a</b> <b>traverse</b> of the fell's three mile (5km) long ridge may be made, starting at Tewit Tarn and finishing near Shoulthwaite.|$|E

25|$|In December 1872, rail service {{arrived in}} Traverse City via <b>a</b> <b>Traverse</b> City Rail Road Company spur from the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad line at Walton Junction.

25|$|It {{begins by}} winding through the notably scrubbier woods of these slopes before finally {{settling}} for <b>a</b> <b>traverse</b> up past some impressive rock outcrops, where {{it becomes more}} heavily trodden and easier to follow. Finally, just above , it reaches a short but steep open rock face that requires some scrambling to reward the climber {{with a view to}} the north of the Blackhead Range, over Kaaterskill Clove, with Kaaterskill Falls clearly visible below.|$|E
25|$|A {{limited amount}} of charter flying (passenger and freight) also occurred, {{including}} BIA's speciality of one-hour aerial geography trips for school groups from the Gatwick catchment area, which {{took advantage of the}} Herald's superb downward passenger visibility (due to high wings and relatively large windows) on low altitude flying tours of Southeast England, usually incorporating <b>a</b> <b>traverse</b> of the south coasts of Kent, Sussex and Hampshire and the opportunity to see the North and South Downs plus the Weald from the air.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> {{compound}} <b>traverse</b> {{is where}} <b>an</b> open <b>traverse</b> is linked at its ends to <b>an</b> existing <b>traverse</b> to form <b>a</b> closed <b>traverse.</b> The closing line {{may be defined}} by coordinates at the end points which have been determined by previous survey. The difficulty is, where there is linear misclosure, {{it is not known}} whether the error is in the new survey or the previous survey.|$|R

25|$|Generally, speed humps have <b>a</b> <b>traverse</b> {{distance}} of about 12 to 14 feet (3.7 to 4.25 m) and span {{the width of the}} road. The height of each hump ranges from 3 to 4 inches (7.5 to 10cm). The traverse distance and height of each hump determines the speed at which traffic will travel over the devices. Shorter traverse lengths and greater heights slow cars most drastically. When placed in a series 350550 feet (100170 m) apart, humps will reduce 85th percentile speeds by 810mph (1315km/h).|$|E
25|$|The Type 1 47mm {{anti-tank}} gun was accepted into service in 1942. The design originated as an improvement to the prototype “Experimental Type 97 (1937) 47 mm {{anti-tank gun}}” (試製九七式四十七粍速射砲), which was tested between 1938 and 1939. The prototype weighed 567 kilograms with a barrel length of 2,515mm, <b>a</b> <b>traverse</b> range of ±50 degrees and an elevation range of between minus 10 and plus 20 degrees, and a muzzle velocity of 730m/s. The prototype was not accepted into service {{because it was}} considered to not have sufficient performance.|$|E
25|$|Traverse: Crossing the {{mountain}} {{as part of}} a three-day ascent of Mont Blanc involves climbing up the south ridge of the Aiguille de Bionnassay from the Col de Miage, then descending from the summit down its razor-sharp, icy, and often corniced east (frontier) ridge. From there the route climbs again up the west ridge of the Dome du Gouter, past the Vallot Hut, to reach the Bosses ridge and thence to the summit of Mont Blanc. The route has been described as 'a truly magical expedition of ice and snow aretes at great altitude'. The Durier Hut on the Col de Miage can either be reached directly from the village of Tresse via an increasingly broken slope of scree in its upper reaches, or via <b>a</b> <b>traverse</b> from the Conscrits Hut over the Dômes de Miage.|$|E

40|$|The {{results are}} {{presented}} of in-flight comparisons {{of a number of}} boundary-layer and wake measurement probes suitable for low-speed flight-test investigations. The tested boundary-layer probes included <b>a</b> <b>traversing</b> total-pressure probe and a hot-film probe mounted on an internally-mounted drive mechanism, a curved and a straight boundary-layer rake, and <b>a</b> <b>traversing</b> hot-film probe with an externally-mounted drive mechanism. The wake measuring devices included <b>a</b> <b>traversing,</b> self-aligning probe, <b>a</b> wake rake, and an integrating wake rate. The boundary-layer data are compared with a common reference velocity profile and comments given regarding the accuracy of the static-pressure and total-pressure measurements. Discussions on the various calibration presentations used with hot-wire and hot-film sensors and various aspects of improving the accuracy of hot-film sensor results are given in the appendix of this report...|$|R

500|$|Three placenames in the Canadian {{province}} of British Columbia were conferred {{in honour of}} the Birkenhead disaster by Hudson's Bay Company explorer Alexander Caulfield Anderson, a boyhood friend and cousin of Lt-Col. Seton of the 74th Regiment of Foot, on <b>a</b> <b>traverse</b> of uncharted country between the Fraser Canyon and the coastal Lower Mainland in 1846. [...] Named after his cousin, Seton Lake cuts west through the Coast Mountains from the Fraser Canyon town of Lillooet, beyond which is its twin Anderson Lake.|$|E
500|$|The {{pilot model}} was {{built at the}} Aberdeen Proving Ground in May 1942. The 57mm Gun M1 was mounted in the M12 recoil {{mechanism}} and installed on a tubular pedestal. The tubular pedestal was soon replaced with a conical structure that was designated the [...] "57mm gun mount T5". The gun on the pilot model had <b>a</b> <b>traverse</b> of 27.5 degrees {{either side of the}} centerline (total of 55 degrees), while having an elevation of +15 to -5 degrees. The short-barrelled (43 caliber) British Mark III 6-pounder gun was installed in the pilot, but the longer-barrelled (50 caliber) 57mm Gun M1 was specified for the production models. The original travel lock – to hold the gun in a fixed position when the vehicle was moving – proved to be unsatisfactory, and was replaced by a travel lock on the front hood.|$|E
500|$|The Königs were an {{improvement}} over the preceding {{one of the primary}} changes being in the disposition of the main gun battery. The Kaiser-class ships mounted ten 30.5cm (12in) SK L/50 guns in five twin turrets; one turret was mounted fore, two aft in a superfiring arrangement, and the other two as wing turrets in a zig-zag [...] "echelon" [...] configuration amidships. For the König class, the use of main-gun wing turrets was abandoned. Instead, a second turret was moved forward and placed in a superfiring arrangement, and a single rear-facing turret was mounted centerline amidships; with <b>a</b> <b>traverse</b> allowing for broadsides but not forward-fire. The two superfiring aft turrets remained. This allowed for a wider angle of fire on the broadside, as all 10 guns could fire on a large area. [...] It did, however, reduce the ship's forward-fire capabilities; from six guns with only limited traverse on the two wing turrets, to four guns with full traverse.|$|E

500|$|While {{this may}} have {{seemed like a good}} plan, Jourdan's choice of ground created {{problems}} for him later. The plain below Pfullendorf was riddled with such streams and brooks as the Ostrach, a Danube tributary, which drained out of the marshes and swamps of Pfrungenried; in the spring of most years, this was not the best choice of ground. Although from Pfullendorf and the more moderate heights {{to the north of the}} village of Ostrach, Jourdan could establish reasonable artillery positions, the softness of the marshland itself would diminish the impact of a cannonade on the Austrian line. The marsh was also prone to fogginess, which would hinder visual planning and tactics. Furthermore, the softness of the ground would make the use of cavalry difficult, and cavalry maneuvers would be made more difficult by the likelihood of fog. Finally, the major part of Charles' army had wintered immediately east of the Lech, which Jourdan knew, because he had sent agents into Germany with instructions to identify the location and strength of his enemy. [...] This was less than [...] distant; any passage over the Lech was facilitated by available bridges, both of permanent construction and temporary pontoons and <b>a</b> <b>traverse</b> through friendly territory.|$|E
500|$|Like all battleships, the Iowas carried heavy armor {{protection}} against shellfire and bombs with significant underwater {{protection against}} torpedoes. The Iowas [...] "all-or-nothing" [...] armor scheme was modeled on {{that of the}} preceding South Dakota-class, and designed to give a zone of immunity against fire from 16-inch/45-caliber guns between [...] away. The protection system includes Class A face-hardened Krupp cemented (K.C.) armor and Class B homogeneous Krupp-type armor; furthermore, Special Treatment Steel (STS), a high-tensile structural steel with armor properties comparable to Class B, was extensively used in the hull plating to increase protection. The citadel consisting of the magazines and engine rooms were protected by an STS outer hull plating [...] thick and a Class A armor belt [...] thick mounted on [...] STS backing plate; the armor belt is sloped at 19 degrees, equivalent to [...] at 19,000 yards. The armor belt extends to the triple bottom, where the Class B lower portion tapers to [...] The ends of the armored citadel are closed by [...] vertical Class <b>A</b> <b>traverse</b> bulkheads {{for the first two}} ships of the class. Missouri and Wisconsin incorporated the most significant change in armor from the South Dakotas: the increase to [...] of the armor on the forward transverse armored bulkhead. [...] The extra armor provided protection from fire directly ahead, which was considered more likely given the high speed of the Iowas.|$|E
500|$|As designed, the Montanas {{used the}} [...] "all or nothing" [...] armor philosophy, {{with most of}} the armor {{concentrated}} on the citadel that includes the machinery spaces, armament, magazines, and command and control facilities. Unlike the previous Iowa-class, the Montana-class design returned to an external armor belt due to the greater beam providing sufficient stability while having the required belt inclination; this arrangement would have made construction and damage repairs much easier. The belt armor would be [...] Class A face-hardened Krupp cemented (K.C.) armor mounted on [...] Special Treatment Steel (STS), inclined at 19 degrees. Below the waterline, the belt tapered to [...] To protect against potential underwater hits, the ships would have a separate [...] Class B homogeneous Krupp-type lower belt that would also have served as one of the torpedo bulkheads, inclined at 10 degrees; this lower belt would taper to 1 inch at the keel. The ends of the armored citadel would be closed by [...] Class <b>A</b> <b>traverse</b> bulkhead front and [...] Class A in the aft. The deck armor would be in three layers, consisting of a laminated [...] STS weather deck, a combined [...] Class B and STS second deck on the centerline, and a [...] splinter deck; the outboard section would have a [...] Class B and STS second deck and a [...] splinter deck. Over the magazines, the splinter deck would be replaced by a [...] STS third deck to protect from spalling.|$|E
50|$|Many {{factors and}} {{properties}} {{are of interest}} when simulating ice. The actual environment that will be simulated is of prime concern. For example, ice pieces flowing then jamming a spring river would be modeled very differently from <b>a</b> ship model <b>traversing</b> <b>a</b> simulated arctic ice sheet. Different again would be <b>a</b> ship <b>traversing</b> <b>an</b> area of loose broken ice pieces or pack ice.|$|R
