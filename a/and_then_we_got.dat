We {{believed}} that it was just a formality, that Eminem just wanted to hear the final mix of the song... <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> a phone call saying {{he was not going to}} give permission for a video. We were devastated [...] I certainly don't have any bad feelings toward Eminem. He was gracious enough to let us use the song on the album—and we use [...] "The Real Slim Shady" [...] in the [...] "Angry White Boy Polka" [...] medley, too. But this is the first album I've ever released without an accompanying video.|$|E
500|$|On May 9, 2007, {{during a}} show in Fort Worth, Texas Chevelle's trailer {{containing}} all of the band's equipment was stolen from the hotel at which the members were staying. The band posted a notice saying, [...] "Most items are labeled 'Chevelle' and if you notice anything suspicious on eBay or other online resellers selling 'authentic' Chevelle items... guitar, basses, drums, amplifiers, risers, backdrops, tee shirts... please call the police..." [...] A month later in an interview, Sam Loeffler stated, [...] "Of the 14 guitars, we got two of 'em, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> some amplifiers back and our monitor system. So it's really, I mean it's cool because it's kind of like Christmas, only really weird. People have been calling us and saying, 'Hey, I bought this or that', and you know, we're just doing our best to buy it back from them. And certainly {{the issue is not}} a money issue, it's about having the pieces of gear that you did all your records with." ...|$|E
500|$|Further {{changes were}} made after the March 2007 preview {{screenings}} of the film in Portland, Oregon and Phoenix, Arizona. This included the deletion of Kang and Kodos heavily criticizing the film during the end credits. A lot {{of people at the}} screenings found the original film too coarse, and some of Homer's behavior too unkind, so several scenes were toned down to make him appear nicer. Russ Cargill was redesigned several times, originally appearing as an older man whose speech patterns Albert Brooks based on Donald Rumsfeld. The older model was the one used by Burger King for the action figure. Cargill's scene with Bart and Homer at the film's conclusion was added in to fully resolve his story, and the [...] "Spider-Pig" [...] gag was also a late addition. One excised scene, before the dome is put over Springfield, had Mr. Burns reminding viewers that it was the last point in the film that they could get a refund. Other deletions included Homer's encounter with a sausage truck driver, which was featured on the DVD, a scene with Plopper the pig at the end, and a news report, showing the dome's effect on daily life in Springfield in areas such as farming and sport, was cut because it did not fit the overall context of the film. Several musical numbers, at various intervals throughout the film, were cut. These included a song about Alaska, featuring music by Dave Stewart of Eurythmics. Jean said it [...] "got pretty far along in the animation, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> scared that the movie began to drag in that section." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gymnastics {{came of age}} in India when, at the 2010 Commonwealth Games, Ashish Kumar won {{the first-ever}} medal in {{gymnastics}} for India and also won a bronze medal. However, soon after the win, the president of the Gymnastics Federation of India, controversially asked Kumar's chief coach from the Soviet Union, Vladimir Chertkov, [...] "Is this all that you can deliver, a bronze?" [...] The comment was widely reported in the press. Later, the coach revealed that, [...] "In August 2009, we had no equipment. Ashish trained on hard floor till February 2010, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> equipment around 20 years old." [...] The federation announced that no Indian team would travel to Rotterdam for the World Championships in October, which would mean that Indian gymnasts would not have the opportunity to qualify as a team for the 2012 Summer Olympics.|$|E

Breault played a kind of tune with his hammer, indicating to the diver that we were in good shape and cheerful. Neither of us knew Morse Code. We [...] had no food or water, and only a flashlight. We were confident we could stay alive for forty-eight hours. The high pressure and foul air gave us severe headaches. We did very little moving or talking; it excited our hearts too much. We heard scraping on the hull for hours. A couple of times we felt the O-5 being lifted, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> tossed roughly when the slings broke. We knew they were hard after us. This buoyed our hopes [...] for rescue tremendously. Finally, the sub began to be tilted upward slowly. We felt we would escape this time, but it seemed like forever. The last 20 minutes were unbearable. We heard our comrades walking on deck. Breault opened the hatch and we could see daylight. [...] We were saved!!! ...|$|E
5000|$|Consideration is {{executory}} when {{a promise}} {{to do something in}} the future is given in exchange for another promise {{to be done in the}} future. Consideration is executed when a promise is actually executed, in exchange for another promise to be executed in the future. Consideration is past when a promise has been given or executed before and independently of the other promise. For example, I promised to take you to lunch, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> there I said [...] "you must pay, because I have given you the benefit of my company". This is past consideration and therefore NO consideration.|$|R

"The {{guy who did}} {{the artwork}} for the first record, Jacob Escobedo, {{came up with that}} concept for the artwork , and in that moment we began talking about retro-futurism: so if you were to {{go back and look at}} the science fiction books {{released}} in the fifties and just how fascinating it is to see what people thought about the future. And for us, that kind of became like a theme. Brian's got all of this ancient gear - synthesisers from the time that synthesisers were being made - and they were incredibly futuristic at that time. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> as <b>we</b> <b>got</b> more into it ... the whole aesthetic started to evolve from there." ...|$|R

Finally I came here as an underdog, 10 points behind and had the nerves to keep calm, I did the job yesterday and today managed to win it also. I’m so happy for my team, so happy for the ABT Schaeffler Audi Sport guys, they really deserve it." [...] He later claimed to have not given up hope in winning the championship despite a competitive field and retiring from the Paris ePrix, but also admitted that focusing on Formula E after Audi's withdrawal from the World Endurance Championship at the end of 2016 aided his title effort. While Buemi admitted his disappointment in losing the championship, he congratulated di Grassi on securing the accolade, and stated him missing the New York City races was not an excuse in his loss. Regarding his pit stop early in the race, Buemi chose not to judge if the stewards made the correct decision and admitted not knowing about the regulation that required him to enter the pit lane because of car damage.|$|E

Ah, life seemed worth living then! One day, I remember, they'd been giving it us awfully hot all the morning, and we'd lost frightfully. At last we rushed their position, and, by Jove, we let 'em have it! How we did hate them! You should have heard the Tommies cursing as they killed!

'O--under, by Gad!' says he. She then began to rap down upon my skull, back, and ribs with the pyle till we'd roll over again. 'Where beest now, dear Joe, under or top?' she'd scream again.

So this record just encompasses everything we’ve done from the beginning to where we are currently as a band; it just kind of connects the dots of all the elements of our sound over the years." [...] "There's some hip-hop, more keyboards than before, sound loops, textures - it's dynamic, diverse and vulnerable. That is Papa Roach. We have never sounded better", said Shaddix.|$|R

40|$|In a sense, {{psychoanalysis}} {{began with}} dreams. The Interpretation of Dreams {{was first published}} in 1900, followed quickly by two books, on jokes and on the psychopathology of everyday life, in which Freud demonstrated how his new theory of the processes of the unconscious mind could be used to explain a great deal of everyone's everyday behaviour. His stress throughout was on the normality and ubiquity of activities like dreaming, forgetting things, making mistakes, telling jokes, and so on, which are rooted in the unconscious mind. We've all got one, and the way it makes us think and behave unites us with those outsiders, those others, young children, primitive peoples and the mentally ill, from whom we spend much of our lives trying to distance ourselves. I often think that much of the hostility to psychoanalysis expressed by academics and public figures stems from its anarchic, banana-skin effect on our wish to be seen as properly grown up, balanced, judicious, full of gravitas; our dreams especially can be wonderfully debunking productions. A patient comes in and tells us that they dreamt that we invited them to tea <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> hadn't <b>got</b> any to offer so they kindly cooked us a hamburger, or that they arrived in a consultingroom which was full of our badly-behaved children and turned into...|$|R
