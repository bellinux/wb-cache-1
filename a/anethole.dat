25|$|DES {{belongs to}} the stilbestrol (4,4'-dihydroxystilbene) group of compounds. It is a nonsteroidal open-ring {{analogue}} of the steroidal estrogen estradiol. DES {{was derived from the}} naturally occurring compound <b>anethole,</b> a weakly estrogenic constituent of anise and fennel. <b>Anethole</b> was demethylated to form anol and anol then spontaneously dimerized into dianol and hexestrol, with DES subsequently being synthesized via structural modification of hexestrol. It has been determined via X-ray crystallography that the molecular dimensions of DES are almost identical to those of estradiol, particularly in regards to the distance between the hydroxyl groups {{at either end of the}} molecules.|$|E
25|$|Fennel {{is widely}} cultivated, both in its native range and elsewhere, for its edible, {{strongly}} flavored leaves and fruits. Its aniseed flavor comes from <b>anethole,</b> an aromatic compound {{also found in}} anise and star anise, and its taste and aroma are similar to theirs, though usually not as strong.|$|E
25|$|The {{scent of}} {{liquorice}} root {{comes from a}} complex and variable combination of compounds, of which <b>anethole</b> is up to 3% of total volatiles. Much of the sweetness in liquorice comes from glycyrrhizin, which has a sweet taste, 30–50 times the sweetness of sugar. The sweetness {{is very different from}} sugar, being less instant, tart, and lasting longer.|$|E
25|$|Toothpaste {{comes in}} a variety of colors, and flavors {{intended}} to encourage use of the product. Three most common flavorants are peppermint, spearmint, and wintergreen. Toothpaste flavored with peppermint-anise oil is popular in the Mediterranean region. These flavors are provided by the respective oils, e.g. peppermint oil. More exotic flavors include <b>Anethole</b> anise, apricot, bubblegum, cinnamon, fennel, lavender, neem, ginger, vanilla, lemon, orange, and pine. Alternatively, unflavored toothpastes exist.|$|E
2500|$|Cicely, or sweet cicely, is {{sometimes}} grown as an herb; like fennel, it contains <b>anethole,</b> so {{has a similar}} aroma, but is lower-growing (up to [...] ) and has large umbels of white flowers and leaves that are fern-like rather than threadlike.|$|E
2500|$|The various basils {{have such}} {{different}} scents because the herb {{has a number}} of different essential oils that come together in different proportions for various breeds. The strong clove scent of sweet basil is derived from eugenol, the same chemical as actual cloves. The citrus scent of lemon basil and lime basil reflects their higher portion of citral, which causes this effect in several plants including lemon mint, and of limonene, which gives actual lemon peel its scent. African blue basil has a strong camphor smell because it contains camphor and camphene in higher proportions. Licorice basil contains <b>anethole,</b> the same chemical that makes anise smell like licorice, and in fact is sometimes called [...] "anise basil." ...|$|E
2500|$|Arak {{is usually}} mixed in {{proportions}} of approximately one third arak and two thirds {{water in a}} traditional Eastern Mediterranean water vessel called Abarik, Arabic abarīq then the mixture is poured into small, ice-filled cups. This dilution causes the clear liquor to turn a translucent milky-white color; this is because <b>anethole,</b> the essential oil of anise, is soluble in alcohol but not in water. This results in an emulsion, whose fine droplets scatter the light and turn the liquid translucent, a phenomenon known as louching. Arak is commonly served with mezza, which may [...] include dozens of small traditional dishes. In general, arak drinkers prefer to consume it this way, rather than alone. It is also consumed with barbecues, along with garlic sauce.|$|E
2500|$|Absinthe that is artificially {{coloured}} or {{clear is}} aesthetically stable, {{and can be}} bottled in clear glass. If naturally coloured absinthe is exposed to light or air for a prolonged period, the chlorophyll gradually becomes oxidised, which {{has the effect of}} gradually changing the colour from green to yellow green, and eventually to brown. The colour of absinthe that has completed this transition was historically referred to as feuille morte (dead leaf). In the preban era, this natural phenomenon was favourably viewed, for it confirmed the product in question was coloured naturally, and not artificially with potentially toxic chemicals. Predictably, vintage absinthes often emerge from sealed bottles as distinctly amber in tint due to decades of slow oxidation. [...] Though this colour change presents no adverse impact to the flavour of absinthe, it is generally desired to preserve the original colour, which requires that naturally coloured absinthe be bottled in dark, light resistant bottles. Absinthe intended for decades of storage should be kept in a cool (room temperature), dry place, away from light and heat. Absinthe should not be stored in the refrigerator or freezer, as the <b>anethole</b> may polymerise inside the bottle, creating an irreversible precipitate, and adversely impacting the original flavour.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anethole</b> is {{also present}} in absinthe, a liquor with a {{reputation}} for psychoactive effects; these effects, however, are attributed to ethanol. (See also thujone, <b>anethole</b> dithione (ADT), and <b>anethole</b> trithione (ATT)).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Anethole</b> is an {{inexpensive}} chemical precursor for paramethoxyamphetamine (PMA), {{and is used}} in its clandestine manufacture. [...] <b>Anethole</b> {{is present in the}} essential oil from guarana, which is alleged to have a psychoactive effect. The absence of PMA or any other known psychoactive derivative of <b>anethole</b> in human urine after ingestion of guarana leads to the conclusion that any purported psychoactive effect of guarana is not due to aminated <b>anethole</b> metabolites.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Anethole</b> {{also is a}} {{promising}} insecticide. Several essential oils consisting mostly of <b>anethole</b> have insecticidal action against larvae of the mosquitos Ochlerotatus caspius and Aedes aegypti. [...] In a similar manner, <b>anethole</b> itself is effective against the fungus gnat Lycoriella ingenua (Sciaridae) and the mold mite Tyrophagus putrescentiae. [...] Against the mite, <b>anethole</b> is a slightly more effective pesticide than DEET, but anisaldehyde, a related natural compound that occurs with <b>anethole</b> in many essential oils, is 14 times more effective. [...] The insecticidal action of <b>anethole</b> is greater as a fumigant than as a contact agent. (E)-anethole is highly effective as a fumigant against the cockroach Blattella germanica and against adults of the weevils Sitophilus oryzae, Callosobruchus chinensis and beetle Lasioderma serricorne.|$|E
5000|$|Most <b>anethole</b> is {{obtained}} from terpentine-like extracts from trees. [...] Of only minor commercial significance, <b>anethole</b> {{can also be}} isolated from essential oils.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Anethole</b> is {{responsible}} for the [...] "ouzo effect", the spontaneous formation of a microemulsion that gives many alcoholic beverages containing <b>anethole</b> and water their cloudy appearance. Such a spontaneous microemulsion has many potential commercial applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries.|$|E
5000|$|Formerly {{generally}} recognized as safe (GRAS), after a hiatus <b>anethole</b> was reaffirmed by Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association (FEMA) as GRAS. [...] The hiatus {{was due to}} concerns about liver toxicity and possible carcinogenic activity, reported in rats. [...] <b>Anethole</b> is associated with a slight increase in liver cancer in rats, although the evidence is scant and generally regarded as evidence that <b>anethole</b> is not a carcinogen. [...] An evaluation of <b>anethole</b> by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) found its notable pharmacologic properties to be reduction in motor activity, lowering of body temperature, and hypnotic, analgesic, and anticonvulsant effects. [...] A subsequent evaluation by JECFA found some reason for concern regarding carcinogenicity, but there is currently insufficient data to support this. [...] At this time, the JECFA summary of these evaluations is that <b>anethole</b> has no safety concern at current levels of intake when used as a flavoring agent.|$|E
50|$|Because they metabolize <b>anethole</b> {{into several}} {{aromatic}} chemical compounds, some bacteria are candidates {{for use in}} commercial bioconversion of <b>anethole</b> to more valuable materials. Bacterial strains capable of using trans-anethole as the sole carbon source include JYR-1 (Pseudomonas putida) and TA13 (Arthrobacter aurescens).|$|E
50|$|Fennel, which {{contains}} <b>anethole,</b> {{has been found}} to have a galactogogue effect in animals. <b>Anethole</b> bears a structural resemblance to catecholamines like dopamine and may displace dopamine from its receptors and thereby disinhibit prolactin secretion, which in turn may be responsible for the galactogogue effects.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Anethole</b> has potent {{antimicrobial}} properties, against bacteria, yeast, and fungi. [...] Reported {{antibacterial properties}} include both bacteriostatic and bactericidal action against Salmonella enterica {{but not when}} used against Salmonella via a fumigation method. [...] Antifungal activity includes increasing the effectiveness of some other phytochemicals (e.g. polygodial) against Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans; In vitro, <b>anethole</b> has antihelmintic action on eggs and larvae of the sheep gastrointestinal nematode Haemonchus contortus. [...] <b>Anethole</b> also has nematicidal activity against the plant nematode Meloidogyne javanica in vitro and in pots of cucumber seedlings.|$|E
50|$|It is {{generally}} {{obtained by the}} oxidation of <b>anethole</b> or p-methoxyacetophenone.|$|E
5000|$|In large quantities, <b>anethole</b> is {{slightly}} toxic and may {{act as an}} irritant.|$|E
50|$|Biosynthesis of the {{compound}} is hypothesized to proceed via a NIH shift of <b>anethole.</b>|$|E
50|$|As well as {{an insect}} pesticide, <b>anethole</b> is an {{effective}} insect repellent against mosquitos.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anethole</b> has estrogenic activity. It {{has been}} found to {{significantly}} increase uterine weight in immature female rats.|$|E
50|$|The {{essential}} oil of S. anisatum contains <b>anethole</b> and methyl chavicol, imparting licorice and aniseed flavours respectively.|$|E
50|$|Anisole is a {{precursor}} to perfumes, insect pheromones, and pharmaceuticals. For example, synthetic <b>anethole</b> is prepared from anisole.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Anethole</b> (anise camphor) is {{an organic}} {{compound}} that {{is widely used}} as a flavoring substance. It is a derivative of phenylpropene, a type of aromatic compound that occurs widely in nature, in essential oils. It contributes a large component of the odor and flavor of anise and fennel (both in the botanical family Apiaceae), anise myrtle (Myrtaceae), liquorice (Fabaceae), camphor, magnolia blossoms, and star anise (Illiciaceae). Closely related to <b>anethole</b> is its isomer estragole, abundant in tarragon (Asteraceae) and basil (Lamiaceae), that has a flavor reminiscent of anise. It is a colorless, fragrant, mildly volatile liquid. <b>Anethole</b> is only slightly soluble in water but exhibits high solubility in ethanol. This difference causes certain anise-flavored liqueurs to become opaque when diluted with water, the ouzo effect.|$|E
5000|$|Like related compounds, <b>anethole</b> {{is poorly}} soluble in water. Historically, this {{property}} {{was used to}} detect adulteration in samples.|$|E
50|$|Dianethole is a {{naturally}} occurring organic compound that {{is found in}} anise and fennel. It is a dimeric polymer of <b>anethole.</b> It has estrogenic activity, and along with <b>anethole</b> and photoanethole, {{may be responsible for}} the estrogenic effects of anise and fennel. These compounds bear resemblance to the estrogens stilbene and diethylstilbestrol, which may explain their estrogenic activity. In fact, it is said that diethylstilbestrol and related drugs were originally modeled after dianethole and photoanethole.|$|E
50|$|PMA {{has been}} found in tablets touted as MDMA (ecstasy) {{although}} its effects are markedly different compared to those of MDMA. The consequences of such deception have often included hospitalization and death for unwitting users. PMA is commonly synthesized from <b>anethole,</b> the flavor compound of anise and fennel, mainly because the starting material for MDMA, safrole, has become less available due to law enforcement action, causing illicit drug manufacturers to use <b>anethole</b> as an alternative.|$|E
50|$|Tobacco also {{contains}} the following phytochemicals: glucosides (tabacinine, tabacine), 2,3,6-trimethyl-1,4-naphthoquinone, 2-methylquinone, 2-napthylamine, propionic acid, anthalin, <b>anethole,</b> acrolein, cembrene, choline, nicotelline, nicotianine, and pyrene.|$|E
5000|$|Like its {{relatives}} anise, fennel, and caraway, it {{can also}} be used to flavour akvavit. [...] Its essential oils are dominated by <b>anethole.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} reactants {{employed by}} Dutch chemist Hendrik Jacobus Prins in his 1919 publication were styrene (scheme 2), pinene, camphene, eugenol, isosafrole and <b>anethole.</b>|$|E
50|$|Sambuca may {{be served}} neat. It {{may also be}} served on the rocks or with water, {{resulting}} in the ouzo effect from the <b>anethole</b> in the anise.|$|E
5000|$|I. The {{discovery}} and invention {{of new products}} (amyl and allyl alcohols, toluene, xylene, aliphatic hydrocarbons, cuminic and anisic acids, <b>anethole,</b> halogenated and nitrated derivatives, piperidine, vitelline, organometallic compounds) ...|$|E
50|$|Arthrobacter aurescens is a {{bacterium}} species from the genus of Arthrobacter. Arthrobacter aurescens produces nitrilase and L-N-carbamoylase. Arthrobacter aurescens {{has a low}} GC-content and {{has the ability to}} utilize <b>anethole.</b>|$|E
50|$|Estragole {{is used in}} {{perfumes}} and as a food additive for flavor. Upon {{treatment with}} potassium hydroxide, estragole converts to <b>anethole.</b> A known use of estragole is in the synthesis of magnolol.|$|E
