40|$|Acute Q {{fever and}} scrub typhus are zoonoses endemic to {{southern}} Taiwan. Among the 137 patients with acute Q fever (89, 65. 0 %) or scrub typhus (43, 31. 4 %), we identified 5 patients (3. 6 %) who were co-infected with Coxiella burnetii and Orientia tsutsugamushi. fever is a worldwide zoonosis in humans caused by Q Coxiella burnetii infection. Ticks {{are the main}} arthropod vectors of C. burnetii; the major <b>animal</b> <b>reservoirs</b> include goats, sheep, cattle, and domestic cats. Humans are infected mainly by inhaling organism-contaminated aerosols (1). Scrub typhus, caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi infection, is endemic to eastern Asia and the western Pacific region. O. tsutsugamushi is transmitted vertically in mites (particularly Leptotrombidium species) by the transovarial route, and horizontally in rodents through trombiculid larval (chigger) bites. Humans contract scrub typhus by being bitten by chiggers infected with O. tsutsugamushi; such bites occur accidentally during agriculture or field recreational activities (2). Although the major arthropod vectors, <b>animal</b> <b>reservoirs,</b> and routes of transmission to humans are different for C. burnetii and O. tsutsugamushi, co-infection may occur when humans {{have been exposed to}} an environment where arthropod vectors and <b>animal</b> <b>reservoirs</b> are prevalent.

5000|$|Because {{influenza}} virus A has an <b>animal</b> <b>reservoir</b> that contains all the known subtypes {{and it can}} undergo antigenic shift, this type of {{influenza virus}} is capable of producing pandemics.

[...] Influenza virus C does not have this capability and it is not thought to be a significant concern for human health. Therefore, there are no vaccinations against influenza virus C.|$|E
50|$|The main {{route of}} {{infection}} is inhalation of airborne spores through the respiratory pathway. This can occur in both healthy and immunocompromised individuals however a disseminated infection {{is more common in}} the latter. After inhalation the conidia switch to their adiaspore state, triggered by the temperature increase within the body. These develop without replicating in the alveoli of the lung. Transmission can originate directly from the soil or through an <b>animal</b> <b>reservoir</b> such as mice or bats.|$|E
50|$|Conclusively {{stating that}} Blastocystis has an <b>animal</b> <b>reservoir</b> depends upon {{unraveling}} {{the true nature}} of its transmission. If, as Noël et al. deem likely based upon their own molecular work and a review of the literature, animal-to-human transmission is possible, then animals such as pigs and dogs could in fact be acting as a large reservoir capable of human infection. Epidemiological studies finding that infection is more common in people living in proximity to farm animals or pets further supports this notion.|$|E
40|$|Background The aim of {{this study}} is to {{describe}} the major evolutionary historical events among Leishmania, sandflies, and the associated <b>animal</b> <b>reservoirs</b> in detail, in accordance with the geographical evolution of the Earth, which has not been previously discussed on a large scale. Methodology and Principal Findings Leishmania and sandfly classification has always been a controversial matter, and the increasing number of species currently described further complicates this issue. Despite several hypotheses on the origin, evolution, and distribution of Leishmania and sandflies in the Old and New World, no consistent agreement exists regarding dissemination of the actors that play roles in leishmaniasis. For this purpose, we present here three centuries of research on sandflies and Leishmania descriptions, as well as a complete description of Leishmania and sandfly fossils and the emergence date of each Leishmania and sandfly group during different geographical periods, from 550 million years ago until now. We discuss critically the different approaches that were used for Leishmana and sandfly classification and their synonymies, proposing an updated classification for each species of Leishmania and sandfly. We update information on the current distribution and dispersion of different species of Leishmania (53), sandflies (more than 800 at genus or subgenus level), and <b>animal</b> <b>reservoirs</b> in each of the following geographical ecozones: Palearctic, Nearctic, Neotropic, Afrotropical, Oriental, Malagasy, and Australian. We propose an updated list of the potential and proven sandfly vectors for each Leishmania species in the Old and New World. Finally, we address a classical question about digenetic Leishmania evolution: which was the first host, a vertebrate or an invertebrate? Conclusions and Significance We propose an updated view of events that have played important roles in the geographical dispersion of sandflies, in relation to both the Leishmania species they transmit and the <b>animal</b> <b>reservoirs</b> of the parasites...|$|R
