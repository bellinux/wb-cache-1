500|$|Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s was {{released}} to generally lukewarm reviews and has received overall less praise {{than the first}} two games in the series. Most critics agreed that the game's $49.99 price point was too high, considering the reduced soundtrack. GameSpot criticized the amount of songs with regard to the game's price. The reviewer commented that [...] "thirty songs for $50 is a lousy value <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> slice it" [...] and the game [...] "feels like a quick and dirty cash-in." [...] The reviewer also commented that the soundtrack was [...] "eclectic," [...] but [...] "solid." [...] Other reviewers, including 1UP.com, IGN, and Electronic Gaming Monthly criticized the game for its musical selection. GameSetWatch compared the game to Lou Reed's Metal Machine Music, saying that the game is [...] "totally Harmonix's contractual obligation game" [...] due to the bare minimum of changes made from Guitar Hero II.|$|E

2500|$|Blake’s {{internally}} braced hollow wooden surfboards {{were eventually}} superseded by laminated boards with an interior layer of balsa, then by foam-and-fiberglass designs, but {{another of his}} innovations remains a fixture of modern surf- and paddleboards, the [...] "skeg" [...] or fin. Traditional surfboards were flat-bottomed, but in 1935, Blake experimented by tearing the keel off an old speedboat and attaching it {{to the bottom of}} a surfboard. Blake later remembered, [...] "I finally put the fin on the board and went out in the surf, paddled out. In paddling out, the board had an entirely different feeling with the skeg on it, it wasn't entirely a likable feeling... But I got a pretty good wave and right away found the remarkable control you had over the board with the skeg on it. It didn't spin out, it steered easy, because the tail held steady when you put the pressure on the front. You could [...] turn it <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> wanted it.

It reached No.12 on Go-Sets National Top40 and No.8 on the Kent Music Report. The B-side was a Ted Mulry ( [...] Martin Mulry) {{composition}} [...] "Take Me Back". Also that month she released her debut solo album, Fresh Water, a reference to her former band. It was produced by United Kingdom producer Simon Napier-Bell, {{who had worked with}} The Yardbirds and T.Rex. John Tait described Napier-Bell's work as re-invigorating Vanda & Young's songwriting career [...] "Ted Albert assigned him the task of finding artists to record some of the songs Harry and George were sending over from London. The most notable of these demos was a rock tune called 'Superman' ... matched the song up with the soaring voice of session singer Alison MacCallum, added some brass to the original arrangement and suddenly they had a hit on their hands". Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, noted Fresh Waters [...] "mix of rock, jazz and blues material proved to be a fine showcase for her expressive voice".

[...] Robert Bianco of USA Today commented: [...] "Driven by violence and rage, Galactica is perhaps the darkest space opera American TV has ever produced. In Galacticas future, humans are on the run, and if external enemies don't get us, internal divisions will... You'll understand them , their conflicts and their desires, because they're recognizable humans in all their glorious complexity. And that's what makes Galactica a great TV series." [...] Peter Suderman of National Review stated that the series is [...] "arguably the most potent, dramatically vibrant series on television. ...t packs {{the power of a}} gut punch on screen. For that, much credit is due to the immensely compelling cast of characters... Battlestar Galactica burns with a combustive mixture of political turmoil and human drama that is as achingly real and relevant as anything on television. Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the show [...] "has distinguished itself as one of television's very best dramas — on a par with 24, The Wire, and Lost — because it so utterly transcends both its genre and its source material. ... series' sophisticated stories have also attracted a distinctively new breed of fan, one who's not necessarily a sci-fi buff." [...] Moreover, in 2012, Entertainment Weekly listed the show at #7 in the [...] "25 Best Cult TV Shows from the Past 25 Years," [...] saying that producer Moore [...] "expanded the show's central premise into an addictive post-9/11 parable {{and one of the most}} critically acclaimed series of the decade."

Additionally, Rob Sheffield ranked the song at number 3 on his list of The Top 25 Songs of 2011 writing, [...] "The harder she tries to come on crazy, the less crazy she sounds.
