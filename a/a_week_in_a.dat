5|$|Groucho Marx played Waldorf T. Beagle (later renamed Waldorf T. Flywheel), and Chico played Emmanuel Ravelli, {{the same}} name as the Italian {{character}} {{he played in the}} film Animal Crackers (1930). Mary McCoy played secretary Miss Dimple, and it is thought that Broderick Crawford also appeared as various characters. Groucho and Chico shared a weekly income of $6,500 for appearing in the show. During the Great Depression, this was considered a high sum for 30 minutes' work, especially since radio scripts required no memorization and only a few minutes were needed for costume, hair and makeup. By comparison, Greta Garbo's weekly salary from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer during the same period was also $6,500, though this was for a 40- or 50-hour week. Wynn was paid $5,000 a week for Fire Chief. In contrast, almost two-thirds of American families were living on fewer than $26 <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> classic Marxian twist, Harpo was paid a weekly salary for not appearing on the show, even though his mute character would have little to do in a radio program anyway.|$|E
5|$|The 1904 {{season was}} Bosanquet's best with bat and ball. Although {{he made a}} slow start batting, failing to reach double figures in six of his first nine innings, he was {{immediately}} successful with the ball. He took nine for 107 for MCC against the touring South African team and seven for 83 for I Zingari against Gentlemen of England, going on to take 11 wickets in the latter match. Then for Middlesex, he scored 110 in 85 minutes with 16 fours, in a tied match against the South Africans, and 126 in two hours against Surrey including a five and 16 fours. In the latter match he also took five for 139. This preceded his selection for two Gentlemen v Players matches in six days. In the first at Lord's, he scored nine and 22 and took four wickets in the match. At the Oval, he hit 145 in 210 minutes with two fives and 15 fours. After taking two for 97 in the Players' first innings, he took six for 60 in the second to give the Gentlemen their second victory in <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> loss to Lancashire, the eventual 1904 County Championship winners, Bosanquet took six for 99 for Middlesex and in a drawn game against Yorkshire, who {{finished second in the}} table, he scored 141 and took 10 for 248. Immediately following the Yorkshire game, Bosanquet took 12 for 240 in a defeat of Nottinghamshire. After a quiet time in the return game against Lancashire, Bosanquet had a run of three consecutive successful matches. In the first, he took six for 75 against Surrey. In a close victory over Kent, he took five for 23 and eight wickets in the match after scoring 80 runs, and he achieved figures of 14 for 190 in a win against Sussex. In an end of season festival game, Bosanquet took five for 89 for the South against the North. In all first-class matches, Bosanquet achieved the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets: he scored 1,405 runs at an average of 36.02 and took 132 wickets at an average of 21.62, the only time in his career he passed 100 wickets in a season. He accumulated five fifties and four centuries; with the ball he took 10 or more wickets in four matches and had 14 five wicket hauls.|$|E

25|$|The {{match between}} fellow strugglers Derbyshire and Surrey {{ended in a}} high-scoring draw, while Nottinghamshire fell four wickets short of {{defeating}} early title contenders Sussex. The 2010 champions drew a second game in <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> high-scoring encounter against Yorkshire. Draws also resulted in the contests between Middlesex and Sussex, Surrey and Warwickshire, and Somerset and Durham. Yorkshire defeated Middlesex by ten wickets, their first win at Lord's for 26 years. On the same day, Durham completed a narrow victory over Warwickshire, placing them back in title contention. Sussex, while remaining unbeaten, could only manage a draw with Surrey. The contest between Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire also ended in a high-scoring draw. Somerset achieved their first win of the season away at fellow relegation candidates Derbyshire, while Surrey managed a fourth successive draw, this time against title contenders Yorkshire. A draw for Sussex against Nottinghamshire was enough to give them {{second place in the}} table, eight points behind Yorkshire, and 8.5 ahead of Durham, at the halfway stage of the season.|$|E

The far-off North Pole was not mentioned as an option; the choice lay between two depots of food and ammunition laid down for their safety, one at Cape Flora in Franz Josef Land and one at Sjuøyane (Seven Islands) in Svalbard (see map). Inferring from their faulty maps that the distances to each were about equal, they decided to try for the bigger depot at Cape Flora. Strindberg took more pictures during this week than he would at any later point, including 12 frames that make up a 360-degree panorama of the crash site.|$|E
500|$|The {{handover}} on {{the first}} day was so tight that builders moved out at midday, and the first service was run at 7pm that evening. The late opening resulted in the reviewers for the Michelin Guide having only a two-week window in which to re-assess the restaurant for the 2008 guide. Bosi admitted later that the restaurant was not yet up to scratch in those two weeks and agreed with the decision of Michelin to downgrade Hibiscus to a single star in the 2008 Guide. The restaurant was also given a [...] "rising star" [...] as one with potential to go up to two stars in the future.

With support from personal mentor JP Bowersock and producer Gordon Raphael, the band recorded three tracks which later appeared on Is This It: [...] "The Modern Age", [...] "Last Nite", and [...] "Barely Legal". British label Rough Trade Records was impressed by the songs and released them as a January 2001 extended play titled The Modern Age. Music press reaction was very positive and the Strokes embarked on a sold-out UK tour, followed by US support slots for alternative rock groups Doves and Guided by Voices. Gentles quit his job to manage the band full-time and, in March 2001, the Strokes signed to RCA Records after a protracted bidding war.|$|E
