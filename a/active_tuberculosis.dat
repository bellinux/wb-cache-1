5|$|Progression from TB {{infection}} to overt TB disease {{occurs when}} the bacilli overcome the immune system defenses and begin to multiply. In primary TB disease (some 1–5% of cases), this occurs soon after the initial infection. However, {{in the majority of}} cases, a latent infection occurs with no obvious symptoms. These dormant bacilli produce <b>active</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> in 5–10% of these latent cases, often many years after infection.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosing <b>active</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> {{based only}} on signs and {{symptoms}} is difficult, as is diagnosing the disease in those who are immunosuppressed. A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks. A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation. Interferon-γ release assays and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in the developing world. Interferon gamma release assays (IGRA) have similar limitations in those with HIV.|$|E
5|$|The Mantoux {{tuberculin}} {{skin test}} {{is often used}} to screen people at high risk for TB. Those who have been previously immunized may have a false-positive test result. The test may be falsely negative in those with sarcoidosis, Hodgkin's lymphoma, malnutrition, and most notably, <b>active</b> <b>tuberculosis.</b> Interferon gamma release assays, on a blood sample, are recommended in those who are positive to the Mantoux test. These are not affected by immunization or most environmental mycobacteria, so they generate fewer false-positive results. However, they are affected by M. szulgai, M. marinum, and M. kansasii. IGRAs may increase sensitivity when used in addition to the skin test, but may be less sensitive than the skin test when used alone.|$|E

40|$|Routine chest {{radiography}} {{of the mothers}} of 163 children investigated for possible tuberculosis accompanied by sputum culture from those mothers with suspicious chest radiographs identified <b>active</b> pulmonary <b>tuberculosis</b> in 12 (10 per cent) of the mothers of the 117 children with probable (49 cases) and confirmed (68 cases) tuberculosis. All {{but one of the}} cases of <b>active</b> maternal <b>tuberculosis</b> were identified in the mothers of children < 1 J years of age.

40|$|Emerging {{evidence}} shows that microRNAs (miRNAs) {{play an important role}} in pathogen-host interactions. Circulating miRNAs have been repeatedly and stably detected in blood and hold promise to serve as molecular markers for diverse physiological and pathological conditions. To date, the relationship between circulating miRNAs and <b>active</b> pulmonary <b>tuberculosis</b> (TB) has not been reported. Using microarray-based expression profiling followed by real-time quantitative PCR validation, the levels of circulating miRNAs were compared between patients with <b>active</b> pulmonary <b>tuberculosis</b> and matched healthy controls. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic effect of selected miRNA. Bioinformatic analysis was used to explore the potential roles of these circulating miRNAs in <b>active</b> pulmonary <b>tuberculosis</b> infection. Among 92 miRNAs significantly detected, 59 miRNAs were downregulated and 33 miRNAs were upregulated in the TB serum compared to their levels in the control serum. Interestingly, only two differentially expressed miRNAs were increased not only in the serum but also in the sputum of patients with <b>active</b> pulmonary <b>tuberculosis</b> compared to the levels for the healthy controls. Upregulated miR- 29 a could discriminate TB patients from healthy controls with reasonable sensitivity and specificity. A number of significantly enriched pathways regulated by these circulating miRNAs were predicted, and most of them were involved in acute-phase response, inflammatory response, and the regulation of the cytoskeleton. In all, for the first time our results revealed that a number of miRNAs were differentially expressed during <b>active</b> pulmonary <b>tuberculosis</b> infection, and circulating miR- 29 a has great potential to serve as a marker for the detection of <b>active</b> pulmonary <b>tuberculosis</b> infection...|$|R
5|$|Measures {{to prevent}} {{opportunistic}} infections {{are effective in}} many people with HIV/AIDS. In addition to improving current disease, treatment with antiretrovirals {{reduces the risk of}} developing additional opportunistic infections. Adults and adolescents who are living with HIV (even on anti-retroviral therapy) with no evidence of <b>active</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> in settings with high tuberculosis burden should receive isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT), the tuberculin skin test can be used to help decide if IPT is needed. Vaccination against hepatitis A and B is advised for all people at risk of HIV before they become infected; however it may also be given after infection. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis between four and six weeks of age and ceasing breastfeeding in infants born to HIV positive mothers is recommended in resource limited settings. It is also recommended to prevent PCP when a person's CD4 count is below 200cells/uL and in those who have or have previously had PCP. People with substantial immunosuppression are also advised to receive prophylactic therapy for toxoplasmosis and MAC. Appropriate preventive measures have reduced the rate of these infections by 50% between 1992 and 1997. Influenza vaccination and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine are often recommended in people with HIV/AIDS with some evidence of benefit.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: It is {{estimated}} that over two billion individuals are infected by Mycobacterium tuberculosis worldwide. Interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) is an important cytokine whose serum levels are commonly high in <b>active</b> pulmonary <b>tuberculosis</b> (TB). IL- 6 screening in contacts of patients with TB {{may be useful to}} monitor the progress of the infectious process and to infer the risk of progression to active disease. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the serum levels of interleukin- 6 in contacts of patients with <b>active</b> pulmonary <b>tuberculosis</b> and to compare them with two other groups: a) patients affected by active pulmonary tuberculosis; b) non-contacts of tuberculosis. METHODS: Cross-sectional study with 15 contacts of patients with <b>active</b> pulmonary <b>tuberculosis,</b> selected according to the protocol recommended by the Ministry of Health. The serum levels of interleukin- 6 were measured by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The same test was also applied in the two comparison groups: 38 patients with <b>active</b> pulmonary <b>tuberculosis</b> (confirmed by clinical examination, X-rays of the chest and baciloscopy) and 63 non-contacts (healthy blood donors). RESULTS: In the contact group, the median IL- 6 concentration was 1. 7 pg/ml (0. 96 - 4. 8 pg/ml). For those affected by <b>active</b> pulmonary <b>tuberculosis</b> and non-contact individuals, these values corresponded to 4. 3 pg/ml (0. 5 - 24 pg/ml) and 0. 5 pg/ml (0 - 2. 8 pg/ml), respectively (p < 0. 0001). CONCLUSION: Contacts of patients with <b>active</b> pulmonary <b>tuberculosis</b> had significantly higher IL- 6 serum levels (3. 4 times higher) in relation to non-contact individuals, but on a lower level (2. 5 times lower) when compared to those affected by active disease...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Although chest radiographs usually provide {{adequate}} {{information for the}} diagnosis of <b>active</b> pulmonary <b>tuberculosis,</b> minimal exudative tuberculosis can be overlooked on standard chest radiographs. The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess the findings of <b>active</b> pulmonary <b>tuberculosis</b> on high resolution computed tomographic (HRCT) scans, and to evaluate their possible use in determining disease activity. METHODS: Thirty two patients with newly diagnosed <b>active</b> pulmonary <b>tuberculosis</b> and 34 patients with inactive pulmonary tuberculosis were examined. The diagnosis of <b>active</b> pulmonary <b>tuberculosis</b> was based on positive acid fast bacilli in sputum and bronchial washing smears or cultures and/or changes on serial radiographs obtained during treatment. RESULTS: With HRCT scanning centrilobular lesions (n = 29), "tree-in-bud" appearance (n = 23), and macronodules 5 - 8 mm in diameter (n = 22) were most commonly seen in cases of <b>active</b> pulmonary <b>tuberculosis.</b> HRCT scans showed fibrotic lesions (n = 34), distortion of bronchovascular structures (n = 32), emphysema (n = 28), and bronchiectasis (n = 24) in patients with inactive tuberculosis. CONCLUSIONS: Centrilobular densities in and around the small airways and "tree-in-bud" appearances were the most characteristic CT features of disease activity. HRCT scanning clearly differentiated old fibrotic lesions from new active lesions and demonstrated early bronchogenic spread. These findings may be of value in decisions on treatment...|$|R

The test had a sensitivity of 88 % in patients with sputum-smear-positive <b>active</b> pulmonary <b>tuberculosis.</b> The sensitivity in patients with <b>active</b> pulmonary <b>tuberculosis</b> negative for acid-fast bacilli in sputum was 67 %. Less favorable results were obtained for patients with AIDS and tuberculosis, with a sensitivity of 57 %. The specificity in control patients with lung diseases different from tuberculosis and in healthy subjects was 100 %. The positive predictive value was 100 %, and the negative predictive value for patients with sputum-positive <b>active</b> pulmonary <b>tuberculosis</b> was 97 %. The {{results of this study suggest}} that the detection of lipoarabinomannan is an accurate test for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis...|$|R

2500|$|Malnutrition {{increases}} the risk of infection and infectious disease, and moderate malnutrition weakens every part of the immune system.

Malnutrition affects HIV transmission by increasing the risk of transmission from mother to child and also increasing replication of the virus. In communities or areas that lack access to safe drinking water, these additional health risks present a critical problem. Lower energy and impaired function of the brain also represent the downward spiral of malnutrition as victims are less able to perform the tasks they need to in order to acquire food, earn an income, or gain an education.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe protein {{composition}} of sputum most faithfully reflects {{the state of}} the lungs. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether relative qualitative and quantitative differences in protein expression of sputum could be related to <b>active</b> pulmonary <b>tuberculosis.</b> Sputum samples were collected from 65 patients with <b>active</b> pulmonary <b>tuberculosis</b> and 38 healthy controls. Comprehensive proteomic approaches were used to profile the proteome changes of host sputum in response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection using two-dimensional electrophoresis in combination with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Mascot software was used to identify proteins from protein databases. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to confirm the proteomic results. A total of 62 differentially expressed proteins were identified, among which, 15 proteins were up-regulated and 47 proteins were down-regulated in the tuberculosis sputum compared with the controls. Bacterial protein UqhC was the most increased protein, whereas serum albumin was the most decreased protein in the tuberculosis sputum compared with the controls. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis was consistent with proteomic data. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that multiple host cell pathways were involved in the tuberculosis infection processes, including acute phase response, signal transduction, cytoskeleton structure, immune response and so on. In all, for the first time, our results revealed that a number of proteins were differentially expressed during <b>active</b> pulmonary <b>tuberculosis</b> infection. These data will provide valuable clues for further investigation of tuberculosis pathogenesis and biomarkers for detection of <b>active</b> pulmonary <b>tuberculosis</b> infection...|$|R
40|$|Role of microRNA (miRNA) {{has been}} {{highlighted}} in pathogen-host interactions recently. At present, {{their role in}} <b>active</b> pulmonary <b>tuberculosis</b> is unknown.

Overexpression of miR- 3179, miR- 147 and underexpression of miR- 19 b- 2 * in TB group compared with controls were confirmed in the validation cohort. TNF-α and IL- 6 levels were not significantly altered between TB group and controls.
