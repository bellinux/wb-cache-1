40|$|This {{contribution}} {{explores the}} relationship between research and learning democracy. Action research is seen as being compatible with the orientation of educational and social work research towards social justice and democracy. Nevertheless, the history of action research {{is characterized by a}} tension between democracy and social engineering. In the social-engineering <b>approach,</b> <b>action</b> research is conceptualized as a process of innovation aimed at a specific Bildungsideal. In a democratic <b>approach</b> <b>action</b> research is seen as research based on cooperation between research and practice. However, the notion of democratic action research as opposed to social engineering action research needs to be theorized. So called democratic action research involving the implementation by the researcher of democracy as a model and as a preset goal, reduces cooperation and participation into instruments to reach this goal, and becomes a type of social engineering in itself. We argue that {{the relationship between}} action research and democracy is in the acknowledgment of the political dimension of participation: ‘a democratic relationship in which both sides exercise power and shared control over decision-making as well as interpretation’. This implies an open research design and methodology able to understand democracy as a learning process and an ongoing experiment...|$|E

40|$|SummaryMany GABAergic interneurons are {{electrically}} coupled and in vitro {{can display}} correlated activity with millisecond precision. However, the mechanisms underlying correlated activity between interneurons in vivo are unknown. Using dual patch-clamp recordings in vivo, we reveal {{that in the}} presence of spontaneous background synaptic activity, electrically coupled cerebellar Golgi cells exhibit robust millisecond precision-correlated activity which is enhanced by sensory stimulation. This precisely correlated activity results from the cooperative action of two mechanisms. First, electrical coupling ensures slow subthreshold membrane potential correlations by equalizing membrane potential fluctuations, such that coupled neurons tend to <b>approach</b> <b>action</b> potential threshold together. Second, fast spike-triggered spikelets transmitted through gap junctions conditionally trigger postjunctional spikes, depending on both neurons being close to threshold. Electrical coupling therefore controls the temporal precision and degree of both spontaneous and sensory-evoked correlated activity between interneurons, by the cooperative effects of shared synaptic depolarization and spikelet transmission...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This {{contribution}} {{describes a}} Virtual Reality (VR) based method for char-acter animation that extends conventional motion capture by not only tracking an actor’s movements {{but also his}} or her interactions with the objects of a virtual en-vironment. Rather than merely replaying the actor’s movements, {{the idea is that}} virtual characters learn to imitate the actor’s goal-directed behavior while interact-ing with the virtual scene. Following Arbib’s equation action = movement + goal we call this <b>approach</b> <b>Action</b> Capture. For this, the VR user’s body movements are analyzed and transformed into a multi-layered action representation. Behavioral ani-mation techniques are then applied to synthesize animations which closely resemble the demonstrated action sequences. As an advantage, captured actions can often be naturally applied to virtual characters of different sizes and body proportions, thus avoiding retargetting problems of motion capture.

Existing approaches mainly rely on either bag-of-feature representations or articulated body-part models. However, {{the relationship between the}} action and the image segments is still substantially unexplored. For this reason, in this paper we propose to <b>approach</b> <b>action</b> recognition by leveraging an intermediate layer of "superpixels" whose latent classes can act as attributes of the action. In the proposed approach, the action class is predicted by a structural model(learnt by Latent Structural SVM) based on measurements from the image superpixels and their latent classes. Experimental results over the challenging Stanford 40 Actions dataset report a significant average accuracy of 74. 06 % for the positive class and 88. 50 % for the negative class, giving evidence to the performance of the proposed approach.

40|$|The {{literature}} of action control claims that humans control their actions in two ways. In the stimulus-based <b>approach,</b> <b>actions</b> are triggered by external stimuli. In the ideomotor <b>approach,</b> <b>actions</b> are elicited endogenously {{and controlled by}} the intended goal. In the current study, our purpose was to investigate whether these two action control modes affect task-switching differently. We combined a classical task-switching paradigm with action-effect learning. Both experiments consisted of two experimental phases: an acquisition phase, in which associations between task, response and subsequent action effects were learned and a test phase, in which {{the effects of these}} associations were tested on task performance by presenting the former action effects as preceding effects, prior to the task (called practiced effects). Subjects either chose freely between tasks (ideomotor action control mode) or they were cued as to which task to perform (sensorimotor action control mode). We aimed to replicate the consistency effect (i. e., task is chosen according to the practiced task-effect association) and non-reversal advantage (i. e., better task performance when the practiced effect matches the previously learned task-effect association). Our results suggest that participants acquired stable action-effect associations independently of the learning mode. The consistency effect (Experiment 1) could be shown, independent of the learning mode, but only on the response-level. The non-reversal advantage (Experiment 2) was only evident in the error rates and only for participants who had practiced in the ideomotor action control mode...|$|R

40|$|A {{complete}} {{understanding of}} the cognitive systems underwriting theory of mind (ToM) abilities requires articulating how mental state representations are generated and processed in everyday situations. Individuals rarely announce their intentions prior to acting, and actions are often consistent with multiple mental states. In order for ToM to operate effectively in such situations, mental state representations should be generated in response to certain actions, even when those actions occur {{in the presence of}} mental state content derived from other aspects of the situation. Results from three experiments with preschool children and adults demonstrate that mental state information is indeed generated based on an <b>approach</b> <b>action</b> cue in situations that contain competing mental state information. Further, the frequency with which participants produced or endorsed explanations that include mental states about an approached object decreased when the competing mental state information about a different object was made explicit.

One of the most important approaches is to use firewall in the network facilities. The main objectives of firewalls are to stop the transfer of suspicious packets in several ways. However because of its blind packet stopping, high process power requirements and expensive prices some of the providers are reluctant to use the firewall.
