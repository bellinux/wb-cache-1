He {{grew up in}} the Cowies Hill area of Durban, {{attending}} Westville High School where he played in school-based groups doing covers of songs by Jimi Hendrix and The Who. He was influenced by Indian music and cuisine and by the work of Frank Zappa and Captain Beefheart. He learned to play tabla at the Hindu Sarat school in Durban. In 1976 he was conscripted into the South African Defence Force, where he declared himself a Hindu pacifist, and was assigned to medical duties and then to band work. During his military service, Sony played B♭ horn, euphonium and drums. He changed his surname from Swinney to Sony to make it harder for the army {{to get in touch with}} him for camps; he chose Sony because he liked their products. Whilst in the army in 1977, his father brought him <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> punk rock albums from an overseas trip. This was his first exposure to Sex Pistols and the Clash. By the time his two years service was over he had schooled himself in a lot of the post punk Art rock bands as well as reggae and dub and had developed a healthy respect for Shangaan bass players.|$|E

500|$|The video {{begins with}} a view of the {{apartment}} that Lewis and Haynes shared. Books and a vase lay strewn across the floor, while Lewis weeps in the corner and Haynes watches from a distance teary-eyed. The video switches to several other shots of Lewis singing the first verse, looking morose. In a third shot, Lewis is seen standing on a rooftop against the Los Angeles skyline dressed in a dark red crop top. Then the video switches to Lewis standing in front of projected images of the memorable times of her relationship with Haynes. Lewis and Haynes are seen sat at opposite ends of the sofa looking into the distance, spliced with more scenes of Lewis on the rooftop. The couple are seen during an awkward dinner before switching to images of the couple in bed together, seemingly happy. As the chorus kicks in for the first time, the couple are seen arriving at a party, with Lewis wearing an aqua-coloured dress with a portion of her midriff revealed, meanwhile Haynes wears a plaid shirt and jeans. Initially the couple are content, embracing guests but socialising separately and avoiding contact with each other. The camera switches between these and the earlier scenes of Lewis in front of projected images and the LA skyline throughout the chorus. As Lewis sings [...] "I'm <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> trouble/ We're in <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> trouble", she glances over to see Haynes flirting with another girl.|$|E

However, there exists <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> more <b>of</b> such parameters that can be extracted by analyzing 4 D data sets.

It describes to which extent the heart exhibits an asynchronous movement. This novel descriptor ASYNCHRONISM is based on the already established measures WALL MOTION and WALL THICKENING, but reveals new, valuable information that is not available when relying only upon the two aforementioned parameters. The ASYNCHRONISM has an intuitive meaning, since it corresponds to the clinical classification scheme of wall motion abnormalities.
