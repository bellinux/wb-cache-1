5|$|At common law, if a party {{resisted}} <b>arrest</b> by {{an officer}} without warrant {{and who had}} no right to <b>arrest</b> him, and if in the course of that resistance the officer was killed, the offense of the party resisting <b>arrest</b> would be reduced from what would have been murder if the officer had had the right to <b>arrest,</b> to manslaughter. What would be murder if the officer had the right to <b>arrest</b> might be reduced to manslaughter by the very fact that he had no such right. So an officer, at common law, was not authorized to make an <b>arrest</b> without a warrant, for a mere misdemeanor not committed in his presence.|$|E

5|$|Glik v.

The case arose when Simon Glik, a private citizen, filmed Boston, Massachusetts, police officers making an <b>arrest</b> in a public park. When the officers observed that Glik was recording the <b>arrest,</b> they arrested him and he was subsequently charged with wiretapping, disturbing the peace, and aiding in the escape of a prisoner.

5|$|In 1890, James McLaughlin, the U.S. Indian Agent at Fort Yates on Standing Rock Agency, {{feared that}} the Lakota leader was about to flee the {{reservation}} with the Ghost Dancers, so he ordered the police to <b>arrest</b> him. On December 14, 1890, McLaughlin drafted a letter to Lt. Henry Bullhead (noted as Bull Head in lead), an Indian agency policeman, that included instructions and a plan to capture Sitting Bull. The plan called for the <b>arrest</b> to take place at dawn on December 15, and advised {{the use of a}} light spring wagon to facilitate removal before his followers could rally. Bullhead decided against using the wagon. He intended to have the police officers force Sitting Bull to mount a horse immediately after the <b>arrest.</b>|$|E

40|$|Previous studies {{documented}} that crime is heavily concentrated in families. However, many studies relied on relatively small samples, often males {{and information on}} criminal involvement was self-reported. The present study investigates: (1) the prevalence of <b>arrests</b> in three generations; (2) the concentration of offenders and <b>arrests</b> within families; (3) the relationships between <b>arrests</b> among the relatives; (4) the relationship between <b>arrests</b> and family violence. A complete cohort of the families in which a child {{was born in a}} Dutch city was selected, and the <b>arrests</b> of all known family members (siblings, parents and grandparents) were investigated. Results showed that 7. 2 % of the mothers and 18 % of the fathers had been <b>arrested.</b> The likelihood of parental <b>arrests</b> was related to the likelihood of grandparental <b>arrests.</b> There was clear evidence for assortative mating: when the mother was <b>arrested,</b> the likelihood that the father was <b>arrested</b> was increased with a factor five. Maternal <b>arrests</b> were also related to <b>arrests</b> of her parents-in-law. <b>Arrests</b> are heavily concentrated within families, 7. 8 % of the families account for 52. 3 % of the suspects. <b>Arrests</b> in family members constitute a major risk factor for poor developmental outcomes, such as criminal behavior. At the time of birth, it is possible to use information on <b>arrests</b> to select children who are at relatively high risk for the target of prevention efforts. Implications for prevention policies are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Schindler {{was arrested}} twice on {{suspicion}} of black market activities and once for breaking the Nuremberg Laws by kissing a Jewish girl, an action forbidden by the Race and Resettlement Act. The first <b>arrest,</b> in late 1941, led to him being kept overnight. His secretary arranged for his release through Schindler's influential contacts in the Nazi Party. His second <b>arrest,</b> on 29 April 1942, {{was the result of}} his kissing a Jewish girl on the cheek at his birthday party at the factory the previous day. He remained in jail five days before his influential Nazi contacts were able to obtain his release. The third <b>arrest,</b> where he was accused of black marketeering and bribing Göth and others to improve the conditions of the Jewish workers, took place in October 1944. He was held for most of a week and released. Göth had been arrested on 13 September 1944 for corruption and other abuses of power, and Schindler's <b>arrest</b> was part of the ongoing investigation into Göth's activities. Göth was never convicted on those charges, but was hanged by the Supreme National Tribunal of Poland for war crimes on 13 September 1946.|$|E
