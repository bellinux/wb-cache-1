He returned to directing with a new television series for Fox titled Heat Vision and Jack, starring Jack Black; however, the show was not picked up by Fox after its pilot episode and the series was cancelled.|$|E

25|$|Characters in {{the book}} also claim that Mary Magdalene was labeled a prostitute by the Church.

Also, Pope Gregory I's teaching <b>about</b> <b>Mary</b> Magdalene, though popular throughout much of the Church's history, was never formally integrated into Catholic dogma; nor was he speaking ex cathedra at the time, so his speech is not seen as infallible. Whatever weight is given to this tradition, however, {{there is no evidence that}} it was used to defame Mary, who was considered a saint to whose honor churches were built. She is also respected as a witness to Christ's resurrection as written in the Gospels.|$|E
25|$|The Hangover Part II {{debuted in}} 40 {{countries}} internationally {{over the weekend}} of May 26–29, 2011, across 5,170 screens. In total, the film accrued $60.3million from its Friday-through-Monday opening weekend, more than tripling the international gross of The Hangovers debut in the same territories. The highest weekend gross came from the United Kingdom where the film earned £10,409,017 from 469 screens, breaking {{the record for the}} highest grossing opening for a US comedy, but this record was overtaken by The Inbetweeners Movie (£13,216,736). Australia accrued a gross of $12.1million to replace Sex and the City in the country as the highest grossing opening for an MA-rated film – no-one under the age of 15 permitted. The film took $8.7 million in The Netherlands and $6.2million in France and $3.1million in Italy ($4.6million with previews); a five-fold increase over the opening weekend gross of The Hangover. On its second weekend, the film accrued $63.8million from 53 territories, placing it second behind Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides; the film having earned 79percent of its predecessor's entire overseas run. On the weekend of June 10–12, 2011, it surpassed its predecessor and There's Something <b>About</b> <b>Mary</b> in international earnings to become the highest-grossing R-rated comedy overseas.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{representation}} of motherhood in Frances Hodgson Burnett's novel, The Secret Garden, and seeks to complicate our understanding of motherhood by moving from the static, binary notions central to Victorian culture to motherhood {{as a form of}} positive agency. Previous scholarship centers on the debate <b>about</b> <b>Mary's</b> agency and whether this reads as either reinforcing or subverting the patriarchal norms of the Victorian period this work seeks to link questions <b>about</b> <b>Mary's</b> agency to the text's representation of motherhood as a diverse, politically-inflicted, and fluid subject position. Burnett's secret garden is the centre of the book's tensions either as a site of exclusion or as a source of power. Reading the garden as a metaphor for motherhood and drawing upon the unique associations of the garden and the role of Victorian gardening literature, I suggest that Burnett offers a model of female agency that subtly challenges patriarchal norms.
