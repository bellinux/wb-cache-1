5|$|Salt is {{considered}} to be a very auspicious substance in Hinduism and is used in particular religious ceremonies like house-warmings and weddings. In Jainism, devotees lay an offering of raw rice with <b>a</b> <b>pinch</b> <b>of</b> <b>salt</b> before a deity to signify their devotion and salt is sprinkled on a person's cremated remains before the ashes are buried. Salt is believed to ward off evil spirits in Mahayana Buddhist tradition, and when returning home from a funeral, <b>a</b> <b>pinch</b> <b>of</b> <b>salt</b> is thrown over the left shoulder as this prevents evil spirits from entering the house. In Shinto, salt is used for ritual purification of locations and people (harae, specifically shubatsu), and small piles of salt are placed in dishes by the entrance of establishments for the two-fold purposes of warding off evil and attracting patrons.|$|E

She also {{proceeded}} with her singing career, appearing releasing on three compilations albums (A Jug of Punch, <b>A</b> <b>Pinch</b> <b>of</b> <b>Salt</b> and Rocket Along) in 1960 and an EP, Heroes in Love, in 1963 (now included with False True Lovers on the CD release). It was after that, {{in a series}} of influential albums, that she helped to introduce many innovations into the English folk revival. In 1964, she recorded the landmark jazz-folk fusion of Folk Roots, New Routes, with guitarist Davy Graham. 1967 saw the essentially southern English song collection, The Sweet Primeroses, on which she was accompanied for the first time by Dolly Collins's portative organ. 1968's The Power of the True Love Knot also featured Dolly's accompaniment. In 1969, there was another collaboration, this time with The Young Tradition (featuring Peter Bellamy, Heather Wood and Royston Wood) and Dolly Collins, The Holly Bears the Crown. However, the album was not released until 1995.|$|E

The second outbreak, in 1840, killed all the remaining settlers (or, according to different accounts, spared just one girl).

Traders opened the chest ... and released the grim reaper. According to George Kennan, in 1879 the bureaucracy believed that the deserted town still existed, and dispatched Hermann Schiller, a political exile from Poltava, on a 3,700 mile march on foot to Zashiversk.

40|$|The use {{of illegal}} drugs {{undermines}} the ethos of sport and jeopardises the health of athletes. However, many athletes use drugs, the list of cheats is long and littered with World and Olympic champions. Of the likely small percentage caught, the majority deny the charge, a smaller number argue they were given the drugs without their knowledge, and a smaller number still admit to using the drug, but argue that they didn’t know it would enhance their performance. Whilst all denials should be taken with <b>a</b> substantial <b>pinch</b> <b>of</b> <b>salt,</b> the latter scenario above is potentially the case with Maria Sharapova. Sharapova may have been aware that she was taking Meldonium, but believing {{it to be a}} legitimate medication, was unaware that doing so would improve her performance. A reasonable response would be ‘so what, a drug is a drug; if it’s in the athlete’ system, they have an advantage over clean athletes, whether they know it or not’. However, it is not necessarily the case. Research conducted by myself and Abby Foad, Damien Coleman and Phil Hurst at the Sports Performance lab at Canterbury Christ Church University suggests that when an athlete is unaware that they have taken a drug, the drug is less effective, in fact, sometimes only half as effective. In short, part of the effect of a drug is a placebo effect. This makes sense. Placebo effects are reported by disciplines such as medicine. Key to the phenomenon is the idea that an individual can only experience a placebo effect if they know they have taken a drug, {{and at the same time}} expect that drug to have a specific effect. Interestingly, data from our lab also demonstrate the flip side of this effect. That is, athletes who are given an inert placebo but believe that they have been given a real drug, perform at a significantly higher level. So, what are the implications of these counter-intuitive proposals? Firstly, it’s often been proposed that, whilst athletes who have unknowingly taken drugs are perhaps morally innocent of doping, they remain ‘physically’ guilty. That is, the drug was in their system and doing its biological job. The athlete therefore had an unfair advantage and should be penalised. However, our data suggest otherwise. Given the relatively small effects of most drugs in sport even when fully effective, such an athlete may not actually have gained any real edge over their competition. In short, they may be both morally and physically innocent of doping. This could be the case with Maria Sharapova. Secondly, once an athlete has experienced improved performance as the result of an inert placebo, they are less likely to use drugs in the future. Data from Phil Hurst, a PhD research at Christ Church that will be presented at the upcoming American College of Sports Medicine Conference in Boston, USA, demonstrates this effect clearly. This second implication of our research could be an important step in the fight against drug use in sport. This is especially true given the significant rise in the use of performance enhancing drugs by recreational athletes, gym users and even schoolchildren...|$|R

50|$|At the Castle, Valanice falls {{unconscious}} as Graham {{breaks into}} her room. She sees herself at 23 years of age, {{when she was}} forcedly taken away from her family by a certain wizard Shadrack. Shadrack keeps her in a deadly tower surrounded by her own nightmares. Back in the Castle, Graham, by her side, keeps a promise to help her. The list shows four new ingredients and Graham continues his adventure. Talking with Shamir the second time reveals to Graham {{that at least two}} of the ingredients, which he can use to revive the children, are found at the Isle of the Mists. Eventually Graham arrives there and meets again with the Arch Druid, who confirms the presence of the elements which can only be found in the depths of Mother Nature. In order to address it properly, Graham undergoes a ritual in which he proves that he is both a savior and a part of the Nature. Graham passes the guardians and accesses the Sanctuary within the Isle, usually only available to druids. There he meets and talks to the spirits of Nature, which explain that in order to obtain the requested items (a male subject's strength and a female subject's voice), Graham must enchant regular items with which he plans to do so. Graham touches the stones on an ancient tree to grant himself such power. Valanice is then shown to him by the spirits, and he understands that she was once a druid. At the same time, in her dream, Shadrack visits her in the tower and begins torturing her. Seeing all this, Graham rushes back into the Castle and reaches Valanice's crown, transporting himself inside her dream. After some fierce confrontation with the nightmares, he steps in and frees Valanice from the tower. As they are back in reality, a cutscene reveals that Shadrack was in fact the master of the Black Cloak Society, to which another prominent figure, Mannanan, once belonged. As Mannanan delivers young Valanice to Shadrack Shadrack, on the other hand, plans on tormenting Valanice In the present, Graham vows to destroy Shadrack whatever it takes. Having brought Valanice back into reality, he journeys to the Isle of the Mists once more and now asks for the items to be enchanted. Upon returning, he gets both ingredients from his children. He gets the third ingredient (a silver moon) from a crescent emerald shape he obtained from the druid tree, with the help of a blacksmith, and the fourth one (<b>a</b> <b>pinch</b> <b>of</b> lively shaken <b>salt)</b> from the druids at the Isle of the Mists.
