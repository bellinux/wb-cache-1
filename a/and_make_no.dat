5|$|Whatever the {{circumstances}} of Domnall's accession, the Uí Chennselaig regime in Dublin was short-lived. The Annals of Inisfallen, the Annals of the Four Masters, and the fifteenthsixteenth-century Annals of Ulster, all reveal that, within the year, Domnall died after a brief illness, with the latter two sources specifying that he succumbed after three nights of sickness. The Annals of Inisfallen and the Annals of Ulster accord him the title King of Dublin, <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>no</b> mention of any connection with the Leinster kingship. Upon Domnall's demise, Toirdelbach had his own son, Muirchertach (died 1119), appointed King of Dublin. In so doing, Toirdelbach reinforced his authority in Dublin, and followed a precedent started by Domnall's grandfather, in which a claimant to the high-kingship of Ireland installed his own heir to the kingship of Dublin.|$|E

25|$|Classically, the {{bringing}} of unconscious {{thoughts and}} feelings to consciousness is brought about by encouraging a patient to talk about dreams and engage in free association, in which patients report their thoughts without reservation <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>no</b> attempt to concentrate while doing so. Another important element of psychoanalysis is transference, {{the process by which}} patients displace onto their analysts feelings and ideas which derive from previous figures in their lives. Transference was first seen as a regrettable phenomenon that interfered with the recovery of repressed memories and disturbed patients' objectivity, but by 1912, Freud had come to see it as {{an essential part of the}} therapeutic process.|$|E

25|$|The Israeli negotiators {{proposed}} that Israel {{be allowed to}} set up radar stations inside the Palestinian state, and be allowed to use its airspace. Israel also wanted the right to deploy troops on Palestinian territory {{in the event of}} an emergency, and the stationing of an international force in the Jordan Valley. Palestinian authorities would maintain control of border crossings under temporary Israeli observation. Israel would maintain a permanent security presence along 15% of the Palestinian-Jordanian border. Israel also demanded that the Palestinian state be demilitarized with the exception of its paramilitary security forces, that it would not make alliances without Israeli approval or allow the introduction of foreign forces west of the Jordan River, and that it dismantle terrorist groups. One of Israel's strongest demands was that Arafat declare the conflict over, <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>no</b> further demands. Israel also wanted water resources in the West Bank to be shared by both sides and remain under Israeli management.|$|E
25|$|Homeless {{people often}} find it {{difficult}} to document their date of birth or their address. Because homeless people usually have no place to store possessions, they often lose their belongings, including their identification and other documents, or find them destroyed by police or others. Without a photo ID, homeless persons cannot get a job or access many social services, including health care and clinic access. They can be denied access to even the most basic assistance: clothing closets, food pantries, certain public benefits, and in some cases, emergency shelters. Obtaining replacement identification is difficult. Without an address, birth certificates cannot be mailed. Fees may be cost-prohibitive for impoverished persons. And some states will not issue birth certificates unless the person has photo identification, creating a Catch-22. This problem is far less acute in countries which provide free-at-use health care, such as the UK, where hospitals are open-access day and night <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>no</b> charges for treatment. In the US, free-care clinics, for homeless and other people, do exist in major cities, but they often attract more demand than they can meet.|$|E
500|$|Polls were {{released}} {{at the end}} of the first week of campaigning, and showed a nine-point swing against Labor. Whitlam's campaign did not believe it at first, but additional polling made it clear: the electorate was turning against the ALP. The Coalition attacked Labor for the economic conditions, and released television commercials [...] "The Three Dark Years" [...] showing images from the Whitlam government scandals. The ALP campaign, which had concentrated on the issue of Whitlam's dismissal, did not begin to address the economy until its final days. By that time Fraser, confident of victory, was content to sit back, avoid specifics <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>no</b> mistakes. There was little violence in the campaign, but three letter bombs were placed in the post; one wounded two people in Bjelke-Petersen's office, while the other two, addressed to Kerr and Fraser, were intercepted and defused.|$|E

500|$|Polls {{from the}} first week of campaigning showed a nine-point swing against Labor, which would have {{decimated}} Labor if repeated in an election. Whitlam's campaign team disbelieved the results at first, but additional polling returns were clear: the electorate had turned against Labor. The Coalition attacked Labor for economic conditions, and released television commercials including [...] "The Three Dark Years" [...] showing images from Whitlam government scandals. The ALP campaign, which had concentrated on the issue of Whitlam's dismissal, did not address the economy until its final days. By that time Fraser, confident of victory, was content to sit back, avoid specifics <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>no</b> mistakes. On election night, 13 December, the Coalition won the largest majority government in Australian history, winning 91 seats to Labor's 36. Labor suffered a 6.5 percent swing against it and its caucus was cut almost in half, suffering a 30-seat swing. Labor was left with five fewer seats than it had when Whitlam took the leadership. The Coalition also won a 37–25 majority in the Senate.|$|E
500|$|Pittsburgh next {{exploded}} into riots, but Hayes {{was reluctant to}} send in troops without the governor first requesting them. Other discontented citizens joined the railroad workers in rioting. After a few days, Hayes resolved to send in troops to protect federal property wherever {{it appeared to be}} threatened and gave Major General Winfield Scott Hancock overall command of the situation, marking the first use of federal troops to break a strike against a private company. The riot spread further, to Chicago and St. Louis, where strikers shut down railroad facilities. By July 29, the riots had ended and federal troops returned to their barracks. Although no federal troops had killed any of the strikers, or been killed themselves, clashes between state militia troops and strikers resulted in deaths on both sides. The railroads were victorious in the short term, as the workers returned to their jobs and some wage cuts remained in effect. But, the public blamed the railroads for the strikes and violence, and they were compelled to improve working conditions <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>no</b> further cuts. Business leaders praised Hayes, but his own opinion was more equivocal; as he recorded in his diary: [...] "The strikes have been put down by force; but now for the real remedy. Can't something [...] done by education of strikers, by judicious control of capitalists, by wise general policy to end or diminish the evil? The railroad strikers, as a rule, are good men, sober, intelligent, and industrious." ...|$|E

2500|$|Queens, a {{borough of}} New York City, was {{supposedly}} named after Catherine of Braganza, {{since she was}} queen when Queens County was established in 1683. Queens' naming is {{consistent with those of}} Kings County (the borough of Brooklyn, originally named after her husband, King Charles II) and Richmond County (the borough of Staten Island, named after his illegitimate son, the 1st Duke of Richmond). However, there is no historical evidence that Queens County was named in her honor, neither is there a document from the time proclaiming it so. Some written histories of Queens skip over the monarch entirely <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>no</b> mention of her or her supposed namesake county. Historians furthermore argue that Catherine [...] "probably didn't even know Queens existed" [...] and point out that [...] "Catherine herself ... played no role in the settlement of Queens." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many anecdotes of Diogenes {{refer to}} his dog-like behavior, and his praise of a dog's virtues. It {{is not known}} whether Diogenes was insulted with the epithet [...] "doggish" [...] and made a virtue of it, or whether he first took up the dog theme himself. When asked why he was called a dog he replied, [...] "I fawn on those who give me anything, I yelp at those who refuse, and I set my teeth in rascals." [...] Diogenes {{believed}} human beings live artificially and hypocritically and {{would do well to}} study the dog. Besides performing natural body functions in public with ease, a dog will eat anything, <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>no</b> fuss about where to sleep. Dogs live in the present without anxiety, and have no use for the pretensions of abstract philosophy. In addition to these virtues, dogs are thought to know instinctively who is friend and who is foe. Unlike human beings who either dupe others or are duped, dogs will give an honest bark at the truth. Diogenes stated that [...] "other dogs bite their enemies, I bite my friends to save them." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2005, Romney {{abandoned}} {{his support for}} the compromise amendment, stating that the amendment confused voters who oppose both gay marriage and civil unions. The amendment was defeated in the General Court (legislature) in 2005 when both supporters of same-sex marriage and opponents of civil unions voted against it. In June 2005, Romney endorsed a petition effort led by the Coalition for Marriage & Family that would ban gay marriage <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>no</b> provisions for civil unions. [...] Backed by the signatures of 170,000 Massachusetts residents the new amendment was certified as a valid referendum on September 7, 2005 by Massachusetts Attorney General Thomas Reilly. The measure needs the approval of fifty legislators in two consecutive sessions of the Massachusetts General Court to be placed on the ballot. [...] The Massachusetts legislature however declined to vote on the initiative in two consecutive sessions held on July 12, 2006 and November 9, 2006. Romney responded by joining former Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn and eight others to file a complaint with the state's Supreme Judicial Court to force the legislature to vote on the proposed amendment. The petition also asked the court to instruct the Massachusetts Secretary of State to place the referendum on the 2008 ballot if the legislature failed to vote on the amendment by January 2, 2007.|$|E
