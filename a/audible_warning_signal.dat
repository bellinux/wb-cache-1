2500|$|While {{on final}} {{approach}} for landing, the aircraft was about 2,000ft (610m) above ground, when the left-hand (captain's) radio altimeter suddenly changed from [...] to read [...] altitude, although the right-hand (co-pilot's) radio altimeter functioned correctly. The voice recording {{showed that the}} crew was given an <b>audible</b> <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> ("TOO LOW!, GEAR!") that indicated that the aircraft's landing gear should be down, as the aircraft was, according to the radio altimeter, flying too low. Later, the safety board's preliminary report modified this analysis, indicating that the flight data recorder history of the captain's radio altimeter showed 8191 feet (the maximum possible recorded) until the aircraft descended through 1950, then suddenly showed negative 8 feet.|$|E
5000|$|Service, {{emergency}} and parking brakes with fire resistant hydraulic fluid is used [...] Head lights, <b>audible</b> <b>warning</b> <b>signal,</b> back up alarm and {{portable fire extinguisher}} are provided. Special cabin/canopy is also provided for safety of operator. A safety device is provided to shut off the engine if exhaust gases exceed temperature of 85 °C (or as per set value).|$|E
50|$|When the CLRVs and ALRVs were {{delivered}} in the 1970s and 1980s respectively, they were equipped with gongs as the sole <b>audible</b> <b>warning</b> <b>signal.</b> Most cars were retrofitted with horns in the late 1990s when the 510 Spadina line opened. Initially, the horns were salvaged from retired H1 and M1 subway cars which were replaced by the T1 subway cars. However, during the CLRV/ALRV streetcar fleet overhaul project between 2011 and 2012 the TTC reconfigured the streetcar horns with new air horns or automobile-type electric horns.|$|E

50|$|Red minibuses {{often provide}} more {{convenient}} transport for riders not served by green minibuses or other public buses, {{and are thus}} quite popular. Where green minibus drivers are paid fixed wages to drive their routes, red minibus drivers often rely on their fares for a living and thus are often seen {{to be more aggressive}} drivers. The prevalence of aggressive driving has resulted in the Transport Department making it mandatory for Hong Kong minibuses to be equipped with large read-out speedometers which allow passengers to track the speed at which minibus drivers operate. Currently, if minibuses exceed 80 km/h, the speedometer will sound an <b>audible</b> <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> (begin beeping) to the driver and passengers. If the minibus exceeds 100 km/h, the beeping will turn into a sustained tone. However, almost without exception this warning signal is ignored by both driver and passengers.|$|E
50|$|Today {{known as}} <b>audible</b> track <b>warning</b> <b>signals,</b> or <b>audible</b> track <b>warning</b> devices, {{detonators}} {{are used to}} attract the attention of train crews when track repairs or an obstruction are ahead, or when a hand signaller is acting for a signal.|$|R
40|$|The {{quality of}} {{information}} perception in an aircraft cockpit {{depends on the}} way of interacting with display units, including modality, interface structure, and external exploitation conditions. The goal of this work {{is to find a}} solution that would allow real-time imaging or doubling of <b>audible</b> <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> through spatial-temporal color coding. Software emulation of the peripheral display was built. The development and pilot evaluation of the method were both performed. Presentation of visual signals in paracentral field is efficient, but their optical and temporal parameters are critical in relation to distraction effect...|$|R
50|$|With the {{autopilot}} active, Kudrinsky, against regulations, let the children {{sit at the}} controls. First his daughter Yana took the pilot's left front seat. Kudrinsky adjusted {{the autopilot}}'s heading {{to give her the}} impression that she was turning the plane, though she actually had no control of the aircraft. Shortly thereafter Eldar occupied the pilot's seat. Unlike his sister, Eldar applied enough force to the control column to contradict the autopilot for 30 seconds. This caused the flight computer to switch the plane's ailerons to manual control while maintaining control over the other flight systems. A silent indicator light came on to alert the pilots to this partial disengagement. The pilots, who had previously flown Russian-designed planes which had <b>audible</b> <b>warning</b> <b>signals,</b> apparently failed to notice it.|$|R
50|$|Because of the {{unreliability}} of the ILS signal, {{the aircraft}} descended too low, triggering several <b>audible</b> and visual <b>warning</b> <b>signals.</b> The crew ignored these warnings, and also descended below the minimum altitude allowed {{for both the}} VOR/DME and ILS procedures without positive visual contact with the runway. A possible reason {{was that they had}} to land soon {{due to a lack of}} fuel, until finally, the aircraft crashed at 04:27.|$|R
50|$|The NG900 {{introduced}} the Saab Information Display, or SID (available on S or SE models only), {{which gave the}} driver real-time information while driving, such as fuel efficiency and outside temperature. Base specification cars had a digital clock {{in place of the}} SID and a non-digital instrument panel with a mechanical odometer (as opposed to the digital odometer on higher spec models). The SID also controls other vehicle components, including but not limited to <b>audible</b> <b>warnings</b> for turn <b>signals</b> and the vehicle's horn.|$|R
50|$|If the AWS {{equipment}} on the High Speed Train (HST) passenger train had been working, {{the chance of}} the accident occurring would have been highly unlikely, though not completely eliminated, since the AWS is only an advisory system. The driver's attention had been distracted {{and he did not}} see the preceding signals, but AWS would have given him a clear <b>audible</b> <b>warning</b> that the <b>signals</b> were displaying cautionary aspects and that he should start braking. Failure to acknowledge this warning would have caused the emergency brake to be applied. Automatic Train Protection (ATP) equipment would have almost certainly prevented the accident. The train was fitted with ATP but this was switched off. At the time of the accident, the ATP equipment was not required to be switched on, as it had proved troublesome in service. In addition, not all drivers were qualified to use it.|$|R

5000|$|A {{stall warning}} is an {{electronic}} or mechanical device that sounds an <b>audible</b> <b>warning</b> as the stall speed is approached. The majority of aircraft contain {{some form of}} this device that warns the pilot of an impending stall. The simplest such device is a stall warning horn, which consists of either a pressure sensor or a movable metal tab that actuates a switch, and produces an <b>audible</b> <b>warning</b> in response.|$|R

50|$|Kia Motors {{offered the}} 2011 Cadenza premium sedan with an {{optional}} Lane Departure Warning System (LDWS) in limited markets. This system uses a flashing dashboard icon and emits an <b>audible</b> <b>warning</b> when a white lane marking is being crossed, and emits a louder <b>audible</b> <b>warning</b> when a yellow-line marking is crossed. This system is canceled when a turn signal is operating, or by pressing a deactivation {{switch on the}} dashboard; it works by using an optical sensor {{on both sides of}} the car.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to visual warnings, ambulances can be fitted with <b>audible</b> <b>warnings,</b> sometimes known as sirens, which can alert people and vehicles {{to the presence}} of an ambulance before they can be seen. The first <b>audible</b> <b>warnings</b> were mechanical bells, mounted to either the front or roof of the ambulance. Most modern ambulances are now fitted with electronic sirens, producing a range of different noises which ambulance operators can use to attract more attention to themselves, particularly when proceeding through an intersection or in heavy traffic.|$|R

25|$|Traffic police cars, {{known in}} the UK as Road Policing Units, are cars {{designed}} {{for the job of}} enforcing traffic laws, and as such usually have the highest performance of any of the police vehicles, as they must be capable of catching most other vehicles on the road. They may be fitted with special bumpers designed to force vehicles off the road, and may have visual and <b>audible</b> <b>warnings,</b> with special <b>audible</b> <b>warnings</b> which can be heard from a greater distance. In some police forces, the term traffic car may refer to cars specifically equipped for traffic control in addition to enforcing traffic laws. As such, these cars may differ only slightly from a patrol car, including having radar and laser speed detection equipment, traffic cones, flares, and traffic control signs.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to visual warnings, most appliances are also fitted with <b>audible</b> <b>warnings,</b> sometimes known as sirens, which can alert {{people to the}} presence of an emergency vehicle before they can be seen. The first <b>audible</b> <b>warnings</b> were mechanical bells, mounted on the front or roof of the truck. Most vehicles are now fitted with electronic sirens, which can produce a range of different sounds. Fire service driving training often includes the use of different sounds depending on traffic conditions and maneuver being performed. For instance, on a clear road, approaching a junction, the [...] "wail" [...] setting may be used, which gives a long up and down variation, with an unbroken tone, whereas, in heavy slow traffic, a [...] "yelp" [...] setting may be preferred, which is like a wail, but faster.|$|R
