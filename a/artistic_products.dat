25|$|Byzantine art is {{the name}} for the <b>artistic</b> <b>products</b> of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire, {{as well as the}} nations and states that {{inherited}} culturally from the empire. Though the empire itself emerged from Rome's decline and lasted until the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, many Eastern Orthodox states in Eastern Europe, as well as to some degree the Muslim states of the eastern Mediterranean, preserved many aspects of the empire's culture and art for centuries afterward.|$|E

Tyndall called for a [...] "complete moral regeneration of the national life". He objected to homosexuality and advocated {{for it to be}} outlawed, writing that [...] "the literary and <b>artistic</b> <b>products</b> of the homosexual mind can only flourish in a society where heterosexual values have been gravely weakened." [...] He expressed the view that the NF [...] "was itself by no means immune to this sickening cult", and he disapproved of the presence of homosexuals in the party. Under Tyndall, the BNP called for the re-criminalisation of homosexual activity.|$|E
500|$|During the mid-15th century, {{tapestry}} {{was one of}} {{the most}} expensive and prized <b>artistic</b> <b>products</b> in Europe. Commercial production proliferated across the Netherlands and northern France from the early 15th century, especially in the cities of Arras, Bruges and Tournai. The perceived technical ability of these artisans was such that, in 1517, Pope Julius II sent Raphael's cartoons to Brussels to be woven into hangings. Such woven wall hangings played a central political role as diplomatic gifts, especially in their larger format; Philip the Good gifted several to participants at the Congress of Arras in 1435, where the halls were draped from top to bottom and all around (tout autour) with tapestries showing scenes of the [...] "Battle and Overthrow of People of Liege". At Charles the Bold and Margaret of York's wedding the room [...] "was hung above with draperies of wool, blue and white, and on the sides was tapestried with a rich tapestry woven with the history of Jason and the Golden Fleece". Rooms typically were hung from ceiling to floor with tapestries and some rooms named for a set of tapestries, such as a chamber Philip the Bold named for a set of white tapestries with scenes from The Romance of the Rose. For about two centuries during the Burgundian period, master weavers produced [...] "innumerable series of hangings heavy with gold and silver thread, the like of which the world had never seen".|$|E

6000|$|The {{question}} of a final criterion for the appreciation of art is one that perpetually recurs to those interested in any sort of aesthetic endeavor. Mr. John Addington Symonds, in a chapter of 'The Renaissance in Italy' treating of the Bolognese school of painting, which once had so great cry, and was vaunted the supreme exemplar of the grand style, but which he now believes fallen into lasting contempt for its emptiness and soullessness, seeks {{to determine whether there}} can be an enduring criterion or not; and his conclusion is applicable to literature as to the other arts. [...] "Our hope," [...] he says, [...] "with regard to the unity of taste in the future then is, that all sentimental or academical seekings after the ideal having been abandoned, momentary theories founded upon idiosyncratic or temporary partialities exploded, and nothing accepted but what is solid and positive, the scientific spirit shall make men progressively more and more conscious of these 'bleibende Verhaltnisse,' more and more capable of living in the whole; also, that in proportion as we gain a firmer hold upon our own place in the world, we shall come to comprehend with more instinctive certitude what is simple, natural, and honest, welcoming with gladness all <b>artistic</b> <b>products</b> that exhibit these qualities. The perception of the enlightened man will then be the task of a healthy person who has made himself acquainted with the laws of evolution in art and in society, and is able to test the excellence of work in any stage from immaturity to decadence by discerning what there is of truth, sincerity, and natural vigor in it." ...|$|E

However, affiliation with MUNY provides benefits to performers. These include priority scheduling in popular locations, access to commuter railroad terminals, and fewer problems with law enforcement. And, because the MUNY scheduling system rewards its auditioned performers with access to high-traffic areas, it arguably results in a higher-quality <b>artistic</b> <b>product</b> for MTA riders.|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of the art market involves some basic difficulties linked, in particular, to the uncertainty and asymmetry of sector information which often proves to be incomplete and not shared by or accessible to one and all equally 1. Art, within our society, tends to have a dual purpose, aesthetic and superaesthetic. The economic role of art, in particular, is sustained by complex marketing processes, which tend to modify the aims and conditions of artistic enterprise. Presuming however that the fundamental requisite for an <b>artistic</b> <b>product</b> is its value intended here as research, uniqueness and creativity, it might prove interesting from a corporate-economic viewpoint to put forward a few observations about aspects of its production and marketing. In actual fact, the value of artwork may not be linked exclusively to the personality or commitment of the artist, {{but also to the}} process of recognition of the usefulness of the <b>artistic</b> <b>product</b> in its fulfilment of others. From a corporate-economic viewpoint however there is always a minimum of uncertainty involved in the scientific approach to this sector and in particular to the type of artist-cum-entrepreneur...|$|R

By viewing artistic innovation as a seminal act of entrepreneurship, scholars may contemplate how the arts can be more powerfully applied to mainstream entrepreneurship pedagogy and theory...|$|R

Under the influence of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's doctrine {{of a return to}} nature, this book was at first intended to be a short narrative of the collapse of the life of a young artist. It expanded as its composition progressed into a huge work drawing on Keller's youth and career (or more precisely non-career) as a painter up to 1842. Its reception by the literary world was cool, but the second version of 1879 is a rounded and satisfying <b>artistic</b> <b>product.</b>|$|R
