Instead, he used his criticism for the practical purpose of helping others to better read and understand literature. When it came to Shakespeare's plays, Johnson emphasised the role of the reader in understanding language: [...] "If Shakespeare has difficulties above other writers, it is to be imputed to the nature of his work, which required the use of common colloquial language, and consequently admitted many phrases allusive, elliptical, and proverbial, such <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>speak</b> and hear every hour without observing them".|$|E

The muscles concerned are markedly more innervated in humans than in nonhuman primates. Evidence from fossil hominins suggests that the necessary enlargement of the verterbral canal, and therefore spinal cord dimensions, may not have occurred in Australopithecus or Homo erectus [...] but was present in the Neanderthals and early modern humans.|$|E

[...] As former member Shawn Galbraith, banjo player, puts it: [...] "We play original material provided by different members of the band. There are some traditional elements to our sound for sure, but we always try to maintain some uniqueness." [...] "I don't think many people would call us a traditional oldtime band," [...] states bandleader David Sickmen: [...] "I'd say our songs are about ninety percent originals.

6000|$|It is {{perfectly}} obvious, therefore, that the localization {{of the pain}} at {{the surface of the}} body is an act of the mind. It is an extradition of that consciousness, which has its seat in the brain, to a definite point of the body--which takes place without our volition, and may give rise to ideas which are contrary to fact. We might call this extradition of consciousness a reflex feeling, just <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>speak</b> of a movement which is excited apart from, or contrary to, our volition, as a reflex motion.

But the common epithet of opprobrium is justly bestowed, and marks a right feeling. A wall has no business to be dead. It ought to have members in its make, and purposes in its existence, like an organized creature, and to answer its ends in a living and energetic way; and it is only when we do not choose to put any strength nor organization into it, that it offends us by its deadness. Every wall ought to be a [...] "sweet and lovely wall." [...] I do not care about its having ears; but, for instruction and exhortation, I would often have it to [...] "hold up its fingers."

The other example, less important but more ludicrous, is the silly boycott of Germans in England, extending even to German music. I do not believe for a moment that the English people feel any such insane fastidiousness. Are the English artists who practise the particularly English art of water-colour to be forbidden to use Prussian blue? Are all old ladies to shoot their Pomeranian dogs? But though England would laugh at this, she will get the credit of it, and will continue: until we ask who the actual persons are who feel sure that we should shudder at a ballad of the Rhine. It is certain that we should find they are capitalists. It is very probable that we should find they are foreigners.|$|E
