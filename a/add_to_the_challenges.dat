USEPA's analysis of nine pollinator field studies submitted concluded that three were invalid, so EPA {{did not use the}} data they provided in making its regulatory decision for clothianidin. EPA classified the remainder as supplemental, generally because Bayer AG conducted the studies without EPA first approving the protocols. Supplemental studies are ones that don't definitively answer uncertainties but still provide some data that might be useful in characterizing risk. Indicative of the rapid advance of regulators' understanding of pollinator science, USEPA first accepted one of the studies as sound science in 2007, then reclassified it as invalid in November 2010 only to reclassify it as supplemental one month later. The changes in EPA's classification of this study have no effect on the regulatory status for clothianidin in the U.S. because the study does not provide data with which EPA can legally justify altering its 2003 registration decision. An international group of pesticide regulators, researchers, industry representatives, and beekeepers is working to develop a study protocol that will definitively answer remaining questions about the potential long-term effects on bee colonies and other pollinators.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Anesthesiologists {{are faced}} with {{increasing}} numbers of elderly patients in their practice due to ageing population, especially in Western societies. Ageing is associated with physiologic changes that decrease the {{ability to respond to}} surgical and disease-related stress. Moreover, elderly patients suffer from significant co-morbidities including diseases of cardiovascular and pulmonary system. Both of these factors <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenges</b> of anesthetic care in this patient population. Lastly, chronological age alone is an inadequate predictor of the response expected in an individual patient (the paradox of the “old ” 65 year-old vs. a “young ” 85 year-old patient). In our review we discuss the physiologic changes of ageing and write about most frequent or significant co-morbidities of old age and their effects on the anesthetic choice. We further review sedative and anesthetic agents, pain medications and other adjunct medications, which may result in important, potentially detrimental consequences for the elderly patient...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Action {{recognition}} {{on large}} categories of unconstrained videos {{taken from the}} web is a very challenging problem compared to datasets like KTH (six actions), IXMAS (thirteen actions), and Weizmann (ten actions). Challenges like camera motion, different viewpoints, large interclass variations, cluttered background, occlusions, bad illumination conditions, and poor quality of web videos cause {{the majority of the}} state-ofthe-art action recognition approaches to fail. Also, an increased number of categories and the inclusion of actions with high confusion, <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenges.</b> In this paper we propose using the scene context information obtained from moving and stationary pixels in the key frames, in conjunction with motion features, to solve the action recognition problem on a large (50 actions) dataset with videos from the web. We perform a combination of early and late fusion on multiple features to handle the very large number of categories. We demonstrate that scene context is a very important feature to perform action recognition on very large datasets. The proposed method does not require any kind of video stabilization, person detection, or tracking and pruning of features. Our approach gives good performance on a large number of action categories; it has been tested on the UCF 50 dataset with 50 action categories, which is an extension of the UCF YouTube Ac...|$|E

40|$|Traumatic {{brain injury}} (TBI) affects {{thousands}} of people in South Africa. Our knowledge regarding this phenomenon has expanded rapidly and the problematic psychological wellbeing of persons who have been injured through TBI has been well documented. When reviewing the published literature regarding TBI {{it would appear that the}} majority originate from a positivist epistemology, quantitative methodology, and focus mainly on cognitive and/or motor ability changes of the injured individual. Furthermore, literature regarding interaction between the injured person and others tend to focus on uninjured family members’ experience of and adaptation to the injured person – generally ignoring the injured person’s experience of others. This study addressed this gap in the literature by making use of a qualitative research design to explore how injured persons' experience of others might contribute to the challenges, other than those related to cognitive and physical changes, persons face following TBI. Specifically, this study investigated whether themes that suggest a "loss of self" could be identified in the narratives of the participants' experiences of others. While not being able to support the idea of “loss of self” in the participants' narratives, there are indications that experiences of others may <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenges</b> injured persons face following TBI.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Fulminant hepatic {{failure is}} a serious disease with {{significant}} mortality and morbidity. Identifying the exact cause of hepatic failure and predicting prognosis {{is of paramount importance}} in managing such patients. Drug-induced liver injury is a common but challenging entity to treat. The use of newer drugs and medications with previously unknown hepatotoxicity <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenges</b> faced by treating physicians. Quetiapine is an antipsychotic that has rarely been linked to acute liver injury. In the present work we describe a case of fulminant hepatic failure secondary to use of quetiapine. Case presentation A 59 -year-old Caucasian woman with known Parkinson’s disease was being treated with quetiapine for hallucinations. She was referred to our hospital with yellow discoloration of the sclera and later on developed clinical features suggestive of hepatic encephalopathy. A diagnosis of fulminant hepatic failure was made following her admission to the intensive care unit. Her condition improved after discontinuing the drug and providing the standard supportive treatment. Conclusions Our findings in the present report emphasize the importance of keeping an open mind in cases of fulminant hepatic failure. As drug-induced hepatotoxicity is {{the most common cause of}} fulminant hepatic failure in many parts of the world, consideration should be given to the medication(s) patients receive as the potential cause and a review of this list should be part of the clinical care given. </p...|$|E
