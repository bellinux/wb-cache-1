500|$|Doby {{experienced}} many prejudices {{during his}} time before, during, and after the majors. One incident took place during a game as Doby was sliding into second base when the shortstop from the opposing team spat tobacco juice on him. Doby called it the worst injustice he experienced on the field. He endured many racial slurs, from the stands and elsewhere, during games. He also received death threats. After he had retired as a player, Doby recalled memories of {{his days as a}} barrier-breaker. [...] "You know why I hit so well in Washington and St. Louis? They were major Jim Crow seating parks <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> to bat, I knew where the noise was coming from and who was making it. I felt like a quarterback with 5,000 cheerleaders calling his name. You know most of them couldn't afford to be there. I never forgot them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Siegel: That {{occurred}} to me in late 1934, when I decided that I'd like to do Superman as a newspaper strip. [...] I approached Joe about it, and he was enthusiastic about the possibility. [...] I was up late one night, {{and more and more}} ideas kept coming to me, and I kept writing out several weeks of syndicate strips for the proposed newspaper strip. [...] When morning came, I had written several weeks of material, and I dashed over to Joe's place and showed it to him. (This was the story that appeared in Action Comics #1, June, 1938, the first published appearance of Superman.) [...] Of course, Joe had worked on that earlier version of Superman, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> to him with this new version of it, he was immediately sold." [...] They made Clark Kent a journalist who pretends to be timid, and introduced his colleague Lois Lane, who is attracted to the bold and mighty Superman, but does not realize he and Kent are the same person.|$|E

2500|$|The opera {{historian}} Harold Rosenthal {{wrote of}} the Moody-Manners company: [...] "With the Carl Rosa company, it was the principal training ground for British artists {{in the years before}} World War I." [...] Manners held strong views about the training given by British music academies to young singers. In his view students were not equipped for a professional career because they were trained in the principal operatic roles rather than in the chorus parts, which almost all singers new to the profession would need to sing before being promoted to leading roles. He instanced his own early career: [...] "I studied both at the Royal Academy, Dublin, and the Royal Academy, London, and then in Italy, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> back to London, all I could get was an engagement in comic opera where I sang for eighteen months before I could become a principal. It was not till over six years after I left my studies that I found anything I had learnt at the academies of any value to me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Crazy Horse spoke {{this story}} to Flying Hawk: ‘I {{was sitting on a}} hill or rise, and {{something}} touched me on the head. [...] I felt for it and found {{it was a bit of}} grass. I took it to look at. [...] There was a trail nearby and I followed it. [...] It led to water. [...] I went into the water. There the trail ended and I sat down in the water. [...] I was nearly out of breath. I started to rise out of the water, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> out I was born by my mother. When I was born I could know and see and understand for a time, but afterwards went back to it as a baby. [...] Then I grew up naturally. [...] At the age of seven I began to learn, and when twelve began to fight enemies. That was the reason I always refused to wear any war-dress. [...] Only a bit of grass in the hair. [...] That was why I always was successful in battles. The first fight was with the Shoshones. The Shoshones were chasing the Sioux. [...] I, with my younger brother riding double. [...] Two of the Shoshones came for us. [...] We started to meet them. [...] I killed one of them and took his horse. [...] We jumped on him, my brother and I double, and escaped." ...|$|E
