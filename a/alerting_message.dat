40|$|Alerting the {{population}} during crisis using available communication systems can {{significantly reduce the}} impact of emergency situations. However, {{the understanding of the}} alert and trust by recipients is influenced by the <b>alert</b> <b>message</b> content and style.

40|$|Abstract — In today’s world, {{having a}} {{reliable}} communica-tion system during emergency situations is {{of paramount importance}} to lessen the impact of the disasters. This paper proposes an emergency communication technique which is enabled by ATSC DTV transmitter identification (TxID) watermark signal. Theoretical and simulation results show that ATSC TxID watermark signal can reach a larger coverage area than the 8 -VSB DTV signal and hence can be used to enable emergency communication during na-tional disastrous situations. The coverage for this emergency communication system is predicted using popular Hata-Davidson propagation model and coverage maps clearly showing the extended and overlapped coverage for DTV stations in Huron and Stratford area in the province of Ontario, Canada is presented. Comparison with other existing emergency communication systems is carried out and performance matrices such as <b>alerting</b> <b>message</b> error rate, required no. of stations, network reliability etc. are evaluated to assess the robustness of the proposed emergency communication system.

40|$|International audienceICT {{components}} of vehicular and transportation systems have {{a crucial role}} in ensuring passengers’ safety, particularly in the scenario of vehicular networks. Hence, security concerns should not be overlooked, since a malicious vehicle might inject false information into the intervehicle wireless links, leading to life and money losses. This is even more critical when considering applications specifically aimed at improving people’s safety, such as accident warning systems. To assess the scenario of such type of applications in a vehicular network, we have performed a thorough evaluation of accident warning systems under a position cheating attack. As one of the main contributions of this paper, we determine the impact of a different number of malicious vehicles on delaying the <b>alert</b> warning <b>messages.</b> In particular, we study the impact of the position of malicious vehicles on delaying <b>alert</b> <b>messages.</b> We identify the most effective strategies that could be used by malicious vehicles in order to maximize the delay of the <b>alert</b> <b>message,</b> and thus strengthen the impact of the attacker. Finally, we pinpoint that even with a small number of malicious vehicles, the positioning cheating attack can significantly increase the delay of the <b>alert</b> <b>message</b> when compared to a scenario without attack...|$|R
