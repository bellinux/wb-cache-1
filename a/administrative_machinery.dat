5|$|After 1066, William did {{not attempt}} to {{integrate}} his separate domains into one unified realm with one set of laws. His seal from after 1066, of which six impressions still survive, was made for him after he conquered England and stressed his role as king, while separately mentioning his role as Duke. When in Normandy, William acknowledged that he owed fealty to the French king, but in England no such acknowledgement was made– further evidence that the various parts of William's lands were considered separate. The <b>administrative</b> <b>machinery</b> of Normandy, England, and Maine continued to exist separate from the other lands, with each one retaining its own forms. For example, England continued the use of writs, which were not known on the continent. Also, the charters and documents produced for the government in Normandy differed in formulas from those produced in England.|$|E
5|$|Nasir al-Dawla {{was heavily}} criticized by contemporaries for his oppressive fiscal {{policies}} and the suffering they caused among the population. The traveller Ibn Hawqal, who visited Nasir al-Dawla's domains, reports in length on his seizure of private land in the most fertile regions of the Jazira, on flimsy legal charges, until he became the greatest landowner in his province. This was linked with the practice of a monoculture of cereals, destined to feed the growing population of Baghdad, and coupled with heavy taxation, so that Sayf al-Dawla and Nasir al-Dawla {{are said to have}} become the wealthiest princes in the Muslim world. Nevertheless, the Hamdanid <b>administrative</b> <b>machinery</b> seems to have been fairly rudimentary, and the tribute paid to the Buyids—estimated at somewhere between two and four million dirhams, when it was paid at all—was a heavy burden on the treasury.|$|E

25|$|However, the {{situation}} of the 16th century favored soldiers, because the kingdom was in almost constant external warfare and kings trusted their military officers much more than other nobles, also when building <b>administrative</b> <b>machineries.</b> Soldier nobility gained even some improvements to their position and wealth, whereas in general the noble class and its privileges were decreasing in importance during the harsh early Vasa kings. Soldier nobles from Finland benefited from this development.|$|R
40|$|Since the 1970 s public {{administration}} institutions {{as a research}} domain has increasingly opened up to contributions from other social sciences such as history, political science and sociology of organizations. It has become less normative and more empirical, considering institutions as dependent variables as well as autonomous actors. New schools of thought have emerged in academic circles. Institutional theory is a label that oversimplifies {{the fact that such}} schools are not exactly alike: they do not share the same agenda. The present chapter presents four of such streams: historical institutionalism, sociological institutionalism, new institutionalism, and local order or actor institutionalism. Each develops a more or less specific set of theoretical as well as empirically grounded interpretations. Each also covers major facets of what institutionalization processes are. Political and <b>administrative</b> <b>machineries</b> experience path dependencies. They are embedded in societal environments. They function like specific social systems. They produce social norms and cognitive references. Therefore interactions between societal change and administrative reform become key issues. HISTORICAL INSTITUTIONALIS...|$|R
5|$|By 1169 Coutances held a canonry in Rouen Cathedral. During the 1170s a {{group of}} royal clerks rose to prominence, among them Coutances, Walter Map, Ralph Diceto, John of Oxford, Richard of Ilchester, and Geoffrey Ridel. Coutances was the {{chaplain}} to Henry the Young King, eldest living son of King Henry, but when the younger Henry rebelled against his father in 1173, Coutances returned to King Henry's service. He became Archdeacon of Oxford, perhaps by 1173, certainly by 14 March 1176. He was named vice-chancellor when Ralph de Warneville became Chancellor of England, which occurred in 1173. In 1176 and 1177, King Henry sent Coutances on diplomatic missions to Flanders and the French royal court. Arnulf, the Bishop of Lisieux, alleged that Henry allowed Coutances to use all the <b>administrative</b> <b>machinery</b> of Normandy to drive Arnulf from his diocese, so that Coutances might become bishop there. This happened in early 1178, but the only real evidence for this effort on Coutances' part comes from Arnulf's correspondence, and as Coutances was back in England by July 1178, {{it does not appear}} that the attempt was a sustained one.|$|E
5|$|The {{integration}} of the princely states {{raised the question of}} the future of the remaining colonial enclaves in India. At independence, the regions of Pondicherry, Karikal, Yanam, Mahe and Chandernagore were still colonies of France, and Daman and Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Goa remained colonies of Portugal. An agreement between France and India in 1948 provided for an election in France's remaining Indian possessions to choose their political future. A plebiscite held in Chandernagore on 19 June 1949 resulted in a vote of 7,463 to 114 in favour of being integrated with India. It was ceded to India on a de facto basis on 14 August 1949 and de jure on 2 May 1950. In the other enclaves, however, the pro-French camp, led by Edouard Goubert, used the <b>administrative</b> <b>machinery</b> to suppress the pro-merger groups. Popular discontent rose, and in 1954 demonstrations in Yanam and Mahe resulted in pro-merger groups assuming power. A referendum in Pondicherry and Karaikal in October 1954 resulted in a vote in favour of merger, and on 1 November 1954, de facto control over all four enclaves was transferred to the Republic of India. A treaty of cession was signed in May 1956, and following ratification by the French National Assembly in May 1962, de jure control of the enclaves was also transferred.|$|E

500|$|Merging the <b>administrative</b> <b>machineries</b> of {{each state}} and {{integrating}} them into one political and administrative entity was not easy, particularly {{as many of}} the merged states had a history of rivalry. In the former Central India Agency, whose princely states had initially been merged into a princely union called Vindhya Pradesh, the rivalry between two groups of states became so bad that the Government of India persuaded the rulers to sign a Merger Agreement abrogating the old Covenants of Merger, and took direct control of the state as a Chief Commissioner's State. As such, the mergers did not meet the expectations of the Government of India or the States Department. In December 1947, Menon suggested requiring the rulers of states to take [...] "practical steps towards the establishment of popular government". The States Department accepted his suggestion, and implemented it through a special covenant signed by the rajpramukhs of the merged princely unions, binding them to act as constitutional monarchs. This meant that their powers were de facto no {{different from those of the}} Governors of the former British provinces, thus giving the people of their territories the same measure of responsible government as the people of the rest of India.|$|R
40|$|Considerable {{territorial}} differentiation {{existing in}} Russia today contributes to both federal and regional economic slowdown. Alongside with that, gaining {{control over the}} process of territorial differentiation at the micro-level {{in order to reduce}} disparity among rural municipalities and to ensure their sustainable development, is considerably hindered, taking into account the gap between the tasks local self-governing bodies have to accomplish and the financial resources at their disposal. Territorial transformation of municipal entities (regional rural settlements) may become one of the possible solutions to the problem. That would make it possible to optimize local <b>administrative</b> <b>machineries,</b> to reduce imbalance and disparity in economic development of rural municipalities and to channel the funds released towards the vital problems of local significance. However, the problem of preliminary comparison of socio-economic development rates of municipal entities within a region, which is required for further successful implementation of strategies of rural territorial transformations, still remains unsolved, since currently no generally acknowledged and scientifically based specific methods for that purpose are available. As the result of the theoretical and practical research work carried out by the author, the article presents the territorial transformation procedure algorithm and proposes the model to evaluate synergistic effect of the activities intended to foster optimization of territorial structure of rural areas...|$|R
25|$|As a result, when Russia conquered Finland, no {{particularly}} powerful {{class of}} nobility still inhabited it. They were generally just modestly propertied (or sometimes outright impoverished) families with traditions for {{serving in the}} military and/or administration at regular levels, and to create careers starting from junior positions. This was enormously helpful for Emperors to create a functioning <b>administrative</b> <b>machinery,</b> and to have a loyal country. There simply were no powerful magnates to foment feudal rebellion, or to disrupt the building of a bureaucratic state by their important privileges.|$|E
500|$|The government, {{at higher}} levels, was closely {{modelled}} after the Magadhan and Satavahana <b>administrative</b> <b>machinery.</b> The empire {{was divided into}} Maharashtrakas (provinces), then into smaller Rashtrakas (Mandala), Vishaya (district), Bhoga (group of 10 villages) {{which is similar to}} the Dasagrama unit used by the Kadambas. At the lower levels of administration, the Kadamba style prevailed fully. The Sanjan plates of VikramadityaI even mentions a land unit called Dasagrama. In addition to imperial provinces, there were autonomous regions ruled by feudatories such as the Alupas, the Gangas, the Banas and the Sendrakas. Local assemblies and guilds looked after local issues. Groups of mahajanas (learned brahmins) looked after agraharas (called ghatika or [...] "place of higher learning") such as at Badami which was served by 2000 mahajans and Aihole which was served by 500 mahajanas. Taxes were levied and were called the herjunka– tax on loads, the kirukula– tax on retail goods in transit, the bilkode– sales tax, the pannaya– betel tax, siddaya– land tax and the vaddaravula– tax levied to support royalty.|$|E
500|$|From October 1455, Devon and {{his sons}} were {{committing}} acts of social disorder, seemingly intending to disrupt the <b>administrative</b> <b>machinery</b> of the county (of which Bonville, of course, was a part), for instance by preventing the local justices of the peace from holding quarterly sessions by force; they then proceeded to raise a small army at Tiverton {{under the leadership of}} Devon's eldest son, Thomas Courtenay. It was this force that was to be guilty of what R. L. Storey has called [...] "the most notorious private crime of the century," [...] due not only to the violence involved but {{the fact that it was}} [...] "so obviously premeditated." [...] This force made its way to Upcott on 23 October 1455, the home of Nicholas Radford, a close associate and legal advisor to Bonville, and a respected member of the community who had previously been recorder of the city of Exeter and member of parliament. Storey has suggested that being an experienced lawyer, he was most probably targeted by Devon {{and his sons}} for the very reason that he had aided Bonville's escape from Devon's litigation in the past; and in January 1455 he had enfeoffed Bonville (and others) for land valued at £400.|$|E
40|$|The {{adoption}} in June 2008 by the European Parliament of the Directive on Return consolidates {{the process of}} involution that human rights have been suffering in the EU since the fear of illegal immigration has developed deep roots in its institutions. While {{the laws of the}} eighties regarding foreigners already contained rules governing detention and expulsion, it is not until Directive 2001 / 40 /EC that the communitarian policy focused on illegal immigration and the expulsion of migrants begins to take shape. The return measures are, as the European Commission said, “a cornerstone of immigration policy in the EU”. Since then, the barbarism of the internment and detention centres, the erosion of rights, the exclusion and criminalization of foreign migrants, have become the battle flag of the associations defending human rights. The erosion that these laws and expulsion measures are causing to the rights and freedoms and to the Constitutional State and its institutions is immense. The decline and erosion in the rights and freedoms is so great that one can no longer talk about Constitutional States in the EU, but rather about <b>administrative</b> <b>machineries</b> for the internment and deportation, and in this way, about “expelling States”(1), where foreign people are treated as “semi-persons” (2) and even as “non-persons”(3). ...|$|R

They waited, and are now waiting the result with the liveliest interest and curiosity. Meanwhile the riots happened in Rawalpindi, in Lahore. After these riots broke out, what was the course we ought to take? Some in this country lean to the opinion--and it is excusable--that riots ought to suspend all suggestions and talk of reform. Sir, His Majesty's Government considered this view, and in the end they took, very determinedly, the opposite view. They held that such a withdrawal would, of course, have been construed as a triumph for the party of sedition.
