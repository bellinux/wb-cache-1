5|$|Fomepizole is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of alcohol dehydrogenase; similar to ethanol, it acts to block {{the formation of the}} toxic metabolites. Fomepizole {{has been shown to be}} highly effective as an <b>antidote</b> for ethylene glycol poisoning. It is the only <b>antidote</b> approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ethylene glycol poisoning. Both antidotes have advantages and disadvantages. Ethanol is readily available in most hospitals, is inexpensive, and can be administered orally as well as intravenously. Its adverse effects include intoxication, hypoglycemia in children, and possible liver toxicity. Patients receiving ethanol therapy also require frequent blood ethanol concentration measurements and dosage adjustments to maintain a therapeutic ethanol concentration. Patients therefore must be monitored in an intensive care unit. Alternatively, the adverse side effects of fomepizole are minimal and the approved dosing regimen maintains therapeutic concentrations without the need to monitor blood concentrations of the drug. The disadvantage of fomepizole is that it is expensive. Costing US$1,000 per gram, an average course used in an adult poisoning would cost approximately $3,500 to $4,000. Despite the cost, fomepizole is gradually replacing ethanol as the <b>antidote</b> of choice in ethylene glycol poisoning. Adjunct agents including thiamine and pyridoxine are often given, because they may help prevent the formation of oxalic acid. The use of these agents is based on theoretical observations and there is limited evidence to support their use in treatment; they may be of particular benefit in people who could be deficient in these vitamins such as malnourished or alcoholic patients.|$|E

International guidelines were used as the basis for selecting 41 <b>antidotes</b> for analysis, none of which currently protected by patents. Of these, 27 are registered in Brazil, but 11 of these are available in inadequate forms for treating poisoning, leaving 16 commercially available <b>antidotes.</b> Only one-third of the drugs needed for treating poisoning are included in the country's list of essential drugs. The article also presents a proposal for supplying the demand for one of the <b>antidotes,</b> anti-digoxin antibody, considering Brazil's domestic capacity for manufacturing immunobiologicals. The study's results show the limitations to adequate treatment for poison victims in Brazil and reinforce the urgent need to strengthen public policies in this area...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the relationship between}} dispositions and ceteris paribus laws. Dispositions are related to conditionals. Typically a fragile glass will break if struck with force. But possession of the disposition does not entail the corresponding simple (subjunctive or counterfactual) conditional. The phenomena of finks and <b>antidotes</b> show that an object may possess the disposition without the conditional being true. Finks and <b>antidotes</b> may {{be thought of as}} exceptions to the straightforward relation between disposition and conditional. The existence of these phenomena are easy to demonstrate at the macro-level. But do they exist at the fundamental level also? While fundamental finkish dispositions may be excluded fairly straight-forwardly, the existence of fundamental <b>antidotes</b> is more open. Nonetheless I conclude that the phenomenon is likely to be less widespread than at the macro level and that fundamental <b>antidotes</b> may be eliminable. According to the dispositional essentialist, the laws of nature can be explained by taking natural properties to be essentially dispositional. This account can be extended to show that the existence of finks and <b>antidotes</b> explains ceteris paribus laws. Consequently the existence or otherwise of fundamental finks and <b>antidotes</b> sheds some light {{on the question of whether}} fundamental laws may also be ceteris paribus laws...|$|R
