50|$|The {{elements}} of the RSS vocabulary are not generally reusable in other XML vocabularies.

5000|$|Users could {{subscribe}} to feeds using either Google Reader's search function, or by entering {{in the exact}} URL of the RSS or <b>Atom</b> <b>feed.</b> New posts from those feeds were then shown on the left-hand side of the screen.

50|$|PuSH is a {{protocol}} {{that relies on}} webhooks to push feed updates in real-time from publishers to subscribers in a decentralized manner. PuSH builds on existing protocols, ensuring that polling infrastructures currently in use are not changed or broken on implementation, and that polling is still available as a back-up.

50|$|On June 10, 2009 the phpBB Development Team {{broke with}} their {{precedent}} of keeping future development plans under wraps and publicly previewed {{a series of}} new features that would be coming in phpBB 3.0.6. After four RC releases, phpBB 3.0.6 was released on November 17. The most notable new features included a bare-bones quick reply editor (a feature which the teams had historically been firmly opposed to), support for ACM (cache) plugins, <b>ATOM</b> <b>feed</b> support, and a plugin-based CAPTCHA system, including built-in support for reCAPTCHA among others. The modularization of phpBB's CAPTCHA also provided an API for MOD authors to write CAPTCHA plugins, allowing for greater diversification of the CAPTCHAs used in phpBB installations. The Extensions Team also ran a competition to encourage CAPTCHA plugin development.|$|E

40|$|In {{some areas}} of science, {{sophisticated}} web services and semantics underlie "cyberinfrastructure". However, in "small science" domains, especially in field sciences such as archaeology, conservation, and public health, datasets often resist standardization. Publishing data in the small sciences should embrace this diversity rather than attempt to corral research into "universal" (domain) standards. A growing ecosystem of increasingly powerful Web syndication based approaches for sharing data on the public Web can offer a viable approach. <b>Atom</b> <b>Feed</b> based services {{can be used with}} scientific collections to identify and create linkages across different datasets, even across disciplinary boundaries without shared domain standards...|$|E
40|$|The setup of and {{processing}} within sensor networks often requires sophisticated and specialized system designs and implementations, but the service provided by them {{should be as}} accessible and repurposable as possible. If {{the increasing number of}} available sensor-based data sources can be accessed in a simple and universal way, the network effect of aggregating, filtering, and republishing data from these sources will significantly increase their value. We propose an architecture where sensor-based data sources publish their data based on feeds, but extended with query capabilities. Using the well-known and widely supported <b>Atom</b> <b>feed</b> format and extending it with query capabilities allows us to lower the barrier-of-entry to sensor-based data sources, opening this data to a wider audience of clients...|$|E
