5|$|During the 1920 {{election}} campaign, Taft {{supported the}} Republican ticket, Harding (by then a senator) and Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge; they were elected. Taft {{was among those}} asked {{to come to the}} president-elect's home in Marion, Ohio to advise him on appointments, and the two men conferred there on December 24, 1920. By Taft's later account, after some conversation, Harding casually asked if Taft would accept appointment to the Supreme Court, for if Taft would, Harding would put him there. Taft had a condition for Harding: that having been president, and having appointed two of the present associate justices and opposed Brandeis, he could only accept the chief justiceship. Harding made no response, and Taft in <b>a</b> <b>thank-you</b> note reiterated the condition and stated that Chief Justice White had often told him he was keeping the position for Taft until a Republican held the White House. In January 1921, Taft heard through intermediaries that Harding planned to appoint him, if given the chance.|$|E

During the Revolutionary War George Washington paid a visit due to the church's strong support for the Patriot cause, and wrote <b>a</b> <b>thank-you</b> note {{exhibited}} in the church today. An annual dinner is held to commemorate the visit. George H. Sharpe raised a Civil War regiment at the church, and later erected a monument in the churchyard to those volunteers. Franklin Delano Roosevelt and members of the Dutch royal family, among other notables, have visited the church. It has also been the site of memorials to tragedy from the assassination of William McKinley to September 11, 2001.|$|E
25|$|In the woods, Belle is {{attacked}} by wolves {{and is only}} rescued when the Beast comes to her aid, but he is injured during the fight and collapses ("Entr'acte/Wolf Chase"). Instead of taking the chance to run home Belle helps {{him back to the}} castle. She cleans his injuries and after a brief argument about whose fault this is, the Beast thanks her for her kindness and thus their friendship is born. Wanting to give her <b>a</b> <b>thank-you</b> gift, the Beast gives Belle his huge library, which excites her. She notes a change in the Beast's personality as the servants note a change in Belle and the Beast's relationship ("Something There"). They express their hope of being human once more ("Human Again") while Belle asks the Beast to accompany her to dinner that night.|$|E
25|$|Though Senna's consistency, the car's {{competitiveness}} and the Williams's unreliability {{at the beginning}} of the season gave him an early advantage, Senna insisted that Honda step up their engine development program and demanded further improvements to the car before it was too late. These modifications enabled him to make a late-season push, and he won three more races to secure the championship, which was settled in Japan when Mansell (who needed to win), went off at the first corner while running third and beached his Williams in the gravel trap. Senna finished second, handing the victory to teammate Gerhard Berger at the last corner as <b>a</b> <b>thank-you</b> gesture for his support over the season. Senna was planning to move to the Williams team for the 1992 season, but Honda's CEO, Nobuhiko Kawamoto, personally requested that he remain at McLaren-Honda, which Senna did out of a sense of loyalty.|$|E

40|$|A random {{assignment}} experiment {{examined the}} effects of three expressions of gratitude on two prosocial behaviors: volunteering and making monetary donations to charitable organizations. The results indicated that two of the expressions of gratitude had a significant opposite effect on the two prosocial behaviors. Both <b>a</b> verbal <b>thank-you</b> speech and <b>a</b> hand written <b>thank-you</b> note, resulted in a significant reduction in the amount of pledged volunteer hours, while resulting in {{a significant increase in the}} amount of pledged charitable dollars. The third expression of gratitude, <b>a</b> ten dollar <b>thank-you</b> gift card, produced no significant findings for either prosocial behavior. The results of the experiment indicate that while volunteering and donating to charity are both prosocial behaviors, they each represent a different exchange relationship; volunteering, a social exchange and donating to charity, a market exchange. Each exchange is governed by a different set of norms and expectations. Violating these norms and expectations result in negative impacts on the prosocial behavior outcomes...|$|R

25|$|Ambre had sung Carmen in the Netherlands {{early in}} her career and during the 1879–1880 Mapleson tour, {{but she had never}} sung it in France. The opera had not been seen in Paris since its world premiere at the Opéra-Comique in 1875, {{although}} it had several subsequent stagings in the French provinces. Keen to perform it in Paris, she asked Manet to write his friend Antonin Proust and urge him to pressure the Opéra-Comique to revive it for her. A Paris revival with Ambre never happened, but she did sing the role again on her 1880–1881 American tour. Scholars differ as to whether the portrait was done at Ambre's request or as <b>a</b> <b>thank-you</b> gesture from Manet for having organized the exhibition of The Execution of Emperor Maximilian the previous year. During the late summer of 1880 Manet wrote to Eva Gonzalès that he would be working on the painting every day as Ambre was leaving for America that October. However, the portrait remained in the artist's possession. It was in the inventory of works inherited by Manet's widow Suzanne on his death in 1883.|$|E

On 31 July, the appeals court overturned Richards' conviction, and Jagger's sentence was reduced to a conditional discharge. Jones' trial took place in November 1967; in December, after appealing the original prison sentence, Jones received a £1,000 fine and was put on three years' probation, with an order to seek professional help.|$|E

[...] He has also served as something of an unofficial baseball ambassador to the African-American community, often participating in and initiating dialogue about the lack of black players {{at all levels of the}} sport.

Bart steps in and uses his skills at stalling debt collectors to save the day, pleasing Lisa who had previously been mad at her brother. As <b>a</b> <b>thank-you,</b> Bart asks Lisa to [...] "legalize it", and Lisa says she will. Meanwhile, Homer has heard about gold buried by Abraham Lincoln {{on the grounds of the}} White House and starts a search for it.

Lisa finds Bart and tells him that the family has been kicked out of the casino after Homer pushed a waitress and Marge lost $20,000.

500|$|The {{cover sleeve}} and images were shot by Ellen von Unwerth. The cover was {{released}} by Jive Records on October 12, 2007. It features Spears sporting black hair and wearing a pink (blue in the rear cover) dress, and a white fedora. A reviewer for the Ottawa Citizen felt the design was [...] "horrendous". The centerfold pictures feature Spears and a priest in suggestive poses in a confessional. The first image shows Spears, who wears a cross and fishnet stockings, sitting on the priest's lap, while in the second one she leans suggestively against the confessional with the priest sitting {{on the other side}} of the partition. After the album was released, the Catholic League's director of communications Kiera McCaffrey stated that the group considered the photos a [...] "cheap publicity stunt" [...] to promote the album and condemned Spears for [...] "mocking a Catholic sacrament". McCaffrey added: [...] "All we see is how troubled this girl is now, especially with her family, losing her kids, with her career on a downward slide. And now she's put out this album and this is her tactic to promote it?" [...] Gil Kaufman of MTV said that the images were reminiscent of Madonna's music video for [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] (1989). The booklet also contains pictures of empty chairs with ripped tabloid pages and still images from the music video for [...] "Gimme More". The album doesn't include <b>a</b> <b>thank-you</b> list, unlike her previous albums.|$|E
500|$|The book {{is divided}} into six chapters: It begins with author Alina Simone walking around Bay City, Michigan and pondering why {{there was not a}} single {{commemoration}} to be found in the city about Madonna, who was born there. Simone's research began from that point and the essay continues analyzing Bay City and its culture. In the next chapter the author moves on to talk about 1980s music, Madonna's contribution and popularity after the release of albums, Like a Virgin (1984) and True Blue (1986). One of the questions reiterated by Simone is about the singer's legacy and what would happen to her wealth and fortune after her death, seeing that Madonna was not receiving the respect she deserved. With this in mind, Simone talks about how pop culture has moved from one fad to another, and her analysis of the musical landscape in Bay City. In the last chapter titled as Flying Wedge, the author reviews hard rock music and the punk rock bands of the city, and finally how relentless artists can be to produce music. She researches the one-hit wonder bands like Question Mark and the Mysterians—best known for [...] "96 Tears"—and Flying Wedge, a Detroit band that released their record through Creem magazine in 1972 but disappeared. The author ends the book on a happy note that whether Madonna is remembered or not in her hometown, her musical outputs would never be forgotten. Final chapters are devoted to an epilogue about Simone's writing of the book and <b>a</b> <b>thank-you</b> section.|$|E
