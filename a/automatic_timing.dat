5|$|The {{finish of}} a race {{is marked by a}} white line 5cm wide. The {{finishing}} position of athletes is determined by the order in which any part of their torso (as distinguished from the head, neck, arms, legs, hands or feet) reaches the vertical plane of the nearer edge of the finish line. Fully <b>automatic</b> <b>timing</b> systems (photo timing) {{are becoming more and more}} common at increasingly lower levels of track meets, improving the accuracy, while eliminating the need for eagle-eyed officials on the finish line. Fully <b>automatic</b> <b>timing</b> (FAT) is required for high level meets and any time a (sprint) record is set (though distance records can be accepted if timed by three independent stopwatches).|$|E
25|$|The men's Olympic Trials {{were held}} at Stanford Stadium on July 15 and July 16. In track events, hand timing {{was used as the}} primary timing method, while Gustavus Kirby's <b>automatic</b> <b>timing</b> device was used secondarily. Official world records were set by Jack Keller in the 110 m hurdles and by Bill Graber in the pole vault. In addition, Joe McCluskey set an unratified world best in the 3000 m steeplechase, and (as nearly all top {{competitions}} until then had been only hand-timed) several athletes set world automatic-time bests.|$|E
25|$|The {{best time}} for the 100m set during Olympic {{competition}} {{is known as the}} Olympic record. To count as an official record, the race and the equipment used must adhere to IAAF international rules. Hand-timed results were the standard until 1975, when fully <b>automatic</b> <b>timing</b> (FAT) became the preferred method for officially measuring athletes' times. Further to this wind conditions must be measured and any time achieved with a wind speed of over 2.0 metres per second in a direction behind the athlete is treated as wind-assisted and cannot be taken for an Olympic record mark.|$|E

25|$|At these championships, {{there was}} an <b>automatic</b> <b>timing</b> system that was both on the slalom canoer's bib and on the course itself. There were a total of ten antennas on the course that once an {{electronic}} marker in a canoer's bib approaches an antenna, it triggered video camera and timing controls. These course antennas were located at the start line, the finish line, and eight points in between. This system was used as video feed for the championships. It was an automatic system that times in the 1/100ths of a second and is uploadable on any Windows or Mac computer.|$|E

50|$|Different {{versions}} of the sprint results were published, because the fully <b>automatic</b> electronic <b>timing</b> system was malfunctioning. The first version displayed below on the left hand side was officially {{used to determine the}} athletes qualifying for the finals (best times, q). Later, there was a second version (not displayed). In December 1988, British statistician Richard Hymans published a revised version for the IAAF and the ATFS where many times were corrected. These numbers are displayed below in parentheses. Finally, {{there were a couple of}} hand timing results (Heat 1, 110m hurdles men, Heat 1 and 2 200m women; also displayed below in parentheses), because the officials noticed a defect in the electronic timing system during the event.|$|R
40|$|The framespace {{interpolation}} algorithm abstracts motion sequences as 1 D signals, and interpolates {{between them}} to create higher dimension signals, with weights drawn from a user specified curve in a bounded region. We reformulate the algorithm to achieve motion-state based transition via dynamic warping of framespaces and <b>automatic</b> transition <b>timing</b> via framespace frequency interpolation. Basis motions displaying diverse coordination configurations between upper and lower body-halves, cannot be consistently corresponded at a macro level. We address this problem here, through decoupled blending of these halves to achieve true consistency, and eliminate accumulated phase differences via cosine phase warp functions. This generalization enables interpolation of motions with diverse coordinations between {{the upper and lower}} bodies...|$|R

40|$|Motion capture (MOCAP) data clips can be visualized as a {{sequence}} of densely spaced curves, defining the joint angles of the articulated figure, over a specified period of time. Current research has focussed on frequency and time domain techniques to edit these curves, preserving the original qualities of the motion yet making it reusable in different spatio-temporal situations. We refine Guo et. al. 's[6] framespace interpolation algorithm which abstracts motion sequences as 1 D signals, and interpolates between them to create higher dimension signals. Our method is more suitable for (though not limited to) editing densely spaced MOCAP data, than the existing algorithm.

40|$|Different {{methods of}} extracting speech {{features}} from an auditory model were systematically investigated {{in terms of}} their robustness to different noises. The methods either computed the average firing rate within frequency channels (spectral features) or inter-spike-intervals (timing features) from the simulated auditory nerve response. When used as the front-end for an <b>automatic</b> speech recognizer, <b>timing</b> features outperformed spectral features in Gaussian noise. However, this advantage was lost in babble, because timing features extracted the spectro-temporal structure of babble noise, which is similar to the target speaker. This suggests that different feature extraction methods are optimal depending on the background noise...|$|R

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that normal aging may produce declines in some motor tasks but not others. One {{account of the}} task-specific aging effects suggests that age-related differences will be evident in tasks that demand high-level processing but not in tasks that can be performed relatively automatically. To test this hypothesis we compared the performance of young and older adults on two bimanual circle drawing tasks that utilize either low-level emergent timing processes (continuous circle drawing) or higher-level event-based timing mechanisms (intermittent circle drawing). The circle drawing tasks were performed with the hands coupled in either a symmetrical or asymmetrical coordination mode and at two individually-determined movement frequencies (comfortable and fast). Older participants were able to match the performance of young adults under both coordination modes and movement frequencies in the bimanual continuous circling task, but showed significantly greater temporal variability when performing the intermittent circling task. The {{results of the study}} are in accordance with the view that age-related effects will be observed in tasks in which movement timing is guided by high-level representations but not in tasks involving relatively <b>automatic</b> low-level <b>timing</b> processes...|$|R
