40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} a multi-task agency {{model with}} a risk-neutral and financially constrained <b>agent.</b> The <b>agent's</b> <b>performance</b> evaluation is thereby incongruent, i. e. it does not perfectly reflect the relative contribution of the agent's multi-dimensional effort to firm's profit. This paper elaborates on {{the improvement of the}} <b>agent's</b> <b>performance</b> evaluation through the costly acquisition of additional performance measures aimed at inducing the agent to implement a more efficient effort allocation across tasks. It contrasts two alternatives for the principal: (i) to centrally invest in the information acquisition; or (ii), to delegate this task to a supervisor. This paper demonstrates that the principal generally favors delegation for a sufficiently incongruent measurement of the <b>agent's</b> <b>performance,</b> and a centralized investment, otherwise. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Reward shaping {{has been}} shown to {{significantly}} improve an <b>agent’s</b> <b>performance</b> in reinforcement learning. As attention is shifting from tabula-rasa approaches to methods where some heuristic domain knowledge can be given to agents, an important problem that arises is how to generate a useful potential function. Previous research demon-strated the use of plan-based reward shaping in multi-agent reinforce-ment learning (MARL), where STRIPS planning was used to generate a potential function. The results showed that potential functions based on joint plans can improve an <b>agent’s</b> <b>performance.</b> When using individual plans however, the agents face conflicting goals which can have a detri-MDPs as a method to provide heuristic knowledge in MARL and how it can be utilised for conflict resolution when agent communication and goal-shaping is not possible...|$|R

40|$|Orientation: Currently no {{integrative}} model {{exists that}} {{can explain the}} phenomena contributing to <b>agent</b> <b>performance</b> in the South African contact centre industry. Research purpose: The primary {{focus of this article}} was to develop a theoretically derived human capital predictive model for <b>agent</b> <b>performance</b> in contact centres and Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) based on a review of current empirical research literature. Motivation for the study: The study was motivated by the need for a human capital predictive model that can predict agent and overall business performance. Research design: A nonempirical (theoretical) research paradigm was adopted for this study and more specifically a theory or model-building approach was followed. A systematic review of published empirical research articles (for the period 2000 – 2009) in scholarly search portals was performed. Main findings: Eight building blocks of the human capital predictive model for <b>agent</b> <b>performance</b> in contact centres were identified. Forty-two of the human capital contact centre related articles are detailed in this study. Key empirical findings suggest that person– environment fit, job demands-resources, human resources management practices, engagement, agent well-being, agent competence; turnover intention; and <b>agent</b> <b>performance</b> are related to contact centre performance. Practical/managerial implications: The human capital predictive model serves as an operational management model that has performance implications for agents and ultimately influences the contact centre’s overall business performance. Contribution/value-add: This research can contribute to the fields of human resource management (HRM), human capital and performance management within the contact centre and BPO environment. </p...|$|E

40|$|Markov {{decision}} processes (MDPs) with undiscounted rewards {{represent an}} important class {{of problems in}} decision and control. The goal of learning in these MDPs {{is to find a}} policy that yields the maximum expected return per unit time. In large state spaces, computing these averages directly is not feasible; instead, the agent must estimate them by stochastic exploration of the state space. In this case, longer exploration times enable more accurate estimates and more informed decision-making. The learning curve for an MDP measures how the <b>agent's</b> <b>performance</b> depends on the allowed exploration time, T. In this paper we analyze these learning curves for a simple control problem with undiscounted rewards. In particular, methods from statistical mechanics are used to calculate lower bounds on the <b>agent's</b> <b>performance</b> in the thermodynamic limit T ! 1, N ! 1, ff = T =N (finite), where T is the number of time steps allotted per policy evaluation and N is the size of the state space.

This research method is explanatory, with data collection through questionnaires and interviews. The sampling technique used saturated technique sampling.

Quantitative analysis using validity, reliability, cross tabulation, correlation coefficient, coefficient of determination, simple and multiple regression analysis, as well as the significance test (t test and F test). The results of this study showed a relatively good level of competency. Compensation is in high category, although there are still existing in the low category.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} use of {{discretionary}} rewards in a finitely repeated principal-agent relationship with moral hazard. The key aspect is that rewards have informational content.

In accordance with the often observed compression of ratings, we show that in equilibrium the principal communicates the <b>agent's</b> interim <b>performance</b> imperfectly, i. e., she does not fully differentiate good and bad performance. Furthermore, we show that small rewards can have a large impact on the agent's effort, provided that the principal's stake in the project is small.

40|$|Market simulations, {{like their}} {{real-world}} counterparts, are typically domains of high complexity, high variability, and incomplete information. The performance of autonomous agents in these markets depends both upon {{the strategies of}} their opponents and on various market conditions, such as supply and demand.

Researchers who wish to evaluate their agents must run many test games across multiple opponent sets and market conditions to verify that <b>agent</b> <b>performance</b> has actually improved. Our approach {{is to improve the}} statistical power of market simulation experiments by controlling their complexity, thereby creating an environment more conducive to structured agent testing and analysis.

40|$|International audienceIn this work, {{we propose}} {{the use of}} drift {{detection}} techniques for learning offer policies in multiissue, bilateral negotiation. Several works aiming to develop adaptive trading agents have been proposed. Such agents are capable of learning their competitors' utility values and functions, thereby obtaining better results in negotiation. However, the learning mechanisms generally used disregard possible changes in a competitor's offer/counter-offer policy. In that case, the <b>agent's</b> <b>performance</b> may decrease drastically. The agent then needs to restart the learning process, as the model previously learned is no longer valid.
