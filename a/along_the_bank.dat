The walled portion of the castle is shaped roughly like a figure-8 aligned northeast-southwest <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> of the loch, around , forming two baileys ({{enclosures}}): the Nether Bailey to the north, and the Upper Bailey to the south. The curtain walls of both enclosures date largely to the 14th century, though much augmented by later building, particularly to the north where most of the remaining structures are located.|$|E
5|$|In preparation, Beauchamp {{packed a}} change of clothes, a black mask, and a knife with poison on the tip, {{to be used as}} the murder weapon. Finding all the inns filled when he arrived at Frankfort, he took lodging at the {{residence}} of Joel Scott, warden of the state penitentiary. Between nine and ten o'clock that evening, Beauchamp went to Sharp's home. Dressed in disguise, he carried his usual clothes and buried them <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> of the Kentucky River for retrieval following the murder. Discovering that Sharp was not home, Beauchamp looked for him in the city, finding him at a local tavern. He returned to Sharp's house to wait for him, and saw him return at midnight.|$|E

5|$|Along the Kanto Plain near Tokyo, Thad wrecked 22houses, damaged 31 bridges, damaged {{roads in}} 145places, and flooded 27rivers. According to police reports, five {{individuals}} drowned and six others were initially reported missing in Suzaka, because of flooding {{from the nearby}} Ayu River that crushed houses <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank.</b> In Akita, a fishing boat with nine people aboard was capsized by strong winds; all nine were rendered as missing by police. Elsewhere, one person {{was killed by a}} falling tree and a fisherman drowned when his boat overturned. In the Ibaraki Province, just north of Tokyo, officials ordered the evacuation of 5,000dwellings in the city of Ryugasaki, 2,500 of which were flooded. After the nearby Kogai River threatened to overflow their banks, over 1,000families were evacuated. Another 4,000families were evacuated in Fujishiro, though by August25, the majority of the evacuated had returned to their homes. In the island of Hokkaido, air service was suspended; damage was severe in the area. However, the capital city of Tokyo avoided the worst of the storm. In all, Thad was considered the worst storm to strike the nation in two years.|$|E

5|$|The first Australian {{fighting}} patrol into Kalimantan began on 24 May with two platoons, 5 and 11 Platoons, from B Company and a forward observation party, departing the company base at Bukit Knuckle {{under the command}} of Major William Broderick. The patrol—designated Operation Article—involved an ambush patrol <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> of the Sungei Koemba river. After several days of careful and laborious movement through the thick jungle Broderick established a patrol base on the high ground overlooking the river on 26 May and sent forward a small reconnaissance party of three men with Lieutenant Patrick Beale. The forward element subsequently detected a party of Indonesians in a re-entrant below, talking loudly and firing random shots, seemingly unaware of the proximity of the Australians and unconcerned with basic notions of security.|$|E
5|$|Henry Edwards {{was born}} to Hannah and Thomas Edwards (c. 1794 – 1857) at Brook House in Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, England, on August 27, 1827, and was christened on September 14. From his older brother William, he picked up an {{interest}} in examining insects. He collected butterflies as a hobby, and studied them {{under the tutelage of}} Edward Doubleday. His solicitor father intended a law career for his son, but after a brief period of unsuccessful study, Edwards took a position at a counting house in London, and began acting in amateur theater. He then journeyed to join his brother William who had settled in Australia, nine miles (14km) north-west of Melbourne <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> of Merri Creek, a location then called Merrivale. Aboard the sailing ship Ganges from March to June 1853, he wrote descriptions of creatures such as the albatross that he encountered for the first time. After arriving in Melbourne, Edwards began collecting and cataloging the insects he found on his brother's land, and further afield. Within two years, he had gathered 1,676 species of insects, shot and mounted 200 birds, and pressed some 200 botanical specimens. This collection and that of William Kershaw were purchased by Frederick McCoy to form the nucleus of the new National Museum of Victoria.|$|E

25|$|They {{continued}} down river, hitting more rapids and cutting wood from trees <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> for fuel. Captain Miller sent two men ahead {{in a boat}} to scout out for rocks and rapids, and the Shoshone proceeded behind them. They ran a particularly hazardous stretch at the Mountain Sheep section in Seven Devils Canyon. The boat was sucked into a whirlpool, and a huge wall of water came aboard, breaking into and nearly flooding the engine room, washing big chunks of cordwood all about the engine room floor. As {{the men in the}} engine room dodged these hazards, the Shoshone ran through a passage so narrow that {{there were only a few}} inches clearance between the rock walls on both sides of the vessel.|$|E
25|$|Mani 1965 {{reported}} the panning for gold by local miners in Siruvani River of Attappadi. Detailed studies {{to assess the}} economic potential of Attappadi area was carried out subsequently by Geological Survey of India. However, no primary gold prospects were identified. Nair 1993 carried out the geomorphologic mapping combined with panning of Siruvani River {{which led to the}} discovery of primary gold mineralization in epigenetic quartz vein in Puttumala. The veining, mineralization and associated lithology of this deposit appear to be typical of greenstone-hosted lode gold deposit. On the basis of mode of occurrence two types of gold mineralization are recognized in Attappadi, (1) Primary gold mineralization is associated with quartz veins intruding to AS and PGC. (2) Placer deposit <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> of Siruvani River.|$|E
25|$|Poverty Point, built about 1500 BC {{in what is}} now Louisiana, is a {{prominent}} example of Late Archaic mound-builder construction (c. 2500 BCE - 1000 BCE). It is a striking complex of more than one square mile, where six earthwork crescent ridges were built in concentric arrangement, interrupted by radial aisles. Three mounds are also part of the main complex, and evidence of residences extends for about 3 miles <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> of Bayou Macon. It is the major site among 100 associated with the Poverty Point culture {{and is one of the}} best-known early examples of earthwork monumental architecture. Unlike the localized societies during the Middle Archaic, this culture showed evidence of a wide trading network outside its area, which is one of its distinguishing characteristics.|$|E

25|$|The II Corps {{reached the}} ford about 9:30a.m.; finding {{a line of}} pickets <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank,</b> 3rd Division {{commander}} Brigadier General Alexander Hays ordered three hundred men of Brigadier General Joshua Owen's 1st Brigade across the river to drive off the pickets. This was done successfully, resulting in the capture of thirty members of the Stonewall Brigade without any Union losses. The rest of Owen's brigade crossed the river but then encountered heavy artillery fire. Johnson brought up one brigade and parts of two others, along with additional artillery. At 12:30p.m., Hays received permission from Caldwell to bring {{the rest of his}} division across the ford, which took two hours, while Caldwell positioned Union artillery on the heights north of the river; during this time Johnson continued to receive reinforcements.|$|E
25|$|On 8 March, three Divisions of the 14th Rifle Corps {{attacked}} {{the positions of}} the Estonian Division in Siivertsi, five kilometres north of Narva. The artillery of the Estonian Rifle Corps was placed under their command. For the first time, Estonians were facing Estonians in combat over Narva river. Loudspeakers were set up on the Soviet side, calling the Estonians on the German side to swap side. On 17 March, after massive bombardment of {{the positions of the}} Estonian Division, and 500 deaths from the Soviet 1256th Rifle Regiment, the Soviets managed to establish a bridgehead on {{the west bank of the}} river eight kilometres north of Narva. Assisted by the artillery of the III Germanic SS Panzer Corps, the Estonian machine-gunners, placed <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank,</b> cleared the bridgehead by the following night. The three Divisions of the 14th Rifle Corps were destroyed and the remains reformed in the rear.|$|E
25|$|By 1804, {{there were}} a number of Native American groups in Iowa: the Sauk (Sac) and Meskwaki (Fox) on the eastern edge of Iowa along the Mississippi; the Ioway <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> of the Des Moines River; the Oto, Missouri, and Omaha along the Missouri River, and the Sioux in the Northern and Western parts of the State. Additionally, earlier records {{indicate}} the presence of the Illinois in Iowa, though they were nearly gone by the time of the 1804 observations. The total number of these groups in Iowa in 1804 is estimated to be less than 15,000. While these groups generally came initially for food, some of them (e.g., Illinois, Sauk, Meskwaki) immigrated as a result of warfare with other tribes or the French. The early and mid-19th century saw the movement of additional groups of Native Americans into Iowa, such as the Potawatomi and Winnebago, followed by the emigration from Iowa of nearly all Native Americans.|$|E
