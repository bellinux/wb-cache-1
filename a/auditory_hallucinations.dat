5|$|<b>Auditory</b> <b>{{hallucinations}}</b> {{are typical}} of psychoses: third-person hallucinations (i.e. voices talking about the patient) and hearing one's thoughts spoken aloud (gedankenlautwerden or écho de la pensée) are among the Schneiderian first rank symptoms indicative of schizophrenia, whereas second-person hallucinations (voices talking to the patient) threatening or insulting or telling them to commit suicide, may be a feature of psychotic depression or schizophrenia. Visual hallucinations are generally suggestive of organic conditions such as epilepsy, drug intoxication or drug withdrawal. Many of the visual effects of hallucinogenic drugs are more correctly described as visual illusions or visual pseudohallucinations, as they are distortions of sensory experiences, and are not experienced as existing in objective reality. Auditory pseudohallucinations are suggestive of dissociative disorders. Déjà vu, derealization and depersonalization are associated with temporal lobe epilepsy and dissociative disorders.|$|E
5|$|Norman Osborn {{is shown}} to be {{severely}} manic depressive. This has been referenced several times in a myriad of Spider-Man stories. When he is not {{under the direction of}} a psychiatrist and taking medication, he has dangerous mood swings. At the apex of his mania, he is paranoid, delusional, and suffers from visual and <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations,</b> including hearing the voice of his Green Goblin persona and seeing its face in the mirror rather than his own. Previously, Osborn's arrogance caused him to refuse to submit to psychiatric treatment unless forced to; he viewed mental illness as an imperfection and therefore would not admit that he is mentally ill. In later conversations with the Sentry, Osborn revealed that he had come to accept his own mental illness. After having rid of his powers after the confrontation with the Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus), Osborn's sanity apparently restored but remains a villain.|$|E
5|$|The player {{needs to}} make moral {{decisions}} at certain points during the game, including making choices that can determine the fate of both soldiers and civilians. These decisions affect the relationship between Walker and his squadmates, and will cause them to react differently. The game has several subtle effects as the team starts being broken mentally and physically, including the degradation of their combat uniforms. Walker has visual and <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> later into the game, and his executions of enemies become more violent. The orders and shouts to his team become increasingly angry and ragged in contrast to his original stern command voice. His kill confirmations of enemies corrupts from professional in the beginning to psychotic. Similarly, loading screens initially display helpful gameplay hints for the player, but as the game progresses, the text becomes increasingly hostile towards Walker's actions, and sometimes breaks the fourth wall by addressing the player directly. The game features collectibles known as Intel, which are audio logs that provide additional backstory for players.|$|E

25|$|<b>Auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> are {{the most}} {{prevalent}} type of hallucinations. They include hearing voices and music. Many times an individual suffering from <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> will hear a voice or voices saying the individual's own thoughts out loud, commenting on all their actions, or commanding and ordering the individual around. These voices tend to be negative and critical toward the individual. People who suffer from schizophrenia and have <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> will often speak to the voice {{as though they are}} speaking to a second person.|$|E
25|$|A mild form of {{hallucination}} {{is known}} as a disturbance, and can occur in most of the senses above. These may be things like seeing movement in peripheral vision, or hearing faint noises and/or voices. <b>Auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> are very common in schizophrenia. They may be benevolent (telling the subject good things about themselves) or malicious, cursing the subject, etc. <b>Auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> of the malicious type are frequently heard, for example people talking about the subject behind his/her back. Like <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations,</b> the source of the visual counterpart can also be behind the subject's back. Their visual counterpart is the feeling of being looked or stared at, usually with malicious intent. Frequently, <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> and their visual counterpart are experienced by the subject together.|$|E
25|$|<b>Auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> (also {{known as}} paracusia) are the {{perception}} of sound without outside stimulus. <b>Auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> {{are the most common}} type of hallucination. <b>Auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> can be divided into two categories: elementary and complex. Elementary hallucinations are {{the perception of}} sounds such as hissing, whistling, an extended tone, and more. In many cases, tinnitus is an elementary auditory hallucination. However, some people who experience certain types of tinnitus, especially pulsatile tinnitus, are actually hearing the blood rushing through vessels near the ear. Because the auditory stimulus is present in this situation, it does not qualify as a hallucination.|$|E

40|$|Background Hearing voices {{occurs in}} middle childhood, but {{little is known}} about prevalence, {{aetiology}} and immediate consequences. Aims To investigate prevalence, developmental risk factors and behavioural correlates of <b>auditory</b> vocal <b>hallucinations</b> in 7 - and 8 -year-olds. Method <b>Auditory</b> vocal <b>hallucinations</b> were assessed with the <b>Auditory</b> Vocal <b>Hallucination</b> Rating Scale in 3870 children. Prospectively recorded data on pre- and perinatal complications, early development and current problem behaviour were analysed in children with <b>auditory</b> vocal <b>hallucinations</b> and matched controls. Results The 1 -year prevalence of <b>auditory</b> vocal <b>hallucinations</b> was 9 %, with substantial suffering and problem behaviour reported in 15 % of those affected. Prevalence was higher in rural areas but <b>auditory</b> vocal <b>hallucinations</b> were more severe and had greater functional impact in the urban environment. There was little evidence for associations with developmental variables. Conclusions <b>Auditory</b> vocal <b>hallucinations</b> in 7 - and 8 -year-olds are prevalent but mostly of limited functional impact. Nevertheless, there may be continuity with more severe psychotic outcomes given the serious suffering in a subgroup of children and there is evidence for a poorer prognosis in an urban environment...|$|R

25|$|<b>Auditory</b> <b>hallucinations,</b> {{particularly}} {{experiences of}} hearing voices, {{are the most}} common and often prominent feature of psychosis. Hallucinated voices may talk about, or to, the person, and may involve several speakers with distinct personalities. <b>Auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> tend to be particularly distressing when they are derogatory, commanding or preoccupying. However, the experience of hearing voices need not always be a negative one. One research study has shown that the majority of people who hear voices are not in need of psychiatric help. The Hearing Voices Movement has subsequently been created to support voice hearers, regardless of whether they are considered to have a mental disorder or not.|$|E

The paranoid schizophrenic diagnosis, originally made by Landy, was later retracted.|$|E
40|$|As {{video game}} {{developers}} seek to provide increasing levels of realism and sophistication, {{there is a}} need for game characters to be able to exhibit psychological states including 'altered states of consciousness' (ASC) realistically. 'Auditory hallucination' (AH) is a feature of ASC in which an individual may perceive distortions to auditory perception, or hear sounds with no apparent acoustic origin. Appropriate use of game sound may enable realistic representations of these sounds in video games. However to achieve this requires rigorous approaches informed by research. This paper seeks to inform the process of designing sounds based on <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucination,</b> by reporting the outcomes of analysing nearly 2000 experience reports that describe drug-induced intoxication. Many of these reports include descriptions of <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucination.</b> Through analysis of these reports, our research establishes a classification system, which we propose can be used for designing sounds based on <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucination...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: Nursing {{practices}} contain ethical {{assumptions and}} concepts {{embedded in the}} assumptions and principles of the theory that guide nurses 2 ̆ 7 thinking and actions. In nursing practices are called upon for their expert ethical knowledged to formulate policies and provide counsel for what are deemed to be ethical dilemmas. The origin of ethical dilemma on tile psychiatric patient is paternalistic patterns. Paternalistic practices, where in providers confer a treatment or service upon a person or persons without their consent, ostensibly by reason of their limited autonomy or diminished capacity, are common in the psychiatric nursing. Objective: Nursing contributes critical self-decision regarding the <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucination</b> patients, but looks on when ethical analysis is needed. What implications does this have for nursing? What does it related to practice for caring in nursing ethically? How are the caring philosophical underpinnings of nursing ethics? Methods: The study design was a quasi experiment that aims to examine the influences of nursing care on the self-decision making among the <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucination</b> patient using caring perspectives at Soeharto Heerdjan Hospital, Jakarta. Twenty three clients with <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucination</b> were chosen.

40|$|Background In a {{baseline}} study among 7 - and 8 -year-old children with <b>auditory</b> vocal <b>hallucinations,</b> only limited functional impact was observed. Aims To assess 5 -year course and predictors of <b>auditory</b> vocal <b>hallucinations,</b> {{as well as}} 5 -year incidence and its risk factors. Method A sample of 337 children, 12 and 13 years of age, were reassessed on <b>auditory</b> vocal <b>hallucinations</b> and associated symptoms after a mean follow-up period of 5. 1 years. Results The 5 -year persistence and incidence rates were 24 % and 9 % respectively, with more new cases arising in urban areas. Both persistent and incident <b>auditory</b> vocal <b>hallucinations</b> were associated with problem behaviour in the clinical range of psychopathology as measured with the Child Behavior Checklist, particularly at follow-up, {{as well as with}} other psychotic symptoms, particularly at baseline. Persistence was predicted by baseline <b>auditory</b> vocal <b>hallucinations</b> severity, particularly in terms of external attribution of voices and hearing multiple voices, and was associated with worse primary school test scores and lower secondary school level. Conclusions First onset of <b>auditory</b> vocal <b>hallucinations</b> in middle childhood is not uncommon and is associated with psychopathological and behavioural comorbidity. Similarly, persistence of <b>auditory</b> vocal <b>hallucinations</b> in childhood is not uncommon and is associated with psychopathological, behavioural and cognitive alterations...|$|R

25|$|Another {{source of}} {{controversy}} {{is the relationship}} between smoking and sensory gating in schizophrenia.

25|$|Various brain {{disorders}} implicate {{the role}} of unconscious brain processes in decision making tasks. <b>Auditory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> produced by Schizophrenia seem to suggest a divergence of will and behaviour.

25|$|These are {{abilities}} {{that allow us}} to monitor or draw inferences from our own internal psychological states (such as intentions, memories, beliefs and thoughts). The ability to discriminate between internal (self-generated) and external (stimuli) sources of information is considered to be an important metacognitive skill, but one which may break down to cause hallucinatory experiences. Projection of an internal state (or a person's own reaction to another's) may arise in the form of hallucinations, especially <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucinations.</b> A recent hypothesis that is gaining acceptance concerns the role of overactive top-down processing, or strong perceptual expectations, that can generate spontaneous perceptual output (that is, hallucination).|$|E
40|$|Background: Comprehensive {{understanding}} of a spoken message relies on successful interpretation of both what is spoken, {{and the manner in}} which it is spoken. Deficits in the ability to interpret emotional tone in speech have been widely reported in schizophrenia, with some literature suggesting that such prosodic interpretation is especially impoverished in those who experience <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucination.</b> As a sound-based paralinguistic faculty, the interpretation of emotional prosody ultimately relies on the sensory processing of fundamental components of speech sound, namely pitch, loudness and tone duration. Similarly, many of the distinguishing phenomenological aspects of <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucination</b> in schizophrenia, such as anomalous auditory source localization and speaker identification, suggest the implication of problematic processing of these fundamental auditory cues, and especially that of pitch. The current study explored the possibility that deficits in fundamental auditory processing may be a sensory substrate of both <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucination</b> and deficits in the interpretation of emotional prosody. Methods: Three groups of participants were recruited for the current study: 25 schizophrenia patients experiencing auditory hallucination; 25 schizophrenia patients with no significant history of auditory hallucination; and 25 non-psychiatric controls. Following screening for hearing loss, participants performed a battery of auditory processing tasks, which assessed ability to discriminate between simple tones that varied in either pitch, loudness and tone duration. To assess prosodic processing, participants performed a task assessing ability to identify the emotion of sentences spoken in a range of emotions. In addition, participants performed a novel prosodic labeling task in which full speech waveforms were modulated by two of the three fundamental acoustic cues of interest at a time, such that only one intact cue was offered for prosodic interpretation. A cold cognitive, linguistic prosody-labeling task was included as a control measure to examine any independent deficits in emotional and non-emotional prosodic interpretation. Results: Preliminary analysis of the fundamental auditory processing data suggests that hallucinating schizophrenia patients displayed significant deficits in the discrimination of pitch and tone duration when compared with non-psychiatric controls. However, no deficit in the discrimination of loudness information was identified. This presentation will include reporting of the final results from all auditory and prosodic processing tasks. Discussion: The current study explored fundamental auditory processing deficits in schizophrenia and how these may relate to <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucination</b> and receptive prosody dysfunction. The initial findings suggesting that pitch and tone duration processing are impoverished in schizophrenia, and yet loudness processing may be intact, are congruent with previous findings. This presentation will draw upon the final results to establish a neurocognitive model of auditory processing deficit, prosodic dysfunction and <b>auditory</b> <b>hallucination</b> in schizophrenia, and discuss implications for treatment and future research...|$|R
40|$|Decreased {{language}} lateralization is a well-replicated {{finding in}} psychotic patients. It is currently unclear, however, whether this abnormality {{is related to}} a particular symptom of psychosis or to psychosis in general. It {{has been argued that}} decreased language lateralization may be related to <b>auditory</b> verbal <b>hallucinations.</b> To elucidate this, these hallucinations should be studied in isolation. Thirty-five patients with a psychotic disorder, 35 non-psychotic subjects with relatively isolated <b>auditory</b> verbal <b>hallucinations</b> and 35 healthy control subjects participated in this study. All subjects were scanned on a 3 T magnetic resonance imaging scanner, while covertly performing a paced verbal fluency task. In order to measure performance on the task, one additional task block was presented during which subjects had to generate words overtly. In addition to calculating language lateralization indices, group-wise brain activation during verbal fluency was compared between the three groups. Task performance was nearly maximal for all groups and did not differ significantly between the groups. Compared with the healthy control subjects and non-psychotic subjects with <b>auditory</b> verbal <b>hallucinations,</b> language lateralization was significantly reduced for the patient group. In addition, the patients displayed significantly greater activity in the right precentral gyrus and left insula when compared with the healthy control subjects and the non-psychotic subjects with <b>auditory</b> verbal <b>hallucinations.</b> Furthermore, the patients showed greater activity in the right superior parietal lobule when compared with the healthy control subjects. Lateralization indices did not differ significantly between the non-psychotic subjects with <b>auditory</b> verbal <b>hallucinations</b> and the healthy control subjects. Moreover, {{there were no significant differences}} in brain activation during verbal fluency between the two non-psychotic groups. As language lateralization was not significantly reduced in the non-psychotic individuals with <b>auditory</b> verbal <b>hallucinations,</b> a direct relationship between <b>auditory</b> verbal <b>hallucinations</b> and decreased language lateralization can not be established at present...|$|R
