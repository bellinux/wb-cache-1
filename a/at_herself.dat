5|$|The font design {{featured}} on the front cover was created by Pizz, a graphic artist from Long Beach, who also designed album cover art for several other indie rock bands. The {{back side of the}} album features a painting by bassist Emery, depicting a topless woman looking <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> through a hand mirror. On her chest is a red heart surrounded by arrows, and below, her ribs protrude from her sides, possibly a reference to anorexia and body image issues, a major theme of the album and its successor Live Through This.|$|E
5|$|The head {{is celebrated}} as {{a mark of}} {{identity}} as well as source of the seed. Thus, the self-decapitation represents removal of maya (illusion or delusion), physical attachment, false notions, ignorance, and egoism. The scimitar also signifies severance of these obstacles to moksha (emancipation), jnana (wisdom), and self-realization. The goddess also denotes discriminating perception. Chhinnamasta allows the devotee to gain a consciousness that transcends the bonds of physical attachment, the body, and the mind by her self-sacrifice. One interpretation suggests that her three eyes represent the sun, the moon, and fire while another links the third eye to transcendental knowledge. Unlike other Hindu deities who are depicted facing the devotee, Chhinnamasta generally looks <b>at</b> <b>herself,</b> prompting the devotee to look within him- or herself.|$|E
5|$|The seven-minute long video depicts Beyoncé {{playing a}} beauty pageant contest {{representing}} Third Ward, Houston, {{the area in}} which she grew up. It opens with the sound of a poignant piano and shots of Beyoncé sporting short hair, looking <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> in the mirror. It transitions to a segment of her fellow contestants preparing for the pageant backstage, combing their hair, fitting their dresses and analyzing their bodies; one scene during the preparations shows Beyoncé arguing with another contestant over a hair dryer. Multiple shots of the singer follow, of which depict her sitting on a floor and leaving a bathroom after vomiting. The clip then sees contestants looking tired and distressed backstage.|$|E

5|$|Numerous works, {{from the}} ancient to the baroque, have been cited as sources of {{inspiration}} for Velázquez. The nude Venuses of the Italian painters, such as Giorgione's Sleeping Venus (c. 1510) and Titian's Venus of Urbino (1538), were the main precedents. In this work, Velázquez combined two established poses for Venus: recumbent on a couch or a bed, and gazing at a mirror. She {{is often described as}} looking <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> on the mirror, although this is physically impossible since viewers can see her face reflected in their direction. This phenomenon is known as the Venus effect. In a number of ways the painting represents a pictorial departure, through its central use of a mirror, and because it shows the body of Venus turned away from the observer of the painting.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins in}} 2011 with Cocoro {{traveling}} to SPHIA to interview Inubushi, when her plane experiences turbulence and crashes on Mount Akakura. Yuni and Yomogi get the unconscious Cocoro and Mayuzumi {{to an emergency}} cabin to take shelter from the blizzard. In 2012, Satoru falls from the SPHIA facility's clock tower and loses consciousness. Cocoro wakes up {{in a room and}} is relieved to find that Yuni is safe. Yuni does not recognize her; when looking <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> in a mirror, she sees a man's body. Similarly, Satoru wakes up in a woman's body. Both eventually switch back to their respective bodies, but the phenomenon continues, with their minds moving between their bodies; they conclude that their consciousnesses are transcending time and space. In the cabin, a news article dated July 4, 2011 is found, which says that Yuni was the only survivor, with the other three having died in an avalanche on January 17. Satoru finds a key in his room, but does not know what it unlocks.|$|E
25|$|Scottish author George MacDonald {{also wrote}} a fantasy novel {{entitled}} Lilith, {{first published in}} 1895. MacDonald employed the character of Lilith in service to a spiritual drama about sin and redemption, in which Lilith finds a hard-won salvation. Many of the traditional characteristics of Lilith mythology {{are present in the}} author's depiction: Long dark hair, pale skin, a hatred and fear of children and babies, and an obsession with gazing <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> in a mirror. MacDonald's Lilith also has vampiric qualities: she bites people and sucks their blood for sustenance.|$|E
60|$|And she {{was angry}} with <b>herself</b> <b>at</b> {{allowing}} <b>herself</b> to be turned {{out of the house}} before the crisis had come. She felt that she ought to have been present at the crisis, and that by the exercise of her own powers she might have hurried on the crisis. In this respect she was by no means satisfied with herself.|$|R

25|$|Van Stipriaan further {{reports that}} other tales {{describe}} river travellers (usually men) chancing upon the spirit. She is inevitably grooming herself, combing her hair, and peering <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> in a mirror. Upon noticing the intruder, she flees {{into the water}} and leaves her possessions behind. The traveller then takes the invaluable items. Later, Mami Wata appears to the thief in his dreams to demand the return of her things. Should he agree, she further demands a promise from him to be sexually faithful to her. Agreement grants the person riches; refusal to return the possessions or to be faithful brings the man ill fortune.|$|E

[...] In that role, she has said that [...] "We can't take a carbon-free source of energy off the table." [...] She has {{acknowledged}} that looking <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> twenty years earlier, she would [...] "probably not be pro-nuclear", but said that [...] "I think climate change is the biggest problem the world has ever faced" [...] and it would simply be [...] "irresponsible" [...] not to consider nuclear energy as part of the solution.|$|E
500|$|Goodridge {{completed}} Beauty Revealed in 1828, likely {{from looking}} <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> in a mirror. Several works {{have been cited}} as possible inspirations, including John Vanderlyn's Ariadne Asleep on the Island of Naxos and Horatio Greenough's sculpture Venus Victrix. Goodridge sent her portrait to Webster {{when he was a}} new widower, and, based on its miniature format, it was likely intended for his eyes alone. The American art critic John Updike suggests that the artist intended it to offer herself to Webster; he writes that the bared breasts appear to say [...] "We are yours for the taking, in all our ivory loveliness, with our tenderly stippled nipples". Ultimately, however, Webster married another, wealthier woman.|$|E

500|$|The video {{starts with}} an {{announcement}} on television that nuclear activities has destroyed cities like London, Paris, New York City, and Los Angeles. It then cuts {{to a room}} where Madonna lies in her bed watching the news about the nuclear explosion. As the song starts, a visibly distressed Madonna walks to her dressing table. She sits down and kisses a framed photograph of her mother, while looking <b>at</b> <b>herself.</b> She drapes a cape around her, picks up a rod and a hat, and goes {{out of her house}} as the chorus of [...] "Ghosttown" [...] starts. Madonna is seen in {{what appears to be a}} post-apocalyptic destroyed city, where there are no signs of life and posters of the Rebel Heart album are shown burning. She looks around and walks carefully among the destruction, while twirling around the cape.|$|E
500|$|Loder {{performed}} six songs live {{as part of}} {{an interview}} on CBC Radio in April 2013. She had written five of these songs, and four of them had not been previously released.

500|$|Harrison {{confessed that}} it was not easy for him {{to come up with the}} lyrics to [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] in that length of time. But two hours later, he had written the verses, and the hook, in spite of being hung over. Harrison had also made {{provision}} for a backing track; he played all the instruments on the track. The bridge was written by Beyoncé, who was inspired by looking <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> in the mirror; as she was not wearing matching clothes and her hair was untidy, she kept saying, [...] "I'm looking so crazy right now." [...] Harrison sang back to her and said, [...] "That's the hook." [...] It also inspired the title of the song. After that Beyoncé had filled up the middle eight, she came up with the catchphrase – [...] "Uh-oh, uh-oh, you know" [...] – alongside Harrison.|$|E
500|$|Aboard the TARDIS, the Doctor indefinitely stabilizes the Gangers' {{forms to}} ensure that they remain human permanently, while {{providing}} Cleaves with a cure to her terminal condition. He takes the Ganger Jimmy to meet the real Jimmy's son and drops the factory crew at their headquarters where they plan to reveal the truth of the Flesh to humanity. As the TARDIS crew turns to leave, Amy starts feeling contractions. Back aboard the TARDIS, the Doctor admits his trip to the factory was planned: he wanted to investigate the Flesh in its raw form, as he has known for some time that Amy is a Ganger herself. He promises her that he will find her and then disrupts her form, turning her back to raw Flesh. Amy wakes in a pristine white tube; a slot opens on a wall revealing the [...] "Eye Patch Lady", who informs Amy she is [...] "ready to pop, aren't you". Amy looks down <b>at</b> <b>herself,</b> finding herself fully pregnant, and starts entering labour.|$|E
500|$|The premiere {{generally}} received mixed {{to negative}} feedback from television critics. Debbie Chang on BuddyTV deemed the episode [...] "dsyfunctional and ridiculous", being particularly {{critical of the}} story arc involving Stevens, whom she described as not being worthy of being promoted to the residency level. Chang expressed disagreement with the manner Bailey and Shepherd's characters were dealt with by the writers, feeling that the former's anger should have been targeted <b>at</b> <b>herself,</b> and criticizing the exaggerated exposure of the latter's [...] "first grader emotional maturity". However, Yang's character was praised, with Chang choosing her manner of repressing her feelings as a highlight. Chang expressed a general disappointment in the episode, disapproving the choice for the episode as a season opener, a topic in regard to which she elaborated, [...] "I [...] can see already that this season will continue to bring us medical cases that are so blatantly about the doctors' pathetic lives." [...] In September 2009, {{the inclusion of the}} deer ranked twelfth in Entertainment Weekly [...] "Most Memorable Cases of Grey's Anatomy".|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} {{features}} Lee {{in a warehouse}} and begins with her burying a photograph beneath {{a hole in the}} floorboards. After she walks away singing [...] "Under your spell again, I can't say no to you" [...] while looking directly in the camera, the hole in the floorboard slowly covers up. As she walks by a bookcase, she touches the books placed on it and they start smoking. Then she goes to her desk to write in a diary, while the floorboards and items surrounding her begin to melt. After finishing with the writing, she walks by a mirror and takes a look <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> as it starts to melt. As she begins to play a baby grand piano, the piano and the room surrounding her begin to catch on fire until rain begins to fall and extinguishes the flames. The room appears to be burnt and wasted.

Filipa Jodelka of The Guardian observed that [...] "David's family went on to pronounce him wicked and cast him out into darkness." [...] Writers kept the paternity of Kylie's baby a secret up until birth. On-screen the child, named Lily, has a paternity test taken {{in which it is}} revealed that David is her biological father. David then boasts about the result to Nick to cause further trouble. Producer Stuart Blackburn said that he used the story to [...] "push Kylie to the edge". It also created the opportunity for writers to revisit David's bad persona. He said the revelation damages their relationship but his team were keeping the possibility of the pair reuniting. Kylie is angry <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> and David. Blackburn explained [...] "in her head she's a screw-up, and she'll be furious with herself for imagining she could ever have a normal life. If there's hope for Kylie and David, they must accept each other for who they really are." ...|$|E
500|$|... "So Happy I Could Die" [...] is a mid-tempo Europop song, {{which is}} filled with Auto-Tune, giving it an echoing effect. According to the music sheet {{published}} by Sony/ATV Music Publishing on the website Musicnotes.com, the song is written in the time signature of common time, and is composed in the key of A minor with a tempo of 100 beats per minute. Gaga's voice ranges from the tonal nodes of A3 to A4 and the song follows a basic sequence of F–G–Em–Am as its chord progression. As Gaga sings the chorus, its melodic structure emulates that of Natasha Bedingfield's [...] "Pocketful of Sunshine" [...] (2008). Paul Lester of BBC suggested that [...] "So Happy I Could Die" [...] is reflective of the LGBT themes common in Gaga's songs, while Slant Magazine journalist Sal Cinquemani asserted that it telegraphed the [...] "instructive" [...] execution of the singer's rejection of [...] "any and all intimacy with others". [...] "'So Happy I Could Die' is a love song," [...] he remarked, [...] "but the object of her affection is herself—looking <b>at</b> <b>herself,</b> drinking with herself, dancing with herself, touching herself." ...|$|E
