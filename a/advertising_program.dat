The company introduced its child-oriented product line in North America {{during the summer}} of 1990 with an <b>advertising</b> <b>program</b> called the Burger King Kid's Club. In the United States, the meal is called the Kids Club Meal and it is primarily positioned against the popular Happy Meal from McDonald's. The meal includes an entrée, a side order, beverage, and a toy. The toy is usually a product tie-in with a movie or popular television show. The entrée and side offerings differ from market to market, as does portion size.|$|E

The products were introduced in a series of three pairs of commercials in both 15 and 30 second formats. The commercials featured animals such as snails or frogs that are used as exotic cuisine in various regions of the world. As the narrator announces BK is looking for new and more complex ingredients for their new line of sandwiches, the animals are shown reacting in a fearful way believing they are the new ingredients. At the end, the narrator declares one of the new flavors and the animal is relieved to find out they are not food, then they are promptly dispatched by the new food item (e.g. the frog is hit with a mango).|$|E

40|$|Bibliography: pages [73]- 77. It is {{the purpose}} of this thesis to analyze the state of <b>advertising</b> {{education}} <b>programs</b> at United States colleges and universities. More specifically, it assesses selected advertising curricula and the intellectual achievement of those who teach advertising exclusively. The methodology employed involves questionnaires sent to twenty universities with some of the largest undergraduate enrollments in <b>advertising</b> <b>programs</b> in departments/colleges/schools of advertising/journalism/communication and eleven colleges and universities that offer <b>advertising</b> <b>programs</b> under business disciplines. The data are used to compare the academic achievement of advertising educators and the course requirements for advertising majors in advertising, journalism, and marketing. Within journalistic disciplines, this study compares educators and curricula of the six autonomous departments of advertising with those of selected non-autonomous advertising sequences in departments/colleges/schools of journalism and/or communication. Comparisons {{made on the basis of}} the autonomy variable are restricted to the journalism schools, as no business schools were determined to have departments of advertising. Rather, all eleven offer <b>advertising</b> <b>programs</b> under their departments of marketing. Thus non-autonomous, or non-departmental, <b>advertising</b> <b>programs</b> in journalism are compared to their counterparts in marketing. The research shows that both advertising department faculty and marketing-advertising faculty generally hold higher academic degrees than journalism-advertising faculty. Departmental teachers and advertising faculty in marketing are of comparable academic quality. For the most part, departmental <b>advertising</b> <b>programs</b> require courses in all the functional areas of advertising. They average more <b>advertising</b> courses per <b>program</b> than either journalism- or business-based programs. Like the departmental <b>programs,</b> <b>advertising</b> <b>programs</b> in journalism tend to be consistent in their required advertising course content, although the journalism-based programs typically include more mandatory advertising electives. Among the three types of <b>advertising</b> <b>programs,</b> those in business require the most marketing courses as well as the fewest in both advertising and journalism. Besides these differences in curricular emphasis, marketing-advertising programs include highly varied arrangements of advertising courses, following no discernible pattern as displayed by the other two types of programs. These observations point to the conclusion that the academic division under which advertising is taught is significant in that it determines the character and content of the curriculum. M. A.

500|$|Coq Roq, also spelled COQ ROQ, was an <b>{{advertising}}</b> <b>program</b> {{created in}} late 2004 for Burger King by the Miami-based advertising firm Crispin Porter + Bogusky (CP+B). Coq Roq was a fictional [...] "rooster metal" [...] group (albeit composed of various real-life musicians) {{with its own}} website and associated content. The band's musical [...] "style" [...] was classified as punk-sounding rock n' roll, thrash or nu metal. The campaign featured a viral marketing website, television and print campaigns and a fictional MySpace page.

500|$|The meatloaf {{sandwich}} {{was part}} of the company's new BK Dinner Baskets product line and serving concept. To promote the product line and concept, Burger King commissioned New York based agency D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles to create a series of [...] "BK Teevee" [...] ads featuring MTV VJ Dan Cortese. The tag line developed for the promotion was [...] "BK, I love this place". The <b>advertising</b> <b>program</b> was designed as part of a back to basics plan by Burger King after a series of disappointing advertising schemes including the failure of its 1980s Where's Herb? campaign. The Dinner Baskets were one of two main parts of the plan, as was a newly introduced value menu in response to similar offerings at McDonald's, Taco Bell and Wendy's.|$|E

500|$|Another {{problematic}} CP+B <b>advertising</b> <b>program</b> {{was for the}} 2009 Texican Whopper {{that featured}} commercial known as [...] "The Little Mexican". The Texican Whopper was an LTO version of the Whopper sold in Europe and was advertised with an ad that featured a pair of actors dressed as a cowboy and a lucha libre wrestler. The problem arose when the Mexican Ambassador to Spain complained that the commercial featured demeaning stereotypes of Mexicans. Additionally, the print version of the advertisement featured the wrestler wearing a cape {{that appeared to be}} a Mexican flag, a violation of Mexican laws governing the usage of its national banner. Burger King eventually pulled the ad and issued an apology to the Mexican government. Conversely, the Mexican newspaper Excélsior issued a parody of the ad featuring American president Barack Obama as the cowboy and Mexican President Felipe Calderon as the wrestler as a commentary on {{the relationship between the two}} countries.|$|E
500|$|The company's online <b>advertising</b> <b>program</b> in Spain {{described}} the BK XXL line as being made [...] "with two enormous portions of flame-broiled meat {{that will give}} you all the energy you need to take the world by storm." [...] This claim combined with the television advertising were the prime motivators behind the Spanish government's concerns with the XXL sandwich line. The government claimed that campaign violated an agreement with the government to comply with an initiative on curbing obesity by promoting such a large and unhealthy sandwich. In response to the government's claims, Burger King replied in a statement: [...] "In this campaign, we are simply promoting a line of burgers that has formed part of our menu in recent years. Our philosophy can be summed up with the motto 'As you like it,' in which our customers' taste trumps all." [...] The company {{went on to say that}} it offers other healthier items such as salads and that customers are free to choose their own foods and modify them as they desire.|$|E
500|$|The 1990s led {{off with}} Grand Met taking Burger King's soft drink {{contract}} to Coca-Cola from Pepsi. Traditionally Burger King had sold soft drinks from the Coca-Cola Company in the United States, but in 1983, PepsiCo {{was able to}} garner the US$444million beverage supplier contract from its rival. Despite extreme market debate {{over the future of}} the contract, it was renewed for a second term in 1987. A sweetened contract that strengthened marketing and <b>advertising</b> <b>program</b> ties between Burger King and itself allowed Pepsi to keep supplying soft drinks to BK. Leading up to the decision, Pepsi had sponsored over 100 separate cross-promotions and product tie-ins, including a Fourth of July promotion where BK gave away a free Pepsi with each purchase. This fit into the goals of BK, which was looking for a partner that would provide [...] "outstanding, impactful promotional support." [...] However, the contract only lasted three more years when, partially based upon Pepsi's growth as a restaurant operator with its Tricon Restaurants division, Burger King moved its beverage contract back to Coca-Cola. Accompanying the reintroduction of Coca-Cola, BK introduced its first major chicken sandwich since 1977; the new BK Broiler sandwich was a broiled sandwich targeting more health-conscious customers. The BK Broiler was a rapid hit and within six months of its introduction was selling more than a million units daily system wide.|$|E

500|$|The Chicken Whopper was {{introduced}} initially via an April Fools' Day ad in several major news papers that claimed {{the company was}} changing its name to [...] "Chicken King". A later press release announced the joke was to introduce the public to the new product. The television <b>advertising</b> <b>program</b> used to introduce the Chicken Whopper featured animated chickens in cowboy boots marching to the [...] "Have It Your Way" [...] tune and was created by animation house Kurtz & Friends.

With the discovery of mad cow disease by the FDA in 2003, the company instructed their advertising agency at the time, Young & Rubicam of New York, to retool a forthcoming series of ads featuring the company's signature product, the Whopper, to include the Chicken Whopper. A Burger King spokesman stated that the change was because Burger King [...] "decided that if there's anybody who wants a chicken option, at this point, we wanted to remind them that the Whopper comes in chicken {{as well as the}} original beef," [...] noting their confidence in their beef supply.|$|E
500|$|Crispin, Porter + Bogusky, Burger King's {{advertising}} {{company of}} record from 2003-2011, produced several notable ads for the Whopper. In December 2008, Burger King purchased {{the rights to}} an advertising campaign that centered on a taste-test marketing campaign, dubbed [...] "Whopper Virgins". The test claimed to target participants who were unaware {{of the existence of}} Burger King or McDonald's, and had never eaten a hamburger. Three remote areas of the world—Baan Khun Chang Kiean, Thailand; Kulusuk, Greenland; and Budeşti, Romania—were targeted. In the test, the [...] "virgins" [...] were asked to try both the McDonald's Big Mac and the Burger King Whopper, and give their preference, if any. According to the advertisements and accompanying mini-documentary, the Whopper was the most popular sandwich among the test subjects. A social media based promotion from Crispin Porter + Bogusky in 2009 gave a free Whopper coupon for every 10 friends on Facebook a user would drop. The <b>advertising</b> <b>program</b> dubbed [...] "Whopper Sacrifice", was stopped after a week when Facebook canceled the Whopper Sacrifice account as a violation of its user privacy policy. This was {{despite the fact that the}} Burger King application was downloaded 60,000 times and 200,000 people were defriended. The company's final advertising campaign for the company was its [...] "Whopper Lust" [...] commercial which was a cross promotion with DirectTV. The promotion had an image of a Whopper on channel 111, and for every 5 minutes the image remained on the TV a free Whopper coupon would be sent to the subscriber. By the end of the promotion, over 50,000 coupons were distributed.|$|E
500|$|Returning to the {{practice}} of targeting the adult demographic as it had in 1978, BK introduced several new products to its menu in 2003. The new products included new or revamped chicken sandwiches, a new salad line, and its BK Joe brand of coffee. The first of these items was the TenderCrisp chicken sandwich, an entirely new sandwich which featured a fried [...] whole-muscle chicken breast on a corn-dusted roll. The sandwich was part of then-CEO Greg Brenneman's plans to bolster the company's revived [...] "Have it your way" [...] <b>advertising</b> <b>program,</b> which was designed to draw younger people to its stores. Some items, including the Enormous Omelet Sandwich line and the BK Stacker line, brought negative attention due the large portion size, amounts of unhealthy fats, and the presence of trans-fats. At the time, many of the products featured higher-quality ingredients like whole chicken breast, Angus beef, Cheddar cheese, and pepper jack cheese. Not all the products new products introduced under Blum's tenure met corporate sales expectations, the Baguette Chicken sandwiches being an example. Others products, such as Burger King's line of [...] "indulgent" [...] burgers originally called the Angus Burger, have undergone multiple reformulations. The Angus Steak burger was originally based around a [...] frozen patty; despite high expectations from the company, the sandwich fared poorly. After a reformulating program, it was relaunched in 2008 as the [...] Angus Steakhouse burger. With the introduction of a new multifunction broiler capable of cooking a more diverse set of products, Burger King replaced the Angus Steakhouse burger with the [...] Steakhouse XT burger in 2009. In 2011, the company discontinued selling the product in the North American market, replacing it with the Chef's Choice Burger. The Chef's Choice Burger was removed in 2012. 2014 saw the introduction of the newest attempt at introducing a premium burger to the company's portfolio with the introduction of the A.1.

The promotion sought to counter allegations that the company falsely advertised the ratio of ingredients in its beef filling for its tacos. The spots featured employees and franchisees stating that the filling has always been a mixture of 88% beef and various spices and binders and nothing else. The ad followed several full-page print ads in the New York Times and other newspapers that featured the headline [...] "Thank you for suing us." [...] Additionally, the chain added a new social campaign using Twitter and Facebook. The company invested heavily in the campaign, spending more than $3 million (USD) putting out its message—about 20 percent more than the company usually spends on an <b>advertising</b> <b>program.</b> The various campaigns came shortly before the company began its official response to the suit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California and were designed to bring public opinion into their camp. Various analysts stated that the company {{would have been better off}} using a grass-root campaign that involved in store advertising and other non-broadcast media. The suit was eventually withdrawn, and the company continued its advertising response by publicly requesting an apology from the suing firm of Beasley Allen. Analyst Laura Ries, of marketing strategy firm Ries & Ries, stated she believed Taco Bell's latest response was a mistake.

2500|$|In early 1996, {{the federal}} {{government}} launched an <b>advertising</b> <b>program</b> to increase the presence of Canada in Quebec, a policy that Chrétien believed would avoid {{a repeat of the}} near-defeat of 1995, and was to lead eventually to the Sponsorship scandal. As part of his [...] "Plan B" [...] for combatting Quebec separatism, in a speech in January 1996, Chrétien endorsed the idea of partitioning Quebec {{in the event of a}} yes vote in another referendum, stating all of the regions of Quebec that voted no would remain part of Canada, regardless of what the Quebec separatists thought. On February 15, 1996, Chrétien was confronted by a protester, Bill Clennett, during a walkabout in Hull, Quebec. The prime minister responded with a choke-hold. The press referred to it as the [...] "Shawinigan Handshake" [...] (from the name of his home town). In March 1996, when the Chrétien government presented its third budget, the backbencher Liberal M.P. John Nunziata voted against the budget under the grounds it failed to repeal the GST as the Liberals had promised in 1993 and singled out for criticism his former Rat Pack colleague Sheila Copps who had promised during the 1993 election to resign within a year if the GST was not repealed. Chrétien's response was to expel Nunziata from the Liberal caucus. However, the expulsion of Nunziata drew attention to the fact that Copps was still in office despite her promise to resign within a year if the GST was not repealed. Chrétien first stated that Copps would stay in Parliament despite her promise of 1993, but then intense public pressure (together with a poll showing Copps would win a by-election) forced Copps to resign from the Parliament. After resigning, Copps then contested the resulting by-election, where she won and then went straight back into the Cabinet. To help defuse anger over the GST issue, in the spring of 1996 the Chrétien government moved swiftly to achieve its Red Book promise of harmonizing the GST with provincial sales taxes by signing an accord with three of the four Atlantic provinces creating a Harmonized Sales Tax; the other provinces were not interested in the federal offer to harmonize their sales taxes.|$|E
