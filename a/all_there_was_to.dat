500|$|In July 1840 he {{attempted}} to fuse his desire to make money with his politics by founding a magazine called the Revue Parisienne, funded by his friend Armand Dutacq. Having already worked in the publishing industry, Balzac believed he had learned <b>all</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> know about the trade. [...] "hat gigantic machine known as journalism", he wrote, [...] "is {{as simple as a}} roasting spit turned by a poodle." [...] Balzac planned to publish his own fiction in the Revue Parisienne, in part to challenge the popularity of the roman-feuilleton serial format. Dutacq, however, stopped funding the project in September, after only three issues, and Balzac's final foray into the world of publishing came to an end.|$|E

"From these {{characteristic}} evasions, lapses of memory, hints, {{and suggestions}} the [...] committee and its staff {{concluded that the}} men they questioned, including Helms, knew more than they would say. Then why did many of them grow to trust Helms? For {{the simple reason that}} he never tried to convince them they knew <b>all</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> know, when they did not." ...|$|E

Also in the 2nd century AD, Aelius Nicon of Pergamon, the Greek architect and builder described by his son, the famous physician Galen, as having [...] "mastered <b>all</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> know of the science of geometry and numbers", was a master in composing isopsephic works.|$|E
2500|$|Charlotte {{was sent}} to court where she was educated in the {{household}} of the Queen Mother, Catherine de' Medici. Blonde-haired, and described as having been [...] "beautiful, intelligent, and immoral", {{she was married to}} Simon de Fizes, Baron de Sauve, secretary of state first to King Charles IX and afterwards King Henry III, in 1569 when she was eighteen years old. Her marriage was arranged by the powerful Guise family. In the words of historian Jean Heritier, her background meant that [...] "at twenty-one, she knew <b>all</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> be known about politics". Charlotte's alleged beauty has been contradicted by author Mark Strage who instead described Charlotte as having had a face that was [...] "more agreeable and animated than sensuous".|$|E
2500|$|The {{historical}} section, which comprises {{almost half}} the book, has already been described. This {{is followed by the}} [...] "Charges", or general rules for the conduct of Freemasons, and Payne's Regulations, the specific rules by which Grand Lodge and the lodges under its control were to be governed. The ceremony for dedicating a new lodge was briefly outlined, and the work finished with a section of songs. For the first time, the old hand-written charges and constitutions was replaced by an accessible, printed condensation of <b>all</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> being a Freemason, only omitting the ritual. Although the historical section was attacked at the time, and ever since, as being a work of obvious fiction, the work remains a milestone in masonic history. The [...] "Antient Charges" [...] published in the current Book of Constitutions of the United Grand Lodge of England have altered little from those originally published by Anderson.|$|E
