40|$|The use {{of double}} {{emulsions}} (w 1 /o/w 2) has been acknowledged as a promising strategy to reduce oil content in several food applications. Despite {{the potential of}} double emulsions for oil reduction, their sensory properties have not been investigated. In this study, we investigated sensory perception of double emulsions by descriptive sensory profiling using a trained panel (n = 11). Two sets of emulsions with either 30 or 50 % dispersed phase fraction were studied. Each set differed in composition (gelled and non-gelled inner w 1 phase, gelatin as gelling agent) and fat reduction level (30 to 50 %), but was similar in oil droplet size and viscosity. Fat reduction level depended {{on the amount of}} water droplets entrapped inside the oil droplets. Emulsions were evaluated on nine attributes describing taste (T), mouth-feel (<b>MF)</b> and after-feel (<b>AF)</b> perception, including thickness (<b>MF),</b> creaminess (<b>MF,</b> <b>AF),</b> fattiness (<b>MF,</b> <b>AF),</b> and cohesiveness (<b>MF).</b> The replacement of oil by small water droplets w 1 did not decrease the intensity of fat-related attributes. When inner w 1 droplets were gelled, 47 wt. % of oil could be replaced while increasing the intensity of fat-related attributes. This indicates that the sensory perception of single and double emulsions with gelled and non-gelled w 1 phase is mainly determined by the total oil droplet surface area. The composition of the inner water phase (gelled or not) also influences the sensory perception of double emulsions. We conclude that fat reduction up to 47 wt. % can be achieved in double emulsions while maintaining or enhancing fat-related sensory perception. </p...|$|R

Between July 2013 and October 2014 all patients undergoing ankle fusion (AF) for osteoarthritis, first metatarsophalangeal joint fusion for osteoarthritis (MF) or hallux valgus surgery (HV) were included. Patients having additional procedures were excluded. Patients completed the Manchester-Oxford Foot Questionnaire (MOX-FQ), the EuroQol EQ- 5 D- 5 L questionnaire and the EQ-VAS on presentation {{and at least}} 6 months post-operatively. 63 patients undergoing AF (n = 22), MF (n = 22), or HV (n = 32) completed preoperative and postoperative questionnaires. 76 completed preoperative questionnaires and 63 completed the follow up questionnaires. The follow up questionnaires were completed at a median of 12 months (range 6 - 24 months) following surgery. The mean age at surgery was 59 years (range 26 - 85 years). Pre-operative MOX-FQ and EQ- 5 D- 5 L scores differed significantly between the three groups with <b>AF</b> and <b>MF</b> patients reporting worse scores compared to HV patients. MOX-FQ and EQ- 5 D- 5 L significantly improved in all groups from pre-operative levels. MOX-FQ: AF from 53. 8 (CI 56. 8 – 50. 8) to 22. 9 (CI 30. 9 – 14. 9), MF from 43. 0 (CI 46. 4 – 39. 6) to 12. 1 (CI 5. 9 – 18. 3), HV from 35. 4 (CI 39. 0 – 31. 7) to 15. 6 (CI 21. 1 to 10. 1). EQ- 5 D- 5 L: AF from 0. 30 (CI 0. 43 – 0. 17) to 0. 66 (CI 0. 55 – 0. 77), MF from 0. 45 (CI 0. 52 – 0. 38) to 0. 83 (CI 0. 07 – 0. 07), HV from 0. 71 (CI 0. 74 – 0. 68) to 0. 82 (CI 0. 88 – 0. 76). There {{was no significant difference}} in the EQ-VAS suggesting it may not be representative of foot and ankle health. Health economics analysis using the EQ- 5 D- 5 L data to estimate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) suggested all three procedures were favourable compared to threshold levels of cost-effectiveness. There were differences in estimated costs between the three operations with AF at £ 2950 (threshold cost <£ 5, 400) and MF at £ 1197 (threshold cost <£ 5, 780) and HV varying from £ 625 to £ 1688 (threshold cost <£ 1640).

Our scheme extends the network coding in the binary channel to the Gaussian channel case, where XOR in the binary case is {{replaced}} by modΛ for the Gaussian case, where Λ is a high-dimensional lattice whose shaping gain is close to optimal. If the relay node re-transmits the received signal after the mod Λ operation, we can reduce the complexity compared to decode-and-forward (DF) and can get a better power efficiency compared to amplify-and-forward (AF). When the transmission powers of two nodes are different, we use superposition coding and partial decoding at the relay node. Finally, we plot and compare the sum rates of three different schemes, i. e., <b>AF,</b> DF, and <b>MF.</b> We show that by applying the proposed scheme, we can get better performance than AF and DF schemes under some conditions.

In this study, as-received and polished at dogbone SMA specimens underwent transformation induced fatigue testing at constant loading. The constant applied loading ranged from 100 MPa to 200 MPa. Specimens were thermally cycled through complete actuation (above <b>Af</b> to below <b>Mf)</b> by Joule heating and environmental cooling. There were three cooling environments studied: liquid, gaseous nitrogen and vortex cooled air. It was shown that polished specimens had fatigue lives that were two to four times longer than those of as-received specimens. Test environment was also found {{to have an effect}} on fatigue life. Liquid cooling was observed to be corrosive, while the gaseous nitrogen and vortex air cooling were observed to be non-corrosive. The two non-corrosive cooling environments performed similarly with specimen fatigue lives that were twice that of specimens fatigue tested in the corrosive cooling environment. Transformation induced fatigue testing of polished specimens in a non-corrosive environment at 200 MPa had an average fatigue life of 14400 actuation cycles; at 150 MPa the average fatigue life was 20800 cycles and at 100 MPa it was 111000 cycles.

Slitine s prisjetljivosti oblika pripadaju skupini relativno novih metalnih materijala te se od drugih slitina (npr. dentalnih slitina) razlikuju po pseudoelastičnosti i efektu prisjetljivosti oblika. Pseudoelastičnost je povezana s nastankom martenzita transformacijom austenita. Austenitno-martenzitna transformacija može se inducirati mehaničkim (naprezanje) ili toplinskim (zagrijavanje i hlađenje) metodama. Tijekom martenzitne transformacije ne odvijaju se procesi difuzije, nego dolazi do neelastične deformacije kristalne strukture.

Shape memory alloys (SMAs) {{belong to}} a group of functional materials with the unique property of “remembering” the shape they had before pseudoplastic deformation. Such an effect is based on crystallographic reversible thermo-elastic martensitic transformation. There are two crystal phases in SMAs: the austenite phase (stable at high temperature) and the martensite phase (stable at low temperature). Austenite to martensite phase transformation can be obtained by mechanical (loading) and thermal methods (heating and cooling). During martensitic transformation, no diffusive process is involved, only inelastic deformation of the crystal structure. When the shape memory alloy passes through the phase transformation, the alloy transforms from high ordered phase (austenite) to low ordered phase (martensite). There are two types of martensite transformations. First is temperature-induced martensite, which is also called self-accommodating (twinned) martensite. The second is stress-induced martensite, also called detwinned martensite. The entire austenite to martensite transformation cycle can be described with four characteristic temperatures: Ms – martensite start temperature, Mf – martensite finish temperature, As – austenite start temperature, and Af – austenite finish temperature. The main factors influencing transformation temperatures are chemical composition, heat treatment procedure, cooling speed, grain size, and number of transformation cycles. As a result of martensitic transformation in SMAs, several thermomechanical phenomena may occur: pseudoelasticity, shape memory effect (one-way and two-way SME) and rubber-like behavior. Pseudoelasticity occurs when the SMA is subjected to a mechanical loading at a constant temperature above Af. The second thermomechanical behaviour that can be observed in SMA is the shape memory effect (SME), mainly one-way SME, which is the most commonly used SME. When the sample is subjected to a mechanical loading, the stress reaches a critical value and the transformation of twinned martensite into detwinned martensite begins and finishes when the loading process is finished. When the loading-unloading process is finished, the SMA presents a residual strain recoverable by alloy heating, which induces the reverse phase transformation. As a result, the alloy recovers to its original shape. In this paper, a review of thermomechanical properties of shape memory alloys and general characteristics of martensite transformations is shown...|$|R
