It had not, we said, obtained so easy a conquest, unless by the help of certain forms of the grouped shaft. The chamfer was quite enough to decorate the archivolts, {{if there were no}} more than two; but if, as above noticed in § III., the archivolt was very deep, and composed of a succession of such steps, the multitude of chamferings were felt to be weak and insipid, and instead of dealing with the outside edges of the archivolts, the group was softened by introducing solid shafts in their dark inner angles. This, the manliest and best condition of the early northern jamb and archivolt, is represented in section at fig. 12 of Plate II.; and its simplest aspect in Plate V., from the Broletto of Como,--an interesting example, because there the voussoirs being in the midst of their above-described southern contest with the architrave, were better prepared for the flank attack upon them by the shaft <b>and</b> <b>chamfer,</b> and make a noble resistance, with the help of color, in which even the shaft itself gets slightly worsted, and cut across in several places, like General Zach's column at Marengo.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The CAD {{models of}} {{mechanical}} parts usually have many blends <b>and</b> <b>chamfers,</b> <b>and</b> {{the existence of}} these machining features can greatly change the geometric and topological patterns of the CAD models, but the existing partial matching algorithms cannot match the CAD models which contain machining features such as blends <b>and</b> <b>chamfers.</b> In this paper, a new approach to partial matching based on the constraints of transition features is proposed. Firstly, the transition features are identified by feature recognition, and then these machining features are removed to eliminate the impacts to the geometric and topological information of the CAD models, and the attribute adjacent graph is reconstructed, finally, the sub-graph isomorphism approach is used to achieve the partial matching. Experimental results show that this method can achieve partial matching of CAD models which contain machining features such as blends <b>and</b> <b>chamfers,</b> <b>and</b> the matching efficiency can satisfy the requirement of the engineering retrieval...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a numerically controlled finishing system, the Advanced Deburring <b>and</b> <b>Chamfering</b> System (ADACS). ADACS employs a user friendly, Graphical User Interface (GUI) to off-line program finishing <b>and</b> <b>chamfering</b> edges <b>and</b> prompt the operator for part cutting parameters. Given the operator-designated finishing <b>and</b> <b>chamfering</b> edges, ADACS extracts the features {{to generate a}} part finishing process plan. Collisions with the environment are detected and avoided through simulation of the cutting path before the path is downloaded to the actual hardware. ADACS interprets the finishing plan to generate motion trajectories that are tightly coupled to the tooling control. Because position control is too inaccurate for the required tolerances, ADACS uses active force control in the tool to compensate for any nominal error along the finishing path. This allows the cutter to apply a constant force to the edge. The ADACS approach to finishing parts can significantly reduce the manufacturing cost of a part by reducing rework and scrap, and improving process consistency and quality. A prototype ADACS has been built and successfully applied to aerospace test part...|$|R

50|$|Once again, {{a process}} for {{producing}} flat profiles from sheet or plate metal, however with the introduction of an additional axis of rotation, the cutting head of a CNC Plasma Cutting machine can tilt whilst being taken through a conventional 2 dimensional cutting path. The result of this is cut edges at an angle other than 90 Degrees to the material surface, for example 30-45 Degree angles. This angle is continuous throughout the thickness of the material. This is typically applied in situations where the profile being cut is to be used as part of a welded fabrication as the angled edge forms part of the weld preparation. When the weld preparation is applied during the cnc plasma cutting process, secondary operations such as grinding or machining can be avoided, reducing cost.

40|$|MastersThe {{review of}} the {{literature}} reflects variable results regarding the effect of veneering porcelain on the marginal fit of the crown coping in metal ceramic and all-ceramic restorations in relation to different finish lines, materials and systems. As the zirconia material is gaining popularity these days due to its exceptional strength and fracture toughness combined with promising esthetic results achieved by the application of its recommended veneering porcelain, {{the purpose of the study}} was to reveal the effect of Cercon® Ceram Kiss veneering porcelain (DeguDent/ Germany) on the marginal fit of Cercon® zirconia coping (Cercon® Smart Ceramic System/ DeguDent/ Hanau/ Germany) in relation to 1 mm shoulder <b>and</b> <b>chamfer</b> finish lines. Two master stainless steel models of a single posterior full-crown preparation were machined for the shoulder <b>and</b> <b>chamfer</b> finish line preparations. Then duplicated into stone models that were scanned by Cercon® Smart Ceramic System to produce thirty Cercon zirconia copings for each finish line preparation which were veneered later with Cercon® Ceram kiss veneering porcelain. The assessment of the marginal fit of the specimens was performed on the stainless steel master models in relation to 31 defined points secured with the specimen positioning device (SPD) using the direct view technique with the aid of the Traveling Measuring Microscope in relation to 1 mm shoulder <b>and</b> <b>chamfer</b> finish lines before and after the addition of the veneering porcelain. The data were statistically analyzed using Student paired and independent ttests to compare the marginal fit of Cercon® zirconia coping before and after adding the veneering porcelain for the shoulder <b>and</b> <b>chamfer</b> finish lines separately and the marginal fit of the final crowns of both the shoulder <b>and</b> <b>chamfer</b> finish lines respectively. The results indicated that the addition of veneering porcelain significantly affected the marginal fit of both finish lines preparations (P< 0. 05). The mean marginal fit of cercon® zirconia coping was (32. 23 =m ± 6. 14) for shoulder finish line and (97. 68 =m ± 9. 20) for chamfer finish line. However, the mean marginal fit of the final crown of shoulder finish line preparation (Mean of 54. 09 ± 7. 69 =m) was significantly better than the chamfer finish line preparation (Mean of 80. 85 ± 9. 29 =m).

40|$|Hip {{resurfacing}} arthroplasty {{is becoming}} increasingly popular in younger, active patients due to its preservation of natural biomechanics.

High-density open-cell reticulated vitreous carbon foam cylinders and Huntsman Pro-cast® 20 implants based on the Birmingham Hip Resurfacing implant were used.

An Ivorine central incisor tooth was prepared as master model to receive metal ceramic-crown with 1. 2 mm width of three marginal designs: shoulder, shoulder bevel and deep chamfer finish lines on the facial surface continued with 0. 7 mm chamfer on the palatal surface. After making totally 30 stone dies, wax patterns were prepared and casted. Each casting was kept on respective stone die and sectioned faciopalatally. All of the 60 sections were examined under light microscope. Mean marginal gap of shoulder-bevel was 6. 85 μm (group 1), shoulder 8. 65 μm (group 2) <b>and</b> <b>chamfer</b> 8. 35 μm (group 3).

40|$|The {{standardization}} of evaluation techniques for building extraction is an unresolved {{issue in the}} fields of remote sensing, photogrammetry, and computer vision. In this letter, we propose a metric with a working title “PoLiS metric” to compare two polygons. The PoLiS metric is a positive-definite and symmetric function that satisfies a triangle inequality. It accounts for shape and accuracy differences between the polygons, is straightforward to apply, and requires no thresholds. We show through an example that the PoLiS metric between two polygons changes approximately linearly with respect to small translation, rotation, and scale changes. Furthermore, we compare building polygons extracted from a digital surface model to the reference building polygons by computing PoLiS, Hausdorff, <b>and</b> <b>Chamfer</b> distances. The results show that quantification by the PoLiS distance of the dissimilarity between polygons is consistent with visual perception. Furthermore, Hausdorff <b>and</b> <b>Chamfer</b> distances overrate the dissimilarity when one polygon has more vertices than the other. We propose an approach toward standardizing building extraction evaluation, which may also have broader applications in the field of shape similarity...|$|E
