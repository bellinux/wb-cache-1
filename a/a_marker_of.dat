5|$|Chinese {{who married}} local Javanese women and {{converted}} to Islam created a distinct Chinese Muslim Peranakan community in Java. Chinese rarely had {{to convert to}} Islam to marry Javanese abangan women but {{a significant amount of}} their offspring did, and Batavian Muslims absorbed the Chinese Muslim community which was descended from converts. Adoption of Islam back then was <b>a</b> <b>marker</b> <b>of</b> peranakan status which it no longer means. The Semaran Adipati and the Jayaningrat families were of Chinese origin.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{diagnostics}} uses {{in vitro}} biological assays such as PCR-ELISA or Fluorescence in situ hybridization. The assay detects a molecule, often in low concentrations, that is <b>a</b> <b>marker</b> <b>of</b> disease or risk {{in a sample}} taken from a patient. Preservation of the sample before analysis is critical. Manual handling should be minimised. The fragile RNA molecule poses certain challenges. As part of the cellular process of expressing genes as proteins, it offers a measure of gene expression but it is vulnerable to hydrolysis and breakdown by ever-present RNAse enzymes. Samples can be snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen or incubated in preservation agents.|$|E

5|$|Other headgroups {{are also}} present {{to varying degrees}} and can include {{phosphatidylserine}} (PS) phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG). These alternate headgroups often confer specific biological functionality that is highly context-dependent. For instance, PS presence on the extracellular membrane face of erythrocytes is <b>a</b> <b>marker</b> <b>of</b> cell apoptosis, whereas PS in growth plate vesicles {{is necessary for the}} nucleation of hydroxyapatite crystals and subsequent bone mineralization. Unlike PC, some of the other headgroups carry a net charge, which can alter the electrostatic interactions of small molecules with the bilayer.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{validate}} hydroxyphenyl propane (LIPE®) as <b>an</b> <b>marker</b> <b>of</b> fecal output in sheep, goats, chickens, ostriches, dairy cattle, equine, buffalo, and cattle species. Feces were carefully collected from the ground to avoid contamination put into polietilene bags and further weighed. LIPE® concentration in feces was determined using infrared spectroscopy. It was therefore necessary to create a standard curve; the concentration of LIPE® in an unknown sample is calculated by interpolation on the graph of the standard curve. The values for fecal output obtained using LIPE® as <b>an</b> <b>marker</b> were similar to those obtained by total feces collection. These studies thus validate LIPE® as <b>an</b> <b>marker</b> <b>of</b> fecal output. <b>As</b> <b>an</b> <b>marker,</b> LIPE® is comparable to total feces collection in these species with a recovery rate ranging from 95. 8 to 106. 3 %.

5|$|Carpentier’s {{historical}} {{account is}} greatly simplified {{in order to}} increase the contrast between the white land owners and their black slaves. The marvellous, one of the most notable features of the novel, is used as <b>a</b> <b>marker</b> <b>of</b> contrast between the two groups: firstly, because mention of the magical always takes the form of the slaves' point of view, while the more real interpretation of each event is from the whites' perspective; secondly, because the marvellous is used as a weapon to fight injustice. Instances of cruelty and violence between the groups are recounted grotesquely in great detail, which enhances the rivalry. More importantly, by allowing readers to see through the slaves' point of view, Carpentier brings to light the power and durability of the Haitian community and destabilizes the narrative of Western supremacy.|$|E
5|$|Dissection {{occurs when}} blood accumulates {{in the wall}} of the blood vessel. This is most likely due to a tear in the tunica intima (the inner layer), {{allowing}} blood to enter the tunica media, although other lines of evidence have suggested that the blood may instead arise from the vasa vasorum, the small blood vessels that supply the outer layer of larger blood vessels. Various theories exist as to whether people who sustain carotid and vertebral artery dissection, even if not suffering from a connective tissue disorder, have an underlying vulnerability. Biopsy samples of skin and other arteries has indicated that this might be a possibility, but no genetic defect in collagen or elastin genes has been convincingly proven. Other studies have indicated inflammation of the blood vessels, as measured by highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP, <b>a</b> <b>marker</b> <b>of</b> inflammation) in the blood.|$|E
5|$|In the Western world, about 15% of {{all people}} have gallstones in their {{gallbladder}} but the majority are unaware of this and have no symptoms. Over tenyears, 15–26% will suffer one or more episodes of biliary colic (abdominal pain due {{to the passage of}} gallstones through the bile duct into the digestive tract), and 2–3% will develop complications of obstruction: acute pancreatitis, cholecystitis or acute cholangitis. Prevalence of gallstone disease increases with age and body mass index (<b>a</b> <b>marker</b> <b>of</b> obesity). However, the risk is also increased in those who lose weight rapidly (e.g. after weight loss surgery) due to alterations in the composition of the bile that makes it prone to form stones. Gallstones are slightly more common in women than in men, and pregnancy increases the risk further.|$|E

5|$|The first {{screening}} test in someone {{suspected of having}} HIT is aimed at detecting antibodies against heparin-PF4 complexes. This may be with a laboratory test of the ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) type. The ELISA test, however, detects all circulating antibodies that bind heparin-PF4 complexes, and may also falsely identify antibodies that do not cause HIT. Therefore, those with a positive ELISA are tested further with a functional assay. This test uses platelets and serum from the patient; the platelets are washed and mixed with serum and heparin. The sample is then tested {{for the release of}} serotonin, <b>a</b> <b>marker</b> <b>of</b> platelet activation. If this serotonin release assay (SRA) shows high serotonin release, the diagnosis of HIT is confirmed. The SRA test is difficult to perform and is usually only done in regional laboratories.|$|E
