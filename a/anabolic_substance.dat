40|$|The {{work done}} during this PhD program, and {{presented}} in this thesis had the goal to design, develop and characterize a system {{for the detection of}} illegal anabolic treatments in cattle breeding, independently from the particular <b>anabolic</b> <b>substance</b> used. The system is aimed to allow for faster and cheaper controls with respect to standard techniques such as mass spectrometry, gas chromatography, and histological exams. Moreover, the system allows for on-the-field controls, drastically reducing the costs related to sample transportation, analysis, and trained personnel. The main strength of this system is the independence of the anabolic treatments detection, from the particular substance employed, which makes this system optimal as screening method. Then, once identified the animals which has been treated, further analysis can be performed by standard techniques for the <b>anabolic</b> <b>substance</b> identification and quantification. The independence from the <b>anabolic</b> <b>substance</b> is achieved by adopting a novel paradigm for anabolic treatments detection, based on the identification of a common hypertrophic effect induced by the <b>anabolic</b> <b>substance</b> on an in-vitro culture of mouse myogenic cells. The cells provided with the anabolic substances receptors, are engineered to react to the hypertrophic stimulus with the over-production of lactate, which is then released in the cell medium. Then, the lactate concentration in the medium is detected by an electrochemical enzyme-based biosensor, which allows for a rapid and precise quantification by a cheap and miniaturizable device. The quantification of lactate produced by the engineered cells allows the detection of on-going hypertrophic effect and thus of the presence of anabolic substances in the biological sample collected from the cattle. ...|$|E

A liquid chromatography-negative ion electrospray tandem mass spectrometric method is presented for the confirmatory analysis of all six resorcylic acid lactones ("zeranols") in urine samples using deuterium-labelled internal standards. The method was validated as a confirmatory method for bovine urine samples according to new draft EU guidelines and showed good precision and linearity, and CC and CC values of 0. 02 – 0. 30 and < 1. 0 ng ml- 1, respectively. The applicability was demonstrated by comparing the results of an incurred sample with previous results on the same sample obtained by gas chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry.

30|$|The most {{commonly}} used illicit drugs in our study were cannabis, cocaine, amphetamine, ecstasy, and hallucinogens—drugs {{that can be used}} both as training aids or “body image drugs,” or recreationally as so-called club drugs [37 – 40]. Moreover, approximately 40 % of the illicit drug users in our sample reported polysubstance use, and the rates were significantly higher among younger participants and males. Our results could also have captured a group of young adult males who focus on physical appearance and engage in partying and risk behaviors, comparable to the gay men in the gym studies discussed above. It has been suggested that drug use practices and weight training in a male “body subculture” can be understood as a way to construct a masculine identity and to achieve an idealized male body [41]. Our estimates were higher than the estimates in a study of <b>anabolic</b> <b>substance</b> use among 611 visitors to German fitness centers, where 15.9 % reported using other illicit drugs [42]. Almost all participants in our study engaged in weight training, as opposed to 25 % of the respondents in the German study. Again, the higher prevalence rates in our study could support the notion of a physical achievement-oriented group who engage in weight training and use illicit substances for ergogenic and/or recreational purposes.|$|E

40|$|Background {{and purpose}} The {{remodeling}} of morselized bone grafts in revision surgery {{can be enhanced}} by an <b>anabolic</b> <b>substance</b> such as a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP). On the other hand, BMPs boost catabolism and might cause a premature resorption, both of the graft and of the new-formed bone. Bisphosphonates inactivate osteoclasts {{and can be used}} to control the resorption. We studied a combination of both drugs as a local admix to a cancellous allograft. Methods Cancellous bone allografts were harvested and freeze-dried. Either saline, BMP- 7, the bisphosphonate zoledronate, or a combination of BMP- 7 and zoledronate were added in solution. The grafts were placed in bone conduction chambers and implanted in the proximal tibia of 34 rats. The grafts were harvested after 6 weeks and evaluated by histomorphometry. Results Bone volume/total volume (BV/TV) was 50 % in the grafts treated with the combination of BMP- 7 and zoledronate and 16 % in the saline controls (p < 0. 001). In the zoledronate group BV/TV was 56 %, and in the BMP group it was 14 %. The ingrowth distance of new bone into the graft was 3. 5 mm for the combination of BMP- 7 and zoledronate and 2. 6 mm in the saline control (p = 0. 002). The net amount of retained remodeled bone was more than 4 times higher when BMP- 7 and zoledronate were combined than in the controls.

40|$|Background {{and purpose}} - Aseptic {{loosening}} is a {{main cause of}} late revision in total knee replacement (TKR). Teriparatide, a recombinant parathyroid hormone (PTH), stimulates osteoblasts and has been suggested to improve cancellous bone healing in humans. This might also be relevant for prosthesis fixation. We used radiostereometric analysis (RSA) to investigate whether teriparatide influences prosthesis fixation. Early migration as measured by RSA can predict future loosening. Patients and methods - In a randomized controlled trial with blind evaluation, 50 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee were allocated to a teriparatide treatment group (Forsteo, 20 mu g daily for 2 months postoperatively) or to an untreated control group. RSA was performed postoperatively and at 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months. The primary effect variable was maximal total point motion (MTPM) from 12 to 24 months. Results - Median maximal total point motion from 12 to 24 months was similar in the 2 groups (teriparatide: 0. 14 mm, 10 % and 90 % percentiles: 0. 08 and 0. 24; control: 0. 13 mm, 10 % and 90 % percentiles: 0. 09 and 0. 21). [Authors: this is perhaps better than using " 10 th" and " 90 th", which looks ugly in print. /language editor] The 95 % confidence interval for the difference between group means was - 0. 03 to 0. 04 mm, indicating that no difference occurred. Interpretation - We found no effect of teriparatide on migration in total knee replacement. Other trials using the same dosing have suggested a positive effect of teriparatide on human cancellous fracture healing. Thus, the lack of effect on migration {{may have been due}} to something other than the dose. In a similar study in this issue of Acta Orthopaedica, we found that migration could be reduced with denosumab (Ledin etal. 2017). The difference in response between the <b>anabolic</b> <b>substance</b> teriparatide and the antiresorptive denosumab suggests that resorption has a more important role during the postoperative course than any deficit in bone formation.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Remodeling of a {{bone graft}} can be {{influenced}} both by <b>anabolic</b> <b>substances,</b> {{such as a}} bone morphogenic protein (BMP) and by anticatabolic substances, such as the bisphosphonates. BMPs are potent bone <b>anabolic</b> <b>substances,</b> but also boost catabolism and cause resorption. Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast function {{and can be used}} to postpone resorption. In the present study a combination of both drugs was explored in a rat bone chamber model. Cancellous bone grafts were treated with either BMP- 7 or saline and placed in a bone chamber implanted in the proximal tibia. After 2 weeks, an injection of either zoledronate 0. 1 mg/kg or saline was given subcutaneously. The rats were killed after 6 weeks, and bone ingrowth distance into the graft and graft resorption were measured by histomorphometry. BMP- 7 significantly (p 0. 007) increased new bone ingrowth distance into the graft from 2. 0 mm (SD 0. 98 mm) in the controls to 3. 1 mm (SD 0. 93 mm). If bisphosphonate was not given, most of the newly formed and old graft bone was resorbed. A single injection of zoledronate significantly (p< 0. 001) increased the trabecular volume/total volume to 40 % (SD 9 %) compared to 14 % (SD 10 %) in the nonbisphosphonate treated.

On analysis of residual <b>substances</b> with <b>anabolic</b> effect and detection of their abuse, it is necessary to know the physiological levels of these hormones to be able to differentiate physiological concentrations from the illegal use of anabolics. The hormone concentrations exceeding the physiological ones, found on monitoring for illegal substance use, would point to the abuse of these <b>substances</b> for <b>anabolic</b> purpose. In the present study, concentrations of the natural hormones 17 β-estradiol, progesterone and testosterone were determined in bovine plasma according to animal age and sex. Natural hormone concentrations were determined using quantitative validated ELISA methods in plasma samples from cattle of different breed composition collected at several farms in Croatia during the 2006 - 2009 period. Methods validation showed good mean recovery and repeatability (approx. 75 - 87 %), demonstrating the methods efficiency in determination of 17 β-estradiol, progesterone and testosterone level in cattle plasma, respectively. The level of sex hormones was statistically significantly higher in yearling plasma as compared with calf plasma (P< 0. 05).

40|$|Skeletal muscle {{satellite}} cells {{located between}} the plasma membrane and the basal lamina of muscle fibres, could for many years, only be studied in situ by electron microscopy. The introduction of immunohistochemistry {{and the discovery}} of molecular markers of satellite cells then made them accessible for light microscopic studies and {{a wealth of information}} is today available. Satellite cells are myogenic stem cells that can be activated from a quiescent state to proliferate for self-renewal or differentiate into myogenic cells. The satellite cells are involved in muscle growth during fetal and postnatal development and {{play a key role in}} repair and regeneration of damaged muscle fibres. The satellite cells are also essential for muscle fibre hypertrophy and maintenance of muscle mass in the adult. When the present thesis was initiated, studies on satellite cells in human skeletal muscle relied on the neuronal cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) as a marker for satellite cell identification. The results from different studies varied markedly. Therefore the aims of the present thesis were i) to develop a highly reliable method using light microscopy for satellite cell identification and quantification in biopsies of human skeletal muscle in normal and pathological conditions. A molecular marker for the myofibre basal lamina or plasma membrane to enhance the reliability of myonuclei and satellite cell identification were to be included. Furthermore unbiased morphometric methods should be used in the quantification process. ii) to evaluate which molecular markers which had been described for satellite cell and stem cell identification in different cell states (quiescence, activated or differentiated) are the most useful for studies on human skeletal muscle. iii) to further explore the function and heterogeneity of satellite cells with respect to different markers in human skeletal muscle by studying the effects of strength-training, intake of <b>anabolic</b> <b>substances</b> and pathological conditions. A new immunofluorescence method was developed where in the same tissue section, two satellite cell markers, the basal lamina and nuclei were monitored. From the evaluation of different markers it was found that both NCAM and Pax 7 identified the majority of satellite cells but that both markers were needed for reliable identification. The members of the myogenic regulatory family were evaluated and by using the new method MyoD and myogenin were found to be useful markers to identify activated and differentiated satellite cells. Upon re-examination of biopsies from power-lifters, power-lifters using <b>anabolic</b> <b>substances</b> and untrained subjects it was observed that the new results on satellite cell frequency were significantly different from those obtained when using staining for NCAM and nuclei alone. In addition three subtypes of satellite cells (94. 4 % NCAM+/Pax 7 +, 4. 2 % NCAM+/Pax 7 – and 1. 4 % NCAM–/Pax 7 +) were observed. Thus the multiple marker method gave more information about satellite cells heterogeneity in human muscle and we propose that this is more reliable than previous methods. Low numbers of MyoD or myogenin stained satellite cells were observed in both untrained and strength trained subjects. Other markers such as DLK 1 /FA 1, a member of the EGF-like family and c-Met, the receptor for hepatocyte growth factor showed that satellite cell heterogeneity in human muscle is far greater than previously shown. Furthermore, new evidence is presented for so called fibre splitting observed in hypertrophic muscle fibres to be due to defect regeneration of partially damaged fibres...|$|R

All MSCs were positive for surface markers including CD 73, CD 90, CD 105, CD 44, CD 146 and CD 166, but negative for CD 11 b, CD 19, CD 34, CD 45 and HLA-DR in addition to CD 106 and CD 271.

BMP- 2 and dexamethasone in combination with TGF-β 1 or TGF-β 3 excelled at inducing chondrogenesis on SMSCs, HFPSCs and chondrocytes, as measured by glycosaminoglycans and collagen type II staining of pellets, quantitative glycosaminoglycan expression, quantitative PCR of cartilage signature genes and electron microscopy. In contrast, none of the tested growth factor combinations was sufficient to induce chondrogenesis on UCSCs-MC. Moreover, incubation of UCSCs-MC spheroids in the presence of cartilage pieces or synovial cells in co-cultures did not aid chondrogenic induction. In summary, we show that in comparison with MSCs harvested from adult joint tissues, UCSCs-MC display poor chondrogenic abilities. This observation should alert researchers at the time of considering UCSCs-MC as cartilage forming cells in tissue engineering or repair strategies...|$|R

In the future, the armamentarium against osteoporotic fractures will likely be enriched by (1.) new bone <b>anabolic</b> <b>substances</b> such as antibodies directed against the endogenous inhibitors of bone formation sclerostin and dickkopf- 1, PTH and PTHrp analogues, and possibly calcilytics; (2.) new inhibitors of bone resorption such as cathepsin K inhibitors which may suppress osteoclast function without impairing osteoclast viability and thus maintain bone formation by preserving the osteoclast-osteoblast crosstalk, and denosumab, an already widely available antibody against RANKL which inhibits osteoclast formation, function, and survival; and (3.) new therapeutic strategies based on an extended understanding of the pathophysiology of osteoporosis which may include sequential therapies with two or more bone active substances aimed at optimising the management of bone capital acquired during adolescence and maintained during adulthood in terms of both quantity and quality. Finally, one of the future challenges will be to identify those patients and patient populations expected to benefit the most from a given drug therapy or regimen. The WHO fracture risk assessment tool FRAX® and improved access to bone mineral density measurements by DXA will play a key role in this regard...|$|R

In this study, we have investigated the chondrogenic potential of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) isolated from whole sections of human umbilical cord or mixed cord (UCSCs-MC), and compared them with cells isolated from synovial membrane (SMSCs), Hoffa’s fat pad (HFPSCs) and cartilage. All MSCs were positive for surface markers including CD 73, CD 90, CD 105, CD 44, CD 146 and CD 166, but negative for CD 11 b, CD 19, CD 34, CD 45 and HLA-DR in addition to CD 106 and CD 271. Chondrogenic potential of all cell sources was studied using 3 D pellet cultures incubated {{in the presence of}} different combinations of <b>anabolic</b> <b>substances</b> such as dexamethasone, IGF- 1, TGF-β 1, TGF-β 3, BMP- 2 and BMP- 7. BMP- 2 and dexamethasone in combination with TGF-β 1 or TGF-β 3 excelled at inducing chondrogenesis on SMSCs, HFPSCs and chondrocytes, as measured by glycosaminoglycans and collagen type II staining of pellets, quantitative glycosaminoglycan expression, quantitative PCR of cartilage signature genes and electron microscopy. In contrast, none of the tested growth factor combinations was sufficient to induce chondrogenesis on UCSCs-MC. Moreover, incubation of UCSCs-MC spheroids in the presence of cartilage pieces or synovial cells in co-cultures did not aid chondrogenic induction. In summary, we show that in comparison with MSCs harvested from adult joint tissues, UCSCs-MC display poor chondrogenic abilities. This observation should alert researchers at the time of considering UCSCs-MC as cartilage forming cells in tissue engineering or repair strategies...|$|R

The society toleration is high within this field. Experimenting with habit-forming substances {{is an integral part of}} this period; therefore just this became the target of my thesis. The theoretical part brings the knowledge of individual socially tolerated habit-forming substances (alcohol, tobacco, excessive use of medicines, caffeine and <b>anabolic</b> <b>substances)</b> and of the related problems. Furthermore, this part contains specifics of university population. The aim of this thesis was to map the problem of the socially tolerated habit-forming substances in university students in term of the students preferences and attitudes towards such substances. Simultaneously, the thesis was to verify two forward hypotheses. This verification was followed by the chosen questioning method by means of questionnaires. The questionnaires were addressed to students of the South Bohemian University in České Budějovice. The research set to collect the questionnaire data is made up by 213 respondents as a whole. H 1 Hypothesis supposed that university students use the socially tolerated habit-forming substances to a higher degree during the examination period. This hypothesis was not verified. H 2 Hypothesis supposed that the student hostel life encourages and increases use of the socially tolerated habit-forming substances. The observed results brought the verification of such hypothesis. The attitude of the students towards the socially tolerated habit-forming substances is predominantly positive. The thesis brought new knowledge and mapped the situation within the socially tolerated habit-forming substances abuse in university students; hence it can serve to implementation of the effective prevention focused on this specific group...|$|R

30|$|Examples of {{systemic}} administration of <b>anabolic</b> and anti-catabolic <b>substances</b> include estrogen [7], parathyroid hormone [8], and bisphosphonates [9, 10]. In particular, systemic administration of bisphosphonates, which {{are widely used}} for cancer and osteoporosis treatment, {{is based on the}} rationale that suppression of bone resorption—achieved by this type of drugs—results in denser peri-implant bone and thereby in larger amounts of bone-to-implant contact [11]. Indeed, a recent review of animal studies indicated that systemic administration of bisphosphonates enhances implant osseointegration, especially in animals with induced osteoporotic conditions [12]. Nevertheless, the increasing number of reports in recent years of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaws has raised alarm regarding the side-effects of bisphosphonate treatment [13] and has led to the search of alternatives to this group of drugs.|$|R
40|$|O uso de substâncias anabolizantes, de natureza {{hormonal}} ou não, é muito difundida na pecuária de corte dos países maiores produtores de carne bovina (EUA, Austrália, Argentina, Canadá, etc.). Dentre estas destacam-se o banido dietilestilbestrol (DES) e o controlado zeranol, que aumentam o ganho de peso vivo, o peso da carcaça, a eficiência alimentar e o percentual de carne. O uso porém, pode ocasionar a presença de resíduos nos tecidos e órgãos dos animais que são utilizados como alimento. A presença de resíduos representa um perigo potencial para a saúde humana, o que levou vários países, inclusive o Brasil, a proibirem a utilização destes produtos. O objetivo do presente trabalho foi o de verificar, se a carne colhida no período de julho de 1993 a novembro de 1994, em matadouros frigoríficos pertencentes a Lista Geral dos Exportadores, atende a legislação vigente quanto ao uso destes anabolizantes. Para isto, foram analisadas por radioimunoensaio, 416 amostras de fígado para pesquisa de DES e 385 para zeranol. Observou-se que o DES não foi detectado em nenhuma das amostras (p > 0, 05), enquanto que o zeranol foi detectado em duas (p The use of hormonal or non-hormonal {{agents in}} livestock is widespread among the greatest meat producers, as the U. S. A., Australia, Canada, Argentina and others. These agents include diethylstibestrol (DES), which is banned, and zeranol, which is controlled. Both substances improve live weight gain, carcass weight, feed conversion and meat percentage. Their use, however, may cause residues presence in {{tissues and organs}} of livestock, which, in turn, represents a potential hazard for human health. For this reason, many countries, including Brazil, do not allow their use. This trial aimed at verifying whether beef collected between July 1993 and November 1994 in Brazilian slaughterhouses was {{in accordance with the}} current legislation in regard to the above mentioned <b>anabolic</b> <b>substances.</b> Four hundred and sixteen samples of liver were searched for DES and 385 for zeranol presence by radioimmunoassay (RIA). DES was detected in no samples (p > 0, 05) on the other hand zeranol was detected in two (p < 0, 05). Zeranol presence was confirmed by gas cromatography-mass spectrometry (p < 0, 05). Average recoveries obtained for DES were 62, 6 % ± 5, 7 in the extractive phase (³H-DES) and 83, 8 % ± 16, 8 in the extractive phase plus RIA (DES). As to zeranol, average recoveries were 63, 0 % ± 5, 8 in the extractive phase (³H-zeranol) and 94, 8 % ± 13, 8 in the extractive phase plus RIA (zeranol).

40|$|A {{major problem}} facing {{physicians}} {{involved in the}} daily care of amateur athletes in international competition is that of so-called doping. While there are many substances used that might be considered ineffectual or physiologic, the two main categories of substances considered as doping agents are stimulants and <b>anabolic</b> steroids. No <b>substance</b> is as yet known that will improve an athlete's performance. Often such substances are taken in error {{rather than in a}} misguided attempt to improve one's ability. These substances can be dangerous and, because of this, doping rules were established basically to protect the athlete. Anabolic steroids are particularly dangerous; they usually are taken by those engaged in lifting or throwing sports in an attempt to improve performance by increasing muscle bulk. There is as yet no scientific proof that performance is improved. Dope testing for stimulants should be carried out in a quantitative rather than qualitative manner so that the athlete who has taken a small amount of a so-called stimulant (such as an asthma or common cold preparation) would not be excluded from competition. Rigid testing for anabolic steroids should be continued...|$|R

The % AAFs of the DCLA was compared with those of WADA-Accredited Laboratories. In 2008, the term Atypical Finding was introduced by the WADA representing a reported but inconclusive result. A characteristic example is when a testosterone-to-epitestosterone ratio is> 4 followed by a negative gas chromatography/combustion/ isotope ratio mass spectrometry result. In a total of about 30, 000 athlete samples, 136 athletes were found with an increased testos-terone/epitestosterone ratio and 43 with tetrahydrocannabinol me-tabolite (THCCOOH) of 427 reported AAFs. Twenty-one athletes in total were found positive with methylhexaneamine, the 11 found after a batch of 1000 samples was reprocessed. Besides, there were AAFs below their Minimum Required Performance Level (MRPL). The increasing need for higher detectability imposed new apparatus, e. g., liquid chromatography/quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometry, whereas that for lowering the capital costs and reporting times led to the unification of the screening method which includes stimulants, diuretics, <b>anabolics</b> and other <b>substances...</b>|$|R
40|$|The present {{experimentation}} had two objectives, one was {{to detect}} and quantify the residues of Clenbuterol in sheep carcass after administration per os in young sheep. The scope was to define the withdrawal period of Clenbuterol before the slaughtering of the animals so that no detectable residues of the drug are left in the animal tissues. The other objective was {{an overview of the}} testing of a number of other <b>anabolic</b> <b>substances</b> used as growth promoters in urine and carcass of young beef. The Clenbuterol experimentation involved the use of 12 young sheep, (6 male and 6 female of the Chios breed) aged between 6 and 8 months. Their body weight was recorded and they were separated into two groups. The first group contained 5 male sheep and 5 female sheep. To each animal Clenbuterol was administered per os in a dose of 3. 2 μg/kg body weight for 10 consecutive days. The dose given was double the therapeutic dose that is reported for bovine. The second group contained just one male and one female animal used as controls. To those two animals physiological serum was administered instead of clenbuterol. The male animals were housed separately from females under the same housing and living conditions in the premises of the Veterinary Research Institute of NAGREF in the town of Ionia at the outskirts of Thessaloniki. All the sheep used in the experimentation were fed the same feed used in all the animals of the Veterinary Research Institute. The animal feeds used contained alfalfa hay (1. 5 kg/animal/day) and a mixture of concentrated feeds (1 kg/animal/day) The results of our experimental work regarding the clenbuterol residues found in sheep carcass after administration of the drug according to the details given were: a) In kidneys we measured by Elisa 3. 5 μg/kg clenbuterol the 4 th day after administration both in male and female sheep. The residues measured the 24 th day of administration (14 th day of the withdrawal of the drug) fell to 0. 5 μg/kg for the male and to 1 μg/kg for the female. The equivalent numbers measured the 52 nd day were ND for the male (below the detection limit of the method) and 0. 2 μg/kg for the female animals. b) In meat we measured by Elisa 2 μg/kg of clenbuterol the 8 th day after administration in male animals and 1 μg/kg in female. The levels measured were down to 0. 1 μg/kg after the withdrawal of the drug the 10 th day. c) In lungs we measured 2 μg/kg of clenbuterol the 4 th day both in male and female animals. The levels were measured down to 0. 02 μg/kg on the 24 th (14 th) day. A rebound effect to 0. 2 μg/kg was measured on the 52 nd (42 nd) day. d) In liver samples we measured by ELISA 5 μg/kg in female animals the 4 th day after the beginning of the administration of clenbuterol, then the numbers measured fell to 4 μg/kg on the 8 th day and finally down to 0. 3 μg/kg on the 24 th day. In male animals the concentration that was measured was 10 μg/kg the 8 th day and then dropped down to 0. 05 μg/kg the 24 th day. In female animals we measured a rebound effect to 1 μg/kg on the 38 th day and then a further drop down to 0. 2 μg/kg on the 52 nd day. In male animals the concentration numbers measured produced no rebound effect {{until the end of the}} experimentation on the 52 nd day. e) The concentration of clenbuterol measured on the same liver samples by GC/MS in the VSD Institute of Belfast, Northern Ireland, U. K. were for both male and female animals 40 μg/kg. On the 8 th day numbers for female animals were 45 μg/kg and for male animals 38 μg/kg.
