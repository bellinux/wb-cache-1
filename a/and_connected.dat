5|$|A helical {{resonator}} {{is similar}} to a stub, in that it requires a distributed element model to represent it, but is actually built using lumped elements. They are built in a non-planar format and consist of a coil of wire, on a former and core, <b>and</b> <b>connected</b> only at one end. The device is usually in a shielded can with a hole in the top for adjusting the core. It will often look physically very similar to the lumped LC resonators used for a similar purpose. They are most useful in the upper VHF and lower UHF bands whereas stubs are more often applied in the higher UHF and SHF bands.|$|E
5|$|A roadway {{was present}} along parts of today's H-58 {{by the late}} 1920s; initially, this county road was gravel or earth between Munising and Kingston Corners <b>and</b> <b>connected</b> with other roads to Grand Marais. In the 1930s, another segment was built to connect to Deer Park and {{to fill in the}} gap between Kingston Corners and Grand Marais. The southwestern segment between Munising and Van Meer formed part of M-94 from 1929 until it was {{transferred}} back to county control in the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|A typical {{structure}} {{would have}} {{four or more}} central posts planted in the ground <b>and</b> <b>connected</b> at the top by cross beams. The smoke hole would be left open in the center. Around the central structure there was a larger ring of shorter posts, also connected by cross beams. Rafters radiated from the central cross beams to the outside cross beams, and then split planks or beams formed the slanting or vertical side walls.|$|E

5|$|After Theophrastus, though {{interest}} in Aristotle's ideas survived, they were generally taken unquestioningly. It is {{not until the}} age of Alexandria under the Ptolemies that advances in biology resumed. The first medical teacher at Alexandria, Herophilus of Chalcedon, corrected Aristotle, placing intelligence in the brain, <b>and</b> <b>connected</b> the nervous system to motion and sensation. Herophilus also distinguished between veins and arteries, noting that the latter pulse while the former do not.|$|E
5|$|After the trachea {{has been}} intubated, a balloon cuff is {{typically}} inflated {{just above the}} far end of the tube to help secure it in place, to prevent leakage of respiratory gases, and to protect the tracheobronchial tree from receiving undesirable material such as stomach acid. The tube is then secured to the face or neck <b>and</b> <b>connected</b> to a T-piece, anesthesia breathing circuit, bag valve mask device, or a mechanical ventilator. Once there is no longer a need for ventilatory assistance and/or protection of the airway, the tracheal tube is removed; this is referred to as extubation of the trachea (or decannulation, in the case of a surgical airway such as a cricothyrotomy or a tracheotomy).|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{the city}} {{underwent}} {{a process of}} urban renewal and expansion from the 1890s up to the 1920s. As downtown Lima had become overcrowded, the La Victoria residential area was established in 1896 as a working-class neighborhood. During this period the urban layout was modified by the construction of big avenues which crisscrossed the city <b>and</b> <b>connected</b> it with neighboring towns such as Miraflores. In the 1920s and 1930s, several buildings of the historic centre were rebuilt including the Government Palace and the Municipal Palace.|$|E

5|$|By 1508, {{construction}} work was completed {{at the north}} of the Loggia, which contained the staircase to access the upper level of the public building. The construction is designed as a body in itself, separated from the main building by a path <b>and</b> <b>connected</b> to it by a covered overpass, a configuration that has come down to us intact. The contribution of Cairano, who at that point returned to the Loggia after at least five years of a stellar career elsewhere, is the portal to the ground floor of the annex and in some ornamentation on the overpass.|$|E
5|$|Cannon Street station, {{also known}} as London Cannon Street, is a central London railway {{terminus}} <b>and</b> <b>connected</b> London Underground station in Travelcard zone 1 located on Cannon Street in the City of London and managed by Network Rail.

The station runs services by Southeastern, mostly catering for commuters in southeast London and Kent, with occasional services further into the latter.|$|E
5|$|Castles, in {{the sense}} of a {{fortified}} residence of a lord or noble, arrived in Scotland as part of David I's encouragement of Norman and French nobles to settle with feudal tenures, particularly in the south and east, and were a way of controlling the contested lowlands. These were primarily wooden motte-and-bailey constructions, of a raised mount or motte, surmounted by a wooden tower and a larger adjacent enclosure or bailey, both usually surrounded by a fosse (a ditch) and palisade, <b>and</b> <b>connected</b> by a wooden bridge. They varied in size from the very large such as the Bass of Inverurie, to more modest designs like Balmaclellan.|$|E

5|$|DX arrays {{have been}} made to form hollow {{nanotubes}} 4â€“20nm in diameter, essentially two-dimensional lattices which curve back upon themselves. These DNA nanotubes are somewhat similar in size and shape to carbon nanotubes, and while they lack the electrical conductance of carbon nanotubes, DNA nanotubes are more easily modified <b>and</b> <b>connected</b> to other structures. One of many schemes for constructing DNA nanotubes uses a lattice of curved DX tiles that curls around itself and closes into a tube. In an alternative method that allows the circumference to be specified in a simple, modular fashion using single-stranded tiles, the rigidity of the tube is an emergent property.|$|E
5|$|FrÃ¸en Station was rebuilt so {{only the}} trains on the Holmenkollen Line would stop there, while Nordberg Station was closed. All the stations, except UllevÃ¥l stadion, {{were built in}} the same {{architectural}} style. They are constructed in concrete with steel columns and wooden sheds and fences. All platforms have a shed; UllevÃ¥l stadion has a larger weather cover and has a design inspired by football. The upgrade also included the installation of third-rail from Majorstuen to Stortinget in the Common Tunnel. From 10 January 1993, the Sognsvann Line re-open, and from 4 April, the line started operating through the Common Tunnel <b>and</b> <b>connected</b> to the Lambertseter Line.

5|$|Galvani's friend, Alessandro Volta, {{continued}} {{researching the}} effect and invented the Voltaic pile in 1800. The basic unit of Volta's pile was a simplified galvanic cell, made of plates of copper and zinc separated by an electrolyte <b>and</b> <b>connected</b> by a conductor externally. The units were stacked in series {{to make the}} Voltaic cell, which produced electricity by directing electrons from the zinc to the copper and allowing the zinc to corrode.|$|E
