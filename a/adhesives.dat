40|$|Graduation date: 1975 The {{quality and}} cost of wood {{particle}} composites are substantially determined by how the <b>adhesive</b> that bonds the composite is distributed on the particles. Distribution of the <b>adhesive</b> {{is controlled by the}} method of application. Currently the <b>adhesive</b> is applied by spraying it onto the particles. It was hypothesized that applying the <b>adhesive</b> as a foam would lead to improved <b>adhesive</b> distribution. An experimental system was developed for foaming a urea formaldehyde <b>adhesive</b> with liquid freon- 12 and for blending the foam with wood particles. This system was compared to systems for applying the <b>adhesive</b> as a spray and bulk liquid. Strength properties of wood particle composites made with foamed <b>adhesive</b> were found to be equivalent to those with <b>adhesive</b> applied as a spray. Applying foamed <b>adhesive</b> was superior to mixing particles with unfoamed <b>adhesive.</b> Strength properties were not correlated to <b>adhesive</b> distribution according to particle size. Foam and bulk liquid application produced <b>adhesive</b> distributions proportional to particle surface area. The spray application resulted in <b>adhesive</b> distributed disproportionately heavy on the larger particles relative to their surface area. Other factors, such as the number of particles not receiving <b>adhesive</b> and the uniformity of <b>adhesive</b> coverage on a particle surface, may explain the differences that occurred in strength properties...|$|R

5|$|An unusual type of {{predator}} deterrence {{is observed}} in the Malaysian exploding ant. Social hymenoptera rely on altruism to protect the entire colony, so the self-destructive acts benefit all individuals in the colony. When a worker ant's leg is grasped, it suicidally expels the contents of its hypertrophied submandibular glands, expelling corrosive irritant compounds and <b>adhesives</b> onto the predator. These prevent predation {{and serve as a}} signal to other enemy ants to stop predation {{of the rest of the}} colony.|$|E

The large cutting {{tools of the}} Acheulian technocomplex become smaller, as more complex tools are better suited towards the needs of highly diversified environments. Composite tools represent {{a new level of}} innovation in their increased efficacy and more complex manufacturing process. The ability to conceptualize beyond the mere reduction of stone cores demonstrates cognitive flexibility, and the use of glue, which was often processed with ochre, to attach flakes to hafts demonstrates an understanding of chemical changes that can be utilized beyond the simple use of color. <b>Adhesives</b> were used to construct hafted tools by 70ka at Sibudu Cave in South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Energy {{efficient}} and sustainability features designed {{into the project}} led to a LEED Gold certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. Elements {{that led to this}} include landscaping that reduces runoff from rainwater, lots of natural light, a more efficient HVAC system that is located under the floors, and a location near public transit. Landscaping includes using drought resistant native species to reduce the need for irrigation. The floor-based HVAC system is more energy {{efficient and}} helps keep the temperature of the entire building more even and uses radiant heating and cooling. Additionally, the construction used environmentally friendly sealants, carpets, paints, and <b>adhesives</b> as well as preventing 90% of the construction waste from entering landfills. Also, potable water usage is reduced by 40% due to the use of low-flow sinks, showers, and toilets.

30|$|In {{parallel}} to formaldehyde emission and <b>adhesive</b> mechanics, {{the addition of}} particulate fillers with high specific surface area, also significantly affected <b>adhesive</b> viscosity and, in turn, <b>adhesive</b> penetration into the bulk wood during application [18]. It is common sense in wood technology that <b>adhesive</b> penetration may be regarded {{as an indication of}} good wetting and that a certain penetration of <b>adhesive</b> into the wood bulk favours mechanical interlocking [20]. On the other hand, excessive penetration of <b>adhesive</b> is unwanted because this <b>adhesive</b> fraction does not directly contribute to the build-up of an <b>adhesive</b> bond line between neighbouring wood particles [18].|$|R
40|$|The failure {{mechanisms}} of an <b>adhesive</b> layer are generally separated into <b>adhesive</b> failure and cohesive failure.

To analyze failure of an <b>adhesive</b> bond, the <b>adhesive</b> layer may, therefore, be divided into three layers, namely, two boundary layers and an interior layer.

30|$|Different <b>adhesive</b> {{systems were}} used. Silorane has an own <b>adhesive</b> system, because {{possesses}} a different composition to the methacrylate-based composites as Supreme and Z 100.

During the restorative procedure was possible to visualize the differences in the thickness of the <b>adhesive</b> layer. According images made in stereoscope (Figure  1), it was found that Silorane system <b>adhesive</b> obtained thicker layer than Single Bond 2. This thicker layer of <b>adhesive</b> {{may have contributed to the}} higher values of BS for the composite Silorane because it could function as an elastic layer which reduces the stress of polymerization. However, further studies verifying the thickness of <b>adhesive</b> on BS should be performed [10].|$|R

An <b>adhesive</b> that is thermally activatable at 20 degrees C is used as <b>adhesive,</b> which is finally hardened by heating after deforming. The components are fixed to each other where a minimum relative movement takes place during deforming. The <b>adhesive</b> surface of the components is coated with the <b>adhesive</b> before joining. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method comprises joining two sheet metal components with one another under interposition of an <b>adhesive</b> layer on two <b>adhesive</b> surfaces that lie on each other and then deforming such as deep-drawing, bending or pressing the fabricated composite body. An <b>adhesive</b> that is thermally activatable at 20 degrees C is used as <b>adhesive,</b> which is finally hardened by heating after deforming. The components are fixed to each other where a minimum relative movement takes place during deforming. The <b>adhesive</b> surface of the components is coated with the <b>adhesive</b> before joining. The <b>adhesive</b> is solidified but not hardened before the joining, so that the free surface of the component does not exhibit <b>adhesive</b> properties. The <b>adhesive</b> layer is made of <b>adhesive</b> film {{in the form of}} a glass fiber non-woven soaked with the <b>adhesive.</b> The <b>adhesive</b> is a two-component <b>adhesive</b> consisting of epoxide resin component and a hardener. A liquid mixture of the components is introduced on the <b>adhesive</b> surface of the sheet metal components at a mixing temperature, which is less than the reaction temperature of the components and the sheet metal components are joined and fixed with cooled <b>adhesive.</b> The <b>adhesive</b> is aqueous epoxide resin dispersion with hardeners, blocked polyurethane dispersion and/or dual-cure-system. The sheet metal components are fixed to each other in another way by using a welding point than over the <b>adhesive</b> layer before the plastic deformation, and are fixed to each other by locally partially hardening of the <b>adhesive</b> layer. The <b>adhesive</b> softens at a softening temperature, which is lower than the reaction temperature, and has a melt-adhesive property in the softened condition. The fixing step takes place by locally or completely heating over the softening temperature. The sheet metal component is initially punched and then the <b>adhesive</b> surface of the punched component is coated with the thermally activatable <b>adhesive.</b> The sheet metal component consists of a semi-finished product coated with the thermally activatable <b>adhesive.</b> The semi-finished product is a sheet metal wound to a coil.

The initial <b>adhesive</b> strength increased by the use of cross-linkers such as dihydrazides and also polymeric methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (pMDI). Thus an <b>adhesive</b> with reasonable to good initial <b>adhesive</b> strength and room-temperature curing was obtained. The effect of pMDI on the initial <b>adhesive</b> strength was not significant and decreased when the amount of acrylamide in a copolymer was high.|$|R
