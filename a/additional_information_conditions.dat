Os participantes realizaram a tarefa de apoio monopodal, com olhos fechados, sobre uma plataforma de força, em duas condições sensoriais: 1) condição de informação normal - sem inclusão de informação sensorial adicional; e 2) condição de informação adicional - utilização de tira sub-patelar.

Os participantes dos grupos experimentais realizaram dez sessões de treinamento sensório-motor com prancha de equilíbrio, com ou sem a utilização de informação sensorial adicional, de acordo o grupo definido.

We hypothesised that the intrapartum fetal QT interval may provide <b>additional</b> <b>information</b> on the <b>condition</b> of the fetus, {{as it is known}} that the QT interval reacts to situations of stress and exercise. Design Retrospective study. Setting Data were substracted from a European community multicentre trial. Methods The intrapartum QT interval was measured in 68 fetuses who were acidemic at birth (pH 12 mmol/L) and in a control group of similar size. All of these cases were monitored by STAN S 21. Measurements were performed {{at the start of the}} recording at baseline heart rate, during variable decelerations and at the end of the recording. The QTc was calculated using Bazett's formula: QT/rootRR. The intervals were compared using the Wilcoxon signed ranks test. Main outcome measures Fetal QT interval, and the corrected QT interval: QTc. Results In the acidemic fetuses, there was a significant shortening of the QTc interval at the end of the recording compared with the start of the recording (397 ms at the end vs 359. 3 ms at start; P < 0. 001), in association with a significantly lowered heart rate (136. 3 vs 110. 9 bpm, P < 0. 001). Measurements of QT and QTc during variable decelerations at the start and end of the recording also showed a shortening of the QT interval (301. 9 vs 273. 3 ms, P < 0. 001) and QTc interval (381. 6 vs 340. 3, P < 0. 001), and this was not dependent on heart rate.

Methods and procedures: Literature published in English language prior to 30 November 2008 was reviewed for dysautonomic syndromes following ABI, characterized by simultaneous paroxysmal autonomic hyperactivity and motor over-activity. Main outcome and results: Sixty papers presenting 349 cases of PSH were identified, with a further 21 papers providing <b>additional</b> <b>information</b> regarding the <b>condition.</b> Only 27 of these 81 papers (33 %) utilized diagnostic criteria.

40|$|Abstract — Visual {{tracking}} {{of an object}} can provide a powerful source of feedback information during complex robotic manipulation operations, especially those in which there may be uncertainty about which new object pose may result from a planned manipulative action. At the same time, robotic manipulation can provide a challenging environment for visual tracking, with occlusions of the object by other objects or by the robot itself, and sudden changes in object pose that may be accompanied by motion blur. Recursive filtering techniques use motion models for predictor-corrector tracking, but the simple models typically used often fail to adequately predict the complex motions of manipulated objects. We show how statistical machine learning techniques {{can be used to}} train sophisticated motion predictors, which incorporate <b>additional</b> <b>information</b> by being <b>conditioned</b> on the planned manipulative action being executed. We then show how these learned predictors can be used to propagate the particles of a particle filter from one predictor-corrector step to the next, enabling a visual tracking algorithm to maintain plausible hypotheses about the location of an object, even during severe occlusion and other difficult conditions. We demonstrate the approach in the context of robotic push manipulation, where a 5 -axis robot arm equipped with a rigid finger applies a series of pushes to an object, while it is tracked by a vision algorithm using a single camera.
