These Bundles do not feature redemption codes for the Google Play store, but instead require {{the user to}} install the Humble Bundle which downloads the Android <b>application</b> <b>package</b> files for the apps directly to the user's device. Some bundles have included games available both on Android and Windows, allowing users to redeem the game for both systems. In May 2015, the Humble Nindie Bundle was introduced, {{which is the first}} Humble Bundle offering that includes games from a digital store on dedicated gaming consoles, being the Nintendo eShop on the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS in this case. Due to logistical complications however, the initial offering was limited only to North America, although future offers may expand into other territories. Similarly, in August 2016, Capcom offered several of its PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 games through a Humble Bundle (using PlayStation Network redemption codes), though also limited to North American users.|$|E
40|$|Standard <b>application</b> <b>packages</b> {{are used}} to improve {{business}} processes and to reduce costs for information systems. Standard <b>application</b> <b>packages</b> {{in the form of}} ERP systems (Enterprise Resource Planning systems) are common among private sector organizations.

Today, the design, use and distribution of standard application pack-ages are changing due to the emergence of service orientation. In the private sector, ERP systems are extended to include IT services. In the public sector, standard <b>application</b> <b>packages</b> are integrated with IT services which are often referred to as e-Government.

In the private sector, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems are extended to include IT services. In the public sector, standard <b>application</b> <b>packages</b> are integrated with IT services which are often referred to as e-Government. E-Government can be extended with mobile technology to add mobility to public processes, so called m-Government. The problem addressed in this thesis is how to improve organizational effectiveness through the use of standard <b>application</b> <b>packages</b> and IT services. The objectives are to: ­Develop a model for explaining the level of adoption of extended ERP among small and medium sized companies.    ­Identify implications and design patterns of business models for service oriented ERP. ­Establish principles for the design of local government m-services. ­Develop a method for benefits evaluation of information systems with integrated services. The thesis contributes with theory for analyzing, explaining and predicting how the use of standard <b>application</b> <b>packages</b> as well as IT services affects organizational effectiveness. To practice, it provides new concepts that can change the perceptions and mental models that IS-professionals, such as management consultants, use in their professional lives. In particular, it provides implications, design principles, a model and a method for the use of services in conjunction with standard <b>application</b> <b>packages</b> in public and private sector organizations. For future research it is suggested to investigate how service orientation affects implementation methods for standard <b>application</b> <b>packages</b> and to investigate the requirements of completely integrated e-Government on e-services, business models and back-office systems.

The most significant contributor to <b>application</b> software <b>package</b> project failure lies in the misalignment of the organisation’s business processes with the functionality of the <b>application</b> software <b>package.</b> While various IT control frameworks that may assist in the implementation of <b>application</b> software <b>packages</b> are available, the question arises why industry still reports that the success rate of <b>application</b> software <b>package</b> implementation projects remains low. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the extent to which the Projects in Controlled Environment (PRINCE 2) framework assists in the alignment of the organisation’s business processes with the functionality provided by the <b>application</b> software <b>package</b> implemented. This study investigated whether PRINCE 2 addresses all the reasons for project failure. It identifies the shortcomings and weaknesses in PRINCE 2 which may contribute to the misalignment between the business processes of the organisation and the functionality of the <b>application</b> software <b>package</b> implemented. The study recommends how these weaknesses identified in PRINCE 2 can be addressed. By taking these recommendations into account when using PRINCE 2 to implement <b>application</b> software <b>packages,</b> proper alignment between the organisation’s business processes and the functionality of the <b>application</b> software <b>package</b> may be achieved. This results in a more successful <b>application</b> software <b>package</b> implementation. Stellenbosch UniversityPublishers' versio...|$|R

40|$|An <b>application</b> {{software}} <b>package</b> implementation is {{a complex}} endeavour, and as such it requires the proper understanding, evaluation and redefining of the current business processes {{to ensure that the}} implementation delivers on the objectives set {{at the start of the}} project. Numerous factors exist that may contribute to the unsuccessful implementation of <b>application</b> software <b>packages.</b> However, the most significant contributor to the failure of an <b>application</b> software <b>package</b> implementation lies in the misalignment of the organisation’s business processes with the functionality of the <b>application</b> software <b>package.</b> Misalignment is attributed to a gap that exists between the business processes of an organisation and what functionality the <b>application</b> software <b>package</b> has to offer to translate the business processes of an organisation into digital form when implementing and configuring an <b>application</b> software <b>package.</b> This gap is commonly referred to as the information technology (IT) gap. This study proposes to define and discuss the IT gap. Furthermore this study will make recommendations for aligning the business processes with the functionality of the <b>application</b> software <b>package</b> (addressing the IT gap).
