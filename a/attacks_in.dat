50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, tens of {{thousands}} of civilians were displaced by the insurgency of the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) who were operating in the district.

5000|$|Attack : Sometimes used to {{describe}} an aggressive or provocative variation such as the Albin-Chatard Attack (or Chatard-Alekhine Attack), the Fried Liver <b>Attack</b> <b>in</b> the Two Knights Defense, and the Grob <b>Attack.</b> <b>In</b> other cases it refers to a defensive system by Black when adopted by White, as <b>in</b> King's Indian <b>Attack.</b> <b>In</b> still other cases the name seems to be used ironically, as with the fairly inoffensive Durkin's Attack (also called the Durkin Opening).|$|R
5|$|There {{have been}} many non-state <b>attacks</b> <b>in</b> Mumbai since the 13 coordinated bomb explosions that killed 257 people and injured 700 on 12 March 1993. The 1993 attacks are {{believed}} to have been in retaliation for the Babri Mosque demolition.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{programme}} evaluations {{have found that}} many resettled refugees have been the victims of verbal or physical <b>attacks</b> <b>in</b> the UK. The Home Office's 2009 evaluation notes that between one-quarter and half of each of four groups of Liberian and Congolese refugees resettled under the programme had suffered verbal or physical harassment. An evaluation undertaken by academics at Sheffield Hallam University for the Home Office in 2011 found that one-fifth of the refugees surveyed for the evaluation (who {{had been in the}} UK for a year) had been the victims of verbal or physical <b>attacks</b> <b>in</b> their first six months in the UK, and just over a fifth had been attacked in the second six months of their resettlement. Many of the victims of this abuse had not reported it to the authorities, and the authors of the evaluation suggest that this is a reason why there was a gap between the perceptions of refugee and service providers, who generally suggested that community relations were good. Verbal and physical attacks against refugees were also noted in the 2013 Motherwell evaluation.|$|E
5|$|After the September 11, 2001 attacks, Hezbollah {{condemned}} al-Qaeda for targeting {{civilians in}} World Trade Center, but remained {{silent on the}} attack on The Pentagon.

The Ottomans did not officially declare war until 11 November.|$|E
5|$|Copies of the {{developed}} film or summaries prepared by Moyzisch were promptly passed on to senior German leaders. Ribbentrop showed the initial set of photographs to Hitler immediately upon receipt. Hitler entered a conference with some Cicero materials in December 1943 and declared that the invasion in the west would come in spring 1944. He concluded, though, that there would also be <b>attacks</b> <b>in</b> other locations, such as Norway or the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|Fatal attacks {{attributed}} to the copper shark (bronze whaler) include the 2014 death of a swimmer in Tathra, New South Wales, Australia, and the 1976 death of a swimmer in Te Kaha, New Zealand.
