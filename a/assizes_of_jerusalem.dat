25|$|Because {{the nobles}} tended {{to live in}} Jerusalem rather than on estates in the countryside, they had a larger {{influence}} on the king {{than they would have}} had in Europe. The nobles, along with the bishops, formed the haute cour (high court), which was responsible for confirming the election of a new king (or a regent if necessary), collecting taxes, minting coins, allotting money to the king, and raising armies. The haute cour was the only judicial body for the nobles of the kingdom, hearing criminal cases such as murder, rape, and treason, and simpler feudal disputes such as recovery of slaves, sales and purchases of fiefs, and default of service. Punishments included forfeiture of land and exile, or in extreme cases death. The first laws of the kingdom were, according to tradition, established during Godfrey of Bouillon's short reign, but were more probably established by Baldwin II at the Council of Nablus in 1120. Benjamin Z. Kedar argued that the canons of the Council of Nablus were in force in the 12th century but had fallen out of use by the thirteenth. Marwan Nader questions this and suggests that the canons may not have applied to the whole kingdom at all times. The most extensive collection of laws, together known as <b>Assizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jerusalem,</b> were written in the mid-13th century, although many of them are purported to be twelfth-century in origin.|$|E

Grand Master, I will confess to you I have caught some {{attachment}} to the Eastern form of government--a pure and simple monarchy should consist but of king and subjects. Such is the simple and primitive structure--a shepherd and his flock. All this internal chain of feudal dependance is artificial and sophisticated; and I would rather hold the baton of my poor marquisate with a firm gripe, and wield it after my pleasure, than the sceptre of a monarch, to be in effect restrained and curbed by the will of as many proud feudal barons as hold land under the <b>Assizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jerusalem.</b> [The Assises de Jerusalem were the digest of feudal law, composed by Godfrey of Boulogne, for {{the government of the}} Latin kingdom of Palestine, when reconquered from the Saracens. [...] "It was composed with advice of the patriarch and barons, the clergy and laity, and is," [...] says the historian Gibbon, [...] "a precious monument of feudatory jurisprudence, founded upon those principles of freedom which were essential to the system."] A king should tread freely, Grand Master, and should not be controlled by here a ditch, and there a fence-here a feudal privilege, and there a mail-clad baron with his sword in his hand to maintain it. To sum the whole, I am aware that Guy de Lusignan's claims to the throne would be preferred to mine, if Richard recovers, and has aught to say in the choice." ...|$|E

50|$|A copy was edited in the Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio of Giovanni Domenico Mansi in the 18th century, {{and more}} {{recently}} a new edition has been published by Benjamin Z. Kedar in Speculum (Vol. 74, 1999). Kedar argues that the canons are largely derived from the Byzantine Ecloga, promulgated by Leo III and Constantine V in 741. Kedar believes that the canons were put into practise in the 12th century, although Marwan Nader disagrees, since they {{were not included in}} the Livre des Assises de la Cour des Bourgeois and other <b>Assizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jerusalem,</b> which were written in the 13th century.|$|E
50|$|The 13th-century <b>Assizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jerusalem</b> dealt {{more with}} {{fugitive}} slaves and the punishments ascribed to them, {{the prohibition of}} slaves testifying in court, and manumission of slaves, which could be accomplished, for example, through a will, or by conversion to Christianity. Conversion was apparently used {{as an excuse to}} escape slavery by Muslims who would then continue to practise Islam; crusader lords often refused to allow them to convert, and Pope Gregory IX, contrary to both the laws of Jerusalem and the canon laws that he himself was partially responsible for compiling, allowed for Muslim slaves to remain enslaved even if they had converted.|$|E
50|$|Because he {{had been}} the first ruler in Jerusalem, Godfrey of Bouillon was {{idealized}} in later accounts. He was depicted {{as the leader of the}} crusades, the king of Jerusalem, and the legislator who laid down the <b>assizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jerusalem,</b> and he was included among the ideal knights known as the Nine Worthies. In reality, Godfrey was only one of several leaders of the crusade, which also included Raymond IV of Toulouse, Bohemund of Taranto, Robert of Flanders, Stephen of Blois and Baldwin of Boulogne to name a few, along with papal legate Adhémar of Montiel, Bishop of Le Puy. Baldwin I of Jerusalem, Godfrey's younger brother, became the first titled king when he succeeded Godfrey in 1100. The assizes were the result of a gradual development.|$|E
