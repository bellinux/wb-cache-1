5|$|First {{responder}} – A {{person who}} arrives {{first at the}} scene of an incident, and whose job is to provide early critical care such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or using an <b>automated</b> <b>external</b> <b>defibrillator</b> (AED). First responders may be dispatched by the ambulance service, may be passers-by, or may be dispatched to the scene from other agencies, such as the police or fire departments.|$|E
5|$|Use of an <b>automated</b> <b>external</b> <b>defibrillator</b> on {{a patient}} in a metal underwire bra can cause burns, and the bra should be removed by the first {{responder}} before the AED is applied. In their 2007 season, the television program MythBusters tested the possibility of burns resulting from using a defibrillator on a patient who is using an underwire bra, and concluded that while it is possible, {{it is not likely}} unless the metal underwire is exposed and paddles of the defibrillator are very close to it.|$|E

25|$|The {{scope of}} {{practice}} of a German paramedic is not specifically {{defined by a}} decent law. Thus the allowed standard procedures largely depend on the local medical director and the employer. However, in life-threatening situations, a Rettungsassistent or Notfallsanitäter always has to perform autonomously first diagnosis/monitoring and all necessary ALS treatments until an emergency physician arrives. This includes airway management (clearing airway and oropharyngeal, subglottic and endotracheal intubation), intravenous cannulation and application of crystalloid solutions, basic medication (adrenaline, glucose, inhaled ß2 agonists/bronchodilators, rectal benzodiazepine, glyceryl trinitrate, analgetics) and resuscitation with an <b>automated</b> <b>external</b> <b>defibrillator.</b>|$|E

The first responder training is considered a bare minimum for emergency service workers who may be sent out in response to an emergency call. First responders are commonly dispatched by the ambulance service to arrive quickly and stabilize the patient before an ambulance can arrive and to then assist the ambulance crew.|$|E

2500|$|First Responders in the US {{can either}} provide initial {{emergency}} care {{first on the}} scene (police/fire department/search and rescue) or support Emergency Medical Technicians and Paramedics. The skills allowed at this level are very similar to an EMT's including bleeding control, positive pressure ventilation with a bag valve mask, oral airway, nasal airway, supplemental oxygen administration, suctioning, cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), use of an <b>automated</b> <b>external</b> <b>defibrillator</b> (AED), manual stabilization of fractures, and assisting in the administration of basic medications such as epinephrine auto-injectors, oral glucose, and inhalers. [...] They are also trained in packaging, moving and transporting patients.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike regular defibrillators, an <b>automated</b> <b>external</b> <b>defibrillator</b> {{requires}} minimal {{training to}} use. It automatically diagnoses the heart rhythm and determines if a shock is needed. Automatic models will administer the shock without the user's command. Semi-automatic models {{will tell the}} user that a shock is needed, but the user must tell the machine to do so, usually by pressing a button. In most circumstances, the user cannot override a [...] "no shock" [...] advisory by an AED. Some AEDs may be used on children - those under 55lbs (25kg) in weight or under age 8. If a particular model of AED is approved for pediatric use, all that is required {{is the use of}} more appropriate pads.|$|E
2500|$|Community first {{responders}} {{are members of}} the community who are trained to use an <b>automated</b> <b>external</b> <b>defibrillator,</b> give oxygen, and use other pieces of lifesaving equipment to assist ambulance crews, and maintain patient stability whilst professional crews are in attendance. Responders have no special dispensation to break the rules of the road whilst attending calls. Under the Road Traffic Act and various other UK traffic law, correct and permitted use of Blue Lights on a vehicle does not allow the driver to cross solid white lines to overtake, but does allow the driver to treat a red light as a 'Give Way' sign. [...] Out of all the Ambulance trusts in the UK, a handful have CFR schemes with dedicated cars, and these are not given blue lights as CFR's do not undergo blue light training.|$|E

2500|$|EMR (Emergency Medical Responder) is the first, {{most basic}} level of EMS. [...] EMRs, {{many of whom are}} volunteers, provide basic, {{immediate}} lifesaving care including bleeding control, manual stabilization of extremity fractures and suspected cervical spine injuries, eye irrigation, taking vital signs, supplemental oxygen administration, oral suctioning, positive pressure ventilation with a bag valve mask, [...] cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), <b>automated</b> <b>external</b> <b>defibrillator</b> (AED) usage, assisting in a normal childbirth, and administration of certain basic medications such as epinephrine auto-injectors and oral glucose. Due to the opioid crisis, an increasing number of EMRs are now being trained in and allowed to administer intranasal naloxone. An EMR can assume care for a patient while more advanced resources are on the way, and then can assist EMTs and Paramedics when they arrive. Training requirements and treatment protocols vary from area to area.|$|E
2500|$|A {{certified}} {{first responder}} (Also called an Emergency Medical Responder, Emergency First Responder, Medical First Responder, or First Responder) {{is a person}} who has completed a course and received certification in providing pre-hospital care for medical emergencies. Certified individuals should have received much more instruction than someone who is trained in basic first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) but they are not necessarily a substitute for more advanced emergency medical care rendered by emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and paramedics. First responders typically provide advanced first aid level care, CPR, and <b>automated</b> <b>external</b> <b>defibrillator</b> (AED) usage. The term [...] "certified first responder" [...] is {{not to be confused with}} [...] "first responder", which is a [...] term referring to the first medically trained responder to arrive on scene (police, fire, EMS). Many police officers and firefighters must be at least certified first responders. This is the required level of training. Some police officers and firefighters obtain more training to become emergency medical technicians or paramedics.|$|E

This was a cross-sectional survey conducted in two family medicine practices. We included volunteers who visited their family doctor during a period of four days. Skills were assessed in a virtual setting using a plastic manikin. Results. There were 107 participants in the sample, 60. 0 % were women. Average age of the sample was 47. 6 ± 16. 8 years. In the practical part (skills testing), the participants earned 2. 7 points from a total of 5 points. Younger participants and those who attended a course in basic life support, in the past 10 years, had a significantly higher score. Conclusion.
