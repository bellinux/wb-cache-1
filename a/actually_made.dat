5|$|Mrs. Tittlemouse <b>actually</b> <b>made</b> {{her debut}} in 1909 in Potter's The Tale of The Flopsy Bunnies where she rescued the six {{children}} of Benjamin and Flopsy Bunny from Mr. McGregor's grasp and was rewarded for her heroism with {{a quantity of}} rabbit wool at Christmas. In the last illustration, {{she is wearing a}} cloak and hood, and a muff and mittens fashioned from the wool. Mrs. Tittlemouse is a key (not a central) character in the tale, but a character incompletely personified, and one whose story Potter chose to develop in 1910.|$|E

5|$|Nominally {{based in}} Alaska, the Sea-based X-band Radar (SBX-1) arrived on Ford Island in 2006 for {{maintenance}} and repairs and has returned several times since. Primarily used as a warhead-detection radar system on a self-propelled floating platform in the Pacific, its presence on the island has been controversial. The platform, with a cost reaching nearly , has never <b>actually</b> <b>made</b> it to Alaska and conspiracy theorists argue that the platform is a mobile version of the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program.|$|E
5|$|The closing {{was criticized}} by two engineers, who {{stated that the}} company <b>actually</b> <b>made</b> a profit, but ended up paying 24% of their revenue in ticket {{commission}} to SJ and NSB. In 2003, the company had a revenue of SEK426.8 million, of which SEK411 million was from ticket sales. The company had a deficit of SEK33.8 million, of which NSB covered SEK8.1 million and SJ SEK25.6 million. However, NSB took a commission of SEK10.8 million and SJ SEK58.5 million. This gave a profit, before provisions, of SEK35.5 million. In comparison, Narvesen took a commission of 2.7% for tickets sold by NSB.|$|E
5|$|The rivalry {{began in}} 1882, when cadet Vaulx Carter reintroduced {{football}} to the United States Naval Academy. Acting {{as both a}} player and a coach, Carter procured a single game for the Academy to play. The team challenged the Baltimore-based Clifton Athletic Club to a game during the Academy's Thanksgiving Day athletic carnival. The Clifton team was <b>actually</b> <b>made</b> up of players from Johns Hopkins, who were unable to play as their school due to the institution's harsh opinion on football.|$|E

5|$|Timmy, {{the late}} Jimmy's friend, asks Langly {{to attend a}} Dungeons & Dragons game in Jimmy's honor. The game, however, is a setup to inject Langly with a drug that {{effectively}} controls the subject's mind, much like Scully and Jimmy. Frohike finds an extremely flirtatious Scully at the bar with a large cluster of men around her. He takes {{her back to the}} suite where Susanne recognizes the effects of the drug, which she identifies as anoetic histamine. She reveals that she had not <b>actually</b> <b>made</b> the compound, except for a small batch accessible only to her and Grant, confirming his betrayal.|$|E
5|$|While Fossett had financed five {{previous}} tries himself, {{his successful}} record-setting flight {{was sponsored by}} Bud Light. In the end, Fossett <b>actually</b> <b>made</b> money on all his balloon flights. He bought a contingency insurance policy for $500,000 that would pay him $3 million if he succeeded in the flight. Along with sponsorship, that payout meant {{that in the end}} Fossett did not have to spend any of his money other than for initial expenses.|$|E
5|$|A Jack Russell named Bothy {{made history}} in 1982 {{as part of}} the Transglobe Expedition. Owned by explorers Ranulph and Ginny Fiennes, he became the first dog to travel to both the north and south poles. This feat is {{unlikely}} to be repeated, as all dogs have been banned from Antarctica by the Antarctic Treaty nations since 1994, due to fears that they could transmit diseases to the native seal population. Ranulph Fiennes and Charles Burton <b>actually</b> <b>made</b> the trip to the north pole by powered sledges before signalling to the base camp that they had arrived. To celebrate their achievement, a plane was sent out to take the two men champagne, along with Bothy.|$|E
50|$|Masers {{often appear}} as weapons in science fiction movies and novels. Their {{characteristics}} often {{differ from those}} of real masers, however, and it is doubtful whether a practical maser weapon such as these can <b>actually</b> be <b>made.</b>|$|R
50|$|Like {{all members}} of the Asteraceae family, the flowers are <b>actually</b> florets <b>made</b> up of many ray corolla, each ray its own stamen. As with other plants of the tribe Cichorieae, the stems and leaves produce a milky {{substance}} when broken.|$|R
25|$|Before that time, and since, {{the idea}} of the Moon <b>actually</b> being <b>made</b> of cheese has {{appeared}} as a humorous conceit in much of children's popular culture with astronomical themes (cf. the Man in the Moon), and in adult references to it.|$|R
5|$|A Norman medieval chronicler {{claimed that}} Robert {{travelled}} to Normandy in 1051 or 1052 and told Duke William of Normandy, the future William the Conqueror, that Edward wished {{for him to}} become his heir. The exact timing of Robert's trip, and whether he <b>actually</b> <b>made</b> it, {{have been the subject}} of debate among historians. The archbishop died in exile at Jumièges sometime between 1052 and 1055. Robert commissioned significant building work at Jumièges and was probably involved in the first Romanesque building in England, the church built in Westminster for Edward the Confessor, now known as Westminster Abbey. Robert's treatment by the English was used by William the Conqueror as one of the justifications for his invasion of England.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft {{camouflage}} {{is the use}} of camouflage {{on military}} aircraft to make them more difficult to see, whether on the ground or in the air. Given the possible backgrounds and lighting conditions, no single scheme works in every situation. A common approach has been a form of countershading, the aircraft being painted in a disruptive pattern of ground colors such as green and brown above, sky colors below. For faster and higher-flying aircraft, sky colors have sometimes been used all over, while helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft used close to the ground are often painted entirely in ground camouflage. Aircraft flying by night have often been painted black, but this <b>actually</b> <b>made</b> them appear darker than the night sky, leading to paler night camouflage schemes. There are trade-offs between camouflage and aircraft recognition markings, and between camouflage and weight. Accordingly, visible light camouflage has been dispensed with when air superiority was not threatened or when no significant aerial opposition was anticipated.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} November 7, the Northwest Signal, local paper for nearby Napoleon, Ohio, {{reported}} that Deshler merchants were considering taking up a collection to send Cole to Washington; {{the following day}} the paper editorialized that she, along with whoever <b>actually</b> <b>made</b> the sign, be sent to Washington to see the inauguration. On November 19, 1968, campaign special assistant and longtime Nixon advisor Murray Chotiner proposed inviting the Cole family to the inauguration and having Vicki Cole ride the theme float. The President-elect subsequently invited Reverend and Mrs. Cole and their family to attend the inauguration; the family was brought to Washington by the Inaugural Committee. Vicki Cole carried a recreation of her sign on the theme float in the inaugural parade.|$|E

50|$|Thus, it {{was found}} that the fast wheel was used in Cyprus in the second {{millennium}} BC (which was not known before). Also, many types of pottery previously believed to have originated in Ras Shamra, Lebanon, had <b>actually</b> been <b>made</b> in Cyprus.|$|R

5|$|At the Rio de Janeiro location, {{many months}} later, Roger Moore arrived {{several days later}} than {{scheduled}} for shooting due to recurrent health problems and an attack of kidney stones that he had suffered while in France. After arriving in Rio de Janeiro, Moore was immediately whisked off the plane and went straight to hair and make-up work, before re-boarding the plane, to film the sequence with him arriving as James Bond in the film. Sugarloaf Mountain was a prominent location in the film, and during filming of the cable car sequence in which Bond and Goodhead are attacked by Jaws during mid-air transportation high above Rio de Janeiro, the stuntman Richard Graydon slipped and narrowly avoided falling to his death. For the scene in which Jaws bites into the steel tramway cable with his teeth, the cable was <b>actually</b> <b>made</b> of liquorice, although Richard Kiel was still required to use his steel dentures.|$|E
5|$|In December 1970 Gomułka {{scored a}} major {{political}} victory when Poland obtained a West German recognition of the post-World War II borders. The German side secured the right to emigrate to West Germany for the residents of Poland of German identity and to help financially those who stayed by granting pensions: hundreds of thousands eventually became affected. German Chancellor Willy Brandt, who signed the agreement, also asked on his knees for forgiveness for the crimes of the Nazis (Warschauer Kniefall). His gesture was understood in Poland as being addressed to all Poles, although it was <b>actually</b> <b>made</b> {{at the site of}} the Warsaw Ghetto and was thus directed primarily toward the Jews. The notable reconciliation process between the Polish and German nations was initiated five years earlier, when the Polish Church issued its famous Letter of Reconciliation of the Polish Bishops to the German Bishops, criticized then by the Polish government.|$|E
5|$|Mahone {{returns to}} his family home to find his son has been murdered and since he is a wanted criminal, he is arrested by the police. Mahone is {{contacted}} by Agent Don Self (Michael Rapaport), a Homeland Security agent who was working with Whistler to take down the Company. He offers Mahone freedom if he joins an unofficial operation to recover Scylla from the Company. Mahone accepts, learning that {{other members of the}} operation are Michael, Lincoln, Sara, Bellick, Sucre and computer hacker and identity thief Roland Glenn (James Hiroyuki Liao). The group devises a plan to regain the card, which succeeds, however, they learn that Scylla is <b>actually</b> <b>made</b> up of six cards held by different members of The Company. The group continues to look for the other cards, while Mahone asks Lang to find out who killed his son.|$|E

5|$|Randy Savage, who {{continued}} to sell his supposedly injured leg, lost the title to Ric Flair at a television taping on September 1, 1992 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. During the match Flair received help not only from Mr Perfect but also from newcomer Razor Ramon, igniting a feud between Savage and Ramon. Bret Hart claimed in a 2014 interview that WWF owner Vince McMahon had worked out the title-change match with Flair and Savage before hand, {{and that he was}} angry when they returned to the dressing room after the match because they had failed to do much of what was agreed upon. McMahon was that angry that he <b>actually</b> <b>made</b> them go straight back out and re-do the whole match. After producing much the same match that they had immediately prior, McMahon allegedly threw his headset onto the table and stormed off in frustration.|$|E
5|$|Canopus and Glasgow {{returned}} to Stanley, arriving there on 8 November 1914; they immediately proceeded {{to join the}} British warships concentrating off the River Plate. Canopus was ordered {{to return to the}} Falklands and place herself in Stanley to guard the port on 9 November. She arrived three days later, and began to make preparations for the defence of the harbour. At Stanley, Canopuss crew set up defences against an attack by Graf Spee. Canopus herself was beached in the mudflats in a position that allowed her to cover the entrance to the harbour and have a field of fire landward to the southeast; to reduce her visibility, her topmasts were struck and she was camouflaged. An observation post was established ashore on high ground and connected to the ship by telephone, allowing Canopus to use indirect fire against approaching ships. Some of her 12-pounder guns and a detachment of seventy Royal Marines were put ashore to defend Stanley and its environs. On 25 November, Canopus intercepted a radio message that indicated that Spee's squadron had rounded Cape Horn, though the message was erroneous; Spee <b>actually</b> <b>made</b> the passage on the night of 1–2 December. By 4 December, Canopuss crew had completed their preparations.|$|E
5|$|The {{offensive}} against the Third Romanian Army began at 08:50, {{led by the}} 21st and 65th Soviet Armies and the 5th Tank Army. The first two assaults were repulsed by the Romanian defenders, {{and the effects of}} the heavy artillery bombardment had <b>actually</b> <b>made</b> it more difficult for Soviet armor to navigate through the minefields and terrain. However, the lack of heavy anti-tank artillery caused the Romanian defense to collapse; a breakthrough by the 4th Tank Corps and 3rd Guards Cavalry Corps was established by noon. Soon after, the 5th Tank Army was able to gain a breakthrough against the Second Romanian Corps, followed by the Eighth Cavalry Corps. As Soviet armor navigated through the thick fog by compass, overrunning Romanian and German artillery positions, three Romanian infantry divisions began to fall back in disarray; the Third Romanian Army had been outflanked to the West and East. After receiving the news of the Soviet attack, Sixth Army headquarters failed to order the 16th and 24th Panzer Divisions, hitherto engaged in Stalingrad, to reorient themselves to bolster the Romanian defenses; instead the task was given to the seriously understrength and poorly equipped 48th Panzer Corps.|$|E
