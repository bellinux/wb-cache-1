By July 2012, the division had entered into discussions with ABC {{to create a}} show set in the MCU, and in August, ABC ordered a pilot for a show called S.H.I.E.L.D., with The Avengers writer/director Joss Whedon involved; it was later renamed Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. In January 2014, the series Marvel's Agent Carter was announced, joining Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. at ABC, while a put pilot order for the half-hour live-action comedy series, Marvel's Damage Control, was revealed in October 2015. While talking about Marvel potentially making comedy series, Loeb said in January 2016 that Marvel always feels humor should {{be a part of}} anything they produce, despite possibly fitting more within a darker genre, as Daredevil and Jessica Jones do, while also staying [...] "grounded and real".

30|$|This work {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} predicting the occurrences of a type of an attack, whether the actual attack requires single or multiple steps to achieve the goal. Some of the signals are meant to detect earlier steps in an attack cycle that do not involve engaging the actual network infrastructure. The results {{have shown that the}} predictive capability of the signals change over time depending on the attack type. Because the relationship of the unconventional signals and the entity ground truth seems to be non-stationary, using a cumulative training window may not <b>always</b> be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea.</b> Therefore, as <b>a</b> future work the idea of concept drift will be used to dynamically define an optimum training window for the forecast models.

40|$|This paper explores many of {{the changes}} in typical {{industrial}} assessment recommendations, which have resulted from deregulation of the electric and gas industries. While anticipating that energy efficiency would almost <b>always</b> be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea,</b> changes in rate structures and indeed the very nature of how energy is purchased can put some energy efficiency technologies outside of normal economically acceptable ranges. A major focus will be changes in and the elimination of time-of-use rates for electricity. An entire generation of DSM'ers (people working in "Demand-Side Management") worked under the principle that there was economic benefit to load leveling. Time-of-use rates are changing throughout the country and in many cases disappearing. Bulk purchase of electricity has even resulted in cases where, with minimum consumption requirements, industrial plants need to find ways to increase their electrical use to avoid penalties. Energy storage devices including thermal energy storage must be re-examined in terms of this new paradigm. There are applications where they are advisable, but for different reasons then demand management. Another area of particular interest is fuel selection, multiply fuel capability, and contracting. An industrial assessment at two neighboring plants can result in entirely different recommendations based on how energy is purchased and billed. In many cases, an industrial plant may be better off spending resources on energy purchasing agents as opposed to anything like an energy efficiency project. Onsite generation of power and the changing rationales for its adoption has also experienced big changes. Energy security is becoming a strong motivation for industrial plants, options are increased, and third party funding is also starting to appear. Intermediate solutions like gas driven compressors bring these two areas together and leave industrial clients with more options but often more confusion than ever before. Finally, the paper discusses some of the new challenges facing an industrial assessment team in terms of information gathering. It is becoming necessary to examine many possible energy purchase options and each has ramifications on energy efficiency projects. Use of the Internet, computer tools and other information sources is presented...|$|R
40|$|Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) is {{a general}} {{sequential}} decision-making model where the effects of actions are nondeterministic and only partial information about world states is available. However, finding near optimal solutions for POMDPs is computationally difficult. Value iteration is a standard algorithm for solving POMDPs. It conducts a sequence of dynamic programming (DP) updates to improve value functions. Value iteration is inefficient for two reasons. First, a DP update is expensive due to the need of accounting for all belief states in a continuous belief space. Second, value iteration needs to conduct {{a large number of}} DP updates before its convergence. This thesis investigates two ways to accelerate value iteration. The work presented centers around the idea of conducting DP updates and therefore value iteration over a belief subspace, a subset of belief space. The first use of belief subspace is {{to reduce the number of}} DP updates for value iteration to converge. We design a computationally cheap procedure considering a belief subspace which consists of a finite number of belief states. It is used as an additional step for improving value functions. Due to additional improvements by the procedure, value iteration conducts fewer DP updates and therefore is more efficient. The second use of belief subspace is to reduce the complexity of DP updates. We establish a framework on how to carry out value iteration over a belief sub-space determined by a POMDP model. Whether the belief subspace is smaller than the belief space is model-dependent. If this is true for a POMDP, value iteration over the belief subspace is expected to be more efficient. Based on this framework, we study three POMDP classes with special problem characteristics and propose different value iteration algorithms for them. (1) An informative POMDP assumes that <b>an</b> agent <b>always</b> has <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> about the world states. The subspace determined by the model is much smaller than the belief space. Value iteration over the belief subspace is more efficient for this POMDP class. (2) A near-discernible POMDP assumes that the agent can get <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> about states once in a while if it executes some particular actions. For such a POMDP, the belief subspace determined by the model can be of the same size as the belief space. We propose an anytime value iteration algorithm which focuses the computations on a small belief subspace and gradually expand it. (3) A more general class than near-discernible POMDPs assumes that the agent can get <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> about states with a high likelihood once in a while if it executes some particular actions. For such POMDPs, we adapt the anytime algorithm to conduct value iteration over a growing belief subspace...|$|R

Entrepreneurship is a worldwide phenomenon. It has taken on greater momentum since the 1950 s. It entails {{the idea that there}} are certain persons, comprising perhaps only about 5 - 10 % of the general populace, (Rasheed 2001) or 10 - 15 % (Bolton 1986 cited Bolton and Thompson 2004) or even 40 % {{in the case of the}} US (Bygrave 1998 cited Bolton and Thompson 2004) who, due either to natural makeup or environmental upbringing, are dreamers, planners and, most importantly, innovators. They may or may not be well educated. They may or may not be good market analysts. They may or may not be, obstructed by red tape. They may or may not <b>always</b> have <b>a</b> particularly <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> or plan. But what we do find is that they universally possess the drive, the innovation, the focus and the resourcefulness to get a project from dream to business plan, to financial backing to implementation. And they have the resilience to persistently pursue this process, through failure after failure, but always learning, until they hit commercial ‘pay dirt’. They also lead and build good professional teams that are empowered to integrate their personal vision in line with that of their managed customer markets and enterprises. In order to understand the phenomenon better, the study of entrepreneurship has evolved as a multidisciplinary theory. Entrepreneurship itself has a variable nature with a diverse knowledge base, operating at different levels within organisations leading to many different definitions being used by academics and business writers. Initially, studies focussed on entrepreneurial traits, or the personality of entrepreneurs. But that focus has shifted from the entepreneur, to the organisation to process, based on the driving force of the entrepreneur in a business context, with a premium on serving the valued customer.
