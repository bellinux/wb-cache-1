500|$|At {{the end of}} the tour, O'Neill {{garnered}} controversy {{by writing}} outspoken newspaper columns accusing opposition pace spearhead Charlie Griffith of chucking. He was one of several Australians who took exception to Griffith's bowling action, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> name to a series of feature articles in Sydney's Daily Mirror. These labelled Griffith as [...] "an obvious chucker", saying the hosts had been [...] "wrong to play" [...] him. O'Neill stated that [...] "If he is allowed to continue throwing, he could kill someone". O'Neill also expressed his desire to not have to face bowling that he deemed to be illegal. When the Daily Mirror syndicated the columns, London's Daily Mail ignored an embargo and printed the pieces while the Australians were on their homeward flight, putting O'Neill in breach of his tour contract, which forbade players from commenting in the media during tours.|$|E
500|$|Gloucester {{died within}} days of being arrested for treason in 1447. The house passed to the crown before being {{occupied}} by Edward's nephew Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York by 1457. [...] The former Lord Protector kept 400 gentlemen and men-at-arms at the castle in his pursuit of his claim to the throne, but was killed at the Battle of Wakefield in 1460. [...] This London powerbase allowed York's son to take the crown {{in the hall of}} the castle as Edward IV whilst Henry VI and Margaret of Anjou were campaigning in northern England. [...] Edward gave the castle to his mother on 1 June 1461, a few weeks before his coronation, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> family there for safety before the decisive Battle of Barnet. After Edward V and his brother Richard were declared illegitimate in 1483 and imprisoned in the Tower of London, Edward's brother Richard assumed the title of King at Baynard's Castle, as depicted in Shakespeare's play Richard III.|$|E
500|$|RKO {{appeared}} {{in good shape}} to build on its recent successes, but the year brought a number of unpleasant harbingers for all of Hollywood. The British government imposed a 75% tax on films produced abroad; along with similarly confiscatory taxes and quota laws enacted by other countries, {{this led to a}} sharp decline in foreign revenues. The postwar attendance boom peaked sooner than expected and television emerged as a competitor for audience interest. Across the board, profits fell—a 27% drop for the Hollywood studios from 1946 to 1947. The phenomenon that would become known as McCarthyism was building strength, and in October, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) began hearings into Communism in the motion picture industry. Two of RKO's top talents, Dmytryk and producer Adrian Scott, refused to cooperate. As a consequence, they were fired by RKO per the terms of the Waldorf Statement, the major studios' pledge to [...] "eliminate any subversives". Scott, Dmytryk, and eight others who also defied HUAC—dubbed the Hollywood Ten—were blacklisted across the industry. Ironically, the studio's major success of the year was Crossfire, a Scott–Dmytryk film. Odlum concluded it was time to exit the film business, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> remaining RKO shares—approximately 25% of the outstanding stock—on the market. Before the turn of the year, the Pathé-branded newsreel was sold to Warner Bros. For her performance in The Farmer's Daughter (1947), a coproduction with Selznick's Vanguard Films, Loretta Young won the Best Actress Oscar the following March. It {{would turn out to be}} the last major Academy Award for an RKO picture.|$|E

60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> two dainty {{little white}} figures, bending, on each flank, {{to stop up}} <b>his</b> corners. But <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> the taller inside on the right, and outside on the left. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> Greek chorus of observant and moralizing persons {{on each side of}} his main action.|$|R

2500|$|Groucho {{maintained}} his irrepressible {{sense of humor}} to the very end, however. [...] George Fenneman, his radio and TV announcer, good-natured foil, and lifelong friend, often related a story {{of one of his}} final visits to Groucho's home: When the time came to end the visit, Fenneman lifted Groucho from his wheelchair, put his arms around his torso, and began to [...] "walk" [...] the frail comedian backwards across the room towards his bed. As he did, he heard a weak voice in his ear: [...] "Fenneman," [...] whispered Groucho, [...] "you always were a lousy dancer." [...] When a nurse approached him with a thermometer during his final hospitalization, explaining that she wanted to see if he had a temperature, he responded, [...] "Don't be silly—everybody has a temperature." [...] Actor Elliott Gould recalled a similar incident: [...] "I recall the last time I saw Groucho, he was in the hospital, and he had tubes in his nose and what have you," [...] he said. [...] "And when he saw me, he was weak, but he was there; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> fingers on the tubes and played them like it was a clarinet. Groucho played the tubes for me, which brings me to tears." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{gave way}} at last, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> 'and in 'is trouser-pocket for the key, and then found it wasn't there.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it's all right. There's {{nothing to}} worry about. Will you come up now?" [...] <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> hand under his father's arm.|$|E
