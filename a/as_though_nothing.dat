5|$|During the pre-dawn {{coup and}} {{throughout}} the day, there was little reaction by the public who went about their daily life <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>nothing</b> had happened. Many appeared unaware that a coup had occurred {{while they were still}} sleeping. There was no disruption to road traffic or the media, and although flights were halted in the morning, they resumed in the afternoon. There were plans to enact a curfew but this was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Bart {{learns that}} the couple {{have lost their jobs}} and feels remorseful. After Seymour apologizes to Bart for {{embarrassing}} him, Bart encourages the former principal to stand up for himself and Edna. Agreeing to Bart's comment, Seymour and Edna lock down the school, call the media (with Bart's help) and make their demands: They want their jobs back and the townspeople to not interfere with their relationship. However, several residents reply with their accusation about the two having sexual intercourse in the janitor's closet described by their children. Seymour insists nothing of the sort happened and that he is a virgin. At first, everyone is speechless, but being on the basis of being such an embarrassing thing for someone his age to admit, they {{think it has to be}} true. Realizing that they have overreacted over the relationship, the residents peacefully leave, believing that no one would pretend to be a 44-year-old virgin. Chalmers agrees to reinstate Seymour and Edna <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>nothing</b> ever happened, but insists that they keep their relationship at a minimum level during school days. The couple decide to continue their relationship more privately than ever by convincing Bart that they have broken up after thanking him for helping them. They then go back into their relationship and enter the janitor's closet where they presumably have sex.|$|E
25|$|Dmitry's {{mother died}} in 1911, at her funeral the grand duke’s poor {{eyesight}} became the source of temporary mirth {{at the end of}} the ceremony when he tried to kiss the icon his mother held in her hands. Unable to see clearly, he misjudged the distance and, bending forward to make his farewell, missed the open coffin completely, tumbling off the steps with a loud crash as his ceremonial saber and medals struck the stone floor. Relatives rushed to his side, but the grand duke appeared unfazed and went on <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>nothing</b> had happened.|$|E

25|$|North Vietnamese {{security}} forces simply captured a team, turned its radio operator, {{and continued to}} broadcast <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>nothing</b> had happened. Supplies and reinforcements were requested, parachuted in to the requesting team's location, and were likewise captured. During the period 1960–1968 both the CIA and MACSOG dispatched 456 South Vietnamese agents to either their deaths or long incarcerations in northern prisons. Hanoi continued this process year after year, learning SOG's operational methods and bending them to its purpose. In the end, it was running {{one of the most}} successful counterintelligence operations of the post-Second World War period.|$|E
500|$|David {{quit his}} writing job at SNL {{in the first}} season, only to show up to work {{a few days later}} acting <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>nothing</b> had happened. That event {{inspired}} a second-season episode of Seinfeld entitled [...] "The Revenge". David met his future Seinfeld stars during that early stage of his career: he worked with Michael Richards (Kramer) on Fridays and with Julia Louis-Dreyfus (Elaine) [...] on SNL. He can be heard heckling Michael McKean when McKean hosted SNL in 1984, and he {{can be seen in the}} sketch [...] "The Run, Throw, and Catch Like a Girl Olympics" [...] when Howard Cosell hosted the season finale in 1985.|$|E
500|$|Allen revisits some of {{the themes}} he had {{explored}} in Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989), such as the existence of justice in the universe. Both films feature a murder of an unwanted mistress, and [...] "offer a depressing view on fate, fidelity, {{and the nature of}} man". That film's protagonist, Judah Rosenthal, is an affluent member of the upper-middle class having an extramarital affair. After he tries to break the affair off, his mistress blackmails him and threatens to go to his wife. Soon, Rosenthal decides to murder his mistress, but is racked with guilt over violating his moral code. Eventually, he learns to ignore his guilt and go on <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>nothing</b> has happened. Philip French compared the two films' plots and themes in The Observer, and characterised Match Points as a [...] "clever twist on the themes of chance and fate".|$|E

500|$|To {{reflect the}} {{attitude}} of the country’s leaders, Vietnam's state-controlled media stepped up its propaganda war against the Khmer Rouge, with the official Nhân Dân newspaper regularly calling for international intervention to save the Kampuchean people from domestic terror initiated by the Khmer Rouge regime. Furthermore, instead of sending congratulatory messages like they had done in the previous years, the Vietnamese media changed their tone and began referring to the Kampuchean Government as the [...] "Pol Pot-Ieng Sary clique" [...] as the Kampuchean military continued their campaign in Vietnam. By the end of June, the Vietnamese military assembled a multi-division task force to launch another limited-objective campaign against the Kampucheans. Again, the Vietnamese pushed the Kampuchean forces back into the provincial cities of Suong and Prey Veng and then pulled out. However, as they had done before, the Kampuchean Army moved its artillery back towards the border and continued shelling Vietnamese villages <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>nothing</b> had happened.|$|E
500|$|... "Talking Heads" [...] {{received}} positive reviews. Of Kathy Searle's {{appearance as}} [...] "steely" [...] Irina, CelebrityNetWorth said, [...] "Searle impressively {{took on a}} Russian accent with flying colors in the series Body Of Proof". Orlando expressed her disappointment at John Carroll Lynch's character Bud Morris not appearing in this episode saying, [...] "The show lacked his sarcastic wit and his banter with Megan. We're just a few episode's into this show and I've already been enjoying their chemistry". She also praised Searle's performance saying, [...] "When Irina described cutting up Callum's body it was with an eerie coldness. She liked the man and he cared for her. Yet, once dead {{he was no longer}} an asset to her but a problem that needed to be disposed of, literally. I could only imagine the parts of yourself you'd have to shut down {{to be able to take}} a hacksaw to someone you were fond of". Also praising Kelly AuCoin's performance, she said that she wasn't [...] "sure who was more disturbing, Irina or the landlord who swung a hammer at the man's head and then went on with his day <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>nothing</b> had occurred". Finally, she praised the scenes between Megan and Lacey (Mary Mouser).|$|E
2500|$|Under Cao Cao, Qin Yilu {{was given}} a {{position}} as the Chief (長) of Zhi County (銍縣), a small county in the Pei State (沛國). When Liu Bei rebelled against Cao Cao and passed by Xiaopei (小沛; present-day Pei County, Jiangsu), Liu Bei's general Zhang Fei called on Qin Yilu and scorned him, [...] "Another man took your wife, but you chose to be a magistrate under him! How can you behave so ignorantly <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>nothing</b> has happened! You wish to follow us?" [...] Qin Yilu followed Liu Bei and travelled for several li before he regretted and decided to leave. Zhang Fei killed him.|$|E

2500|$|In February 1881, Luke Short and {{professional}} gambler and gunfighter Charlie Storms had a verbal altercation about a faro game which was defused by Bat Masterson, who knew both men. On February 28, Storm confronted Short once again outside the Oriental Saloon. This time {{he pulled a}} [...]45 caliber revolver. But Storm was too slow and Short {{shot him in the}} chest at point-blank range, his muzzle flash setting Storms' clothes on fire. Short shot Storms again before his body hit the ground. George Parsons witnessed Storms' death and wrote in his journal, [...] "The faro games went right on <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>nothing</b> had happened." [...] Short was arrested but the shooting was ruled as self defense. Short left Tombstone in April and returned to Leadville, Colorado.|$|E
2500|$|Guan Yu {{was once}} {{injured in the}} left arm by a stray arrow, which pierced through his arm. Although the wound had healed, he would {{experience}} pain in the bone whenever there was a heavy downpour. A physician told him, [...] "The arrowhead had poison on it and the poison had seeped into the bone. The {{way to get rid}} of this problem is to cut open your arm and scrape away the poison in your bone." [...] Guan Yu then stretched out his arm and asked the physician to heal him. He then invited his subordinates to dine with him while the surgery was being performed. Blood flowed from his arm into a container below. Throughout the operation, Guan Yu feasted and drank wine and chatted with his men <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>nothing</b> had happened.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the general}} He Jin rose {{to power in}} 189 and became regent to the child Emperor Shao, he {{recruited}} over 20 notable members of scholar-gentry background to join the civil service. Xun You was one of them. He was appointed as a [...] "Gentleman of the Yellow Gate" [...] (黃門侍郎) in the imperial capital, Luoyang. However, within the same year, He Jin was assassinated by the eunuch faction led by the Ten Attendants. The warlord Dong Zhuo {{took advantage of the}} ensuing political turmoil to hijack and control the central government. Between 190 and 191, several regional warlords formed a coalition and launched a campaign against Dong Zhuo in the name of saving the emperor. Dong Zhuo ordered Luoyang to be burnt down and relocated the capital to Chang'an. In Chang'an, Xun You secretly plotted with Zheng Tai (鄭泰), He Yong, Chong Ji (种輯) and Wu Qiong (伍瓊) to assassinate Dong Zhuo, who was notorious for his cruelty and tyranny. However, they were discovered and Xun You was arrested and imprisoned. While he was incarcerated, Xun You spoke and behaved normally <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>nothing</b> had happened. He was only released after Dong Zhuo was killed in 192. However, the Wei Shu mentioned that Xun You was released after he sent someone to persuade and convince Dong Zhuo to free him.|$|E

2500|$|In 236, Sun Quan {{launched}} a campaign against Wei and he ordered Lu Xun and Zhuge Jin to lead an army to attack the Wei-controlled Xiangyang Commandery. Lu Xun sent a close aide, Han Bian (韓扁), to deliver a report to Sun Quan. On the journey back, Han Bian encountered the enemy at Mianzhong (沔中) and was captured. When Zhuge Jin received news of Han Bian's capture, he became fearful and wrote to Lu Xun: [...] "His Majesty has withdrawn his forces. The enemy has captured Han Bian and they know our situation. The rivers have dried up so we should make a hasty retreat." [...] Lu Xun did not respond, and he instructed his men to plant turnips and peas, while he played weiqi and other games with his officers <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>nothing</b> had happened. Zhuge Jin said, [...] "Boyan possesses intelligence and strategy, he knows what he's doing." [...] He came to see Lu Xun, who told him, [...] "The enemy knows that His Majesty has withdrawn his forces, so they have no worries and will concentrate their attacks on us. Besides, they have already stationed troops at critical positions and are poised to strike. Hence, we should remain composed and calm our men, after which {{we will have a}} change of plans and prepare to withdraw. If we display signs of retreat now, the enemy will think that we are afraid and will definitely attack us, resulting in defeat for us." ...|$|E

60|$|Sir Nathaniel {{stopped and}} looked around, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> to lose <b>nothing</b> of the effect. The sun had climbed the eastern sky and was making all details clear.

Having done so, he covered the ground more slowly, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> inviting attention to detail. Adam was a willing and attentive pupil, and followed his motions exactly, missing--or trying to miss--nothing.|$|R
