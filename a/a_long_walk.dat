According to the autopsy, Morphy had suffered a stroke brought on by entering cold water after <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>walk</b> in the midday heat. The Morphy mansion, sold by the family in 1891, became the site of the well-known restaurant Brennan's.|$|E
25|$|A {{route from}} Seathwaite not {{designed}} for the ascent of Great Gable can be found by climbing up Styhead pass and then branching off into Mitchell Cove, following the beck almost to the summit. Aaron Slack can also be used. If starting from Ennerdale <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>walk</b> up the valley can culminate in either a climb up Stone Cove to Windy Gap, or a slightly easier ascent of the Tongue to reach Gillercomb Head. Indirect climbs via Brandreth or Base Brown are also possible.|$|E
25|$|Càrn Mairg is {{commonly}} climbed {{with the other}} three Munros of the Càrn Mairg group (Meall Garbh, Meall nan Aighean and Càrn Gorm). With a height of 1041 metres (3415feet) it is the highest {{of the group and}} qualifies as a Munro and a Marilyn. The terrain of the Càrn Mairg range is similar to high, rolling moorland with only small depressions between the four Munros, a landscape which is suitable for ski mountaineering and has been likened to the Cairngorms, however the circuit of the hills is <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>walk</b> being almost 18km in length.|$|E

25|$|Scarth Gap can {{be gained}} {{from the head of}} Ennerdale, but this is <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>walk</b> from {{anywhere}} except Black Sail Youth Hostel. Scarth Gap provides the more regular approach from the Buttermere valley, parking being available at Gatesgarth. On the Buttermere side a path cuts off the corner {{at the top of the}} pass and removes the need to first ascend Seat, before the long assault on the screes of Gamlin End. From the shore of Buttermere Wainwright noted that an ascent may be made via Birkness Comb, climbing a grassy rake through the crags.|$|E
25|$|Between 1998 and 2002, in {{preparation}} for the 2002 Commonwealth Games, the station underwent a £100 million redevelopment. The glass roof of the trainshed, which is Grade II listed was re-glazed and re-painted. A new main entrance and enlarged concourse with a mezzanine level, designed by BDP, replaced the 1960s structure which had become insufficient for the number of passengers. A moving walkway was installed to take passengers from the concourse to platforms 13 and 14 at the far south end of the station which involves <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>walk.</b> Another entrance was also created on Fairfield Street to access a new taxi rank and drop-off point for cars.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps most walkers {{will arrive}} at Sail {{as part of}} a ridge-top traverse, {{starting}} either with Grasmoor or Causey Pike. Direct routes from the north east begin at either Braithwaite or Stair. From the former the track to High Coledale Farm is the initial objective, before crossing the Outerside ridge in the vicinity of Stile End. The path then rises to Sail Pass from the north. Starting from Stair, the Stoneycroft Mine Road also gives access to Sail Pass, via the cobalt mine. From Buttermere village <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>walk</b> up Sail Beck and 'behind' Ard Crags can be used to gain Sail Pass from the other side.|$|E

25|$|Back in {{the present}} moment, it is the eighth day after the narrator's plane crash and the narrator is dying of thirst; miraculously, {{following}} <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>walk,</b> he and the prince find a well. The narrator later finds the prince talking to the snake, discussing his return home and his eagerness to see his rose again, who he worries has been left to fend for herself. The prince bids an emotional farewell to the narrator and states that if {{it looks as though}} he has died, it is only because his body was too heavy to take with him to his planet. The prince warns the narrator not to watch him leave, as it will upset him. The narrator, realizing what will happen, refuses to leave the prince's side. The prince consoles the narrator by saying that he only need look at the stars to think of the prince's lovable laughter, and that it will seem as if all the stars are laughing. The prince then walks away from the narrator and allows the snake to bite him, soundlessly falling down.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} of their second Star-Club visit from 1–14 November 1962, Starr had become the group's drummer. The Beatles stayed at the Hotel Germania (Detlev-Bremer-Strasse 8), having the luxury of single rooms for the first time, and then stayed at the Hotel Pacific (Neuer Pferdemarkt 30) for another booking from 18–31 December 1962. Harrison said: [...] "We came back to play the Star-Club, a big place and fantastic because it had a great sound system. This time we had a hotel. I {{remember}} it was quite <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>walk</b> from the club, {{at the top of the}} Reeperbahn going back towards the city." [...] Portions of their final performances were taped with a portable recorder by an associate of Ted [...] "King Size" [...] Taylor of the Dominoes, another group playing at the club. The tapes were released on West Germany's Bellaphon label in 1977 as The Beatles: Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962, and subsequently re-released in various formats and titles.|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{the latter}} part of Speer's imprisonment, Wolters was a {{faithful}} correspondent, writing lengthy letters to Speer at least once a month, attempting to tell Speer everything that might interest him but nothing that might hurt him. [...] When Speer invented the concept of his [...] "world wide walk", imagining his daily exercise around the prison yard to be segments in <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>walk</b> from Europe through Asia to North America, Wolters supplied Speer with details of what he would [...] "see". [...] Speer later stated, [...] "In a manner of speaking, Rudi Wolters accompanied me on these walks." [...] As midnight struck and October 1, 1966 began, Speer was released from Spandau Prison. [...] His last use of the clandestine message system was to have a telegram sent to Wolters, in which Speer jokingly asked Wolters to pick him up thirty-fivekilometres south of Guadalajara, Mexico, which he had [...] "reached" [...] after walking 31,936kilometres.|$|E

500|$|When Anastasia was born, {{her parents}} and {{extended}} family were disappointed {{that she was a}} girl. They hoped for a son who would be heir apparent to the throne. Tsar Nicholas [...] II went for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>walk</b> to compose himself before going to visit Tsarina Alexandra and the newborn Anastasia for the first time. One meaning of her name is [...] "the breaker of chains" [...] or [...] "the prison opener." [...] The fourth grand duchess received her name because, in honor of her birth, her father pardoned and reinstated students who had been imprisoned for participating in riots in St. Petersburg and Moscow the previous winter. Another meaning of the name is [...] "of the resurrection", a fact often alluded to later in stories about her rumored survival. Anastasia's title is most precisely translated as [...] "Grand Princess". [...] "Grand Duchess" [...] became the most widely used translation of the title into English from Russian.|$|E
500|$|An early {{version of}} the film focused on Joy and Fear getting lost together, as {{it seemed to be}} the most humorous choice. By July 2012, the project was set for an {{evaluation}} screening with other Pixar filmmakers. Docter gradually began to feel that the story was not working, which made him think that he might get fired. He took <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>walk</b> one Sunday, where he began to consider himself a failure, and that he should resign from the film. While pondering what he would miss about Pixar, he concluded that he would miss his coworkers and friends most of all. He soon reached a breakthrough: that emotions are meant to connect people together, and that relationships are the most important things in life. He decided to replace Fear with Sadness, which he felt is crucial to renewal. He met with Rivera and Del Carmen that night to explain his change of plans, and to his surprise, they reacted positively to it. At the screening, he informed his superiors that new plans for the film were in order. Although it was a [...] "scary moment", the film remained in production.|$|E

2500|$|The final pre-audience voting {{cut down}} {{took place at}} the Pasadena Civic Center on January 14 or 15, 2007, just before the {{regional}} audition shows began airing. Without any further auditioning, but possibly with some audience research having taken place, the 40 remaining contestants were reduced to 24. In a process taking a whole day, contestants wait in a sitting room until one by one, they go up an elevator and take <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>walk</b> {{to the other end of}} the Center's Gold Room.

2500|$|Carnedd Llewelyn lies in {{the middle}} of the main {{north-east}} to south-west ridge of the Carneddau, between Carnedd Dafydd to the south-west and Foel Grach to the north. A short subsidiary ridge links it to Yr Elen to the north-west. Its position means that any route to this summit involves <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>walk.</b> It can be climbed from Gerlan, above Bethesda, taking the path following Afon Llafar then continuing to the summit of Yr Elen before following the short ridge to Carnedd Llewelyn. Another path starts from Helyg on the A5, taking the track to the reservoir then following the slopes above Craig yr Ysfa to the summit. An alternative is to reach it by following the main ridge, either from Pen yr Ole Wen or from Foel-fras.|$|E

[...] Unless required by other duties, the Carthusian hermit leaves his cell daily only for three prayer services in the monastery chapel, including the community Mass, and occasionally for conferences with his superior. Additionally, once a week, the community members take <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>walk</b> in the countryside during which they may speak.
