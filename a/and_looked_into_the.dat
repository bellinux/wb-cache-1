500|$|The Giro's {{fourth stage}} saw a tough stage with poor {{conditions}} for the riders, which ultimately led to the withdrawal of many riders including the likes of Lucien Petit-Breton - who was ranked third overall at the time. The peloton's pace was slower due to the w poor conditions, which caused the riders to arrive two hours later than expected in Naples. Pierino Albini beat out the Frenchman Maurice Brocco by 36 seconds for stage victory. Prior to the fifth stage's start, Frenchman Jean-Baptiste Dortignacq withdrew from the race after citing an illness. The police suspected foul play <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> situation, but their results are disputed through contradicting stories. Due to impassable roads, {{the start of the}} fifth stage was moved from Naples to Capua and decreased the distance of the stage from [...] to [...] Eberardo Pavesi won the fifth stage after leading for most of the race.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Levi and Rabbi Isaac {{disagreed}} {{about how}} to interpret the words of [...] "And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said: ‘It may be that Joseph will hate us.'" [...] Rabbi Levi taught that the brothers feared this {{because he did not}} invite them to dine with him. Rabbi Tanhuma observed that Joseph's motive was noble, for Joseph reasoned that formerly Jacob had placed Joseph above Judah, who was a king, and above Reuben, who was the firstborn, but after Jacob's death, it would not be right for Joseph to sit above them. The brothers, however, did not understand it that way, but worried that Joseph hated them. Rabbi Isaac said that the brothers feared because he had gone <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pit into which they had thrown him.|$|E
2500|$|Like the Junimists, Sanielevici took a {{critical}} {{view of the}} historical liberal movement, and in particular of its founding myth, the Wallachian Revolution of 1848. His belief, described by political scientist Victor Rizescu as [...] "interesting" [...] and [...] "intriguing", was that the Romanian liberals had not been responsible for modernization, but, quite the contrary, had dedicated themselves to imposing an oligarchy over the economy and obscurantism over the national ideology. He described the liberal program of modernization as [...] "the bitter fruits" [...] of 1848, and suggested that Romanian conservatism was a complex, sometimes positive, phenomenon, [...] "the harsh chiding of a parent saddened to see his child taking the wrong path". Sanielevici believed that criticism of Junimism as a German-imported ideology was [...] "not entirely exact", proposing that Romanian conservatism and its German model shared a belief in [...] "organic" [...] rather than [...] "revolutionary" [...] nation-building. In his account, which became a standard of Romanian scholarship, Junimea happened because a portion of Romania's young intellectuals were exasperated by the continuous revolutionary mood of French politics, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> steadier evolutionism proposed by German teachers. Critical of this perspective, Mironescu dismisses Sanielevici's view of the Wallachian 1848ers as [...] "proletarian rage".|$|E

2500|$|According to legend, Hanina {{was very}} poor. Indeed, it became proverbial that, while {{the whole world}} was {{provided}} for through Hanina's great merits, he himself sustained life from one Sabbath eve to another on a basket of carob beans. For some time the outside world had been kept in ignorance of his privations; his wife did all that was possible to maintain an appearance of comfort, and though she had no flour with which to make dough, she would put fuel into the oven every Friday and cause columns of smoke to rise, thus making her neighbors believe that, like them, she was baking the Sabbath meals. In time, however, one woman's suspicion was aroused, and she determined to surprise Hanina's wife and discover the truth. But, according to the legend, a miracle prevented exposure. When the woman appeared at Hanina's house <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> smoking oven it was full of loaves. In spite of the miracle, Hanina's wife induced him to collect from heaven an advance portion of his future lot. Hanina complied with her request, and, in answer to his prayer, a golden table-leg was miraculously sent him. Husband and wife were happy; but that night the wife had a vision of heaven in which she saw the saints feasting at three-legged tables while her husband's table had only two legs. She awoke full of regret at the importunity which had deprived his table of a leg, and insisted that he pray for the withdrawal of the treasure. This he did, and the golden leg disappeared. Of this supposed miracle the Talmud says: [...] "It was greater than the former, since heaven gives, but never takes" [...] (Ta'anit, 24b et seq.).|$|E
