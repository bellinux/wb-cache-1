5|$|Throughout the year, the South Pacific High {{influences}} the climate by bringing cold, moist air masses originating from Patagonia. During {{the most intense}} cold waves, they form when a transient high pressure system located in the South Pacific Ocean moves eastwards to {{the southern tip of}} South America. As it begins to move, this high pressure system strengthens the South Pacific High and is forced to move southwards to south of 40oS where the Andes are shorter in height. As well, an upper level ridge forms over the South Pacific Ocean along with an upper level trough extending from subtropical latitudes to the South Atlantic Ocean. At the same time, a low pressure system forms over the South Atlantic Ocean which eventually strengthens. The formation a cold front associated with it moves to the northeast owing to the topographic barrier that the Andes forms. The passage of the cold front to the northeast leads to the movement of the high pressure system from the South Pacific Ocean into the southern tip of South America. All of these conditions lead to strong anticyclogenesis to the east of the Andes and thus, the high pressure system intensifies as it enters southern Argentina. When both the high pressure system (over southern Argentina) and low pressure system strengthen, it creates a very strong pressure gradient that draws cold air from the south, strengthening southerly winds. Owing to the topographic barrier of the Andes, it forces and channels the cold air to accumulate on {{the eastern side of the}} Andes. This generates an ageostropic component from the south (due to a reduction in the Coriolis force caused by <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cold</b> air on the eastern side of the Andes) that draw this cold air northwards, which is driven by this pressure gradient. Cold air can move northwards until 18oS when the blocking effect of the Andes is smaller due to a change in its orientation. Overall, these conditions results in the coldest temperatures due to the cold masses from high latitudes being pulled northwards. A weaker cold wave occurs when the South Pacific High remains over the ocean and does not have a migratory high pressure system originating from the South Pacific High that moves east of the Andes (it builds over the Andes). Although this occurs throughout the year, during winters, it leads to cold temperatures while during summer, it leads to strong and deep convections. These convections are responsible for about 50% of summer precipitation south of 25oS.|$|E

The mistral reaches its maximum speed not at the narrowest part of the Rhone Valley, south of Valence, but much farther south, where the Valley has widened. Also, the wind occurs not just in the Valley, but high above in the atmosphere, up to the troposphere, 3 km above the earth. The mistral is very strong at the summit of Mont Ventoux, 1900 meters in elevation, though the plain below is very wide.

An analysis of phosphoprotein profile by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that at low temperature the relative level of phosphorylation of several proteins increased, whereas that of several others decreased. When cold acclimation was carried out in the presence of N-(6 -aminohexyl) - 5 -chloro- 1 -naphthalene-sulfonamide hydrochloride, an antagonist of calmodulin and Ca 2 +-dependent protein kinases, or the Ca 2 + channel blocker La 3 +, the cold-induced changes in protein phosphorylation were strongly inhibited, cells lost their capacity to develop freezing tolerance, and <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> transcripts <b>of</b> <b>cold</b> acclimation-specific genes was substantially reduced.

In this paper, we study the {{growth of a}} 1012 [*]M⊙ halo at z= 2, which is the progenitor of a group of galaxies at z= 0, and of its central BH by means of a high-resolution zoomed cosmological simulation, the Seth simulation. We study the evolution of the BH driven by the accretion <b>of</b> <b>cold</b> gas in the galaxy, and explore the efficiency of the feedback from supernovae (SNe). For a relatively inefficient energy input from SNe, the BH grows at the Eddington rate from early times, and reaches self-regulation once it is massive enough.

In agreement with previous findings of the strong effect of theoretical retention time on reservoir stratification, the comparison of a solitary and a cascade reservoir is based on hydrologically similar conditions. It is concluded that {{the change in the}} inflow temperatures manifests itself in the change from a lower degree of stratification and an <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cold</b> water near the bottom in the solitary reservoir to a more pronounced stratification in the cascade reservoir Comparing years with different RT, in a dry year (longer RT) the stratification is more pronounced both in a solitary and a cascade reservoir, the high flows in a wet year (shorter RT) producing much more rapid heating of the deep layers. The surface temperatures are lower in the cascade reservoir, too, being affected by mixing of the inflowing water with the surface strata. The heat budget of the reservoir is changed, more heat being taken up by the cascade reservoir {{as a consequence of the}} greater air-water temperature gradient. More intensive mixing of water masses is produced in the cascade reservoir under conditions of the same retention time, than in the solitary reservoir. The outflow temperature of the cascade reservoir is lower than the temperature of the solitary one. Another effect on the heat budget, not exactly studied in this paper, might be caused by the decreased extinction of light for the water in the cascade reservoir due to sedimentation, phosphorus uptake and organic matter decomposition in the upperlying reservoir, causing lower turbidity, less phytoplankton and less colour. The reservoir hydrodynamic model DYRESM was used to investigate the difference in temperature stratification and flows in a solitary reservoir, and the same reservoir while in a cascade. It was noted that the inflow to the reservoir changes in a cascade reservoir from an undammed river to the regulated flow from the hypoliminion of the upperlying reservoir, while the meteorological and other conditions remain unchanged.

The concentration of acetate in the interstitial water fell from about 100 microM (immediately after sedimentation of the spring diatom bloom) to a relatively constant value of about 20 microM in late summer, during which acetate utilization appeared to be balanced by production. Addition of chloroform and molybdate caused an <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cold</b> acetate in large sediment cores and of [14 C]acetate in small cores to which [14 C]bicarbonate had been added.

Over the western slopes of the ice sheet, the large‐scale PGF acts {{in the same direction}} as the katabatic PGF, resulting in a strong southerly jet of up to 12 m s− 1. In winter, the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cold</b> air over the sea ice along the northeast coast leads to a thermally induced northerly flow. This circulation facilitates southward sea ice transport in this area and is enhanced by the large‐scale circulation. Along the west coast, a similar west‐east temperature gradient also forces a northerly flow. In the summer months, sea ice is absent, and thermal wind forcing is largely reduced over the ocean. Summer insolation also reduces katabatic forcing; the large‐scale forcing dominates the ABL momentum budget over the ice sheet. Heating of the ABL over the snow‐free tundra induces thermal contrasts with the ice sheet and ocean, forcing barrier winds in the coastal regions. Throughout the year, strong surface layer winds along the southeast coast of Greenland are forced by the large‐scale PGF...|$|E
40|$|To {{make clear}} {{the effects of}} {{topographic}} features of flatland on nocturnal cooling process, micro-meteorological observations were {{carried out in the}} fields near Koga town {{in the northern part of}} Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. The observation area was in a place crossed by the large bank of the Kyushu Express-way and divided into two parts :the upward side and downward side of air flow from the mountainside. Horizontal and vertical distribution of minimum air temperature, wind speed and net radiation at several points in the field were measured during the winter of 1978 - 1979. Increases in negative net radiation aceelerated cooling of the air layer, and decreases in wind speed made air temperature lower. When the wind speed was weak, the lowest value of minimum air temperature appeared on the upward part of the bank of the Express-way facing to the mountainside, because of the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cold</b> air from the mountain. While the wind speed became rather strong, the lowest value appeared on the reverse side-downward of the bank. This phenomenon was caused by the lowering of wind speed in the leeward of the bank, where convection of sensible heat from the upper warm air layer to the ground surface was much interfered. The surface temperature of plants becomes cool when the air layer becomes cool in consequence of advection of cold air, that is, the plants is affected by cold air...|$|E
40|$|The {{observed}} North Atlantic multi-decadal variability for {{the period}} 1872 - 2009 is reconstructed with the Max Planck Institute ocean model, which is forced with an ensemble of the atmospheric twentieth century reanalysis. Special emphasis is put on {{the early part of}} the experiments, which includes a prominent climate variation during the 1920 s. The experiments are in agreement with selected hydrographic records, indicating a transition from cold and fresh North Atlantic water properties, prior to the 1920 climate variation, towards warm and saline waters afterwards. Examining the variation reveals that sea level pressure (SLP) anomalies prior to the 1900 s resemble a negative phase of North Atlantic Oscillation and associated weak winds result in a weak North Atlantic Current (NAC) and sub-polar gyre (SPG). This leads to a reduced transport of warm and saline waters into the higher latitudes. Simultaneously, Arctic freshwater release results in the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cold</b> and fresh water properties, which cover the upper layers in the Labrador Sea and subsequently suppress convection. From the 1910 s, the Arctic freshwater export is reduced, and, NAC and SPG are strengthened as a result of an increased SLP gradient over the North Atlantic. Concurrently, Labrador Sea convection and Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) increase. The intensified NAC, SPG, and AMOC redistribute sub-tropical water into the North Atlantic and Nordic Seas, thereby increasing observed and modelled temperature and salinity during the 1920 s. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E
30|$|Pre-injection with {{an excess}} <b>of</b> <b>cold</b> {{antibody}} (0.8 mg <b>of</b> <b>cold</b> mAb) significantly decreased tumour <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> the labelled conjugate. The tumour accumulation was 7.2 ± 0.53 %IA/g at 48 h post-injection in mice that received a blocking dose of 11 B 6 and {{was significantly lower}} to the 17 ± 5.2 %IA/g observed in non-blocked mice (P = 0.03) (Figure 2 a). Furthermore, the DU 145 hK 2 -negative xenografts showed significantly lower (P = 0.01) tumour accumulation for 111 In-DTPA- 11 B 6, 4.8 ± 0.86 %IA/g compared to 17 ± 5.2 %IA/g at 48 h (Figure 2 a).|$|R
40|$|The {{nucleotide}} sequence of a full-length cDNA, the deduced amino acid sequence, and {{the regulation of}} expression <b>of</b> a <b>cold</b> acclimation-specific gene, cas 18, in cell suspension cultures of a freezing-tolerant cultivar of alfalfa (Medicago falcata cv Anik) have been determined. The deduced polypeptide, CAS 18, is relatively small (17. 6 kD), is highly hydrophilic, is rich in glycine and threonine, and contains two distinctive repeat elements. It exhibits homology {{with members of the}} LEA/RAB/dehydrin family of proteins, which accumulate in response to abscisic acid (ABA) or water stress. It is intriguing that cas 18 is induced by neither ABA nor water stress. The cas 18 cDNA hybridizes to three transcripts of 1. 6, 1. 4, and 1. 0 kb, and the cDNA characterized here corresponds to the 1. 0 -kb transcript. The expression of this gene is about 30 -fold greater in cold-acclimated cells than in nonacclimated cells. Although the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> transcripts during <b>cold</b> acclimation is relatively slow, their disappearance during deacclimation is dramatically rapid, becoming undetectable in less than 5 h. Studies of nuclear run-on transcription show that cold acclimation enhances the transcription of this gene nearly 9 -fold. The stability of cas 18 -detectable transcripts during deacclimation is considerably increased if transcription is inhibited with cordycepin. It therefore appears that low temperature regulates the expression of cas 18 at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels...|$|R
