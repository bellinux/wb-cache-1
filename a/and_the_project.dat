5|$|From 1999, {{the project}} leader was elected yearly. The Advanced Packaging Tool was {{deployed}} with Debian 2.1. The amount of applicants was overwhelming <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> established the new member process. The first Debian derivatives, namely Libranet, Corel Linux and Stormix's Storm Linux, were started in 1999.

5|$|In the 1990s, a harbourside {{concert hall}} {{designed}} by architects Behnisch & Partners was planned, but an Arts Council decision cut the funding <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> {{has not been}} revived.

5|$|Liddy's revised Gemstone plan {{included}} {{a range of}} illegal activities, including a proposal to break into Democratic Party offices in the Watergate complex. The Watergate burglaries were initially assumed to {{have been part of}} Operation Sandwedge, and the investigation into both the burglaries <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> led to Caulfield's resignation from his Nixon-appointed position as assistant director of criminal enforcement in the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.|$|E
5|$|Markowitz's {{script for}} Horrible Bosses was sold at auction to New Line Cinema by Ratner's {{production}} company Rat Entertainment in 2005 for a six-figure amount.

Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley rewrote the script in 2010, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> went into production with Seth Gordon directing.|$|E

5|$|T2E1 Mine Exploder – This mine {{exploding}} equipment, {{which was}} meant to be used with the boom on the M32, was essentially the T2 mine exploder, but scaled up for use by the U.S. Marines. It was impractical, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> was abandoned in October 1943.|$|E

5|$|The East Topeka {{interchange}} {{was completely}} rebuilt {{in the late}} 1990s, with a goal of rerouting I-70 and improving access to the turnpike. The design was completed in 1997, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> was finished in 2001 {{at a cost of}} $98.6 million in 1999 dollars.|$|E
5|$|The M15 design {{developed}} from the United States Army Coast Artillery Corps' T1A2 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage (MGMC) project, which added a 37mm gun to an M2 Halftrack Car. It was designated the T28 and tested at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds. The tests were deemed unsuccessful due to heavy recoil, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> was canceled in 1942.|$|E
5|$|The ZBGM-75 Advanced Intercontinental Ballistic Missile, {{also known}} as Weapons System 120A (WS-120A), was a program to develop an {{intercontinental}} ballistic missile (ICBM), proposed by the United States Air Force in the 1960s {{as a replacement for}} the LGM-30 Minuteman as the Air Force's standard ICBM. Funding was not allocated for the program <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> was cancelled in 1967.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} {{originally}} conceived in 1998 when Jeffrey Lau and Corey Yuen first {{thought of the}} idea of making a film based on Ip Man's life. Donnie Yen signed onto the project, hoping to star as Ip, with Stephen Chow co-starring as Bruce Lee. Yen had signed the contract and received part of the acting fee. However, the studio producing the film closed, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|The goal of {{increasing}} commercial and business activity on Jaffa Road never materialized. Several {{attempts were made}} to bring a pedestrian presence to the street, such as the construction of the Windows residential tower next door, but to date nothing has been successful <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> has been deemed a commercial failure.|$|E
5|$|A gallery feature {{was also}} planned and would allow players to unlock bonus {{material}} {{depending on their}} progression in the game. Fan artwork and music would be unlockable through this feature, as well as minigames, including a card game similar to Triple Triad from Final Fantasy VIII. The remake {{was expected to be}} released on the Internet for free and played on console emulators, since there would be no cartridge version due to financial constraints. Only a semi-working 3D test was actually completed, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> was discontinued in mid-2000 due to a number of factors, including the accidental loss of Lazur's data and his desire to improve his programming skills.|$|E

5|$|After {{a fire in}} 1177, the {{original}} palace complex was abandoned and emperors resided in smaller palaces (the former sato-dairi) within the city and villas outside it. In 1227 a fire finally destroyed {{what remained of the}} Dairi, and the old Greater Palace went into complete disuse. In 1334 Emperor Go-Daigo issued an edict to rebuild the Greater Palace, but no resources were available to support this <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> came to nothing. The present Kyoto Imperial Palace is located immediately {{to the west of the}} site of the , the great Fujiwara residence in the north-eastern corner of the city. The Jingi-kan, the final standing section of the palace, remained in use until 1585.|$|E
5|$|Another {{design was}} {{requested}} of Brine, {{but this time}} for a smaller and less expensive building. In 1818, the Keys purchased the building {{in which they had}} formerly met, moving the library to the Grammar School. The new plans were agreed upon by all concerned, but there continued to be disagreements between the British Treasury department and the Keys over how to fund the project. The Treasury believed that the cost should be covered by Manx taxes, but the Keys argued that this tax would be excessive. The two parties eventually each agreed to pay some of the £1039-10-0d cost, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> was approved on 31 May 1819, just under 30 years after the first discussions. The building was completed in less than two years, and the Keys started using the building in January 1821.|$|E
5|$|As {{the highway}} would {{pass through the}} Hamersley National Park, the Environmental Protection Authority decided in 1983 that an Environment Review and Management Program report was {{required}} for the Newman to White Springs section. Consultants prepared the report for Main Roads, which found that the key risks were erosion, visual impact, and possible damage to flora. A detailed survey was carried out, which included the use of laser and infra-red measuring devices from within a helicopter, and numerous field trips to determine the final alignment and bridge sites. A comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement was then produced, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>project</b> was approved in mid-1984.|$|E
