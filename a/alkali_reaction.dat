40|$|The value {{assignment}} of candidate Standard Reference Material (SRM ®) 57 b Silicon Metal {{provided an opportunity}} to develop an <b>alkali</b> <b>reaction</b> procedure as a precursor to borate fusion for the preparation of test specimens from the metal powder for X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF). Suggested for this purpose by Blanchette (Adv. X-Ray Anal., 45, 415, 2002), the <b>alkali</b> <b>reaction</b> uses LiOH·H 2 O to convert Si to Li 2 SiO 3. Lithium silicate is fused with lithium borate flux without damage to platinum ware. Once specimens are fused and cast as beads, calibration standards are prepared to closely match the compositions of the specimens allowing a linear calibration for each analyte. The XRF method yields results that are directly traceable to the mole through NIST SRM spectrometric solutions. The method was validated in two ways. First, the reaction was used on older SRMs for Si metal: SRM 57 and SRM 57 a. Second, XRF results for candidate SRM 57 b were compared to results obtained using prompt gamma-ray activation analysis (PGAA) and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICPOES). Bias tests show the XRF results are accurate for the elements Al, S, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, and Zr. Levels of S, Ca, Cr, and Cu in candidate SRM 57 b are near the limits of quantification of the borate fusion method. Iron results {{may be subject to}} a low bias.

The high rates of housing construction, functioning and development of urban infrastructure cause infringement to the soil cover. The paper contains main results of an ecological and geochemical research of the soil cover in Voronezh, its characteristics, properties of the horizons of the different types of soils. During spring and summer of 2014 75 samples of soil were collected in special points of monitoring (according to GOST 17. 4. 3. 01 - 83 and GOST 17. 4. 4. 02 - 84). During the research the following methods were applied – volt-ampermetric method was used for detecting the concentration of heavy metals, the method of cholophorm-hexan extraction – for petrochemicals, the method of I. V. Tyurin – for humus concentration, potentiometric method and biotesting methods (analysis of seedlings of the following indicating plants – Lepidium sativum, Avena sativa, as well as defining the phytotoxic effect) – for actual acidity detection. The obtained results are used for creating an overview soil map of Voronezh. Urbanozems are dominating in the soil cover of Voronezh. There era large areas of them in the majority of the city districts. A smaller part of a total urban area is presented by soils, which are slightly touched by human economic activity. Urban soils of industrial and transport city zones have disadvantageous properties – low rate of humus and <b>alkali</b> <b>reaction</b> of soil environment, high rate of pollution by petrochemicals and heavy metals. The least rate of pollution of a soil cover by heavy metals is detected in residential areas, situated far from industrial objects and highways. We have detected dependence between accumulation of polluting substances in soil cover and functional and planning peculiarities of the city. For example, accumulation of zinc takes place in soils with <b>alkali</b> <b>reaction</b> of soil and low concentration of humus.

Understanding how various forms of moisture will affect the reaction will help to understand the reaction more and how to sustain structures already affected by ASR.

40|$|It is a {{well known}} fact that <b>alkali</b> {{aggregate}} <b>reactions</b> {{are one of the}} predominant causes of concrete deterioration. Swelling phenomenon in the form of expansion of the cement matrix by formation of ettringite due to sulfate-rich water and some external factors such as cycles of freezing and thawing or the attack on concrete by water in some forms such as extremely pure water, acidic water play a deleterious role for concrete durability. In <b>alkali</b> silica <b>reaction,</b> aggregates containing certain forms of silica will react with alkali hydroxide in concrete to form a gel that swells as it adsorbs water from the surrounding cement paste or the environment. These gels can swell and induce enough expansive pressure to damage concrete. Such damage has been reported in many countries, particularly in those with hot-wet climates. Quality of construction materials especially coarse and fine aggregates contribute towards durable structures. Several methods have been formulated to characterize the aggregates viz. mortar bar method, chemical method, petrographic examinations and accelerated mortar prism test methods.
