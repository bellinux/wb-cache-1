5000|$|In {{response}} to Stagebill's upstart incursion, Playbill began to produce Showbill, a sister publication that conformed to Disney's <b>advertising</b> <b>requirements</b> for all publications distributed in its properties. Now with an alternative, Disney switched from Stagebill to Showbill for The Lion King late in its {{run at the}} New Amsterdam. (When the musical moved to the Minskoff Theatre, which Disney does not own, it was obligated to use Playbill, as are Disney productions at other theaters.) The Ford Center for the Performing Arts also commissioned Showbill for its inaugural production of Ragtime, presumably to exclude other automakers' ads. In a different circumstance, the producers of the Broadway revival of Cabaret wished to maintain the atmosphere of a sleazy nightclub at its Studio 54 venue, and insisted on handing out Playbills after the performance. Playbill, sensing missed exposure for its advertisers, offered the show's producers [...] "Showbill" [...] instead.|$|E
50|$|However, by {{the late}} 1990s, Playbill was {{extremely}} profitable; Stagebill was not, losing millions of dollars annually by 1998. To increase revenue, Stagebill entered Playbills turf.

A bigger rift came in 1997, when Disney contracted Stagebill for its big musical production The Lion King at the newly reopened New Amsterdam Theatre. The main point of contention {{in the latter case}} was control over advertising content: Playbill is distributed free to theaters, relying on advertising revenue that is completely under its authority, whereas per company policy; Disney required a program without cigarette or liquor ads. In response to Stagebill's upstart incursion, Playbill began to produce Showbill, a sister publication that conformed to Disney's <b>advertising</b> <b>requirements</b> for all publications distributed in its properties.

40|$|About This {{report is}} a {{collaboration}} between the Centre for Intellectual Property Policy & Management (www. cippm. org. uk), Bournemouth University (BU), the Department for Human Resources & Organisational Behaviour, The Business School, BU, and CREATe, the RCUK Centre for Copyright & New Business Models (www. create. ac. uk). The Hargreaves Review stated: “The problem of orphan works – works to which access is effectively barred because the copyright holder cannot be traced – represents the starkest failure of the copyright framework to adapt. ” (Digital Opportunity: A Review of Intellectual Property and Growth; London: Intellectual Property Office; 2011; p. 38). This report was commissioned by the Intellectual Property Office to support {{the implementation of the}} Hargreaves Review. It aims to offer a clearer understanding of how orphan works are regulated and priced in other jurisdictions, and how a pricing system could be structured to ensure that “parents” are fairly remunerated if they re-appear, and users are incentivised to access and exploit registered orphan works. Executive Summary ‘Orphan works’ are works in which copyright still subsists, but where the rightholder, whether it be the creator of the work or successor in title, cannot be located. This report was commissioned to assist the UK government in evaluating policy options in the implementation of the Hargreaves Review of Intellectual Property & Growth (2011) to enable and price the use of orphan works. The research proceeded in two stages. Study I undertook a comparative international review of actual or proposed orphan works legislation, and identified key characteristics of orphan works licensing schemes. Study II investigated the potential effects of such schemes by conducting a simulated rights clearance exercise for six scenarios (establishing licence terms and fees for specific commercial and non-commercial uses), and analysing the resulting dataset for effects of the characteristics identified in Study I. I. Comparative Review The comparative review relied on a close scrutiny of actual or proposed legislation and considered government reports, draft bills, publications and other commentaries on the orphan works issue. The countries reviewed included jurisdictions with operational orphan works regulations: Canada, Denmark, Hungary, India, and Japan; as well as provisions at the EU level and in the US (draft legislation and current practice). The purpose of the review was to identify key features of legal regimes with respect to factors such as – (i) categories of works covered; (ii) standards of diligent search; (iii) the mechanism for obtaining permission; (iv) the existence of a register or database of recording suspected orphan works; (v) the role of collecting societies;(vi) tariffs set by category of work; (vii) mechanisms for challenging tariffs; (viii) remedies for reappearing authors and case law, if any, on damages for infringing use. Findings Study I: (1) Two distinct approaches appear to be used for governing orphan works in the jurisdictions reviewed. The first may be labelled ‘ex-ante’, and involves rights clearing before a work is used, the second is ‘ex-post’ and typically involves the management of infringement risks by the user. In the former an applicant is required to engage with an authorising body or collecting society in order to receive a licence to make use of an orphan work. In contrast, the latter involves either the creation of a statutory copyright exception, or a limitation of liability where an applicant makes use of an orphan work after having exerted some effort to identify the potential rightholder (e. g. diligent search, attribution). These regimes provide different levels of protection for authors and users. The ex-ante approach is exemplified by Canada, Japan and India where a potential user has to discuss terms with a copyright board. In ex-post systems payment is only due in case an author reappears. This approach is exemplified by the US. The analysis shows a strong protection for rightholders, both ex ante and ex post, in India, and Japan; and a relatively lower protection in the US, and to a certain extent Denmark (under the system of Extended Collective Licensing). Canada and Hungary are intermediate cases (e. g. no <b>advertising</b> <b>requirements</b> prior to use, but public listing of granted licences). (2) While most jurisdictions require a diligent search to be conducted by the applicant there is no uniform standard constituting a diligent search. Across jurisdictions the specifications for diligent search vary considerably. Requirements involving the preventive search of the author range from the weak provisions of Denmark (no search required), Canada (requiring “reasonable effort”), and the US (“reasonable search” required) to the strong provisions of India, Japan, Hungary and the EU (but not France) providing a duty for the user of performing a “diligent search” or “due diligence search” (India) accompanied by some form of record tracking of the steps performed. The EU lists minimum sources for a diligent search in the Annex to the Orphan Works Directive. <b>Advertising</b> <b>requirements</b> (in the national press or equivalent) are provided in Japan and India. (3) The United States had proposed a “limited liability” approach, under which the use of orphan works is possible after a reasonable search. In the case of an infringement claim orphan users are liable only for a reasonable compensation. Denmark uses an Extended Collective Licensing system, which involves collective negotiation with users (normally for multiple licensing) valid also for non-represented authors. In turn, the EU leaves Member States free to choose their regulatory approach (for example, France has chosen a central licensing system in its forthcoming legislation). All the other countries reviewed implement the central licensing system, with a central public authority granting copyright licences on orphan works. (4) Prices are set by central authorities in the countries that have a central licensing system, and by collecting societies in Denmark. Interestingly, national central authorities have claimed that although no official negotiation process is provided by law, the price of licences is set on a case by case basis, after considering the individual circumstances of the applicant. Set prices can be challenged mostly in an ordinary court of law in the examined countries, or alternatively before the licensing authority with a quasi-judicial procedure (e. g. Canada). Infringement claims are handled by ordinary courts in all countries (including the US) or by licensing authorities with quasi-judicial procedures (in Hungary). In Denmark, both prices and infringement claims are under the jurisdiction of a special tribunal (the Copyright Licensing Tribunal). The above rules on price, infringement, and legal remedies do not derive from EU law, which leaves these matters to Member States. (5) In Canada, Japan, India, Denmark and France an upfront payment is normally required byte applicant in exchange for using orphan works. In Canada, payment is upfront in approximately two-thirds of cases, whilst it is contingent on the rightholder reappearing in the remaining third. See De Beer and Bouchard (2010). In Hungary the amount is identified but may not be deposited (for non-profit licensees). It will be paid directly to the rightholder, in the event that he or she reappears. In the US, no payment is made until a court decision is issued, following an infringement claim. Particular roles are envisaged for collecting societies in Denmark, in which they handle the whole system, Hungary, where collecting societies retain unclaimed revenues after five years from expiry of licence, and Canada, where collecting societies are consulted during tariff setting, and hold collected fees (to be used as they see fit). (6) In the US, in Hungary, and France a voluntary public online register for suspected orphan works is established. The EU is establishing a register at the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (OHIM). In Japan, some institutions have their own register of orphan works. No register is envisaged in India, Canada or Denmark (prior to the Orphan Works Directive). However details of all licences granted are available on-line in Canada. II. Rights Clearance Simulation The “Rights Clearance Exercise” reported in Study II is a combination of various methods. In a first step a simulation approach is employed to collect a unique dataset on actual or potential licence fees for orphan works. Representatives of rights clearance authorities from countries covered in the comparative legal review (Canada, Denmark, France, Hungary, India, Japan, supplemented by some US data) were asked to provide a licence fee for each of six scenarios that are likely to occur in reality (from creating a small online resource to mass digitisation projects). The identification of the various scenarios was the outcome of a rigorous methodological procedure. The six identified scenarios were: 	Historical geographic maps for a video game for mobile phones (up to 50 maps 	A vintage postcard collection for web publication and eventual sale of prints (up to 50 cards) 	National folk tune recordings for multimedia/teaching (DVD) (up to 50) 	Re-issuing a 1960 / 70 s TV series as part of a digital on-demand service (one series) 	Mass digitisation of photographs (archives) by a public non-profit institution, with possible sale of prints (above 100, 000 items) 	Mass digitisation of books by a private for-profit institution, with possible sale of books (above 100, 000 items) Two rates for each scenario were sought, for commercial and non-commercial use. In a second step the dataset is subjected to various analytical techniques, including a regression approach and a comparison of collective licensing systems against others through the computation of effect sizes. Findings Study II: (1) There {{does not appear to be}} a standard price for licensing orphan works. In fact tariffs vary widely. For example, to clear 50 items from a folk tune archive for commercial use will cost the equivalent of £ 188 per year in Canada, and (under reasonable assumptions) £ 9, 312 per year in France. In fact, the only consistent finding appears to be that in almost all cases commercial licence fees tend to exceed non-commercial ones. (2) Licences were not available for all scenarios. Re-issuing orphaned broadcasts seems particularly problematic, with no licence offered in any of the countries investigated. (3) There is no systematic recognition of what may constitute an appropriate duration for licences. Licences were very variable from country to country, ranging from a monthly to a five-year licence, without the provision of a permanent licence. (4) We find high tariffs that discourage mass digitisation projects. Per item fees initially appearing very low and thus sustainable turn out to render mass-digitisation unviable for public and non-profit institutions when scaled up under reasonable assumptions. Mass digitisation projects involving 100, 000 items may incur annual licensing fees exceeding £ 1 million per year. (5) The average level of fees imposed on a potential user of an orphan work is similar in collective and individual licensing regimes. This is an interesting finding because it mitigates arguments that one of the regimes will lead to higher fees. The operating costs involved in running an orphan works scheme appear therefore an important factor when choosing between individual and collective approaches. (6) A limited liability system seems to have advantages for archives and other non-profit institutions exposed to orphan works, enabling those organisations to share their stock of orphaned artefacts with the public. In contrast, the up-front rights clearing seems to provide more appropriate incentives for commercial uses of orphaned artefacts, guaranteeing that a reappearing rightholder will be compensated for the exploitation of any work. Together, the findings from both studies indicate the need for a more structured and consistent approach in governing orphan works that is reflected in the pricing and duration of licences, and in the costs of running any licensing system...|$|E
40|$|Although various {{pieces of}} European {{secondary}} law law use the terms "mise en concurrence" ("calling for competition" or "competitive tendering procedure") they provide no {{definition of the}} expression "obligation de mise en concurrence" ("obligation to call for competition"). At the very beginning, the author therefore defines what is meant thereby in his thesis, i. e. "a more or less formalized action which a public or a private person has to follow in order to provoke a competition or a contest between potentially interested persons that perform an economic activity, in order to grant an individual advantage to one or several of them". The {{first part of the}} work deals with the regime of competitive tendering of the public procurement directives which the Court of Justice has considered "as a whole" to be the "core" of European law on public contracts. First, this part examins the development of the public procurement directives from 1971 on. The author shows that the puzzling evolution of the personal scope of the public procurement directives is guided by the personal scope of European primary law. While considering the remedies directives, the author examines to what extent they introduce requirements beyond the principle of effective judicial protection. While some of their requirements obviously do so, the remedies directives however remain very far from standardizing the means of redress at national level. Due to the member States' judicial autonomy, the compelling force of EU primary law differs from one member State to another. The same applies within the scope of the remedies directives as they let the member States a large degree of autonomy. The author then turns to examine the contribution of the procurement directives 2004 / 17 /CE, 2004 / 18 /CE and 2009 / 81 /CE, their scope of application, as well as the concepts of public works concession and service concession. Various other questions are dealt with in the first part, {{such as the use of}} functional interpretation, the power of the European legislator to adopt regulations on public procurement and the impact of the Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA), the Revised GPA and other international agreements. At last the author explores the issue of electronic procurement and the Commission's proposals for replacing the public procurement directives 2004 / 17 /CE and 2004 / 18 /CE and its proposal concerning the award of concession contracts. The second part of of the thesis focuses on primary public procurement law. After having described the origin of the obligation to call for competition under EU primary law which the Court of Justice derives from articles 49 and 56 TFEU as well as from the principles of equal treatment and non-discrimination on the grounds of nationality, the author strives to determine whether this obligation is well-founded. This examination brings to light that the rationale behind the requirement to call for competition under EU primary law is rather fragile. Amongst others, the author comes to the conclusion that the condition of a certain cross-border interest of each public contract individually as a condition for the application of the primary law obligation to call for competition lacks relevance The author then reviews and examines other possible bases for an obligation to call for competition under EU primary law such as the right to good administration, the freedom of enterprise and the right to property, which are protected by the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and the rights guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights. Finally, it seems that only article 102 TFEU (abuse of a dominant position) could to a limited extent give rise to an obligation to call for competition. However, once a situation is governed by EU secondary law, it enters the scope of European law. Hence, the principles of equal treatment and of non-discrimination on the grounds of nationality apply even if a situation involves no cross-border interest. If the Court of justice's case law were followed consistently, these principes should lead to require calls for competition in a number of purely internal situations. According to the author, deducing as precise consequences as does the Court of justice from the principal of equal treatment and other fundemental principles can hardly be justified. After that examination, the material rules of public procurement primary law stated by the Court of Justice and the General Court are successively reviewed. The pages that follow are about the exceptions to the obligation to call for competition under the public procurement directives and under primary law, as for instance articles 51 and 52 TFEU, overriding reasons of general interest and article 106, paragraph 2, TFEU. The author thereafter addresses the question whether primary law applies within the scope of secondary law. He comes to the conclusion that it does even when secondary law represents an exhaustive body of rules. Notwithstanding some ambiguous judgements of the Court of justice there is no support for the doctrine of priority of application of secondary law in the Court's case law. In what follows, the author tries to answer the question whether, in order to stay consistent with the case law developed in the wake of Telaustria, the obligation to call for competition which the case law of the Court of Justice requires for public works, service and supply contracts ought to be extended to other operations (sale or lease of real estate, design contests outside the scope of the public procurement directives, employment contracts, subsidised contracts awarded by private entities outside the scope of the public procurement directives, grants, …). The end of the second part deals with the personal scope of the primary law of public procurement which corresponds to that of EU primary law. The rules concerning State aid are addressed in detail in the third part of the thesis. The examination in that part shows that the public procurement directives, the primary law of public procurement and the EU state aid rules apply cumulatively. The EU State aid rules require efficency when awarding public contracts. Nevertheless, in order to avoid the categorization as State aid, a call for competition is never formally required. The Commission however insists on calls for competition in order to declare certain aids compatible with the internal market. Aids include by definition an advantage for their recipients. This remains true even though an aid has been authorised by the Commission pursuant to article 107, paragraphe 3, TFEU. Given the very broad scope the Court of Justice gives to the freedom of establishment and the free movement of services, aid measures give generally rise to obstacles to the freedom of establishment and the free movement of services. At the risk of rendering article 107, paragraph 3, TFEU unnecessary, the fact that an aid measure impedes the fundamental freedoms of the internal market should therefore not prevent the Commission to declare it compatible with the internal market. This applies in particular to aids consisting in the award of a public contract that is covered only by EU primary law. That solution seems however excluded for public contracts within the scope of the public procurement directives. The Commission has adopted a broad concept of what is an "advantage" in the sense of the State aid rules. This leads the Commission to consider certain grants for environmental protection as State aid measures even though it may be difficult to dectect any kind of advantage. The Commission claims to control these measures in accordance with the rules of State aid control. On that occasion the Commission tends to make its consent subject to a call for competition in order to identify the projects that will be subsidized. A broad approach of the concept of undertaking leads to class as State aid various public infrastructure investments insofar they do not satisfy the private investor test. The Commission tends to make its consent to these investments subject to calls for competition. Such is notably the case regarding public investments in broadband network facilities. In the fourth part, the author examines a variety of secondary legislation imposing calls for competition other than the public procurement directives. These texts cover a wide range of areas and provide for competitive awards of various form and diverse content. Sometimes a requirement for competitive tendering is overtly expressed. At other times, it is implicit, indirect or just inchoate. Some advantages are awarded without a genuine competition or without any competition at all. Directive 2012 / 34 /CE establishing a single European railway area for instance sets principles for the allocation of "infrastructure capacity" (i. e the right to use a railway network). It does not employ such terms as "calling for competition". Where the infrastructure capacity is insufficient it has to be allocated in a fair and non discriminatory manner. The fee for using the railway network cannot be used as an award criterion. In some areas, competition in terms of price is the very basis of the system. This is true for the greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme. It happens that competitive assignment occurs incidentally and in a non compulsory way as in the case of the milk quota regime. In other cases, e. g. certain situations covered by the internal electricity market regime, the system excludes calls for competition whereas they should be required according to primary procurement law principles. Under still other circumstances, i. e. the award of public service contracts for public passenger transport services, competitive tendering only needs to be strictly complied with after a transitional period. This can hardly be reconciled with the principles of primary procurement law. In some cases the rules in place are such, for example when awarding the universal postal service, that it seems doubtful that a competitive bidding following objective and transparent criteria is really possible. The European greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme relies on auctions for the allocation of gaz emission authorisations. At first, it does so to a limited extent. Such authorisations, called "allowances", are freely transferable. Thus a reallocation of allowances according to market mechanismes is made possible. The author sheds light on some major inconsistencies of the greenhouse gas emission trading scheme. The late deadline for surrendering allowances gives rise for several years to a surplus of allowances over the greenhouse gas emissions considered in the scheme. On the other hand, the costs for same amounts of greenhouse gas emitted at the same time may vary. This gives rise to a problem of equality. The author comes to the conclusion that the scheme has little capacity to reach the objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions at least cost to the economy. The designation of the universal postal service providers implies to lay down rules as to how the net cost of the universal service is to be calculated, as well as to define appropriate award criteria. These steps face considerable difficulties. A similar situation can be found in other areas such as electronic communications and electricity or natural gas transmission or distribution systems. In the latter case, the risk of a change of transmission or distribution tariffs due to decisions of national regulatory authorities leaves the competitors in the dark on a crucial point. The legislation regarding the internal electricity market and the internal gaz market puts the transmission and distribution system operators in a position very similar to that of service or public works concession holders. In some cases the principles which underlie these schemes exclude competitive tendering as required by primary procurement law. The networks being freely transferable, ownership of networks and hence, in principle, their operators are determined by private market mechanismes mainly through the level of the proposed sales price. This is not consistent with the principles of primary procurement law stated by the Court of Justice (<b>advertising</b> <b>requirements,</b> award criteria linked to the subject matter of the contract, [...] .). Neither does it seem compatible with these principles that the development of the networks belongs automatically to the transmission and distribution system operators. The assessment of conformity of secondary legislation with primary law is less strict than the conformity assessment of national law. The Court of Justice has allowed the European legislator a wide margin of discretion when establishing the internal market and seems to have tacitely acknowledged a form of conformity presumption of secondary law. Save in exceptional cases, it seems unlikely that the Court will put into question secondary law regimes differing from primary law procurement rules. Thus, the European legislator may adopt such solutions without incurring major legal risks...|$|E
50|$|One {{indicator}} of credential inflation is the relative {{decline in the}} wage differential between those with college degrees and those with only high school diplomas. An additional indicator is {{the gap between the}} credentials requested by employers in job postings and the qualifications of those already in those occupations. A 2014 study in the United States found, for example, that 65% of job postings for executive secretaries and executive assistants now call for a bachelor's degree, but only 19% of those currently employed in these roles have a degree. Jobs that were open to high school graduates decades ago now routinely require higher education as well—without an appreciable change in required skills. In some cases, such as IT help desk roles, a study found there was little difference in <b>advertised</b> skill <b>requirements</b> between jobs requiring a college and those that do not.|$|R
40|$|We analyze a {{standard}} employee selection model given two institutional constraints: First, professional experience perfectly substitutes insufficient formal education for insiders while this substitution is imperfect for outsiders. Second, {{in the latter}} case the respective substitution rate increases with the <b>advertised</b> minimum educational <b>requirement.</b> Optimal selection implies that the expected level of formal education is higher for outsider than for insider recruits. Moreover, this difference in educational attainments increases with lower optimal minimum educational job requirements. Investigating data of a large US public employer confirms both of the above theoretical implications. Generally, the econometric model exhibits a �good fit�. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{consider}} trends in occupational therapy workplace demands in Queensland between December 2009 and November 2011, as demonstrated by <b>advertised</b> job <b>requirements.</b> These trends are considered in the context of both undergraduate curriculum design and continuing professional development. Method: A mixed-methods approach was used. The content of occupational therapy job advertisements from four job databases over a 2 -year period were examined using quantitative and qualitative analysis to identify trends, concepts, and themes. Results: Six lessons regarding occupational therapy education were drawn from the data. These included lessons relating to balancing graduate demand and supply, intake and exit timing, high-demand areas of practice, non-traditional occupational therapy roles, the roles of continuing professional development providers, and discrepancies between existing new graduate competencies and required workplace competencies. Conclusion: Occupational therapy educators have an obligation to produce graduates who meet the profession’s graduate competencies, as well as those competencies required by workplaces, if those graduates are to be considered work-ready and fit for practice. Similarly, education at a continuing professional development level should reflect market trends and offer graduates and practitioners the opportunity to maintain employment currency...|$|R
40|$|The Qualitex {{decision}} in 1995 inspired trademark reformation and harmonization worldwide {{for the protection}} of color marks. While protecting color trademarks has not created issues of market entry in domestic markets, the {{growth in the number of}} transnational market participants and an increased utilization of non-traditional branding may catalyze color depletion in international trade. After exploring how current <b>advertising</b> expenditure <b>requirements</b> and distinctiveness requirements affect the registrability and protection of a color mark, this Note offers potential global reforms to help minimize hurdles for small scale transnational participants and the threat of international color depletion. Specifically, due to consumers 2 ̆ 7 increasing exposure to international brands through e-commerce, courts should give more deference to survey results on Internet platforms to establish distinctiveness in the brand 2 ̆ 7 s relevant customer base. The proposals in this Note will benefit trademark owners and potential transnational market participants by ensuring that consumer confusion is based on actual market practices, which will in turn prevent color depletion by keeping widely used colors in the public domain. Ultimately, by remaining conscious of the facts and issues presented in this Note, attorneys, legislators, and trademark owners can ensure fair market competition and mitigate color depletion from taking place in transnational trade...|$|R
50|$|Quebec banned {{smoking in}} public spaces and workplaces, such as offices, hospitals, {{restaurants}} and bars on 31 May 2006. Smoking is banned within a 9m {{radius of the}} entrances of social services institutions such as hospitals, community centres, CEGEP, colleges and universities. Smoking is banned on the properties of elementary and high schools. The province eliminated designated smoking rooms in 2008. The law was amended by Bill 44 in November 2015. The sale of electronic cigarettes is regulated like tobacco, including restrictions on <b>advertising.</b> ID <b>requirements</b> for tobacco sales are stricter and fines are increased. It is prohibited to sell flavoured tobacco products, including menthol. All public organizations, such as hospitals and post-secondary education institutions, must adopt a smoke-free and smoking cessation policy and report to the government. Since May 26, 2016, smoking and e-cigarettes are banned on restaurant and bar patios and terraces, playgrounds and sports fields, including a 9 m radius. Smoking in a vehicle with children under 16 is also prohibited. As of November 2016, smoking will be prohibited within a 9 m radius of all doors, windows and air intakes of all building open to the public. Standardized warning label sizes will apply to all tobacco packages.|$|R

Four years later, in 1954, the British Doctors Study, a study of some 40,000 doctors over 20 years, confirmed the suggestion, based on which the government issued advice that smoking and lung cancer rates were related. The British Doctors Study lasted until 2001, with results published every ten years and final results published in 2004 by Doll and Richard Peto. Much early research was also done by Alton Ochsner. Reader's Digest magazine for many years published frequent anti-smoking articles.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{traditional}} advertising deal is {{paid for}} in advance and the price is typically based on space and reach. Value-based advertising, as the word implies, means that the advertiser, instead of paying in advance, is paying for the actual value the ad generates. This study illuminates what differentiates value-based advertising deals from traditional advertising. Our findings shows that the most significant differences are the changed relationship between the media company and the advertiser, the media company‟s ability to attract new advertisers, advertisers‟ willingness to pay more and that value-based advertising is considered complex in many aspects. Moreover this study explains what is required to develop value-based <b>advertising</b> further. Those <b>requirements</b> are that media companies have to increase advertisers‟ knowledge, obtain reference cases and approach senior management instead of marketing managers. If these areas are developed in an accurate way, value-based advertising deals will {{in the near future}} become a vital part of advertising. MSc in Marketing and Consumptio...|$|R
40|$|When Swedish {{employers}} advertise for IS/IT {{project managers}} {{they tend to}} list almost obvious qualification requirements instead of describing those that are unique for their companies’ competitiveness, or more precisely, instead of expressing those that really matters. The research behind this paper studied job advertisements during four years (2010 – 2013). The findings point to an inadequate ability to understand and/or express the requirements that should be decisive for the appointment in order to grasp {{the essence of what}} the job actually involves, which brings on problems for both the applicants and the employers. The practical implications of the study pursue a need for employers to stop <b>advertising</b> mostly general <b>requirements</b> for the benefit of more specified ones, that take the sector’s, the organization’s and the project’s requirements into consideration. By doing so, the prospect applicants have a better opportunity to understand what a certain job entails and the employers have a better chance to appoint the right individual. The research implications point to a need for acknowledging, and set about solving, problems concerning qualification requirements in advertisements for IS/IT project managers...|$|R
40|$|Top-k {{retrieval}} over main-memory inverted indexes is at {{the core}} of many modern applications: from large scale web search and advertising platforms, to text extenders and content management systems. In these systems, queries are evaluated using two major families of algorithms: documentat-a-time (DAAT) and term-at-a-time (TAAT). DAAT and TAAT algorithms have been studied extensively in the research literature, but mostly in disk-based settings. In this paper, we present an analysis and comparison of several DAAT and TAAT algorithms used in Yahoo!’s production platform for online <b>advertising.</b> The low-latency <b>requirements</b> of online <b>advertising</b> systems mandate memory-resident indexes. We compare the performance of several query evaluation algorithms using two real-world ad selection datasets and query workloads. We show how some adaptations of the original algorithms for main memory setting have yielded significant performance improvement, reducing running time and cost of serving by 60 % in some cases. In these results both the original and the adapted algorithms have been evaluated over memory-resident indexes, so the improvements are algorithmic and not due to the fact that the experiments used main memory indexes. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{theories}} {{based on}} session types {{stand out as}} effective methodologies to specify and verify properties of distributed systems. A key result in the area shows the suitability of choreography languages and session types {{as a basis for}} a choreography-driven methodology for distributed software development. The methodology it advocates is as follows: a team of programmers designs a global view of the interactions to be implemented (i. e., a choreography), then the choreography is projected onto each role. Finally, each program implementing one or more roles in the choreography is validated against its corresponding projection(s). This is an ideal methodology but it may not always be possible to design one set of choreographies that will drive the overall development of a distributed system. Indeed, software needs maintenance, specifications may evolve (sometimes also during the development), and issues may arise during the implementation phase. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} an alternative approach whereby it is possible to infer a choreography from local behavioural specifications (i. e., session types). We tackle the problem of synthesising choreographies from local behavioural specifications by introducing a type system which assigns – if possible – a choreography to set of session types. We demonstrate the importance of obtaining a choreography from local specifications through two applications. Firstly, we give three algorithms and a methodology to help software designers refine a choreography into a global assertion, i. e., a choreography decorated with logical formulae specifying senders’ obligations and receivers’ requirements. Secondly, we introduce a formal model for distributed systems where each participant <b>advertises</b> its <b>requirements</b> and obligations as behavioural contracts (in the form of session types), and where multiparty sessions are started when a set of contracts allows to synthesise a choreography...|$|R
