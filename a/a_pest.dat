5|$|This species eats a {{wide range}} of foods that include nectar, insects, seeds, fruit, and native and {{introduced}} bulbs. It will eat orchard-grown fruit and is sometimes seen as <b>a</b> <b>pest</b> by farmers.|$|E
5|$|To be most {{effective}} at controlling <b>a</b> <b>pest,</b> a biological control agent requires a colonizing ability which allows it {{to keep pace with}} changes to the habitat in space and time. Control is greatest if the agent has temporal persistence, so that it can maintain its population even in the temporary absence of the target species, and if it is an opportunistic forager, enabling it to rapidly exploit <b>a</b> <b>pest</b> population.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the species}} is endemic, {{the species is}} {{considered}} not threatened, but in Western Australia, the twenty-eight subspecies (B. z. semitorquatus) gets locally displaced by the introduced rainbow lorikeets that aggressively compete for nesting places. The rainbow lorikeet is considered <b>a</b> <b>pest</b> species in Western Australia and is subject to eradication in the wild.|$|E
50|$|Anthonomus signatus or the Strawberry bud weevil is a weevil that is <b>a</b> {{significant}} <b>pest</b> {{of strawberries}} in North America. It is also {{thought to be}} <b>a</b> major <b>pest</b> to raspberries. It is native to North America.|$|R
50|$|It {{is known}} as <b>a</b> chronic <b>pest</b> in Northern Great Plains of the United States and also <b>an</b> {{important}} <b>pest</b> of wheat in the Canadian Prairies. The species is distributed widely in various regions of the USA and Canada.|$|R
5|$|Importation or {{classical}} {{biological control}} involves {{the introduction of}} <b>a</b> <b>pest's</b> natural enemies to a new locale where they do not occur naturally. Early instances were often unofficial and not based on research, and some introduced species became serious pests themselves.|$|R
5|$|Established clearfelling {{practices}} {{have been shown}} to favour the Pindi moth, and could lead to it being considered <b>a</b> <b>pest</b> due to opportunistic proliferation of the species. The resulting damage caused to the trees on which it feeds may be considered significant.|$|E
5|$|Gould {{noted that}} early Tasmanian {{settlers}} regarded the abundant green rosella highly as food, and often shot and ate it. He {{agreed that it}} was very tasty after trying it himself. Many farmers saw the species as <b>a</b> <b>pest</b> of orchards, and green rosellas were shot.|$|E
5|$|Some {{grasshopper}} species, {{like the}} Chinese rice grasshopper, are <b>a</b> <b>pest</b> in rice paddies. Ploughing exposes the eggs {{on the surface}} of the field, to be destroyed by sunshine or eaten by natural enemies. Some eggs may be buried too deeply in the soil for hatching to take place.|$|E
50|$|The {{caterpillar}} larvae are leaf rollers, leaf tiers {{and leaf}} miners. <b>As</b> <b>pests,</b> they infest such diverse plants as Persea americana (avocado), Swietenia (mahoganies), or Zea mays (corn). However, {{they are usually}} a mere nuisance and do not cause large-scale crop failure.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} <b>an</b> {{agricultural}} <b>pest.</b>|$|R
50|$|Chlorops pumilionis is <b>a</b> {{species of}} <b>pest</b> fly {{from the family}} Chloropidae. It {{is also known as}} the chloropid gout fly or barley gout fly. It is <b>an</b> oligophagous <b>pest</b> of cereal crops.|$|R
5|$|The {{tree sparrow}} {{is seen as}} <b>a</b> <b>pest</b> in some areas. In Australia, it damages many cereal and fruit crops and spoils cereal crops, animal feed and stored grain with its droppings. Quarantine rules {{prohibit}} the transport of this species into Western Australia.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} basic {{strategies}} for biological pest control: classical (importation), where a natural enemy of <b>a</b> <b>pest</b> is {{introduced in the}} hope of achieving control; inductive (augmentation), in which a large population of natural enemies are administered for quick pest control; and inoculative (conservation), in which measures are taken to maintain natural enemies through regular reestablishment.|$|E
5|$|Although {{this bird}} eats rice on the {{wintering}} grounds, {{where it can}} make up nearly 40% of its diet, it takes mainly waste and residues from cropping and threshing, not harvestable grain. It has sometimes been viewed as <b>a</b> <b>pest,</b> but the deeper water and presence of invertebrate prey in the economically important early winter period means that the wader has little effect on crop yield.|$|E
50|$|Larva {{robust and}} instar change from green to brown towards pupa. ==Ecology== It is {{considered}} <b>a</b> mild <b>pest</b> on Lablab purpureus and considered as <b>a</b> serious <b>pest</b> on field bean, causing {{moderate to severe}} loss. Larva known to feed on field bean and also pigeon pea primarily.|$|R
50|$|The larvae are <b>a</b> minor <b>pest</b> of Orchidaceae.|$|R
50|$|Synanthedon scitula, the dogwood borer or pecan borer, is <b>a</b> major <b>pest</b> of {{many plants}} {{including}} the dogwood and pecan. It is <b>an</b> extremely notorious <b>pest</b> {{due to its}} severity and its widespread geographical distribution.|$|R
5|$|As a result, many {{countries}} in the Pacific region emulated the lead of Puerto Rico and introduced the toad in the 1930s. There are introduced populations in Australia, Florida, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, the Ogasawara, Ishigaki Island and the Dait≈ç Islands of Japan, most Caribbean islands, Fiji and many other Pacific islands, including Hawaii. Since then, the cane toad has become <b>a</b> <b>pest</b> in many host countries, and poses {{a serious threat to}} native animals.|$|E
5|$|Brachychiton rupestris {{has been}} {{recorded}} as a host plant for the mistletoe species Dendrophthoe glabrescens. Insects hosted by the species include the pale cotton stainer bug, <b>a</b> <b>pest</b> of cotton crops, and the kurrajong leaf roller caterpillar that chews on the foliage and rolls individual leaves, within which it then pupates. Bottle tree scrub is a key habitat of the near threatened black-breasted buttonquail. Brachychiton rupestris can withstand bushfires and responds by flowering and putting forth new foliage afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Bruchus rufimanus, {{commonly}} known as the broad bean weevil, broad bean beetle, or broad bean seed beetle is a weevil which inhabits crops and fields, as well as some homes. It is <b>a</b> <b>pest</b> of faba beans (Vicia faba L.).The adult weevils feed on pollen, while their larvae tunnel in seeds destroying crops and moving on to new ones once they dry out. The adult beetle, being one of the biggest of its genus, ranges from 3 to 5mm in length.|$|E
50|$|It is {{considered}} <b>a</b> minor <b>pest</b> on Sesamum indicum.|$|R
50|$|It is {{considered}} <b>a</b> significant <b>pest</b> of horticultural ash.|$|R
50|$|The larvae are <b>a</b> major <b>pest</b> {{to sugar}} cane.|$|R
5|$|Pest {{control is}} the {{regulation}} or management {{of a species}} defined as <b>a</b> <b>pest,</b> {{a member of the}} animal kingdom that impacts adversely on human activities. The human response depends on the importance of the damage done, and will range from tolerance, through deterrence and management, to attempts to completely eradicate the pest. Pest control measures may be performed as part of an integrated pest management strategy.|$|E
5|$|Populations of pest insects can {{sometimes}} be dramatically reduced by the release of sterile individuals. This involves the mass rearing of <b>a</b> <b>pest,</b> sterilising it by means of X-rays or some other means, and releasing it into a wild population. It is particularly useful where a female only mates once and where the insect does not disperse widely. This technique has been successfully used against the New World screw-worm fly, some species of tsetse fly, tropical fruit flies, the pink bollworm and the codling moth, among others.|$|E
5|$|Some isopod {{groups have}} evolved a {{parasitic}} lifestyle, particularly as external parasites of fish. They can damage or kill their hosts {{and can cause}} significant economic loss to commercial fisheries. In reef aquariums, parasitic isopods can become <b>a</b> <b>pest,</b> endangering the fish and possibly injuring the aquarium keeper. Some {{members of the family}} Cirolanidae suck the blood of fish, and others, in the family Aegidae, consume the blood, fins, tail and flesh and can kill the fish in the process.|$|E
40|$|The {{sunflower}} seed maggot, Neotephritis finalis (Loew), is <b>an</b> emerging <b>pest</b> of cultivated sunflower throughout the Great Plains sunflower production region. It is <b>a</b> seed-feeding <b>pest</b> and infests the sunflower plant from late bud stage through the flowering (Arthur and Campbell 1979). There are two complete generations of this insec...|$|R
50|$|Dasineura {{brassica}}e, the brassica pod midge, is <b>a</b> rapeseed <b>pest.</b>|$|R
50|$|The larvae are {{polyphagous}} and {{are considered}} <b>a</b> forestry <b>pest.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{cane toad}} has poison glands, and the tadpoles are highly toxic to most animals if ingested. Because of its {{voracious}} appetite, the cane toad {{has been introduced}} to many regions of the Pacific and the Caribbean islands {{as a method of}} agricultural pest control. The species derives its common name from its use against the cane beetle (Dermolepida albohirtum). The cane toad is now considered <b>a</b> <b>pest</b> and an invasive species in many of its introduced regions; of particular concern is its toxic skin, which kills many animals, both wild and domesticated. Cane toads are particularly dangerous to dogs.|$|E
5|$|The common {{blackbird}} {{was introduced}} to Australia by a bird dealer visiting Melbourne in early 1857, and its range has expanded from its initial foothold in Melbourne and Adelaide to include all of south-eastern Australia, including Tasmania and the Bass Strait islands. The introduced population in Australia is considered <b>a</b> <b>pest</b> because it damages a variety of soft fruits in orchards, parks and gardens including berries, cherries, stone fruit and grapes. It is thought to spread weeds, such as blackberry, and may compete with native birds for food and nesting sites.|$|E
5|$|The fulvous {{whistling}} duck feeds in wetlands by day {{or night}} on seeds {{and other parts of}} plants. It is sometimes regarded as <b>a</b> <b>pest</b> of rice cultivation, and is also shot for food in parts of its range. Despite hunting, poisoning by pesticides and natural predation by mammals, birds and reptiles, the large numbers and huge range of this duck mean that it is classified as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
