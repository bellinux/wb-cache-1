25|$|Back in {{the present}} moment, it is the eighth day after the narrator's plane crash and the narrator is dying of thirst; miraculously, {{following}} a long walk, he and the prince find a well. The narrator later finds the prince talking to the snake, discussing his return home and his eagerness to see his rose again, who he worries has been left to fend for herself. The prince bids an emotional farewell to the narrator and states that if {{it looks as though}} he has died, it is only because his body was too heavy to take with him to his planet. The prince warns the narrator not to watch him leave, as it will upset him. The narrator, realizing what will happen, refuses to leave the prince's side. The prince consoles the narrator by saying that he only need look at the stars to think of the prince's lovable laughter, and that it will seem <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> stars are laughing. The prince then walks away from the narrator and allows the snake to bite him, soundlessly falling down.|$|E

"The general discontent I {{felt with}} woman's portion as wife, housekeeper, physician, and spiritual guide, the chaotic {{conditions}} into which everything fell without her constant supervision, and the wearied, anxious {{look of the}} majority of women, impressed me with a strong feeling that some active measures should be taken to remedy the wrongs of society in general, and of women in particular. My experience at the World Anti-slavery Convention, all I had read of the legal status of women, and the oppression I saw everywhere, together swept across my soul, intensified now by many personal experiences. It seemed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> elements had conspired to impel me to some onward step. I could not see what to do or where to begin—my only thought was a public meeting for protest and discussion." ...|$|E
500|$|Several critics {{praised the}} {{development}} of Santana. Hankinson wrote, [...] "My goodness, Santana. It's <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> writers sat around a room, identified the best lines of tonight's episode and then decided to give them all to Santana. Fantastic." [...] VanDerWerff called Santana {{the highlight of the}} episode: [...] "The best thing about this episode is Naya Rivera's work as Santana and the story the three writers have cooked up for her. Rivera's really come into her own this season, going from just a generic bitchy cheerleader to an actual character who has motivations and might be a better villain for the show than Sue." [...] He added, [...] "the storyline of Santana realizing {{she was in love with}} Brittany and, thus, is probably a lesbian has been nicely plotted and surprisingly deep. The reveal about Santana hasn't washed away her less savory qualities; indeed, it's heightened them, to a degree, as she struggles to be true to herself and still maintain her status as the hottest girl in school." [...] Jenna Mullins of E! Online wrote of Santana, [...] "This episode just cemented my love for her. The insult spew in the beginning of the episode was awesomely mean." [...] She also said that Santana's [...] "inner monologue is often more entertaining than other characters' outer monologues". CNN Lisa Respers France considered Santana the episode's highlight, and went on to write, [...] "She embraced her inner lesbian (sort of) and rattled off the best [...] like 'the only straight I am is straight-up [...]' You gotta love that." ...|$|E

2500|$|In this way, it can {{be shown}} that an object with a spherically-symmetric {{distribution}} of mass exerts the same gravitational attraction on external bodies <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> object's mass were concentrated at a point at its centre.

2500|$|An {{approximate}} value for gravity {{at a distance}} [...] from {{the centre of the}} Earth can be obtained by assuming that the Earth's density is spherically symmetric.

2500|$|Among those {{impressed}} by Ashcroft's performance as Desdemona was John Gielgud, recently {{established as a}} West End star. He recalled, [...] "When Peggy came on in the Senate scene it was <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> lights in the theatre had suddenly gone up". In 1932 he was invited by the Oxford University Dramatic Society to try his hand at directing, in the society's production of Romeo and Juliet. Ashcroft as Juliet and Edith Evans as the nurse won golden notices, although their director, already notorious for his innocent slips of the tongue, referred to them as [...] "Two leading ladies, the like of whom I hope I shall never meet again." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Catholic writer Léon Bloy {{praised the}} novel, {{describing}} Huysmans as [...] "formerly a Naturalist, but now an Idealist capable {{of the most}} exalted mysticism, and as {{far removed from the}} crapulous [...] Zola <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> interplanetary spaces had suddenly accumulated between them." [...] In his review, Barbey d'Aurevilly compared Huysmans to Baudelaire, recalling: [...] "After Les Fleurs du mal I told Baudelaire it only remains for you to choose between the muzzle of the pistol and the foot of the Cross. But will the author of À rebours make the same choice?" [...] His prediction eventually proved true when Huysmans converted to Catholicism in the 1890s.|$|E

Of course, this was done with benign intentions, as if to say 'we have come in answer to your calls for assistance'. The problem was... the condescending tone... For Jewish liberals, the great memory of that summer has been the deaths of Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner and—almost as an afterthought—James Chaney. Indeed, Chaney's name tends to be listed last, as if the life he lost was worth only three fifths of the others." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cortés {{first saw}} Tenochtitlan on 8November1519. Upon viewing {{it for the}} first time, Cortes and his men were [...] "stunned by its beauty and size...." [...] The Spaniards marched along the {{causeway}} leading into the city from Iztapalapa. The towers, temples and canoes filled with crowds who gathered to look at the strange men and their horses. Moctezuma came out from the center of Tenochtitlan onto the causeway to greet them. The two processions met {{at the entrance to the}} city. Moctezuma was in a litter draped with fine cotton mantles and borne on the shoulders of a number of lords. He emerged from the litter and the two leaders exchanged gifts. The Aztecs led the Spaniards into the heart of the city where Moctezuma gave them with more gifts and then quartered them in lavish apartments. However, Aztec accounts of the first meeting indicate that Moctezuma was too deferent and generous to the newcomers. An Aztec account relates how the people of Tenochtitlan felt: [...] "as if everyone had eaten stupefying mushrooms..., as if they had seen something astonishing. Terror dominated everyone, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> world were being disembowelled.... People fell into a fearful slumber...." ...|$|E
