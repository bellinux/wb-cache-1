5|$|In 1533, Henry {{broke with}} Pope Paul III {{in order to}} annul his long-standing {{marriage}} to Catherine of Aragon and remarry. Catherine was the aunt of Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> annulment as a personal insult. This resulted in France and the Empire declaring an alliance against Henry in 1538, and the Pope encouraging the two countries to attack England. An invasion of England now appeared certain and Henry began to improve his coastal defences.|$|E

5|$|On 12 June 1917, the {{day after}} his accession, Alexander {{revealed}} his liaison with Aspasia Manos to his father and asked for his permission to marry her. Constantine was reluctant to let his son marry a non-royal, and demanded that Alexander wait {{until the end of the}} war before considering the engagement, to which Alexander agreed. In the intervening months, Alexander increasingly resented his separation from his family. His regular letters to his parents were intercepted by the government and confiscated. Alexander's only source of comfort was Aspasia, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> decision to marry her despite his father's request.|$|E
5|$|In India, Harvey scored 114 out of Australia's 468 in the First Test at Delhi, {{setting up}} an innings victory for Australia. On a pitch conducive to spin at Kanpur for the second Test, Harvey was given a rare {{opportunity}} to bowl <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> wicket of the Indian captain, Gulabrai Ramchand. In addition, he scored 51 and 25, the second highest Australian score in each innings in a low-scoring match, but India won to square the series, with off spinner Jasu Patel taking 14/124. Harvey hit 102 in a drawn third Test in Bombay and took his third (and final) Test wicket, A. G. Milkha Singh, in the fourth Test at Madras. He ended the series with 356 runs at 50.86, a significant contribution to Australia's 2–1 triumph.|$|E
5|$|The {{directors}} had {{twelve days}} to film two episodes each, equating to approximately {{five minutes of}} screen-time per day. Langan asked Father Ted director Declan Lowney to helm the first two episodes after his successful direction of the pilot. Lowney declined in order to shoot a film in Ireland with Terence Stamp; production on it was scheduled to begin in October 1997 and would have overrun into Cold Feets production calendar. Funding for Lowney's film fell through <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> two episodes of Cold Feet after Langan offered them to him a second time. The other two directors were Mark Mylod and Nigel Cole.|$|E

5|$|With {{the death}} of Edgar, however, the royal {{succession}} became problematic. Æthelred took power in 978 following {{the murder of his}} brother Edward, but England was then invaded by Sweyn Forkbeard, the son of a Danish king. Attempts to bribe Sweyn not to attack using danegeld payments failed, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> throne in 1013. Swein's son, Cnut, liquidated many of the older English families following his seizure of power in 1016. Æthelred's son, Edward the Confessor, had survived in exile in Normandy and returned to claim the throne in 1042. Edward was childless, and the succession again became a concern. England became dominated by the Godwin family, who had taken advantage of the Danish killings to acquire huge wealth. When Edward died in 1066, Harold Godwinson claimed the throne, defeating his rival Norwegian claimant, Harald Hardrada, at the battle of Stamford Bridge.|$|E

25|$|Forsaith and Reader Wood contested {{a vacancy}} in the City of Auckland electorate. The {{nomination}} meeting on 26 April 1858 sparked little interest. A {{show of hands}} was in favour of Forsaith, and Wood called for a poll. The election was held {{the next day and}} Forsaith was elected. Parliament at the time was in session, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> oath on 28 April, being welcomed back by the speaker.|$|E

25|$|Mansell repassed Schumacher {{near the}} end of the second lap and set off after Senna. On lap 5, Mansell and Senna went side by side down the main {{straight}} but Mansell was ahead as he had the inside line. As the track dried, everyone stopped and Berger's stop was slow. Senna's stop was quick <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> lead ahead of Berger, Mansell, Prost, Schumacher and Patrese. Senna then let Berger through on lap 12 in order to hold up Mansell while Schumacher overtook Prost at the same time. Then, Senna spun into the last corner and dropped behind Mansell, Schumacher and Prost.|$|E
25|$|The Russian Revolution of 1917 was {{a source}} of great {{inspiration}} to the entire Childs family, and news of its dramatic events were breathlessly followed over the next several years. Towards {{the end of the decade}} Childs joined a trade union in order to get a job driving a milk delivery wagon, where he first made the acquaintance of members of the then-underground American Communist movement. The combination of his family's radical heritage, the exciting news from Russia, and the enthusiasm of his radical peers caused Morris Childs to become politically engaged, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> step of joining the United Communist Party of America in 1921.|$|E
25|$|His best {{performance}} in a match came during the 1994/95 Red Stripe Cup when he was Man of the Match after taking match figures of 13 for 123 against Jamaica. Eight of those wickets came in the first innings, {{at the expense of}} 92 runs <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> other five when Jamaica followed on. At the time of his last first-class appearance, only Andy Roberts has taken better match and innings bowling analysis for the Leeward Islands than Phillip. It was a good season for Phillip, with his tally of 28 wickets at 15.50 only bettered in 1996/97 when he took 35 wickets, but at a more expensive average of 29.25.|$|E

25|$|He {{completed}} {{college in}} 1986 and began focusing in international competitions. He represented Ireland at the 1986 European Athletics Championships, {{but did not}} progress beyond the 5000 metres heats. His career peak came during the 1987 indoor season. A lifetime best run of 7:47.95 minutes was the best by any 3000m athlete {{in the world that}} year. This set him up as a strong contender for the 3000m title at the 1987 IAAF World Indoor Championships. A tactically run final saw a close finish <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> silver medal narrowly behind fellow Irishman Frank O'Mara, and just three hundredths ahead of bronze medallist Terry Brahm. However, a knee injury interrupted his career at this point and he did not reach such peaks again.|$|E
25|$|Oliver {{was one of}} {{the relay}} runners in the heats of the 2001 World Championships in Athletics, where he helped Bahamas to the final in which they took the gold medal in a {{national}} record of 2:58.19 minutes. He performed a similar role at the 2002 Commonwealth Games and Bahamas won the bronze in his absence in the final. The team were disqualified in the heats of the 2003 IAAF World Indoor Championships, but they topped the podium at the 2003 Central American and Caribbean Championships in Athletics, as Moncur, Oliver, Nathaniel McKinney and Brown took the gold medals. At the major event, he was again relegated to a heat runner <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> Bahamas to the top of their heat and the nation won bronze in the final of the 2003 World Championships in Athletics. These were the last international performances of his career.|$|E
25|$|Although {{another plane}} was {{prepared}} for the passengers, Gleason {{had had enough of}} flying. He went into downtown Tulsa, walked into a hardware store, and asked its owner to lend him $200 for the train trip to New York. The owner asked Gleason why he thought anyone would lend a stranger so much money. Gleason identified himself and explained his situation. The store owner said he would lend the money if the local theater had a photo of Gleason in his latest film. But the publicity shots showed only the principal stars. Gleason proposed to buy two tickets to the movie and take the store owner; {{he would be able to}} see the actor in action. The two men watched the movie for an hour before Gleason appeared on screen. The owner gave Gleason the loan, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> next train to New York. There he borrowed $200 to repay his benefactor.|$|E
