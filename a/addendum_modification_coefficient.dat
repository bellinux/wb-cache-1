The range of addendum modification co-efficient is taken from negative value to positive value through zero by considering both the upper limit(peaking limit) and the lower limit (undercutting limit). The root stress factor is found out for various loading positions. The variation of root stress factor with addendum modification co-efficient is shown when only the driving gear is modified.

40|$|Industrial gears {{are often}} very expensive; they {{are large and}} {{manufactured}} in batches of small quantities, or even individually. Nevertheless, several industrial gears are prematurely discarded because of superficial damages, even if modern technologies and machine tools can completely repair these kinds of failures. For a long time, in fact, the repair of a gear {{was limited to the}} modification of the <b>addendum</b> <b>modification</b> <b>coefficient</b> (a. k. a. profile shift coefficient), while the modification of the pressure angle was usually impracticable, due to the axis limitations of the conventional gear machinery, where the pressure angle and the normal module are set by the tooling. Thus for each repair requiring that pressure angle variation, a gear tooling with the modified pressure angle should be used. In the past decade, the scenario has changed, thanks to the introduction of the - multi-axis CNC Machine Centers, - gear modules for CAD/CAM software, - evolution of CNC Gear Grinding machines, - development of new cutting tools able to machine parts with surface hardness higher than 60 HRC. The above has enabled the application of new types of modification for the refurbishment of superficially damaged gears. This paper presents a new approach to repair industrial gears by showing a case study where pressure angle modification is also considered, differently from the past repairing procedures that dealt only with the modification of the profile shift coefficient. A computer program has been developed to automatically determine the repair alternatives under two goals: minimize the stock removal or maximize gear tooth strength. It will also be shown that the refurbishment of industrial gears using these approaches can result in a 30 - 40 % savings, compared to the cost of a new part, without reducing gear strength. This paper will also show that the whole repair procedure can be carried out in no more than two weeks, depending on the gear size...|$|E

This paper deals with the comparative study of tooth profile with aspect of spur gear tooth bending strength in altered tooth-sum gearing.

The described procedure implies research of tooth profile parameters influence on spur gear tooth bending strength for a tooth-sum of 100 when it is altered by + 4 teeth for a pressure angle of 20 ° and module 2 mm and operating between a specified center distance by introducing a negative profile shift. In order to compare the bending stress of meshed gear teeth for gear pairs with different tooth profile the comparative diagrams are made. Many conclusions about the influence of tooth profile parameters of spur gear tooth bending strength for altered tooth-sum gearing can be obtained from those diagrams. With the help of these comparative diagrams it is possible to select the optimal values of <b>addendum</b> <b>modification</b> <b>coefficients</b> and radius of root curvature for a particular gear pair (104 teeth) with aspect of tooth bending strength...|$|R

Planetary {{gear drive}} with minor teeth {{difference}} (zd≤ 8) {{is one of}} the advanced transmitting styles and could meet the requirement of larger ratio in a smaller size of dimension. Generally the gears with <b>addenda</b> <b>modifications</b> play a principal role in planetary gear drive of minor teeth difference to avoid teeth interference during the mesh, and this transmission implies cumbersome parameters calculations and brings up higher angle of engagement to affect the load capacity because of life weakening on carrier bearings involved.

Based on these works, a general formula of helical tooth tip deformation is deduced. Then, this formula is applied to calculate the adden-dum modification width ac.

40|$|The Terzaghi {{superposition}} assumption {{has been}} widely {{used to determine the}} bearing capacity of shallow footings. Although this assumption always errs on the safe side, a rigorous procedure to calculate the bearing capacity is still of engineering value. This paper presents such a procedure that is free from errors {{as a result of the}} superposition assumption. It demonstrates that the ultimate bearing capacity can be precisely expressed by the Terzaghi equation, except that the bearing capacity factor N y is dependent upon the surcharge ratio. A recently developed numerical method, i. e., the critical slip field method, is used to calculate the <b>modification</b> <b>coefficient</b> for modifying N y It is found that this <b>modification</b> <b>coefficient</b> increases with the surcharge ratio at small values of surcharge ratio and then remains constant for large values of surcharge ratio. However, the errors invoked by the superposition assumption do not exceed 10 %.

It firstly establishes the entity assembly model of internal gear pairs with precise tooth profile, then determines the number of multi-tooth meshing teeth pairs with finite element software and finally analyzes the main factors and reason affecting the number of meshing teeth pairs. In the range of tooth number of internal gear equal to 40 - 200, the conclusion is that when tooth number difference equal to 1 the number of effective meshing teeth pairs is 3 - 15,when tooth number difference equal to 5 the number of effective meshing teeth pairs is 3 - 11. The main factors affecting the number of meshing teeth pairs are tooth number and tooth number difference. The fewer tooth number is and the greater tooth number difference is, the fewer the number of meshing teeth pairs is. The reason is that when tooth number is obviously reduced or tooth number difference is obviously increased, the clearance of adjacent gear surface will be greatly increased, which will cause the decrease {{of the number of}} meshing teeth pairs. Within the normal value scope of <b>modification</b> <b>coefficient</b> difference of involute internal gear pairs with small tooth number difference, the influence of <b>modification</b> <b>coefficient</b> difference and <b>modification</b> <b>coefficient</b> is very small.
