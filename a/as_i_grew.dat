This year has been unbelievable. I've been cheered in ballparks all over the country. People not only showed me their kindness, but more importantly, they {{demonstrated}} their {{love of the game}} of baseball. I give my thanks to baseball fans everywhere. Tonight, I {{want to make sure you}} know how I feel. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> up here, I not only had dreams of being a big league ballplayer, but also of being a Baltimore Oriole. For all of your support over the years, I want to thank you, the fans of Baltimore, from the bottom of my heart. This is the greatest place to play." ...|$|E
2500|$|Edith Grossman, {{who wrote}} and {{published}} a highly acclaimed English {{translation of the}} novel in 2003, says that the book is mostly meant to move people into emotion using a systematic change of course, {{on the verge of}} both tragedy and comedy at the same time. Grossman has stated:The question is that Quixote has multiple interpretations [...] and how do I deal with that in my translation. I'm going to answer your question by avoiding it [...] so when I first started reading the Quixote I thought it was the most tragic book in the world, and I would read it and weep [...] <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> older [...] my skin grew thicker [...] and so when I was working on the translation I was actually sitting at my computer and laughing out loud. This is done [...] as Cervantes did it [...] by never letting the reader rest. You are never certain that you truly got it. Because as soon as you think you understand something, Cervantes introduces something that contradicts your premise.|$|E

6000|$|... "To own the truth, Sir John, natur' is natur', and I'm {{getting to}} be a little near-sighted <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>grow</b> old; besides, I'm not so sartain that the danger is the more dangerous, for taking a good, steady look plump in its face." ...|$|R

60|$|More {{and more}} <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>grow</b> {{older and more}} settled in my views am I bored by common argument, bored not because I am ceasing to be {{interested}} in the things argued about, but because I see more and more clearly the futility of the methods pursued.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{got to move}} slower, Mr. Heathcote, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>grow</b> older. That's about it. And {{the beast}} I'm on is not much good." [...] Now Mr. Bates was always {{complaining}} of his horse, and yet was allowed to choose any on the run for his own use.|$|R
6000|$|All {{sorts of}} {{reflections}} {{of this nature}} passed through my mind--for <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>grow</b> older <b>I</b> regret {{to say that a}} detestable habit of thinking seems to be getting a hold of me--while I stood and stared at those grim yet fantastic lines of warriors, sleeping, as their saying goes, [...] "upon their spears." ...|$|R
60|$|I could readily fancy {{that the}} elder {{was trying to}} {{encourage}} the lad for that terrible time of trial, and the tears overflowed my eyes <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> faint with horror while thinking of what the evening would bring forth.|$|E
60|$|However, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> better {{acquainted with}} the {{business}} and learned {{the run of the}} sources of information I ceased to require the aid of fancy to any large extent, and became able to fill my columns without diverging noticeably from the domain of fact.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sahib, it {{is always}} so; it goes down from father to son. As soon as I was able to walk, I began to work with my father, and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> up he {{initiated}} me in the secrets of our craft, which we may never divulge." ...|$|E

"And at times, Father Claude, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>grow</b> older, <b>I</b> doubt {{much that}} the nameless old man of Torn is my father, so little do I favor him, and never {{in all my life}} have I heard a word of fatherly endearment or felt a caress, even as a little child. What think you, Father Claude?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have had}} {{my share of}} fun in the world," [...] he said; [...] "but it <b>grows</b> less <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>grow</b> older. It is always so with a man as he gets into his work.

6000|$|... [Footnote 8: I have expunged a {{sentence}} insisting farther on this point, having come to reverence more, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> older, every simple means of stimulating all religious belief and affection.

6000|$|... "I suppose it's troublesome. Still ... you see, {{nothing ever}} happens to me. When I {{was a little}} boy I never had accidents. I never fell in love <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> up.

6000|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> calmer, {{we talked}} of the past, {{of the early}} days in Iowa, of the dimmer, yet still more {{beautiful}} valleys of Wisconsin, till mother sighed, and said, [...] "I'd {{like to see the}} folks and the old coulee once more, but I never shall." ...|$|E
6000|$|Belle sat {{silent for}} a minute or more, and then rising said that she must go.

60|$|In {{youth and}} {{maturity}} Poems {{are charged with}} sunshine and varied pomp of day; but as the soul more and more takes precedence, (the sensuous still included,) the Dusk becomes the poet's atmosphere.

40|$|I {{have many}} {{memories}} of dresses, looks and disguises that spiral and spin around my thoughts.

And <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>grow,</b> <b>I</b> wander further to the outside, allowing more and more dimensions, more thoughts, more worlds to collide. That is the dress I am in awe of [...] . It is not here; it exists in all thoughts, and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> spin, I feel it everywhere. You cannot see me, I cannot see it but I am beginning {{to know that it}} is there...|$|R

"I cannot tell you, Orley, how thankful I am," [...] said Zeppa, [...] "that this trader {{happened}} to touch at the island. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> stronger my anxiety {{to return home}} {{became more and more}} intense; and to say truth, I had begun to fear that Captain Fitzgerald had forgotten us altogether." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So," [...] {{said his}} Excellency, raising his eyebrows, [...] "I see clearly {{you are of}} the rascals. But a lad must have his fancies, and when your age I was hot for the exiled Prince. I {{acquired}} more sense <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> older.

6000|$|His eyes {{travelled}} aimlessly {{about the}} room. [...] "They {{taught me a}} lot of things when I was a boy," [...] he said, [...] "my mother and others--they meant well--which <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> older I discovered to be lies; and so I came to think that nothing good was true, and that everything and everybody was evil.

6000|$|... "On {{the whole}} I {{came up to}} {{adolescence}} pretty straight and clean," [...] said Sir Richmond. [...] "What stands out in my memory now is this idea, of a sort of woman goddess who was very lovely and kind and powerful and wonderful.

60|$|Shakespeare and Goethe were {{my first}} favourites in literature; but <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> older the fascination of lyric poetry {{obtained}} a hold upon me, and Shelley and Keats, for a time, reigned supreme in my fancy.

5000|$|... "A Chinese {{painting}} is {{often accompanied by}} words. They are complementary. There are things that words do that pictures never can, and likewise, there are images that words can never describe. I feel the story {{has to be an}} exciting and moving experience for a child. Before I am involved with a project, I must be moved, and, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>grow,</b> <b>I</b> try to create something exciting. It is my purpose to stimulate growth in the reader as an active participant. To get the story across for me, mostly it's the feeling. I think that if the book evokes a reaction of some sort, either positive or negative, I think it would have done what it is supposed to do." ...|$|R
