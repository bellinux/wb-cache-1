500|$|Wilson's {{disease may}} be {{suspected}} {{on the basis}} of any of the symptoms mentioned above, or when a close relative has been found to have Wilson's. Most have slightly abnormal liver function tests such as a raised <b>aspartate</b> <b>transaminase,</b> alanine transaminase and bilirubin level. If the liver damage is significant, albumin may be decreased due to an inability of damaged liver cells to produce this protein; likewise, the prothrombin time (a test of coagulation) may be prolonged as the liver is unable to produce proteins known as clotting factors. Alkaline phosphatase levels are relatively low in those with Wilson's-related acute liver failure.

In separate groups, CP (150 [*]mg/kg, i. p.) was injected as a single dose 5 days {{before the end of}} experiment, with or without either PPAR agonist. CP induced hepatotoxicity, as it caused histopathological alterations, with increased serum alanine and <b>aspartate</b> <b>transaminases,</b> total bilirubin, albumin, alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase. CP caused hepatic oxidative stress, indicated by decrease in tissue reduced glutathione, with increase in malondialdehyde and nitric oxide levels. CP also caused decrease in hepatic antioxidant enzyme levels, including catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione S-transferase. Furthermore, CP increased serum and hepatic levels of the inflammatory marker tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α, evaluated using ELISA. Preadministration of PIO, but not FEN, prior to CP challenge improved hepatic function and histology, and significantly reversed oxidative and inflammatory parameters. In conclusion, activation of PPAR-γ, but not PPAR-α, conferred protection against CP-induced hepatotoxicity, via activation of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms, and may serve as supplement during CP chemotherapy...|$|R

30|$|Organotin {{compounds}} are {{a versatile}} group of organometallic chemicals {{that are used}} in a variety of industrial and agricultural applications. Tributyltin (TBT), a common organotin, brings about severe spermatotoxic and organotoxic effects. However, information about the adverse effects of TBT on liver, kidney and testis is scanty. Hence, the present study was undertaken to elucidate the TBT-mediated oxidative stress-induced impairments in these organs. Administration of TBT through oral route at increasing doses of 50, 100 and 150  ppm for 65  days to male Syrian hamsters resulted in drastically decreased activities of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase and decreased mean levels of non-enzymatic antioxidants (reduced glutathione, vitamin C, and vitamin E) followed by a dramatic increase in the levels of lipid peroxidation in the liver, kidney and testis as compared to the control animals. Significantly high levels of serum urea, creatinine, uric acid and bilirubin were observed in TBT-treated hamsters. Also, TBT treatment induced drastic histopathological changes in the liver, kidney and testis combined with remarkable changes in serum levels of tissue injury marker enzymes <b>Aspartate</b> <b>transaminases,</b> Alkaline phosphatase and Alanine transaminase. These data affirm that exposure to TBT can lead to oxidative stress-induced damage to liver, kidney and testis.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{clinical}} {{manifestations of}} Lonomia obliqua caterpillar envenomation are systemic hemorrhage and acute kidney injury. In {{an effort to}} better understand the physiopathological mechanisms of envenomation, a rat model was established to study systemic tissue damage during L. obliqua envenomation. An array of acute venom effects was characterized, including biochemical, hematological, histopathological, myotoxic and genotoxic alterations. Rapid increases in serum alanine and <b>aspartate</b> <b>transaminases,</b> γ-glutamyl transferase, lactate dehydrogenase, hemoglobin, bilirubin, creatinine, urea and uric acid were observed, indicating that intravascular hemolysis and liver and kidney damage had occurred. Treatment with a specific antivenom (antilonomic serum) for up to 2  h post-venom injection neutralized the biochemical alterations. However, treatment after 6  h post-venom injection failed to normalize all biochemical parameters, despite its efficacy in reversing coagulation dysfunction. The hematological findings were consistent with hemolytic anemia and neutrophilic leukocytosis. The histopathological alterations were mainly related to hemorrhage and inflammation in the subcutaneous tissue, lung, heart and kidneys. Signs of congestion and hemosiderosis were evident in the spleen, and hemoglobin and/or myoglobin casts were also detected in the renal tubules. Increased levels of creatine kinase and creatine kinase-MB were correlated with the myocardial necrosis observed in vivo and confirmed the myotoxicity detected in vitro in isolated extensor digitorum longus muscles. Significant DNA damage was observed in the kidneys, heart, lung, liver and lymphocytes. The majority of the DNA lesions in the kidney were due to oxidative damage.

As physicians frequently keep the patients on long-term lithium therapy, awareness of the numerous side effects and pathogenesis of this lightest alkali metal is needed for such treatments. The present {{study was designed to}} evaluate the toxic effect of small doses of lithium chloride in male Wistar rats. The oral administration of lithium chloride (15 and 30 mg/kg body wt) for 7 weeks through their drinking water elicited a significant alteration in their body weight and blood serum chemistry. The serum enzyme activities of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), high density lipoprotein (HDLP), and creatinine kinase (CK) were diminished, whereas the level of serum urea and glucose were elevated in the lithium treated animals, depicting the disturbed general physiological status. Furthermore, a marked inhibition in the activities of serum alanine and <b>aspartate</b> <b>transaminases</b> (ALT and AST) reflected a stimulating transamination reaction in hepatic and renal tissues. Lithium exposure also reduced the glutathione (GSH) level and stimulated the lipid peroxidation (LPO) level in the rat blood cells, indicating oxidative stress in the red blood cells due to lithium exposures. The histopathological observations of the liver and kidney tissues revealed many deformities and histological alterations due to lithium treatment.

Administration of the extract to rats had no effects on liver and body weights but the extract caused a decrease in albumin level and increases in the levels of <b>Aspartate</b> <b>Transaminases</b> (AST), Alanine Transaminases (ALT) and Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP). Histopathological assessment of the liver revealed mild to severe interstitial hemorrhage, mononuclear cell infiltration, necrosis, congestion and edema in the liver of the treated rats while withdrawal of the extract for 14 days showed a slight degree of recovery in the rats.
