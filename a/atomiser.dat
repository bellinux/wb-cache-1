5000|$|Scanning atomisers {{have been}} {{developed}} which allow the production of billets of up to 600 mm diameter, approximately twice the diameter possible with a static <b>atomiser.</b> The <b>atomiser</b> head is oscillated mechanically through 5 to 10° at a typical frequency of 25 Hz, to deflect the melt stream creating a spray path that is synchronised with the rotation speed of the collector plate in order to deposit a parallel-sided billet. By using programmable oscillating <b>atomiser</b> drives {{it was possible to}} improve the shape and shape reproducibility of spray formed deposits. It has been demonstrated that parallel sided, flat topped billets could be sprayed in a reproducible manner if the substrate rotation and <b>atomiser</b> oscillation frequency were synchronised and optimised for specific alloys and melt flow rates. Twin <b>atomiser</b> systems combine a static and scanning <b>atomiser,</b> making it possible to spray billets of up to 450 mm diameter with economic benefits.|$|E

5000|$|The melt stream {{exits the}} melt {{delivery}} nozzle into the spray chamber. The melt stream is protected from being destabilised by the turbulent gas {{environment in the}} spray chamber by primary gas jets operating at intermediate inert gas pressure of 2 to 4 bar, the resulting gas flow {{is parallel to the}} melt stream to stabilise the melt stream. The secondary <b>atomiser</b> uses high velocity (250 to 350 ms−1), high-pressure (6 to 10 bar) gas jets to impinge on the melt stream to achieve atomisation. The <b>atomiser</b> jets are usually arranged as an annulus or as discrete jets positioned symmetrically about the melt delivery nozzle, or less commonly, arranged as a linear nozzle for the production of strip products. Typical droplet diameters follow a log-normal distribution with powder diameters up to ~600 µm with a mass median diameter of ~150 µm.|$|E

5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{spray forming}} work {{was based on}} a resistively heated electric holding furnace. The melt then passed through a 3 mm diameter Al2O3 nozzle. However the low flow rate made a high superheat necessary to prevent solidification in the nozzle. The next generation melting procedures in spray forming applications were bottom pour induction units, which offer many benefits. In this system, the melting crucible is directly above the <b>atomiser</b> head with a ceramic nozzle feeding directly from the furnace to the <b>atomiser.</b> A stopper rod runs through the melt {{to the top of the}} pouring nozzle, the rod is withdrawn when the melt reaches the designated temperature for spraying, typically 50 to 150 C above the alloy's liquidus. Alternatively a pre-prepared plug of alloy to block the nozzle is used, and at a specified superheat this plug melts allowing the contents of the furnace to drain through the nozzle. Another problem associated with bottom pour furnaces is the change in flow rate associated with the reducing metalo-static head in the crucible. In some cases, introducing an inert gas overpressure during pouring can compensate for this effect.|$|E

The phototoxicity of glyphosate increased as carrier volume was reduced (thereby increasing herbicide concentration), but was not affected by changes in droplet size. There was no significant interaction between droplet size, spray volume, and active ingredient (a. i.) rate per hectare.

The flow and atomisation characteristics have been established and are discussed in terms of application to the gas turbine. It is apparent that savings in complexity, weight and hence cost of fuel systems may be achieved with drum <b>atomisers,</b> but these may be offset to some extent by the increased costs of full scale annular combustion chamber development...|$|R

50|$|After the {{development}} of aerial topdressing in New Zealand, large numbers of ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force Tiger Moths built in that country and in the United Kingdom were converted into agricultural aircraft; at the time, this was a pioneering use for aircraft. In this role, the front seat was commonly replaced with a hopper to hold superphosphate for aerial topdressing. A large number were also used to deploy insecticide in the crop-sprayer role, for which several alternative arrangements, including perforated piping being installed underneath the mainplanes or the placement of rotary <b>atomisers</b> on the lower mainplane, were used. From the mid-1950s onwards, these topdressers were gradually replaced by more modern types such as the PAC Fletcher; as such, {{a large number of}} New Zealand Tiger Moths in good flying condition were then passed to pilot owner enthusiasts.|$|R
40|$|The {{centrifugal}} atomisation of metallic melts using {{a rotating}} disk {{is an important}} process for powder production and spray deposition. The theoretical prediction of powder particle size is desirable {{for the design of}} <b>atomisers.</b> In this paper, wave theory was applied to analyse the disintegration of metallic melts in the film disintegration regime during centrifugal atomisation using a rotating disk. A mathematical model was proposed to predict the spray parameters. The governing equation for the fastest-growing wave number was developed and solved numerically. The effect of the variation in film thickness during film extension was taken into account. Film length and powder particle size were calculated and compared with available experimental data in the literature, and a good agreement was achieved. The influence of the break-up parameter was studied, and it is shown that the break-up parameter is not sensitive to the predicted powder particle size. Both simulated results and experimental data showed that fine powders can be produced by increasing disk speed...|$|R

50|$|During {{spraying}} it {{is essential}} to maintain a constant top surface temperature and hence maintain steady-state conditions if a billet with consistent microstructure is to be produced. At the billet surface, during spraying an enthalpy balance must be maintained where the rate of enthalpy lost (Hout) from the billet by conduction to the atomising gas and through the substrate, convection and radiation must be balanced with the rate of enthalpy input (Hin) from the droplets in the spray. There are a variety of factors that can be adjusted in order to maintain these conditions: spray height, <b>atomiser</b> gas pressure, melt flow rate, melt superheat and <b>atomiser</b> configuration, being those parameters most readily adjusted. Typically equipment such as closed circuit cameras and optical pyrometry can be used to monitor billet size/position and top surface temperature. If Hout is much greater Hin then a steady temperature is maintained at the billet top surface. The top surface should be in a mushy condition in order to promote sticking of incoming droplets and partial re-melting of solid particles. The necessary partial re-melting of solid droplets explains the absence of dendritic remnants from pre-solidified droplets in the final microstructure. If Hin is insufficient to cause significant re-melting, a ‘splat’ microstructure of layered droplets will form, typical of thermal spray processes such as vacuum plasma spraying (VPS), arc spraying and high velocity oxy-fuel. Processing maps have been produced for plasma spraying and spray forming using a steady-state heat balance in terms of the interlayer time (time between deposition events) against average deposition rate per unit area. These maps show the boundaries between banded un-fused microstructure and an equiaxed homogeneous structure.|$|E
50|$|Desmond Norman, {{recalled}} that Britten-Norman as an aircraft manufacturer {{came about because}} of his and John Britten's experiences as agricultural operators. The partnership began by converting Tiger Moths for export to New Zealand and later moved on to develop spraying equipment. Edward Bals designed the first Micronair rotary <b>atomiser</b> suitable for mounting on an aircraft but, rather than get involved with aircraft, he encouraged Britten-Norman Limited and Jim McMahon to set up Micronair Limited. At one time Britten-Norman operated 80 agricultural aircraft {{and the need to}} consider replacement equipment led to an association with Leyland Snow of Texas. The company acquired a one-third share in the Snow Aeronautical Corp. equity {{and a lot of the}} Snow Commander's development had taken place before the whole enterprise was sold to North American Rockwell. The aircraft became the Rockwell Thrush Commander. The success of the crop spraying operations funded the realisation of Britten and Norman's dream: to design and build an aeroplane. At the time, there was no other aircraft that filled its remit, and Norman foresaw the market potential of an island-hopping passenger plane. In 1963 Norman and Britten sold their share of Crop Culture to other members of the Board to concentrate their efforts on production of the Islander. A prototype, the G-ATCT, was completed within nine months and made its maiden flight in June 1965. Production was centred at Bembridge, Isle of Wight.|$|E
40|$|There {{is often}} great {{difficulty}} in measuring mean droplet size and drop size distribution in sprays because of sampling problems. This {{is particularly true}} if the spray is produced in the practical environment, for example in a high pressure combustion chamber, and the spray density is high. In recent {{years there has been}} a greater need to evaluate the characteristics of <b>atomisers</b> under such conditions and hence greater interest shown in optical methods which present the most convenient means for examining spray characteristics. It is not intended in this brief note to discuss in detail the principles involved with diffractive scattering methods of measuring mean droplet size, - this has been done very effectively elsewhere - but merely to outline some of the practicalities of producing a reliable instrument based on one method which has considerable promise. One of the early papers describing and evaluating this method was published by Dobbins, Crocco and Glassman in 1963, but the theoretical background on which the method is based was available much earlier … [cont. ]...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{measurement}} of the viscosity of fuels {{is essential for the}} proper operation of fuel supply systems and <b>atomisers.</b> In previous years, the use of fuels derived from the fast pyrolysis of biomass (bio-oils) has been demonstrated in, for example, furnace applications. Unfortunately, these fuels are shown to be unstable and start to polymerise even at ambient conditions. At elevated temperatures, these degradation phenomena become even more significant and complex. For example, vapours will be formed, not only due to the presence of volatiles and water in the oil, but also because of the decomposition of the oil. These vapours make the viscosity measurement troublesome. In the present paper, a procedure is proposed for the determination of the viscosity of such (unstable) bio-oils. First, by varying the sample temperature, the so-called decomposition temperature, at which the formation of vapours starts, should be determined. Below that decomposition temperature, the standard procedure for viscosity measurement can be applied. At temperatures above this temperature, the appearance of vapours results in a significant increase and strong fluctuations in the falling time of the ball due to the formation of bubbles. At these latter temperatures, values for the viscosity should be calculated from the lowest value of the falling time during the so-called heat-up period and the vapour formation delay. The values for the viscosity for five types of bio-oils, derived in this way, were shown to be reliable...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{describes}} a programme {{of research to}} determine ignition energy requirements in flowing kerosene spray air mixtures under various flow conditions such as velocity, mixture strength, spray mean drop size and drop distribution. In {{order to determine the}} spray characteristics of mixture ratio, mean drop size and drop distribution in the flowing fuel-air spray accurately, new designs have been evolved and employed. A single rectangular pulse of constant power was employed for initiating ignition in the mixture. The flow parameters were found to have considerable influence on spark characteristics and hence on the energy released in the spark. The breakdown voltage requirements of the spark in the two phase flow differed from they of premixed gaseous mixtures. In the range of weak mixtures investigated, optimum spark duration was found to vary depending on spray drop size between 30 and 60 microseconds. Minimum ignition energy increased with increase in velocity, but decreased with reduction in drop diameter and with increase in equivalence ratio. Low flow number <b>atomisers</b> giving small drop sizes extended the weak ignition limits for a given spark energy. Spray drop size and distribution were found to have a singularly large influence on all aspects of ignition. The thesis includes a detailed account of the designs and procedures employed in carrying out the investigation, and also a discussion on the significance of the results on the practical aspects of liquid fuel ignition in aero engine combustion system...|$|R
