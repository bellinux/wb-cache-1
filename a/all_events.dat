5|$|During {{the spring}} and summer, {{conditions}} along {{the east coast of}} Australia are highly conducive for the formation of hailstorms. The variation of air temperature in the atmosphere; with warm and humid air close to the ground and colder air above it causes instability, and the cold upper atmosphere temperatures allow the precipitation to fall in solid form as hailstones. Since records began in 1791, hailstorms in the month of January form approximately 13% {{of the total number of}} hailstorms in the Sydney metropolitan area, and over 15% of <b>all</b> <b>events</b> with 'large hail'.|$|E

For example, Mike Piazza grounded into his 27th double {{play of the}} season in the 9th inning, adding to his league-leading total. Similarly, Leiter's performance advanced his position on several 1999 statistical leaderboards including shutouts and walks issued. Reese, Ventura, and Ordóñez won Rawlings Gold Glove Awards for the season while Piazza and Alfonzo won Silver Sluggers. Robin Ventura also finished sixth in Most Valuable Player voting, with Chipper Jones taking the award.|$|E

5|$|Spacetimes are the arenas {{in which}} all {{physical}} events take place—an event is a point in spacetime specified by its time and place. The basic elements of spacetime are events. In any given spacetime, an event is a unique position at a unique time. Because events are spacetime points, in classical relativistic physics, the location of an elementary (point-like) particle {{at a particular time}} can be written as (x, y, z, t). A spacetime is the union of <b>all</b> <b>events</b> {{in the same way that}} a line is the union of all of its points, formally organized into a manifold.|$|E

Consequently, they advanced to the 1951 World Series, in which they were defeated by the New York Yankees.

Points are given for their performance in each event and the athlete with the greatest points total at the end of <b>all</b> <b>events</b> is the winner.|$|E
5|$|A tie-breaker was {{necessary}} after both teams finished {{the season with}} identical win–loss records of 86–76. The Twins, who had won the regular season series against the Tigers, 11 games to 7, were thus awarded home field due to a rules change prior to the 2009 season. It was the third tie-breaker played in MLB from 2007–2009. It was also the second consecutive tiebreaker for the AL Central title after 2008, when the Chicago White Sox defeated the Twins to win the division. The tie-breaker is counted as the 163rd regular season game played by both teams and <b>all</b> <b>events</b> in the game are added to regular season statistics. This was the Twins' final regular season game at the Metrodome as the team moved to Target Field for the 2010 season. The tie-breaker was later named the Best Regular-Season Game of the Decade by Sports Illustrated.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{the theory}} of denotational {{semantics}} of programming languages, several authors established the existence of particular kinds of “universal” domains. Here, we use a general model-theoretic result {{to show that there}} exists a unique countable universal homogeneous event structure. From this, we deduce that the category of <b>all</b> <b>event</b> domains, with stable embedding-projection pairs as morphisms, contains a universal object. Similarly, we also obtain a universal dI-domain. We also show that the category of <b>all</b> <b>event</b> domains is closed under inverse limits. Similar results are derived for Kahn and Plotkin's concrete data structures and concrete domains...|$|R

5|$|Basic indoor venues may {{be adapted}} gymnasiums, which can easily {{accommodate}} high jump competitions and short track events. Full-size indoor arenas (i.e. those fully equipped to host <b>all</b> <b>events</b> for the World Indoor Championships) bear similarities with their outdoor equivalents. Typically, a central area {{is surrounded by}} a 200-metre oval track with four to eight lanes. The track can be banked at the turns to allow athletes to run around the radius more comfortably. Some have a second running track going straight across the field area, parallel to the straights of the main circuit. This track is used for the 60 metres and 60 metres hurdles events, which are held almost exclusively indoors.|$|E
5|$|Chrysippus {{also argued}} for the {{existence}} of fate based on divination, which he thought there was good evidence for. It would not be possible for diviners to predict the future if the future itself was accidental. Omens and portents, he believed, are the natural symptoms of certain occurrences. There must be countless indications of the course of providence, for the most part unobserved, the meaning of only a few having become known to humanity. To those who argued that divination was superfluous as <b>all</b> <b>events</b> are foreordained, he replied that both divination and our behaviour under the warnings which it affords are included in the chain of causation.|$|E
5|$|Following a rain-delayed start, the Dodgers won Game 1 by a close 3–2 score, with a {{home run}} by John Roseboro {{providing}} the margin of victory. The Dodgers then won the series and the pennant with another close victory in Game 2; they {{came back from a}} three-run deficit to tie the game in the ninth and then ultimately defeated the Braves, 6–5, in extra innings. This victory advanced the Dodgers to the 1959 World Series, in which they defeated the Chicago White Sox, four games to two. In baseball statistics, the tie-breaker series counted as the 155th and 156th regular-season games for both teams, with <b>all</b> <b>events</b> in the series added to regular-season statistics.|$|E
