For in earlier times, his grandfather had told him, people were much concerned about the forces in nature which could affect their well-being, and to control or placate the “bogles”, the vaguely conceived supernatural beings in which these forces were invested, they practised many ritual observances which were hardly in conformity with the doctrines and ceremonies of established religion: the folk had ideas of their own, and ways of their own, as they’d kept up <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> hundreds of <b>years,</b> since the time when there weren’t no church, leastwise no church of that sort [...] So there were, so to say, two churches; the one with priests and candles, and all that; the other just a lot of old ways, kept up all unbeknown and hidden-like, midst the folk themselves.

40|$|Medical {{students}} are future {{doctors who are}} trained to treat all kinds of diseases including people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) without prejudice. Teaching basic scientifi c knowledge and technical skills is no longer adequate for today’s medical students. There is also a need {{for them to be}} provided with high personal and professional values. This study examined stigmatizing attitude towards people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) among the medical students in a public medical school. The participants were stratifi ed to preclinical-year (<b>year</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>year</b> 2) <b>and</b> clinical-year (<b>year</b> 3 <b>and</b> <b>year</b> 4) medical students. Simple random sampling was carried out to select 170 participants from each category of students. Self-administered questionnaires captured socio-demographic data, HIV/AIDS knowledge and stigmatisation attitudes towards PLWHA. Multiple linear regression was used to assess the relationship between ethnic groups and stigmatization attitude. Three hundred and forty participants were recruited. Malay medical students who did not have previous encounter with PLWHA were associated with stigmatizing attitude towards HIV/AIDS patients, whereas clinical-year medical students who had no clinical encounter with PLWHA were more likely to feel uncomfortable with PLWHA.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{estimate}} the economic costs of avoidable mortality (AM) in Colombia {{during the period}} 1998 to 2011, with the human capital perspective valuing the productivity lost. MethodsThe information of cases of avoidable death was identified from the Colombian official general mortality database, and we estimated the potential productivity years of life lost, assuming a productive life span between 18 <b>years</b> <b>and</b> 57 <b>years</b> <b>and</b> 18 <b>years</b> <b>and</b> 62 <b>years</b> in women <b>and</b> men, respectively. Two scenarios were built: lower loss with the minimum wage, and higher loss with the per capita gross domestic product. Total costs for the period were reported by sex and health event. Average cost per 1000 people was also estimated. All costs were adjusted and reported in 2012 US dollars. ResultsSixty-eight {{percent of the total}} AM in Colombia during the period 1998 to 2011 occurred during or before the productivity age. The total AM costs were estimated to range between US $ 80. 5 million and US $ 150. 4 million. Higher costs of AM were incurred in men. Events from the injuries group caused the higher productivity lost. ConclusionsAll the avoidable deaths in Colombia have a huge economic impact from the productivity lost perspective, equivalent to between 1. 6 % and 3. 0 % of the annual gross domestic product. The cost analyses in public health are an additional input for decision making and prioritization of intervention...|$|R

40|$|Objective Posttraumatic {{seizures}} (PTS) are well-recognized {{acute and}} chronic complications of {{traumatic brain injury}} (TBI). Risk factors have been identified, but considerable variability in who develops PTS remains. Existing PTS prognostic models are not widely adopted for clinical use and do not reflect current trends in injury, diagnosis, or care. We aimed to develop and internally validate preliminary prognostic regression models to predict PTS during acute care hospitalization, <b>and</b> at <b>year</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>year</b> 2 postinjury. Methods Prognostic models predicting PTS during acute care hospitalization <b>and</b> <b>year</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>year</b> 2 post-injury were developed using a recent (2011 – 2014) cohort from the TBI Model Systems National Database. Potential PTS predictors were selected based on previous literature and biologic plausibility. Bivariable logistic regression identified variables with a p-value < 0. 20 {{that were used to}} fit initial prognostic models. Multivariable logistic regression modeling with backward-stepwise elimination was used to determine reduced prognostic models and to internally validate using 1, 000 bootstrap samples. Fit statistics were calculated, correcting for overfitting (optimism). Results The prognostic models identified sex, craniotomy, contusion load, and pre-injury limitation in learning/remembering/concentrating as significant PTS predictors during acute hospitalization. Significant predictors of PTS at year 1 were subdural hematoma (SDH), contusion load, craniotomy, craniectomy, seizure during acute hospitalization, duration of posttraumatic amnesia, preinjury mental health treatment/psychiatric hospitalization, <b>and</b> preinjury incarceration. <b>Year</b> 2 significant predictors were similar to those of year 1 : SDH, intraparenchymal fragment, craniotomy, craniectomy, seizure during acute hospitalization, and preinjury incarceration. Corrected concordance (C) statistics were 0. 599, 0. 747, and 0. 716 for acute hospitalization, <b>year</b> 1, <b>and</b> <b>year</b> 2 models, respectively. Significance The prognostic model for PTS during acute hospitalization did not discriminate well. <b>Year</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>year</b> 2 models showed fair to good predictive validity for PTS. Cranial surgery, although medically necessary, requires ongoing research regarding potential benefits of increased monitoring for signs of epileptogenesis, PTS prophylaxis, and/or rehabilitation/social support.
