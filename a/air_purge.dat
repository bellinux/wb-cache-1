40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>purging</b> {{is a new}} way of {{reducing}} the moisture content of coarse coal (i. e. within the 50 - 0. 5 mm size range) products from vibrating basket centrifuges. The process, which involves injecting a turbulent stream of high velocity air through the coal bed as it traverses the centrifuge basket, has recently been shown to work at commercial scale. This paper describes some background modelling and experimental work that was undertaken to enhance understanding of the technique. The most critical variables affecting <b>air</b> <b>purging</b> are the speed of the air exiting the bed and the height of the bed itself. Both parameters were characterised at commercial scale through a combination of experimental tests and modelling. These data were then used to predict the flow rate of the air into the bed and also the pressure drop across it. The predicted values agreed well with the experimental data. Based on this information it was then possible to establish that the operating costs of <b>air</b> <b>purging</b> would be of the order of A$ 0. 02 - 0. 03 /ton of coal, considerably less than the financial gains associated with drier products. The next stage of assessing <b>air</b> <b>purging</b> would involve prolonged trials in different plant situations to resolve the remaining engineering issues. The technology is now sufficiently well understood for these trials to be approached with some confidence. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R

40|$|DWPF Engineering {{personnel}} {{requested that}} a new minimum backup film cooler air flow rate, which will meet the off-gas safety basis limits for both normal and seismic sludge-only operations, be calculated when the <b>air</b> <b>purge</b> to the borescope cameras is isolated from the melter. Specifically, it was requested that the latest calculations which were used to set the off-gas flammability safety bases for the sludge batch 2 and 3 feeds be revised, while maintaining all other process variables affecting off-gas flammability such as total organic carbon (TOC), feed rate, melter air purges, and vapor space temperature at their current respective maximum or minimum limits. Before attempting to calculate the new minimum backup film cooler air flow, {{some of the key}} elements of the combustion model were reviewed, and it was determined that the current minimum backup film cooler air flow of 233 lb/hr is adequate to satisfy the off-gas flammability safety bases for both normal and seismic operations i n the absence of any borescope camera <b>air</b> <b>purge.</b> It is, therefore, concluded that {{there is no need to}} revise the reference E- 7 calculations. This conclusion is in essence based on the fact that the current minimum backup film cooler air flow was set to satisfy the minimum combustion air requirement under the worst-case operating scenario involving a design basis earthquake during which all the air purges not only to the borescope cameras but to the seal pot are presumed to be lost due to pipe ruptures. The minimum combustion <b>air</b> <b>purge</b> is currently set at 150 per cent of the stoichiometric air flow required to combust 3 times the normal flow of flammable gases.

40|$|CSIRO/Novatech Consulting {{have been}} {{developing}} <b>air</b> <b>purging</b> {{as a new}} way of reducing the moisture content of coarse coal products from vibrating basket centrifuges. The process involves injecting a turbulent stream of high velocity air, via an air knife manifold, through the coal bed as it traverses the centrifuge basket. This paper describes the results obtained when the process was trialled in a commercial scale centrifuge, following successful previous bench and pilot scale work reported previously. Five manifolds of different shapes and sizes were tested. The best results were achieved with units of square cross-section, located close to the outlet edge of the basket. Depending on air speed, product moisture was reduced by between 0. 7 and 0. 9 wt% at a confidence level exceeding 95 %. The best results approached closely the 1. 0 wt% moisture reduction target which had been adopted as the project objective. <b>Air</b> <b>purging</b> had no significant effect on the content or size distribution of the solids in the centrate. Increasing air speed led to larger moisture reductions. Higher air speeds were needed compared with previous pilot scale work probably due to the thicker beds encountered in the full scale centrifuge. Despite the higher air speed, the actual air usage (cfm/t of coal) was much more efficient at full scale, being less than half that at pilot scale. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{sulphite}} ions on the xanthate-induced flotation of copper-activated pyrite has been studied.

Solution and spectroscopic studies indicated that sodium bisulphite interacted with the pyrite surface, as well as with isobutyl xanthate in solution and its adsorbed state.

It was suggested that both the decomposition of the xanthate in solution via perxanthate formation and dixanthogen desorption from the pyrite surface were responsible for the pyrite depression.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{demonstrates the}} sensitivity of antigorite dehydroxylation to treatment conditions and discusses {{the implications of the}} observations for scientific (i. e., dehydroxylation kinetics) and technological (i. e., energy efficient conditions and design of practical activation reactors) applications. At present, the energy cost of dehydroxylation of serpentinite ores represent the most important impediment for a large scale implementation of sequestering CO 2 by mineralization. We have analyzed changes in antigorite 2 ̆ 7 s derivative thermogravimetric curves (DTG) and deduced factors affecting the mass loss profiles. The imposed heating rate, type of purge gas, type of comminution and sample mass all influence the dehydroxylation curve. However, the results show no influence of material of construction of the heating vessel and flow rate of the purge gas. We report an important effect of oxidation of Fe 2 + under <b>air</b> <b>purge</b> gas that occurs prior to dehydroxylation and leads to formation of hematite skins on serpentinite particles, slowing down subsequent mass transfer and increasing the treatment temperature. From the process perspective, 75 μm particles afford optimal conditions of temperature and rate of dehydroxylation.

For this, the new method for efficient pollution prevention was designed and the characteristic evaluation for developing the system is partly performed. Formerly, the method using <b>air</b> <b>purge</b> is generally used for preventing the pollution of camera window. However, the conventional method often induces contaminations due to back flow of air purging. These pollutants can be crucial damage to the camera window and peripheral materials especially in clean room condition.

To solve above mentioned the problem, the efficient concept for preventing pollution of camera window is proposed in this research. Without air purging, we proposed the new method using repulsion induced by electrifying dirty or moisture to positive magnetic force with high-voltage charge and then injecting gas to the ITO(Indium Tin Oxide) coating window for generating positive ion. To sum up, in this research, we aim to develop an efficient pollution preventing system for camera window based on the new method through characteristic evaluation and stabilization of the designed system...|$|E
