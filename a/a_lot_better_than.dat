25|$|After {{struggling}} to establish himself for New South Wales thereafter, Jaques transformed his career by signing for the English County Championship side Northamptonshire in 2003. He was prolific, hitting over 1200 runs including a triple century {{and returned to}} NSW an established member of the Pura Cup Champions. 2003/04 saw the consolidation of Jaques' English form in Australia as he built a reputation of being a player who could score quickly but also occupy the crease for many hours. After returning to England to play for Yorkshire (1,118 runs in 2004 and 1,359 in 2005) and maintaining a consistent standard with New South Wales (1,191 runs in 2004–05), many were calling for his promotion to the national team. He went back to England to play for Worcestershire for the 2006 and 2007 seasons, where he scored 1689 runs in 18 matches. Uniquely for the current Australian test team, Jaques has played more first-class games overseas than he has in Australia (62 overseas, mainly in England, 51 in Australia as of 25 November 2007). His batting average in the English County Championship is also quite <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> his average in the Pura Cup (59.31 compared to 47.46 as of 25 November 2007).|$|E

[...] He also praised Regbo and Temple, saying [...] "Regbo, as the teenage Nemo, and Juno Temple, as the teenage Anna, are impressive, bringing the hormonal battles of adolescence vividly to life." [...] Film critic Eric Lavallée listed Regbo as one of his [...] "Top 10 New Faces & Voices" [...] of 2009 Toronto International Film Festival.

Justifying the remix, Steven Wilson said: [...] "Jethro Tull's Aqualung is... a masterpiece, but was sonically a very poor-sounding record. So, some didn't rate it as highly as they should have. What we did with Aqualung was really make that record gleam {{in a way it}} never gleamed before. I think a lot of people, including myself, have come around to thinking that the album is <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> they even gave it credit for previously.

Gene Emery of The Providence Journal said the game was [...] "an impressive work, a sophisticated mix of live action and a rich computer-generated environment, coupled with a musical score that's spooky without being overwhelming". He also called the gameplay [...] "elegant in its simplicity". San Francisco Chronicle writer Laura Evenson called it unpredictable and addictive, comparing it to a good mystery novel. A reviewer for Next Generation {{was pleased with the}} story, the production values of the cutscenes, and the way the game mixed in full motion video without resulting in slowdown or poor control. However, he found that the lack of a challenge made it a poor value for experienced gamers, since {{they would be able to}} finish the entire game in a day or two, and recommended it strictly for gamers who were new to the adventure genre. Ric Manning of the Gannett News Service wrote, [...] "The graphics are terrific, but don't play on a full stomach." [...] Steve La Rue of U-T San Diego found the game [...] "visually opulent and interesting" [...] with [...] "dialogue <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> I expected, given the trite gothic novel plot", but also said he had to adjust to the [...] "gradual, contemplative pace". Jack Warner of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote: [...] "It's hackneyed, but the art is so good, the acting sufficiently convincing and the atmosphere brooding enough to keep you going", although he said [...] "precious little happens" [...] in the first few discs.|$|E
