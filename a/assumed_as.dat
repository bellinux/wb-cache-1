5|$|As an {{official}} {{history of the}} Japanese Navy, Sakamoto's work {{was considered to be}} official admission of the attacking submarine's identity. Subsequently, most sources <b>assumed</b> <b>as</b> fact Nakagawa's and I-177s role in the loss of Centaur. Nakagawa refused to speak {{on the subject of the}} attack on Centaur following the war crimes investigation at the end of World War II, even to defend himself or deny the claims made by Rohwer's and Sakamoto's works, and died in 1991.|$|E
5|$|In July 1934, {{as part of}} a depression-relief effort, the Carrying Place Trail through Prince Edward County and the United Counties of Lennox and Addington was <b>assumed</b> <b>as</b> an {{extension}} of Highway33. (The section between Trenton and Glenora was assumed on July4, 1934, the section between Adolphustown and Kingston on July11.) The provincially operated ferries, as the first to operate without a toll on the route, entered service after 1936.|$|E

5|$|The Romans {{were now}} {{in control of}} Armenia, and they {{promptly}} installed its new king, Tigranes VI, the last descendant of the Cappadocian royal house, in Tigranocerta. Some outlying western parts of Armenia were also ceded to the Roman vassals. Corbulo left 1,000 legionaries, three auxiliary cohorts and two cavalry alae (ca. 3-4,000 men) behind to support the new monarch, and retired {{with the rest of}} his army to Syria, whose governorship he now (in 60 AD) <b>assumed</b> <b>as</b> a reward for his success.|$|E
5|$|Accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) {{is used by}} the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration {{and other}} {{agencies}} to express the activity of individual tropical cyclones that are above tropical storm strength and entire tropical cyclone seasons. It is calculated by taking the squares of the estimated maximum sustained velocity of every active tropical storm (wind speed 35 knots or higher) at six-hour intervals. The numbers are usually divided by 10,000 to make them more manageable. The unit of ACE is 104 kn2, and for use as an index the unit is <b>assumed.</b> <b>As</b> well as being squared for ACE, wind speed can also be cubed, which {{is referred to as the}} Power Dissipation Index (PDI).|$|E
25|$|On February10 and February17, the route, still incomplete, was {{surveyed}} and <b>assumed</b> <b>as</b> {{an extension}} of Highway7. The new highway was opened to traffic in August, 1932.|$|E

25|$|Internal {{forces are}} {{produced}} between the particles of a deformable object, <b>assumed</b> <b>as</b> a continuum, {{as a reaction}} to applied external forces, i.e., either surface forces or body forces. This reaction follows from Euler's laws of motion for a continuum, which are equivalent to Newton's laws of motion for a particle. A measure of the intensity of these internal forces is called stress. Because the object is <b>assumed</b> <b>as</b> a continuum, these internal forces are distributed continuously within the volume of the object.|$|E
25|$|The Global Protection Against Limited Strikes (GPALS) {{system was}} first {{introduced}} by President George H.W. Bush in 1991. This system was created to adjust and repurpose former President Ronald Reagan’s Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). The GPALS system was introduced {{at a time when}} the relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States was becoming less hostile. One of the core ideas behind the GPALS system was that the Soviet Union would not always be <b>assumed</b> <b>as</b> the aggressor and the United States would not always be <b>assumed</b> <b>as</b> the target.|$|E

25|$|For {{native peoples}} like the Māori in New Zealand, there is {{conflict}} between the fluid identity <b>assumed</b> <b>as</b> part of modern society and the traditional identity with the obligations that accompany it; the loss of language heightens the feeling of isolation and damages the ability to perpetuate tradition.|$|E

25|$|After {{performing}} a stress analysis on a material body <b>assumed</b> <b>as</b> a continuum, {{the components of}} the Cauchy stress tensor at a particular material point are known with respect to a coordinate system. The Mohr circle is then used to determine graphically the stress components acting on a rotated coordinate system, i.e., acting on a differently oriented plane passing through that point.|$|E
25|$|New-Keynesian {{economics}} is {{also associated with}} developments in the Keynesian fashion. Within this group researchers tend to share with other economists the emphasis on models employing micro foundations and optimizing behaviour but with a narrower focus on standard Keynesian themes such as price and wage rigidity. These are usually made to be endogenous features of the models, rather than simply <b>assumed</b> <b>as</b> in older Keynesian-style ones.|$|E
25|$|In September 2014, the Angolan Institute for Cancer Control (IACC) {{was created}} by presidential decree, and it will {{integrate}} the National Health Service in Angola. The purpose of this new centre is to ensure the health and medical care in oncology, policy implementation, programmes and plans for prevention and specialised treatment. This cancer institute will be <b>assumed</b> <b>as</b> a reference institution in the central and southern regions of Africa.|$|E

25|$|From {{the late}} 1970s {{to the early}} 1990s many Americans <b>assumed</b> <b>as</b> {{a matter of course}} that students' {{self-esteem}} acted as a critical factor in the grades that they earn in school, in their relationships with their peers, and in their later success in life. Under this assumption, some American groups created programs which aimed to increase the self-esteem of students. Until the 1990s little peer-reviewed and controlled research took place on this topic.|$|E
25|$|In 1803 Gian Francesco Malfatti {{posed the}} problem of cutting three {{cylindrical}} columns out of a triangular prism of marble, maximizing the total volume of the columns. He <b>assumed,</b> <b>as</b> did many others after him, that {{the solution to this}} problem was given by three tangent circles within the triangular cross-section of the wedge. That is, more abstractly, he conjectured that the three Malfatti circles have the maximum total area of any three disjoint circles within a given triangle.|$|E
