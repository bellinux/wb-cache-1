5|$|Evan {{suspects}} {{that one of}} his neighbors is an alien due to his strange, stiff way of speaking and because he <b>always</b> <b>seems</b> to be watching Evan. As the watch scouts the neighbor's house, Bob learns that Chelsea is at an unsupervised party with Jason. Bob disobeys Evan's orders and rushes to the party with Franklin. Bob prevents Jason from raping Chelsea, but Jason beats him until Franklin intervenes. Evan and Jamarcus investigate the odd neighbor alone, discovering that he hosts orgies in his basement. When Bob returns, he and Evan argue over his putting his daughter above the watch. Bob is fired from the watch after saying Evan has no friends because he tries to control everything. Evan goes home and admits his infertility to Abby, who accepts the news and tells him they will work things out.|$|E
5|$|Ramanujam Iyengar alias Ambi is an {{orthodox}} Brahmin and a straightforward consumer protection advocate living in Triplicane, Chennai. He expects everyone {{to follow the}} law and prosecutes those who violate it. However, his efforts fail as circumstantial evidence <b>always</b> <b>seems</b> to favour the accused. He also fails to raise civic awareness due to pervasive corruption and {{a general lack of}} seriousness. Frustrated at his inability to bring about a change in society, his suppressed anger manifests itself in an alter-ego named Anniyan, a grim reaper-themed serial killer who punishes corrupt and indifferent people. Anniyan creates a website, compiles a list of wrongdoers from his site, and kills them using punishments described in the Garuda Puranam, one of the ancient Hindu scriptures.|$|E
5|$|Scully and Ritter soon {{discover}} that their prime suspect, Alfred Fellig, {{who has worked}} as a police photographer since 1964, has not aged at all in any of his official photos on his renewal applications. Elsewhere in the city, Fellig watches a criminal kill a youth for his sneakers. When he approaches to take photos of the dying young man, the murderer returns and repeatedly stabs Fellig, but he pulls the knife out of his back and walks away. Scully and Ritter learn of the crime and of the fact that Fellig's prints are on the knife. Ritter demands to know how Fellig <b>always</b> <b>seems</b> to be around when people die, but Scully realizes that the man is in pain and asks whether he was wounded in the attack which Fellig says he merely observed. When she sees the wounds on his back she sends him to the hospital, much to Ritter's chagrin. Ritter reminds Scully that they are trying to charge Fellig with murder, not let him go.|$|E
