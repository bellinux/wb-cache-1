40|$|Fluctuating {{asymmetry}} (FA) {{is often}} used {{as an indicator of}} perturbed development. As organisms placed under greater stress, less energy is available to buffer their development compared to unstressed individuals and increasing levels of asymmetry. Therefore, individual asymmetry scores within a population {{can be used as a}} measure of an organism’s ability to buffer its development and can be considered as an indirect measurement of individual fitness. In this study a test was conducted to know any correlation among FA and four fitness traits in giant featherback (Chitala lopis) inhabiting non acidified and <b>acidified</b> <b>region</b> along the Kampar River. Three bilateral meristic characters were counted on each side of the fish: number of gill rakers on the lower first branchial arch, eyes diameter, and number of pectoral-fin rays and four traits related to the fitness were measured: egg diameter, size of first maturity, gonad somatic index, and fecundity. Results show that FA (both number and magnitude) levels are differerent, giant featherback inhabiting more acidic station were slightly more asymmetric than those from less acidic one except to those inhabiting alkali station. However, the reproductive investment of giant featherback in the five sampling stations studied here gave no indication that the populations strongly affected by acidification. In this study it did not find any significant negative correlation between FA and any of the measured fitness traits. Therefore it can be concluded that FA is not a useful measure of fitness in this species...|$|E
40|$|AIMS: Contraction of {{the heart}} is {{regulated}} by electrically evoked Ca(2 +) transients (CaTs). H(+) ions, the end products of metabolism, modulate CaTs through direct interactions with Ca(2 +) -handling proteins and via Na(+) -mediated coupling between acid-extruding proteins (e. g. Na(+) /H(+) exchange, NHE 1) and Na(+) /Ca(2 +) exchange. Restricted H(+) diffusivity in cytoplasm predisposes pH-sensitive Ca(2 +) signalling to becoming non-uniform, but the involvement of readily diffusible intracellular Na(+) ions may provide a means for combatting this. METHODS AND RESULTS: CaTs were imaged in fluo 3 -loaded rat ventricular myocytes paced at 2 Hz. Cytoplasmic [Na(+) ] ([Na(+) ]i) was imaged using SBFI. Intracellular acidification by acetate exposure raised diastolic and systolic [Ca(2 +) ] (also observed with acid-loading by ammonium prepulse or CO₂ exposure). The systolic [Ca(2 +) ] response correlated with a rise in [Na(+) ]i and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2 +) load, and was blocked by the NHE 1 inhibitor cariporide (CO₂/HCO₃(-) -free media). Exposure of one half of a myocyte to acetate using dual microperfusion (CO₂/HCO₃(-) -free media) raised diastolic [Ca(2 +) ] locally in the <b>acidified</b> <b>region.</b> Systolic [Ca(2 +) ] and CaT amplitude increased more uniformly {{along the length of}} the cell, but only when NHE 1 was functional. Cytoplasmic Na(+) diffusivity (DNa) was measured in quiescent cells, with strophanthidin present to inhibit the Na(+) /K(+) pump. With regional acetate exposure to activate a local NHE-driven Na(+) -influx, DNa was found to be sufficiently fast (680 µm(2) /s) for transmitting the pH-systolic Ca(2 +) interaction over long distances. CONCLUSIONS: Na(+) ions are rapidly diffusible messengers that expand the spatial scale of cytoplasmic pH-CaT interactions, helping to co-ordinate global Ca(2 +) signalling during conditions of intracellular pH non-uniformity...|$|E
40|$|Carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2 }) {{injection}} {{into deep}} geologic formations could decrease the atmospheric accumulation of this gas from anthropogenic sources. Furthermore, by co-injecting H{sub 2 }S or SO{sub 2 }, the products respectively of coal gasification or combustion, with captured CO{sub 2 }, {{problems associated with}} surface disposal would be mitigated. We developed models that simulate the co-injection of H{sub 2 }S or SO{sub 2 } with CO{sub 2 } into an arkose formation {{at a depth of}} about 2 km and 75 C. The hydrogeology and mineralogy of the injected formation are typical of those encountered in Gulf Coast aquifers of the United States. Six numerical simulations of a simplified 1 -D radial region surrounding the injection well were performed. The injection of CO{sub 2 } alone or co-injection with SO{sub 2 } or H{sub 2 }S results in a concentrically zoned distribution of secondary minerals surrounding a leached and <b>acidified</b> <b>region</b> adjacent to the injection well. Co-injection of SO{sub 2 } with CO{sub 2 } results in a larger and more strongly acidified zone, and alteration differs substantially from that caused by the co-injection of H{sub 2 }S or injection of CO{sub 2 } alone. Precipitation of carbonates occurs within a higher pH (pH > 5) peripheral zone. Significant quantities of CO{sub 2 } are sequestered by ankerite, dawsonite, and lesser siderite. The CO{sub 2 } mineral-trapping capacity of the formation can attain 40 - 50 kg/m{sup 3 } medium for the selected arkose. In contrast, secondary sulfates precipitate at lower pH (pH < 5) within the acidified zone. Most of the injected SO{sub 2 } is transformed and immobilized through alunite precipitation with lesser amounts of anhydrite and minor quantities of pyrite. The dissolved CO{sub 2 } increases with time (enhanced solubility trapping). The mineral alteration induced by injection of CO{sub 2 } with either SO{sub 2 } or H{sub 2 }S leads to corresponding changes in porosity. Significant increases in porosity occur in the acidified zones where mineral dissolution dominates. With co-injection of SO{sub 2 }, the porosity increases from an initial 0. 3 to 0. 43 after 100 years. However, within the CO{sub 2 } mineral-trapping zone, the porosity decreases to about 0. 28 for both cases, because of the addition of CO{sub 2 } mass as secondary carbonates to the rock matrix. Precipitation of sulfates at the acidification front causes porosity to decrease to 0. 23. The limited information currently available on the mineralogy of naturally occurring high-pressure CO{sub 2 } reservoirs is generally consistent with our simulations...|$|E
40|$|ON poor, acidified soils in The Netherlands, an {{increasing}} number of great tits, Parus major, and other forest passerines, produce eggs with thin and porous shells 1. Here we show that the egg-shell defects, and the related high incidence of clutch desertion and empty nests, are caused by calcium deficiency, that snail shells are the main calcium source for the laying female, but that snails are scarce on poor soils. Similar laying irregularities in birds are reported from <b>acidified</b> <b>regions</b> elsewhere in Europe 2 - 4. We provide evidence that snails declined by a decrease in soil calcium on poor soils. Acid deposition is the main cause for decreasing calcium levels in such soils 5 - 7. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental evidence for calcium limitation in wild birds and it reveals a previously overlooked mechanism by which acidification affects higher trophic levels of the forest ecosystem...|$|R
40|$|International {{policy action}} {{has led to}} {{significant}} reduction of sulphur emissions, and subsequent deposition, which resulted in widespread improvements in the water chemistry of <b>acidified</b> <b>regions.</b> However, biological recovery appears to be much slower than chemical recovery. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze temporal changes of invertebrate communities in acidified rivers and lakes, and disentangle the environmental causes of the observed changes. The analysis was performed using long-term data from rivers (25 - 30 years) and lakes (~ 15 years) in three catchments along the west coast of Southern Norway, which represent a gradient of non-marine sulphur deposition. We performed statistical analysis using both biological indices and ordination methods. First, our results show that invertebrate communities in rivers shifted from a state with low or absence of acid-sensitive taxa to an alternate state with higher richness and abundance of acid-sensitive taxa. These biological shifts coincided with previously defined chemical thresholds. Second, there was no invertebrate community change recorded in the lakes, even though chemical recovery was comparable to the rivers. This finding may relate to limited variation in habitat and refuges, which may make them less susceptible to re-colonisation of acid-sensitive taxa, or it may relate to the taxonomic resolution. Third, our result indicate that the recovery of invertebrate communities in rivers is primarily related to reduced sulphur deposition, and associated water chemistry. Superimposed on the long-term trends, temperature fluctuations and sea-salt episodes have caused short-term variability in the invertebrate community. We did not identify impacts of temperature rise on the long-term invertebrate community trends. We conclude on the importance of a continuous research effort to disentangling the complex link between acidification, and climate on invertebrate community change...|$|R
40|$|Adult {{stem cells}} {{maintain}} tissue integrity by dividing and producing progeny that differentiate to replace damaged and old cells, {{as they are}} lost. Both division and differentiation must be tailored to the number and type of cells lost for homeostasis to be maintained. In this thesis I address how adult stem cell identity is established and maintained in the Drosophila midgut. The Drosophila midgut, like the intestine of mammals, is composed of multiple regions that contain cells of distinct morphology and function. In this study I focus on the <b>acidified</b> <b>region</b> of the midgut, {{referred to as the}} copper cell region (CCR), in order to understand how regional stem cells are established and maintain their identity. I show that intestinal stem cells (ISCs) are specified during metamorphosis. Stem cell number increases by symmetric division of pupal escargot (esg) expressing cells. By altering the expression of the Notch ligand Delta in the muscle of pupae I show that Delta from the muscle is involved in maintaining undifferentiated pupal ISCs. Next I investigate the origin of the adult CCR and the pathways that regulate copper cell and copper cell identity. Despite the fact that both the larval and the adult CCR cells function as acid secreting cells and express the homeodomain protein Labial, the adult CCR is distinct from the larval copper cells: it arises from a distinct set of cells and does not express the enhancers that have been shown to regulate larval copper cell expression of Labial. I identify a new enhancer in the first intron of labial that accurately reflects expression of Labial protein. I show that the BMP pathway is expressed from the visceral muscle above the adult CCR and that the Dpp ligand is necessary for copper cell differentiation. I then show that the ISCs of the CCR are normally slowly dividing (once every 4 - 5 days), but will divide and differentiate with damage or cell death. CCR ISCs are stimulated to divide by the JAK/STAT pathway, the same pathway that regulates proliferation in response to damage {{in the rest of the}} midgut. CCR ISC differentiation is also Notch dependent just as the rest of the midgut is. I also show that the quiescence of CCR ISCs is dependent on acidification of that region, suggesting that acidification is responsible for a decrease in damage and subsequent low turnover. I then investigate when regional ISC identity is established and show that both Labial and BMP signaling are present in one region of the pupal midgut beginning at 20 hours after pupal formation. Then I express dpp from all of the muscle cells to show that pupal cells can be specified into copper cells during pupation but not afterwards. BMP activation in pupal EC cells is capable of transforming them to copper cells, but those cells are not maintained in the adult. BMP activation in pupal ISCs also alters their identity, as they begin producing ectopic copper cells after several days in the adult. I show that copper cell ISC identity can be altered only during a window of pupation and that those cells can then respond to BMP signals in the adult to produce new copper cells. This demonstrates that adult stem cell identity in this region is the result of intrinsic or remembered signals that restrict or alter the ability to receive local environmental cues. Finally I investigate the role of chromatin modifying genes in establishment and maintenance of ISC identity. I carried out an RNAi screen and identified a number of genes whose knockdown alters ISC identity. I also demonstrate that when ISCs are heritably marked during pupation rather than in adulthood, a distinct set of quiescent ISCs can be identified. This evidence indicates that our current understanding of midgut ISC proliferation is incomplete and that a novel quiescent stem cell might exist in the Drosophila midgut...|$|E
