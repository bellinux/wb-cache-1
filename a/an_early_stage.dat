She began writing at <b>an</b> <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> in her life, although her first novel, A Bigamists' Daughter, was not published until 1982.

It is a typical early Norman design with solid pillars and arches. In 1074 D'Oyly and his close friend, Roger d'Ivry endowed a chapel with a college of priests. At <b>an</b> <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> it acquired a dedication to Saint George.|$|E

5|$|The {{episodes of}} the Shaman King anime series are {{directed}} by Seiji Mizushima and co-produced by TV Tokyo, NAS, and Xebec. At <b>an</b> <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> of anime production, Takei himself helped the anime's staff. However, he soon left the staff {{due to his}} time limitations as he {{was working in the}} manga. The 64 episodes were aired between July 4, 2001, and September 25, 2002, on TV Tokyo in Japan. 4Kids Entertainment obtained the rights to broadcast the Shaman King anime in the United States, where it premiered on Fox Box on September 6, 2003.|$|E

In more advanced cases, radiation therapy, chemotherapy or hormone therapy may also be recommended. If the disease is diagnosed at <b>an</b> <b>early</b> <b>stage,</b> the outcome is favorable, and the overall five-year survival rate in the United States is greater than 80%.|$|E
5|$|The wood used {{to build}} the track is now classed as bog-wood, the name given to wood (of any source) that for long periods (sometimes {{hundreds}} of thousands of years) has been buried in peat bogs, and kept from decaying by the acidic and anaerobic bog conditions. Bog-wood usually is stained brown by tannins dissolved in the acidic water, and represents <b>an</b> <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> of fossilisation. The age of the track prompted large-scale excavations in 1973, funded by the Department of the Environment.|$|E
5|$|A typical {{feature in}} Vanajas was over-engineered {{structures}} which were robust rather than optimised. The main components were sourced from well-established suppliers. VAT also showed progressive thinking in driver ergonomics; the comfortably sprung and hydraulically damped driver's seat was positioned {{close to the}} door, to ease reversing. The seat had several {{ways in which it}} could be adjusted. Hanging pedals, which were set to the same level, became standard at <b>an</b> <b>early</b> <b>stage.</b> Vanaja's interior heater, which produced 9,000kcal/h, was possibly the most efficient available in lorries by the 1960s. Many Vanaja drivers valued the particularly soft suspension of the vehicles. Two-axle lorries were available in 4×2 and 4×4 layouts; the three-axle models were produced as 6×2, 6×4, 4×4+2 and 6×6.|$|E

5|$|As runners-up to League champions Manchester United in the 1996 FA Cup Final, Liverpool {{were able}} {{to compete in the}} 1996–97 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup.

In the next two seasons, Liverpool played in the UEFA Cup but were eliminated at <b>an</b> <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> of the competition, by Strasbourg and Celta de Vigo, respectively. A seventh-place finish in the 1998–99 FA Premier League meant the club did not qualify for Europe in 1999–2000.|$|E
5|$|Aston and Taylor {{subsequently}} {{decided to}} work together on a new archaeological television series, devising the format for Time Team. Whilst Taylor organised the film production side of the project with Channel 4, Aston located suitable sites to excavate, and gathered together a team of specialists to appear on the show, among them field archaeologists Harding and Carenza Lewis, artist Victor Ambrus, and historian Robin Bush. He knew the actor and television presenter Tony Robinson after they had met on an archaeological course in Greece, and successfully requested that he present the show. From <b>an</b> <b>early</b> <b>stage,</b> they had agreed that every episode would feature a practical process or a re-enactment alongside the field archaeology.|$|E
5|$|At <b>an</b> <b>early</b> <b>stage,</b> in {{documents}} {{written in}} the paleo-Hebrew script, words were divided by short vertical lines and later by dots, as reflected by the Mesha Stone, the Siloam inscription, the Ophel inscription, and paleo-Hebrew script documents from Qumran. Word division was not used in Phoenician inscriptions; however, there is not direct evidence for biblical texts being written without word division, as suggested by Nahmanides {{in his introduction to}} the Torah. Word division using spaces was commonly used {{from the beginning of the}} 7th century BCE for documents in the Aramaic script. In addition to marking vowels, the Tiberian system also uses cantillation marks, which serve to mark word stress, semantic structure, and the musical motifs used in formal recitation of the text.|$|E

5|$|Besides {{being criticized}} for its limited powers, {{there is also}} some concern that the Council's {{responsibilities}} may go too far. By taking up the function of scrutinizing existing and prospective legislation for differentiating measures and inconsistencies with fundamental liberties, the Council may be encroaching on the functions of constitutional interpretation, which is traditionally the function of courts. Even though the Council has the additional advantage of identifying potentially unconstitutional legislation at <b>an</b> <b>early</b> <b>stage,</b> thereby preventing unnecessary litigation in the future, there is doubt as to the ability of the Council to take on such a task. Given that constitutional interpretation is traditionally the function of lawyers and the courts, the task may be best carried out by the legally trained members of the PCMR.|$|E
5|$|From <b>an</b> <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> in his career, Douglas {{attracted}} commissions from {{wealthy and}} powerful patrons, {{the first of}} which came from Hugh Cholmondeley, 2nd Baron Delamere. His most important patrons were the Grosvenor family of Eaton Hall, namely Richard Grosvenor, 2nd Marquess of Westminster, Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster, and Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster. Douglas designed a large number and variety of buildings in the family's Eaton Hall estate and the surrounding villages. Other important patrons were William Molyneux, 4th Earl of Sefton, Rowland Egerton-Warburton of Arley Hall, George Cholmondeley, 5th Marquess of Cholmondeley, and Francis Egerton, 3rd Earl of Ellesmere. Later in his career Douglas carried out commissions for W.E.Gladstone and his family, and for W.H.Lever.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln Castle is {{bounded by}} a stone curtain wall, with ditches {{on all sides}} except the south. From <b>an</b> <b>early</b> <b>stage,</b> the outer walls which enclose the site were built in stone and they date from before 1115. On the south side the walls are {{interrupted}} by two earthen mounds called mottes. One is in the south-east corner, and was probably an original feature of William's the Conqueror's castle, while the other occupies the south-west corner. A square tower, the Observatory Tower, stands {{on top of the}} first mound, standing above the outer walls to dominate the city of Lincoln. The second mound is crowned by the 'Lucy Tower', which was probably built in the 12th century and was named after Lucy of Bolingbroke, the Countess of Chester until 1138.|$|E
