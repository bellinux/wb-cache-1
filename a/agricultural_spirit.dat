The Alaska State Fair holds contests for largest vegetable in several categories, and many national and even world records have been recorded at the fair, with the cabbage, radish, spinach and lettuce categories usually dominating local interest. In 2008, Scott Robb of Palmer won 1st place and a $2,000 prize for his 79.1 lb cabbage.|$|E
50|$|Numerous Feldgeister {{are known}} in German folklore, some shaped as animals, some in human form. The last grain heads and tree fruits are often left at their {{place as a}} {{sacrifice}} for the <b>agricultural</b> <b>spirits.</b> During harvest season Feldgeister flee deeper into the fields to escape the mowers. With the last cornstalks the corn spirit becomes trapped. Either it is killed by cutting the grain heads, threshing the corn or it is brought to the village in a ceremonial manner, shaped as a corn doll. Direct contact to the Feldgeist causes illness.|$|R

Anise-flavored tsipouro and ouzo have almost identical taste but vary enormously in their method of production. The alcohol {{used to produce}} ouzo is 96% ABV ethyl alcohol of <b>agricultural</b> origin (rectified <b>spirit</b> obtained from <b>agricultural</b> products) and therefore does not retain the flavours of the primary distilled products, whereas the lower degree of distillation of tsipouro allows it to retain the aroma of the pomace.|$|R

5000|$|Sandstrom and Sandstrom {{divide the}} paper {{cut-outs}} used by shamans into four categories {{based on the}} spirit they represent: disease causing spirits (for curing rituals), seed <b>spirits</b> (<b>agricultural</b> productivity), witness <b>spirits</b> (intermediaries between shamans and other powerful spirits), and those adornments which help welcome spirits coming to accept their altar offerings. These spirits are found in all four realms of the universe. It is in manipulating life forces that shamans have power, for example, to cure diseases and ensure agricultural productivity. Disease and Paper Figures [...] Knowledge of Nahua worldview provides valuable insight into the study of disease in their communities. Rather than locating disease in an anatomical organ system or seeking a pathogenic cause for the physical malady, such as in Western biomedicine, Nahua look to the ultimate causes for “disharmony or imbalanced that has occurred between the patient {{and his or her}} physical and social surroundings”. Curing rituals, performed by shamans, help restore harmonic balance and therein work to eliminate the disease by uncovering why a spirit might choose to affect the patient. Understanding reasons for the spirit indwelling is the first component of the ritual. Shamans use divination to uncover this rationale and causes often include “sorcery, gossiping neighbors, an angry house spirit, stumbling, falling, or any other occurrence in which a person is suddenly frightened…or any act or failed obligation {{on the part of the}} patient that has angered earth, water, or celestial spirits or the soul of a deceased kinsman”. Once the spirit is identified it can be removed. This removal allows the weakened patient to be able to renew their supply of energy and heal. The removed spirit is then provided offerings to prevent it from being offended.|$|R
50|$|When {{products}} with GIs acquire {{a reputation of}} international magnitude, some other products may try to pass themselves off as the authentic GI products. This kind of competition is often seen as unfair, as it may discourage traditional producers as well as mislead consumers. Thus the European Union has pursued {{efforts to improve the}} protection of GI internationally. Inter alia, the European Union has established distinct legislation to protect geographical names in the fields of wines, <b>spirits,</b> <b>agricultural</b> products including beer. A register for protected geographical indications and denominations of origin relating to products in the field of agriculture including beer, but excluding mineral water, was established (DOOR). Another register was set up for wine region names, namely the E-Bacchus register. A register of the geographical indications for spirits and for any other products is still missing in the European Union and most other countries in the world. Aprivate database project (GEOPRODUCT directory) intends to close this gap. Accusations of 'unfair' competition should although be levelled with caution since the use of GIs sometimes comes from European immigrants who brought their traditional methods and skills with them.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the issue covered by the field of {{industrial}} property, it {{deals with the}} right to designation, especially with characteristics of legal regulation of labeling of products with regard to their geographical origin at the Slovak, communitarian and international levels. Individual objects of the industrial property {{may be the result of}} intellectual creative activity of its creator/creators (e. g. inventions, utility models, designs) or they are not the result of creative activity of a particular natural person and are considered as industrial property rights to designation. The group of rights to designation includes: business names, trademarks, designation of origin for products and geographical indications for products. The rights to designation, inter alia, shall ensure uniqueness and competitive advantage for entrepreneurs and easy identification on the market of goods and services for the consumers. The paper closely analyzes the harmonized legal regulation of designations of origin and geographical indications of <b>agricultural</b> products, foodstuffs, <b>spirit</b> drinks, and wines. At the example of Tokaj wine region, it demonstrates the importance of protected designations at the EU level, in case of which demonstrable geographical origin of the product with controlled product specification by authorized national bodies brings a guarantee of quality of this product for consumers and the competitive advantage during their commercial implementation for the entrepreneurs...|$|R
5000|$|The rites {{were based}} on a {{seasonal}} death-rebirth theme (common among <b>agricultural</b> cults) and <b>spirit</b> possession; the Osirian Mysteries paralleled the Dionysian, according to contemporary Greek and Egyptian observers. Spirit possession involved liberation from civilization's rules and constraints. It celebrated that which was outside civilized society and a return to primordial nature—which would later assume mystical overtones. It also involved escape from the socialized personality and ego into an ecstatic, deified state or the primal herd (sometimes both). In this sense Dionysus was the beast-god within, or the unconscious mind of modern psychology. Such activity has been interpreted as fertilizing, invigorating, cathartic, liberating and transformative, so {{it is not surprising that}} many devotees of Dionysus were those on the margins of society: women, slaves, outlaws and [...] "foreigners" [...] (non-citizens, in Greek democracy). All were equal in a cult that inverted their roles, similar to the Roman Saturnalia. Although the Greek Dionysian rites were associated with women, the cult officers' titles were of both genders—belying the claim that the cult was solely for women. The trance induction central to the cult involved not only chemognosis, but an [...] "invocation of spirit" [...] with the bullroarer and communal dancing to drum and pipe. The trances are described in familiar anthropological terms, with characteristic movements (such as the backward head flick found in all trance-inducing cults) found today in Afro-American Vodou and its counterparts. As in Vodou rites, certain rhythms were associated with the trance. Rhythms are also found preserved in Greek prose referring to the Dionysian rites (such as Euripides' The Bacchae). This collection of classical quotes describes rites in the Greek countryside in the mountains, to which processions were made on feast days: ...|$|R
40|$|In the Ming dynasty, Ming Taizu had {{restructured}} county {{society by}} the lijia system, {{in which the}} sacrificial organization lishe was incorporated to help maintain social morality and social order. This reform in Hongwu era had influenced Zezhou country in some aspects but the influence did not last. From mid-Ming times on, cunshe, symbolized by {{the cult of the}} spirits and the she temple, substituted the lishe as the basic community organization in the countryside again. At the same time, the gentry had become increasingly important in local society. To meet the challenges from commercialization and social mobility, the gentry tried lineage reconstruction in the countryside but they seem not to have been successful as they had desired. They also attempted to reform the organization and the function of cunshe to practice Confucian doctrines in the country. The gentry's compromise with the cunshe in time allowed the cunshe to improve its authority in social affairs. The gentry of Zezhou and their families, with great success in civil service examinations, became local heroes and saviors during the rebellious and chaotic Ming-Qing transition. In the mid-Qing, they declined service to the government and local society while cunshe became much more active and powerful in country life. Changes in fiscal and tax policies brought changes to local administrations as well. Cunshe, as a non-official system in the rural area, came to control more and more village affairs. In the last years of the Qing dynasty, cunshe had actually become a local self-government organization and was authorized by the county government in various degrees. The history of cunshe in Zezhou reveals the close relationship between the cult of she and social integration in the rural area. Cunshe there was both a religious and a territorial organization. Its architectural structure also provided a public space for the community. The long interaction among the state, gentry and cunshe in Zezhou gives a typical example of traditional administration in rural China. Religion and cult in a community worked alongside formal institutions of the state for the control of local populace. Zezhou, {{at the southern end of}} Taihang Mountain in the southeast of Shanxi province, has a long history of <b>agricultural</b> civilization. <b>Spirits</b> related to rain-praying were popularly worshipped in localities. When the North Song dynasty made its capital at Kaifeng, Zezhou became much nearer to the political center of the state than before. Official awarding of titles to the local spirits and regulating the sub-county administrative units were two main policies that the government had employed to control local society. These policies were effective in Zezhou. Some changes were obvious in the villages: the sacrificial offerings to the earth god in the village altar every spring and autumn were replaced by the offering to the rain spirits in the village shrine. Villages around the new shrines or temples were organized by this new cult in addition to sub-county level government arrangement. Cunshe (territorial sacrificial association) became the basic social organization outside the family in the countryside. The wars between nomadic and Han regimes in north China broke the lineages in Song times. The Jin and Yuan reigns that followed the Song relied on the cunshe to form the basis of its local administration. 杜正贞. 論文(哲學博士) [...] 香港中文大學, 2005. 參考文獻(p. 286 - 295). Adviser: Hung-lam Chu.
