5|$|The entire star is {{undergoing}} convection, whereby the energy generated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> is being transported {{toward the surface}} by the convective motion of plasma, rather than by transmission through radiation. This circulation redistributes any accumulation of helium that is generated through stellar nucleosynthesis <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> throughout the star. This process will allow the star {{to remain on the}} main sequence as a hydrogen fusing star proportionately longer than a star such as the Sun where helium steadily accumulates <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>core.</b> In combination with a lower rate of hydrogen consumption due to its low mass, the convection will allow Wolf 359 to remain a main-sequence star for about eight trillion years.|$|E
5|$|An {{active galaxy}} is a {{formation}} that emits {{a significant amount}} of its energy from a source other than its stars, dust and gas.

5|$|As atomic nuclei are fused in the core, they emit {{energy in}} the form of gamma rays. These photons {{interact}} with the surrounding plasma, adding to the thermal energy <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>core.</b> Stars on the main sequence convert hydrogen into helium, creating a slowly but steadily increasing proportion of helium in the core. Eventually the helium content becomes predominant, and energy production ceases <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>core.</b> Instead, for stars of more than 0.4 , fusion occurs in a slowly expanding shell around the degenerate helium core.|$|E

5|$|It {{is unclear}} whether triple-alpha helium fusion has started <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> of Eta Carinae A.

5|$|The {{total amount}} of energy that a star can {{generate}} through nuclear fusion of hydrogen {{is limited by the}} amount of hydrogen fuel that can be consumed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>core.</b> For a star in equilibrium, the energy generated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> must be at least equal to the energy radiated at the surface. Since the luminosity gives the amount of energy radiated per unit time, the total life span can be estimated, to first approximation, as the total energy produced divided by the star's luminosity.|$|E
5|$|As {{the name}} suggests, an {{elliptical}} galaxy has the cross-sectional {{shape of an}} ellipse. The stars move along random orbits with no preferred direction.

5|$|At present, {{nearly half}} the {{hydrogen}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> has been consumed, with {{the remainder of the}} atoms consisting primarily of helium. As the number of hydrogen atoms per unit mass decreases, so too does their energy output provided through nuclear fusion. This results in a decrease in pressure support, which causes the core to contract until the increased density and temperature bring the core pressure into equilibrium with the layers above. The higher temperature causes the remaining hydrogen to undergo fusion at a more rapid rate, thereby generating the energy needed to maintain the equilibrium.|$|E
