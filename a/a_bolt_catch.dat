2500|$|HK {{included}} several design {{features that are}} essential in modern military firearms. For example, the bolt locks back after the last round is spent (this can be deactivated), and at {{the front end of}} the trigger guard there is <b>a</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>catch</b> button. The cocking handle can be switched from either end, folds in, and unfolds from a spring so the shooter need not unfold it by hand [...] before firing. Another feature of it is that it doubles as the forward assist, which is used in the instance that the spent cartridge ejected but the next one did not properly extract and go into battery. In addition, the ejection port has a brass deflector to mitigate the amount of casings that may strike the face of left-handed operators. Instead of a dust cover which has the need to be flipped back up when the gun isn't in use, the bolt acts as the seal from dirt.|$|E
2500|$|The MAR, or the Micro Galil, is a reduced-size {{version of}} the Galil SAR (706mm stock {{extended}} / 465mm folded), weighing 2.98kg (6.57 pounds) empty. Compared to the original carbine, the MAR has a shortened barrel (210mm), receiver, piston, gas tube and foregrip. The firearm is fed from a 35-round steel magazine which can be clipped together to increase reload speed. The MAR has the same rate of fire (630-750 rounds/min) as other 5.56mm Galil models. An optional magazine adapter inserted inside the magazine well allows the use of standard 20- and 30-round M16 magazines. The lever safety and fire selector (located {{on both sides of}} the receiver) has four settings: [...] "S"—weapon is safe, [...] "A"—automatic fire, [...] "B"—3-round burst, [...] "R"—semi-automatic mode. The barrel has a multifunction muzzle device. The MAR is equipped with a folding tubular aluminum stock and a flip aperture sight with two settings: 0–300m and beyond 300 m. The MAR can also be equipped with a night vision device (attached through an adapter mounted to the left side of the receiver), a daytime optical sight (mounted via a receiver cover adapter), low-light sights with tritium illuminated dots, a vertical forward grip with integrated laser pointer, silencer and a nylon sling. Upon request, the weapon can be supplied with <b>a</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>catch,</b> plastic magazines weighing 0.164kg or an enlarged trigger guard for use with gloves.|$|E

5000|$|PMAG AR/M4 Gen M3: Improved PMAG {{made for}} use in AR-15 style rifles, as well as European-type STANAG 4179 {{magazine}} wells (HK416, M27 IAR, SA80, FN SCAR). Also has <b>a</b> redesigned <b>bolt</b> <b>catch</b> notch for increased <b>bolt</b> <b>catch</b> clearance, <b>an</b> over-travel stop on the spine to prevent over-insertion, and a new slimmer and easily disassembled floorplate. It is available in 10- (PMAG 10 AR/M4), 20- (PMAG 20 AR/M4), 30- (PMAG 30 AR/M4), and 40-round (PMAG 40 AR/M4) capacities.|$|R
25|$|The Tavor {{features}} <b>a</b> {{last round}} <b>bolt</b> <b>catch,</b> whereby the <b>bolt</b> holds open {{after the last}} round discharges. This is a request of modern armies, as it helps to allow soldiers to know when their magazine empties and to reduce reloading times during combat.|$|R
50|$|The MPX has a gas {{short stroke}} piston system {{in order to}} {{increase}} the accuracy of the weapon which operates in closed bolt. It is designed in this way to prevent water or dirt from entering the chamber and causing malfunctions as well as to use a silencer with greater ease. It features an ambidextrous selector switch for fully automatic (law enforcement/military models) and semi-automatic. It also features <b>an</b> ambidextrous <b>bolt</b> <b>catch,</b> and the weapons exterior appears to be a cross between an AR-15 and a Heckler & Koch MP5A3. The barrel is free-floating and is surrounded by Polymer/Steel Rail mounts.|$|R
5000|$|After {{discharging}} {{the last}} cartridge from the magazine, the bolt carrier and bolt are held back on <b>a</b> <b>bolt</b> <b>catch</b> that is released by pulling the cocking handle to the rear. The rifle has a hammer-type striking mechanism and a manual lever safety selector. The firing pin is a [...] "free-floating" [...] type and, as a result, some soft-primered ammunition had {{the reputation of}} causing a [...] "slam fire" [...] event. Thus, military-grade ammunition with primers confirmed to be properly seated is recommended for the Dragunov and its variants. This appears to have solved the [...] "slam fire" [...] issue. The rifle's receiver is machined to provide additional accuracy and torsional strength. The Dragunov's receiver bears a number of similarities to the AK action, such as the large dust cover, iron sights and lever safety selector, but these similarities are primarily cosmetic in nature. These cosmetic similarities can lead to mis-categorization of the Dragunov as an AK variant.|$|E

50|$|The SAF is a blowback-operated select-fire gun, firing from <b>a</b> closed <b>bolt.</b> It {{is based}} on the Swiss SIG SG 540 assault rifle which was {{produced}} under license in Chile in the 1980s. In general the design is a shortened version of the SIG 540 rifle, but the rifle's rotating bolt has been replaced with <b>a</b> simple blowback <b>bolt.</b> The SAF also has <b>a</b> <b>bolt</b> hold-open <b>catch</b> that engages after the final shot. Otherwise, the receiver, stock, fore-end, trigger/hammer assembly and floating firing pin design are from the SIG 540. The upper and lower receiver, as well as the trigger guard are steel, pistol grip and Handguards are all made from polymer. The ambidextrous safety/fire selector switch, as well as the interchangeability with SIG 552/553 handguards, is a feature found on the latest versions. Older versions used own handguards.|$|R
60|$|But Ismaquehs {{knew just}} when to stop. With {{a cry of}} rage he dropped, or rather threw, his fish, hoping it would strike the water and be lost. On the instant the eagle wheeled {{out of the way}} and bent his head sharply. I had seen him fold wings and drop before, and had held my breath at the speed. But {{dropping}} was of no use now, for the fish fell faster. Instead he swooped downward, adding to the weight of his fall the push of his strong wings, glancing down like <b>a</b> <b>bolt</b> to <b>catch</b> the fish ere it struck the water, and rising again in a great curve--up and away steadily, evenly as the king should fly, to his own little ones far away on the mountain.|$|R
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>bolt</b> hold-open device {{locks the}} bolt carrier {{assembly}} open after expending the last cartridge from {{the magazine and}} is released by lifting the <b>bolt</b> <b>catch</b> lever located {{on the left side}} of the receiver. Alternatively, a left-handed shooter may release the bolt by pulling the rubber-coated charging handle to rear a short distance.|$|R
5000|$|B.A.D. (Battery Assist Device) Lever: a metal lever {{device that}} {{attaches}} to the standard AR-15 <b>bolt</b> <b>catch</b> and circles under the rifle's lower receiver and into the trigger guard, allowing the right handed operation of the <b>bolt</b> <b>catch</b> with the trigger finger.|$|R
5000|$|The rifle is hammer-fired {{and has a}} {{fire control}} {{selector}} mechanism that is also the safety (lever in the [...] "S" [...] position—indicates the gun is safe, [...] "1"—semi-automatic fire, [...] "3"—3-round burst and [...] "20"—fully automatic fire). The SG 540 is fed from either 20 or 30-round staggered box magazines. After the last round is fired, a hold-open tab in the magazine engages the <b>bolt</b> <b>catch</b> that locks the bolt in its rear (open) position. <b>A</b> <b>bolt</b> release button {{is located on the}} left side of the receiver.|$|R
5000|$|He survives and {{is treated}} by Dr. Hibbert. While Marge is visiting {{him in the}} hospital, she hears voices {{chanting}} [...] "Bart sucks!" [...] over and over, eventually seeing an angry mob outside. Finally fed {{up with all the}} abuse poured onto Bart, she walks out to them and angrily scolds them for going too far, indicating the billboard labeling Springfield the [...] "Meanest City in America", and remarking that, more than ever, they deserved to be called that today. Feeling guilty, the entire town apologizes to Bart for hurting him and agrees to do the game over. After 78 tries (some flying into orbit, some stolen by Homer, one where Moe ran naked on the field, and even one in which the ball was disintegrated by <b>a</b> lightning <b>bolt),</b> Bart <b>catches</b> the ball, winning the game.|$|R
50|$|Another {{addition}} by IWI to {{the original}} Galil is the last round <b>bolt</b> <b>catch</b> (for variants of the ACE in 5.56×45mm NATO only). The bolt hold-open feature is a common request of military customers, to reduce reloading times during combat.|$|R
5000|$|The bolt {{assembly}} also contains the spring extractor, while a lever case ejector {{is located at}} the base of the feed tray. Spent casings are ejected downward. The weapon has a striker firing mechanism, a trigger assembly for fully automatic only fire and a cross-bolt safety (the [...] "safe" [...] setting disables the <b>bolt</b> <b>catch).</b>|$|R
50|$|The Ak 5C is the modernized {{version of}} the {{original}} Ak 5, following the trend of modular weapons. One {{of the most significant}} improvements is the MIL-STD-1913 rail system to which a variety of different optics, lights and sights can be mounted, such as telescopic sights and image intensifiers. The double gas position, iron sights and <b>bolt</b> <b>catch</b> of the original Ak 5 rifle family were discarded.|$|R
5000|$|The {{weapon is}} hammer-fired {{and has a}} trigger {{mechanism}} with a fire mode selector, whose lever (installed {{on the left side}} of the receiver, above the pistol grip) has three settings: [...] "0"—weapon is safe, [...] "1"—semi-automatic mode and [...] "20"—fully automatic fire. The [...] "safe" [...] setting disables the trigger and the bolt in the forward position (by sliding the <b>bolt</b> <b>catch</b> lever upwards).|$|R
50|$|The MP7 {{allows a}} {{conventional}} 20-round, 30-round or 40-round box magazine to be fitted within the pistol grip (the 20-round magazine being comparable {{in size to}} a 15-round 9×19mm magazine, while the 40-round magazine compares to a 30-round 9×19mm magazine). It features an ambidextrous fire selector, <b>bolt</b> <b>catch</b> lever and magazine release. It has an extendable stock and a folding front grip; it can be fired either one-handed or two-handed. It is compact and light, due {{to the use of}} polymers in its construction.|$|R
5000|$|The weapon {{incorporates}} a manual forward assist {{that can be}} used to positively close the bolt, similar to the one used on the American M16A1 rifle, and a side-folding heavy-gauge wire carrying handle which resembles that of the FN FAL. It also has a [...] "hold-open" [...] <b>bolt</b> <b>catch</b> which holds the bolt open after the last round in the magazine has been fired (the bolt release button is just above the magazine release) and has a spring-loaded dust cover that seals the ejection port from debris.|$|R
50|$|The {{weapon is}} fed from a {{detachable}} box magazine with a 30-round cartridge capacity and made from a lightweight aluminium alloy. When the last round from the magazine is fired, the bolt will remain locked open on the <b>bolt</b> <b>catch,</b> activated by the magazine's follower. The magazine release tab {{is located at the}} base of the receiver on the left side, behind the magazine well. The <b>bolt</b> carrier has <b>a</b> built-in guide rail used for reloading from 10-round stripper clips (from the SKS rifle). Despite their similarity, vz. 58 magazines are not interchangeable with those of the Kalashnikov-pattern weapons.|$|R
40|$|Purpose. Studying of {{influence}} of {{value of a}} backlash on a state of stress of <b>a</b> <b>bolt</b> of <b>a</b> single-shear <b>bolt</b> joint in <b>a</b> "shearing" zone. Methodology. Used a method of final elements and the 3 D contact model {{as much as possible}} approached to real geometry and conditions of load application. Findings. The <b>bolt</b> of <b>a</b> single-shear <b>bolt</b> joint always "works" not only on a shear, and on a bending. Contact interaction of a lateral surface of <b>a</b> <b>bolt</b> with edges of apertures calls in zones of contacts in <b>a</b> <b>bolt</b> additional negative axial stresses of peak character. Even at a cycle with a constant sign on the loading in <b>a</b> <b>bolt</b> at <b>a</b> surface there can be a zone with cyclically sign-variable axial stresses, and they are more destructive, than with a constant sign. It changes character of fatigue failure of <b>a</b> <b>bolt.</b> Originality. The reason of change of character of fatigue failure of <b>a</b> <b>bolt</b> is found out: separation instead of a shear. ????: ???????? ??????? ???????? ?????? ?? ??????????? ????????? ????? ???????????? ????????? ?????????? ? ????

5000|$|During {{the design}} phase, {{emphasis}} {{was placed on}} safety when operating the weapon. It is impossible to discharge the firearm in its folded position or when the stock is not fully deployed. The PP-90 also has a manual safety and fire selector. The safety toggle, installed {{on the left side of}} the receiver housing, has two settings: a top “P” position - indicating the weapon is safe and the bottom “O” setting - automatic fire. The [...] "safe" [...] setting ensures the <b>bolt</b> <b>catch</b> is disabled mechanically. The weapon’s internal safety mechanism features a drop safety that prevents the weapon from firing when dropped with a loaded chamber.|$|R
40|$|<b>A</b> <b>bolt</b> tension monitor (BTM) {{which uses}} ultrasonics and a pulsed {{phase locked loop}} circuit to measure load-induced {{acoustic}} phase shifts which are independent of friction is described. The BTM {{makes it possible to}} measure the load in <b>a</b> <b>bolt</b> that was tightened at some time in the past. This capability to recertify a load after-the-fact will help to insure the integrity of <b>a</b> <b>bolted</b> joint...|$|R
50|$|While bolts {{are commonplace}} in rock and gym {{climbing}} {{there is no}} universal vocabulary to describe them. Generally, <b>a</b> <b>bolt</b> hanger or <b>a</b> fixed hanger {{is a combination of}} <b>a</b> fixed <b>bolt</b> and <b>a</b> specialized stainless steel hanger designed to accept a carabiner, whereas in certain regions <b>a</b> <b>bolt</b> runner or <b>a</b> carrot describes <b>a</b> hangerless <b>bolt</b> (where the climber must provide their own hanger bracket and sometimes lock nut). <b>A</b> ring <b>bolt</b> has <b>a</b> loop on one end so it presents as a U-shape embedded in the wall.|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>bolt</b> can {{function}} as a clevis pin, but <b>a</b> <b>bolt</b> {{is not intended to}} take the lateral stress that a clevis pin must handle. Normal bolts are manufactured to handle tension loads, whereas clevis pins and bolts are designed to withstand shearing forces.|$|R
50|$|APC uses {{straight}} blowback function. It fires {{from the}} closed <b>bolt</b> and features <b>a</b> <b>bolt</b> lock-back mechanism thus facilitating quick reloads. This overcomes {{one of the}} major issues with the H&K MP5 family of weapons, which do not have <b>a</b> <b>bolt</b> lock-back mechanism (though H&K's UMP series does).|$|R

5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>bolt</b> is <b>a</b> unit of {{measurement}} used as an industry standard {{for a variety of}} materials from wood to canvas, typically materials stored in a roll. Length will vary according to the type of material measured. The length is usually either 40 or 100 yards, but varies depending on the fabric being referred to, for example, <b>a</b> <b>bolt</b> of canvas is traditionally 39 yards. The width of <b>a</b> <b>bolt</b> is usually 45 or 60 inches, [...] but widths may include 35 - 36”, 39”, 41”, 44 - 45”, 50”, 52 - 54", 58 - 60” and 66”, 72", 96", and 108".|$|R
5000|$|There is no universally {{accepted}} {{distinction between a}} screw and <b>a</b> <b>bolt.</b> <b>A</b> simple distinction that is often true, although not always, is that <b>a</b> <b>bolt</b> passes through <b>a</b> substrate and takes a nut on the other side, whereas a screw takes no nut because it threads directly into the substrate (a screw screws into something, <b>a</b> <b>bolt</b> bolts several things together). So, as a general rule, when buying a packet of [...] "screws" [...] you would not expect nuts to be included, but bolts are often sold with matching nuts. Part of the confusion over this is likely due to regional or dialectical differences. Machinery's Handbook describes the distinction as follows: ...|$|R
30|$|The {{safety and}} {{serviceability}} of timber structures are frequently {{governed by the}} performance of joints. <b>Bolted</b> joints are <b>a</b> very commonly used form of joints and are effective {{from the viewpoint of}} the load–slip characteristics when subjected to a lateral force. The shear strength of <b>a</b> <b>bolted</b> joint is affected by various factors. Some of the factors affecting the shear strength of <b>a</b> <b>bolted</b> joint are classified into four categories in this paper: the material characteristics, geometrical factors, assembly conditions for the bolted joint, and factors that act during its service. This paper reviews the effects of these factors on the shear strength of <b>a</b> <b>bolted</b> joint. Numerous experimental studies were performed on the shear strength of <b>a</b> <b>bolted</b> joint. The effects of these factors on the shear strength varied according to the kind of shear strength and loading direction to the grain. In addition to the experimental investigations, analytical investigations to estimate the shear strength of <b>a</b> <b>bolted</b> joint are also discussed in this paper. Estimations of the yield strengths of bolted joints have been performed by numerous researchers; and in recent years, there has been an increase in studies to predict the load at failure.|$|R
