5|$|<b>Afforestation</b> {{projects}} have been undertaken to prevent groundwater pollution, secure drinking water, sequester CO2, increase biodiversity, create an attractive countryside, provide easy access to nature and offer outdoor activities to the public. In 2000 the first project, the New Forests of Aarhus, was completed which aimed to double the forest cover in the municipality and in 2009 another phase was announced to double forest cover once more before the year 2030. The <b>afforestation</b> plans were realised as a local project in collaboration with private landowners, under a larger national agenda. Other projects to expand natural habitats include a rewilding effort in Geding-Kasted Bog and continuous monitoring of the four Natura 2000 areas in the municipality.|$|E

40|$|The {{process of}} forest {{fragmentation}} {{has been observed}} in many countries, where plant species had adapt to different habitats, such as for example manor parks and rural plantings. A number of scientists have studied the parks as sites where waning environments and landscapes find their shelter. In 2011 – 2012, research was undertaken on diversity of vegetation in <b>afforestations</b> of parks, rural plantings and oak-hornbeam forests in Sandomierz Basin. In order to compare the means obtained univariate analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) was used with juxtaposing divided by {{each of the two}} criteria: size (the small, and large parks) and conservation(cultivated parks and nonclutivated parks). Tukey’s test was used to examine the significance of differences between respective groups. Analyses were with STATISTICA 9. 1. software. Plants classified as forest species, grassland species and those of synanthropic communities were observed in all the <b>afforestations.</b> The parks with high wooded and not mowed areas and oak-hornbeam forests were more forest-like than other types of <b>afforestations</b> studied...|$|R
40|$|In a chronosequence of <b>afforestations</b> {{adjacent}} to ancient forest, relations between herbaceous forest vegetation and possible explanatory variables, such as soil characteristics, land-use history variables and relative insolation {{on the forest}} floor, were studied using linear models on species groups and a direct gradient analysis (CCA). An explorative correlation analysis indicated that the moisture, carbon, total nitrogen and phosphorus contents of the soil, were correlated with forest age. Although soil pH was not correlated with forest age, its variability was greater in ancient forest and 19 th century <b>afforestations</b> than in recently afforested parcels. The linear models indicated that soil pH positively influenced the diversity and cover of both slow-colonizing and fast-colonizing woodland species. P enrichment, in combination with a high relative insolation, stimulated Urtica dioica in recent <b>afforestations.</b> Deep shadow {{on the forest floor}} suppressed light-demanding species, such as U. dioica, and indirectly favored woodland species. The multivariate analysis confirmed that floristic diversity was best accounted for by the variables plant-available P, pH (KCl), nitrate (negatively correlated with insolation) and forest age. The discussion focuses on the origin of the observed variability in soil characteristics, natural or anthropogenic, and the impact on vegetation succession. It is concluded that most woodland species can colonize recently afforested farmland parcels in Muizen forest, as soil pH is not a limiting factor. However, P. eutrophication can have an indirect negative effect, increasing competitive exclusion by U. dioica. Plantation of an understorey can suppress U. dioica and stimulate colonization of shade-tolerant woodland species in afforested farmland. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V.

5|$|Construction on the Commonwealth nursery and Westbourne Woods {{arboretum}} {{was started}} in 1914, and a temporary camp was built near the brickworks to accommodate the workers. Thomas Charles Weston was Officer-in-Charge (<b>Afforestation</b> Branch) in the years 1913 to 1926, and later became Director of City Planting and the Superintendent of Parks and Gardens. Weston was responsible for testing and selecting plant species at the arboretum for their suitability to Canberra's environment; from 1913 through to 1924 Weston oversaw the propagation {{of more than two}} million trees which were then planted in the Canberra area. Most of the original Westbourne Woods arboretum is now leased to the Royal Canberra Golf Club, with the remainder forming part of Weston Park. The Yarralumla nursery is still active, albeit on a smaller scale and functioning as a retail nursery selling both wholesale and direct to the public.|$|E

40|$|There {{is ample}} {{evidence}} that continuously existing forests and <b>afforestations</b> on previously agricultural land differ with regard to ecosystem functions and services such as carbon sequestration, nutrient cycling and biodiversity. However, no studies have so far been conducted on possible long-term (. 100 years) impacts on tree growth caused by differences in the ecological continuity of forest stands. In the present study we analysed the variation in tree-ring width of sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.) trees (mean age 115 – 136 years) due to different land-use histories (continuously existing forests, <b>afforestations</b> both on arable land and on heathland). We also analysed the relation of growth patterns to soil nutrient stores and to climatic parameters (temperature, precipitation). Tree rings formed between 1896 and 2005 were widest in trees afforested on arable land.

5|$|The {{main part}} of Rewrites story {{takes place in the}} fictional city of Kazamatsuri in Japan, where treeplanting and <b>afforestation</b> have caused the city to become {{overgrown}} with trees and vegetation. The protagonist Kotarou and his friends in the occult research society attend a high school in Kazamatsuri, and the characters also spend time in the society's clubroom. Outside of the school, frequented locations include the forest around Kazamatsuri and Kotarou's house. Throughout the story, Kotarou encounters an alternate dimension of Kazamatsuri where everything is silent and the sky is gray. There are many entrances to this dimension throughout the city. In this secret world developed by Gaia, a sustainable environment exists to support life. When on the Moon, a hill where daisies grow is prominently shown amid a ruined Kazamatsuri where the night is eternal. This hill appears again later on Earth in the forest of Kazamatsuri.|$|E

We used tree-ring series from dominant, codominant, and overtopped trees to study the effects of thinning intensity on basal area increments (BAI) and climate sensitivity. We performed the study in 40 - 50 year old <b>afforestations</b> placed on windward (wet) and leeward (dry) slopes on Tenerife, Canary Islands. Three replicated blocks of control, light thinning, and heavy thinning stands were set on each slope in 1988, and cores were extracted in 2007. Radial growth patterns showed that heavy thinning induced growth release and increased BAI, mainly on dominant and codominant trees, whereas light thinning effects were negligible. Likewise, thinning impacts were more intense on windward. Regarding to the climate-growth relationships, temperature sensitivity was hardly affected by thinning on leeward, where climate control was stronger. However, on windward thinning enhanced the influence of summer temperatures. Upper crown classes were overall more sensitive, but overtopped trees responded better in summer, the most critical season. No significant results were noted with rainfall. Thinning intensity greatly influence growth on Canary pine <b>afforestations,</b> but individual responses are highly dependent on crown classes. In addition, the contrasting effects between slopes point out that thinning may be less effective to modify growth conditions on leeward slopes, especially if it is not intense. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{deal with}} the problem of the re-naturalization of <b>afforestations</b> of Black pine in the Apennines (Central Italy). Gap-cutting of two {{different}} sizes (the gap diameter/stand height ratios were respectively 0. 75 and 1. 0) on age classes stands (respectively 50 and 90 years old) have been carried out. The results of the dynamics of the tree regeneration established in the gaps 7 years after the beginning of the experiment are given. The Black pine represents the best regenerated tree species and its presence is increasing. Some broadleaves, Pubescent oak (Quercus pubescens Willd.) and Holm oak (Quercus ilex L.) particularly, and Hop-hornbeam (Ostrya carpinifolia Scop.) and Manna-ash (Fraxinus ornus L.) on a subordinate way, are also present in the gaps. These results confirm that the gap-cutting system represents an effective instrument for the natural regeneration priming and a low impact environmental treatment which is particularly fit for the re-naturalization of the conifers&# 8217; monocultures.

40|$|I {{made use}} of the known dates of {{reclamation}} (and of <b>afforestations)</b> in the IJsselmeerpolders in The Netherlands to assess evolutionary adaptation in Cepaea nemoralis. At 12 localities (three in each polder), I sampled a total of 4390 adult individuals in paired open and shaded habitats, on average 233 m apart, and scored these for genetic shell colour polymorphisms. The results show (highly) significant differentiation at most localities, although the genes involved differed per locality. Overall, though, populations in shaded habitats had evolved towards darker shells than those in adjacent open habitats, whereas a 'Cain & Sheppard' diagram (proportion yellow shells plotted against ‘effectively unbanded’ shells) failed to reveal a clear pattern. This might suggest that thermal selection {{is more important than}} visual selection in generating this pattern. Trait differentiation, regardless of whether they were plotted against polder age or habitat age, showed a linear increase of differentiation with time, corresponding to a mean rate of trait evolution of 15 – 31 kilodarwin.
