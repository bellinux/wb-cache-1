25|$|The success led Irving Thalberg, head of {{production}} at MGM, to cast {{her in a}} similar role in The Temptress (1926), based on another Ibáñez novel. After only one film, she was given top billing, playing opposite Antonio Moreno. Her mentor Stiller, who had persuaded her to take the part, was assigned to direct. For both Garbo (who {{did not want to}} play another vamp and did not like the script any more than she did the first one) and Stiller, The Temptress was a harrowing experience. Stiller, who spoke little English, had difficulty adapting to the studio system and did not get on with Moreno, was fired by Thalberg and replaced by Fred Niblo. Reshooting The Temptress was expensive <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> became one of the top-grossing films of the 1926–27 season, it was the only Garbo film of the period to lose money. However, Garbo received rave reviews and MGM had a new star.|$|E

500|$|Chapman {{began the}} 1932 season in good form and {{appeared}} fitter {{than he had}} for many seasons. There were further calls in the press for him to captain England. Jardine's captaincy in 1931 left critics unimpressed and C. Stewart Caine, the editor of Wisden, wrote that [...] "the impression appears to be widely entertained that Chapman, were he in [...] form, would again be given charge of the [...] team." [...] Christopher Douglas believes {{that the difference between}} Jardine and Chapman in captaincy style made it harder for the press to accept Jardine. He writes: [...] "Chapman's was just the kind of daredevil approach that is remembered with affection <b>and,</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> was barely a year since he had lost the leadership, his reign was being regarded through rose-coloured specs." [...] However, {{it is unlikely that the}} selectors ever considered returning to him.

500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the First World War, the Washington Naval Treaty was drawn up in 1922 in an effort to stop an arms race developing between Britain, Japan, France, Italy and the United States. This treaty limited the number of ships each nation was allowed to build and capped the tonnage of all capital ships at 35,000 tons. These restrictions were extended in 1930 through the Treaty of London, however, by the mid-1930s Japan and Italy had withdrawn from both of these treaties and the British became concerned about a lack of modern battleships within their navy. As a result, the Admiralty ordered {{the construction of a new}} battleship class: the King George V class.
