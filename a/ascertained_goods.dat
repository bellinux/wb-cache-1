40|$|Rules in English law {{regarding}} {{transfer of}} rights {{with respect to}} land and movables can generally fit into {{the framework of the}} abstract system. As a default rule throughout English property law, a separate stage of conveyance is necessary to complete the transfer of title, although in cases of unconditional sale of <b>ascertained</b> <b>goods,</b> it is possible to transfer title by the transferor’s intent alone. A study of the Sale of Goods Acts and detinue demonstrates that the contract of sale itself has never been a means of conveyance throughout English legal history. No matter whether a conveyance is made by solo consensu or by additional means, a separate intent to convey remains distinct from the intent to bargain. So long as the conveyance is valid according to its own rules, invalidating factors in the underlying basis of that conveyance in principle do not infect the validity of the conveyance itself. Revesting of title by rescinding the contract of sale induced by fraudulent misrepresentation is an exception, but the underlying rationale in those cases is flawed. From a normative perspective, the alleged ‘unfairness’ to the transferor under extreme circumstances is not self-evident. Arguments such as ‘initial impaired consent subtraction’ or ‘assumption of insolvency risk plus swollen assets’ might serve as possible ways to determine such ‘unfairness’. Nonetheless, these arguments remain problematic if employed to justify the need for causality. A unique characteristic of English law is that in certain impaired consent transfer cases, although title transferred cannot revest at law, equity may grant a right under a constructive trust with numerous proprietary attributes. However, this is nevertheless consistent with the operation of the English abstract system, for such an equitable interest acquired by the transferor, unlike what he could acquire under a causal system, is by its nature not a right in rem. With these observations, English law could provide at least three lessons for the ongoing debate in Chinese academia about whether Chinese law should adopt the principles of separation and abstraction.

Design/methodology/approach: The composite materials were manufactured by squeeze casting of porous ceramic preforms characterized by the open porosities of 90 %, 80 %, 70 % and 60 % with the liquid EN AC- 44200 aluminum alloy. The composite materials containing 10 vol. %, 20 vol. %, 30 vol. % and 40 vol. % were manufactured and characterized by the homogeneous distribution of alumina particles in the matrix. On the base of microscopic investigations there was <b>ascertained</b> <b>good</b> bonding at the interface matrix/strengthening particles. Findings: Manufacturing of porous ceramic preforms from alumina powders characterized by the desired open porosity was elaborated. After squeeze casting with liquid EN AC- 44200 alloy there was noticed considerable increase of physical and mechanical properties: hardness HB increased from 82 HB for unreinforced alloy to 150 HB for material containing 40 vol. % of particles. There was noticed increase of tensile strength, bending strength and compression strength, although what is typical for composite materials, decrease of impact strength. Research limitations/implications: There was noticed small rest porosity with decreasing porosity of the ceramic preforms. Further investigations on porosity removal basing on modification of production parameters are forseen. Practical implications: Reinforcing of EN AC- 44200 aluminum alloy with ceramic particles is effective taking into account increase of hardness and strength (tensile, bending, compression), although the relatively low impact strength can be restriction for the applications of these materials as the elements subjected to dynamic loads. Originality/value: Manufactured materials can be applied as elements subjected to static loads and the relatively large specific strength allow to diminish the weight of elements applied in the construction of means of transportation...|$|R

The test used were real-world tests that anyone, {{with or without}} access to a laboratory, can perform. The design of the real-world tests is important for <b>ascertaining</b> <b>good</b> results. Thought should go into how to perform the tests safely while still eliminating as many variables as possible. The emissions at idle improved by reducing the carbon monoxide percentage from 4 - 6 % to 2 - 3 %. The hydrocarbon levels were reduced from 800 - 1000 ppm to 500 - 600 ppm. The results of the emissions test were unclear at cruise. The performance data showed that the vehicle had a slower acceleration after the refurbishing. The time to go from stopped to 100 feet in first gear was 5. 46 s before refurbishing, and 6. 48 s after refurbishing. It {{is possible that the}} vehicle was running lean at wide-open throttle after refurbishing. The fuel economy improved with the refurbished carburetor. The initial fuel economy was 10. 7 mpg and the final fuel economy was 15. 2 mpg. Once the results from the tests are collected, they need to be scrutinized to see if they are plausible using empirical data. Even with extreme care it is difficult to get precise measurements using real-world tests. The emissions data at cruise was not consistent with idle and could not be used. The fuel economy tests and emissions tests at idle show that the engine was running less fuel rich after refurbishing. by Jacklyn Holmes. Thesis (S. B.)

For a successful implementation, knowledge about students' attitudes and beliefs about men, women, and gender is crucial. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare attitudes to gender and gender stereotyping among Dutch and Swedish male and female medical students. Methods In this cross-sectional study, we measured the attitudes and assumptions about gender among 1096 first year medical students (616 Dutch and 480 Swedish) with the validated Nijmegen Gender Awareness in Medicine Scale (N-GAMS). The response rate was 94 % in the Netherlands and 93 % in Sweden. Univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the scores between Dutch and Swedish male and female students. Linear regressions were used to analyze the importance of the background variables. Results There were significant differences in attitudes to gender between Dutch and Swedish students. The Swedish students expressed less stereotypical thinking about patients and doctors and the Dutch were more sensitive to gender differences. The students' sex mattered for gender stereotyping, with male students in both countries agreeing more with stereotypical statements. Students' age, father's birth country and mother's education level had some impact on the outcome. Conclusions There are differences between cultures as well as between men and women in gender awareness that need to be considered when implementing gender in medical education. This study suggests that to arouse the students' interest in gender issues and make them aware of the significance of gender in medical work, the examples used in discussions need to be relevant and challenging in the context of the specific country. Due to different levels of knowledge and different attitudes within the student population it is important to create a climate for dialogue where students feel permitted to disclose their ideas and attitudes in order to become aware of what these are as well as their possible consequences on interaction and decision-making in medical work. </p...|$|R

The Gobangsan Formation revealed a stable secondary magnetization component with unblocking temperatures of 500 – 580 °C and 650 °C from two sites, while the other sites possessed only a present day viscous remanence. The secondary component resides in magnetite and hematite. The site-mean directions of the two sites before tilt correction (D = 355.9 °, I = 50.2 ° with α 95 = 4.3 ° and D = 355.7 °, I = 53.3 ° with α 95 = 6.1 °) suggest that the remagnetization occurred after Early Cretaceous.

The devices used to record pressure profiles, in an ambulatory situation, are periodically activated, either automatically or by the patient himself. They are portable blood pressure recorders connected to a conventional inflatable arm cuff. The arterial blood pressure thus measured may be quite different from that measured by a physician.

A new multilevel construction is presented next that maps binary sequences to permutation sequences, creating new mappings for which the sum of Hamming distances are greater than previous known mappings. It also proved that for certain lengths of sequences, the new construction can attain our new upper bound on the sum of Hamming distances.

The organ-specific and location-specific time-activity curves (TAC) of the different heart regions (regions with normal blood circulation and with disturbed blood circulation) are helpful for the diagnosis of heart diseases. A problem of the derivation of the TACs is that the dSPECT images have a poor spatial and temporal resolution and the data is distorted because of noise effects, partial volume effects and scatter artifacts.

It is true that Margery would not have been very likely {{to fall in love with}} a young Indian, had one come in her way of a suitable age and character; for her American notions on the subject of color might have interposed difficulties; but, apart from the tender sentiments, she could see good and bad qualities in one of the aborigines, as well as in a white man.

Despite being simple to measure and acceptably reliable, it is evident that RE is a complex, multifactorial concept that reflects the integrated composite of a variety of metabolic, cardiorespiratory, biomechanical and neuromuscular characteristics that are unique to the individual. Metabolic efficiency refers to the utilization of available energy to facilitate optimal performance, whereas cardiopulmonary efficiency refers to a reduced work output for the processes related to oxygen transport and utilization. Biomechanical and neuromuscular characteristics refer to the interaction between the neural and musculoskeletal systems and their ability to convert power output into translocation and therefore performance. Of the numerous metabolic, cardiopulmonary, biomechanical and neuromuscular characteristics contributing to RE, many of these are able to adapt through training or other interventions resulting in improved RE.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{application}} of New Institutional Economics (NIE) theoretical assumptions {{and the way they}} relate to value chain governance and are moderated by traceability and information technology. Through literature review, NIE assumptions are examined by comparing how they are partially mitigated by traceability. The effect of these mitigations is realised in the readjustment of value chain governance typologies to suit lean and more competitive and visible value chains. The findings are {{based on the fact that}} information asymmetry, bounded rationality and behavioural uncertainty have given rise to incomplete contracts, especially in the agri-food sectors of most developing economies. Supply chain actors in this sector have the constant burden of assurance in <b>ascertaining</b> that credence <b>goods</b> remain authentically safe. The moderating effect of traceability is therefore proposed to reduce these uncertainties and is as such a form of assurance to promote both a holistic approach in compliance with standards and a seamless mechanism for product and process integration. However, this moderating effect, despite being novel in the value chain governance discourse, needs to be empirically ascertained. The novelty of this paper is based on the agricultural development agenda of developing economies in the light of the discourse on market-oriented reforms, following multilateral trade liberalisation and especially structural adjustment programmes in developing countries. The consequent increase in world market integration has led to the promotion of value chain strategies and reconsideration of how food is governed in these markets...|$|R
40|$|Designers of data-visualisation tools think {{deeply about}} their designs, and {{constantly}} question their own judgements and design decisions. They make these judgements to ascertain {{how to improve}} their ideas, such to make something suitable and fit-forpurpose. But self-reflection is often difficult, especially learners often {{find it difficult to}} critically reflect upon their own work. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} guide learners to perform appropriate critical reflections of their work, and develop skills to make better judgements. There are many visualisation computer tools and programming libraries that help users create visualisation systems, however, there are few tools or techniques to help them systematically critique or evaluate their creations, to <b>ascertain</b> what is <b>good</b> or what is bad in their designs. Learners who wish to create data-visualisation tools are missing structures and guidelines that will aid them critique their visualisations. Such critical analysis could be achieved by creating an appropriate computing tool and using metrics and heuristics to perform the judgement, or by human judgement helped by a written guide. Subsequently, this research explores structures to help humans perform better critical evaluations. First, the dissertation uses a traditional research methodology to investigate metrics in visualisation, to explore related work and investigate how metrics are used in computers to perform judgements. We design a framework that describes how and where metrics are used in the visualisation design process. Second, the focus turns to investigate how humans think and make critical judgement on designs, especially visualisation designs. We undertake an observational study where participants critique a range of objects and designs. An in-depth analysis of this observation-study is performed; through analysis and markup of this data, the work is analysed, and themes are extracted. We used a thematic analysis approach to extract these categories. We use these categories to develop our critical analysis system. Third, we followed an iterative approach to engineer our critical-evaluation system. The output system is the Critical Design Sheet that was created after much refinement and adaption by holding several think-aloud sessions to detect design problems and refine to an effective model. Fourth, an evaluation process is performed to evaluate the usability of the Critical Design Sheet with users. Testing of the reliability and earnability of the tool was achieved by the analysis of user usage data over two different cohorts of students (PhD’s and undergraduate). Fifth, an online implementation of the Critical Design Sheet was developed, which was briefly evaluated to discover if participants were satisfied with the computer version of the critical analysis system. These five parts represent the five contributions of the dissertation, respectively: the metric framework, critical thinking workshop and its analysis, the design of the Critical Design Sheet, the evaluation of the method, and finally the prototype online system. In conclusion, this dissertation provides learners and practitioners with a technique (the CDS) that has been proven to help students successfully critique their visual designs and make decision on their creations. The CDS works by breaking down the visual design into individual categories making it easier for practitioners to critique their work...|$|R
