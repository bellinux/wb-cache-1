5|$|At {{approximately}} 8:00pm on 19 December 2010, Reardon {{returned home}} from a weekend visit to Sheffield to find Yeates absent from their flat on Canynge Road, Clifton. Reardon {{had been trying to}} contact her by phone and text, but without success. While awaiting Yeates' return, Reardon called her again, but her mobile phone rang from a pocket of her coat, which was still in the flat. He found that her purse <b>and</b> <b>keys</b> were also at the flat, and that their cat appeared to have been neglected. Shortly after half past midnight, Reardon contacted the police and Yeates' parents to report her missing.|$|E

The dog had not previously shown any aggression towards him--no explanation for this is given, but implications go that the dog's programming has somehow been reversed, though that was never Keys's intention, or that Carruthers has a similarity to the dog's original owner whom the dog hates now. To save his employer's life, Keys is forced to shoot and kill the dog, and the film ends {{with the image of}} the dog's body lying {{in the center of the}} training enclosure while Julie weeps over his dead body.|$|E

5|$|The Papal Tiara or triregnum is the three-tiered crown {{used by the}} Pope as a {{sovereign}} power. It is first found as an independent emblem in the 13th century, though at that time with only one coronet. In the 15th century, the tiara was combined with the keys above the papal shield. The tiara <b>and</b> <b>keys</b> together within a shield form the arms of Vatican City. In heraldry, the white tiara is depicted with a bulbous shape and with two attached red strips called lappets or infulae. The coat of arms of Pope Benedict XVI sparked controversy by displaying a mitre and pallium instead of the customary tiara.|$|E
5|$|The second {{version of}} this cantata for a {{performance}} in Leipzig adds two recorders, which double viola I and II an octave higher. John Eliot Gardiner compares the effect to a four-foot stop on a pipe organ. The cantata begins in G minor in the Weimar version, in A minor in the Leipzig version. In the following table of the movements, the scoring <b>and</b> <b>keys</b> follow the Neue Bach-Ausgabe for the Leipzig version. The time signatures are taken from the book on all cantatas by the Bach scholar Alfred Dürr, using the symbol for common time (4/4). The continuo, played throughout, is not shown.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} table of the movements, the scoring <b>and</b> <b>keys</b> follow the Neue Bach-Ausgabe for the version performed in 1724, which is in B minor, uses oboes d'amore in the first movement and brass playing colla parte with {{the voices in the}} last movement, a choir of cornett (Ct) and three trombones (Tb) (or trumpets (Tr)). According to the Bach scholar Alfred Dürr, the audition version of 1723 had no reinforcement by brass, matching the scoring of the other audition piece. The originally composed version, which was not performed until 1728, was in C minor, had oboes in the opening movement and no brass. The time signatures are taken from the book on all cantatas by the Bach scholar Alfred Dürr, using the symbol for common time (4/4). The continuo, played throughout, is not shown.|$|E

40|$|<b>Key</b> <b>and</b> foreign <b>key</b> {{constraints}} {{are useful}} for XML [5] data in semantic specification, query optimization and more importantly, for information preservation in data exchange. Several XML proposals, e. g., XML Schema [28] and XML Data [21], support <b>key</b> <b>and</b> foreign <b>key</b> specifications. These constraints, however, may not be finitely satisfiable in the XML context. More specifically, given a DTD D and a finite set Σ of <b>key</b> <b>and</b> foreign <b>key</b> constraints, there may not exist any finite XML documents that both conform to D and satisfy Σ. This paper investigates finite satisfiability problems associated with <b>key</b> <b>and</b> foreign <b>key</b> constraints for XML. We show that DTDs impose a class of cardinality constraints on XML documents, and these cardinality constraints interact with <b>keys</b> <b>and</b> foreign <b>keys.</b> We investigate the interaction and in particular, establish complexity results {{for the analysis of}} finite satisfiability of <b>keys</b> <b>and</b> foreign <b>keys</b> defined in two constraint languages.

As {{the second wave}} landed, Major Siad arrived at the embassy gate accompanied by two truckloads of soldiers and held a grenade {{in one hand and}} a radio in the other. His request to speak with the ambassador was granted. Major Siad demanded that the evacuation cease immediately because the Somali government had not granted the US permission to carry out such a military operation. He claimed that he would radio soldiers to shoot down the helicopters if the operation continued. The second and third waves were able to depart without incident as the ambassador negotiated with the Major, who finally agreed to settle the matter for several thousand dollars in cash <b>and</b> <b>keys</b> to the ambassador's armored car. Ambassador Bishop remained engaged in conversation with the Major until he reached the helicopter landing zone to depart with the final wave to prevent the Major from reneging on the deal. The final wave departed the embassy at 1:49 and landed on Guam at 2:23; twenty minutes later, Ambassador Bishop declared the evacuation complete.|$|E

Several of these 'mysria' contain {{cupboards}} and other conveniences; they have doors which can be locked, <b>and</b> <b>keys</b> for their occupiers.

It often happens that a man can be in his cabin without others on board realizing it, {{and they do not}} see him until the vessel has arrived in some port. The sailors also have their children in such cabins; and (in some parts of the ship) they sew garden herbs, vegetables, and ginger in wooden tubs. The Commander of such a vessel is a great Emir; when he lands, the archers and the Ethiops (i.e. black slaves, yet in China these men-at-arms would have most likely been Malays) march before him bearing javelins and swords, with drums beating and trumpets blowing. When he arrives at the guesthouse where he is to stay, they set up their lances {{on each side of the}} gate, and mount guard throughout his visit.|$|E
