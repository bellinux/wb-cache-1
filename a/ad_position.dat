40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the frequency with which college sports information directors (SIDs) are promoted to athletics director (<b>AD)</b> <b>positions.</b> Results reveal some reasons why SIDs, the primary communications officer in the athletics department, may or may not be considered as qualified candidates for AD jobs. This study illustrates that current ADs predominately come from the ranks of former coaches, compliance officers, business managers and fund raisers, while few were formerly SIDs. In addition, this study sought to determine whether the SID develops skills and experience most closely related with ADs. The variables examined in this study include the SIDs 2 ̆ 7 perception of themselves and their desire to move into the director 2 ̆ 7 s role, and their perception of skills and characteristics required to be an AD. Variables to be considered include the number of ADs who have been SIDs, the number of SIDs who have interviewed for <b>AD</b> <b>positions</b> and who express interest in developing skills associated with <b>AD</b> <b>positions.</b> A survey instrument was constructed to determine if SIDs perceive themselves as qualified to be ADs and to measure their interest in the position. In addition to providing self evaluations of their ability and interest in serving as ADs, SIDs were asked questions regarding the background experience of their supervisors and the hiring history of their institutions, which should provide a sufficient picture of hiring practices for <b>AD</b> <b>positions.</b> Data collected for this study reinforces the findings in the literature review that the majority of communications professionals are content with technician roles, even in advanced stages of their careers. Results indicate that SIDs perceive that they are toiling in an underrated profession and that, for the majority, their personality and training can be tailored for the AD job. However, the significant lack of interest by SIDs in pursuing <b>AD</b> <b>positions</b> was a surprising result of the investigation.

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Search-based {{advertising}} allows the advertisers to run special campaigns targeted to {{different groups of}} potential consumers at low costs. Google, Yahoo and Microsoft advertising programs allow the advertisers to bid for an <b>ad</b> <b>position</b> on the result page of a user's query when the user searches for a keyword that the advertiser relates to its products or services. The expected revenue generated by the ad depends on the <b>ad</b> <b>position,</b> and the ad positions of the advertisers are concurrently determined after an instantaneous auction based on the bids of the advertisers. The advertisers are charged only when their ads are clicked by the users. To avoid excessive ad expenditures due to sudden surges in the keyword-search activities, each advertiser reserves a fixed finite daily budget, and the ads are not shown {{in the remainder of}} the day when the budget is depleted. Arrival times of keyword-search instances, ad positions, ad selections, and sales generated by the ads are random. Therefore, an advertiser faces a dynamic stochastic total net revenue optimization problem subject to a strict budget constraint. Here we formulate and solve this problem using dynamic programming. We show that there is always an optimal dynamic bidding policy. We describe an iterative numerical approximation algorithm that uniformly converges to the optimal solution at an exponential rate of the number of iterations. We illustrate the algorithm on numerical examples. Because dynamic programing calculations of the optimal bidding policies are computationally demanding, we also propose both static and dynamic alternative bidding policies. We numerically compare the performances of optimal and alternative bidding policies by systematically changing each input parameter. The relative percentage total net revenue losses of the alternative bidding policies increases with the budget loading, but were never more than 3. 5 % of maximum expected total net revenue. The best alternative to the optimal bidding policy {{turned out to be a}} static greedy bidding policy. Finally, statistical estimation of the model parameters is visited...|$|E
40|$|Given the {{significant}} {{growth of the}} Internet in recent years, marketers have been striving for new techniques and strategies to prosper in the online world. Statistically, search engines {{have been the most}} dominant channels of Internet marketing in recent years. However, the mechanics of advertising in such a market place has created a challenging environment for marketers to position their ads among their competitors. This study uses a unique cross-sectional dataset of the top 500 Internet retailers in North America and hierarchical multiple regression analysis to empirically investigate the effect of keyword competition on the relationship between <b>ad</b> <b>position</b> and its determinants in the sponsored search market. To this end, the study utilizes the literature in consumer search behavior, keyword auction mechanism design, and search advertising performance as the theoretical foundation. This study is {{the first of its kind}} to examine the sponsored search market characteristics in a cross-sectional setting where the level of keyword competition is explicitly captured in terms of the number of Internet retailers competing for similar keywords. Internet retailing provides an appropriate setting for this study given the high-stake battle for market share and intense competition for keywords in the sponsored search market place. The findings of this study indicate that bid values and ad relevancy metrics as well as their interaction affect the position of ads on the search engine result pages (SERPs). These results confirm some of the findings from previous studies that examined sponsored search advertising performance at a keyword level. Furthermore, the study finds that the position of ads for web-only retailers is dependent on bid values and ad relevancy metrics, whereas, multi-channel retailers are more reliant on their bid values. This difference between web-only and multi-channel retailers is also observed in the moderating effect of keyword competition on the relationships between <b>ad</b> <b>position</b> and its key determinants. Specifically, this study finds that keyword competition has significant moderating effects only for multi-channel retailers...|$|E
