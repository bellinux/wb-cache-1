500|$|When the {{creative}} director and designer Gregg Barnett {{sought out the}} Discworld licence, he intended to show Pratchett that he cared about Discworld, rather than seeking money. During negotiations, he offered to design the game before signing a deal. He did so, and Pratchett agreed. Gregg stated that the design showed respect for Discworld, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> persuaded Pratchett. This took roughly six months, and Pratchett was impressed with a demonstration of Rincewind using a broom to get the Luggage {{off the top of}} a wardrobe. Perfect 10 Productions developed an engine, which was developed in a separate location to [...] "keep the code clean". The dialogue was refined by Pratchett. The character design was based on Barnett giving his interpretation of characters to a character designer who had worked for Disney. He stated that they [...] "went a bit slapstick on it". The backdrops were painted manually and digitised.|$|E
500|$|Daniels {{had said}} that he was {{attracted}} to the initial novel based on how [...] "raw and honest" [...] it felt. In an interview with AMC he noted that reading the book brought back a memory from his childhood of a young abused girl who knocked on his family's door, claiming that her mom was going to kill her. Daniels recalls that the incident {{was the first time he}} saw his mother frightened, specifically noting the helplessness of the situation, and stating [...] "she knew that she’d have to send this little girl home, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> disturbed her— that she couldn’t save her. She tried to make it easier for her. That’s all she could do." [...] In creating the movie Daniels hoped that the experience would be cathartic and that [...] "maybe I could heal. And maybe I could heal other people, too." [...] Another stated goal Daniels had was to challenge the general public's perception of incest.|$|E

500|$|Criticism of Irwin's career {{following}} his death came from Dan Mathews, vice-president {{of the animal}} rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Comparing Irwin to a [...] "cheap reality TV star", Mathews accused him of [...] "antagonising frightened wild animals ... a very dangerous message to send to children", contrasted his methods with the behaviour of [...] "a responsible conservationist like Jacques Cousteau", {{and said it was}} [...] "no shock at all that Steve Irwin should die provoking a dangerous animal." [...] The son of Jacques Cousteau, Jean-Michel Cousteau—also a producer of wildlife documentaries—took issue with Irwin's [...] "very, very spectacular, dramatic way of presenting things" [...] and suggested instead that [...] "You don't touch nature, you just look at it." [...] Jacques Cousteau's grandson and Jean-Michel's nephew, Philippe Cousteau Jr., on the other hand, called Irwin [...] "a remarkable individual"; describing the Ocean's Deadliest project (on which he worked along with Irwin), Philippe said, [...] "I think why Steve was so excited about it that we were looking at these animals that people think of as, you know, dangerous and deadly monsters, and they're not. They all have an important place in the environment and in the world. <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> his whole message was about." ...|$|E

The truth was more prosaic: Henri Pépin was simply from a village called Gontaud-de-Nogaret, not near Toulouse but on the Toulouse side of Bordeaux. Far from being his name, it was his address.|$|E

2500|$|D. H. Lawrence took an opposing, pessimistic view of Revelation in {{the final}} book he wrote, Apocalypse. He saw the {{language}} which Revelation used as being bleak and destructive; a 'death-product'. Instead, he wanted to champion a public-spirited individualism (which he identified with the historical Jesus supplemented by an ill-defined cosmic consciousness) against its two natural enemies. One of these he called [...] "the sovereignty of the intellect" [...] which he saw in a technology-based totalitarian society. The other enemy he styled [...] "vulgarity" [...] <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> he found in Revelation. [...] "It is very nice if you are poor and not humble ... to bring your enemies down to utter destruction, while you yourself rise up to grandeur. And nowhere does this happen so splendiferously than in Revelation." ...|$|E

The main body of [...] men after some fifty five miles of trail could not eat because of the dryness of their mouths. The bison hunters settled {{separate}} from the soldiers. In the dark they bemoaned their fate with the soldiers. [...] The night without clouds allowed the heat to dissipate and a breeze helped cool the men. Some of the mules smelling the breeze took off. The hunters shouted at the soldiers to get their mules, but no one stirred in their exhaustion and the hunters settled down.|$|E

2500|$|Bousman {{said they}} did not intend to have a twist ending, as {{distinctly}} as the previous films, [...] noting that [...] "I think most people will figure it out in the first 15 minutes of the film". Whannell added, [...] "What Darren and I struck for Saw III was to have an emotionally impactful ending. We wanted something that would almost make someone who was really invested in the story cry. We have Jigsaw, this character who's been so cold and clinical, he's been presented throughout the previous two films as someone who's very much in control. He's more like a reptile than a human being. In Saw III he becomes a human being. You see him crack. His veneer cracks <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> was most important to us far and above any sort of gimmick or twist". Whannell also answered questions from previous films that were brought up by fans on the official Saw message board. As with the previous two films, the ending was only given to the actors who appeared in the final scene {{at the time it was}} filmed. At one point the script was stolen from Bousman's chair; however, it was returned before it was leaked online.|$|E

He recorded that [...] "after some simple explanation of the basic rules of cricket (through an interpreter) and a quick demonstration by members of the RAF, the Iraqi children joyfully hit the ball around the playground. I duly handed over the set to the games mistress and she in turn professed to be keen to allow her charges to play on a regular basis."
