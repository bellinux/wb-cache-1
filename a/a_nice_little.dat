500|$|In July, Marvel {{announced}} that Khan {{will join the}} Champions, a team of teenage superheroes who split off from the Avengers following the conclusion of [...] "Civil War II".

Waid said, [...] "The first three are the kids who quit the Avengers proper. That was an easy get. Those three, in and of themselves, form <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>little</b> subteam.

[...] When the story {{was published in the}} United States, critics asserted Hemingway had reinvigorated the short story by his use of declarative sentences and his crisp style. [...] In 1952, reviewing The Old Man and the Sea—for which Hemingway would win the Pulitzer Prize and the Nobel Prize in Literature—The New York Times said of [...] "Big Two-Hearted River" [...] {{that it was one of}} the [...] "best and happiest of his early short stories".|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} of its initial release, the film had a mixed reception, with both {{positive}} and negative reviews. Bosley Crowther of the New York Times enjoyed the film, calling it [...] "... <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>little</b> package of morbidity, all wrapped around in gloom." [...] Paul Meehan calls it [...] "a tepid potboiler of malfeasance and murder on the high seas." [...] John Brosnan described The Ghost Ship as [...] "a more conventional mystery-thriller involving a number of deaths on board a ship, but was produced with Lewton's customary attention to atmosphere." [...] The script has come in for significant praise, with Captain Stone being compared to Captain Queeg in The Caine Mutiny, Captain Ahab in Moby-Dick, and Captain Wolf Larsen in The Sea-Wolf. Other critics have pointed out that Stone and Merriam seem to have a father-son relationship, but that the perverseness of the script is that the father-figure becomes so enraged at his [...] "son's" [...] failings that he seeks to murder him.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} of the episode was not entirely favorable. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club noted a general decline in the show's quality in the fourth season, and after a return to form in its previous episode, [...] "Dealbreakers Talk Show #0001", he found [...] "Secret Santa" [...] disappointing, {{and gave it a}} grade B. [...] "It was cute and nicely plotted", he wrote [...] "but it felt a little rote and familiar." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning was more positively inclined. He appreciated Julianne Moore's appearance, but he found that some of the story lines, [...] "though sprinkled with funny moments, were more successful as sweet tales made for the holiday." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad was glad to see Cheyenne Jackson's Danny back on 30 Rock, and noted that the plots concerning Jack and Nancy and Kenneth and the TGS writers, respectively, were [...] "home runs". He liked that Tina Fey's character Liz [...] "was more of a supporting player" [...] in [...] "Secret Santa". Sassone also enjoyed Moore's appearance on the show, commenting that she was [...] "wicked good" [...] as Jack's new love interest. Entertainment Weeklys Margaret Lyons wrote that this episode [...] "had some awesome Liz/Jack moments, <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>little</b> storyline for Pete and Danny, and the invention of a whole new pizza-loving religion." ...|$|E
500|$|Azalea first {{announced}} {{the song in}} September 2014, in one of many tweets she made where she discussed Reclassified, one in-particular reading [...] "Me and Ellie Goulding have <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>little</b> numberrrr together on there. FYI". During the promotional campaign {{leading up to the}} release of Reclassified, Azalea revealed that she would be collaborating with Ellie Goulding on a track titled [...] "Heavy Crown" [...] featured in the film [...] In October 2014, while giving an interview with Radio.com, Azalea mentioned her longtime desire to work with Goulding, and after meeting her several times, was approached about a song that would eventually become [...] "Heavy Crown". She recalled one meeting, [...] "she played it for me and I was in love with it and just felt it was so kind of appropriate for this to be our collaboration", because it [...] "brings out something different in both artists that you don't usually see." [...] On 14 November, a preview of [...] "Heavy Crown" [...] was uploaded to Azalea's VEVO channel. In December 2014, [...] "Trouble" [...] was announced to be the next single from Reclassified, as opposed to [...] "Heavy Crown". Fans reacted badly, leading to Azalea releasing a statement explaining that test audiences had preferred [...] "Trouble" [...] over [...] "Heavy Crown", and that the duet with Goulding was not [...] "formatted for pop or rhythmic radio".|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} many positive reviews. John Preston, writing for The Daily Telegraph, called the episode an [...] "undiluted triumph". Opening his review, he said [...] "last night's episode {{struck me as}} being as close to 50minutes of pure pleasure as you're likely to get on television". He noted the episode's clever tackling of the topical theme of obesity, and its mixture of emotion and special effects. In closing, he said [...] "the dejected critic, denied even the smallest nit to pick, walks glumly away". Scott Matthewman of The Stage lamented that the Adipose were not threatening enough. He liked the Adipose's execution of Miss Foster, a [...] "momentary pause in mid-air, gravity only kicking in when the character looks down", comparing it to Wile E. Coyote and Chuck Jones, which [...] " [...] <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>little</b> touch in an episode... full of them". He also appreciated Tate, saying that [...] "David Tennant finally has a partner who is approaching an equal". [...] Sam Wollaston of The Guardian wrote that Tate was [...] "not right for this role" [...] and [...] "too hysterical, too comedy, not cool enough", and felt her inclusion {{was an attempt to}} trade on the popularity of her own series and [...] "broaden the appeal of [...] still further". He also found the music [...] "a bit oppressive" [...] but concluded that, despite these criticisms, the show was [...] "still awfully nice television". Keith Watson of Metro gave the episode 4 stars out of 5. He admitted that despite his dislike of Tate, [...] "she isn't that bad". His review of the Adipose was positive, citing them as a reason {{of the quality of the}} show. Closing, he said [...] "it split [...] sides".|$|E
500|$|... "Tallahassee" [...] {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} critics, with many {{noting that the}} Florida story-line gave the series a focus. TV Equals noted that the episode was [...] "one of the best episodes of The Office this the season and [...] {{one of the better}} episodes from the last couple of seasons." [...] Brian Marder from Hollywood.com wrote a largely positive review, noting that [...] "Overall, tonight represented a significant step back in the right direction – and hope that maybe the series still has hope... More promisingly, the humor was top-notch, funnily similar to the effortless comedy of early seasons and refreshingly dissimilar to the forced, uncharacteristic stuff that has pervaded season 8." [...] Bret Davinger from the California Literary Review noted that [...] "A couple of weeks ago, I complained about The Office spending too much time away from the office. How was I to know that taking a trip to Tallahassee would produce probably the best episode of the season and maybe one of the best episodes of the past couple of seasons?" [...] Davinger went on to note that the change in scenery from the office set to Tallahassee was working for the series. In addition, he noted that episode did not feature any hints of Erin's desire to stay in Florida or Cathy's attempt to seduce Jim, a move he hoped would be permanent. [...] Jeffrey Hyatt from Screencrave awarded the episode an 8 out of 10 and wrote that [...] "between 'Special Project' and 'Tallahassee' it’s fair to say that The Office is on <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>little</b> run. Everything good and funny about last week's episode spilled over to 'Tallahassee'." [...] TV Fanatic reviewer Dan Forcella awarded the episode four out of five stars. Despite praising the episode for coming [...] "together {{as one of the best}} Office episodes of the season," [...] he criticized Dwight's main plot, calling it [...] "not funny." [...] The Filtered Lens reviewer Matt Dougherty called the episode [...] "solid" [...] and noted [...] "While 'Tallahassee' was not quite as good as last week, it still is a step in the right direction for this struggling show." [...] He ultimately awarded the episode a 7 out of 10. Many reviews praised the episode's cold opening, with many critics calling it one of the funniest openings of the eighth season. What Culture! reviewer Jeffrey Kratzer, despite awarding the episode three out of five stars, wrote, Tallahassee' was so enjoyable (for the most part) that [...] next few episodes look to be the excitement and focused momentum we've been waiting for all season." ...|$|E
