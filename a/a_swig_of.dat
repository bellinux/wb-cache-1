500|$|Davies and Cornell {{debated whether}} {{it should have been}} Rose's plan all along to save her father; this is left {{ambiguous}} in the episode. Billie Piper felt that it did not occur to Rose until after she began travelling. In the original script, in the scene where the Doctor opens the TARDIS doors and discovers only a police box interior, the police box fell apart. This was changed for reasons of cost, and Cornell has stated that he thinks the change is an improvement. Cornell also states that the character of Pete Tyler is based on his own father, who attempted many different jobs and schemes (including, like Pete, selling health drinks) before eventually finding success running a betting shop. Pete's line [...] "I'm your dad, it's my job for it to be my fault" [...] is taken from something Cornell's father once said to him. Originally Pete was to take <b>a</b> <b>swig</b> <b>of</b> wine before sacrificing himself, but this was removed because a correlation between alcohol and bravery was not thought to be a positive message.|$|E

60|$|He {{said that}} men cured in this way, and enabled to discard the grape system, never {{afterward}} {{got over the}} habit of talking {{as if they were}} dictating to a slow amanuensis, because they always made a pause between each two words while they sucked the substance out of an imaginary grape. He said these were tedious people to talk with. He said that men who had been cured by the other process were easily distinguished from the rest of mankind because they always tilted their heads back, between every two words, and swallowed <b>a</b> <b>swig</b> <b>of</b> imaginary whey. He said it was an impressive thing to observe two men, who had been cured by the two processes, engaged in conversation--said their pauses and accompanying movements were so continuous and regular that a stranger would think himself {{in the presence of a}} couple of automatic machines. One finds out a great many wonderful things, by traveling, if he stumbles upon the right person.|$|E

6000|$|The toast {{having been}} drunk with enthusiasm, Mrs. Bagnet returns thanks {{in a neat}} address of {{corresponding}} brevity. This model composition {{is limited to the}} three words [...] "And wishing yours!"

This she again follows up, on the present occasion, by the wholly unexpected exclamation, [...] "Here's a man!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Leigh Fermor {{described}} {{the man in}} his introduction to The Cretan Runner: [...] When the moon rose he got up and threw <b>a</b> last <b>swig</b> <b>of</b> raki down his throat with the words Another drop of petrol for the engine, and loped towards the gap in the bushes with the furtiveness of a stage Mohican or Groucho Marx. He turned round when he was on all fours at the exit, rolled his eyes, raised a forefinger portentously, whispered, [...] "the Intelligence Service", and scuttled through like a rabbit. A few minutes later we could see his small figure a mile away moving across the next moonlit fold of the foothills of the White Mountains, bound for another fifty-mile journey.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{last thing}} on the {{programme}} was lemonade. It was brought around in little flat glass bowls and set by your plate. I was pretty thirsty, and I picked up mine and took <b>a</b> big <b>swig</b> <b>of</b> it. Right there was where the little lady had made a mistake. She had put in the lemon all right, but she'd forgot the sugar. The best housekeepers slip up sometimes. I thought maybe Miss Sterling was just learning to keep house and cook--that rabbit would surely make you think so--and I says to myself, 'Little lady, sugar or no sugar I'll stand by you,' and I raises up my bowl again and drinks the last drop of the lemonade. And then all the balance of 'em picks up their bowls and does the same. And then I gives Miss Sterling the laugh proper, just to carry it off like a joke, so she wouldn't feel bad about the mistake.|$|R

In spite of the decline, Lincoln still hosts a successful Apple Festival that welcomes visitors and vendors from all over the nation.

5000|$|Zak {{was devastated}} by his brother's death and blamed Marlon by banishing {{him from the}} Dingle homestead, locking him out. Angered and hurt at {{the way he had}} treated Shadrach over the years, Zak turned violent and got very drunk; {{fortunately}} Lisa, Cain, Chas and the Dingles helped him through this. Deeply upset, Zak decided to lay Shadrach to rest on the Dingles' land. Following a ceremony conducted by Ashley, the Dingles and Laurel held a private vigil for Shadrach where they all said how much they loved him and what they would remember most about him, each then taking <b>a</b> <b>swig</b> <b>of</b> beer. Following the ceremony, Zak sat by Shadrach's grave and cried, saying only, [...] "I did my best, Brother, I did my best".|$|E
5000|$|Another visitor commented, [...] "After a {{few minutes}} of hopping about and {{shouting}} I think they ran out of things to do. If they had tried to wreck it, or stolen the vodka or her knickers, I might have felt differently. It made my weekend." [...] The men only had time to start a pillow fight and attempt <b>a</b> <b>swig</b> from one <b>of</b> the empty vodka bottles next to the bed, before they were apprehended. The police and security guards were booed when they took the pair away. Cai and Xi were arrested for their action, but no charges were pressed, since [...] "neither the gallery nor the artist had any desire to bring the matter further".|$|R
500|$|She later {{appeared}} in two films directed by Robert Altman, Cookie's Fortune (1999) and Dr. T & the Women (2000). In Cookie's Fortune, {{she was part}} of an ensemble cast that included Glenn Close, Julianne Moore, Chris O'Donnell, and Patricia Neal. Her performance was well received among critics; Salon.com wrote: [...] "This {{is the first time in}} which Tyler's acting is a match for her beauty (she's always been a bit forlorn). Altman helps her find some snap, but a relaxed, silly snap, as in the cartoon sound she makes when she takes <b>a</b> midday <b>swig</b> <b>of</b> bourbon. The lazy geniality of the movie is summed up by the way Emma [...] saunters off to take a swim with her cowboy hat and pint of Wild Turkey." [...] Entertainment Weekly also noted that Tyler is [...] "sweetly gruff as the tomboy troublemaker". In the romantic comedy, Dr. T & the Women, she played Marilyn, a gynecological patient of Richard Gere's character and the lesbian lover of his daughter, played by Kate Hudson.|$|R
500|$|Bridges {{opined that}} Tron: Legacy was evocative {{of a modern}} myth, adding that ideas {{alluding}} to technological advancement were prevalent throughout the film. To Cyriaque Lamar of io9, the film's approach to technology was reminiscent of a kōan. [...] "One {{of the things that}} brought me to this film," [...] affirmed Bridges, [...] "was the idea of helping to create a modern-day myth to help us navigate through these technological waters [...] I dig immediate gratification as much as anybody, but it happens so fast that if you make a decision like that, you can go far down the wrong path. Think about those plastic single-use water bottles. Where did that come from? Who decided that? You can have <b>a</b> couple <b>of</b> <b>swigs</b> <b>of</b> water [...] and those bottles don't disintegrate entirely. Microscopic animals eat the plastic, and the fish eat those, and we're all connected. It's a finite situation here." ...|$|R
50|$|Aquavit is an {{important}} part of Scandinavian drinking culture, where it is often drunk during festive gatherings, such as Christmas dinners and weddings, and as an aperitif. In Sweden, Denmark and Germany aquavit is cooled down and often sipped slowly from a small shot glass. This is usually attributed to tradition. Most commonly the aquavit is consumed immediately following a song, called a snapsvisa. The most well-known song is Helan Går. In Finland and Sweden, aquavit consumed from a shot glass is commonly associated with crayfish parties, which are traditionally held during late August. In Norway, where most aquavit is matured in oak casks, the drink is served at room temperature in tulip-shaped glasses or shot glasses. Aquavit arguably complements dark beer well, and its consumption is very often preceded by <b>a</b> <b>swig</b> <b>of</b> beer.|$|E
50|$|The bacchantes {{return and}} prevent Daphnis from leaving; they {{convince}} him {{that the way to}} cure his lovesickness is to take a mistress. They try to tempt him, but he is not swayed, so they give him water from the river Léthée to make him forget her. Pan bursts in, and they escape dragging Daphnis with them. Pan takes the gourd with the water in just as Chloé returns; he flatters her and tries to teach her what to do with a lover. After a few kisses, Pan takes <b>a</b> <b>swig</b> <b>of</b> the water and forgets what comes after that. Daphnis returns having learnt a few lessons from the bacchantes, but puts off the final lesson until tomorrow. They thank the bacchantes in dance, and ask the audience to be indulgent and gentle, like lambs, on their show.|$|E
50|$|The {{music video}} shows a Sherlock Holmes-esque detective (Colin Hay) who investigates {{the case of}} Dr. Heckyll (Greg Ham), a quirky mad scientist. One night, Heckyll goes out to a party at {{a house in the}} {{neighborhood}} and takes <b>a</b> <b>swig</b> <b>of</b> the potion he has been working on most recently, a potion to turn himself handsome. 2 girls discover this, and also take swigs of the drink; they turn into palm trees as a result. Heckyll is clearly disturbed by this effect, and suffers a mental breakdown, which results in his transformation into Mr. Jive, a handsome, talkative man who entertains people by playing the piano. The detective, under disguise as a boy scout leader, arrives, but before he can investigate further, Heckyll reverts back to normal form and, with his hunchbacked assistant (Jerry Speiser) leaves satisfied and happy into the sunrise.|$|E
50|$|Shankaran (Bharath Gopi) {{works as}} the Office Superintendent {{in a vast}} {{government}} farm situated in the hilly areas {{on the border of}} Kerala and Tamil Nadu. His colleague Jacob (Mohan Das) is the Field Supervisor and a work addict. The two men are poles apart in their characters. Jacob is a down-to-earth and rather commonplace sort of person, whose social pride does not conflict with his easy-going attitude to morality. Shankaran, on the other hand, is a mild-mannered loner. He has an easy, friendly relationship with the workers. Muniyandi (Sreenivasan), a worker in the farm, is a timid god-fearing man. His job is to look after the cattle. One day he confesses to Shankaran {{that he is going to}} his village to get married. When he asks Jacob for leave, Jacob brusquely tells him that he must be back immediately after the wedding. But Shankaran invites him to have a drink with him in his room. Hoping that God will not notice this minor aberration. Muniyandi says a quick prayer before taking <b>a</b> few <b>swigs</b> <b>of</b> rum equally quickly. Then he settles down on the floor and starts singing in the praise of the Lord. The embarrassed Shankaran has to help him to his quarters.|$|R

50|$|From {{the early}} days {{there was a strong}} {{interest}} from girls, who took an instant liking to the idea of “touch” rugby. The games then continued every Sunday, and it was soon found that between Kirk, Kelly, Andrew, and Scott Hadley that there were already some excellent and accomplished players on the island. In addition, they were able to attract other good players, namely Derek Hadley who was visiting from Australia and Father Pope Faifal from Samoa, working with the Catholic mission. In terms of the girls, Jackie De Freitas soon joined, together with some Canadian volunteers, namely Janice Madill and Lisa Lilajehto. One other girl who was to become a big favourite was Loretta “Hot Lips” Skrok. She became notorious for her trick of taking <b>a</b> <b>swig</b> <b>of</b> strong rum and “flame throwing” at parties. Peace Corps Volunteers Becky Buster and Maria Caluag also became great team members. The local ranks were swelled by the contribution of Lorna “Turbo” Williams from Overland in the Carib community, Delia King from Calliaqua and Yvonne Bakker from Kingstown.|$|E

5000|$|For {{several days}} saloons had been {{required}} to close their doors at 9 o'clock in the evening, and on the ninth, the day set for the execution, business of all kinds was suspended. People for miles around came flocking into town, and on that -day no less than 5,000 were gathered here, {{the majority of them}} being in sympathy with the proceedings. The town was very quiet, guards patrolled the streets, and everything was still and orderly, and when Governor Nye telegraphed to Samuel Youngs, one of the County Commissioners, that there must be no violence, that gentleman sent the following reply: [...] "All quiet and orderly. Four men will be hung in half an hour." [...] At noon the vigilante companies formed in a hollow square about the scaffold, being under the command of Colonel Palmer, who received his orders from the executive committee in Armory Hall. The four doomed men were escorted to the scaffold, while guards upon the outside of the square kept the crowd at a distance. The execution could be witnessed to great advantage from a number of places in town, and at each one of these was assembled a crowd of eager spectators. Daly reportedly took <b>a</b> <b>swig</b> <b>of</b> whiskey while McDowell professed the innocence of Masterson and Buckley, but at half-past 1 o'clock a little cannon that stood beside the gallows was fired, the rope was cut, and the four men disappeared through the trap-door and were soon hanging lifeless, a terrible example of the vengeance of an outraged community.|$|E

The weather changed frequently during filming, and the cast began to fall ill; Eccleston had a cold. The production team selected several streets that looked similar. Most of the streets were in the community of Grangetown. The streets did not require much work for them to resemble 1980s streets; only a few satellite dishes were taken down. The church is St Paul's Church, also in Grangetown. The set of the Tyler's flat was redressed for the time period. For the 1980s style, members of the cast and crew brought in photographs of themselves from the '80s; for example, peach dresses and [...] "big hair" [...] were incorporated, but these elements were not meant to be distracting. Camille Coduri, who played Jackie, wore a wig for this episode. Some of the conversation between Rose and her father in the car was cut because the car had made the dialogue delivery too [...] "bouncy". Piper was scared of holding the baby. Because the baby is present throughout the majority of the episode, but they were limited to how many hours they could work with the infant, an [...] "artificial baby" [...] was used as a placeholder in some scenes.|$|E
