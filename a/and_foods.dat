5|$|Cibber and Katherine had 12 {{children}} between 1694 and 1713. Six died in infancy, {{and most of}} the surviving children received short shrift in his will. Catherine, the eldest surviving daughter, married Colonel James Brown and seems to have been the dutiful one who looked after Cibber in old age following his wife's death in 1734. She was duly rewarded at his death with most of his estate. His middle daughters, Anne and Elizabeth, went into business. Anne had a shop that sold fine wares <b>and</b> <b>foods,</b> and married John Boultby. Elizabeth had a restaurant near Gray's Inn, and married firstly Dawson Brett, and secondly (after Brett's death) Joseph Marples. His only son to reach adulthood, Theophilus, became an actor at Drury Lane, and was an embarrassment to his father because of his scandalous private life. His other son to survive infancy, James, died in or after 1717 before reaching adulthood. Colley's youngest daughter Charlotte followed in her father's theatrical footsteps, but she fell out with him and her sister Catherine, and she was cut off by the family.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} globalization {{patterns in}} the Slovenian agricultural <b>and</b> <b>food</b> trade. It examines prevailing trade structures and trade types to study differences and similarities in trade specialization patterns between primary and processed agricultural <b>and</b> <b>food</b> products across product groups, over time and in comparison with some other European Union countries. We distinguish agricultural <b>and</b> <b>food</b> trade flows by the degree of processing on primary, processed and other agricultural <b>and</b> <b>food</b> products separately for direct household consumption and for industry. With this, we add to the existent literature for Slovenia and for other new European Union members this product classification. Most of Slovenian agricultural <b>and</b> <b>food</b> trade is in the processed products. One-way or inter-industry trade dominates Slovenian agricultural <b>and</b> <b>food</b> trade structures. Within the matched two-way or intra-industry trade the significance in specialization is on low-quality vertical intra-industry trade. This kind of trade types in agricultural <b>and</b> <b>food</b> trade structures is {{not consistent with the}} findings for countries with developed food processing, suggesting that restructuring of the Slovenian food-processing sector has not yet been completed. agri-food, trade-structures, trade-types, intra-industry trade...|$|R
