5|$|Opposite the {{carriage}} barn is another building, also of brick {{but with a}} low hip roof. It is one story high, one bay deep and five bays wide. There are three sets of overhead doors on the main (south) facade of the building. A high brick wall encloses the entire complex, and sections of the corner utility structures {{are a part of}} the surrounding wall. There is a small building in the northeast corner of the complex; it is one bay square with a steep hip roof with spring eaves. It has single round windows near the root line, on two facades. The building's entrance, on the south facade, is made of wood. The building has a counterpart <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> with a low hip roof, a large brick chimney, and a stone water table and string course; it has overhead doors on the north facade.|$|E
25|$|After fifty minutes, {{the hole}} was large enough to drag the {{patients}} through, and the men– save Privates Waters and Beckett, who hid in the wardrobe (Waters was wounded and Beckett died of assegai wounds)– were now in the last room, being defended by Privates Robert Jones and William Jones. From here, the patients clambered out through a window and then made their way <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> to the barricade.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the more}} {{practical}} rigs for small proas was invented by Euell Gibbons around 1950 for a small, single handed proa. This rig was a loose footed lateen sail hung from a centered mast. The sail was symmetric <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> and to shunt, what was previously the top end of the yard was lowered and became the bottom end, reversing {{the direction of the}} sail. Proa enthusiast Gary Dierking modified this design further, using a curved yard and a boom perpendicular to the yard. This allows a greater control of the sail shape than the traditional Gibbons rig, while retaining the simple shunting method, and {{is often referred to as}} the Gibbons/Dierking rig.|$|E

2500|$|Emma Leroy (Janet Wright) is Brent's mother, {{the brains}} and muscle of the family. She and Oscar squabble {{constantly}} and she usually ends {{up having to}} deal with the fallout from his actions, which she usually makes worse. Though he embarrasses and annoys her, she does truly love him. She has also found [...] "letting go" [...] of Brent difficult and reacts badly when someone else appears to replace her in some aspect of his life. Her main hobbies are knitting, crocheting, and gardening and she is active in many of the town's committees. She has also been shown to possess great strength (being able to hurl a cinder block at a skunk <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> with little effort), and other characters often seek her advice. She has a quick-tempered, cunning, domineering personality. After the end of the series she remained married to Oscar, despite doctor's orders.|$|E
