I have fought your battles, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> given me that loyalty that led us to victory more often than the party has ever had since the days of Sir John A. Macdonald.

25|$|He was {{the toughest}} {{son of a bitch}} I ever knew. He taught me that trading is very {{competitive}} <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{to be able to handle}} getting your butt kicked. No matter how you cut it, there are enormous emotional ups and downs involved.|$|E

"Lady," [...] {{answered}} the Frisian, smiling in his slow fashion, [...] "if I {{had been there}} unknown to Ramiro, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> offered him this head of mine on a dish as a bribe, not only would I <b>have</b> forgiven <b>you</b> but I would <b>have</b> said that <b>you</b> did right.

25|$|Six and Out - If {{you hit it}} {{over the}} fence you're out <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to get the ball. The 6 runs are usually not awarded to the batsman unless agreed to by both teams. This rule is {{especially}} popular in small backyards (where the rule may be applied to any ball that lands over the fence - not just 6's), and encourages the batsman to exercise control and restraint by aiming for 4's instead of 6's. Six-and-out is also often extended to include nearby fragile objects such as windows and cars which are declared out-of-bounds; if a ball hits an out-of-bounds object on the full it is deemed six-and-out, even if no damage is evident.|$|E
25|$|In one famous case a {{subordinate}} of EHA {{working in the}} Salt department in Kanara came to his bungalow with a snake on his shoulder. Eha wrote {{that the man had}} seen two snakes fighting and said 'I smashed at them with a stick-one got away, but I killed this one and have brought it to you-What is it ?' 'It is a King cobra, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not killed it' replied Eha. The snake was put in a crate and sent to the BNHS with the note 'It may not survive the journey. If it does not you will know it by the smell. If there be no smell be careful.' The snake survived for two years in the BNHS.|$|E

"Yes, it is," [...] she insisted, [...] "you knew mamma was {{an unhappy}} lady, {{and that the}} people shouted things against her and terrified her; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> must <b>have</b> known, for {{everybody}} knew, that she was sometimes silly and wandered about all night, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> are a big strong man, <b>and</b> so <b>you</b> should <b>have</b> been sorry for her; <b>and</b> if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> been sorry <b>you</b> would <b>have</b> come to see her and been kind to her, <b>and</b> then <b>you</b> would <b>have</b> found it all out." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{conventional}} reel or trolling reel {{is similar}} to the baitcasting reel. There are two types of trolling reels, star drag reels and lever drag reels. Star drag reels are like baitcasters, but you move a little lever to put it into free spool. They have a star drag <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to keep your thumb on them to keep off backlash. The lever drag reel uses the drag to put itself into free spool. It is very difficult to cast a conventional reel, most oven line is dropped behind a boat and left to drift. Conventional reels are for really big fish and are usually used offshore. They are designed for trolling but can also be used for butterfly jigging and Deep-sea fishing ("deep drop"). They are mounted on short rods.|$|E
25|$|Music scholar Martha Hume wrote:When you shake all the {{stardust}} {{off this}} tale, {{what you must}} begin with is an uneducated child {{from one of the}} most isolated cultures in the United States who was given in marriage to a man some six years her senior, a man who was a violent and sometimes brutal alcoholic, who was similarly uneducated and without any job skills to speak of. Add to that a migration to the state of Washington, where the child had no friends or relations; the arrival of four babies; regular—and reportedly mutual—domestic violence; and an income so unstable that there were times when the family had nothing to eat but dandelion greens, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a situation that might well have led to murder. But what actually happened was so improbable, so unimaginable, that the lives of Loretta and Mooney Lynn became one of the great legends of the twentieth century.|$|E

500|$|Queen Elizabeth told Chamberlain {{that her}} daughter, Princess Elizabeth wept as {{she heard the}} broadcast. Churchill wrote to express his {{gratitude}} for Chamberlain's willingness to stand by him in the nation's hour of need, and Lord Baldwin, the only living former Prime Minister besides Chamberlain and Lloyd George, wrote, [...] "You have passed through fire since we were talking together only a fortnight ago, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> come out pure gold." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Striptease {{was hard}} because the tone was so crazy," [...] said Bergman. [...] "How {{do you stay}} true to the tone? You have {{to be true to}} those strip clubs.

500|$|Green {{starred in}} the first season of Starz's series, Camelot, as the sorceress Morgan le Fay. Green stated, [...] "This is such an iconic story <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> 10 episodes to explore a {{character}}. It's not a girlfriend role {{that you could have}} in a movie. It's a real ballsy character. She has some guts." [...] In 2012, Green played a vengeful witch Angelique Bouchard whose curse turns Johnny Depp's character into a vampire in Tim Burton's Dark Shadows.|$|E
500|$|... "The {{whole idea}} {{is that you have}} that nostalgic night out, so people who are older can listen to it too. None of us are naive enough not to know what kids do. It’s {{important}} not to patronise the youth of today, we’re not gonna be writing about ‘oh let’s just hold hands for a while’ you know? They need their music to connect. A lot of songs are about sex <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to be realistic about it." ...|$|E

500|$|A major effect {{required}} {{throughout the}} episode was face replacements, {{especially during the}} 'May vs. May' fight where it had to appear as if Wen was fighting herself. All the effects were completed in the two weeks between the filming and airing of the episode. Wen noted that [...] "Kevin Tancharoen directed [...] and he’s amazing with his directing with the Mortal Kombat series. So we had this really complicated sequence where we do this 360 and it reveals me and it reveals me again and there’s no cut and you wonder how that happens {{in one of the}} fight sequences. And that’s because they completely scanned and CGIed my face onto the stunt double. So there’s a tremendous amount of work that went into the fight scenes and we did not {{have a lot of time}} to do it." [...] She also elaborated that [...] "On the day of, you have the set <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the cameras, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to deal with special effects, because on top of everything else we had to scan my face and go through this incredible process of taking a million pictures so they were able to meld it onto Sam’s face." ...|$|E

500|$|Film critics Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper {{gave the}} film [...] "two thumbs up". Ebert said, [...] "In 39 years, I have never written these {{words in a}} movie review, but here they are: You owe it to {{yourself}} to see this film. If you do not, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> grandchildren, you should explain to them why you decided not to," [...] calling the film [...] "horrifying, enthralling and [...] the potential, I believe, to actually change public policy and begin a process which could save the Earth." ...|$|E
