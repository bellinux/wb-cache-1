5|$|Babs Jansen – Tour guide, Universal Studios Hollywood. She {{mentions}} to Landis {{that she is}} organizing an upcoming Faber reunion, <b>and</b> <b>seems</b> to be successful at her job.|$|E
5|$|Edwin {{was the son}} of Ælle king of Deira <b>and</b> <b>seems</b> to {{have had}} (at least) two siblings. His sister Acha was married to Æthelfrith, king of {{neighbouring}} Bernicia. An otherwise unknown sibling fathered Hereric, who in turn fathered Abbess Hilda of Whitby and Hereswith, wife to Æthelric, the brother of king Anna of East Anglia.|$|E
5|$|Hitler's {{policies}} {{resulted in}} the killing of nearly two million non-Jewish Poles, over three million Soviet prisoners of war, communists and other political opponents, homosexuals, the physically and mentally disabled, Jehovah's Witnesses, Adventists, and trade unionists. Hitler did not speak publicly about the killings, <b>and</b> <b>seems</b> never to have visited the concentration camps.|$|E
60|$|He sipped, <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> disappointed. Then {{he sipped}} again, <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> pleased.|$|R
25|$|Jasmonates — are {{produced}} from fatty acids <b>and</b> <b>seem</b> {{to promote the}} production of defense proteins {{that are used to}} fend off invading organisms. They are believed to also have a role in seed germination, and affect the storage of protein in seeds, <b>and</b> <b>seem</b> to affect root growth.|$|R
60|$|He {{nodded his}} head gloomily, <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> pondering a serious question.|$|R
5|$|This first castle {{was used}} only briefly <b>and</b> <b>seems</b> {{to have been}} {{abandoned}} {{by the middle of}} the 12th century. The grain stores were destroyed by fire, but the reason for this is uncertain. By this period, the town of Lydford as a whole was also in serious economic decline.|$|E
5|$|A man, Cutter (Pablo Coffey), visits an {{open house}} viewing, where he is given a tour by the estate agent, <b>and</b> <b>seems</b> to take an {{interest}} in the bedroom of a young girl. That night, the owners have returned home, and are settling down for the evening when their daughter, Patricia, begins screaming. Later, a security guard for the family's alarm company finds the bodies of the parents hacked to death on the first floor, but Patricia is nowhere to be seen.|$|E
5|$|Baba is Amir's {{father and}} a wealthy {{businessman}} who aids the community by creating businesses for others and building a new orphanage. He is the biological father of Hassan, a fact he hides from both of his children, <b>and</b> <b>seems</b> to favor him over Amir. Similar to Hosseini's father, Baba does not endorse the religiosity demanded by the clerics in the religion classes attended by Amir in school. In his later years, after fleeing to America, he works at a gas station. He dies from cancer in 1987, shortly after Amir and Soraya's wedding.|$|E
60|$|He {{swung his}} stick restlessly, <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> fitfully talking to himself.|$|R
60|$|Both gentlemen {{glanced at}} him, <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> {{surprised}} at his assurance.|$|R
60|$|But eluding me, {{they looked}} reproachfully at Yoomy; <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> offended.|$|R
5|$|Falco peregrinus japonensis, {{described}} by Gmelin in 1788, includes kleinschmidti, pleskei, and harterti, <b>and</b> <b>seems</b> {{to refer to}} intergrades with calidus. It is found from northeast Siberia to Kamchatka (though it is possibly replaced by pealei on the coast there) and Japan. Northern populations are migratory, while those of Japan are resident. It is similar to peregrinus, but the young are even darker than those of anatum.|$|E
5|$|Hugh was {{a keeper}} of the king's seal, serving as deputy to Simon of Wells, the Archdeacon of Wells who was Keeper of the Great Seal from around 1199 to 1204. Simon was also a {{relative}} of Hugh's, <b>and</b> <b>seems</b> to have helped secure positions for both Hugh and Jocelin in the royal administration. Hugh was a royal clerk in the chancery, the royal secretariat, and was named Archdeacon of Wells sometime before 25 April 1204. He held prebends in the diocese of Lincoln and diocese of London as well. His service in the chancery would have involved him in Hubert Walter's administrative innovations during his term as Chancellor.|$|E
5|$|In 1297 he {{accompanied}} Edward I on {{a campaign}} to Flanders, <b>and</b> <b>seems</b> to have been knighted by this time. With his French connections {{he was in the}} following years a valuable diplomat in France for the English King. He also served as military commander in occupied Scotland. In 1298 at Blackearnside, a forest of alders, to the east of the village of Newburgh in Fife, he suffered an ignominious defeat from a force commanded by Wallace, Guardian of Scotland. In 1306 at the Battle of Methven, he won the day over Robert the Bruce only to be soundly defeated by Bruce at Loudoun Hill the next year.|$|E
60|$|My {{guardian}} patted me on {{the shoulder}} <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> much amused.|$|R
60|$|She paused, <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> to be {{referring}} {{the point}} to Staniford.|$|R
60|$|George drank about a wine-glassful neat, <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> {{to recover}} himself.|$|R
5|$|In New Orleans, Jeb Larold Dukes {{is fired}} from his job. After {{he leaves the}} office, Jeb {{witnesses}} a car chase which ends in a fiery crash. A burning figure that only Jeb can see emerges from the wreck <b>and</b> <b>seems</b> to merge with him. Jeb, now possessed by the being, returns to his office to fatally shoot his boss and co-workers.|$|E
5|$|Lochner {{probably}} saw van Eyck's c. 1432 Ghent Altarpiece {{during his}} visit to the Netherlands <b>and</b> <b>seems</b> to have borrowed a number of its compositional elements. The similarities include {{the manner in which the}} figures engage with their space and the emphasis on and rendering of elements such as brocades, gems and metals. Some figures in Lochner's paintings are directly borrowed from Ghent, and a number of facial features match those seen in van Eyck. His Virgin with the Violet has often been compared to van Eyck's 1439 Virgin at the Fountain. Similarly to those in van Eyck's work, Lochner's angels often sing or play musical instruments, including lutes and organs.|$|E
5|$|Malcolm Barrett as Dr. Lem Hewitt: Lem {{is one of}} the {{laboratory}} scientists in Veridian's Research Department. He is best friends with his lab partner Phil, who works with him on almost every project. Lem is just as conflict-averse as Phil, <b>and</b> <b>seems</b> just as willing to roll over and take whatever abuse the company has to offer. He grew up in the shadow of his mother (Khandi Alexander) a renowned scientist.|$|E
60|$|Wild Water {{stared at}} the rapidly disappearing eggs <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> petrified.|$|R
60|$|Meg {{wiped her}} face with her big pinafore, <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> uncomfortable.|$|R
60|$|The rebel {{studied him}} keenly for a moment; <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> satisfied.|$|R
5|$|One night, a cargo {{aircraft}} {{from the}} kingdom of Tolmekia crashes in the Valley. Its sole passenger, Princess Lastelle of Pejite, pleads with Nausicaä to destroy the cargo and dies. The cargo is an embryo of a Giant Warrior, one of the lethal humanoid bioweapons that caused the Seven Days of Fire. Tolmekia, a military state, seized the embryo and Lastelle from Pejite, but their plane was attacked by mutant insects and crashed. One of the insects emerges wounded from the wreckage <b>and</b> <b>seems</b> poised to attack the villagers, but Nausicaä uses a small bullroarer to calm it and guides {{it away from the}} village.|$|E
5|$|Robert died {{fighting}} the Scots {{at the battle}} of Bannockburn and the region around the castle was attacked in 1314 and 1319, causing significant damage to neighbouring Church Brough. Around this time the village of Market Brough was established along the road overlooked by the castle, in an attempt by the Cliffords to maximise the possibilities for profits from trade along the valley. Market Brough acquired a royal charter in 1330 <b>and</b> <b>seems</b> to have rapidly overtaken Church Brough as the main settlement in the area.|$|E
5|$|Salkin {{had noted}} that its {{tropical}} position might mean that B.dentata {{was a key}} species in the transition from rainforest to open habitat in the ancestry of the genus. One adaptation to a drier sunnier climate was a thick intermediate layer under the epidermis in the leaf architecture. This layer, the hypodermis, contains large vacuoles that are filled with a phenolic compound, <b>and</b> <b>seems</b> to serve to reduce the intensity of sunlight reaching the mesophyll.|$|E
60|$|He {{raised his}} dark, gentle eyes {{to my face}} <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> surprised.|$|R
60|$|The immense Leopard {{rested his}} chin on the log <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> thoughtful.|$|R
60|$|She {{paused for}} a few seconds, <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> to be {{thinking}} deeply.|$|R
5|$|The M. {{tuberculosis}} complex (MTBC) {{includes four}} other TB-causing mycobacteria: M. bovis, M. africanum, M. canetti, and M. microti. M. africanum is not widespread, {{but it is}} a significant cause of tuberculosis in parts of Africa. M. bovis was once a common cause of tuberculosis, but the introduction of pasteurized milk has almost completely eliminated this as a public health problem in developed countries. M. canetti is rare <b>and</b> <b>seems</b> to be limited to the Horn of Africa, although a few cases have been seen in African emigrants. M. microti is also rare and is seen almost only in immunodeficient people, although its prevalence may be significantly underestimated.|$|E
5|$|The western tomb {{was built}} {{subsequently}} {{to the eastern}} one <b>and</b> <b>seems</b> to have served to bury another woman. Builders graffiti uncovered during the Czech excavations demonstrate in all likelihood that the monument was built under Nyuserre, its owners possibly amongst the last members of the broader royal family {{to be buried in}} Abusir, the necropolis being abandoned by Nyuserre's successor Menkauhor.|$|E
5|$|This {{research}} has shown that there was a single origin of ectomycorrhizal symbiosis in the Amanita genus. DNA analysis has shown that a group of species in the subsection Vittadiniae (which includes S.thiersii) has few derived characteristics. This clade has a single ancestor (or a very small number) <b>and</b> <b>seems</b> to have come into being at a very early stage {{in the evolution of the}} genus.|$|E
60|$|She paused, <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> to reflect, still {{outwardly}} as calm as ever.|$|R
60|$|Nicholas hemmed once or twice, <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> to {{have some}} {{difficulty}} in proceeding.|$|R
60|$|She sighed a little, <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> to {{look back}} tenderly on the past.|$|R
