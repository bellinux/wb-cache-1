50|$|A Rosemount Annubar primary {{element is}} an <b>averaging</b> <b>Pitot</b> <b>tube</b> {{similar to a}} single point pitot tube {{used to measure the}} flow of gas, steam, or liquid in a pipe. An Annubar primary element or Annubar <b>averaging</b> <b>Pitot</b> <b>tube</b> {{provides}} better accuracy than single point Pitot tubes.|$|E
50|$|The biggest {{difference}} between an Annubar <b>averaging</b> <b>Pitot</b> <b>tube</b> and a Pitot tube is that an Annubar <b>averaging</b> <b>Pitot</b> <b>tube</b> takes multiple samples across a section of a pipe or duct. In this way, it averages the differential pressures encountered accounting for variations in flow across the section. A Pitot tube will give a similar reading if the tip is located {{at a point in}} the pipe cross section where the flowing velocity is close to the average velocity.|$|E

40|$|The {{flow pattern}} inside {{rectangular}} intake air duct of 300 MW lignite {{coal-fired power plant}} is investigated in order to analyze and reduce overall inlet system pressure drop. The system consists of the 45 -degree inlet elbow, the flow instrument, the 90 -degree mitered elbow and fans, respectively. The energy loss in each section can be determined by Bernoulli’s equation and ASHRAE standard table. Hence, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is {{used in this study}} based on Navier-Stroke equation and the standard k-epsilon turbulence modeling. Input boundary condition is 175 kg/s mass flow rate inside the 11 -m 2 cross sectional duct. According to the inlet air flow rate, the Reynolds number of airstream is 2. 7 x 106 (based on the hydraulic duct diameter), thus the flow behavior is turbulence. The numerical results are validated with the real operation data. It is found that the numerical result agrees well with the operating data, and dominant loss occurs at the flow rate measurement device. Normally, the air flow rate is measured by the airfoil and it gets high pressure drop inside the duct. To overcome this problem, the airfoil is planned to be replaced with the other type measuring instrument, such as the <b>average</b> <b>pitot</b> <b>tube</b> which generates low pressure drop of airstream. The numerical result in case of <b>average</b> <b>pitot</b> <b>tube</b> shows that the pressure drop inside the inlet airstream duct is decreased significantly. It {{should be noted that the}} energy consumption of inlet air system is reduced too...|$|R
40|$|The issues {{connected}} with the complex design of various facilities, including up-to-date boiler equipment {{as well as the}} ways of organizing the space around them, are the reasons why there is often a lack of room for mounting a flowmeter in accordance with the recommendations of manufacturers. In most cases the problem is associated with ensuring sufficient lengths of straight pipe leading into and out of a flowmeter. When this condition cannot be fulfilled, the uncertainty of measurement increases above the value guaranteed by the manufacturer of the flowmeter.

40|$|The flow {{measurement}} of wet-gas {{is an active}} field with extensive research background that remains a modern-day challenge. The implication of wet-gas flow conditions is no different in Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) pipelines. The associated complex flow regime with wet-gas flow {{makes it difficult to}} accurately meter the flow rate of the gas phase. Some conventional single-phase flowmeters like the Coriolis, Orifice plate, Ultrasonic, V-Cone, Venturi and Vortex have been tested for this application, usually accompanied with special recommendations. Often, a correlation equation valid within a certain range of specific conditions is required to correct the response of the flowmeter. This paper presents investigations into the suitability and performance {{of one of the most}} advanced averaging pitot tubes for the {{flow measurement}} of wet CO 2 gas. The <b>averaging</b> <b>pitot</b> <b>tube</b> with flow conditioning wing geometry (APT-FCW) was studied and experimentally assessed in earlier work for the flow measurement of pure and dry CO 2 within an error of ± 1 %.

40|$|In this paper, an <b>averaging</b> <b>pitot</b> <b>tube</b> (APT) with flow {{conditioning}} wing (FCW) geometry {{is used as}} {{a practical}} sensing device to measure and characterize the flow of single-phase gaseous carbon dioxide (CO 2). This technique demonstrates a simple, cost-effective, and potentially accurate option toward the measurement, accurate accounting, and characterization of CO 2 in carbon capture and storage pipelines. The metrological performance of the flow sensor is verified using air medium before being applied for gaseous CO 2. With a Coriolis mass flowmeter acting as a secondary calibration reference to further validate the performance of the APT-FCW flow sensor, both metering instruments were evaluated against a weighing scale apparatus. From the experimental and calibration data with air, the APT-FCWs average K-factor and linearity error are found to be 0. 5091 and 0. 725 %, respectively. With operating conditions remaining unaltered in this particular flow measurement application and a target metering error within ± 1 %, the errors achieved for the Coriolis meter and the APT-FCW are better than ± 0. 6 % and ± 1. 2 %, respectively.

30|$|The {{theory of}} flow {{measurement}} by <b>Pitot</b> <b>tube</b> was adopted first by a French Scientist Henri Pitot in 1732 A.D. for measuring velocities in the river. The <b>Pitot</b> <b>tube</b> {{is used to}} measure the local velocity at a given point in the flow stream. It is a very simple and low-cost device used to measure mean velocities for various industrial purposes (Bryant et al. 2014; Graham et al. 2013; Oh and Lee 2011). The <b>Pitot</b> <b>tube</b> is not suitable for velocities lower than 5  m/s (Nakra and Chaudhry 2004) because of low pressure differential availability. The <b>Pitot</b> <b>tube</b> has many disadvantages, as ports for pressure measurements require modification to the wall and present potential disturbance to the flow (Liu et al. 1999). The order of error in the measurement of velocity is up to 20  % as reported by Bakke (1957) and the average error is ± 2  % (Nakra and Chaudhry 2004). <b>Pitot</b> <b>tube</b> is not so practicable for turbulence study.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} combat the climate change caused by {{increasing}} emissions of CO 2 from industrial processes, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies have been accepted worldwide to address these pressing global warming concerns. So as to efficiently manage material and financial losses across the entire stream, accurate accounting and monitoring through fiscal metering of CO 2 in CCS transportation pipelines are core and required features for the deployment of CCS technologies.

This thesis reports experimental studies of two different metering technologies, an <b>Averaging</b> <b>Pitot</b> <b>Tube</b> (APT) and a Coriolis mass flowmeter (CMF), for CO 2 flow measurement, together with the design and implementation of a CO 2 flow calibration facility.

40|$|To {{combat the}} growing {{emissions}} of CO 2 from industrial processes, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and Carbon Capture and Utilization technologies (CCU) {{have been accepted}} worldwide to address these pressing concerns. So as to efficiently manage material and financial losses across the entire stream, accurate accounting and monitoring through fiscal metering of CO 2 in CCS transportation pipelines are core and required features for the CCS technologies. Moreover, these technical requirements {{are part of the}} legal compliance schemes and guidelines from various regulatory bodies. The CO 2 transportation pipelines will likely have multiple inputs from different capture plants, each with varying composition of CO 2 and thus introducing impurities into the CO 2 stream. The presence of other ordinary or hydrocarbon gases in the CO 2 gas stream could affect the functionality of metering instruments by introducing additional errors, particularly in the case of volumetric flowmeters. In this study, volumetric and direct mass measurement methods for the flow measurement of CO 2 mixtures using two totally different metering principles are experimentally evaluated. An <b>Averaging</b> <b>Pitot</b> <b>Tube</b> with Flow Conditioning Wing (APT-FCW) and Coriolis mass flowmeters (CMF) are used to assess the flow metering of CO 2 in a binary gaseous mixture. Different gases (nitrogen, air, oxygen, argon and propane) are diluted as contaminants into the pure CO 2 gas flow for various mass fractions to produce an adulterated mixture of the CO 2 gas. Comparative analysis of the measurement results under these flow conditions relative to that of pure CO 2 gas show that the measurement error of the APT-FCW sensor increases with the mass fraction of the diluent component, and gases with density closer to that of CO 2 have a much lesser effect on the performance of the APT-FCW flow sensor for smaller mass fractions. The CMF proved to be very reliable in the gas combination processes and as a reference meter for the APT-FCW sensor. Further analytical observations are discussed in detail...|$|E
40|$|Real time {{detection}} of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) using Selected Ion Flow Tube – Mass Spectrometry (SIFT-MS) provides {{a unique opportunity}} for research into breath testing for clinical diagnosis. However, before engaging in research into breath analytes as markers of disease, appropriate breath collection methods are required. Collection of breath for SIFT-MS instruments fall into two categories, direct breath collection into the instrument and the remote breath collection onto a storage medium. This thesis describes the development and validation of both methods of breath collection equipment for SIFT-MS analysis. Development of the direct breath collection device involved standardising and optimising {{the way in which}} breath is sampled by SIFT-MS. Design considerations include ergonomics, patient safety, breathing resistance, materials, and appropriate operating conditions of the device. Results from materials testing showed that all materials emit VOCs and the best approach is to minimise VOC emission by careful material selection. To minimise flow resistance experienced by the patient, the capillary from which the SIFT-MS instrument samples, is placed {{as close as possible to}} the users mouth. The optimal operating temperature of the device was found to be 100 °C - 120 °C, which ensures that water vapour will not condense inside the capillary causing blockage. In order to ensure patient safety the device is adequately insulated using stagnant air which also minimises VOC emission from insulation materials. Because a SIFT-MS instrument is large and cannot be easily shifted around a hospital, a system of remote sample collection is required. It is also important to separately collect and analyse breath from the respiratory alveolar region. For this reason the remote breath collection device designed also fractionates collected breath samples into the breath from the upper airways and alveolar breath. The storage medium chosen for the collected breath samples is a gas sampling bag made from Tedlar™. Collection of breath into Tedlar™ bags allows breath to be stored as a whole air sample, the ideal form for analysis with the SIFT-MS technique. Alveolar breath is fractionated from deadspace gasses by measuring a subject's exhalation and collecting the portion of interest. The breath exhalation is measured by an <b>averaging</b> <b>Pitot</b> <b>tube</b> and pressure transducer. Signal processing and automation of the remote breath collection device is controlled by a Cypress Microsystems PSoC microcontroller. To validate the device isoprene and acetone concentrations in fractionated breath samples were compared with a whole breath sample. Results showed that the alveolar breath fraction had a higher concentration of acetone than the upper airway fraction, indicating that the breath was successfully fractioned. However, isoprene concentrations were lower in both fractions due to hyperventilation of the subject causing a dilution effect of alveolar VOCs. Therefore, a higher sample collection volume is required per exhalation, and regulating subjects' breathing rate will avoid the dilution effect observed in collected breath samples. Overall, this thesis had designed, developed and validated two forms of breath collection systems for use with SIFT-MS technology...|$|E
