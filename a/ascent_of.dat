5|$|The {{first major}} {{action of the}} race {{occurred}} as the riders approached the first <b>ascent</b> <b>of</b> the Mur de Huy. Dan Martin, one of the favourites for the race, touched wheels with Tiago Machado (Katusha) and both riders crashed. Martin returned to his bike and chased back to the peloton {{with the help of}} several teammates, but later withdrew. He had hit his head in the crash and wished to recover ahead of the Liège–Bastogne–Liège the following weekend. Several other riders were caught up or delayed, including Chris Froome. At the top of the first <b>ascent</b> <b>of</b> the Mur, the breakaway's lead had been cut to under six minutes.|$|E
50|$|Whilst {{the golden}} age of alpinism (1854-1865) was characterised by the first <b>ascents</b> <b>of</b> many of the Alps's most {{dominant}} mountains, the subsequent silver age may be seen as consisting <b>of</b> the first <b>ascents</b> <b>of</b> the many worthwhile peaks left unclimbed, although these peaks were - and remained - largely unknown to the wider public in Great Britain.|$|R
50|$|Anatoli Nikolaevich Boukreev (Анато́лий Никола́евич Букре́ев; January 16, 1958 - December 25, 1997) was a Russian Kazakhstani mountaineer {{who made}} <b>ascents</b> <b>of</b> 10 of the 14 eight-thousander peaks, i.e., peaks above 8000 m, without {{supplemental}} oxygen. From 1989 through 1997, he made 18 successful <b>ascents</b> <b>of</b> peaks above 8000 m.|$|R

5|$|A major crustal lineament {{known as}} the Archibarca lineament intersects the main {{volcanic}} arc at Lastarria. Other volcanic centres such as Galán and ore deposits are also found on this lineament. The intersection between this lineament and the arc may act as a weakness zone that focuses the <b>ascent</b> <b>of</b> magma. Farther south lie volcanoes such as Wheelwright Caldera and Cerro Blanco, the last of which shows evidence of recent unrest.|$|E
5|$|In 1844, the Scottish {{publisher}} Robert Chambers anonymously {{published an}} extremely controversial but widely read book entitled Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation. This book proposed an evolutionary scenario for {{the origins of}} the Solar System and of life on Earth. It claimed that the fossil record showed a progressive <b>ascent</b> <b>of</b> animals, with current animals branching off a main line that leads progressively to humanity. It implied that the transmutations lead to the unfolding of a preordained plan that had been woven into the laws that governed the universe. In this sense it was less completely materialistic than the ideas of radicals like Grant, but its implication that humans were only the last step in the <b>ascent</b> <b>of</b> animal life incensed many conservative thinkers. The high profile of the public debate over Vestiges, with its depiction of evolution as a progressive process, would greatly influence the perception of Darwin's theory a decade later.|$|E
5000|$|The 2014 edition {{incorporated}} {{three new}} routes heading south of Megeve into the Beaufortin range: 80km 2000 m of climbing with two <b>ascents</b> <b>of</b> Col des Saisies; 110 km 3100m climbing with two <b>ascents</b> <b>of</b> Col des Saisies, Col des Pres, Lac de Roseland; 135km 3500m climbing with two <b>ascents</b> <b>of</b> Col des Saisies, Col des Pres, Lac de Roseland; Col de la Forclaz. Safety considerations {{following the death}} of a Swiss rider in the 2010 edition has led to the organisers neutralising downhill sections, participants passing through timing sections at {{the top and bottom of}} the major climbs.|$|R

5|$|In {{the summer}} of the same year, Abovian was visited by two German travellers. A Bavarian professor, Moritz Wagner, from the University of Munich, arrived in May and toured the Lake Sevan region with Abovian and {{thereafter}} corresponded {{with him on a}} regular basis. In July Abovian also accompanied Wagner on the first recorded <b>ascent</b> <b>of</b> Mount Aragats in Armenia.|$|E
5|$|The Flavians {{initiated}} {{economic and}} cultural reforms. Under Vespasian, new taxes were devised to restore the Empire's finances, while Domitian revalued the Roman coinage by increasing its silver content. A massive building programme was enacted to celebrate the <b>ascent</b> <b>of</b> the Flavian dynasty, leaving multiple enduring landmarks {{in the city of}} Rome, the most spectacular of which was the Flavian Amphitheatre, better known as the Colosseum.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>ascent</b> <b>of</b> Mount Adams was in 1854 by Andrew Glenn Aiken, Edward Jay Allen, and Andrew J. Burge. While most sources {{list the}} {{aforementioned}} names, {{at least one}} substitutes Colonel Benjamin Franklin Shaw for Andrew Burge. Their route was likely up the North Cleaver because that summer they were improving a newly designated military road that passes through Naches Pass, which is {{to the north of}} Adams.|$|E

25|$|A {{year after}} his {{accident}} on Annapurna, he climbed Cho Oyu, and then in 1994 he climbed a new route, solo, on the north face of Shishapangma. It was the first <b>of</b> many solo <b>ascents</b> <b>of</b> 8000 meter peaks, including consecutive <b>ascents</b> <b>of</b> Gasherbrum I and Gasherbrum II in four days in 1996, and Manaslu in 2001.|$|R

5|$|The {{rocks that}} form Snowdon were {{produced}} by volcanoes in the Ordovician period, and the massif {{has been extensively}} sculpted by glaciation, forming the pyramidal peak of Snowdon and the arêtes of Crib Goch and Y Lliwedd. The cliff faces on Snowdon, including Clogwyn Du'r Arddu, are significant for rock climbing, and the mountain was used by Edmund Hillary in training for the 1953 <b>ascent</b> <b>of</b> Mount Everest.|$|E
5|$|Tom Simpson (30 November 1937– 13 July 1967) was a British {{professional}} cyclist, one of Britain's {{most successful}} of all-time. At {{the time of}} the 1967 Tour de France, he was the undisputed leader of the British team. In the 13th stage of that race, he collapsed and died during the <b>ascent</b> <b>of</b> Mont Ventoux.|$|E
5|$|A Short Walk in the Hindu Kush is a 1958 book by the English travel writer Eric Newby. It is an autobiographical {{account of}} his adventures in the Hindu Kush, around the Nuristan {{mountains}} of Afghanistan, ostensibly {{to make the first}} mountaineering <b>ascent</b> <b>of</b> Mir Samir. It {{has been described as a}} comic masterpiece, intensely English, and understated. Publications including The Guardian and The Telegraph list it among the greatest travel books of all time. It has sold over 500,000 copies in paperback.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, France, Switzerland and San Marino were the only European nations to have a republican form of government. The <b>ascent</b> <b>of</b> republicanism to the {{political}} mainstream started only {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, facilitated by the toppling of various European monarchies through war or revolution; as at the beginning of the 21st century, most of the states in Europe are republics with either a directly or indirectly elected head of state.|$|E
5|$|In {{the thirteenth}} {{stage of the}} 1967 Tour de France, Simpson {{collapsed}} and died during the <b>ascent</b> <b>of</b> Mont Ventoux. He was 29 years old. The post-mortem examination found that he had mixed amphetamines and alcohol; this diuretic combination proved fatal when combined with the heat, the hard climb of the Ventoux and a stomach complaint. A memorial near where he died has become a place of pilgrimage for many cyclists. Simpson was known to have taken performance-enhancing drugs during his career, when no doping controls existed. He is held in high esteem by many cyclists for his character and will to win.|$|E
5|$|Norway's {{architectural}} {{trends are}} also seen to parallel political and societal changes in Norway over the centuries. Prior to the Viking Age, wooden structures {{developed into a}} sophisticated craft evident in the elegant and effective construction of the Viking longships. Following that, the <b>ascent</b> <b>of</b> Christianity introduced Romanesque architecture in cathedrals and churches, with characteristically slightly pointed arches, barrel vaults, cruciform piers supporting vaults, and groin vaults; in large part {{as a result of}} religious influence from England.|$|E

5|$|One of Glynne's main {{interests}} was mountaineering {{and rock}} climbing, although {{her family did}} not support the hobby, as her mother's cousin, Owen Glynne Jones {{died at the age of}} 32 in a climbing accident on Dent Blanche. Despite this, Glynne climbed throughout her life, including in Australia and New Zealand whilst she was touring there. She recorded the second ever <b>ascent</b> <b>of</b> Mount Spencer in New Zealand, the first by a woman. When she returned to Europe, she climbed major Alpine peaks such as Matterhorn, Mont Blanc, La Meije and Aiguille du Dru in the 1930s. She carried on climbing into her 60s, ascending Mount Fuji in Japan in 1963.|$|E
5|$|Other notable figures include Gertrude Bell, an explorer, archaeologist, mapper and spy, who, {{along with}} T. E.

5|$|The Irish {{philosopher and}} theologian Johannes Scotus Eriugena was {{considered}} one of the leading intellectuals of the early Middle Ages. Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton, an Irish explorer, was one of the principal figures of Antarctic exploration. He, along with his expedition, made the first <b>ascent</b> <b>of</b> Mount Erebus and the discovery of the approximate location of the South Magnetic Pole. Robert Boyle was a 17th-century natural philosopher, chemist, physicist, inventor and early gentleman scientist. He is largely regarded {{one of the founders of}} modern chemistry and is best known for the formulation of Boyle's law.|$|E
2500|$|During 1880, Whymper {{made two}} <b>ascents</b> <b>of</b> Chimborazo (6,267m), {{claiming}} the first ascent, though Alexander von Humboldt had ascended the volcano in 1802. He spent {{a night on}} the summit of Cotopaxi and made first <b>ascents</b> <b>of</b> half a dozen other great peaks. [...] In 1892, he published the results of his journey in a volume entitled Travels amongst the Great Andes of the Equator.|$|R
50|$|Naar {{was born}} in The Hague, and was an active climber from the 1970s onwards. He made the first <b>ascents</b> <b>of</b> Peak 6393 in the Karakorum, Djo Drake in Bhutan, Tilleketinda on Greenland and Duivelsei in Surinam. He made the first Dutch <b>ascents</b> <b>of</b> several mountains, {{including}} the Eiger (north face) and K2, {{and was the first}} Dutch climber to complete the Seven Summits.|$|R
50|$|Phurba Tashi Sherpa Mendewa (फूर्वा तासी शेर्पा) is a Nepalese Sherpa mountaineer, born 1971, {{known for}} his {{numerous}} <b>ascents</b> <b>of</b> major Himalayan peaks. He holds {{the record for the}} most total <b>ascents</b> <b>of</b> eight-thousanders, with 30. These include twenty-one <b>ascents</b> <b>of</b> Mount Everest, five on Cho Oyu, two on Manaslu, and one each on Shishapangma and Lhotse. In 2009 Tashi was featured in the Discovery Channel series Everest: Beyond the Limit. He is the central figure in the 2015 documentary Sherpa which recounts events surrounding the 2014 Mount Everest ice avalanche, after which Tashi retired. He reached the summit of Everest 21 times, including three times in the 2007 season alone. He lives in Khumjung, Nepal.|$|R
