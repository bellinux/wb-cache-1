5|$|Flux-cored wire is {{considered}} to have some <b>advantages</b> <b>for</b> outdoor welding on-site, as the shielding gas plume {{is less likely to}} be blown away in a wind than shield gas from a conventional nozzle. A slight drawback is that, like SMAW (stick) welding, there may be some flux deposited over the weld bead, requiring more of a cleaning process between passes.|$|E

30|$|For the {{industrial}} clerks, 18 items with DIF were identified, {{and for the}} logistic clerks, 13 items with DIF were identified. For {{the industrial}} clerks, 7 items provided an <b>advantage</b> <b>for</b> the German learners, and 11 items provided an <b>advantage</b> <b>for</b> the Swiss learners. For the logistic clerks, it was more equally distributed: 6 items provided an <b>advantage</b> <b>for</b> the German learners, and 7 items provided an <b>advantage</b> <b>for</b> the Swiss learners. The differences in item difficulty varied between 0.19 and 1.35 logits, which is between 0.23 and 1.60 times the standard deviation of the latent variable (industrial clerksSD = 0.82, logistic clerksSD = 0.84). Within the groups of industrial clerks, there were more items that provided an <b>advantage</b> <b>for</b> the Swiss learners than for the German learners. The following section presents examples of the DIF items (the items with the strongest DIF) that were given one time with an <b>advantage</b> <b>for</b> German learners and one time with an <b>advantage</b> <b>for</b> Swiss learners for each occupation/branch separately (Fig.  5).|$|R
5|$|Oil-fired {{propulsion}} {{had many}} <b>advantages</b> <b>for</b> naval architects and officers at sea alike. It reduced smoke, making ships less visible. It could be fed into boilers automatically, rather than needing a complement of stokers {{to do it}} by hand. Oil has roughly twice the thermal content of coal. This meant that the boilers themselves could be smaller; and for the same volume of fuel, an oil-fired ship would have much greater range.|$|E
5|$|A {{successful}} {{invasion of}} Egypt would have several further <b>advantages</b> <b>for</b> the Byzantine Empire. Egypt {{was a rich}} province, and {{in the days of}} the Roman Empire it had supplied much of the grain for Constantinople before it was lost to the Arabs in the 7th century. The revenues that the Empire could have expected to gain from the conquest of Egypt would have been considerable, even if these would have to be shared with the Crusaders. Furthermore, Manuel may have wanted to encourage Amalric's plans, not only to deflect the ambitions of the Latins away from Antioch, but also to create new opportunities for joint military ventures that would keep the King of Jerusalem in his debt, and would also allow the Empire to share in territorial gains.|$|E
5|$|Helium {{is used as}} a {{component}} of breathing gases to replace nitrogen, due its low solubility in fluids, especially in lipids. Gases are absorbed by the blood and body tissues when under pressure like in scuba diving, which causes an anesthetic effect known as nitrogen narcosis. Due to its reduced solubility, little helium is taken into cell membranes, and when helium is used to replace part of the breathing mixtures, such as in trimix or heliox, a decrease in the narcotic effect of the gas at depth is obtained. Helium's reduced solubility offers further <b>advantages</b> <b>for</b> the condition known as decompression sickness, or the bends. The reduced amount of dissolved gas in the body means that fewer gas bubbles form during the decrease in pressure of the ascent. Another noble gas, argon, is considered the best option for use as a drysuit inflation gas for scuba diving. Helium is also used as filling gas in nuclear fuel rods for nuclear reactors.|$|E
30|$|Sixteen {{items in}} Germany and 11 items in Switzerland were {{identified}} with DIF. In Germany, 8 of the 16 items provided an <b>advantage</b> <b>for</b> the industrial clerks, and 8 provided an <b>advantage</b> <b>for</b> the logistic clerks. In Switzerland, DIF was equally distributed across the branches: 5 items provided an <b>advantage</b> <b>for</b> the industrial clerks, and 6 provided an <b>advantage</b> <b>for</b> the logistic clerks. An advantage {{means that the}} item difficulty is lower for this group than for the other group. The differences in item difficulty {{between the two groups}} varied between 0.26 and 1.26 logist, which is approximately 0.5 to 2.3 times the standard deviation of the latent variable (GermanySD =  0.84, SwitzerlandSD =  0.54). The share of items that provided an <b>advantage</b> <b>for</b> the reference respondents of the focal group is approximately 50 / 50. The following are examples of the DIF items (the items with the strongest DIF) that were given one time with an <b>advantage</b> <b>for</b> the industrial clerks and one time for the logistic clerks for each country separately (Fig.  4).|$|R

5|$|In 972 Oswald {{was made}} Archbishop of York and journeyed to Rome {{to receive a}} pallium from Pope John XIII. It is {{possible}} that he also traveled on Edgar's behalf {{to the court of}} the Emperor Otto I, and that these two journeys had been combined. He continued to hold the see of Worcester in addition to York. The holding of Worcester in addition to York became traditional for almost the next fifty years. Although it was uncanonical, it had many <b>advantages</b> <b>for</b> York in that it added a much richer diocese to their holdings, and one which was more peaceful as well. When Edgar died in 975, Ælfhere, Ealdorman of Mercia, broke up many monastic communities, some of which were Oswald's foundations. Ramsey, however, was not disturbed, probably due to the patronage of Æthelwine, Ealdorman of East Anglia, son of Æthelstan Half-King. Ælfhere was a supporter of Ethelred the Unready, the son of Edgar's third marriage, while Oswald supported the son of Edgar's first marriage, Edward the Martyr, in the dispute over who would succeed King Edgar.|$|E
5|$|Silicon carbide is a {{semiconductor}} {{in research}} and early mass production providing <b>advantages</b> <b>for</b> fast, high-temperature and/or high-voltage devices. The first devices available were Schottky diodes, followed by junction-gate FETs and MOSFETs for high-power switching. Bipolar transistors and thyristors are currently developed. A major problem for SiC commercialization has been the elimination of defects: edge dislocations, screw dislocations (both hollow and closed core), triangular defects and basal plane dislocations. As a result, devices made of SiC crystals initially displayed poor reverse blocking performance though researchers have been tentatively finding solutions to improve the breakdown performance. Apart from crystal quality, problems with the interface of SiC with silicon dioxide have hampered the development of SiC-based power MOSFETs and insulated-gate bipolar transistors. Although the mechanism is still unclear, nitridation has dramatically reduced the defects causing the interface problems. In 2008, the first commercial JFETs rated at 1200 V {{were introduced to the}} market, followed in 2011 by the first commercial MOSFETs rated at 1200 V. Beside SiC switches and SiC Schottky diodes (also Schottky barrier diode, SBD) in the popular TO-247 and TO-220 packages, companies started even earlier to implement the bare chips into their power electronic modules. SiC SBD diodes found wide market spread being used in PFC circuits and IGBT power modules.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Kupres was {{the first}} {{concrete}} result of the renewed BosniakCroat alliance in the Bosnian War, and the advance to Kupres {{was the first}} military effort coordinated between the ARBiH and the HVO since the Washington Agreement. Following the victory, morale of the ARBiH and the HVO soared. Further <b>advantages</b> <b>for</b> them were the recapture of initiative from the VRS and full control of the Split–Livno–Kupres–Bugojno road, allowing improved logistics of the ARBiH and the HVO in the area, as well as greater volume of transport of arms and ammunition, especially after the United States unilaterally ended the arms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina in November 1994. The move in effect allowed the HV to supply itself as the arms shipments flowed through Croatia. Finally, {{the outcome of the}} Battle of Kupres secured the right flank of the Livanjsko field, which became especially significant later that month when Operation Winter '94 was launched by the HV and the HVO northwest of Livno in order to draw off a part of the force besieging Bihać and prevent capture of Bihać by the VRS. The battle {{is considered to be a}} significant contribution to subsequent success of the HV in the Croatian War of Independence and the Bosnian War.|$|E

5|$|The heavy isotope 15N {{was first}} {{discovered}} by S. M. Naudé in 1929, soon after heavy isotopes of the neighbouring elements oxygen and carbon were discovered. It presents {{one of the}} lowest thermal neutron capture cross-sections of all isotopes. It is frequently used in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the structures of nitrogen-containing molecules, due to its fractional nuclear spin of one-half, which offers <b>advantages</b> <b>for</b> NMR such as narrower line width. 14N, though also theoretically usable, has an integer nuclear spin of one and thus has a quadrupole moment that leads to wider and less useful spectra. 15N NMR nevertheless has complications not encountered in the more 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The low natural abundance of 15N (0.36%) significantly reduces sensitivity, a problem which is only exacerbated by its low gyromagnetic ratio, (only 10.14% that of 1H). As a result, the signal-to-noise ratio for 1H is about 300 times as much as that for 15N at the same magnetic field strength. This may be somewhat alleviated by isotopic enrichment of 15N by chemical exchange or fractional distillation. 15N-enriched compounds have the advantage that under standard conditions, they do not undergo chemical exchange of their nitrogen atoms with atmospheric nitrogen, unlike compounds with labelled hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen isotopes that must be kept away from the atmosphere. The 15N:14N ratio is commonly used in stable isotope analysis in the fields of geochemistry, hydrology, paleoclimatology and paleoceanography, where it is called δ15N.|$|E
5|$|The sauropods {{were the}} largest and {{heaviest}} dinosaurs. For much of the dinosaur era, the smallest sauropods were larger {{than anything else in}} their habitat, and the largest were an order of magnitude more massive than anything else that has since walked the Earth. Giant prehistoric mammals such as Paraceratherium (the largest land mammal ever) were dwarfed by the giant sauropods, and only modern whales approach or surpass them in size. There are several proposed <b>advantages</b> <b>for</b> the large size of sauropods, including protection from predation, reduction of energy use, and longevity, but {{it may be that the}} most important advantage was dietary. Large animals are more efficient at digestion than small animals, because food spends more time in their digestive systems. This also permits them to subsist on food with lower nutritive value than smaller animals. Sauropod remains are mostly found in rock formations interpreted as dry or seasonally dry, and the ability to eat large quantities of low-nutrient browse would have been advantageous in such environments.|$|E
