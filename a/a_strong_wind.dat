5|$|Upon {{being named}} Nancy on February13, a gale warning {{was put in}} place for American Samoa. Later that day, four {{additional}} countries were placed under watches and warnings. A gale watch was declared for Samoa and strong wind warnings were raised in Tuvalu, Tokelau and the Cook Islands. On February14, a tropical cyclone alert was declared for the southern Cook Islands. Additionally, Niue was placed under <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> warning. Later that day, Wallis and Futuna were placed under <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> warning. On February15, a hurricane warning was issued for the southern Cook Islands as Nancy tracked through the archipelago.|$|E

5|$|At 23:00 on 30 March, with <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> {{from the}} south, Guillaume Tell sailed from Valletta, Decrés hoping {{to use the}} cover of {{darkness}} to escape the British blockade. Dixon had deployed his ships around the island, with Valletta watched by the frigate HMS Penelope under Captain Henry Blackwood. At 23:55, Blackwood's lookouts spotted Guillaume Tell and the captain gave chase, ordering the brig HMS Minorca under Commander George Miller to convey the message to Dixon, whose ships were just visible in the distance. Blackwood also attempted to signal his discovery to his commanding officer as Penelope gave chase.|$|E

5|$|Early on February 10, RSMC Nadi placed Niuafo'ou and Niuatoputapu under a {{tropical}} cyclone alert, before {{early the next}} day extending the alert to the whole of Tonga. Later that day the Vavau, Haapai, and Nomuka islands were placed under a gale warning. The warnings stayed in force until late on February 12 when the gale warning was canceled, and concurrently, southern Tonga was placed under {{a tropical}} cyclone warning. These warnings were canceled on February 14. During the cyclone, RSMC Nadi placed the Lau Islands under <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> warning, and a damaging swell warning was declared for Fiji. Businesses in Nuku'alofa closed as the storm passed by.|$|E
5|$|The Welsh {{performance}} during the 1893 Home Nations Championship was {{in stark contrast}} to the previous year. Under the captaincy of Gould, Wales not only won the Championship for the first time, but also the Triple Crown. The first match of the campaign was against England, and played at the Cardiff Arms Park. The pitch had been kept from freezing over the night before by 500 braziers dispersed across the playing field. This led to a slippery ground, with play further hampered by <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>wind.</b>|$|E
5|$|As Krovanh was {{approaching}} the Philippines, Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau cautioned {{the residents of}} the island against strong winds and warning ships in the Bashi Channel. After the typhoon entered the South China Sea, sea warnings were issued for areas offshore Hainan. Additional warnings were issued and expanded as Krovanh moved closer to the Chinese coast. In preparation for the storm, shipping routes across the Qiongzhou Strait were suspended, while security measures for river dykes and reservoirs were strengthened in both Hainan and Guangdong. In Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Observatory issued a Standby Signal No.1 on August23, which was upgraded to <b>a</b> <b>Strong</b> <b>Wind</b> Signal No.3 at around noon the following day. All warning signals in Hong Kong were discontinued on August25. In Guangzhou, 15flights were cancelled in anticipation of Krovanh, stranding 500passengers.|$|E

5|$|As Tam was developing, {{residents}} {{attempted to}} evacuate the island by plane, with the primary target of Fiji. Only a few flights took off before officials closed the airport, stranding numerous passengers. Late on January 11, RSMC Nadi placed Tonga and Futuna under a tropical cyclone alert and also placed Tonga and Wallis under <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> warning. Early the next day RSMC Nadi placed northern Tonga under a tropical cyclone gale warning. Later that morning they canceled the tropical cyclone alert for Wallis and Futuna as Tam was not expected to directly affect Futuna anymore. During that afternoon RSMC Nadi placed Niue under a Tropical cyclone alert, as they predicted that Niue {{would be affected by}} Tam within 24 hours. Early on January 13 RSMC Nadi cancelled the tropical cyclone warnings and alerts for Tonga, whilst at the same time placing Niue under a tropical cyclone gale warning, however this gale warning was canceled later that day as Tam moved into the southern ocean.|$|E
5|$|The {{shape of}} the dune depends on the {{characteristics}} of the prevailing wind. Barchan dunes are produced by strong winds blowing across a level surface, and are crescent-shaped with the concave side away from the wind. When there are two directions from which winds regularly blow, a series of long, linear dunes known as seif dunes may form. These also occur parallel to <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> that blows in one general direction. Transverse dunes run at a right angle to the prevailing wind direction. Star dunes are formed by variable winds, and have several ridges and slip faces radiating from a central point. They tend to grow vertically; they can reach a height of , making them the tallest type of dune. Rounded mounds of sand without a slip face are the rare dome dunes, found on the upwind edges of sand seas.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{warnings}} {{were issued}} {{throughout the course}} of the cyclone. The first cyclone watch related to Cyclone Winifred was declared by the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) on 29January for various locations in Queensland, spanning from Thursday Island to Cooktown, and was adjusted as Winifred approached. The initial cyclone warning was issued on the morning of 30January, stretching between Cape Flattery and Townsville, while the previous cyclone watch was expanded to cover areas from Lockhart River to St Lawrence. The warning was later extended to reach Cooktown and Bowen, and was further lengthened to span regions from Cairns to St Lawrence. On the morning of 1February, observations indicated that the cyclone had suddenly veered toward the coast, and a Flash Tropical Cyclone Advice was subsequently released, noting the potential for powerful winds between Fitzroy Island and Innisfail. In conjunction, the Queensland Flood Warning Centre initiated flood warnings along the Tully, Herbert, Bulloo, Barcoo, Thomson, Diamantina, and Cooper waterways. The BoM also imposed a gale warning stretching from Cooktown to Cardwell, accompanied <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> warning between Cape Melville and Gladstone.|$|E

5|$|The {{technique}} of flight among procellariids depends on foraging methods. Compared {{to an average}} bird, all procellariids have a high aspect ratio (meaning their wings are long and narrow) and a heavy wing loading. Therefore, they must maintain a high speed {{in order to remain}} in the air. Most procellariids use two techniques to do this, namely, dynamic soaring and slope soaring. Dynamic soaring involves gliding across wave fronts, thus taking advantage of the vertical wind gradient and minimising the effort required to stay in the air. Slope soaring is more straightforward: the procellariid turns to the wind, gaining height, from where it can then glide back down to the sea. Most procellariids aid their flight by means of flap-glides, where bursts of flapping are followed by a period of gliding; the amount of flapping dependent on the strength of the wind and the choppiness of the water. Shearwaters and other larger petrels, which have lower aspect ratio, must make more use of flapping to remain airborne than gadfly petrels. Because of the high speeds required for flight, procellariids need to either run or face into <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> in order to take off.|$|E

25|$|Ricky Stanzi had {{perhaps his}} worst game as Iowa's quarterback, {{throwing}} five interceptions, {{four in the}} third quarter as the Hawkeye offense played into <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> from the north. He and his team were able to recover in the fourth quarter, however, as Stanzi found Marvin McNutt for a 92-yard touchdown pass then on the next offensive play, connected with Derrell Johnson-Koulianos for a score from 66 yards out that would put Iowa up for good.|$|E
25|$|A {{horizontal}} {{temperature gradient}} exists while moving North-South along a meridian because {{curvature of the}} Earth allows for more solar heating at the equator than at the poles. This creates a westerly geostrophic wind pattern to form in the mid-latitudes. Because thermal wind causes an increase in wind velocity with height, the westerly pattern increases in intensity up until the tropopause, creating <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> current known as the jet stream. The Northern and Southern Hemispheres exhibit similar jet stream patterns in the mid-latitudes.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the Wright brothers' design of a controllable airplane that could fly against <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>wind</b> and land on solid ground, Langley sought safety by practicing in calm air over the Potomac River. This required a catapult for launching. The craft had no landing gear, the plan being to descend into the water after demonstrating flight which if successful would entail a partial, if not total, rebuilding of the machine. Langley gave up the project after two crashes on take-off on October 7 and December 8, 1903.|$|E
