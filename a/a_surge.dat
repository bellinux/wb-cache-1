5|$|According to IndieWire in May 2017, Amblin Television and Warner Bros. Animation are in {{the early}} stages of {{developing}} a reboot of Animaniacs. The interest in the reboot was driven by <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> of popularity for the show when it was made available on Netflix in 2016, plus numerous successful projects that have revived interest in older shows, such as Fuller House.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to female political figures, Traister also discusses {{women in the}} media who played influential roles in the election coverage. These include Rachel Maddow, whose political commentary led to <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> in her popularity; television journalist Katie Couric, who led a critical interview with Sarah Palin; and Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, who parodied Palin and Clinton, respectively, in several Saturday Night Live skits.|$|E
5|$|In the Late Classic {{the site}} {{appears to have}} {{recovered}} from its earlier defeat. Naranjo-style ceramics diminished greatly in quantity and there was <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> in new large-scale construction. Many monuments broken by the conquerors were re-erected at this time.|$|E

5|$|Shoe {{manufacturing}} {{improvements in}} the mid-19th century allowed for factories to produce large numbers of shoes made of leather, and later synthetic materials. This increase in leather shoe production continued well into the 20th century and led to <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> {{in the number of}} retail shoe stores in the industrialized world, and subsequently a call for shoe polish by footwear consumers.|$|E
5|$|The Apollo {{program also}} {{affected}} environmental activism in the 1970s due to photos {{taken by the}} astronauts. The most famous, taken by the Apollo 17 astronauts, is The Blue Marble. This image, which was released during <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> in environmentalism, {{became a symbol of}} the environmental movement, as a depiction of Earth's frailty, vulnerability, and isolation amid the vast expanse of space.|$|E
5|$|The arrests brought <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> {{of media}} {{coverage}} to the sit-in campaign, including national television news coverage, front page stories {{in both of}} Nashville's daily newspapers, and an Associated Press story. The students generally viewed any media coverage as helpful to their cause, especially when it illustrated their commitment to nonviolence.|$|E

5|$|Water {{can also}} be sucked away from shore prior to <b>a</b> storm <b>surge.</b> This was the case on the western Florida coast in 2017, just before Hurricane Irma made landfall, {{uncovering}} land usually underwater.

5|$|The {{popularity}} of shoe polish paralleled a general rise in leather and synthetic shoe production, {{beginning in the}} 19th century and continuing into the 20th. The World Wars saw <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> in demand for the product, in order to polish army boots.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} {{argument in}} favor of dualism is that the mental and the physical seem to have quite different, and perhaps irreconcilable, properties. Mental events have a subjective quality, whereas physical events do not. So, for example, one can reasonably ask what a burnt finger feels like, or what a blue sky looks like, or what nice music sounds like to a person. But it is meaningless, or at least odd, to ask what <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> in the uptake of glutamate in the dorsolateral portion of the hippocampus feels like.|$|E
5|$|Between 1907 and 1917, the League for Women's Equal Rights was {{the most}} {{important}} feminist organization in Russia. Like the Russian Women's Mutual Philanthropic Society, it was focused on education and social welfare, but it also pushed for equal rights for women, including suffrage, equal inheritance, and an end to passport restrictions. The 1917 Revolution, catalyzed in part by women workers' demonstrations, generated <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> of membership in the organization. In the same year, because of the society's continued lobbying, Russia became the first major world power to grant women the right to vote.|$|E

5|$|During {{the general}} election, Humphrey faced former Vice President Richard Nixon of New York, the Republican Party nominee. Nixon led in most polls {{throughout}} the campaign, and successfully criticized Humphrey's role in Vietnam, connecting {{him to the}} unpopular president and the general disorder in the nation. Humphrey experienced <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> in the polls in the days prior to the election, largely due to incremental progress {{in the peace process}} in Vietnam and a break with the Johnson war policy, but was defeated by Nixon on Election Day.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1990s, the park {{experienced}} <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> in vandalism, littering, and wildfires caused by off-roading, and Roxy Ann Road became nearly impassable {{because of lack}} of maintenance. Medford police officers had to devote much of their time to patrolling the mountain, made difficult by the park's remote location. To alleviate these problems, the city regraded Roxy Ann Road in 1998, and installed two gates near the park entrance two years later. By 2006, vandalism had decreased by 70 percent.|$|E
5|$|In {{his early}} years, Bonds batted as the leadoff hitter. With Van Slyke {{also in the}} outfield, the Pirates had a venerable {{defensive}} tandem that worked together to cover {{a lot of ground}} on the field although they were not close off the field. The Pirates experienced <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> in fan enthusiasm with Bonds on the team and set the club attendance record of 52,119 in the 1987 home opener. That year, he hit 25home runs in his second season, along with 32stolen bases and 59RBIs.|$|E
50|$|The 1990's was {{remembered as}} a time of strong {{economic}} growth, steady job creation, low inflation, rising productivity, economic boom, and <b>a</b> <b>surging</b> stock market that resulted {{from a combination of}} rapid technological changes and sound central monetary policy.|$|R

5|$|In recent years, FAU has {{increased}} its admission requirements for prospective freshmen. The fall 2013 freshmen profile for the mid-50% includes 3.38-3.98 high school GPA, a 22-26 ACT composite score, and a 1520-1740 SAT total score. Following <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> in the university's popularity, in early 2009, the university created its first wait-list for undergraduate enrollment. After February 15, 2009, applicants for admission in the 2009–2010 academic year were required to have a 3.5 GPA or an SAT score of 1600 {{to be considered for}} admission.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the famine, an increase in industrial production and <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> in trade brought a succession of construction booms. The population soared {{in the latter part of}} this century and the architectural legacy of Georgian Ireland was built. In 1782, Poynings' Law was repealed, giving Ireland legislative independence from Great Britain for the first time since 1495. The British government, however, still retained the right to nominate the government of Ireland without the consent of the Irish parliament.|$|E
5|$|The Discovery Expedition {{was planned}} during <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> of {{international}} {{interest in the}} Antarctic regions {{at the turn of}} the 19th and 20th centuries. A German expedition under Erich von Drygalski was leaving at about the same time as Discovery, to explore the sector of the continent south of the Indian Ocean. The Swedish explorer Otto Nordenskiöld was leading an expedition to Graham Land, and a French expedition under Jean-Baptiste Charcot was going to the Antarctic Peninsula. Finally, the Scottish scientist William Speirs Bruce was leading a scientific expedition to the Weddell Sea.|$|E

40|$|In a 1917 {{letter to}} Gershom Scholem, Walter Benjamin writes, “Theory is like <b>a</b> <b>surging</b> sea. ” This small book {{takes more than}} its title from that line—it takes that line {{as a point of}} {{departure}} in Erich Auerbach’s sense, an *Ansatzpunkt,* as a compositional principle so that what follows can be read in its entirety as a gloss on the remainder of Benjamin’s sentence: “Theory is like <b>a</b> <b>surging</b> sea, but {{the only thing that matters}} to the wave […] is to surrender itself to its motion in such a way that it crests and breaks. ” That motion, in the pages to follow, takes up in its sweep two threads: it folds an episodic meditation on the negative and the problematic into a series of singular interrogations exemplary of the positive being of the problematic, the objective being of problems and questions, in a movement of implication and explication between poetry and philosophy in the tradition of what’s come to be known as theory. Theory is like <b>a</b> <b>surging</b> sea because it’s as part of a revolutionary tradition that it crests and breaks...|$|R

5|$|The {{earliest}} published {{discovery of}} a moon other than the Earth's was by Galileo Galilei, who discovered the four Galilean moons orbiting Jupiter in 1610. Over the following three centuries only a few more moons were discovered. Missions to other planets in the 1970s, most notably the Voyager 1 and 2 missions, saw <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> {{in the number of}} moons detected, and observations since the year 2000, using mostly large, ground-based optical telescopes, have discovered many more, all of which are irregular.|$|E
5|$|The first filmed {{scenes of}} Iris were shot in Akita, Japan on March 10, 2009. Lee Byung-hun's {{popularity}} in Japan caused the series and its production to gain immediate notability in the country. Lee's filming was often shadowed by fans, beginning with thousands greeting him at Akita Airport upon his arrival. Due to several pivotal {{moments of the}} series being filmed in the prefecture, Akita soon experienced <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> of Korean tourists going on tours tailored to followers of the show. The crew went on to shoot in Japan for three weeks and left the country on March 28.|$|E
