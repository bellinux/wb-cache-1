40|$|Mixed <b>age</b> <b>classes</b> {{has been}} a part of the Swedish {{education}} system from its beginning and used to be its norm. During the 1970 ’s the practice of having mixed <b>age</b> <b>classes</b> saw a new spring as it was deemed to have educational advantages, and since then there {{has been a}}n ongoing debate among teachers, researchers, parents and politicians regarding how, and in what way, the advantages actually manifest themselves. Earlier research shows different results where some scholars find that mixed <b>age</b> <b>classes</b> have a negative effect on children’s academic and social development. Others find it hard to show that supposed negative effects are caused by the mixed <b>aged</b> <b>class,</b> while others still find that being in a mixed class has neither positive nor negative effects on the children. This essay analyses the problem by interviewing five teachers who all have a professional history where they at some point have teached mixed <b>age</b> <b>classes</b> as well as age homogenous ones. Through the use of the interviews the essay tries to contribute to the scientific understanding of mixed <b>age</b> <b>classes</b> by adding knowledge of how teachers experience the social and academic development of their pupils. To reach this purpose I start out with the following two research questions: How do teachers view the social development of their pupils in mixed <b>age</b> <b>classes?</b> How do teachers view the academic development of their pupils in mixed <b>age</b> <b>classes?</b> The results of the study show that in the teachers’ experiences, mixed <b>age</b> <b>classes</b> have a positive influence on the social development of their pupils. At the same time, however, the teachers feel that there are negative effects on the academic development, particularly within the fields of mathematics and Swedish. The result is then discussed in regards to what it may mean for Swedish schools in the short and the long run as well as if it can lead to social problems and what implications there are for what kind of people we wish to foster. ...|$|R

2500|$|A {{fourth class}} of racing in BMX which are held at local and {{national}} events are called Opens. Opens are largely exhibition and are a chance to test yourself and practice against better competition without jeopardizing your point standings. You must be registered to race in a points race {{to sign up for}} the Open events. No points are awarded for Opens although trophy places are and the moto qualification rounds are similar to the point races. These are races with more flexible skill level and age requirements. In Opens there are no Novice, Intermediate and Expert divisions. All amateur skill levels are free to participate. The age groupings are generally broader, for example 13-14 open class as opposed to 13 Intermediate and 14 Intermediate being separate groupings for those ages in the points races. Girls may also participate in the male Open class within the proper age ranges. However expert boys are not allowed in these [...] "Mixed" [...] opens. Then an Expert Open is held in that event. The pros are excluded from racing with the amateurs if enough pros are at hand to race that a separate Pro-Open class can be created. If not, then the pros can race in the amateur Open with some restrictions. This is called a Pro-Am event. Except for the Pro-Am exception the Expert racers usually wins the open class.
