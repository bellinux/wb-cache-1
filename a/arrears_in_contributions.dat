Among {{the findings of the}} paper are: contrary to the standard view of an ongoing "inter-enterprise <b>arrears</b> crisis" <b>in</b> Russia, levels of trade credit <b>arrears</b> <b>in</b> Russia are compable to those found both in other transition countries and in Western market economies; trade credit arrears and inflation are closely inversely correlated, the likely reason being that when macro policy is being tightened, firms try to create liquidity by extending payment periods; basic credit control mechanisms are in wide use by firms; and financially-distressed firms raise the priority of paying suppliers and lower the priority of paying taxes, with the result that tax arrears are significantly concentrated in financially-distressed firms. The paper concludes with a discussion of policy options. ...|$|R
