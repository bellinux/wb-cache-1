As these scenarios work the same as other virtual reality scenarios, they are not exempt from the negative results that can be seen across the board from these sorts of systems, and patients have shown this to be evident.

25|$|Callwell’s 2 volume “Life and Diaries” in 1927 damaged Wilson’s {{reputation}} – the “New Statesman” {{thought they}} showed {{him to be}} “the typically stupid militarist…fundamentally a fool” Sir Charles Deedes, who had studied under him at Staff College and later served on his staff, commented that Wilson came across in the diaries as “an ambitious, volatile and even fatuous character, an intriguer concerned mainly with his own career” {{and that this was}} “far from the truth” – Deedes commented that Wilson’s ability to see both sides of a question and inability to make a decision <b>and</b> <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> it made him a poor corps commander but a “patient, lucid and fair” adviser. Lloyd George’s view in his own “War Memoirs” was essentially similar, although he wrote that Wilson was reluctant to take responsibility for decisions.|$|E
25|$|Cowdrey tended towards {{caution and}} drew 15 of his 27 Tests in command, but won eight Tests, lost only four (two each to Australia and the West Indies). For {{one reason or}} another he only captained England in two full series, against South Africa in 1960 and the West Indies in 1967–68, and won both. He was a shrewd cricket captain with years of experience; Tom Graveney thought him the best captain he served under, and Graveney played under every England captain from 1951 to 1969. In the field Cowdrey {{preferred}} to set the best field for his bowlers <b>and</b> <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> it rather than make constant changes. His greatest asset was the care he took over his players, always thanking bowlers after they had bowled a spell and batsmen when they returned to the pavilion.|$|E

500|$|To explain each form, Russell {{provides}} illustrations. The {{power of}} mere force {{is like the}} tying of a rope around a pig's belly and lifting {{it up to a}} ship while ignoring its cries. The power of inducements is likened to two things: either conditioning, as exemplified by circus animals which have been trained to perform this-or-that trick for an audience, or group acquiescence, as when the leader among sheep is dragged along by chains to get the rest of the flock to follow. Finally, the power of propaganda is akin to the use of carrot <b>and</b> <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> influence the behaviour of a donkey, {{in the sense that the}} donkey is being persuaded that making certain actions (following the carrot, avoiding the stick) would be more or less to their benefit.

500|$|Having officially {{formed a}} band {{under the name}} Late of the Pier in 2004, {{childhood}} friends Sam Eastgate, Andrew Faley, Sam Potter, and the late Ross Dawson initially developed {{the sound of their}} first album by listening to the alternative dance music of British ensemble The Prodigy and the grunge music of American band Nirvana. They soon branched out into listening to diverse genres from the last 40 years of music, including Motown and soul. Potter has treated their conception of Fantasy Black Channel as a reaction to [...] "mediocre, complacent indie-schmindie bands who find a sound <b>and</b> <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> it; whose songs sound exactly the same", while lead writer and composer Eastgate has pointed out that they wanted to [...] "take people past their own limits". The nascent recording stages took place in Eastgate's bedroom, where unconventional time signatures and experimental chords were performed because, at the time, no band member could play an instrument properly.|$|E
500|$|Madonna's {{music has}} been the subject of much {{analysis}} and scrutiny. Robert M. Grant, author of Contemporary Strategy Analysis (2005), commented that what has brought Madonna success is [...] "certainly not outstanding natural talent. As a vocalist, musician, dancer, songwriter, or actress, Madonna's talents seem modest." [...] He asserts Madonna's success is in relying on the talents of others, and that her personal relationships have served as cornerstones to the numerous reinventions in the longevity of her career. Madonna's approach was far from the music industry wisdom of [...] "Find a winning formula <b>and</b> <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> it." [...] Her musical career has been a continuous experimentation with new musical ideas and new images and a constant quest for new heights of fame and acclaim. Grant concluded that [...] "having established herself as the queen of popular music, Madonna did not stop there, but continued re-inventing." [...] Musicologist Susan McClary wrote that [...] "Madonna's art itself repeatedly deconstructs the traditional notion of the unified subject with finite ego boundaries. Her pieces explore various ways of constituting identities that refuse stability, that remain fluid, that resist definition." [...] According to Thomas Harrison in the book Pop Goes the Decade: The Eighties, Madonna was [...] "an artist who pushed the boundaries" [...] of what a female singer could do, both visually and lyrically.|$|E

In its opening weekend, the film grossed $2.5million ($ in [...] dollars), becoming the tenth highest-grossing film of that week. The next week it had a 60% decline in sales. The film grossed a total of $7.3million ($ in [...] dollars) worldwide, and was a box office bomb. It was placed at 97 on the top 100 movies of 1987 list. Morton noted that although [...] "Madonna's comic talent was acknowledged, cinemagoers in the United States stayed away in droves." [...] The film was better accepted in the foreign released territories, prompting Madonna to defend herself, rather weakly, that her ideas were better accepted in Europe and Japan, rather than her home country. She added, [...] "I think the movie did badly in America because I upstaged it with my tour. People were confused about the connection between the record, the tour and the movie because they all had the same title. I also think there are people who don't want me to do well in both fields. I had to really fight to get any respect from the music business and now I guess {{there are some people who}} feel that I ought to be grateful for that respect <b>and</b> <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> music." [...] Nevertheless, Warner Bros. decided to release the film in home media in VHS on November 11, 1987, a decision not approved by Madonna.|$|E

500|$|Returning to the West End, Gielgud {{starred in}} JBPriestley's The Good Companions, adapted {{for the stage}} by the author and Edward Knoblock. The {{production}} ran from May 1931 for 331 performances, and Gielgud described it as his first real taste of commercial success. He played Inigo Jollifant, a young schoolmaster who abandons teaching to join a travelling theatre troupe. This crowd-pleaser drew disapproval from the more austere reviewers, who felt Gielgud should be doing something more demanding, but he found playing a conventional juvenile lead had challenges of its own and helped him improve his technique. During {{the run of the}} play he made another film, Insult (1932), a melodrama about the French Foreign Legion, and he starred in a cinema version of The Good Companions in 1933, with Jessie Matthews. A letter to a friend reveals Gielgud's view of film acting: [...] "There is talk of my doing Inigo in the film of The Good Companions, which appals my soul but appeals to my pocket." [...] In his first volume of memoirs, published in 1939, Gielgud devoted two pages to describing the things about filming that he detested. Unlike his contemporaries Richardson and Laurence Olivier, he made few films until after the Second World War, and did not establish himself as a prominent film actor until many years after that. As he put it in 1994, [...] "I was stupid enough to toss my head <b>and</b> <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> the stage while watching Larry and Ralph sign lucrative Korda contracts." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{carbon content}} of steel greatly affects its machinability. High-carbon steels are {{difficult}} to machine because they are strong and because they may contain carbides that abrade the cutting tool.

Low-carbon steels are [...] "gummy" [...] <b>and</b> <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> the cutting tool, resulting in a built up edge that shortens tool life.

2500|$|The {{creature}} {{is covered with}} parasites, which it sheds {{as part of a}} [...] "post-birth ritual". [...] Abrams described the parasites as [...] "horrifying, dog-sized creatures that just scatter around the city and add to the nightmare of the evening". Reeves added that [...] "The parasites have a voracious, rabid, bounding nature, but they also have a crab-like crawl. They have the viciousness of a dog, but with the ability to climb walls <b>and</b> <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> objects." [...] The top half of the parasite's head is the mandible. The top and lower jaws end in serrated edges and have four pairs of eyes each. The rest of the parasite consists of a crustacean-like carapace, several pairs of claws, and arms. A deep blue-purple muscular membrane stretches between the top and lower jaws. When a human is bitten, the victim becomes ill and bleeds profusely, mainly from the eyes, and shortly after this, the torso expands and explodes. They are called HSPs (Human Scale Parasites) on the Blu-ray Special Investigation Mode.|$|E

[...] Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music criticized the band for mixing [...] "cast-off recordings with previously released album tracks and present it as a new mini-album" [...] and felt that the Saturdays are [...] "in some kind of decline". He said [...] "what you get for your money are two potential future hits, four songs you probably already own, one slightly mad album track – Puppet – and a solid-gold clunker" [...] and noticed that it is not [...] "a mini-album, it's a double A-side, or an EP at best." [...] Simon Gage of the Daily Express said that although the album is [...] "not exactly bad", it sounds [...] "much like everything else out there" [...] and [...] "in the parlance of the kids it’s aimed at, a bit “whatever”". [...] Jaime Gill of Yahoo! Music complimented the songs [...] "Higher" [...] and [...] "Puppet", but said that [...] "if the intention is to whip up a storm of excitement, [...] then it's a case of mission unaccomplished". Hazel Sheffield of NME called the album [...] "a summer hatchet-job" [...] and although she praised the single [...] "Missing You", she felt that [...] "the rest is filler in Rihanna's slipstream" [...] and awarded the album five out of ten.|$|E
