He said, [...] "I am <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> anger {{because of how}} he did me. It {{is always going to}} be there. It is not going away. No way at all." [...] While basketball player Michael Jordan was Scott's childhood sports idol, he says Jordan was not the inspiration for his jersey number of 23. Scott chose it as a combination of his older brothers' high school numbers: James wore number 20, and Lee, Jr. wore number 3. Scott said, [...] "They were my father." ...|$|E

[...] While Zappa was in favor of the sexual revolution, he regarded himself as a pioneer in publicly discussing honesty about sexual intercourse, stating [...] "American sexual attitudes are controlled as a necessary tool of business and government in order to perpetuate themselves. Unless people begin to see through that, to see past it to, what sex is really all about, they're <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the same neurotic attitudes. It's very neatly packaged. It all works hand-in-hand with the churches and political leaders at the point, where elections are coming up."

2500|$|Sidwell {{made his}} last {{appearance}} on-screen as Steven on 9 May 2008, {{and he has}} since revealed that producers {{made the right decision}} in axing his character as his story arc had run its course: [...] "They really did try to keep Steven in. The problem is EastEnders is a realistic show, so with Steven being a larger-than-life character it was <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be hard <b>having</b> him doing the same crazy things day in, day out. I wasn't expecting to stay on the Square forever. It was my first big job out of drama college and I couldn't have asked for a better start in the industry. I've had a great time and the character isn't being killed off, so who knows what might happen a few years down the line. There's always the possibility I might be asked back one day".|$|R
6000|$|A fresh shower {{came down}} on their heads and the two trotted away, taking Mowgli with them. What Baloo had said about the monkeys was {{perfectly}} true. They belonged to the tree-tops, and as beasts very seldom look up, there was no occasion for the monkeys and the Jungle-People to cross each other's path. But whenever they found a sick wolf, or a wounded tiger, or bear, the monkeys would torment him, and would throw sticks and nuts at any beast for fun and {{in the hope of}} being noticed. Then they would howl and shriek senseless songs, and invite the Jungle-People to climb up their trees and fight them, or would start furious battles over nothing among themselves, and leave the dead monkeys where the Jungle-People could see them. They were <b>always</b> just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a leader, and laws and customs of their own, but they never did, because their memories would not hold over from day to day, and so they compromised things by making up a saying, [...] "What the Bandar-log think now the jungle will think later," [...] and that comforted them a great deal. None of the beasts could reach them, {{but on the other hand}} none of the beasts would notice them, and that was why they were so pleased when Mowgli came to play with them, and they heard how angry Baloo was.|$|R
6000|$|The Dodsons were {{certainly}} a handsome family, and Mrs. Glegg {{was not the}} least handsome of the sisters. As she sat in Mrs. Tulliver's arm-chair, no impartial observer could have denied that for a woman of fifty {{she had a very}} comely face and figure, though Tom and Maggie considered their aunt Glegg as the type of ugliness. It is true she despised the advantages of costume, for though, as she often observed, no woman had better clothes, it was not her way to wear her new things out before her old ones. Other women, if they liked, might have their best thread-lace in every wash; but when Mrs. Glegg died, it would be found that she had better lace laid by in the right-hand drawer of her wardrobe in the Spotted Chamber than ever Mrs. Wooll of St. Ogg's had bought in her life, although Mrs. Wooll wore her lace before it was paid for. So of her curled fronts: Mrs. Glegg had doubtless the glossiest and crispest brown curls in her drawers, as well as curls in various degrees of fuzzy laxness; but to look out on the week-day world from under a crisp and glossy front would be to introduce a most dreamlike and unpleasant confusion between the sacred and the secular. Occasionally, indeed, Mrs. Glegg wore one of her third-best fronts on a week-day visit, but not at a sister's house; especially not at Mrs. Tulliver's, who, since her marriage, had hurt her sister's feelings greatly by wearing her own hair, though, as Mrs. Glegg observed to Mrs. Deane, a mother of a family, like Bessy, with a husband <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> law, might <b>have</b> been expected <b>to</b> know better. But Bessy was always weak! ...|$|R

About his role in Thor he stated, [...] "Agent Coulson was one of the guys who wasn't really in the comic books, and he [...] a very kind of small role in Iron Man. And I was just very lucky that they chose to expand that character and [...] to put him more into the universe of it." [...] After signing on to appear as Clint Barton / Hawkeye in The Avengers, Jeremy Renner made a cameo appearance as the character during a scene in Thor. Branagh said that they [...] "were <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a guy in a basket above the action where Thor breaks in the S.H.I.E.L.D. camp", and that he was thrilled when the producers told him they wanted to use Renner's Hawkeye for that role. The film ends with a post-credits scene featuring Loki, watching as Erik Selvig and Nick Fury discuss the Tesseract. The scene was directed by Joss Whedon, who directed The Avengers. Stellan Skarsgård, who played Selvig, said the scene was not included when he first read the screenplay for Thor, and that he was sent pages for the scene after agreeing to appear in The Avengers.|$|E

He is regularly booed in various arenas around the league, ranging from his appearances at the yearly NHL Entry Draft to his annual presentation of the Stanley Cup to the league champions {{at the end of}} the playoffs. When asked if the booing ever bothers him, Bettman said, [...] "Not doing this job, no. You're <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> critics.

2500|$|After leaving Morgan, Kiki {{immediately}} {{starts a}} romance with Michael. The pairing would pair Alderson {{back with her}} real-life boyfriend Chad Duell whom she worked with as Starr. Alderson worried about how fans would react to Kiki and Michael's relationship because Starr and Kiki are so different and [...] "it was interesting to see Michael with Kiki" [...] who is a lot less refined than Starr. However, the romance doesn't get much development, and ends a year later when Michael dumps Kiki after discovering she has been keeping quiet about Sonny's part {{in the murder of}} his biological father, A. J. Quartermaine (Sean Kanan). Hayley Erin later said, [...] "When she was with Michael, I don't think she was thinking about Michael." [...] While she was definitely fully invested in the relationship, Kiki also had feelings for Morgan. [...] "Michael wouldn't be good for her now."

2500|$|The {{characters}} of Rosario + Vampire have received criticism from publications dedicated to anime, manga, and other media. Theron Martin of Anime News Network describes Tsukune as a [...] "cookie-cutter harem male lead, an unfailingly kind-hearted, indecisive wimp who primarily has {{a thing for}} Moka but still treasures the other girls as friends." [...] Carlo Santos of Anime News Network, in reviewing the manga, noted Tsukune's character design as lazy: [...] "shove in any other male protagonist from a harem series and nobody would notice too much". He found the girls [...] "distinctive, if predictable (the beauty, the boobs, the jailbait)", but concluded in a later volume that [...] "The story's never going to go anywhere, the characters {{are never going to}} go anywhere, and the artwork is <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> that same polished-but-flawed look." [...] Stig Høgset of THEM Anime Reviews found Moka to be ditzy and a [...] "pink-haired dolt"; he criticized her lack of vampire weaknesses such as walking around in broad daylight at a beach, but found her alternate personality as [...] "pretty damn badass", [...] "a great addition to the show, if a severely underutilized one", and wished that her character was developed better. Deb Aoki of About.com called Moka a magical ditz who loves the doofus but also kicks butt. Neil Lumbard of DVD Talk noted that Kokoa is not another character that has a massive crush on the same guy; however, Høgset noted that her anime role was reduced to obnoxious comedy acts.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2013, CBS News {{broadcast}} a 60 Minutes {{critique of the}} doctrinal assessment, and interview of Farrell and Sartain. Sartain described his role as follows: [...] "In {{the context of the}} Church, we're <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the concern about being faithful to Christ. And all I can say to you [...] is I don't have any doubt about the reason why the Holy Father has asked me to do this, which is his genuine love and concern for religious women." [...] On the other hand, Farrell noted that there is disagreement over the meaning of vows of obedience for nuns: [...] "Well I think there is one of the areas of misunderstanding and difference. Our first obedience is to God. What we obey is God and God's call to us as expressed in so many different sources, it's not just the teaching authority of the Church, although that is certainly a legitimate part of it." [...] "We have never wanted the men to tell us what to do." [...] She added that the motivation of the inquisition by men in the Vatican appeared to be motivated by their fears rather than the love and concern Sartain cited. Farrell commented: [...] "I don't know, but it feels to me like fear. What would happen if women really were given a place of equality in the Church?" [...] The Holy See says [...] "good works aren't the issue, its annual meetings" [...] are the issue. [...] "It doesn't make sense," [...] Sartain reasoned about the speakers selected by the LCWR, [...] "that a conference of Women Religious would want to give a platform to somebody who would espouse ideas antithetical to what the Church teaches." ...|$|E

[...] The success of the [...] "Jeremy" [...] video helped catapult Pearl Jam to fame.
