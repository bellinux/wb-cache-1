40|$|AbstractThe {{formation}} of endocardial cushions in the <b>atrioventricular</b> (AV) <b>canal</b> of the rudimentary heart requires epithelial-to-mesenchymal cell transformation (EMT). This {{is a complex}} developmental process regulated by multiple extracellular signals and transduction pathways. A collagen gel assay, long used to examine endocardial cushion development in avian models, is now being employed to investigate genetically engineered mouse models with abnormal heart morphogenesis. In this study, we determine interspecies variations for avian and mouse cultured endocardial cushion explants. Considering these observed morphologic differences, we also define the temporal requirements for TGFβ 2 and TGFβ 3 during mouse endocardial cushion morphogenesis. TGFβ 2 and TGFβ 3 blocking antibodies inhibit endothelial cell activation and transformation, respectively, in avian explants. In contrast, neutralizing TGFβ 2 inhibits cell transformation in the mouse, while TGFβ 3 antibodies {{have no effect on}} activation or transformation events. This functional requirement for TGFβ 2 is concomitant with expression of TGFβ 2, but not TGFβ 3, within mouse endocardial cushions at a time coincident with transformation. Thus, both TGFβ 2 and TGFβ 3 appear necessary for the full morphogenetic program of EMT in the chick, but only TGFβ 2 is expressed and obligatory for mammalian endocardial cushion cell transformation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractEpithelial–mesenchymal {{transformation}} (EMT), {{the process}} by which epithelial cells are converted into motile, invasive mesenchymal cells, is critical to valvulogenesis. Transforming growth factor-β 3 (TGF-β 3), an established mediator of avian <b>atrioventricular</b> (AV) <b>canal</b> EMT, is secreted as a latent complex. In vitro, plasmin-mediated proteolysis has been shown to release active TGF-βs from the latent complex. Annexin II, a co-receptor for tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen, promotes cell-surface generation of the serine protease plasmin. Here, we show that annexin II-mediated plasmin activity regulates release of active TGF-β 3 during chick AV canal EMT. Primary embryonic endocardial-derived cells express annexin II which promotes plasminogen activation in vitro. Incubation of heart explant cultures with either α 2 antiplasmin (α 2 AP), a major physiological plasmin inhibitor, or anti-annexin II IgG, blocked EMT by ∼ 80 %, and 50 %, respectively. Anti-annexin II IgG-mediated inhibition of EMT was overcome by the addition of recombinant TGF-β 3. Upon treatment with anti-annexin II IgG or α 2 AP, conditioned medium from heart explant cultures showed absence of the active fragment of TGF-β 3 by Western blot analysis and a ∼ 50 % decrease in TGF-β specific bioactivity.
