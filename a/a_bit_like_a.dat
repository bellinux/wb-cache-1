5|$|While {{the stars}} are fixed to their declinations the Sun is not. The rising point of the Sun varies {{throughout}} the year. It swings between two limits marked by the solstices <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> pendulum, slowing as it reaches the extremes, but passing rapidly through the midpoint. If an archaeoastronomer can calculate from the azimuth and horizon height that a site was built to view a declination of +23.5° then he or she need not wait until 21 June to confirm the site does indeed face the summer solstice.

25|$|After new {{segments}} of rail are laid, or defective rails replaced (welded-in), the rails can be artificially stressed if {{the temperature of}} the rail during laying is cooler than what is desired. The stressing process involves either heating the rails, causing them to expand, or stretching the rails with hydraulic equipment. They are then fastened (clipped) to the sleepers in their expanded form. This process ensures that the rail will not expand much further in subsequent hot weather. In cold weather the rails try to contract, but because they are firmly fastened, cannot do so. In effect, stressed rails are <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> piece of stretched elastic firmly fastened down.|$|E

25|$|An older {{method of}} {{harvesting}} {{is to use}} a sweep net, which operates <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> purse seine net. The sweep net is a big net with weights along the bottom edge. It is stretched across the pen with the bottom edge extending {{to the bottom of the}} pen. Lines attached to the bottom corners are raised, herding some fish into the purse, where they are netted. Before killing, the fish are usually rendered unconscious in water saturated in carbon dioxide, although this practice is being phased out in some countries due to ethical and product quality concerns. More advanced systems use a percussive-stun harvest system that kills the fish instantly and humanely with a blow to the head from a pneumatic piston. They are then bled by cutting the gill arches and immediately immersing them in iced water. Harvesting and killing methods are designed to minimise scale loss, and avoid the fish releasing stress hormones, which negatively affect flesh quality.|$|E

He then dismembered the bodies, removed the bullets to prevent identification and, the next morning, discarded their remains. Remains were found at Eden Canyon a week after the murders, and more were found near Highway 1 in March. When questioned in a later interview as to why he removed his victim's head before having sex with the body, he explained: [...] "The head trip fantasies were <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> trophy. You know, the head is where everything is at, the brain, eyes, mouth. That's the person. I remember being told as a kid, you cut off the head and the body dies.

Through the video a number of street performers join the gathering crowd, including a motocross bicycler, a skateboarder, and a BBoy Cloud. The last scene, sees Rowland and Guetta unite on the beach for a late night party which sees the duo performing together. Capital FM described the video as [...] "lots of shots of people having fun in the sun". Melinda Newman from Hitfix praised Rowland's role in the clip saying that [...] Some criticism did follow the video. Capital FM radio station felt that Guetta's appearance in the clip was slightly disappointing. [...] "Guetta looks <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> binman pushing his gear round the streets in some of the earlier shots in the video". Newman said that the video's director, Jonas Åkerlund, had removed something from the song. [...] "The video could have built on the great beat that builds within the song and the feeling of abandon that falling in love can bring you, but, instead, we get a telegenic couple making out who seem to drop in from nowhere." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Joey Lynch of Billboard compared the song's demo {{to the studio}} versions, claiming that [...] "The studio version of 'Joan of Arc' is a massive improvement on the illegally leaked demo that preceded news of the album itself. [...] Nowhere is this more apparent than on 'Joan of Arc,' a solid album track that sounds 10 times better than the leaked version." [...] While reviewing the three tracks released prior to the album, Sam C. Mac of Slant Magazine called it [...] "arguably the standout of the whole over-blown affair," [...] noting that the song [...] "sounded like a highlight even in its more acoustic demo form, but the album version is a full-on stunner... The song sounds <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Cardigans leftover circa 'Long Gone Before Daylight'. It's the strongest (anti-)ballad of Madonna's last few albums, and a strong argument for artists responding to the denigration of their art through the more considered medium of the art itself, rather than snap public statements. [...] More {{than any of the}} previously released songs, 'Joan of Arc' also establishes one of the foundational themes of Rebel Heart, albeit one not always evident when wading through the poorly sequenced album." [...] Adding to the previous review, Annie Zaleski of The A.V. Club praised the juxtapositions in the album's lyrical content, which according to her, [...] "make some of her most vulnerable, engaging work in years— in particular 'Joan of Arc'." ...|$|E
500|$|Deadline.com's Dominic Patten {{also had}} {{praise for the}} season, {{particularly}} Rosenberg's influence on it, the coverage of topics such as [...] "PTSD, abuse, assault, shame, and death" [...] and the cast, highlighting Tennant's Kilgrave as the actor's best role {{as well as the}} MCU's best villain. Mary McNamara from the Los Angeles Times felt Jessica Jones [...] "rewrote the definition of superhuman" [...] and was [...] "a marvel", lauding the season's [...] "breathtaking" [...] examination of recovery from a sexually, emotionally and physically abusive relationship. Daniel Fienberg for The Hollywood Reporter was also positive, saying the season [...] "looks and feels <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> cable anti-hero series—but it's really more of a post-hero story, making it fascinating and unique in a marketplace that doesn't lack for costumed do-gooders of all types." [...] His one criticism was that [...] "the show shares Jessica's monomaniacal fixation on [...] and the result is a sort of narrative claustrophobia...Everything in these opening episodes ties back to Kilgrave and Kilgrave is such a twisted figure that it's hard for any light to get in." [...] Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly was slightly more critical of the season, awarding it a [...] "B". Though Maerz felt Ritter was a good choice for Jessica and enjoyed the cinematography, she felt the season [...] "could've made for a gritty character drama if it weren't for the noir clichés (saxophone music, shadows through glass) and a procedural structure that's very CSI: Marvel. The show's biggest weakness is the same as Jessica's: It starts out with extraordinary potential, but somewhere along the way, it loses what make it special." ...|$|E

500|$|Asked {{about the}} {{greatest}} challenge in filming the battle, Sapochnik said: [...] "Every time we charge the horses it takes 25 minutes to reset all the fake snow {{on the field and}} rub out the horseshoe prints. So how many times can we afford to charge the horses each day knowing we need to give time for a reset that's 10 times longer than the actual shot? Another thing was how to make 500 extras look like 8,000 when you are shooting in a field where there's just nowhere to hide your shortfall. It becomes <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bonkers math equation. And finally: How do you get these guys riled up enough to run at each other and get covered in mud and stand in the rain and then run at each other again and again for 25 days, 10 hours a day, without them just telling you to piss off?" [...] In an interview, he said that the single most difficult thing he was asked to depict was [...] "having 3,000 horses running at each other, especially after we discovered that horses cannot touch each other. It’s illegal — it’s a very valid rule about protecting the horses. So the very thing we were trying to do was not allowed. And we only had 70 horses ... you would have one guy run into the frame, and then the horse rider would pull the horse, which means make the horse fall and lie down on its side. Later we would digitally superimpose another C.G.I. horse and make it seem like it had impacted the live one." ...|$|E
500|$|Jocelyn Vena of MTV News praised Beyoncé for her [...] "never-miss-a-note voice" [...] and [...] "razzle-dazzle dance moves", and for {{matching}} the crowd's energy with her enthusiasm during live performances. Jozen Cummings of The Wall Street Journal described {{the show as}} Beyoncé's [...] "most intimate work to date", adding {{that it was an}} intimate night between [...] "Beyoncé and her fans, one in which there need not be a specific stand-out moment". Gavin DeGraw of VH1 noted that [...] "there's no doubting Beyoncé's talent as a performer; her undeniable vocal ability, show(wo)manship, and charm" [...] which infused the room the entire evening." [...] By contrast, Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone gave the show a mixed review, writing [...] "a Beyoncé concert is a big, blowsy affair, <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Las Vegas floor show crossed with a typhoon. 'Intimate' is not the adjective that leaps to mind". However, he described Beyoncé as [...] "a woman who can make a club feel like a coliseum". Rosen coined the live performance of [...] "I Was Here" [...] as [...] "a hollow exercise in self-mythologizing". Maura Johnston of The Village Voice placed 4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé on her list of The 10 Best Live Shows of 2011. In a review of the show, she commented [...] "The serenity at her core is borne from a supreme amount of confidence; that it comes off as something generously given is a testament to her prodigious talents as a performer on every level. Plus, I mean, have you heard her sing? Nobody has pipes like her right now. Not a single person out there. At the very least, we can all learn breath control from her." ...|$|E
500|$|The New Directions closing {{number at}} Sectionals, [...] "Valerie", {{received}} the most commentary, with Santana's solo given enthusiastic praise, though Brittany and Mike's dancing was also lauded. Hankinson, who had tepidly called songs [...] "nice" [...] up to this point, shifted gears and said, [...] "Then Santana burns the roof down with a rendition of Amy Winehouse's 'Valerie'. It was awesome." [...] Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal echoed that fervor: [...] "But then Santana came on and killed. With an on-spot rendition of Mark Ronson/Amy Winehouse's 'Valerie,' and wearing a Snooki bun, Santana was electrifying behind the mic, in an energizing display that revved up the audience", and added, [...] "Brittany and Mike's pas de deux rocked". Benigno opined that [...] "Brittany and Mike Chang handle the moves (extraordinarily well), but the vocals here are what steal it. Naya Rivera (Santana) is completely outstanding on lead vocals, and I can't understand why she hasn't gotten a solo before this"; he gave it an [...] "A". Stack was slightly less generous with an [...] "A-", and wrote {{that it was a}} [...] "great song choice for Santana"; he gave [...] "bonus points for the phenomenal Mike/Brittany choreography", while Harper said that their dancing [...] "totally made the song". Nguyen liked the dancing, but she was critical of how the song sounded, as she felt [...] "it lacked something and didn't really feel worthy of the standing O", while Futterman said [...] "Santana's sassy vocals are a perfect echo of Winehouse's, {{but the rest of the}} song feels <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> circus". Reiter felt the entire song [...] "seemed kind of tacked on", both the dancing and Santana's solo.|$|E

Both editions of the game were sold as box sets containing not only the rulebooks {{and a variety of other}} play aids but also sufficient plastic miniatures to be able to play the game [...] "out of the box". The rules underwent a re-write compared to 3rd Edition. A completely re-worked magic system was produced which was available as a boxed expansion set.
