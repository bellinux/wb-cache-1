5|$|In 1956, Oliver Butterworth {{authored}} a children's book, The Enormous Egg. The {{book and}} a movie adaptation televised in 1968 by the NBC Children's Theatre {{tell the story of}} a boy who finds an enormous egg laid by a hen that hatches a baby Triceratops. The dinosaur, named Uncle Beazley, becomes too big, so the boy brings him to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. Beazley is first kept at National Museum of Natural History, but is eventually transferred to the National Zoo's Elephant House because there is <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>against</b> stabling large animals in the District of Columbia.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not entirely}} clear why Burt made such an unusual will, but {{newspaper}} records suggest family feuds were likely {{at the core of}} his decision. The will was challenged by his children after he died. A legal hole was found in 1920 because part of the estate was composed of iron leases in Minnesota, and Minnesota had <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>against</b> trusts of such long standing. This portion of the estate, amounting to $5 million, was distributed to Burt's children and grandchildren (a son, three daughters and four granddaughters). In 1961, an additional $720,000 was taken from the trust in settlement of a suit filed by nine heirs and the estates of three other descendants.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian {{horse is}} a horse breed from Canada. It is a strong, {{well-muscled}} breed of horse, usually dark in colour. The horses are generally used for riding and driving. Descended from draft and light riding horses imported to Canada {{in the late}} 1600s, it was later crossed with other British and American breeds. During the 18th century the Canadian horse spread throughout the northeastern US, where it contributed {{to the development of}} several horse breeds. During the peak popularity of the breed, three subtypes could be distinguished, a draft horse type, a trotting type and a pacing type. Thousands of horses were exported in the 19th century, many of whom were subsequently killed while acting as cavalry horses in the American Civil War. These exports decreased the purebred Canadian population {{almost to the point of}} extinction, prompting the formation of a studbook and the passage of <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>against</b> further export.|$|E

Officials stated that the pieces had been obtained through an illegal purchase which had broken <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>against</b> trafficking in archaeological artifacts. The objects were taken to the Museo Nacional de Costa Rica in San José.|$|E
25|$|Fearing that Pridis's liberal wing, {{who had the}} {{majority}} in the National Assembly, would decide to take a decision, Phraya Manopakorn dissolved the parliament in April, imposed the emergency, and rescinded the constitutional part, which had not yet been a year old. He imposed <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>against</b> Communist activities, which was directed not so much against the almost insignificant Communist Party of Thailand, but rather against the alleged Communist projects Pridis. However, the younger officers of the Khana Ratsadon resisted and countered the oppressive actions of Phraya Manopakorn lead to another coup d'état only one year later, in June 1933, resulting in the appointment of Phraya Phahon as Siam's second prime minister.|$|E
25|$|Domestic {{violence}} {{was not a}} part of the Brazilian criminal code until 2006, when the federal criminal domestic violence code was passed by President Lula. The Law of Domestic and Family Violence was the first official codification of domestic violence crimes, and tripled the previous punishments associated with domestic violence. Brazil's adoption of the domestic violence code was mainly influenced by its participation in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), the urging of the international legal community, and the tenacity of local grassroots movements. The formation of women's police units and a federally funded hotline to serve victims of gender violence have significantly advanced the protections offered to women in Brazil, though domestic violence in Brazil remains prevalent and thus a major obstacle in attaining equal rights for women. In 2015, Brazil enacted <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>against</b> femicide.|$|E

50|$|The Racial Vilification Act 1996 {{is similar}} to the law in New South Wales.

Following many objections, no legislation was enacted.|$|R

25|$|As of 2017, bestiality {{is illegal}} in 42 U.S. states. Most state bestiality laws were enacted between 1999 and 2017. Until 2005, {{there was a}} farm near Enumclaw, Washington that was {{described}} as an “animal brothel”, where people paid {{to have sex with}} animals. After an incident on 2 July 2005, when a man was pronounced dead in the emergency room of the Enumclaw community hospital after his colon ruptured due to having been sodomized by a horse, the farm garnered police attention. The state legislature of the State of Washington, which {{had been one of the}} few states in the United States without <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>against</b> bestiality, within six months passed a bill making bestiality illegal. Arizona, Alaska, Florida, Alabama, New Jersey, New Hampshire and Ohio have banned sex with animals between 2006 and the present. When such laws are proposed, they are never questioned or debated. Laws which prohibit non-abusive bestiality have been criticized for being discriminatory, unjust and unconstitutional.|$|E
25|$|Young {{communist}} militants (UJRF) {{were also}} accused of sabotage actions like the famous Henri Martin affair {{and the case}} of Raymonde Dien, who was jailed one year for having blocked an ammunition train, {{with the help of}} other militants, in order to prevent the supply of French forces in Indochina in February 1950. Similar actions against trains occurred in Roanne, Charleville, Marseille, and Paris. Even ammunition sabotage by PCF agents has been reported, such as grenades exploding in the hands of legionaries. These actions became such a cause for concern by 1950 that the French Assembly voted <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>against</b> sabotage between March 2–8. At this session tension was so high between politicians that fighting ensued in the assembly following communist deputees’ speeches against the Indochinese policy. This month saw the French navy mariner and communist militant Henri Martin arrested by military police and jailed for five years for sabotage and propaganda operations in Toulon's arsenal. On May 5 communist Ministers were dismissed from the government, marking the end of Tripartism. A few months later on November 11, 1950, the French Communist Party leader Maurice Thorez went to Moscow.|$|E
25|$|In the United States two photographers got {{involved}} {{at the end}} of the 19th century in favor of people on the margins of society, Jacob Riis and Lewis Hine. For them the camera was an instrument of accusation against social injustice. In 1890 Riis documented the living conditions of the unemployed and homeless in New York ("How the Other Half Lives"). He was also interested in the fate of immigrants, many of whom lived in extreme poverty in the New York slums. Riis clearly takes sides for the people he photographed and appeals to the social conscience of society. In 1908 the National Child Labor Committee hired Hine, a sociology professor who advocated photography as an educational medium, to document child labor in American industry. In the early 20th century Hine would publish thousands of photographs designed to pull at the nation's heartstrings. Child Labor was widespread in the U.S. in the early 20th century. Hine equally drew attention to the situation of immigrants. The work of Riis and Hine had political influence. Riis' commitment to the people in the Mulberry Bend neighborhood led to its demolition. The building of schools and educational programs can also be attributed to Riis. Hine's work culminated in <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>against</b> child labor, the Keating-Owen Act of 1916, which was repealed shortly after the entry of the U.S. into the First World War.|$|E
