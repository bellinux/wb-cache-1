40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{analyses}} {{the statistical}} {{behavior of the}} US dollar, against nine different currencies, over the float period, with a monthly data set. The martingale hypothesis is rejected for <b>all</b> <b>currencies.</b> However, <b>all</b> <b>currencies</b> have a unit root. There is overwhelming evidence for significant positive serial correlation and ARCH effects in the logged series and in the changes of the logs. In addition, the nine logged series are characterized by structural breaks in both the intercept and the slope. Surprisingly, when the changes of the logs are considered, these do not show up any structural breaks, although the sample period has witnessed more than one political, social, and economic regime. All the nine logged currencies are well described by a low-order ARIMA model, with a parcimonious GARCH specification of the conditional variance. These ARIMA models imply mean aversion, rather than mean reversion, and high persistence of shocks. Mean aversion and persistence of shocks are formally tested and {{found to be significant}} for <b>all</b> nine <b>currencies.</b> This justifies the title of the paper...|$|R

5|$|Since its introduction, {{the euro}} {{has been the}} second most widely held {{international}} reserve currency after the U.S. dollar. The share of the euro as a reserve currency increased from 18% in 1999 to 27% in 2008. Over this period, the share held in U.S. dollar fell from 71% to 64% and that held in Yen fell from 6.4% to 3.3%. The euro inherited and built {{on the status of}} the Deutsche Mark as the second most important reserve currency. The euro remains underweight as a reserve currency in advanced economies while overweight in emerging and developing economies: according to the International Monetary Fund the total of euro held as a reserve in the world at the end of 2008 was equal to $1.1trillion or €850 billion, with a share of 22% of <b>all</b> <b>currency</b> reserves in advanced economies, but a total of 31% of <b>all</b> <b>currency</b> reserves in emerging and developing economies.|$|R

25|$|Foreign {{exchange}} market rates were fixed, but were allowed adjustments when necessary and currencies {{were required to}} be convertible.

50|$|Between mid-2006 and 2011 {{as well as}} in 2013 (but not since) it was {{the third}} most widely held reserve currency, having seen a {{resurgence}} in popularity in recent years, growing from about 2.5% to around 4% of <b>all</b> <b>currency</b> reserves. Analysts said this resurgence was caused by carry-trade investors considering the pound as a stable high-yield proxy to the euro, and by the position of London in world financial affairs.|$|R
