5|$|In 1969, {{more than}} 400 students, <b>angry</b> <b>about</b> the {{dismissal}} of a popular professor, Marlene Dixon, occupied the Administration Building for two weeks. After the sit-in ended, when Dixon turned down a one-year reappointment, 42 students were expelled and 81 were suspended, the most severe response to student occupations of any American university during the student movement.|$|E

5|$|On December 27, 1880, Wyatt {{testified that}} White's {{shooting}} was accidental. Brocius expressed regret, {{saying he had}} not intended to shoot White. Gunsmith Jacob Gruber testified that Curly Bill's single-action revolver was defective, allowing it to be discharged at half-cock. A statement from White before he died was introduced stating that the shooting was accidental. The judge ruled that the shooting was accidental and released Brocius. Brocius, however, remained intensely <b>angry</b> <b>about</b> how Wyatt had pistol-whipped him and became an enemy to the Earps. Virgil was also appointed acting town marshal of Tombstone.|$|E

5|$|When Clark {{finally left}} Fort Pitt in August 1781, he was {{accompanied}} by only 400 men, although he expected to meet Lochry and his Pennsylvanians at Fort Henry (present Wheeling, West Virginia). Clark was <b>angry</b> <b>about</b> {{the lack of support}} given his campaign, but he still hoped that the Kentucky militia, who were to rendezvous with him at Fort Nelson (Louisville, Kentucky), would provide additional men. He intended to at least carry out an expedition against enemy Indians if he did not have enough men to attack Detroit.|$|E
5|$|As Taylor took office, Congress faced {{a battery}} of {{questions}} related to the Mexican Cession, acquired by the U.S. after the Mexican War and divided into military districts. It was unclear which districts would be established into states and which would become federal territories, while the question of their slave status threatened to bitterly divide Congress. Additionally, many in the South had grown increasingly <b>angry</b> <b>about</b> the aid that northerners had given to fugitive slaves. While a southern slaveowner himself, Taylor believed that slavery was economically infeasible in the Mexican Cession, and as such he opposed slavery in those territories as a needless source of controversy. His major goal was sectional peace, preserving the Union through legislative compromise. As the threat of Southern secession grew, he sided increasingly with antislavery northerners such as Senator William H. Seward of New York, even suggesting that he would sign the Wilmot Proviso to ban slavery in federal territories should such a bill reach his desk.|$|E
5|$|Caesar {{was assassinated}} in March 44 BC. The motives of the conspirators were both personal, as well as political. Many of Caesar's {{ultimate}} assassins were envious of him, and dissatisfied with the recognition that they had received from him. Most of the conspirators were senators, {{and many of them}} were <b>angry</b> <b>about</b> {{the fact that he had}} deprived the senate of much of its power and prestige. They were also angry that, while they had received few honors, Caesar had been given many honors. There were also rumors that he was going to make himself king, and transfer the seat of government to Alexandria. The grievances that they held against him were vague, and as such, their plan against him was vague. The fact that their motives were vague, and that they had no idea of what to do after his assassination, both were plainly obvious by the subsequent course of events.|$|E

In the end Charles adds: Aymons weight in gold and his sister Aye. Aymon is not truly satisfied and swears that he will kill any child born out of his union with the king's sister.|$|R
5|$|Chambers {{lamented the}} effects of his drug use and noted the irony that the drugs did not do much to improve the {{consistency}} of his performances. On his return to international competition his times were significantly worse than he achieved prior to drug use: in the 100m final at the 2006 European Championships, Chambers ran a sub-par 10.24s and finished in fifth place. He {{was part of the}} gold medal-winning British 4×100m team, but Darren Campbell, who was <b>angry</b> <b>about</b> losing his 2002 and 2003 relay medals due to Chambers' ban, refused to join the team in a celebratory lap. After the competition, Chambers again expressed an interest in switching to American football and completed a week-long NFL Europa training camp in Cologne that November.|$|E
5|$|Edward now {{expected}} Isabella {{and their}} son to return to England, but instead she remained in France and showed no intention of making her way back. Until 1322, Edward and Isabella's marriage {{appears to have been}} successful, {{but by the time the}} Queen left for France in 1325, it had deteriorated. Isabella appears to have disliked Hugh Despenser the Younger intensely, not least because of his abuse of high-status women. Isabella was embarrassed that she had fled from Scottish armies three times during her marriage to Edward, and she blamed Hugh for the final occurrence in 1322. When Edward had negotiated the recent truce with Robert the Bruce, he had severely disadvantaged a range of noble families who owned land in Scotland, including the Beaumonts, close friends of Isabella's. She was also <b>angry</b> <b>about</b> the arrest of her household and seizure of her lands in 1324. Finally, Edward had taken away her children and given the custody of them to Hugh Despenser's wife.|$|E
5|$|Reactions to {{the death}} of Gaveston varied considerably. Edward was furious and deeply upset over what he saw as the murder of Gaveston; he made {{provisions}} for Gaveston's family, and intended to take revenge on the barons involved. The earls of Pembroke and Surrey were embarrassed and <b>angry</b> <b>about</b> Warwick's actions, and shifted their support to Edward in the aftermath. To Lancaster and his core of supporters, the execution had been both legal and necessary to preserve the stability of the kingdom. Civil war again appeared likely, but in December, the Earl of Pembroke negotiated a potential peace treaty between the two sides, which would pardon the opposition barons for the killing of Gaveston, in exchange for their support for a fresh campaign in Scotland. Lancaster and Warwick, however, did not give the treaty their immediate approval, and further negotiations continued through most of 1313.|$|E

5|$|Within 90 {{minutes of}} the explosion, McVeigh was stopped by Oklahoma Highway Patrolman Charlie Hanger for driving without a license plate and arrested for illegal weapons possession. Forensic {{evidence}} quickly linked McVeigh and Nichols to the attack; Nichols was arrested, and within days, both were charged. Michael and Lori Fortier were later identified as accomplices. McVeigh, {{a veteran of the}} Gulf War and a U.S. militia movement sympathizer, had detonated a Ryder rental truck full of explosives {{parked in front of the}} building. His co-conspirator, Nichols, had assisted with the bomb's preparation. Motivated by his dislike for the U.S. federal government and <b>angry</b> <b>about</b> its handling of the Ruby Ridge incident in 1992 and the Waco siege in 1993, McVeigh timed his attack to coincide with the second anniversary of the deadly fire that ended the siege at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas.|$|E
5|$|After being {{released}} from prison for assaulting a teenage boy who propositioned Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), Tony joins his partner Bianca Butcher (Patsy Palmer) and her family in Walford, including her son Morgan Jackson-King, whom he has adopted. It is revealed {{that he is a}} paedophile who has been grooming and sexually abusing Whitney, Bianca's adopted daughter, since she was 12. He immediately resumes his sexual relationship with Whitney, despite his displeasure at her more adult appearance, insisting she remove her make-up and jewellery. When Whitney gets a role in the school play, Romeo and Julie, Tony is <b>angry</b> <b>about</b> having less time with her, becoming jealous of her co-star Peter Beale (Thomas Law). Tony deceives Whitney into believing they will run away and start a new life together when she turns sixteen. Whitney gives him money she has been keeping for his return, which he gives Bianca as a deposit for a flat. Tony assaults Peter {{as a result of his}} growing jealousy, and is nearly reported to the police by Peter's sister Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield). Whitney convinces Lucy not to go to the police, but not before Lucy tells Bianca what happened. When Bianca angrily tells Tony that she is not a child anymore, he realizes he is no longer attracted to her.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), Lexie works with Mercy West resident Dr. April Kepner (Sarah Drew) on a burglar, and the two get in several disagreements, leading Lexie to steal her diary. Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) and Adamson continuously argue {{over the course of}} treatment for a patient, leading the patient's daughter to yell at them in disbelief. <b>Angry</b> <b>about</b> the revelation that Percy (who later apologized saying that they can be friends outside the hospital, but not inside) was using her, Stevens accidentally administers the wrong dialysis to a patient, making her an unviable candidate for the kidney transplant she was scheduled to receive. After arguing over surgical cases for the entirety of the day, Yang comes to the realization that she needs a cardiothoracic surgeon to work at the hospital. After being mistreated by Kepner, Lexie begins to mock her about what is written in her diary, thus ruining her emotionally, but subsequently apologizes.

Stevens departs, writing Karev a Dear John letter, causing him to cry in front of Meredith and Yang.|$|E

[...] "Political action starts in the Valley. It aims to change this city."

Keith loses the election {{by a margin of}} 51% to 49%. After we learn that Woody Goodman (Steve Guttenberg) has been elected mayor, Dick Casablancas (Ryan Hansen) hits on Gia Goodman (Krysten Ritter). Officers come in and arrest Logan for the murder of Felix Toombs before Veronica goes home and finds Abel Koontz, who is in the latter stages of stomach cancer.
