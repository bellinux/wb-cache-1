He has implied a {{strained}} relationship with Stewart, in contrast with the real Colbert's admiration for the comedian, and suggests that his departure from The Daily Show occurred under dubious circumstances. The character has described Stewart <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>sexual</b> predator and has been known to become tearful when his name is brought up. On the other hand, Colbert has also implied that he only got his own show by blackmailing Stewart with incriminating photographs.|$|E
5|$|Noriega {{took great}} care to shape {{perceptions}} of himself. He permitted and encouraged rumors {{that as the}} chief of intelligence, he was in possession of negative information about everybody in the country. Dinges suggests that the impression among some officials that Noriega made money off of every transaction in the country may have been cultivated by Noriega himself. Among opposition leaders in Panama he was seen variously <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>sexual</b> pervert, as a sadist, and a rapist. Within U.S. government circles contradictory images abounded; Noriega {{was seen as a}} CIA spy, a drug trafficker, a nationalist supporting Torrijos, an ally of Cuba, and an ally of Oliver North and the Contras. He was perceived as a trusted collaborator in the war against drugs, even as the DEA was investigating him for involvement in smuggling. By the time of his removal he had come to be hated in the U.S., and the invasion was portrayed as an attempt to remove an evil man. Dinges writes that these contradictory images played a large role in the U.S. government's self-contradictory policy towards Noriega.|$|E
50|$|In Sweden, {{case law}} also plays an {{important}} role in setting precedent on the application of the legislation.

Jones and Miller were nominated for awards at the 2013 Golden Globe Awards and the British Academy Television Awards for their roles in the film, which received mixed reviews from critics. The Daily Mirror Jane Simon praised Miller's portrayal of Hedren. Although she endorsed the film, Hedren said its length kept it from showing some of {{the positive aspects of}} her relationship with Hitchcock. Others who knew (and worked with) Hitchcock criticised the film because of its portrayal of him <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>sexual</b> predator. Kim Novak (who starred in one of Hitchcock's films) and Nora Brown (widow of one of Hitchcock's close friends) disputed the film's version of events.|$|E

25|$|Sexual {{objectification}} {{occurs when}} a person is identified by their sexual body parts or sexual function. In essence, an individual loses their identity, and is recognized solely by the physical characteristics of their body.

Sexual objectification can occur as a social construct among individuals.|$|E

25|$|For {{victims of}} {{specifically}} trafficked {{for the purpose}} of forced prostitution and sexual slavery, initiation into the trade is almost always characterized by violence.

Victims experience verbal threats, social isolation, and intimidation before they accept their role as a prostitute.|$|E

25|$|According to Baker, {{the plea}} deal could allow Wilson to be {{eligible}} for First Offender Treatment, which would mean that he would not have a criminal record nor would he be subject to registering on the sex offender registry once his sentence had been completed. It could also result in Wilson receiving a reduced sentence, possibly leading to his release based upon time already served. Wilson's lawyer, B.J. Bernstein, would not accept the proposed deal because it would require her client to plead guilty to a felony with a fifteen-year sentence, forcing him to register <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>sexual</b> offender for up to fifteen years.|$|E
25|$|Vespula squamosa, the {{southern}} yellowjacket, {{is a social}} wasp. This species can be identified by its distinctive black and yellow patterning and orange queen. These yellowjackets are typically found in the eastern United States, and its territory extends {{as far south as}} eastern Mexico and Guatemala. Within these territories, they create enormous, multiple-comb nests. The colonies may be either annual or perennial depending on the climate, and in many perennial nests, polygyny takes place. In addition, this species uses pheromones both <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>sexual</b> attractant and an alarm signal. This species feeds on insects and animal carcasses; it does not produce honey. V. squamosa, a social insect, has developed a parasitic relationship with the species V. vidua and V. maculifrons. Due to their painful, venomous stings, the species is considered a pest.|$|E
25|$|From {{the late}} 1950s to early 1990s, several pedophile {{membership}} organizations advocated age of consent reform to lower or abolish age of consent laws, {{as well as}} for the acceptance of pedophilia <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>sexual</b> orientation rather than a psychological disorder, and for the legalization of child pornography. The efforts of pedophile advocacy groups did not gain any public support and today those few groups that have not dissolved have only minimal membership and have ceased their activities other than through a few websites. In contrast to these organizations, members of the support group Virtuous Pedophiles believe that child sexual abuse is wrong and seek to raise awareness that some pedophiles do not offend; this is generally not considered pedophile advocacy, as the Virtuous Pedophiles organization does not approve of the legalization of child pornography and does not support age of consent reform.|$|E

25|$|This is {{one reason}} that the {{probability}} of transmitting many infections is far higher from sex than by more casual means of transmission, such as non-sexual contact—touching, hugging, shaking hands—but {{it is not the}} only reason. Although mucous membranes exist in the mouth as in the genitals, many STIs seem to be easier to transmit through oral sex than through deep kissing. According to a safe sex chart, many infections that are easily transmitted from the mouth to the genitals or from the genitals to the mouth are much harder to transmit from one mouth to another. With HIV, genital fluids happen to contain much more of the pathogen than saliva. Some infections labeled as STIs can be transmitted by direct skin contact. Herpes simplex and HPV are both examples. KSHV, on the other hand, may be transmitted by deep-kissing but also when saliva is used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>sexual</b> lubricant.|$|E
25|$|John's {{marriage}} {{was never a}} happy one. Rumors circulated that {{at the age of}} 25 {{he fell in love with}} Eugênia José de Menezes, his wife's chaperone. She became pregnant, and John was suspected of being the father. The case was hushed up, and the young woman was sent to Spain to bear the child. She gave birth to a daughter, whose name is unknown. The mother lived the rest of her life in nunneries and John supported her economically. Historians Tobias Monteiro and Patrick Wilcken write that there are indications that John also had a homosexual relationship <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>sexual</b> outlet, given his disastrous marriage, in which he lived apart from his wife, with whom he was together only on ceremonial occasions. His partner in this relationship would have been his favorite manservant, Francisco José Rufino de Sousa Lobato, who, according to these historians, may have regularly masturbated his master. While it may have been out of sheer malice, a priest named Miguel stated that he once stumbled upon the scene and therefore was deported to Angola, but not before leaving written testimony. Regardless of the truth or falsity of the claim, Rufino de Sousa received a variety of honors, accumulating among others the charges of adviser to the king, secretary of the Casa do Infantado, secretary of the Bureau of Conscience and Orders (Mesa de Consciência e Ordens) and governor of the Santa Cruz fortress. He also received the title of Baron and later Viscount of Vila Nova da Rainha.|$|E
