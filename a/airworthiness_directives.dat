25|$|The FAA {{began an}} {{aggressive}} safety evaluation in July 2005. The evaluation is performing a detailed review of accidents, incidents, <b>airworthiness</b> <b>directives,</b> service difficulty reports, safety recommendations and safety reports.

The goal is to identify the root causes of MU-2 accidents and incidents and determine what, if any, additional safety actions are needed.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, due to {{a series}} of crashes {{involving}} in-flight structural failure during simulated combat flights, the entire US civilian fleet of T-34A/Bs was grounded by the Federal Aviation Administration. The grounding has since been eased to a slate of restrictions on the permitted flight envelope. Via a series of <b>Airworthiness</b> <b>Directives</b> (ADs) established by or Alternate Methods of Compliance (AMOCs) negotiated with the FAA, including installation of certain, approved structural modifications to the wing spar and other repairs, the T-34A and T-34B fleet in 2011 has been restored to full flight status by FAA at the Mentor's originally designed limitations, provided each individual example is compliant with those ADs and AMOCs.|$|E

25|$|The TAIC {{released}} its interim {{report on the}} accident on 10 May 2012. Examination of the wreckage showed electrical arcing on the basket {{and one of the}} four propane cylinders, consistent with a power line strike. Details about the maintenance and record-keeping of the balloon were released. The most recent inspection had occurred on 14 September 2011, with several errors made in the records and inspection. The inspection report erroneously recorded the type certificate as B2GL, which is applicable to Cameron Balloons United States for serial numbers 5000 and higher â€“ ZK-XXF was manufactured in the United Kingdom and was serial number 4300, so the correct type certificate was BB12. It also recorded the basket and burners as being of Cameron Balloons, not as being of Thunder and Colt. Anomalies were also identified in the maintenance logbook, including incorrect identification of the basket and burners, no record of four <b>airworthiness</b> <b>directives,</b> and no entry regarding the use of the gas bottles. The maintenance provider was also found to be using outdated versions of the Flight and Maintenance Manuals, using the 1992-released Issue 7 rather than the current Issue 10, and that the maintainers had tested the strength of the envelope by hand, rather than the prescribed method of using a spring gauge to measure actual strength.|$|E
500|$|Flight 370 was {{operated}} with a Boeing 777-2H6ER, {{serial number}} 28420, registration 9M-MRO. It was the 404th Boeing 777 produced, first flown on 14 May 2002, and was delivered new to Malaysia Airlines on 31 May 2002. The aircraft was powered by two Rolls-Royce Trent 892 engines and configured to carry 282 passengers. It had accumulated 53,471.6 hours and 7,526 [...] in service {{and had not}} previously been involved in any major incidents, though a minor incident while taxiing at Shanghai Pudong International Airport in August 2012 resulted in a broken wing tip. Its last maintenance [...] "Acheck" [...] was carried out on 23 February 2014. The aircraft was in compliance with all applicable <b>Airworthiness</b> <b>Directives</b> for the airframe and engines. A replenishment of the crew oxygen system was performed on 7 March 2014, a routine maintenance task; an examination of this procedure found nothing unusual.|$|E

This was the troublesome engine that was {{installed on the}} 1977 to 1980 Cessna 172N Skyhawk. [...] It was notable from all other Lycoming models by incorporating hydraulic lifters that were barrel shaped instead of mushroom type, {{in an attempt to}} make the lifters possible to be serviced without having to disassemble the entire engine case, but the higher load on the cam lobes resulted in severe spalling. Multiple service bulletins and <b>airworthiness</b> <b>directives</b> have been issued regarding this specific model, and multiple modifications exist to attempt to mitigate its design defects.|$|E

The airline had fitted logo lights after delivery which required passing additional wires through the vapor seals in the fuel tanks. The NTSB recommended to the FAA that an <b>Airworthiness</b> <b>Directive</b> be issued requiring inspections of the fuel boost pumps, float switch and wiring looms as signs of chafing had been found. The FAA declined to issue the <b>Airworthiness</b> <b>Directive.</b>|$|R
50|$|An {{emergency}} <b>airworthiness</b> <b>directive</b> (EAD) is an <b>airworthiness</b> <b>directive</b> issued when an {{unsafe condition}} exists that requires immediate action by an aircraft owner or operator. EADs are published by a responsible authorities such as FOCA, EASA or FAA related to airworthiness {{and maintenance of}} aircraft and aircraft parts. It contains measures which must be accomplished and the related periods to preserve their airworthiness. Technical information is addressed to operators and maintenance organisations of affected aircraft only. EADs become effective upon receipt of notification.|$|R
2500|$|The media {{reported}} {{that this was}} at least the seventh occurrence of an Airbus A320 series aircraft touching down with the landing gear locked ninety degrees out of position, and one of at least sixty-seven [...] "nose wheel failures" [...] on A319, A320 and A321 aircraft worldwide since 1989. Earlier incidents included another JetBlue flight bound for New York City, a United Airlines flight into Chicago, and an America West flight into Columbus, Ohio. While some incidents were traced to faulty maintenance and denied as a design flaw by Airbus Industries, the manufacturer had issued maintenance advisories to A320 owners which were later mandated as <b>Airworthiness</b> <b>Directives</b> by American and French aviation authorities. Messier-Dowty, which manufactures nose gear assemblies for the A320, stated in an NTSB report in 2004 {{that part of the}} gear had been redesigned to prevent future problems, but at the time the redesign was awaiting approval. Mechanics familiar with this common fault usually replace or re-program the Brake Steering Control Unit (BSCU) computer.|$|E
