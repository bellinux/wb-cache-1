These demographic shifts present interesting challenges and opportunities to the healthcare system in the Palestinian Territories. While there is a socialized healthcare system within the Palestinian Territories that provides universal and compulsory enrollment for all citizens, the healthcare provided in this universal plan is far below the normal standard of care accorded to healthy individuals. These inadequate healthcare provisions, along with improper preventative care and lifestyle choices, contribute to the four primary causes of death within the region, which include cardiovascular disease, cancer, cerebrovascular disease, and diabetes.|$|R

The Green Party picked up an extra seat, with John Gormley elected in Dublin South-East. He was elected by just over 30 votes after a marathon recount, lasting four days, saw Progressive Democrat Michael McDowell defeated.

5000|$|The {{college campus}} grew as {{buildings}} were constructed and enrollment increased.

The program was intended to offer college education to more New York City residents, in particular those of color. But Open Admissions {{did not seem to}} affect Queens College as much as it did other schools — a year after its implementation, only 10% of its student body was black or Puerto Rican, according to the newly appointed college president, Dr. Joseph S.

CUNY's policy of free tuition was revoked; the overall CUNY budget was cut by $135 million; and CUNY Chancellor Robert Kibbee demanded that Queens College slash its budget by 15%. Some faculty members resigned in protest. The New York Times reported in December 1976 that [...] "Queens College, considered the jewel in the university's crown, has been particularly hard hit by the cuts, which have gone {{to the heart of the}} faculty."
