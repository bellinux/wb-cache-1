Tsakalotos opened the debate, calling the deal a [...] "very tough agreement with many thorns." [...] During the debate, he engaged heavily with the acting President of New Democracy, Vangelis Meimarakis, who criticised Tsakalotos for being [...] "provocative". Towards the end of the debate, Zoi Konstantopoulou, the Speaker of the Hellenic Parliament, raised so many procedural questions and objections that Tsakalotos missed the 9:30am vote to catch a flight to Brussels. More than 40 Syriza MPs voted against the plans, and it was suggested that Tsipras may resign, bringing the prospect of another snap election in September. In Brussels later that day, final negotiations were concluded for the Third Economic <b>Adjustment</b> <b>Programme</b> for Greece.|$|E
500|$|On 1 May 2010, the Greek {{government}} announced {{a series of}} austerity measures (the Third austerity package within months) to secure a three-year [...] loan (First Economic <b>Adjustment</b> <b>Programme).</b> This was met with great anger by some Greeks, leading to massive protests, riots, and social unrest throughout Greece. The Troika, a tripartite committee formed by the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund (EC, ECB and IMF), offered Greece a second bailout loan worth [...] in October 2011 (Second Economic <b>Adjustment</b> <b>Programme),</b> but with the activation being conditional on implementation of further austerity measures and a debt restructure agreement. Surprisingly, the Greek prime minister George Papandreou first answered that call by announcing a December 2011 referendum on the new bailout plan, but had to back down amidst strong pressure from EU partners, who threatened to withhold an overdue [...] loan payment that Greece needed by mid-December. On 10 November 2011, Papandreou resigned following {{an agreement with the}} New Democracy party and the Popular Orthodox Rally to appoint non-MP technocrat Lucas Papademos as new prime minister of an interim national union government, with responsibility for implementing the needed austerity measures {{to pave the way for}} the second bailout loan.|$|E

500|$|Although Mugabe {{had long}} hoped to convert Zimbabwe into a one-party state, in 1990 he officially [...] "postponed" [...] these plans as both Mozambique and many Eastern Bloc states transitioned from one-party states to multi-party republics. Following the {{collapse}} of the Marxist-Leninist regimes in the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc, in 1991 ZANU-PF removed references to [...] "Marxism-Leninism" [...] and [...] "scientific socialism" [...] in its material, although Mugabe maintained that [...] "socialism remains our sworn ideology". That year, Mugabe pledged himself to free market economics and accepted a structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>programme</b> provided by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This economic reform package called for Zimbabwe to privatise state assets and reduce import tariffs; Mugabe's government implemented some although not all of its recommendations. The reforms encouraged employers to cut their wages, generating growing opposition from the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions.|$|E
2500|$|Overall - {{looking at}} the new European {{economic}} governance framework, {{it seems to be}} in front of a [...] "mixture" [...] of different acts adopted at various territorial levels and characterized by a different legal nature.

Particularly, the EFSF’s mandate is to safeguard financial stability in Europe by providing financial assistance to the Eurozone’s macro-economic <b>adjustment</b> <b>programme</b> (2) the Treaty establishing the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) was signed on 2 February 2012, after a decision taken by the European Council (December 2010). Designed as a permanent crisis resolution mechanism for the countries of the Euro area, the ESM issues debt instruments in order to finance loans and other forms of financial assistance to the involved Member States; finally, (3) the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance (TSCG), whose final version was signed on 2 March 2012 by the leaders of all euro area members and eight other EU member states, and entered into force on 1 January 2013. The TSCG has been commonly labeled [...] "Fiscal Compact [...] ", originally intended to promote the launch of a new international economic cooperation enforced by those EU Member States which are also part of the so-called.|$|E

40|$|Vigorous {{debate over}} the {{effectiveness}} of the fiscal <b>adjustment</b> <b>programmes</b> for the crisis-stricken countries in the eurozone has grown quite polarised.

If these multipliers were underestimated, as the IMF itself claims, then the negative impact of the fiscal restructuring on already fragile economies would also have been underestimated.

40|$|A conference {{paper on}} the {{implications}} for social work practice in Africa due to the IMF/World Bank sponsored economic structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>programmes.</b> The main elements involved in the African economic crisis include deteriorating levels of public and private investment, mounting foreign debt:, inflationary budget deficits, incapability of maintaining public expenditure on social services (in particular health and education) and the maintenance of infrastructure generally. This is made worse by drastic declines in production in key sectors and increasing rates of unemployment and overall poverty. Structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>programmes</b> (SAPs) are only the most recent in a long series of similar attempts at resolving this economic crisis in Africa {{during the course of the}} last three decades of post-independence. Structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>programmes</b> (and previous policies, eg those termed "stabilisation programmes" and "economic reform programmes") have had immense impact on the countries undertaking the reforms, and in many cases have created further hardships for vulnerable groups within these countries, however these groups are defined. This paper considers the issue of the implementation of structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>programmes</b> in African countries. The aftermath of these programmes is so profound that almost every aspect of life is affected. As such it is important that social workers become aware of the resulting consequences and consider the implications for their own practice. It is also necessary to consider ways in which knowledge about structural adjustment and its social effects can be incorporated in the curriculum of schools of social work in Africa...|$|R

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 183 - 189. This {{study is}} {{primarily}} aimed at examining {{the impact of}} World Bank / IMF, structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>programmes</b> in the SADC region. However, {{the main focus of}} the study was on Zimbabwe and Zambia. These World Bank / IMF-influenced perestroikas, are believed to be viable panacea, for the state of economic malaise prevalent in the SADC region. In undertaking this research, various methods were utilised to acquire data. A case study approach was used. However, the main method of data collection which was heavily relied upon was document study. The collected data was analysed and presented in both graphical and tabular form. This study, inter alia, established that the implementation of IMF / WB structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>programmes</b> in the SADC region has precipitated a plethora of insurmountable socio-economic problems for the citizenry of both Zimbabwe and Zambia. Furthermore, the research has revealed that IMF / WB influenced structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>programmes</b> have culminated in large-scale unemployment, retrenchments, an acute decline in educational and health standards, ever-skyrocketing food prices, rents, taxes, mass exodus of qualified human resources to greener pastures, big debts, inflation and labour strikes in Zimbabwe and Zambia...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{literature}} {{review of the}} impacts of structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>programmes</b> on two mining communities in Ghana and Tanzania. The strategies adopted by the governments of Ghana and Tanzania to attract foreign investment in gold exploration and extraction activities, {{raise the question of}} how these multinational mining companies have approached the environmental and social impacts. After experiencing extensive periods of depressed economic growth, Ghana and Tanzania were forced to implement Structural <b>Adjustment</b> <b>Programmes</b> as a precondition for obtaining adjustment loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (WB). Prior to IMF‟s and World Bank‟s intervention, the mineral economies of these two nations were characterized by excessive state control. Consequently, the mining contracts have often been redrafted several times to a point where the risks of the projects (be they financial, social, or environmental) rest entirely on the countries. All that has been done in order to create an investor friendly environment. The method used is a comparative method based on the Method of Difference by John Stuart Mill. The data is collected from published books, reports, policy papers, articles and journals related to the topic. The research questions are; what are the impacts of the International Monetary Fund’s and the World Bank’s policies on the mining sector through structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>programmes</b> to the local people in Ghana and Tanzania? And are these impacts distributed equally in the economic social as well as environmental sustainability? In order to answer these questions and give a focused comparison of the two countries, five key areas have been analysed the effects of cyanide and mercury, delay in/unfair compensation, abuse of human rights, displacement and/or relocation of local residents, and the huge wage gaps between the local and expatriate employees. In analysing these areas, the similarities and differences among them have been highlighted. The findings indicate that despite the success of structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>programmes</b> in attracting foreign investment to gold mining, Ghana and Tanzania have high levels of poverty, corruption, authoritarianism, government inefficiency, and poor social and environmental performance. Therefore, the World Bank‟s and International Monetary Fund‟s structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>programmes</b> have been of more detriment than benefit for the local populations.
