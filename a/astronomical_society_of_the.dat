5|$|Walter Law was {{a friend}} of Andrew Carnegie, who {{described}} Law as always having an interest in reading and writing. When he found a phrase to be clever or intriguing, Law would document it for further use. Carnegie wrote that Law often made new friends, and had an attractive personality. Law's personal interest was largely in his personal library of 7,000 volumes, which he collected for more than forty years. His library was said to contain many works of classic literature and history; on a vacation to Europe, Law mostly spent time in Greece visiting historic sites. He was {{also a member of the}} Alpine Club, Aldine Association, the American Fine Arts Society, Ardsley Casino (now Ardsley Country Club), the <b>Astronomical</b> <b>Society</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pacific, New York's Century Association, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Players, and Sleepy Hollow Country Club. Law and his wife were on the Aqueduct Guard Citizens' Committee, a committee tasked with providing for the needs of the New York Guard troops who were protecting the Old Croton Aqueduct during World War I. In 1892, Law also received an honorary Master of Arts degree from Yale University.|$|E
