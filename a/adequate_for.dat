5|$|Before 1907, all {{magnitude}} {{measurements for}} stars were obtained through visual comparison of relative brightness, {{a process that}} was slow and inexact. Later photographic methods would use starlight to make a representation on a photographic plate. Regardless, neither method was <b>adequate</b> <b>for</b> quantitative measurements. The drawback of previous methods of measuring stellar magnitude made the use of electricity for empirically gathering astronomical data revolutionary for the science of astronomy. Joel Stebbins' pioneering research for astronomical photometry {{took place at the}} observatory.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} election, {{tensions}} grew between the French and British delegations, already in Singapore.

The London team promptly denied {{that the two men}} were under contract with the bid at that time, and underlined that their opinions did not reflect the views of the London bid.|$|E

However, the cricket and football seasons often overlapped, causing conflicts between the two sports.

5|$|Not {{unlike other}} {{countries}} during {{the evolution of}} their economies, Architecture became a tool for and manifestation of social policy, with architects and politicians determining just what features were <b>adequate</b> <b>for</b> the intended residents of housing projects.

Stafford began to follow See's plane, but when he lost sight of it in the clouds he instead followed the standard procedure for a missed approach and pulled his aircraft up, back into the clouds for another attempt at an instrument landing.|$|E

One review went so far to mock Southey's reliance on Welsh and Aztec names.|$|E

5|$|The root {{structure}} of B.prionotes exhibits two common environmental adaptations. Firstly, this species is phreatophytic, that is, its long taproot extends {{down to the}} water table, securing it a continuous water supply through the dry summer months, when surface water is generally unavailable. This not only helps ensure survival over summer, but allows plants to grow then. Though the supply of water is the taproot's primary function, the ground water obtained typically contains ionic concentrations of chloride, sodium, magnesium, calcium and potassium that are <b>adequate</b> <b>for</b> the plant's nutritional needs.|$|E
5|$|Changes in {{government}} approaches towards education {{meant that it}} was no longer regarded <b>adequate</b> <b>for</b> a child to leave education aged 14, as that is the age when they were seen to really understand and appreciate the value of education, as well as being the period when adolescence was at its height. It was beginning to be seen as the worst age for a sudden switch from education to employment, with around 80% of children in 1938 leaving education at this age, many having only had primary-school level education. Although there were concerns about the effects of having less labour from these children, it was hoped that the outcome of a larger quantity of more qualified, skilled workers would eliminate the deficit problem from the loss of unskilled labour.|$|E
5|$|From 1893–1912, {{the team}} used area parks such as Brisbane Park, Ponce de Leon Park, and Piedmont Park {{as the home}} field. Georgia Tech took out a seven-year lease on {{what is now the}} {{southern}} end of Grant Field, although the land was not <b>adequate</b> <b>for</b> sports, due to its unleveled, rocky nature. In 1905, Heisman had 300 convict laborers clear rocks, remove tree stumps, and level out the field for play; Tech students then built a grandstand on the property. The land was purchased by 1913, and John W. Grant donated $15,000 towards the construction of the field's first permanent stands; the field was named Grant Field in honor of the donor's deceased son, Hugh Inman Grant.|$|E

5|$|In 1944, {{under the}} control of the Special Air Task Force (SATFOR), the TDR-1 was {{deployed}} operationally to the South Pacific for operations against the Japanese. TDR-1 aircraft equipped a single mixed squadron (Special Air Task Group 1) along with TBM Avenger control aircraft, and the first operational mission took place on September 27, conducting bombing operations against Japanese ships. Despite this success, the assault drone program had already been canceled after the production of 189 TDR-1 aircraft, due to a combination of continued technical problems, the aircraft failing to live up to expectations, and the fact that more conventional weaponry was proving <b>adequate</b> <b>for</b> the defeat of Japan. The final mission was flown on October 27, with 50 drones having been expended on operations, 31 aircraft successfully striking their targets, without loss to the pilots of STAG-1.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{politicians}} on {{both sides}} of the river began to seek funding to build a new road bridge across the river. The rail bridge, while still <b>adequate</b> <b>for</b> rail traffic, it proved to be a challenge for drivers. The western terminus of the bridge featured a curve which was navigated easily by wagons and early automobiles, but was dangerous for semi trucks. Governor Terry Branstad was convinced a new bridge was needed after riding in a railcar to view the underside of the road deck. The new, four-lane Keokuk–Hamilton bridge opened on November 23, 1985, nearly eight months ahead of schedule and under budget.|$|E
5|$|Manuel {{had proven}} {{himself to be}} an {{energetic}} emperor who saw possibilities everywhere, and whose optimistic outlook had shaped his approach to foreign policy. However, {{in spite of his}} military prowess Manuel achieved but a slight degree of his object of restoring the Byzantine Empire. Retrospectively, some commentators have criticised some of Manuel's aims as unrealistic, in particular citing the expeditions he sent to Egypt as proof of dreams of grandeur on an unattainable scale. His greatest military campaign, his grand expedition against the Turkish Sultanate of Iconium, ended in humiliating defeat, and his greatest diplomatic effort apparently collapsed, when Pope Alexander III became reconciled to the German emperor Frederick Barbarossa at the Peace of Venice. Historian Mark C. Bartusis argues that Manuel (and his father as well) tried to rebuild a national army, but his reforms were <b>adequate</b> <b>for</b> neither his ambitions nor his needs; the defeat at Myriokephalon underscored the fundamental weakness of his policies. According to Edward Gibbon, Manuel's victories were not productive of any permanent or useful conquest.|$|E
