AF1 is ligand-independent and plays the primary role in target gene transactivation. The AF2 is a ligand-dependent and only shows limited function.|$|E
25|$|SHH is {{suggested}} {{to promote the}} <b>activation</b> <b>function</b> of Gli2 and inhibit repressive activity of Gli3. SHH also seems to promote the <b>activation</b> <b>function</b> of Gli3 but this activity is not strong enough. The graded concentration of SHH gives rise to graded activity of Gli 2 and Gli3, which promote ventral and dorsal neuronal subtypes in the ventral spinal cord. Evidence from Gli3 and SHH/Gli3 mutants show that SHH primarily regulates the spatial restriction of progenitor domains rather than being inductive, as SHH/Gli3 mutants show intermixing of cell types.|$|E

This is very useful in classification as it gives a certainty measure on classifications.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the existence and}} dynamical behaviors of multiple equilibria for competitive neural networks with a class of general Mexican-hat-type <b>activation</b> <b>functions.</b> The Mexican-hat-type <b>activation</b> <b>functions</b> are not monotonously increasing, {{and the structure of}} neural networks with Mexican-hat-type <b>activation</b> <b>functions</b> is totally different from those with sigmoidal <b>activation</b> <b>functions</b> or nondecreasing saturated <b>activation</b> <b>functions,</b> which have been employed extensively in previous multistability papers. By tracking the dynamics of each state component and applying fixed point theorem and analysis method, some sufficient conditions are presented to study the multistability and instability, including the total number of equilibria, their locations, and local stability and instability. The obtained results extend and improve the very recent works. Two illustrative examples with their simulations are given to verify the theoretical analysis...|$|R
40|$|In the neuroevolution literature, {{research}} has primarily focused on evolving {{the number of}} nodes, connections, and weights in artificial neural networks. Few {{attempts have been made}} to evolve <b>activation</b> <b>functions.</b> Research in evolving <b>activation</b> <b>functions</b> has mainly focused on evolving function parameters, and developing heterogeneous networks by selecting from a fixed pool of <b>activation</b> <b>functions.</b> This paper introduces a novel technique for evolving heterogeneous artificial neural networks through combinatorially generating piecewise <b>activation</b> <b>functions</b> to enhance expressive power. I demonstrate this technique on NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies using ArcTan and Sigmoid, and show that it outperforms the original algorithm on non-Markovian double pole balancing. This technique expands the landscape of unconventional <b>activation</b> <b>functions</b> by demonstrating that they are competitive with canonical choices, and introduces a purview for further exploration of automatic model selection for artificial neural networks...|$|R
30|$|Since the <b>activation</b> <b>functions</b> in [1] are bounded, {{while the}} <b>activation</b> <b>functions</b> in Example  1 are not bounded, hence the global {{exponential}} stability of periodic solutions for Example  1 cannot be verified by the result in [1].|$|R
25|$|AR {{activation}} {{requires the}} formation of a functional <b>activation</b> <b>function</b> 2 (AF2) region in AR LBD that mediates the interactions between AR and various transcription cofactors. Therefore, most of the research on NTD AR antagonists focuses on peptides that may directly block the AF2 in AR LBD from protein surface. Even in bound mutant AR, NTD antagonists would be able to block the AF2 function via direct surface interaction, regardless of the ligand bound.|$|E
25|$|An (artificial) {{neural network}} is {{a network of}} simple {{elements}} called neurons, which receive input, change their internal state (i.e. the activation) according to that input and an <b>activation</b> <b>function,</b> and produce output depending on the input and the activation. The network forms by connecting the output of certain neurons to the input of other neurons forming a directed and weighted graph, where the neurons are the nodes and {{the connection between the}} neurons are weighted directed edges. The weights and the activation functions can be modified by a process called learning, which is governed by a learning rule.|$|E
25|$|These {{can be used}} {{to output}} object {{bounding}} boxes {{in the form of a}} binary mask. They are also used for multi-scale regression to increase localization precision. DNN-based regression can learn features that capture geometric information, in addition to serving as a good classifier. They remove the requirement to explicitly model parts and their relations. This helps to broaden the variety of objects that can be learned. The model consists of multiple layers, each of which has a rectified linear unit as its <b>activation</b> <b>function</b> for non-linear transformation. Some layers are convolutional, while others are fully connected. Every convolutional layer has an additional max pooling. The network is trained to minimize L2 error for predicting the mask ranging over the entire training set containing bounding boxes represented as masks.|$|E

Siegelmann and Sontag (1991) showed the universality of homogeneous networks of first-order neurons having piecewise-linear <b>activation</b> <b>functions.</b> Their result was generalized by Kilian and Siegelmann (1996) to include various sigmoidal <b>activation</b> <b>functions.</b> Here we focus on a type of high-order neurons called switch-affine neurons, with piecewise-linear <b>activation</b> <b>functions,</b> and prove that nine such neurons suffice for simulatin...|$|R
40|$|Many <b>activation</b> <b>functions</b> {{have been}} {{proposed}} in the past, but selecting an adequate one requires trial and error. We propose a new methodology of designing <b>activation</b> <b>functions</b> within a neural network at each layer. We call this technique an "activation ensemble" because it allows {{the use of multiple}} <b>activation</b> <b>functions</b> at each layer. This is done by introducing additional variables, α, at each activation layer of a network to allow for multiple <b>activation</b> <b>functions</b> to be active at each neuron. By design, activations with larger α values at a neuron is equivalent to having the largest magnitude. Hence, those higher magnitude activations are "chosen" by the network. We implement the activation ensembles on a variety of datasets using an array of Feed Forward and Convolutional Neural Networks. By using the activation ensemble, we achieve superior results compared to traditional techniques. In addition, because of the flexibility of this methodology, we more deeply explore <b>activation</b> <b>functions</b> and the features that they capture...|$|R

The softmax function is defined as [...] where [...] represents the class probability (output of the unit [...] ) and [...] and [...] represent the total input to units [...] and [...] of the same level respectively.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the propagation of}} signals in generic densely connected multilayered feedforward neural networks. It is concluded that the dense connecting combined with the hyperbolic tangent <b>activation</b> <b>functions</b> of the neurons may cause a highly random, spurious generalization, that decreases the overall performance and reliability of a neural network and can be mistaken with overfitting. Modified <b>activation</b> <b>functions</b> instead of the hyperbolic tangent <b>activation</b> <b>functions</b> and an organized, instead of ad hoc, way of connecting neurons are discussed as possible ways of reducing the spurious generalization. ...|$|R

The VA function consists of a mixed linear-tanh sigmoid with a parameter which controls the linear region. The VA parameters and FIR synaptic weights are updated using a modified form of the instantaneous-cost (IC) temporal backpropagation algorithm [1].

[...] The A-B domain is highly variable in sequence between various nuclear receptors.|$|E
2500|$|In one patient, the {{underlying}} cause for presumptive PAIS was a mutant steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) protein. [...] In another patient, CAIS {{was the result of}} a deficit in the transmission of a transactivating signal from the N-terminal region of the normal androgen receptor to the basal transcription machinery of the cell. [...] A coactivator protein interacting with the <b>activation</b> <b>function</b> 1 (AF-1) transactivation domain of the androgen receptor may have been deficient in this patient. [...] The signal disruption could not be corrected by supplementation with any coactivators known at the time, nor was the absent coactivator protein characterized, which left some in the field unconvinced that a mutant coactivator would explain the mechanism of androgen resistance in CAIS or PAIS patients with a normal AR gene.|$|E

[...] The ligand binding cavity is within the interior of the LBD and just below three anti parallel alpha helical sandwich [...] "filling". [...] Along with the DBD, the LBD contributes to the dimerization interface of the receptor and in addition, binds coactivator and corepressor proteins.

Different from the bounded case, where the existence of an equilibrium point is always guaranteed, for unbounded activations it may happen that there is no equilibrium point. When considering the widely employed piecewise-linear NNs, infinite intervals with zero slope are present in activations, and it is of great interest to drop the assumptions of strict increase and continuous first derivative for the activation.
