60|$|While I {{am writing}} of the 'New Quarterly,' I take the liberty of making a remark, not of course in {{relation}} to myself--I know too well my duty to my judges--but to your view of the Vantage ground of the poetesses of England. It is a strong impression with me that previous to Joanna Baillie {{there was no such}} thing in England as a poetess; and that so far from triumphing over the rest of the world in that particular product, we lay until then under the feet of the world. We hear of a Marie in Brittany who sang songs worthy to be mixed with Chaucer's for true poetic sweetness, and in Italy a Vittoria Colonna sang her noble sonnets. But in England, where is our poetess before Joanna Baillie--poetess in the true sense? Lady Winchilsea had an eye, as Wordsworth found out; but the Duchess of Newcastle had more poetry in her--the comparative praise proving the negative position--than Lady Winchilsea. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> of the French, that they have only epistolary women and wits, while we have our Lady Mary, why what would Lady Mary be to us but for her letters and her wit? Not a poetess, surely! unless we accept for poetry her graceful vers de société.|$|E
6000|$|Third, don't perpetually {{boast that}} you are cultured in {{language}} which proves {{that you are}} not. You claim to thrust yourself upon everybody {{on the ground that}} you are stuffed with wit and wisdom, and have enough for the whole world. But people who have wit enough for the whole world, have wit enough for a whole newspaper paragraph. And you can seldom get through even a whole paragraph without being monotonous, or irrelevant, or unintelligible, or self-contradictory, or broken-minded generally. If you have something to teach us, teach it to us now. If you propose to convert us after you have conquered us, why not convert us before you have conquered us? As it is, we cannot believe what you say about your superior education because {{of the way in which}} you say it. If an Englishman says, [...] "I don't make no mistakes in English, not me," [...] we can understand his remark; but we cannot endorse it. To say, [...] "Je parler le Frenche language, non demi," [...] is comprehensible, but not convincing. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> as you did in a recent appeal to the Americans, that the Germanic Powers have sacrificed a great deal of [...] "red fluid" [...] in defence of their culture, we point out to you that cultured people do not employ such a literary style. Or when you say that the Belgians were so ignorant as to think they were being butchered when they weren't, we only wonder whether you are so ignorant as to think you are being believed when you aren't. Thus, for instance, when you brag about burning Venice to express your contempt for [...] "tourists," [...] we cannot think much of the culture, as culture, which supposes St. Mark's to be a thing for tourists instead of historians. This, however, would be the least part of our unfavourable judgment. That judgment is complete when we have read such a paragraph as this, prominently displayed in a paper in which you specially spread yourself: [...] "That the Italians have a perfect knowledge of the fact that this city of antiquities and tourists is subject, and rightly subject, to attack and bombardment, is proved by the measures they took at the beginning of the war to remove some of their greatest art treasures." [...] Now culture may or may not include the power to admire antiquities, and to restrain oneself from the pleasure of breaking them like toys. But culture does, presumably, include the power to think. For less laborious intellects than your own it is generally sufficient to think once. But if you will think twice or twenty times, it cannot but dawn on you that there is something wrong in the reasoning by which the placing of diamonds in a safe proves that they are [...] "rightly subject" [...] to a burglar. The incessant assertion of such things can do little to spread your superior culture; and if you say them too often people may even begin to doubt whether you have any superior culture after all. The earnest friend now advising you cannot but grieve at such incautious garrulity. If you confined yourself to single words, uttered at intervals of about a month or so, no one could possibly raise any rational objection, or subject them to any rational criticism. In time you might come to use whole sentences without revealing the real state of things.|$|E
