5|$|A {{majority}} of multinational corporations find their origins in First World countries. After {{the fall of}} communism, multinational corporations proliferated as more countries focused on global trade. The series of General <b>Agreement</b> <b>on</b> <b>Tariffs</b> and Trade (GATT) and later the World Trade Organization (WTO) essentially ended the protectionist measures that were dissuading global trade. The eradication of these protectionist measures, while creating avenues for economic interconnection, mostly benefited developed countries, who by using their power at GATT summits, forced developing and underdeveloped countries to open their economies to Western goods.|$|E
5|$|The Anglo-French {{businessman}} James Goldsmith {{announced the}} formation of the Referendum Party on 27 November 1994. Goldsmith had once been a strong supporter of the EEC but had grown disenchanted with it during the early 1990s, becoming particularly concerned that it was forming into a superstate governed by centralised institutions in Brussels. He opposed the Maastricht Treaty, believing that it resulted in increased German dominance in Europe. As an economic protectionist, he was also critical of the EU's signing of the General <b>Agreement</b> <b>on</b> <b>Tariffs</b> and Trade, believing that global free trade would damage both the EU's economy and his own business interests.|$|E
5|$|In the General Theory and later, Keynes {{responded to}} the socialists and left-wing liberals who argued, {{especially}} during the Great Depression of the 1930s, that capitalism caused war. He argued that if capitalism were managed domestically and internationally (with coordinated international Keynesian policies, an international monetary system that didn't pit the interests of countries against each other, and {{a high degree of}} freedom of trade), then this system of managed capitalism could promote peace rather than conflict between countries. His plans during World War II for post-war international economic institutions and policies (which contributed to the creation at Bretton Woods of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and later {{to the creation of the}} General <b>Agreement</b> <b>on</b> <b>Tariffs</b> and Trade and eventually the World Trade Organization) were aimed to give effect to this vision.|$|E

5|$|In 1947, 23 {{countries}} {{concluded the}} General <b>Agreement</b> <b>on</b> <b>Tariffs</b> and Trade (GATT) at a UN conference in Geneva. Delegates intended {{the agreement to}} suffice while member states would negotiate creation of a UN body {{to be known as}} the International Trade Organization (ITO). As the ITO never became ratified, GATT became the de facto framework for later multilateral trade negotiations. Members emphasized trade reprocity as an approach to lowering barriers in pursuit of mutual gains. The agreement's structure enabled its signatories to codify and enforce regulations for trading of goods and services. GATT was centered on two precepts: trade relations needed to be equitable and nondiscriminatory, and subsidizing non-agricultural exports needed to be prohibited. As such, the agreement's most favored nation clause prohibited members from offering preferential tariff rates to any nation that it would not otherwise offer to fellow GATT members. In the event of any discovery of non-agricultural subsidies, members were authorized to offset such policies by enacting countervailing tariffs. The agreement provided governments with a transparent structure for managing trade relations and avoiding protectionist pressures. However, GATT's principles did not extend to financial activity, consistent with the era's rigid discouragement of capital movements. The agreement's initial round achieved only limited success in reducing tariffs. While the U.S. reduced its tariffs by one third, other signatories offered much smaller trade concessions.|$|E

40|$|Backwaters of Global Prosperity by Caf Dowlah, {{focuses on}} the {{expanding}} group of least developed countries (LDCs) that have been largely excluded from the benefits of economic globalization. Situated within the literatures on both globalization and development, the book’s core concern is real and of great consequence. Indicators show a pronounced gap between developed and developing countries. Even as advanced industrial economies grow stronger, more nations suffer extreme poverty, poor heath, substandard education, and substantial economic vulnerability. The crisis is global and severe. Dowlah’s primary objective is to convince readers that globalization broadly and the institutions that support the multilateral trade regime specificallyFthat is, the General <b>Agreement</b> <b>on</b> <b>Tariff</b> and Trade (GATT) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) Fhave played a significant, causal role in marginalizing the world’s poorest economies while allowing developed countries to reap the benefits.

40|$|The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) {{a system}} of {{differential}} and favorable trade arrangements toward less developed countries, adopted by the General <b>Agreement</b> <b>on</b> <b>Tariff</b> and Trade (GATT) {{has been around since}} the early 1970 s. A primary objective of these schemes has been to promote industrialization and economic growth in less developed countries through trade rather than aid. The outcome of such programs has, however, been mixed. This paper identifies some of the underlying political and economic dynamics which led to the dismal performance of the GSP schemes of the United States in respect to the industrialization and economic growth of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs). The paper suggests that the effectiveness of GSP schemes could be significantly improved if they were brought under the binding WTO rules, if greater resources were directed to removing supply constraints in the LDCs, and if developed countries granted unwavering market access to LDC exports. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{considers}} the origin, meaning and current {{relevance of the}} Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) Article 3. 8 presumption that a government measure which infringes World Trade Organization (WTO) obligations constitutes a prima facie case of nullification or impairment. It is argued that the prevailing interpretation of this provision is inconsistent with its plain language and {{may have contributed to}} the tendency of respondent states to invoke the presumption in order to undermine the fundamental principle that General <b>Agreement</b> <b>on</b> <b>Tariff</b> and Trade/WTO rules protect competitive opportunities rather than trade flows. The key to understanding the provision resides in the acknowledgment that the concept of nullification or impairment can be understood in two different senses depending on the stage in the proceedings at which it is relevant. While there is an isolated indication that the Appellate Body is edging closer to a re-interpretation of the provision, it is suggested that the dispute settlement process could be modestly simplified with some amendments to the DSU.
