5000|$|Finsch's flycatcher-thrush usually occurs {{alone or}} in pairs. During the {{breeding}} season it is highly territorial, but at other times it may join mixed-species flocks at ant swarms. However, it relies much less on ant swarms than two of its fellow members of the genus Neocossyphus, the white-tailed and red-tailed <b>ant</b> <b>thrushes.</b> Instead it catches insects in its beak like a flycatcher, hawking from perches or taking them from under leaves while it hovers. Favored insects include termites, grasshoppers, ants, beetles, flies, and various small species. It may sit {{for a long time}} without moving on a horizontal perch. It often flicks its outer rectrices to the side [...] "in scissor-like fashion".|$|R
