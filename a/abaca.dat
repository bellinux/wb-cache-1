5|$|Pottery {{and weaving}} {{are among the}} very first art forms {{showcasing}} Filipino artistic design and are evident from cave dwellings all over the country. Among these are mostly anthropomorphic earthenware jars dating from c. 5BC to 225AD. Weaving was mostly done by women, using fibers from <b>abaca,</b> pineapple, cotton, and bark to make clothes, rugs and hats. Baskets were mostly utilized to carry grain and other foods.|$|E
5|$|Tawau's court {{complex is}} on Dunlop Street. It {{contains}} the High Court, Sessions Court, and the Magistrate Court. Syariah Court {{is located at}} <b>Abaca</b> Street. The district police headquarters is on Tanjung Batu Street, and other police station are sited throughout the district including Wallace Bay, Bombalai, Bergosong, Kalabakan, Seri Indah and LTB Tawau. Police substations (Pondok Polis) are found in Tass Bt. 17, Apas Parit, Merotai, Quin Hill, Balung Kokos, Titingan, Kinabutan and Burmas areas, and the Tawau Prison is in the town centre.|$|E
25|$|Sisal is {{the main}} leaf fibre used; others are: <b>abacá</b> and henequen.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture is {{the main}} {{industry}} in Albay, which produces crops like coconut, rice, sugar and <b>abacá.</b> Handicrafts are {{the major source of}} rural income and comprises a fairly large share in the small-scale industries of the province. Forestry, cement production and paper-making are other sources of livelihood. The manufacture of <b>abacá</b> products such as Manila hemp, hats, bags, mats, furniture, home decors, and slippers {{is one of the main}} sources of income in the rural areas. Production of <b>abaca</b> fiber experienced a boom from the late 1800s until the American period. Fishing {{is the main}} livelihood along both shores of the province. Tourism, especially related to Mayon Volcano, also creates income for Albay. For the year 2013, Albay had a total of 339,445 foreign tourist arrivals.|$|E
25|$|Other crops {{produced}} include banana (Lakatan), mango, rambutan, and lanzones; {{and fiber}} {{crops such as}} piña fiber and <b>abaca.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tagalog {{has contributed}} several words to Philippine Spanish, like {{barangay}} (from balan͠gay, meaning barrio), the <b>abacá,</b> cogon, palay, dalaga etc.|$|E
25|$|Aklan {{is a top}} {{producer}} of <b>abaca,</b> which are dyed and made into cloths or place mats, bags, wall decors and fans.|$|E
25|$|In 1873 {{additional}} ports {{were opened}} to foreign commerce, {{and by the}} late nineteenth century three crops—tobacco, <b>abaca,</b> and sugar—dominated Philippine exports.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy of}} Camarines Sur is mostly agriculture-based. 29 of the 35 towns are {{agricultural}} and produce rice, corn, feedmeal, freshwater fish, livestock, coconut, sugar, <b>abacá,</b> and water-lily.|$|E
25|$|Forest {{products}} include bamboo, rattan, buri, bariw, nito, log, charcoal, <b>abaca,</b> herbal {{vines and}} plants, wild flowers and others. These forest resources are of undetermined quantity, {{and are used}} as raw materials in the construction industry, furniture and handicraft.|$|E
25|$|The {{island is}} the most fertile and well-provisioned of all the islands discovered, except the island of Luzon: for it is {{exceedingly}} fertile, and abounds in rice, swine, fowls, wax, and honey; it produces also a great quantity of cotton and <b>abacá</b> fiber.|$|E
25|$|English has {{borrowed}} {{some words}} from Tagalog, such as <b>abaca,</b> barong, balisong, boondocks, jeepney, Manila hemp, pancit, ylang-ylang, and yaya, although {{the vast majority}} of these borrowed words are only used in the Philippines as part of the vocabularies of Philippine English.|$|E
25|$|Traditional Japanese {{papermaking}} {{uses the}} inner bark fibers of plants. This fiber is soaked, cooked, rinsed and traditionally hand-beaten {{to form the}} paper pulp. The long fibers are layered to form strong, translucent sheets of paper. Three traditional fibers are <b>abaca,</b> kozo and gampi. Today, this paper is used for calligraphy, printing, book arts, and three-dimensional work, including origami.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{materials}} of the banknotes are long fibres from {{any kind of}} wood, or a mix {{of different types of}} wood. However, the preferable material is <b>abaca</b> fibre, which is naturally plentiful in Indonesia and is believed to increase the durability of the banknotes. The banknotes are heat-processed to create a unique type of pulp.|$|E
25|$|Rizal was {{implicated in}} the {{activities}} of the nascent rebellion and in July 1892, was deported to Dapitan in the province of Zamboanga, a peninsula of Mindanao. There he built a school, a hospital and a water supply system, and taught and engaged in farming and horticulture. <b>Abaca,</b> then the vital raw material for cordage and which Rizal and his students planted in the thousands, was a memorial.|$|E
25|$|The cash {{economy of}} the Commonwealth was mostly agriculture-based. Products {{included}} <b>abaca,</b> coconuts and coconut oil, sugar, and timber. Numerous other crops and livestock were grown for local consumption by the Filipino people. Other sources for foreign income included the spin-off from money spent at American military bases on the Philippines such as the naval base at Subic Bay and Clark Air Base (with U.S. Army airplanes there as early as 1919), both {{on the island of}} Luzon.|$|E
25|$|When the United States {{granted the}} Philippines {{commonwealth}} status, the country enjoyed a {{rapid growth of}} prosperity. Tourism, industry, and agriculture were among the largest contributors to the economy. Products included <b>abaca</b> (a species of banana), coconuts and coconut oil, sugar, and timber. Numerous other crops and livestock were grown for local consumption by the Filipino people. Manila {{became one of the}} most visited cities in Asia alongside Hong Kong. Manila was considered to be the most beautiful city in Asia. This sentiment drew tourists from around the world, helping to boost the Philippine economy.|$|E
25|$|Entrepreneurs {{engage in}} trading, often {{branching}} out towards neighboring provinces {{in the south}} as local demand might be limited by the 3rd to 5th income-class municipalities. Handicrafts are {{the major source of}} rural income, providing a fairly large share in the small-scale industries of the province. Forestry and papermaking are other sources of livelihood. The manufacture of <b>abacá</b> products such as Manila hemp, hats, bags, mats, and slippers {{is one of the main}} sources of income in the rural areas. Fishing is also done along both shores of the province. Tourism, primarily because of Caramoan and Mount Isarog, also generates income for Camarines Sur.|$|E
25|$|On August 1, 1851 the Banco Español-Filipino de Isabel II was {{established}} to attend {{the needs of the}} rapid economic boom, that had greatly increased its pace since the 1800s {{as a result of a}} new economy based on a rational exploitation of the agricultural resources of the islands. The increase in textile fiber crops such as <b>abacá,</b> oil products derived from the coconut, indigo, that was growing in demand, etc., generated an increase in money supply that led to the creation of the bank. Banco Español-Filipino was also granted the power to print a Philippine-specific currency (the Philippine peso) for the first time (before 1851, many currencies were used, mostly the pieces of eight).|$|E
25|$|Most {{banknotes}} {{are made}} from cotton paper with a weight of 80 to 90grams per square meter. The cotton is sometimes mixed with linen, <b>abaca,</b> or other textile fibres. Generally, the paper used is different from ordinary paper: {{it is much more}} resilient, resists wear and tear (the average life of a banknote is two years), and also does not contain the usual agents that make ordinary paper glow slightly under ultraviolet light. Unlike most printing and writing paper, banknote paper is infused with polyvinyl alcohol or gelatin, instead of water, to give it extra strength. Early Chinese banknotes were printed on paper made of mulberry bark. Mitsumata (Edgeworthia chrysantha) and other fibers are used in Japanese banknote paper (a kind of Washi).|$|E
25|$|With {{a view of}} {{building}} up the economic base of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the Japanese Army envisioned using the islands {{as a source of}} agricultural products needed by its industry. For example, Japan had a surplus of sugar from Taiwan but, a severe shortage of cotton, so they tried to grow cotton on sugar lands with disastrous results. They lacked the seeds, pesticides, and technical skills to grow cotton. Jobless farm workers flocked to the cities, where there was minimal relief and few jobs. The Japanese Army also tried using cane sugar for fuel, castor beans and copra for oil, derris for quinine, cotton for uniforms, and <b>abaca</b> (hemp) for rope. The plans were very difficult to implement in the face of limited skills, collapsed international markets, bad weather, and transportation shortages. The program was a failure that gave very little help to Japanese industry, and diverted resources needed for food production.|$|E
25|$|Manobos {{occupied}} hinterland areas we {{now call}} Davao. Originally, they either wrapped the corpse in mat and bamboo slats to hang up on the tree or laid the dead on an elevated station (such as platform) beside the trees. Placing the body on an elevated place was believed to help the dead’s soul reach the heaven. However, after the Americans introducing <b>Abaca</b> plantation system in the 20th century, the custom changed to burying the corpse under the house. Due to the plantation, it became impossible to simply move out from their places like how they did before. For Ata-Manobos occupying the forest areas of Davao, have the unique superstition in teaching Antuk (riddles) other than for wake ceremony will bring misfortune. So in Ata-manobos’ joyful wake custom, close people of the deceased gather and sit around the corpse (in laid down position) and chat, tell stories, sing, dance, play instruments and more to elevate the atmosphere of grief.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, UPLB {{researchers}} {{funded by}} the Department of Agriculture developed an <b>abacá</b> variety that is resistant to the <b>abaca</b> bunchy top virus. The virus, first detected in 1915 at Silang, Cavite, has since spread to various provinces in the country, and damaged more than [...] of <b>abacá</b> plantations in 2002 alone. The university is working further to make it resistant to mosaic and <b>abacá</b> bract mosaic viruses.|$|E
500|$|The {{movement}} {{opens with}} the soloist playing the four-measure principal theme alone; {{it is then}} repeated by the orchestra. This theme is, {{in the words of}} Michael Steinberg, one of [...] "extreme simplicity". Mozart's first sketch of the movement was much more complex. He likely simplified the theme to provide a greater contrast with the dark intensity of the first movement. After the orchestra repeats the principal theme there is a very simple bridge or transitional passage that Girdlestone calls [...] "but a sketch" [...] to be ornamented by the soloist, arguing that [...] "to play it as printed is to betray the memory of Mozart". Following the bridge passage, the soloist plays the initial four-measure theme for a second time, before the orchestra commences a new section of the movement, in C minor. A brief return of the principal theme, its rhythm altered, separates the C minor section from a section in A-flat major. After this new section, the principal theme returns to mark the end of the movement, its rhythm altered yet again. Now, the theme is played twice by the soloist, the two appearances being connected by the same simple bridge passage {{from the beginning of the}} movement. Girdlestone argues that here [...] "the soloist will have to draw on his imagination to adorn [...] a second time". The overall structure of the movement is thus <b>ABACA,</b> making the movement in rondo form.|$|E
2500|$|These first {{settlers}} included {{tribes of}} Ilongots (Egungot) or Italons, <b>Abaca</b> and Buquids. Settlements were built {{along the banks}} following the river's undulations. The Ilongots , meaning people of the forest, were the fierce headhunters and animist tribes who occupied Carranglan and the mountainous terrain of Sierra Madre and Caraballo. The head hunting communities were nestled along the riverbanks of Rio Grande's tributaries in the north. <b>Abaca</b> and Italon were subgroups of Ilongots meaning river settlers. Ilongots survived mainly by fishing and hunting. Food production was a secondary occupation. The agriculture-based community of Caraclans and Buquids [...] were settled in Bongabon and Pantabangan along the riverbanks of Rio Grande's tributaries in the northeast.|$|E
2500|$|Hemp rope {{was used}} in the age of sailing ships, though the rope had to be {{protected}} by tarring, since hemp rope has a propensity for breaking from rot, as the capillary effect of the rope-woven fibers tended to hold liquid at the interior, while seeming dry from the outside. Tarring was a labor-intensive process, and earned sailors the nickname [...] "Jack Tar". Hemp rope was phased out when Manila, which does not require tarring, became widely available. Manila is sometimes referred to as Manila hemp, but is not related to hemp; it is <b>abacá,</b> a species of banana.|$|E

60|$|The soil {{is fully}} sufficient—indeed, more than sufficient—to support this population, whose wants {{are of the}} most limited character. The land is {{exceedingly}} fertile and bears in abundance all tropical products, particularly rice, sugar, and the <b>abaca,</b> a variety of the banana-tree. The fibres of the <b>abaca</b> are employed in making the finest and most delicate fabrics, of which from three to four million dollars’ worth are exported annually. The exports of sugar amount to about four millions and a half, of gold to two millions and a half, and of coffee and tobacco close on to {{a million and a}} quarter each. The rice is consumed at home. It forms the staple food of the people, and nearly three million dollars’ worth is imported yearly. The husbandman cannot complain that his toil is inadequately rewarded. A rice plantation will yield a return of at least fifteen per cent.; if he plant his farm with sugar-cane he will realise thirty per cent., if not more. On the other hand, the price of labour is very low. An adult who gains a real fuerte (about thirteen cents) a day, thinks he is doing well.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Abaca</b> - <b>Abaca</b> fiber is {{also another}} product that Libacaonons produce.|$|E
50|$|Manufacturing {{is small}} scale: {{charcoal}} (burnt coconut shells or uling), <b>abaca</b> products, ceramics, coconut oil, furniture making, hollow block making, and gravel and sand. Export products are copra, <b>abaca,</b> <b>abaca</b> handicrafts and fiber craft items.|$|E
50|$|<b>Abaca</b> {{slippers}} {{are made}} from dried <b>abacá</b> plants and leaves, as well as sometimes from dried pineapple plant leaves. <b>Abaca</b> slippers {{may be found in}} the Davao and Mindanao regions of the Philippines and are sold at many markets in the Philippines.|$|E

50|$|Catanduanes Island is {{the native}} habitat of the endemic <b>abaca</b> plant (a banana relative) which is {{globally}} {{renowned for its}} strong fiber. In fact, the Philippines FIDA (Fiber Industry Development Authority) declared the island as the highest <b>abaca</b> producing province in 2010. In 2009-2013, The Philippine Rural Development Program (PRDP) and the Department of Agriculture, Bicol Region had 39% share of Philippine <b>Abaca</b> production, emerged as the biggest produce while overwhelming 92% comes from Catanduanes the biggest <b>abaca</b> producing province in the country.
