Analytical optimal distortion expressions (under both matched and mismatched channel conditions) are obtained for the proposed HDA system with a linear <b>analog</b> <b>part</b> for a memoryless Gaussian source and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel under the mean squared error distortion measure. We consider two HDA coding schemes, both of which employ a vector quantizer cascaded with binary phaseshift keying (BPSK) modulation in the digital part, but differ in that they use linear (resp. non-linear) coding with pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) in the <b>analog</b> <b>part.</b> We derive an optimal power allocation scheme for the system with linear analog coding and present performance comparisons with purely analog and purely digital systems, {{as well as the}} scheme in [3]. Simulation results show that, under linear analog coding, the proposed scheme outperforms the scheme of [3] for medium to high channel signal-to-noise ratios (CSNRs). Furthermore, the performance of the HDA scheme with the linear <b>analog</b> <b>part</b> is within 1 dB of the optimal distortion bound for the mismatched HDA system for high CSNRs; for the scheme with non-linear analog coding, the performance can be improved at high CSNRs.
