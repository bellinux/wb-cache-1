40|$|Persistently active basaltic volcanoes are characterised by Strombolian eruptions that punctuate {{continuous}} passive degassing. Persistent passive degassing can {{be driven}} by an exchange flow of magma within the conduit. To interpret persistent gas emissions and changes in activity requires some knowledge of the flow regime {{and an understanding of}} how its volume flux depends on the physical properties of the magma and the conduit geometry. This thesis presents an experimental study of buoyancy-driven, low Reynolds number, (Re 5 ° the flow regime is always SBS flow, regardless of (3. The physical and chemical processes driving an exchange flow at Stromboli are con- strained by degassing and crystallisation paths to produce a 3 -phase (melt, crystals, bubbles) model of ascending and descending magma driving persistent gas fluxes at Stromboli, assuming a cylindrical pipe geometry. Combining modelled magma prop- erties with the <b>analogue</b> <b>exchange</b> flow experiments the flow regime of magma driving persistent degassing is defined as a function of pressure. At pressures 2 : 90 MPa the flow regime is CAF and at pressures;S 90 MPa the flow regime is SBS flow. Strombolian eruptions are posited to {{be driven by}} the ascent and bursting of large gas slugs. The influence of an exchange flow on the rise velocity of a gas slug is considered, and that of the gas slug on the geometry of an exchange flow. Analogue experiments are presented of gas slugs ascending through exchange flow with (3 > 1, scaled to basaltic volcanoes using the Reynolds, Eotvos, Froude and Strouhal numbers. Gas slugs rise through, and are constrained by the less viscous ascending fluid. Their rise velocities are shown to be a linear combination of the liquid velocity ahead of the gas slug and the rise velocity of the slug due to buoyancy. Its buoyant rise velocity {{is a function of the}} liquid viscosity, density and surface tension, and the lateral dimension of the less viscous fluid which it is constrained by. Given the calculated magma properties for ascending and descending magma at Stromboli gas slugs ascending through an exchange flow have velocities ranging from 1 - 3 m s-l. Further, experiments conducted in inclined pipes suggest that velocities may be increased by up to 56 % in a conduit inclined from the vertical.

A simple spin model for inverse melting is introduced and solved analytically for infinite range, constant paramagnetic exchange interaction. The random <b>exchange</b> <b>analogue</b> of this model yields inverse freezing, as implied by the analytic solution based on the replica trick. The qualitative features of this system (generalized Blume-Capel spin model) are shown to resemble a large class of inverse melting phenomena. The appearance of inverse melting is related to an exact rescaling of one of the interaction parameters that measures the entropy of the system.

40|$|A few {{naturally}} occurring insect tachykinin-related peptides, such as stomoxytachykinin (Stc-TK), contain an Ala-residue {{instead of the}} highly conserved Gly-residue that is present in most other members of this peptide family. Stc-TK is a potent, partial agonist of the stable fly (Stomoxys calcitrans) tachykinin receptor, STKR. By means of synthetic <b>analogues,</b> the Gly/Ala <b>exchange,</b> representing {{the addition of a}} single methyl group in the active core region of these peptides, was shown to be fully responsible for the generation of this partial agonism, which was also accompanied by an increase in agonistic potency. Surprisingly, this Ala-dependent reduction in maximal response levels was only observed for the agonist-induced cellular calcium rise. Stomoxytachykinin, Stc-TK, did not display partial agonism for the STKR-mediated cyclic AMP response. A possible explanation for this differential partial agonism is that the Gly-containing and Ala-replaced peptides recognize and stabilize active receptor conformations that differ in their functional coupling efficacies towards these response pathways. Drosotachykinins, Drm-TK, tachykinin-like peptides encoded in the fruit fly genome, were shown to be STKR-agonists. Interestingly, one of these peptides, which contains an Ala-residue instead of the conserved Gly-residue, also proved to be a potent, partial agonist for STKR. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.

40|$|A {{series of}} heavy {{alkaline}} earth metal tetrazolate complexes has been synthesized that contain metal ions saturated by aqua ligands. Tetrazolates with small ring-core carbon substituents favor formation of two dimensional polymers with u 3 -coordination of the tetrazolate {{to the metal}} centers. Tetrazolates with bulkier groups block coordination to the 1 - and 4 -nitrogen atoms, resulting in monomer formation. The first example of a trihydro(tetrazolyl) borate was prepared, and its bonding is heavily influenced by the basic BH 3 moiety. 18 -Crown- 6 adducts of dihydrobis(tetrazolyl) borate complexes have been prepared that contain B-N bonding to the 2 -nitrogen atoms, due to bulky ring-core atom substituents. A series of alkali metal hydrotris(tetrazolyl) borate complexes has been prepared by closely monitoring the reactions by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. The lithium hydrotris(tetrazolyl) borate complex contains k 3 -N,N,N bonding that is analgous to the bonding mode of hydrotris(pyrazolyl) borate ligands. The 18 -crown- 6 adducts of the sodium and potassium hydrotris(tetrazolyl) borate salts adopt n 2 -N,N and k 2 -N,H coordination modes, respectively, due to steric hindrances between the 18 -crown- 6 and hydrotris(tetrazolyl) borate ligands. The bonding modes of the hydrotris(tetrazolyl) borate complexes are stabilized by many hydrogen-bonding and dihydrogen-bonding contacts between the hydrotris(tetrazolyl) borate ligand and the ancillary ligand on the metal center. A series of poly(pyrazolyl) aluminate complexes containing aluminum-hydrogen bonds has been prepared, and these complexes exhibit similar coordination modes to their poly(pyrazolyl) borate <b>analogues.</b> Pyrazolyl <b>exchange</b> processes occur at room temperature in solution due to the weak Al-N and Al-H bonds. Salt metathesis of the new complexes with metal(II) halides yielded ligand, hydride, or pyrazolate transfer, depending on the metal and reaction conditions. The reactivity of 5 -substituted tetrazoles with lithium aluminum hydride was investigated {{in an attempt to}} prepare tetrakis(tetrazolyl) aluminate salts at low temperatures to avoid thermal decomposition of the parent tetrazoles. The reactions yielded complex reaction mixtures that were only soluble in polar solvents. A lithium tetrazolate was isolated from one of the reaction mixtures, which may be due to an equilibrium between the lithium tetrakis(tetrazolyl) aluminate complex and lithium and aluminum tetrazolate complexes in solution. All tetrazolate and poly(tetrazolyl) borate complexes presented herein are thermally stable above 200 °C, are insensitive to shock, friction, and electrical discharge, and can be handled safely. The tetrazolate complexes described herein deflagrate or explode upon exposure to a flame, and therefore may serve as secondary energetic materials or colorants in pyrotechnics.

These special elements correspond to the reduced expressions, which are constructed by the algorithm, for some special conjugacy class representatives of minimal length, one in each class. Quasi-parabolic subgroups are introduced for investigating representations of Ariki- Koike algebras. We use n x n arrays of non-negative integer sequences to characterize double cosets of quasi-parabolic subgroups.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{concentration}} polarization in electrodialytic desalination occurs due to mass transfer limitations within thin film layers adjacent to anion and cation exchange membranes. Each type of membrane behaves quite differently in electrodialysis. Anion exchange membranes promote water ionization while cation exchange membranes do not. Control of water ionization is desirable since it limits process efficiency. Studies {{have been conducted}} {{to better understand the}} nature of each solution-membrane interface and suggest why each behaves differently. ^ Experiments designed to promote concentration polarization (interfacial ionic depletion) have been conducted for characterization of several different ion exchange membranes by their limiting current behavior as a function of flow velocity in a small 9 x 10 membrane stack. The Nernst film model was employed along with an analogy between heat and mass transfer for a flat plate for comparison of experiment and theory. Results for anion exchange membranes were in good agreement with theory whereas cation exchange membranes exhibited limiting currents well beyond those theoretically expected. ^ Theoretical quantum mechanical calculations indicate that stronger ion-solvent interactions exist for ions present at cation exchange membrane-solution interfaces (-SO 3 - affixed to the membrane and Na+ moving from solution into membrane) relative to anion exchange membrane-solution interfaces (-N(CH 3) 3 + affixed to the membrane and Cl- moving from solution into membrane). ^ Spectroscopic experiments in the 1300 - 1800 nm region of the near infrared suggest that interactions having a significantly greater effect on water structure are present in the case of concentrated (2 N) solutions containing a cation <b>exchange</b> membrane solution <b>analogue</b> (p-toluenesulfonic acid, sodium salt) relative to similar solutions containing an anion <b>exchange</b> <b>analogue</b> (benzyl-trimethylammonium chloride). ^ In the final analysis, modifications to solvent (water) structure are believed {{due to the nature of}} ion hydration in the vicinity of the cation exchange membrane-solution interface. Along with the presence of high electric fields induced by polarization in the interface region that increase exchange rates of primary hydration water with bulk water due to accelerated dipole reorientation (75), the combined effects may enhance cation mobility/diffusivity under these conditions. The result then being a suppression of water ionization at cation exchange membranes due to the enhanced flux, versus absence of a similar effect at anion exchange membranes. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we build {{a model that}} can be used to {{describe}} baryon dynamics, and in particular we look for an interaction potential between the basic nucleons (proton and neutron). To do that, we follow an approach that mixes two ideas: the description of particles as topological solitons in nonlinear field theory and the Anti de Sitter / Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence. We study large N QCD by studying the action of the low energy modes of a string theory. We see that this theory adimts topological solitons called instantons, and quantization of the degrees of freedom of an instantonic field of charge one creates a quantum system with states whose transformation properties and quantum numbers are just right to interpret them as states with a definite rest energy, an impulse, a spin and an isospin degrees of freedom. In this picture, we build a charge two field configuration by gluing together two single charge instanton solutions. Due to the non linearity of the theory, this solution is approximative, and we show that it holds in the limit of large 't Hooft coupling. In those limits, we compute the energy of this field configuration, and interpret the result as a potential of interaction between instantons. This is proposed as a classical potential for baryon interaction, and its structure as infinite sum of Yukawa monopole and dipole interactions is interpreted as the classical <b>analogue</b> of an <b>exchange</b> interaction with a meson mediator. We show how the masses of baryons and mesons can be computed in this model. After computing the potential, we quantize the coordinates of the two instanton fields, and impose physical constraints to restrict the spectrum of the system. We see that the internal degrees of freedom of the system can be rearranged and interpreted as total spin and isospin of the system, and that they assume only integer values. Among the states that are compatible with our constraints, we find a state with the right angular quantum numbers (spin one and isospin zero) and interpret it as deuteron state. We compute the stability of this state with respect to the splitting in two separated baryons, and make a similar analysis for other low energy states in the spectrum. We comment the large N and large 't Hooft coupling limit, comparing our results with the qualitative predictions of large N QCD, and extrapolate the binding energy of the deuteron...|$|R

The lanthanide complexes have high thermodynamic stability (log K(LnL) = 17. 7 - 18. 7) and good selectivity for lanthanide ions versus the endogenous cations Zn(2 +), Cu(2 +), and Ca(2 +) thus preventing transmetalation. A variable temperature and pressure (17) O NMR study combined with nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion measurements yielded the microscopic parameters characterizing water exchange and rotation. Bishydration of the lanthanide cation in the complexes, an important advantage to obtain high relaxivity for the Gd(3 +) chelates, has been demonstrated by (17) O chemical shifts for the Gd(3 +) complexes and by luminescence lifetime measurements for the Yb(3 +) <b>analogues.</b> The water <b>exchange</b> on the three Gd(3 +) complexes is considerably faster (k(ex) (298) = (13. 9 - 15. 4) × 10 (6) s(- 1)) than on commercial Gd(3 +) -based contrast agents and proceeds via a dissociative mechanism, as evidenced by the large positive activation volumes for GdL 1 and GdL 2 (+ 10. 3 ± 0. 9 and + 10. 6 ± 0. 9 cm(3) mol(- 1), respectively). The relaxivity of GdL 1 is doubled at 40 MHz and 298 K in fetal bovine serum (r(1) = 16. 1 vs 8. 5 mM(- 1) s(- 1) in HEPES buffer), due to hydrophobic interactions between the chelate and serum proteins. The isoquinoline core allows for the optimization of the optical properties of the luminescent lanthanide complexes in comparison to the pyridinic analogues and provides significant shifts of the excitation energies toward lower values which therefore become more adapted for biological applications. L 2 and L 3 bear two methoxy substituents on the aromatic core in ortho and para positions, respectively, that further modulate their electronic structure. The Nd(3 +) and Yb(3 +) complexes of the ligand L 3, which incorporates the p-dimethoxyisoquinoline moiety, can be excited up to 420 nm. This wavelength is shifted over 100 nm toward lower energy in comparison to the pyridine-based analogue. The luminescence quantum yields of the Nd(3 +) (0. 013 - 0. 016 %) and Yb(3 +) chelates (0. 028 - 0. 040 %) are in the range of the best nonhydrated complexes, despite the presence of two inner sphere water molecules. More importantly, the 980 nm NIR emission band of YbL 3 was detected with a good sensitivity in a proof of concept microscopy experiment at a concentration of 10 μM in fetal bovine serum. Our results demonstrate that even bishydrated NIR lanthanide complexes can emit a sufficient number of photons to ensure sensitive detection in practical applications. In particular, these ligands containing an aromatic core with coordinating pyridine nitrogen can be easily modified to tune the optical properties of the NIR luminescent lanthanide complexes while retaining good complex stability and MRI characteristics for the Gd(3 +) analogues. They constitute a highly versatile platform for the development of bimodal MR and optical imaging probes based on a simple mixture of Gd(3 +) and Yb(3 +) /Nd(3 +) complexes using an identical chelator. Given the presence of two inner sphere water molecules, important for MRI applications of the corresponding Gd(3 +) analogues, this result is particularly exciting and opens wide perspectives not only for NIR imaging based on Ln(3 +) ions but also for the design of combined NIR optical and MRI probes...|$|R
