25|$|The convenience, low cost, and {{mobility}} {{of this method}} distinguish it from conventional testing and are the primary reasons for its growing popularity. The method is convenient because all required sound system, power generation and distribution and data acquisition and control equipment is brought to the test site. Equipment is usually leased for each test event. There is no large investment in a facility, equipment or personnel required {{on the part of}} the customer. A diesel generator is the preferred power source, therefore providing clean on-site electrical power in a consistent configuration for connection to the MSI power distribution equipment. This removes the demand for large quantities of power from the test facility. In addition, testing can be performed at a much lower cost per test compared to the installation, operation and maintenance of a more standard high intensity reverberant <b>acoustic</b> <b>chamber</b> system. Finally, mobility allows this test method to be performed at almost any time and place in the normal test article integration and test flow. The test equipment is completely portable and no special facility or infrastructure is required.|$|E
2500|$|In 1987, Tríona and Irish-American flutist Brian Dunning joined Ó Domhnaill and Oskay to {{form the}} band Nightnoise. The quartet's first album Something of Time was {{released}} by Windham Hill Records in 1987. It was followed by At the End of the Evening (1988) and The Parting Tide (1990). These albums received significant commercial and critical acclaim, and helped the group develop an impressive reputation touring the United States, Japan, and Europe. Their music effectively combined [...] "original <b>acoustic</b> <b>chamber</b> music with an Irish feel mixing jazz, classical, folk and new age idioms." [...] Their original music made full use of the Ó Domhnaill's folk background, the folk/jazz combinations of Skara Brae, Brian Dunning's jazz background, and Bill Oskay's classical influences.|$|E
2500|$|In September, {{he became}} the manager and {{producer}} of Morris; both had quit with Somebody's Image. Meldrum produced Morris' first solo single, a Johnny Young-composed song, [...] "The Real Thing". Young had written the song for Meldrum's friend Burns, but when Meldrum heard Young playing it backstage during a taping of the TV pop show Uptight, he determined to secure it for Morris, reportedly going to Young's home that night with a tape recorder and refusing to leave until Young had taped a demo version. In collaboration with Armstrong's house engineer John Sayers, Meldrum radically transformed [...] "The Real Thing" [...] from Young's original vision of a simple <b>acoustic</b> <b>chamber</b> ballad backed by strings, into a heavily produced studio masterpiece, extending it to an unheard-of six minutes in length (with encouragement from Rofe) and overdubbing the basic track with many additional instruments, vocals and sound effects. To achieve this, they used the services of his friends from The Groop as the backing band, with contributions from vocalist Maureen Elkner, The Groop's lead singer Ronnie Charles, guitarist Roger Hicks from Zoot—who played the song's distinctive acoustic guitar intro—and arranger John Farrar.|$|E

40|$|The {{hormonal}} {{response to}} a spectrum of intrasexual social stimuli was studied in captive Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater). Males were housed in individual cages in one of four conditions: (1) in a semicircle with other males (= visual + vocal stimuli), (2) in <b>acoustic</b> <b>chambers</b> with visual access to a devocalized companion (= visual stimuli only), (3) in chambers in which a tutor tape was played daily (= vocal stimuli only), and (4) in <b>acoustic</b> <b>chambers</b> with no other input (neither visual nor social stimuli). Blood samples were taken at 2 -week intervals throughout the {{spring and early summer}} and assayed for testosterone. The results indicate that the greatest increase in testosterone was in the birds receiving visual plus vocal stimuli and in those receiving only visual stimuli; males receiving only vocal stimuli had a muted endocrine response, and those receiving no social stimulation exhibited the briefest response. The relatively small response to vocal stimulation is consistent with the absence of a behavioral response to simulated territorial intrusions (i. e., song playbacks) that has been shown in previous studies in male cowbirds...|$|R

50|$|This {{pressure}} field {{is generated by}} multifrequency sirens powered by nitrogen or compressed air modulators. This system can generate sound pressure levels up to 160 dBSPL. Each <b>acoustic</b> <b>chamber</b> has its own configurations, but each siren is centered on a frequency where sound pressure levels are the highest. In some cases these sirens can be completed with electroacoustic systems to generate and control midrange and high frequencies. Sirens generate low frequencies, but with high sound pressure levels distortion appears that leads to higher harmonics. Loudspeakers are used in some chambers to control these frequencies.|$|E
