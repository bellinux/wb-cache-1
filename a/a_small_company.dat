5|$|In September 2001 {{development}} {{began on}} a new project, Sam & Max Plunge Through Space. The game was to be an Xbox exclusive title, developed by Infinite Machine, <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>company</b> consisting {{of a number of}} former LucasArts employees. The story of the game was developed by Purcell and fellow designer Chuck Jordan and involved the Freelance Police travelling the galaxy to find a stolen Statue of Liberty. However, Infinite Machine went bankrupt within a year, partially due to the failure of their first game, New Legends, and the project was abandoned.|$|E

5|$|Before the Beatles {{achieved}} nationwide {{success in}} Britain, Epstein had permitted <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>company</b> (run by his cousins, and which initially catered only to fan club members) to produce Beatles' sweaters for 30 shillings and badges for six pence, eventually selling 15,000 sweaters and 50,000 badges as the Beatles' popularity grew. When Beatlemania stormed the UK in 1963, Epstein was besieged by novelty goods companies wanting to use The Beatles' name and images on plastic guitars, drums, disc racks, badges, belts {{and a huge}} variety of assorted merchandise. Epstein was adamant that the Beatles would not directly endorse any product, but through NEMS Enterprises he would grant discretionary licences to companies {{who were able to}} produce a quality product at a fair price, although many companies were already selling products without a licence.|$|E
50|$|On April 15, 2016, Polycom {{announced}} that rival Mitel Networks would purchase them, for $1.96 billion. Mitel, <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>company</b> based in Ottawa, Canada, pays a lower tax rate. The acquisition {{may be an}} example of tax inversion, where <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>company</b> purchases <b>a</b> larger company in order to provide the combined larger corporate entity with the tax benefits of the <b>smaller</b> <b>company's</b> location.|$|R

Using case study approach, this applied project studied <b>a</b> <b>small</b> local exporter <b>company,</b> examined company’s main areas of concern and made a set of recommendations meant to address key issues of company’s operations...|$|R
5|$|In 1952, {{along with}} his brother, William, and a mutual friend from law school, he became a {{founding}} partner of the Cincinnati law firm Keating, Muething & Keating. Beginning in the late 1950s they took on Carl Lindner, Jr. as a client. Lindner was rapidly accumulating ice cream stores, supermarkets, real estate, and savings and loans, and soon essentially became Keating's sole client. In 1956, he filed requests for Q clearances on behalf of <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>company</b> of former Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory scientists with an office in Newtown, Ohio; unknown to Keating, the FBI suspected the application was fraudulent and launched an investigation of him, but no charges were made. Keating {{was admitted to the}} U.S. Supreme Court bar in 1958.|$|E
5|$|Montgomery began entrenching {{his troops}} around the fort on September 18, and {{constructing}} a mortar battery {{south of the}} fort. He ordered Brown to establish a position at La Prairie, one of the sites {{where there was a}} crossing of the Saint Lawrence River to Montreal. Ethan Allen went with <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>company</b> of Americans to collect Canadiens that Livingston had been recruiting, and take them to monitor Longueuil, the other major crossing point. Livingston had established a base at Point-Olivier, below Fort Chambly, another aging fort at the base of some rapids in the Richelieu River, and was urging his compatriots to join him there. Some Loyalists attempted to dissuade others from joining with Livingston; Livingston's supporters sometimes violently opposed attempts by Loyalists to organize, and Carleton did nothing at the time to assist the Loyalists outside the city.|$|E
5|$|Vanajan Autotehdas {{was always}} <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>company,</b> {{employing}} about 400 people in 1968, {{and in the}} 1960s its market share was barely 5% in Finland. Almost all Vanajas were sold for the domestic market; only a few units were exported. Vanaja vehicles became known for their robust construction and high degree of customisation. The number of Vanaja bus chassis and lorries totalled 7,140 units; this consists of 260 lorry and 66 bus chassis models; for 116 lorry models {{only one or two}} units were produced. Vanajas had a good reputation and they are nowadays valued by vintage vehicle enthusiasts.|$|E

5|$|In 1525 Pedro de Alvarado sent <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>company</b> {{to conquer}} Mixco Viejo (Chinautla Viejo), {{the capital of}} the Poqomam. At the Spanish approach, the {{inhabitants}} remained enclosed in the fortified city. The Spanish attempted an approach from the west through a narrow pass but were forced back with heavy losses. Alvarado himself launched the second assault with 200 Tlaxcalan allies but was also beaten back. The Poqomam then received reinforcements, possibly from Chinautla, and the two armies clashed on open ground outside of the city. The battle was chaotic and lasted {{for most of the day}} but was finally decided by the Spanish cavalry, forcing the Poqomam reinforcements to withdraw. The leaders of the reinforcements surrendered to the Spanish three days after their retreat and revealed that the city had a secret entrance in the form of a cave leading up from a nearby river, allowing the inhabitants to come and go.|$|E

Alvarado sent 40 men to cover the exit from the cave and launched another assault along the ravine, in single file owing to its narrowness, with crossbowmen alternating with musketmen, each with a companion sheltering him with a shield. This tactic allowed the Spanish to break through the pass and storm the entrance of the city. The Poqomam warriors fell back in disorder in a chaotic retreat through the city. Those who managed to retreat down the neighbouring valley were ambushed by Spanish cavalry who had been posted to block the exit from the cave, the survivors were captured and brought back to the city. The siege had lasted more than a month, and because of the defensive strength of the city, Alvarado ordered it to be burned and moved the inhabitants to the new colonial village of Mixco.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of July 8, Lyon opened fire on the Alice Dean, {{intending}} to destroy or disable the steamers. The men had only ever fired the cannon at celebratory events and were unsure how to aim it properly. Two shots were fired, with the second one hitting the upper deck of the McCombs, passing through the ship and landing near {{a group of men}} on the shore, wounding a Confederate. Just as the shelling began Provost Marshal John Timberlake arrived on the scene from Corydon with <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>company</b> of reinforcements and assumed command. Timberlake, who was a colonel in the regular army, believed Morgan's force was small, and decided to spare the steamships and instead shell the massed cavalry. Before the cannon could be re-aimed, the superior Confederate artillery was set up and returned fire from their significantly higher position {{on the opposite side of}} the river. The dense morning fog in the valley obliged the Confederates to guess at their target. Their first shot landed short of the Legion's position, and the second shot landed behind them and leveled the cabin. The Legion defenders set off a third shot that had already been loaded into their cannon, and fled into a nearby forest. As they moved up the ridge and into the woods, they became visible to the Confederate artillery who began to shell the forest. One shot struck a log where two of the defenders had stopped to rest. They were mortally wounded while the rest fled into the forest as the Confederates continued to shell the landing.|$|E

25|$|The {{identities of}} the parties. Who is suing whom?
