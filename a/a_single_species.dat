5|$|Another {{analogous}} case within <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>species</b> {{has been}} termed Browerian mimicry (after Lincoln P. Brower and Jane Van Zandt Brower). This {{is a case}} of bipolar (only two species involved) automimicry; the model is the same species as its mimic. Equivalent to Batesian mimicry within <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>species,</b> it occurs when there is a palatability spectrum within a population of harmful prey. For example, monarch (Danaus plexippus) caterpillars feed on milkweed species of varying toxicity. Some feed on more toxic plants, and store these toxins within themselves. The more palatable caterpillars thus profit from the more toxic members of the same species.|$|E
5|$|Another {{model of}} the {{evolution}} of Carcharocles, proposed in 2001 by paleontologist Michael Benton, is that the three other species are actually <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>species</b> of shark that gradually changed over time between the Paleocene and the Pliocene, making it a chronospecies. Some authors suggest that C. auriculatus, C. angustidens, and C. chubutensis should be classified as <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>species</b> in the genus Otodus, leaving C. megalodon the sole member of Carcharocles.|$|E

5|$|Though {{often used}} interchangeably, in biology these words have {{different}} meanings. Fish {{is used as}} a singular noun, or as a plural to describe multiple individuals from <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>species.</b> Fishes is used to describe different species or species groups. Thus a pond that contained <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>species</b> might be said to contain 120 fish. But if the pond contained a total of 120 fish from three different species, it would be said to contain three fishes. The distinction is similar to that between people and peoples.|$|E
5|$|Figs have an obligate {{mutualism}} with fig wasps, (Agaonidae); figs {{are only}} pollinated by fig wasps, and fig wasps can only reproduce in fig flowers. Generally, each fig species depends on <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>species</b> of wasp for pollination. The wasps are similarly {{dependent on their}} fig species in order to reproduce. Ficus aurea is pollinated by Pegoscapus mexicanus (Ashmead).|$|E
5|$|The {{common and}} Asian house martins have {{sometimes}} been {{considered to be}} <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>species,</b> although both breed in the western Himalayas without hybridising.

5|$|The pygmy slow loris {{was first}} {{described}} scientifically by J. Lewis Bonhote in 1907. The description {{was based on}} a male specimen sent to him by J.Vassal, a French physician who had collected the specimen from Nha Trang, Vietnam (then called Annam, a French Protectorate) in 1905. In 1939, Reginald Innes Pocock combined all slow lorises into <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>species,</b> Nycticebus coucang.|$|E
5|$|The {{sizes of}} plant genera vary widely from those {{containing}} <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>species</b> to genera containing thousands of species, and this disparity became clear {{early in the}} history of plant classification.

5|$|The {{three species}} of the {{subgenus}} Zanda have been variously considered as two, then as <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>species</b> for many years. In a 1979 paper, Australian ornithologist Denis Saunders highlighted the similarity between the short-billed and the southern race xanthanotus of the yellow-tailed and treated them as <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>species</b> with the long-billed as a distinct species. He proposed that Western Australia had been colonised on two separate occasions, once by a common ancestor of all three forms (which became the long-billed black cockatoo), and later by what has become the short-billed black cockatoo. However, an analysis of protein allozymes published in 1984 revealed the two Western Australian forms to be {{more closely related to}} each other than to the yellow-tailed, and the consensus since then has been to treat them as three separate species.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two forms}} of the Javan slow loris, {{distinguished}} mainly by differences in hair length. These have occasionally been recognized as separate species, N.javanicus and N.ornatus, but are currently both classified as <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>species,</b> although their exact taxonomic status remains unclear.|$|E
5|$|These {{characteristics}} are genetically inherited {{and has been}} interpreted as {{the early stages of}} the speciation process. The two ecotypes will eventually become separate species once reproductive isolation is achieved. At the moment, both ecotypes are still capable of interbreeding and producing viable offspring, as such they are still considered <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E

5|$|Views on the {{evolutionary}} {{position of the}} monkey-flower species have changed.

The genus Phryma (comprising only <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>species),</b> for which the family is named, is considerably different in morphology from all of the monkey-flowers.|$|E
5|$|A second {{species of}} Voalavo, eastern voalavo, was named in 2005 from central Madagascar. Morphological {{differences}} between the two are subtle but consistent, and the cytochrome b sequences of the two species differ by about 10%. In mammals, closely related species regularly differ by less than 5% in their cytochrome b sequences, and a divergence of more than 5% within <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>species</b> suggests the presence of cryptic species.|$|E
5|$|Babakotia is an extinct genus of {{medium-sized}} lemur, or strepsirrhine primate, from Madagascar {{that contains}} <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>species,</b> Babakotia radofilai. Together with Palaeopropithecus, Archaeoindris, and Mesopropithecus, it forms the family Palaeopropithecidae, {{commonly known as}} the sloth lemurs. The name Babakotia comes from the Malagasy name for the indri, babakoto, to which it and all other sloth lemurs are closely related. Due to its mix of morphological traits that show intermediate stages between the slow-moving smaller sloth lemurs and the suspensory large sloth lemurs, it has helped determine the relationship between both groups and the closely related and extinct monkey lemurs.|$|E

5|$|Beetles {{are able}} to exploit a wide {{diversity}} of food sources available in their many habitats. Some are omnivores, eating both plants and animals. Other beetles are highly specialized in their diet. Many species of leaf beetles, longhorn beetles, and weevils are very host-specific, feeding on only <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>species</b> of plant. Ground beetles and rove beetles (Staphylinidae), among others, are primarily carnivorous and catch and consume many other arthropods and small prey, such as earthworms and snails. While most predatory beetles are generalists, a few species have more specific prey requirements or preferences.|$|E
5|$|Euchambersia is a genus of therocephalian therapsid {{that lived}} during the Late Permian, {{approximately}} 255 million years ago, {{in what is}} now South Africa. The genus contains <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>species,</b> E. mirabilis, named by paleontologist Robert Broom in 1931 from a skull missing the lower jaws; a second skull, belonging to an immature individual, was later described.

5|$|German ornithologist Erwin Stresemann lumped all Australian corvids plus {{other species}} {{as far as}} India into <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>species,</b> C. coronoides, as he {{believed}} there was intergradation between all characteristics such as iris colour, colour of feather bases and plumage. This was hotly disputed by Mathews. The official RAOU checklist listed three species (Australian raven, Torresian crow and little crow), with the little raven recognised as a fourth species in 1967 and forest raven in 1970. Streseman described C. difficilis in 1943 from a single specimen, now {{thought to have been}} an unusual Australian raven or an Australian raven/Torresian crow hybrid.|$|E
