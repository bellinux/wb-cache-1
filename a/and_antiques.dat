This led to incongruous elements, such as the private cinema, whose walls were lined with shelves of rare books. The floor plan of the Main Building is chaotic due to his habit of buying centuries-old ceilings, which dictated the proportions and decor of various rooms.|$|E

25|$|In 1982, Berdella began renting his own {{booth at}} the Westport Flea Market. This store was named Bob's Bizarre Bazaar, and {{primarily}} sold and traded primitive art, jewelry, <b>and</b> <b>antiques.</b> Although occasionally making a generous monthly profit, the income he typically generated via this business was often not sufficient to maintain his daily expenses and to make ends meet. Resultingly, Berdella would occasionally have to either sell goods to fellow merchants at a profit loss, or steal or scavenge for items to sell at his booth. Additionally, he would often take lodgers at his home {{as a means of}} gaining additional income.|$|E

It now houses Beirut's most influential and popular art museum. The permanent collection shows a set of Japanese engravings, numerous works of Islamic art and classic Italian paintings, while temporary exhibitions are also shown throughout the year.

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} death of Berdella's father, his mother remarried. This act was met with resentment by her older son, who viewed the move as a form of {{betrayal}} against his father. As a result, Berdella became increasingly withdrawn, and further immersed himself in the solitary activities he had participated in since childhood such as painting, collecting coins and stamps, and writing to foreign pen pals. Berdella would later claim that his hobby of writing to pen pals in countries such as Vietnam and Burma and the fact these pen pals would send him stamps for his collection, and photographs of mythical and historical icons, ancient cultures, and architecture would lead to his developing an avid interest in primitive art, photographs, <b>and</b> <b>antiques.</b> From approximately 1965, he would begin avidly collecting these artifacts; this practice would later inspire him to open his own business in 1982.|$|E
