5|$|In 1919, Rutherford {{had succeeded}} in {{disintegrating}} nitrogen atoms with alpha particles emitted from decaying radium atoms. This and subsequent experiments hinted at the structure of atomic nuclei. To explore it further, he needed an artificial means of creating particles with a velocity high enough to overcome the charge of the nucleus. This opened {{a new line of}} research at the Cavendish Laboratory. He assigned Cockcroft, Thomas Allibone and Ernest Walton to the problem. They built what became known as a Cockcroft–Walton accelerator. Mark Oliphant designed a proton source for them. A crucial moment came when Cockcroft read a paper by George Gamow on quantum tunnelling. Cockcroft realised {{that as a result of}} this phenomenon, the desired effect could be achieved with much lower voltages than first thought. In fact, he calculated that protons with energy of just 300,000 electronvolts would be able to penetrate a boron nucleus. Cockcroft and Walton worked on their accelerator for the next two years. Rutherford obtained a £1,000 grant from the University of Cambridge for them to buy <b>a</b> <b>transformer</b> <b>and</b> other equipment they needed.|$|E
25|$|Today, some {{locomotives}} in {{this system}} use <b>a</b> <b>transformer</b> <b>and</b> rectifier to provide low-voltage pulsating direct current to motors. Speed is controlled by switching winding taps on the transformer. More sophisticated locomotives use thyristor or IGBT circuitry to generate chopped or even variable-frequency alternating current (AC) that is then supplied to the AC induction traction motors.|$|E
25|$|On simple, usually {{temporary}} layouts, {{power is}} supplied by a power pack consisting of <b>a</b> <b>transformer</b> <b>and</b> rectifier (DC), a rheostat for regulating power to the track (and thus train speed), and reversing to control model direction. On permanent layouts, multiple power supplies are traditionally used, with the trackage divided into electrically isolated sections called blocks; toggle or rotary switches (sometimes relays) are used to select which power supply controls the train in a particular block. With the advent of digital command control, block divisions are largely eliminated, as the computerized controllers can control any train anywhere on the track at any time.|$|E

500|$|In {{conventional}} graph {{representation of}} circuits, {{there is no}} means of explicitly representing mutual inductive couplings, such as occurs in <b>a</b> <b>transformer,</b> <b>and</b> such components {{may result in a}} disconnected graph with more than one separate part. [...] For convenience of analysis, a graph with multiple parts can be combined into a single graph by unifying one node in each part into a single node. [...] This makes no difference to the theoretical behaviour of the circuit so analysis carried out on it is still valid. [...] It would, however, make a practical difference if a circuit were to be implemented this way in that it would destroy the isolation between the parts. [...] An example would be a transformer earthed on both the primary and secondary side. [...] The transformer still functions as a transformer with the same voltage ratio but can now no longer be used as an isolation transformer.|$|E
2500|$|Depending on what {{is being}} controlled, a forced-air air {{conditioning}} thermostat generally has an external switch for heat/off/cool, and another on/auto to turn the blower fan on constantly or only when heating and cooling are running. [...] Four wires come to the centrally-located thermostat from the main heating/cooling unit (usually located in a closet, basement, or occasionally in the attic): One wire, usually red, supplies 24 volts AC power to the thermostat, while the other three supply control signals from the thermostat, usually white for heat, yellow for cooling, and green {{to turn on the}} blower fan. [...] The power is supplied by <b>a</b> <b>transformer,</b> <b>and</b> when the thermostat makes contact between the 24 volt power and {{one or two of the}} other wires, a relay back at the heating/cooling unit activates the corresponding heat/fan/cool function of the unit(s).|$|E

50|$|Cord sets must be {{distinguished}} from AC adapters, where the connector also contains <b>a</b> <b>transformer,</b> <b>and</b> possibly rectifiers, filters and regulators.

5000|$|Like any <b>transformer,</b> <b>a</b> current <b>transformer</b> has <b>a</b> primary winding, a {{core and}} a {{secondary}} winding, although some transformers, including current <b>transformers,</b> use <b>an</b> air core.
