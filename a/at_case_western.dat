25|$|In 1999 {{researchers}} <b>at</b> <b>Case</b> <b>Western</b> Reserve University, in Cleveland, Ohio, led by Hunter Peckham, used 64-electrode EEG skullcap {{to return}} limited hand movements to quadriplegic Jim Jatich. As Jatich concentrated on simple but opposite concepts like up and down, his beta-rhythm EEG output was analysed using software to identify {{patterns in the}} noise. A basic pattern was identified and used to control a switch: Above average activity was set to on, below average off. As well as enabling Jatich to control a computer cursor the signals were also used to drive the nerve controllers embedded in his hands, restoring some movement.|$|E
25|$|As for vCJD in humans, autopsy {{tests are}} not always done, so those figures, too, {{are likely to be}} too low, but {{probably}} by a lesser fraction. In the United Kingdom, anyone with possible vCJD symptoms must be reported to the Creutzfeldt–Jakob Disease Surveillance Unit. In the United States, the CDC has refused to impose a national requirement that physicians and hospitals report cases of the disease. Instead, the agency relies on other methods, including death certificates and urging physicians to send suspicious cases to the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center (NPDPSC) <b>at</b> <b>Case</b> <b>Western</b> Reserve University in Cleveland, which is funded by the CDC.|$|E

500|$|Harding had an extramarital {{affair with}} Carrie Fulton Phillips of Marion, which lasted about fifteen years before ending in 1920. Letters from Harding to Phillips were {{discovered}} by Harding biographer Francis Russell {{in the possession}} of Marion attorney Donald Williamson while Russell was researching his book in 1963. Before that, the affair was not generally known. Williamson donated the letters to the Ohio Historical Society. Some there wanted the letters destroyed to preserve what remained of Harding's reputation. A lawsuit ensued, with Harding's heirs claiming copyright over the letters. The case was ultimately settled in 1971, with the letters donated to the Library of Congress. They were sealed until 2014, but before their opening, historians used copies <b>at</b> <b>Case</b> <b>Western</b> Reserve University and in Russell's papers at the University of Wyoming. Russell concluded from the letters that Phillips was the love of Harding's life— [...] "the enticements of his mind and body combined in one person", but historian Justin P. Coffey in his 2014 review of Harding biographies criticizes him for [...] "obsess over Harding's sex life".|$|E
