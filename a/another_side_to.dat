500|$|Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones: The {{archaeologist}} adventurer {{who seeks}} to rescue {{his father and}} find the Holy Grail. Ford said he loved the idea of introducing Indiana's father because it allowed him to explore <b>another</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> Indiana's personality: [...] "These are men who have never made any accommodation to each other. Indy behaves differently in his father's presence. Who else would dare call Indy 'junior'?" ...|$|E

Perry Como's voice is widely known for its good-natured vocal acrobatics as portrayed in his highly popular novelty songs such as [...] "Hot Diggity (Dog Ziggity Boom)", but there was <b>another</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> Perry Como. Music critic Gene Lees describes it in his sleeve note to Como's 1968 album Look To Your Heart: ...|$|E
500|$|The band's defense {{attorney}} Steve Graham {{spoke on the}} incident claiming, [...] "There is <b>another</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> this.

[...] He also told police that the band members had offered to surrender but never heard anything back, [...] "I made it clear that I could get the guys up here ASAP and they would cooperate." ...|$|E

500|$|... "No Can Do" [...] was {{released}} {{as the second}} and final single from Catfights and Spotlights. When Digital Spy questioned group member Keisha Buchanan about her reaction to its release, she responded: [...] "I'm really excited about it. I'm looking forward to people hearing <b>another</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> the album. This single has got a kind of Jackson 5 feel to it which I love. The whole album has got a really old-school, laid-back Motown sound, so hopefully 'No Can Do' will get more people interested in the album." [...] "No Can Do" [...] {{was released}} as a digital download in the United Kingdom and Ireland on 19 December 2008. The following day, it was made available as a CD single, which consists of three remixes of the track and a cover version of Keane's song [...] "Spiralling".|$|E
500|$|Waddington {{resented the}} class {{divisions}} in English cricket, his feelings fuelled by experiences of {{officers in the}} war and possibly his tour to Australia in 1920–21. He fully embraced Yorkshire's hard-edged competitiveness in the early 1920s: he questioned the decisions of umpires and sledged opposing batsmen, {{both of which were}} unusual at the time. His Times obituary noted that some disagreements came because Waddington played to win and was an enthusiastic appealer, although he was unlikely to win many appeals for leg before wicket because of the angle at which he bowled. Anthony Woodhouse, the cricket historian, describes Waddington as a [...] "wild and irresponsible...quick-tempered individual". But there was <b>another</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> his personality; he was a good talker and liked to wear smart clothes, including monogrammed silk shirts. Sutcliffe, a close friend and teammate of Waddington, called him [...] "a genial fellow in the dressing room; a man with a rare personality, proof of which is shown by the fact that whenever there was a discussion of any kind in the dressing room, Abe generally ruled it, to all intents and purposes, the chairman." [...] The cricket writer Jim Kilburn wrote that [...] "at his best, [...] was a magnificently hostile bowler {{with one of the most}} beautiful actions ever seen in cricket, and his pace and break-back were a problem for the greatest of batsmen". The historian Leslie Duckworth summed him up: [...] "Yes, a man of temper, Waddington, but a fine cricketer." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other of Minulescu's contemporaries, {{among them}} Davidescu, {{argued that the}} popular appeal of his poetry (which they {{referred}} to as Minulescianism), was turning into mere fashion. Speaking of <b>another</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> this trend, Vianu evidenced that, from as early as his debut novel, Minulescu had become the source of [...] "an industry of Minulescian parody"; the writer Victor Eftimiu recalled that his first successful writing had been a piece which mocked Minulescu's poem Romanţa celor trei romanţe ("The Romance of the Three Romances"), and was titled Romanţa celor trei sarmale ("The Romance of the Three Sarmale").|$|E
50|$|In addition, if {{the density}} of the {{atmosphere}} (and corresponding greenhouse effect) were dramatically reduced, the surface temperature (now effectively constant) would probably vary widely between dayside and nightside. <b>Another</b> <b>side</b> effect <b>to</b> atmospheric-density reduction could be the creation of zones of dramatic weather activity or storms at the terminator because large volumes of atmosphere underwent rapid heating or cooling.|$|R

2500|$|Norwood {{eventually}} {{decided to}} scrap {{most of the}} project, and instead enlisted Timbaland, with whom the couple had previously worked on Kiley Dean's unreleased Simple Girl album, as the album's main contributor. Impressed by Timaland's input, Norwood rediscovered the musical affection, she had missed on Full Moon and its technical priority. [...] "I made the change because I needed to evolve. I needed to explore my talent and versatility and see if I had <b>another</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> me, another sound," [...] she said about collaborating. [...] "I wanted to do my own thing, and I've always {{wanted to work with}} Timbaland [...] and see how my voice would sound over his tracks. It was an edgier Brandy, a sassier sound, but still with a lot of heart and a lot of passion." [...] With the help of Timbaland protégés such as Candice Nelson, Steve [...] "Static" [...] Garrett, and co-producer Walter Millsap III the pair worked on what was tentatively titled B-Rocka — a nickname actually given to her by Jerkins — and originally planned for a Christmas 2003 release. Their first collaboration, 1990s tribute [...] "Turn It Up", was leaked onto the internet in autumn 2003, and soon released as a promotional buzz track.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Another</b> <b>side</b> effect <b>to</b> these clashes was to {{galvanize}} the producers. When {{two of the}} episodes were held back for review, Everson and Nickell chose to run a looping message in their place, which asked viewers to write in.

Chiles made <b>another</b> <b>side</b> trip <b>to</b> Volusia County on the east coast, passing through the cities of Daytona Beach, DeLand, and New Smyrna Beach. Thereafter, he went back to Gainesville and walked south on Route 441 to Ocala.|$|R
5000|$|A stone-built low-built station {{building}} was provided on the Up platform, {{with a large}} station house similar in style to the building at [...] set back behind it. Between {{the rear of the}} Up platform and the station house was a single siding which served a small goods yard until after the First World War; <b>another</b> <b>siding</b> <b>to</b> the west of the line served the Wildon Ironworks from 1885 to 1941. Also to the west was a small goods shed and road bridge. A third siding was situated 400 yd to the east which led to a wharf on the Monmouth and Brecon Canal until 1953. No. 1 signal box was opened in 1911 near the canal wharf and lasted until [...] No. 2 box was erected at the east end of the Down platform in 1877; it controlled the road crossing to the east of the station.|$|R

50|$|The {{team has}} {{its origins in}} the {{establishment}} in 1908 of FC Minerva and FC Rhenania. Minerva soon merged with <b>another</b> local <b>side</b> <b>to</b> become FC Colombia.

Unable to establish himself in the new set-up, Mountford joined Fourth Division strugglers Scunthorpe United on a one-month loan in October 1974. That December he joined Crewe Alexandra, <b>another</b> <b>side</b> failing <b>to</b> find the net.
