50|$|In agroecosystems, {{fertilizer}} application has increased microbial nitrification (aerobic {{process in which}} microorganisms oxidize ammonium NH4+ to nitrate NO3-) and denitrification (anaerobic process in which microorganisms reduce NO3− to atmospheric nitrogen gas N2). Both processes naturally leak nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) to the atmosphere. Of particular concern is N2O, which has an average atmospheric lifetime of 114-120 years, and is 300 times more effective than CO2 as a greenhouse gas. NOx produced by industrial processes, automobiles and agricultural fertilization and NH3 emitted from soils (i.e., as an additional byproduct of nitrification) and livestock operations are transported to downwind ecosystems, influencing N cycling and nutrient losses. Six major effects of NOx and NH3 emissions have been cited: 1) decreased <b>atmospheric</b> <b>visibility</b> due to ammonium aerosols (fine particulate matter PM); 2) elevated ozone concentrations; 3) ozone and PM affects human health (e.g. respiratory diseases, cancer); 4) increases in radiative forcing and global climate change; 5) decreased agricultural productivity due to ozone deposition; and 6) ecosystem acidification and eutrophication.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] During a {{study of}} marine aerosol {{characteristics}} ata coastal site on South Uist in the Outer Hebrides, early in August 1986, an extended period with untypically low wind speeds (below 7 m s- 1) was experienced. Over this period, lasting several days, very low particle concentrations were measured for all observed particle radii from 0. 09 to 23. 5 /~m, and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>visibilities</b> of up to 80 km were noted. Particles larger than about 0. 2 #m in radius howed a decline in concentration throughout this episode, suggesting that these data could yield information on particle loss rates, {{as well as providing}} a true very low wind speed background aerosol distribution for this region of the North Atlantic. Analysis of these data indicates that the decay of aerosol concentration, for all particle radii greater than 0. 25 gm, may be approximated by an exponential function, and is consistent with a simple model of turbulent dry deposition of the aerosol to the ocean surface.

This study analyzed the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>visibility</b> data measured in urban and suburban Hong Kong (two selected stations) with respect to time-matched mass concentrations of common air pollutants including nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), nitrogen monoxide (NO), respirable suspended particulates (PM 10), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), carbon monoxide (CO), and meteorological parameters including air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed. No significant difference in <b>atmospheric</b> <b>visibility</b> was reported between the two measurement locations (p≥ 0. 6, t test); and good <b>atmospheric</b> <b>visibility</b> was observed more frequently in summer and autumn than in winter and spring (p< 0. 01, t test). It was also found that <b>atmospheric</b> <b>visibility</b> increased with temperature but decreased with the concentrations of SO 2, CO, PM 10, NO, and NO 2. The results showed that <b>atmospheric</b> <b>visibility</b> was season dependent and would have significant correlations with temperature, the mass concentrations of PM 10 and NO 2, and the air pollution index API (correlation coefficients |Râ|≥ 0. 7, p≥ 0. 0001, t test).

The camera acquires photos of the landscape that include natural dark objects.

40|$|<b>Atmospheric</b> <b>visibility</b> {{distance}} is a {{property of the}} atmosphere, which can be remotely sensed by computer vision. In this aim, a non-linear mapping function between the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>visibility</b> distance and the contrast in images must be estimated. The function depends on the scene depth distribution {{as well as on}} the radiometry of the scene. In order to calibrate and deploy such camera-based <b>atmospheric</b> <b>visibility</b> estimations, we present two methods which aim at computing the scene depth distribution and the radiometry of the scene beforehand. The scene depth is recovered by registering a full 3 D model of the environment in the frame of the camera. The radiometry of the scene is partly recovered by looking at the temporal correlation between the variation of pixels intensity and the variation of the sky luminance estimated by a luminance meter oriented toward the North direction. Based on clear-sky models, it is demonstrated that such a process detects a set of pixels, which include pixels belonging to North-oriented Lambertian surfaces. This finding leads to a simplified way of detecting Lambertian surfaces without any additional luminance meter.

40|$|Abstract. Estimating the <b>atmospheric</b> or {{meteorological}} <b>visibility</b> {{distance is}} very important for air and ground transport safety, as well as for air quality. However, there is no holistic approach to tackle the problem by camera. Most existing methods are data-driven approaches which perform a linear regression between the contrast in the scene and the visual range estimated by means of reference additional sensors. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model-based approach which takes into account the distribution of contrasts in the scene. It is robust to illumination variations in the scene by taking into account the Lambertian surfaces. To evaluate our model, meteorological ground truth data were collected, showing very promising results. This works opens new perspectives in the computer vision community dealing with environmental issues. ...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, the {{traditional}} indirect infrared radiation measurement model is improved, {{which is more}} suitable for remote dynamic target radiation measurement. In order to verify {{the accuracy of the}} model, a set of physical test system was established, and the model was validated by ground test. From the experimental results, the calibration model based on image grayscale has high accuracy in infrared radiation measurement, and its quantitative measurement accuracy is improved by about 50 %. Due to the limited conditions, the ground verification method is adopted in this test, and only the infrared radiation measurement of a single-direction target is verified in space. For the target selection, aircraft, missiles, and other quick maneuvering targets are not adopted, but the targets with slow movement are adopted. In the following research, it is necessary to improve these experiments and adopt more direct physical objects for measurement verification and model modification. At the same time, it is very necessary to analyze the environmental conditions in the follow-up study. The influence of atmospheric environment on radiation accuracy is very large, and the measurement accuracy of different <b>atmospheric</b> permeability, <b>visibility,</b> temperature, humidity, and other environments changes greatly. A more accurate measurement model can be obtained by fitting the refined experimental values under the above atmospheric conditions.|$|R

We find that when fast-switching is taken into account, for fully three-dimensional turbulence, and r. m. s. path length fluctuations of order 75 µm, the optimal smoothing timescale is 11 seconds. This timescale decreases to around 3 seconds as the thickness of the turbulence layer becomes small compared with the baseline length. These values are found to decrease as the r. m. s. fluctuations increase. A multiplicative factor is required to modify the w. v. r. correction term for fluctuations less than ∼ 50 µm, where the noise in the radiometer becomes comparable to fluctuations at the site. ...|$|R
