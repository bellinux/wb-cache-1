Ah Jiang even tells Fang Wei, who wants to pursue Xia Tian, that “If you want to pursue her, then go ahead. No {{one is going to}} stop you.” On the other hand, the sulking Xia Tian hears Xiao Han saying that she has decided to confess her feelings to Ah Jiang and also asks Xia Tian for her help. Xia Tian has mixed feelings in her heart and doesn’t know how she is supposed to respond. In order to investigate Officer Xia’s missing gun, everyone arrives at the Sunny Haunted House for the first time, but they did not find any clues. Because Xia Tian is still mad at Ah Jiang, she decides to stay at the Sunny Haunted House by herself to look for clues. Unexpectedly, the sound of a gunshot suddenly rings out through the Sunny Haunted House. Aside from Xia Tian’s astonishment, everyone finds a suspicious clue within the Sunny Haunted House - a muddy footprint on the floor and within the thick patch of grass lies an empty bullet shell. But does the footprint really belong to the person who opened fire? <b>And</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> relation between the empty bullet shell at the scene and Officer Xia’s missing gun? These clues are testing these 4 youngsters who have made a deal with the principal to stay in school and search for Officer Xia’s missing gun.|$|E
