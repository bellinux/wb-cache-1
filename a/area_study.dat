5|$|The Milford <b>area</b> <b>study</b> {{has been}} dormant since July 2007 due to {{community}} opposition to DelDOT's proposed alternatives through Lincoln and Milford. After studying various options that included upgrading the current alignment and constructing bypass routes {{to the west}} and east of Milford, DelDOT decided to move forward with a pair of eastern bypass alternatives in June 2007. Both alternatives head east from US113's current alignment southwest of Lincoln, bypass the village to the south and east, have an interchange with DE 30 and Johnson Road, and meet DE1 at an interchange south of the latter highway's interchange with the south end of DE1Business. On June 15, 2007, DelDOT announced it would move forward with plans to build the bypass despite the majority of the department's advisory group of community representatives opposing the bypass, far below the required 75percent for consensus to have been achieved. On July 1, 2007, in response to DelDOT overriding its advisory group, the Delaware General Assembly passed Senate Bill 155, which prohibited DelDOT from proceeding with the US113 North/South Improvements Project in the Milford and Lincoln areas and directed DelDOT to continue to work to achieve consensus on an acceptable bypass route. Citing a lack of community consensus, DelDOT abandoned its plans for the US113 bypass of Milford in January 2008.|$|E

40|$|<b>Area</b> <b>studies</b> {{developed}} in the crucible of the Cold War. Yet when globalization became the context of contemporary history, <b>area</b> <b>studies</b> responded inadequately to the challenge. Unlike world history, which transformed into global history, <b>area</b> <b>studies</b> did not adapt sufficiently to the new global environment of weakened and deconstructed geopolitical and academic borders. Vital supporters like the Ford Foundation failed to reconfigure <b>area</b> <b>studies</b> for the Global Age. Hence, this essay argues for a strategic defragmentation of <b>area</b> <b>studies</b> into comparative studies of global problems in local contexts and vice versa (global/local studies). Following the proposition that <b>area</b> <b>studies</b> without global studies are blind and global <b>studies</b> without <b>area</b> <b>studies</b> are empty, the article identifies and reviews the contributions since Open the Social Sciences (Wallerstein et al. 1996) that can leverage the field’s progressive interdisciplinary structure and lead it toward the advanced transdisciplinary enterprise of global/local studies...|$|R
40|$|The present {{conference is}} without {{question}} a typical exam-ple of <b>area</b> <b>studies.</b> Major academic institutions, founda-tions, and research centres {{in the world}} are labelled by the <b>areas</b> they <b>study.</b> <b>Area</b> <b>studies</b> thus have great institutional value. Not only that, <b>area</b> <b>studies</b> seem to have gained a status on par with traditionally defined disciplinary fields, like soci-ology, history, or linguistics. Defining <b>area</b> <b>studies</b> In anthropology the idea of <b>area</b> <b>studies</b> goes back to the idea of cultural areas or Kulturkreis popularized by German anthro-pologists like Frobenius, Ratzel, Shurz and Graebner. Amer-ican anthropologists like Wissler and Kroeber (Kroeber 1947) applied the concept to North America and subdivided it accord-ing to ecological zones matching cultural and social traits. Attempts were made to delineate similar zones in Asia (see Rambo 2004) ...|$|R

40|$|The essay {{traces the}} origins and {{development}} of Soviet <b>area</b> <b>studies</b> from their inception in the early 1940 s to the present. The first part examines the institutional framework and the funding sources for Soviet and post-Soviet <b>area</b> <b>studies.</b> The second part concentrates on the connection between <b>area</b> <b>studies</b> and the disciplines. Next, the authors consider intellectual trends and map the major changes {{that have taken place}} in the conceptualization of Soviet <b>area</b> <b>studies</b> from the Second World War to the collapse of the USSR. The final section provides an overview of the formation of post-Soviet <b>area</b> <b>studies.</b> The focus of the inquiry is Soviet and post-Soviet <b>area</b> <b>studies</b> in the United States. The paper argues that the institutional context {{for the study of the}} region has not changed dramatically since the collapse of communism (despite some changes in nomenclature and the inclusion of "Eurasian" studies). By contrast, the intellectual agenda in both Soviet and post-Soviet studies and the disciplinary distribution of specialists have undergone significant modifications during the past decade...|$|R
50|$|Since their inception, <b>area</b> <b>studies</b> {{have been}} subject to critiques—including by area specialists themselves. Many of them alleged that because <b>area</b> <b>studies</b> were {{connected}} to the Cold War agendas of the CIA, the FBI, and other intelligence and military agencies, participating in such programs was tantamount to serving as an agent of the state. Some argue, that there is the notion that U.S concerns and research priorities will define the intellectual terrain of <b>area</b> <b>studies.</b> Others insisted, however, that once they were established on university campuses, <b>area</b> <b>studies</b> began to encompass a much broader and deeper intellectual agenda than the one foreseen by government agencies, thus not American centric.|$|R

The question of what constitutes am ‘area’ or a ‘region’ is a timely and contested one. Moreover, epistemic borderlines have been constructed by a hegemonic way of identifying academic disciplines. The separation between <b>area</b> <b>studies</b> and disciplines, too, is a decision based on global epistemic power relations. The following paragraphs address the constructivist dimension of <b>area</b> <b>studies</b> and disciplines.
