50|$|Processor {{registers}} {{are typically}} divided into several groups: integer, floating-point, single instruction, multiple data (SIMD), control, and often special registers for address arithmetic {{which may have}} various uses and names such as <b>address,</b> <b>index,</b> or base registers. However, in modern designs, these functions are often performed by more general purpose integer registers. In most processors, only integer or address-registers {{can be used to}} address data in memory; the other types of registers cannot. The size of these registers therefore normally limits the amount of directly addressable memory, even if there are registers, such as floating-point registers, that are wider.|$|E

Some processors provide one or more instructions which take an immediate value, sometimes referred to as [...] "immediate" [...] for short. An immediate value is stored as part of the instruction which employs it, usually to load into, add to, or subtract from, a register. The other parts of the instruction are the opcode, and destination. The latter may be implicit. (A non-immediate value may reside in a register, or be stored elsewhere in memory, requiring the instruction to contain a direct or indirect <b>address</b> <b>index</b> register address to the value.) ...|$|E

Recently, many have attempted to add value to routing protocols by improving efficiency and security of these protocols. In this paper, we show that a whole class of routing protocols for dynamic networks is vulnerable to a subtle attack.

30|$|The {{proposed}} prediction scheme {{reflects the}} spatial locality of data. In other words, {{a sequence of}} related data (spatial locality) tends to be located and accessed in the same bank (way). As we described earlier, the bank information for the prediction is updated via memory <b>address</b> (<b>index</b> part) and global history. To reduce the power consumption in the DAWP cache, it is desired to reduce conflicts in the index table and the fully associative cache. In fact in our design, the highly biased accesses are filtered using the global history, and the hit time is reduced since the system accesses only one bank instead of accessing full n-way banks on prediction hits.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — A {{small set}} of {{molecular}} building blocks {{will allow the}} implementation of “universally programmable intelligent matter,” that is, matter whose structure, properties, and behavior can be programmed, quite literally, at the molecular level. The approach is based on combinatory logic, a term-rewriting or graphsubstitution system, which {{can be interpreted as}} an abstract model of molecular processes. In such systems there are small sets of substitution operations (reactions) that are universal {{in the sense that they}} can be used to program any Turing-computable function.

Regression test selection techniques reuse tests from an existing test suite to test a modified program. Many regression test selection techniques have been proposed; however, {{it is difficult to}} compare and evaluate these techniques because they have different goals. This paper outlines the issues relevant to regression test selection techniques, and uses these issues as the basis for a framework within which to evaluate the techniques. We illustrate the application of our framework by using it to evaluate existing regression test selection techniques. The evaluation reveals {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} existing techniques, and highlights some problems that future work in this area should <b>address.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms-Software maintenance, regression testing, selective retest, regression test selection. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Internet {{services}} {{can be accessed}} privately through anonymizing networks like Tor. A set of routers are used to achieve this in order to hide the identity of client from server. The users of such networks often indulge into malicious activities and cause damage to popular web applications. The administrators of those web sites do block the IP address from which the request comes. This is not the practical solution as the hackers operate through anonymous networks. Blocking a node based on IP address will cau se misbehaving and genuine users to lost access to the web sites. This is {{the problem in the}} existing systems and motivation to take up this research work. The proposed system develops a security mechanism that ensures that only the misbehaving users are blackl isted while genuine users and their anonymity are preserved. Even though the misbehaving users are blacklisted, their privacy is still maintained.

40|$|Abstract – How to {{represent}} and plan {{movement in the}} face of the articulatory redundancy of the skeletal system is a central challenge for understanding how physical actions are organized. By emphasizing the role of the goal posture as a representational primitive of the skeletal system, the posture-based model of movement planning provides one means for translating a simple specification of task constraints, such as moving from a starting posture to touch a target, into a movement trajectory. It also provides a description of how such actions may be learned. The model has been shown to plan realistic movement trajectories for reaching, grasping, handwriting, circumventing obstacles, and using tools in 2 -D workspaces, in all of which arm motion has been restricted to either a sagittal or horizontal plane. Recent work extends the model to the planning of movements in a 3 -D workspace. The model’s manipulation of a tool around obstacles closely resembles the trajectories generated by participants. This newer work enlarges the domain of prospective motor control (action planning and learning) that the model can <b>address.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms – Motor control, motor learning, modeling, tra...|$|E

Criminogenic need such as anger or inappropriate sexual interest is considered to be crucial in the commission of the offence.

Method This study reviews the treatment for 197 offenders with intellectual disability accepted into a range of services. Participants' case files were examined to ascertain the extent to which need was addressed through recognised therapies.
