5|$|WASP-15b has {{a mass of}} 0.542 times Jupiter's {{mass and}} a radius that is 1.428 times Jupiter's radius. Due in part to its {{proximity}} to its host star, a distance of 0.0499 AU (7,500,000km), WASP-15b is greatly inflated, with a density of 0.247 g/cm3. Another factor, such as an internal heat source, is suspected to <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> extremely high radius and extremely low density. WASP-15b orbits its host star every 3.7520656 days. It also has an orbital inclination of 85.5º, making it almost edge-on {{as seen from the}} Earth's perspective.|$|E
5|$|Studies of {{the water}} quality of the lake in 1983–84 {{indicate}} a decline in quality since the 1965–66 analysis. Scientific research over the years also reveal that Telbal, Botkal, and sewage drains are responsible for a substantial influx of nitrogen and phosphorus into the lake. Quantitatively, fifteen drains and several other sources have released a total of 156.62 tonnes (56.36 tonnes by drains alone) of phosphorus, and 241.18 tonnes of inorganic nitrogen into the lake from a discharge of 11.701 million cubic metres /year. Non-point sources, such as seepage and diffused runoff, also <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> pollution and have been recorded as further adding 4.5 tonnes of total phosphates and 18.14 tonnes of nitrogen (NO3–N and NH4–N) to the lake. Based on the values mentioned above, it has been inferred that the water quality of the lake has deteriorated.|$|E
5|$|COPD {{develops}} as {{a significant}} and chronic inflammatory response to inhaled irritants. Chronic bacterial infections may also <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> inflammatory state. The inflammatory cells involved include neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages, two types of white blood cell. Those who smoke additionally have Tc1 lymphocyte involvement and some people with COPD have eosinophil involvement {{similar to that in}} asthma. Part of this cell response is brought on by inflammatory mediators such as chemotactic factors. Other processes involved with lung damage include oxidative stress produced by high concentrations of free radicals in tobacco smoke and released by inflammatory cells, and breakdown of the connective tissue of the lungs by proteases that are insufficiently inhibited by protease inhibitors. The destruction of the connective tissue of the lungs is what leads to emphysema, which then contributes to the poor airflow and, finally, poor absorption and release of respiratory gases. General muscle wasting that often occurs in COPD may be partly due to inflammatory mediators released by the lungs into the blood.|$|E

25|$|Surrealism helped Carpentier to see {{contexts}} and aspects, {{especially those of}} American life, {{which he did not}} see before and after working among the leading artistic figures for some time, Carpentier did not feel overly enthusiastic about his work within surrealism and had felt that his “surrealist attempts ha been in vain” describing his frustration, as he felt he had “nothing to <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> movement in France".|$|E
25|$|Vitamin C {{chemically}} decomposes {{under certain}} conditions, {{many of which}} may occur during the cooking of food. Vitamin C concentrations in various food substances decrease with time {{in proportion to the}} temperature at which they are stored and cooking can reduce the Vitamin C content of vegetables by around 60% possibly partly due to increased enzymatic destruction as it may be more significant at sub-boiling temperatures. Longer cooking times also <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> effect, as will copper food vessels, which catalyse the decomposition.|$|E
25|$|Another view of {{negotiation}} comprises four elements: strategy, process, tools, and tactics. Strategy comprises {{the top level}} goals – typically including relationship and the final outcome. Processes and tools include the steps to follow and roles to take in preparing for and negotiating with the other parties. Tactics include more detailed statements and actions and responses to others' statements and actions. Some <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> persuasion and influence, asserting that these have become integral to modern day negotiation success, and so should not be omitted.|$|E

25|$|One might <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> {{list the}} translation, in Alfred's law code, of {{excerpts}} from the Vulgate Book of Exodus. The Old English versions of Orosius's Histories against the Pagans and Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People are no longer accepted by scholars as Alfred's own translations because of lexical and stylistic differences. Nonetheless the consensus remains that {{they were part of}} the Alfredian programme of translation. Simon Keynes and Michael Lapidge suggest this also for Bald's Leechbook and the anonymous Old English Martyrology.|$|E
25|$|Once in Portugal the British regiments at {{once were}} put into action but {{in the first few}} months of deployment, {{difficulties}} arose from the opposition of many Portuguese officers. To <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>this,</b> the Portuguese treated the British with contempt, not the least because of their protestant religion. Despite this the Portuguese soon recognised that the British were the more reliable component in the army and made a more serious impression on the Spanish than other troops in the Portuguese Army. The brigade, however, suffered with sickness, which accounted for many losses, and battle casualties were rarely ever replaced from home.|$|E
25|$|Normally, {{the extra}} payment of the premium would be {{compensated}} for by the profits {{to be made by}} selling the first of the new crop of tea. In 1866 there was a problem - the first cargo of tea had arrived over two weeks earlier in the steam auxiliary ship Erl King, a ship that was not considered part of the race. The tea merchants were committed to a payment when their tea would sell at a loss. To <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>this,</b> the first two tea clippers had signalled off Deal early on the morning of 6 September, followed by a third (Serica) at 1:00 pm. These three ships would create a glut of new season tea, so prices were bound to fall further.|$|E

25|$|<b>Add</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> {{the various}} forms of utility cycling in the city and {{specialized}} consultancy services, provided both partly by the public sector though the city itself and the cycling embassy to promote private sector solutions internationally, but also directly by private sector consultants, most notably Copenhagenize Consulting and Gehl Architects. The tourism sector is also regarded to both receive and provide additional economic benefits to the city. There are many bicycle rental shops which mainly cater to visitors and there are also a number of agencies providing bicycle tours of Copenhagen, creating additional jobs and economic activity. In addition, the positive branding effect of Copenhagen's bicycle culture is estimated to attract international conferences and hotel guests, although the city finds it difficult to assign a precise economic value to the positive branding of Copenhagen as a cycling city.|$|E
25|$|In 1840, Cavendish-Bentinck was {{commissioned}} into the Grenadier Guards, but retired in 1841 {{after only a}} year. He joined the MCC to play against Oxford University on 11 June 1840 – his debut first-class match. Oxford, despite playing at home, fell to a heavy defeat as the MCC won by seven wickets. Cavendish-Bentinck made 11. His one appearance for Cambridge came in a match against the MCC, on 1 July 1841. Apart from various appearances for the MCC against school sides, Cavendish-Bentinck would play eight other first-class games for the MCC, scoring fifty-three runs in total, including a best of 29 not out. <b>Add</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> one match between two invitational teams – a Slow Bowlers XI featuring Bentinck versus a Fast Bowlers XI – and Cavendish-Bentinck played eleven games in total, scoring 66 runs at a low batting average of 5.50.|$|E
25|$|I {{am happy}} {{to be able to}} inform you that we have now in the United States a negro, the son of a black man born in Africa, and of a black woman born in the United States, who is a very respectable mathematician.

I have seen very elegant solutions of Geometrical problems by him. <b>Add</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> that he is a very worthy & respectable member of society. He is a free man.
