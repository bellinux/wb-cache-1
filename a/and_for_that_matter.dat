50|$|Building on {{his basic}} {{understanding}} of philosophy as critical reflection on human experience (to form a rational theory of the world), Kaipayil argues that ontology, the theory of being, (<b>and</b> metaphysics <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>matter)</b> should be “critical,” meaning {{that it should be}} based on empirical experience. Any ontological and metaphysical postulations we make can claim epistemic justification, only if they are grounded in our experience of the world. In this regard, he agrees with the Kantian critique of human knowledge, without, however, endorsing its agnosticism about metaphysics. Kaipayil further describes ontology as investigation of the being-principle of things.|$|R

25|$|While Skene's {{notion of}} an {{exclusively}} Q-Celtic Pictish language has long been rejected, the Picts were under increasing political, social and linguistic pressure from Dál Riata from around the 5th century. The Picts were steadily Gaelicised through the latter centuries of the Pictish Kingdom, {{and by the time}} of the merging of the Pictish and Dál Riatan kingdoms, the Picts were essentially a Gaelic-speaking people. Forsyth speculates that a period of bilingualism may have outlasted the Pictish kingdom in peripheral areas by several generations. Scottish Gaelic, unlike Irish (<b>and,</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>matter,</b> Old Irish) maintains a substantial corpus of Brittonic loan-words and, moreover, uses a verbal system modelled on the same pattern as Welsh.|$|E

25|$|Offering {{the throne}} to Prince Prajadhipok {{was not without}} a debate. In doing so, another {{candidate}} was bypassed: Prince Chula Chakrabongse, son of the late Field Marshal Prince Chakrabongse Bhuvanath of Phitsanulok, who before his death had been the heir-apparent to King Vajiravudh. It was questioned whether the Succession Law enacted by King Vajiravudh actually barred Prince Chakrabongse Bhuvanath (<b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>matter,</b> Prince Chula Chakrabongse) from succession {{on the grounds that}} he married a foreigner (Russian). However, his marriage had taken place before this law was enacted and had been endorsed by King Chulalongkorn himself.

500|$|Following James Brady's {{death on}} August 4, 2014, the District of Columbia Medical Examiner ruled the death a {{homicide}} stemming from wounds {{caused by the}} Hinckley assassination attempt. This ruling raised the possibility that Hinckley could face additional future murder charges. However, prosecutors declined {{to do so for}} two reasons. First, a jury had already declared Hinckley insane {{at the time of the}} shooting and the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy would preclude overturning this ruling on account of Brady's death. Second, in 1981 Washington, D.C. still had the common law [...] "year and a day" [...] rule in place. Although the year and a day rule had been abolished in the district prior to 2014, the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto law would preclude the upgrading of charges for deaths resulting today from acts committed while the rule was in effect (<b>and,</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>matter,</b> would also prohibit the government from challenging Hinkley's successful insanity defense based on the current federal law).|$|E

[...] Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote that the film [...] "has been very well worked out on all levels, and manages the difficult feat of being an intimate, even delicate tale played with an appealingly light touch against an epic backdrop." [...] The film did receive notable pans from several major reviewers. Anthony Lane of The New Yorker called the film [...] "Warm, wise, and wearisome as hell."

50|$|FDFD, <b>and</b> FDTD <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>matter,</b> {{does not}} lend itself well to complex {{geometries}} or multiscale structures, as the Yee grid is restricted mostly to rectangular structures. This can be circumvented by either using a very fine grid mesh (which increases computational cost), or by approximating the effects with surface boundary conditions. Non uniform gridding can lead to spurious charges at the interface boundary, as the zero divergence conditions are not maintained when the grid is not uniform along an interface boundary. E and H field continuity can be maintained to circumvent this problem by enforcing weak continuity across the interface using basis functions, as is done in FEM. Perfectly matched layer (PML) boundary conditions {{can also be used}} to truncate the grid, and avoid meshing empty space.|$|R

500|$|Pinter's last stage play, Celebration (2000), is {{a social}} satire set in an opulent restaurant, which lampoons The Ivy, a fashionable venue in London's West End theatre district, and its patrons who [...] "have just come from {{performances}} of either the ballet or the opera. Not that they can remember a darn thing about what they saw, including the titles. [...] gilded, foul-mouthed souls are just as myopic {{when it comes to}} their own table mates (<b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>matter,</b> their food), with conversations that usually connect only on the surface, if there." [...] On its surface the play may appear to have fewer overtly political resonances than some of the plays from the 1980s and 1990s; but its central male characters, brothers named Lambert and Matt, are members of the elite (like the men in charge in Party Time), who describe themselves as [...] "peaceful strategy consultants [...] we don't carry guns." [...] At the next table, Russell, a banker, describes himself as a [...] "totally disordered personality... a psychopath," [...] while Lambert [...] "vows to be reincarnated as ' more civilised, [...] gentler person, [...] nicer person'." [...] These characters' deceptively smooth exteriors mask their extreme viciousness. [...] Celebration evokes familiar Pinteresque political contexts: [...] "The ritzy loudmouths in 'Celebration'... and the quieter working-class mumblers of 'The Room'... have everything in common beneath the surface". [...] "Money remains in the service of entrenched power, and the brothers in the play are 'strategy consultants' whose jobs involve force and violence... It is tempting but inaccurate to equate the comic power inversions of the social behavior in Celebration with lasting change in larger political structures", according to Grimes, for whom the play indicates Pinter's pessimism about the possibility of changing the status quo. [...] Yet, as the Waiter's often comically unbelievable reminiscences about his grandfather demonstrate in Celebration, Pinter's final stage plays also extend some expressionistic aspects of his earlier [...] "memory plays", while harking back to his [...] "comedies of menace", as illustrated in the characters and in the Waiter's final speech: ...|$|E

Federal legisla- tion preempting state law of professional conduct is conceivable but hardly likely, particularly as the norms are pressed into duty for pur- poses other than professional discipline.

The paper is also an attempt to diagnose the difficulties encountered by Polish organs which are responsible for proper monitoring of the spending of Community funds.

2500|$|There {{have been}} {{suggestions}} that Gandhi {{had an opportunity}} to stop Singh's execution but refrained from doing so. Another theory is that Gandhi actively conspired with the British to have Singh executed. In contrast, Gandhi's supporters argue {{that he did not have}} enough influence with the British to stop the execution, much less arrange it, but claim that he did his best to save Singh's life. They also assert that Singh's role in the independence movement was no threat to Gandhi's role as its leader, so he would have no reason to want him dead. Gandhi always maintained that he was a great admirer of Singh's patriotism. He also stated that he was opposed to Singh's execution (<b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>matter,</b> capital punishment in general) and proclaimed that he had no power to stop it. Of Singh's execution Gandhi said: [...] "The government certainly had the right to hang these men. However, there are some rights which do credit to those who possess them only if they are enjoyed in name only." [...] Gandhi also once remarked about capital punishment: [...] "I cannot in all conscience agree to anyone being sent to the gallows. God alone can take life, because he alone gives it." [...] Gandhi had managed to have 90,000 political prisoners, who were not members of his Satyagraha movement, released under the Gandhi-Irwin Pact. According to a report in the Indian magazine Frontline, he did plead several times for the commutation of the death sentences of Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev, including a personal visit on 19 March 1931.

30|$|This {{study has}} found that Romanian sheep farmers are still practising long-distance {{transhumance}} {{because they believe that}} it is beneficial to their animals, the environment and their produce.

The PASTORAL project suggests links between pastoralism and tourism as well as environmental conservation and the preservation of ‘public goods’ (PASTORAL 2000 – 2003).

This commentary essay argues that ‘the Pivot’ was already out of date when it was announced, and that it is neither clear nor robust enough to guide US policy through the difficult strategic tides that will characterise the next decade or so. As such, it is more hope than plan. ‘The Pivot’ views the region through the lens of US strategic primacy—a primacy that is increasingly challenged by China, <b>and</b> Russia <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>matter.</b> The much-vaunted ‘international rules based order’ is an artefact of the immediate post World War Two dispensation, and unless US policy is able to accept that China, and Russia, expect to have a place at the rules-setting table, ‘the Pivot’ has little chance of success...|$|R
