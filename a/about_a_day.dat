5|$|At metamorphosis, {{rapid changes}} in the body take place as the {{lifestyle}} of the frog changes completely. The spiral‐shaped mouth with horny tooth ridges is reabsorbed together with the spiral gut. The animal develops a large jaw, and its gills disappear along with its gill sac. Eyes and legs grow quickly, and a tongue is formed. There are associated {{changes in the}} neural networks such as development of stereoscopic vision and loss of the lateral line system. All this can happen in <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> A few days later, the tail is reabsorbed, due to the higher thyroxine concentration required for this to take place.|$|E

5|$|After the storm, {{officials}} in Réunion declared a disaster {{area for the}} island. The government started an emergency relief fund to provide assistance to the affected families. The European Economic Community donated ₣1.42million francs ($222,000 1989USD) due to the storm. Residents on the island assisted each other by providing lodging and donating clothing. France sent 15,000ration kits, 1,500beds and blankets, and 20cisterns to the island {{in the aftermath of}} Firinga. In addition, 400troops and 50vehicles were dispatched from an insular military base in order to assist the affected populations. Within two days, crews in Réunion restored water access to about 20,000people. Conditions returned to normal in northern Réunion within <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> In the southern portion, however, it took up to four weeks for life to return to normal. The significant amount of flooding damaged the coral reef system due to excessive runoff. Due to dead animals being washed into the ocean, diving at the reefs was banned for several weeks.

5|$|Hours before Isabel made {{landfall}} on North Carolina, the National Hurricane Center {{issued a}} tropical storm warning {{for a portion of}} the southern Long Island coastline from the New Jersey/New York border to Moriches. <b>About</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> before the hurricane moved ashore, forecasters estimated the hurricane possessed a 10% chance of passing within 75miles (120km) of New York City. Other portions of southern New England were estimated to have similar probabilities, with the same forecast predicting a 3% chance for it passing within 75miles (120km) of Eastport, Maine. By about two days before Isabel struck land until several hours after it moved ashore, forecasters predicted the storm to pass over western New York as a transitioning tropical cyclone before passing into Canada as an extratropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Ignacio {{continued}} to quickly intensify after becoming a hurricane, and reached peak winds of 105mph (165km/h) later on August 24 while located within 30miles (48km/h) {{off the coast}} of Baja California Sur. Upon reaching peak strength, the hurricane possessed a 12mile (19km) wide eye surrounded by very deep convection. The National Hurricane Center predicted it to attain major hurricane status and potentially reach significantly higher winds if the center remained over open water. However, it turned to the northwest and paralleled the Baja California Peninsula a short distance offshore, resulting in a steady weakening trend due to its interaction with the high terrain. On August 25 Ignacio made landfall just east of La Paz with winds of 80mph (130km/h). It rapidly weakened over land, first deteriorating to a tropical storm 12hours after landfall and later to a tropical depression <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> after moving ashore. Ignacio continued northwestward across the peninsula, and dissipated on August 28 while located in northwestern Baja California Sur.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{telephone}} service onto {{the island was}} disrupted, and the only method of outside contact was by radio to the University of Guam. The Guam Memorial Hospital dropped a package of medical supplies to Yap, although planes containing aid flying onto the island were disrupted by the damaged runway. <b>About</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> after Sudal's passage, the runway was cleared and repaired, which allowed a United States Coast Guard plane to provide relief supplies, including building materials. By April12, or {{three days after the}} typhoon, communication links to the island began to be restored. By four days later, the water treatment plant was repaired. One power station on the island was repaired, but since the strong winds damaged most of the power lines, about 85% of the population remained without electricity. Primary roadways were largely cleared, and all bridges were reopened.|$|E

5|$|The next storm formed well to {{the east}} of the Lesser Antilles on September 3 and moved westward, {{attaining}} tropical storm status <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> later. The storm slowed and curved toward the southwest, nearing the northern coast of Colombia before pulling away from land and strengthening into a hurricane. It further intensified to Category 2 status before striking Nicaragua on September 10. Quickly weakening to a tropical storm, the cyclone continued westward across Central America and briefly entered the eastern Pacific Ocean. It dissipated shortly thereafter. In the town of Corinto, a report indicated the deaths of 10 people and 50 additional injuries. About 250 houses were destroyed, leaving approximately $2 million (1911 USD, $ 2014 USD) in damage. Data on this storm is extremely scarce; as such, only minor revisions could be made to its chronology in the hurricane database.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{reaching}} peak strength, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predicted Hurricane Sergio {{to intensify}} further to reach winds of 120mph (195km/h). Shortly after peaking, the hurricane {{turned to the}} north and gradually weakened as wind shear from an upper-level trough to its northwest increased. By early on November 17, the low-cloud circulation became partially exposed {{on the west side of}} the deep convection, and it is estimated that Sergio weakened to a tropical storm later that day. A ridge to its north and northeast turned the storm to the northwest and later to the west as Sergio gradually weakened. Deep convection reformed near the center on November 18, resulting in a slight increase in winds, though vertical shear quickly weakened it again. Later that day, the storm made its closest approach to land, about 225miles (360km) southwest of Michoacán. Early on November 20 it degenerated into a tropical depression, and later that day Sergio dissipated about 360miles (580km) southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico, or about 320miles (515km) west-northwest of where it originally formed. The remnants of Sergio continued westward for <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> before the minimal amount of convection diminished.|$|E

5|$|According to Météo-France, Bonita {{began to}} weaken {{slightly}} by early on January 9, the eye becoming asymmetric and poorly defined. The ridge {{to the south}} prevented the storm from progressing to the south, and after passing about 270km (170mi) north of Réunion, Bonita shifted due west and later roughly west-by-north, apparently steered by a building mid-to-upper-level anticyclone south of Madagascar. It remained a strong tropical cyclone as it approached the eastern coast of Madagascar, making landfall near Mahavelona {{on the night of}} January 10 local time, or about 2130 UTC. At the time of landfall, a clear eye was visible on satellite imagery. It crossed the island nation over the course of <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> weakening significantly to a moderate tropical storm as it reemerged into the Mozambique Channel. Once over water, favorable conditions prompted quick reintensification of the cyclone, as it proceeded west-southwestward toward mainland Africa. At 1200 UTC on January 13, Bonita reattained severe tropical storm status, marking its secondary peak intensity with 10-minute winds of 95km/h (60mph). With an expansive circulation and a good structure, the cyclone made its second and final landfall over the Zambezia Province of Mozambique, between Quelimane and Pebane District, on the night of January 13 local time. Bonita meandered inland, weakening only gradually and nearly tracking back over open water.|$|E
5|$|In Florida, {{waves of}} over 10feet (3m) in height capsized a boat near Lantana; the two {{occupants}} were rescued without injury. Additionally, the waves displaced a sailboat {{that had previously}} been washed ashore in Juno Beach. Large waves flooded a parking lot and destroyed several fences and tree branches at Jupiter Beach, which resulted in its temporary closure; nearby a maintenance shed was destroyed. Eight leatherback sea turtle nests in Boca Raton were destroyed after the surf reached the dunes. Due to high surf, the beach pier at Flagler Beach was closed for <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> Minor to moderate beach erosion caused the Florida Department of Transportation to fill in areas near the seawall with sand. One death occurred when a surfer drowned in the rough waves off the coast at New Smyrna Beach in Volusia County. Outer rainbands produced light rainfall, with the highest report in the Jacksonville National Weather Service area of responsibility totaling 0.77inches (20mm); the bands also caused tropical storm force wind gusts in the northeastern portion of the state.
