40|$|Background: <b>Arterial</b> <b>gasometry</b> is {{considered}} {{the gold standard for}} establishing a diagnosis of respiratory failure of any etiology. However, there are some circumstances in which it loses specificity, making necessary to consider other tests such as pulse oximetry to adequately determine hypoxemia. We report a 67 years old patient with sudden hypoacusia, right hemiparesis and polypnea. His laboratory exams on admission, showed extreme hypoxemia in several readings, without correlation to the patient's clinical condition nor the pulse oximetry, and a leukocytosis of 800. 000 cells x ml, with many immature cells. Chronic myeloid leukemia was diagnosed and treatment with hydroxyurea was initiated, achieving normalization in the arterial gases in accordance with the fall of the white cell count.

40|$|Introduction: Experimental {{studies on}} {{pulmonary}} embolism (PE) are usually performed under mechanical ventilation. Most patients with suspicion of PE enter the Emergency Services in spontaneous breathing and environmental air. Thus, under these conditions, measurements of hemodynamic, gasometric and capnographic variables contribute largely {{to a more}} specific comprehension of cardiopulmonary and gasometric alterations in the acute phase of the disease. Studies which evaluated animals under conditions are lacking. Objective: This study aimed to submit animals under spontaneous ventilation and without supplemental oxygen to PE. Methods: PE was induced in six pigs using autologous blood clots, and cardiorespiratory and gasometric records were performed before and after PE. The values of "near fatal" mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP) were previously determined. Results: The presence of obstructive shock could be evidenced by increased MPAP (from 17. 8 ± 3. 5 to 41. 7 ± 3. 3 mmHg) (P< 0. 0001) and decreased cardiac output (from 4. 9 ± 1. 0 to 2. 7 ± 1. 0 L/min) (P< 0. 003). Consequently, metabolic acidosis occurred (Lac art) (from 2. 4 ± 0. 6 to 5. 7 ± 1. 8 mmol/L) (P< 0. 0001). It was observed hypoxemia (from 73. 5 ± 12. 7 to 40. 3 ± 4. 6 mmHg) (P< 0. 0001); however, PaCO 2 did not vary (from 44. 9 ± 4. 4 to 48. 2 ± 6. 0 mmHg) (NS). There were significant increases in both P(a-et) CO 2 (from 4. 8 ± 2. 8 to 37. 2 ± 5. 8 mmHg) and P(A-a) O 2 (from 8. 2 ± 8. 9 to 37. 2 ± 10. 3 mmHg) (both P< 0. 0001). There was also {{a significant increase in}} the total alveolar minute volume (from 4. 0 ± 0. 9 to 10. 6 ± 2. 9 L/min) (P< 0. 0001). Conclusion: In this model, the near fatal MPAP was from 2 to 2. 5 times the basal MPAP; and the capnographic variables, associated with <b>arterial</b> and venous <b>gasometry,</b> showed effective in discriminating an acute obstructive profile...|$|R

OBJETIVO: Avaliar ação protetora do alfa-tocoferol na lesão de isquemia e reperfusão em membro pélvico de ratos. MÉTODOS: Trinta ratos machos adultos da linhagem wistar foram distribuídos aleatoriamente, em três grupos experimentais, com 10 animais cada: Grupo I - Grupo controle sem isquemia ou reperfusão. Grupos II e III - quatro horas de isquemia e duas horas de reperfusão através clampeamento da aorta infra-renal. Os animais do grupo II foram tratados com solução salina e aqueles do grupo III, tratados com alfa-tocoferol 50 mg/kg por via endovenosa. Parâmetros estudados: Biópsias do músculo solear, dosagens da creatina fosfoquinase, da desidrogenasse láctica, do potássio, do cálcio e da hemogasometria arterial. RESULTADOS: Os resultados das biópsias dos músculos soleares estudados através da microscopia óptica, não foram significantes quanto a presença de edema entre os três grupos estudados. As variáveis inflamação e necrose não foram observadas e, portanto não analisáveis estatisticamente. Em relação às dosagens de cálcio e desidrogenase lática, pH, pO 2, pCO 2, não foram significantes em todos os grupos estudados. Observamos que os níveis de potássio (Grupo II > grupo I, F calculado = 5, 84; F crítico = 3, 33), creatina fosfoquinase (Grupo II > Grupo I e III, H calculado = 13, 92; Hcritico 5, 99), e bicarbonato (grupo I e III > grupo II, H calculado = 11, 98; h critico 5. 99) apresentaram resultados significantes entre os grupos.

The diversity of models does not allow complete reproducibility, so a standardized model is needed. In this study, we developed a rat model of neonatal anoxia that utilizes a semi-hermetic system suitable for oxygen deprivation. The validity of this model was confirmed using pulse oximetry, <b>arterial</b> <b>gasometry,</b> observation of skin color and behavior and analysis of Fos immunoreactivity in brain regions that function in respiratory control. For these experiments, 87 male albino neonate rats (Rattus norvegicus, lineage Wistar) aged approximate 30 postnatal hours were divided into anoxia and control groups. The pups were kept in an euthanasia polycarbonate chamber at 36 +/- 1 degrees C, with continuous 100 % nitrogen gas flow at 3 L/min and 101. 7 kPa for 25 min. The peripheral arterial oxygen saturation of the anoxia group decreased 75 % from its initial value. Decreased pH and partial pressure of oxygen and increased partial pressure of carbon dioxide were observed in this group, indicating metabolic acidosis, hypoxia and hypercapnia. respectively. Analysis of neuronal activation showed Fos immunoreactivity in the solitary tract nucleus, the lateral reticular nucleus and the area postrema, confirming that those conditions activated areas related to respiratory control in the nervous system. Therefore, the proposed model of neonatal anoxia allows standardization and precise control of the anoxic condition, which should be of great value in indentifying both the mechanisms underlying neonatal anoxia and novel therapeutic strategies to combat or prevent this widespread public health problem.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{metabolic}} {{changes in}} trauma patients with shock contribute {{directly to the}} survival of the patient. To understand these changes better, we made a rigorous analysis of the variations in the main examinations requested for seriously polytraumatized patients. Methods Prospective analysis of patients with blunt or penetrating trauma with hypovolemic shock, with systolic arterial pressure (SAP) equal to or lower than 90 mmHg at any time during initial treatment in the emergency room and aged between 14 and 60 years old. The following exams were analyzed: sodium, potassium, blood test, glycemia and <b>arterial</b> <b>gasometry.</b> The tests were carried out at intervals: T 0 (the first exam, collected on admission) and followed by T 24 (24 hours after admission), T 48 (48 hours after admission), T 72 (72 hours after admission). Results The test evaluations showed that there was a tendency towards hyperglycemia, which was more evident upon admission to hospital. The sodium in all the patients was found to be normal upon admission, with a later decline. However, no patient had significant hyponatremia; there was no significant variation in the potassium variable; the gasometry, low pH, BE (base excess) and bicarbonate levels when the first sample was collected and increased later with PO 2 and PCO 2 showing only slight variations, which meant an acidotic state during the hemorrhagic shock followed by a response from the organism to reestablish the equilibrium, retaining bicarbonate. The red blood count, shown by the GB (globular volume) and HB (hemoglobin) was normal upon entry but later it dropped steadily until it fell below normal; the white blood count (leukocytes, neutrophils and band neutrophil) remained high from the first moment of evaluation. Conclusion In this study we demonstrated the main alterations that took place in patients with serious trauma, emphasizing that even commonly requested laboratory tests can help to estimate metabolic alterations. Suitable treatment for polytraumatized patients with hypovolemic shock is a challenge for the surgeon, who must be alert to endocrinal and metabolic changes in his patients. Based on these alterations, the surgeon can intervene earlier and make every effort to achieve a successful clinical result. </p...|$|E

CONCLUSÕES: Os mecanismos de infarto hepático e esplênico neste caso não foram bem elucidados. Alguns fatores devem ter contribuído, tais como: desidratação e hipotensão devido a episódios de vômitos e febre que contribuem para diminuição do fluxo sanguíneo da veia porta e artéria hepática; o nível elevado de catecolaminas que ocorre em estado de hiperglicemia e cetoacidose metabólica pode induzir à vasoconstrição; aterosclerose difusa que é comumente vista em pacientes diabéticos e hipertensos. Este caso enfatiza a necessidade de investigar infarto hepático em pacientes diabéticos com cetonemia e com aumento de enzimas hepáticas. Anticoagulantes devem ser prontamente instituídos se houver trombose vascular.

CASE REPORT: A 67 year-old hypertensive female who has been presenting, for the last 10 days, polydipsia, high urinary volume, visual and gait impairment, nausea and vomiting was admitted to the emergency room (ER). During the physical examination it was observed dehydration, skin discoloration, peripheral cyanosis, hypothermia, tachycardia, hypotension and mild diffuse abdominal pain. Admissional laboratory exams demonstrated total leukocytes: 16. 800, Cr: 3. 7, Ur: 167, Na: 133, K: 6. 9, glucose: 561; <b>arterial</b> <b>gasometry</b> (O 2 catheter: 2 L/min) : pH: 6. 93, pCO 2 : 12. 1, pO 2 : 107, B. E. : - 28. 8, HCO 3 : 2. 4, Sat 91. 3 %, lactato: 79; urinalysis: pH: 6; leukocytes: 13; density: 1015; erythrocytes: 19; protein: ++; glucose: +++; bilirubin: negative; ketonic bodies: + denote ketonemia. EKG: sharp T wave, right branch block. Patient was treated with intravenous insulin, hydration, sodium bicarbonate and ceftriaxone. After initial treatment, the laboratory exams showed Cr: 2. 2, Ur: 122, Na: 162, K: 4. 3, Ca: 6. 4, glucose: 504, pH: 7. 01, HCO 3 : 7. 1, B. E. : - 22. One day after admission the patient presented with important abdominal pain and peritoneal irritation, followed by difficulty for talking and somnolence; routine laboratory exams showed arterial gasometry: pH: 7. 4, pCO 2 : 31, pO 2 : 68, BE: - 4. 4, HCO 3 : 19, SatO 2 : 93. 5 %; Ur: 95,Cr: 1. 4, albumin: 2. 4, Ca: 0. 95, Na: 166, K: 4, bilirubin: 0. 5, bilirubin D/I: 0. 2 / 0. 3, Amylase: 1157, Gamma-GT: 56, AST 7. 210, ALT: 2. 470, SR (sedimentation rate) : 15, Lipase: 84. Abdominal ultrasound was unremarkable. Patient respiratory function and conscience level worsened, requiring intubation. Despite all resuscitation efforts, she died. Necropsy showed multiple ischemic infarcts of the liver with vascular thrombosis, splenic infarcts, generalized visceral congestion and atherosclerosis of aorta and its branches. Pancreas was normal. CONCLUSIONS: The mechanisms of hepatic and splenic infarctions in this case were unclear. The following factors may have contributed to necrosis: vomiting and fever should be considered to induce dehydration and hypotension, which further decreased portal and hepatic arterial inflows; elevated level of catecholamine in hyperglycemic states might induce vasoconstriction effects; widespread atherosclerosis is commonly seen in diabetic and hypertensive patients. This case underlies the importance of searching for hepatic necrosis or infarction in any diabetic patient with elevated liver enzymes. Anticoagulation therapy should be instituted promptly upon recognition of vascular thromboses...|$|E
