5|$|Quantum of Solace was {{the last}} in Ford Motor's three-film deal that began with 2002's Die Another Day. Although Ford sold over 90% of the Aston Martin company in 2007, the Aston Martin DBS V12 {{returned}} for the film's car chase around Lake Garda; Dan Bradley was hired as second unit director because of {{his work on the}} second and third Bourne films, so the film would continue the gritty action style begun in Casino Royale. He had intended to use Ford GTs for the opening chase, but it was replaced by the Alfa Romeo 159. After location filming in Italy, further close-ups of Craig, the cars and the truck were shot at Pinewood against a blue screen. Originally three Alfa Romeos were in the sequence: but Forster felt the scene was running too long and re-edited the scene so it only looked like two Romeos were chasing Bond. Six Aston Martins were destroyed during filming, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> purchased by a fan.|$|E

25|$|Early Buddhist monks did {{not doubt}} the {{existence}} of kami but saw them as inferior to their buddhas. Hindu deities had had the same reception: They were thought of as non-illuminated and prisoners of saṃsāra. Buddhist claims of superiority, however, encountered resistance; monks tried to overcome it by deliberately integrating kami in their system. Japanese Buddhists themselves wanted to somehow give the kami equal status. Several strategies to do this were developed and employed, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> the honji suijaku theory.|$|E
25|$|In December 1991, {{the owner}} of a white Mercedes-Benz {{limousine}} lodged a complaint against Zeng for not having paid for his vehicle, which he rented in November of that year, during the General Election. Initially refusing to pay, he later complied and no charges were filed. In June 1994, Zeng was charged with assaulting and threatening two male individuals, a claim which he initially refuted. The victims were his neighbours, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> businessman Ho Peng Keong. Zeng was ordered to pay a fine of S$4,000.|$|E

25|$|The vǫlur {{were not}} {{considered}} to be harmless. The goddess who was most skilled in magic was Freyja, and she was not only a goddess of love, but also a warlike divinity who caused screams of anguish, blood and death, and what Freyja performed in Asgard, the world of the gods, the vǫlur tried to perform in Midgard, the world of men. The weapon of the vǫlva was not the spear, the axe or the sword, but instead they were held to influence battles with different means, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> the wand, (see the section wands and weaving, below).|$|E
25|$|The Mint pressed two {{first proof}} samples on , when the Romanovs had already {{resolved}} the succession crisis {{in favor of}} Nicholas. Actual number of Constantine rubles is debated. According to Ivan Spassky, there were only five. According to studies by Bartoshevich and Valentin Yanin, there were six Constantine rubles with proper edge lettering, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> lost without trace. Yanin suggested that the sixth missing coin was appropriated by Cancrin himself. The three known coins without edge lettering (Schubert ruble, Richter ruble and Fuchs ruble) were, most likely, illegally retained by the Mint employees or their superiors.|$|E

25|$|The militants {{began their}} attack when they opened fire {{at a small}} group of IDF soldiers, {{shooting}} at them from a distance of approximately one hundred meters, as they were giving water to a group of 10 illegal immigrants from Africa who were crossing the border into Israel as well. During the incident, which was thwarted at a relatively early stage by IDF forces at the site, one Israeli soldier was killed by the militants and another was moderately injured. Both of the soldiers were graduates of Hesder yeshivas. The three militants were killed in the ensuing gunfight, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> killed by a female combat soldier from the mixed-gender Caracal Battalion.|$|E
25|$|In 1801 the U.S. {{government}} purchased land on Wallabout Bay for {{the construction}} of the Brooklyn Navy Yard, stimulating some growth in the area. Ferry service linking Manhattan and Brooklyn launched in 1814, and Brooklyn's population exploded from 4,000 to nearly 100,000 by 1850. Fort Greene was known as The Hill and was home to a small commuter population, several large farms—the Post Farm, the Spader farm, the Ryerson Farm, and the Jackson farm—and a burial ground. As early as the 1840s the farms' owners began selling off their land in smaller plots for development. Country villas, frame row houses, and the occasional brick row house dotted the countryside, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> home to poet Walt Whitman, editor of the Brooklyn Eagle newspaper.|$|E

25|$|On 25 March 1941, the destroyers Crispi and Sella {{departed}} from Leros {{island in the}} Aegean at night for the allied naval base at Souda Bay, Crete, each one carrying three MTs. Once inside the bay, the six boats located their targets: the British heavy cruiser , the Norwegian tanker Pericles of 8,300tons, another tanker, and a cargo ship. Two MTs hit York amidships, flooding her aft boilers and magazines. The Pericles was severely damaged and settled on the bottom. The other barchini apparently missed their intended targets, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> stranded on the beach. All six Italian pilots were captured. The disabled York was later scuttled with demolition charges by her crew before the German conquest of Crete, while the disabled Pericles sank in April 1941 while being towed to Alexandria.|$|E
25|$|This runestone {{in style}} Pr3 {{is one of}} the runestones in Hagby. It was {{discovered}} in 1930 in the basement under the main building of the old estate Lissby which had been demolished in the late 19th century. It had been inserted in the basement wall with the engraved side visible together with the runestones U 152 and U 154. When the basement collapsed, the runestone was splintered into a great number of minor and major pieces of which the top part was the largest one. A fragment of the stone was discovered in the field on the property of Lissby. All in all, no less than 70 pieces were reassembled, and in 1931, the repaired stone was raised in the garden of Hagby. The stone is in granite and it is 2.60 m tall and 1.5 m wide. The inscription is damaged and especially in its beginning and end. It refers to several stones <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> probably the runestone U 155.|$|E
25|$|The {{site was}} {{originally}} {{occupied by a}} temple called , which was later transferred to Kyoto. Its first chief abbots were men from important families, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> Nichiro, better known as Nichiei, the name he assumed {{when he became a}} priest, who was an uncle of Ashikaga Takauji and the temple's fifth chief abbot. Nichiei was a natural son of Prince Morinaga, and for this reason he rebuilt the temple in 1357 dedicating it to his father. Nichiei was born from a woman called Minami no Ōnkata, who attended the prince while he was a prisoner of the Ashikaga in the cave now at Kamakura-gū. He and his mother are buried within the temple, while Prince Morinaga's grave is in nearby Nikaidō. Nichiei installed two cenotaphs in memory of his parents on top of the hill behind the main hall. During the Edo period the temple was protected and maintained by the Tokugawa and their vassals. The temple is supposed to have been entrusted to Nichiei by Nichiren himself.|$|E

Botham did not win any man of the match awards in the World Cup until 1992 when he won two. Against India at the WACA Ground, he bowled tightly and {{restricted}} India, needing 237, to only 27 runs from his ten overs, an economy rate of 2.70 which was significantly lower than anyone else's. He captured two wickets <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> Sachin Tendulkar. England won by nine runs. Against Australia at Sydney Cricket Ground later in the competition, Botham won the award {{for the sort of}} all-round performance which had made his reputation. Australia won the toss and decided to bat first. They scored 171 all out in 49 overs and Botham took four for 31 in his ten. He then opened the England innings with Graham Gooch and scored 53 from only 77 balls in a partnership with Gooch of 107. England went on to win by eight wickets with nine overs to spare.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the large}} number of specimens, {{statistical}} analysis can be used to investigate this problem. In 2008 Chiappe et alii published a morphometrical study of 106 fossils. The population showed a clear bimodal distribution {{of the size of the}} animals with two weight classes. However, there was no correlation between size and the possession of the long tail feathers. From this it was concluded that either the sexes did not differ in size or both sexes had the long feathers. The first case was deemed most likely which left the size distribution to be explained. It was hypothesised that the smaller animals consisted of very young individuals, that the large animals were adults and that the rarity of individuals with an intermediate size was caused by Confuciusornis experiencing a growth spurt just prior to reaching adulthood, the shortness of which would have prevented many becoming fossilised during this phase. This interpretation was criticised by Dieter S. Peters who pointed out that, as the smaller animals were not neonates, the young of Confuciusornis had to grow very fast immediately after hatching regardless. This would then imply two growth spurts, which assumption was not very parsimonious. He thought the data would be more simply explained by assuming that both sexes had the long feathers <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> the largest. He favoured the possibility that these were the females, having observed such a pattern with the modern pheasant-tailed jacana (Hydrophasianus chirurgus), a water-bird in which both sexes have long tails and the female sex is the heaviest. He accounted for the fact that most specimens show no tails at all by the possibility that Confuciusornis shed the feathers as a defence mechanism, a method used by several extant species, which would have been triggered by the stress induced by the very volcanic explosion that buried the animals.|$|E
