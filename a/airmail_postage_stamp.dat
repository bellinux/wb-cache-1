5000|$|Notes on the illustrator: [...] "Raden Mas Pirgadie {{was born}} in Banyumas, west Java, {{possibly}} in 1875. As he was from an aristocratic family, he had contact with Dutch residents of the Netherlands East Indies (Indonesia) including the artist F.J. Du Chattel (1856-1917), who taught him to paint with watercolours in 1889. Pirngadie was a very skilled and accurate draftsman, and made illustrations for J.E. Jasper’s monograph on traditional arts and crafts of the Netherland East Indies that was published in 1912. From 1928, he worked for many years at the Bataviasch Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen (Batavia Society of Arts and Sciences, now the Museum Nasional) in Batavia (Jakarta). He also designed <b>airmail</b> <b>postaged</b> <b>stamps</b> for the Post en Telegraafdienst (Post and Telegraph Services) of the Netherlands east Indies in 1931. He died in Batavia in 1936.|$|R

While Adélie Land, Adele Island and Cape Pepin were named by Jules Dumont d'Urville {{in honor of his}} wife, the penguin was named after Adélie Land where it was discovered. In 1981, an <b>airmail</b> <b>postage</b> <b>stamp</b> of the French Antarctic Territory featuring Adèle Dumont D'Urville was released.|$|E

2500|$|The 1930 Graf Zeppelin stamps were a set {{of three}} <b>airmail</b> <b>postage</b> <b>stamps,</b> each {{depicting}} {{the image of the}} Graf Zeppelin airship, exclusively issued by the United States Post Office Department, USPOD, in 1930 for delivery of mail carried aboard that airship. Although the stamps were valid for postage shipped via the Zeppelin Pan American flight from Germany to the United States, via Brazil, the set was marketed to collectors and was largely intended to promote the route. 93.5% of the revenue generated by the sale of these stamps went to the Zeppelin Airship Works in Germany. The stamps were also issued as a gesture of good will toward Germany. [...] The three stamps were used briefly and then withdrawn from sale where the remainder of the stock was destroyed by the Post Office. Due to the great depression and the high cost of the stamps most collectors and the general public could not afford to purchase or use them. Consequently, only about 227,000 of the stamps were sold, just 7% of the total made, making them relatively scarce and highly prized by collectors.|$|R
50|$|Finally, it {{is common}} for the stamps of a {{definitive}} series to be issued one or a few at a time, as postal rates change. Logically, {{they are part of a}} single group, with a unified design theme and a sequence of values, even though ten years or more may have elapsed from the first to the last. The same reasoning could be applied to special-purpose stamps such as <b>airmail</b> or <b>postage</b> due <b>stamps.</b>|$|R
