The decomposition of Mn(NO 3) 2 mixed with <b>acetylene</b> <b>black</b> progressed at a lower temperature than that of Mn(NO 3) 2 alone. The formation {{and the size of}} β-MnO 2 nanocrystals depended strongly on the heating temperature (T) and S BET of the starting <b>acetylene</b> <b>black.</b> The β-MnO 2 /acetylene black composite could be produced for <b>acetylene</b> <b>black</b> of S BET = 60 m 2 g - 1 at 160 °C ≤ T ≤ 320 °C and S BET = 133 m 2 g - 1 at 160 °C ≤ T ≤ 300 °C. However, the composite could not be obtained for <b>acetylene</b> <b>black</b> with larger specific surface area (S BET = 300 m 2 g - 1). The size of β-MnO 2 nanocrystals decreases and their dispersion in the composites increases with an increase in the S BET or the heating temperature. The lithium insertion behavior and voltage feature in the first discharge process depend strongly {{on the size of the}} β-MnO 2 nanocrystals as well as their dispersion. The electrochemical lithium insertion progressed topotactically for well-dispersed β-MnO 2 nanocrystals, retaining the framework of their rutile structure to permit a large amount of lithium insertion (Li/Mn = 1. 15 in the solid). The charge/ discharge curves showed a flat voltage plateau around 2. 8 V and a stable cycling feature up to the 20 th cycle. It is likely that the easy lattice expansion of β-MnO 2 nanocrystals along the a crystal axis plays an important role in the topotactic lithium insertion/extraction reactions. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

However, {{to increase their}} energy performances, low viscosity, electronic conductive suspensions loaded with active material are required. Comparing the behavior of three types of carbon black particles in water suspensions, we show that compressed <b>acetylene</b> carbon <b>black</b> particles suspensions display a slow variation of viscosity and conductivity {{as a function of}} concentration. It allows reaching intermediate viscosity (1 Pa s for a shear rate of 10 s− 1) with high electronic conductivity between 0. 1 and 5 mS/cm. This behavior is very promising for flow applications. At small range, attractive van der Walls interactions between carbon aggregates dominate. However, at longer range, compressed <b>acetylene</b> carbon <b>black</b> particles are highly attractive in water. After shearing with emulsifier, fractal-like shape clusters are obtained through a diffusion limited aggregation process. These fractal clusters constitute the building blocks of a flexible connected network. By contrast, for the two other investigated carbons, an energy barrier has to be overcome to enable aggregation.

Great interesting investigations and creative works {{have been carried out}} to develop technology for powering our society, including disrupt technology for efficient energy storage and power manage. Supercapacitors (SP) also known as electrochemical double layer capacitors uses high surface area active electrode materials and various electrolytes to achieve capacitance of several order magnitude greater than the conventional capacitor, which allows energy density greater than that of conventional capacitors and power density greater than that of batteries. Electrolyte with suitable properties like high Conductivity, Thermal and Mechanical Stability, high charge Mobility, wide Electrochemical Stability Window (ESW) and compactible active electrodes are required for supercapacitors of high performance.

Three dielectric spectroscopy techniques, which are frequency response analyzer and transformer ratio bridge in both frequency domain, and charging/discharging current system in time domain, were jointly {{used to measure the}} low loss XLPE cables in the frequency range from 10 - 4 Hz to 104 Hz at temperatures from 20 °C to 80 °C. Degassing effects and thermal ageing effects have also been studied with the spectroscopy techniques. Thermal-electric behaviour and maximum voltages for thermal breakdown have been theoretically simulated for the model cables. Three loss origins of the XLPE cables have been found with different loss mechanisms. Conduction loss due to thermally activated electron/hole hopping dominates the lower frequency range from 10 - 4 Hz to 1 Hz; Semicon loss due to its in series resistance with the insulation layer in cable equivalent circuit dominates the higher frequency range from 102 Hz to 104 Hz; intrinsic polarization loss of the XLPE insulation has dominant flat loss spectra in the mid-frequency range from 1 Hz to 102 Hz. Degassing was found to decrease the conductivity of the model cables, while thermal ageing greatly increased the conductivity. Thermal-electric simulation results with FEMLAB have shown that the position of maximum field changes from inner to outer insulation boundary under higher applied voltages. A loss mechanism model with mathematical expression for dielectric loss spectrum calculation is finally proposed to explain the total dielectric loss of polymer power cables.
