40|$|Low empathy {{is assumed}} in {{theoretical}} models of narcissism. However, research has not examined which aspects of narcissism {{are linked to}} empathy or tested whether narcissists’ low empathy reflects inability or motivation. Study 1 (N= 533) showed that the maladaptive facets of narcissism (i. e., entitlement, exploitativeness, exhibitionism) were negatively associated with dispositional cognitive and affective empathy. Study 2 (N= 98) examined whether narcissists are capable of empathy. Female participants watched an empathy-inducing video clip under instructions to take the target’s perspective or no instructions. High (versus low) maladaptive-narcissists reported lower empathy for the target in the control condition, but this difference was no longer significant in the perspective-taking condition. Study 3 (N= 39) examined whether narcissists’ lack of empathy is reflected at a physiological level. Physiological responses were recorded while participants listened to an empathy-inducing <b>audio</b> <b>blog.</b> High (versus low) maladaptive-narcissists showed lower heart rate during the blog controlling for baseline. Although narcissists lack empathy at both a self-reported and automatic level, there is promising evidence they are capable if forced to take another’s perspective...|$|E

40|$|Any kind of {{language}} teaching that involves a computer is known as computer assisted language learning or CALL. CALL {{can be used to}} teach first language skills like reading or writing and second or foreign language acquisition. Not all CALL uses natural language processing or NLP. Examples of non-NLP CALL include the use of wikis, blogs, discussion forums, email, podcasts, instant and simultaneous messaging, audio and video conferencing, voice over internet protocol, CDs and DVDs, Google captioned videos, <b>audio</b> <b>blogs,</b> voiced bulletin boards, PowerPoint, online role playing games, interactive whiteboards, learning management systems like Moodle, and websites with hyperlinked audio and video (Levy, 2009). CALL systems that use NLP are distinguished by the use of lemmatization, parsers, speech recognition and speech synthesis, and corpora to produce concordances and parallel texts. Early CALL systems using NLP include PLATO developed by the University of Illinois in 1960, which comprised exercises and email exchange, and Athena produced by MIT in 1983 that employed an artificial intelligence tutor and multimedia (Nerbonne, 2004). Intelligent CALL (ICALL) systems are those that utilize artificial intelligence (AI) ...|$|R

50|$|Blogging, too, {{has become}} a {{pervasive}} form of media. A blog is a website, usually maintained by an individual, with regular entries of commentary, descriptions of events, or interactive media such as images or video. Entries are commonly displayed in reverse chronological order, with most recent posts shown on top. Many blogs provide commentary or news on a particular subject; others function as more personal online diaries. A typical blog combines text, images and other graphics, and links to other blogs, web pages, and related media. The ability for readers to leave comments in an interactive format {{is an important part}} of many blogs. Most blogs are primarily textual, although some focus on art (artlog), photographs (photoblog), sketchblog, videos (vlog), music (MP3 <b>blog),</b> <b>audio</b> (podcasting) are part of a wider network of social media. Microblogging is another type of blogging which consists of blogs with very short posts.|$|R

Our work aims at developing a storytelling platform which forms a new way of storytelling as postmodern literature and an unprecedented aplenty imaginative world in addition to-the cognitive real world. With our Storylog system, the individuals would be able to engage in a form of first-person storytelling in the place they locate. Via RFID tagging and Wifi connection, all participants could conceptually contribute to an infinite narration of an invisible layer, the Fantasica upon a physical space with portable devices. Story conversation enables people to interact with the story roles as well as to interact with the real people further. With multiple users in different space and time simultaneously, our system forms the collaborative storytelling and augmented social relationships and generates a new field in social relationship and cultural discussion...|$|R
40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{identify}} how the use of {{information and communication technologies}} (ICT), specifically tablets, may foster students’ 21 st century skills of knowledge construction, collaboration, and skilled communication and may further support knowledge construction in science, reading comprehension, and vocabulary development. This mixed methods research explored 21 Grade 5 students’ tablet (iPad) screen interactions and <b>audio</b> recordings, <b>blog</b> posts, interview responses, researcher observations, and student artifacts during an interdisciplinary science and language arts unit. Students worked in pairs or small groups on iPads to learn science and language arts concepts. Qualitative data were collected using video and audio monitoring tools (NestCams, 2016). Using NVivo 11. 4, qualitative data were coded using the 21 CLD Learning Activity Rubrics (Microsoft Corporation, 2015). Queries were further run to determine data that correlated between the use of tablets for learning and other 21 st century skills. Findings showed high instances of 21 st century skills while students worked on tablets. The way students used tablets to support their learning seemed to depend on the level of knowledge construction, collaboration, and skilled communication. Quantitative data were also collected using reading comprehension, vocabulary, and science pre- and post-tests. Dependent samples t-tests were run to determine if there was growth from pre-test to post-test. Results indicated statistically significant growth only in science content knowledge. Qualitative findings were triangulated with the quantitative results to illustrate descriptive growth trends in science and language arts. This study highlights the importance of being critical towards multimodal features within apps to support students’ development of 21 st century skills and subject-specific knowledge. Recommendations and implications for theory, practice, and methodological approaches are provided for future studies...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe have {{tendency}} to exhibit ourselves through the data we share about ourselves including, liking, friendship, follows, disliking, pictures, <b>audio,</b> videos, causes, <b>blogs</b> and sites.

40|$|Brettle {{has been}} {{exploring}} {{the ways in}} which observational filmmaking techniques can be adapted to radio documentary production. This research process commenced with taking a story told on screen into an audio version of the same tale and has since explored aural establishing shots, tracking, panning, long shots and close ups, challenging locations and editing styles to develop an observational audio recording and sound editing technique to support her research on ways in which a story can be told with sound only but using observational documentary film style. This program is a synthesis of her research development, which has culminated in a project that is still moving audiences to write to her from around the world. It draws together research into character, location and event based observational representation and confidently illustrates audio as an observational documentary form, depicting a story that is primarily told via indirect modes of address (few interviews and no narration) with a texture that takes the medium far from the single studio mike and foley artist days and establishes a clear benchmark in story telling. In Directing the Documentary, esteemed filmmaker Michael Rabiger writes, &# 039;Radio documentary is resurging and even showing the way forward for film makers [...] for unforgettable sound design and sheer gut wrenching emotion listen to Kyla Brettle&# 039;s 000 Ambulance&# 039;.
