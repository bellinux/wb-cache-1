5|$|Kingswear Castle {{was built}} to protect the coastal town of Dartmouth in Devon. In the medieval period, the town's harbour, located in the estuary of the River Dart, was an {{important}} trading and fishing port, <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> up to 600 vessels.

5|$|The unrest {{caused by}} this {{division}} of the Pashtun lands led {{to the rise of}} Saidullah, a Pashtun fakir who led an army of at least 10,000 against the British garrison in Malakand.

5|$|Unlike Han society, {{which had}} a strict {{separation}} of responsibilities along gender lines, and placed women in a subservient role to men, the Khitan women of the Liao dynasty performed {{many of the same}} functions that the Khitan men did.

5|$|An {{extraterrestrial}} civilization {{may choose}} to communicate with humanity by means of artifacts or probes rather than by radio, for various reasons.

Radio would be completely unsuitable for surveillance and continued monitoring of a civilization, and should an extraterrestrial civilization wish to perform these activities on humanity, artifacts may be the only option other than to send large, crewed spacecraft to the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Bayard's Cove Fort {{was built}} in the early 16th century to protect the coastal town of Dartmouth in Devon.

50|$|Because of his betrayal, he {{lost his}} full {{political}} influence after the coronation of Stephen V in 1270. This reduction in political power is demonstrated {{by the fact that}} he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>holding</b> an office only after the sudden death of the king, when he served as ispán (comes) of Pozsony County between 1272 and 1273. He was appointed judge royal twice in 1273, which was the second-highest secular position after the palatine. Besides that he also functioned as ispán of Baranya County, Szeben and Bánya ispánates. Between 1275 and 1276, he was the voivode of Transylvania and ispán of Szolnok County for the second term.|$|R

Offensive lineman Scott Burley forced a fumble against Nevada linebacker Brandon Marshall, who had recovered a third-down fumble by Turner. Burley subsequently recovered the forced fumble and gave Maryland a first down.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{contend that}} for the UN and North Korea, locked in a bitter battle where neither could gain the upper hand, {{logistics}} {{was among the most}} important determining factors in how the war would progress. As the disparity in logistics capability widened between the UN and North Korean forces, the well-supported UN troops were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> their positions along the Pusan Perimeter, while the morale and the fighting quality of NKPA deteriorated as resupplies became increasingly unreliable. This trend ultimately culminated in the UN recapturing Seoul, the key logistics center of the battle, and the collapse of the North Korean logistics system with the entire NKPA.|$|E
