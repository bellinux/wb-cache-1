5|$|Sesquiterpene lactones are {{a diverse}} group of biologically active {{compounds}} that are being investigated for their <b>antiinflammatory</b> and antitumor activities. Some of these compounds have been isolated and chemically characterized from Russula brevipes: russulactarorufin, lactarorufin-A, and 24-ethyl-cholesta-7,22E-diene-3β,5α,6β-triol.|$|E
5|$|Engleromyces sinensis {{is used in}} China in {{traditional}} medicine for its antibiotic and <b>antiinflammatory</b> properties, and is sold in market stalls in Yunnan. Several bioactive metabolites have been isolated and identified from the fungus. It produces engleromycin, a cytochalasin. This compound, which is also made by E.goetzii, has antibiotic and cytotoxic activity. Additional metabolites include the novel compound neoengleromycin, and the previously known cytochalasin D and 19,20-epoxycytochalasin D. Neoengleromycin has an unusual chemical structure featuring a rare amine-substituted hydroxamic acid skeleton.|$|E
25|$|Vaisar et al. uses shotgun {{proteomics}} to implicate protease inhibition and complement activation in the <b>antiinflammatory</b> {{properties of}} high-density lipoprotein. In {{a study by}} Lee et al., higher expression level of hnRNP A2/B1 and Hsp90 were observed in human hepatoma HepG2 cells than in wild type cells. This led to a search for reported functional roles mediated in concert by both these multifunctional cellular chaperones.|$|E
25|$|Endogenous {{sulfur dioxide}} in low {{concentrations}} causes endothelium-dependent vasodilation. In higher concentrations it causes endothelium-independent vasodilation {{and has a}} negative inotropic effect on cardiac output function, thus effectively lowering blood pressure and myocardial oxygen consumption. The vasodilating and bronchodilating effects of sulfur dioxide are mediated via ATP-dependent calcium channels and L-type ("dihydropyridine") calcium channels. Endogenous sulfur dioxide is also a potent <b>antiinflammatory,</b> antioxidant and cytoprotective agent. It lowers blood pressure and slows hypertensive remodeling of blood vessels, especially thickening of their intima. It also regulates lipid metabolism.|$|E
25|$|While it {{is known}} that {{melatonin}} interacts with the immune system, the details of those interactions are unclear. <b>Antiinflammatory</b> effect seems to be the most relevant and most documented in the literature. There have been few trials designed to judge the effectiveness of melatonin in disease treatment. Most existing data are based on small, incomplete clinical trials. Any positive immunological effect is thought {{to be the result of}} melatonin acting on high-affinity receptors (MT1 and MT2) expressed in immunocompetent cells. In preclinical studies, melatonin may enhance cytokine production, and by doing this, counteract acquired immunodeficiences. Some studies also suggest that melatonin might be useful fighting infectious disease including viral, such as HIV, and bacterial infections, and potentially in the treatment of cancer.|$|E
2500|$|In {{experimental}} {{models of}} colitis in mice, Salvinorin A has {{shown to have}} <b>antiinflammatory</b> and antinociceptive effects mediated by kappa-opioid receptors (KOR) and CB1 receptors. [...] In another study on rats, it was found to increase IntraCranial Self-Stimulation thresholds and inhibit their reward system, temporarily causing depressive-like behavior. [...] However, long-term salvinorin application {{has been shown to}} alleviate depressive symptoms in rats exposed to chronic mild stress, a common animal model of depression ...|$|E
2500|$|DHEA is an uncompetitive {{inhibitor}} of [...] (Ki = 17μM; IC50 = 18.7μM), {{and is able}} {{to lower}} [...] levels and reduce NADPH-dependent free radical production. It is thought that this action may possibly be responsible for much of the <b>antiinflammatory,</b> antihyperplastic, chemopreventative, antihyperlipidemic, antidiabetic, and antiobesic, as well as certain immunomodulating activities of DHEA (with some experimental evidence to support this notion available). However, it has also been said that inhibition of G6PDH activity by DHEA in vivo has not been observed and that the concentrations required for DHEA to inhibit G6PDH in vitro are very high, thus making the possible contribution of G6PDH inhibition to the effects of DHEA uncertain.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} {{mechanism}} of nuclear receptor action involves direct binding {{of the nuclear}} receptor to a DNA hormone response element. [...] This mechanism {{is referred to as}} transactivation. [...] However some nuclear receptors not only have the ability to directly bind to DNA, but also to other transcription factors. [...] This binding often results in deactivation of the second transcription factor in a process known as transrepression. One example of a nuclear receptor that are able to transrepress is the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). [...] Furthermore, certain GR ligands known as Selective Glucocorticoid Receptor Agonists (SEGRAs) are able to activate GR {{in such a way that}} GR more strongly transrepresses than transactivates. [...] This selectivity increases the separation between the desired <b>antiinflammatory</b> effects and undesired metabolic side effects of these selective glucocorticoids.|$|E
2500|$|A hyphen can {{clarify that}} two {{adjacent}} vowels—whether {{two of the}} same letter (e.g., oo, ee) or two different letters (e.g., ae, ei)—are pronounced separately rather than being merged in a diphthong. The question is how necessary the clarification is. Thus, hyphenated [...] and [...] have plenty of support, consensus-wise (plenty of users consider their hyphens as not superfluous), although solid deescalate and cooperation have plenty of support as well (plenty of users consider the hyphens superfluous). Consensus for styling varies by class, subclass, and even by individual word, with the common theme being that internal punctuation drops out of any combination judged as instantly recognizable enough in its context not to need it. As classes, there are doubling (namely, aa, ee, ii, oo, uu, yy) and nondoubling (for example, a+e, a+i, a+o; e+e, e+i, e+o). Several subclasses exist. There are combinations that are not rare in English as diphthongs and also not rare as nondiphthongs for users willing to style prefixed words solidly (such as ee and ei); regarding de+e/re+e/pre+e and de+i/re+i/pre+i, nearly everyone agrees that some fully fused examples (such as reiterate and reinforce) need no hyphen, but other examples have more evenly split pluralities (such as reexamine/ or deemphasize/). There are combinations that are rare in English as diphthongs (for example, aa and ii) but not rare in prefixed words for those willing to style them solidly; and thus either they hardly need clarification within prefixed words (the solidification argument; thus intraarterial and <b>antiinflammatory)</b> or they need a hyphen to avoid looking like rare diphthongs, which are [...] "odd-looking" [...] because rare (the hyphenation argument, thus [...] and [...] ).|$|E
