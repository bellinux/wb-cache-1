5|$|Speaking in Parliament on 12 February 2009, Nominated Member of Parliament Thio Li-ann {{posed the}} {{question}} of whether the right to vote is a constitutional one and suggested that the Law Minister obtain an <b>advisory</b> <b>opinion</b> to clarify the point. This issue was briefly dealt with by the Minister who simply answered it in the affirmative, rendering the need for a resolution by the constitutional tribunal nugatory. Thio subsequently expressed the view that it would be desirable to ask the Constitutional Tribunal to give its authoritative opinion as the courts are the final arbiter on questions of constitutionality in Singapore.|$|E
5|$|The Permanent Court of International Justice was {{provided}} {{for by the}} Covenant, but not established by it. The Council and the Assembly established its constitution. Its judges were elected by the Council and the Assembly, and its budget {{was provided}} by the latter. The Court was to hear and decide any international dispute which the parties concerned submitted to it. It might also give an <b>advisory</b> <b>opinion</b> on any dispute or question referred to it by the Council or the Assembly. The Court was open to all {{the nations of the world}} under certain broad conditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{documents}} {{most often}} cited to justifying {{the elimination of}} Native mascots are the <b>advisory</b> <b>opinion</b> by the United States Commission on Civil Rights in 2001 and a resolution by the American Psychological Association in 2005. Neither of these documents refer to subjective perceptions of offensiveness, but to scientific evidence of harms and legal definitions of discrimination. However, the issue is often discussed in the media in terms of feelings and opinions, and prevents full understanding of the history and {{context of the use}} of Native American names and images and why their use by sports teams should be eliminated.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights {{released}} an <b>advisory</b> <b>opinion</b> {{calling for an}} end to the use of Native American images and team names by non-Native schools. While recognizing the right to freedom of expression, the commission also recognizes those Native Americans and civil rights advocates that maintain these mascots, by promoting stereotypes, may violate anti-discrimination laws. When found in educational institutions, mascots may also create a hostile environment inconsistent with learning to respect diverse cultures, but instead teach that stereotypes that misrepresent a minority group are permissible. Those schools that claim that their sports imagery stimulate interest in Native American culture have not listened to Native groups and civil rights leaders who point out that even purportedly positive stereotypes both present a false portrayal of the past and prevent understanding of contemporary Native people as fellow Americans.|$|E
5|$|Two minor controversies marked Beshear's {{tenure as}} {{attorney}} general. The {{first came in}} the aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in the 1980 case of Stone v. Graham. The ruling struck down the state law requiring the posting of the Ten Commandments in all of the state's classrooms on grounds that it violated the Establishment Clause of the federal constitution. State Superintendent Raymond Barber asked the Supreme Court to clarify whether its ruling meant that all of the copies of the Commandments already posted had to be taken down or whether it simply invalidated the Kentucky requirement for them to be posted; the Court refused the request for clarification. Beshear then issued an <b>advisory</b> <b>opinion</b> that displaying the Commandments in classrooms under any circumstances was banned by the Court's ruling.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2009 {{legislative}} session, Attorney General Jack Conway {{was asked}} to issue advisory opinions on two gambling-related issues. Republican state senator Damon Thayer asked for an opinion as to whether Instant Racing – allowing individuals to bet {{on the outcome of}} previously run horse races – would be allowable under the state constitution. Democratic Representative Jody Richards also asked for an <b>advisory</b> <b>opinion</b> as to whether a constitutional amendment was required to allow video lottery terminals at the state's racetracks or whether they could be construed as legal under the amendment that allowed a state lottery. Critics charged that Conway had a conflict of interest in the matter because his father {{was a member of the}} Kentucky Horse Racing Commission, but Conway denied that a conflict existed, and the state Executive Branch Ethics Board refused to take a position unless an official request for an investigation were made. Conway subsequently opined in June 2009 that video lottery terminals would be legal if governed by the Kentucky Lottery Corporation and in January 2010 that instant racing would be allowable under the state's parimutuel betting statutes with a few regulatory changes.|$|E

25|$|The Court's {{mandatory}} jurisdiction {{came from}} three sources: the Optional Clause of the League of Nations, general international conventions and special bipartite international treaties. Cases {{could also be}} submitted directly by states, {{but they were not}} bound to submit material unless it fell into those three categories. The Court could issue either judgments or <b>advisory</b> <b>opinions.</b> Judgments were directly binding while <b>advisory</b> <b>opinions</b> were not.

25|$|The {{concluding}} {{paragraph of}} the <b>advisory</b> <b>opinion</b> (paragraph 123), {{which is the}} operative part of the ruling (dispositif) contains three vote tallies: it proclaims that the Court unanimously found that it had jurisdiction to reply to the General Assembly's request for an advisory opinion; given that the case law of the Court recognises that it has the discretion to comply with such requests, the Court decided by nine votes to five to comply with this particular <b>advisory</b> <b>opinion</b> request. And, {{on the merits of}} the case, by ten votes to four, the Court decided that the declaration of independence was not in violation of international law.|$|E

25|$|On 8 October 2008, the UN General Assembly resolved, on a {{proposal}} by Serbia, {{to ask the}} International Court of Justice to render an <b>advisory</b> <b>opinion</b> on the legality of Kosovo's declaration of independence. The <b>advisory</b> <b>opinion,</b> which is not binding over decisions by states to recognise or not recognise Kosovo, was rendered on 22 July 2010, holding that Kosovo's declaration of independence was not in violation either of general principles of international law, which do not prohibit unilateral declarations of independence, nor of specific international law– in particular UNSCR 1244– which did not define the final status process nor reserve the outcome to a decision of the Security Council.|$|E
25|$|The <b>advisory</b> <b>opinion</b> by {{the court}} was seen to have set a {{possible}} precedent that could have far-reaching implications for separatist movements around the world, and even for Serbia's EU membership talks.

25|$|Many anti-nuclear weapons groups {{cite the}} 1996 <b>Advisory</b> <b>Opinion</b> of the International Court of Justice, Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, {{in which it}} found that 'the threat or {{use of nuclear weapons}} would {{generally}} be contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict'.|$|E

25|$|Due to Serbian {{claims that}} Kosovo {{is part of}} its {{sovereign}} territory, its initial reactions included recalling ambassadors from countries that recognised Kosovo for several months, indicting Kosovar leaders on charges of high treason, and litigating the case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ).

25|$|The {{most famous}} case setting forth the {{parameters}} of this requirement is Muskrat v. United States, 219 U.S. 346 (1911), in which the Court held that when Congress paid the legal bills for both the plaintiffs and the defendant (in this case the U.S. Treasury department, by designation), then {{there was no real}} controversy between the parties, and a judgment of the Court would be the equivalent of an <b>advisory</b> <b>opinion.</b>|$|E

50|$|The International Court of Justice has {{jurisdiction}} in {{two types of}} cases: contentious issues between states in which the court produces binding rulings between states that agree, or have previously agreed, {{to submit to the}} ruling of the court; and <b>advisory</b> <b>opinions,</b> which provide reasoned, but non-binding, rulings on properly submitted questions of international law, usually {{at the request of the}} United Nations General Assembly. <b>Advisory</b> <b>opinions</b> do not have to concern particular controversies between states, though they often do.|$|R

40|$|Protocol 16 ECHR {{will provide}} for an {{extension}} of the advisory jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), enabling highest national courts to request <b>advisory</b> <b>opinions</b> on questions of principle concerning the interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) or its Protocols. This extension of the ECtHR’s advisory jurisdiction aims to achieve two goals: a reduction in the ECtHR’s excessive docket, and the enhancement of dialogue between the ECtHR and (highest) national courts. While the aims of this reform initiative are laudable, we argue that Protocol 16 is likely to fail to achieve its objectives. Our analysis suggests that rather than facilitating the Court’s adjudicatory function, extended advisory jurisdiction has the potential to impact on the Court’s constitutionalist function in a manner which can be better achieved through the Court’s contentious cases. The burden this procedure will place on the Court’s already overstretched resources would risk delays to contentious cases and potentially undermine judicial comity should requests for <b>advisory</b> <b>opinions</b> be declined. Furthermore, evidence of ‘constructive’ dialogue between highest national courts and the ECtHR is emerging in contentious cases without the need for an extended <b>advisory</b> <b>opinions</b> mechanism. Rather than achieving its objectives, Protocol 16 risks exacerbating the Court’s backlog and nullifying the positive effects of <b>advisory</b> <b>opinions</b> on dialogue...|$|R
25|$|Brandeis recited {{traditional}} Article III jurisprudence {{by recognizing}} well-established constitutional {{limits on the}} federal judicial power. The concurrence's theme of judicial restraint is not inconsistent with the plurality's decision: a federal court should only decide an actual Article III controversy when the facts present one, and should refuse to render an <b>advisory</b> <b>opinion</b> on the entire TVA program. Brandeis then relied on the avoidance doctrine {{to argue that the}} Court should not reach the merits of the constitutional issue.|$|E
25|$|Accordance with International Law of the Unilateral Declaration of Independence In Respect of Kosovo was {{a request}} for an <b>advisory</b> <b>opinion</b> {{referred}} to the International Court of Justice by the United Nations General Assembly regarding the 2008 Kosovo declaration of independence.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a brief review {{and analysis of}} advisory proceedings before the International Court of Justice {{as well as an}} explanation of the nature and importance of <b>advisory</b> <b>opinions</b> as specific decisions of the International Court of Justice. The intention was to make the public more familiar with the nature of these proceedings drawing attention of the professional public to some specific elements that characterize advisory procedures, which in a sense make them closer to the proceedings in resolving disputes between states. Although not binding by their nature as are decisions of the Court, <b>advisory</b> <b>opinions</b> have, however, some weight and importance that primarily stem from the importance and authority of the body that provides them. A non-binding effect of <b>advisory</b> <b>opinions</b> is just a starting point in explaining them. Actually, it is the fact that opinions have a great authority and this requires some further explanations...|$|R
