5|$|Rotaviral {{enteritis}} is a mild {{to severe}} disease characterised by nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhoea and low-grade fever. Once {{a child is}} infected by the virus, there is an incubation period of <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> before symptoms appear. The period of illness is acute. Symptoms often start with vomiting followed by four to eight days of profuse diarrhoea. Dehydration {{is more common in}} rotavirus infection than in most of those caused by bacterial pathogens, and is {{the most common cause of}} death related to rotavirus infection.|$|E
5|$|As Gert {{was several}} {{days away from}} Bermuda, the NHC advised {{residents}} there to monitor {{the progress of the}} storm, Due to uncertainties in the future forecast, as well as the size and strength of Gert, a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch was issued for the island on September19, <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> prior to its closest approach. As Gert moved closer to the island, the watch and warning were replaced by a hurricane warning on September20, which was maintained until the following day after Gert moved further away. Before Gert passed by the island, officials closed two schools and converted them to emergency shelters. Police workers advised 700families to leave their houses. Cruise lines diverted ships away, while hundreds of tourists took flights to leave the island.|$|E
5|$|Hours before Isabel made {{landfall}} on North Carolina, the National Hurricane Center {{issued a}} tropical storm warning {{for a portion of}} the southern Long Island coastline from the New Jersey/New York border to Moriches. About a day before the hurricane moved ashore, forecasters estimated the hurricane possessed a 10% chance of passing within 75miles (120km) of New York City. Other portions of southern New England were estimated to have similar probabilities, with the same forecast predicting a 3% chance for it passing within 75miles (120km) of Eastport, Maine. By <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> before Isabel struck land until several hours after it moved ashore, forecasters predicted the storm to pass over western New York as a transitioning tropical cyclone before passing into Canada as an extratropical cyclone.|$|E

Bush's debate {{preparations}} in 1984—co-founded, and served as co-presidents of, G Strategies, a management consulting firm underneath Weber McGinn. Its goal was to advise corporations on how to develop more women leaders and make their workplaces more amenable to female employees. G Strategies subsequently became part of Golin Harris International. In , Ferraro was made {{executive vice president and}} managing director of the public affairs practice of the Global Consulting Group, an international investor relations and corporate communications component of Huntsworth. There she worked with corporations, non-profit organizations, state governments and political figures. She continued there as a senior advisor working <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> a month.|$|E
5|$|On {{the east}} coast of Florida, Klaus {{produced}} 15foot (4.5m) waves and tides of 3feet (1m) above normal. Beach erosion was reported along {{the east coast}}, due to persistent easterly winds. As the remnant moisture of Klaus entered the southeastern United States, it produced heavy rainfall between 10–15inches (250–380mm) of rainfall in South Carolina, with slightly lower totals in North Carolina. In South Carolina, the rainfall caused a dam to burst, killing four people. <b>About</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> after the remnants of Klaus entered the southeastern United States, Tropical Storm Marco made landfall on northwestern Florida, dropping more heavy rainfall and causing heavy damage across the region.|$|E
5|$|While Isabel {{was still}} over the western Atlantic Ocean as a Category 5 hurricane, forecasters {{predicted}} the storm would move northwestward and within five days be at a position 130miles (210km) east-southeast of Ocean City, Maryland as a 115mph (185km/h) major hurricane. By {{four days before}} Isabel made landfall, most computer models predicted Isabel to make landfall between North Carolina and New Jersey. On September 16, <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> before the hurricane struck land, the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch for the southern region of the Maryland coastline on the Chesapeake Bay. Later that day, a tropical storm watch was issued for the eastern Maryland coastline, which was upgraded to a tropical storm warning by about 24hours before landfall.|$|E

5|$|Flyers {{distributed}} to recruit participants said {{the attack was}} to begin at 8pmAEST on 10 February. On that day, government websites were targeted by denial-of-service attacks. The Communications Department said the hackers had not infiltrated government security, but had instead swamped government computer servers. Sites were left unavailable for sporadic periods throughout the attack. At one point, the Australian Parliament's website was offline for <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> due to the high volume of requests. Rudd's government site was also inaccessible for some time. As a primary target, the Communications Department also received {{a large amount of}} traffic. Government offices were also flooded with e-mail spam, junk faxes, and prank phone calls. The Prime Minister's homepage was vandalized with pornographic images. The flyer released before the attack called for the faxes to focus on cartoon pornography, female ejaculation, and small-breasted pornography.|$|E
5|$|For {{slow motion}} scenes like with bullets and drops of water, twin Phantom {{high-speed}} cameras were used which filmed 200 frames per second. A fight scene with Wesker and Chris in the Resident Evil 5 game was recreated shot-by-shot {{for the film}} and the Phantom cameras were used to create Wesker's superhuman speed which took <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> to film. The added size and weight of the 3D cameras meant the filmmakers {{were not able to}} use existing equipment such as Steadicam rigs. Instead the camera operator worked on a Segway to achieve the look of a Steadicam shot. Much of the action scenes were shot in front of a green screen. A 1983 Yak-52 was used throughout the film by Jovovich and Larter. Stunt pilot Martin Mattes was dressed like Jovovich and flew the plane for the camera.|$|E
5|$|Later, Mitag passed near several {{islands in}} Yap State, first {{affecting}} Woleai. On the island, high wind gusts of around 170km/h (105mph) knocked out power and downed breadfruit and coconut trees. The winds destroyed a few houses, forcing residents to evacuate {{to a local}} school. Mitag dropped heavy rainfall while passing by Yap state, peaking at 255mm (10.05in) on Ngulu Atoll. On Yap, the typhoon produced sustained winds of 56km/h (35mph), with gusts to 141km/h (87mph). The winds also caused an islandwide power outage that lasted for <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>days,</b> and damaged {{the roof of the}} Yap International Airport terminal. High waves and storm surge damaged coastal structures and flooded areas up to 150m (500ft) inland. The seawall at the capital city of Colonia was damaged, and portions of the town were flooded 1.5m (5ft) deep. The storm destroyed over 150houses on Yap, leaving hundreds staying in shelters. Across the island, the winds knocked down trees onto roads, and saltwater intrusion caused severe crop damage; most of the taro and banana crops were destroyed. Damage in the FSM totaled $150million, of which $100million from crop damage.|$|E

5|$|NASA {{maintains}} {{a catalog of}} Venus transits covering the period 2000 BCE to 4000 CE. Currently, transits occur only in June or December (see table) and the occurrence of these events slowly drifts, becoming {{later in the year}} by <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> every 243-year cycle. Transits usually occur in pairs, on nearly the same date eight years apart. This is because the length of eight Earth years is almost the same as 13 years on Venus, so every eight years the planets are in roughly the same relative positions. This approximate conjunction usually results in a pair of transits, but it is not precise enough to produce a triplet, since Venus arrives 22 hours earlier each time. The last transit not {{to be part of a}} pair was in 1396. The next will be in 3089; in 2854 (the second of the 2846/2854 pair), although Venus will just miss the Sun as seen from the Earth's equator, a partial transit will be visible from some parts of the southern hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|Some species, {{such as the}} Uruguayan Hippeastrum petiolatum, are sterile {{and unable}} to produce seeds. H. petiolatum is a sterile {{triploid}} that reproduces asexually, producing many bulbils around the mother bulb. These are light, and easily carried {{on the surface of}} water ensuring distribution of the species during the rainy season. Other species such as Hippeastrum reticulatum are self-pollinating, reproducing by distributing seed. Although this does not guarantee genetic diversity in natural populations, it is widely used by colonising species. These two examples are not however typical of the genus, which commonly reproduces through allogamy. One mechanism that limits self-pollination is that of self-incompatibility by which seeds are only produced by pollination from other plants. Furthermore, the plant generally releases its pollen <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> before its stigma is receptive, making cross-pollination more likely. Pollinators include Humming birds in subtropical areas, and moths.|$|E
5|$|The cyclone {{weakened}} {{while remaining}} nearly stationary, losing {{most of its}} deep convection due to upwelling; this is the process in which a stationary storm causes the water temperatures to decrease by bringing the cooler, deeper waters to the surface. It remained nearly stationary until beginning a steady south-southwestward motion late on February 26, a change due to an approaching mid-level trough to its south. On February 28, convection increased around a rebuilding eyewall as it accelerated southward, though on March 1 the cyclone again weakened as wind shear increased and as water temperatures gradually decreased. Gamede weakened to tropical storm status as its center became exposed from the deep convection, and late on March 1 it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. After completing the transition, the storm became nearly stationary for <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>days,</b> during which its winds decreased to below gale force. The remnants of Gamede turned westward and persisted until dissipating on March 6.|$|E

5|$|The exact {{death toll}} was unknown, but {{believed}} to be several hundred. <b>About</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> after the storm, the official death toll was more than 80. By {{three days after the}} storm, the toll rose to 190, and by four days after it made landfall, the official total was 290deaths; officials estimated the toll could have exceeded 500. Due to downed communications, reports of storm fatalities were slow to spread, though news became more rapid as links were repaired. On November19, a week after the storm struck, the Mexican Army set the final death toll at 436deaths, with 300missing; the death toll was later reported by the United States Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance in 1993. Overall, Hurricane Tara was the deadliest disaster in 1961, as well as the third deadliest Mexico Pacific hurricane on record, after a hurricane in 1959 and Hurricane Liza in 1976.|$|E
5|$|The {{tropical}} depression continued drifting north-northeastward, {{and failed to}} strengthen significantly. It turned to the west on December 1, due {{to the presence of}} a strong anticyclone to its north with a ridge extending westward past the International Date Line. On December 2, based on satellite estimates, the CPHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Paka while located about 1000km (625mi) south-southeast of Johnston Atoll. Due to the presence of high clouds across the area, forecasters had difficulty at times in locating the low-level circulation. After becoming a tropical storm, Paka remained nearly stationary for <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> before resuming a slow motion to the west-southwest. It steadily intensified due to warm water temperatures, and on December 3 the storm attained winds of 105km/h (65mph). The next day, however, it encountered dry air and began weakening; by December 6, the winds had decreased to minimal tropical storm status for about 12hours. Subsequently, Paka began to re-intensify, and on December 7 the storm crossed the International Date Line into the western North Pacific Ocean with winds of 80km/h (50mph).|$|E
5|$|By <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> {{after the}} passage of Hurricane Wilma, 800residents on Grand Bahama {{remained}} in shelters, including 65 families who lost their homes and stayed in a hotel set up as a government shelter in Freeport. On Bimini, most residents who evacuated to shelters returned to their homes within two days of the hurricane. The Bahamian Red Cross quickly assessed the damage on Grand Bahama and Bimini, and successfully requested to be included under the federation's hurricane appeal for Central America. Local Red Cross chapters mobilized all available resources to assist the residents most affected. The Bahamian Red Cross began a three-month program to distribute food and other items to 1,000 of the 3,500affected families, primarily on Grand Bahama; the remaining 2,500families received assistance from the government and other organizations. Volunteers delivered building materials and provided water vouchers to those affected. In Nassau, the Red Cross disaster contingency stock sent a boat with food items, blankets, health kits, tarpaulins and water. About a week after the hurricane, the United States Agency for International Development began providing $50,000 (2005USD) to the Bahamian National Emergency Management Agency for the purchase and distribution of emergency supplies. The agency also provided $9,000 (2005USD) for locally contracted helicopter assessments in the affected areas. Red Cross agencies throughout the Caribbean Sea provided hygienic kits, plastic sheeting, blankets, and jerry cans.|$|E

5|$|The Aniplex {{producer}} of Angel Beats!, Hironori Toba, was interviewed in the November 2009 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine, where he commented that a 13-episode anime with about 21 minutes per episode {{was not enough}} to tell the whole story of Angel Beats! Maeda had envisioned. Therefore, the various additional media, such as the illustrated short stories and manga, contain some of the story that was unable to make it into the anime because of time constraints. Toba wanted fans of the series to be able to enjoy it to the fullest by exploring all of the media types. Maeda found it tiring to go back and forth between Osaka and Tokyo for business meetings {{when he was in the}} process of writing the script, and found it difficult to write an entire script by himself, since he had never done that before with any of the games he produced as a member of Key. It was only after the script was done that Maeda was able to work on the music, which he greatly enjoyed and never tired of it. Maeda composed about 15 songs for Girls Dead Monster and spent <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> each composing each song. He made sure to create songs for Girls Dead Monster that high school girls would compose, including the lyrics. Due to this, Maeda pointed out that the opening and ending theme songs for Angel Beats!, which Maeda also composed, sound like they were composed by a different person compared to the Girls Dead Monster songs.|$|E
5|$|The floodwaters {{from the}} {{hurricane}} combined with raw sewage in many poor areas of southwestern Mexico, {{leading to a}} widespread threat for a spread of tropical diseases. As a result, government health workers opened vaccination centers in several cities along the Guerrero and Oaxaca coasts. Thousands were inoculated for typhoid fever and tetanus. Officials noted a potential threat for dengue and cholera {{as a result of}} the spoiled water. Health workers also stated mosquitos possessing malaria and dengue fever were likely to breed in large areas of leftover water. In Acapulco, <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> after the hurricane passed, the first day of sun in a week evaporated the areas of leftover water, spreading dust across the region with the deadly diseases. Residents were warned to boil their food and water for 30minutes due to the threat for contamination by the dust. At least twenty cases of cholera and at least six cases of dengue fever were reported. Most significantly, there were 14,630cases of malaria in 616villages in Oaxaca due to Pauline; this represented about 80% of the malaria cases in Mexico during 1998. Army soldiers distributed chlorine tablets to disinfect water pools and wheelbarrows to remove rotting mud and sewage from their damaged homes.
