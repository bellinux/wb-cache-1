5|$|Until the Parliament Act 1911, {{there was}} no way to resolve contradictions between the two houses of {{parliament}} except through the creation of additional peers by the monarch. Queen Anne had created 12 Tory peers to vote through the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. The Reform Act 1832 was passed when the House of Lords dropped opposition—William IV had threatened to create 80 new peers by request of the prime minister, Earl Grey—creating an informal convention that the Lords would give way when the public was behind the House of Commons. For example, Irish disestablishment, which had been a major bone of contention between the two main parties since the 1830s, was—following intervention by the queen—passed by the Lords in 1869 <b>after</b> <b>W.E.</b> Gladstone won the 1868 election on the issue. However, in practice, this gave the Lords a right to demand that such public support be present and to decide the timing of a general election.|$|E
5|$|Veronica waits with Keith at an {{election}} party, where tensions are high {{due to the}} election being extremely close. Sheriff Lamb (Michael Muhney) is nosing ahead before a man walks up to Lamb and says that he made the anonymous call from the bridge where Felix Toombs was stabbed. Keith loses the election {{by a margin of}} 51% to 49%. <b>After</b> <b>we</b> learn that Woody Goodman (Steve Guttenberg) has been elected mayor, Dick Casablancas (Ryan Hansen) hits on Gia Goodman (Krysten Ritter). Officers come in and arrest Logan for the murder of Felix Toombs before Veronica goes home and finds Abel Koontz, who is in the latter stages of stomach cancer. He asks her to help him find his daughter, Amelia, who has disappeared, and Veronica agrees. Veronica talks to Amelia's old boyfriend, who has not seen her for a while; Amelia ditched the boyfriend in Europe. Cliff McCormack (Daran Norris) is appointed to be Logan's lawyer before Veronica asks Cliff to call the numbers on the phone cards that Amelia stole under an alias. Cliff tells Logan that he should get a different lawyer. Veronica finds out that Amelia called from Neptune (Veronica's town) the previous week. Logan is placed in a cell with his father, Aaron (Harry Hamlin), who is temporarily being held there before his trial for the murder of Lilly Kane. Logan receives bail, but Weevil and his friends are angry about this fact. Veronica breaks into Clarence Wiedman's (Christopher B. Duncan) office, but he denies any knowledge of the situation.|$|E

If we can't accomplish these two things then life, according to my view, has been a failure. Many people erroneously speak of a man when he is gone as having left so much money. That, according to my view, amounts to very little.|$|E

His paranoia was most evident when he dined in company. He always thought he was served much smaller portions than everyone else. He didn't care about the actual amount but only about the imagined affront. I once suggested that he and I order what the other actually wanted and, when the food was served, exchange plates. <b>After</b> <b>we</b> had done so, {{he shook his head}} in disbelief, still thinking that he had received the smaller portion.|$|E

And again, so soon as I had been baptized by him, I also had the spirit of prophecy, when, standing up, I prophesied concerning the rise of this Church, and many other things connected with the Church, and this generation of the children of men. We were filled with the Holy Ghost, and rejoiced in the God of our salvation.|$|E

These days, I am with a young man that I had known in Brussels. We do not separate from each other. We were both survivors of the camps.

It seems that <b>after</b> <b>we</b> left the school, Miss Wallace, Mr. Chambers, and a young Armenian preacher attempted to cross the street from Miss Wallace's to the school. Just at this time a mob rushed around the corner. The infuriated Turks recognized the preacher as an Armenian, and although Mr. Chambers threw his arms about him and did all in his power to save the man's life, they shot him dead. Not a single Armenian would they leave alive, the assassins shouted, as Mr. Chambers dragged the murdered preacher into the building.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} vernacular children's {{songs in}} Europe are lullabies from the later medieval period. From soon <b>after</b> <b>we</b> have records of short children's rhyming songs, but most nursery rhymes were not written down until the 18th century. The first English collections were Tommy Thumb's Song Book and a sequel, Tommy Thumb's Pretty Song Book, are both {{thought to have}} been published before 1744, and John Newbery's, Mother Goose's Melody, or, Sonnets for the Cradle (c.1785), is the first record we have of many classic rhymes. These rhymes seem to have come from a variety of sources, including traditional riddles, proverbs, ballads, lines of Mummers' plays, drinking songs, historical events, and, it has been suggested, ancient pagan rituals. Roughly half of the current body recognised 'traditional' English rhymes were known by the mid-18th century. From this period we sometimes know the origins and authors of rhymes, like 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star', which combined an 18th-century French tune with a poem by English writer Jane Taylor and 'Mary Had a Little Lamb', written by Sarah Josepha Hale of Boston in 1830. The first, and possibly the most important collection to focus in this area was, James Orchard Halliwell's, The Nursery Rhymes of England (1842) and Popular Rhymes and Tales in 1849. At the height of the revival Sabine Baring-Gould produced A Book of Nursery Songs (1895), and Andrew Lang produced The Nursery Rhyme Book in 1897. Children's songs, unlike folk songs, have remained part of a living and continuous tradition, for although added to from other sources and affected by written versions, most adults pass on songs they learned from oral sources as children.|$|E
