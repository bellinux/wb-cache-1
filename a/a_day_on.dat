In the second season, all eight were Canadians who had competed in major diving competitions. Their schedule was six shows <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>on</b> every other day. The dive is 58 feet, and the pool is 13 feet deep in the centre and only 7 feet deep at the edges. At {{the end of the}} dive, they were descending at 40 miles per hour.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, his cocaine {{addiction}} intensified. Jennings {{claimed to have}} spent $1,500 <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>on</b> his habit, draining his personal finances and leaving him bankrupt with debt up to $2.5million. Though he insisted on repaying the debt and did additional tours to earn the funds, his work became less focused and his tours deteriorated. Jennings decided to quit his addictions, leased {{a home in the}} Phoenix area, and spent a month detoxing himself, intending to start using cocaine again in a more controlled fashion afterward. In 1984, he quit cocaine. Jennings claimed that his son Shooter was his main inspiration to quit permanently.|$|E

5|$|Ginsburg was {{diagnosed}} with colon cancer in 1999 and underwent surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

Since 1999, Bryant Johnson, a former Army reservist attached to the Special Forces, has trained Ginsburg twice weekly in the justices-only gym at the Supreme Court. In spite of her small stature, Ginsburg saw her physical fitness improve since her first bout with cancer, being able to complete twenty full push-ups in a session before her 80th birthday.|$|E

5|$|The December 2000 {{opening of}} the final five Green Line {{stations}} (Branch Avenue, Suitland, Naylor Road, Southern Avenue, and Congress Heights) significantly worsened overcrowding and service problems on the Green Line. The five new stations added almost 20,000 new riders a day, overwhelming station platforms, jamming trains to capacity, and forcing many riders at Anacostia and other stations up the line to wait as train after train passed them filled. Metro had estimated that 18,000 riders a day would board from these stations by June 2001. That estimate was exceeded by 2,000 riders <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>on</b> the second day the stations were open.|$|E

5|$|The {{calendar}} for the ELCA {{is similar}} to many other Western Calendars in {{that it does not}} commemorate any persons from the Old Testament.

At one point there was a proposal to include <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>on</b> the Episcopal Church calendar (which was taken into consideration by the Inter-Lutheran Commission on Worship in developing the Lutheran Book of Worship) for Old Testament saints following the octave of All Saints (November 8), but this idea was ultimately rejected as tokenism.|$|E
5|$|The largest bores occur {{around the}} times of the {{equinoxes}} but smaller ones can be seen throughout the year. There are about 260 bores in each year occurring twice <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>on</b> 130 days. Because the bores {{are associated with the}} phases of the moon, one occurs between 7 a.m. and noon on bore days, and the other between 7 p.m. and midnight GMT, with the largest bores occurring between 9 and 11 in both the morning and evening. Maximum bores occur between one and three days after new and full moons, and smaller ones on the days that precede and follow the maxima.|$|E

5|$|Also on November 28, 2006, a 14-disc DVD box set titled Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition was released, {{containing}} Superman, Superman II, , Superman III, Superman IV, Superman Returns, and , {{among other}} releases. All {{contents of the}} set were housed within a tin case. The set was valued at US$99.92, and received extremely positive reviews when first released. However, after only <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>on</b> the market, Warner Bros. announced {{that there were two}} errors discovered within the set. The first was that the 2.0 audio track on Superman, was instead the 5.1 audio track already on the disc. The second was that the Superman III disc was not the 2006 deluxe edition as advertised, but the 2001 release instead. The set was soon recalled, and Warner Bros. offered a toll-free number to replace the faulty discs for people who had already purchased the set. Due to popular demand, a corrected set was released and Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition returned to store shelves on May 29, 2007.|$|E
