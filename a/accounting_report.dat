40|$|In the {{accounting}} industry, {{there is an}} increasing trend for companies to prepare sustainability <b>accounting</b> <b>reports,</b> not only financial reports, to fulfill the needs of stakeholders. Financial reports present financial information about a company’s financial performance and follow generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which are adhered to by {{the accounting}} profession. Sustainability <b>accounting</b> <b>reports</b> present information about three main topics – profit, planet, and people; however, there are currently no standards or regulations like GAAP for sustainability <b>accounting</b> <b>reports</b> to follow. Currently there are no standards or regulations from Financial Accounting Standards Board, International Accounting Standards Board, or U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission offering standards for the preparation of sustainability <b>accounting</b> <b>reports.</b> Further, companies {{are not required to}} <b>report</b> on sustainability <b>accounting</b> matters, although many do so voluntarily.

Thus, uniform guidelines/standards and assurances are needed for sustainability <b>accounting</b> <b>reports.</b> This paper begins with an explanation of what sustainability <b>accounting</b> <b>reporting</b> is and why this type of reporting is necessary for companies.

40|$|The {{central focus}} {{of this paper is}} on how the quality of {{anticipated}} mandatory <b>accounting</b> <b>reports</b> affects the bias in and likelihood of voluntary management disclosures. Our model integrates two paradigms used to analyze management disclosures, those in which managers choose to disclose or not when disclosures must be truthful, and those in which managers choose the extent of bias when disclosures always occur. Thus, we incorporate both proprietary (firm-wide) costs of disclosures and personal costs of biasing. In our model, the manager endogenously determines both whether to disclose and, if disclosure occurs, how much to bias the disclosure. We find that increases in the quality of mandatory <b>accounting</b> <b>reports</b> decrease the bias in management disclosures because investors rely relatively less on the disclosures in determining the firm’s value. Further, as the quality of <b>accounting</b> <b>reports</b> increases, the probability of management disclosures also increases because the cost to the manager of biasing the disclosures decreases. Finally, we show that the manager may prefer low to high quality mandatory <b>accounting</b> <b>reports</b> when the proprietary costs of disclosures are large or the manager’s stock-based incentives are large relative to the personal cost of biasing...|$|R
