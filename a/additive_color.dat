25|$|The RGB color {{model is}} an <b>additive</b> <b>color</b> {{model in which}} red, green and blue light are added {{together}} in various ways to reproduce {{a broad array of}} colors. The name of the model comes from the initials of the three additive primary colors, red, green, and blue.|$|E

25|$|Red, green, {{and blue}} light are the ideal {{primaries}} for <b>additive</b> <b>color</b> mixing since primary lights with those hues provide the largest triangular chromaticity gamuts. Small red, green, and blue elements in electronic displays mix additively {{in the eye}} at an appropriate viewing distance to synthesize compelling colored images.|$|E
25|$|The first color {{cinematography}} was by <b>additive</b> <b>color</b> {{systems such}} as the one patented by Edward Raymond Turner in 1899 and tested in 1902. A simplified additive system was successfully commercialized in 1909 as Kinemacolor. These early systems used black-and-white film to photograph and project two or more component images through different color filters.|$|E
25|$|By their nature, these {{additive}} {{systems were}} very wasteful of light. Absorption {{by the color}} filters involved meant that only a minor fraction of the projection light actually reached the screen, resulting in an image that was dimmer than a typical black-and-white image. The larger the screen, the dimmer the picture. For this and other case-by-case reasons, the use of additive processes for theatrical motion pictures had been almost completely abandoned by the early 1940s, though <b>additive</b> <b>color</b> methods are employed by all the color video and computer display systems in common use today.|$|E
40|$|This paper studies optimal {{tracking}} performance {{issues for}} multi-input-multi-output linear time-invariant systems under networked control with limited bandwidth and <b>additive</b> <b>colored</b> white Gaussian noise channel. The tracking performance {{is measured by}} control input energy and {{the energy of the}} error signal between the output of the system and the reference signal with respect to a Brownian motion random process. This paper focuses on two kinds of network parameters, the basic network parameter-bandwidth and the <b>additive</b> <b>colored</b> white Gaussian noise, and studies the tracking performance limitation problem. The best attainable tracking performance is obtained, and the impact of limited bandwidth and <b>additive</b> <b>colored</b> white Gaussian noise of the communication channel on the attainable tracking performance is revealed. It is shown that the optimal tracking performance depends on nonminimum phase zeros, gain at all frequencies and their directions unitary vector of the given plant, as well as the limited bandwidth and <b>additive</b> <b>colored</b> white Gaussian noise of the communication channel. The simulation results are finally given to illustrate the theoretical results. Comment: 10 pages, 4 figures, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Paper...|$|R

50|$|At {{about the}} same time as Young {{discovered}} <b>additive</b> <b>colors,</b> another British scientist, David Brewster (1781-1868), the inventor of the kaleidoscope, proposed a competing theory that the true primary colors were red, yellow, and blue, and that the true complementary pairs were red-green, blue-orange, and yellow-purple. Then a German scientist, Hermann von Helmholtz, (1821-1894), resolved the debate by showing that colors formed by light, <b>additive</b> <b>colors,</b> and those formed by pigments, subtractive colors, did in fact operate by different rules, and had different primary and complementary colors.|$|R
25|$|Each photographed color component, {{initially}} just a colorless {{record of}} the luminous intensities {{in the part of}} the spectrum that it captured, is processed to produce a transparent dye image in the color complementary to the color of the light that it recorded. The superimposed dye images combine to synthesize the original colors by the subtractive color method. In some early color processes (e.g., Kinemacolor), the component images remained in black-and-white form and were projected through color filters to synthesize the original colors by the <b>additive</b> <b>color</b> method.|$|E
25|$|A {{color space}} maps {{a range of}} {{physically}} produced colors from mixed light, pigments, etc. to an objective description of color sensations registered in the human eye, typically in terms of tristimulus values, but not usually in the LMS color space defined by the spectral sensitivities of the cone cells. The tristimulus values associated with a color space can be conceptualized as amounts of three primary colors in a tri-chromatic, <b>additive</b> <b>color</b> model. In some color spaces, including the LMS and XYZ spaces, the primary colors used are not real colors {{in the sense that}} they cannot be generated in any light spectrum.|$|E
25|$|Autochrome, {{the first}} commercially {{successful}} color process, {{was introduced by}} the Lumière brothers in 1907. Autochrome plates incorporated a mosaic color filter layer made of dyed grains of potato starch, which allowed the three color components to be recorded as adjacent microscopic image fragments. After an Autochrome plate was reversal processed to produce a positive transparency, the starch grains served to illuminate each fragment with the correct color and the tiny colored points blended together in the eye, synthesizing {{the color of the}} subject by the additive method. Autochrome plates were one of several varieties of <b>additive</b> <b>color</b> screen plates and films marketed between the 1890s and the 1950s.|$|E

40|$|An <b>additive</b> <b>coloring</b> of a graph G is an {{assignment}} of positive integers { 1, 2, [...] .,k} to the vertices of G such {{that for every}} two adjacent vertices the sums of numbers assigned to their neighbors are different. The minimum number k for which there exists an <b>additive</b> <b>coloring</b> of G is denoted by η (G). We prove that η (G) ≤ 468 for every planar graph G. This improves a previous bound η (G) ≤ 5544 due to Norin. The proof uses Combinatorial Nullstellensatz and coloring number of planar hypergrahs. We also demonstrate that η (G) ≤ 36 for 3 -colorable planar graphs, and η (G) ≤ 4 for every planar graph of girth at least 13. In a group theoretic version of the problem we show that for each r≥ 2 there is an r-chromatic graph G_r with no <b>additive</b> <b>coloring</b> by elements of any Abelian group of order r...|$|R

25|$|The {{method of}} color {{photography}} used by Prokudin-Gorsky was first suggested by James Clerk Maxwell in 1855 and demonstrated in 1861, but good results were not {{possible with the}} photographic materials available at that time. In imitation of the way a normal human eye senses color, the visible spectrum of colors was divided into three channels of information by capturing it {{in the form of}} three black-and-white photographs, one taken through a red filter, one through a green filter, and one through a blue filter. The resulting three photographs could either be projected through filters of the same colors and exactly superimposed on a screen, synthesizing the original range of color additively; viewed as an <b>additive</b> <b>color</b> image by {{one person at a time}} through an optical device known generically as a chromoscope or photochromoscope, which contained colored filters and transparent reflectors that visually combined the three into one full-color image; or used to make photographic or mechanical prints in the complementary colors cyan, magenta and yellow, which, when superimposed, reconstituted the color subtractively.|$|E
500|$|In <b>additive</b> <b>color</b> {{devices such}} as {{computer}} displays and televisions, {{one of the primary}} light sources is typically a narrow-spectrum yellowish-green of dominant wavelength ~550nm; this [...] "green" [...] primary is combined with an orangish-red [...] "red" [...] primary and a purplish-blue [...] "blue" [...] primary to produce any color in betweenthe RGB color model. A unique green (green appearing neither yellowish nor bluish) is produced on such a device by mixing light from the green primary with some light from the blue primary.|$|E
500|$|The {{system of}} {{attraction}} and repulsion between quarks charged with {{different combinations of}} the three colors is called strong interaction, which is mediated by force carrying particles known as gluons; this is discussed at length below. The theory that describes strong interactions is called quantum chromodynamics (QCD). A quark, which will have a single color value, can form a bound system with an antiquark carrying the corresponding anticolor. The result of two attracting quarks will be color neutrality: a quark with color charge ξ plus an antiquark with color charge −ξ {{will result in a}} color charge of 0 (or [...] "white" [...] color) and the formation of a meson. This is analogous to the <b>additive</b> <b>color</b> model in basic optics. Similarly, the combination of three quarks, each with different color charges, or three antiquarks, each with anticolor charges, will result in the same [...] "white" [...] color charge and the formation of a baryon or antibaryon.|$|E
5000|$|A color {{wheel is}} a tool that {{provides}} a visual representation {{of the relationships between}} all possible hues. The primary colors are arranged around a circle at equal (120 degree) intervals. (Warning: Color wheels frequently depict [...] "Painter's Colors" [...] primary colors, which leads to a different set of hues than <b>additive</b> <b>colors.)</b> The illustration shows a simple color wheel based on the <b>additive</b> <b>colors.</b> Note that the position (top, right) of the starting color, typically red, is arbitrary, as is the order of green and blue (clockwise, counter-clockwise). The illustration also shows the secondary colors, yellow, cyan, and magenta, located halfway between (60 degrees) the primary colors.|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} paper is to develop an efficient approach to clear the false peaks based on cross-high-order spectral QR decomposition approach. Simulation results indicate that spectral density curve is smooth without false peaks existence. The methods have better in resolving power and performance than previous MUSIC approach.

2500|$|The first color {{systems that}} {{appeared}} in motion pictures were <b>additive</b> <b>color</b> systems. [...] <b>Additive</b> <b>color</b> was practical because no special color stock was necessary. [...] Black-and-white film could be processed and used in both filming and projection. [...] The various additive systems entailed the use of color filters on both the movie camera and projector. [...] <b>Additive</b> <b>color</b> adds lights of the primary colors in various proportions to the projected image. [...] Because of the limited amount of space to record images on film, and later because {{the lack of a}} camera that could record more than two strips of film at once, most early motion-picture color systems consisted of two colors, often red and green or red and blue.|$|E
2500|$|William Friese-Greene invented another <b>additive</b> <b>color</b> {{system called}} Biocolour, which was {{developed}} by his son Claude Friese-Greene after William's death in 1921. [...] William sued George Albert Smith, alleging that the Kinemacolor process infringed on the patents for his Bioschemes, Ltd.; as a result, Smith's patent was revoked in 1914. [...] Both Kinemacolor and Biocolour had problems with [...] "fringing" [...] or [...] "haloing" [...] of the image, due to the separate red and green images not fully matching up.|$|E
2500|$|In <b>additive</b> <b>color</b> mixing, {{the total}} light present {{is simply the}} sum of {{individual}} light sources. For example, coincident blue and red spotlights on a surface will make a purple, brighter than either of the spotlights alone. Additive mixing of coincident spot lights was applied in the experiments used to derive the CIE 1931 [...] colorspace. The original monochromatic primaries of the (arbitrary) wavelengths of 435.8nm (violet), 546.1nm (green) and 700nm (red) were used in this application due to the convenience they afforded to the experimental work.|$|E
5000|$|First, [...] "color" [...] {{refers to}} the human brain's {{subjective}} interpretation of combinations of a narrow band of wavelengths of light. For this reason, the definition of [...] "color" [...] {{is not based on}} a strict set of physical phenomena. Therefore, even basic concepts like [...] "primary colors" [...] are not clearly defined. For example, traditional [...] "Painter's Colors" [...] use red, blue, and yellow as the primary colors, [...] "Printer's Colors" [...] use cyan, yellow, and magenta, and [...] "Light Colors" [...] use red, green, and blue. [...] "Light colors", more formally known as <b>additive</b> <b>colors,</b> are formed by combining red, green, and blue light. This article refers to <b>additive</b> <b>colors</b> and refers to red, green, and blue as the primary colors.|$|R
5000|$|Hue {{is a term}} {{describing}} a pure color, that is, a color not modified by tinting or shading (see below).

2500|$|Most {{wavelengths}} stimulate two or {{all three}} kinds of cone cell because the spectral sensitivity curves of the three kinds overlap. Certain tristimulus values are thus physically impossible, for example LMS tristimulus values that are non-zero for the M component and zero for both the L and S components. Furthermore, LMS tristimulus values for pure spectral colors would, in any normal trichromatic <b>additive</b> <b>color</b> space, e. g. the RGB color spaces, imply negative values {{for at least one}} of the three primaries because the chromaticity would be outside the color triangle defined by the primary colors. To avoid these negative RGB values, and to have one component that describes the perceived brightness, [...] "imaginary" [...] primary colors and corresponding color-matching functions were formulated. The CIE 1931 color space defines the resulting tristimulus values, in which they are denoted by [...] "X", [...] "Y", and [...] "Z". In XYZ space, all combinations of non-negative coordinates are meaningful, but many, such as the primary locations , , and , correspond to imaginary colors outside the space of possible LMS coordinates; imaginary colors do not correspond to any spectral distribution of wavelengths and therefore have no physical reality.|$|E
