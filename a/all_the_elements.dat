5|$|For example, the {{stability}} and low energy of the electron cloud state in helium accounts for the element's chemical inertness, and also the lack of interaction of helium atoms with each other, producing the lowest melting and boiling points of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>elements.</b>|$|E
5|$|Helium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol He and atomic number 2. It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert, monatomic gas, {{the first in}} the noble gas group in the periodic table. Its boiling point is the lowest among <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>elements.</b>|$|E

40|$|A set is {{precisely}} defined. A given element either belongs {{or not to}} a set. However, since <b>all</b> of <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> being considered belong to the universe, if <b>the</b> <b>element</b> {{does not belong to}} the set, it belongs to its complement, that is, what remains after <b>all</b> of <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> from <b>the</b> set are removed from the universe...|$|R

5|$|Californium is a {{radioactive}} {{chemical element}} with symbol Cf and atomic number98. The element was first synthesized in 1950 at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (then the University of California Radiation Laboratory), by bombarding curium with alpha particles (helium-4 ions). It is an actinide element, the sixth transuranium element to be synthesized, {{and has the}} second-highest atomic mass of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> that have been produced in amounts large enough to see {{with the unaided eye}} (after einsteinium). The element was named after the university and the state of California.|$|E
5|$|Darmstadtium is {{the eighth}} {{member of the}} 6d series of {{transition}} metals. Since copernicium (element 112) {{has been shown to}} be a transition metal, it is expected that <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> from 104 to 112 would continue a fourth transition metal series, with darmstadtium as part of the platinum group metals and a noble metal. Calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter homologue platinum, thus implying that darmstadtium's basic properties will resemble those of the other group 10 elements, nickel, palladium, and platinum.|$|E
5|$|During {{his student}} days, Gaudí {{attended}} craft workshops, {{such as those}} taught by Eudald Puntí, Llorenç Matamala and Joan Oñós, where he learned the basic aspects of techniques relating to architecture, including sculpture, carpentry, wrought ironwork, stained glass, ceramics, plaster modelling, etc. He also absorbed new technological developments, integrating into his technique the use of iron and reinforced concrete in construction. Gaudí took a broad view of architecture as a multifunctional design, in which every single detail in an arrangement has to be harmoniously made and well-proportioned. This knowledge allowed him to design architectural projects, including <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> of his works, from furnishings to illumination to wrought ironwork.|$|E

It is a dish incorporating <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> of Palestinian land, such as bread, laban (yogurt) soup, rice, nuts (pine nuts), parsley and lamb, making it an important cultural dish. The meal is oftentimes served the traditional way in a large common plate, a sidr. The meal is usually eaten {{without the use of}} tableware, but rather each person sits beside each other eating from the same large plate.|$|E
5|$|Meitnerium is {{the seventh}} {{member of the}} 6d series of {{transition}} metals. Since element 112 (copernicium) {{has been shown to}} be a transition metal, it is expected that <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> from 104 to 112 would continue a fourth transition metal series, with meitnerium as part of the platinum group metals. Calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter homologue iridium, thus implying that meitnerium's basic properties will resemble those of the other group 9 elements, cobalt, rhodium, and iridium.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{chemistry}} {{has been observed}} only {{for the first three}} members of the group. The chemistry of rutherfordium is not very established and therefore the rest of the section deals only with titanium, zirconium, and hafnium. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> of the group are reactive metals with a high melting point (1668°C, 1855°C, 2233°C, 2100°C?). The reactivity is not always obvious due to the rapid formation of a stable oxide layer, which prevents further reactions. The oxides TiO2, ZrO2 and HfO2 are white solids with high melting points and unreactive against most acids.|$|E

Calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter homologue gold, thus implying that roentgenium's basic properties will resemble those of the other group 11 elements, copper, silver, and gold; however, it is also predicted to show several differences from its lighter homologues.|$|E
5|$|Scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, and {{lutetium}} tend {{to occur}} {{together with the}} other lanthanides (except promethium) tend to occur together in the Earth's crust, and are often harder to extract from their ores. The abundance of elements in Earth's crust for group 3 is quite low — <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> in the group are uncommon, the most abundant being yttrium with abundance of approximately 30parts per million (ppm); the abundance of scandium is 16ppm, while that of lutetium is about 0.5ppm. The abundance of lanthanum is greater, being about 35ppm. For comparison, the abundance of copper is 50ppm, that of chromium is 160ppm, and that of molybdenum is 1.5ppm.|$|E

5|$|The free {{element is}} {{remarkable}} for its robustness, especially {{the fact that}} it has the highest melting point of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> discovered, melting at 3422°C (6192°F, 3695K). It also has the second highest boiling point, at 5930°C (10706°F, 6203K). Its density is 19.3 times that of water, comparable to that of uranium and gold, and much higher (about 1.7 times) than that of lead. Polycrystalline tungsten is an intrinsically brittle and hard material (under standard conditions, when uncombined), making it difficult to work. However, pure single-crystalline tungsten is more ductile, and can be cut with a hard-steel hacksaw.|$|E

Parsons, who had {{developed}} the proximity fuze for the Navy, ran the division, and handled liaison with other agencies. As {{the head of}} the E-6 Projectile, Target, and Source Group, Critchfield calculated critical masses, and instituted a system of live testing with scale models using 20 mm cannon and 3-inch guns. While full-scale Thin Man tubes took months to produce, these were readily and easily obtained. It was not possible to conduct tests with plutonium, as it was not yet available. Indeed, the actual physical characteristics of the metal were little more than educated guesses at this time.|$|E
