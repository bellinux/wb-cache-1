25|$|Even in {{the most}} formal contexts, BP never uses the {{contracted}} combinations of direct and indirect object pronouns which are sometimes used in EP, such <b>as</b> <b>me</b> + o = mo, lhe + as = lhas. Instead, the indirect clitic is replaced by preposition + strong pronoun: thus BP writes ela o deu para mim ("she gave it to me") instead of EP ela deu-mo; the latter most probably will not be understood by Brazilians, being obsolete in BP.|$|E
25|$|The Mafia boss Uncle Enzo {{begins to}} take a {{paternal}} interest in Y.T. Impressed by her attitude and initiative, he arranges to meet her and offers her freelance jobs. Hiro's investigations and Y.T.'s intelligence gathering begin to coincide, with links between the neuro-linguistic viruses, a religious organization known as Reverend Wayne's Pearly Gates and a media magnate named L. Bob Rife beginning to emerge. Juanita's research showed that the ancient Sumerian ur-language allowed brain function to be 'programmed' using audio stimuli {{in conjunction with a}} DNA altering virus. Sumerian culture was organized around these programs (known <b>as</b> <b>me)</b> which were administered by priests to the populace. Enki, a figure of legend, developed a counter-virus (known as the nam-shub of Enki) which when delivered stopped the Sumerian language from being processed by the brain and {{led to the development of}} other, less literal languages, giving birth to the Babel myth. L. Bob Rife had been collecting Sumerian artifacts and developed the drug Snow Crash in order to make the public vulnerable to new forms of me which he would control. The physical form of the virus is distributed in the form of an addictive drug and within Reverend Wayne's church via infected blood. There is also a digital version to which hackers are especially vulnerable as they are accustomed to processing information in binary form.|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of the German-led Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia, Uskok, Četnik and the eight Orjen-class boats were part of the JKRM's 2nd Torpedo Division in Šibenik. They were soon captured by Italian forces and commissioned in the Regia Marina (Royal Navy) as MAS 1 D and MAS 2 D, with [...] "MAS" [...] standing for Motoscafo Armato Silurante (...) and the prefix D denoting they were captured in Dalmatia. Due to their age and poor condition, they were only used for patrol and second-line duties. MAS 1 D was lost on 19 April 1942 near the island of Mljet after the rivets in her hull plating failed, and she sprang a leak and sank. MAS 2 D was redesignated MS 47 in July 1942, before being stricken from the MTB list on 1 September 1943 and declassed <b>as</b> <b>ME</b> 43. After the war she was found in Taranto in a [...] "very bad shape", and she was eventually broken up in the early 1950s.|$|E
500|$|The game is {{generally}} known for fixing problems {{found in the}} first game, including improvements such as allowing parties of three characters, having a larger world, better graphics, {{and the ability to}} carry more items. Other noted improvements were keys that can be used multiple times and new strategic elements introduced because of larger parties and larger groups of enemies. The game's music is often praised, despite its limited 8-bit capabilities. Considered a classic for the RPG genre, the game is regarded as praiseworthy. Japanese reviews highlighted the Famicom version's difficulty, stemming from issues such as the many traps in the Cave of Rhone, and the final boss's ability to cast a [...] "Healall" [...] spell, and this has led to some critics calling the game [...] "the most difficult Dragon Quest". After Dragon Quest III released, director Koichi Nakamura said [...] "In result, Dragon Quest II received favourable from everybody, but <b>as</b> <b>me</b> creator's side, I feel that I did about only half what I wanted to do." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} Thunder, later named [...] "Thunder, Sr.", {{was described}} as bold and courageous. [...] He was a stallion registered as JB Kobask, a former show horse, who was team mascot for the Broncos from 1993 {{until his retirement in}} 2004. [...] He continued making community appearances until his death in 2009. [...] Thunder, Sr. was succeeded in 2004 by [...] "Thunder II", an Arabian gelding registered as Winter Solstyce. [...] He had been the personal pleasure riding horse of Magness-Blake. [...] Judge described him as being somewhat timid when he first began his role as mascot but eventually grew into it. [...] He retired from mascot duties in early 2014 but appeared in the 2016 Super Bowl 50 victory parade in downtown Denver following the Broncos win over the Carolina Panthers. [...] "Thunder III", a gelding registered <b>as</b> <b>Me</b> N Myshadow, was the understudy to Thunder II, and trained specifically for mascot duties beginning at age three when he was started under saddle. He began performing at preseason games in 2013. Although Thunder II was still active as team mascot during the 2013–14 season, Thunder III was sent to Super Bowl XLVIII because he was younger and better able to handle air travel. [...] He is described as laid-back, preferring to doze off during games when not performing.|$|E

500|$|Long an {{advocate}} for gender equality in climbing, Hill has argued {{that men and women}} can climb the same routes: [...] "I think they should have women compete on the same climbs as the men, and if the women can't do the climbs, then they shouldn't be competing". For example, she argued that both sexes compete on the same routes in World Cup competitions. However, Hill later revised her view, noting that while she could and did compete with men [...] "spectators want to see people get to the top. And since most women aren't climbing at the same level as the top men, it's necessary to design a route that's a little easier for women". In answer to a question about whether or not women [...] "will ever equal or surpass men in climbing", Hill gave a detailed response, focused on body composition, size, and psychology, explaining that climbing [...] "favors people with high strength-to-weight ratios", less body fat, and greater height, articulating that such characteristics often favor men but that women [...] "have the advantage of being relatively light, with the capacity for tremendous endurance". She explained that [...] "theoretically somebody as short <b>as</b> <b>me</b> could be {{the best in the world}} because it doesn't depend so much on height now... And it's a psychological thing more than a physical thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Cross was {{involved}} in coordinating {{the reconstruction of the}} country following the fall of Saddam Hussein's government, and was the most senior British officer involved in post-war planning for the country. Shortly after the invasion of Iraq, he appeared on BBC Breakfast with Frost, speaking to presenter Peter Sissons about his role. He praised the military campaign and went on to talk about the challenges of rebuilding the country, saying [...] "I think in relative terms we are not as badly off <b>as</b> <b>me</b> might have feared", but agreed that there were insufficient [...] "people on the ground" [...] to ensure security {{in the aftermath of the}} invasion and removal of Saddam Hussein's government. He was later deeply critical of the planning made for post-war Iraq, and stated that he attempted to raise the issue of insufficient planning with politicians. However, he was never [...] "overly concerned" [...] by warnings from aid agencies of a massive humanitarian crisis in the aftermath of the invasion which, in the event, never materialised, though he admitted he had been too optimistic about the state of the Iraqi infrastructure. In the Breakfast with Frost interview, he drew an analogy with London, [...] "if you imagine going into London and every Ministry building is completely empty of furniture, completely empty of people, most of the windows blown out, just trying to find the people who work in those Ministries, the equivalent of the Home Office and [...] out who worked there, getting them back to work, beginning to pay their salaries which we're now beginning to do, and encouraging them to come back and work with us is bound to take a bit of time." ...|$|E
500|$|Unhappy {{with the}} quality of 1980's Live at Last, the band {{recorded}} another live album—titled Live Evil—during the Mob Rules world tour, across the United States in Dallas, San Antonio, and Seattle, in 1982. During the mixing process for the album, Iommi and Butler had a falling out with Dio. Misinformed by their then-current mixing engineer, Iommi and Butler accused Dio of sneaking into the studio at night to raise the volume of his vocals. In addition, Dio was not satisfied with the pictures of him in the artwork. Butler also accused Dio and Appice of working on a solo album during the album's mixing without telling the other members of Black Sabbath. [...] "Ronnie wanted more say in things," [...] Iommi said. [...] "And Geezer would get upset with him and that is where the rot set in. Live Evil is when it all fell apart. Ronnie wanted to do more of his own thing, and the engineer we were using at the time in the studio didn't know what to do, because Ronnie was telling him one thing and we were telling him another. At the end of the day, we just said, 'That's it, the band is over'". [...] "When it comes time for the vocal, nobody tells me what to do. Nobody! Because they're not as good <b>as</b> <b>me,</b> so I do what I want to do," [...] Dio later said. [...] "I refuse to listen to Live Evil, because there are too many problems. If you look at the credits, the vocals and drums are listed off to the side. Open up the album and see how many pictures there are of Tony, and how many there are of me and Vinny".|$|E
