5|$|From 2012–3, Smith {{performed}} {{several times}} with the International Harp Ensemble, a Surrey-based group of harpists who produce {{a variety of different}} styles of harp music, including appearing with the group on a September episode of Songs of Praise. She also guest-featured on the group's 2012 album The Magic of a Thousand Strings, singing on five tracks. Further shows with the International Harp Ensemble were planned into 2014. While working with the International Harp Ensemble, Smith began training with vocal coach Joy Mammen, who also teaches Lesley Garrett, as well <b>as</b> <b>learning</b> German and Italian, with the intention of moving from classical crossover towards opera. She continued to perform publicly in 2015, singing at Wembley again in August.|$|E

5|$|Both Guitar Hero and Rock Band, {{a similar}} series of games {{developed}} by Harmonix (who originally developed Guitar Hero), {{have altered the}} video game and music industries. For video games, the introduction of Guitar Hero has led rhythm games {{to become one of}} the industries' largest growing markets. The series has also sparked the creation of both commercial and independently developed games with similar gameplay mechanics as well <b>as</b> <b>learning</b> tools using a real guitar in place of the controller. Older artists featured in Guitar Hero and Rock Band have experienced a surge in the popularity of their music, and the games have been seen as a way for younger audiences to experience the classic rock songs featured in the games. Newer bands and unsigned artists have also found success by being included in the game. This has led several bands to actively seek placement of their songs within the games. The impact of Guitar Hero on the music industry has caused music publishers to re-evaluate their approach to music licensing and their relationship with the video game industry.|$|E
5|$|By 1870, Morris {{had become}} a public figure in Britain, {{resulting}} in repeated press requests for photographs, which he despised. That year, he also reluctantly agreed to sit for a portrait by establishment painter George Frederic Watts. Morris was keenly interested in Icelandic literature, having befriended the Icelandic theologian Eiríkr Magnússon. Together they produced prose translations of the Eddas and Sagas for publication in English. Morris also developed {{a keen interest in}} creating handwritten illuminated manuscripts, producing 18 such books between 1870 and 1875, the first of which was A Book of Verse, completed as a birthday present for Georgina Burne-Jones. 12 of these 18 were handwritten copies of Nordic tales such as Halfdan the Black, Frithiof the Bold, and The Dwellers of Eyr. Morris deemed calligraphy to be an art form, and taught himself both Roman and italic script, as well <b>as</b> <b>learning</b> how to produce gilded letters. In November 1872 he published Love is Enough, a poetic drama based on a story in the Medieval Welsh text, the Mabinogion. Illustrated with Burne-Jones woodcuts, it was not a popular success. By 1871, he had begun work on a novel set in the present, The Novel on Blue Paper, which was about a love triangle; it would remain unfinished and Morris later asserted that it was not well written.|$|E

5|$|The {{enhanced}} A Company group—approximately 130 {{troops in}} total—arrived {{in the country}} in several groups and joined the SAS, who had already established a base in Hastings, a village 30 miles (50 kilometres) south of Freetown, where several of the paras recognised former colleagues among the troopers from D Squadron. At Hastings, the paras focused on live firing exercises and rehearsed various scenarios in a scale replica of Magbeni which had been constructed at the camp. As well <b>as</b> <b>learning</b> the layout of the village and refining battle technique, the rehearsals allowed the soldiers to acclimatise to the tropical heat, and led commanders to the decision that the paras would go into battle with minimal equipment {{to reduce the risk of}} heat exhaustion—excluding weapons and ammunition, they would carry only water and field dressings. Some officers feared that the weight of body armour would increase the risk of heat exhaustion, but commanders hoped that the cooler temperatures of the early morning (when the operation was planned to be launched) would mitigate the effects of the weight, and decided to order its use.|$|E
5|$|While domain-specific {{accounts}} of word learning argue for innate constraints that limit infants' hypotheses about word meanings, domain-general perspectives argue that word learning can {{be accounted for}} by general cognitive processes, such <b>as</b> <b>learning</b> and memory, which are not specific to language. Yet other theorists have proposed social pragmatic accounts, which stress the role of caregivers in guiding infants through the word learning process. According to some research, however, children are active participants in their own word learning, although caregivers may still {{play an important role in}} this process. Recently, an emergentist coalition model has also been proposed to suggest that word learning cannot be fully attributed to a single factor. Instead, a variety of cues, including salient and social cues, may be utilized by infants at different points in their vocabulary development.|$|E

40|$|Perceiving gender {{differences}} <b>as</b> natural or <b>learned</b> {{has important implications}} for the self. Here it was hypothesized that, compared to thinking of gender <b>as</b> <b>learned</b> (i. e., a social constructivist theory), thinking of gender as natural (i. e., an essentialist theory) would lead to a more external locus of control, less perceived ability and persistence, and stronger stereotypical associations of men with science and women with the liberal arts. Participants were randomly assigned to read an article that primed either a social constructivist or an essentialist theory. Participant gender moderated how the prime affected locus of control, perceived ability, and implicit associations. After being primed to think of gender as natural, men had more external locus of control and less perceived ability than after being primed to think of gender <b>as</b> <b>learned.</b> In contrast, after being primed to think of gender as natural, women had less external locus of control and greater perceived ability than after being primed to think of gender <b>as</b> <b>learned.</b> These results are discussed through the lens of the Self-Serving Attributional Bias (SSAB) and Worldview Verification Theory. Through the SSAB, men would prefer to think of {{gender differences}} <b>as</b> <b>learned</b> because this worldview allows them to think of gender disparities in power (that are often in their favor) as due to somewhat controllable factors. Women would prefer to think of gender <b>as</b> <b>learned</b> because this worldview allows them to instead frame gender disparities in power (that are often not in their favor) as due to uncontrollable factors. Combined with Worldview Verification Theory (i. e., people react with emotional distress when they encounter information that contradicts their worldviews), these results indicate that people may have had more external locus of control, less perceived ability, and been slower to make stereotypical associations after being primed with the lay theory that contradicted their preferred worldviews...|$|R
