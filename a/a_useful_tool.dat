5|$|In addition, isotopic {{analysis}} of exposed terrestrial rocks has demonstrated the cosmogenic (cosmic ray) production of 21Ne. This isotope {{is generated by}} spallation reactions on magnesium, sodium, silicon, and aluminium. By analyzing all three isotopes, the cosmogenic component can be resolved from magmatic neon and nucleogenic neon. This suggests that neon will be <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> <b>tool</b> in determining cosmic exposure ages of surface rocks and meteorites.|$|E

5|$|Jedi Knight is {{primarily}} a first-person shooter, although it does offer {{the choice of a}} third-person view. The game consists of twenty-one levels with objectives which the player must complete before being able to continue to the next level. There are weapons available in each level and after level three, the player has the use of a lightsaber, along with the Force. In addition to being an effective weapon, the lightsaber is also <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> <b>tool</b> for the player, providing light in dark areas, deflecting incoming blaster fire and cutting through some obstacles.|$|E
5|$|In a Hindu {{caste system}} that was conspicuously present, Brahmins enjoyed a privileged {{position}} as providers of knowledge and local justice. These Brahmins were normally involved in careers that revolved around religion and learning {{with the exception of}} a few who achieved success in martial affairs. They were patronised by kings, nobles and wealthy aristocrats who persuaded learned Brahmins to settle in specific towns and villages by making them grants of land and houses. The relocation of Brahmin scholars was calculated to be in the interest of the kingdom as they were viewed as persons detached from wealth and power and their knowledge was <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> <b>tool</b> to educate and teach ethical conduct and discipline in local communities. Brahmins were also actively involved in solving local problems by functioning as neutral arbiters (Panchayat).|$|E
5|$|Kouao and Climbié {{left the}} Ivory Coast {{possibly}} in November 1998 and flew to Paris, France, where Climbié enrolled at school. By December 1998, however, Kouao began to receive warnings about Climbié's absenteeism, and in February 1999, the school issued a child-at-risk notification {{and a social}} worker became involved. The school observed how Climbié tended to fall asleep in class, and the headteacher later recalled Kouao's mentioning Climbié suffering from some form of dermatological condition and that, on her last visit to the school on 25 March 1999, Climbié had a shaven head and was wearing a wig. When they left France, Kouao owed the authorities £2,000, after being wrongly paid in child benefit, and it is claimed that Kouao viewed Climbié as <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> <b>tool</b> for claiming benefits. Kouao had also been evicted {{from her home in}} France because of rent arrears.|$|E
