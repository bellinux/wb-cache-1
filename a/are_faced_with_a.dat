They traverse six areas within a time limit to make it back to the fairy world in time. The areas all consist of a number of floors; the player needs to collect all keys on each floor, before being allowed to jump down to a lower floor. To find the keys, the player uses a radar that displays their locations; once all have been collected, it shows the location of the exit. Once the player reaches the bottom floor, they <b>are</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> boss character they need to defeat, after which they can proceed to the next area.|$|E
5|$|When animals <b>are</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{choice to}} either {{wait for a}} reward, or receive a reward right away, the {{discounting}} of the reward is hyperbolic. As {{the length of time}} of waiting for a reward increases, the reward is discounted at a gradual rate. Empirical data have suggested that exponential discounting, rewards discounting at a constant rate per unit of waiting time, only occurs when there are random interruptions in foraging. Discounting can also be related to the risk sensitivity of animals. Rather than relating risk to delay, risk sensitivity acts as a function of delay discounting. In a study conducted by Haden and Platt, macaque monkeys were given the choice of a medium reward that they knew they would receive, versus a more risky choice. The riskier choice would reward the monkey with a large reward fifty percent of the time, and a small reward the other fifty percent. The ultimate payoff was the same, but the monkeys preferred the riskier choice. They speculated that the monkeys did not see their action as risky, but rather as a large, delayed reward. They reasoned that the monkeys viewed the large reward as certain: if they did not get the large reward the first time around, they would eventually get it, but at a longer delay.|$|E

25|$|When {{determining}} if {{an outcome}} has been achieved, assessments may become too mechanical, looking {{only to see}} if the student has acquired the knowledge. The ability to use and apply the knowledge in different ways may not be the focus of the assessment. The focus on determining if the outcome has been achieved leads to a loss of understanding and learning for students, who may never be shown how to use the knowledge they have gained. Instructors <b>are</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> challenge: they must learn to manage an environment that can become fundamentally different from what they are accustomed to. In regards to giving assessments, they must be willing to put in the time required to create a valid, reliable assessment that ideally would allow students to demonstrate their understanding of the information, while remaining objective.|$|E
25|$|Self-paced reading: The {{participants}} <b>are</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> screen, {{on which}} a text appears in successive segment. They are asked to process each sequent segment by pressing a key. A trial starts with the presentation of groups of dashes separated by spaces. Each group serving as a placeholder for a word in the text, {{which is to be}} presented on that trial and each dash representing a letter. When the participant subsequently presses the key, the first segment appears, say the first two words, replacing the corresponding placeholders for the right words, while the placeholders for the left words remain on the screen. Once pressing the key again, the two words from the first segment are replaced by their placeholders again and the next segment appears, taking the position of the corresponding placeholders. This continues until the whole text has been read. A follow-up comprehension question is presented to ensure that participants indeed pay attention to the meaning of the sentences. The interval between the two successive key presses is measured and registered as the response time.|$|E

According to The State of the World's Children 2007, women generally work longer hours than men regardless if they live in a developed or developing country. Most studies found that when both parents <b>are</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> full-time job, women <b>are</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> higher amount of a domestic workload than men.

500|$|The Importance of Being Earnests {{popularity}} has meant {{it has been}} translated into many languages, though the homophonous pun in the title ("", a masculine proper name, and [...] "", the virtue of steadfastness and seriousness) poses a special problem for translators. The easiest case of a suitable translation of the pun, perpetuating its sense and meaning, may have been its translation into German. Since English and German are closely related languages, German provides an equivalent adjective ("ernst") and also a matching masculine proper name ("Ernst"). The meaning and tenor of the wordplay are exactly the same. Yet {{there are many different}} possible titles in German, mostly concerning sentence structure. The two most common ones are [...] "Bunbury oder ernst / Ernst sein ist alles" [...] and [...] "Bunbury oder wie wichtig es ist, ernst / Ernst zu sein". In a study of Italian translations, Adrian Pablé found thirteen different versions using eight titles. Since wordplay is often unique to the language in question, translators <b>are</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> choice of either staying faithful to the original—in this case the English adjective and virtue earnest—or creating a similar pun in their own language.|$|E

2500|$|Although we <b>are</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> very {{convoluted}} narrative, García Márquez is able {{to define}} clear themes while maintaining individual character identities, and using different narrative techniques such as third-person narrators, specific point of view narrators, and streams of consciousness. [...] Cinematographic techniques are also employed in the novel, {{with the idea of}} the montage and the close-up, which effectively combine the comic and grotesque with the dramatic and tragic. Furthermore, political and historical realities are combined with the mythical and magical Latin American world.
