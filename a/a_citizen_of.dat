5|$|The bishop {{served as}} the judge in a dispute in 1158 between a dean from the diocese of York and <b>a</b> <b>citizen</b> <b>of</b> Scarborough, in which the layman alleged that the dean had extorted {{large sums of money}} from him by {{repeatedly}} charging his wife with adultery and fining her. The dean's actions were contrary to a royal decree, but although he appeared before a royal court he escaped secular penalties because he was a clerk. The result of the case, a precursor to the later Becket dispute, aroused King Henry's anger, but the death of the king's brother Geoffrey and the king's subsequent travel to the Continent to deal with that issue meant that the matter was eventually dropped.|$|E
