50|$|Currently, {{there are}} several design philosophies in {{earthquake}} engineering, making use of experimental results, computer simulations and observations from past earthquakes to offer the required performance for the seismic threat {{at the site of}} interest. These range from appropriately sizing the structure to be strong and ductile enough to survive the shaking with an <b>acceptable</b> <b>damage,</b> to equipping it with base isolation or using structural vibration control technologies to minimize any forces and deformations. While the former is the method typically applied in most earthquake-resistant structures, important facilities, landmarks and cultural heritage buildings use the more advanced (and expensive) techniques of isolation or control to survive strong shaking with minimal damage. Examples of such applications are the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels and the Acropolis Museum.|$|E

40|$|Ship {{structures}} {{are likely to}} be subject to age-related deterioration such as corrosion wastage, cracking or mechanical damage. It has reportedly been recognised that such age-related deterioration is almost always involved in the catastrophic failures of ship structures including total losses. While such accidents typically cause concern to the public, maintenance and repair of aged structures is quite costly and complex. It is thus of great importance to develop advanced technologies allowing for proper management and control of such age-related deterioration. This paper summarises the report of the ISSC 2006 Committee V. 6 presenting current practices, recent advances and future trends on condition assessment of aged ships.

It {{is an extension of}} the damage detection method adopting multiple damage location assurance criterion. In this paper, the sensitivity of modal strain energy to damage obtained from the analytical model is incorporated into the correlation objective function. Firstly, the sensitivity matrix of modal strain energy to damage is conducted offline, and for an arbitrary damage case, the correlation coefficient (objective function) is calculated by multiplying the sensitivity matrix and damage vector. Then, a genetic algorithm is used to iteratively search the damage vector maximising the correlation between the corresponding modal strain energy change (hypothesised) and its counterpart in measurement. The proposed method is simulated and compared with the conventional methods, e. g. frequency-error method, coordinate modal assurance criterion and multiple damage location assurance criterion using mode shapes on a numerical truss bridge structure. The result demonstrates the modal strain energy correlation method is able to yield <b>acceptable</b> <b>damage</b> detection outcomes with less computing efforts, even in a noise contaminated condition...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: {{to present}} some cases from our service and {{to confirm that}} sural and lateral supramalleolar flaps are good options for {{covering}} the soft tissues of the foot and ankle. METHODS: twenty-two flaps were constructed in 21 patients of ages ranging from 15 to 72 years. Male patients predominated (66. 6 %) and in 47. 6 % of the cases the injury resulted from accidents involving motorcycles. RESULTS: among the 22 flaps, 12 were sural and 10 were lateral supramalleolar; in one case, two flaps were used. In all the cases, the injuries were successfully covered and the patients recovered well. During the postoperative follow-up, the commonest complication was epidermolysis, occurring in eight cases (three in a sural flap and five in a supramalleolar flap), among which two cases progressed to distal necrosis of the flap (one sural and the other supramalleolar). One patient wanted the flap reviewed for esthetic reasons. CONCLUSIONS: sural and supramalleolar flaps are very reliable.

According to the SEAOC Vision 2000 [14], performance-based seismic engineering consists {{of a set of}} engineering procedures for the design and construction of structural systems to achieve predictable levels of performance in response to specified level of hazards, within definable levels of reliability. In terms of geotechnical engineering a performance based design or assessment of earth and embankment dams involves larger number of probabilistic considerations that can be sometimes cumbersome. Several standards have established some metrics for performance-based assessment of dams which are mostly based on acceptable levels of damage in relation with different design level earthquakes. For example, according to Wieland [18] the ICOLD [7] establishes the performance criteria for a dam based on several design earthquake intensities. The dam body should be able to sustain no structural damage under an Operational Basis Earthquake and structural damage is accepted as long as the stability of the dam is ensured and there is no uncontrolled release of water from the reservoir causing flooding in the downstream region of the dam under a Safety Evaluation Earthquake (SEE). Wieland et al. [19] indicates that performance criteria or specifications of <b>acceptable</b> <b>damage</b> under SEE ground motions are poorly defined and considering these in safety evaluations requires considerable engineering judgment. FEMA 65 [5] and FEMA 1025 [6] both provide federal guidelines for the risk assessment and dam safety and are similar to the ICOLD guidelines. They provide guides that relate probable damage scenarios to different design earthquake levels.|$|E

This {{is not a question of}} how many elephants an area of land can hold before the populations starts to decline, because by the time this stage is reached, the habitat would have been almost completely destroyed by elephants. Rather, the term [...] "carrying capacity" [...] relates more to what the <b>acceptable</b> levels of <b>damage</b> are to a particular habitat type. In addition, it is important to consider the fact that elephants don't spread out evenly over the fenced areas but rather have preferred areas of feeding based on access to water or preferred trees, such as Marula. Thus the definition of <b>acceptable</b> levels of <b>damage</b> needs to be expressed in terms of percentage of total reserve area that has certain defined levels of serious damage. The Walker scale of elephant browsing pressure is being used by the Opwall teams to assess the levels of damage to trees and shrubs in different reserves at differing levels of elephant feeding pressure so that contours of similar levels of habitat damage can be defined for each of the reserves. Data are being gathered at a range of elephant grazing pressures so that estimates of levels of damage for a reserve with differing levels of elephant populations can be predicted.|$|R

40|$|Bird {{ingestion}} {{has been}} a hazard that affects the structural integrity and survivability of turbofan engines. It can result in deformation {{of one or more}} fan blades, in which case, the engine is likely to surge and not recover. Numerical studies and simulations of bird strikes have become essential to optimize the design of engine components simultaneously to increase the engine capabilities for <b>acceptable</b> <b>damage</b> tolerance. Good understanding of these phenomena and the implications on the behaviour of the flow field with respect to the damage affecting the fan blades are usually investigated using computational techniques and/or experimental methods. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method for the analysis of the aerodynamic behaviour of an aero-engine fan affected by a bird strike. NASA rotor 67 was used as a test case because of the availability of experimental data that can be used to calibrate the model for the undamaged fan. The undamaged fan characteristic was mapped using a modification to the methodology developed by Sayma (2007). In this method a downstream variable throttle is added which allows changing the operating point on the speed characteristic without having to change downstream boundary conditions. This approach allows for changes in fan operating point to come out of the calculation as opposed to those dictated by the downstream static pressure boundary conditions used in typical computations. The methodology is automated allowing for a sweep along a speed characteristic or along a working line in one calculation in the same way as a rig test is conducted. Agreement with experimental data when available was excellent. This provided the base line for the undamaged blades. A damaged blade was inserted among undamaged blades in the fan assembly and the fan characteristic was mapped for a range of rotational speeds. Two different degrees of damage were analysed in an attempt to establish a correlation between the extent of the damage and the locus of the stall boundary. It was found that small increments on the damage lead to significant reduction in stall margin particularly at higher rotational speeds...|$|E
40|$|Reconciling human landscapes with {{wildlife}} needs can demand innovative solutions. Enhancing {{wildlife conservation}} in agricultural landscapes requires habitat restoration; returning marginal farmlands to wetlands {{in a way}} that remains productive for farmers can aid existing strategies. This study develops and explores the feasibility of an ecological design to rehabilitate wet, poor quality farmland into a wetland that can serve as wildlife habitat while producing a crop. Research targets methods of biophysical site restoration that are feasible for farmers to initiate; identification of temperate wetland crops with potential to meet economic and ecological criteria; and parameters for meeting farmers' needs in terms of management and desirability. Scientific literature on wetland and restoration ecology is examined and integrated with agricultural studies and interview responses from landowners involved in alternative food production. Primary data collection for design development centers on coastal British Columbia, where competing land uses have degraded many former wetlands while the region's fertile soils support prolific, diversified farming. Qualitative, semi-structured interviews with key informants involved in local food production were conducted as part of a participative research process in order to get input and feedback throughout design development. A case study site was chosen in a seasonally flooded agricultural watershed outside of Duncan, B. C. A design is proposed that combines five habitat types with a naturalized cropping system. Major findings include the potential use of many wild and native plants as crops, as a way to provide sufficient economic returns and maintain ecological sustainability. Current opportunities for wetland agriculture include niche marketing, added value products, agrotourism, and increasing sales through farm reputation. Possible deterrents include product marketing, and the unfamiliarity of the plants from a farming perspective, where levels of <b>acceptable</b> <b>damage</b> imposed by fluctuating water conditions, weed competition, and herbivory are undetermined. Participant response was positive overall with regards to the design and preliminary results indicate that such a system could be feasible. Public interest and technical ability to create an agricultural wetland exist; developing creative marketing for such products in North America appears to be the primary challenge. The design is thus proposed as a long-term study to minimize risk for interested landowners.

The results from a case study showed that the deterministic optimization was computationally efficient with no randomness encountered in hydrological simulation, although its solution was hardly reliable in achieving the target for flood mitigation. The stochastic version, on the other hand, could offer richer information on system reliability and help managers make a more robust decision. The results also revealed that the rainfall extremes under the impact of climate change could significantly affect system investment.

40|$|It is {{important}} to assess and communicate the risk to life and downtime associated with earthquake induced damage to structures. Thus, a previously developed four-diagram/four-step approach to assess direct losses associated with structural damage, a similar quantitative risk assessment technique is {{used to examine the}} indirect loss associated with death and downtime. The four-step approach is subdivided into four distinct tasks: (a) Hazard analysis, (b) Structural analysis, (c) Loss analysis of both direct and indirect losses and (d) The total loss estimation due to damage, death and downtime. This empirically calibrated model in the form of power curve is used by establishing losses corresponding to onset of damage state 5 (complete damage) and limiting upper losses. The utility of the approach is investigated for the bridges in both California and New Zealand regions with different detailing. Results show that death related losses for bridges are generally twice and downtime five times the direct damage losses.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{gives an}} {{integrated}} probabilistic framework (IPF) {{that deals with}} the optimal layout of facilities in an industrial plant. The specific case of a crude oil tank farm is detailed in this present paper, which includes the tank fire {{as well as the}} corresponding optimal layout based on inherent safety and evacuation. The tank fire can be caused by the oxidative self-heating of pyrophoric iron sulfides which extensively exist on the inner wall of the crude oil tank, especially in the respiratory/safety valves. Oxidative self-heating, or spontaneous combustion of iron sulfides is a process of oxidation and generally influenced by five external factors including water content, mass per unit area of iron sulfides, operating temperature of tank, flow rate and concentration of oxygen facing the iron sulfides. According to the previous literature about self-heating process of iron sulfides, the maximum temperature (TmaxTmax) of solid phase is a vital indicator representing the pyrophoric feature of iron sulfides in specific circumstances. And the maximum temperature (TmaxTmax) can be predicted by the model developed from support vector machine (SVM) technique. While the predicted maximum temperature (TmaxTmax) is compared with a defined threshold value, it can be revealed whether the oxidative self-heating of iron sulfides will lead to explosion and then cause tank fire. On this grounds, the probability of tank fire due to the oxidative self-heating of iron sulfides can be obtained by Monte Carlo simulations. For tank fire, the major physical damage to the surrounding tanks and workers is thermal radiation rather than overpressure or missile projection. Considering the worst case scenario, that is the vapor-liquid interface in the tank covered with fire, then the thermal radiation flux passing through a receiver at a specified distance away from the tank can be derived. In reverse, the critical horizontal distance between tank and receiver can be obtained if the critical thermal radiation flux through a receiver is given. Assuming that the minimum and maximum risks of thermal radiation to a receiver are separately 0 and 1 corresponding to different thermal radiation fluxes, then the risk of a tank or worker receiving a given thermal radiation flux can be determined by the thermal radiation flux equation. In a crude oil tank farm containing more than one tank, the potential thermal radiation flux received by an object at an arbitrary location is the superposition of those from different tanks. For the optimization of space collocation and floor area of tank farm from inherently safe design, if the damage risk of an object from other overall tanks equals to the critical <b>acceptable</b> <b>damage</b> risk, and the corresponding floor area of tank farm is the minimum, it will certainly result in an optimal space collocation. The handling method for the mentioned problem inherently reduces property loss and casualty to some extent...|$|E
40|$|Maintenance {{planning}} and life-cycle assessment methods for bridge networks have received large research interest for many years; with modern emphasis {{often based on}} probabilistic approaches, due {{to their ability to}} handle uncertainty. This allows for risk-based approaches to quantify structural safety, which is largely seen as a superior approach than the deterministic methods typically used in practice. Structural safety can broadly be defined as an acceptable level of chance/probability that the structure will not fail in its function; i. e. to resist the loads/actions to which it is subjected to. The structural reliability method provides for the computation of structural safety by accounting for probabilistically uncertain load models and uncertainties around the return period of extreme load events, as well as the uncertainty in the resistance capacity of the structural system. In addition to a single-point-in-time evaluation of structural safety, the life-cycle performance can be evaluated using physical models for future deterioration; again, constrained under uncertain information about future deterioration. However, being a probabilistic method, it can be somewhat subjective in nature, based on the availability of accurate data and the reliance on expert knowledge, and thus sensitive to the parameters of the input model which rely on the level of information available for the problem at hand. While structural safety is the apex of modern maintenance {{planning and}} lifecycle assessment, the most prevalent performance indicator for which future maintenance and intervention decisions are made come from visual inspection based condition ratings. These visual inspections are used to evaluate the extent of deterioration present and assign a condition rating based on a predefined scale of damage, after which bridge managers trigger further assessment or intervention actions based on <b>acceptable</b> <b>damage</b> levels. Again, in evaluating a single or small number of bridges, there is a degree of subjectivity and reliance on expert knowledge that is also seen with probabilistic assessment methods. Unlike structural reliability, which often suffers from a lack of available or accurate information, condition rating data for large bridge networks generate a large repository of data which provides an excellent opportunity to look at data on a larger scale than is currently implemented in practice. This results in disparate levels of information being available for bridge networks, with large amounts of lower level information and small amounts of detailed information. In this thesis, how disparate information levels affect these two assessment methods will be explored and efforts to mitigate against the uncertainty in the information will be suggested. It will be shown that: Reliability-based calibrations of bridges are possible through observed clustering of parametric importance and sensitivity measures, based on uncertainty in relation to the available information for probabilistic modelling (Hanley and Pakrashi 2016) Existing bridges assessed under code-defined traffic load are sensitive to safety reclassification due to evolving definitions, leading to misinterpretation of the actual state of the structure and, thus, a misallocation of resources (Hanley et al. 2017 a) Bridges designed under modern, more conservative code-defined traffic load models and assessed under probabilistic load models can expect a longer projected service life before intervention is required, and that the initial construction cost of this conservatism is largely offset when lifecycle cost is considered (Hanley et al. 2016 a) The use of multivariate analysis methods are applicable to modern bridge management systems that store large amounts of data, and that these methods can provide for clustering of bridges based on their structural forms and states of disrepair (Hanley et al. 2015) Large groups of specific bridge types have well-defined, consistent factor structures, whereby a bespoke linear combination of individual elemental condition ratings provide an accurate assessment of the bridge’s overall condition rating; improving on currently implemented decision tools in existing bridge management systems (Hanley et al. 2016 b, 2017 b,c) This work provides a basis for which further research can be undertaken into developing an information-driven probabilistic decision making framework, leading to the quantification of the value of disparate information levels. The potential future applications include incorporating the derived underlying factor structure of large data-sets of bridges directly into structural reliability methods through probabilistic graphical models, such as Bayesian Belief Networks; thus providing a more robust, information driven framework from which to make decisions under uncertainty...|$|E

This is also reflected by attempts to operationalise protection goals for risk assessment purposes for several different environmental stressors by the use of the ecosystem services concept [13 – 15].|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{investigates the}} {{effectiveness}} of artificial neural network (ANN) in identifying damages in structures. Global (natural frequencies) and local (mode shapes) vibration-based data {{has been used as}} the input to ANN for location and severity prediction of damages in a slab-like structure. A finite element analysis has been used to obtain the dynamic characteristics of intact and damaged structure to train the neural network model. Different damage scenarios have been introduced by reducing the local stiffness of the selected elements at different locations along the structure. Several combinations of input variables in different modes have been used in order to obtain a reliable ANN model. The trained ANN model is validated using laboratory test data. The results show that ANN is capable of providing <b>acceptable</b> result on <b>damage</b> prediction of tested slab structure...|$|R
40|$|A {{decrease}} in reactor coolant flow occurring while {{the plant is}} at power {{could result in a}} degradation of core heat transfer. A resulting increase in fuel tem-perature and accompanying fuel damage could then result if specified <b>acceptable</b> fuel <b>damage</b> limits are exceeded during the transients. A number of transients that are expected to occur with moderate frequency and that result in a {{decrease in}} forced reactor coolant flow rate are covered by this SRP section. Each of these transients should be discussed in individual sections of the applicant's safety analysis report (SAR) as suggested by the Standard Format (Ref. 4). Core thermal and hydraulic transients associated with partial and complete loss of reactor coolant flow are evaluated. These include: 1. For boiling water reactors (BWRs), partial and complete recirculation pump trips and malfunctions of the recirculation flow controller to cause decreas-ing flbw. 2. For pressurized water reactors (PWR's), partial and complete reactor coolant pump trips. A partial loss of coolant flow may be caused by a mechanical or electrical failure in a-pump motor, a fault in the power supply to the pump motor, a pump motor trip caused by such anomalies as over-current or phase imbalance, or a failure within the recirculation flow control network (BWR) resulting in decreasing flow. A complete loss of forced coolant flow may result from the simultaneous loss of electrical power to all pump motors...|$|R
30|$|The {{design process}} of bridge {{barriers}} is {{specified in the}} CHBDC Clause 12.4. 3.5 (CSA 2014 a) specifies that the suitability of a traffic barrier anchorage to the deck slab shall be based on its performance during crash testing of the traffic barrier. For an anchorage to be considered <b>acceptable,</b> significant <b>damage</b> shall not occur in the anchorage or deck during crash testing. CHBDC also specifies that if crash testing results for the anchorage are not available, the anchorage and deck shall be designed to resist the maximum bending, shear and punching loads that can be transmitted {{to them by the}} barrier wall. CHBDC specifies transverse, longitudinal and vertical loads of 210, 70 and 90 kN, respectively, that can be applied simultaneously over a certain barrier length in case of PL- 3 barrier. It also specifies that transverse load shall be applied over a barrier length of 2400  mm for PL- 3 barriers. Since transverse loading creates the critical load carrying capacity, both the longitudinal and vertical loads were not considered in the design of barrier wall reinforcement and anchorages between the deck slab and the barrier wall. It should be noted that CHBDC specifies a live load factor of 1.7. Thus, the design impact load on PL- 3 barrier wall over 2.4  m length is 357  kN.|$|R
