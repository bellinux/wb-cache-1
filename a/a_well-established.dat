30|$|AH is <b>an</b> <b>well-established</b> {{risk factor}} for female hormone-related cancers (such as {{adenocarcinoma}} of the endometrium) [45 – 52]. Most studies that address this question {{have found that the}} risk increases with the duration of the hypertension, particularly when diagnosed before the age of 50  years [51, 52]. The high BMI and hypertension appear to have a synergistic effect on the risk of endometrial cancer and produce an appreciably elevated risk (almost five-fold) in women exposed to both factors [53].|$|R

5|$|Hawaiian volcanoes follow <b>a</b> <b>well-established</b> {{life cycle}} of growth and erosion. After a new volcano forms, its lava output {{gradually}} increases. Height and activity both peak when the volcano is around 500,000 years old and then rapidly decline. Eventually it goes dormant, and eventually extinct. Erosion then weathers the volcano until it again becomes a seamount.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} this period that American Bison began a {{periodic}} east–west trek through Indiana, crossing the Falls of the Ohio and the Wabash River near modern-day Vincennes. These herds became important to civilizations in southern Indiana and created <b>a</b> <b>well-established</b> Buffalo Trace, later used by European-American pioneers moving west.|$|E
5|$|The Forbeses were <b>a</b> <b>well-established</b> Aberdeenshire family, {{holders of}} both a barony and a baronetcy. The baronetcy had been {{bestowed}} in 1630, and was restricted to heirs male. In 1884 Sir William Forbes, the eighth baronet, inherited his cousin Maria's title as Lord Sempill and took the surname of Forbes-Sempill.

Multi-axial pedicle screw designs allow deviation of the screw {{away from the}} perpendicular to the longitudinal rod, which facilitates application of a screw-rod system such as PRIMA OCT into the curved spine. This study was performed a static (compression bending and torsion) and dynamic (compression bending fatigue) empirical analysis of PRIMA OCT component such as pedicle screw, rod and set screw based on the guideline of ASTM F 136 - 98 using Ultra-high Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMWPE) blocks as test vertebral bodies...|$|R
5|$|Aspirin {{is readily}} broken {{down in the}} body to {{salicylic}} acid, which itself has anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic effects. In 2012, salicylic acid was found to activate AMP-activated protein kinase, which has been suggested as a possible explanation {{for some of the}} effects of both salicylic acid and aspirin. The acetyl portion of the aspirin molecule has its own targets. Acetylation of cellular proteins is <b>a</b> <b>well-established</b> phenomenon in the regulation of protein function at the post-translational level. Aspirin is able to acetylate several other targets in addition to COX isoenzymes. These acetylation reactions may explain many hitherto unexplained effects of aspirin.|$|E
5|$|Funding was {{a problem}} from the outset. No {{producer}} was willing to finance the film, as it lacked stars, songs and action scenes. On learning of Ray's plan, one producer, Mr Bhattacharya of Kalpana Movies, contacted Bandopadhyay's widow to request the filming rights and get the film made by Debaki Bose, <b>a</b> <b>well-established</b> director. The widow declined as she had already permitted Ray to make the film. The estimated budget for the production was 70,000 (about US$14,613 in 1955). One producer, Rana Dutta, gave money to continue shooting, but had to stop after some of his films flopped.|$|E

We analyze the measured reflectivity spectra of the film-substrate multilayer structure within <b>a</b> <b>well-establish</b> procedure {{based on the}} Fresnel equation and extract the real part of the optical conductivity of TiN. We identify the metallic contribution {{as well as the}} finite energy excitations and disentangle the spectral weight distribution among them. The absorption spectrum of TiN bears some similarities with the electrodynamic response observed in the normal state of the high-temperature superconductors. Particularly, a mid-infrared feature in the optical conductivity is quite reminiscent of a pseudogap-like excitation...|$|R

5|$|Julian Glover was <b>a</b> <b>well-established</b> {{character}} actor {{who had previously}} appeared in Doctor Who as Richard the Lionheart in The Crusade (1965). Glover was reluctant to don the Jagaroth mask created for scenes where Scarlioni had shed his human disguise as he felt the mask would impede his performance. As a result, he is doubled by Richard Sheekey {{in many of these}} scenes. Tom Chadbon was cast as Duggan on account of his resemblance to the Franco-Belgian comics hero Tintin. Peter Halliday had previously appeared in several Doctor Who serials including The Invasion and Doctor Who and the Silurians.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an introduction to}} integrating formal methods in the DEVS framework. Formal methods are known to allow symbolic manipulation and reasoning. DEVS is <b>a</b> <b>well-establish</b> Modeling and Simulation (M&S) framework. Combining them {{makes it possible to}} formally specify models, automate their analysis as regard to design and use requirements, and develop rigorous proofs of their properties. Such a potential is very important for verification, validation and accreditation, a key issue in M&S. The paper presents the methodological approach we have defined for specifying logicbased simulation models, combining DEVS and the Z formalism. A case study is presented and we use the Z/EVES system for formal analyses...|$|R

5|$|Philosophy of {{psychology}} {{is a relatively}} young field, because psychology only became a discipline of its own in the late 1800s. In particular, neurophilosophy has just recently become its own field with the works of Paul Churchland and Patricia Churchland. Philosophy of mind, by contrast, has been <b>a</b> <b>well-established</b> discipline since before psychology was a field of study at all. It is concerned with questions about {{the very nature of}} mind, the qualities of experience, and particular issues like the debate between dualism and monism. Another related field is philosophy of language.|$|E

5|$|A large {{tropical}} wave, {{which eventually}} became Erika, moved {{off the coast}} of Africa on August 31. Shortly after leaving the coast, it displayed a large low-level circulation, though as it tracked westward, the circulation failed to contract significantly. It slowly organized, and by September 3 the convection within the circulation had sufficiently organized for the system to be classified as Tropical Depression Six, while located about 1150miles (1850km) east of the southernmost Lesser Antilles. The depression moved west-northwestward at approximately 20mph (32km/h) under the influence of <b>a</b> <b>well-established</b> subtropical ridge, and late on September 3 the system intensified into a tropical storm. At that time, the National Hurricane Center in Miami gave the storm the name of Erika.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{new game}} is set within <b>a</b> <b>well-established</b> franchise, Starbreeze tried {{to retain the}} essence of the world and rebuild these elements. The game's story was written by British science-fiction writer Richard K Morgan, whom the team {{approached}} after they read his book Altered Carbon. Syndicate was Morgan's second video-game script after 2011's Crysis 2; he used the original game for reference and included elements that those who had played it would immediately recognize. He preserved the original's dystopian setting and theme, and hoped to use these elements to build a powerful story. Morgan traveled to Sweden to meet Starbreeze's game designers to ensure the game's story would not contradict its overall design.|$|E
