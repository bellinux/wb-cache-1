5|$|Two polls {{conducted}} {{shortly after}} Schiavo's feeding tube was removed {{for the final}} time in 2005 showed that {{a large majority of}} Americans believed that Michael Schiavo should have had the authority to make decisions on behalf of his wife, Terri, and that the United States Congress overstepped its bounds with its intervention in the case. However, other polls seemed to favor the Schindler family's position, and questions were raised about the wording of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls.</b>|$|E
25|$|As <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> {{around the}} country closed at 7p.m., the first exit polls were {{published}} by the major television networks. They showed Ivo Josipović easily claiming first place, but failing to obtain an outright majority winning 32%. The polls showed Milan Bandić, Andrija Hebrang and Nadan Vidošević in a statistical tie with each of them achieving 14%, 12% and 11% respectively. Andrija Hebrang's third place {{was seen as a}} great success as most opinion polls before the first round showed him with only single-digit approval, while Nadan Vidošević's placing was seen as a disappointment since most polls before the vote showed him battling for second place with Milan Bandić. The polls predicted Vesna Pusić and Dragan Primorac would be the only other candidates to pass 5% with each of them collecting 7% and 5% respectively. In 2007, during the parliamentary election, all exit polls predicted SDP would narrowly win, when in the reality HDZ turned out as the victor. With that in mind, Andrija Hebrang expressed conviction that when actual results were published, he would overtake Bandić and qualify for second round. He claimed that exit polls do {{not take into account the}} votes coming from the citizens living abroad and that conservative voters do not participate in exit polls as much as liberal voters. However, the exit polls predicted the outcome almost perfectly as the country's electoral commission's results later confirmed.|$|E
2500|$|What {{made the}} Proposition 218 victory so unusual {{was that it}} was behind in nearly <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls,</b> {{including}} late polls before the election. [...] Polling from the Proposition 218 opposition campaign revealed the measure was expected to lose by about 15 percentage points. Proposition 218 was also significantly behind in the final Field Poll with only 36% support from likely voters. [...] Proposition 218 ended up winning by 13 percentage points. [...] The large variation between the final polling numbers and the election results was a politically rare event for statewide initiative measures in California.|$|E
5000|$|Article 29 also {{requires}} that Contracting States ensure [...] "that voting procedures, facilities and materials are appropriate, accessible {{and easy to}} understand and use."

He also requested that SADC send a security monitoring team.|$|R
50|$|This is {{especially}} useful when {{setting up a}} monitoring infrastructure {{for the first time}} and not all monitoring mechanisms have been implemented. The system monitor can do <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>polling</b> in whatever simple means are available. As the agents become smarter, they can take on more of the load.|$|R
50|$|In 1952, Batista again ran for president. In a {{three-way}} race, Roberto Agramonte of the Orthodox Party led in <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls,</b> followed by Carlos Hevia of the Authentic Party. Batista's United Action coalition {{was running a}} distant third.|$|E
50|$|Very early on, polling {{was tight}} as Obama {{was having a}} {{difficult}} time getting support from the pessimistic state. Since September 21, Obama swept <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> taken from the state. The final 3 polls averaged Obama leading 54% to 40%.|$|E
50|$|An oft-quoted {{example of}} opinion polls succumbing to errors {{occurred}} during the 1992 UK general election. Despite the polling organizations using different methodologies, virtually <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> taken before the vote, {{and to a lesser}} extent, exit polls taken on voting day, showed a lead for the opposition Labour party, but the actual vote gave a clear victory to the ruling Conservative party.|$|E

Send word by telephone to <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>polling</b> places in <b>the</b> county that the hull town has gone solid Conservative and tell them to send the same news back here.

50|$|Throughout the campaign, Roosevelt led Dewey in <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> {{by varying}} margins. On {{election}} day, the Democratic incumbent scored a fairly comfortable victory over his Republican challenger. Roosevelt took 36 states for 432 electoral votes (266 {{were needed to}} win), while Dewey won twelve states and 99 electoral votes. In the popular vote Roosevelt won 25,612,916 (53.4%) votes to Dewey's 22,017,929 (45.9%).|$|E

Kemp, the third choice of party faithful in <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls,</b> would wage a front-runner, incumbent-style campaign." [...] Kemp ultimately won no primaries.|$|E
50|$|In the 2009 Presidential Election, Lucio Gutiérrez ran for {{president}} of Ecuador under the flag of PSP. In the presidential election held on April 26, he came in second with 26.8% of the vote, losing to Rafael Correa. Lucio Gutiérrez declared election fraud even though <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> conducted well before election day gave a great advantage to Rafael Correa, and even when international observers from the European Union declared total transparency of the election process.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, a <b>poll</b> by <b>the</b> Israeli Democracy Institute {{found that}} 27% of Israeli Jews {{say that they}} keep the Sabbath, while 53% said they do not keep it at <b>all.</b> <b>The</b> <b>poll</b> also found that 50% of the {{respondents}} would give up shopping on the Sabbath as long as public transportation were kept running and leisure activities continued to be permitted; however, only 38% believed that such a compromise would reduce the tensions between the secular and religious communities.|$|R

50|$|Two polls {{conducted}} {{shortly after}} Schiavo's feeding tube was removed {{for the final}} time in 2005 showed that {{a large majority of}} Americans believed that Michael Schiavo should have had the authority to make decisions on behalf of his wife, Terri, and that the United States Congress overstepped its bounds with its intervention in the case. However, other polls seemed to favor the Schindler family's position, and questions were raised about the wording of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls.</b>|$|E
50|$|Throughout this campaign, Roosevelt {{promised that}} he would not bring the United States into any new wars if he was given another term and also promised to {{continue}} the New Deal. Willkie attacked FDR for seeking a third term and accused FDR of trying to turn the U.S. into a dictatorship by refusing to leave office. However, Willkie's attacks gained little traction, and FDR consistently led in <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> and was reelected by a large margin.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the time}} of its release, {{critical}} reception was mixed. Underground called it [...] "a real gem of a debut album" [...] and [...] "one that's sure to top <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> come the end of the year", but others were less impressed. Melody Maker were impressed with [...] "Gentle Tuesday" [...] but said [...] "the rest is not pop.

5000|$|The group, {{which became}} known as the Anti-Parnellite faction and had a larger {{membership}} than the rump of the INL that stood by Parnell under the leadership of John Redmond, was led firstly by Justin McCarthy, then by John Dillon. The INF was supported by the Catholic clergy, who strongly influenced the general elections of 1892 and 1895, and the by-elections of the period. The Irish Times reported on 23 February 1893 that [...] "the priests...swarmed at <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>polling</b> stations, and kept the voters constantly in view".|$|R
5000|$|The Organization of American States (OAS) {{observed}} the elections, and it described [...] "the electoral process in Grenada during the General Elections as extremely positive, with relatively few areas {{that could be}} improved."

50|$|Miami {{was left}} {{at the top of}} <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls,</b> and the debate began about who {{deserved}} to play in the Rose Bowl. Many felt Colorado was the hottest team in the country after dismantling Nebraska and then beating the Longhorns in the Big 12 title game, but their 2 losses {{at the beginning of the}} year were tough to ignore. Others felt Oregon deserved the honor, being ranked in some polls as the number 2 team in the country. Ultimately, after all of the upsets, Nebraska ended up as the number 2 team in the BCS, despite being the team to start all of the drama 3 weeks earlier.|$|E
5000|$|When Dewey {{considered}} {{adopting a}} more aggressive stance after noticing that his crowds were dwindling, Herbert Brownell contacted 90 GOP state committeemen and committeewomen in all 48 states. With one exception, they [...] "urged Dewey to press forward on the high road" [...] his campaign had taken and to continue to ignore Truman's attacks. The sole exception was Kansas committeeman Harry Darby, who warned Dewey and his managers [...] "that farmers were in a mutinous mood" [...] and recommended for Dewey to take a tougher and more aggressive stance. However, given that <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> still showed Dewey leading, and no other committee member supported Darby, his advice was rejected.|$|E

5000|$|Tennessee was won by Republican nominee John McCain by 15.06 {{percentage}} points. Prior to the election, 17 {{news organizations}} considered Tennessee a win for McCain. Early polling in Tennessee gave a solid edge to McCain over Democrat Barack Obama {{by up to}} a 20-point margin. The expected [...] "landslide" [...] by McCain in Tennessee meant there was little campaigning there. Most news organizations immediately called Tennessee for McCain as soon as <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> in the state closed. McCain even improved upon George W. Bush's performance in 2004, a much better year nationally for the Republicans. This {{was the first time}} since 1960 when Tennessee did not back the overall winning candidate in a presidential election.|$|E
50|$|On 13 June 2010, {{after more}} than two years of {{widespread}} speculation, Rousseff launched her campaign as the official presidential candidate for the Workers' Party in the 2010 presidential election. At that time, former São Paulo State Governor José Serra, candidate for the center-right opposition bloc, had been {{at the top of the}} polls for over two years. With promises of maintaining Lula's popular policies, Rousseff was able to surpass Serra in <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> by late July. In spite of maintaining a wide margin over him, she did not receive 50% of valid votes in the first round and had to face a run-off against Serra on 31 October, when she was elected with over 56% of the valid votes.|$|E
5000|$|In March 2006, Pflüger {{was elected}} the top {{candidate}} of the CDU for the elections in the State of Berlin in September. After spending almost no time preparing his election campaign, he lost to Klaus Wowereit of the Social Democrat Party (SPD), as <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> had indicated. Keeping his promise to remain active in Berlin politics even {{in case of an}} electoral defeat, Pflüger assumed the responsibility as the chairman of the CDU Parliamentary Group in the Berlin House of Representatives and gave up his position as a Parliamentary State Secretary. As an opposition leader, he has since then fought, unsuccessfully, against the closure of Tempelhof Airport. Another aim of his work is to create a more business-friendly environment in Berlin to reduce the high unemployment rate. Pflüger is also concerned about ecologic ways of city-development. Pflüger is an outspoken advocate of opening the CDU for a possible coalition with the Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens (a so-called [...] "Jamaica"-coalition).|$|E
50|$|Line {{managers}} generate {{around one}} third (30%) of their profit from stickers. Stickers' commercial success led many companies to add {{them in their}} business models. Path 3.0 adds two major features in 2013 to their private social network. One {{of them is the}} Shop, part of Path’s ongoing effort to monetize its app that provides stickers to their users. In April 2013, Facebook added stickers to their web chat with a Sticker Store.
