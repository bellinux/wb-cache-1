30|$|We {{have found}} that most {{respondents}} have believed that there are numerous opportunities for personal growth in their organizations and that their jobs have provided opportunities for future development.

However, they have also believed that <b>audit</b> <b>authorities</b> have not provided enough knowledge to enable them to share auditing experiences and educational training. Auditors must share knowledge and expertise on industry-specific trends with members of the audit team as well as their accounting, auditing, and regulatory concerns that may influence the performance and outcome of an audit.

40|$|The {{research}} has three objectives. The {{first is to}} investigate the extent of publishing delay and its determinants in Libya. The second {{is to find out}} how useful the annual report is to five user groups in Libya namely the Tax Authority, Academics, Auditors, Banks and the <b>Auditing</b> <b>Authority.</b> Finally, the research also seeks to determine the impact publishing delay has on banks, Tax and Auditing Authorities. A sample of 33 companies over two year period was used {{to determine the extent of}} publishing delay and its determinants. The results indicate that the average publishing delay is 154. 86 days. The results of the ordinary least square regression analysis indicate that company size, profitability, company age, number of accountants, accountant qualification, and audit opinion are significantly associated with publishing delay. However, the type of accounting system is not associated with publishing delay. The results of the usefulness of the annual report indicate that the balance sheet is regarded as the most important followed by the profit and loss account, auditors' report, management report and the funds flow statement. The results also suggest that there are significant differences in the perceived usefulness of 'on-time' and 'late' annual reports in terms of predictive value, confirmatory value and faithful representation. The results of the impact of the publishing delay on banks, Tax authority and Auditing authorities are as follows. Loans advanced by banks on the basis of 'on-time' annual reports are more likely to be repaid than those made on the basis of 'late' annual reports. The Tax Authority collect less revenue from companies whose annual reports are produced late compared to those whose annual reports are produced on time and <b>Auditing</b> <b>Authority</b> is more likely to issue a qualified audit report if the annual report is produced late compared to one produced 'on-time'. The results have important implication for the Libyan Authorities in terms of what actions they should take to reduce the publishing delay. Reduction in publishing delay is likely to increase the usefulness of the annual report and reduce the impact the delay is having on banks, Tax and <b>Auditing</b> <b>Authority.</b> ...|$|E

30|$|To improve {{communication}} among <b>audited</b> units, <b>audit</b> <b>authorities</b> {{should understand that}} reprimanding people or challenging policies is not {{the main purpose of}} a performance audit. Auditors should focus on the outcomes of a policy to obtain insightful results and recommendations for governing without interfering with the executive branches. Therefore, <b>audit</b> <b>authorities</b> can positively affect society by increasing the economic value of audited units. Because the main aim of a performance audit is to improve government performance, <b>audit</b> <b>authorities</b> should strive to develop collaborative partnerships with the executive and legislative branches in enhancing governance. Audit leaders should recognize that developing cooperative goals among team members is essential for reinforcing these values and ensuring the credibility. Our study has showed that the evaluation, performance, and value of outputs and outcomes have evidently relied on auditors’ self-efficacy. Auditors should maintain a strong and professional relationship with audited units, enabling them to appropriately communicate audit results, thereby effectively improving governing performance. According to the mission statement of the American Accounting Association, the auditing profession should “foster excellence in the teaching, research, and practice of auditing and assurance services.” Accordingly, the core competencies of auditors are as follows: (a) communication ability and leadership for inspiring people to achieve common goals; (b) the ability to conduct comprehensive financial analyses, provide insight, and offer constructive recommendations; and (c) an awareness of new technological trends and the ability to apply advanced technology to increase client and employee value. <b>Audit</b> <b>authorities</b> should operate on the basis of public governance perspectives and focus on regulatory and performance auditing to ensure that the executive branches utilizes the allocated funds legally, enabling it to economically and efficiently achieve the set goals.|$|R
40|$|The Republic of Austria is {{politically}} organized into federative states which each {{have their own}} separate auditing systems. The Court of Audit (COA) is the central <b>auditing</b> <b>authority</b> {{at the federal level}} and {{is by far the most}} important auditing institution in Austria. Nonetheless, one cannot find much literature on it- at least from an economic point of view. In the past, the Austrian public administration has been pressed into the stays of inflexible procedures and dominated by lawyers to a great extent. These facts tend to repress economic considerations from being made to improve the system, and hence prevent substantial institutional reforms from being adopted. The two standard monographs written on the COA by Hoenig (1951) and Hengstschlaeger (1982) are utterly legal treatises, though Hengstschlaeger repeatedly points to relevant economic questions. In the 1980 s the number of publications on public sector auditing has increased markedly. Only in recent years were the studies in public sector auditing based on economic considerations arising from questions of public purposes, factors of inefficiency and systematic methods of enhancing efficiency (Andreae and Mitteregger 1984, Henseler 1986, Schwab 1987 and 1988). Hence, the described state of research in central auditing in Austria requires further and closer economic investigations. The purpose of this treatise is fivefold: First we demonstrate the potential and importance of central auditing in Austria in section 2. 1 before identifying the causes of public sector inefficiency in section 2. 2. Then we outline the organizational structure in section 3, and describe how the system functions practically in section 4. On this basis we develop proposals for improving the central auditing system, as presented in section 5. In so doing, we endeavor not t...|$|E
40|$|The {{world is}} {{threatened}} {{by the possibility of}} an irreversible catastrophe that many would blame on the environmental impact of the present lifestyle, the results of which are climate change or global warming. This is clearly unacceptable to both present and future generations. If going green really means changing the way we live and pursuing knowledge and practices that can lead to more environmentally friendly and socio-ecologically responsible decisions, it is time to protect the environment and sustain its natural resources for current and future generations. Integrated sustainability reporting should be viewed as a vehicle to accomplish this global agenda of going green beyond mere legal requirements. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the impact of integrated sustainability reporting (ISR) on achieving green business status within JSE listed companies. To achieve the purpose, an in-depth literature study and empirical research were undertaken using a triangulation method. After a detailed descriptive and content analysis of the collected primary and secondary data, the study found the following: Most of the JSE listed corporations’ integrated reports are not utilising the CSR, GRI guidelines and voluntary standards as effective tools to drive the process of green sustainable business. Some of the JSE listed organisations are treating financial and non-financial matters as separate issues in their integrated reports; The ISR has no impact in terms of using the NEMA framework in driving the process of green sustainable business in the JSE listed organisations; Most of the JSE listed organisations were fully aware of ecological sustainability as a pillar to drive the process of green sustainable business. They treat this pillar of sustainable development as a separate entity from socio-economic developmental issues. Most of the JSE listed corporations adhere to all the bylaws and regulations of ecological sustainability within their required certification of ISO 14001 standards in order to remain effectively certified by the <b>auditing</b> <b>authority.</b> Some integrated reports indicated much support for staff in terms of health, educational activities, labour laws and programmes that advance the socio-economic aspects of human beings; The study has found that the social pillar of sustainability is mostly supported by JSE listed organisations in South Africa - to the level of the requirements of labour relations legislation. It is not integrated with sustainability policies beyond the statutory requirements; It was further noticed in this study that integrated sustainability reports, based on the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) principles and the King III reporting guidelines, disclose outcomes and results regarding the JSE listed organisations’ obligations, strategy and management approach which occurred within the reporting period. To address the above-listed findings, the researcher recommended that the JSE listed organisations integrate the NEMA, EMS, CSR, GRI and King III guidelines in their integrated sustainability reporting, in order to produce an effective sustainable green business in South Africa that is ecologically accountable and socio-economically supportive to all multi-stakeholders. The government and non-governmental organisations are the key players to drive the process of going green using the ISR. The government needs more structured policies and regulations that will support the National Development Plan in the pursuit of green economy in the form of grants and incentives that are beyond the present status quo...|$|E
30|$|We {{have found}} that {{auditors}} generally have {{a positive attitude toward}} their professional abilities and experience, confirming the view that experience can increase self-efficacy. Self-efficacy obviously depends on past successful experiences, also known as mastery experiences (Bandura 1986). More importantly, achievements foster self-efficacy only when individuals ascribe these successes to their own personal effort or ability (Tolli and Schmidt 2008). In the “intrinsic motivation” section of the survey, “My work provides opportunities to learn new knowledge” (3.94) has exhibited the most agreement. The results have revealed that most of the respondents have believed that numerous opportunities are available for personal growth within their organizations, probably because of the diverse jobs available in auditing. This is because auditors are routinely assigned tasks that vary in complexity and industry. Job enrichment provides a sense of control over one’s work environment and motivates people to exercise their full potential, thus presenting more opportunities for employee success. However, in the “organization culture” section, “My organization has adequate knowledge resources” (3.31) has lower score. The respondents have perceived that <b>audit</b> <b>authorities</b> have not provided adequate knowledge resources. <b>Audit</b> <b>authorities</b> must create, integrate, share, and use knowledge regarding their clients’ control activities and corporate governance.
