40|$|Aims. This paper {{presents}} {{a discussion of}} the use of 'therapeutic emplotment' during health professional-patient interactions when caring for patients with a long-term illness, with implications for nursing. Background. 'Therapeutic emplotment' develops from two philosophical strains: one emphasizing the connection of speech to actions, the other the linguistically mediated nature of human experience. Mattingly defines therapeutic emplotment as the creation of story-like structures through therapist-patient interactions which encourage the patient to see therapy as integral to healing. Data Sources. A literature search for the period 1994 - 2010 was undertaken using the keywords therapeutic emplotment, chronic illness, illness narratives, nursing narratives and nurse-patient interaction in the following databases: CINAHL, MEDLINE, COCHRANE, Social Care online, PsycInfo and <b>AnthroSource.</b> Reference lists of papers and books were examined for relevant studies published before 1994. Discussion. Differing from other social scientists, Mattingly highlights potential of narratives to create experiences in clinical practice. With therapeutic emplotment, narratives become 'tools' in the hands of health professionals to shape the interaction with patients with a long-term illness and are constructed by them together. This introduces changes in the way health professionals, including nurses, look at their practice. Implications for nursing. Therapeutic emplotment may provide nurses with a way of improving communication and relationship skills to help patients reach therapeutic goals; its use may also help qualitative research that explores the impact of nurses' interactions with patients on the quality of care. Conclusion. Therapeutic emplotment may be used by a broader range of health professionals, including nurses, for clinical and research purposes. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Reproduced with kind {{permission}} of the publisher. Â© by the Regents of the University of California. Available on Caliber ([URL] and <b>AnthroSource</b> ([URL] Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus (1707 - 1778) is reputed to have transformed botanical practice by shunning the process of illustrating plants and relying on the primacy of literary descriptions of plant specimens. Botanists and historians have long debated Linnaeus's capacities as a draftsman. While some of his detailed sketches of plants and insects reveal a sure hand, his more general drawings of landscapes and people seem ill-executed. The overwhelming consensus, based mostly on his Lapland diary (1732), is that Linnaeus could not draw. Little has been said, however, {{on the role of}} drawing and other visual representations in Linnaeus's daily work as seen in his other numerous manuscripts. These manuscripts, held mostly at the Linnean Society of London, are peppered with sketches, maps, tables, and diagrams. Reassessing these manuscripts, along with the printed works that also contain illustrations of plant species, shows that Linnaeus's thinking was profoundly visual and that he routinely used visual representational devices in his various publications. This paper aims to explore the full range of visual representations Linnaeus used through his working life, and to reevaluate the epistemological value of visualization in the making of natural knowledge. By analyzing Linnaeus's use of drawings, maps, tables, and diagrams, I will show that he did not, as has been asserted, reduce the discipline of botany to text, and that his visual thinking played a fundamental role in his construction of new systems of classification...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background A {{legacy of}} colonial rule {{coupled with a}} devastating 16 -year civil war through 1992 left Mozambique {{economically}} impoverished just as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic swept over southern Africa in the late 1980 s. The crumbling Mozambican health care system was wholly inadequate to support {{the need for new}} chronic disease services for people with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Methods To review the unique challenges faced by Mozambique as they have attempted to stem the HIV epidemic, we undertook a systematic literature review through multiple search engines (PubMed, Google Scholar™, SSRN, AnthropologyPlus, <b>AnthroSource)</b> using Mozambique as a required keyword. We searched for any articles that included the required keyword as well as the terms 'HIV' and/or 'AIDS', 'prevalence', 'behaviors', 'knowledge', 'attitudes', 'perceptions', 'prevention', 'gender', drugs, alcohol, and/or 'health care infrastructure'. Results UNAIDS 2008 prevalence estimates ranked Mozambique as the 8 th most HIV-afflicted nation globally. In 2007, measured HIV prevalence in 36 antenatal clinic sites ranged from 3 % to 35 %; the national estimate of was 16 %. Evidence suggests that the Mozambican HIV epidemic is characterized by a preponderance of heterosexual infections, among the world's most severe health worker shortages, relatively poor knowledge of HIV/AIDS in the general population, and lagging access to HIV preventive and therapeutic services compared to counterpart nations in southern Africa. Poor education systems, high levels of poverty and gender inequality further exacerbate HIV incidence. Conclusions Recommendations to reduce HIV incidence and AIDS mortality rates in Mozambique include: health system strengthening, rural outreach to increase testing and linkage to care, education about risk reduction and drug adherence, and partnerships with traditional healers and midwives to effect a lessening of stigma. </p...|$|E
40|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) {{requested}} a Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) literature review of countries {{impacted by the}} Ebola virus, including Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. International Medical Corps {{expressed an interest in}} completing the review for Guinea and commissioned a rigorous review of the literature on pre-existing information relevant to mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) in Guinea, in the French and English languages. This report presents the findings using an integrated psychological and anthropological framework that is instrumental in understanding MHPSS needs, and how to devise culturally-appropriate MHPSS interventions in Ebola-affected areas. The report outlines the key findings of the existing academic and grey literature related to Guinean mental health and psychosocial issues and services, with a specific emphasis on the recent Ebola humanitarian crisis. The review was conducted in June-July 2015 and identified relevant academic publications using academic search engines and databases (Google scholar, Medline, Pubmed, PSYCHinfo, APA psycNET, and <b>Anthrosource).</b> The search was extended through manual searches on Google in French and English, and in the journals: Social Science and Medicine; Culture, Medicine, and Psychiatry, Transcultural Psychiatry; and Medical Anthropology. Researchers with relevant expert knowledge were also consulted. The overall search identified academic sources, but also relevant reports, policy documents and internet resources. The report introduces general background information regarding the population of Guinea, its religions, history, politics, economics and health. It subsequently summarizes information on mental health and psychosocial issues including prevalence, local nosologies, help seeking strategies, formal and informal resources of MHPSS sources of support. There is discussion {{of the ways in which}} causes and course of illness and misfortune are intertwined with plural cosmologies and with individuals’ relationships with the living, the dead, the spirit world, and nature itself. Finally, the humanitarian crisis of Ebola in Guinea is explored, alongside responses to it, and its social and psychological ramifications for the affected population. The scholarly and grey literature available on MHPSS specifically in Guinea was limited and thinly spread over many documents. This presented a challenge when writing this report and we acknowledge that there may have been further relevant material to be found in sources that did not focus specifically on MHPSS, but which it was not possible to obtain within the timescale of the review. Nonetheless, we hope the report can provide useful insights for policy-makers, donors, governments and service-providers...|$|E
