In these studies, we have characterized the interaction of AGE-protein with mouse peritoneal macrophages, using AGE-modified bovine serum albumin (AGE-BSA, prepared by incubation with glucose) as a probe. AGE-BSA was specifically bound to cells at 4 degrees C and was taken up and degraded at 37 degrees C; these processes were concentration dependent and saturable. Competition experiments with AGE-BSA, BSA incubated with phosphate-buffered saline rather than glucose, and yeast mannan demonstrated that macrophages specifically recognize AGE on proteins by a receptor that is completely distinct from the mannose/fucose receptor. Scatchard analysis of AGE-BSA binding data indicated that there are approximately 1. 06 X 10 (5) receptors per macrophage, with an affinity constant of 1. 75 X 10 (- 11) M. Specific binding of AGE-BSA to the macrophage receptor was competitively inhibited by BSA that had been chemically coupled to a synthetic analogue of the specific AGE, 2 -(2 -furoyl) - 4 (5) -(2 -furanyl) - 1 H-imidazole (FFI-BSA). FFI-BSA was also taken up by macrophages in a concentration-dependent, saturable manner. Prior incubation of macrophages with AGE-BSA failed to influence the subsequent uptake and degradation of added AGE-BSA. Thus, the AGE receptor {{does not appear to be}} down-regulated by exposure to AGE-proteins.

The aim {{of the work is}} to develop the  effective management of organisational and economic aspects of the production potential of a construction organisation in an unstable economic environment. Methods. As a methodological basis for the study, principles of situational management of complex socio-economic systems and  means of calculating the efficiency of production potential loading of  construction organisation are employed {{on the basis of the}} ratio of  production activity financial results to the costs of input factors introduced into the production process. Results. The necessity for managing the production potential of the construction organisation and its goals are substantiated. The rules  are systematised, allowing organisational-economic and  organisational- technical management measures to be promptly  identified on a situational basis, these being the most effective in the current economic situation SE to eliminate the differences between  the situations ST and SC. The set of such inference rules for each element of the production potential of the construction organisation  ai, i = 1, 2, [...] ., 5 will determine the situational model for managing  the production potential of the construction organisation in various  situations SjE, the economic environment for which the actual or  desired model of the state of its production potential form a  reference.

40|$|Objective: HIV- 1 {{infection}} {{is associated with}} an increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Advanced glycation end products are formed as stable markers of glycaemic and oxidative stress. Skin autofluorescence (SAF) as marker of <b>accumulated</b> <b>advanced</b> glycation end products is increased and predictive of CVD events in diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and preexisting CVD. We determined SAF levels in HIV- 1 infected patients, testing the hypothesis that SAF predicts CVD events in HIV infection. Design: Single-centre prospective cohort study. Methods: In 2010 - 2011, SAF was measured in 91 patients. Development of CVD events was monitored during a median follow-up of 4. 8 years. SAF values of the patients were expressed as a ratio (rSAF) to expected SAF levels in age-matched healthy volunteers. Results: Seventy-nine men and 12 women were included, mean age 47 years; 81 patients were on combination antiretroviral therapy. With a mean rSAF of 1. 155, SAF levels in patients were 15. 5 % higher than predicted for their age (95 % confidence interval, 10. 0 - 20. 0; P< 0. 001). In multivariate regression analysis, rSAF was associated with nadir CD 4 (+) cell count less than 200 cells/mu l (beta = 0. 274; P = 0. 01), smoking (beta 0. 240; P = 0. 03), and {{men who have sex with}} men (MSM) (beta 0. 202; P = 0. 07). CVD events occurred in six patients (7 %). In Cox regression analysis including age, SAF, smoking, diabetes, hypertension and CKD, SAF (P = 0. 01), and (Wet Medischwetenschappelijk Onderzoek met mensen; WMO) CKD (P = 0. 03) remained as independent predictors of CVD events. Conclusion: SAF is increased in HIV-infected patients, and related with smoking, low nadir CD 4 (+) cell count, and MSM. Larger studies are needed to confirm whether SAF is an independent predictor of CVD events. Copyright (C) 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|We here {{report for}} the first time on the {{chemical}} characteristics of proteoglycans associated with mouse splenic reactive AA amyloid. Amyloid was induced in CBA/J mice by two different procedures; conventional casein treatment and by employing Freund's complete adjuvant, accelerated by Trypan Blue. Pulse-labelling was employed at distinct stages during amyloid development, followed by [35 S]proteoglycan characterization of organ extracts. Repetitive 35 S injections were also administered during the phase where amyloid deposition occurred most rapidly. Proteoglycans were extracted with guanidine in the presence of protease inhibitors and purified. The results showed that the production of proteoglycans is dramatically enhanced during amyloidogenesis, the glycosaminoglycan and proteoglycan accumulation being not only dependent on alterations in proteoglycan catabolism, but rather on increased synthesis. The increment could be demonstrated even at the stage before microscopic detection of amyloid deposits, clearly suggesting that the upregulation of proteoglycan expression precedes amyloid fibril formation. Two major proteoglycans were found to <b>accumulate</b> in <b>advanced</b> splenic amyloid; one a heparan sulphate proteoglycan of approx. 200 kDa with a core protein of 70 kDa, the other a chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan of smaller size.

40|$|Modern {{high-resolution}} {{mass spectrometry}} (HRMS) enables full-spectrum trace level analysis of emerging environmental organic contaminants. This raises {{the opportunity for}} post-acquisition suspect screening when no reference standards are a priori available. When setting up a conventional screening identification train based on successively different identification criteria including mass error and isotope fit, the false negative rate typically <b>accumulates</b> upon <b>advancing</b> through the decision tree. The challenge is thus to elaborate a well-balanced screening, in which the different criteria are equally stringent, leading to a controllable number of false negatives. Presented is a novel suspect screening approach using liquid-chromatography Orbitrap HRMS. Based on a multivariate statistical model, the screening {{takes into account the}} accurate mass error of the mono isotopic ion and up to three isotopes, isotope ratios, and a peak/noise filter. As such, for the first time, controlling the overall false negative rate of the screening algorithm to a desired level (5 % in this study) is achieved.

Furthermore, several {{studies have shown that}} expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is elevated in patients with OA. ObjectivesThe aim of our study is to correlate the presence of SBCs and MMP- 1 expression with the osteochondral alterations during OA progression. MethodsWe studied the cartilage and subchondral bone of 15 patients who had undergone total knee or hip replacement due to primary OA. As controls, we used the femoral heads of three patients without macroscopic OA changes. We evaluated three specimens per patient. ResultsSpecimens were divided in four groups based on the Mankin histological severity score. Using immunohistochemistry, we noted SBCs at the site of greatest disease severity. Specifically, these were present more frequently in group III (Mankin score: 6 – 7) and IV (Mankin: ≥ 8), compared with group I (Mankin: 1 – 3) and II (Mankin: 4 – 5). Mild OA stages (Mankin: 1 – 6) were characterized by degeneration and thinning of the cartilage, followed by increased osteoblast and osteoclast activity of the subjacent bone and the subsequent appearance of SBCs. Simultaneously, we observed expression of MMP- 1 in groups I and II in the cartilage and III and IV in both the cartilage and the subchondral bone. Moreover, osteoblast-like cells in the lining of the SBCs showed an increased expression of MMP- 1 in stages III and IV. ConclusionOur study provides immunohistological evidence that SBCs <b>accumulate</b> in <b>advanced</b> OA and contain activated cells, which express MMP- 1, suggesting that they may thus participate in the osteochondral changes of OA.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} intertemporal relation between money and taxation from several perspectives. ^ The first essay explores the quantitative macroeconomic effects of monetary taxation [...] {{the fact that}} money is the required means of taxation payment. Based on three model economies exhibiting growth in their deterministic steady states, it shows that inflation has greater effects on growth and welfare than those found in existing monetary models. Inflation reduces directly the net-of-all-tax real {{rate of return on}} investment. At business cycle frequencies, monetary taxation does not cause a deterioration in the ability of the model to mimic key aspects of U. S. fluctuations; but it does not match the correlation of hours worked and productivity and the relative volatility of hours. The essay provides a 2 ̆ 2 monetary 2 ̆ 2 solution to these anomalies with the introduction of a liquidity effect. ^ The second essay extends from a theoretical viewpoint the standard cash-in-advance framework by integrating the fiscal sector. Its distinctive characteristic is that taxes have to be paid with fiat money <b>accumulated</b> in <b>advance.</b> The effect of taxes on asset pricing and velocity of money is studied when this tax payment technology is imposed. Also, tax incidence in a monetary economy is considered through the effect of tax reforms and fluctuations in uncertainty about future tax reforms on asset prices. ^ The last essay specializes, derives the empirical implications, and tests a model of optimal government financial behavior. To finance its expenditures, a government is assumed to follow a financing policy in which taxes, central bank credit, and revenues obtained from the price costs brought about by the use of distortionary taxation. If inflation, devaluation and tax rates are explained by this theory, these variables must exhibit some intra and intertemporal properties. Theory predicts that they must follow stochastic nonstationary processes, covary positively {{with each other and with}} the government expenditure rate. Evidence from Colombia showed that all the implications were valid. The long-run behavior of these time series is determined by the government 2 ̆ 7 s financing needs. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} banks in influencing innovation and analyses their links to payment systems modernisation. The main argument is that banks are a type of technological institution having the potential to promote innovation, although such roles may be implicit or secondary. This role is investigated in eight chapters. The first three chapters review the major innovation models and progress in payment system. An analytical framework, based on evolutionary and resource-based views, is developed to examine how resources and routines which reflect an organisation's stock of skills, influence innovation, and assist them in sustaining competitive advantage. The following three chapters present the empirical results. In a survey of innovation in the banking industry, research results suggested that although there were relatively high levels of information technology awareness and application, particularly in payment system automation, there remained a moderate level of innovative capabilities among the banks studied. Further analysis through four mini case studies of the largest commercial banks also suggested similar increases in technological investments, but replication rates were also relatively high. Thus, {{it is argued that}} such investments may gain, but not sustain, competitive advantage, whereby the latter requires banks to innovate by acquiring, <b>accumulating,</b> and <b>advancing</b> their stock of skills. In this respect, the role of the central bank in creating a conducive environment for innovation is also important which may be seen through its involvement in payment systems modernisation. The final two chapters discuss the policy and research implications. It is argued that central bank policies oriented towards payment system reform, along with new payment product and services development by commercial banks, have come to play an important part in promoting technological innovation in banking. Such roles in reforming rudimentary payment systems have helped strengthen national information infrastructures, especially in emerging market economies, and moreover, have influenced the set-up of a national innovation system in banking which underpins economic development...|$|R
40|$|Ninety-three primary {{malignant}} melanomas of {{the skin}} were typed immunohistologically {{for the expression of}} HLA-DR on tumor cells, HLA-DR-positive stroma cells were found in all specimens, whereas the melanoma cells were HLA-DR-negative or only locally positive in most cases. In 36 (39 %) of the lesions more than 10 % of the tumor cells were stained by two monoclonal antibodies against the nonpolymorphic portion of HLA-DR. HLA-DR-positive tumor cells were often <b>accumulated</b> at the <b>advancing</b> front of the melanoma. The occurrence of HLA-DR-positive tumor cells was related to tumor thickness and level of invasion, Substantial numbers of HLA-DR-positive tumor cells were found in half of the tumors thicker than 1. 5 mm and in only 18 % of flatter lesions. The highest percentage of HLA-DR-positive tumors was found in the group of melanomas invading the reticular dermis (level IV). The majority of tumors (18 / 24) that had metastasized within an observation period of 0 – 32 months were HLA-DR-positive. Regarding the mononuclear cell infiltrate, no correlation between the degree of overall infiltrate and the expression of HLA-DR by the tumor cells was found. The infiltrate within the tumor, however, was more often marked in HLA-DR-positive than in HLA-DR-negative melanomas...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, many {{countries}} have been adopting multi-pillar old age security systems that include a substantial role for a privately managed fully funded (FF) defined contribution (DC) pillar, accompanied by a publicly managed tax financed defined benefit (DB) pillar to redistribute to low earners. Many other countries are currently contemplating such a switch. This contrasts with traditional systems which rely on a single public pay-as-you-go (PAYG) DB pillar. In a PAYG DB plan the benefits are defined in advance, usually based on years of contributions and average earnings during {{some part of the}} lifetime, and are financed through payroll taxes; tax rates change through time to cover the benefits promised to today’s pensioners. In a DC plan the contributions are defined in <b>advance,</b> <b>accumulated</b> and invested, but the benefit is uncertain. When workers retire they get an annuity that depends on their lifetime contributions plus their investment earnings. This special issue of Annals presents case studies of several Latin American and OECD countries that have reformed their systems, in an attempt to explain why they made this decision, how they selected the particular forms for their first and second pillars, what old problems this solved and what new problems were created. Besides summarizing these case studies, this overview draws on other evidence to evaluate the reforms and the political economy factors involved...|$|R
