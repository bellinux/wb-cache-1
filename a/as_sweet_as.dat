25|$|Acesulfame {{potassium}} (Ace-K) is 200 times {{sweeter than}} sucrose (common sugar), <b>as</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>as</b> aspartame, about two thirds <b>as</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>as</b> saccharin, and one third <b>as</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>as</b> sucralose. Like saccharin, {{it has a}} slightly bitter aftertaste, especially at high concentrations. Kraft Foods has patented the use of sodium ferulate to mask acesulfame's aftertaste. Acesulfame potassium is often blended with other sweeteners (usually aspartame or sucralose), which give a more sucrose-like taste, whereby each sweetener masks the other's aftertaste and also exhibits a synergistic effect in which the blend is sweeter than its components.|$|E
25|$|Sorbitol is a sugar substitute, {{and when}} used in food it has the INS number and E number 420. Sorbitol is about 60% <b>as</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>as</b> sucrose (table sugar).|$|E
25|$|As for the {{assignment}} of 1 or 100 to the index substances, this makes no difference to the rankings themselves, only to whether the values are displayed as whole numbers or decimal points.

25|$|An {{alternative}} {{explanation for}} the company's decline in sales was that soda fountain operators (also called soda jerks) would give extra blasts of the syrup into the glass before adding the soda water. As Moxie was not <b>as</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>as</b> Coke or Dr. Pepper, this would not produce as delicious a refreshment.|$|E
25|$|Hort16A is {{a golden}} kiwifruit marketed {{worldwide}} in decreasing volumes because this variety suffered significant losses in New Zealand from late 2010 to 2013 {{due to the}} PSA bacterium. A new variety of golden kiwifruit, 'Gold3', {{has been found to}} be more disease-resistant and most growers have now grafted over to this variety. The Gold3 variety, marketed by Zespri as 'SunGold', is not quite <b>as</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>as</b> the previous Hort16A, with a hint of tanginess, and lacks the Hort16A's usually slightly pointy tip.|$|E
25|$|Instead {{of taking}} nectar, bees can take honeydew, the sweet {{secretions}} of aphids or other plant sap-sucking insects. Honeydew honey is very dark brown in color, {{with a rich}} fragrance of stewed fruit or fig jam, and is not <b>as</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>as</b> nectar honeys. Germany's Black Forest is a well known source of honeydew-based honeys, {{as well as some}} regions in Bulgaria, Tara (mountain) in Serbia, and Northern California in the United States. In Greece, pine honey (a type of honeydew honey) constitutes 60–65% of the annual honey production. Honeydew honey is popular in some areas, but in other areas, beekeepers have difficulty selling the stronger-flavored product.|$|E

25|$|Apart from sugar of lead (used as a {{sweetener}} {{in ancient}} through medieval times before the toxicity of lead was known), saccharin {{was the first}} artificial sweetener and was originally synthesized in 1879 by Remsen and Fahlberg. Its sweet taste was discovered by accident. It had been created in an experiment with toluene derivatives. A process {{for the creation of}} saccharin from phthalic anhydride was developed in 1950, and, currently, saccharin is created by this process as well as the original process by which it was discovered. It is 300 to 500 times <b>as</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>as</b> sugar (sucrose) and is often used to improve the taste of toothpastes, dietary foods, and dietary beverages. The bitter aftertaste of saccharin is often minimized by blending it with other sweeteners.|$|E

500|$|Irish whiskey, as {{researched}} in 2009 by the CNBC American broadcaster, remains popular {{domestically and}} {{has grown in}} international sales steadily over a few decades. Typically CNBC states Irish whiskey is not as smoky as a Scotch whisky, but not <b>as</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>as</b> American or Canadian whiskies. Whiskey forms the basis of traditional cream liqueurs, such as Baileys, and the [...] "Irish coffee" [...] (a cocktail of coffee and whiskey reputedly invented at Foynes flying-boat station) is probably the best-known Irish cocktail.|$|E

500|$|From his {{relationship}} with Connie, Sam moved on to a love triangle storyline with Ward Sisters Faye Morton and Chrissie Williams. Kensit said of the relationship in August 2007, as the storyline was ongoing: [...] "For Faye, Sam is not Mr Right, simply Mr Right Now. [...] But Faye is not <b>as</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>as</b> she looks - there's a streak of toughness there... It's all going to get very messy!" [...] Once his deception was uncovered, Sam attempted to salvage his romantic relationship with Chrissie, but was unsuccessful. For some weeks thereafter, Sam engaged in casual sexual relationships with Senior house officer Maddy Young and Staff Nurse Zoe Foxe. These were, however, stymied by the discovery he had cancer.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{were also}} divided about the game's {{graphics}} and pacing. Destructoid stated that [...] "while detailed, most environments alternate between concrete gray and brick red." [...] GameSpot echoed {{criticism of the}} [...] "lack of visual variety." [...] IGN added that [...] "the world map and dungeons are crying for more detail." [...] Despite this, Destructoid allowed that [...] "the colorful clothing helps offset the game's otherwise limited palette." [...] IGN disliked the fact that [...] "large difficulty spikes are interjected every now and then" [...] and [...] "Resonance of Fate is built for those that enjoy the grind." [...] In contrast, the GameSpot reviewer liked {{this aspect of the}} game, [...] "You need to use every trick you have learned, and a few you may not have even realized yet, to tackle these treacherous monsters, but there is nothing quite <b>as</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>as</b> toppling something that has tormented you for so long." ...|$|E
500|$|The title song, [...] "Tupelo Honey", is {{a classic}} love ballad in a vein {{established}} with [...] "Crazy Love" [...] from the album Moondance. The two songs both have the same melody, chord progression and are in 4/4 time. [...] Uncut reviewer David Cavanagh wrote that: [...] "On an album where the vocals are exultant to say the least, this song sees Morrison use larynx, diaphragm, teeth and tongue {{to find new ways}} of enunciating the lines 'she's <b>as</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>as</b> Tupelo honey' and 'she's all right with me', seemingly in ever-increasing adoration." [...] Bob Dylan (who performed the song with Morrison during a concert tour in the 1990s) once remarked that [...] "'Tupelo Honey' has always existed and that Morrison was merely the vessel and the earthly vehicle for it". Greil Marcus called the song [...] "a kind of odyssey" [...] evoking Elvis Presley (whose hometown was Tupelo, Mississippi), and [...] "the most gorgeous number on the album" [...] that [...] "was too good not to be true." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{flashback}} episode [...] "What Lies Beneath", exploring Faye's {{decision to}} move to Holby, she is seen to fight with her husband James, then later step over his dead body on the stairs. Kensit explained: [...] "there's a scuffle and he pins her {{against the wall and}} practically tries to rape her. He ends up dead. It's the way she deals with it — she coolly steps over his body and leaves. It turns out similar things have happened before." [...] Shortly after arriving in Holby, the character began a relationship with cardiothoracic registrar Sam Strachan (Tom Chambers). The situation soon escalated into a love triangle, with Sam reigniting his former relationship with Faye's colleague, Matron Chrissie Williams. Kensit said of the relationship in August 2007, as the storyline was ongoing: [...] "For Faye, Sam is not Mr Right, simply Mr Right Now. But Faye is not <b>as</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>as</b> she looks - there's a streak of toughness there... It's all going to get very messy!" [...] Upon discovering Sam's infidelity, the character terminated their relationship, and became involved with his colleague Joseph Byrne.|$|E

2500|$|Sucralose is an {{artificial}} sweetener and sugar substitute. The majority of ingested sucralose is not {{broken down by}} the body, so it is noncaloric. In the European Union, it is also known under the E number E955. Sucralose is about 320 to 1,000 times sweeter than sucrose, three times <b>as</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>as</b> both aspartame and [...] acesulfame potassium, and twice <b>as</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>as</b> sodium saccharin.

2500|$|Sodium Saccharin (benzoic sulfimide) is an {{artificial}} sweetener with effectively no food energy {{that is about}} 300–400 times <b>as</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>as</b> sucrose but has a bitter or metallic aftertaste, especially at high concentrations.
