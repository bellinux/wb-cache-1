5|$|Unable to earn <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>living</b> in the village, Harihar {{travels to}} the city to seek a better job. He {{promises}} Sarbajaya that he will return with money to repair their dilapidated house. During his absence, the family sinks deeper into poverty. Sarbajaya grows increasingly lonely and bitter. One day during the monsoon season, Durga plays in the downpour for too long, catches a cold and develops a high fever. Adequate medical care being unavailable, the fever becomes worse, and on a night of incessant rain and gusty winds, she dies. Harihar returns home and starts to show Sarbajaya the merchandise he has brought from the city. Sarbajaya, who remains silent, breaks down at the feet of her husband, and Harihar cries out in grief as he discovers that he has lost his daughter. The family decide to leave their ancestral home. As they start packing, Apu finds the necklace that Durga had earlier denied stealing; he throws it into a pond. Apu and his parents leave the village on an ox-cart.|$|E

Jefferson gave the Hemings family special treatment: the three boys while young had very light household duties.

25|$|Richard King (1824–1885) was a river pilot, born in New York City to Irish immigrants. He was indentured to {{a jeweler}} at age 11, but later ran to sea, {{eventually}} attaining a pilot's rating. In 1843, King first met his future business {{partner in the}} King Ranch, Mifflin Kenedy (1818–1895), captain of the steamboat Champion. Both served under General Zachary Taylor, operating steamboats from Brazos Santiago Harbor to Matamoros, and on up river to Camargo, Tamaulipas, {{in support of the}} U.S. invasion of Monterrey and Saltillo. After the Mexican War, King made <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>living</b> hauling merchandise on the Rio Grande, as far up river as Camargo, and Rio Grande City. In the meantime, Kenedy was able to make money by carrying goods overland into Mexico. By March 1, 1850, King, Kenedy, Charles Stillman, founder of Brownsville, and James O'Donnell entered into a business partnership (M. Kenedy & Co.) to transport Stillman's goods from Brazos Santiago Harbor on the Gulf of Mexico and up the Rio Grande. The enterprise required two types of steamers — the Grampus and Comanche. During the American Civil War, the steamboat fleet was reflagged under the name of the Matamoros, Mexico citizen Francisco Iturria and the Mexican flag. As Mexico was a neutral country, the steamboats could not be stopped by Union blockaders, and engaged in a lively commerce of transporting Texas cotton to many deep-water ships anchored offshore Matamoros, on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande. Stillman sold his share of the enterprise after the Civil War; the new firm operated as King, Kenedy & Co. until 1874.|$|E

Mirkin found the experience to be monotonous and unenjoyable and chose to abandon this career path. He decided that [...] "making no money doing something I loved was going to be better than making <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>living</b> doing something I didn't", so took [...] "an enormous chance on show business" [...] and moved to Los Angeles.
