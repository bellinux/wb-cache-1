5|$|Originally from North Carolina, Mainer's main {{influences}} {{came from}} the mountain music of his family. In a career that began in 1934 and spanned almost six decades, Mainer transitioned from being <b>a</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> brother's band into the founder of his own ensemble, the Sons of the Mountaineers, with whom he performed until 1953, when he became more deeply involved with his Christianity and left the music industry. After working at a General Motors factory and attending gospel revivals, Mainer was convinced that he should restart {{his career as a}} Christian gospel musician and began to tour with his wife in this capacity. He continued to release albums until 1993.|$|E
5|$|Underwood {{has been}} {{described}} as manipulative, conniving, Machiavellian, sociopathic, and a symbol of political corruption and evil. Throughout the series, he manipulates and destroys several people, including those he calls friends, for his own ends. Among other crimes, he personally commits murder twice, signs off on another murder committed by a subordinate, orders the deaths of two former employees, critically injures <b>a</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> cabinet to prevent her testifying against him, and indirectly allows the murder of a civilian for political ends.|$|E

5|$|According to Njáls saga, Gilli {{was seated}} on Kola or Kolu, an island {{that appears to}} refer to Coll or perhaps Colonsay. The saga also states that Gilli was married to Sigurðr's sister, Hvarflǫð. This marital {{alliance}} appears to further evince the southward extension of Sigurðr's influence. This union, along with the record of apparent amiable dealings with Sigurðr's associates, suggests that Gilli and Sigurðr indeed enjoyed close relations. The earl's family was clearly not adverse to marrying into native dynasties, as Sigurðr's own mother {{was the daughter of}} an Irish king, whilst his wife was the daughter of a Scottish king. In fact, the aforesaid sources appear to indicate that Gilli operated in the Hebrides as a tributary earl to his brother-in-law. Certainly, Eyrbyggja saga states that Sigurðr left menn ("agents") in the Hebrides to collect tax from Mann, whilst Orkneyinga saga reveals that, at a later period in time, Sigurðr's son and successor, Þórfinnr Sigurðarson, Earl of Orkney (died c. 1065), tasked <b>a</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own wife's family, Kálfr Árnason (died 1051), to impose Orcadian authority in the Isles.|$|E
5|$|Besides Baldwin's own writings, {{there is}} a decretal {{collection}} known as the Collectio Wigorniensis, still extant in manuscript (MS) form. It now resides in the British Library as Royal MS 10.A.ii. This collection may have belonged to Baldwin. It was probably compiled at Worcester Cathedral before December 1184, when Baldwin went to Canterbury, and besides a basic collection of Pope Alexander III's decretals it includes a number of letters from the papacy addressed to Baldwin as Bishop of Worcester and as Archbishop of Canterbury. Although the main contents are unexceptional, the compiler of the work numbered the books and capitula into which the work was divided, an innovation that allowed for much more efficient use of the collection. It {{is likely that the}} compiler was one of Baldwin's clerks, and that this testified to Baldwin's continuing interest in canon law. The manuscript itself was likely owned either by Baldwin himself or <b>a</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> household.|$|E
5|$|Farmer {{formed the}} Jazztet in 1959, with the {{composer}} and tenor saxophonist Benny Golson, after each man independently {{came to the}} conclusion that the other should be <b>a</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> new sextet. The Jazztet lasted until 1962, recorded several albums for Argo and Mercury Records, and assisted in the early careers of pianist McCoy Tyner and trombonist Grachan Moncur III. In the early 1960s Farmer established a trio with guitarist Jim Hall and bassist Steve Swallow; his relationship with Hall lasted from 1962 to 1964, and included two tours of Europe, one of which had concerts recorded for the BBC's Jazz 625 programme, which were later released on DVD. Hall left the second tour while the quartet, which included Swallow and drummer Pete La Roca, was engaged in Berlin, and a pianist replaced him; this was ultimately Steve Kuhn. In 1964, this new quartet recorded the album Sing Me Softly of the Blues for the Atlantic label. These bands played laid back, melodious music during a period when avant-garde jazz was becoming more common.|$|E

5|$|Foliot {{sent his}} nephew Richard Foliot and another clerk of his {{household}} to Bologna to study {{law in the}} 1160s, exemplifying the growing emphasis laid on Roman law among his countrymen. Another nephew was Ralph Foliot, Archdeacon of Hereford and a royal justice {{during the reign of}} Richard I. During his time at both dioceses, he did much to promote his relatives, and all of the archdeacons he appointed while at London were either nephews or other relatives. <b>A</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> household at Hereford was the scholar Roger of Hereford, who dedicated his computus, or treatise on calculating dates, to Foliot. Another work, the Ysagoge in Theologiam, was dedicated to him by a writer named Odo while Foliot was still a prior in France.|$|E
5|$|In his old age, {{he became}} a symbol for the Buffalo Soldiers. In 1994, he met with President Bill Clinton at the White House. In 1997, {{at the age of}} 103, Matthews was present at Arlington National Cemetery for a service honoring the Buffalo Soldiers, where he {{unveiled}} a plaque that dedicated his former barracks in honor of the soldiers. For his 108th birthday in 2002, he met with then-United States Secretary of State Colin Powell, where Powell was presented with a portrait of Matthews. He was <b>a</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> local church, a Prince Hall Masonic Temple and the Washington chapter of the 9th and 10th Cavalry Association until his death.|$|E
5|$|In late 1971, John Dean, the White House Counsel, {{pushed to}} expand the {{existing}} intelligence program ahead of the 1972 re-election campaign. Dean delegated the task to Jack Caulfield, <b>a</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> staff who was a former New York police officer. According to Dean, Caulfield himself was interested in work outside of politics; he intended to create a private security company, and felt that if the Nixon cabinet were an early client, {{it would lead to}} lucrative future clients within the private sector. Fred Emery, a journalist for The Times and BBC, refutes this, claiming in his book Watergate: The Corruption & Fall of Richard Nixon that the idea of a private sector security firm was simply a front for a committed campaign of surveillance working Nixon and the Republican Party, with political donations to the re-election campaign able to be diverted through the company as though they were unrelated transactions.|$|E
