5|$|Hay {{accompanied}} McKinley on his nationwide {{train tour}} in mid-1901, during which both men visited California {{and saw the}} Pacific Ocean for the only times in their lives. The summer of 1901 was tragic for Hay; his older son Adelbert, who had been consul in Pretoria during the Boer War <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> become McKinley's personal secretary, died in a fall from a New Haven hotel window.|$|E
5|$|Helmut Lent {{was ordered}} to {{intercept}} and engage the attacking bomber force and after refuelling—Lent had just landed at Jever from an armed patrol—claimed three Wellingtons, two of which, shot down at 14:30 and 14:45, were later confirmed. The two aircraft were both from No. 37 Squadron, captained by Flying Officer P.A. Wimberley and Flying Officer O.J.T. Lewis respectively, and both crashed in the shallow sea off Borkum. It is likely that his third claim may have been No. 37 Squadron Wellington 1A N2396, LF-J, piloted by Sergeant H. Ruse, which crash-landed on the sand dunes of Borkum. Lent was refused the victory over Wimberley, as the Wellington was attacked by Lent after {{it had already been}} badly damaged <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> crash. The Wellington was credited to pilot Carl-August Schumacher.|$|E

5|$|Joaquim Inácio {{returned}} to Rio de Janeiro in October, his {{tour of duty}} having lasted three years. He was then sent back to Cisplatina aboard the frigate Niterói and in December {{he became the first}} officer of the barque Grenfell. On 17 February 1828, he fought in the Battle of Quilmes. During the engagement, the Brazilian barque-brig (three-masted barque) Vinte e nove de agosto ran aground <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> be boarded. Seeing this, Joaquim Inácio positioned the Grenfell near the threatened vessel and protected her until she could be freed by the rising tide. Both ships {{returned to}} the battle, which resulted in a Brazilian victory. Brazil's efforts in the war were ultimately in vain, as it eventually relinquished Cisplatina, which became the independent nation of Uruguay. In July 1829, Joaquim Inácio again returned to Rio de Janeiro, and on 17 October he was promoted to first lieutenant.|$|E
5|$|The Ashvamedhika Parva narrates Uttanka's {{meeting with}} the god Krishna. As Krishna was {{returning}} to his kingdom Dwarka, he noticed the wandering ascetic Uttanka. Uttanka met Krishna and asked for news. Krishna told about the devastation in the Kurukshetra War. Uttanka was agitated <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> curse Krishna for not bringing about a compromise between the warring cousins Pandavas and Kauravas. Krishna explained the necessity of war for restoration of dharma and revealed his Vishvarupa form to Uttanka. The sage bowed to Krishna. Krishna told Uttanka {{to ask for a}} boon. Uttanka asked Krishna to grant him the boon of finding water whenever he was thirsty. Krishna granted the boon to Uttanka. Uttanka was the only other person other than Arjuna and Bhishma to get a divine vision of Krishna.|$|E
5|$|Several {{accounts}} {{indicate that}} during the Cherry Valley massacre or thereafter, Colonel Stacy was stripped naked and tied to a stake, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> be tortured and killed, as was the ritual for enemy warriors, but was spared by Joseph Brant. William Stacy was a Freemason; Joseph Brant was an educated American Indian, and had also become a Freemason. It is reported that Stacy made an appeal as one Freemason to another, thus saving his life. Colonel Stacy was subsequently taken to Fort Niagara, the Loyalist base in New York and held prisoner under Colonel Butler {{during the summer of}} 1779. At Fort Niagara, Molly Brant, the sister of Joseph Brant, was hostile toward Stacy, and wanted Colonel Butler to return custody of Stacy to the Indians. She proclaimed dreams of her and the Indians using Stacy's head in an Indian football game. Colonel Butler placated Molly Brant with rum and protected his prisoner. Subsequently, from late-1779 through mid-1782, Colonel Stacy was held prisoner at Fort Chambly near Montreal.|$|E

25|$|By {{the mid-1990s}} the Rover Group {{was looking to}} rationalise its engine ranges and produce new designs that {{would be able to}} meet {{emissions}} legislation for the foreseeable future. The recently released K-Series petrol engine range would be extended to cover that sector, but Rover had no in-house diesel engines suitable for both its cars and its 4×4s. The 300Tdi could not be fitted to any of the car range <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> fall foul of the upcoming Euro III emissions standards. The existing L-Series 2-litre diesel was not suitable for use in Land Rover products and could not be developed into such a unit.|$|E
25|$|One {{morning in}} 1948, soon after Burma gained her {{independence}} from Britain, however, the Kyipwa Yay Press in Mandalay was dynamited to rubble by government troops who were angry that the Ludu couple {{appeared to be}} sympathetic to the Communists.

25|$|During {{his time}} in England in the early 1920s, Hughes {{became part of the}} black {{expatriate}} community. In November 1924, he returned to the U.S. to live with his mother in Washington, D.C. After assorted odd jobs, he gained white-collar employment in 1925 as a personal assistant to the historian Carter G. Woodson at the Association for the Study of African American Life and History. As the work demands limited his time for writing, Hughes quit the position to work as a busboy at the Wardman Park Hotel. There he encountered the poet Vachel Lindsay, with whom he shared some poems. Impressed with the poems, Lindsay publicized his discovery of a new black poet. By this time, Hughes's earlier work had been published in magazines <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> be collected into his first book of poetry.|$|E
25|$|A major {{landmark}} in San Bruno {{for many years}} was Tanforan Racetrack, which opened in 1899. Such famous racehorses as Seabiscuit and Citation raced there. Famed Hollywood director Frank Capra filmed scenes for two of his films, Broadway Bill and Riding High, at the racetrack. For six months in 1942, it served {{as one of the}} main Bay Area centers for those forced into Japanese American internment, processing about 8000 Japanese before they were sent out to larger facilities in the desert of Utah and Manzanar in Owens Valley. The track closed in 1964 <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> be demolished, when it was destroyed in a major fire on July 31, 1964. The Shops at Tanforan mall was later built on the site; surrounding city streets were named for some of the racehorses who appeared at Tanforan.|$|E
25|$|Almeida was {{represented}} by Walter Dorsey again, {{this time in the}} same court in which he normally presided as judge. Against expectations, Dorsey's defense was based on a strict interpretation of the scope of its own court to try the case, filing a writ of habeas corpus based on that Almeida's arrest by state authorities violated the U.S. Constitution, because piracy was a federal crime. Dorsey argued that a state could not implement federal criminal laws despite the Judiciary Act of 1789 in section 33 authorized him to. However, the argument was taken into account and Judge Theodorick Bland declared the detention unconstitutional and ordered the Almeida's release. Bland himself was involved in the business of financing privateering through his brother in law, the postmaster Skinner, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> be tried for it.|$|E
