During air exposure all studied materials showed excellent oxidation resistance due to formation of a protective, double layered chromia/spinel surface scale even if the steel Cr content was as low as 17 %. However, in the <b>anode</b> side <b>gases</b> the presence of water vapour (and possibly CO/CO 2) increased the tendency to form poorly protective Fe-base oxide scales, in combination with internal oxidation of Cr. The occurrence of this adverse effect could be suppressed not only by increased Cr contents of the alloy but also by a small alloy grain size either in the bulk of the material Or in the specimen/component surface. The latter can be promoted by cold work e. g. introduced by specimen/component grinding. As high Cr contents may lead to undesired sigma-phase formation and defined surface treatments of an interconnect will not be possible in all designs, the relatively low operating temperature of 600 degrees C, resulting in low Cr diffusivity in the alloy grains, may require the use of a fine grained interconnect material to obtain and sustain protective chromia base surface scale formation during long-term operation.

Presence of a metallic nickel layer resulted in carbon uptake of the steels, whereby the relative amounts increased with decreasing steel chromium content. Interdiffusion between ferritic steel and nickel layer lead to austenite formation, with or without sigma-phase formation. Diffusion of chromium into the nickel layer resulted in formation of a thin chromia based surface scale on the initial nickel coating. This effect impedes the transfer of carbon from the gas into the nickel coated steel. (C) 2012 The Electrochemical Society. [DOI: 10. 1149 / 2. 033211 jes] All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Three {{configurations}} of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) micro-combined heat and power (micro-CHP) systems are studied {{with a particular}} emphasis on the application for single-family detached dwellings. Biogas {{is considered to be}} the primary fuel for the systems studied. In each system, a different method is used for processing the biogas fuel to prevent carbon deposition over the anode of the cells used in the SOFC stack. The <b>anode</b> exit <b>gas</b> recirculation, steamreforming, and partial oxidation are the methods employed in systems I 2 Ì† 013 III, respectively. The results predicted through computer simulation of these systems confirm that the net AC electrical efficiency of around 42. 4...|$|R
