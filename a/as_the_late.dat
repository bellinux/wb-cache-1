5|$|Under Lord Fairfax's ownership, the Cacapon River Valley was {{predominantly}} {{inhabited by}} English-speaking settlers as early <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> 1730s.

5|$|A {{preliminary}} expedition under Mardonius, in 492BC, {{to secure}} the land approaches to Greece ended with the re-conquest of Thrace and forced Macedon to become a fully subordinate client kingdom of Persia, the latter which had been a Persian vassal as early <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> 6th century BC. An amphibious task force was then sent out under Datis and Artaphernes in 490BC, using Delos as an intermediate base at, successfully sacking Karystos and Eretria, before moving to attack Athens. However, at the ensuing Battle of Marathon, the Athenians won a remarkable victory, resulting in {{the withdrawal of the}} Persian army to Asia.|$|E

5|$|As early <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> 1950s, {{plans for}} a Tulsa freeway system {{included}} a route along 96th Street South. The 96th Street corridor was accessible to more motorists than other corridors further south (farther away from the urban core), while still having low right-of-way costs, comparable to more southerly corridors. This made it the ideal route for a south Tulsa freeway. In 1986, ODOT had {{plans to build a}} toll-free facility called the Creek Freeway in the corridor as part of SH-117.|$|E

It is particularly poorly compatible with O.illudens, the authors of the study suggesting the separation may have been as long ago <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Late</b> Carboniferous separation of Gondwana from Laurasia but conceding the lack of any fossil record makes it impossible to know whether the genus even existed at the time.|$|E
5|$|Mount Bailey {{is part of}} the High Cascades in {{the western}} United States. The High Cascades have long been glaciated, by both Pacific-bred storms and natural, elevation-caused, {{glaciation}}. In fact, glaciation probably formed on them as early <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> Miocene. Over time, as the range built up, newer activity diminished older Tertiary age rock. Creating lava plateaus, Pliocene activity, mostly basaltic and andesitic, was probably responsible for the original cones at Bailey, Thielsen, and Union Peak.|$|E

5|$|The Devonian {{tetrapods}} {{went through}} two major bottlenecks during {{what is known}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Late</b> Devonian extinction; one {{at the end of}} the Frasnian stage, and one twice as large {{at the end of the}} following Famennian stage. These events of extinctions led to the disappearance of primitive tetrapods with fish-like features like Ichthyostega and their primary more aquatic relatives. When tetrapods reappear in the fossil record after the Devonian extinctions, the adult forms are all fully adapted to a terrestrial existence, with later species secondary adapted to an aquatic lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|The bicycle kick {{was invented}} in South America, {{possibly}} as early <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> 19th century, {{during a period of}} development in football history. Innovations like the bicycle kick were the result of local adaptations to the football style introduced by British immigrants. Football lore has many legends on the possible origins of the bicycle kick.

5|$|The funerary cult of Unas {{established}} {{at his death}} continued {{until the end of}} the Old Kingdom and may have survived during the chaotic First Intermediate Period. The cult was still in existence or revived during the later Middle Kingdom (c. 2050–c. 1650 BC). This did not prevent Amenemhat I and Senusret I (c. 1990–c. 1930 BC) from partially dismantling the mortuary complex of Unas for its materials. In parallel to the official cult, Unas may have received popular veneration as a local god of the Saqqara necropolis until as late <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Late</b> Period (664–332 BC), nearly 2,000 years after his death.|$|E

5|$|There is {{evidence}} that Quiriguá was occupied as early <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Late</b> Preclassic (400BC AD200). Although no structures have been securely dated to this period, a number of Late Preclassic artifacts have been recovered, including 63figurines and a chert blade. Early Classic ceramics from Quiriguá are similar to finds at both Copán and Chalchuapa in El Salvador, while jade hunchback figurines {{from the same period}} resemble those found in central Honduras and in the Guatemalan highlands. These early finds demonstrate the participation of Quiriguá in the wider southeastern Maya region from the Late Preclassic onwards.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} that ancestors of the fisher migrated to North America during the Pliocene era between 2.5 and 5 million years ago. Two extinct mustelids, M. palaeosinensis and M. anderssoni, {{have been found in}} eastern Asia. The first true fisher, M. divuliana, has only been found in North America. There are strong indications that M. divuliana is related to the Asian finds, which suggests a migration. M. pennanti has been found as early <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Late</b> Pleistocene era, about 125,000 years ago. There are no major differences between the Pleistocene fisher and the modern fisher. Fossil evidence indicates that the fisher's range extended farther south than it does today.|$|E

5|$|As early <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> 1380s {{and early}} 1390s, Isabeau {{demonstrated}} that she possessed diplomatic influence when the Florentine delegation requested her political {{intervention in the}} Gian Galeazzo Visconti affair. Orléans and the Duke of Burgundy were in the pro-Visconti faction while the anti-Visconti faction included Isabeau, her brother, Louis VII, Duke of Bavaria, and John III, Count of Armagnac. At that time Isabeau lacked the political power to effect change. Some years later, however, at the 1396 wedding of her seven-year-old daughter, Isabella, to Richard II of England (an event at which Charles attacked a herald for wearing Galeazzo's livery), Isabeau successfully negotiated an alliance between France and Florence with Florentine ambassador Buonaccorso Pitti.|$|E
5|$|As the D-League season wound down, Rice {{emerged as}} a sleeper draft choice for the 2013 NBA draft. His {{performances}} ended up helping him go from {{the possibility of being}} undrafted to being taken as early <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> first round. He was one of 60 players invited to the NBA Draft Combine. On June 27, 2013, Rice was selected with the 35th overall pick of the NBA Draft by the Philadelphia 76ers, but was traded to the Washington Wizards for the 38th and 54th selections, {{which turned out to be}} Nate Wolters and Arsalan Kazemi, respectively. He became the fourth player with D-League experience to be drafted and at 35th overall was the highest D-League veteran to have been drafted to that point. However, P. J. Hairston became the first D-League first-rounder when he was drafted 26th in the 2014 NBA draft to eclipse this record.|$|E
