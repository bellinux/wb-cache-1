According to Thornton, [...] "I'm one of those artists that people take my music without my consent. People love to snatch my music <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> on their own. You got people that put me on beats I never rapped on. I just feel that it's a bad thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Black's {{voice has}} been {{described}} as raspy, death growls often appearing in her music. In an interview with The Advocate, Black revealed that she has always had this talent and that it is something she has never practiced. RedOne, the producer who signed her to his label, says that Black's voice and attitude reminded him of Joan Jett. He concluded that [...] "he can scream <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> with her voice that nobody can do. She is uncompromising in pursuing her own creative vision. She's taking everything that's old and making it futuristic and bringing rock and roll back in her own way." [...] Black styled her musical genre [...] "horror-pop". It {{has been described}} as the love child between Marilyn Manson and Britney Spears, a fusion of dance-pop and darker industrial themes. Black cites that Spears inspires her deep love for choreography, while Manson inspires the sound and attitude of her lyrics and performance style.|$|E

500|$|Miller is {{considered}} one of the founders of psycholinguistics, which links language and cognition in psychology, to analyze how people use and create language. His 1951 book Language and Communication {{is considered}} seminal in the field. His later book, The Science of Words (1991) also focused on language psychology. He published papers along with Noam Chomsky on the mathematics and computational aspects of language and its syntax, two new areas of study. Miller also researched how people understood words and sentences, the same problem faced by artificial speech-recognition technology. [...] The book Plans and the Structure of Behavior (1960), written with Eugene Galanter and Karl H. Pribram, explored how humans plan and act, trying to extrapolate this to how a robot could be programmed to plan <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>things.</b> Miller is also known for coining Miller's Law: [...] "In order to understand what another person is saying, you must assume it is true and try to imagine what it could be true of".|$|E
2500|$|The {{longer he}} was in Paris, the more he had an Asian {{aesthetic}} for flowers.

2500|$|Flowers {{were the}} subject of many of Van Gogh's {{paintings}} in Paris, due in great part to his regard for flowers. As said to his brother, [...] "You will see that by making a habit of looking at Japanese pictures you will come to love to make up bouquets <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> with flowers all the more." [...] To his sister, Wil, Van Gogh advised her to cultivate her own garden, like Voltaire's Candide, to find joy and meaning in life. After he left Paris and settled in Arles Van Gogh painted his second group of Sunflowers in 1888 and 1889. His paintings of sunflowers in vases are among his most well known paintings.|$|E

2500|$|Moravia once {{remarked that}} the most {{important}} facts of his life had been his illness, a tubercular infection of the bones that confined him to a bed for five years and Fascism, because they both caused him to suffer <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> he otherwise would not have done. [...] "It is what we are forced to do that forms our character, not what we do of our own free will." [...] Moravia was an atheist. His writing was marked by its factual, cold, precise style, often depicting the malaise of the bourgeoisie. It was rooted in the tradition of nineteenth-century narrative, underpinned by high social and cultural awareness. Moravia believed that writers must, if they were to represent reality, [...] "assume a moral position, a clearly conceived political, social, and philosophical attitude" [...] but also that, ultimately, [...] "A writer survives in spite of his beliefs". Between 1959 and 1962 Moravia was president of PEN International, the worldwide association of writers.|$|E
2500|$|Bernal Díaz del Castillo barely {{tries to}} conceal that the much-repeated Indians had {{something}} to do with the project, although authors such as Salvador de Madariaga prefer to conclude that the objective was a much more noble one, [...] "to discover, to occupy ourselves <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> worthy of being told". But, in addition, governor Diego Velázquez himself wanted to participate in the project and he lent the money to build a boat, [...] "...with the condition that [...] we had to go with three boats to some little islets that are between the island of Cuba and Honduras, that are now known as the islands of Los Guanaxes , and we had to go in arms and fill up the boats with a cargo of Indians from those islets to serve as slaves" [...] (here Bernal uses the word esclavos, [...] "slaves", against Velázquez, whereas he had previously avoided speaking of the Indians whom Velázquez had promised to him). The chronicler immediately denied that he admits this pretension of Velázquez's: [...] "we responded to him that what he said was not the command of God nor king, to make free men into slaves". If we are to believe Bernal, the governor sportingly admitted the denial and despite all this lent the money for the boat.|$|E

What then shall we do, will you say? Why I answer, leave things to the providence of God, and do thou with moderation submit to his hand. But since, when they are growing dear, the hand that upholds the price is, for the time, more strong than that which would pull it down; that being {{the hand of the}} seller, who loveth to have it dear, especially if it shall rise in his hand.
