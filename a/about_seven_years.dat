5|$|Juveniles have a 43% {{chance of}} {{surviving}} their first year, and the annual survival rate of adults is about 80%. Choughs generally have a lifespan of <b>about</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years,</b> although an age of 17years has been recorded. The temperature and rainfall in the months preceding breeding correlates {{with the number of}} young fledging each year and their survival rate. Chicks fledging under good conditions are more likely to survive to breeding age, and have longer breeding lives than those fledging under poor conditions.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, the {{detection}} of an orbiting planetary object was announced by Bruce Campbell, Gordon Walker and Stephenson Yang. From 1980 to 2000, a team of astronomers led by Artie P. Hatzes made radial velocity observations of Epsilon Eridani, measuring the Doppler shift of the star {{along the line of}} sight. They found evidence of a planet orbiting the star with a period of <b>about</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years.</b> Although there is a high level of noise in the radial velocity data due to magnetic activity in its photosphere, any periodicity caused by this magnetic activity is expected to show a strong correlation with variations in emission lines of ionized calcium (the Ca II H and K lines). Because no such correlation was found, a planetary companion was deemed the most likely cause. This discovery was supported by astrometric measurements of Epsilon Eridani made between 2001 and 2003 with the Hubble Space Telescope, which showed evidence for gravitational perturbation of Epsilon Eridani by a planet.|$|E

From 1848 to his death, Collyer was connected to the fire departments of North Providence and Pawtucket, rising to the rank of Chief Engineer in 1874.

25|$|In {{addition}} to plant specimens, Drummond also sent seeds of D.nobilis to England. Plants were raised from Drummond's seeds, and in 1852 {{one of them}} flowered, making D.nobilis {{one of only two}} dryandras known to have flowered in Europe from Drummond's seed. The flowering specimen was <b>about</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years</b> old at the time, and about four feet high. It became the basis for a lithographed plate by Walter Hood Fitch, which was featured in Volume 78 of Curtis's Botanical Magazine. By this time, however, the enthusiasm for Proteaceae that prevailed among horticulturalists in the 1840s had waned, and D.nobilis would be the last dryandra to feature in Curtis's Botanical Magazine.|$|E
25|$|The raids to Moscow {{consumed}} many {{resources at}} the time when Lithuania faced another war with the Teutonic Order and suffered several defeats, particularly the Battle of Rudau in February 1370. The raids were a tactical defeat. Lithuania did not gain any new territory and lost Tver, one of its most reliable allies. They strengthened Moscow's prestige and influence in Rus' and signified that Lithuanian eastward expansion into Slavic lands was coming to an end. The peace between Lithuania and Moscow lasted for <b>about</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years</b> until 1379, when after the death of Algirdas in 1377 his eldest son Andrei of Polotsk allied himself with Moscow against Jogaila.|$|E

25|$|Ralph Darras, John's father, died in December 1461, when John {{was only}} <b>about</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years</b> of age. This {{was during the}} second major {{outbreak}} of the Black Death in Shropshire, {{although there is no}} record of Ralph Darras's cause of death. The plague brought great economic shifts alongside the human cost. Shropshire inquisitions post mortem taken during the plague outbreak show that land lay uncultivated and some landowners struggled to pay even very modest rents, and some estates were considered worthless. While the majority of the rural population was placed at an advantage by labour shortages, landlords were forced to relax conditions imposed on tenants and to buy in labour. This is the economic and agrarian background to John Darras's lifelong struggles to consolidate and extend his estates and to find additional sources of income, mainly through business and military service.|$|E
25|$|At the {{macroeconomic}} level, real GDP growth {{rose from}} 2.4 percent in 1997 to 5.9 percent in 2000.

Both public and private investments increased in the energy sector, the building industry, and other sectors of the country's industrial base. The country's external debt was cut from $12.1 billion to $7.9 billion, its lowest level since the Iran-Iraq cease-fire. The World Bank granted $232 million for health and sewage projects after a hiatus of <b>about</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years.</b> The government, {{for the first time since}} the 1979 wholesale financial nationalization, authorized the establishment of two private banks and one private insurance company.
