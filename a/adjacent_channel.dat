This gave reasonable reception by day but strong heterodyne interference at night because the transmitter crystal was off-channel. In July Caroline {{moved to the}} <b>adjacent</b> <b>channel,</b> 962kHz (312 metres but still called 319) and reception in the UK improved. Meanwhile, Radio Mi Amigo had interference on 1562kHz and changed to 1412kHz (212 m).|$|E

This move enabled KRTS to increase from 3,000 watts to 50,000 watts without interfering with KTRU's signal on the second <b>adjacent</b> <b>channel.</b>|$|E
2500|$|As {{the name}} implies, {{wideband}} FM (WFM) requires a wider signal bandwidth than amplitude modulation by an equivalent modulating signal; this {{also makes the}} signal more robust against noise and interference. Frequency modulation is also more robust against signal-amplitude-fading phenomena. As a result, FM {{was chosen as the}} modulation standard for high frequency, high fidelity radio transmission, hence the term [...] "FM radio" [...] (although for many years the BBC called it [...] "VHF radio" [...] because commercial FM broadcasting uses part of the VHF band—the FM broadcast band). FM receivers employ a special detector for FM signals and exhibit a phenomenon known as the capture effect, in which the tuner [...] "captures" [...] the stronger of two stations on the same frequency while rejecting the other (compare this with a similar situation on an AM receiver, where both stations can be heard simultaneously). However, frequency drift or a lack of selectivity may cause one station to be overtaken by another on an <b>adjacent</b> <b>channel.</b> Frequency drift was a problem in early (or inexpensive) receivers; inadequate selectivity may affect any tuner.|$|E

2500|$|The channel 6 {{frequency}} was {{allocated to}} Miami by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in June 1957, {{as part of}} a minor reorganization nationwide of VHF channel assignments. The channel was reallocated to the city of South Miami when Coral Television was awarded a construction permit to build channel 6 in April 1964. In February 1967, seven months before WCIX went on the air, Coral Television successfully convinced the FCC to move the community of license back to Miami proper, where the station could serve more viewers. WCIX built a transmitter tower in Homestead, which was [...] southwest of Miami, farther south than the Miami–Fort Lauderdale market's other television stations. This arrangement was necessary to protect WPTV (on <b>adjacent</b> <b>channel</b> 5) in West Palm Beach and WDBO-TV (now WKMG-TV, and also on channel 6) in Orlando. As a result, Miami's channel 6 only provided a [...] "Grade B" [...] signal to Fort Lauderdale, and was virtually unviewable in the northern portion of Broward County. The station made up for this shortfall in its coverage area by signing on translator stations throughout Broward County and in Boca Raton (part of the West Palm Beach market); WCIX identified these translators, broadcasting on UHF channels 33, 61 and 69, in its station IDs as late as the mid-1980s. The channel 33 translator was shut down in 1984 to allow future sister station WBFS-TV to sign on, and was then moved to channel 27 where it operated until the mid-1990s; channel 69 became WYHS-TV in 1988. Translators on channels 21 (in Pompano Beach) and 58 (in central Broward County) were also used in later years.|$|E

5000|$|The adjacent-channel {{interference}} which receiver A experiences from a transmitter B {{is the sum}} of {{the power}} that B emits into A's channel—known as the [...] "unwanted emission", and represented by the ACLR (<b>Adjacent</b> <b>Channel</b> Leakage Ratio)—and the power that A picks up from B's channel, which is represented by the ACS (<b>Adjacent</b> <b>Channel</b> Selectivity). B emitting power into A's channel is called adjacent-channel leakage (unwanted emissions). It occurs for two reasons. First, because RF filters require a roll-off, and do not eliminate a signal completely. Second, due to intermodulation in B's amplifiers, which cause the transmitted spectrum to spread beyond what was intended. Therefore, B emits some power in the <b>adjacent</b> <b>channel</b> which is picked up by A. A receives some emissions from B's channel due to the roll off of A's selectivity filters. Selectivity filters are designed to [...] "select" [...] a channel. Similarly, B's signal suffers intermodulation distortion passing through A's RF input amplifiers, leaking more power into adjacent frequencies.|$|E
