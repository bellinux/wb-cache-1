50|$|When {{constructing}} nested wells, attention {{must be paid}} {{to ensure}} the proper placement of sand in the screened intervals and bentonite between monitored intervals, by measuring {{the depth of the}} sand or bentonite frequently as the materials are being placed. However, if the seals are placed to the exact depths specified in the well design, riser casings that are touching due to de-centralization in the borehole inhibits seal placement between the risers and can allow for vertical movement of groundwater within the borehole between different monitoring zones. The likelihood of vertical leakage through the bentonite seals of a nested well increases with the number of separate casings within the borehole, or when only a small thickness of <b>annular</b> <b>seal</b> exists between the various monitored zones.|$|E

A single rotor system and three states of <b>annular</b> <b>seal</b> flow were modeled. These models were solved using numerical integration and finite difference methods.

In each time step {{one of the three}} <b>annular</b> <b>seal</b> models was chosen to simulate the <b>annular</b> <b>seal</b> flow according to the state of rotor systems. The objective was to obtain a transient response of rotor systems under {{the influence of}} fluid-induced forces generated by <b>annular</b> <b>seal</b> flow. This method overcomes some shortcomings of the traditional FSI method by improving the data transfer process between two domains. Calculated results were in good agreement with the experimental results. The <b>annular</b> <b>seal</b> was shown to have a supportive effect on rotor systems. Furthermore, decreasing the seal clearance would enhance this supportive effect. In the transient process, vibration amplitude and critical speed largely changed when the acceleration of the rotor system increased...|$|E

40|$|For some {{applications}} it must {{be considered}} that the flow in the <b>annular</b> <b>seal</b> contains a mixture of liquid and gas. The multiphase character of the flow is described by the volume fraction of gas (usually air) contained in the liquid under the form of bubbles. The fluid is then a homogenous mixture of air and liquid all thru the <b>annular</b> <b>seal.</b> Its local gas volume fraction depends on the pressure field and is calculated by using a simplified form of the Rayleigh-Plesset equation. The influence of such of a multiphase (bubbly) flow on the dynamic characteristics of a straight <b>annular</b> <b>seal</b> is minimal because {{the volume of the}} fluid is reduced. The situation is quite different for textured annular (damper) seals provided with equally spaced deep cavities intended to increase the damping capabilities and to reduce the leakage flow rate. As a by-product, the volume of the fluid in the seal increases drastically and the compressibility effects stemming from the bubbly nature of the flow are largely increased even for a low gas volume fraction. The present work depicts the influence of the gas volume fraction on the dynamic characteristics of a textured <b>annular</b> <b>seal.</b> It is shown that variations of the gas volume fraction between 1 % and 0. 1 % can lead to frequency dependent stiffness, damping and added mass coefficients...|$|E

Highlights on the bulk-flow analysis of <b>annular</b> <b>seals</b> are given with details {{on the performance of}} two water seals – long and short, featuring the advantages of an anti-swirl brake to enhance the seal rotordynamic stability.

The load capacity and direct stiffnesses of hydrostatic bearings do not depend on fluid viscosity, thus making them ideal rotor support elements in process fluid pumps. Current applications intend to replace oil lubricated bearing with hybrid bearings to improve efficiency with shorten rotor spans and less mechanical complexity.

Proper completion of a well is essential to the protection of ground-water resources. Selecting a proper material for the <b>annular</b> <b>seal</b> should be based on the geologic conditions at the well site. Previous studies have not adequately linked <b>annular</b> <b>seal</b> material selection with geologic variability. This study created unique geological-based criteria for the selection of <b>annular</b> <b>seal</b> materials. The shear strength with which the <b>annular</b> <b>seal</b> materials held the PVC well pipe was tested, as were the expansive properties of <b>annular</b> <b>seal</b> materials. Both bentonite and cement seals were tested. Unidirectional swell and reserve expansion of bentonite was also examined. Bentonite pellets were found to have a greater reserve (potential) expansion than bentonite chips. However, when emplaced dry and subsequently hydrated, bentonite chips showed greater unidirectional expansion than pellets, because the slaking of pellets caused them to quickly fall apart and seal the remaining bentonite from the water supply. When emplaced through a standing column of water, pellets showed greater unidirectional expansion, because they adhered to the sides of the container, ensuring a larger volume of water to a greater surface area of bentonite. Pumpable bentonite grouts were found to have shear strengths of 0. I psi or lower. Chips were found to have strengths of approximately 0. 7 psi and pellets around 2 psi. However, when pellets were emplaced through water, they achieved shear strengths of only 0. 8 psi. All bentonite samples had good recoverability. Cement-based samples had initial shear strengths of 4. 7 psi or greater. After failure these values dropped significantly, they are therefore considered to have poor recoverability. 'Me performance of various <b>annular</b> <b>seal</b> materials was related to rock strength, hole condition, and hydrologic condition to devise a material selection technique. Pumpable grouts are best suited for pressurized (artesian) well conditions because their weight counters the upward pressure of water; semi-rigid bentonite seals (chips and pellets) are best suited for wet hole conditions because when hydrated these materials form a low permeability seal with moderately high shear strength; and cement base seals are best suited for dry strong rock environments...|$|E

Results were {{compared to that of}} an <b>annular</b> <b>seal</b> at similar operating conditions. In order to generalize the results, they were correlated using corresponding state theory.

High performance turbomachines such as the Space Shuttle Main Engine Turbopumps (SSME-HPOTP and HPFTP) are prone to experience severe vibration problems due to high operating pressures and speeds.

Seal eccentricity has been included for rigid seals. The eccentric seal analysis is {{based on the work of}} Nelson and Nguyen (1988), but a much simpler and effective method, namely the cubic spline interpolation method, is adapted to obtain the circumferential derivatives of the primitive variables. The bulk flow continuity, axial and circumferential momentum and the energy transport equations are utilized to model the flow field while Moody's friction factor model is adapted to account for the wall shear stresses.
