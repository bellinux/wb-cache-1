5|$|Changyuraptor yangi {{is a close}} {{relative}} of Microraptor gui, <b>also</b> <b>thought</b> to be a glider or flyer based {{on the presence of}} four wings and similar limb proportions. However, it is a considerably larger animal, around the size of a wild turkey, being among the largest known flying Mesozoic paravians.|$|E
5|$|It is {{suspected}} that comet impacts have, over long timescales, also delivered significant quantities {{of water to}} the Earth's Moon, {{some of which may}} have survived as lunar ice. Comet and meteoroid impacts are <b>also</b> <b>thought</b> to be responsible for the existence of tektites and australites.|$|E
5|$|Jock's main {{rival in}} the show ring was a dog named Tartar, who {{was said to be}} more fond of ratting than his competitor. Jock was said to have never killed a rat; his ability to hunt Foxes was <b>also</b> <b>thought</b> to be a myth.|$|E

5|$|Kevin Pires from FlavorWire {{listed the}} book {{as one of his}} ten {{favorite}} Goosebumps books, and Nathan Reese from Complex.com rated One Day at HorrorLand his ninth favorite book from the series. Reese <b>also</b> <b>thought</b> the ending was more dark and humorous than most other books.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the biggest}} criticisms Steiner {{received}} was that he himself believed what his fictive Hitler said about the Jews. It was <b>also</b> <b>thought</b> {{that at the end}} of the London theatre production, the audience were applauding Hitler and not the play.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptians are <b>also</b> <b>thought</b> to {{have come}} into {{knowledge}} about elements such as antimony, copper, crude arsenic, lead, opium, and mandrake (among others) which are mentioned in papyri. Egyptians are now {{thought to be the}} first to master distillation, and to manipulate the poison that can be retrieved from apricot kernels.|$|E
50|$|Anise has <b>also</b> been <b>thought</b> a {{treatment}} for menstrual cramps and colic.|$|R
50|$|Cidaroids <b>also</b> are <b>thought</b> to {{have contributed}} to the {{downfall}} of the crinoids.|$|R

5|$|The centaurs, {{which are}} not {{normally}} {{considered part of the}} Kuiper belt, are <b>also</b> <b>thought</b> to be scattered objects, the only difference being that they were scattered inward, rather than outward. The Minor Planet Center groups the centaurs and the SDOs together as scattered objects.|$|E
5|$|Aetosaur {{material}} was first described by Swiss paleontologist Louis Agassiz in 1844. He named the genus Stagonolepis from the Lossiemouth Sandstone in Elgin, Scotland, but considered {{it to be}} a Devonian fish rather than a Triassic reptile. This may be because he considered the strata {{to be part of the}} Old Red Sandstone, and thus Paleozoic in age. Agassiz mistook the osteoderms for large rhomboidal scales, which he thought were arranged in a similar pattern to those of gars. He <b>also</b> <b>thought</b> that these supposed scales were very similar to those of the lobe-finned fish Megalichthys due to their large size.|$|E
5|$|Arctic terns {{sometimes}} dip down to {{the surface}} of the water to catch prey close to the surface. They may also chase insects in the air when breeding. It is <b>also</b> <b>thought</b> that Arctic terns may, in spite of their small size, occasionally engage in kleptoparasitism by swooping at birds so as to startle them into releasing their catches. Several species are targetedâ€”conspecifics, other terns (like the common tern), and some auk and grebe species.|$|E

5|$|Before {{completion}} of the tunnel, in 2009, nearly 16,000 vehicles travelled to and from PortMiami through downtown streets each weekday. Truck traffic made up 28% (or 4,480) of this number (Source: 2009 PB Americas Traffic Study). In 2010 {{it was estimated that}} around 19,000 vehicles traveled to the port daily but that only 16% were trucks. Existing truck and bus routes restricted the port's ability to grow, drive up costs for port users and presenting safety hazards. They were <b>also</b> <b>thought</b> to congest and limit redevelopment of the northern portion of Miami's Central Business District.|$|E
5|$|Believing {{that the}} wings were short and round, Gibbs thought {{the bird was}} not a strong flyer, and {{therefore}} not nomadic (periodically moving from place to place). In spite of the evidently longer wings which might have made it a strong flyer, vanGrouw <b>also</b> <b>thought</b> {{it would have been}} a sedentary (mostly staying at the same location) bird, that preferred not to fly across open water, similar to species in Ducula. It may have had a limited distribution on a small, remote island, which may explain why its provenance remains unknown.|$|E
5|$|Chibnall, having enjoyed {{when the}} Doctor and his {{companion}} were separated, {{made the decision}} for Amy to be absent {{for most of the}} episode. Moffat <b>also</b> <b>thought</b> that, at the point {{in the middle of the}} series, it was appropriate to show the Doctor behave differently with other people. A deleted scene, parts of which were shown on the accompanying behind-the-scenes show Doctor Who Confidential, was filmed, depicting Amy discussing with the Doctor how she had seen herself with Rory ten years in the future, and if that would really happen.|$|E

5|$|Dopamine-derived melanin {{probably}} {{appears in}} at least some other biological systems as well. Some of the dopamine in plants is likely {{to be used as a}} precursor for dopamine-melanin. The complex patterns that appear on butterfly wings, as well as black-and-white stripes on the bodies of insect larvae, are <b>also</b> <b>thought</b> to be caused by spatially structured accumulations of dopamine-melanin.|$|E
5|$|Han-era astronomers {{adopted a}} geocentric {{model of the}} universe, theorizing that it was shaped like a sphere {{surrounding}} the earth in the center. They assumed that the Sun, Moon, and planets were spherical and not disc-shaped. They <b>also</b> <b>thought</b> that the illumination of the Moon and planets was caused by sunlight, that lunar eclipses occurred when the Earth obstructed sunlight falling onto the Moon, and that a solar eclipse occurred when the Moon obstructed sunlight from reaching the Earth. Although others disagreed with his model, Wang Chong accurately described the water cycle of the evaporation of water into clouds.|$|E
5|$|In {{further studies}} {{conducted}} by Dr. Norman K. Hollenberg, {{professor of medicine}} at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School found that flavonols may also help vessels dilate and help keep platelets from clustering on the blood vessel walls. Flavonoids found in hot chocolate are beneficial to health mainly because they shield the walls of blood vessels from free radical damage. Flavanols are <b>also</b> <b>thought</b> to help reduce blood platelet buildup and can balance levels of compounds called eicosanoids, which may be beneficial to cardiovascular health.|$|E

5|$|In {{his book}} The Technology Edge, {{published}} in 1983, O'Neill wrote about economic competition with Japan. He {{argued that the}} United States had to develop six industries to compete: microengineering, robotics, genetic engineering, magnetic flight, family aircraft, and space science. He <b>also</b> <b>thought</b> that industrial development was suffering from short-sighted executives, self-interested unions, high taxes, and poor education of Americans. According to reviewer Henry Weil, O'Neill's detailed explanations of emerging technologies differentiated the book from others on the subject.|$|E
5|$|In the {{folklore}} of Croats of Ravni Kotari, {{a region}} in northern Dalmatia, there were men called vidogoja. They {{were believed to}} know past and future things. People paid them to cure the sick, which they did by saying prayers and making {{the sign of the}} cross all over the patient's body. The vidogoja were <b>also</b> <b>thought</b> to be able to inflict diseases on people, and to have evil eyes. They could not fly.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the FBI {{had three}} {{hypotheses}} regarding {{who might have}} been responsible for the bombing. The first was international terrorists, possibly the same group that had carried out the World Trade Center bombing two years earlier. The FBI <b>also</b> <b>thought</b> that a drug cartel might have been carrying out an act of vengeance against DEA agents as the building held a DEA office. The last hypothesis was that the bombing was done by anti-government right-wing radicals attempting to start a rebellion against the federal government.|$|E
