500|$|... "Audrey Pauley" [...] {{was written}} by Steven Maeda and {{directed}} by Kim Manners. The entry was Maeda's second ninth season entry after [...] "4-D". The episode features guest star Tracey Ellis as the titular Audrey Pauley. Ellis had previously appeared as a major character in the third season episode [...] "Oubliette". Annabeth Gish later noted that the episode, along with [...] "4-D", were her [...] "two favorite episodes" [...] because they [...] "are stand-alone episodes about Reyes and Doggett. Wonderful acting challenges, and the stories were fantastic." [...] Robert Patrick, whose friend Ted Demme had recently died, was worried about bringing too much emotion onto the set. He later noted, [...] "I was kind of raw. I remember being <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>worried</b> about bringing too much emotion to it. I felt safe with Kim; he knew I {{was going through a}} tough time." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of the single, in an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Allen said, [...] "It took a while, but it’s done really incredible. It exceeded all my expectations anyway. To be honest, I was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>worried</b> when it first came out and it wasn’t doing great. But I think it’s just about working hard and getting people to hear the song, and then everyone started believing in it a little bit more. I remember getting a text from Keith Urban saying 'I’m not gonna lie: The first time I heard that song I wasn’t crazy about it. But after a couple listens, I really, really like it.' And I mean, I think that’s how everybody felt about the song. And I think that’s a testament to a good song. You don’t have to love ‘em the first time you hear ‘em. It grew on people." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Breakaway" [...] {{was directed by}} Dave Meyers, which was shot in two days from July 10 to July 11, 2004. In the video, the younger version of Clarkson was played by Lindsey Krueger. According to Meyers, working with Clarkson was a pleasant experience because he felt she was good and honest, although he had initial doubts in the beginning. He explained, [...] "I was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>worried,</b> her coming off 'American Idol,' it inherently feels manufactured and I didn't {{know how much of}} it was true artistry. But when I met her, she really does have a good, solid vibe. It was an honor to bring some of that out of her." [...] Since the song is autobiographical, Clarkson decided to act out most of the lyrics in the video. Meyers also realized that the song was featured in The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement and he struggled {{to find a way to}} address the film-footage in the music video, saying [...] "Since it's a movie tie-in, the idea stems from trying to figure out a new way of addressing the film-footage requirement they put on you, so we came up with the idea of her attending the premiere, which is very much something she will do in real life." ...|$|E
60|$|Mike {{ran around}} to where Jack Rasco was in earnest {{conversation}} with a stranger who had just come in from town. The stranger had brought a letter from Nellie Winthrop, posted two days before, and saying when she would arrive.

500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] segment {{published}} by HBO {{shortly after the}} airing of the episode, Benioff spoke {{about the relationship between}} Sansa Stark and Jon Snow {{at this point in the}} season, saying [...] "Over the course of this season they've come to really rely upon each other, but she doesn't really trust him completely. She didn't tell him about the meeting with Littlefinger, she didn't tell him that she summoned the Knights of the Vale, there's definitely a little hint of conflict there. So I think there's a little bit of anger about that and a little bit of jealousy, and that relationship will be crucial to watch." [...] Benioff continued by referencing the declaration of Jon Snow as King of the North, noting [...] "We see the second 'King in the North!' scene with Jon and I think it was important to us that it evoked in that first 'King in the North!' scene. Very different circumstances, different environment. In some ways, the evocation of the first one is meant to be a little worrisome because it was a very triumphant moment when Robb is named King in the North but it didn't go so well for the previous King in the North. So I think we have to be <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>worried</b> for Jon and at the same time it's a pretty big reversal and, you know, for a character who was dead at the beginning of the season to be declared king at the end of it. He's done well. He's done well in ten short episodes." ...|$|E
500|$|Filmmaker Walt Disney {{himself had}} first {{attempted}} {{to adapt the}} Brothers Grimm fairy tale [...] "Rapunzel" [...] into a feature-length animated film during the 1930s and 1940s. However, the project was eventually abandoned because the original fairy tale was considered too [...] "small". When they were first approached to direct Tangled in 2008, directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard decided {{that it would be}} best [...] "to blow up the scale of the film" [...] and transform it into a [...] "big event", while updating and modernizing the story for a new audience. Flynn was conceived because the directors felt that [...] "Rapunzel needed to get out ... So she needed to meet a guy to take her to where she's going." [...] In the original fairy tale, Rapunzel's love interest is a prince. However, Greno and Howard decided to make him a thief – dubbed [...] "a subtle yet startling twist for Disney" [...] by The New York Times – in order to avoid creating a character who is too [...] "safe", opting for a funnier and [...] "edgier" [...] antihero instead. Greno elaborated, [...] "When you look back at some of the past Disney princes ... {{a lot of them are}} kind of soft and they're not like people we think are that cool," [...] continuing, [...] "They're good guys, so I guess we sort of took that to the other extreme." [...] However, some of the filmmakers themselves were concerned that Flynn was becoming too edgy. Greno revealed that [...] "There were people ... who were <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>worried</b> because they were hearing these rumors, 'Well, it's not a prince it's a thief. He's kind of a ladies' man, and he's very arrogant.'" [...] Greno summarized Flynn's conception and development to Orange: ...|$|E

2500|$|Although forty-six drivers {{attempted}} to qualify; according to NASCAR's qualifying procedure, only forty-three could race. Biffle clinched his first pole {{position of the}} season, {{with a time of}} 15.324. He was joined on the grid's front row by Allemdinger. Newman qualified third, Jeff Gordon took fourth, and Keselowski started fifth. The driver that failed to qualify was Timmy Hill, and Robby Gordon withdrew because of issues with his car's engine. After the qualifier Biffle said, [...] "I got in the gas fairly early [...] and was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>worried</b> about making the rest of the corner, It got loose up off of both ends because I went in the gas so early {{in the middle of the}} corner, just pushing the envelope as much as I could." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band {{dedicated}} {{two days}} to rehearsals. The rehearsal sessions were tense and difficult, with the band running into problems performing various songs. During the sessions, Cobain disagreed with MTV {{as to how the}} performance should be presented. Producer Alex Coletti recollected that the network was unhappy with the band's choice of the Meat Puppets as guests ("They wanted to hear the 'right' names - Eddie Vedder or Tori Amos or God knows who," [...] Coletti recalled) and the dearth of hit Nirvana songs on the setlist. Upset, the day before filming was set to take place, Cobain refused to play. However, he appeared at the studio the following afternoon. Cobain was suffering from drug withdrawal and nervousness at the time; one observer said, [...] "There was no joking, no smiles, no fun coming from him... Therefore, everyone was more than <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>worried</b> about his performance." ...|$|E

She stated in 2005,"I did a leg of his '94 European tour, but we weren't playing to his largest crowds. But there was still something very special about his audience. Initially I was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> nerve-wracked, <b>worrying</b> they'd boo me off the stage, but I got a wonderful response. I was also really nervous about meeting him, {{but he was so}} nice and supportive. He told me if there was anything I ever needed, just to let him know." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{last time}} I saw Bonnie “Prince” Billy {{was at the}} Tivoli at the {{beginning}} of 1998. He was trading under the name of Will Oldham then and, like Will Robinson, another of his aliases, he was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> lost in space. It was a brilliant set, but also exasperating and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>worrying.</b> Oldham huddled {{at the side of the}} stage avoiding the spotlight, mumbling to himself, and the band (which included the Dirty Two, Jim White and Mick Turner) looked increasingly perturbed, as though it was turning into a bad night in Roswell. Certainly there are fresh signs of confidence in his recent recordings. Master and Everyone is more sprightly and tuneful than earlier work and he has even caused consternation with the smoothed-over Nashville sound of his Greatest Palace Music re-recordings. It is as though Will Oldham would like some profile - a bit of success and recognition for his singular talent. Fronting a four piece band, featuring his brother Paul on bass and Matt and Spencer Sweeney on guitar and drums, “Prince” Billy is very much in charge as he opens with the rippling guitar chords of Ohio River Boat Song. It has a sweet, spare melancholy, with harmonies from Matt Sweeney and singer Cindy Hopkins blending with Oldham’s artfully expressive off-note vocals...|$|R

But he had <b>a</b> <b>little</b> mental <b>worry</b> now which had for the moment eclipsed his physical ailments. He tapped the ground impatiently with his stick until the door of the dressing-room swung open, and a tall, elegant lady of rather more than middle age swept into the chamber.

25|$|While in the 18th {{century the}} fact that one of its House of Lords {{entrance}} opened directly onto <b>a</b> street caused <b>little</b> <b>worry,</b> in the Ireland of 1922 with a civil war raging, the building was simply too insecure {{to be used as a}} modern-day parliament building. While the House of Commons entrance was surrounded by railings, it offered only minimal parking space and minimal security from attack, and practically no means of escape in the event of an attack. In contrast Leinster House was located well in from the streets that surrounded it, had considerable parking potential and was far more secure in the event of an anti-treaty republican attack on the Free State Dáil and Seanad.|$|R
40|$|Effective and {{efficient}} communication is direly required {{to compete in}} this ever-changing modern world. The importance of English as a key foreign language is unquestionable which emphasizes learning it so well as to be its competent user. Teaching English {{as a second language}} (ESL) is a very challenging task but a language teacher (LT) can make it a success and enjoyable with the help of introducing different activities in the class and by the integration of the four Language Learning Skills (LLSs), i. e. Listening skill, Reading Skill, Writing Skill and Speaking Skill. Ironically the teachers of English language have been concentrating on just one language skill, i. e. ""Writing Skill"". Some others (<b>a</b> <b>little</b> more <b>worried</b> and helpful) take in account reading skill but not in the same level. This thesis argues that any language can't be taught in isolation; we must integrate the four LLSs to produce proficient users of that language...|$|R

5000|$|Sire de Grugy {{made his}} first {{appearance}} at the Cheltenham Festival when {{he was one of}} eleven horses to contest the Queen Mother Champion Chase. He started the 11/4 favourite in a field which included Captain Conan, Somersby, Special Tiara and the 2011 winner Sizing Europe. His odds had lengthened after doubt about his ability to cope with the peculiarities of the course and the drying ground. Moore rode the horse with great confidence, holding him up {{at the back of the}} field before moving up to track the leaders three fences from the finish. He took the lead approaching the last and went clear to win by six lengths from Somersby. After the race, Jamie Moore said [...] "I've got a good rapport with this horse, I love him to pieces. It's all down to him. It's a great effort by Dad as well. He's had no credit this season, as far as I'm concerned, but it's all down to the horse. I love him so much. It's tremendous for all the family. It proves we can do it". Gary Moore commented [...] "it's something I hoped would happen but it doesn't happen very often. The plan worked out very well. The horse is professional and easy to train to a certain extent. He trod on a stone 10 days ago and it was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>worry</b> but it couldn't have gone any better today". Sire de Grugy, who had already been named British jump racing's Horse of the Year, ended his season by repeating his 2013 success in the Celebration Chase at Sandown. Starting the 2/7 favourite against five opponents, he took the lead at the second last fence and won by three and a quarter lengths from the mare Pepite Rose. Jamie Moore said that the horse was unsuited by the [...] "tacky" [...] ground whilst his trainer said [...] "He was the most on edge he’s been all season when I was saddling him and he was probably coming to end of his tether. But that shows what a great horse he is." ...|$|R
