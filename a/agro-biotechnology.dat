40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the {{problems related to}} assigning or denying intellectual property rights to biotechnological innovation, with particular reference to <b>agro-biotechnologies</b> and the relations between developed and developing countries. There {{are two types of}} problems to consider. First, the aim of protecting property rights on innovations is to create incentives towards research and innovation in general, which in some cases may be beneficial to society, in others not so. If the assignment of an intellectual property right does not guarantee the potential beneficial use of new knowledge, not assigning rights would not prevent its potentially dangerous utilization. Secondly, the holder of an intellectual property right has a power of exclusion which limits access by others to the newly produced knowledge. However, the production of new knowledge is very often a process which starts from a base of existing knowledge. Hence, discouraging access to existing knowledge also means discouraging the process of producing new knowledge. Paradoxically then, in protecting intellectual property we obtain the opposite result to the one expected and desired. Moreover, the holder of an intellectual property right may end up with excessive market power when commercializing the innovation. This pape...|$|R
40|$|The fast {{development}} of <b>agro-biotechnologies</b> {{asks for a}} harmonized approach in risk analysis of GMO's releases, where "risk analysis" entails the assessment, management and communication of risk. Risk assessment consists {{in the evaluation of}} the likelihood that a hazard occurs, associated with the presence of the receptor(s) in the receiving environment, and the determination of their potential degree of exposure to the hazard. The whole process has to be both science based and applied case by case, and it involves a very complicated procedure that needs to be transformed in an operational and standardized tool. Beginning in 2003, an expert group on behalf of the Italian Ministry of the Environment elaborated an Operating Model for the Environmental Risk Assessment (OMERA) mainly addressed to scientists, companies, regulators, environmentalists, and also aiming to provide the stakeholders with a scientifically correct source of information. OMERA is based on a logic scheme, moving from the assumption that the occurring of a risk, associated to the release of a GMO into the environment, is strictly related to the presence of four elements: a) source; b) diffusion factors; c) dispersal routes; d) receptors. It comprises two main components: a conceptual model represented as a flowchart and an electronic Questionnaire (eQ) driven by a relational database (Microsoft Office Access). The eQ includes sets of questions specifically formulated for each box of the flowchart that create a "decision tree" that can be followed from the source to all the components of the conceptual model. Completing the eQ leads to the identification of the potentially affected receptors and related potential effects. Within the framework of a LIFE+ project (MAN-GMP-ITA) a multidisciplinary group was formed to validate and improve this methodology. The questionnaire has been filled simulating the release of herbicide tolerant GT 73 oilseed rape and insect resistant MON 810 maize in different experimental areas. The results attested that OMERA allows the collection and comparison of experimental data in a standard way {{and at the same time}} leads to the identification of receptors, potential effects and related monitoring activities specifically for the case study. The experiences described in this paper have shown the potential area of improvement of OMERA to achieve a more functional Decision Supporting System (DSS) that would give a quantitative risk evaluation and the extension to commercial fields. As for OMERA, the DSS will be user-friendly and could be easily modified and adapted to specific situations i. e risk assessment of GM crop field trials...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Agro-biotechnology</b> is {{considered}} as a strong potential {{to speed up the}} movement towards industrialization in Malaysia due to the country’s specific needs and social, geographical and industrial context. The level of adoption of agricultural biotechnology in Malaysia should be accelerated to change this potential to actual improve. Academic centers play a great role in Malaysian context because they are the main providers for biotechnology. The aim {{of this paper is to}} determine and optimize the technology adoption scenario in Malaysia from the viewpoint of academic researchers. Based on the previous studies the general predictors of the level of adoption are determined as six factors including level of knowledge, amount of funds, level of acceptance and receptiveness, level of cooperation, level of transfer of technology and personal characteristics. According to academic researchers, among the variables mentioned above, level of knowledge, acceptance and transfer of technology influence the level of adoption of biotechnology innovation in Malaysian <b>agro-biotechnology</b> companies. Therefore, to accelerate the adoption of new biotechnology innovations it is suggested that policy makers place greater emphasis on providing facilities to increase the level of knowledge, acceptance and technology transfer as a strategy to accelerate the rate of biotechnology adoption in Malaysia.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of new fundamental knowledge in life sciences is leading to new, "breakthrough" technologies, completely new product ranges, and new innovation trajectories. Some breakthrough technologies are potentially disruptive (Spinardi and Williams, 2005), {{in the sense that}} they step outside existing paradigms, requiring a major shift in product types and in their place in the market. Examples include GM crops in <b>agro-biotechnology,</b> and stem cells and pharmaco-genetics in the pharmaceutical industry. The shift of emphasis from innovation based on chemical knowledge to biotechnology-based pathways creates turbulence in companies' internal product development strategies, changes the balance of competitiveness among companies, and opens up new areas of regulatory uncertainty. At the same time, governance processes are becoming more complex and are placing greater constraints and uncertainties on companies that have made major investments in the development of new types of product over long periods of time.

Among the <b>agro-biotechnology</b> tools, tissue culture ranks first in the micro-propagated and tree crops. DNA marker-aided breeding for a range of traits (particularly to overcome diseases and pests or low input environments) should become the second most important application of <b>agro-biotechnology</b> in the mid-term. Molecular markers are being used worldwide to tag specific chromosome segments bearing the desired gene(s) to be transferred (or incorporated) into breeding lines (or populations). In this way, indirect selection with co-dominant molecular markers tightly linked to the gene(s) controlling the characteristic(s) of interest improves response to selection, because heritability for co-dominant markers equals to 1. Molecular markers are therefore descriptors that offer reproducible results for characterizing genotypes. Similarly, applied plant genomics also improves the understanding of crop gene pools, which are being enlarged by including transgenes and “native ” gene pools. Furthermore, finding new genes adds value to traditional agricultural products. There are many on-going applications of DNA markers in research-for-development and crop improvement for crops grown by African farmers.

In this report, the entire K. pneumoniae nif gene cluster was reassembled as operon-based BioBrick parts in Escherichia coli. It provided ~ 100 % activity of native K. pneumoniae system. Based on the expression levels of these BioBrick parts, a T 7 RNA polymerase-LacI expression system was used to replace the σ(54) -dependent promoters located upstream of nif operons. Expression patterns of nif operons were critical for the maximum activity of the recombinant system. By mimicking these expression levels with variable-strength T 7 -dependent promoters, ~ 42 % of the nitrogenase activity of the σ(54) -dependent nif system was achieved in E. coli. When the newly constructed T 7 -dependent nif system was challenged with different genetic and physiological conditions, it bypassed the original complex regulatory circuits, with minor physiological limitations.

In contrast to other European countries, Germany follows the concept of cooperative GMO-free zones where neighbouring farmers contractually refrain from GMO cultivation. In this article, we address the question which underlying factors could account for the establishment of cooperative GMO-free zones in Germany. Drawing on the existing literature on spatial agglomeration of different farming systems and the establishment of GMO-free zones, we provide the first systematic study on driving factors for the regional formation of GMO-free zones in Germany. The empirical analysis is based on a unique data set at the federal states level for the years 2004 to 2007. We show that infestation rates with the European Corn Borer, imminent Bt maize cultivation in the near vicinity and the number of arriving tourists mainly account for the establishment of cooperative GMO-free zones. This finding is consistent with the view that it is more the overall rejection of <b>agro-biotechnology</b> by broad strata of the population, including stakeholders in tourism and environmental protection, than economic benefits at the farm level which make German regions establish GMO-free zones.

A way forward in integrating the concept of [...] "systemic risks" [...] in GMO decision making could be the application of internationally recognised instruments as the Strategic Environmental Assessment.

This article conducts an exploratory survey of the characteristics of the Irish neoliberal ecological regime during and after the Celtic Tiger, identifying the opening of new commodity frontiers (such as fracking, water, <b>agro-biotechnology,</b> and biopharma) constituted in the neoliberal drive to appropriate and financialize nature. I argue for the usefulness of applying not only the tools of world-systems analysis, but also Jason W. Moore’s world-ecological paradigm, to analysis of Ireland as a semi-periphery. What is crucial to a macro-ecological understanding of Ireland’s role in the neoliberal regime of the world-ecology is the inextricability of its financial role as a tax haven and secrecy jurisdiction zone from its environmental function as a semi-peripheral pollution and water haven. We can adapt Jason W. Moore’s slogan that “Wall Street…becomes a way of organizing all of nature, characterized by the financialization of any income-generating activity” (Moore 2011 b: 39) to say that to say that the “IFSC is a way of organizing nature,” with pernicious consequences for water, energy, and food systems in Ireland. Financial service centers and pharmaceutical factories, plantations and cattle ranches, tax havens and pollution havens, empires and common markets are all forms of environment-making that constellate human relations and extra-human processes into new ecological regimes. More expansive, dialectical understandings of “ecology” as comprising the whole of socio-ecological relations within the capitalist world-ecology—from farming to pharma to financialization—are crucial to forming configurations of knowledge able not only to take account of Ireland’s role in the environmental history of capitalism, but also to respond to the urgent ecological crises of the neoliberal present...|$|E
40|$|Misunderstandings {{sometimes}} fly about between {{scientists and}} journalists: the former provide indigestible information, it is said, {{and the latter}} misrepresent. Yet, like mealie porridge and a sauce, they need each other, and so, in mid-October 2002, scientists and journalists, mainly from countries in eastern and southern Africa, convened in the Zambian capital, Lusaka, for a workshop on <b>agro-biotechnology</b> and food security in the region. The workshop created close working ties between them, and opened the journalists eyes to {{the positive and negative}} contribution of biotechnology, in its broad scope, to food security. Visits to laboratories to learn how disease-free planting materials for cassava, sweet potatoes and bananas are being produced using tissue culture techniques demonstrated a positive tool. The introduction of genetically modified crops (GMC), whose effects have not been fully researched in African countries, nor elsewhere, presented a darker side. Scientists from Africa and beyond pushed for more research before their introduction, fearing negative repercussions on biodiversity and human health because of possible mutation of the genes in the imported GMC. The workshop indeed sensitised the scribes to the contribution that biotechnology, if well-managed, can make to food security by helping farmers grow productive pest- and disease-free crops. If it is not well researched or fails to use indigenous knowledge, however, it can pose threats to both health and environment. The whole endeavour was co-led by the Participatory Ecological Land Use Management (PELUM) association, CTA, KEPA Zambia, the Biomedical Research and Training Institute in Zambia and the Biotechnology and Development Monitor of The Netherlands, with extra funding from Novib. These agencies, plus the regional association of agricultural and scientific media professionals which was launched at the workshop, laid out extensive plans for follow-up.

40|$|<b>Agro-biotechnology</b> and agro-bio-chemical {{sciences}} {{will play}} a crucial role in building the future bioenergy portfolio and the resulting bio-based industry, which means that biotechnologists and chemists will focus their research on efficient processes of energy bioconversion from renewable resources and will support developing biomass-based product lines for industrial and agricultural sectors in an efficient and sustainable way. Being confronted with limited and successively depleted reserves of fossils, it is high time to reorient research from petro-chemical conversion processes to bio-chemical ones. Many processes of converting biomass to energy and bioproducts were developed but during the industrial era, due to the enormous pressure on fossil conversion, they have not been implemented. Implementation of the concept of a biochemical refinery (or a biorefinery) as an analogue to a petrochemical refinery is a challenge for the present time. The philosophy of a biorefinery is quite simple. It is a facility which produces a spectrum of bioproducts, including intermediates, bioenergy and biofuels, and all the biorefinery products contribute significantly to the global economy. As a result, a new market of bioproducts appears, which will require a special economic approach that will consider all and any elements of sustainable development, including environmental and social aspects. In other words, it will need a bio-based sustainable economy or simply bio-economy. Two hypotheses related to development of the biorefinery concept have been stated in this paper: 1) sustainable development needs sustainable energy, and 2) sustainable energy needs sustainable agriculture. Both are discussed in the context of bioconversion products and agri-energy complexes, including such facilities as a biogas plant, as well some elements of biorefinery production. In the conclusions it was stated that (i) biomass has a chance to be the main source of energy in the 21 st century but it needs some changes in agriculture (ii) biogas plant is an environmental necessity and (iii) biorefinery — biofuels today, but the goal is to maximize the value of biomass...|$|E
40|$|The {{building}} of <b>agro-biotechnology</b> capabilities in small countries: The cases of Costa Rica, New Zealand and Uruguay. Isabel Bortagaray 411 pages Directed by Dr. Susan E. Cozzens This dissertation {{has studied the}} role of institutional environments on the {{building of}} agro-biotechnological capabilities in small countries, through a comparative case study design. The key question was whether the institutional environments in Costa Rica, New Zealand and Uruguay have evolved {{in a way that}} have fostered or hindered the transition towards modern biotechnology at the level of firms and sector. Biotechnology provided a particularly interesting area of study because of the dramatic changes it has undergone since the 1970 s and consequently, it facilitated to study the transition from second generation to third generation biotechnology. Innovation studies have trend to focus on pharmaceutical biotechnology. This research however, attempted to understand the dynamics behind biotechnology applied to agriculture, in countries with agricultural-based economies. In this context three small countries were selected: Costa Rica, New Zealand and Uruguay, based on some commonalities in terms of size (population), their reliance on agriculture, and some historical features that inter-connect them. The choice of biotechnology applied to agriculture enabled to study {{the extent to which the}} institutional environments have changed and processed change vis a vis fundamental technological development. The institutional environment was defined as composed by institutions (rules of the game), the web of organizations (players of the game), and policies. Technological capabilities were defined as composed by skills, processes and resources. Primary data was collected based on in-depth interviews to research organizations, hybrid research-related organizations, firms, and policy-making agencies in each country. These findings suggest that institutional thickness (number and variety of organizations and institutions), cohesiveness (shared sense of strategic purpose), and coherence between institutions and policies with regard to their goals and means are crucial for strengthening more complex, cumulative, encompassing (different biotechnologies with multiple focuses), and expanding biotechnologies.
