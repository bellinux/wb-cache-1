25|$|A decree of 23 March 1982 {{listed the}} offices {{responsible}} for testing lifting equipment other than lifts and building-site hoists, while a decree issued in May {{that same year}} 1982 extended its provisions to agriculture. Under a decree of 31 March 1982, the general health and safety regulations for dangerous machinery and appliances were extended to include portable hand operated machinery and appliances. Exceptions for certain less dangerous appliances were laid down in a decree of June 1982. In regards to the agricultural sector, a decree of 8 March 1982 laid down the conditions attached to the <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> electrical <b>installations</b> in agricultural undertakings and specified which offices are authorized to test these installations. In 1983, leave was introduced for setting up businesses and sabbatical leave for wage-earners, and in June that year, a law was passed that completed the incorporation into French Law of a 1977 European Council Directive on the approximation {{of the laws of}} the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of businesses.|$|R
50|$|Because Canada {{uses the}} {{accreditation}} {{model of a}} national accrediting authority, if an organisation tests a firestop in or for use in Canada, {{in accordance with the}} correct standard (ULC-S115), but is not accredited by the SCC, the test results cannot be used to in any <b>approvals</b> <b>of</b> field <b>installations</b> on Canadian construction sites. If, on the other hand, the test laboratory is also accredited for product certification, then before the test takes place, a follow-up or certification agreement is anticipated between the certifier and the submitter of the test who desires a rating or a listing. An inspector from the certifying organisation witnesses the manufacture of the product or products to be tested, and checks the manufacturing procedures against the process standard that is in place and by then on file with the certifying organisation. The process standard includes all information necessary to manufacture the product or products, including equipment descriptions, tolerances, chemical formulas and purchasing specifications for ingredients or components. The manufactured goods are sealed by the inspector and then shipped to the laboratory, where the contents are used to build the test specimen in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.|$|R

40|$|MBA Professional ReportThe rapidly {{changing}} demands and increasing complexity in software application deployment have necessitated and improved approaches for delivering rapid software application support and updates to non-resident {{students at the}} Naval Postgraduate School. The delivery of course material to non-resident students on locked-down computer systems, i. e., NMCI, has become more difficult with the increased security requirements over the past year. Many NPS course offerings require <b>installation</b> and development <b>of</b> various software and programs on student workstations, which is prohibited by policy. Moreover, the process <b>of</b> gaining <b>approval</b> and <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> the course software is often longer than the upgrade cycle of the material, which affects both resident and non-resident students' ability to fully participate and benefit from the learning experience. This problem poses a challenge for the Information Technology Academic and Client Support (ITACS) department at NPS. To counter this problem, NPS must implement a new system wide virtual software delivery method that would: a) provide easy, client-less, conflictfree application deployment and rollback; b) reduce costs for support and regression testing by delivering fully tested applications to users; c) reduce infrastructure requirements and costs with no client or server components to manage or maintain; and, d) improve enterprise security {{with the power to}} transparently run applications in user-mode on locked-down PCs...|$|R
40|$|Prostate cancer (CaP) {{metastasis}} to bone {{results in}} mixed osteolytic and osteoblastic lesions {{associated with high}} morbidity and there is mounting evidence that the urokinase-type plasminogen (uPA) system is causatively involved in the progression of CaP. Adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are promising tools for cell-mediated gene therapy with the advantage of osteogenic potential, a critical issue {{in the case of}} osteolytic metastases. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic use of engineered murine MSCs for in vivo delivery of the uPA antagonist amino-terminal fragment (hATF) in order to impair osteolytic CaP cells progression in bone and to repair bone lesions. Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) revealed that both primary MSCs (pMSCs) and MSC line C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 (C 3) expressing hATF (MSC-hATF) inhibited significantly intra-tibial PC- 3 -Luc growth following co-injection in SCID mice. Furthermore, micro-computed tomography (microCT) imaging of vascular network clearly demonstrated a significant decrease of tumor-associated angiogenesis and a protection from tumor-induced osteolysis in MSC-hATF treated mice. Importantly, the osteogenic potential of MSC-hATF cells was unaffected and area of new bone formation was evidenced in 60 % of animals. Altogether, these data support the concept of MSC-based therapy of tumor osteolysis disease, indicating that MSCs may combine properties of vehicle for angiostatic agent with osteogenic potential. ______________________________________________________________________________ Author contributions: V.

5000|$|Displays at 22 IRT Flushing Line and the 5 IRT Dyre Avenue Line {{stations}} {{are not expected}} to be operational until the late 2010s, with the delay being attributed to upgrades to upgrading the signal system with CBTC for the IRT Flushing Line stations and to signal modernizations for IRT Dyre Avenue Line stations.
