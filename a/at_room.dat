5|$|<b>At</b> <b>room</b> temperature, it is a {{colourless}} gas, {{like all}} of the hydrogen halides except hydrogen fluoride, since hydrogen cannot form strong hydrogen bonds to the large and only mildly electronegative iodine atom. It melts at −51.0°C and boils at −35.1°C. It is an endothermic compound that can exothermically dissociate <b>at</b> <b>room</b> temperature, although the process is very slow unless a catalyst is present: the reaction between hydrogen and iodine <b>at</b> <b>room</b> temperature to give hydrogen iodide does not proceed to completion. The H–I bond dissociation energy is likewise {{the smallest of the}} hydrogen halides, at 295kJ/mol.|$|E
5|$|Argon has {{approximately}} the same solubility in water as oxygen and is 2.5 times more soluble in water than nitrogen.

5|$|<b>At</b> <b>room</b> temperature, {{fluorine}} is a gas of diatomic molecules, {{pale yellow}} when pure (sometimes described as yellow-green).

5|$|Finely divided {{metallic}} osmium is pyrophoric and {{reacts with}} oxygen <b>at</b> <b>room</b> temperature, forming volatile osmium tetroxide.

5|$|Fluorine {{reacts with}} lead <b>at</b> <b>room</b> temperature, forming lead(II) fluoride.

5|$|The oxalate of americium(III), vacuum dried <b>at</b> <b>room</b> temperature, has the {{chemical}} formula Am2(C2O4)3·7H2O. Upon heating in vacuum, it loses water at 240°C and starts decomposing into AmO2 at 300°C, the decomposition completes at about 470°C. The initial oxalate dissolves in nitric acid with the maximum solubility of 0.25g/L.|$|E
5|$|The {{softness}} of copper partly explains its high electrical conductivity (59.6×106S/m) and high thermal conductivity, second highest (second only to silver) among pure metals <b>at</b> <b>room</b> temperature. This {{is because the}} resistivity to electron transport in metals <b>at</b> <b>room</b> temperature originates primarily from scattering of electrons on thermal vibrations of the lattice, which are relatively weak in a soft metal. The maximum permissible current density of copper in open air is approximately 3.1×106A/m2 of cross-sectional area, above which it begins to heat excessively.|$|E
5|$|A {{more radical}} {{development}} was the synthesis in 2006 of bis(diisopropylamino)cyclopropenylidene by Bertrand's group. In this compound, which is stable <b>at</b> <b>room</b> temperature, the carbene atom {{is connected to}} two carbon atoms, in a three-member ring that retains the aromaticity and geometry of the cyclopropenylidene ring. This example demonstrated {{that the presence of}} heteroatoms next to the carbene is not necessary for stability, either.|$|E
