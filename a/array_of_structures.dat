500|$|The Maya {{produced}} a vast <b>array</b> <b>of</b> <b>structures,</b> and have left an extensive architectural legacy that places the Maya civilization {{as one of}} the great preindustrial civilizations of the world. Maya architecture also incorporates various art forms and hieroglyphic texts. Masonry architecture built by the Maya evidences craft specialization in Maya society, centralized organization and the political means to mobilize a large workforce. It is estimated that a large elite residence at Copán required an estimated 10,686 man-days to build, which compares to 67-man-days for a commoner's hut. It is further estimated that 65% of the labour required to build the noble residence was used in the quarrying, transporting, and finishing of the stone used in construction, and 24% of the labour was required for the manufacture and application of limestone-based plaster. Altogether, it is estimated that two to three months were required for the construction of the residence for this single noble at Copán, using between 80 and 130 full-time labourers. A Classic-period city like Tikal was spread over , with an urban core covering [...] The labour required to build such a city was immense, running into many millions of man-days. The most massive structures ever erected by the Maya were built during the Preclassic period. Craft specialization would have required dedicated stonemasons and plasterers by the Late Preclassic, and would have required planners and architects.|$|E

The samples are then clustered into k groups, based upon how similar they are to each other in spatial configuration, using algorithms such as k-means clustering. The parameters n and k are chosen according to the application (see discussion on complexity below). The centroids of the clusters are then taken to represent the fragment. Further optimization can be performed to ensure that the centroid possesses ideal bond geometry, as it was derived by averaging other geometries.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this study, the {{manufacturing}} methods and imaging principles <b>of</b> cone-shaped <b>arrays</b> <b>of</b> micro-nano <b>structure</b> films were examined. Because optical films fabricated using cone-shaped <b>arrays</b> <b>of</b> micro-nano <b>structures</b> generate a double diffusion and produce diverse light effects on light sources, these optical films {{can be used}} effectively to enhance optical efficiency and can thus be used widely in liquid crystal displays. The experimental steps for producing cone-shaped <b>arrays</b> <b>of</b> micro-nano-structure films were as follows: First, a silicon wafer was spun off water, bake-dried, and applied with a photoresist coating, which was soft-baked on a hot plate. Next, the photoresist layer was exposed to light by using a stepper, and the wafer was then developed and hard-baked on a hot plate to produce cone-shaped <b>arrays</b> <b>of</b> micro-nano-structure films. This study proposes {{for the first time}} an exposure method applied on a wafer in which focus and exposure dosage of light are adjusted to produce films <b>of</b> cone-shaped micro-nano <b>structures</b> with distinct slopes. Using this method, films can be manufactured through micro-evolutionary changes in the array structure...|$|R

These groups changed locations every few weeks or months. They would take the outer layer of the wigwam with them, and leave the heavy wood frame in place.

50|$|The bad {{locality}} {{of reference}} can be alleviated in some cases: if a structure {{can be divided}} into groups of fields that are generally accessed together, an array can be constructed for each group, and its elements are records containing only these subsets <b>of</b> the larger <b>structure's</b> fields. (see data oriented design). This is a valuable way of speeding up access to very large structures with many members, while keeping the portions <b>of</b> the <b>structure</b> tied together. An alternative to tying them together using array indexes is to use references to tie the portions together, but this can be less efficient in time and space. Another alternative is to mock up a record structure in a single-dimensional array by declaring an <b>array</b> <b>of</b> n*m size and referring to the r-th field in record i as element as array(m*i+r).

The most widely studied systems are those involving rare earth metal oxides, Ln2O3, including yttria, Y2O3. Rare earth metal cations are generally very stable, have similar chemical properties to one another and are similar in size to Bi3+, which has a radius of 1.03 Å, making them all excellent dopants. Furthermore, their ionic radii decrease fairly uniformly from La3+ (1.032 Å), through Nd3+, (0.983 Å), Gd3+, (0.938 Å), Dy3+, (0.912 Å) and Er3+, (0.89 Å), to Lu3+, (0.861 Å) (known as the ‘lanthanide contraction’), making them useful to study the effect of dopant size on the stability of the Bi2O3 phases.|$|E
50|$|In computing, a {{group of}} {{parallel}} arrays (also known as structure of arrays or SoA) {{is a form of}} implicit data structure that uses multiple arrays to represent a singular array of records.

This contrasts with the normal approach of storing all fields of each record together in memory (also known as <b>array</b> <b>of</b> <b>structures</b> or AoS).

Irregular applications, which operate on pointer-based data structures, are hard to optimize in modern computer architectures due to their intrinsic unpredictable patterns of memory accesses. In this paper we explore a memory locality-driven set of data-structures in order to attenuate the memory bandwidth limitations from typical irregular algorithms. We identify the inefficiencies in the standard Java implementation of a priority-queue as one of the main memory limitations in Prim’s Minimal Spanning Tree algorithm. We also present a priority-queue using the data layout inspired in Van Emde Boas for ordering heaps. We also implement optimizations in the graph data-structure and explore ways to efficiently combine it with the memory-efficient priority-queue.
