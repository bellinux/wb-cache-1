5|$|Early grunge concerts were sparsely {{attended}} (many by {{fewer than}} <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>people)</b> but Sub Pop photographer Charles Peterson's pictures {{helped create the}} impression that such concerts were major events.

Other record labels in the Pacific Northwest that helped promote grunge included C/Z Records, Estrus Records, EMpTy Records and PopLlama Records.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, a Montreal anti-cult {{organization}} called Info-Cult made statements against the Raëlian Church with {{an article on}} Le Devoir, branding Raëlians as promoters of fascism and racism, due to the church's use of the swastika {{as part of their}} logo and the Raëlian description of an extraterrestrial global government in which those less than ten percent above average intelligence are excluded from the electorate. Outside Info-Cult's office, Raëlians spoke against the act of discriminating against a religious minority. On 2 January 1992, <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>people</b> protested against the use of the swastika in the Raëlian logo in Miami's Eden Roc Hotel. The use of the swastika and other Raelian practices has led to criticism from the group Hineni of Florida, an Orthodox Jewish organization.|$|E

Typhoon Abby also brought several consecutive days of rain to southern and central Japan, resulting in widespread damage. Commercial traffic by land, sea, and air was also paralyzed by the cyclone, stranding 25,900. Moreover, over 10,000fishing boats took refuge in harbors.

5|$|For all {{the claims}} about the {{potential}} for violence, election day, November 7, remained mostly calm across the state. Fewer than <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>people</b> were arrested statewide. Voting returns were slow, and on election night, the race was still too close to call. When the official tally was announced, Taylor had won by a vote of 193,714 to 191,331. Former governor John Y. Brown, nominated by a dissident group of Democrats, had garnered 12,040 votes, and Populist candidate John G. Blair had captured 2,936. Though the Board of Elections was thought to be controlled by Goebel, it rendered a surprise 2–1 decision to certify the election results. The board's majority opinion claimed {{that they did not have}} any judicial power and were thus unable to hear proof or swear witnesses, leaving them without grounds to invalidate any votes. Taylor was inaugurated on December 12, 1899.|$|E
5|$|In extreme western Cuba, {{damage was}} very severe from the strong winds, likened {{to the impact}} of a tornado. Severe damage was {{reported}} in Los Arroyos and Arroyos de Mantua. In the latter location, around <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>people</b> were killed, 50 were injured, and nearly every building in the town was severely damaged; heavy losses also occurred to the tobacco crop. Across western Pinar del Río Province, the hurricane destroyed all communication links. Further from the center, the capital city of Havana recorded southerly winds of 72mph (116km/h), as well as a minimum pressure of about 999mbar (29.50inHg). Around the country, the hurricane capsized several ships, primarily fishing vessels. The death toll in the country was estimated at around 90. In the days after the storm, Cuban President Zayas authorized about $30,000 in relief aid to send to hurricane victims in Pinar del Río.|$|E

5|$|Radau summarises one {{passage from}} the book after another: the orang utans of Borneo wrestling open the jaws of a crocodile, or killing a python; the Timorese walking up tall trees, leaning back on ropes as they pull {{themselves}} upwards; the indescribable taste of a durian fruit, at once recalling custard, almond paste, roasted onions, sherry {{and a host of}} other things, that melts on the tongue, that one does not want to stop eating; more, the fruit has a repulsive odour, and the tree is dangerous, as the hard and heavy fruits can fall on your head. Radau follows Wallace up to the high plateaux of Java, where there are cypress forests covered in moss and lichen; finally at the summit the vegetation seems European, an island vegetation recalling the resemblance between the plants of the high Alps and of Lapland. And in Celebes, men run amok, generally killing <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>people</b> before meeting their own death.|$|E
5|$|While fleeing, Stan {{calls his}} mother, who is too busy protesting Terrance and Phillip {{to listen to}} his problems. More than <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>people</b> have killed {{themselves}} against the headquarters building. Eventually, the network agrees to take the show off the air, not because of the deaths but because of the stench of the protesters' explosive diarrhea. Meanwhile, Death continues chasing the boys, but stops in front of a television playing Terrance and Phillip. Death and the boys start laughing together, but after it is taken off the air, Death angrily touches and kills Kenny. Angered, Grandpa Marvin demands that Death kill him, but Death refuses. Death then brings in the spirit of Stan's great great grandfather (Marvin's grandfather), who was killed by Marvin when he was Stan's age; the ghost warns Marvin that he must die of natural causes and not place the burden of his suicide on anybody else's shoulders or else he will spend his eternity after death in limbo.|$|E

50|$|From the 8th century onwards, likely {{sponsored}} by Áed Allán, a Cenél nEógain king of Tara, and Congus, {{the bishop of}} Armagh, early Irish historians carefully constructed propaganda to shore up and cement Uí Néill political supremacy along with the ecclesiastical supremacy of Armagh. This involved the ruthless re-writing and doctoring of genealogies, lists of kings, history, and early annals, tracing the current situation as having primacy {{all the way back}} into the undocumented 5th century. In tandem, about <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>peoples</b> became designated within what was called Uí Néill in Tuaiscirt, of which the Cenél Conaill and Cenél nEógain were the most dominant.|$|R

25|$|Hot Creek {{has been}} a popular {{swimming}} hole for decades. Over <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>people</b> have died in Hot Creek since the late 1960s, {{but most of these}} deaths happened to people who ignored the numerous warning signs and attempted to use the hydrothermal pools as hot tubs (like the stream portion of the creek, these pools alternate in temperature but the eruptions in the pools are of super-heated water in already very hot water). Recent geothermal instability has led to its temporary closure for swimming. Officials are unsure of when (if ever) Hot Creek will officially reopen for swimming.|$|E
