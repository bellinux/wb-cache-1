5|$|A {{securely}} attached toddler will explore freely while the caregiver is present, engage with strangers, be visibly upset when the caregiver departs, and {{happy to see}} the caregiver return. The anxious-ambivalent toddler is anxious of exploration, extremely distressed when the caregiver departs but ambivalent when the caregiver returns. The anxious-avoidant toddler will not explore much, avoid or ignore the parent—showing little emotion when the parent departs or returns—and treat strangers {{much the same as}} caregivers with little emotional range shown. The disorganized/disoriented toddler shows a lack of a coherent style or pattern for coping. Evidence suggests this occurs when the caregiving figure is also an object of fear, thus putting the child in an irresolvable situation regarding approach <b>and</b> <b>avoidance.</b> On reunion with the caregiver, these children can look dazed or frightened, freezing in place, backing toward the caregiver or approaching with head sharply averted, or showing other behaviors implying fear of the person who is being sought. It is thought to represent a breakdown of an inchoate attachment strategy and it appears to affect the capacity to regulate emotions.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} mandate {{coupled with}} subsidies for private insurance {{as a means}} for universal healthcare was considered the best way to win the support of the Senate because it had been included in prior bipartisan reform proposals. The concept goes back to at least 1989, when the conservative The Heritage Foundation proposed an individual mandate as an alternative to single-payer health care. It was championed for a time by conservative economists and Republican senators as a market-based approach to healthcare reform on the basis of individual responsibility <b>and</b> <b>avoidance</b> of free rider problems. Specifically, because the 1986 Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requires any hospital participating in Medicare (nearly all do) to provide emergency care to anyone who needs it, the government often indirectly bore the cost of those without the ability to pay.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} independent contributions of rumination <b>and</b> experiential <b>avoidance</b> in predicting symptoms {{of psychological distress}} among female widowed survivors of war. A decade after the war in Kosovo, 100 widowed survivors of war completed measures of rumination, experiential avoidance, depression, posttraumatic stress, and prolonged grief. Results showed that both rumination <b>and</b> experiential <b>avoidance</b> significantly predicted the symptom severity of prolonged grief, depression, and posttraumatic stress. Furthermore, rumination accounted for additional variance above <b>and</b> beyond experiential <b>avoidance</b> <b>and</b> vice versa. Finally, the interaction of rumination <b>and</b> experiential <b>avoidance</b> did not provide significant explanatory power {{over and above the}} individual main effects. These findings suggest that rumination <b>and</b> experiential <b>avoidance</b> may be significant factors in understanding and treating psychological distress following exposure to potentially traumatic events and loss due to violence...|$|R

40|$|Brand {{avoidance}} {{is a new}} {{topic in}} consumer behavior research. The {{purpose of the study}} was to find the main driver(s) of the brand avoidance behavior among the Chinese mobile consumers. The study was based on the core framework of Lee, et al. (2009) and Knittel et al (2016). The study also applied Ma’s research (2012) to segment the Chinese mobile consumers. A survey was conducted based on the literatures. The findings show that Chinese mobile consumers do not share the same driver for the brand avoidance behavior, the main driver for fashion-taste consumers, trendy but cost-efficient consumers and conservative consumers is moral <b>and</b> identity <b>avoidance.</b> Rational <b>and</b> price-sensitive consumers avoid the brand because of the moral <b>and</b> identity <b>avoidance,</b> <b>and</b> the experiential <b>avoidance</b> for product. Business communication consumers avoid the brand because of the moral <b>and</b> identity <b>avoidance</b> <b>and</b> advertising <b>avoidance.</b> Organizations can use these findings to adjust their marketing strategies and content accordingly...|$|R
5|$|The HVO {{advanced}} north along {{two main}} axes of attack. The western axis advanced from Šuica {{along the main}} road towards Kupres, capturing the village of Donji Malovan on 1 November. The eastern axis of the HVO offensive moved from Ravno towards Rilić. Just as the HVO began to move north, the ARBiH suspended its westward advance. Various explanations for the pause were put forward, including fog, rain, need to secure territorial gains, wear of equipment and fatigue of personnel. Regardless, that day the President of Bosnia and Herzegovina Alija Izetbegović telephoned Alagić requesting an adequate level of cooperation <b>and</b> <b>avoidance</b> of any conflicts with the HVO.

40|$|The {{most widely}} used {{measures}} of avoidance strategies following stressful or traumatic experiences are unidimensional. However, recent work has emphasised the multifactorial nature of avoidance: One intriguing and as yet unexplored distinction is that between attempts at <b>avoidance</b> <b>and</b> successful <b>avoidance.</b> Two studies are reported {{with the aim of}} investigating the differential relationships between attempted <b>and</b> successful <b>avoidance</b> <b>and</b> measures of distress and thought control strategies. In the first study 207 participants completed measures of attempted <b>and</b> successful <b>avoidance</b> along with a measure of distress. The results indicated that distress was associated with attempted avoidance but not successful avoidance. In the second study, 143 participants completed measures of attempted <b>and</b> successful <b>avoidance</b> along with measures of thought control strategies and distress. The results of study two replicated those of study one and also found that attempted avoidance was associated with 'punishment' and 'worry' thought control strategies, whereas, successful avoidance was associated with 'social control' strategies. It was concluded that attempts at avoidance that are not successful are maladaptive following stressful or traumatic experiences but successful avoidance is not. These data highlight the importance of identifying and making explicit the distinction between attempted <b>and</b> successful <b>avoidance</b> in future operational definitions.

40|$|Abstract Background: In present research, the {{structural}} equation modeling {{of the relationship between}} cognitive <b>avoidance</b> <b>and</b> rumination with clinical symptoms of OCD with mediating role of cognitive failure was studied. Materials and Methods: In a descriptive correlational study, 220 patients with OCD were selected from Urmia psychological clinics and completed YBOCS, RRS, CAQ, and CFQ questionnaires. For data analysis, {{structural equation modeling}} (SEM) was used. Results: The results showed that the modified final model is best fitted with present research data <b>and</b> cognitive <b>avoidance,</b> rumination, <b>and</b> cognitive failure paths with OCD <b>and</b> cognitive <b>avoidance,</b> <b>and</b> rumination paths with cognitive failure were significant. Also, indirect paths such as cognitive <b>avoidance</b> <b>and</b> rumination to OCD were significant. Conclusion: According to the results of this study, it can be concluded that in addition to the direct relationship, cognitive failure can adjust the relationship between cognitive <b>avoidance</b> <b>and</b> rumination with OCD. ...|$|R
