5|$|According to Schultheiss, Herrmann, and Jonas, {{although}} Trousseau {{had earlier}} suggested that surgery was <b>a</b> <b>viable</b> <b>option,</b> {{there is no}} evidence that the subject subsequently received treatment; They suggest several possible factors, including legal issues, the subject's refusal, or failed treatment followed by a lack of reporting, for the lack of surgery or evidence of such. Maisonneuve, partially shown in one of the photographs, treated another intersex patient in 1862.|$|E
5|$|The {{continued}} {{exploration of}} Saturn {{is still considered}} to be <b>a</b> <b>viable</b> <b>option</b> for NASA {{as part of their}} ongoing New Frontiers program of missions. NASA previously requested for plans to be put forward for a mission to Saturn that included an atmospheric entry probe and possible investigations into the habitability and possible discovery of life on Saturn's moons Titan and Enceladus.|$|E
5|$|Bird's nest custody is an {{uncommon}} {{form of joint}} custody in which, rather than having the children go from one parent's house to the other parent's house, the parents {{move in and out}} of the house in which the children constantly reside. The goal of this arrangement is to shift the burden of upheaval and moving between homes onto the parents rather than the children. However, due to the high cost of maintaining three households, one for each parent and one for the children, it's rarely <b>a</b> <b>viable</b> <b>option</b> in a custody case.|$|E
40|$|Switching {{costs are}} {{prevalent}} in network industries, and this paper investigates {{their effects on}} market outcome. I find {{that the role of}} switching costs depends on network effects and the outside <b>option.</b> Without <b>a</b> <b>viable</b> outside <b>option,</b> high switching costs can neutralize the tendency towards market dominance associated with network effects, but with <b>a</b> <b>viable</b> outside <b>option,</b> switching costs facilitate market dominance. Furthermore, switching costs lower prices if network effects are modest and there exists <b>a</b> <b>viable</b> outside <b>option,</b> but raise prices otherwise. Understanding these patterns will allow us to better predict the consequences of policies that change switching costs. ...|$|R

5000|$|Vibration {{dampeners}} (otherwise {{known as}} [...] "gummies") are not {{believed to be}} a reliable preventative measure. Rather, proper weight distribution in the racket is thought to be <b>a</b> more <b>viable</b> <b>option</b> in negating shock.|$|R
5|$|In February 1999, Payton {{announced}} that he had a rare autoimmune liver disease known as primary sclerosing cholangitis, which may have led to his cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer). He spent his final months as an advocate for organ transplants, appearing in many commercials to encourage others to donate organs, although by the time his first appeal was recorded, his illness was already too far advanced for transplantation to have been <b>a</b> <b>viable</b> <b>option.</b> In April of that year, Payton made a final public appearance at a Chicago Cubs game with Mike Ditka, where he threw the game's ceremonial first pitch. Author Don Yaeger worked with him during the last weeks of his life to create his autobiography, Never Die Easy.|$|E
5|$|Many {{women are}} {{convinced}} that their husbands are putting their lives at risk by engaging in extramarital sexual relations without using protection; however, because of their secondary status, they are often unwilling to initiate discussions about HIV/AIDS in the home. Most women in Malawi do not view divorce as <b>a</b> <b>viable</b> <b>option,</b> even when their husbands are HIV-positive and refuse {{to protect them from}} the virus by wearing condoms during marital intercourse. Because they lack the education and training needed to seek gainful employment, women are not usually able to support themselves and their children outside of marriage without resorting to commercial sex work for money.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} also shortened the president's term {{from seven}} years to four years, freed the president to seek re-election after an initial term, and moved impeachment trials from the courts to the Senate. They also created {{the office of the}} vice president, whose only roles were to succeed a president unable to complete a term of office, to preside over the Senate, and to cast tie-breaking votes in the Senate. The committee transferred important powers from the Senate to the president, for example the power to make treaties and appoint ambassadors. One controversial issue throughout much of the Convention had been the length of the president's term, and whether the president was to be term limited. The problem had resulted from the understanding that the president would be chosen by Congress; the decision to have the president be chosen instead by an electoral college reduced the chance of the president becoming beholden to Congress, so a shorter term with eligibility for re-election became <b>a</b> <b>viable</b> <b>option.</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we review the {{literature}} on {{the costs and benefits of}} geological carbon storage and the estimates of greenhouse gas permit prices under the Kyoto Protocol commitment period and beyond. Combining these results for a set of circumstances, we find that in the near-term Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is likely to be <b>an</b> economically <b>viable</b> <b>option</b> only in <b>a</b> small set of circumstances, particularly enhanced oil recovery. In the medium and longer term, with improvements in CCS technology and the likelihood of increased greenhouse gas permit prices, CCS is likely to become <b>an</b> economically <b>viable</b> <b>option</b> under <b>a</b> wider range of circumstances...|$|R

50|$|In video games, {{music can}} be streamed, where the audio is {{pre-recorded}} and played back when required. While early video games were restricted to sequenced music, streaming music has become <b>a</b> more <b>viable</b> <b>option</b> as technology has improved.|$|R
25|$|In November 2009, Volkswagen {{announced}} it has hired Karl-Thomas Neumann as its group chief officer for electric traction. VW's Chief of research, Jürgen Leohold, said in 2010 {{the company has}} concluded hydrogen fuel-cell cars are not <b>a</b> <b>viable</b> <b>option.</b>|$|E
25|$|It is arguable that {{in such a}} retail/planning policy {{environment}} use of bicycles {{ceases to}} be <b>a</b> <b>viable</b> <b>option</b> for many shoppers and access to a private motor-car or public transport becomes a necessary prerequisite for access to basic services.|$|E
25|$|In {{other parts}} of the world, {{including}} South America, Eastern Europe, China, and India, butadiene was also produced from ethanol. While not competitive with steam cracking for producing large volumes of butadiene, lower capital costs make production from ethanol <b>a</b> <b>viable</b> <b>option</b> for smaller-capacity plants. Two processes were in use.|$|E
30|$|<b>A</b> <b>viable</b> {{cost-saving}} <b>option</b> is to {{take full}} advantage of the existing simulation tools. However, they are mostly not suited for further redevelopment. Applying parallelization techniques to existing tools is also not easy.|$|R
50|$|During the 1990s free dance parties proliferated in Sydney, {{particularly}} in Sydney Park in St Peters and warehouses of the Inner West. As pressure from police and councils increased, holding {{parties in the}} bush appeared as <b>a</b> more <b>viable</b> <b>option.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Internet {{has brought}} new {{opportunities}} for copywriters to learn their craft, do research and view others' work. Clients, copywriters and art directors can more readily find each other, making freelancing <b>a</b> <b>viable</b> job <b>option.</b>|$|R
25|$|Surgery for {{metastatic disease}}: If metastatic disease is present {{surgical}} treatment may still <b>a</b> <b>viable</b> <b>option.</b> Radical and partial nephrectomy can still occur, {{and in some}} cases if the metastasis is small this can also be surgically removed. This depends on what stage of growth and how far the disease has spread.|$|E
25|$|The line {{opened in}} stages between 1901 and 1908, but closed in 1917, having been requisitioned by the War Office. Re-opening the line after World War I was considered, but {{dismissed}} as <b>a</b> <b>viable</b> <b>option.</b> The B.WH! {{was the only}} railway company in the British Isles to have an exclamation mark in its company title.|$|E
25|$|Always {{interested}} in {{independence from the}} British, Maududi lost faith in the Congress Party and its Muslim allies in the 1920s as the party developed an increasingly Hindu identity. He began to turn more towards Islam, and believed that Democracy could be <b>a</b> <b>viable</b> <b>option</b> for Muslims only if the majority of Indians were Muslim.|$|E
50|$|Steam-powered {{machines}} used belts {{connected to}} a traction engine; often both engine and thresher belonged to a contractor who toured the farms of a district. Steam remained <b>a</b> <b>viable</b> commercial <b>option</b> until the early post-WWII years.|$|R
50|$|Aquaculture in Solomon Islands {{became an}} {{important}} activity in 1983 when an Australian farmer established a private prawn farm in western Guadalcanal, approximately 25 km from Honiara. Still, aquaculture has not yet proven to be <b>a</b> commercially <b>viable</b> <b>option</b> for the Solomon Islands.|$|R
50|$|Today's Special Forces Groups {{and their}} {{unconventional}} warfare capabilities provide <b>a</b> <b>viable</b> military <b>option</b> for <b>a</b> variety of operational taskings that are inappropriate or infeasible for conventional forces, {{making it the}} U.S. military’s premier unconventional warfare force.|$|R
25|$|Although Windows {{does not}} {{natively}} support HFS+, an HFS+ volume on an AirPort Disk {{can be easily}} accessed from Windows. This is because the SMB/CIFS protocol used to access the disk, and hence access from Windows is filesystem-independent. Therefore, HFS+ is <b>a</b> <b>viable</b> <b>option</b> for Windows as well as OS X users, and more flexible than FAT32 as the latter has a 4GiB file size limit.|$|E
25|$|Surgery is also <b>a</b> <b>viable</b> <b>option</b> for {{treatment}} if {{the symptoms are}} caused by a tumor or lesion in the brain or spinal cord. Surgery may also correct symptoms in those where myoclonus affects parts of the face or ear. While DBS is still being studied for use with myoclonus, Deep Brain Stimulation has also been tried in those with this and other movement disorders.|$|E
25|$|Little {{has been}} done with this method in arbuscular {{mycorrhizal}} experiments, but if proven {{to work in a}} controlled experiment, and with further refinement of DNA/RNA fungal community analyses techniques, this may be <b>a</b> <b>viable</b> <b>option</b> to very specifically determine the actively growing portion of AM fungal species across growing seasons, with different plant hosts or treatments, and in the face of climate change.|$|E
50|$|Cornell is {{continuing}} its development of CU-Structural Soil, expanding its use {{as the need}} for trees and other greenery within highly urbanized areas grows.

50|$|EAP-TLS {{is seen as}} the {{superior}} authentication choice for PPTP; however, it requires implementation of a public-key infrastructure for both client and server certificates.

25|$|It had its inaugural {{release in}} 2003 as {{freeware}} for Windows. Dolphin {{was the first}} GameCube emulator to successfully run commercial games. After troubled development in the first years, Dolphin became free and open-source software and subsequently gained support for Wii emulation. Soon after, the emulator was ported to Linux and macOS. As mobile hardware got more powerful over the years, running Dolphin on Android became <b>a</b> <b>viable</b> <b>option.</b>|$|E
25|$|The former {{systems of}} {{catchments}} and private cisterns have been discontinued. Due to political tensions with Spain over the disputed status of Gibraltar, piping {{water from the}} Spanish {{side of the border}} has never been seen as <b>a</b> <b>viable</b> <b>option</b> and Gibraltar's water supply is entirely self-contained within the peninsula. The water supply was partly privatised in 1991 and is now maintained by AquaGib, a subsidiary of the British water company Northumbrian Water, under licence to the Government of Gibraltar.|$|E
25|$|The {{issue of}} whether sublanguages should be {{included}} remains unsettled. Proponents of it argue that with all sublanguages removed, it will result in an impoverished view of language. Since language {{is made up of}} lexicons, grammar and a wide array of different sublanguages, they should be included. However, it is not until recently that it became <b>a</b> <b>viable</b> <b>option.</b> Striking a middle ground by including some sublanguages is contentious because it’s an arbitrary issue of which to include and which not.|$|E
5000|$|The {{additional}} circuitry {{will also}} increase the leakage power of the design/circuit/system/SoC. If the base activity factor of the system bus is not very high, bus encoding may not be <b>a</b> very <b>viable</b> <b>option</b> since it will degrade overall energy consumption due to higher leakage power.|$|R
50|$|Chemotherapy and {{radiotherapy}} {{have been}} shown to be ineffective in cases of neurocutaneous melanosis where malignancy is present.
