5000|$|Perception {{involves}} {{both the}} physical senses (sight, smell, hearing, taste, touch, and proprioception) {{as well as}} the cognitive processes involved in interpreting those senses.

40|$|I {{would like}} to thank Rani Spiegler for the many discussions we had on Behavioral Economics during the last few years. I could not imagine writing this essay without the benefit of his comments, insights, ideas and criticism. Page 1 10 / 22 / 20051. What is the Behavioral Economics “Revolution”? For me, {{economics}} is a collection of ideas and conventions which economists accept and use to reason with. Namely, it is a culture. Behavioral economics represents a transformation of that culture. Nonetheless, as pointed out by Camerer and Loewenstein (2003), its methods are pretty much the same as those introduced by the Game Theory revolution. At the core of most models in Behavioral Economics there are still agents who maximize a preference relation over some space of consequences and the solution in most cases still involves standard equilibrium concepts. However, the behavioral economists are not committed to what is usually referred to rational motivations. An economic fable (or a model <b>as</b> we <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>it)</b> that has at its core fairness, envy, present-bias and the like is by now not only permitted but even preferred...|$|R
60|$|Rowland said {{he would}} do what he could, and brought a chair and placed it near her. He was not in love with her; he disapproved of her; he mistrusted her; and yet he felt it a kind of {{privilege}} to watch her, and he found a peculiar excitement in talking to her. The background of her nature, <b>as</b> he <b>would</b> have <b>called</b> <b>it,</b> was large and mysterious, and it emitted strange, fantastic gleams and flashes. Watching for these rather quickened one's pulses. Moreover, it was not a disadvantage to talk to a girl who made one keep guard on one's composure; it diminished one's chronic liability to utter something less than revised wisdom.|$|R

He rolled about like a tipsy man, holding on, in fact, far more by his spurs than by his knees, to the utter infuriation of Shiver-the-timbers, who kicked and snorted over the down like one of Mephistopheles's Demon-steeds. They had mounted the hill--the deer fled before them in terror--they neared the park palings. In the road beyond them the hounds were just killing their fox, struggling and growling in fierce groups for the red gobbets of fur, a panting, steaming ring of horses round them. Half a dozen voices hailed him as he came up.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the summer}} of 1953, as a 22-year-old Penn student at the Wharton School of Finance, Steinbruck {{realized}} he did not fit into this [...] "seminary for capitalists," [...] <b>as</b> he <b>would</b> later <b>call</b> <b>it.</b> [...] He was a man without direction, no sense of purpose, and casual faith. A bit of a hell-raiser, he frequented seedy bars and hustled money throwing darts. One afternoon, feeling down and out, having just ended an ill-fated romance, he walked into a corner drug store. There, among the trashy romance novels and magazines, was a single paperback copy of Out of My Life and Thought by Albert Schweitzer. The book cost him thirty-five cents. He would later say that it changed his life.|$|R
60|$|On {{the other}} hand, besides, he {{was bound to}} Don Ippolito, {{who had come to}} him as the nearest friend of both, and confided in him. He remembered with a tardy, poignant {{intelligence}} how in their first talk of the Vervains Don Ippolito had taken pains to inform himself that Ferris was not in love with Florida. Could he be less manly and generous than this poor priest, and violate the sanctity of his confidence? Ferris groaned aloud. No, contrive <b>it</b> <b>as</b> he <b>would,</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> by what fair name he chose, he could not commit this treachery. It was the more impossible to him because, in this agony of doubt as to what he should do, he now at least read big own heart clearly, and had no longer a doubt what was in it. He pitied her for the pain she must suffer. He saw how her simple goodness, her blind sympathy with Don Ippolito, and only this, must have led the priest to the mistaken pass at which he stood. But Ferris felt that the whole affair had been fatally carried beyond his reach; he could do nothing now but wait and endure. There are cases in which a man must not protect the woman he loves. This was one.|$|R
60|$|This is peculiarly {{the case}} with {{experiments}} upon mind, or experiments for producing effects {{through the medium of}} voluntary acts of the human mind, so that the contriver must take into consideration the laws of mind in forming his plans. To illustrate this by rather a childish case: I once knew a boy who was employed by his father to remove all the loose small stones, which, from the peculiar nature of the ground, had accumulated in the road before the house. He was to take them up, and throw them over into the pasture, across the way. He soon got tired of picking them up one by one, and sat down upon the bank, to try to devise some better means of accomplishing his work. He at length conceived and adopted the following plan. He set up, in the pasture, a narrow board, for a target, or <b>as</b> boys <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>it,</b> a mark,--and then, collecting all the boys of the neighborhood, he proposed to them an amusement, which boys are always ready for,--firing at a mark. I need not say that the stores of ammunition in the street were soon exhausted; the boys working for their leader, when they supposed they were only finding amusement for themselves.|$|R
60|$|Strether told Waymarsh {{all about}} it that very evening, on their dining {{together}} at the hotel; which needn't have happened, he was all the while aware, hadn't he chosen to sacrifice to this occasion a rarer opportunity. The mention to his companion of the sacrifice was moreover exactly what introduced his recital--or, <b>as</b> he <b>would</b> have <b>called</b> <b>it</b> with more confidence in his interlocutor, his confession. His confession {{was that he had}} been captured and that one of the features of the affair had just failed to be his engaging himself on the spot to dinner. As by such a freedom Waymarsh would have lost him he had obeyed his scruple; and he had likewise obeyed another scruple--which bore on the question of his himself bringing a guest.|$|R
6000|$|Merely {{insert the}} words [...] "sincere repentance and {{amendment}} {{of heart and}} life, and therefore for" [...] salvation,--and is not this truth, and Gospel truth? And is it not {{the meaning of the}} preacher? Did any Methodist ever teach that salvation may be attained without sanctification? This Barrister for ever forgets that the whole point in dispute is not concerning the possibility of an immoral Christian being saved, which the Methodist <b>would</b> deny <b>as</b> strenuously as himself, and perhaps give an austerer sense to the word immoral; but whether morality, or <b>as</b> the Methodists <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>it,</b> sanctification, be the price which we pay for the purchase of our salvation with our own money, or a part of the same free gift. God knows, I am no advocate for Methodism; but for fair statement I am, and most zealously--even for the love of logic, putting honesty out of sight.|$|R

Travelling mainly around the Mount Gambier and Flinders Ranges areas, he also ventured to many other smaller towns and regions. Tilbrook never made any commercial gains from the photographs he took on his trips, however some of his prints were supplied to the railway department in 1901 to decorate the walls of train carriages.Whilst photography was his main goal for the trips, {{he was also a}} keen hunter, and most of the early trips he undertook were primarily for hunting. These hunting trips gave Tilbrook the inspiration to take his camera along to future excursions. In his diary, he speaks of his 1894 trip to the Flinders Ranges, in which he says [...] "although I took my combined hammerless gun and rifle with me, I decided as my main objective to obtain photographic records of the scenes of our explorations." [...] While on his photographic excursions, he would often spend time on his own - or solus, <b>as</b> he <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> - with his camera, which usually meant carrying around very heavy packs of camera gear.
