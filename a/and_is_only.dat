5|$|An earlier specimen, also {{recovered}} from the Lance Formation, was named Agathaumas sylvestris by Edward Drinker Cope in 1872. Originally identified as a hadrosaur, this specimen consists only of post-cranial remains <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> provisionally considered an example of Triceratops.|$|E

5|$|Because it {{died out}} {{relatively}} recently <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> known from subfossil remains, {{it is considered}} to be a modern form of Malagasy lemur. Babakotia radofilai lived during the Holocene epoch and is thought to have disappeared shortly after the arrival of humans to the island, possibly within the last 1000 years. However, the only radiocarbon date that has been reported for it dates back to about 31002800BCE.|$|E
5|$|Diracodon laticeps was {{described}} by Marsh in 1881, from some jawbone fragments. Bakker resurrected D. laticeps in 1986 as a senior synonym of S. stenops, although others note that the material is not diagnostic <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> referable to Stegosaurus sp., making it a nomen dubium.|$|E
5|$|Earned runs are runs {{that are}} {{directly}} attributable to a pitcher's efforts without a lapse by the defense. An unearned run does not adversely impact a pitcher's {{earned run average}} (ERA), <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> possible when an error (including catcher's interference) or a passed ball occurs earlier in the inning. Unearned runs are primarily discussed in rule 10.16 and often require a judgment call by the official scorer.|$|E

5|$|Qualification for European club {{competitions}} {{is determined}} by a team's position in its domestic league, {{as well as how}} successfully a team fares in domestic cup competitions in the previous season. Following the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985, UEFA placed an indefinite ban on all English teams from competing in Europe; the ban was lifted in the 1990-91 season and Arsenal entered in 1991–92 season, giving Arsenal the opportunity to play in the European Cup. Between 1998–99 and 2016–17, Arsenal qualified in nineteen successive UEFA Champions League seasons, an English football record, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> surpassed in Europe by Real Madrid.|$|E

5|$|Some {{noble gases}} have direct {{application}} in medicine. Helium is sometimes {{used to improve}} the ease of breathing of asthma sufferers. Xenon is used as an anesthetic because of its high solubility in lipids, which makes it more potent than the usual nitrous oxide, {{and because it is}} readily eliminated from the body, resulting in faster recovery. Xenon finds application in medical imaging of the lungs through hyperpolarized MRI. Radon, which is highly radioactive <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> available in minute amounts, is used in radiotherapy.|$|E
5|$|The African river {{martin has}} a {{restricted}} distribution; {{it appears to}} be locally numerous, although its true status has not been fully investigated. The white-eyed river martin was discovered as recently as 1969 <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> known from specimens and anecdotal evidence – no modern ornithologists have seen the species in the wild, and its breeding grounds are unknown. It may be extinct, although a possible sighting was reported in 2004.|$|E

5|$|The {{great auk}} was never {{observed}} and described by modern scientists during its existence, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> {{known from the}} accounts of laymen, such as sailors, so its behaviour is not well known and difficult to reconstruct. Much may be inferred from its close, living relative, the razorbill, {{as well as from}} remaining soft tissue.|$|E
5|$|The harm {{inflicted by}} cookiecutter sharks on fishing nets and {{economically}} important species {{may have a}} minor negative effect on commercial fisheries. The shark itself {{is too small to}} be of value, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> infrequently taken, as bycatch, on pelagic longlines and in midwater trawls and plankton nets. The lack of significant population threats, coupled with a worldwide distribution, has led the IUCN to assess the cookiecutter shark as of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The katipo is {{restricted}} to a highly specialised habitat <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> found near the seashore living among sand dunes. They generally reside on the landward side of dunes closest to the coast where they are most sheltered from storms and sand movement. They can sometimes be associated with dunes several kilometres from the sea when these dunes extend inland for long distances.|$|E

It is accessible by boat, and the grounds are open, though the tower is closed to the public.|$|E
5|$|The {{power station}} {{is the leading}} coal {{customer}} in Northumberland, burning 1,200,000 tonnes of coal a year, with a weekly coal consumption between 25,000 and 27,000 tonnes. The station has relatively limited coal storage facilities, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> able to hold {{three to four weeks}} worth of its fuel.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Gravity Bone, Thirty Flights of Loving employs {{non-linear}} storytelling, {{forcing the}} player {{to piece together}} the narrative. During gameplay, objectives and guidance are provided through the player's interactions with objects. The player has little control over the game mechanics <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> able to move freely and pick up objects as needed to progress. Several optional actions, such as drinking alcohol, are available at several stages of the game.|$|E
