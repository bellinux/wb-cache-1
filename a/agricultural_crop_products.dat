The reproducibility and accuracy of the bioassay is crucial {{to be able to}} correctly distinguish between active and inactive compounds.

The activity of these compounds on the test organisms, the weeds, insects, or fungi, is characterized by a dose-response curve measured from the bioassay. These curves are used to monitor the quality of the bioassays. If undesirable conditions in the bioassay arise, such as equipment failure or problems with the test organisms, then a bioassay monitoring procedure is needed to quickly detect such issues. In this paper we illustrate a proposed nonlinear profile monitoring method to monitor the variability of multiple assays, the adequacy of the dose-response model chosen, and the estimated dose-response curves for aberrant cases in the presence of heteroscedasticity. We illustrate these methods with in vivo bioassay data collected over one year from DuPont Crop Protection...|$|R

30|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a revival of the use of dyes and colours of natural origin for {{coloring}} food, pharmaceutical, cosmetic and textile products. This increasing demand for the material of natural origin is because of the toxic nature of many of the synthetic dyes. Amongst the natural dyes which are becoming widely recognized throughout the world, indigo is the one which is oldest known and commercialized natural dye. Indigo is a derivative of colourless glucoside of the enol form of indoxyl e.g. indican (Laitonjam and Wangkheirakpam 2011). Indigo is a dye with a long history and because of the contemporary popularity of indigo dyed denim, it remains an important industrial product (Garcia-Macias and John 2004). Throughout history, indigo was derived from various plants for example Dyer’s Woad (Isatis tinctoria L.) in Europe (Parmar et al. 1996). Also it is obtained from plant materials such as Baphicacanthus cusia Brem., Indigofera suffruticosa Mill, Polygonum tinctorium Palette, Isatis indigotica Fort, Lonchocarpus cyanescence (Laitonjam and Wangkheirakpam 2011). Until the commercialization of the synthetic product in the late 19 th century, indigo was produced entirely from plants (Garcia-Macias and John 2004). Today, the indigo used in commercial dyeing of denim yarn is no longer of natural origin. After more than 12  years of research, a method of laboratory synthesis of indigo was discovered by Adolf Von Baeyer in 1880. The first commercial form of indigo based on Von–Baeyers’s discovery appeared in the market in 1897 and {{after the turn of the}} century, synthetic indigo gradually replaced the natural indigo dye world-wide (Parmar et al. 1996). With increasing concern for sustainability and a demand from consumers for naturally sourced products, there is a revival of interest in natural indigo as an <b>agricultural</b> <b>crop</b> <b>product</b> (Garcia-Macias and John 2004). The current consumption of the dye is enormous due to the popularity of blue jeans, which are dyed with indigo (Vuorema 2008). In this study, an attempt has been made to extract natural indigo dye first time from Couroupita guianensis fruit by fermentation technique and to use the obtained dye for colouration of textiles.|$|R
40|$|Today&# 039;s {{society is}} based on the use of fossil {{resources}} for transportation fuels. The result of unlimited consumption of fossil fuels is a severe depletion of the natural reserves and damage to the environment. Depleting fossil reserves and increasing demand for energy together with environmental concerns have motivated researchers towards the development of alternative fuels which are eco-friendly, renewable and economical. Bioethanol is one such dominant global renewable transport biofuel which can readily substitute fossil fuels. Conventionally, bioethanol has been produced from sucrose and starch rich feedstocks (edible <b>agricultural</b> <b>crops</b> and <b>products)</b> known as 1 st generation bioethanol; however this substrate conflicts with food and feed production. As an alternative to 1 st generation bioethanol, currently there is much focus on advancing a cellulosic bioethanol concept that utilizes lignocellulosic residues from <b>agricultural</b> <b>crops</b> and residues (such as bagasse, straw, stover, stems, leaves and deoiled seed residues). Efficient conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into bioethanol remains an area of active research in terms of pretreatment of the biomass to fractionate its constituents (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin), breakdown of cellulose and hemicellulose into hexose and pentose sugars and co-fermentation of the sugars to ethanol. The present review discusses research progress in bioethanol production from sucrose, starch and cellulosic feedstocks. Development of efficient technology to convert lignocellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars and optimization of enzymatic hydrolysis using on-site/ in-house enzyme preparation are the key areas of development in lignocellulosic bioethanol production. Moreover, finding efficient fermenting microorganisms which can utilize pentose and hexose sugars in their metabolism to produce ethanol together with minimum foam and glycerol formation is also an important parameter in fermentation.

40|$|The use of more nutrient-efficient crops is {{important}} for maintaining yields while enhancing environmental sustainability. Various approaches are being applied to evaluate aspects of plant nutrient use efficiency, among them ecological concepts based on accumulation and losses of biomass and nutrients, agronomic concepts with a major focus on <b>agricultural</b> <b>crops</b> and harvested <b>products,</b> and physiological approaches assessing single physiological processes important for nutrient use. Unfortunately, the various approaches are often not compatible. Here we propose, with the example of nitrogen (N) use efficiency (NUE) of cereals, to integrate the functionally important components of NUE in a common conceptual framework. We link productivity to N in crops and seeds and consider the whole life-cycle of the crop (including seeds). Three major components of NUE are separated: The N uptake efficiency, grain-specific N efficiency and grain N concentration. The three components combine to a measure of overall NUE {{in terms of the}} N yield in harvested grain per unit of N in seed grain or soil N. The concept can be applied for both annual and perennial plants, which is demonstrated with the examples of winter wheat and a perennial energy crop (Salix) grown in Central Sweden...|$|R

Interestingly, more than 70 % of MSW is landfilled or burned, however landfill space is becoming increasingly scarce. On a smaller scale, important cellulosic products such as cellulose acetate also present waste problems; an estimated 43 thousand tons of cellulose ester waste are generated annually in the United States.

50|$|The {{generation}} of alternative energy {{on the scale}} needed to replace fossil energy, {{in an effort to}} reverse global climate change, is likely to have significant negative environmental impacts. For example, biomass energy generation would have to increase 7-fold to supply current primary energy demand, and up to 40-fold by 2100 given economic and energy growth projections. Humans already appropriate 30 to 40% of all photosynthetically fixed carbon worldwide, indicating that expansion of additional biomass harvesting is likely to stress ecosystems, in some cases precipitating collapse and extinction of animal species that have been deprived of vital food sources. The total amount of energy capture by vegetation in the United States each year is around 58 quads (61.5 EJ), about half of which is already harvested as <b>agricultural</b> <b>crops</b> and forest <b>products.</b> The remaining biomass is needed to maintain ecosystem functions and diversity. Since annual energy use in the United States is ca. 100 quads, biomass energy could supply only a very small fraction. To supply the current worldwide energy demand solely with biomass would require more than 10% of the Earth’s land surface, which is comparable to the area use for all of world agriculture (i.e., ca. 1500 million hectares), indicating that further expansion of biomass energy generation will be difficult without precipitating an ethical conflict, given current world hunger statistics, over growing plants for biofuel versus food.|$|R

30|$|Insurance {{companies}} will provide cover for anything {{if they can}} make a profit from it. However, unlike residential real estate, timber stands grow in volume and vary in value. Also, their rotation length is much longer than that of <b>agricultural</b> <b>crops.</b> Consequently, the valuation of standing timber must take tree growth rates and market conditions into consideration, which might be more complicated than valuing residential real estates or <b>agricultural</b> <b>crops.</b> Further, forests vary in age and species composition and occupy larger areas than buildings and <b>agricultural</b> <b>crops.</b> This makes it harder to value them and to assess the risks associated with various natural disasters. Finally, insurance companies need to have models derived from disaggregated and reliable data that allow them to estimate the probability of occurrence of various disasters and these are lacking of forestry. All these factors mean that the transaction costs of providing insurance cover for standing timber are higher than those for buildings or <b>agricultural</b> <b>crops.</b> All else being equal, the insurance premiums for standing timber would be consequently higher than those set for real estate or <b>agricultural</b> <b>crops.</b> Also, as timber takes many years to grow, the structural or sector-specific risk in forests could be higher than for <b>agricultural</b> <b>crops,</b> although the amount of accumulative risk in a rotation may be comparable.|$|R
