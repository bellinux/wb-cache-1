5|$|The team's {{previous}} experience was with turn-based combat games, and it struggled {{to develop a}} real-time combat system affected by customizable attributes and abilities that provided feedback to the player on how those statistics were affecting the battle. It initially found that by adhering too closely to the White Wolf source material rules for guns, where {{the effectiveness of a}} shot is determined in a contest between the player's skill and the opponent's defense, the firearms seemed broken; the player would not hit where they aimed. Troika found it difficult to mesh the available factors in a real-time setting. Melee combat had to deal with a variety of melee weapons and animations and <b>adjust</b> <b>for</b> melee-on-melee and melee-on-ranged combat.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to {{the flat}} {{appearance}} of the loudspeaker, all three panels are slightly curved along the vertical axis to improve quality. The panels themselves are flat, but obtain their curvature by being slightly bent to a curved backing. With the bipolar nature of the speaker emitting sound from both front and back surfaces as it does, {{the application of a}} felt sheet {{to the rear of the}} panels damps and absorbs high frequencies radiating from the back. A crossover network, set at 500Hz, remains necessary to <b>adjust</b> <b>for</b> back-to-front interference causing loss in output at low frequencies. In addition, the speaker should stand in free space to achieve optimum sound. The instructions book contains advice against placement of the speaker in corners or positions close to or parallel with walls, and further explains that a corner placement will adversely affect bass response and be detrimental to the midrange because of standing waves generated.|$|E
50|$|In 1983 {{the tuition}} was $300 ($ {{according}} to inflation) per month, and bus transportation was included.

5|$|Most {{observed}} white dwarfs {{have relatively}} high surface temperatures, between 8,000K and 40,000K. A white dwarf, though, spends {{more of its}} lifetime at cooler temperatures than at hotter temperatures, so we should expect {{that there are more}} cool white dwarfs than hot white dwarfs. Once we <b>adjust</b> <b>for</b> the selection effect that hotter, more luminous white dwarfs are easier to observe, we do find that decreasing the temperature range examined results in finding more white dwarfs. This trend stops when we reach extremely cool white dwarfs; few white dwarfs are observed with surface temperatures below 4,000K, and one of the coolest so far observed, WD 0346+246, has a surface temperature of approximately 3,900K. The {{reason for this is that}} the Universe's age is finite; there has not been enough time for white dwarfs to cool below this temperature. The white dwarf luminosity function can therefore be used to find the time when stars started to form in a region; an estimate for the age of our Galactic disk found in this way is 8 billion years. A white dwarf will eventually, in many trillions of years, cool and become a non-radiating black dwarf in approximate thermal equilibrium with its surroundings and with the cosmic background radiation. No black dwarfs are thought to exist yet.|$|E

25|$|The Ventomobile was a {{wind-powered}} lightweight three-wheeler {{designed by}} University of Stuttgart students. It had a carbon-fiber rotor support that was directed {{into the wind}} and variably pitched rotor blades that <b>adjust</b> <b>for</b> wind speed. Power transmission between the rotor and the driving wheels was via two bicycle gearboxes and a bicycle chain. It won the first prize at the Racing Aeolus held at Den Helder, Netherlands, in August 2008.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{the minimum}} wage promulgated by the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. According to the Economic Policy Institute, {{the minimum wage}} in the United States would have been $18.28 in 2013 if the minimum wage had kept pace with labor productivity. To <b>adjust</b> <b>for</b> {{increased}} rates of worker productivity in the United States, raising the minimum wage to $22 (or more) an hour has been presented.|$|E
25|$|To <b>adjust</b> <b>for</b> a large {{sampling}} fraction, the fpc {{factored into}} {{the calculation of}} the margin of error, which {{has the effect of}} narrowing the margin of error. It holds that the fpc approaches zero as the sample size (n) approaches the population size (N), which has the effect of eliminating the margin of error entirely. This makes intuitive sense because when N = n, the sample becomes a census and sampling error becomes moot.|$|E
50|$|The {{combined}} winnings {{purse for}} this race would be $9,275 ($ when <b>adjusted</b> <b>for</b> inflation); the winner would receive $1,500 of it ($ when <b>adjusted</b> <b>for</b> inflation) while the last-place finisher took home a meager $200 ($ when <b>adjusted</b> <b>for</b> inflation).|$|R

25|$|Each {{observation}} measures {{one or more}} properties (such as weight, location, color) of observable bodies distinguished {{as independent}} objects or individuals. In survey sampling, weights {{can be applied to}} the data to <b>adjust</b> <b>for</b> the sample design, particularly stratified sampling. Results from probability theory and statistical theory are employed to guide the practice. In business and medical research, sampling is widely used for gathering information about a population. Acceptance sampling is used to determine if a production lot of material meets the governing specifications.|$|E
25|$|The {{rotation}} of the beam inside the cavity alters the polarization state of the beam. To compensate for this, a single pass delay line is also needed, made of either a three or two mirrors in a 3d respective 2d retro-reflection configuration {{on top of a}} linear stage. To <b>adjust</b> <b>for</b> beam divergence a second car on the linear stage with two lenses can be used. The two lenses act as a telescope producing a flat phase front of a Gaussian beam on a virtual end mirror.|$|E
25|$|Statistical {{methods such as}} {{regression}} analysis are common. Practitioners use such methods to estimate the size, economic significance, and statistical significance ("signal strength") of the hypothesized relation(s) and to <b>adjust</b> <b>for</b> noise from other variables. By such means, a hypothesis may gain acceptance, although in a probabilistic, rather than certain, sense. Acceptance is dependent upon the falsifiable hypothesis surviving tests. Use of commonly accepted methods need not produce a final conclusion or even a consensus on a particular question, given different tests, data sets, and prior beliefs.|$|E

25|$|More generally, data should {{usually be}} {{weighted}} if the sample design {{does not give}} each individual an equal chance of being selected. For instance, when households have equal selection probabilities but one person is interviewed from within each household, this gives people from large households a smaller chance of being interviewed. This can be accounted for using survey weights. Similarly, households {{with more than one}} telephone line have a greater chance of being selected in a random digit dialing sample, and weights can <b>adjust</b> <b>for</b> this.|$|E
25|$|Statistical methods {{commonly}} used {{in other areas of}} psychology are also used in OHP-related research. Statistical methods used include structural equation modeling and hierarchical linear modeling (HLM; also known as multilevel modeling). HLM can better <b>adjust</b> <b>for</b> similarities between employees and is especially well suited to evaluating the lagged impact of work stressors on health outcomes; in this research context HLM can help minimize censoring and is well-suited to experience sampling studies. Meta-analyses have been used to aggregate data (modern approaches to meta-analyses rely on HLM), and draw conclusions across multiple studies.|$|E
25|$|Ophthalmoplegia or the {{inability}} or difficulty {{to move the}} eye is usually symmetrical. As such, double vision is sometimes a complaint of these patients. The progressive ophthalmoplegia is often unnoticed till decreased ocular motility limits peripheral vision. Often someone else will point out the ocular disturbance to the patient. Patients will move their heads to <b>adjust</b> <b>for</b> the loss of peripheral vision caused by inability to abduct or adduct the eye. All directions of gaze are affected; however, downward gaze appears to be best spared. This {{is in contrast to}} progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), which typically affects vertical gaze and spares horizontal gaze.|$|E

25|$|CPEO is a slowly {{progressing}} disease. It {{may begin}} {{at any age}} and progresses {{over a period of}} 5–15 years. The first presenting symptom of ptosis is often unnoticed by the patient until the lids droop to the point of producing a visual field defect. Often, patients will tilt the head backwards to <b>adjust</b> <b>for</b> the slowly progressing ptosis of the lids. In addition, as the ptosis becomes complete, the patients will use the frontalis (forehead) muscle to help elevate the lids. The ptosis is typically bilateral, but may be unilateral for a period of months to years before the fellow lid becomes involved.|$|E
25|$|In 1935, Charles Townsend {{from the}} New York Zoological Society (now the Wildlife Conservation Society) {{reviewed}} an overlapping set 2,000 whaling logbooks and mapped {{the locations of}} whale taken by species. His Chart C shows catch locations around the world, including the location by month {{of most of the}} 2,118 right whales taken in the North Pacific between 1839 and 1909, using data copied from 249 logbooks. His charts do not <b>adjust</b> <b>for</b> the nonrandom distribution of whalers. Chart C shows three main concentrations of right whales—one in the Gulf of Alaska; one along Kamchatka and the Sea of Okhotsk; and another in the Sea of Japan.|$|E
25|$|The Thai Chulasakarat {{calendar}} uses {{a slightly}} different method to place the intercalary day. Instead {{of it in a}} leap year as in the Burmese system, the Thai system places it in a separate year. Thus, the Thai small leap year has 355 days while the Thai great leap year has 384 days. Both systems arrive at the same number of days in a 19-year cycle however. Furthermore, in contrast to Indian calendars, the Burmese calendar follows a Metonic cycle in which intercalary months are inserted on a set schedule. However, because the Burmese calendar has to <b>adjust</b> <b>for</b> the use of Indian-calendar-derived sidereal years with the Metonic cycle's tropical years, maintaining a set Metonic cycle has been a challenge.|$|E
