40|$|Abstract: The Rif Cordillera {{is a part}} of the <b>Alpine</b> orogenic <b>arc</b> in the Western Mediterranean, {{which was}} {{developed}} bythe interaction of the westward motion of the Alboran Domain between the converging Eurasian and African plates. The Prerif Ridges, located along the southwestern front of the Rif, are south-vergent folds that are in places associated with faults affecting Jurassic to Quaternary sedimentary rocks and slope breccias that evidence the deformations that were active over the Neogene-Quaternary period. The different southward o southwestward displace-ment of each Prerif Ridge is related to the development of frontal and lateral ramps, which may or may not reach the surface. Oblique shortening may be explained by southwestward escape of large tectonic wedges, bounded by large strike-slip faults: he North-Middle Atlas fault which extends northward into the Alboran Sea, the Fez-Tissa-Ta/neste fault, the Bou Draa-Sidi Fili fault, the Jebha fault and the Fables fault. The relative displacement of these tectonic wedges toward the SW may explain the NNE-SSW to ENE-WSW compression observed in the Rif front and in the northern part of its Meseta-Atlas foreland.

Reported recovery percentages after one flood are often over 80 %, demonstrating {{the effectiveness of this}} technique for small mountainous rivers. We used this technique to get detailed spatial information on particle movements on a gravel bar in an <b>alpine</b> river (<b>Arc</b> en Maurienne, France). Six patches have been placed on the gravel bar (three on the bar head in August 2008 and three along the secondary channel in June 2009). During this period, the main events correspond to flushing events of the upstream dams and reservoirs by dam managers, as well as short high flow periods in May 2009 due to snow melt. Only these events {{have an impact on the}} gravel bar since it is dry for lower flows. First results with PIT-tag technique indicate a very strong erosion of the head of the bar, especially on the side of the main channel. Two sample plots have been totally eroded and marked particles have moved to the main channel after the first and the second flushing events, respectively. The secondary channel shows lower dynamics. Recovery percentages were approximately 80 % after each event until marked gravels reached the main channel through the first connecting cross-channel. Travel distances were independent of the particle diameter (40 to 300 mm). The downstream part of the secondary channel and the tail of the gravel bar were not affected by the last flushing event in June 2009. Most of the surface of the downstream part of the gravel bar was dry during this event as a consequence of the May 2008 flood that significantly eroded the main channel. As a first conclusion, the PIT-tag method yields interesting results for the gravel bar dynamics but the investigation domain is limited in space (and time) for our study case. Indeed, we were not able to recover PIT-tag in the main channel and downstream...|$|R

40|$|The North-Ligurian rifted margin is {{singular}} {{in that it}} lies immediately next to the <b>Alpine</b> orogenic <b>arc.</b> It is furthermore seismically {{active and}} can experience destructive earthquakes such as in 1887 {{in the region of}} Imperia—an event that resulted in a tsunami and more than 600 casualties in spite of a coastal area that was much less densely populated than today. Out of such rare large events, the area undergoes a limited and diffuse seismic activity that can remain undetected and is generally poorly located. This results in a poor knowledge of active structures, especially at sea. Such knowledge is however required towards a quantification of the seismic hazard along the French Riviera and the Ligurian region. To this end, the GROSMarin project was undertaken with a dual objective: (1) to characterize the North-Ligurian margin from a structural standpoint—mode and degree of crustal stretching prior to oceanic accretion, segmentation along strike, subsequent evolution in an orogenic context— and (2) to identify zones of active crustal deformation at sea that are likely to generate earthquakes. The programme is a collaborative work between GeoAzur and Dip. Te. Ris (University of Genova), with some support from INGV, IFM-GEOMAR and IFREMER. It took place from April to October 2008 and consisted in the deployment of 21 ocean-bottom seismometers (OBS) on a grid spanning 50 km along strike and 25 km across, located between Nice, France, and Imperia, Italy, and ranging from mid-slope to the deep basin. This array was extended on land by the permanent stations of the French and Italian regional networks, temporarily densified by 13 portable stations. These instruments recorded the shots of a marine seismic source towed from R/V l’Atalante and were left for more than 5 months for passive surveying. The active part of the programme aims at characterizing the main structures of the margin through crustal 3 D tomography; the objective of the passive part is to decrease the detection threshold of marine microseismicity and to reach a precise location of events in order to map active faults. Some of the sea and land instruments were fitted with broadband sensors to allow for teleseismic imaging of deep lithospheric discontinuities. We present the preliminary results of this experiment—in particular a first 3 D tomographic model obtained from 31. 500 travel times derived from our recording of active seismic shots by the OBS’s. Passive data analysis is being under progress and first relocations have been obtained.

All biogeographical regions where N. pumila naturally occurs in the neighbourhood of the <b>Alpine</b> <b>arc</b> were sampled and studied using nuclear microsatellite markers. Furthermore, we used forward-in-time simulations and Approximate Bayesian Computation to check whether an introgression scenario fits with the observed admixture patterns and estimated the demographic parameters associated with this process. Our study confirms ongoing hybridization between N. pumila and N. lutea and validates it by the use of population models. More than 40 % of investigated N. pumila individuals were admixed and hybrids were found in over 60 % of studied populations. The introgression is bidirectional and is most likely a result of very recent gene flow. Our work provides strong evidence for rapid extinction risk and demographic swamping between specialized climatic relicts and closely related generalists. The remaining pure populations of N. pumila are rare in the <b>Alpine</b> <b>arc</b> and deserve high conservation priority...|$|E

40|$|Habitat {{selection}} {{is a fundamental}} aspect in ecology. It affects survival and reproduction of individuals and hence influences population dynamics. Today, most landscapes are modified by anthropogenic activities, resulting in habitat fragmentation, destruction and homogenisation. In such altered landscapes, either species can adapt to the new environmental conditions or they perish. To implement efficient conservation measures, {{it is crucial to}} understand how the animals move within a landscape and what habitat requirements they have. The Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) is a semi-aquatic mammal, whose populations have declined strongly during the 20 th century. In recent decades, otter populations started to recover in some areas, e. g. at the periphery of the <b>Alpine</b> <b>Arc.</b> Here the riverine landscape has been altered massively due to hydropower, flood prevention and an increase of road networks and traffic following a strong increase of the human population in the last 30 years. Today, the otter is still absent in large parts of the <b>Alpine</b> <b>Arc.</b> But there are a growing population in the Central Alps in Austria and small and isolated occurrences in the French Alps. Understanding habitat requirements of otters in this landscape and predicting habitat suitability to the core of the Alps will contribute to facilitate the recovery and the reconnection of the populations within the <b>Alpine</b> <b>Arc.</b> To investigate these aspects, I radiotracked wild otters in the Eastern Central Alps, in Styria (Austria). Using the data of nine otters tracked from seven to 30 months, I analysed habitat selection at multiple spatial scales. Specific behaviours require different habitats. I thus discriminated between the main daily behaviours of foraging and resting. I analysed foraging habitat selection at three different spatial levels: population, individual and within home range (Chapter 2). At the finest scale, I combined habitat selection with movement by applying a step-selection function to the linear system of the watercourses in a novel way. I show that otters adapt well to a landscape interrupted by a multitude of hydropower stations. Indeed, modifications to the riverine landscape by damming provide even new and profitable foraging grounds for the otters. This behaviour may be driven by the traditional fish stocking regime. I conclude that otters are flexible in their selection for foraging habitat, supporting the notion of a successful recovery of the species into the <b>Alpine</b> <b>Arc.</b> Resting {{is one of the most}} vulnerable states of an animal. Resting sites provide protection from harsh weather conditions but also from predators. Humans often evoke strong antipredator behaviour, even in apex carnivores. Little is known about general resting site selection of otters and less about the effect of humans on this selection. As a semi-aquatic mammal, otters are linked to waterbodies and may seek protection in its immediate surrounding. However, modifications to the watercourses and an intensification of the 3 agriculture have reduced the riparian vegetation. Additionally, leisure activities increase along watercourses. In the third Chapter, I show that resting sites are indeed almost exclusively situated in the riparian vegetation. With data from 284 resting sites, I illustrate that otters are content with small riparian vegetation belts as long as daily human disturbance is low, but that a larger riparian vegetation belt is required as a protective buffer when there are more frequent human activities. I argue that humans are perceived as threats by carnivores and that the intensity of human presence influences resting site selection. I conclude that strips of vegetation cover is a crucial necessity for resting carnivores in anthropogenic altered landscapes and stress the importance of riparian vegetation, a threatened landscape in Europe. Habitat suitability maps can predict occurrence of a species and provide information on the permeability of the landscape matrix. Scale is an important factor because environmental factors can be scale-sensitive and because conservation actions often are targeted at different levels e. g. local or national. To predict future otter occurrence at the core of the <b>Alpine</b> <b>Arc</b> and its potential to reconnect the French and Austrian population, I developed two habitat suitability models (HSM), using two different data set at a different scale (Chapter 4). The large scale HSM was built on large scale snowtracking surveys in Styria, Austria at a resolution of 10 km 2. For the fine scale HSM I used radiotracking data on resting behaviour, which has higher habitat requirements than foraging behaviour. I demonstrate with both HSMs that there are suitable habitats for otters in the core of the Alps. I show that a recolonization of Switzerland by otters seems possible and a reconnection of the populations within the <b>Alpine</b> <b>Arc</b> is realistic. My results also highlight the importance of scale, which is even more pronounced when environmental data are lacking. In summary, I evaluated key factors for habitat selection of different behaviours, based on radiotracking data of otters in the Eastern Central Alps. I then used this data to develop habitat suitability models at two spatial scales to reveal the potential of re-expansion of the species to the core of the Alps. In the last chapter (Chapter 5), I summarize my results based on five years of work and discuss my findings, conclusions and their applications...|$|E

The gravity {{observations of}} GOCE produce an unparalleled global field that allows to detect geological features and classify types of continental crust. GOCE is superior to existing global fields based on terrestrial data, as is EGM 2008, as is seen from the regional variability of the root mean square {{difference between the two}} fields. The difference is governed by which is biased by varying quality of the terrestrial observations. The gravity anomaly and Bouguer fields of GOCE and residual fields based on a regression between topography and gravity are studied. The root mean square amplitude variation of the residual Bouguer field is reduced by 56 %, demonstrating that the regression efficiently eliminates the isostatic field. As expected, for the gravity anomaly the reduction is less and amounts to 20 %. The residual fields highlight geological units, as deep sedimentary basins (Po-basin sediments, Alpine foreland basin), the Ivrea body and the Periadriatic intrusions, and the gravity high centered on the Tuscan Arcipelagus connecting Western Corsica and the Tuscan geothermal fields.

40|$|Curved {{mountain}} belts {{have always}} fascinated geologists and geophysicists {{because of their}} peculiar structural setting and geodynamic mechanisms of formation. 	The need of studying orogenic bends arises from the numerous questions to which geologists and geophysicists have tried to answer to {{during the last two}} decades, such as: what are the mechanisms governing orogenic bends formation? Why do they form? Do they develop in particular geological conditions? And if so, what are the most favorable conditions? What are their relationships with the deformational history of the belt? Why is the shape of arcuate orogens {{in many parts of the}} Earth so different? What are the factors controlling the shape of orogenic bends? Paleomagnetism demonstrated to be one of the most effective techniques in order to document the deformation of a curved belt through the determination of vertical axis rotations. In fact, the pattern of rotations within a curved belt can reveal the occurrence of a bending, and its timing. Nevertheless, paleomagnetic data alone are not sufficient to constrain the tectonic evolution of a curved belt. Usually, structural analysis integrates paleomagnetic data, in defining the kinematics of a belt through kinematic indicators on brittle fault planes (i. e., slickensides, mineral fibers growth, SC-structures). My research program has been focused on the study of curved mountain belts through paleomagnetism, in order to define their kinematics, timing, and mechanisms of formation. Structural analysis, performed only in some regions, supported and integrated paleomagnetic data. In particular, three arcuate orogenic systems have been investigated: the Western <b>Alpine</b> <b>Arc</b> (NW Italy), the Bolivian Orocline (Central Andes, NW Argentina), and the Patagonian Orocline (Tierra del Fuego, southern Argentina). The bending of the Western <b>Alpine</b> <b>Arc</b> has been investigated so far using different approaches, though few based on reliable paleomagnetic data. Results from our paleomagnetic study carried out in the Tertiary Piedmont Basin, located on top of Alpine nappes, indicate that the Western <b>Alpine</b> <b>Arc</b> is a primary bend that has been subsequently tightened by further 50 ° during Aquitanian-Serravallian times (23 - 12 Ma). This mid-Miocene oroclinal bending, superimposing onto a pre-existing Eocene nonrotational arc, is the result of a composite geodynamic mechanism, where slab rollback, mantle flows, and rotating thrust emplacement are intimately linked. Relying on our paleomagnetic and structural evidence, the Bolivian Orocline can be considered as a progressive bend, whose formation has been driven by the along-strike gradient of crustal shortening. The documented clockwise rotations up to 45 ° are compatible with a secondary-bending type mechanism occurring after Eocene-Oligocene times (30 - 40 Ma), and their nature is probably related to the widespread shearing taking place between zones of differential shortening. Since 15 Ma ago, the activity of N-S left-lateral strike-slip faults in the Eastern Cordillera at the border with the Altiplano-Puna plateau induced up to 40 ° counterclockwise rotations along the fault zone, locally annulling the regional clockwise rotation. We proposed that mid-Miocene strike-slip activity developed in response of a compressive stress (related to body forces) at the plateau margins, caused by the progressive lateral (southward) growth of the Altiplano-Puna plateau, laterally spreading from the overthickened crustal region of the salient apex. The growth of plateaux by lateral spreading seems to be a mechanism common to other major plateaux in the Earth (i. e., Tibetan plateau). Results from the Patagonian Orocline represent the first reliable constraint to the timing of bending in the southern tip of South America. They indicate that the Patagonian Orocline did not undergo any significant rotation since early Eocene times (50 Ma), implying that it may be considered either a primary bend, or an orocline formed during the late Cretaceous-early Eocene deformation phase. This result has important implications on the opening of the Drake Passage at 32 Ma, since it is definitely not related to the formation of the Patagonian orocline, but the sole consequence of the Scotia plate spreading. Finally, relying on the results and implications from the study of the Western <b>Alpine</b> <b>Arc,</b> the Bolivian Orocline, and the Patagonian Orocline, general conclusions on curved mountain belt formation have been inferred. ...|$|E

This paper presents a multilingual platform that combines spatial and multi-criteria decision-support tools to facilitate stakeholder collaboration {{in the analysis of}} water management adaptation options. The platform has an interactive map interface that allows participants to select a location of their interest within the <b>Alpine</b> <b>Arc.</b> By utilising the decision-support tool, stakeholders can identify suitable adaptation solutions for different geographical units, according to their experience and preference. The platform was used to involve experts across Alpine borders, domains and decision-making levels, as well as a group of university students. The experts favoured the planning instruments for saving water, while the students inclined towards the measures that would improve water conservation. The initial results confirmed the suitability of the platform for future involvement of decision-makers in spatio-temporal analyses of adaptation pathways in the Alps...|$|E
