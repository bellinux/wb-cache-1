5|$|In 1996, the well-connected {{owners of}} Cross Sound Ferry {{proposed}} a footbridge from the Water Street parking garage to the ferry slips so that ferry passengers {{would not have}} to cross Water Street and the tracks at grade. Amtrak saw the project as an opportunity to build a new elevated station nearby and contributed $1 million to the design of the bridge. However, Amtrak reversed course in 1999 and decided to keep using Union Station; in 2001, the railroad declined to fund the footbridge. Also in 2001, Amtrak built a pair of high-level platforms to serve the new Acela Express high-speed service, thus adapting the 19th-century station for 21st-century usage. Catenary wires were installed over the tracks as part of the introduction of the Acela. Later that year or early in 2002, the 1899-built freight house {{on the east side of}} the tracks was torn down as part of redevelopment sponsored by the New London Development Corporation.
