5|$|The {{principal}} {{employment of}} the working population of Eccles and vicinity at that time, was the manufacture of Cotton Goods on the home or domestic plan. These were not then, <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> present recollection, more than two Spinning Manufactories in Manchester, Arkwright's with its loft chimney, and Douglas's extensive Works, on the River Irwell, near the Broken bank... At the period of my first residence in Eccles Parish, I believe the above Mills chiefly supplied the Weavers of Eccles and other parishes with twist for warps, which were purchased by the Master Manufacturers.|$|E

He wrote: In {{this world}} all we leave behind us {{that is worth}} anything {{is that we can}} be well regarded and spoken of after we are gone, and that we can say that we left the world just a little better than we found it. If we can't accomplish these two things then life, <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> view, has been a failure. Many people erroneously speak of a man when he is gone as having left so much money. That, <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> view, amounts to very little.|$|E

500|$|Akbar's son, Emperor Jahangir, also {{continued}} {{the practice of}} Jharokha Darshan. In Agra Fort, the jharokha window {{is part of the}} structure which represents the Shah Burj, the Royal Tower. The tower is in the shape of an octagon and has a white marble pavilion. During Jahangir's time and even more frequently under Shah Jahan's rule this jharokha was used for giving darshan. During Jahangir's Jharokha Darshan, hanging a string to tie petitions, was also practiced. This was also a Persian system under naushrwan. Jahangir elaborated on this system by adopting a golden chain to tie the petitions but Aurangzeb stopped it. Nur Jahan, Jahangir's wife, was also known to have sat for the Jharokha Darshan and conducted administrative duty with the common people and hearing their pleas. Jahangir was fully dedicated to the practice and {{made it a point to}} conduct the Jharokha Darshan even if he was sick; he had said [...] "even in the time of weakness I have gone every day to the jharokha, though in great pain and sorrow, <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> fixed custom." ...|$|E
500|$|Belle {{was also}} the main {{character}} in various comic books based on the film, including one set during Belle's stay at the castle published by Marvel Comics, and a prequel set several years before the film distributed by Disney Comics. In the former, the storylines generally have the servants trying to coax Belle into doing something with the Beast, only for it to backfire and nearly ruin their friendship before they make up. In the latter serial, Belle ends up {{locked up in a}} cellar by village children after reluctantly playing pirates with them, and later nearly goes down the path leading to Beast's castle. The latter serial also implies that she holds misandric views and refuses to associate herself with the village children, especially the males, due to their not being as well-versed in literature as she."Maurice: You should be playing outside with the other children! // Belle: I'm having a much better time in King Arthur's Court! Sometimes I can see myself living in a castle surrounded by servants. I might even entertain the thought of a handsome prince.....As long as he was gentle and kind... Not like those childish roughnecks in the square! Not one of them could even spell gallant! // Maurice: A day will come when those boys will look like knights in shining armor to you. // Belle: Never! I won't {{have anything to do with}} them. Men are such... such... // Maurice: Hear that, Pierre? <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> daughter there isn't an ounce of difference between us! // Pierre: Oink! // Belle: Well, I suppose there are some exceptions." ...|$|E

I invited Frank to visit The Maples and, before he came, I talked much...but not too much...of him to Betty, mingling judicious praise and still more judicious blame together.

500|$|In June 2017, the WBO {{confirmed}} {{that they would}} sanction a regional unification fight between Singh and WBO Oriental super middleweight champion Zulpikar Maimaitiali of China. New India Express announced the fight, billed as [...] "Battleground Asia" [...] would take place on 5 August 2017 at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Indoor Stadium in Mumbai. On 26 July, IOS Boxing Promotions and Frank Warren's Queensberry Promotions announced that they had reached a deal to work together once again. Singh retained his Asia Pacific title and won the Oriential title after the fight went to the scorecards after 10 rounds. The judges scored the fight 96-93, 95-94, 95-94 in favour of Singh. Although the fight was scored close, Singh {{seemed to have the}} fight under control using his height and reach. In round six, Maimaitiali was docked a point for repeated low blows after being warned in previous rounds. Had he not been docked a point, the fight would have ended as a majority draw. After the bout, Singh praised his opponent, [...] "I didn't expect him to fight so well and last the distance. I thought this would last for a maximum of 5-6 rounds. Hence I didn't fight <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> strategies. I just want to tell China, please don't come to our border. This is for peace." [...] He said about the bout, [...] "The blows disturbed me. He has been fantastic. His aggression was terrific." [...] He also offered the title back to Maimaitiali, as a message for peace. This was in relation to the recent border tension between India and China.|$|E
500|$|Southey {{intended}} Madoc {{to rival}} {{the works of}} Homer, and Coleridge believed that the poem {{would be better than}} the Aeneid. However, Madoc received mixed reviews from critics; while one critic believed it was comparable to John Milton's Paradise Lost, another felt that it was unreadable. In letter written by William Wordsworth on 3 June 1805, he claimed that he was [...] "highly pleased with it; it abounds in beautiful pictures and descriptions happily introduced, and there is an animation diffused through the whole story though it cannot perhaps be said that any of the characters interest you much, except perhaps young Llewllyn whose situation is highly interesting, and he appears to me the best conceived and sustained character in the piece [...] The Poem fails in the highest gifts of the poet's mind Imagination in the true sense of the word, and knowledge of human Nature and human heart. There is nothing that shows the hand of the great Master". He followed this with a letter on 29 July 1805 saying [...] "Southey's mind does not seem strong enough to draw the picture of a Hero. The character of Madoc is often very insipid and contemptible [...] In short, <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> notion, the character is throughout languidly conceived". Dorothy Wordsworth, William's sister, wrote on 11 June 1805 to claim that [...] "We have read Madoc with great delight [...] I had one painful feeling throughout, that I did not care as much about Madoc as the Author wished me to do, and that the characters in general are not sufficiently distinct to make them have a separate after-existence in my affection." ...|$|E

40|$|PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION The {{first edition}} of this work, which was {{published}} in August 1849, was only a slender pamphlet. I have, since that time, written various papers on the same subject, which have been read at the Medical Societies, and published in the medical journals. The present edition contains the substance of all these articles, together with much new matter, the greater part of which is derived from my own recent inquiries. I take this opportunity of expressing <b>my</b> thanks <b>to</b> the Registrar-General for the facilities afforded me in making these inquiries.

2500|$|Millennia ago, Hippocrates {{recognized}} {{the potential for}} injuries that arise from the well-intentioned actions of healers.

2500|$|The Hippocratic Oath makes {{explicit}} statements against {{deliberate harm}} {{not in the}} patient's best interests.

2500|$|Many such as June Singer {{have argued}} that Blake's {{thoughts}} on human nature greatly anticipate and parallel the thinking of the psychoanalyst Carl Jung.

[...] Similarly, although less popularly, Diana Hume George claimed that Blake {{can be seen as}} a precursor to the ideas of Sigmund Freud.|$|E
