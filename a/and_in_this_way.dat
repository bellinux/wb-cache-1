5|$|The Lombard {{migration}} {{started on}} Easter Monday, April 2, 568. The decision {{to combine the}} departure with a Christian celebration can be understood {{in the context of}} Alboin's recent conversion to Arian Christianity, as attested by the presence of Arian Gothic missionaries at his court. The conversion is likely to have been motivated mostly from political considerations, and intended to consolidate the migration's cohesion, distinguishing them from the Catholic Romans. It also connected Alboin and his people to the Gothic heritage, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>way</b> obtain the support of the Ostrogoths serving in the Byzantine army as foederati. It has been speculated that Alboin's migration could have been partly the result of a call from surviving Ostrogoths in Italy.|$|E
5|$|The {{symmetry}} {{on earth}} mirrors the symmetric perfection of heaven. The purpose {{of art at}} this time—in architecture, the visual arts, and music—was not to create something entirely new, but to reflect this divine perfection, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>way</b> to praise God. We find such a symmetric outline in many pieces by Johann Sebastian Bach,19 but only {{in a few cases}} is this outline as consequent as in the B Minor Mass. The parts Kyrie, Gloria and Credo are all designed with choral sections as the outer movements, framing an intimate center of theological significance.|$|E
5|$|The tax {{increase}} was implemented {{not only to}} improve accessibility and the environment, but also to help develop the infrastructure. The additional funds will contribute to finance {{the extension of the}} Stockholm metro. As the Stockholm congestion tax varies by time of the day, the highest increase took place at the two busiest rush hour periods, 7:30 to 8:29, and 16:00 to 17:29, from SEK 20 to SEK 30. The objective was to steer the traffic towards other times of the day and public transport, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>way</b> reduce congestion in the Inner City area. Also the maximum amount levied was raised to SEK 105 per day and vehicle.|$|E

25|$|Use {{of one of}} the subordinator suffixes {{constitutes}} the main subordination strategy. Since these suffixes occupy the same place as the tense suffixes, the resulting subordinate clauses are tenseless, in this respect resembling non-finite clauses in European languages. Nonetheless, Rama verb forms with subordinators take subject prefixes under the same basic conditions as tensed ones, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>way</b> resemble finite forms.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} claimed that this {{representation}} of Zipf's law is {{more suitable for}} statistical testing, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>way</b> it has been analyzed in more than 30,000 English texts. The goodness-of-fit tests yield that only about 15% of the texts are statistically compatible with this form of Zipf's law. Slight variations {{in the definition of}} Zipf's law can increase this percentage up to close to 50%.|$|E
25|$|This {{result in}} turn is proved by {{considering}} a dual diagram for D. There one defines a combinatorial notion of curvature (which, by the small cancellation assumptions, is negative at every interior vertex), and one then obtains a combinatorial version of the Gauss–Bonnet theorem. Greendlinger's lemma is proved {{as a consequence of}} this analysis <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>way</b> the proof evokes the ideas of the original proof of Dehn for the case of surface groups.|$|E
25|$|On April 24, 2010, about 120,000 people built a human chain (KETTENreAKTION!) {{between the}} nuclear plants at Krümmel <b>and</b> Brunsbüttel. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>way</b> they were demonstrating against the {{plans of the}} German {{government}} to {{extend the life of}} nuclear power reactors.|$|R

30|$|We should {{remark that}} stored {{water in the}} soil is much more {{essential}} to genera dominated by trees like Quercus, Platanus, Pinus, Morus, Juglans, Betula <b>and</b> Alnus. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> autumn <b>and</b> winter precipitation income better influences their growth and pollen production potentials than for herbaceous plants.|$|R
25|$|Because García Calderón {{refused to}} {{relinquish}} Peruvian {{control over the}} Tarapacá Region, he was arrested. Before García Calderón left Peru for Chile, he named Admiral Lizardo Montero as his successor. At the same time President Piérola stepped back and supported Avelino Cáceres for the Presidency. Cáceres refused to serve and supported Lizardo Montero instead. Montero moved to Arequipa <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>way</b> García Calderón's arrest unified the forces of Piérola and Cáceres.|$|E
25|$|Colby {{was born}} in Gloucester, England in 1846, the {{daughter}} of Thomas and Clara Willingham (Chilton) Bewick. The family settled near Windsor, Wisconsin when Colby was eight. Being {{part of a large}} family, she had few opportunities for attending the district school, but her father encouraged and assisted his children to study in the winter evenings, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>way</b> she prepared herself to teach in country schools. Colby's grandfather, Thomas Bewick, was a notable naturalist and engraver.|$|E
25|$|Decimal Day itself went smoothly. Criticisms {{included}} {{the small size}} of the new halfpenny coin and the fact that some traders had taken advantage of the transition to raise prices. Some used new pennies as sixpences in vending machines. After 15 February, shops continued to accept payment in old coins, but always issued change in new coins. The old coins were returned to the banks <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>way</b> the bulk of them were quickly taken out of circulation.|$|E

25|$|The {{military}} historian Siborne {{stated that}} it appeared to Napoleon that Blücher had taken up a position perpendicular to the Namur road, <b>and</b> had, <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> completely exposed his right flank; whence he inferred that Blücher placed great reliance upon the arrival of auxiliary forces from Wellington's army.|$|R
30|$|If {{innovation}} threatens {{companies with}} obsolescence and extinction, they cannot afford {{to leave it}} to chance. Rather than waiting for flashes of inspiration, they set up research-and-development (R&D) departments and commit an annual budget {{to the pursuit of}} new products <b>and</b> processes. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> invention becomes routine.|$|R
25|$|During World War II (or The Emergency) {{there are}} no records of Air Corps planes {{engaging}} any belligerent aircraft, although dozens of escaped barrage balloons were shot down. Requests for more aircraft from Britain resulted in 13 obsolete Hawker Hector biplane light bombers, supplied during 1941. 163 belligerent aircraft force-landed in Ireland during the war, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>way</b> the Air Corps acquired a Lockheed Hudson, a Fairey Battle, and three Hawker Hurricanes. The Hurricane gave the Air Corps a proven modern fighter, and – at peak – 20 flew in Irish colours.|$|E
25|$|A DOI name {{does not}} depend on the object's {{location}} <b>and,</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> is similar to a Uniform Resource Name (URN) or PURL but differs from an ordinary URL. URLs are often used as substitute identifiers for documents on the Internet (better characterised as Uniform Resource Identifiers) although the same document at two different locations has two URLs. By contrast, persistent identifiers such as DOI names identify objects as first class entities: two instances of the same object would have the same DOI name.|$|E
25|$|To {{track the}} {{progress}} of the AEC, the AEC Scorecard, a compliance tool was developed based on the EU Internal Market Scorecard, and was adopted by ASEAN. This regional economic scorecard is the only scorecard in effect and is expected to serve as an unbiased assessment tool to measure the extent of integration among its members, and the economic health of the region. It is expected to provide relevant information about regional priorities <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>way</b> foster productive, inclusive, and sustainable growth. Moreover, scores create incentives for improvement by highlighting what is working and what is not.|$|E
30|$|Relying {{upon these}} {{semantic}} models, an intelligent tool {{has been designed}} to be easily integrated in the emergency center avoiding any distractions for the operators or waste of resources <b>and</b> time. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>way,</b> the proposed solution becomes an effective support for making decisions or discovering new information.|$|R
