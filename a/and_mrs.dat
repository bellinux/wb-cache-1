40|$|It is {{well known}} that low levels of tissue oxygen (pO 2) protect tumour cells from {{ionising}} radiation and some chemotherapeutic agents. Thus, numerous studies have been aimed at developing methods to measure tissue oxygenation. An initial discussion of some of the traditional methods for measuring oxygenation is included, followed by a discussion of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<b>MRS)</b> <b>and</b> magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods for measuring tumour and normal tissue oxygenation. The latter methods are of interest because of the non-invasive nature of magnetic resonance (MR). Some of the MR methods described herein include: 31 P MRS, 1 H <b>MRS</b> <b>and</b> MRI, <b>and</b> 19 F <b>MRS</b> <b>and</b> MRI. Each method is detailed, including a brief assessment of its ability to measure tumour oxygenation and its potential for clinical application...|$|R

5|$|From December 1559 Amy Dudley {{lived at}} Cumnor Place, near Abingdon in Berkshire (now in Oxfordshire).

He lived there with his wife <b>and</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Odingsells <b>and</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Owen, relations of the house's owner. Lady Dudley's chamber was a large, sumptuous upper story apartment, the best of the house, with a separate entrance and staircase leading up to it. At the house's rear there were a terrace garden, a pond, and a deer park. Amy Dudley received the proceeds of the Robsart estate directly into her hands and largely paid for her own household, which comprised about 10 servants. She regularly ordered dresses and finery as accounts and a letter from her of as late as 24August 1560 show. She also received presents from her husband.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Emerging and {{established}} methods, such as optical imaging <b>and</b> MR spectroscopy (<b>MRS),</b> offer {{new opportunities for}} in situ biosensing. The limited tissue penetration of these modalities can be addressed by locally placing the sensor via minimally invasive transneedle or transcatheter access. This work introduces a generic system that mechanically scans an area of interest with a sensor, capable of generating 1 D scans while registering them to a guiding modality. Computer simulations illustrate the operation of this approach for a miniature RF coil as the mechanically scanned biosensor. Experimental studies demonstrated the approach on phantoms, using MRI as the guiding modality, and an MRcompatible manipulator, which carried a miniature RF coil, was used to scan <b>and</b> collect <b>MRS</b> <b>and</b> generated 1 D MRS scans coregistered to the guiding MRI.

40|$|International audienceFree radicals, or Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), have {{an effect}} on energy and glycolytic metabolism, {{mitochondrial}} function, lipid metabolism, necrosis and apoptosis, cell proliferation, and infiltration. These changes could be monitored longitudinally (every 4 months over 6 years) in humans with glial brain tumors (low and high grade) after therapy, using conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) <b>and</b> spectroscopy (<b>MRS)</b> <b>and</b> MR perfusion. Some examples of early clinical data from longitudinal follow-up monitoring in humans of energy and glycolytic metabolism, lipid metabolism, necrosis, proliferation, and infiltration measured by conventional MRI, <b>MRS</b> <b>and</b> perfusion, and positron emission tomography (PET) are shown in glial brain tumors after therapy. Despite the difficulty, the variability and unknown factors, these repeated measurements give us a better insight into the nature of the different processes, tumor progression and therapeutic response...|$|R
40|$|To {{analyze the}} {{characteristic}} performance of {{magnetic resonance spectroscopy}} (<b>MRS)</b> <b>and</b> susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) in cerebral alveolar echinococcosis (CAE). We retrospectively analyzed 10 clinical-identified CAE cases MR performance, <b>and</b> summarized the <b>MRS</b> <b>and</b> SWI performance of CAE. The 10 cases of CAE all had the history of primary HAE, among who 6 cases had single lesion (60 %), while the rest 4 cases had multiple lesions (40 %); and 4 cases were concomitant with lung metastases. MRI performance: T 2 WI lesions were coal-like low-signal shadow, with multiple small vesicles inside the lesions; MRS performance: NAA, Cho and Cr significantly reduced, an abnormally high and steep crest was found at 1. 4 ppm; the phase diagram and strength diagram of SWI showed isointensity. The <b>MRS</b> <b>and</b> SWI of CAE could provide important supplemental information for the diagnosis of CAE, especially the abnormally high and steep crest at 1. 4 ppm provide the reliable image basis for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of CAE...|$|R
