40|$|<b>Autoimmune</b> <b>nephritis</b> {{triggered}} by metallic ions was assessed in a Long-Evans rat model. The parameters evaluated included antinuclear autoantibody production, kidney damage mediated by immune complexes detected by immunofluorescence, and renal function tested by retention of nitrogen waste products and proteinuria. To accomplish our goal, {{the animals were}} treated with the following ionic metals: HgCl 2, CuSO 4, AgNO 3, and Pb(NO 3) 2. A group without ionic metals {{was used as the}} control. The results of the present investigation demonstrated that metallic ions triggered antinuclear antibody production in 60 % of animals, some of them with anti-DNA specificity. Furthermore, all animals treated with heavy metals developed toxic glomerulonephritis with immune complex deposition along the mesangium and membranes. These phenomena were accompanied by proteinuria and increased concentrations of urea. Based on these results, we conclude that metallic ions may induce experimental <b>autoimmune</b> <b>nephritis...</b>|$|E
40|$|Fluorescence-activated {{cell sorter}} {{analysis}} was used to study the peripheral lymphocyte populations during mercuric chloride (HgCl 2) -induced <b>autoimmune</b> <b>nephritis</b> in the Brown Norway (BN) rat. Sequential studies showed a transient loss of T cells from peripheral blood attributable to decreases in the percentage of T-helper cells. In addition, there was a decrease in the percentage of T-cytotoxic/suppressor cells prior to the appearance of circulating anti-GBM antibodies, followed by elevated levels of T-suppressor cells during down-regulation of the response. This method may allow closer inspection of the events linking changes in T-cell populations and induction and termination of an autoimmune response...|$|E
40|$|Nrf 2 {{deficiency}} improves <b>autoimmune</b> <b>nephritis</b> {{caused by}} the fas mutation lpr. BackgroundNrf 2 is a basic leucine zipper transcriptional activator essential for the coordinate transcriptional induction of antioxidant and phase II drug metabolizing enzymes. We previously reported that Nrf 2 -deficient female mice develop lupus-like <b>autoimmune</b> <b>nephritis</b> (Kidney Int 60 : 1343 – 1353, 2001). The result suggested that nrf 2 is a possible candidate gene in determining susceptibility to autoimmune diseases. MRL/lpr mice, defective in Fas-mediated apoptosis, develop glomerulonephritis due {{to the production of}} autoantibodies. MethodsTo investigate the mechanism whereby Nrf 2 contributes to the susceptibility to autoimmune diseases, we generated nrf 2 -/-lpr/lpr mice. ResultsUnexpectedly, the lifespan of nrf 2 -/-lpr/lpr female mice was markedly prolonged and these mice showed an improvement in nephritis compared to nrf 2 +/+lpr/lpr female mice. Immunologic abnormalities and hypergammaglobulinemia were also alleviated in nrf 2 -/-lpr/lpr female mice. Furthermore, lymphadenopathy was suppressed as a result of increased apoptosis. To elucidate the molecular mechanism causing a stimulation of apoptosis, we analyzed the response made by nrf 2 -/-lpr/lpr mice to death signals. We show that nrf 2 -/-lpr/lpr mice are sensitive to tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) –mediated apoptosis. Since intracellular glutathione levels are decreased in Nrf 2 -deficient cells, it is probable that a prolonged depletion in glutathione levels leads to the enhancement in TNF-α–mediated apoptosis. ConclusionThese results indicate that a deficiency in Nrf 2 enhances TNF-α–mediated apoptosis which in-turn ameliorates the abnormal apoptotic response that arises from a mutation in the lpr gene. Therefore, Nrf 2 deficiency acts as a suppressor of the autoimmune accelerating gene lpr...|$|E

The BN strain has a tubular basement membrane (TBM) antigen (Ag+) detectable by immunofluorescence which {{is lacking in}} unmodified LEW rat TBM. Development of TIN in LEW rats correlated with TBM Ag+ immunogens from homologous and heterologous RBM preparations. By day 14 after immunization TIN developed characterized by elevated serum creatinine levels and by tubular destruction with focal, circumscribed lesions containing epithelioid cells, giant cells and mononuclear cell infiltrates. Approximately 60 % of the mononuclear cells bore T cell antigens with most cells expressing la markers. Immunofluorescence and elution studies revealed no selective IgG fixation to TBM at day 14 despite high titers of circulating alloantibody reactive with the immunizing TBM. Intravenous transfer of LNC and/or splenic cells (3. 5 to 7 × 108) to naive LEW rats resulted in less severe but histologically identical TIN in seven days with T cell subpopulations similar to those seen in the active model. This model strongly suggests an initiating role for cell–mediated immunity in TIN in the rat and may provide a parallel to human TIN...|$|R

40|$|Nrf 2 -deficient female mice develop lupus-like <b>autoimmune</b> <b>nephritis.</b> BackgroundNF-E 2 –related factor 2 (Nrf 2) {{is a basic}} {{leucine zipper}} {{transcriptional}} activator essential for the coordinate transcriptional induction of antioxidant enzymes and phase II drug metabolizing enzymes through the antioxidant response element/electrophile response element. The Nrf 2 -deficient mice were found to develop normally under standard laboratory conditions. However, upon closer examination, we found that aged female Nrf 2 -deficient mice displayed a shortened lifespan and developed severe glomerulonephritis. The present study investigated the glomerulonephritis findings in Nrf 2 -deficient mice. MethodsTo evaluate glomerular lesions of Nrf 2 -deficient mice, histological and functional analyses were performed. The amounts of serum immunoglobulins, anti-double-stranded (ds) DNA antibody, and lipid peroxidation using thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) also were measured. ResultsNrf 2 -deficient female mice over 60 weeks of age developed severe nephritis characterized by cellular proliferation, lobular formation, crescent formation, and subepithelial electron-dense deposits. In immunofluorescent assays, Nrf 2 -deficient female mice showed mesangial deposits and massive granular deposits of IgG, IgM, and C 3 along the capillary walls. Higher serum levels of IgG, anti-dsDNA antibody, lower creatinine clearance, and slight splenomegaly also were found in Nrf 2 -deficient female mice. A higher concentration of TBARS also was found in Nrf 2 -deficient female mice. ConclusionsThese data indicate that the aged Nrf 2 -deficient female mice develop lupus-like <b>autoimmune</b> <b>nephritis</b> and suggest that nrf 2 {{is one of the}} genes determining susceptibility to autoimmune disease.

40|$|Although {{glucocorticoids}} are {{a conventional}} treatment for lupus nephritis, the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for preventing renal injury are unknown. MRL-lpr mice develop an aggressive <b>autoimmune</b> <b>nephritis.</b> As these mice become nephritic, {{there is an}} increase in the renal expression of molecules that permit or facilitate immune interactions, including MHC class II (Ia) antigens, intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1), and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Because dexamethasone (Dex) alters Ia antigen expression and suppresses cytokine generation, the authors prophylactically treated MRL-lpr mice and investigated the relative importance of these molecules in inducing renal injury. MRL-lpr mice given Dex (0. 4 mg/kg/d) from age 6 weeks were killed 4, 8, and 16 weeks after the initiation of therapy, and tissue was removed for histology and extraction of total RNA. Dex prevented lymphadenopathy and renal injury. DEX eliminated the marked Thy 1. 2 + lymphocytic infiltrates within the kidney and preserved normal renal histology and urinary protein levels. Northern blot analysis of steady-state mRNA transcripts indicated Dex suppressed a four-fold increase in kidney major histo-compatibility complex class II (Ia) molecule antigen mRNA seen by age 22 weeks (Ia/beta-actin ratios = 0. 64 +/- 0. 50 versus 2. 32 +/- 0. 48, P less than 0. 01), but did not alter the costimulatory molecules ICAM- 1 or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha). Although all of these molecules are important mediators of inflammation, <b>autoimmune</b> <b>nephritis</b> was ameliorated without alteration of TNF alpha gene transcription or ICAM- 1 transcription and surface expression. This study suggests that the benefit of steroids in nephritis stems from preventing lymphocyte infiltration into the kidney and decreasing immune interactions by limiting Ia expression...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{model has}} been {{proposed}} for the regulation of CD 45, and by homology other RPTPs, in which dimerization inhibits phosphatase activity through symmetrical interactions between an inhibitory structural wedge and the catalytic site. Here, we report the phenotype of mice with a single point mutation, glutamate 613 to arginine, that inactivates the inhibitory wedge of CD 45. The CD 45 E 613 R mutation causes polyclonal lymphocyte activation leading to lymphoproliferation and severe <b>autoimmune</b> <b>nephritis</b> with autoantibody production, resulting in death. Both homozygotes and heterozygotes develop pathology, indicating genetic dominance of CD 45 E 613 R. The dramatic phenotype of CD 45 E 613 R mice demonstrates the in vivo importance of negative regulation of CD 45 by dimerization, supporting the model for regulation of CD 45, and RPTPs in general...|$|E

40|$|MRL-lpr mice develop {{aggressive}} autoimmune {{kidney disease}} {{associated with increased}} or de novo renal expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules and a massive systemic expansion of CD 4 -CD- double negative (DN) T cells. Whereas non-MHC linked genes can {{have a profound effect}} on the development of nephritis, lymphadenopathy, and anti-DNA antibody production in MRL-lpr mice, the role of MHC molecules has not been unequivocally established. To study the role of MHC class II in this murine model of systemic lupus erythematosis, class II-deficient MRL-lpr mice (MRL-lpr -/-) were created. MRL-lpr -/- mice developed lymphadenopathy but not autoimmune renal disease or autoantibodies.

40|$|IL- 2 –mediated {{apoptosis}} {{of kidney}} tubular epithelial cells is {{regulated by the}} caspase- 8 inhibitor c-FLIP. BackgroundTubular epithelial cells (TECs) are essential in the maintenance of kidney function. Apoptosis of TECs occur during acute and chronic renal allograft rejection {{as well as other}} forms of renal injury, including <b>autoimmune</b> <b>nephritis.</b> The regulation of TEC apoptosis by proinflammatory cytokines associated with renal inflammation [e. g., interleukin (IL) - 2 and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) ] has not been extensively investigated. MethodsApoptosis in murine TECs was determined by FACS with annexin-V or ligation-mediated-polymerase chain reaction (LM-PCR) and mRNA levels by reverse transcription (RT) -PCR or Northern blot. Protein expression was observed using Western blot. ResultsIL- 2 R (CD 25) was expressed by murine TECs and up-regulated by IL- 2. Both IL- 2 and IFN-γ induced TEC apoptosis and activated caspase- 8. Apoptosis with IL- 2 was concentration-dependent and blocked by z-IETD-fmk, a specific caspase- 8 inhibitor. Apoptosis with IFN-γ was associated with increased surface expression of Fas, while IL- 2 had no effect on Fas. IL- 2 did not induce apoptosis in Fas-deficient TECs (M 3. 1 -lpr) suggesting IL- 2 regulation of caspase- 8 activity requires Fas. Consistent with this, IL- 2 but not IFN-γ was found to decrease mRNA and protein expression of c-FLIP, an endogenous caspase- 8 inhibitor in murine TECs. Overexpression of c-FLIP in TECs (CS 3. 7 -FLIP) blocked apoptosis and caspase- 8 activation with both IFN-γ and IL- 2. c-FLIP expression was found in kidney cortex, primary and cloned TECs, suggesting c-FLIP is likely a key regulator of caspase- 8 –mediated apoptosis in vivo. ConclusionThis is the first report of c-FLIP regulation by IL- 2 in renal TECs. Augmentation of c-FLIP in TECs may enhance an endogenous mechanism by which TECs normally resist injury to caspase- 8 –mediated apoptosis and thus may be a useful and novel strategy to prevent tubular injury in transplant rejection and <b>autoimmune</b> <b>nephritis...</b>|$|E

40|$|New {{information}} {{continues to}} emerge regarding basic immunologic mechanisms of self-tolerance. While tolerance is often defined at the T or B cell level (1), the overall process {{can also be}} categorized by mechanisms mediated either by the deletion of self-reactive clones, the effects of suppressor T cell surveillance, or the sequential action of both processes (2). Such mechanisms have been intensively analyzed {{in the context of}} strategies designed to induce immunologic unresponsiveness to histocompatibility antigens on lymphocytes, skin, and most transplantable organs (3 - 6). Current evidence, however, has not directly established whether such findings can be extended to the prevention of antigenspecific autoimmunity to non-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 1 parenchymal self.

40|$|Guinea pigs {{sensitized}} with heterologous renal cortical tubular {{basement membrane}} (TBM) 1 preparations develop a characteristic form of <b>autoimmune</b> tubulointerstitial <b>nephritis</b> (anti-TBM disease) (1). Widespread cortical tubular damage occurs, {{together with an}} extensive interstitial infiltrate that includes lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, and multinucleated giant cells (1 - 5). The disease {{is believed to be}} mediated by anti-TBM autoantibodies for several reasons: linear deposits of immunoglobulin are present along the TBM (1, 3); antibodies reactive with normal TBM can be demonstrated in the serum and in eluates from diseased kidneys (1, 4, 6, 7), and the disease can be transferred with serum containing anti-TBM antibodies (4 - 9). It has not been shown which immunoglobulin type mediates the disease, although IgG has been detected along the TBM (2 - 9). In the guinea pig there are two well characterized isotypes (subclasses) of IgG (IgG 1 and IgG 2) with distinctive biologic properties (10).

40|$|Chronic {{kidney disease}} (CKD) {{is a major}} cause of death and {{morbidity}} in Australia and worldwide. DNA vaccination has been used for targeting foreign antigens to induce immune responses and prevent autoimmune disease, viral infection and cancer. However, the use of DNA vaccination has been restricted by a limited ability to induce strong immune responses, especially against self-antigens which are limited by mechanisms of self-tolerance. Furthermore, there have been few studies on the potential of DNA vaccination in chronic inflammatory diseases, including CKD. We have established strategies of DNA vaccination targeting specific self-antigens in the immune system including co-stimulatory pathways, T cell receptors and chemokine molecules, which have been effective in protecting against the development of CKD in a variety of animal models. In particular, we find that the efficacy of DNA vaccination is improved by dendritic cell (DC) targeting and can protect against animal models of <b>autoimmune</b> <b>nephritis</b> mimicking human membranous nephropathy. In this review, we summarize several approaches that have been tested to improve the efficacy of DNA vaccination in CKD models, including enhanced DNA vaccine delivery methods, DNA vaccine modifications and new molecular targets for DNA vaccination.

40|$|The {{expression}} of the complement protein C 3 in extrahepatic tissues is highly regulated {{during the course of}} inflammation. Hence, systemic acute phase stimuli such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and <b>autoimmune</b> <b>nephritis</b> in aged 'lupus mice' (MRL-lpr/lpr and NZB x NZW F 1) both lead to increased C 3 mRNA expression in whole kidney. In situ hybridization was used to determine the intrarenal cell type(s) capable of constitutive and regulated C 3 mRNA expression. Normal mice injected with Escherichia coli LPS show a marked increase in whole kidney C 3 mRNA over control (saline-injected) animals. The renal C 3 mRNA in LPS-stimulated mice was found in cortical tubular epithelium. By contrast, in aged (18 week) MRL-lpr/lpr mice, which develop lupus nephritis, the increased intrarenal C 3 messenger RNA was localized to perivascular inflammatory cells surrounding medium-sized arteries. Similar perivascular infiltrates were seen in the lungs of the MRL-lpr/lpr mice, and focal inflammatory cell infiltrates were also found in the myocardium. Leucocytes in these infiltrates accounted for the increased C 3 expression in these tissues.

40|$|The {{integrin}} α 4 β 1 (VLA- 4) {{not only}} mediates the adhesion and transendothelial migration of leukocytes, but also provides costimulatory signals {{that contribute to}} the activation of T lymphocytes. However, the behavior of α 4 β 1 during the formation of the immune synapse is currently unknown. Here, we show that α 4 β 1 is recruited to both human and murine antigen-dependent immune synapses, when the antigen-presenting cell is a B lymphocyte or a dendritic cell, colocalizing with LFA- 1 at the peripheral supramolecular activation complex. However, when conjugates are formed in the presence of anti-α 4 antibodies, VLA- 4 colocalizes with the CD 3 -ζ chain {{at the center of the}} synapse. In addition, antibody engagement of α 4 integrin promotes polarization toward a T helper 1 (Th 1) response in human in vitro models of CD 4 + T cell differentiation and naïve T cell priming by dendritic cells. The in vivo administration of anti-α 4 integrin antibodies also induces an immune deviation to Th 1 response that dampens a Th 2 -driven <b>autoimmune</b> <b>nephritis</b> in Brown Norway rats.

40|$|We {{have used}} the murine model of {{spontaneous}} <b>autoimmune</b> interstitial <b>nephritis</b> in kdkd mice to examine the importance of abnormal immunoregulation in the expression of disease. T cells from naive congenic CBA/Ca mice suppress both histologic renal injury in the kdkd strain {{as well as the}} DTH reactivity to CBA/Ca renal tubular antigens mediated by lymphocytes from nephritic kdkd mice. These antigen- specific suppressor T cells are Lyt- 2 +, L 3 T 4 +, I-Jk+, genetically dominant and I-Jk restricted. Unfractionated spleen cells from young, prenephritic kdkd mice also demonstrate such suppressor function. Shortly preceding disease onset, however, net suppression is functionally bypassed by emergent contrasuppressor T cells. These regulatory cells are also Lyt- 2 + and I-Jk+, and adhere both to the Vicia Villosa lectin and CBA/Ca TBM. By admixing these contrasuppressor cells with spleen cells from non-disease-prone CBA/Ca mice we were able to demonstrate the presence of DTH-reactive and nephritogenic effector cells in the latter population. Such nephritogenic effector cells could also be simply demonstrated after depletion of the suppressor cells with anti-I-Jk mAbs and complement.

Transforming {{growth factor}} beta (TGF-β) has been clearly linked in several model systems to the {{development}} of pathologic extracellular matrix deposition in the glomerulus and interstitium. TGF-β additionally exerts multiple immunomodulatory effects on T and B lymphocytes, including growth inhibition. Such pleiotropic effects make it difficult to predict how TGF-β might directionally affect the expression of T cell mediated kidney disease. We have examined the effects of TGF-β 1 on the activity of effector T cells in a model of <b>autoimmune</b> interstitial <b>nephritis.</b> M 52. 26 is an antigen-specific, nephritogenic, cytotoxic T cell clone. TGF-β 1 mediates a concentration-dependent inhibition of M 52. 26 -directed cytotoxicity of tubular epithelial cells in culture, and also of M 52. 26 -mediated transfer of interstitial nephritis to syngeneic recipients. The loss of these functional activities is associated with distinct changes in cytokine gene expression in M 52. 26.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate local TNF and IL- 1 beta gene expression in vivo in the kidneys of MRL-Ipr mice with <b>autoimmune</b> lupus <b>nephritis.</b> TNF mRNA was detected in the renal cortex of MRL-Ipr mice but was not present in the cortex of normal congenic MRL-++ or C 3 H/FeJ mice.

In addition, freshly isolated, unstimulated glomeruli from MRL-Ipr mice with nephritis were found to secrete detectable levels of TNF, whereas glomeruli from MRL-++ mice did not. IL- 1 beta mRNA, present in the renal cortex of C 3 H/FeJ, MRL-++, and young MRL-Ipr mice with normal kidneys, was also more abundantly expressed in MRL-Ipr mice with nephritis.

We {{report that the}} β-chemokine RANTES, a chemoattractant for macrophages and T cells, is up-regulated in the MRL-Faslpr kidney prior to injury, but not normal kidneys (MRL-++, C 3 H-++) and increases with progressive injury. Furthermore, we establish an association between RANTES expression in the kidney and renal damage using a gene transfer approach. Tubular epithelial cells genetically modified to secrete RANTES infused under the renal capsule incites interstitial nephritis in MRL-Faslpr, but not MRL-++ or C 3 H-++ mice. RANTES recruits predominantly macrophages (Mø) and CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells. In contrast, gene transfer of CSF- 1, another molecule up-regulated simultaneously with RANTES in MRL-Faslpr kidneys, promotes the influx of Mø, CD 4 + T cells and the unique double-negative (DN) T cells (CD 4 -,CD 8 -), which are prominent in diseased MRL-Faslpr kidneys. Thus, RANTES and CSF- 1 recruit distinct T cell populations into the MRL-Faslpr kidney. In addition, delivery of RANTES and CSF- 1 into the kidney of MRL-Faslpr mice causes an additive increase in pathology. We suggest that the complementary recruitment of T cell populations by RANTES (CD 4, CD 8) and CSF- 1 (CD 4, DN) promotes <b>autoimmune</b> <b>nephritis</b> in MRL-Faslpr mice...|$|E

There are both preclinical and clinical evidence that SLE patients may benefit from consumption of n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) found in fish oil, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Here we employed the NZBWF 1 SLE mouse model to compare the effects of dietary lipids on the onset and severity of autoimmune glomerulonephritis after consuming: 1) n- 3 PUFA-rich diet containing docosahexaenoic acid-enriched fish oil (DFO), 2) n- 6 PUFA-rich Western-type diet containing corn oil (CRN) or 3) n- 9 monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) -rich Mediterranean-type diet containing high oleic safflower oil (HOS).

40|$|Oxidative {{stress and}} {{inflammation}} are mediators {{in the development}} and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its complications, and they are inseparably linked as each begets and amplifies the other. CKD-associated oxidative stress is due to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and diminished antioxidant capacity. The latter is largely caused by impaired activation of Nrf 2, the transcription factor that regulates genes encoding antioxidant and detoxifying molecules. Protective effects of Nrf 2 are evidenced by amelioration of oxidative stress, inflammation, and kidney disease in response to natural Nrf 2 activators in animal models, while Nrf 2 deletion amplifies these pathogenic pathways and leads to <b>autoimmune</b> <b>nephritis.</b> Given the role of impaired Nrf 2 activity in CKD-induced oxidative stress and inflammation, interventions aimed at restoring Nrf 2 may be effective in retarding CKD progression.

However, due to unforeseen complications the BEACON trial, which was designed to investigate the effect of this drug on time to end-stage renal disease or cardiovascular death in patients with advanced CKD, was prematurely terminated.

40|$|Analysis of the cDNA {{sequence}} encoding MHC-Aβ in tubular epithelium from mouse kidney.

In the current experiments we investigated whether the previously recognized sparseness of Aβ on the surface of tubular epithelial cells might be accounted for by a protein coding difference deduced from the primary structure of its transcript compared with sequence from lymphoid cells that normally express Aβ in generous amounts. We demonstrate, however, using clones obtained from a cDNA library prepared from tubular epithelium harvested from H- 2 S (Aβ/α+Eβ/α-) mice susceptible to <b>autoimmune</b> interestitial <b>nephritis,</b> that the nucleotide sequence encoding the class II Aβ chain in cells from both compartments is essentially identical. Our findings suggest that there is no primary structural aberrancy in the coding region of parenchymal Aβ that would contribute to its low expression. The protective tolerance afforded by reduced numbers of class II molecules in normal tissues is, therefore, more likely the result of repressive regulatory processes...|$|R
40|$|Experimental gold {{nephropathy}} in {{guinea pigs}}: Detection of autoantibodies to renal tubular antigens. Renal tubular dysfunction was induced in Hartley guinea pigs by injection of sodium aurothiomalate (gold) as manifested by excretion of tubular basement membrane (TBM) antigen and renal tubular epithelial (RTE) antigen in urine and tubular proteinuria. Following the tubular dysfunction, <b>autoimmune</b> tubulointerstitial <b>nephritis</b> (TIN) and/or immune complex nephropathy (ICN) {{developed in a}} large proportion of animals. TIN was associated with anti-TBM antibodies, and the histological features were characterized by tubular lesions with interstitial mononuclear cell infiltration, destruction of tubules, and interstitial fibrosis. In ICN, the glomerular lesions consisted of partial thickening of capillary walls and mesangial cellularity, and granular immune deposits were seen in the mesangial area and on capillary walls. Furthermore, electron-dense deposits were demonstrated in the mesangial area and in the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) by electron microscopy. Anti-RTE antibodies were detected in the sera and eluates from the kidney of animals with ICN. RTE antigens were also detected in the glomerular deposits by indirect immunofluorescence using anti-guinea pig RTE antibody. These results suggest that TBM and RTE antigens released from renal tubules damaged by a direct toxic action of gold may lead to antibody formation against these antigens and induce TIN and/or ICN...|$|R
40|$|Effects of {{cyclosporin}} A on {{the development}} of immune-mediated interstitial nephritis. We examined the effect of daily cyclosporin A administration {{on the development}} and extent of tubulointerstitial nephritis produced in rats immunized with tubular basement membranes in adjuvant. Six mg/kg/day of cyclosporin A, given from the time of immunization, completely blocked the development of interstitial lesions and renal insufficiency. The administration of cyclosporin A after the development of interstitial nephritis also arrested the progression of the histological lesions. Both T cell-mediated and humoral immunity were markedly reduced by the administration of cyclosporin A, as evidenced by the near absence of delayed-type hypersensitivity responses and by the reduced production of anti-tubular basement membrane antibodies. Cell admixture experiments indicated that impairment of the delayed-type hypersensitivity response to tubular antigen was probably not the result of active suppression, and suggested that the protective effect of cyclosporin A might be secondary to its direct inhibitory action on the activation of nephritogenic T and B cells. Finally, the treatment of control rats with cyclosporin A, in the doses used, did not produce any detectable kidney damage nor did it impair renal function. We conclude that cyclosporin A can be an effective prophylactic and therapeutic agent in <b>autoimmune</b> interstitial <b>nephritis</b> in rats...|$|R
40|$|Sjögren's {{syndrome}} (SS) is an incurable, autoimmune exocrinopathy that predominantly affects {{females and}} whose pathogenesis remains unknown. Like rheumatoid arthritis, its severity increases after menopause, and estrogen deficiency has been implicated. We {{have reported that}} estrogen receptor-α and -β-knockout mice develop <b>autoimmune</b> <b>nephritis</b> and myeloid leukemia, respectively, but neither develops SS. One model of estrogen deficiency in rodents is the aromatase-knockout (ArKO) mouse. In these animals, there is elevated B lymphopoiesis in bone marrow. We now report that ArKO mice develop severe autoimmune exocrinopathy resembling SS. By 1 year of age, there is B cell hyperplasia in the bone marrow, spleen, and blood of ArKO mice and spontaneous autoimmune manifestations such as proteinuria and severe leukocyte infiltration in the salivary glands and kidney. Also, as is typically found in human SS, there were proteolytic fragments of α-fodrin in the salivary glands and anti-α-fodrin antibodies in the serum of both female and male ArKO mice. When mice were raised on a phytoestrogen-free diet, there was a mild but significant incidence of infiltration of B lymphocytes in WT mice and severe destructive autoimmune lesions in ArKO mice. In age-matched WT mice fed a diet containing normal levels of phytoestrogen, there were no autoimmune lesions. These results reveal that estrogen deficiency results in a lymphoproliferative autoimmune disease resembling SS and suggest that estrogen might have clinical value in the prevention or treatment of this disease...|$|E
40|$|Fas on renal parenchymal cells {{does not}} promote <b>autoimmune</b> <b>nephritis</b> in MRL mice. BackgroundAlthough Fas on {{pancreatic}} islets promotes autoimmune diabetes in mice, {{the role of}} Fas expression on kidney parenchymal cells during autoimmune disease is unknown. MethodsTo determine whether Fas on renal parenchymal cells promotes autoimmune renal destruction, we compared apoptosis and pathology in Fas-intact and Fas-deficient kidneys in an autoimmune milieu. For this purpose, we transplanted single, normal kidneys from MRL-++ (Fas-intact) mice (3 months of age) into age-matched, congenic MRL-Faslpr (Fas-deficient) recipients after removal of nephritic kidneys. These Fas-intact kidneys were compared with Fas-deficient nephritic kidneys. ResultsThere is a progressive increase of FasL on kidney-infiltrating cells and Fas and FasL on renal parenchymal cells in MRL-++ kidneys during engraftment (0, 2, 4 – 6, and 8 weeks). By comparison, we detected an increase in FasL in MRL-Faslpr kidneys (3 to 5 months of age), whereas Fas was not detectable. The engagement of T cells bearing FasL with Fas expressing tubular epithelial cells (TECs) induced TEC apoptosis in vitro. However, apoptosis and pathology were similar in kidneys (MRL-++, 8 weeks postengraftment vs. MRL-Faslpr, 5 months) with equivalent amounts of FasL-infiltrating cells or FasL TECs, regardless of Fas on renal parenchymal cells. ConclusionThe expression of Fas on renal parenchymal cells does not increase apoptosis or promote renal disease in MRL-++ mice. We speculate that the autoimmune milieu evokes mechanisms that mask, counter, or pre-empt Fas-FasL-initiated apoptosis in MRL kidneys...|$|E
40|$|A T helper 1 (Th 1) /Th 2 {{imbalance}} {{is thought}} {{to contribute to the}} pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. The differentiation of T cells into Th 1 or Th 2 subtypes is under the regulation of several transcription factors. Among these, transcription factor GATA- 3 {{is thought to}} play an indispensable {{role in the development of}} T cells and the differentiation of Th 2 cells. To examine how a Th 1 /Th 2 imbalance affects the development of autoimmune disease, GATA- 3 was overexpressed in the T lymphocytes of C 57 BL/ 6 x BXSB/MpJ-Yaa F(1) (Yaa) mice. Yaa mice developed <b>autoimmune</b> <b>nephritis</b> similarly to BXSB/MpJ-Yaa mice, which are commonly used as a model for Th 1 -dominant murine lupus. GATA- 3 overexpression in T cells improved the 50 % mortality incidence time for GATA- 3 -transgenic Yaa mice (41. 6 wk), compared with Yaa mice (30. 9 wk), and reduced proteinuria, serum creatinine levels, and the severity of glomerulonephritis in GATA- 3 -transgenic Yaa mice. GATA- 3 overexpression in Yaa mice led to simultaneously elevated Th 2 Ig (IgG 1) and decreased Th 1 Ig (IgG 2 a and IgG 3) production and serum IFN-gamma levels. Although IL- 4 production remained unchanged, intracellular cytokine analyses demonstrated that IL- 5 was induced and IFN-gamma was suppressed in stimulated T cells from the GATA- 3 -transgenic Yaa mice. These results indicated that abundant GATA- 3 was unable to stimulate complete differentiation of Th 2 cells but did counteract the dominance of Th 1 cells and alleviated the disease severity in Yaa mice. These data suggest that transcriptional regulation therapy may have potential as an effective strategy for treating autoimmune glomerulonephritis...|$|E
40|$|Polymorphisms in the {{transcription}} factor Stat 4 gene have been implicated as {{risk factors for}} systemic lupus erythematosus. Although some polymorphisms have a strong association with autoantibodies and nephritis, their impact on pathophysiology is still unknown. To explore this further we used signal transducers and activators of transcription 4 (Stat 4) knockout MRL/MpJ-Faslpr/Faslpr (MRL-Faslpr) mice and found {{that they did not}} differ in survival or renal function from Stat 4 -intact MRL-Faslpr mice. Circulating interleukin (IL) - 18 levels, however, were elevated in Stat 4 -deficient compared to Stat 4 -intact mice, suggesting that this interleukin might contribute to the progression of lupus nephritis independent of Stat 4. In a second approach, Stat 4 antisense or missense oligonucleotides or vehicle were given to MRL-Faslpr mice with advanced nephritis. Each of these treatments temporarily ameliorated disease, although IL- 18 was increased in each setting. Based on these findings, studies using gene transfer to overexpress IL- 18 in MRL-Faslpr and IL- 12 p 40 /IL- 23 knockout MRL-Faslpr mice reveal a critical role for IL- 18 in mediating disease. Thus, the Stat 4 and IL- 12 (an activator of Stat 4) -independent factor, IL- 18, can drive <b>autoimmune</b> lupus <b>nephritis</b> in MRL-Faslpr mice. Temporarily blocking Stat 4 during advanced nephritis ameliorates disease, suggesting a time-dependent compensatory proinflammatory mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Aleutian mink {{disease is}} {{generally}} considered to precipitate spontaneously in ranch mink, with a lethal outcome. A two-year field study of a herd of susceptible mutant mink (sapphires and violets), however, has shown that all individual mink were affected from birth; the well state consisted of periodic low-level hypergamma-globulinemia accompanied by minute vascular occlusions. The spontaneous lethal change in an individual appeared to arise during one of these hypergammaglobu-linemic episodes and thus represented {{a failure of the}} immune system to control an inherent virus-induced mononucleosis. The fact that the entire herd was affected by the periodic form from birth is considered strong evidence for vertical trans-mission at a rate of 100 %. The incidence of spontaneous precipitation was found to be dependent on the level of hypergammaglobulinemia in the mother during pregnancy. Aleutian mink disease (AMD) occurs in mink as a spontaneous degeneration with <b>autoimmune</b> disease-type <b>nephritis,</b> generalized plasmacytosis, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and hypergam-maglobulinemia [1, 2]. Only a few brief studies of the normal levels ofy-globulin in serum of mink have been reported, although the hypergammaglobulinemia of the spontaneous, lethal form of AMD has received much attention. An opportunity to ex-amine these normal levels arose during observa-Received for publication December 15, 1975, and in revised form, March 8, 1976.

40|$|In {{order to}} examine the {{possibility}} that a local chronic infection can induce organ-specific autoimmune disease, we inoculated unilateral kidneys with viable Listeria monocytogenes (intrarenal infection). The delayed footpad reaction against syngeneic kidney homogenate (KH) became positive from 1 week after initiating the intrarenal infection. A proliferative response of the spleen T cells from the infected mice was also observed against KH from 1 week after initiating the intrarenal infection, but no such response was seen against liver homogenate (LH). In contrast, an intravenous Listeria infection did not induce a delayed footpad reaction or proliferative response against KH, suggesting that these autoimmune responses were not caused by molecular mimicry between renal antigens and Listeria antigens. Furthermore, the ability to transfer the autoimmune response of spleen T cells from intrarenally infected mice was examined. The transferred mice showed a positive delayed footpad reaction against KH and an interstitial infiltration of mononuclear cells in their kidneys. These results demonstrate that the intrarenal Listeria infection induced renal autoantigen-specific T cells, which subsequently induced an <b>autoimmune</b> interstitial <b>nephritis</b> (AIN). The autoreactive T cells were all induced without immunization by autoantigens mixed with complete Freund's adjuvant. Based on these findings, we propose that a local bacterial infection may induce an autoimmune response against autoantigens in the infected organ and subsequently trigger organ-specific autoimmune disease...|$|R
