60|$|Granet {{struggled}} for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> idea and rejected it. He drained {{his glass and}} leaned across the table.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} me for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> air of perplexity, as if she really could not {{remember}} whom I was.|$|R

60|$|She {{stood still}} <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> expressionless face, finding no words to say; then <b>with</b> <b>an</b> effort she roused herself {{and shook hands}} with him.|$|R
60|$|She came in; {{and after}} glancing round her for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{uncertain}} air, stood pressing her small hands hard together, close within the door.|$|R
60|$|She {{broke off}} for <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> flush {{in her face}} and a curious little laugh.|$|E
60|$|Appleby {{stood still}} <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> flush on his {{forehead}} and a curious glow in his eyes.|$|E
60|$|Young McKay stopped, {{and looked}} quickly up for <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> slight flush, but {{instantly}} resumed work.|$|E
60|$|I nodded. He {{stared at}} me for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> astonishment to which I was wholly indifferent. He {{did not seem to}} know just how to act.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't say {{nasty things}} about her!" [...] Lady Agnes broke out solemnly {{to her son}} after resting her eyes on him <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> air of {{reluctant}} reprobation.|$|R

60|$|He {{broke off}} for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> deprecatory gesture, which in {{connection}} with the story was very expressive.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the night}} he saw a vision. It {{seemed to him that}} a resplendent and {{beautiful}} form appeared before him, and after regarding him <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> earnest look, addressed him as follows: ...|$|R
60|$|She {{picked up}} her parasol from the trunk, and after {{standing}} regarding him for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> air of offended maidenhood, {{walked back to the}} town. Bassett, after a long interval, returned by another road.|$|R
60|$|Seaman lit {{one of his}} {{inevitable}} {{cigars and}} threw one of his short, fat legs over the other. He gazed for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> air of satisfaction at his small foot, neatly encased in court shoes.|$|R
60|$|He stopped <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> little groan, while Appleby {{regarded}} him compassionately, and then continued {{in a low}} strained voice.|$|E

60|$|Isaac {{looked at}} him for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> intentness which was indescribable. His black eyes seemed on fire with suspicion, with searchfulness. At last he let go the arm which he was clutching, and turned away.|$|R
60|$|The veteran {{gazed at}} her, for <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{expression}} {{of his eye}} that denoted reviving tenderness; but gloomy doubts appeared to cross his mind again, and he shook his head, as he walked proudly away.|$|R
60|$|Several white dints {{began to}} come and go about Mr Lammle's nose, as he {{observed}} that Mrs Boffin merely looked up from the teapot for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> embarrassed smile, which was no smile, and then looked down again.|$|R
60|$|The {{strange and}} singularly-attired being, who occasioned so much uneasiness to Alida, {{regarded}} her <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> kind and melancholy solicitude.|$|E

6000|$|The young warrior {{regarded}} his interrogator for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{steady and}} deliberating eye; then raising his finger upward, he answered with dignity-- ...|$|E

60|$|I {{had given}} him no time to speak, nor did he seem so inclined.

60|$|He {{extended}} his long arm over the small table, {{and spread out}} his enormous palm in front of Jessie Seaward. <b>With</b> <b>an</b> amused laugh she laid her little hand in it--to grasp {{it was out of}} the question--and the mighty palm closed for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> affectionate squeeze. The same ceremony having been gone through with Kate, he proceeded to carve.|$|R
