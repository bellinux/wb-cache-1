5|$|As for the {{classification}} of the Mongolic family relative to other languages, the Altaic theory (which is increasingly less well received among linguists) proposes that the Mongolic family {{is a member of}} a larger, now discredited Altaic family that would <b>also</b> <b>include</b> <b>the</b> Turkic and Tungusic, and usually Koreanic languages and Japonic languages as well.|$|E
5|$|Community ecology is {{the study}} of the {{interactions}} among a collections of species that inhabit the same geographic area.

Research in community ecology might measure species diversity in grasslands in relation to soil fertility. It might <b>also</b> <b>include</b> <b>the</b> analysis of predator-prey dynamics, competition among similar plant species, or mutualistic interactions between crabs and corals.|$|E

5|$|Animals {{and plants}} {{have evolved to}} {{synthesise}} {{a vast array of}} poisonous products including secondary metabolites, peptides and proteins that can act as inhibitors. Natural toxins are usually small organic molecules and are so diverse that there are probably natural inhibitors for most metabolic processes. The metabolic processes targeted by natural poisons encompass more than enzymes in metabolic pathways and can <b>also</b> <b>include</b> <b>the</b> inhibition of receptor, channel and structural protein functions in a cell. For example, paclitaxel (taxol), an organic molecule found in the Pacific yew tree, binds tightly to tubulin dimers and inhibits their assembly into microtubules in the cytoskeleton.|$|E
5|$|At Panxian, {{there appears}} to have been a {{transition}} in the endemic marine reptile fauna, possibly caused by volcanism. This volcanism is indicated by the presence of a bentonite layer between the Middle and Upper Reptile Horizons. From lower in the Upper Reptile Horizon, fossils have also been found of the ubiquitous mixosaurian ichthyosaur Mixosaurus panxianensis (which occurs in all layers), the pachypleurosaurs Keichousaurus sp. and Wumengosaurus delicatomandibularis, and fish, although fossils of the latter are fragmentary. The lower Middle and Lower Reptile Horizons <b>also</b> <b>include</b> <b>the</b> mixosaurian Phalarodon cf. fraasi, the primitive ichthyosaur Xinminosaurus catactes, the placodont Placodus inexpectatus, the nothosaurs Lariosaurus hongguoensis and Nothosaurus yangjuanensis, and the archosaur Qianosuchus mixtus, alongside bivalves and saurichthyid fish.|$|E

5|$|Bradford City {{were formed}} in 1903 and were elected into the Second Division {{before they had}} even played a game. Bradford City and Chelsea, in 1905, remain the only teams to be elected into the league before playing a {{competitive}} fixture. The club were promoted to the First Division when they won the Second Division title in 1907–08. In 1910–11 the club recorded their highest league position of fifth and also won their only major honour when captain Jimmy Speirs lifted the FA Cup after he scored the only goal to defeat Newcastle United 1–0 in the final replay. Bradford City's honours <b>also</b> <b>include</b> <b>the</b> Third Division North title in 1928–29 and the Third Division crown in 1984–85, {{as well as the}} Third Division North Challenge Cup in 1938–39.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Innovation Norway criticized Nordland County Municipality, who {{administrated}} the DA-funds, {{stating that}} both the grant and load to Glimt were illegal. Therefore, both were converted to an interest-bearing loan and were issued to Aspmyra Stadion instead of the club. The club is required to have positive equity to keep its license {{to play in the}} top two tiers. Because it was the majority shareholder of the stadium company, it filed consolidated accounts which <b>also</b> <b>include</b> <b>the</b> equity of Aspmyra Stadion AS. Thus, the consequence of Innovation Norway's proceedings was that the club risked ending up with a negative equity and could be relegated to the third tier. To secure it retained a positive equity, Glimt proposed selling the venue to the municipality.|$|E

The horses were used by the colonists during the American Revolution, and by South Carolinians for farm work, herding cattle and hunting throughout the breed's history.|$|E
5|$|The term hippocampal {{formation}} {{is used to}} refer to the hippocampus proper and its related parts. However, there is no consensus as to what parts are included. Sometimes the hippocampus is said to include the dentate gyrus and the subiculum. Some references include the dentate gyrus and the subiculum in the hippocampal formation, and others <b>also</b> <b>include</b> <b>the</b> presubiculum, parasubiculum, and entorhinal cortex. The neural layout and pathways within the hippocampal formation are very similar in all mammals.|$|E

The two countries presently control one {{bank of the}} present-day river each, but Croatia claims that the border line should follow the cadastral borders between the former municipalities of SR Croatia and SR Serbia along the Danube, as defined by a Yugoslav commission in 1947 (effectively following a former river bed); borders claimed by Croatia <b>also</b> <b>include</b> <b>the</b> Vukovar and Šarengrad islands in the Danube as its territory. There is also a border dispute with Bosnia–Herzegovina, specifically Croatia claims Unčica channel on the right bank of Una as the border at Hrvatska Kostajnica, while Bosnia and Herzegovina claims Una River course as the border there.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature {{established}} Route30, an unsigned legislative route {{extending from}} Niagara Falls, Niagara County {{in the southwest}} to Rouses Point, Clinton County, in the northeast. From Rochester to Red Creek, Route30 was assigned to Ridge Road. Between Red Creek and the hamlet of Union Square (now Maple View) {{in the town of}} Mexico, it included most of modern NY104. At the same time, the roadway alongside the Niagara River between Ridge Road in Lewiston and Pine Avenue in downtown Niagara Falls was designated, but not signed, as part of Route18. By 1914, Route30 was amended to <b>also</b> <b>include</b> <b>the</b> section of Ridge Road from Porter (modern NY429) to Ridgeway (NY63). In 1914, another section—from Ridgeway to the Orleans–Monroe county line—was also included in Route30's definition as a spur route. The spur route became part of Route30 on March 1, 1921, when the mainline route was realigned to follow Ridge Road between Ridgeway and Rochester.|$|E
5|$|Public schools allow {{religious}} education, {{in cooperation}} with religious communities that have agreements with the government, but attendance is not mandatory. The classes are organized widely in public elementary and secondary schools. In 2009, 92% of elementary school pupils and 87% of secondary school students attended the religious education classes. Public holidays in Croatia <b>also</b> <b>include</b> <b>the</b> religious festivals of Epiphany, Easter Monday, Corpus Christi Day, Assumption Day, All Saints' Day, Christmas, and St. Stephen's or Boxing Day. The religious festival public holidays {{are based on the}} Catholic liturgical year, but citizens of the Republic of Croatia who celebrate different religious holidays have the right not to work on those dates. This includes Christians who celebrate Christmas on 7 January per the Julian calendar, Muslims on the days of Ramadan Bayram and Kurban Bayram, and Jews on the days of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Marriages performed by the religious communities having agreements with the state are officially recognized, eliminating the need to register the marriages in a registrar office.|$|E
