40|$|BACKGROUND: DNA {{sequences}} {{are increasingly}} {{seen as one}} of the primary information sources for species identification in many organism groups.

CONCLUSIONS: The problems with taxonomic reliability and insufficient annotations in public DNA repositories form a tangible obstacle to sequence-based species identification, and it is manifest that the greatest challenges to biological barcoding will be of taxonomical, rather than technical, nature...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Semantic {{search is}} a key issue in {{integration}} of heterogeneous biological databases. In this paper, we present a methodology for implementing semantic search in BioDW, an integrated biological data warehouse. Two tables are presented: the DB 2 GO table to correlate Gene Ontology (GO) <b>annotated</b> <b>entries</b> from BioDW data sources with GO, and the semantic similarity table to record similarity scores derived from any pair of GO terms. Based on the two tables, multifarious ways for semantic search are provided and the corresponding entries in heterogeneous biological databases in semantic terms can be expediently searched. Key words Gene Ontology; semantic search; BioDW Various biological database systems including data capture, data storage, data retrieval and other data processing methods have been developed. These systems have become effective tools for today’s genomics and related studies. However, the highly distributed and heterogeneous characteristics of biological databases are inconvenient for retrieval of needed information from different data sources [1].

CandidaDB Release 2. 0 (June 2004) contains information pertaining to Assembly 19 of the genome of C. albicans strain SC 5314. The current release contains 6244 <b>annotated</b> <b>entries</b> corresponding to 130 tRNA genes and 5917 protein-coding genes.

The interface allows users to browse easily through genome data and retrieve information. CandidaDB also provides more elaborate tools, such as pattern searching, that are tightly connected to the overall browsing system.

This evolution, as well as this self-esteem, has not only widened {{the focus of the}} field, it has also created a sometimes unclear eclecticism of topics, influences and methods. Characteristic of a still not too well-established and not always acknowledged discipline, research in Translation Studies has been looking for common interests and common grounds with other disciplines in an ambitious, but often unstructured way. The new online Translation Studies Bibliography (TSB - first release October 2004), which concentrates on the last decade, is used here as a tool for the analysis of the multiplicity of influences. The TSB offers more than 7, 000 <b>annotated</b> <b>entries</b> (and is expanded several times a year) and uses a sophisticated key word system. The quantitative analysis of these key words and their thematic fields provides important indications about the priorities in the dissemination of TS research in the past decade.

40|$|The recent {{release of}} {{the first draft of}} the human genome {{provides}} an unprecedented opportunity to integrate human genes and their functions in a complete positional context. However, at least three significant technical hurdles remain: first, to assemble a complete and nonredundant human transcript index; second, to accurately place the individual transcript indices on the human genome; and third, to functionally annotate all human genes. Here, we report the extension of the UNIGENE database through the assembly of its sequence clusters into nonredundant sequence contigs. Each resulting consensus was aligned to the human genome draft. A unique location for each transcript within the human genome was determined by the integration of the restriction fingerprint, assembled genomic contig, and radiation hybrid (RH) maps. A total of 59, 500 UNIGENE clusters were mapped on the basis of at least three independent criteria as compared with the 30, 000 human genes/ESTs currently mapped in Genemap' 99. Finally, the extension of the human transcript consensus in this study enabled a greater number of putative functional assignments than the 11, 000 <b>annotated</b> <b>entries</b> in UNIGENE. This study reports a draft physical map with annotations for a majority of the human transcripts, called the Human Index of Nonredundant Transcripts (HINT).

The UniProt consortium maintains the UniProt KnowledgeBase (UniProtKB) and several supplementary databases including the UniProt Reference Clusters (UniRef) and the UniProt Archive (UniParc).

UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries contain information curated by biologists and provide users with cross-links to about 100 external databases and with access to additional information or tools.

The primary objective of this project has been to compile an information resource that will be useful to teachers, scholars, and students of terrorism studies, as well as to policymakers, journalists and the general public. It reflects a collective effort to provide a user-friendly introduction to the growing body of research and literature on terrorism and counterterrorism.
