25|$|A suffix (ek) is {{attached}} to a stem (gövde). A stem may be a root (kök) or further analyzable. The suffixes used in Turkish fall roughly into two classes: constructive suffixes (yapım ekleri) and inflectional suffixes (çekim ekleri). A constructive suffix makes <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>word</b> from an old one, that is, it is a derivational suffix. An inflectional suffix indicates how a word is used in a sentence. The article on Turkish grammar pertains chiefly to inflectional suffixes. The article on Turkish vocabulary treats the constructive suffixes.|$|E
25|$|When {{children}} reach about 15–18 {{months of}} age, language acquisition flourishes. There is {{a surge in}} word production resulting from {{the growth of the}} cortex. Infants begin to learn the words that form a sentence and within the sentence, the word endings can be interpreted. Elissa Newport and colleagues (1999) found that humans learn first about the sounds of a language, and then move on to how to speak the language. This shows how infants learn the end of a word and know that <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>word</b> is being spoken. From this step, infants are then able to determine the structure of a language and word.|$|E

25|$|At 20 {{months of}} age, when {{presented}} with three familiar objects (e.g., a ball, a bottle and a cup) and one unfamiliar object (e.g., an egg piercer), children are able to conclude that in the request “Can I have the zib,” zib must refer to the unfamiliar object, i.e., the egg piercer, {{even if they have}} never heard that pseudoword before. Children as young as 15 months can complete this task successfully if the experiment is conducted with fewer objects. This task shows that children aged 15 to 20 months can assign meaning to <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>word</b> after only a single exposure. Fast mapping is a necessary ability for children to acquire the number of words they have to learn during {{the first few years of}} life: Children acquire an average of nine words per day between 18 months and 6 years of age.|$|E
25|$|A word of {{explanation}} seems necessary {{with regard to}} the introduction of the new term Archebiosis. I had originally, in unpublished writings, adopted the word Biogenesis to express the same meaning—viz., life-origination or commencement. But in the mean time the word Biogenesis has been made use of, quite independently, by a distinguished biologist , who wished to make it bear a totally different meaning. He also introduced the word Abiogenesis. I have been informed, however, on the best authority, that neither of these words can—with any regard to the language from which they are derived—be supposed to bear the meanings which have of late been publicly assigned to them. Wishing to avoid all needless confusion, I therefore renounced {{the use of the word}} Biogenesis, and being, for the reason just given, unable to adopt the other term, I was compelled to introduce <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>word,</b> in order to designate the process by which living matter is supposed to come into being, independently of pre-existing living matter.|$|E

40|$|A nuclear {{exclusion}} {{appears in}} all general insurance policies. Since its introduction to Australia and New Zealand in the 1960 s this exclusion has seen almost no change. So {{what are the}} reasons for this article? There are two reasons. First, there has been a misunderstanding {{on the part of some}} in the industry about the scope of this exclusion. This results in unnecessary alterations to the policy. The other is that <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>wording</b> is emerging some sections of the market which could be tar-reaching in its effect. The purpose of this article is to examine several aspects related to the exclusion. The first section examines the nature and extent of exposures in relation to radiation and nuclear energy and serves as background to under standing the exclusion wording. Section two provides the reasons for the inclusion of the clause and its historical origins.

500|$|Morphemes can be {{classified}} according to whether they are independent morphemes, so-called roots, or whether they can only co-occur attached to other morphemes. These bound morphemes or affixes can {{be classified}} according to their position {{in relation to the}} root: prefixes precede the root, suffixes follow the root, and infixes are inserted {{in the middle of a}} root. Affixes serve to modify or elaborate the meaning of the root. Some languages change the meaning of words by changing the phonological structure of a word, for example, the English word [...] "run", which in the past tense is [...] "ran". This process is called ablaut. Furthermore, morphology distinguishes between the process of inflection, which modifies or elaborates on a word, and the process of derivation, which creates <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>word</b> from an existing one. In English, the verb [...] "sing" [...] has the inflectional forms [...] "singing" [...] and [...] "sung", which are both verbs, and the derivational form [...] "singer", which is a noun derived from the verb with the agentive suffix [...] "-er".|$|E
500|$|Vocabulary {{development}} {{during the}} school years builds upon what the child already knows, and the child uses this knowledge to broaden his or her vocabulary. Once children have gained a level of vocabulary knowledge, new words are learned through explanations using familiar, or [...] "old" [...] words. This is done either explicitly, when <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>word</b> is defined using old words, or implicitly, when the word {{is set in the}} context of old words so that the meaning of the new word is constrained. When children reach school-age, context and implicit learning are the most common ways in which their vocabularies continue to develop. By this time, children learn new vocabulary mostly through conversation and reading. Throughout schooling and adulthood, conversation and reading are the main methods in which vocabulary develops. [...] This growth tends to slow once a person finishes schooling, as they have already acquired the vocabulary used in everyday conversation and reading material and generally are not engaging in activities that require additional vocabulary development.|$|E
