500|$|The album's sound also {{incorporates}} diverse musical {{elements from}} various genres such as funk, soul, rock, dubstep, and electro music. Houston Press writer Shea Serrano describes the album as a [...] "new {{take on the}} traditional Southern rap sound. It's slow and fast, wonky and flimsy, lyrical and hook-driven". Tom Breihan of Pitchfork Media perceives [...] "1980s synth-funk" [...] as its predominant musical element, but also finds each track musically varied, stating [...] "New melodic elements flit {{in and out of}} tracks just <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>start</b> to notice them, and there's a lot going on at any given moment". Big Boi has called the music [...] "basically what you been getting from Outkast. Raw lyricism and the funkiest grooves you can lay your ears on." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{writing process}} {{consumed}} approximately six months, including three months creating notes and analyzing the novel. Zaillian noted that as time progressed, the writing accelerated. [...] "As soon <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>start</b> making decisions," [...] he explained, [...] "you start cutting off {{all of the}} other possibilities of things that could happen. [...] So with every decision that you make you are removing a whole bunch of other possibilities of where that story can go or what that character can do." [...] Given the book's sizable length, Zaillian deleted elements to match Fincher's desired running time. Even so, Zaillan took significant departures from the book. To Zaillian, there was always a [...] "low-grade" [...] anxiety, [...] "but I was never doing anything specifically to please or displease," [...] he continued. [...] "I was simply trying to tell the story the best way I could, and push that out of my mind. I didn't change anything {{just for the sake of}} changing it. There's a lot right about the book, but that part, I thought we could do it a different way, and it could be a nice surprise for the people that have read it." ...|$|E

Having sampled {{a number of}} cars in the game that I either own, drive frequently, or have driven numerous times before, I've verified how they all sound. My 350Z sounded pitch perfect <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>start</b> it up upon selecting it. Same goes for my 370Z, it sounds spot on. Even a bunch of the standard cars sounded good, and sound even better with a few exhaust mods", while TweakTown said that [...] "some cars just sounding flat when you feel they shouldn’t, and others just sending a shiver up your spine as you hit redline". Gamingreality awarded the sound 9/10, stating that [...] "The sounds are clear, crisp, and distinct. The engine sounds are great and {{make you feel like}} the car is actually near you. The engine sounds on premium cars change when you make adjustments to it just like in real life".|$|E

5000|$|Hence, peace {{journalism is}} {{anchored}} in Conflict Analysis and Peace Research [...] "to map out solid ground beneath our feet; to declare, in advance, that {{we intend to}} use it, to assign meanings and draw distinctions." [...] Decisions, on which of the almost infinite stories and facts to report, can be made openly and systematically. Lynch (2008) shows how these two disciplines are important anchors for conflict journalism in that they employ the academic rigor {{of the social sciences}} including: [...] "openness about - and prepared to justify - starting assumptions for both observation and interpretation; and peer review.

Players {{take control of their}} career on and off of the track competing in races and hiring engineers, team managers and press officers to help further their career as a pro and ultimately win the MotoGP World Championship. Demonstrating your riding skills on the track through overtaking, slip-streaming and showboating will be rewarded with Rider Reputation points.
