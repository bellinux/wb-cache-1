5|$|Drowned God uses a point-and-click {{interface}} {{and first}} person perspective typical of games similar to Myst of the mid- to late-1990s. The player navigates and {{interacts with the}} game world by clicking the mouse on {{different parts of the}} screen. The mouse cursor changes shape depending on the action clicking will perform: <b>an</b> <b>arrow</b> for moving to another location, a face with <b>an</b> <b>arrow</b> to pick up or place Tarot cards, and an Eye of Providence for activating or interacting with objects in the environment. Frequent cutscenes provide background information and advance the storyline.|$|E

5000|$|Four {{models of}} this signal exist. The one with 4 lamps {{is the most}} common. It has <b>a</b> steady red <b>arrow,</b> <b>a</b> steady yellow <b>arrow,</b> <b>a</b> {{flashing}} yellow <b>arrow,</b> and <b>a</b> steady green <b>arrow.</b> One rare version has five lenses, with <b>a</b> steady red <b>arrow,</b> two steady yellow <b>arrows,</b> <b>a</b> flashing yellow <b>arrow,</b> and <b>a</b> steady green <b>arrow,</b> and is only used sometimes, {{when there is a}} leading protected left turn. There are also two with 3 lamps. One signal has <b>a</b> steady red <b>arrow,</b> <b>a</b> steady yellow <b>arrow,</b> and <b>a</b> [...] "dual indication" [...] third lamp which can display either <b>a</b> steady green <b>arrow</b> or <b>a</b> flashing yellow <b>arrow.</b> The other 3-lamp signal has <b>a</b> steady red <b>arrow,</b> <b>a</b> steady yellow <b>arrow</b> and <b>a</b> flashing yellow <b>arrow,</b> with no green arrow; this can be used for either left or right turns, and is used to prevent yellow trap where no green arrow left turn phase exists on the approach. This cannot be done with the circular green without causing yellow trap, because a circular green releases other movements. The steady arrows all have their usual meanings. <b>A</b> flashing yellow <b>arrow</b> indicates <b>a</b> [...] "permitted" [...] left turn, where drivers may turn left without stopping (same as a Yield Sign), but opposing traffic has the right-of-way. The flashing yellow arrow must always be followed by either <b>a</b> steady yellow <b>arrow</b> or <b>a</b> steady green <b>arrow.</b>|$|R

5|$|Directional {{stability}} {{was achieved}} by four fixed vanes, two vertical and two horizontal, attached {{at the rear of}} the gas-bag, and by a long vertical vane running along the main axis of the gas-bag from the centre of the elliptical frame to its rear. Horizontal motion was controlled by the movement of a balanced rudder at the rear of an empennage on a long boom, mounted below the gas-bag and aft of the gondola (see lead image). The empennage consisted of vertical and horizontal vanes arranged like the fletching of <b>an</b> <b>arrow,</b> behind which the vertical rudder was mounted. During a refit in 1907 the vertical vanes of the empennage were modified, as is shown in the accompanying illustration.|$|E

5|$|Fire arrow: One of the {{earliest}} weaponized forms of gunpowder was the fire arrow which received {{its name from the}} translated Chinese term huǒjiàn (火箭), which literally means fire arrow. In China a 'fire arrow' referred to a gunpowder projectile consisting of a bag of incendiary gunpowder attached to the shaft of <b>an</b> <b>arrow</b> from the 9th century onward. Later on solid fuel rockets utilizing gunpowder were used to provide arrows with propulsive force and the term fire arrow became synonymous with rockets in the Chinese language. In other languages such as Sanskrit 'fire arrow' (agni astra) underwent a different semantic shift and became synonymous with 'cannon.' Fire arrows are the predecessors of fire lances, the first firearm.|$|E
