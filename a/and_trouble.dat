5|$|Over {{the next}} two years, Boycott {{appeared}} only intermittently in the Test team. A back injury forced him to miss half of the 1967 season, and an average of 32.40 against the Australians during the 1968 Ashes was unspectacular. Domestically, his injury also limited his contribution; however, he did hit five centuries before {{he was forced to}} stop playing in June 1968. Health problems with his spleen <b>and</b> <b>trouble</b> adjusting to wearing contact lenses meant that Boycott missed the tour of Pakistan in 1967–68, but he returned to the team by the summer of 1969, scoring 128 against the West Indies at Old Trafford, and another century at Lord's. However, he lost form {{in the rest of the}} season; he scored 12 and 0 in the third Test and averaged only 20.20, with two ducks, in the three Tests against New Zealand.|$|E

Cognitive and emotional symptoms include behavioral or mood changes, confusion, <b>and</b> <b>trouble</b> with memory, concentration, attention, or thinking.
