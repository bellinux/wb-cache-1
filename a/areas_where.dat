50|$|It {{is named}} Vastato because the <b>area</b> <b>where</b> {{it was built}} was outside {{the walls of the}} city, in an <b>area</b> <b>where</b> houses had been {{demolished}} (devastated) for defensive reasons. In Latin, vastinium referred to a safety belt within the protective bastions.|$|R
5|$|In Darwin's global hypothesis, vast <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> {{the seabed}} was being {{elevated}} {{were marked by}} fringing reefs, sometimes around active volcanoes, and similarly huge <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> the ocean floor was subsiding were indicated by barrier reefs or atolls based on inactive volcanoes. These views received general support from deep sea drilling results in the 1980s. His idea that rising land would be balanced by subsidence in ocean areas has been superseded by modern plate tectonics, {{which he did not}} anticipate.|$|E

5|$|The {{blackbuck}} inhabits grassy {{plains and}} slightly forested areas. Due to their regular need of water, they prefer <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> water is perennially available.|$|E
5|$|This is a monogamous {{territorial}} species, and in <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> it {{is fully}} migratory, the male re-establishes its breeding territory and starts singing {{as soon as}} he returns. In the milder <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> some birds stay year round, the resident male remains in his breeding territory, singing intermittently, but the female may establish a separate individual wintering range until pair formation begins in the early spring.|$|E

5|$|Ailanthus {{has been}} used to re-vegetate <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> acid mine {{drainage}} has occurred and it has been shown to tolerate pH levels as low as 4.1 (approximately that of tomato juice). It can withstand very low phosphorus levels and high salinity levels. The drought-tolerance of the tree is strong due to its ability to effectively store water in its root system. It is frequently found in <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> few trees can survive. The roots are also aggressive enough to cause damage to subterranean sewers and pipes. Along highways it often forms dense thickets in which few other tree species are present, largely due to the toxins it produces to prevent competition.|$|E

5|$|An {{automatic}} {{traffic monitoring}} and guidance {{system is in}} place along the motorway. It consists of measuring, control and signaling devices, located in zones where driving conditions may vary—at interchanges, near viaducts and bridges, and <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> fog is common. The system uses variable traffic signs to communicate driving conditions, possible restrictions and other information to motorists.|$|E

5|$|Butterflies {{navigate}} using a time-compensated sun compass. They can see {{polarized light}} and therefore orient even in cloudy conditions. The polarized light near the ultraviolet spectrum {{appears to be}} particularly important. Many migratory butterflies live in semi-arid <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> breeding seasons are short. The life histories of their host plants also influence butterfly behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Circumcision {{may be used}} {{to treat}} {{pathological}} phimosis, refractory balanoposthitis and chronic or recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). The World Health Organization promotes circumcision to prevent female-to-male HIV transmission in countries with high rates of HIV.
