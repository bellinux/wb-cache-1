40|$|Summary Social norms {{can reduce}} the costs of corrupt {{behavior}} and push a society toward a high-corruption equilibrium, but what determines individual attitudes toward corruption? How does acceptance vary across different types of corrupt behavior? An original survey of Kathmandu residents shows substantial variation in attitudes toward different types of corrupt behavior. Overall, respondents generally agreed that large-scale bribery was unacceptable, but there was relative discord over behaviors involving petty corruption, gift giving, and favoritism. Education consistently emerged as the primary determinant of these attitudes, with more educated respondents showing less accepting attitudes across the range of corrupt behaviors. These findings suggest that improving access to education in developing countries may reduce the presence of corruption norms and ultimately corruption itself, although {{further research is needed}} to test the strength of these relationships outside of Nepal.

But a fundamental lesson learned from Economics is that market design matters. Even small changes in market rules may lead to significantly different outcomes. Thus a good design, implementation, and validation of a market mechanism poses a big challenge to market engineers, which cannot be mastered without appropriate engineering approach accompanied by appropriate supporting tools. In this paper we describe the tools available {{in the area of}} Market Engineering and analyze their strengths and weaknesses. Also we propose a new approach towards building market mechanisms that offers market engineers a new degree of agility and freedom during the design and implementation phases. The new approach follows the principles of service-oriented architectures and agile model driven development. Furthermore, we present three different case studies where the new framework was successfully applied for the fast implementation of new electronic market platforms and we present results from a complexity analysis as well as from a preliminary technology <b>acceptance</b> <b>survey</b> among a small group of market engineers. 1...|$|E

In a socio-economic theme-based NPD, ranking a set of product prototypes that have been designed always requires the participation of multiple evaluators and consideration of multiple evaluation criteria. Using the well-being theme-based garment NPD as a background, this paper first presents a fuzzy hierarchical criteria group decision-making (FHCGDM) method which can effectively calculate final ranking results through fusing all assessment data from human beings and machines. It then presents a garment NPD comprehensive evaluation model with hierarchical criteria under the well-being theme through identifying a set of marketing tactics from a consumer <b>acceptance</b> <b>survey.</b> It further provides an establishment process for an NPD evaluation model under the digital ecosystem framework. Finally, a garment NPD case study further demonstrates the proposed well-being NPD comprehensive evaluation model and the FHCGDM method.

Logistic regression results suggest that neither structural nor ¯financial factors affect the desire for wanting (more) children. Concerning the fertility aspiration under the implementation of certain policy measures our results based on matching methods indicate that both structural and financial incentives would have an effect on thinking about having a(nother) child, on deciding to have a(nother) child, as well as on having the first/next child sooner. However, at parity zero financial incentives seemed to be more important, while at parity one especially structural incentives are the driven force of fertility aspirations. ...|$|E

To overcome methodological issues connected with the analysis of these influences, learning analytics were applied. Based on a recent vCoP model, the collaborative dialogue comprising 4040 interventions in 1981 messages created by a vCoP located at a US American online university was automatically analyzed. The text-based asynchronous online discussions were scored using a cohesion-based participation and collaboration analysis. Additionally, a sample of N = 133 vCoP participants responded a technology <b>acceptance</b> <b>survey.</b> Thus, a combined research model including the vCoP model and an established technology acceptance model was verified. The results confirmed the vCoP model entirely, and the acceptance model only partially. As consequence for educational research, the CoP model was confirmed and extended to vCoP settings, while the acceptance model appears to need reconsideration. For academic practice, the study initiates the development of assessment tools fostering knowledge sharing through dialogue in vCoP. Also, it suggests how virtual classrooms can be extended to open spaces where value creation takes place through social learning.

40|$|The Dissertation {{submitted}} to the Department of Management of Technology for the MBA in Management of TechnologySri-Lanka telecommunication sector consists of four licensed fixed line service providers and five mobile service providers. As per statistics published by Sri-Lanka Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (TRCSL), the mobile penetration level is reaching closer to 40 % of the population, and the competition in this sector is intensifying day by day due to increased adoption of technologies, mergers, acquisitions and new entrants. Dialog Telekom as the market leader is fighting an intense battle in a highly competitive environment and the company needs creative and innovative solutions to retain its market leadership position. In a highly competitive market with reducing voice revenue, new value added services are the key business drivers for new revenue streams and to sustain the competitive advantages. IP multimedia Subsystem (IMS) is becoming increasingly popular as the architecture of choice for delivering multimedia based new value added services and promises to deliver many strategic advantages to service providers to remain competitive in a highly dynamic and competitive environment. In light of the above, this research is focused on identifying strategic advantages of IMS to Dialog Telekom, user acceptance of IMS services, and potential barriers for implementation and finally formulating strategies {{for the implementation of}} IMS. The literature review revealed that IMS can deliver many strategic advantages such as new features, capital and operational expenditure reduction, reduced time to market for new features and converged service offering etc. The results of the user <b>acceptance</b> <b>survey</b> revealed that user acceptance of IMS related new value added services are at a high level. Further, it was revealed that worldwide, there are many ongoing IMS trials and early adopters of IMS claim that IMS would enable operators to rapidly create and introduce compelling new multimedia services that will drive up service revenues by reducing churn. Interview with senior management team revealed that Dialog Telekom has a positive attitude towards IMS, and it is the reason behind the recently concluded IMS trial. The interview with IMS trial implementation team provided an opportunity to identify potential barriers for implementation - issues related to technology, financial, regulatory, and marketing and human resources. HI The financial analysis revealed that long term benefits of IMS outweigh the cost of implementation, when IMS implementation is considered over a horizon of at least five years. Based on the feedback obtained from the user <b>acceptance</b> <b>survey,</b> literature survey, interview with Dialog Telekom staff and financial analysis, step wise implementation is recommended with a minimum initial investment, focusing on fixed domain first and subsequently on mobile domain. In the final stage it is recommended to focus on delivering converged services. The strategies for implementation were formulated based on the above approach. I...|$|E

40|$|This {{manuscript}} discusses {{different aspects}} {{that are relevant}} to genetically modified strawberry plants with improved characteristics and ‘acceptable’ to consumers and growers of strawberry. It starts with a consumer <b>acceptance</b> <b>survey,</b> held in Norway, Denmark and the UK, studying public perception of genetic modification in general and specifically of genetically modified strawberries with altered properties. This study revealed that genetically modified plants are better accepted by consumers if only genes from the species itself are used for the genetic modification. Subsequently, the results of a functional analysis of the strawberry polygalacturonase inhibiting protein gene (FaPGIP) are described. This indicates that this gene is a possible candidate to induce resistance to Botrytis cinerea when upregulated in strawberry fruits. For this analysis, the FaPGIP gene was overexpressed in transgenic strawberry plants using the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S (CaMV 35 S) promoter. This showed that FaPGIP overexpression led to resistance to Botrytis in transgenic leaves. For the generation of intragenic (i. e. genetically modification using native genetic elements only) strawberry plants, a transformation vector was constructed in which FaPGIP was combined with a strawberry fruit-specific promoter and terminator that were isolated from a strawberry expansin gene (FaExp 2). This vector also included elements that allow the elimination of (foreign) selectable marker genes after genetically modified plant lines have been established. Using this vector, genetically modified strawberry plants were produced that contained only genes from the species itself, and therefore these plants were called intragenic, rather than transgenic. Unfortunately, further evaluations of the intragenic strawberry plants could not demonstrate any enhanced level of resistance to Botrytis in fruits. © Global Science Book...|$|E
40|$|According to the National Crime Victimization Survey (2012), {{someone is}} sexually {{assaulted}} every two minutes. In {{a look at}} the current issues through a mediation model, the socialization that occurs within many conservative Christian contexts may facilitate the development of attitudes and beliefs that can affect women negatively. Patriarchal community structure and rigid gender role adherence place women in subordinate roles and maintain gender inequality. Within conservative, dogmatic contexts, comprehensive sex education and education about assault and abuse may be minimal, and rape myths are hypothesized to be more prevalent. In conservative environments, abstinence only sex education may leave young people unprepared to manage sexual interactions and engage in effective sexual communication. Not having the basic knowledge of sexual relations may leave women susceptible to unwanted sexual experiences. Recently, a local religious leader made public statements consistent with common rape mythology, which has raised concerns from professionals in the counseling profession regarding the messages young women are receiving from their religious leaders (Hatch, 2014). In the current study, acceptance of rape mythology and sexist beliefs were hypothesized to serve as a mediating pathway between dogmatic, religiously fundamentalist beliefs and experiences of sexual coercion and assault (both victimization and perpetration). Participants are male female students attending USU. Measures administered via an online survey include: The Sexual Experiences Survey, Religious Fundamentalism Scale, Attitudes Toward Women Scale, Ambivalent Sexism Survey, and the Illinois Rape Myth <b>Acceptance</b> <b>Survey,</b> as well as open ended questions addressing sexuality education experiences.

40|$|Even in the past, the {{protection}} of individual waters and river systems, as well as {{the protection}} of groundwater resources was already the subject of intense effort. The international commissions for {{the protection of}} the Rhine and the Bodensee lake were active in the thirties and laid the foundations for the analysis of sources of pollution and for the derivation of suitable measures to improve water quality and the ecological condition of the waters. The successful approaches towards whole river catchment area management are also decades old, as the example of the Tennessee Valley Authority shows. It became clear that the problem complexes associated with 'river catchment area management' could not be tackled with water-economic approaches alone. Management measures with a tightly focused target direction (e. g fisheries, water quality, water-economic or environmental protection aspects) are often inconsistent, as the inherent contradictions cannot be seen and taken into account: agricultural practice versus environmental protection and issues of drinking water quality, fishery management practices versus water quality issues, local versus regional and global protection targets. The development and assessment of management concepts for an economically and ecologically sustainable development of complete river systems and their coastal regions requires a co-ordinated bundelling of very varied activities which are aimed at the following areas: material outflow from landscapes (biotic and abiotic material transformation processes, nutrient balances, transportation, the ground as a filtering and buffering system), material transportation and transformation in coastal ecosystems (material spread, dynamic flat-water processes, biogeochemical processes), socio-economic factors of the material flows (<b>acceptance</b> <b>surveys,</b> cost-benefit analyses, community values systems, stakeholder analyses, scenario development), combining models and development of scaling rules (multi-block approaches, scenario calculations, forecasting instruments, data management).
