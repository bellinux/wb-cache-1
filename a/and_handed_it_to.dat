5|$|Ideal batting {{conditions}} and clear skies greeted {{the players on}} the second morning. Barnes batted assuredly, while Morris was hesitant and shuffled around the crease. At one stage, Morris scored only seven runs in 55 minutes. Barnes was involved in some interplay with umpire Chester when the latter stopped a drive from Morris with his foot. Barnes picked the ball off the wicket <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the bowler, prompting Chester to wag his finger in disapproval. Barnes responded by admonishing the umpire for blocking the ball.|$|E

25|$|Lemieux led the Penguins in {{the postseason}} and led in playoff scoring for much of it. His team {{surprised}} many {{by going to the}} Eastern Conference finals, knocking off the higher-seeded Washington Capitals and Buffalo Sabres along the way in six and seven games, respectively. The Penguins lost in five games to the top-seeded New Jersey Devils, as their players held Lemieux and Jágr without a goal that series. Lemieux finished Game Five in the penalty box after slashing the Devils' John Madden; afterwards Lemieux signed his stick <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> a young fan.|$|E

25|$|Diocletian and Maximian {{stepped down}} as co-emperors on May 1, 305, {{possibly}} due to Diocletian's poor health. Before the assembled armies at Milan, Maximian removed his purple cloak <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Severus, the new Caesar, and proclaimed Constantius as Augustus. The same scene played out at Nicomedia {{under the authority of}} Diocletian. Constantius, notionally the senior emperor, ruled the western provinces, while Galerius took the eastern provinces. Constantine, disappointed in his hopes to become a Caesar, fled the court of Galerius after Constantius had asked Galerius to release his son as Constantius was ill. Constantine joined his father's court at the coast of Gaul, just as he was preparing to campaign in Britain.|$|E
25|$|He {{remained}} an Aston Villa player, starting in a UEFA Cup tie against FH Hafnarfjordur, {{in which he}} scored in a 4–1 win. The goal against Hafnarfjordur was Barry's first European goal since he scored a penalty in the Intertoto Cup against Celta Vigo in 2000. On 18 September 2008, he made his 400th appearance in a Villa shirt in the UEFA Cup away to Litex Lovech, scoring a penalty as Villa won the match 3–1. Barry scored again for Villa as they beat Ajax 2–1 in their first UEFA Cup group match on 23 October 2008. Owing to the transfer saga, O'Neill had taken the captaincy away from him <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> centre-back Martin Laursen for the 2008–09 season. Following Laursen's injury, the captaincy was restored to Barry in January 2009. In total, he made 441 appearances for Aston Villa, scoring 52 goals in the process.|$|E

25|$|On {{the weekend}} of March 1–2, 1992, Mayor Daley and wife Maggie {{attended}} a family party in New York, and 16-year-old Patrick was to stay with relatives. Patrick told the relatives he was staying with friends and drove his father's new sports utility vehicle to the Daley second home in Grand Beach, Michigan and threw a party Saturday night. Patrick fetched former Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley's 20-gauge double-barrel shotgun from the Daley home <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> his cousin, R. J. Vanecko, 17. Vanecko aimed the shotgun at teenagers, pulled the trigger twice and yelled {{that he was not}} afraid to use the weapon. A youth threw a concrete goose lawn ornament through the windshield of Mayor Daley's truck, and Patrick punched him. A youth was seriously injured when struck {{in the head with a}} baseball bat wielded by a juvenile, was hospitalized in critical condition, underwent surgery to remove a blood clot on his brain and spent three days in intensive care.|$|E
25|$|Psychosis {{originally}} {{lost his}} mask to Rey Misterio Sr. during {{a tour of}} Mexico, as he removed the mask <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Mysterio Jr. while simultaneously covering {{his face with a}} towel. He also lost the mask to Billy Kidman on the September 27 episode of Nitro, revealing his face to the American audience. On occasion, he was also paired with Juventud Guerrera, and when the later won the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Title, Guerrera was kayfabe injured and had Psychosis defend the title. In reality, Guerrera and Jerry Flynn were arrested on DUI charges; Psychosis immediately lost the belt to previous champion Jushin Thunder Liger. Neither Juventud Guerrera's championship win nor Psicosis' title defense was recognized by New Japan Pro Wrestling until 2007. Psychosis had a second Cruiserweight title reign in WCW shortly after unmasking, when the previous champion Lenny Lane, who portrayed a flamboyant homosexual on television, got WCW in trouble with GLAAD. As a result, Lane was pulled from television and Psychosis was given the belt to defend. The WCW announcers claimed that he had won it at a house show. However, on his first televised appearance with the title, Psychosis lost it to Disco Inferno. This earned him the dubious distinction of having lost two titles he never won.|$|E

[...] Monteagle's servant, Thomas Ward, had family connections with the Wright brothers, and {{sent a message to}} Catesby about the betrayal. [...] Catesby, who had been due to go hunting with the King, suspected that Tresham was responsible for the letter, and with Thomas Wintour confronted the recently recruited conspirator. [...] Tresham managed to convince the pair that he had not written the letter, but urged them to abandon the plot. [...] Salisbury was already aware of certain stirrings before he received the letter, but did not yet know the exact nature of the plot, or who exactly was involved. [...] He therefore elected to wait, to see how events unfolded.|$|E
500|$|London {{suffered}} severely from Viking {{attacks and}} was several times occupied by Viking armies. In 886 Alfred took possession of London, {{and according to}} Asser he [...] "restored" [...] the city and [...] "made it habitable again". He then handed control to Æthelred. Historians, however, disagree about the circumstances. According to Frank Stenton, Alfred recovered London by force from the Vikings <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Æthelred because it had previously been a Mercian town, and he respected the traditions of other kingdoms. Marios Costambeys takes a similar view, arguing that Alfred's decision was {{probably due to the}} need to maintain unity among the English who were outside Viking territory. Alfred Smyth suggests that the Chronicle's account reflects bias in Alfred's favour, and that Æthelred took charge because he had a greater role in London's recovery than the West Saxon chronicler was willing to admit. Some versions of the Chronicle state that Alfred besieged London in 883, and Simon Keynes argues that Alfred probably took London at that time and that the [...] "occupation" [...] in 886 may have been a restoration of London's defences following Viking attacks close to the city in 885.|$|E

500|$|During {{a typical}} Polish {{coronation}} ceremony {{in the times}} of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the king-elect received Szczerbiec after his anointment and before being crowned and enthroned. The primate of Poland, that is the archbishop of Gniezno, picked up the unsheathed sword from the altar <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the kneeling king. At the same time, he recited a formula which asked the monarch to use the sword to rule justly, defend the Church, fight evil, protect widows and orphans, and to [...] "rebuild what is damaged, maintain what is rebuilt, avenge what is unjust, reinforce what is well managed," [...] etc. Then, the king handed the sword to the Crown sword-bearer (miecznik koronny), who slid it into the scabbard and {{passed on to the}} primate. The primate, aided by the Crown and Lithuanian sword-bearers, fastened the scabbard to the king's belt. The king stood up and, facing onlookers, withdrew Szczerbiec, made three times {{the sign of the cross}} with it, and wiped it against his left arm before replacing it in the scabbard. The king's sword-wielding abilities were closely watched by his new subjects during this part of the ritual. When Augustus III betrayed his poor fencing skills at his coronation, nobles joked that they were going to have [...] "a peaceful lord". After Szczerbiec, a bishop handed the sovereign the Grunwald Swords symbolizing the monarch's reign over the two constituent nations of the Commonwealth.|$|E
