40|$|Purpose: In the EC-funded project RENEB (Realizing the European Network in Biodosimetry), {{physical}} methods {{applied to}} fortuitous dosimetric materials {{are used to}} complement biological dosimetry, to increase dose assessment capacity for large-scale radiation/nuclear accidents. This paper describes the work performed to implement Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) dosimetry techniques. Materials and methods: OSL is applied to electronic components and EPR to touch-screen glass from mobile phones. To implement these new approaches, several blind tests and inter-laboratory comparisons (ILC) were organized for each assay. Results: OSL systems have shown good performances. EPR systems also show good performance in controlled conditions, but ILC have also demonstrated that post-irradiation exposure to sunlight increases {{the complexity of the}} EPR signal analysis. Conclusions: Physically-based dosimetry techniques present high capacity, new possibilities for <b>accident</b> <b>dosimetry,</b> {{especially in the case of}} large-scale events. Some of the techniques applied can be considered as operational (e. g. OSL on Surface Mounting Devices [SMD]) and provide a large increase of measurement capacity for existing networks. Other techniques and devices currently undergoing validation or development in Europe could lead to considerable increases in the capacity of the RENEB <b>accident</b> <b>dosimetry</b> network...|$|E

In such a situation, emergency mass triage will be required. In this context, it has been shown that Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy would be a rapid and sensitive method, on the field deployable system, allowing dose evaluation of a great number of people in a short time period. This methodology uses tooth enamel as a natural dosimeter. Ionising radiations create stable free radicals in the enamel, in a dose dependent manner, which can be detected by EPR directly in the mouth with an appropriate resonator. Teeth are often subject to restorations, currently made of synthetic dimethacrylate-based photopolymerizable composites. It is known that some dental composites give an EPR signal which is likely to interfere with the dosimetric signal from the enamel. So far, no information was available about the occurrence of this signal in the various composites available on the market, the magnitude of the signal compared to the dosimetric signal, nor its evolution with time. In this study, we conducted a systematic characterization of the signal (intensity, kinetics, interference with dosimetric signal) on 19 most widely used composites for tooth restoration, and on 14 experimental resins made with the most characteristic monomers found in commercial composites. Although a strong EPR signal was observed in every material, a rapid decay of the signal was noted.

40|$|The human tooth {{has been}} used for dose {{estimation}} at Hiroshima and Nagasaki or <b>accident</b> <b>dosimetry</b> by the technique of electron spin resonance at room temperature or liquid nitrogen temperature. Thermoluminescence technique was also applied to the tooth enamels, but chemiluminescence and the stench from them at high temperature make the TL technique impracticable to use as a dosimeter. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), which has been developed in the last two decades, is a phenomenon at relatively low temperature. In this study, the OSL from a dentin and an enamel separated from a human tooth is observed, and its potential as a dosimeter is discussed. Infra-red stimulated luminescence (IRSL) was observed both for the dentin and enamel, but blue-light stimulated luminescence (BLSL) was observed only for the enamel. The dose dependences was observed for the IRSL and BLSL from the dentin and enamel employing the single aliquot technique. It was found that luminescence of the dentin and enamel show supralinear dose response. BLSL of the enamel caused the fading of ca. 10 %, but the BLSL of the dentin shows no fading.

40|$|During {{calendar}} year (CY) 1999, the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) performed its customary radiological protection support services {{in support of}} the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Richland Operations Office (RL) and the Hanford contractors. These services included: (1) external dosimetry, (2) internal dosimetry, (3) in vivo measurements, (4) radiological records, (5) instrument calibration and evaluation, and (6) calibration of radiation sources traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The services were provided under a number of programs as summarized here. Along with providing site-wide nuclear <b>accident</b> and environmental <b>dosimetry</b> capabilities, the Hanford External Dosimetry Program (HEDP) supports Hanford radiation protection programs by providing external radiation monitoring capabilities for all Hanford workers and visitors to help ensure their health and safety. Processing volumes decreased in CY 1999 relative to prior years for all types of dosimeters, with an overall decrease of 19 %. During 1999, the HEDP passed the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) performance testing criteria in 15 different categories. HEDP computers and processors were tested and upgraded to become Year 2000 (Y 2 K) compliant. Several changes and improvements were made to enhance the interpretation of dosimeter results. The Hanford Internal Dosimetry Program (HIDP) provides for the assessment and documentation of occupational dose from intakes of radionuclides at the Hanford Site. Performance problems carried over from CY 1998 continued to plague the in vitro bioassay contractor. A new contract was awarded for the in vitro bioassay program. A new computer system was put into routine operation by the in vivo bioassay program. Several changes to HIDP protocols were made that were related to bioassay grace periods, using field data to characterize the amount of alpha activity present and using a new default particle size. The number of incidents and high routine investigations that required follow-up were lower compared with 1998. Also, the number of excreta analyses performed decreased compared with CY 1998. The In Vivo Monitoring Program for Hanford (formerly the Hanford Whole Body Counting Project) provides the in vivo counting services for Hanford Site radiation workers. New computer hardware and software were put into routine operation to acquire, analyze, and store the measurement data. The technical procedures were revamped to reflect operational changes implemented with the new computer system. The U. S. Department of Energy Laboratory Accreditation Program (DOELAP) accreditation was extended to include two additional categories. New detectors were purchased for wound counting applications. The 8, 085 in vivo measurements performed in 1999 represent a 2 % decrease from 1998. Several high-purity germanium detectors were repaired at the In Vivo Radioassay and Research Facility, thereby saving out-of-service time and money compared with returning the detectors to the vendor.

40|$|In July 1995, LANL hosted an <b>accident</b> <b>dosimetry</b> intercomparison. When all {{reactors}} on the Oak Ridge Reservation were idled in 1988, the Health Physics Research Reactor (HPRR), {{which had}} been used for 22 previous intercomparisons dating from 1965, was shut down for an indefinite period. The LANL group began characterization of two critical assemblies for dosimetry purposes. As a result, NAD- 23 was conceived and 10 DOE facilities accepted invitations {{to participate in the}} intercomparison. This report is a summary of the performance of one of the participants, the Centralized External Dosimetry System (CEDS). The CEDS is a cooperative personnel dosimetry arrangement between three DOE sites in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Many successes and failures are reported herein. Generally, the TL dosimeters performed poorly and always over-reported the delivered dose. The TLD processing procedures contain efforts that would lead to large biases in the reported absorbed dose, and omit several key steps in the TLD reading process. The supralinear behavior of lithium fluoride (LiF) has not been characterized for this particular dosimeter and application (i. e., in high-dose mixed neutron/gamma fields). The use of TLD materials may also be precluded given the limitations of the LiF material itself, the TLD reading system, and the upper dose level to which <b>accident</b> <b>dosimetry</b> systems are required to perform as set forth in DOE regulations. The indium foil results confirm the expected inability of that material to predict the magnitude of the wearer`s dose reliably, although it is quite suitable as a quick-sort material. Biological sample (hair) results were above the minimum detectable activity (MDA) for only one of the tests. Several questions as to the best methods for sample handling and processing remain...|$|E
40|$|Two {{critical}} assemblies {{have been}} characterized at the Los Alamos Critical Experiments Facility (LACEF) {{for use in}} testing nuclear accident dosimeters and related devices. These device, Godiva IV and SHEBA II, have very different characteristics in both operation and emitted neutron energy spectra. The Godiva assembly is a bare metal fast burst device with a hard spectrum. This spectrum can be modified by use of several shields including steel, concrete, and plexiglas. The modified spectra vary in both average neutron energy and in the specific distribution of the neutron energies in the intermediate energy range. This makes for a very favorable test arrangement as the response ratios between different activation foils used in accident dosimeters are significantly altered such as the ratio between gold, copper, and sulfur elements. The SHEBA device is a solution assembly which has both a slow ramp and decay period and a much softer spectrum. The uncertainly introduced in the response of fast decay foils such as indium can therefore be evaluated into the test results. The neutron energy spectrum for each configuration was measured during low power operations with a multisphere system. These measurements were extended to high dose pulsed operation by use of TLDs moderated TLDs, and special activation techniques. The assemblies {{were used in the}} testing of several <b>accident</b> <b>dosimetry</b> devices in studies modeled after the Nuclear <b>Accident</b> <b>Dosimetry</b> Studies that were conducted at Oak Ridge National Laboratory for about 25 years using the Health Physics Research Reactor.

40|$|The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory uses neutron {{activation}} {{elements in a}} Panasonic TLD holder as a personnel nuclear accident dosimeter (PNAD). The LLNL PNAD has periodically been tested using a Cf- 252 neutron source, however until 2009, {{it was more than}} 25 years since the PNAD has been tested against a source of neutrons that arise from a reactor generated neutron spectrum that simulates a criticality. In October 2009, LLNL participated in an intercomparison of nuclear accident dosimeters at the CEA Valduc Silene reactor (Hickman, et. al. 2010). In September 2010, LLNL participated in a second intercomparison of nuclear accident dosimeters at CEA Valduc. The reactor generated neutron irradiations for the 2010 exercise were performed at the Caliban reactor. The Caliban results are described in this report. The procedure for measuring the nuclear accident dosimeters {{in the event of an}} accident has a solid foundation based on many experimental results and comparisons. The entire process, from receiving the activated NADs to collecting and storing them after counting was executed successfully in a field based operation. Under normal conditions at LLNL, detectors are ready and available 24 / 7 to perform the necessary measurement of nuclear accident components. Likewise LLNL maintains processing laboratories that are separated from the areas where measurements occur, but contained within the same facility for easy movement from processing area to measurement area. In the event of a loss of LLNL permanent facilities, the Caliban and previous Silene exercises have demonstrated that LLNL can establish field operations that will very good nuclear <b>accident</b> <b>dosimetry</b> results. There are still several aspects of LLNL's nuclear <b>accident</b> <b>dosimetry</b> program that have not been tested or confirmed. For instance, LLNL's method for using of biological samples (blood and hair) has not been verified since the method was first developed in the 1980 's. Because LLNL and the other DOE participants were limited in what they were allowed to do at the Caliban and Silene exercises and testing of various elements of the nuclear <b>accident</b> <b>dosimetry</b> programs cannot always be performed as guests at other sites, it has become evident that DOE needs its own capability to test nuclear accident dosimeters. Angular dependence determination and correction factors for NADs desperately need testing as well as more evaluation regarding the correct determination of gamma doses. It will be critical to properly design any testing facility so that the necessary experiments can be performed by DOE laboratories as well as guest laboratories. Alternate methods of dose assessment such as using various metals commonly found in pockets and clothing have yet to be evaluated. The DOE is planning to utilize the Godiva or Flattop reactor for testing nuclear accident dosimeters. LLNL has been assigned the primary operational authority for such testing. Proper testing of nuclear accident dosimeters will require highly specific characterization of the pulse fields. Just as important as the characterization of the pulsed fields will be the design of facilities used to process the NADs. Appropriate facilities will be needed to allow for early access to dosimeters to test and develop quick sorting techniques. These facilities will need appropriate laboratory preparation space and an area for measurements. Finally, such a facility will allow greater numbers of LLNL and DOE laboratory personnel to train on the processing and interpretation of nuclear accident dosimeters and results. Until this facility is fully operational for test purposes, DOE laboratories may need to continue periodic testing as guests of other reactor facilities such as Silene and Caliban...|$|E

The system is based on gels containing emulsions of superheated dichlorodifluoromethane droplets, which vaporise into bubbles upon neutron irradiation.

Instant read-out is achieved using an array of transmissive optical sensors which consist of coupled LED emitters and phototransistor receivers. When the gel displaced in the pipette crosses the sensing region of the photomicrosensors, it generates a signal collected on a computer through a dedicated acquisition board.

EPR measurements in finger- and toenail have been considered for <b>accident</b> <b>dosimetry</b> for a long time. Human nails are very attractive biophysical materials because they are easy to collect and pertinent to whole body irradiation. Information on the existence of a radiation-induced signal in human nails has been reported almost 25  years ago. However, no practical application of EPR dosimetry on nails is known to date because, from an EPR perspective, nails represent a very complex material. In addition to the radiation-induced signal (RIS), parasitic and intense signals are induced by the mechanical stress caused when collecting nail samples (mechanically induced signals-MIS). Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the RIS stability is strongly influenced not only by temperature but also by humidity. Most studies of human nails were carried out using conventional X-band microwave band (9  GHz). Higher frequency Q-band (37  GHz) provides higher spectral resolution which allows obtaining more detailed information on the nature of different radicals in human nails. Here, we present {{for the first time a}} complete description of the different EPR signals identified in nails including parasitic, intrinsic and RIS. EPR in both X- and Q-bands was used. Four different MIS signals and five different signals specific to irradiation with ionizing radiation have been identified. The most important outcome of this work is the identification of a stable RIS component. In contrast with other identified (unstable) RIS components, this component is thermally and time stable and not affected by the physical contact of fingernails with water. A detailed description of this signal is provided here. The discovery of stable radiation-induced radical(s) associated with the RIS component mentioned opens a way for broad application of EPR dosimetry in human nails. Consequently, several recent dosimetry assessments of real accident cases have been performed based on the described measurements and analyses of this component...|$|E
40|$|Recent silver-activated glass {{dosimeters}} {{are superior}} to photographic film and thermoluminescent dosimeters for many reasons described briefly, especially in high-level <b>accident</b> <b>dosimetry,</b> because fast dose evaluation {{and the possibility of}} remeasuring doubtful values are necessary. A main disadvantage of glass dosimeters is possible changes in the fluorimetric or in the photometric dose reading between exposure and evaluation. These changes have to be considered if exact dose readings are desired, UV irradiation can induce or destroy radiation-induced fluorescence and colour centres in the glass, depending on the quantum energy of the UV light. More important, in practice, is the increase of the measured RPL immediately after exposure, superimposed later by the fading process. Increase and decrease rates depend strongly on the storage temperature and the composition of the glass. For instance, the increase after exposure decreases with increasing si!ver concentration in a glass with constant basic composition, and fading occurs earlier. At constant silver concentration there is also an effect of different glass base compositions. There are no observable differences in the kinetics of X-ray, γ-ray and thermal neutron effects in the glass. In the 10 ^- 4 to ^ 3 r γ dose range (fluorimetric dose reading) the kinetic behaviour of the RPL centres determines this effect, while in the 10 ^ 3 to 10 ^ 7 r dose range the somewhat different stability of the absorption centres is important if absorption measurements are taken (the fading depends on the wavelength of the photometric measurement and is lowest at the 320 nm absorption band), If fluorimetric measurements are also taken, the superimposing effects determine the dose reading because of the UV absorption in the glass at the fluorimetric: reading. A brief theoretical interpretation of the kinetics in irradiated glass is given by means of a simplified band model of the physical processes involved. A general expression, for the possible radiation effect alterations is given, After a high-dose exposure the glass can be regenerated by a special heat treatmem. Too extended heating or too high temperatures may increase the predose, In practice the possible inaccuracies in the dose measurement can be overcome by: (a) A short heat treatment of the glass stabilization or "development" of the radiation effect); or (b) The use of the correction curves given in the paper. The UV-induced RPL behaves somewhat differently...|$|E
40|$|The {{likelihood}} of {{the occurrence of}} radiological accidents which can induce significant health consequences {{to the members of}} the public has raised the importance of developing a personal radiation dosimetry system applicable to populations not monitored by dedicated dosemeters. Mobile phones are personal devices with high ubiquity and great potential for <b>accident</b> <b>dosimetry</b> applications. Alumina surface mount resistors (SMRs) are abundant in the printed circuit board of mobile phones and their potential as fortuitous dosemeters has been investigated using thermoluminescence (TL) and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) techniques. The physical mechanism of the generation of luminescence of the alumina SMRs is, however, less known. The basic luminescence defects in SMRs were identified to be F-type centres and their emission process was shown to be temperature dependent and highly quenched at room temperature (RT). The trap environment of beta irradiated SMRs includes a series of closely spaced traps covering thermal depths between 0. 9 - 1. 4 eV; predicting an average lifetime for thermal fading at RT of ca 23 years. Trapped charges evicted by thermal or optical stimulation are likely to recombine at F-type centres and contribute to the luminescence response that is likely to be thermally assisted via the vibrational modes of the lattice. A phonon-assisted de-excitation of the trapped charge population could additionally be involved in the mechanism of athermal or anomalous fading. Based on the temperature dependence of the rate of fading, a model is presented for the anomalous fading observed where phonon-assisted and tunnelling effects alternate or operate simultaneously depending on the temperature of the material. A number of aspects related to the use of SMRs in dosimetry seem to benefit from the investigation of the physical processes, although for accurate dose reconstruction it is imperative to know the energy of the ionising radiation source and the position of the mobile phone relative to the direction of the source. For example, at low-energy exposures the dose may be over-estimated, not only due to the non-flat energy response of the alumina, but also due to the presence of several parts of the mobile phone which can increase the amount of energy deposited in alumina substrates due to backscatter effects. In addition, MCNP simulations indicated that for low-energy exposures, such as for 192 Ir, differences of up to an order-of-magnitude between resistor and whole body dose are expected. Finally, to specify the most appropriate dose conversion coefficients that can be applied to estimate whole body dose from OSL / TL determinations, the knowledge of the exposure geometry is crucial...|$|E
