5|$|This is {{followed}} with Spears performing a dance routine inside a blacklight paint graffiti room, {{and the two}} women dancing around a metal bedframe. Spears then begins chasing Madonna in a wooden-like maze, and the latter enters a room covered with fallen leaves and stands in a swing. Once Spears finds the room, Madonna {{is nowhere to be}} found. Throughout the video, Madonna gradually loses her symbolic power, paralleled by her disposing the cane and jacket, becoming less phallic and more noticeably female biologically and more feminine socially. Although it ultimately seems that Spears becomes the dominant figure, Madonna recovers her phallic power {{in the form of a}} cigar from an onlooking male. Spears appears in Madonna's room and throws her <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>and</b> Madonna vanishes just as they are about to kiss. The video ends as Madonna's laugh is heard in the background.|$|E
5|$|Victoria was, however, less {{enthusiastic}} about fulfilling her public role. She avoided answering letters, put off visits to elderly relations whose company {{she did not}} enjoy, and talked to people who amused her at official functions while ignoring people of higher standing whom she found boring. Victoria's inattention to her duties provoked quarrels with Ernst. The young couple had loud, physical fights. The volatile Victoria shouted, threw tea trays, smashed china <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>and</b> tossed anything that was handy at Ernst during their arguments. Victoria sought relief in her love for horses and long gallops over the countryside on a hard-to-control stallion named Bogdan. While she was in Russia for the coronation of Tsar Nicholas II, Victoria's affection for Kirill was also rekindled. She enjoyed flirting {{with him at the}} balls and celebrations that marked the coronation.|$|E
5|$|The {{cases that}} were known in West Berlin {{provoked}} demonstrations among the population. Members of the Senate inspected the crime scenes {{and spoke to}} the press as well as public audiences. Various groups, and also individuals, launched protest campaigns <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> <b>and</b> the shootings. The fact that Peter Fechter bled to death in plain view of the public without anybody being able to help him lead to spontaneous mass demonstrations, which in turn resulted in riots in the following night. West Berlin policemen and US soldiers prevented a storming of the Wall. Buses bringing Soviet soldiers to the Tiergarten where they were to guard the Soviet War Memorial were pelted with stones by protesters. The incident also lead to anti-American protests, which were condemned by Willy Brandt. In the ensuing time, loudspeaker cars were sporadically set up at the Wall, urging the GDR border guards not to shoot at refugees and warning them of possible consequences. As a result of the shootings, West German groups lodged complaints with the UN Commission on Human Rights. The non-partisan Kuratorium Unteilbares Deutschland (Committee for an Indivisible Germany) sold protest placards and lapel pins in all of West Germany against the border regime and its consequences. Initially, West Berlin's regulatory authorities gave fugitives covering fire if they were being fired at by GDR border guards. This resulted in at least one lethal incident on 23 May 1962, when the border guard Peter Göring was shot dead by a West Berlin policeman while firing 44 times at a fleeing boy.|$|E

Finally at Reesong Palace, Zelda fights Ganon, incapacitates him with the Wand, and rescues her father. Back at Hyrule Castle, Duke Onkled is {{turned over to the}} king, begging for mercy. He is arrested and the King orders him to scrub all the floors in Hyrule as punishment. Although Link's whereabouts are still unknown, a comment by Lady Alma prompts Zelda to throw her mirror <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>and</b> as it smashes, Link magically materializes, seemingly having been trapped in the mirror. They then start laughing because they're happy that all is well again.|$|E
25|$|Several factors {{led to the}} end of {{the civil}} war. First, Guinean {{cross-border}} bombing raids against villages believed to be bases used by the RUF working in conjunction with Guinean dissidents were very effective in routing the rebels. Another factor encouraging a less combative RUF was a new UN resolution that demanded that the government of Liberia expel all RUF members, end their financial support of the RUF, and halt the illicit diamond trade. Finally, the Kamajors, feeling less threatened now that the RUF was disintegrating in the face of a robust opponent, failed to incite violence like they had done in the past. With their backs <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> without any international support, the RUF forces signed a new peace treaty within a matter of weeks.|$|E
25|$|The World Series in 1991 is {{regarded}} {{by many as}} one of the classics of all time. In this Series, four games were won during the teams' final at-bat, and three of these were in extra innings. The Atlanta Braves won all three of their games in Atlanta, and the Twins won all four of their games in Minnesota. The sixth game was a legendary one for Puckett, who tripled in a run, made a sensational leaping catch <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>and</b> finally in the 11th inning hit the game-winning home run. The seventh game was tied 0–0 after the regulation nine innings, and marked only the second time that the seventh game of the World Series had ever gone into extra innings. The Twins won on a walk-off RBI single by Gene Larkin {{in the bottom of the}} 10th inning, after Morris had pitched ten shutout innings against the Braves. The seventh game of the 1991 World Series is widely regarded {{as one of the}} greatest games in the history of professional baseball.|$|E

25|$|There {{have long}} been tales of hauntings at The Grotto, mainly {{relating}} to a smuggler named John the Jibber who was reputedly murdered by his fellow criminals after selling information to HM Customs. It is {{said that he was}} hung in a barrel in a cave close to the present lift shaft and left to starve. Until the pub was sold by Vaux, it was said that the landlord would leave out a special tankard of ale each night after closing and, in the morning, it would be empty. Local DJ and TV presenter, Alan Robson drank from the tankard during one of his live Metro Radio shows, allegedly sparking off a series of supernatural phenomena that eventually forced the then landlord to quit. This included flying ashtrays smashing <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> flooding in the cellar after all the beer taps were inexplicably turned on. Unfortunately the original tankard was lost during refurbishment. A replacement is on display, but is no longer filled up each night for the ghost. The pub was also the venue for a uktv investigation in 2001, where paranormal researchers claimed to have identified at least seven different spirits.|$|E

500|$|Too sick to {{participate}} in the battle, Bowie likely died in bed. Eyewitnesses to the battle gave conflicting accounts of his death. Some witnesses maintained that they saw several Mexican soldiers enter Bowie's room, bayonet him, and carry him alive from the room. Others claimed that Bowie shot himself or was killed by soldiers while too weak to lift his head. According to historian Wallace Chariton, the [...] "most popular, and probably the most accurate" [...] version is that Bowie died on his cot, [...] "back braced <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>and</b> using his pistols and his famous knife." ...|$|E

[...] Ed Liu of Toon Zone feels it is [...] "truly puzzling what Perry the secret agent is doing in this show in the first place." [...] Liu considers his subplot to be a type of [...] "throw everything <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> see what sticks" [...] element and writes that [...] "many of the earlier episodes of the show don't manage to do a very good job of balancing the subplot and the main one." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{flashback}} episode [...] "What Lies Beneath", exploring Faye's {{decision to}} move to Holby, she is seen to fight with her husband James, then later step over his dead body on the stairs. Kensit explained: [...] "there's a scuffle and he pins her <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> practically tries to rape her. He ends up dead. It's the way she deals with it — she coolly steps over his body and leaves. It turns out similar things have happened before." [...] Shortly after arriving in Holby, the character began a relationship with cardiothoracic registrar Sam Strachan (Tom Chambers). The situation soon escalated into a love triangle, with Sam reigniting his former relationship with Faye's colleague, Matron Chrissie Williams. Kensit said of the relationship in August 2007, as the storyline was ongoing: [...] "For Faye, Sam is not Mr Right, simply Mr Right Now. But Faye is not as sweet as she looks - there's a streak of toughness there... It's all going to get very messy!" [...] Upon discovering Sam's infidelity, the character terminated their relationship, and became involved with his colleague Joseph Byrne.|$|E
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Early Winter" [...] {{was directed by}} Stefani's frequent collaborator Sophie Muller, who had previously directed the music videos of [...] "Cool" [...] and [...] "Wind It Up". Filming of the music video took place at destinations like Budapest, Milan, and Prague, where Stefani had been touring during The Sweet Escape Tour in October 2007. It opens with a black-and-white scene of Stefani {{lying on the ground}} in a long white gown. In the next scene, Stefani is shown walking on the street under red street lights and then holds her love interest, played by her tour backup dancer Steelo Vazquez, <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> talks to him. The scene then changes to Stefani walking on a street and later walking into the railway station. In the next scene, Stefani is seen singing under falling red-coloured feathers in a huge palace-type hall. Scenes of Stefani staring {{at herself in the mirror}} with her hair up and snow falling slowly down, with the lights turning on and off intermittently, are interspersed throughout the video. Stefani is also seen sitting on the ground and singing while crying. She is then shown at a railway station walking besides a moving train. The video ends with Stefani running out of the hall. Tamar Anitai from MTV Buzzworthy praised the video for being [...] "acutely artful, immeasurably stylish" [...] and commented that [...] "Gwen’s managed to raise the bar on her own superlatively supreme style in her new video." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{official}} {{music video}} for [...] "Lemme See" [...] {{was released on}} June 14, 2012, and was directed by Philip Andelman. The video opens with a close-up of Usher's estate, and a woman bound by ropes. Usher is stood by a swimming pool singing the first verse, with the pool reflecting on him. During the pre-chorus, Usher is leaning against a wall while pulling up his top to reveal his chest. Entering the chorus, the video intercuts to Usher preparing drinks for himself and the tied up woman– his love interest. With the second verse, Usher is admiring his still tied up love interest. In the second pre-chorus, leaned against a wall Usher removes his shirt, while the video intercuts to him approaching his love interest to make love. Entering Rick Ross' verse, Ross is sat down shirtless, accompanied by two women sat by him left and right. Touching Ross' back, their tattoos transfer on to Ross and bloom. Him and Usher are both by a pool with Ross performing his rap, while in an intercut scene Usher's love interest is being released from her tied up predicament. In the final chorus, Usher and his love interest make love in a risqué scene, with both their tattoos moving and blooming on {{to each other in}} a similar way to Ross' scene. This alternates with the latter scene, Usher leaned <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> him and Ross by the pool, with Usher singing the verse. The video ends with Ross and Usher echoing the song's title.|$|E
500|$|When Bowie's {{mother was}} {{informed}} of his death, she calmly stated, [...] "I'll wager no wounds {{were found in}} his back." [...] Various eyewitnesses to the battle gave conflicting accounts of Bowie's death. A newspaper article claimed that a Mexican soldier saw Bowie carried from his room on his cot, alive, after {{the conclusion of the}} battle. The soldier maintained that Bowie verbally castigated a Mexican officer in fluent Spanish, and the officer ordered Bowie's tongue cut out and his still-breathing body thrown onto the funeral pyre. This account has been disputed by numerous other witnesses, and it is thought to have been invented by the reporter. Other witnesses maintained that they saw several Mexican soldiers enter Bowie's room, bayonet him, and carry him, alive, from the room. Various other stories circulated, with some witnesses claiming that Bowie shot himself and others saying he was killed by soldiers while too weak to lift his head. Alcalde Ruiz said that Bowie was found [...] "dead in his bed."

500|$|The video {{begins in}} a room with a man named Fuzz (Polow da Don) telling B.B. (Hilson) and her gun-slinging women crew {{consisting}} of Boots (JoJo), Danja (Evans), and Money (Dawn Richard) about bringing in Hilson's boyfriend into custody. After Hilson assures Jammal that she can handle it, the song begins and Hilson are seen wearing outfits of black bikinis as they dance seductively to the song's chorus and verse. Meanwhile, Hilson and her crew are back in the room preparing themselves with scenes of Hilson grinding against a large vault door. As the song moves to the pre-chorus, Hilson and her crew are shown at a party, mingling with the male guests and handing them drinks. As Ross' verse begins, he, Short and da Don are shown at the party as Hilson's crew grind themselves around them and Hilson kisses Short's head. The song pauses and Hilson and her crew move into a room with Polow da Don, Short, and Ross sitting in chair with other men in the background. Unexpectedly, her crew all pull out their guns. Short (who {{has turned out to be}} Hilson's target) is able to respond almost immediately by having his men pull out their guns. Seeing they are evenly matched, Short agrees to let Hilson take him into custody, with Hilson removing her top and locking them both in handcuffs. The two walk upstairs, where Short pushes Hilson <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> they kiss on the stairway. The video ends with Short following Hilson upstairs while the words [...] "To be continued..." [...] appear on the screen.|$|E

500|$|Similar to , Metallica {{presents}} {{songs from}} Metallica's history roughly in chronological order, but it focuses {{more on the}} group today than the band's history. [...] The songs in the game are presented in a linear series of sets as with older Guitar Hero games such as Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock, instead of the gig progression used in World Tour. [...] However, instead of being required to finish {{a certain number of}} songs in each set, the player has to earn a total number of stars (earned from their performance on the individual songs) in a given set to progress to next one. The game's story is based on a band that wants to follow in Metallica's footsteps, and the group accepting them as leading acts for them on a tour; as such, they are better able to order the songs in difficulty comparable to other Guitar Hero games, as Metallica's earlier works frustrate the player enough to [...] "throw the controller <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> stop playing". [...] Flores described the difficulty for most of the game to be comparable to Guitar Hero: Aerosmith and World Tour after the complaints of the difficulty level in Guitar Hero III, but further noted that the most difficult songs in the games will be very challenging. Real-life venues are used for the game, including The Stone nightclub in San Francisco, the Hammersmith Odeon in London, Tushino Airfield in Moscow, and The Forum in Los Angeles, and one final venue representing the pinnacle of Metallica's success. [...] The game was completed before Metallica's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and thus does not include reference to this event. [...] The game's interface remain similar to World Tour with some Metallica-based artwork added to it. Two changes have been made from World Tour; individual performance and Star Power meters are now located next to each track on screen instead of grouped together {{to make it easier to}} keep track of one's own performance, and when the band's performance is failing, the edges of the screen glow red to indicate this.|$|E
