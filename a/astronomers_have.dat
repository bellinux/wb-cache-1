5|$|<b>Astronomers</b> <b>have</b> {{started to}} {{discover}} extrasolar Earth analogs – planets that {{lie in the}} habitable zone of space surrounding a star, and therefore could possibly host {{life as we know}} it.|$|E
5|$|Astronomy {{is one of}} the few {{sciences}} where amateurs {{still play}} an active role, especially in the discovery and observation of transient phenomena. Amateur <b>astronomers</b> <b>have</b> made and contributed to many important astronomical discoveries, such as finding new comets.|$|E
5|$|<b>Astronomers</b> <b>have</b> {{discovered}} nearly 500 planetary {{systems with}} multiple planets. Regularly these systems include a few planets with masses several {{times greater than}} Earth's (super-Earths), orbiting closer to their star than Mercury is to the Sun, and sometimes also Jupiter-mass gas giants close to their star.|$|E
500|$|Understanding of the Moon's cycles was {{an early}} {{development}} of astronomy: by the , Babylonian <b>astronomers</b> <b>had</b> recorded the 18-year Saros cycle of lunar eclipses, [...] and Indian <b>astronomers</b> <b>had</b> described the Moon's monthly elongation. The Chinese astronomer Shi Shen [...] gave instructions for predicting solar and lunar eclipses.|$|R

5|$|M110 {{also appears}} to be {{interacting}} with the Andromeda Galaxy, and <b>astronomers</b> <b>have</b> found in the halo of the latter a stream of metal-rich stars that appear to have been stripped from these satellite galaxies. M110 does contain a dusty lane, which may indicate recent or ongoing star formation.|$|E
5|$|Many Christians {{believe the}} star was a miraculous sign {{to mark the}} birth of the Christ (or Messiah). Some theologians claimed that the star {{fulfilled}} a prophecy, known as the Star Prophecy. <b>Astronomers</b> <b>have</b> made several attempts to link the star to unusual astronomical events, such as a conjunction of Jupiter and Venus, a comet or a supernova.|$|E
5|$|Observations of Io by {{spacecraft}} and Earth-based <b>astronomers</b> <b>have</b> led to {{the identification}} of differences {{in the types of}} eruptions seen on the satellite. The three main types identified include intra-patera, flow-dominated, and explosion-dominated eruptions. They differ in terms of duration, energy released, brightness temperature (determined from infrared imaging), type of lava flow, and whether it is confined within volcanic pits.|$|E

25|$|Antinous is an {{obsolete}} constellation {{no longer}} in use by <b>astronomers,</b> <b>having</b> been merged into Aquila, which it bordered to the North.|$|R
5|$|HIP 78530 b is {{most likely}} a brown dwarf, a massive object that {{is large enough to}} fuse {{deuterium}} (something that planets are too small to do) but not large enough to ignite and become a star. Because HIP 78530 b's characteristics blend the line between {{whether or not it is}} a brown dwarf or a planet, <b>astronomers</b> <b>have</b> tried to determine what HIP 78530 b is by predicting whether it was created in a planet-like or star-like (how brown dwarves are formed) manner.|$|E
5|$|Many {{hundreds}} of smaller {{members of the}} family, some only a few meters across, have been discovered since {{the launch of the}} SOHO satellite in 1995. None of these smaller comets have survived its perihelion passage. Larger sungrazers such as the Great Comet of 1843 and C/2011 W3 (Lovejoy) have survived their perihelion passage. Amateur <b>astronomers</b> <b>have</b> been successful at discovering Kreutz comets in the data available in real time via the Internet.|$|E
5|$|The {{confirmation}} of HIP 78530 b was reported on January 24, 2011. In imaging the ninety-one stars, HIP 78530 b and 1RXSJ1609-2105b were discovered. The discoveries {{of these two}} orbiting bodies allowed astronomers to predict that bodies with such low planet/brown dwarf-to-star mass ratios (below 0.01) orbiting {{at a distance of}} hundreds of AU exists in the orbits of 2.2% of all stars. However, this number is a lower limit, as <b>astronomers</b> <b>have</b> been unable to detect smaller, low-mass planets that fit this scenario.|$|E
50|$|Aids now had {{the upper}} hand on Bob but he had desire to {{complete}} one more play, Copernicus, an ironic twist since Nicolaus Copernicus the <b>astronomer</b> <b>had</b> leprosy, the AIDS of 15th century.|$|R
50|$|Kepler-37b, {{along with}} two other planets, Kepler-37c and Kepler-37d, were {{discovered}} by the Kepler space telescope, which observes stellar transits. After observing transits of Kepler-37b, <b>astronomers</b> <b>had</b> to compare it {{with the size of}} the parent star.|$|R
50|$|Brett {{was also}} a keen <b>astronomer,</b> <b>having</b> studied the subject from childhood. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1871. Brett was a founder member of the Art Workers' Guild and Master in 1890.|$|R
5|$|The {{extinction}} {{of the dinosaurs}} {{at the end of}} the Cretaceous period is generally thought to have been caused by the Cretaceous–Paleogene impact event, which created the Chicxulub crater, demonstrating that impacts are a serious threat to life on Earth. <b>Astronomers</b> <b>have</b> speculated that without Jupiter to mop up potential impactors, extinction events might have been more frequent on Earth, and complex life might not have been able to develop. This is part of the argument used in the Rare Earth hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|A star is a {{luminous}} sphere of plasma {{held together by}} its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are {{visible to the naked}} eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. <b>Astronomers</b> <b>have</b> assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are in{{visible to the naked eye}} from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Charles Kowal {{discovered}} 2060 Chiron, an icy planetoid with {{an orbit}} between Saturn and Uranus. He used a blink comparator, the same device that had allowed Clyde Tombaugh to discover Pluto nearly 50 years before. In 1992, another object, 5145 Pholus, {{was discovered in}} a similar orbit. Today, an entire population of comet-like bodies, called the centaurs, is known {{to exist in the}} region between Jupiter and Neptune. The centaurs' orbits are unstable and have dynamical lifetimes of a few million years. From the time of Chiron's discovery in 1977, <b>astronomers</b> <b>have</b> speculated that the centaurs therefore must be frequently replenished by some outer reservoir.|$|E
50|$|It had {{previously}} been claimed that XTE J1739-285 was the fastest-spinning celestial body yet known, with a frequency of 1122 Hz (approximately 67,320 RPM). However, a re-analysis of these data by other <b>astronomers</b> <b>has</b> been unable to reproduce this result.|$|R
50|$|Research {{from the}} Radial Velocity Experiment at the Australian Astronomical Observatory headed by Quentin Parker {{was first to}} {{quantify}} {{the nature of the}} group, though <b>astronomers</b> <b>had</b> known of its existence for some time. It was first discovered in 1971.|$|R
50|$|Together {{with fellow}} astronomers Marc Aaronson and Jeremy Mould, Huchra {{announced}} {{that based on}} their analysis of the brightness and rotational speed of certain spiral galaxies that the universe was nine billion years old, half the age that most <b>astronomers</b> <b>had</b> previously thought.|$|R
5|$|In Amenhotep I's ninth regnal year, a heliacal rise of Sothis was {{observed}} {{on the ninth}} day of the third month of summer. Modern <b>astronomers</b> <b>have</b> calculated that, if the observation was made from Memphis or Heliopolis, such an observation {{could only have been}} made on that day in 1537 BC. If the observation was made in Thebes, however, it could only have taken place in 1517 BC. The latter choice is usually accepted as correct since Thebes was the capital during the early 18th dynasty; hence, Amenhotep I is usually given an accession date in 1526 BC, although the possibility of 1546 BC is not entirely dismissed.|$|E
5|$|In nearby objects (within our Milky Way galaxy) {{observed}} redshifts {{are almost}} always related to the line-of-sight velocities associated with the objects being observed. Observations of such redshifts and blueshifts have enabled astronomers to measure velocities and parametrize the masses of the orbiting stars in spectroscopic binaries, a method first employed in 1868 by British astronomer William Huggins. Similarly, small redshifts and blueshifts detected in the spectroscopic measurements of individual stars are one way <b>astronomers</b> <b>have</b> been able to diagnose and measure the presence and characteristics of planetary systems around other stars and have even made very detailed differential measurements of redshifts during planetary transits to determine precise orbital parameters. Finely detailed measurements of redshifts are used in helioseismology to determine the precise movements of the photosphere of the Sun. Redshifts have also been {{used to make the}} first measurements of the rotation rates of planets, velocities of interstellar clouds, the rotation of galaxies, and the dynamics of accretion onto neutron stars and black holes which exhibit both Doppler and gravitational redshifts. Additionally, the temperatures of various emitting and absorbing objects can be obtained by measuring Doppler broadening – effectively redshifts and blueshifts over a single emission or absorption line. By measuring the broadening and shifts of the 21-centimeter hydrogen line in different directions, <b>astronomers</b> <b>have</b> been able to measure the recessional velocities of interstellar gas, which in turn reveals the rotation curve of our Milky Way. Similar measurements have been performed on other galaxies, such as Andromeda. As a diagnostic tool, redshift measurements {{are one of the most}} important spectroscopic measurements made in astronomy.|$|E
5|$|Supernova discoveries are {{reported}} to the International Astronomical Union's Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams, which sends out a circular with the name it assigns to that supernova. The name is the marker SN followed by the year of discovery, suffixed with a one or two-letter designation. The first 26 supernovae of the year are designated with a capital letter from A to Z. Afterward pairs of lower-case letters are used: aa, ab, and so on. Hence, for example, SN2003C designates the third supernova reported in the year 2003. The last supernova of 2005 was SN2005nc, indicating {{that it was the}} 367th supernova found in 2005. Since 2000, professional and amateur <b>astronomers</b> <b>have</b> been finding several hundreds of supernovae each year (572 in 2007, 261 in 2008, 390 in 2009; 231 in 2013).|$|E
50|$|Alekhin is {{scheduled}} to occlude a 9.1 magnitude star in the Leo constellation on 30 November 2008, dimming the magnitude of both heavenly bodies for a maximum duration of 0.6 seconds. <b>Astronomers</b> <b>had,</b> as of March 2008, not predicted an optimal trajectory for the event.|$|R
5000|$|In 1899, <b>astronomers</b> <b>had</b> {{predicted}} a great meteor shower {{now known as}} the Leonids. The French chose a female astronomer - Dorothea Klumpke - {{to be the one to}} ride in a balloon to observe the shower - the shower turned out a complete failure.|$|R
25|$|Sabatino de Ursis (1575–1620) {{worked with}} Matteo Ricci on the Chinese {{translation}} of Euclid's Elements, published books in Chinese on Western hydraulics, and by predicting an eclipse which Chinese <b>astronomers</b> <b>had</b> not anticipated, {{opened the door}} to the reworking of the Chinese calendar using Western calculation techniques.|$|R
5|$|The cluster {{contains}} many brown dwarfs, which are objects {{with less than}} about 8% of the Sun's mass, not heavy enough for nuclear fusion reactions to start in their cores and become proper stars. They may constitute up to 25% {{of the total population}} of the cluster, although they contribute less than 2% of the total mass. <b>Astronomers</b> <b>have</b> made great efforts to find and analyse brown dwarfs in the Pleiades and other young clusters, because they are still relatively bright and observable, while brown dwarfs in older clusters have faded and are much more difficult to study.|$|E
5|$|The {{supernova}} SN 1006 {{appeared in}} the southern constellation of Lupus during the year 1006 CE. This was the brightest recorded star ever {{to appear in the}} night sky, and its presence was noted in China, Egypt, Iraq, Italy, Japan and Switzerland. It may also have been noted in France, Syria, and North America. Egyptian physician, astronomer and astrologer Ali ibn Ridwan gave the brightness of this star as one-quarter the brightness of the Moon. Modern <b>astronomers</b> <b>have</b> discovered the faint remnant of this explosion and determined that it was only 7,100 light-years from the Earth.|$|E
5|$|Volcanology of Io, a moon of Jupiter, is the {{scientific}} study of lava flows, volcanic pits, and volcanism (volcanic activity) on the surface of Io. Its volcanic activity was discovered in 1979 by Voyager 1 imaging scientist Linda Morabito. Observations of Io by passing spacecraft (the Voyagers, Galileo, Cassini, and New Horizons) and Earth-based <b>astronomers</b> <b>have</b> revealed more than 150 active volcanoes. Up to 400 such volcanoes are predicted to exist based on these observations. Io's volcanism makes the satellite one of only four known currently volcanically active worlds in the Solar System (the other three being Earth, Saturn's moon Enceladus, and Neptune's moon Triton).|$|E
2500|$|The San Francisco Chronicle {{reported}} that an amateur <b>astronomer</b> <b>had</b> taken a five-second exposure {{that appeared to}} show [...] "a purplish line near the shuttle", resembling lightning, during re-entry. The CAIB report concluded that the image {{was the result of}} [...] "camera vibrations during a long-exposure".|$|R
50|$|Chinese and Arabic {{astronomy}} intermingled under Mongol rule. Muslim astronomers {{worked in}} the Chinese Astronomical Bureau established by Kublai Khan, while some Chinese astronomers also worked at the Persian Maragha observatory. Before this, in ancient times, Indian <b>astronomers</b> <b>had</b> lent their expertise to the Chinese court.|$|R
50|$|Of the {{clusters}} {{it has been}} used with, certainly the most famous are the Hyades and the Pleiades. The moving-cluster method was in fact the only way <b>astronomers</b> <b>had</b> to measure the distance to these clusters with any precision for some time in the early 20th century.|$|R
