5|$|Around 300men from Cheadle Hulme {{served in}} the First World War, and {{it was decided that}} those who died should be commemorated. Various ideas, {{including}} a library and clock tower, were suggested and in the end a cenotaph was built on the corner of Ravenoak Road and Manor Road in 1921. Additions for later wars have been made, and due to the busy traffic around that particular place there have been suggestions for moving it to <b>a</b> <b>quieter</b> area.|$|E
5|$|The {{loudness}} of {{the song}} is correlated {{with the size of}} the male {{and the quality of the}} habitat, both indicators of male attractiveness. The loudest males may attract 20 females in one evening, when <b>a</b> <b>quieter</b> male may attract none. This behaviour enables acoustic trapping: females can be trapped in large numbers by broadcasting a male's song very loudly.|$|E
5|$|Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star is the {{follow-up}} to Sonic Youth's 1992 album Dirty, which {{was released by}} DGC {{in the wake of}} Nirvana's breakthrough into the mainstream. Dirty became one of the band's most commercially successful albums, selling around 500,000 copies worldwide as of May 1994. The album also reached No. 83 on the US Billboard Top 200 chart and No. 6 on the UK Albums Chart. After Dirty, Sonic Youth decided to step away from major-label alternative rock acts, which singer and guitarist Thurston Moore thought the media associated the band with. Touring with indie rock bands like Pavement, Sebadoh, and Royal Trux inspired Sonic Youth to write <b>a</b> <b>quieter</b> and more subtle album.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, Airbus {{introduced}} a new enhanced comfort cabin for the A320. Airbus says it offers better luggage storage and <b>a</b> <b>quieter</b> cabin, packaged with a more modern look and feel. Additionally, improved cabin efficiency from a new galley concept, reduced weight, improved ergonomics and food hygiene, and recycling requirements. LED ambiance lighting is optionally available. Anytime LEDs are used for the Passenger Service Unit (PSU) and passengers can get information with touchscreen displays. Older A320 series aircraft can be updated.|$|E
5|$|On 7 June 1917, Peeler {{participated in}} the initial assault on Messines Ridge. Manning a Lewis Gun during the action, he was injured twice, {{suffering}} shrapnel wounds {{to his face and}} eye from an artillery shell, and a gunshot wound to his right cheek. He spent three days in hospital before returning to his battalion. On 22 June, he was once again promoted to lance corporal. The 3rd Pioneer Battalion spent the next four months in <b>a</b> <b>quieter</b> section of the front.|$|E
5|$|In early 1950, St. Laurent {{considered}} recommending {{the appointment}} of Howe as governor general. The governor general {{had always been a}} British peer; many nationalists wanted a Canadian to hold the post, and St. Laurent agreed with them. The governor general, The Viscount Alexander, was due to retire by 1953, by which time Howe would be 68. St. Laurent saw this as a way of allowing his friend and colleague to step away from politics for <b>a</b> <b>quieter</b> life. The minister was willing to take the post, but the position unexpectedly opened early when Alexander was appointed to the British Cabinet. Howe decided he still had work to do as a minister. He was also reluctant to exchange real power for the nominal power of the governor generalship. St. Laurent recommended {{the appointment of}} Canadian-born Vincent Massey, who was duly appointed by King George VI.|$|E

5|$|Born into {{a family}} of the Lincolnshire landed gentry, Boucherett became {{involved}} in local politics in Lincolnshire, and (owing mainly to his marriage) with artistic and mercantile circles in London. He {{was the chairman of}} the Grimsby Haven Company, which oversaw the reopening and expansion of Grimsby's first dock. He was a friend of the artist Sir Thomas Lawrence and the proprietor of Willingham, Lincolnshire, where he constructed his country seat, Willingham House, in 1790. For his investment in the Haven Company, he received the support of Lord Yarborough, one of its main investors and a principal land-owner in Grimsby; owing largely to Lord Yarborough's patronage, Boucherett was returned as the Member of Parliament for that borough at the 1796 election. He was not a frequent voter, but used his position to further the interests of his corporation. Nonetheless, the company met with financial difficulties after it opened the Harbour in 1800. In 1803, Boucherett resigned his seat in favour of Yarborough's heir and pursued <b>a</b> <b>quieter</b> political life. He died in a carriage accident in 1815.|$|E
5|$|After {{playing in}} two trial matches, Headley was {{selected}} to tour England in 1933 under the continuing captaincy of Jackie Grant. The English press speculated on Headley's {{ability to cope with}} English conditions, while expecting him to perform to a high standard. In the event, Wisden believed he justified the expectations and increased his reputation. In the first match of the tour he scored 52 {{out of a total of}} 129 against Northamptonshire, in difficult batting conditions on a wet pitch. He scored fifties in each of his next three matches before scoring a century against the MCC during his first appearance at Lord's Cricket Ground. In the second innings of this match, a short ball from Bill Bowes struck Headley on the chest, and as a result of this injury he missed three games, but when he returned to the team he scored 129 against Glamorgan and 224 not out against Somerset. <b>A</b> <b>quieter</b> match followed against Middlesex, but Headley reached his second double century of the tour in the match against Derbyshire, which took him past 1,000 runs for the season. Despite Headley's contributions, the West Indians won only one of these matches and subsequently lost the first Test against England by an innings. Headley scored 13 in the West Indies first innings, and his 50 was the highest score when West Indies followed-on. Critics were impressed by Headley's second innings performance, in which he scored his runs out of 64 added while he was batting. Between the first and second Tests, in matches where conditions were difficult for batting and ideal for spin bowlers, Headley scored three fifties and achieved his side's highest score in each of four innings.|$|E
5|$|Frogs {{are much}} more vocal, {{especially}} during the breeding season when they use their voices to attract mates. The presence of a particular species in an area may be more easily discerned by its characteristic call than by a fleeting glimpse of the animal itself. In most species, the sound is produced by expelling air from the lungs over the vocal cords into an air sac or sacs in the throat or {{at the corner of}} the mouth. This may distend like a balloon and acts as a resonator, helping to transfer the sound to the atmosphere, or the water at times when the animal is submerged. The main vocalisation is the male's loud advertisement call which seeks to both encourage a female to approach and discourage other males from intruding on its territory. This call is modified to <b>a</b> <b>quieter</b> courtship call on the approach of a female or to a more aggressive version if a male intruder draws near. Calling carries the risk of attracting predators and involves the expenditure of much energy. Other calls include those given by a female in response to the advertisement call and a release call given by a male or female during unwanted attempts at amplexus. When a frog is attacked, a distress or fright call is emitted, often resembling a scream. The usually nocturnal Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) produces a rain call when there is rainfall during daylight hours.|$|E

Drake {{and consisted of}} <b>a</b> <b>quieter,</b> more acoustically-orientated take on Cardiacs' music. The project released a self-titled cassette album which was only available via the Cardiacs fan club. Later on, the project would be renamed The Sea Nymphs.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>quieter,</b> higher thrust version, the Mk 622, was proposed. Reheat was not {{required}} and the lower jet velocity reduced the noise from the exhaust. The improved efficiency would have allowed greater range and opened up new routes, particularly across the Pacific as well as transcontinental routes across America. However, the poor sales of Concorde meant that this plan for a Concorde 'B' was not pursued.|$|E

25|$|The ballast {{also serves}} as a means of drainage. Some more modern track in special areas is {{attached}} by direct fixation without ballast. Track may be prefabricated or assembled in place. By welding rails together to form lengths of continuous welded rail, additional wear and tear on rolling stock caused by the small surface gap at the joints between rails can be counteracted; this also makes for <b>a</b> <b>quieter</b> ride (passenger trains).|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, Johan Brögger {{modified}} the Boehm flute by fixing two major problems that had existed for nearly 150 years: maladjustment between certain keys and problems between the G and B keys. The result was non-rotating shafts, which gave <b>a</b> <b>quieter</b> sound and less friction on moving parts. Also, the modifications allowed for springs {{to be adjusted}} individually, and the flute was strengthened. The Brögger flute is only made by the Brannen Brothers and Miyazawa Flutes.|$|E

25|$|Resonance {{can cause}} timpani {{not in use}} to vibrate, causing <b>a</b> <b>quieter</b> sound to be produced. Timpanists must {{normally}} avoid this effect, called sympathetic resonance, but composers have exploited it in solo pieces such as Elliott Carter's Eight Pieces for Four Timpani. Resonance is reduced by dampening or muting the drums, {{and in some cases}} composers will specify that timpani be played con sordino (with mute) or coperti (covered), both of which indicate that mutes—typically small pieces of felt or leather—should be placed on the head.|$|E
25|$|Interior {{upgrades}} came in {{the form}} of reshaped seats and headrests, new colour schemes and switches. Third-row seating, a cargo barrier, and preinstalled wiring to accommodate mobile phone usage were made available as options for the station wagon variants. Additionally, all models were fitted with an advanced window film known as Smart Tint, which claimed to provide equivalent protection levels of SPF15 sunscreen. For improved vehicle refinement, thicker glass was installed to lessen wind noise and a further insulation was added in the dashboard to produce <b>a</b> <b>quieter</b> ride.|$|E
