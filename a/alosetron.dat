40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the pharmacological properties of the novel, selective 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonist, <b>alosetron,</b> and its effects on transit time in both the normal and perturbed small intestine of the rat. <b>Alosetron</b> concentration-dependently inhibited radioligand binding in membranes containing rat and human 5 -HT 3 receptors with estimated pKi values of 9. 8 (n = 3) and 9. 4 (n = 6), respectively. In selectivity studies <b>alosetron</b> had little or no significant affinity for any of the many other receptors and ion channels studied. <b>Alosetron</b> potently antagonized the depolarization produced by 5 -HT in the rat vagus nerve (estimated pKB value of 9. 8, n = 25). In anaesthetized rats, i. v. administration of <b>alosetron</b> inhibited 2 -methyl- 5 -HT induced bradycardia (Bezold Jarisch index) at 1 and 3 microg kg- 1, with an agonist dose ratio of approximately 3. 0 at 1. 0 microg kg- 1, = 3 - 5). <b>Alosetron</b> administered via the duodenum also inhibited this reflex, with duration of action that was significantly longer than that seen with ondansetron (120 - 60 min, respectively, n = 6). <b>Alosetron</b> had no significant effect on normal small intestinal propulsion in the rat, but fully reversed the increase in intestinal propulsion (96 %, n = 3) produced by egg albumin challenge. <b>Alosetron</b> is a highly selective 5 -HT 3 antagonist which normalizes perturbed small intestinal propulsion.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Alosetron</b> is a 5 -hydroxytryptamine- 3 {{receptor}} antagonist reducing {{symptoms in}} female patients with diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome, {{and is known}} to increase the colonic transit time. AIM: To study the effect of <b>alosetron</b> on left colonic phasic motility in ambulant non-constipated patients with irritable bowel syndrome and healthy volunteers. METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized, crossover design, 10 patients with irritable bowel syndrome and 12 sex- and age-matched volunteers were treated for two 7 -day periods with <b>alosetron,</b> 4 mg b. d., or placebo b. d. On day 6 of each treatment period, a six-channel solid-state manometric catheter was positioned in the left colon and 24 h motility was studied on day 7. The periprandial phasic motility around dinnertime was evaluated in the descending and sigmoid colon. The high-amplitude propagated contraction frequency and characteristics were calculated. RESULTS: <b>Alosetron</b> appeared to increase the overall periprandial frequency in the sigmoid colon (P= 0. 043) and the mean amplitude of colonic contractions in the descending colon (P= 0. 007). The high-amplitude propagated contraction frequency was higher on <b>alosetron</b> {{during the second half}} of the day for patients with irritable bowel syndrome (P= 0. 002), with increased mean propagation length of high-amplitude propagated contractions (P= 0. 001).

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThere is {{consensus}} {{that a more}} transparent, explicit, and rigorous approach to benefit–risk evaluation is required. The objective {{of this study is}} to evaluate the incremental net benefit (INB) framework for undertaking quantitative benefit–risk assessment by performing a quantitative benefit–risk analysis of <b>alosetron</b> for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome from the patients’ perspective. MethodsA discrete event simulation model was developed to determine the INB of <b>alosetron</b> relative to placebo, calculated as “relative value-adjusted life-years (RVALYs). ”ResultsIn the base case analysis, <b>alosetron</b> resulted in a mean INB of 34. 1 RVALYs per 1000 patients treated relative to placebo over 52 weeks of treatment. Incorporating parameter uncertainty into the model, probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed a mean INB of 30. 4 (95 % confidence interval 15. 9 – 45. 4) RVALYs per 1000 patients treated relative to placebo over 52 weeks of treatment. Overall, there was > 99 % chance that both the incremental benefit and incremental risk associated with <b>alosetron</b> are greater than placebo. As hypothesized, the INB of <b>alosetron</b> was greatest in patients with the worst quality of life experienced at baseline. The mean INB associated with <b>alosetron</b> in patients with mild, moderate, and severe symptoms at baseline was 17. 97 (− 0. 55 to 36. 23), 29. 98 (17. 05 – 43. 37), and 35. 98 (23. 49 – 48. 77) RVALYs per 1000 patients treated, respectively. ConclusionsThis study demonstrates the potential utility of applying the INB framework to real-life decision-making, and the ability to use simulation modeling incorporating outcomes data from different sources as a benefit–risk decision aid...|$|E

AIMS: To examine the effect of the 5 -HT(3) receptor antagonist <b>alosetron</b> on the depressor response to CRD, and on Fos expression in the lumbosacral spinal cord. METHODS: Male rats were anaesthetised with sodium pentobarbitone, and mean arterial blood pressure monitored during repeated colorectal balloon inflation before and after treatment with <b>alosetron</b> or saline. Rats anaesthetised with urethane and treated with <b>alosetron</b> or saline underwent a repeated CRD paradigm, after which the lumbosacral spinal cord was removed and processed for visualisation of Fos-LI. RESULTS: CRD elicited reproducible, volume dependent falls in arterial blood pressure, and repeated distention-effect curves were constructed. <b>Alosetron</b> (1 - 100 microg/kg intravenously) inhibited the depressor response to CRD in a dose related manner, with an ID(50) value of 3. 0 microg/kg.

Common therapies address one or two IBS symptoms, {{while others}} offer wider symptom control, presumably by targeting pathophysiologic mechanisms of IBS. The aim of this targeted literature review was to capture clinical trial reports of agents receiving the highest recommendation (Grade 1) for treatment of IBS from the 2009 American College of Gastroenterology IBS Task Force, {{with an emphasis on}} diarrhea-predominant IBS. Literature searches in PubMed captured articles detailing randomized placebo-controlled trials in IBS/diarrhea-predominant IBS for agents receiving Grade I (strong) 2009 American College of Gastroenterology IBS Task Force recommendations: tricyclic antidepressants, nonabsorbable antibiotics, and the 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonist <b>alosetron.</b> Studies specific for constipation-predominant IBS were excluded. Tricyclic antidepressants appear to improve global IBS symptoms but have variable effects on abdominal pain and uncertain tolerability; effects on stool consistency, frequency, and urgency were not adequately assessed.

40|$|Background—Carcinoid {{diarrhoea}} {{is associated}} with rapid small bowel and proximal colonic transit. Intravenous administration of a serotonin type 3 receptor (5 HT 3) antagonist restores postprandial colonic tone towards normal in carcinoid patients.  Aims—To evaluate the medium term effects of an oral 5 HT 3 antagonist, <b>alosetron,</b> on symptoms, stool fat, and transit in patients with carcinoid diarrhoea.  Methods—In 27 patients with carcinoid diarrhoea, symptoms were recorded daily and gastrointestinal transit was measured by scintigraphy in a three dose (0. 1, 0. 5, 2. 0 mg, twice daily), randomised (1 : 1 : 1), parallel group, four week study. Placebo was given during the first week.
