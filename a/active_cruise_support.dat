5000|$|Starting October 2016, all Tesla {{cars are}} built with the {{necessary}} hardware to allow full self-driving capability at a safety level (SAE Level 5). The hardware includes eight surround cameras and twelve ultrasonic sensors, {{in addition to the}} forward-facing radar. The system will operate in [...] "shadow mode" [...] (processing without taking action) and send data back to Tesla to improve its abilities until the software is ready for deployment via over-the-air upgrades. Therefore, Tesla cars with the new hardware will not have automatic emergency braking, collision warning, lane holding and <b>active</b> <b>cruise</b> control initially; these will be activated after the features are validated over time.|$|R

40|$|Advanced Driver Assistance Systems play {{a leading}} role in the {{revolution}} of cars; it has become a high priority for the automotive industry and now is no longer reserved for only premium cars. In this paper, a process is to be introduced, which allows to capture the User Experience (UX) already on the Model-in-the-Loop level (where only abstract models exist) to be fed back directly into the development process. This process allows for a more efficient work relationship between system development engineers and test & validation engineers. Furthermore the work in progress of a new tool is shown: MINARGUS. It allows a connection between a simulation model and the measurement of physiological data in one environment. The Advanced <b>Active</b> <b>Cruise</b> Control (Advanced ACC) system is used as a continuous example to support the paper...|$|R
