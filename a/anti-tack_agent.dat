Force-distance curves were used to measure the required force to squeeze out a certain volume of water in the balloon. Three catheters with different volumes were placed in the air and in the tissue (chicken and pork tissue). The counter-pressure of adipose tissue on implants was higher as bigger as the implants were. Implant formulations which tend to swell more, will be more suppressed by surrounding tissue at the site of administration and, consequently, the drug release of these formulations will decrease. Thus, the swelling of PLGA based implants and drug release at the site of administration were investigated. Two different loading of dexamethasone sodium phosphate implants were prepared (10 % and 30 %). The implants containing 10 % and 30 % w/w drug loading were placed into bottle with buffer and porcine adipose tissue. The swelling increase and drug release was faster with increasing the drug content and for dissolution tests performed in the bottles containing phosphate buffer. The adipose tissue applies pressure on implants which tend to uptake a huge amount of water and to swell. The limited water absorption consequently decreases the rate of drug release. Reduction of tackiness of PLGA films: The aim of this study was to reduce the tackiness of PLGA films in order to prevent the agglomeration of coated dosage forms during coating and to improve this process. Force-distance curves of the detachment process of two PLGA films were used to measure tackiness. Two different types of PLGA polymers were used (Resomer® RG 502 H and Resomer® RG 752 H) and two different <b>anti-tacking</b> <b>agents</b> were investigated, lactose and PLLA (Resomer® L 104). The tackiness increases with decreasing glass transition temperature of the polymer. Lactose and PLLA reduced the tackiness of the films, with lactose being much effective.
