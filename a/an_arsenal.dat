5|$|In February 2016, Naughty Dog {{announced}} {{the release of}} a 7-inch Nathan Drake action with articulated joints and <b>an</b> <b>arsenal</b> of gear and accessories. This action figure is being made by the toy company National Entertainment Collectibles Association, also known as NECA.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal's record home {{attendance}} is 73,707, for a UEFA Champions League match against RC Lens on 25 November 1998 at Wembley Stadium, where the club formerly played home European matches {{because of the}} limits on Highbury's capacity. The record attendance for <b>an</b> <b>Arsenal</b> match at Highbury is 73,295, for a 0–0 draw against Sunderland on 9 March 1935, while that at Emirates Stadium is 60,161, for a 2–2 draw with Manchester United on 3 November 2007.|$|E

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>Arsenal</b> {{finished}} third in their Champions League group, they entered the UEFA Cup. Wenger said he intended to take the competition seriously given the team's poor UEFA coefficient. Arsenal played their home games at Highbury instead of Wembley.|$|R
50|$|<b>As</b> <b>Arsenal,</b> Roy Harper {{displayed}} proficiency with {{a greater}} range of weapons, such as guns, truncheons, and boomerangs. He also became a master of Moo Gi Gong, allowing him to use virtually any handheld object as a makeshift weapon.|$|R
5|$|To prepare in {{the case}} of violence, the church applied for <b>an</b> <b>arsenal</b> that a {{volunteer}} company would use in case the church was attacked. Pennsylvania Governor David R. Porter authorized the formation of a company and the procurement of twenty-five muskets from the Frankford Arsenal. Major General Robert Patterson, commander of the Pennsylvania militia, put the troops on alert in case of violence.|$|E
5|$|Chapman celebrated New Year in London before {{travelling}} {{north on}} a scouting trip to see Bury play Notts County on 1 January 1934. The following day, he travelled {{to his native}} Yorkshire to watch Sheffield Wednesday, Arsenal's next opponents, before spending a final night in his home town of Kiveton Park. He returned to London nursing a cold but was well enough to watch <b>an</b> <b>Arsenal</b> third team match against Guildford City. Soon afterwards, his illness suddenly worsened; pneumonia set in, and Chapman quickly succumbed. He died {{in the early hours}} of 6 January 1934 at his home in Hendon. He was buried four days later in St Mary's Churchyard, Hendon.|$|E
5|$|Elite Force {{includes}} <b>an</b> <b>arsenal</b> of Star Trek–themed weapons, such as phasers and disruptors. The weapons vary in power, ammunition {{consumption and}} effectiveness in given situations. Usually, the player {{is equipped with}} a hand phaser, a low-damage weapon that automatically recharges ammunition, and a phaser compression rifle, a more powerful weapon with an optional sniper mode for long distance kills. Other weapons, acquired as the game progresses, include grenade launchers, stasis weaponry and pulse energy weapons. The player can restock on ammunition by using wall-mounted terminals that dispense weapon energy, or by picking up certain items in the game environment.|$|E

25|$|<b>As</b> <b>Arsenal</b> {{qualified}} for the Champions League by their league position, Hull City entered the 2014–15 UEFA Europa League at the third qualifying round; however, due {{to a change in}} UEFA rules, this was the last season the runners-up would enter the Europa League if the winners had already {{qualified for}} European competition.|$|R

5|$|In 1972 a {{testimonial}} {{match was}} organised by Everton on Lawton's behalf {{to help him}} pay off his debts of around £6,000. However his financial situation was still bleak, and on two occasions he narrowly avoided a prison sentence for failing to pay his rates after <b>an</b> <b>Arsenal</b> supporters club and later an anonymous former co-worker stepped in {{to pay the bill}} for him. In August 1974, he was again found Guilty of obtaining goods by deception after failing to repay a £10 debt to a publican, and was sentenced to 200 hours of Community service and ordered to pay £40 costs. In 1984, he began writing a column for the Nottingham Evening Post. Brentford also organised a testimonial match for him in May 1985.|$|E
5|$|In 1992–93, {{the inaugural}} {{season of the}} English Premier League, Norwich City led the league {{for much of the}} season, having been among the {{pre-season}} favourites for relegation, and were eight points clear of the field shortly before Christmas, before faltering in the final weeks to finish third behind the champions, Manchester United, and Aston Villa. They had shown that they were {{a force to be reckoned}} with from the very first day of the Premier League season, achieving an impressive 4–2 away win over <b>an</b> <b>Arsenal</b> side who were among the pre-season title favourites in a race finally won by Manchester United. This was a big surprise not least to the media and pundits who had tipped Norwich for a season of struggle.|$|E
5|$|On the Wednesday at 1:00, Galatasaray fans {{attacked}} {{a bar in}} Strøget in Copenhagen, where some Arsenal fans were located. The Arsenal fans left the bar to confront the Galatasaray fans, {{which led to a}} fight lasting for an hour before riot police managed to control it and arrested four Britons and four Turks. In the fight, Paul Dineen, <b>an</b> <b>Arsenal</b> fan, was stabbed, leading to Arsenal offering fans refunds if {{they did not want to}} fly to the game. Dineen was released from hospital later in the day and attended the match as a guest of the Arsenal directors.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>Arsenal</b> {{finished}} {{fourth in the}} league the previous season, the club played a qualifying round against Sparta Prague to ensure progression into the group stages. Goals from Fàbregas and Hleb in the away leg earned a 2–0 win and a 3–0 victory at home meant <b>Arsenal</b> qualified for <b>a</b> 10th successive season in the competition.|$|R

5|$|Swiss Hunters were {{operated}} as interceptors, with {{a secondary}} ground-attack role; from 1963 onwards, the outboard wing pylons were modified to carry two AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. In the ground-attack role, the Swiss Air Force maintained <b>an</b> <b>arsenal</b> of conventional iron bombs, {{a number of}} compatible napalm bombs were also maintained for intended use by the Hunters. In the interceptor role, the Hunters were supplemented by a surface-to-air missile (SAM) defence system also procured from the United Kingdom, based on the Bristol Bloodhound. In case of unservicable airstrips, Swiss Air Force Jets would take off from adjacent highways, using them as improvised runways.|$|E
5|$|The {{events of}} the day started early in the morning when skirmishes broke out in a bar, which led to <b>an</b> <b>Arsenal</b> fan being stabbed. Later in the day, Galatasaray fans {{occupied}} City Hall Square before heading towards Arsenal fans in bars nearby. The Galatasaray fans were later attacked from behind by members of British hooligan firms seeking revenge for the Istanbul stabbings. Despite deploying 2,000 officers to the area and having prior warning of potential trouble, the police were unable to control the riot until they fired tear gas at the rioters. This led to 19 injuries, including 4 stabbings, and 60 arrests with similar events occurring in England and Turkey {{in the aftermath of the}} riots.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{began the}} season in good form and equalled Nottingham Forest's unbeaten league run of 42 matches against Middlesbrough. The team set a new English {{division}} record and went a further seven games unbeaten before losing to Manchester United in controversial circumstances. Arsenal's form suffered as a result and defensive shortcomings became more apparent; two draws and a defeat in November reinforced Chelsea's position {{at the top of}} the table, where they remained for the rest of the season. At home to Crystal Palace in February 2005, Wenger named <b>an</b> <b>Arsenal</b> squad with no English players – a first in the club's history which attracted criticism from the media. The team ended the season strongly, with a run of eight wins from nine games ensuring a second-place finish. 32 different players represented the club in five competitions and there were 15 different goalscorers. Arsenal's top goalscorer was Thierry Henry, who scored 30 goals in 42 games.|$|E
50|$|In the 2006-2007 season, {{they began}} as top contenders for the title, having {{reached the top}} spot in November (though {{defending}} champions Arsenal L.F.C. kept postponing matches due to European Cup, League Cup and FA Cup commitments, {{which might have been}} a factor in Bristol's recent success). <b>As</b> <b>Arsenal</b> restarted its League matches, however, Bristol Academy slipped, hovering between the 4th and 8th places.|$|R

5|$|STRIKE's {{victory in}} the Black Sea leads them to the Caucasus, where Sadissa Savak, leader of the fictional state of Irek, begins {{aggressive}} overtures against local fighters. In the mission (which is supposedly north of the main battle area where Desert Strike took place), the player and Amad join forces with a militia run by Amad's relatives in stopping Ireki troops from capturing an ex-Soviet chemical weapons plant. With STRIKE killing Savak (and passed off as {{the victim of a}} car crash), the group goes to a heavily irradiated Transylvania to rescue Nick once more, this time from Dr Grymyenko Ukrainian, who wields <b>an</b> <b>arsenal</b> of ballistic missiles. The player is also tasked to kill the Shadowman's lead armor commander, Vila, who operates a special red-turreted T-80, and aid in the destruction of an abandoned nuclear reactor the Shadowman is planning to use.|$|E
5|$|Since Arsenal's first {{competitive}} match, {{more than}} 500 players {{have failed to}} reach 25 appearances for the club. Many of these players have spent only {{a short period of}} their career at Arsenal before seeking opportunities in other teams; some players had their careers cut short by injury, while others left for other reasons. John Kosmina, who joined from Adelaide City in 1978, only made four appearances for Arsenal, before returning to his native Australia where his goalscoring record was prolific. Vladimir Petrović featured 22 times as <b>an</b> <b>Arsenal</b> first-teamer, and later forged a managerial career, coaching Red Star Belgrade and the Serbia national team. Andy Cole, who played one league match as a youngster for Arsenal, moved to Newcastle United where he won the Premier League Golden Boot in 1993–94, and enjoyed further success at Manchester United in the mid-to-late 1990s. David Bentley and Rohan Ricketts left Arsenal in pursuit of first-team football, and both went on to play for Tottenham Hotspur at certain stages of their careers.|$|E
5|$|The 2005 final was Vieira's last match as <b>an</b> <b>Arsenal</b> player; {{he joined}} Juventus in the close season for a {{combined}} total fee of €20million. Wenger's decision {{to sell his}} captain was made so the team could benefit from Fàbregas, who broke into the first eleven during the season. In later years, Wenger deviated from his usual counter-attacking style, and imposed a fluent system, with less emphasis on physicality. The immediate seasons after Arsenal relocated to the Emirates Stadium in 2006 saw Wenger sell several experienced players, and integrate more young talent, {{as a means of}} fostering an identity with the club. Financing for the stadium however meant Arsenal prioritised its expenditure instead of the squad and trophies. Though Wenger managed to solidify the club’s position in the Premier League's top four and secure the necessary funds to pay back its debtors, the 2005 Cup win represented Arsenal's last silverware for nine years. In 2014, he led Arsenal to a record-equalling 11th FA Cup, and became the record equalling most successful manager in the competition's history a year later, as his side beat Aston Villa.|$|E
50|$|An {{aggressive}} and dynamic fighter, Hollenbeck uses <b>a</b> large <b>arsenal</b> of attacks and possesses considerable punching power.|$|R

5|$|While {{the weather}} was fine, the wind whipped up {{to such an extent}} at pitch level that the ball was taken out of its proper flight on occasion. In the third minute Sheffield United were nearly a goal up after Arsenal goalkeeper Wilson dropped the ball to the ground and fumbled at it trying to pick it up. United players Barclay and Dodds both charged in to take advantage, but <b>an</b> <b>Arsenal</b> defender cleared the ball away before they could turn the {{opportunity}} into a goal. During the first fifteen minutes, United were the superior team with the work of their forwards only failing against the work of Arsenal's full backs and goalkeeper with Wilson continuing to looking not entirely safe. Arsenal's defenders eventually settled with Crayston and Copping stepping up for their team.|$|E
5|$|Imam Ahmad bin Yahya {{inherited}} the Yemeni throne in 1948. In 1955, Iraq-trained Colonel Ahmad Thalaya led a revolt against him. A {{group of soldiers}} under his command surrounded the royal palace of Al Urdhi at Taiz, a fortified stronghold where the Imam lived with his harem, the royal treasure, <b>an</b> <b>arsenal</b> of modern weapons, and a 150 strong palace-guard, and demanded Ahmad's abdication. Ahmad agreed, but demanded that his son, Muhammad al-Badr succeed him. Thalaya refused, preferring the king's half brother, the Emir Saif el Islam Abdullah, the 48-year-old Foreign Minister. While Abdullah began forming a new government, Ahmad opened the treasury coffers and secretly began buying off the besieging soldiers. After five days, the number of besiegers was reduced from 600 to 40. Ahmad then {{came out of the}} palace, wearing a devil's mask and wielding a long scimitar, terrifying the besiegers. He slashed two sentries dead before exchanging the sword for a sub-machine gun and leading his 150 guards onto the roof of the palace to begin a direct attack on the rebels. After 28 hours, 23 rebels and one palace guard were dead and Thalaya gave up. Abdullah was later reported executed, and Thalaya was publicly decapitated.|$|E
5|$|The {{second half}} of extra time began with yet another chance for Manchester United, this time {{constructed}} from a Giggs break down the left wing, but Van Nistelrooy failed {{in his attempt to}} back-heel Giggs' cross into the goal and the opportunity was wasted. Five minutes into the second half, Reyes committed another late tackle on Silvestre, for which he received a final warning from referee Styles. Reyes himself was then the victim of a late tackle by Scholes, who was shown a yellow card. The match threatened to descend into a mass brawl soon after, when Fortune caught Ljungberg in the face with a flailing arm and then committed a high tackle on Edu, provoking a reaction from the Arsenal players. A shoulder-charge by Rooney on Cole resulted in <b>an</b> <b>Arsenal</b> free kick on the left wing; Van Persie swung the ball over and it was only cleared as far as Ljungberg, but the Swede struck a shot with his shin and the ball spun wide. With a couple of minutes left in the extra period, Manchester United won a free kick on the left corner of the Arsenal penalty area when Vieira lazily tripped Ronaldo and received a booking, but Giggs' cross from the free kick was headed away. Meanwhile, Manchester United's substitute goalkeeper, Howard, was seen warming up behind the goal, suggesting that he was preparing to come on for Carroll {{in the event of a}} penalty shootout; however, no substitution was made.|$|E
50|$|Mainly {{a reserve}} player at Arsenal, {{he did not}} make his first-team debut until 20 October 1951, against Charlton Athletic, <b>a</b> match <b>Arsenal</b> won 3-1. Chenhall made three {{appearances}} that season, and thirteen in 1952-53 as a deputy for Lionel Smith, enough to earn <b>a</b> medal as <b>Arsenal</b> won the First Division title.|$|R
50|$|<b>As</b> winners, <b>Arsenal</b> played Chelsea, {{winners of}} the 2014-15 Premier League, in the 2015 FA Community Shield at Wembley.|$|R
