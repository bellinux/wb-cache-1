25|$|The {{tongue is}} a muscular organ {{in the mouth}} of most {{vertebrates}} that manipulates food for mastication, and is used in the <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>swallowing.</b> It is of importance in the digestive system and is the primary organ of taste in the gustatory system. The tongue's upper surface (dorsum) is covered by taste buds housed in numerous lingual papillae. It is sensitive and kept moist by saliva, and is richly supplied with nerves and blood vessels. The tongue also serves as a natural means of cleaning the teeth. A major function of the tongue is the enabling of speech in humans and vocalization in other animals.|$|E

40|$|Swallowing and {{breathing}} utilize common muscles and an anatomical passage: the pharynx. The risk of aspiration of ingested material is minimized {{not only by}} the laryngeal adduction of the vocal folds and laryngeal elevation but also by the precise coordination <b>of</b> <b>swallows</b> with breathing. Namely, swallows: (1) are preferentially initiated in the postinspiratory/expiratory phase, (2) are accompanied by a brief apnea, and (3) are often followed by an expiration and delay of the next breath.

40|$|Objectives. It is well {{established}} that the brainstem regulates the <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>swallow.</b> However, the role of cortex and its influence on swallowing are still a question. Hence, the present study aimed to investigate if cerebral hemispheric laterality controls swallow activity. Methods. Thirty normal right handed participants were subjected to time test <b>of</b> <b>swallow</b> using 100 [*]ml of water. Dual paradigm was used to investigate hemispheric laterality for swallowing which involved listening to the speech or music stimuli presented binaurally while swallowing. The clinician measured total time taken and hyolaryngeal movement simultaneously which was used to calculate volume/time, volume/swallow, and time/swallow on an offline basis. Results. Results revealed that swallow performance decreased with the dual task paradigm compared to baseline swallow. These results are suggestive of cortex playing a role during swallowing in the dual task paradigm. Moreover, quantitative parameters like volume/swallow and volume/time were affected more when speech was competing with swallowing. However, music exerted greater interference over the speech for time/swallow. Conclusions. These results suggests that there exists differential cue lateralization hypothesis which means volume related parameters are controlled by left hemisphere and time related swallowing parameters are controlled at the right hemisphere...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether intra-individual changes in eustachian tube (ET) function induced by local {{application of a}} histamine phosphate solution can be detected using an improved sonotubometer. DESIGN: The function of the ET was measured with a revised sonotubometer before and after histamine {{was applied to the}} nasopharyngeal ostium of the ET. SETTING: Tertiary referral hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-five otologically healthy adults. INTERVENTIONS: A histamine phosphate solution with a concentration of 16 mg/mL was applied to the nasopharyngeal ostium of the ET using a pressure nebulizer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The number of openings during 10 <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>swallowing.</b> This outcome value could range from 0 to 10. The number of ET openings before and after histamine application was compared. RESULTS: The mean number of ET openings dropped dramatically: from 8. 4 before application of histamine to 2. 7 after application. This difference was statistically significant; there was a mean difference of 5. 6 (95 % confidence interval, 4. 4 - 6. 9; P <. 001). CONCLUSION: Sonotubometry is capable of detecting intra-individual changes in ET function and may therefore be a very useful tool in monitoring and/or clinical research of ET dysfunction or function...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{devise a}} simple and {{reliable}} diagnostic procedure to test Eustachian tube function routinely in an ENT outpatient setting. One method to measure ET ventilatory function is sonotubometry. The reproducibility of a recently updated sonotubometry set-up was tested in healthy children. METHODS: The test population comprised 61 school children aged from 6 to 8 years. Only otologically healthy children were included. Health state was established {{by means of a}} 12 -item questionnaire. To test reproducibility, sonotubometric testing took place in two sessions <b>of</b> 10 <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>swallowing</b> each. Spearman's coefficient was used to test the correlation between the two sets of measurements. All testing took place at a primary school in a nearby village. RESULTS: Opening of the ET was recorded in {{at least one of the}} two measurement sessions in 82 % of the children. The first and second sessions were highly correlated, with a Spearman's coefficient of 0. 89. CONCLUSIONS: In otologically healthy children, opening of the ET was recorded frequently using the updated sonotubometry set-up. Measurement results had high reproducibility. Therefore, the test forms a useful method to assess ET ventilatory function in otologically healthy children. The performance of this updated version needs to be established in children with otological diseases...|$|R

I wiggled my finger in the water, and he came from pure sociability, for he was beyond eating any more. The suspicious-looking object proved to be a bird's foot, and beside it was a pointed wing tip.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{test the}} outcome of sonotubometric {{measurement}} in children with otitis media with effusion (OME) before and after insertion of ventilation tubes. DESIGN: Eustachian tube ventilatory function was tested in children with OME. To test validity, sonotubometric testing took place before insertion of ventilation tubes (ie, glue ear) and 1 week and 3 months after grommet insertion (ie, aerated middle ear cavity). One set of measurements consisted <b>of</b> 10 <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>swallowing.</b> The outcomes <b>of</b> the tests were compared with those in otologically healthy controls. SETTINGS: All testing took place during an outpatient clinic otorhinolaryngologic consultation in a city hospital. PATIENTS: Thiry-three children with OME and 61 otologically healthy children (controls). INTERVENTIONS: Surgical grommet insertion. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sonotubometric measurements before and after insertion of ventilation tubes. RESULTS: Fewer incidences of {{the opening of the}} eustachian tube were recorded in the measurements before insertion of ventilation tubes compared with after insertion. The number of incidences of opening recorded after insertion of ventilation tubes did not significantly differ from measurements in healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Sonotubometric testing in children with OME reveals a low incidence of eustachian tube opening. Shortly after insertion of ventilation tubes, sonotubometry revealed no difference in eustachian tube ventilatory function compared with measurements in healthy controls. The low incidence of eustachian tube opening before grommet insertion may be attributable to decreased opening or dampening of the sound transmission by the middle ear fluid...|$|R

[...] "Yes," [...] said the king, [...] "brothers have need of brothers' aid. Would to God that mine were still alive." [...] In saying this he directed a meaning glance toward Godwin, which seemed to insinuate, as, in fact, the king had sometimes done before, that Godwin had had some agency in young Alfred's death. Godwin was displeased. He reproached the king with the unreasonableness of his surmises, and solemnly declared that he was wholly innocent of all participation in that crime. He imprecated the curse of God upon his head if this declaration was not true, wishing that the next mouthful of bread that he should eat might choke him if he had contributed in any way, directly or indirectly, to Alfred's unhappy end. So saying, he put the bread into his mouth, and in the <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>swallowing</b> it he was seized with a paroxysm of coughing and suffocation. The attendants hastened to his relief, the guests rose in terror and confusion. Godwin was borne away by two of his sons, and laid on his bed in convulsions.

This dumb-show, taking place during the whole time of the invalid's breakfast, and the invalid himself, pale and emaciated, performing no small part in the same, it may be fairly questioned whether at any meal, where no word, good or bad, was spoken from beginning to end, so much was expressed by gestures in themselves so slight and unimportant.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: In {{previous}} studies, {{an updated}} sonotubometry setup was tested in healthy {{adults and children}} to test its validity and reproducibility {{in the assessment of}} the ventilatory function of the eustachian tube (ET). The results were promising, but further investigations were needed to confirm the discriminative potential of this sonotubometry setup. Our objective {{in the present study was}} to test the discriminative potential of an updated sonotubometry setup in children with cleft palate. METHODS: The ET ventilatory function was tested in 56 children with cleft palate, ie, children with impaired ET function, and compared to the outcomes in 61 healthy children who served as a control group. All of the children were between 5 and 9 years of age. To test the reproducibility, we performed the sonotubometric testing in 2 sessions <b>of</b> 10 <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>swallowing</b> each. Spearman's coefficient was used to test the correlation between the 2 sets of measurements. The results of measurements in the cleft palate group were compared with those in the otologically healthy control group and analyzed by means of a Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Opening of the ET was recorded in at least 1 of the 2 measurement sessions in 57 % of the children with cleft palate, as compared to 82 % in the control group. The mean number of openings was lower in the cleft palate group than in the control group (respectively, 2. 3 versus 3. 7 out of 10; p <. 01). The first and second sessions were highly correlated in both the cleft palate group and the control group, with Spearman's coefficients of, respectively, 0. 96 and 0. 89. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that this updated sonotubometry setup has the potential to discriminate between these groups of children with various states of ET ventilatory function. Furthermore, the results of this study once again show that this updated sonotubometry setup is capable of assessing ET ventilatory function in both healthy children and children with cleft palate and that the measurements are highly reproducible. A persistent disadvantage remains that in 18 % of the 61 healthy children there was no ET opening that could be registered, which still prohibits a definite assessment at the individual level...|$|R

According to the {{inscriptions}} found in this temple {{it is one of}} 78 shrines build by the legendary Chola king Kocengannan. This king is only known from legends and Tamil texts from the Sangam age (approximately the centuries just before and after CE). The main shrine belongs architecturally to the Early Chola period. It is a vimana (garbhagriha=sanctum plus the roof) {{in the form of an}} elephant’s back which is called a Gajapristhakara. Normally in South Indian shrines the vehicle of a deity (which is a symbol of the deity) faces towards the sanctum. Here the sacred bull Nandi, the vehicle of Shiva here called Prathosha Nandidevar or Adikara-Nandi, faces away from the sanctum. The myth of the temple (the sthala purana) tells that when the primordial flood was about to wipe away Pennadam Shiva instructed Nandi to turn around and swallow all the water, thus saving the temple and the people of this place. Other mythological figures connected with this temple are Kamadhenu, the wishing cow, Airavatha, the elephant vehicle of Indra, king of the gods.

40|$|Abstract The phases <b>of</b> <b>swallowing</b> are {{controlled}} by central pattern-generating circuitry of the brain stem and peripheral reflexes. The oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal phases <b>of</b> <b>swallowing</b> are independent <b>of</b> each other. Although central pattern generators of the brain stem control the timing of these phases, the peripheral manifestation of these phases depends on sensory feedback through reflexes of the pharynx and esophagus. The dependence of the esophageal phase <b>of</b> <b>swallowing</b> on peripheral feedback explains its absence during failed swallows. Reflexes that initiate the pharyngeal phase <b>of</b> <b>swallowing</b> also inhibit the esophageal phase which ensures the appropriate timing of its occurrence to provide efficient bolus transport and which prevents the occurrence of multiple esophageal peristaltic events. These inhibitory reflexes are probably partly responsible for deglutitive inhibition. Three separate sets of brain stem nuclei mediate the oral, pharyngeal, and esoph-ageal phases <b>of</b> <b>swallowing.</b> The trigeminal nucleus and reticular formation probably contain the oral phase pattern-generating neural circuitry. The nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) probably contains the second-order sensory neurons {{as well as the}} pattern-generating circuitry of both the pha-ryngeal and esophageal phases <b>of</b> <b>swallowing,</b> whereas the nucleus ambiguus and dorsal motor nucleus contain the motor neurons of the pharyngeal and esophageal phases <b>of</b> <b>swallowing.</b> The ventromedial nucleus of the NTS may govern the coupling of the pharyngeal phase to the esopha-geal phase <b>of</b> <b>swallowing...</b>|$|R
