LDS Church membership statistics are different from self-reported statistics, mainly because the LDS Church does not remove an individual's name from {{its membership}} rolls based on disengagement from the church.|$|E

5|$|Beaches {{were blocked}} with {{entanglements}} of barbed wire, {{usually in the}} form of three coils of concertina wire fixed by metal posts, or a simple fence of straight wires supported on waist-high posts.

5|$|Berzelius {{made some}} initial characterisations {{of the new}} metal and its {{chemical}} compounds: he correctly determined that the thorium–oxygen mass ratio of thorium oxide was 7.5 (its actual value is close to that, ~7.3), but he assumed the new element was divalent rather than tetravalent, and so calculated that the atomic mass was 7.5 times that of oxygen (120 amu); it is actually 15 times as large. He determined that thorium was a very electropositive metal, ahead of cerium <b>and</b> <b>behind</b> zirconium in electropositivity. Metallic thorium was isolated {{for the first time}} in 1914 by Dutch entrepreneurs Dirk Lely Jr. and Lodewijk Hamburger.|$|E

5|$|Caddisflies {{are best}} known for the {{portable}} cases created by their larvae. About thirty families of caddisfly, members of the suborder Integripalpia, adopt this stratagem. These larvae eat detritus, largely decaying vegetable material, and the dead leaf fragments on which they feed tend to accumulate in hollows, in slow-moving sections of streams <b>and</b> <b>behind</b> stones and tree roots. The cases provide protection to the larvae as they make their way between these resources.|$|E
