5|$|The {{success of}} Woodruff's {{clinical}} transplant program was recognised and enhanced by {{funding from the}} Nuffield Foundation to construct and open the Nuffield Transplant Surgery Unit at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh. In 1970 an outbreak of hepatitis B struck the transplant unit, resulting {{in the death of}} several patients and four of Woodruff's employees due to fulminant hepatic failure. Woodruff was deeply shaken by the loss and the unit was closed for a period while an investigation was carried out to develop <b>a</b> <b>contingency</b> plan to avoid such a disaster in future.

5|$|A December 2007 QSR Magazine {{article about}} the {{conflict}} claimed that Burger King Brands had devised <b>a</b> <b>contingency</b> plan to remove itself from the dispute. Citing internal company documents, the Associated Press stated BK had concerns that such agreements might {{prove to be a}} possible violation of anti-trust laws, had possible tax implications, and that there were issues with third-party oversight for the agreements. As part of the company's plan, QSR Magazine claimed that the company was going to cease purchasing product from suppliers with whom the CIW was in disagreement. In response, the company issued a press release in February 2007 claiming that while it is a large purchaser, it is not responsible for the pay rates of it suppliers' workers as wage disputes are the province of the producer. BK also pointed out that it has an open offer of employment for any dissatisfied CIW members and scholarships (through its Have it Your Way Foundation) for family members of CIW workers.|$|E
40|$|<b>A</b> binary <b>contingency</b> {{table is}} <b>an</b> m x n array of binary entries with {{prescribed}} row sums r=(r_ 1, [...] .,r_m) and column sums c=(c_ 1, [...] .,c_n). The configuration model for uniformly sampling binary contingency tables proceeds as follows. First, label N=∑_i= 1 ^m r_i tokens of type 1, arrange them in m cells, {{and let the}} i-th cell contain r_i tokens. Next, label another set of tokens of type 2 containing N=∑_j= 1 ^nc_j elements arranged in n cells, and let the j-th cell contain c_j tokens. Finally, pair the type- 1 tokens with the type- 2 tokens by generating a random permutation until the total pairing corresponds to <b>a</b> binary <b>contingency</b> table. Generating one random permutation takes O(N) time, which is optimal up to constant factors. A fundamental question is whether a constant number of permutations is sufficient to obtain <b>a</b> binary <b>contingency</b> table. In the current paper, we solve this problem by showing a necessary and sufficient condition so that {{the probability that the}} configuration model outputs <b>a</b> binary <b>contingency</b> table remains bounded away from 0 as N goes to ∞. Our finding shows surprising differences from recent results for binary symmetric contingency tables...|$|R

5|$|As Kujira {{began to}} track towards Taiwan, the Taiwanese {{government}} issued land- and sea-based warnings {{in advance of}} the storm. The local weather bureau specifically alerted vessels off the southern and southeastern coasts of the island. Continued strengthening of Kujira prompted the Central Weather Bureau to issue medium typhoon warnings for several portions of Taiwan, though these warnings were downgraded to light typhoon status following the subsequent weakening of the typhoon on April22. This made Kujira the first April typhoon to prompt the issuance of any cyclone-related warnings in Taiwan since 1978. Impacts on the island were expected to be limited to rainfall, though the forecasted precipitation was also expected to lessen ongoing drought conditions. However, mudslides were also a potential impact from the typhoon. The National Fire Administration and Taiwan Power Company developed <b>a</b> <b>contingency</b> plan for the typhoon and had also undertaken other precautionary measures. Airports on Orchid Island and Green Island were closed. The resultant rainfall from Kujira's outer rainbands would be some of the most significant for the island in several months.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the event, the Société de Transport de la Communauté Urbaine De Montréal (STCUM) {{announced}} that they would held strikes over pension fund contributions during the Grand Prix weekend. STCUM chose those dates due to the event's high-profile status as public transport was classified as an essential service over the weekend. It would also result in the road leading to the circuit being blocked off to spectators. STCUM appeared before Essential Services Council on 9 June to discuss producing <b>a</b> <b>contingency</b> plan to ensure spectators would attend the Grand Prix with full services running. An agreement was reached on 13 June with 60% of transport workers voting in favour of improved pay and pension, allowing the race to go unaffected.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates {{differential}} neural activation {{patterns in}} response to reward-related feedback depending on various reward contingencies. Three types of reward <b>contingencies</b> were compared: <b>a</b> ‘gain’ <b>contingency</b> (<b>a</b> monetary reward for correct answer/no monetary penalty for incorrect answer); <b>a</b> ‘lose’ <b>contingency</b> (no monetary reward for correct answer/a monetary penalty for incorrect answer); and <b>a</b> ‘combined’ <b>contingency</b> (<b>a</b> monetary reward for correct answer/a monetary penalty for incorrect answer). Sixteen undergraduate students {{were exposed to the}} three reward <b>contingencies</b> while performing <b>a</b> series of perceptual judgment tasks. The fMRI results revealed that only the ‘gain’ contingency recruited the ventral striatum, a region associated with positive affect and motivation, during overall feedback processing. Specifically, the ventral striatum was more activated under the ‘gain’ contingency than under the other two contingencies when participants received positive feedback. In contrast, when participants received negative feedback, the ventral striatum was less deactivated under the ‘gain’ and ‘lose’ contingencies than under the ‘combined’ contingency. Meanwhile, the negative feedback elicited significantly stronger activity in the dorsal amygdala, a region tracking the intensity and motivational salience of stimuli, under the ‘gain’ and ‘lose’ contingencies. These findings suggest the important role of contextual factor, such as reward contingency, in feedback processing. Based on the current findings, we recommend implementing the ‘gain’ contingency to maintain individuals’ optimal motivation...|$|R
