5|$|The Orkneyinga saga {{reports that}} Malcolm married {{the widow of}} Thorfinn Sigurdsson, Ingibiorg, a {{daughter}} of Finn Arnesson. Although Ingibiorg is generally <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> died shortly before 1070, {{it is possible that}} she died much earlier, around 1058. The Orkneyinga Saga records that Malcolm and Ingibiorg had a son, Duncan II (Donnchad mac Maíl Coluim), who was later king. Some Medieval commentators, following William of Malmesbury, claimed that Duncan was illegitimate, but this claim is propaganda reflecting the need of Malcolm's descendants by Margaret to undermine the claims of Duncan's descendants, the Meic Uilleim. Malcolm's son Domnall, whose death is reported in 1085, is not mentioned by the author of the Orkneyinga Saga. He is <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been born to Ingibiorg.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the contradictions}} within Ramesside king lists {{and the lack}} of contemporary, festive inscriptions, the exact chronological {{position}} of Khaba remains disputed. Egyptologist Nabil Swelim believes that Khaba could have been the direct successor to King Khasekhemwy, the last ruler of the 2nd dynasty. He bases his assumptions on similarities between the two's names: both begin with the syllable kha. As a comparison, he points to the names Netjerikhet (Djoser) and Sekhemkhet (Djoserteti), which also display such similarity and are widely <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> ruled back-to-back.|$|E

5|$|In archaeological nomenclature, Norte Chico is a pre-ceramic {{culture of}} the pre-Columbian Late Archaic; it {{completely}} lacked ceramics and apparently had almost no visual art. The most impressive achievement of the civilization was its monumental architecture, including large earthwork platform mounds and sunken circular plazas. Archaeological evidence suggests use of textile technology and, possibly, the worship of common god symbols, both of which recur in pre-Columbian Andean cultures. Sophisticated government is <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been required to manage the ancient Norte Chico. Questions remain over its organization, particularly the influence of food resources on politics.|$|E

His place of birth is not certainly known, but he is <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been born in Iceland, which had recently been colonized by Norsemen mainly from Norway. He grew up in the family estate Brattahlíð in the Eastern Settlement in Greenland.

Divers who become symptomatic before they can be returned to depth are treated for decompression sickness, and do not attempt the omitted decompression procedure as the risk is considered unacceptable under normal operational circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} rising {{importance}} of a central administration arose {{a new class of}} educated scribes and officials who were granted estates by the pharaoh in payment for their services. Pharaohs also made land grants to their mortuary cults and local temples, to ensure that these institutions had the resources to worship the pharaoh after his death. Scholars believe that five centuries of these practices slowly eroded the economic power of the pharaoh, and that the economy could no longer afford to support a large centralized administration. As the power of the pharaoh diminished, regional governors called nomarchs began to challenge the supremacy of the pharaoh. This, coupled with severe droughts between 2200 and 2150BC, is <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> caused the country to enter the 140-year period of famine and strife known as the First Intermediate Period.|$|E
