5|$|Not {{long after}} Agricola's recall from Britain, the Roman Empire entered into {{war with the}} Kingdom of Dacia in the East. Reinforcements were needed, and in 87 or 88, Domitian ordered a {{large-scale}} strategic withdrawal of troops in the British province. The fortress at Inchtuthil was dismantled and the Caledonian forts and watchtowers abandoned, moving the Roman frontier some 120kilometres (75mi) further south. The army command may have resented Domitian's decision to retreat, but to him the Caledonian territories never represented <b>anything</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> loss to the Roman treasury.|$|E

They were too slow to stem the current in the Dniepr, and proved very difficult to steer. In practice the discharge of even one gun caused them to turn {{out of control and}} even contra-rotating some of six propellers was unable to keep the ship on the correct heading. Nor could they cope with the rough weather which is frequently encountered in the Black Sea. They were prone to rapid rolling and pitching in <b>anything</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> flat calm, and could not aim or load their guns under such circumstances.|$|E

25|$|Women {{look for}} certain cues {{on a first}} date: For example, it is {{important}} to a woman {{to find out if the}} man is courteous or not.

If some of her expectations are not met, mainly the most important ones, she will not want to pursue <b>anything</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> friendship. If the expectations are met, a second date might be in the future, but only if the man is feeling the same thing.|$|E

25|$|In 1967 Owen Wyn Owen {{decided to}} {{excavate}} and restore Babs. The {{site of the}} burial was identified from old photographs, but it {{was found to be}} within the perimeter of the present-day rocket establishment. The military authorities granted permission for the excavation on condition that Parry-Thomas's next of kin did not object. It took Wyn Owen two years to locate a living relative, a nephew living in Walsall, and finally the wreck was recovered. This recovery was controversial at the time, less so after the successful restoration. The prevailing opinion was that the wreck would be unsalveagable for <b>anything</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> pitiful museum display. Few expected that the wreck would ever resemble a car again, let alone be restored to running order.|$|E
25|$|The {{consequences}} of the marginalist movement were profound {{for the study of}} economics, Unger says. The most immediate problem is that under this generalizing tendency of economics, there is no means by which to incorporate empirical evidence and thus to re-imagine the world and develop new theories and new directions. In this way, the discipline is always self-referential and theoretical. Furthermore, the lack of a normative view of the world curtails the ability to propose <b>anything</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> policy prescription, which by definition always assumes a given context. The discipline can only rationalize the world and support a status quo. Lastly, Unger finds that this turn in economics ended up universalizing debates in macroeconomics and leaving the discipline without any historical perspective. A consequence, for example, was that Keynes’ solution to a particular historical crisis was turned into a general theory when it should only be understood as a response to a particular situation.|$|E
25|$|O'Keefe {{was born}} and raised in Blackley, in the city of Manchester. He went to school with Mike Pickering, who later found fame as a musician. As a youth he was a ball boy at Old Trafford, and was on course to join the Manchester United youth team when he broke his leg in a {{collision}} with David Allison, son of Malcolm Allison, in a regional schoolboy game. Upon his recovery he joined Stalybridge Celtic of the Cheshire County League, and playing as a right-back he won the club's Player of the Year award. This won him a chance in the Football League, and he turned down Crystal Palace to instead sign with Third Division club Plymouth Argyle in February 1974. He was told by manager Tony Waiters that he would never be <b>anything</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> fringe player in the professional game, who then allowed him to leave Home Park on a free transfer. He returned to Manchester and signed with Hyde United for the 1974–75 Cheshire County League season.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} of these he was {{completely}} successful; the sultan, believing as little as every one else that the canal was <b>anything</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> dream, gave his consent at a price the moderation of which he must afterwards have regretted. The gratified Ismail created Nubar a pasha, and the sultan himself, persuaded to visit Cairo, confirmed the title so rarely accorded to a Christian. Half the work was, however, yet to be done, and Nubar was sent to Paris to complete the arrangements, and to settle the differences between Egypt and the Canal Company. In what he used to call an expensive moment of enthusiasm, he left these differences to the arbitration of the emperor Napoleon III and cost Egypt four million pounds sterling. On his return he was made Egypt's first minister of public works, and was distinguished for the energy which he threw into {{the creation of a new}} department; but in 1866 he was made minister of foreign affairs, and at once went on a special mission to Constantinople, where he succeeded in the other two projects that had been left in abeyance since his last visit.|$|E
25|$|A law on worker’s {{democracy}} in public-sector companies {{was passed in}} July 1983 which sought to recreate a spirit of tripartism in a {{sector of the economy}} where existing statutory rights had failed to provide <b>anything</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> consultative role for representatives. Previously, workers had the right to be represented on the boards of public sector companies with 50 or more staff and were entitled to at least 2 board seats, but under the new legislation, public sector companies (previously nationalized companies plus those companies that were nationalized in 1982 in which the state was the majority shareholder) would be obliged to have tripartite administrative or supervisory boards to which employee representatives would be elected by the workforce. A couple of autogestionary measures were also introduced. One measure involved workers’ representation on the administrative councils of the nationalized industries, under which one-third of the members of these councils being drawn from the workforce. The other measure involved elections to the administrative commissions for social security, under which 15 and 25 members of these commissions were chosen through elections among those who were insured by the fund.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the biggest}} {{stumbling}} block was thatdespite being a fully compliant MS-DOS systemit was not {{compatible with the}} IBM PC at the hardware level. This was a problem because MS-DOS was rarely used as <b>anything</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> simple program loader; complex software (spreadsheets, Flight Simulator, etc.) could only obtain acceptable performance by direct manipulation of the hardware. Wang used a 16-bit data bus instead of the 8-bit data bus used by IBM, arguing that applications would run much faster since most operations required I/O (disk, screen, keyboard, printer). With this 16-bit design, Wang used peripheral hardware devices, such as the Wang PC display adapter, that were not compatible with {{their counterparts in the}} IBM PC line. This meant that the vast library of software available for the IBM PC could not be directly run on the Wang PC. Only those programs that were either written specifically for the Wang PC or ported from the IBM PC were available. A basic word processing package developed by Wang and Microsoft's Multiplan spreadsheet were the two commonly marketed software products. Lotus 1-2-3 and dBase II were also available. This dearth of application software led to the early demise of the original Wang PC, and it was replaced by an Intel 80286 based product that was fully plug compatible with the IBM PC. The unique system software was available at extra cost.|$|E
