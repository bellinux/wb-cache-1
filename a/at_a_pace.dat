5|$|Balzac's {{work habits}} are legendary, he wrote from 1 am to 8 am {{every night and}} {{sometimes}} even longer. Balzac could write very rapidly; some of his novels, written with a quill, were composed <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>pace</b> equal to thirty words per minute on a modern typewriter. His preferred method was to eat a light meal at five or six in the afternoon, then sleep until midnight. He then rose and wrote for many hours, fueled by innumerable cups of black coffee. He would often work for fifteen hours or more at a stretch; {{he claimed to have}} once worked for 48 hours with only three hours of rest in the middle.|$|E
5|$|Farsari sold many {{of these}} {{photograph}} albums, particularly to foreign residents and visitors. He employed excellent artists who each produced high-quality work <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>pace</b> {{of two or three}} hand-coloured prints per day. Farsari ensured that the colours were true to life and that the best materials were used. Accordingly, his work was expensive, yet popular and often praised by clients and visitors to Japan, even receiving a glowing reference by Rudyard Kipling following his 1889 visit to Yokohama. That same year, Farsari presented a deluxe photograph album to the King of Italy. By the 1890s, the studio's high reputation earned it exclusive rights to photograph the Imperial Gardens in Tokyo.|$|E
5|$|In Legacy of the Void, Daelaam' forces uncover a Purifier robot whose {{personality}} and memories was cloned from Fenix. This Purifier {{thinks he is}} Fenix in a dragoon shell. Artanis is overjoyed to meet this manifestation of his old comrade and is in no rush {{to tell him the}} truth, allowing him to discover it <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>pace</b> he is comfortable with, by studying the combat logs. Eventually, upon learning more about Fenix, he decides to have his name changed to 'Talandar'. He becomes the ambassador between the Daelaam and the Purifiers, convincing them to join force. He follows Artanis in battle to reclaim their homeworld.|$|E

East-west streets north of Roosevelt Road have street names except between State Street and Michigan Avenue. There are two block-long 8th and 11th Streets and a four-block 9th Street. Most streets south of Roosevelt simply use street numbers. Streets in this neighborhood from 13th to 26th are mostly numbered. Cullerton St (20th Street) & Cermak Road (22nd Street) are two of the few named east-west cross streets. Numbering continues southward in Chicago into the upper hundreds <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>pace</b> of 8 blocks per mile.|$|E
5|$|Sense8 was edited in the Wachowskis' {{headquarters}} in Chicago, Kinowerks, by Joe Hobeck and Joseph Jett Sally {{in the first}} season and by Sally and Fiona Colbeck in the second. Sally previously worked with the Wachowskis as first assistant editor on Speed Racer and editor on Ninja Assassin. The Wachowskis found editing a TV show to be a challenging process because of the required fast turnaround times. Lilly commented that for a feature film they get a minimum of ten weeks for editing as mandated by the Directors Guild of America, while for the first season of Sense8 {{they had to be}} moving <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>pace</b> of completing two 1-hour episodes (roughly the equivalent of a feature film) every two weeks.|$|E
5|$|During 1928–1973, the Soviet Union {{was growing}} {{economically}} <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>pace</b> {{that would eventually}} {{catch up with the}} United States and Western Europe. This was true despite the advantage the United States had — the USSR was hampered by the effects of World War II, which had left most of Western USSR in ruins. In 1973, the process of catching up {{with the rest of the}} West came to an abrupt end, and 1973 was seen by some scholars as the start of the Era of Stagnation. The beginning of the stagnation coincided with a financial crisis in Western Europe and the U.S. By the early 1970s, the Soviet Union had the world's second largest industrial capacity, and produced more steel, oil, pig-iron, cement and tractors than any other country. Before 1973, the Soviet economy was expanding at faster rate than that of the American economy (albeit by a very small margin). The USSR also kept a steady pace with the economies of Western Europe. Between 1964 and 1973, the Soviet economy stood at roughly half the output per head of Western Europe and a little more than one third that of the U.S.|$|E

The English scored <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>pace</b> above four an over in their opening partnership, helped by the freak injury that Glenn McGrath sustained before the match; during a warm-up (playing rugby), the paceman accidentally stood on a cricket ball, tearing ankle ligaments. Australia had to field Michael Kasprowicz as replacement, and missed McGrath's superior control and wicket-taking abilities in the match.|$|E

25|$|Mitchell Energy had a near-monopoly in {{drilling}} Barnett Shale {{wells in}} the early years of the field. In 1995, for instance, Mitchell completed 70 Barnett wells, while all other operators combined completed three. This was largely because the Barnett was marginal economically: according to a former CEO, Mitchell had invested about $250 million in the Barnett from 1981 to 1997, and had not recouped its costs. But after 1997, competitors realized that Mitchell had discovered how to extract gas profitably, they, too started buying leases and drilling Barnett wells, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>pace</b> that Mitchell could not match. In 2001, for the first time, Mitchell completed fewer than half the Barnett Shale wells (258 wells, versus 260 by other operators).|$|E
25|$|Swiss-Prot {{was created}} in 1986 by Amos Bairoch during his PhD and {{developed}} by the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics and subsequently developed by Rolf Apweiler at the European Bioinformatics Institute. Swiss-Prot aimed to provide reliable protein sequences associated {{with a high level}} of annotation (such as the description of the function of a protein, its domain structure, post-translational modifications, variants, etc.), a minimal level of redundancy and high level of integration with other databases. Recognizing that sequence data were being generated <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>pace</b> exceeding Swiss-Prot's ability to keep up, TrEMBL (Translated EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Data Library) was created to provide automated annotations for those proteins not in Swiss-Prot. Meanwhile, PIR maintained the PIR-PSD and related databases, including iProClass, a database of protein sequences and curated families.|$|E
25|$|Before {{embarking on}} a hunt, clans go through {{elaborate}} prehunt social rituals involving nuzzling, body rubbing and homo- and heterosexual mounting. Dholes are primarily diurnal hunters, hunting {{in the early hours}} of the morning. They rarely hunt nocturnally, except on moonlit nights, indicating they greatly rely on sight when hunting. Though not as fast as jackals and foxes, they can chase their prey for many hours. During a pursuit, one or more dholes may take over chasing their prey, while the rest of the pack keeps up at a steadier pace behind, taking over once the other group tires. Most chases are short, lasting only 500 m. When chasing fleet-footed prey, they run <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>pace</b> of 30mph. Dholes frequently drive their prey into water bodies, where the targeted animal's movements are hindered.|$|E
