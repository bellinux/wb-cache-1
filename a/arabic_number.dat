Neuropsychologia, 17, 467 - 472] found a size congruity effect for <b>Arabic</b> <b>numbers</b> {{but not for}} number words. They proposed that <b>Arabic</b> <b>numbers</b> and number words are processed in different ways. However, in their study orientation of the stimuli and notation were confounded. In the present study, {{it is found that}} orientation of number words affects numerical processing. Orientation modulates both the size congruity effect and the distance effect; horizontal presentation produces similar results to those produced by <b>Arabic</b> <b>numbers</b> whereas vertical orientation produces different results. Accordingly, it is proposed that our cognitive system is endowed with two different mechanisms for numerical processing; one relies on a visual-spatial code and the other on a verbal code...|$|R
2500|$|There are two motifs to {{indicate}} a metal oxidation state based around the actual charge separation of the metal center. [...] Oxidation states up to +3 {{are believed to be}} an accurate representation of the charge separation experienced by the metal center. [...] For oxidation states of +4 and larger, the oxidation state becomes more of a formalism with much of the positive charge distributed between the ligands. [...] This distinction can be expressed by using a Roman numeral for the lower oxidation states in the upper right of the metal atomic symbol and an <b>Arabic</b> <b>number</b> with a plus sign for the higher oxidation states (see the example below). [...] This formalism is not rigorously followed and the use of Roman numerals to represent higher oxidation states is common.|$|E

40|$|A {{chimpanzee}} (Pan troglodytes), {{trained to}} count foods and objects by using <b>Arabic</b> <b>numbers,</b> demonstrated {{the ability to}} sum arrays of 0 - 4 food items placed in 2 of 3 possible sites.
