5000|$|There were, however, some {{moderate}} and positive reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four, commenting, [...] "Daylight is the cinematic {{equivalent of a}} golden oldies station, where you never encounter anything you haven't grown to love over the years.

Some felt that while jumping on the Danica hype for all it was worth this pointed to ABC never really taking the idea seriously that she might actually win. Of course there could've been another version of the closing credits with another song available if she had won but no one at ABC has ever commented on it.|$|E
5000|$|The GYC annual gatherings have {{generated}} controversy within the Adventist community by Progressive Adventist.

[...] Ervin Taylor, writing for the Progressive Adventist magazine Adventist Today, criticized the movement, challenging claims that GYC is a grass-roots organization and pointing to tax documents showing GYC is well funded. He also suggested that GYC has a conservative ideology.|$|E

5000|$|The film evaded {{its release}} date {{several times and}} {{eventually}} took close to two years to complete, only finally releasing on 10 October 2003.

Rodriguez planned to hire Frank Frazetta, the popular Burroughs and fantasy illustrator, as a designer on the film. Rodriguez had previously stirred-up film industry controversy owing to his decision to credit Sin Citys artist/creator Frank Miller as co-director on the film adaptation; {{as a result of}} <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>hoopla,</b> Rodriguez decided to resign from the Directors Guild of America. In 2004, unable to employ a non-DGA filmmaker, Paramount assigned Kerry Conran to direct and Ehren Kruger to rewrite the John Carter script. The Australian Outback was scouted as a shooting location. Conran left the film for unknown reasons and was replaced in October 2005 by Jon Favreau.|$|E

5000|$|The {{film was}} bought by British film {{distributor}} David Lewis in 1996 and his firm Unique Films released it on video nationwide. The film contains steamy sex scenes and was filmed when Anderson was still a 19 year old student in drama school. Anderson hired lawyers to help stop the release. The British tabloid press which {{described it as a}} [...] "B movie", reported that she attempted to buy it back for [...] "large sums of money" [...] without success. They reported the scenes as [...] "semi-topless". Anderson's partner in the scenes, actor Michael Dolan, reported that the scene was shot at 4 am after a long day and that they were both exhausted. In spite of her embarrassment about the film, Anderson had a clause in her contract stating that her breasts could not be exposed. In spite of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>hoopla,</b> the Orange County Register described the scene as [...] "fleeting" [...] and that the film [...] "deserves better than to serve as a salacious footnote to a television show".|$|E

Trade Analyst Komal Nahta said, [...] "On the whole, Brothers, a mixed martial arts film, may carry mixed reports but it will ultimately prove to be a paying proposal for all concerned. It will do good business in multiplexes and single-screen cinemas, and in 'A', 'B', 'C' and 'D' class centres." [...] Film critic Subhash K Jha gave 4 stars out of 5 and said [...] "Brothers may not appeal to those who look for laughter in times of despair.There is barely room for a whiff of a smile in this dark sanguinary and seductive tale of destruction and redemption told in a free-wheeling style that accommodates derivations and innovations without apology or awkwardness." [...] The Times of India(TOI) gave 3 stars out of 5. Bollywood Hungama gave 3 stars out of 5. Koimoi(koimoi.com) gave 2.5 stars out of 5. Film critic Raja Sen for Rediff wrote, [...] "Weighing 158 unbearable minutes, Brothers is nearly 600-times as long as the Rousey win - and not one-millionth as thrilling." [...] Sen reviewed the characters of the film and concluded, [...] "But that's all this film has, a ball-busting Kumar and one particular fight that ends with delightful abruptness. Everything else is exhausting." [...] He gave the film 1.5 stars out of 5. Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV opines, [...] "For <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>hoopla,</b> Brothers, in going for the jugular, punches well below its weight. It makes so much noise that any sensible point about brotherly bonding and filial fidelity that it might be trying to make is completely drowned out by the decibels. Take your earplugs along." [...] He gave the film 2.5 stars out of 5. Anuj Kumar of The Hindu newspaper reviewed, [...] "The problem is, be it emotion or action, Karan is in no hurry to say cut. At times it works for the emotion to seep in but many times over elaboration dilutes the punch. The music is a let down. Kareena Kapoor deserved a better song and choreography for the special appearance." [...] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express summarized, [...] "Akshay Kumar, Sidharth Malhotra's film gets dragged down by its over-wrought mawkishness." [...] At firstpost, critic Deepanjana Pal stated, [...] "Akshay Kumar is hot but with Jackie Shroff and Sidharth Malhotra this film is a hot mess. A few more films like Brothers and Bollywood will have achieved what no amount of litigation can manage — the freedom to copy freely. Because if Gavin O'Connor, who directed and co-wrote Warrior, ever sees how his story has been brutalised, he might just go on a campaign claiming that intellectual property rights be damned, Hollywood is better off not being associated with Bollywood remakes." [...] Martin D'souza from Glamsham stated [...] "The fight director makes BROTHERS look good" [...] and gave 2 stars out of 5. Subhash K. Jha from skjbollywoodnews stated [...] "Definitely one of Akshay Kumar's glorious achievements." [...] and gave 4 stars out of 5.|$|E

Since these projections are used to support public investment in “clean tech” firms via tax incentives, economic developers {{at the state and local}} level need to know how to assess them. In this policy brief, we examine 16 studies of the economic impact of ethanol plants. First, we discuss what the studies have to say about the economic impact of ethanol plants – why are these plants expected to create jobs and in what ways? We then look at the methods used to estimate the job creation impact of ethanol bio-fuel plants and at the assumptions underlying estimation models. Finally we present a list of questions that public officials and economic developers need to ask in assessing claims for ethanol plant job creation and its utility as a public investment. U. S.

40|$|Given <b>all</b> <b>the</b> media <b>hoopla</b> over <b>the</b> Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s recent {{approval}} of racially and sexually defined employment goals and timetables, {{one would think}} that a weapon of awesome power and broad scope had been added to the enforcement arsenal of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission [EEOC or the Commission]. I am sorry to disappoint you, but the availability of goals and timetables will not mean the end of employment discrimination. Goals and timetables, long a popular rallying cry among some who claim to be concerned with the right to equal employment opportunity, have become a sideshow in the war on discrimination. The vast majority of all charges of employment discrimination now filed with the EEOC involve violations for which goals and timetables are not appropriate as a form of relief. Even in those circumstances where goals are available as a remedy, there are generally tougher and more effective alternatives available. Despite my personal disagreement with the Court 2 ̆ 7 s {{approval of}} numerical remedies, as Chairman of the EEOC, I am nevertheless grateful that the legal debate over goals and timetables has been resolved so that attention can be focused on the facts and the real issues in the EEOC 2 ̆ 7 s battle against employment discrimination...|$|R

40|$|Amidst <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>hoopla</b> about China’s rise, it {{is useful}} to {{remember}} that China is a developing country whose transition to a market economy is not yet complete, with institution building still underway. The uneven pace of progress is reflected in the state of its public sector, but in some respects, China’s public sector looks formidable. Most often mentioned is the government’s treasure chest of US$ 3 trillion in foreign reserves. Even more enviable, government revenues have grown at annual rates of over 20 percent for a decade (China Statistics 2011), fuelling a steep fiscal expansion at a time when so many countries are being forced to undergo painful consolidations. The government’s reputation was further burnished in the post-Lehman global financial crisis, when, after a brief—though sharp—downturn in 2008, China became the first major economy to return to robust growth, propelled by a stimulus program that was, in relative terms, by far the biggest in the world. The bold stimulus and quick economic recovery seemed to show off an effective public sector able to implement national policies swiftly. China’s public sector is impressive in other ways too.
