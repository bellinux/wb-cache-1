50|$|The {{horizontal}} alignment (or <b>alinement</b> in the United States) {{is done by}} using a predefined length of string line (such as 62-foot in the US and 20 meters in Australia) to measure along the gauge side of the reference rail. It is the distance (in inches or millimeters) from {{the midpoint of the}} string line to the gauge of the reference rail. The design {{horizontal alignment}} for tangent track is zero (perfect straight line on the horizontal layout). The design horizontal alignment on the curved track in the United States is 1 inch for each degree of curvature. Any other readings indicate deviations.|$|E
40|$|The {{space shuttle}} {{inertial}} measurement unit (IMU) <b>alinement</b> algorith was examined to determine the most important <b>alinement</b> starpair selection criterion. Three crew displayed parameters were considered: (1) {{the results of the}} separation angle difference (SAD) check for each starpair; (2) the separation angle of each starpair; and (3) the age of each star measurement. It was determined that the SAD for each pair cannot be used to predict the IMu <b>alinement</b> accuracy. If the age of each star measurement is less than approximately 30 minutes, time is a relatively unimportant factor and the most important <b>alinement</b> pair selection criterion is the starpair separation angle. Therefore, when there are three available <b>alinement</b> starpairs and all measurements were taken within the last 30 minutes, the pair with the separation angle closest to 90 degrees should be selected for IMU <b>alinement...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Lineaments were detected on Skylab photographs by stereo viewing, projection viewing, and composite viewing. Sixty-nine percent more lineaments were found by stereo viewing than by projection, but segments of projection lineaments are longer; total length of lineaments found {{by these two}} methods is nearly the same. Most Skylab lineaments consist of topographic depression: stream channel <b>alinements,</b> straight valley walls, elongated swales, and belts where sinkholes are abundant. Most of the remainder are vegetation <b>alinements.</b> Lineaments are most common in dissected areas having a thin soil cover. Results of test drilling show: (1) the median yield of test wells on Skylab lineaments is about six times the median yield of all existing wells; (2) three out of seven wells on Skylab lineaments yield more than 6. 3 1 /s (110 gal/min) : (3) low yields are possible on lineaments {{as well as in}} other favorable locations; and (4) the largest well yields can be obtained at well locations of Skylab lineaments that also are favorably located with respect to topography and geologic structure, and are in the vicinity of wells with large yields...|$|R

40|$|Access to the Great Kavir is {{generally}} {{limited to the}} period August through October when some salt crusts will support limited vehicular movement. The condition of the salt crusts and their parent sediments during the long wet season have been unknown. This absence {{of information about the}} surface of the Great Kavir has prevented an intensive study of a possible road <b>alinement</b> which could shorten the present route between northern and central Iran by 760 km. False color diazo composites of bands 4, 5, and 7 were prepared from positives of ERTS- 1 MSS images taken of the Great Kavir. These scenes presented a record of the seasonal hydrologic changes that occurred from the dry to the wet season. During the period of maximum inundation and lowest bearing strengths, as inferred from the image of May 12, 1973, it was possible to select a preliminary road <b>alinement</b> that would avoid the wettest or roughest areas and take advantage of the best terrain and shortest distance. The eventual road <b>alinement</b> should be based on a longer record of observation and on-site investigations...|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} to determine the feasibility of mapping lineaments on SKYLAB photographs of central Tennessee and to determine the hydrologic significance of these lineaments, particularly as concerns the occurrence and productivity of ground water. Sixty-nine percent more lineaments were found on SKYLAB photographs by stereo viewing than by projection viewing, but longer lineaments were detected by projection viewing. Most SKYLAB lineaments consisted of topographic depressions and they followed or paralleled the streams. The remainder were found by vegetation <b>alinements</b> and the straight sides of ridges. Test drilling showed that the median yield of wells located on SKYLAB lineaments were about six times the median yield of wells located by random drilling. The best single detection method, in terms of potential savings, was stereo viewing. Larger savings might be achieved by locating wells on lineaments detected by both stereo viewing and projection...|$|R
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. In the present study, 6 ERTS- 1 images have been interpreted on a 1 : 1 million scale (black and white) with the respective field reconnaissance. The area studied {{is located in}} the region bordering with Chile and includes {{the western part of the}} Bolivian Altiplano, the volcano Cordillera (western cordillera) and the northern part of Chile to the Pacific Coast. The greater part of this region is formed by Pliocene/Pleistocene volcani rock, which is discordant with the Tertiary sediments with intercalations of calcareous tuff. The ERTS- 1 imagery permits the tracing of regional boundaries of the great volcanic formations and the <b>alinements</b> of the volcanic bodies along the fault zones. They also permit a clear examination of the volcanic apparatus, including their secondary forms, such as lava flows, parasitic cones, and lava domes. Because of the great scale, it is not possible to identify either the small structures or those of low relief. On the basis of the interpretation of the images, it is possible to give an idea of the relative age of the volcanoes...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} on various can-type burners in a Bumblebee 18 -inch ram jet under controlled conditions of pressure altitude and ram pressure ratio {{was conducted in}} the NACA Lewis altitude wind tunnel with kerosene as fuel. The performance of the following can-type burner configurations was better {{than that of the}} other burner configurations investigated: (1) a flame holder having a two-pitch <b>alinement</b> of perforations, 0. 07 -inch-wide cooling slots, and an arrangement of fuel nozzles located within an annulus having a mean radius of 7. 24 inches; and (2) a flame holder having a zero-pitch <b>alinement</b> of perforations, 0. 16 -inch-wide cooling slots, and an annulus of fuel nozzles having a mean radius of 6. 89 inches. The maximum net-thrust coefficient and minimum specific fuel consumption were obtained with the ram-jet configuration that consisted of the burner just described having a flame holder with a two-pitch <b>alinement</b> of perforations and a combustion-chamber outlet restricted by a 14 -and-three-quarter-inch-diameter orifice plate. At a ram pressure ratio equivalent to a free-stream Mach number of 1. 44 and a pressure altitude of 30, 000 feet, the net-thrust coefficient was 0. 68 and the reduced specific fuel consumption was 3. 0 pounds of fuel per hour per pound of net thrust...|$|E

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Maps at 1 : 1 million scale exemplifying {{the first phase}} of the investigation (which consists of the identification and mapping of landform and land use characteristics and surficial geologic materials directly from the ERTS- 1 images without use of additional data) were prepared. For areas that have not been mapped at 1 : 500, 000 or larger scales, maps will provide the first moderately detailed information on landform features and surficial materials. Much of the information mapped is significant for exploration and development of ground (and, locally, petroleum) and for applications in engineering and environmental geology, including land use planning. Analysis of drainage patterns, stream-divide relations and land use patterns has revealed several possible moraine-controlled divices of middle and early Pleistocene age. One is an extension of the Cedar Bluffs moraine of southeastern Nebraska. Another of these divides may correspond to the terminus of Nebraska drift in the Kansas City study area. The trends of parts of various ancient filled valleys also have been identified by analysis of charges in width of the present stream valleys. The <b>alinements</b> of certain segments of stream valleys in Kansas and Missouri appear to be controlled by regional faults or other structural features...|$|R
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. The utility of Skylab 2 and 3 S- 190 A multispectral photos for environmental-geologic/geomorphic applications {{is being tested}} by using them to prepare 1 : 250, 000 -scale maps of geomorphic features, surficial geology, geologic linear features, and soil associations of large, representative parts of the Great Plains and Midwest. Parts of Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, and South Dakota were mapped. The maps were prepared primarily by interpretation of the S- 190 A photos, supplemented by information from topographic, geologic, and soil maps and reports. The color band provides the greatest information on geology, soils, and geomorphology; its resolution also {{is the best of}} all the multispectral bands and permits maximum detail of mapping. The color-IR band shows well the differences in soil drainage and moisture, and vegetative types, but has only moderate resolution. The B/W-red band is superior for topographic detail and stream <b>alinements.</b> The B/W-infrared bands best show differences in soil moisture and drainage but have poor resolution, especially those from SL 2. The B/W-green band generally is so low contrast and degraded by haze as to be nearly useless. Where stereoscopic coverage is provided, interpretation and mapping are done most efficiently using a Kern PG- 2 stereoplotter...|$|R
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. One capability {{which has been}} recognized by many geologists working with space photography {{is the ability to}} see linear features and <b>alinements</b> which were previously not apparent. To the exploration geologist, major lineaments seen on satellite images are of particular interest. A portion of ERTS- 1 frame 1407 - 17193 (3 Sept. 1973) was used for mapping lineaments and producing an iso-lineament intersection map. Skylab photography over the area of prime area was not useable due to snow cover. Once the lineaments were mapped, a grid with 2. 5 km spacing was overlayed on the map and the lineament intersections occurring within each grid square were counted and the number plotted {{in the center of the}} grid square. These numbers were then contoured producing a contour map of equal lineament intersection. It is believed that the areas of high intersection concentration would be the most favorable area for ore mineralization if favorable host rocks are also present. These highly fractured areas would act as conduits for carrying the ore forming solutions to the site of deposition in a favorable host rock. Two of the six areas of high intersection concentration are over areas of present or past mining camps and small claims are known to exist near the others. These would be prime target areas for future mineral exploration...|$|R
