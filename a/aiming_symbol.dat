40|$|Object {{identification}} problems aim to distinguish, {{to recognize}} {{in a computer}} system <b>symbols</b> <b>aiming</b> at representing the same individual entity in the world modeled in the system. These problems acquired a new importance due to the web, especially in the so-called web of objects, where, for instance, one wants to gather all available information concerning the same entity. Most solutions of object identification problems are based on classification techniques. Recently, logical approaches using knowledge representation techniques have been introduced and combinations of these two kinds of methods have been developed. In this paper we present such a mixed method for the semi-automatic identification of an author in a authority catalog from a bibliographic metadata.

A relational indexing strategy <b>aims</b> to retrieve <b>symbol</b> locations into the target documents by using a combined numerical-relational description of 2 D structures.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the relationship between}} the use of religious iconography related to eroticism by Spanish punk artists, and the gender stereotyping that the appropriation of these <b>symbols</b> <b>aims</b> to destabilize. The desire to shock and disturb the audience places these artists {{in a position where they}} have to challenge established values, such as religious and identity ones. There are many examples of male punk bands that openly rebel against organized religion, but the critique of these bands is direct, whereas women use eroticism to expose the patriarchal strategies of the church, as well as to project an image of themselves that breaks all expectations. Religious iconography becomes the tool for the ironic reevaluation and eventual destruction of cultural and gender structures as part of their artistic program...|$|R

Using an illustrative example of Mère et Enfant, an international NGO operating in Palestine, we show how an individual brought about strategic change by engaging in discursive activity. We use this to outline a model of how discourse can be mobilized as a strategic resource. The model consists of three circuits. First, in circuits of activity individuals attempt to introduce <b>symbols</b> <b>aimed</b> at connecting objects to particular concepts. Second, for circuits of activity to be successful, they must intersect with circuits of performativity i. e. the concept is grounded in a period and context in which it has meaning; the subject position of the enunciator warrants voice; and the symbols used possess receptivity. Third, circuits of connectivity occur when the new discursive statements “take”...|$|R

ABSTRACT SUDARMIN HARUN. Cultural Values in Buginese Traditional Songs (supervised by Burhanuddin Arafah, Marthen L. Manda, and Stanislaus Sandarupa). This study aimed at finding and elaborating: (1) the cultural symbols, their kinds, their morphemic, literal, and idiomatic meanings, applied in BTS; (2) the aspect of values and their significant meanings, reflected by the cultural symbols in BTS; (3) The significant meanings and the <b>aims</b> of cultural <b>symbols</b> used by Buginese community, which are still relevant in marriage, inauguration, and political contexts. Methodologically, this study was descriptive-qualitative in its design. The data {{in the form of}} texts and soft data were collected using library research, recordings, and field notes. They were analyzed scientifically using a semiotic theory and supported by literature or sociology of literature, linguistic anthropology or culture, text and context, morphemic, literal/modified, and idiomatic translation, and local interpretation approach with the purpose of developing the theory of symbol. The results of the study show that (1) there are 57 cultural symbols found that symbolize ???Tau-tongeng??? or ???Insan-kamil??????Real-people who have glorious mind: ???malemp?????honest, mapaccing???clean, magetteng???consistent, sipakata??-sipakalebb?????respect and value each other, warani???brave, macca???smart, bijaksana???wise, mag??ma???faithful to God, mapp??sona???resignation, mal??bo???generous, maperr?????thoughtful, matike??????careful, and mapato??????obedient??? in BTS. (2) There are 3 aspects of values found: firstly, ???Philosophical values??? that are: ???honest, clean, consistent, smart, careful, thoughtful, respect, fair, and obedient???, symbolized by 34 cultural symbols.

40|$|A {{causal system}} for {{representing}} a musical stream and generating further expected events is presented. Starting from an auditory front-end which extracts low-level (e. g. spectral shape, MFCC, pitch) and mid-level {{features such as}} onsets and beats, an unsupervised clustering process builds and maintains a set of <b>symbols</b> <b>aimed</b> at representing musical stream events using both timbre and time descriptions. The time events are represented using inter-onset intervals relative to the beats. These symbols are then processed by an expectation module based on Predictive Partial Match, a multiscale technique based on N-grams. To characterise the system capacity to generate an expectation that matches its transcription, we use a weighted average F-measure, {{that takes into account}} the uncertainty associated with the unsupervised encoding of the musical sequence. The potential of the system is demonstrated in the case of processing audio streams which contain drum loops or monophonic singing voice. In preliminary experiments, we show that the induced representation is useful for generating expectation patterns in a causal way. During exposure, we observe a globally decreasing prediction entropy combined with structure-specific variations. ...|$|R

5000|$|At Hammelev Church, on the {{northern}} part of the Djursland peninsula, 5 kilometers north of the town Grenå, there is also a Holter baptismal font. Hammelev Church is built of limestone, and there is lots of middle age graffiti in the outer walls of the nearly 1000 year old masonry. [...] A lot seems to be scratched out <b>symbols</b> <b>aimed</b> at confusing or entraping evil spirits, by use of symbols based on specialized geometries, such as connected circles, that the spirits supposedly could not get out of, or cross, easily. This is also seen with the unbroken twisted circular band of rope surrounding the Holter baptismal fonts at the Rolsø- and Hammelev churches. Rope circles like these are also found on other middle age baptismal fonts made by Holter, seen in churches on Djursland, and maybe also in other parts of Denmark. These middle age artifacts were crafted in times when evil spirits and witches were something one believed in literally, and to such a degree, that the superstition gave way to the burning of women alive, if these people became suspected of practicing witchery.|$|R
5000|$|The third level {{gives the}} most comprehensible {{reading of the}} portal’s composition. Its Christian {{symbolism}} strongly revolves around the Christ’s Passion and the salvation of the human kind deriving from it.

The central motif, of the middle cross representing the Christ’s Passion and the side rosettes representing the two solstices, concentrates the Christian message being often carved on church and house portals. This reading appears now obvious thanks to the elaborate composition from Sârbi Susani. There is an imperative need to document the hundreds of surviving portals left by the church carpenters in the Carpathians, go beyond their decorative beauty and recover their enigmatic language. That would be a great achievement for the European cultural heritage. (Baboș 2004, 189-195) ...|$|R
40|$|Religious {{phenomenon}} {{is a universal}} symptom, unique and full of mystery. Its existence was always traced from prehistoric until modern times. The fact that religious society has been confronted to a collective consciousness, structural adjustment and cultural understanding of religion is a must. Therefore, religion should not {{be placed in a}} subordinate position that associated with social, cultural, economic and politic development. This should be understood as an effort to look back the diversity of public religions. Various religious existences are studied and reviewed holistically with studying their function and relation to other cultural aspects. Religious existence symptoms were assessed with anthropological approach and its unity with other cultural aspects. Anthropology <b>aims</b> to appreciate <b>symbols,</b> norms and society prevailing systems. Religion is a cultural phenomenon. In other word, as a social science, anthropology does not discuss the “actual religion” or sacred dogma. The center of attention is human activity as a cultural phenomenon. This requirement can be interpreted as a response of religious society to the changes that occur rapidly. Religious studies through a more anthropological approach can describe the role of human / religious community in action, so that religion is defined as part of lives (culture) of individuals or groups, which each adherent has authority in understanding the religion and apply it. </p...|$|R

The data were obtained through observation and documentation on facebook satus update. This study showed that there were 47 kinds of symbols that were categorized into 10 symbols. They were 6 kinds of smile symbols (1) ٩(-̮̮̃-̃) ۶, 2) 【ツ】, 3);-), 4) ƪ(˘⌣˘) ʃ, 5) :)), 6) ┌(Â•̃͡⌣Â•̃͡) ʃ), 3 kinds of laugh symbols (1) :d :), 2) :D, 3) (～o￣▽￣) ～o), 10 kinds of sad symbols (1) :'(T_T, 2) :'(, 3) (╯︵╰,), 4) :D), 8 kinds of tired or sleepy symbols (1) (⌣́˛̯⌣̀), 2) (Â¬▂Â¬), 3) (Â¬˛Â¬), 4) ƪ("‾Â¸‾), 5) (Â¬˛ Â¬Â”), 6) =D˘Â•˘, 7) ˘Â•˘=D, 8) (Â¬˛ Â¬Â”) (̾˘̶̀̾̾ ̯˘̶́̾ ̾̾̾'̾̾) ̾), 4 kinds of afraid symbols (1) @. @, 2) v(*. *) ^, 3) :O, 4)), 5 kinds of embarrassed symbols (1) ^_^, 2) >_<, 3) ^^, 4) (˘▿˘ʃƪ) (˘ʃƪ˘), 5) (＾□＾*)), 3 kinds of playful emotion symbols (1) :-P, 2) :/, 3) (︶ω︶)), 1 angel symbols (1) O:)), and the last is 2 kinds of mix symbols (1) ♥ and 2) ☆).

40|$|While {{public opinion}} {{is still trying to}} agree on what ‘belonging to Europe’ exactly means, the European Union’s horizons do not appear to have stabilized. EU {{enlargement}} is often described as an ‘unprecedented adventure’ in terms of its scale and socio-political consequences, but the question of where EU’s borders end is still left unanswered. The linguistic and semiotic analysis of EU discursive practices reveals that no geographical bound has been posed {{to the creation of a}} multinational and polyethnic EU: “The EU is based more on values and political will than on rivers and mountains. The European Union is a political project, and its borders are political” (The European Commission, 2005. 20 Myths and Facts about Enlargement). The unwillingness to formulate precise geographical limits clearly responds to the political need to keep institutional doors open to future aspiring candidates. Enlargement is thus presented in EU texts as an open-ended process of social and political ‘integration’, which gradually replaces the previously widespread concept of European ‘unification’. The mapping of EU identity unfolds as an in fieri project whose futurity is symbolised in EU communication policy by new images and mottos. 	 Taking into account the framework set by studies in Discourse Analysis and Social Semiotics, this paper investigates the linguistic and rhetorical strategies used by the European Union that are conducive to the formation of European identity and citizenship. To this purpose, an analysis of visual and textual material issued by the Community institutions is introduced to uncover the discursive practices used to widen, shape and reformulate the principles of a common European heritage. This emerging and multifarious process of integration is of paramount interest to this study as it gives rise to visual and verbal <b>symbols</b> <b>aimed</b> at promoting a new awareness of what ‘being European’ is all about...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} <b>aimed</b> at analyzing <b>symbols</b> of Pangkak ceremony done by Kangean people. Pangkak is {{a traditional}} ceremony for harvest moment to enrich togetherness and as a thank God ceremony. The ceremony is choosen because this ceremony is almost extinct {{and there is no}} printed document about it. Symbol is something verbal or nonverbal, within a particular language or culture that comes to stand for something else. The problems of this study are: 1) What are the symbols used by Kangean people in Pangkak traditional ceremony? 2) What are the meaning of symbols used in Pangkak traditional ceremony? and 3) What are the relationship between the symbols used by Kangean people in Pangkak traditional ceremony with their general culture? In this study, the researcher used descriptive qualitative research design with ethnographic approach. In the attempt to explore the findings, the researcher used two instruments: observation and interview. The informant is the leader of Pangkak (Pojer). The result of this study show that there are three categories of symbols used in Pangkak ceremony, they are: symbols on traditional uniform, symbols on traditional song, and symbols on traditional dance. The symbols used in Pangkak traditional uniform are: farmer’s hat, and some colors: white, red, and black. Farmer’s hat is a symbol of honor. Besides it is also used as protection from sun light because most of Kangean people are famers who work in rice field. White color is the symbol of pure soul. Most of Kangean people are religious and they keep their pure soul by closing to God. Red color is a symbol of bravery and the color of blood, they protect their right to get independence with their blood. Black is a symbol of power. It means Kangean people are hard workers. The symbols on traditional song are: magic spell, north hill, and young generation. Magic spell is believed as a prayer to get better outcome of harvest, north hill is fertile land, and young generation means spirit. Kangean people maintain their fertile land with spirit. The symbols on traditional dance are turning around and moving around the leader of ceremony. Those symbols mean unity and respect to the leader in their daily life. Those symbols are related to their belief, environtment, and habitual of Kangean people...|$|R
