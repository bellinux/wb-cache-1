It emphasized, {{this issue is}} subject to economical, social-psychological and technical factors. To the maximum extent, quality of weld-fabricated building constructions is affected by observance of requirements for accuracy of size and shapes. Accuracy of size and shapes {{is subject to the}} values of welding deformation resulting from non-uniform heating of work-pieces in the welding process and of welding heat input. The maximum heat input is observed in the process of manual (MMA) welding, the minimum heat input is a feature of mechanized (Mig/Mag) welding). Use of mechanized methods of welding will reduce welding deformation level and improve <b>accuracy</b> <b>to</b> <b>size</b> of construction.

40|$|In thermal {{transformation}} {{processes for}} the production of metal parts of complex shape, shaping tools are frequently used. In die forging as an example, the tools are exposed to high mechanical and thermal loads and therefore subject to heavy wear. For fast feedback directly in the production process the <b>accuracy</b> <b>to</b> <b>size</b> of metal parts produced in such a way is at present frequently checked with groping measuring tools. This is unsatisfactory because of the complex forms, the broad product range and the thermal conditions. A 3 D – measurement system for highest possible flexibility and industrial environment, conceived for this application and based on a 3 D- sensor attached to an industrial robot for positioning is described here. The Structured – Light approach is used, i. e. the sensor consists of one or several CCD- cameras, combined with a programmable line projector. Two different calibration procedures of the line projector system are compared, on the one hand based on a polynomial model with a large number of coefficients, on the other hand based on a model targeted towards the actual optical / physical conditions with a significantly smaller number of coefficients. Finally a procedure for the solution of the Sensor to Hand calibration of the measuring robot is shown.

40|$|The {{development}} of fibers and adhesive systems with high durability has recently {{led to the}} creation of a new repair method of metallic structures, by the use of reinforcing patches made of composite materials. This technique is generally reported as "Composite patch repair " and provides very important advantages compared to the conventional methods of repairs. On the other hand, the technology of induction heating constitutes an innovative approach to achieve the supply of energy for the curing of resins or for the manufacturing of composite materials. Induction heating takes place in the ferromagnetic materials, when these are submitted in periodically varying magnetic field. As a result, eddy currents are induced in the material, producing heat through the Joule phenomenon. In the case of resins, a ferromagnetic material must be imported into the resin, to produce the required heat. This may be achieved by importing a metallic grid in the resin. Moreover, this metallic grid, which remains inside the resin after the curing, may serve as sensor by analyzing its electrostatic properties, thus providing useful information about the structural integrity of the area (e. g. potential increase of the crack below a bonded composite repair). In this paper, it is examined whether the total resistance of the grid’s branches can be translated to deformation. As it has been shown by means of numerical simulation, these measurements can be associated with good <b>accuracy</b> <b>to</b> the <b>size</b> of the crack, using appropriate neural networks...|$|R

One characteristic of human learning is that it employs multiple sources of knowledge, including examples, partial theories, and background knowledge. Markman (Markman, 1989) argues that human learning has a number of inherent biases which aid in the learning of natural concepts. We seek computational biases that can increase the accuracy of learned concepts. We take a broader view of concept learning, namely that of learning multiple concepts instead of learning [...] ...|$|R

Student questionnaire is an effective way from which we can know the student’s evaluation and make use it to improve the education quality. Free text format answer {{can be used to}} obtain in particular the opinion of the students directly. On the other hand, in the field of natural language processing, the various techniques and models for document classification or document clustering problems are developed. By the classification or the clustering for the questionnaire document, it is possible to make groups of students with the similar opinion. When a document set is large-scale, it is shown that good classification accuracy can be achieved in many studies. For a comparatively small-scale document set, the method using the PLSI model studied in recent years is remarkable, and it can achieve good classification <b>accuracy</b> <b>to</b> such small <b>size</b> of documents.

30|$|Though no method exists without limitation, {{there has}} been some recent success {{applying}} optical imaging methods for both nanoscopic localization and quantification in neurons. Stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) have effectively facilitated resolved distributions in neurons (Willig et al. 2006, Dani et al. 2010, Blom et al. 2012). Methods more compatible with live-cell imaging such as universal point accumulation in nanoscale topography (uPAINT) have also been utilized to estimate protein domains in synapses (Nair et al. 2013). Quantification of proteins in neurons has been performed with STED and STORM, generally with the use of immunolabeling techniques, which can result in incomplete labeling, sample modification and loss of measurement <b>accuracy</b> due <b>to</b> antibody <b>sizes</b> (Blom et al. 2011, Nair et al. 2013). Fluorescent proteins (FPs) or dyes directed to specific proteins and organelles have also been applied for live cell imaging (Hein et al. 2008, Shim et al. 2012). An alternative technique utilizing exogenous expression of photoactivatable FPs is known as photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM). It is typically a slower imaging method, but offers high precision without the use of antibodies and provides opportunities for molecular quantification (Greenfield et al. 2009, Scarselli et al. 2013).|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Cell-ID {{positioning}} {{technique is}} usually implemented on cellular networks to locate mobile phones {{according to the}} cell identification code forwarded by the Base Transceiver Station (BTS). The user is then assumed to be located at the same coordinate position as the BTS. However, this simple positioning method, also used in indoor location systems with WiFi or RFID technologies, suffers {{from a lack of}} <b>accuracy</b> due <b>to</b> the <b>size</b> and the density of cells. In this paper we propose an indoor positioning system in underground mine tunnels based on the cell-ID method and the innovative Visible Light Communications (VLC) technology. Unlike previous technologies, it is possible to increase the position accuracy in controlling the number of light sources, i. e. the distribution of overlapping cells. As a result, self-adaptive positioning systems could be developed, where the switch on (or off) of the individual LEDs is determined according to the precision required by the application. We present an analytical model for such systems, based on Euclidean geometry equations. It is shown that the maximum position error in each cell may be fixed to obtain a positioning system with a constant accuracy. Finally, an application of this system is given to locate people or machinery in underground mine tunnels...|$|R

40|$|Many {{simulation}} {{data sets}} are so massive {{that they must}} be distributed among disk farms attached to different computing nodes. The data is partitioned into spatially disjoint sets that are not easily transferable among nodes due to bandwidth limitations. Conventional machine learning methods are not designed for this type of data distribution. Experts mark a training data set with different levels of saliency emphasizing speed rather than <b>accuracy</b> due <b>to</b> the <b>size</b> of the task. The challenge is to develop machine learning methods that learn how the expert has marked the training data so that similar test data sets can be marked more efficiently. Ensembles of machine learning classifiers are typically more accurate than individual classifiers. An ensemble of machine learning classifiers requires substantially less memory than the corresponding partition of the data set. This allows the transfer of ensembles among partitions. If all the ensembles are sent to each partition, they can vote for a level of saliency for each example in the partition. Different partitions of the data set may not have any salient points, especially if the data set has a time step dimension. This means the learned classifier for such partitions can not vote for saliency since they have not been trained to recognize it. In this work, we investigate the performance of different ensembles of classifiers on spatially partitioned data sets. Success is measured by the correct recognition of unknown and salient regions of data points...|$|R

40|$|MSc Dissertation Erasmus Mundus master's {{degree in}} Structural Analysis of Monuments and Historical Constructions (SAHC) In the {{structural}} assessment and retrofitting of historical constructions {{the numerical analysis}} of large masonry structures is a challenging problem. The nonlinear and brittle material properties of masonry present challenges for the analysis and furthermore, make the calculations themselves very demanding in computational terms. In this thesis, masonry structural members with out-of-plane loads are analyzed using a macro-modelling approach with TNO DIANA finite element software. The possibilities and advantages of using shell or solid finite elements are investigated, employing a classical rotating crack model with a fracture energy based linear softening law in tension. The comparison of shell and solid elements is carried out by means of five examples: three planar walls with different boundary conditions loaded with uniformly distributed out-of-plane pressure; a ribbed barrel vault with an asymmetrical vertical load and a four-wall masonry box-structure with mass-proportional lateral load. The results are evaluated in the linear and nonlinear range with respect <b>to</b> <b>accuracy,</b> mesh <b>size</b> dependency, number of integration points through {{the thickness of the}} structure, damage propagation and computational effort, among others.
