Kirk comes out in support of Lucien's life and says that killing him would make the Megans just like humans. Lucien's punishment is to be condemned into limbo for eternity for bringing humans into the Megans' world. While Kirk states that humanity has progressed infinitely since 1691, the Megans ignore his words. At {{the end of the}} trial, Kirk offers his life to save Lucien's and the Megans are so impressed by the captain's gesture that they spare Lucien, <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> Enterprise that they would welcome future human visits to their planet.

25|$|The {{role of the}} fakanau as a praise {{song was}} an {{important}} part of Tuvaluan culture. A composer of a praise song would practice with the performers beforehand, <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> subject of the song so he would have time to gather gifts. After the first performance, the subject would give the gifts to the performers, and would often continue to do so after future performances as well. The fakanau and oga tradition has since died out.|$|E

25|$|The MCG {{is known}} for its great atmosphere, much of which is {{generated}} in the infamous Bay 13, situated almost directly opposite to the members stand. In the late 1980s, the crowd at Bay 13 would often mimic the warm up stretches performed by Merv Hughes. In a 1999 One-Day International, the behaviour of Bay 13 was so bad that Shane Warne, donning a helmet for protection, had to enter the ground from his dressing rooms <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> crowd to settle down at the request of opposing England captain Alec Stewart.|$|E

25|$|Shilts's {{writing was}} admired for its {{powerful}} narrative drive, interweaving personal stories with {{political and social}} reporting. Shilts saw himself as a literary journalist {{in the tradition of}} Truman Capote and Norman Mailer. Undaunted by a lack of enthusiasm for his initial proposal for the Harvey Milk biography, Shilts reworked the concept, as he later said, after further reflection: I read Hawaii by James Michener. That gave me the concept for the book, the idea of taking people and using them as vehicles, symbols for different ideas. I would take the life-and-times approach <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> whole story of the gay movement in this way, using Harvey as the major vehicle.|$|E

Mary refuses to identify Elizabeth's accuser, but Elizabeth surmises accurately {{that it must have}} been Abigail. She implores John to go to court <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> judges that Abigail {{and the rest of the}} girls are pretending.

25|$|Enjoying {{the results}} of one's labour while alive is kriyaman; death before {{enjoyment}} produces sanchita karma or accumulated labour. Enjoying accumulated karma after rebirth is prarbdha. By virtue of sadhana, the effects of kriyaman and sanchita can be wiped out during a life {{but it is not}} possible to erase prarbdha. A person possessed with worldly ambitions is sure to continue the endless journey of birth and death. Jivatma leaves the gross body to travel in the spirit world or pret lok (ghost world). After undergoing karmic effects, it returns to the physical world with a body for the fulfillment of desires from its prior incarnation. How it moves from one world to another is a mystery. Yogis can perceive the mystery <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> past sanskar of jiva.|$|E
