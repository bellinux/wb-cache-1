To begin with, it may be useful to state clearly some fundamental principles, even if they are fairly obvious: 1.

Any system for <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> that is likely to transfer decision-making powers away from certain groups will be resisted by some people in these groups...|$|R

25|$|Acharya later {{returned}} to Berlin {{and over the}} course of the war, was in Stockholm briefly along with Virendranath Chattopadhyaya. In Stockholm in May 1917, Acharya and Chattopadhyaya formed a Propaganda Bureau and later joined by Har Dayal. This bureau worked independently of the Berlin Committee and the German foreign office. The duo are known to have met with K.M. Troionovsky at this time and explained the Indian situation, winning approval from the latter for the Indian cause. The Paris Indian society had been in touch with Russian communists before the Russian revolution. Nicholas Safransky, a Russian bomb expert, is known to have been involved in training the Indian revolutionaries in bomb manufacture and explosives. and Acharya was greatly impressed by the revolution itself, hailed at the time as a watershed in the struggle of colonial people against imperialism. The publication of a manifesto by the Soviet Union declaring support for colonies against imperialism was attractive to the Indian nationalists, who saw Soviet Russia as a future centre for coordinating activities, and also intended Russia to be a channel for Indian nationalists in any peace negotiations. This was also the time that the Swedish government under diplomatic pressure from Britain, gradually was leaning on the Indian propaganda bureau, while relationship of the Berlin committee with the German foreign office was also strained on apprehensions of German imperial designs and over <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds.</b> Chatto and Acharya arranged for Troionovsky to be provided with a large amount of the committee's literature to acquaint the Soviets with the Indian situation when the latter left Stockholm for Petrograd. However, Acharya was ultimately disappointed with the Socialist conference in Stockholm, which in his opinion entirely skirted the issue of the colonies. Towards the end of 1918, Acharya {{returned to}} Berlin along with Chatto.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{exercise}} of assessing {{of research in}} Higher Education in the UK took place in 1986 under the Margaret Thatcher Government. It was conducted by the University Grants Committee under {{the chairmanship of the}} Cambridge mathematician Peter Swinnerton-Dyer. The purpose of the exercise was to determine the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> to UK Universities at a time of tight budgetary restrictions. The committee received submissions of research statements from 37 subject areas ("cost centres") within Universities, along with five selected research outputs. It issued quality rankings labelled [...] "outstanding", [...] "above average", [...] "average" [...] or [...] "below average". The research funding allocated to Universities (called [...] "quality-related" [...] funding) depended on the quality ratings of the subject areas. According to Swinnerton-Dyer, the objective was to establish a measure of transparency to the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> at a time of declining budgets.|$|R
40|$|With public {{expenditure}} under pressure, {{the criteria for}} the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> to scientific research have come under increasing scrutiny. It is sometimes asserted that funds should be focused on applied (ÒusefulÓ) science and technology, rather than pure (ÒuselessÓ) science. I shall argue that this misunderstands the contribution of science to society and the role <b>of</b> public <b>funding.</b> To equate the useful with the applied is to display {{the same level of}} understanding as the child who thinks that the hands are {{the most important part of}} a watch because they are the ones that tell the time. Governments should support basic science because it is economically useful, as well as being part of our culture. This leads to the much more difficult questions of the level at which Government should fund basic science, and criteria for the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> between different fields...|$|R

500|$|Because of {{the rise}} in Ketèlbey's popularity, and in sales of his sheet music, in 1918 he {{became a member of}} the Performing Rights Society. Except for a brief {{interval}} in 1926 when he resigned over a dispute about the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> to its members, he remained a lifelong member. In 1919 he composed the romantic work In the Moonlight, which his publisher considered to be [...] "a work of striking beauty". In the following year he wrote Wedgwood Blue—a gavotte—and In a Persian Market; the latter became one of his more popular works. The musicologist Jonathan Bellman, calling In a Persian Market [...] "immortal", describes it as [...] "an 'intermezzo scene' for band or small orchestra; reprehensibly demeaning or delightfully tacky". The work was not without its critics; the composer and conductor Nicolas Slonimsky quotes the view of a Russian journal that [...] "the suite... had its 'immaculate conception' in imperialistic colonial England. The composer's intention is to convince the listener that all's well in the colonies where beautiful women and exotic fruits mature together, where beggars and rulers are friends, where there are no imperialists, no restive proletarians." [...] In The Musical Times, the pseudonymous reviewer [...] "Ariel" [...] described the work as [...] "naive and inexpensive pseudo-orientalism", which led to heated correspondence in the journal over the following months between the composer and the critic.|$|E
500|$|In August2013, 96AvenueNE was {{extended}} to the east across West Nose Creek and the Canadian Pacific Railway tracks to meet the existing interchange at Deerfoot Trail and Airport Trail.

[...] The project included a controversial $470,000 piece of public art, a [...] tall blue ring called [...] "Travelling Light" [...] that lies {{on the north side of}} 96Avenue between the railway and Nose Creek. [...] Highly visible from Deerfoot, the ring received national attention and was called [...] "awful" [...] by Calgary mayor Naheed Nenshi. [...] The mostly negative feedback prompted Calgary to review its <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> to public art on infrastructure projects. [...] As part of Stoney Trail construction in 2013, Deerfoot Trail was upgraded between the most southerly Bow River crossing north and McKenzie Lake Boulevard. [...] It was widened to six through lanes from Stoney Trail to the Bow River at Calgary's southern limit, and elevated directional ramps were added to the major interchange at Deerfoot and Stoney Trail to support significantly higher traffic levels. [...] A braided ramp was constructed northbound between Cranston Avenue and Stoney Trail, preventing northbound traffic exiting to eastbound Stoney Trail from conflicting with Auburn Bay and Cranston traffic merging onto northbound Deerfoot Trail.|$|E
