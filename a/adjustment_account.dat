Accidents involving commercial vehicles have disastrous consequences; most of the times they result in human fatalities, environmental damage, traffic congestion leading to fuel wastage and associated productivity losses. Moreover, with the rapid increase in the commercial vehicles traffic over the past few years, improved preventive and active measures are necessary to minimize commercial vehicle accidents and to enhance the safety of our roadways. The brake system is one of the critical components in ensuring the safety of the vehicle on the road. In a recent National Traffic Safety Board's (NTSB) heavy truck inspection survey, {{it was found that the}} defects in brakes/brake <b>adjustment</b> <b>account</b> for an average 56 percent of the trucks being declared out of service. Worn brake pads and tires, air leaks at hoses, connections, valves and brake chambers of the airbrake system along with the significant time delay in the actuation of tractor and trailer brakes degrade the vehicle braking and handling performance thereby increasing the potential for fatal accidents. As a result, there is a need for the advanced diagnostic system that monitors the health of air brakes and thus aiding in preventing the accidents. Therefore, the research is to develop a diagnostic algorithm that enhance the preventive safety of the vehicle. This could be accomplished by developing a mathematical model for the air brake system of a commercial vehicle and then utilizing the fault detection algorithms using analytical redundancy in a dynamic system. This could be done by predicting the redundant measurements using some of the reliable sensors and comparing with that of the values from the model. Using the mismatch between these, error residuals can be generated that carry the signature of the health of the airbrake system. The algorithm could also be experimentally implemented and verify their efficacy on an air brake system in the laboratory. The focus of the work that is presented here is to develop a mathematical model of the air brake systems that suits the development of the diagnostic algorithm and also to set up a test bench for the experiments...|$|E

40|$|Essay 1 : Self-Control and Altruism: The Moderating Role of Endowments. People {{exhibit a}} {{remarkable}} ability {{to cooperate with}} one another, to an extent that critically distinguishes human society from communities of other primate and animal species. Although altruism plays {{an essential role in}} sustaining cooperation among unrelated groups of individuals, {{little is known about the}} underlying psychological processes that drive altruistic behavior. While evidence supporting conflicting dual process accounts has appeared in the literature, here we offer an anchoring and <b>adjustment</b> <b>account</b> that clarifies the mechanistic relationship between self-control and the tendency towards altruism or selfishness. We find that participants depleted of self regulatory resources are highly biased by initial endowments and insufficiently adjust away from them when making transfer decisions. Thus, depending on the nature of the initial endowments, individuals may reveal either increased altruism or increased selfishness under self-regulatory depletion. Essay 2 : Relative to Them: How Better Brands Reduce Product Efficacy. Across many domains, positive beliefs often lead to self-fulfilling positive outcomes. Here however, we find the opposite to be true. In a series of four studies, we observe that positive beliefs about products can lead to negative performance outcomes in using them when social comparison processes are activated. Although people appear to believe that high status branded products are of superior quality and are willing to pay more for them, these beliefs in fact lead people to evaluate their own expected performance relative to a higher standard of reference. Our findings suggest that when people contrast themselves to these higher reference points, they form negative expectations about their own performance that result in increased levels of intimidation and in turn, reduced product efficacy. Essay 3 : Altruistic Patience: When Giving More Beats Giving Now. People are known to take into account the welfare of others when making decisions. Many of these settings also involve tradeoffs in the benefits that others receive at different points in time. For example, donors make decisions between giving to those in immediate need and funding longer-term projects, policy makers impact their constituents by responding to immediate concerns and also supporting larger efforts for reform, and even friends face the perennial gift-giving problem in picking either short lived novelties or necessities that will last. This work identifies a bias in the intertemporal choices that people make when the consequences of those choices are not directly experienced by the decision maker. In particular, I find that people appear to be more patient when conferring benefits to others rather than themselves and that this bias is driven by both relaxed time sensitivity and by diagnostic motivations. by Sachin Banker.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 This study {{investigates the}} spatial and {{temporal}} variability of surface air temperature (SAT) in the instrumental record of climate, emphasizing the detection of SAT change {{in the presence of}} natural variability as well as the attribution of SAT variability and trends to atmospheric circulation changes, as reflected in fluctuations in sea-level pressure (SLP) teleconnection patterns. In order to better understand the magnitude and significance of SAT trends observed over land during the 20 th Century, we identify and characterize the background variability on time scales of days to decades. The magnitude of day-to-day and month-to-month SAT variability exhibits a pattern of polar amplification, particularly during the boreal cold season. The ratio of extratropical to tropical variability is approximately 4 : 1 on daily to monthly time scales, decreasing to about 2 : 1 on the time scale of several decades. Similarly, it is suggested that variability on the order of the length of the instrumental record exhibits an extratropical to tropical ratio of approximately 2 : 1. It follows that despite polar amplifications, global warming is more clearly distinguishable from the background variability in the tropics than at high latitudes. The ecological impacts of global warming are also likely to be larger in the tropics. We employ a variety of statistical methods to estimate the fraction of Northern Hemisphere cold season SAT variability that is attributable to fluctuations in atmospheric circulation patterns. These methods each yield a dynamical adjustment to SAT fields to account for the influence of patterns in dynamical fields on local SAT variability. After comparing a set of seven statistical approaches, we argue that when applied in a pointwise manner, partial least squares regression provides the most parsimonious and statistically robust dynamical adjustment. The dynamical adjustment accounts for approximately 50 % of the variance of NH cold season SAT. Changes in the NH cold season circulation patterns encompassed by the dynamical <b>adjustment</b> <b>account</b> for approximately 0. 7 °C of the 1. 7 °C of warming observed poleward of 40 °N during the historical reference interval 1965 - 2000, and approximately 0. 5 °C of the 1. 6 °C warming observed over the same area during the period 1920 - 2010, reconciling much of the spatial and seasonal differences in SAT trends observed regionally and globally. Our analysis yields a dynamically adjusted SAT field; this provides a dataset capable of being analyzed for residual variability and trends associated with thermodynamic and radiative phenomena. The circulation patterns that influence local SAT variability are closely associated with the dominant patterns of NH wintertime SLP variability. Whereas previous descriptions of the dominant patterns of NH wintertime SLP variability have been limited to just a few patterns, we provide evidence that there exists a set of 6 - 9 reproducible NH wintertime teleconnection patterns that are robust with respect to the choice of analysis method and to the background climatology on which they are imposed. The leading three patterns are hemispheric to continental in scale. The higher order patterns are synoptic to continental in scale, limited to specific regions. Although the hemispheric patterns have a broader influence, the regional patterns contribute equally to local climate impacts...|$|E
