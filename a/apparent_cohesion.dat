These parameters are then used in computer models to predict how the material will behave in a larger-scale engineering application.

50|$|Four {{main points}} to be {{considered}} in determining if soil nailing would be an effective retention technique are as follows. First, the existing ground conditions should be examined. Next, the advantages and disadvantages for a soil nail wall should be assessed for the particular application being considered. Then other systems should be considered for the particular application. Finally, cost of the soil nail wall should be considered. Soil nail walls can be used for a variety of soil types and conditions. The most favorable conditions for soil nailing are as follows: The soil should be able to stand unsupported one to two meters high for a minimum of two days when cut vertical or nearly vertical. Also all soil nails within a cross section should be located above the groundwater table. If the soil nails are not located above the groundwater table, the groundwater should not negatively affect the face of the excavation, the bond between the ground and the soil nail itself. Based upon these favorable conditions for soil nailing stiff to hard fine-grained soils which include stiff to hard clays, clayey silts, silty clays, sandy clays, and sandy silts are preferred soils. Sand and gravels which are dense to very dense soils with some <b>apparent</b> <b>cohesion</b> also work well for soil nailing. Weathered rock is also acceptable as long as the rock is weathered evenly throughout (meaning no weakness planes). Finally, glacial soils work well for soil nailing.|$|E

40|$|The {{document}} attached {{has been}} archived {{with permission from}} the copyright holder. It is well understood that vegetation influences slope stability in two ways: through hydrological effects and mechanical effects. Hydrological effects involve the removal of soil water by evapotranspiration through vegetation, which {{lead to an increase}} in soil suction or a reduction in pore-water pressure, hence, an increase in the soil shear strength. The shear strength of the soil is also increased through the mechanical effects of the plant root matrix system. The density of the roots within the soil mass and the root tensile strength contribute to the ability of the soils to resist shear stress. The effects of soil suction and root reinforcement has been quantified as an increase in <b>apparent</b> soil <b>cohesion.</b> This paper investigates the effects of vegetation on the stability of slopes using the finite element method. Two key vegetation-dependent parameters have been incorporated in the finite element slope stability analysis, namely, <b>apparent</b> root <b>cohesion</b> (cR) and depth of root zone (hR).

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} loss of <b>apparent</b> <b>cohesion</b> from rainwater infiltration upon the stability of partly saturated, allophanic soil slopes of Dominica (West Indies). The parent material of the Dominican allophanic soils are the andesitic and dacitic volcanic rocks from ten volcanic centres of mainly Pleistocene age. Although simplifying assumptions are made to assess the depth of wetting front and magnitudes of true and <b>apparent</b> <b>cohesion</b> values of the partly saturated allophanic soils, certain inferences of practical significance emerge from the study. Matric suction contributes to the effective stress of unsaturated soils and increases the shear strength of these soils by imparting them an <b>apparent</b> <b>cohesion</b> strength component. This <b>apparent</b> <b>cohesion</b> strength component of the partly saturated Dominican allophanic soils {{is considered to be}} related to the matric suction term (u(a) -u(w)) by a parabolic relationship. The partly saturated allophanic soil slopes of Dominica would invariably fail from loss of <b>apparent</b> <b>cohesion</b> upon saturation of the soil mantle by the infiltrating water front only if (a) the average slope angle (beta) is greater than or equal to the drained shear strength parameter of the unsaturated soil (phi(d)) (slopes with beta greater than or equal to phi(d) are referred to as category 1 slopes in this study) and (b) the drained cohesion parameter (c(d)) belonging to the partly saturated soil of the category 1 slope is mainly contributed by matric suction induced <b>apparent</b> <b>cohesion</b> (c(app)) and contribution from true cohesion (c') is absent. However, the possibility of the category 1 slopes (for the case 1 situation) failing in the saturated condition from effective stress reduction due to rise in ground water table is shown to be an unfeasible proposition. In contrast, for the case 1 situation, the partly saturated category 2 slopes (beta<phi(d)) are insusceptible to failure from reduction in effective stress due to loss of matric suction but fail in the saturated condition from effective stress reduction due to rise in ground water table. If the allophanic soils were to possess a sufficient magnitude of true cohesion (c'), even the partly saturated category 1 slopes possessing slope angles (beta) much in excess of their phi(d) values (beta-phi(d) = 15. 1 degrees) would remain stable upon total elimination of the matric suction induced cohesion. However, partly saturated category 1 slopes possessing a true cohesion component and insusceptible to failure from reduction in effective stress upon loss of matric suction, invariably fail in the saturated condition from reduction in effective stress due to rise in ground water table.

40|$|Effects of {{vegetation}} in improving slope stability can be recognized on both hydrological and mechanical mechanisms.

40|$|It is very {{important}} to study applications of unsaturated soil properties in slope stability analysis due to the additional shear strength an unsaturated soil possesses. Shear strength of an unsaturated soil is strongly related to the amount of water in the voids of the soil, and therefore to the matric suction. It is postulated that the shear strength of an unsaturated soil should also bear a relationship to the soil-water characteristic curve. In this thesis, the effect of unsaturated shear strength properties on stability of slopes is investigated by analysing for the stability of hypothetical cut slopes. The effect of the position of water table below the failure surface of hypothetical cut slopes were analysed using Slope/w software for different water table positions for three different cut slope angles.

Here, we examine an artificial slope's subsurface hydrology and propose a new slope stability analysis that includes seepage force and the down-slope transfer of excess shear forces. We measured pore water pressure and volumetric water content immediately prior to a shallow landslide on an artificial sandy slope of 32 °: The direction of the subsurface flow shifted from downward to parallel to the slope in the deepest part of the landslide mass, and this shift coincided with the start of soil displacement. A slope stability analysis that was restricted to individual segments of the landslide mass could not explain the initiation of the landslide; however, inclusion of the transfer of excess shear forces from up-slope to down-slope segments improved drastically the predictability. The improved stability analysis revealed that an unstable zone expanded down-slope {{with an increase in}} soil water content, showing that the down-slope soil initially supported the unstable up-slope soil; destabilization of this down-slope soil was the eventual trigger of total slope collapse. Initially, the effect of <b>apparent</b> soil <b>cohesion</b> was the most important factor promoting slope stability, but seepage force became the most important factor promoting slope instability closer to the landslide occurrence.

The mechanisms by which roots increase <b>apparent</b> soil <b>cohesion</b> is well documented and many values of root additional cohesion {{are available in the}} literature for different plant species. However, less information is given about the spatial variation of soil reinforcement by roots at a slope scale and its influence on slope stability, in particular in forest areas. The goal {{of this paper is to}} describe the spatial variability of root additional cohesion on two monospecific 17 -y-old stands of Robinia pseudoacacia and Platycladus orientalis grown on slopes in the semiarid Loess Plateau of China, and to analyze numerically the effect of this variability on slopes stability. For this purpose, vertical trenches were dug at different distance and directions around trees situated at three different slope locations, i. e. up-, mid- and down-slope. Grids with a 10 × 10 cm mesh were placed on vertical walls. Roots were counted within each grid cell and split according to their diameter class. Root area ratio (RAR) was estimated and compared among different positions around the trees and at three different locations along the slope. Roots tensile strength was determined with laboratory mechanical tests. RAR and root tensile strength were used as inputs in six different root reinforcement models to calculate root additional cohesion. A 2 D finite element model of slope stability was developed and used to calculate the increase in factor of safety (FoS) due to root additional cohesion on rectilinear and terraced slopes. Results showed that both root tensile strength and Young's modulus of R. pseudoacacia was about two times higher than tensile strength of P. orientalis. RAR distribution had a strong relationship with local soil moisture content measured in July during the raining season, and was significantly different with regards to tree location on the slope. The six theoretical models used to estimate the root additional cohesion gave different vertical profiles of root reinforcement distribution according to the underlying hypothesis on how forces are transferred to the roots. Theoretical analyses of slope stability showed that terraced slopes were 20 % more stable than rectilinear slopes, disregarding the differences in hydrological regimes between these two terrain morphologies. Numerical sensitivity analyses also showed that the FoS reached an asymptotic value when increasing root additional cohesion. Actual additional cohesions of the two studied sites corresponded to FoS that were already close to this asymptotic values. Consequently variations of these actual root cohesions would not much affect slope stability.

Moisture content in post-consumer container glass can cause the glass to clump together and adhere to screening equipment, inhibiting proper screening, and resulting in glass that is out of size specifications for the application. Understanding efficient glass drying technologies and protocols is essential in meeting fine-sizing requirements when processing recycled glass. Best Practice: Glass bottles and containers typically contain moisture when they arrive at the material recovery facility (MRF). The moisture is from food residue and exposure to precipitation during collection or stockpiling. Although coarse glass generally drains and flows very easily, with little <b>apparent</b> <b>cohesion,</b> reducing the particle size of the cullet increases the overall surface area, resulting in much greater <b>apparent</b> <b>cohesion.</b> It may seem like a paradox that while coarse glass used as construction aggregate {{has been shown to be}} very permeable, finely crushed glass retains moisture extremely well. This may be because the large particles of coarse glass have no pockets to hold moisture, and drain freely. In finer grades, however, the close packing of the particles results in the surface tension of the water holding th...|$|E
40|$|Stone column {{could be}} used as a ground {{improvement}} technique where a portion of the soil is replaced with granular material such as crushed rocks or sand which is proven to increase bearing capacity and accelerate the dissipation of pore water pressure. Since "bottom ash", as the waste of coal burning, possesses similar properties to sand, there is a potential of using bottom ash as stone columns. This paper discusses the results of the improvement in shear strength parameters of clay when reinforced with single and group bottom ash columns (BAC). A total of 39 specimens of kaolin samples were isotropically consolidated and sheared using Consolidated Undrained Triaxial Tests with pore pressure measurement to determine the shear strength parameters. Test variables include the diameter and height of columns and effective confining pressure. Results indicate that the installation of BAC in clay specimens increased the <b>apparent</b> <b>cohesion</b> but did not show any significant difference in the effective friction angle. Generally, the <b>apparent</b> <b>cohesion</b> of soft clay reinforced with partially penetrating columns is higher than that of fully penetrating columns. It is also found that during consolidation, the dissipation of pore water pressure was accelerated with the presence of BAC. Hence, it can be concluded that the consolidation and shear strength of soft clay could be improved by the installation of BAC...|$|E
40|$|Land {{degradation}} due to deforestation, {{erosion and}} landslides {{is one of}} the major challenges of the 21 st century. Particularly in Africa, where awareness about the problem is low, it reaches an alarming level. The root cause of land degradation is deforestation due to rapid population growth and ever increasing demands for farm land, fire wood, charcoal, timber and other subsistence needs. To alleviate the problem and to transform the livelihoods of the population, one of the sub-Saharan countries, Ethiopia, is expanding the number of hydroelectric power plants. Currently, Gilgel Gibe I is the largest hydroelectric dam in the country, and its power plant contributes 29 % of the country’s electric energy demand. However, it was estimated that the volume of Gilgel Gibe reservoir will reduce by half within 12 years due to siltation, while the design life span was expected to be 50 - 70 years (Devi et al., 2008, Bioresource Technology: 99 : 975 – 979). Gullies, unstable riverbanks and landslides are identified to be major sources of the suspended sediment that is transported to the reservoir of Gilgel Gibe I dam. One of the measures to control soil erosion and the ensuing sedimentation of reservoirs is plantation of trees, shrubs and grasses along areas that are susceptible to erosion. Vegetation can stabilize riverbanks, landslides and gullies by roots; roots increase the <b>apparent</b> soil <b>cohesion</b> by binding the soil together and by decreasing the soil matric potential. Vegetation can moreover protect river banks and gully bottoms by reducing the water flow velocity. However, which approach and which species is most suited to tackle the problems depends on the agro-ecological conditions of the region, the socio-economic benefit of the species, and its acceptability by the local community. The objective of this research is therefore, to develop a comprehensive methodology for selecting plant species that are most suitable for stabilizing riverbanks, landslides or gullies in humid tropical regions based on an integrated assessment of shoot and root architecture, and mechanical and hydrological plant properties. To achieve the intended objective, experiments are undertaken on selected multipurpose trees, shrubs and grasses to identify easy-to-measure plant characteristics that are most suited to assess the suitability of a species for increasing the <b>apparent</b> soil <b>cohesion</b> and for reducing flow velocities. Existing conceptual or mechanistic models will be used to assess the relative importance of mechanical and hydrological effects of vegetation for stabilizing a given sediment source type and thus to make an integrated assessment of the effectiveness of a species. Multicriteria methods will be adapted to select the most suitable vegetation type and species for a specific sediment source, taking into account both its effectiveness for stabilization, ease of establishment and benefits/acceptability to local communities.

40|$|This {{technical}} note proposes a simple analytical model for predicting the shear strength behavior of fiber-reinforced granular soils under high confining stresses, {{where it can}} be assumed that pullout of fibers does not take place. The model presents an analytical expression derived from the force-equilibrium consideration incorporating several significant parameters describing the characteristics of the granular soil and the fibers, such as fiber content, aspect ratio, modulus of elasticity of fibers, specific gravity of fiber material, soil-fiber friction, initial orientation with respect to shear plane, normal confining stress, specific gravity of soil particles, angle of shearing resistance of soil, and void ratio of soil. The expression shows that inclusion of fibers in the granular soil induces cohesion, may be called <b>apparent</b> <b>cohesion,</b> as well as increase in normal stress on the shear failure plane, which are proportional to the fiber content and aspect ratio, implying that increase in shear strength is also proportional to the fiber content and aspect ratio. The results based on this model are discussed for some specific range of parameters in their practical ranges. It is observed that the increase in shear strength of the granular soil due to the presence of fibers is significantly contributed by the <b>apparent</b> <b>cohesion,</b> and the contribution to the shear strength from the increase in normal stress is limited. The model shows that the increase in shear strength follows the trends of variation as reported in some previous works...|$|E
