5|$|Jack and David are billeted together. Their tent mate is Cadet White, {{but their}} {{acquaintance}} {{is all too}} brief; White is killed in an air crash the same day. Undaunted, the two men endure a rigorous training period, where they go from being enemies to best friends. Upon graduating, they <b>are</b> <b>shipped</b> off to France to fight the Germans.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) {{decides to}} revamp her {{wardrobe}} after her separation from Roy Anderson and ordered some new clothes. When Pam's clothes <b>are</b> <b>shipped</b> to the office, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) insists that Pam perform a lunchtime fashion show {{to show off}} a new blouse. When it draws unwanted attention, Pam concludes {{that it is too}} revealing.|$|E
5|$|Individuals of the Asian {{species have}} been often trained as working animals. In the forests of Myanmar, for example, {{elephants}} have {{played a critical role}} in sustainable logging. Under the guidance of their handlers, elephants are used to manipulate and drag heavy teak logs from road-less areas to rivers and roads. From there, the valuable logs <b>are</b> <b>shipped</b> to commercial mills.|$|E

Nintendo reports 66.12million {{units have}} <b>been</b> <b>shipped</b> worldwide, of which 21.63 million <b>were</b> <b>shipped</b> to Japan, 20.11 million <b>were</b> <b>shipped</b> to the Americas, and 18.05 million <b>were</b> <b>shipped</b> to other territories {{including}} Europe.|$|R
25|$|Twenty EUV units <b>were</b> <b>shipped</b> in 2010–2016, {{short of}} the number that would be {{required}} for volume manufacturing. By comparison, ASML shipped over 60 NXT 193-nm immersion systems in 2016, and forecasts that 48 EUV units will <b>be</b> <b>shipped</b> in 2019. Six NXE:3100 units <b>were</b> <b>shipped</b> in 2010–2011. Eight NXE:3300B units <b>were</b> <b>shipped</b> in 2013Q3–2015Q1, fewer than the forecast 11 units.

5|$|The main {{industries}} on Mersea are farming, {{fishing and}} servicing the leisure boating and yachting industry. Oysters have been harvested {{off the island}} since Roman times, and <b>are</b> <b>shipped</b> worldwide. The extensive history and association with the oyster trade attracts {{a significant number of}} tourists each year, though today the trade is predominantly with Pacific oysters that have been introduced to the area. The Essex oyster fishery is opened by the Mayor of Colchester every September.|$|E
5|$|The {{recycling}} {{facility and}} museum was constructed for {{a cost of}} $5 million and opened in 1993. Funding for the museum was provided through a group of 19 local municipalities, known as the Southwest Connecticut Recycling Committee, which transported recyclables to the facility for processing. The museum {{was part of an}} active recycling operation that allows visitors to follow the recyclable materials through the sorting processes to the crushing and baling process before they <b>are</b> <b>shipped</b> to processors to be recycled into new products. The museum was overseen and operated by the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority.|$|E
5|$|The target chamber is a two-wall {{structure}} {{filled with}} liquid lithium or a lithium alloy between the walls. The lithium captures neutrons from the reactions to breed tritium, and also {{acts as the}} primary coolant loop. The chamber is filled with xenon gas that would slow the ions from the reaction as well as protect the inner wall, or first wall, from the massive x-ray flux. Because the chamber is not highly pressurized, like a fission core, {{it does not have}} to be built as a single sphere. Instead, the LIFE chamber is built from eight identical sections that include built-in connections to the cooling loop. They <b>are</b> <b>shipped</b> to the plant and bolted together on two supports, and then surrounded by a tube-based space frame.|$|E
5000|$|According to the Kansas City Kansan:"In {{the heyday}} year of 1923, 2,631,808 cattle were {{received}} at the Kansas City yards. Of these, 1,194,527 were purchased {{for use in}} Kansas City by the packing houses and local markets; the remainder or about 55 percent <b>was</b> <b>shipped</b> out. Of 2,736,174 hogs received, 879,031 <b>were</b> <b>shipped</b> out; of 377,038 calves, 199,084 <b>were</b> <b>shipped</b> out; of 1,165,606 sheep, 445,539 <b>were</b> <b>shipped</b> and of 42,987 horses and mules, all but 1,664 <b>were</b> <b>shipped</b> out." ...|$|R
50|$|Over 500 cattle <b>were</b> <b>shipped</b> {{from the}} station in 1932 aboard the Centaur from the port in Derby. A further 883 {{bullocks}} <b>were</b> <b>shipped</b> on the Minderoo to Port Hedland in 1935 then another 454 <b>were</b> <b>shipped</b> in 1936 also aborad the Centaur and bound for Carnarvon. A shipment of 526 cattle <b>were</b> <b>shipped</b> from Gogo in 1937 aboard the Centaur, with another 422 sent in 1938 aboard the Charon and 450 sent from Derby aboard the Gordon bound for Fremantle.|$|R

5|$|With {{fewer than}} 800 {{people on the}} island at any time, {{facilities}} are limited; they include a bakery, butcher, general store, liquor store, restaurants, post office, museum and information centre, a police officer, a ranger, and an ATM at the bowling club. Stores <b>are</b> <b>shipped</b> to the island fortnightly by the Island Trader from Port Macquarie. There is a small four-bed hospital and dispensary. A small botanic garden displays labelled local plants in its grounds. Diesel-generated power is 240 volts AC, as on the mainland. There is no public transport or mobile phone coverage, but there are public telephones, fax facilities and internet access {{as well as a}} local radio station and newsletter, The Signal.|$|E
5|$|Prized for its {{meat and}} fins, the {{porbeagle}} {{has long been}} under heavy fishing pressure. The meat is sold fresh, frozen, or dried and salted, and ranks among the most valuable of any shark: in 1997 and 1998 it had a wholesale price of EUR 5–7/kg, four {{times that of the}} blue shark (Prionace glauca). Most of the demand comes from Europe, though the United States and Japan also import this species. The fins <b>are</b> <b>shipped</b> to East Asia for use in shark fin soup. The remainder of the shark may also be utilized, for production of leather, liver oil, and fishmeal. International trade in the porbeagle appears to be significant, but remains unquantified as shark products tend not to be reported to the species level, and many consist of a mix of various species. This shark is caught most readily on longlines, but is also susceptible to gillnets, driftnets, trawls, and handlines. It is valuable enough to be generally retained when caught as bycatch; if storage space cannot be spared it may be finned and the carcass discarded.|$|E
5|$|The {{synaptic}} tag hypothesis {{may also}} account for LTP's associativity and cooperativity. Associativity (see Properties) is observed when one synapse is excited with LTP-inducing stimulation while a separate synapse is only weakly stimulated. Whereas {{one might expect}} only the strongly stimulated synapse to undergo LTP (since weak stimulation alone is insufficient to induce LTP at either synapse), both synapses will in fact undergo LTP. While weak stimuli are unable to induce protein synthesis in the cell body, they may prompt the synthesis of a synaptic tag. Simultaneous strong stimulation of a separate pathway, capable of inducing cell body protein synthesis, then may prompt the production of plasticity-related proteins, which <b>are</b> <b>shipped</b> cell-wide. With both synapses expressing the synaptic tag, both would capture the protein products resulting in the expression of LTP in both the strongly stimulated and weakly stimulated pathways.|$|E

5|$|After trucks {{became popular}} in the 1910s, the Omaha Stockyards grew exponentially. Cattle, hogs and sheep <b>were</b> <b>shipped</b> cheaper by truck than by trains. In 1919 27% of {{livestock}} at the Stockyards <b>was</b> <b>shipped</b> by truck; by 1940's it rose to over 75%. In 1955 the Stockyards became the biggest livestock distribution center in the United States, {{and almost all of}} the cattle <b>was</b> <b>shipped</b> by truck.|$|R
50|$|While {{manufactured}} in Sweden, the Snow Trac {{proved to be}} a successful export and approximately 550 Snow Tracs <b>were</b> <b>shipped</b> to Alaska. At least 200 units <b>were</b> <b>shipped</b> to Canadian telephone utility Northwest Telephone in the Yukon Territory, Canada. Approximately 200 Snow Tracs ended up at the Canadian National Railway, and Snow Tracs were also located at each of the microwave sites {{along the length of the}} ALCAN (Alaska Canadian Highway). At least 400 more Snow Tracs were known to have <b>been</b> <b>shipped</b> to the Lower 48 states of the United States. At least 200 were known to have <b>been</b> <b>shipped</b> to Scotland.|$|R
