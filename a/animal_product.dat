5|$|Some {{processes}} {{convert a}} meat or dairy product into a pareve (neither meat nor dairy) one. For example, rennet is sometimes made from stomach linings, yet is acceptable for making kosher cheese, but such cheeses {{might not be}} acceptable to some vegetarians, who would eat only cheese made from a vegetarian rennet. The same applies to kosher gelatin, an <b>animal</b> <b>product,</b> derived from kosher animal sources. Other gelatin-like products from non-animal sources such as agar agar and carrageenan are pareve by nature. Fish gelatin is derived from fish and is therefore (like all kosher fish products) pareve. Eggs are also considered pareve despite being an <b>animal</b> <b>product.</b>|$|E

25|$|Vegans may avoid {{clothing}} that incorporates silk, wool (including lambswool, shearling, cashmere, angora, mohair, {{and a number}} of other fine wools), fur, feathers, pearls, animal-derived dyes, or leather, snakeskin, or any other kind of skin or <b>animal</b> <b>product.</b> Most leather clothing is made from cow skins. Vegans regard the purchase of leather, particularly from cows, as financial support for the meat industry. Vegans may wear clothing items and accessories made of non-animal-derived materials, such as hemp, linen, cotton, canvas, polyester, synthetic leather (pleather), rubber, or vinyl. Leather alternatives can come from materials, such as cork, piña(from pineapples), and mushroom leather.|$|E
25|$|Pets have a {{considerable}} environmental impact, especially {{in countries where}} they are common or held in high densities. For instance, the 163 million dogs and cats kept in the United States consume about 20% {{of the amount of}} dietary energy that humans do and an estimated 33% of the animal-derived energy. They produce about 30% ± 13%, by mass, as much feces as Americans, and through their diet, constitute about 25–30% of the environmental impacts from animal production in terms of the use of land, water, fossil fuel, phosphate, and biocides. Dog and cat <b>animal</b> <b>product</b> consumption is responsible for release of up to 64 ± 16 million tons CO2-equivalent methane and nitrous oxide, two powerful greenhouse gasses. Americans are the largest pet owners in the world, but pet ownership in the US has considerable environmental costs.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{proposed}} that the consumption of farmed <b>animal</b> <b>products</b> must be curtailed to reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. This paper argues that a careful assessment of the different emissions produced by different actual and potential diets is needed to evaluate whether or not restricting the consumption of farmed <b>animal</b> <b>products</b> could reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and if so, by how much. It is also argued {{that the question of}} whether or not the consumption of farmed <b>animal</b> <b>products</b> should be restricted must be addressed in the light of information derived from various sustainability indicators, rather than on the basis of a narrow focus on greenhouse gas emissions. A case study from the UK is used to develop a broader understanding of how dietary modifications might reduce a range of problems associated with the consumption of farmed <b>animal</b> <b>products.</b> It is argued that even more comprehensive studies of the different Global Health Impacts (GHIs) are needed to assess the merits and demerits associated with the consumption of farmed <b>animal</b> <b>products.</b> <b>Animal</b> <b>products</b> Climate change Diet Ecological footprint Ethics...|$|R

2500|$|In {{cases of}} skin irritation, wounds and headaches, fresh {{vegetation}} was {{often used in}} the form of plasters applied directly to the skin. [...] Plasters were also rubbed on the skin to shield spirits. Depending on the ailment, plants were boiled and used in herbal drinks and/or baths, eaten raw, snorted, smoked, or inserted into one of the body’s orifices. Common plants used for medicine include, but are not limited to, chili peppers, cacao, tobacco, agave, and the pitarilla tree. In addition, animal parts, such as those from the crocodile, insects, fish and birds were combined into the herbal concoctions. In most cases, a mixture of plant and <b>animal</b> <b>product</b> was prepared to cure a specific ailment.|$|E

30|$|Protection against {{biological}} material entering {{a country or region}} through airports is important because, through them, infectious agents can quickly reach exotic destinations and be disseminated. Illegal <b>products</b> of <b>animal</b> origin may contain hazardous infectious agents that can compromise animal and public health. The {{aim of this}} study was to identify associations between possession of illegal <b>animal</b> <b>products</b> in baggage and demographic characteristics of the passengers, as well as characteristics of their travel plans in the two main Brazilian international airports. A total of 457 passengers were divided into two groups: passengers identified as carrying illegal <b>animal</b> <b>products</b> and control. Passengers identified as carrying illegal <b>animal</b> <b>products</b> not stated on the accompanied baggage declaration completed a questionnaire, to aid in profiling. Nationality, origin, age and residency of passengers were analyzed using chi square, logistic regression and odds ratios. Passengers from Eastern Europe were the most likely to enter with <b>animal</b> <b>products</b> as were those aged between 35 and 55  years. When evaluating the departure point, the highest frequency was seen in those coming from Portugal. Passenger group, reasons for travel, amount and type of baggage were available only for passengers identified as carrying illegal <b>animal</b> <b>products,</b> noting that they prefer traveling alone, for leisure, bringing few bags. Such information can contribute to the early identification of passengers that have illegal <b>animal</b> <b>products</b> in baggage at Brazilian airports.|$|R

40|$|In animal ethics, some ethicists such as Peter Singer {{argue that}} {{we ought not to}} {{purchase}} <b>animal</b> <b>products</b> because doing so causally contributes to unnecessary suffering.

I argue that {{there are at least two}} plausible principles which ground the wrongness of purchasing <b>animal</b> <b>products</b> produced by morally abhorrent means. First, respect for the wishes and dignity of animals who have been wrongly tortured and killed requires treating their losses as losses, and not exploiting the ‘spoils’ of their losses.
