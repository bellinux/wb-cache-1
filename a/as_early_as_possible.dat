Many migratory species use this differential wintering strategy, since it reduces feeding competition between the sexes and enables territorial males to reach the breeding grounds <b>as</b> <b>early</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible,</b> improving their chances of successful mating.

40|$|Introduction: Metallosis is a {{condition}} characterized by an infiltration of periprosthetic soft tissues and bone by metallic debris resulting from wear or failure of joint arthroplasties. Presentation of case: Authors describe {{a case of a}} 45 -year-old man treated for an osteosarcoma of the distal femur with a modular prosthesis when he was 18 years old, he developed massive metallosis with skin dyspigmentation after 17 years. His medical history was remarkable for a left tumoral knee prosthesis implanted 21 years ago. Two years before revision, the patient had a car accident with a two-points prosthesis breakage and despite the surgeon’s advice, the patient refused surgery. In two years, prosthesis malfunction caused a progressive catastrophic soft tissues infiltration of metallic debris. Discussion and conclusion: Authors suggest that if prosthesis fracture is detected, revision surgery should be attempted <b>as</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible...</b>|$|R
