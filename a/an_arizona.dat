40|$|The {{fatty acid}} {{compositions}} of stationary-phase cultures of Arizona arizonae, Citrobacter freundii, Providencia alcalifaciens, Providencia stuartii, and Providencia sp. were studied. The major fatty acids of <b>A.</b> <b>arizonae,</b> C. freundii, and Providencia were 16 : 0, 16 : 1, 17 :cyclopropane, and 19 :cyclopropane.

In both <b>A.</b> <b>arizonae</b> and C. freundii, the relative quantities of saturated, unsaturated, and cyclopropane fatty acids {{were similar to those}} which have been found in stationary-phase cultures of other members of the Enterobacteriaceae. The three strains of Providencia also differed from one another in their fatty acid compositions. In all three strains, the total quantity of unsaturated fatty acids was larger and that of the cyclopropane fatty acids was smaller than those found in stationary-phase cultures of other enteric bacteria...|$|R
5|$|Before {{the release}} of Hang 'Em High, Eastwood had already begun working on Coogan's Bluff, about <b>an</b> <b>Arizona</b> deputy sheriff {{tracking}} a wanted psychopathic criminal (Don Stroud) {{through the streets of}} New York City. He was reunited with Universal Studios for it after receiving an offer of $1million—more than double his previous salary. Jennings Lang arranged for Eastwood to meet Don Siegel, a Universal contract director who later became Eastwood's close friend, forming a partnership that would last more than ten years and produce five films. Shooting began in November 1967, before the script had been finalized. The film was controversial for its portrayal of violence. Coogan's Bluff also became the first collaboration with Argentine composer Lalo Schifrin, who would later compose the jazzy score to several Eastwood films in the 1970s and 1980s, including the Dirty Harry films.|$|E
5|$|The Senators {{struggled}} {{late in the}} 2007–08 season, leading {{general manager}} Bryan Murray to make changes to the team. Both Emery and McGrattan were sent from Ottawa in separate transactions. McGrattan, a pending free agent, {{was traded to the}} Phoenix Coyotes on June 25, 2008, in exchange for a fifth-round draft pick in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft. The Coyotes subsequently signed him to a one-year contract for the 2008–09 season. However, he played only three games with Phoenix before he voluntarily entered the league's substance abuse program. McGrattan's struggles with alcohol abuse reached its lowest point and he spent over two months at <b>an</b> <b>Arizona</b> rehab centre as he worked toward changing his life. He returned to the Coyotes late in the season but played only two additional games before he suffered a shoulder injury that required surgery to repair.|$|E
5|$|After {{kicking off}} {{to start the}} game, Arizona got the ball first in the second half. Their first drive went three-and-out. After a 51-yard punt, Nevada took over at their own 11-yard line. They put {{together}} an 11-play, 89-yard drive that culminated with a 33-yard touchdown pass from Cody Fajardo to Richy Turner. During the course of throwing the touchdown pass, Fajardo hurt his hand and was seen shaking it {{on his way to}} the end zone to celebrate the score. He returned for Nevada's next offensive drive. Arizona's next drive got them into Nevada territory, but an interception thrown by Matt Scott ended any hopes of scoring. Nevada took the field and drove 84 yards down the field on 15 plays. Near the end of the drive once Nevada was inside the 10-yard line, Fajardo ran the ball for a gain of three yards. During the course of the play, he took a hit to the head from <b>an</b> <b>Arizona</b> defender. He exited the game for one play, but subsequently returned on that drive and scored a one-yard rushing touchdown. Arizona was held scoreless in the quarter, and heading into the final quarter of regulation, Nevada possessed a 45-28 lead.|$|E
