5|$|Hypocitraturia: {{the urine}} has an <b>abnormally</b> low {{concentration}} of citrate, which normally helps to dissolve free calcium.|$|E
5|$|Mucinoses are a {{group of}} {{conditions}} caused by dermal fibroblasts producing <b>abnormally</b> large amounts of mucopolysaccharides.|$|E
5|$|Prolactin (PRL) {{plays a role}} in breastfeeding, and {{inability}} to breastfeed may point at <b>abnormally</b> low prolactin levels.|$|E
5|$|<b>Abnormally</b> bright Type Ia supernovae are {{expected}} {{when the white}} dwarf already has a mass higher than the Chandrasekhar limit, possibly enhanced further by asymmetry, but the ejected material will have less than normal kinetic energy.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{and other}} NSAIDs can cause <b>abnormally</b> high {{blood levels of}} {{potassium}} by inducing a hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronic state via inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis; however, these agents do not typically cause hyperkalemia by themselves {{in the setting of}} normal renal function and euvolemic state.|$|E
5|$|Heart: {{cardiomyopathy}} (weakness of {{the heart}} muscle) is a rare but recognized problem in Wilson's disease; it may lead to heart failure (fluid accumulation due to decreased pump function) and cardiac arrhythmias (episodes of irregular and/or <b>abnormally</b> fast or slow heart beat).|$|E
5|$|Other storms were {{individually}} unusual. Hurricanes Elida and Hernan also reached Category5 intensity, {{but neither}} caused any damage. Hurricane Fausto {{had no effect}} on land, but it regenerated into a weak tropical storm at an <b>abnormally</b> high latitude.|$|E
5|$|The chronically low oxygen {{levels in}} the blood also lead to {{increased}} release of erythropoietin and the activation of erythropoeisis, the production of red blood cells. This results in polycythemia, <b>abnormally</b> increased numbers of circulating red blood cells and an elevated hematocrit.|$|E
5|$|The corpse rotted quickly; the {{surgeons}} {{of the hospital}} refused to dissect it. Tessier, however, {{wanted to find out}} how Tarrare differed from the norm internally, and was also curious as to whether the gold fork was actually lodged inside him. At the autopsy, Tarrare's gullet was found to be <b>abnormally</b> wide and when his jaws were opened, surgeons could see down a broad canal into the stomach. His body was found to be filled with pus, his liver and gallbladder were <b>abnormally</b> large, and his stomach was enormous, covered in ulcers and filling most of his abdominal cavity.|$|E
5|$|A {{diagnosis}} of rhabdomyolysis may be suspected in {{anyone who has}} suffered trauma, crush injury or prolonged immobilization, {{but it may also}} be identified at a later stage due to deteriorating kidney function (<b>abnormally</b> raised or increasing creatinine and urea levels, falling urine output) or reddish-brown discoloration of the urine.|$|E
5|$|As {{many as half}} of all Cavalier King Charles Spaniels {{may have}} a {{congenital}} blood disorder called idiopathic asymptomatic thrombocytopenia, an <b>abnormally</b> low number of platelets in the blood, according to recent studies in Denmark and the United States. Platelets, or thrombocytes, are disk-shaped blood elements which aid in blood clotting. Excessively low numbers {{are the most common}} cause of bleeding disorders in dogs. The platelets in the blood of many Cavalier King Charles Spaniels are a combination of those of normal size for dogs and others that are <b>abnormally</b> oversized, or macrothrombocytes. Macrothrombocytosis also is a congenital abnormality found in at least a third of CKCSs. These large platelets function normally, and the typical Cavalier does not appear to experience any health problems due to either the size or fewer numbers of its platelets.|$|E
5|$|Ectropion is {{the outward}} rolling of the eyelid, which <b>abnormally</b> exposes the eye, {{resulting}} in irritation. Because {{of the increased}} exposure, the dog can develop allergic or bacterial conjunctivitis or keratoconjunctivitis sicca also known as dry-eye syndrome. It is most commonly found in breeds with exaggerated facial features such as the Boxer, Bloodhound, Gordon Setter {{as well as the}} English and American Cocker Spaniels, and the English Springer Spaniel.|$|E
5|$|Nora crossed {{an area of}} <b>abnormally</b> {{warm water}} near {{the west coast of}} the Baja California Peninsula. It restrengthened {{slightly}} before making its first landfall near , Baja California Sur, on September 25. When Nora was inland, the area of the storm located in the Gulf of California began to reintensify. Hurricane Nora then made a second landfall about 60 miles (95 km) south-southeast of San Fernando, Baja California.|$|E
5|$|People with Asperger {{syndrome}} {{can display}} behavior, interests, {{and activities that}} are restricted and repetitive and are sometimes <b>abnormally</b> intense or focused. They may stick to inflexible routines, move in stereotyped and repetitive ways, preoccupy themselves with parts of objects or compulsive behaviors like lining objects up to form patterns.|$|E
5|$|The classic {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} in children are loss of appetite, abdominal pain, vomiting, weight loss, constipation, anemia, kidney failure, irritability, lethargy, learning disabilities, and behavioral problems. Slow development of normal childhood behaviors, such as talking and use of words, and permanent intellectual disability are both commonly seen. Although less common, {{it is possible for}} fingernails to develop leukonychia striata if exposed to <b>abnormally</b> high lead concentrations.|$|E
5|$|Thoroughbred {{racehorses}} {{perform with}} maximum exertion, which {{has resulted in}} high accident rates and health problems such as bleeding from the lungs. Other health concerns include low fertility, <b>abnormally</b> small hearts and a small hoof-to-body-mass ratio. There are several theories for the reasons behind the prevalence of accidents and health problems in the Thoroughbred breed, and research is ongoing.|$|E
5|$|All {{corticosteroid}} hormones share cholesterol as {{a common}} precursor. Therefore, {{the first step in}} steroidogenesis is cholesterol uptake or synthesis. Cells that produce steroid hormones can acquire cholesterol through two paths. The main source is through dietary cholesterol transported via the blood as cholesterol esters within low density lipoproteins (LDL). LDL enters the cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. The other source of cholesterol is synthesis in the cell's endoplasmic reticulum. Synthesis can compensate when LDL levels are <b>abnormally</b> low. In the lysosome, cholesterol esters are converted to free cholesterol, which is then used for steroidogenesis or stored in the cell.|$|E
5|$|B. i. coromandus {{differs from}} the {{nominate}} subspecies in breeding plumage, when the buff colour on its head extends to the cheeks and throat, and the plumes are more golden in colour. This subspecies' bill and tarsus are longer on average than in B. i. ibis. B. i. seychellarum is smaller and shorter-winged than the other forms. It has white cheeks and throat, like B. i. ibis, but the nuptial plumes are golden, as with B. i. coromandus. Individuals with <b>abnormally</b> grey, melanistic plumages have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|Cervical {{stenosis}} {{refers to}} an <b>abnormally</b> narrow cervical canal, typically associated with trauma caused by removal of tissue for investigation or treatment of cancer, or cervical cancer itself. Diethylstilbestrol, used from 1938 to 1971 to prevent preterm labour and miscarriage, is also strongly associated {{with the development of}} cervical stenosis and other abnormalities in the daughters of the exposed women. Other abnormalities include: vaginal adenosis, in which the squamous epithelium of the ectocervix becomes columnar; cancers such as clear cell adenocarcinomas; cervical ridges and hoods; and development of a cockscomb cervix appearance.|$|E
5|$|Depending on {{the type}} of tumor, paraneoplastic phenomena—symptoms not due to the local {{presence}} of cancer—may initially attract attention to the disease. In lung cancer, these phenomena may include hypercalcemia, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH, <b>abnormally</b> concentrated urine and diluted blood), ectopic ACTH production, or Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (muscle weakness due to autoantibodies). Tumors {{in the top of the}} lung, known as Pancoast tumors, may invade the local part of the sympathetic nervous system, leading to Horner's syndrome (dropping of the eyelid and a small pupil on that side), as well as damage to the brachial plexus.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s, {{parts of}} the state began {{suffering}} the consequences of poor farming practices, extended drought and high winds. Known as the Dust Bowl, areas of Kansas, Texas, New Mexico and northwestern Oklahoma were hampered by long periods of little rainfall and <b>abnormally</b> high temperatures, sending thousands of farmers into poverty and forcing them to relocate to more fertile areas of the western United States. Over a twenty-year period ending in 1950, the state saw its only historical decline in population, dropping 6.9 percent as impoverished families migrated out of the state after the Dust Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{may have}} bred C.cartwrightianus {{specimens}} by screening for specimens with <b>abnormally</b> long stigmas. The resulting saffron crocus was documented in a 7th-century BC Assyrian botanical reference compiled under Ashurbanipal, {{and it has}} since been traded and used {{over the course of}} four millennia and has been used as treatment for some ninety disorders. The C.sativus clone was slowly propagated throughout much of Eurasia, later reaching parts of North Africa, North America, and Oceania. Global production on a by-mass basis is now dominated by Iran, which accounts for some 90% of the annual harvest.|$|E
5|$|In normal development, {{endogenous}} sonic hedgehog signaling stimulates rapid {{proliferation of}} cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (CGNPs) {{in the external}} granule layer (EGL). Cerebellar development occurs during late embryogenesis and the early postnatal period, with CGNP proliferation in the EGL peaking during early development (postnatal day 7 in the mouse). As CGNPs terminally differentiate into cerebellum granule cells (also called cerebellar granule neurons, CGNs), they migrate to the internal granule layer (IGL), forming the mature cerebellum (by post-natal day 20 in the mouse). Mutations that <b>abnormally</b> activate Sonic hedgehog signaling predispose to cancer of the cerebellum (medulloblastoma) in humans with Gorlin Syndrome and in genetically engineered mouse models.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} found that the western cicada killer wasp is capable of {{thermoregulation}} which enables them to maintain territories during the day. A study by Joseph R. Coelho showed that during territorial patrolling the species had a high and regulated thorax temperature. Experiments found that the wasp has the ability to shift heat from its thorax to its abdomen and that the abdomen is generally kept colder than the thorax. Dead wasps that were placed in the sun reached <b>abnormally</b> high temperatures when compared to those on nearby plants.|$|E
5|$|Kettle Creek {{flows through}} Elk Township in Tioga County, then Abbott Township and Stewardson Township in Potter County, then Leidy Township and Noyes Township in Clinton County. Its mouth {{is at the}} {{community}} of Westport. Major tributaries include Cross Fork, Hammersley Fork, Little Kettle Creek, and others. The Kettle Creek Lake is located on Kettle Creek. Numerous metals and other substances contaminate the creek. These include iron, aluminum, manganese, and sulfates. The creek's discharge at Westport ranges from 4 to 6280 cubic feet per second and the pH ranges from 5.5 to 8.6. It also experiences <b>abnormally</b> high water temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Lefante {{is found}} {{wandering}} on a roadside, but {{appears to have}} been given an improperly-performed lobotomy. Another woman, Alice Brandt, is later kidnapped. She wakes up bound to a dentist's chair, with her kidnapper brandishing an ice pick and speaking in German. Mulder returns to Washington, D.C. to digitally analyze the photos and finds no evidence that they were doctored. By closely examining the photos, he finds the face of an old man as well as the shadow of the kidnapper, who appears to be <b>abnormally</b> tall.|$|E
5|$|Population declines of 50% in the Terre Adélie {{region have}} been {{observed}} due to increased adult mortality, especially of males, during an <b>abnormally</b> prolonged warm period in the late 1970s, which resulted in reduced sea-ice coverage. On the other hand, egg hatching success rates declined when the sea-ice extent increased. The species is therefore considered to be highly sensitive to climatic changes. In 2009, the Dion Islands colony, which has been extensively studied since 1948, {{was reported to have}} disappeared at some point over the previous decade, the first confirmed loss of a colony.|$|E
5|$|The 1846Havana {{hurricane}} {{was likely}} of Category5 intensity, {{the earliest known}} tropical cyclone of its strength to strike Cuba. In 1993, the weather historian Jose Fernandez-Partagás analyzed an anomalous atmospheric pressure of 916mbar (27.06inHg) measured at Havana upon the vessel Thames, deeming it to be <b>abnormally</b> low and evaluating its true value {{to be closer to}} 938mbar (27.70inHg), making the hurricane the most intense in recorded history at the time. The exceptionally low pressure reading in Cuba surpassed a previous record of 948mbar (28.00inHg) set by an 1844storm, with the new record eventually exceeded by the 1924 Cuba hurricane, which featured a manually recorded pressure reading of 932mbar (27.52inHg).|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of Guillain–Barré syndrome depends on findings such as rapid development of muscle paralysis, absent reflexes, absence of fever, and a likely cause. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis (through a lumbar spinal puncture) and nerve conduction studies are supportive investigations commonly {{performed in the}} {{diagnosis of}} GBS. Testing for antiganglioside antibodies is often performed, but their contribution to diagnosis is usually limited. Blood tests are generally performed to exclude the possibility of another cause for weakness, such as {{a low level of}} potassium in the blood. An <b>abnormally</b> low level of sodium in the blood is often encountered in Guillain–Barré syndrome. This has been attributed to the inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, leading to relative retention of water.|$|E
5|$|The first {{storm of}} the 1941 season formed on September 11 in the {{northern}} Gulf of Mexico. This was an <b>abnormally</b> late start to an Atlantic hurricane season: only on two other occasions between 1887 and 1941 had no storms developed prior to September 11. The storm moved slowly in a generally westward direction {{for the next few}} days, peaking as a moderate tropical storm with winds of 45mph (75km/h). It then weakened until it made landfall along the northern Texas coast between Galveston and Port Arthur as a tropical depression, where it caused only minor damage. Near 0600 UTC on September 16, the storm deteriorated into a depression, and dissipated a few hours later.|$|E
5|$|The lens {{exhibits}} significant distortion {{in keeping}} with the problems of wide-angle lenses. The complex barrel distortion is approximately 2.9% at 8mm focal length but is fairly insignificant as the focal length is raised above 12mm, according to Photozone.de. PC Magazine reports 3.1% distortion at 8mm and 0.7% at 12mm. It also reports that distortion switches to pincushion distortion of 1.4% at 16mm. SLAR Gear reports that the point of convergence between barrel and pincushion is about 13mm. Foreground subjects seem <b>abnormally</b> large compared to similar background subjects with this lens.|$|E
5|$|The second theory {{posits that}} either {{increased}} {{blood flow to}} the brain or increase in the brain tissue itself may result in the raised pressure. Little evidence has accumulated to support the suggestion that increased blood flow plays a role, but recently Bateman et al. in phase contrast MRA studies have quantified cerebral blood flow (CBF) in vivo and suggests that CBF is <b>abnormally</b> elevated in many patients with IIH. Both biopsy samples and various types of brain scans have shown an increased water content of the brain tissue. It remains unclear why this might be the case.|$|E
5|$|Under normal {{conditions}} about 75% {{of the eggs}} hatch. Hatching success can drop to about 35% in unusually hot conditions. Egg shell thinning, a potential cause of egg mortality, {{can be caused by}} pollutants. About 78% of chicks fledge in normal years, with that percentage only dropping slightly, to 77%, in <b>abnormally</b> hot years. Most egg and chick mortality during periods of normal climate is caused by nest fights between the parents and other birds. Breeding adults usually survive the year, with only about 18% dying every year. The young have a lower survival rate, with about 29% dying each year. The lifespan for this bird is anywhere from 16 to 30 years.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{receiving}} notification, the OAEP {{sent two}} officers to investigate, {{who met the}} doctors and patients at the hospital shortly after noon on 18 February. After questioning the scrapyard owner, they searched for the cylindrical metal pieces initially suspected to be the radiation source, but found {{that they were not}} radioactive. They then headed to the scrapyard, and noted <b>abnormally</b> high levels of radiation as they approached, late in the evening. At the scrapyard entrance they measured radiation at an equivalent dose of 1 millisievert per hour (mSv/h) and decided to request additional assistance.|$|E
5|$|<b>Abnormally</b> {{developed}} milk caps infested by the parasitic sac fungus Hypomyces lateritius (syn. Peckialla laterita) are occasionally {{found in}} summer and autumn. The infested fruit bodies are usually more or less heavily malformed with a harder and more solid flesh than typical fruit bodies, {{so that they are}} more resistant to rot and can even survive the winter. They do not create gills; instead, the cap bottom is covered by an initially soft, white hyphen fungus, also known as a subiculum. Early on the mycelia becomes denser and takes on a white-grey colour. The perithecia are created after about 10–14 days. Perithecia are fruit bodies of the Hypomyces and other sac fungi, in which the spindle-shaped asci are produced. Besides L.deterrimus, L.deliciosus and L.sanguifluus can become infested, rarely other milk caps. Hypomyces lateritius, H.ochraceus, H.rosellus, H.odoratus, among other Hypomyces species live parasitically on different milk caps and brittlegills {{as well as on the}} fruit bodies of species from other genera.|$|E
5|$|All such {{episodes of}} severe drought {{correlate}} with El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. El Niño-related droughts {{have also been}} implicated in periodic declines in Indian agricultural output. Nevertheless, ENSO events that have coincided with <b>abnormally</b> high sea surfaces temperatures in the Indian Ocean—in one instance during 1997 and 1998 by up to —have resulted in increased oceanic evaporation, resulting in unusually wet weather across India. Such anomalies have occurred during a sustained warm spell {{that began in the}} 1990s. A contrasting phenomenon is that, instead of the usual high pressure air mass over the southern Indian Ocean, an ENSO-related oceanic low pressure convergence centre forms; it then continually pulls dry air from Central Asia, desiccating India during what should have been the humid summer monsoon season. This reversed air flow causes India's droughts. The extent that an ENSO event raises sea surface temperatures in the central Pacific Ocean influences the extent of drought.|$|E
