25|$|By 1985 {{the number}} of {{institutions}} of higher learning had again increased - to slightly more than 1,000. The State Education Commission and the Ministry of Finance issued a joint declaration for nationwide unified enrollment of <b>adult</b> <b>students</b> - not the regular secondary-school graduates but the members of the work force who qualified for admission by taking a test. The State Education Commission established unified questions and time and evaluation criteria for the test and authorized provinces, autonomous regions, and special municipalities to administer the test, grade the papers in a uniform manner, and determine the minimum points required for admission. The various schools were to enroll students according to the results. <b>Adult</b> <b>students</b> needed to have the educational equivalent of senior-middle-school graduates, and those applying for release or partial release from work to study were to be under forty years of age. Staff members and workers were to apply to study job-related subjects with review by and approval of their respective work units. If employers paid for the college courses, the workers had to take entrance examinations. In 1985 colleges enrolled 33,000 employees from various enterprises and companies, approximately 6 percent of the total college enrollment.|$|E

Research in the field of adult education has explored many aspects of adult students' behavior and opinions but has seldom dealt with the affective domain of students' feelings. Growing numbers of <b>adult</b> returning <b>students</b> in higher education indicate the need for research in this area. The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore the classroom climate for <b>adult</b> returning <b>students</b> in undergraduate classrooms by comparing their feelings with younger students' feelings toward the course content in their sociology classes, toward their sociology instructors and toward the other students in their sociology classes. This study also explored how younger and <b>adult</b> returning <b>students</b> perceived that their instructors and other students felt about them. In addition, the relationship between the interaction in the classroom and students' feelings was determined. Data were gathered through 691 student questionnaires requesting quantitative and qualitative responses, 25 classroom visits, 12 instructor interviews and 18 <b>adult</b> returning <b>student</b> interviews. This was done in a qualitative multiple case study involving three types of higher educational institutions: two public community colleges, a public university and three private colleges. Cross-institutional analysis revealed that: (1) generally, <b>adult</b> returning <b>students</b> felt more positively about their sociology classes than did younger students; (2) the <b>adult</b> returning <b>students</b> who felt most positively were in the private colleges; (3) the <b>adult</b> returning <b>students</b> who felt least positively were in the university; and (4) there was not a clear relationship between level of classroom interaction and positive feelings of either the <b>adult</b> returning <b>students</b> or the younger students nor was there a clear relationship between the level of classroom interaction and the type of institution. Further findings were that <b>adult</b> returning <b>students</b> felt a peer-like relationship with their instructor. They felt that their life experiences gave them strong goals and motivation and an advantageous perspective on course content. <b>Adult</b> returning <b>students</b> did not indicate a need for self-direction in their undergraduate studies. They expressed varying degrees of wanting to become socially involved with other students. The study makes recommendations to faculty and institutions involved in teaching <b>adult</b> returning <b>students...</b>|$|R
