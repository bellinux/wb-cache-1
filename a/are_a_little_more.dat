At new and full moon, the Sun and the Moon are aligned, and the lunar and the solar tidal maxima and minima (bulges and depressions) add together for the greatest tidal range at particular latitudes. At first- and third-quarter phases of the moon, lunar and solar tides are perpendicular, and the tidal range is at a minimum. The semi-diurnal tides go through one full cycle (a high and low tide) about once every 12 hours and one full cycle of maximum height (a spring and neap tide) about once every 14 days.|$|E

She's still a cancer patient, but she knows that her job is on the line just like {{everyone}} else's. Everyone is working round the clock, showing up at every call, and the Chief is acting like a maniacal overlord." [...] Krill also enjoyed Oh's performance as Yang, writing: [...] "Cristina dealing with children is almost laughable – and actually provides a chuckle or two in this tense episode. Miss C thinks she is striking gold by moving to peds, because she {{will be able to do}} all types of surgery, and on little people, which makes the surgery harder, which is of course, better. Things don't turn out as planned, though, when she realizes kids <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> resilient than their adult counterparts. And then Callie outs her to Arizona – in the she doesn’t really like kids sense of outing." [...] Krill enjoyed Wilson's performance as Bailey, in addition to Dane's, writing: [...] "He wins the best line of the show with 'That’s how I know my job is safe, Yang – I reattach babies arms.'" ...|$|E

It is being released in the UK via Spinefarm Records. The album was produced by Chris [...] "Zeuss" [...] Harris. Drummer Jason Bittner recently stated about the band's new material, [...] "The songs <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> on the darker, angry side... lots of heaviness, lots of crazy guitar, and LOTS of room {{for me to have}} some fun. There {{is no doubt in my}} mind that this will be the best performance of my career, so far, and I owe that to my guys for bringing me incredible riffs to write killer drum parts to." [...] As of the fall of 2009 the band was appearing on the 'Shock & Raw' tour of North America with 2Cents, Otep & Five Finger Death Punch. After a South American tour, Shadows Fall will be playing on the Jägermeister Stage in the 2010 Rockstar Mayhem Festival in July and August 2010.

500|$|... "Wet Hot Demonic Summer" [...] {{was written}} by Daniel Powell and {{directed}} by Aaron Augenblick. Series creator Devin Clark said that they planned on giving it a summer theme since they knew it would air in the summer. Clark further elaborated on the decision to incorporate summer and Harry Potter themes into the episode, stating: [...] "We went, 'alright, those are two little nuggets of ideas we can incorporate into that.' We can't be as relevant to pop culture as some other shows, but it just means {{we have a little}} more of a challenge of making jokes that <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> evergreen and poking fun of the genre in a much broader spectrum." [...] Screenwriter Powell explained that it is difficult for the series to do [...] "topical stuff" [...] as it takes up to nine months to complete an episode, but they were {{aware of the fact that}} the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 would premiere shortly after the episode was set to air. [...] "So it would seem like we were hyper-topical, even though we had a good nine months advance notice", he said. Powell said that they included famous wizards from many other sources, including The Lord of the Rings and The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. In an interview with Charles Webb of MTV, Clark elaborated: [...] "We make it a hodgepodge of the wizard references and obviously the main one is, and the most prominent one and the one that's most relevant to pop culture is the Harry Potter spoof that we've thrown in there.|$|E

2500|$|In 1950, the {{ancestors}} of Fender Telecaster (Fender Esquire and Fender Broadcaster) {{were introduced to the}} musical market and solid-body electric guitars became a public craze. In reaction to market demand, Gibson Guitar president Ted McCarty brought guitarist Les Paul into the company as a consultant. Les Paul was a respected innovator who had been experimenting with guitar design for years. He hand-built a solid-body prototype called [...] "The Log", often suggested as the first solid-body Spanish guitar ever built. [...] "The Log" [...] was given its name from the pine block running through the middle of the guitar whose width and depth <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than the width of the fretboard; conventional hollow guitar sides or [...] "wings" [...] were added for shape. Although numerous other prototypes and limited-production solid-body models by other makers have since surfaced, it is known that in 1945–1946, Les Paul had approached Gibson with [...] "The Log" [...] prototype, but his solid body design was rejected.|$|E

2500|$|Some of {{the artists}} who {{influenced}} the style include Curt Boettcher, the Mamas & the Papas' John Phillips, and the Beach Boys' Brian Wilson. Concerning the Beach Boys' involvement with sunshine pop, the orchestral style of Pet Sounds (1966) was imitated by many Los Angeles record producers, but as The A.V. Club notes: [...] "Though ... were hugely influential on the sunshine pop acts that followed, [...] music was rarely {{in step with the}} genre." [...] The Suburbans Joel Goldenburg believes the closest the group ever came to the genre was the lightly produced album Friends (1968): [...] "the vocals of sunshine pop songs <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> anonymous and not as lushly featured as that of The Beach Boys. And I don't see the [...] Spector connection. The light touch applied to the songs reminds me more of soft samba music." [...] Murray says that [...] "John Phillips, on the other hand, practically created the blueprint for sunshine pop, with little of Wilson's uncommercial weirdness." ...|$|E
2500|$|People, Montag {{described}} Superficial as [...] "a fun, empowering {{mix that}} you could really dance to." [...] Montag later described the album to MTV as [...] "...different.

Some are a little bit edgier, but they all go together in some way. It's like a group of rocks. They're all rocks, but they're so different." [...] The first song, [...] "Look How I'm Doing", is described as a [...] "kiss off to a former flame", while [...] "Blackout" [...] ( [...] written by Taylor Momsen [...] ) is an ode to Montag's husband, Spencer Pratt. [...] "Turn Ya Head" [...] {{has been described as a}}n uptempo track with [...] "electronic" [...] influences. The song has also been described as [...] "urban pop". [...] "Fanatic" [...] is an uptempo song with [...] "an 80's feel", and has been compared to works by Kylie Minogue. Title track [...] "Superficial" [...] sees Montag singing about her public image, over a [...] "dancefloor" [...] beat, while aiming at Montag's critics. [...] "More Is More" [...] has been described as a [...] "club hit", as well as [...] "loud and intense." ...|$|E
