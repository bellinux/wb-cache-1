50|$|In astronomy, {{planetary}} transits and occultations {{occur when}} a planet passes {{in front of}} another object, as seen by an observer.

5|$|Over {{the next}} month, Frail {{observed}} that the luminosity of the radio source fluctuated significantly {{from day to day}} but increased on average. The fluctuations did not occur simultaneously along all of the observed wavelengths, which Jeremy Goodman of Princeton University explained as being the result of the radio waves being bent by interstellar plasma in the Milky Way. Such radio scintillations (rapid variations in the radio luminosity of an object) occur only when the source has an <b>apparent</b> <b>diameter</b> of less than 3microarcseconds.|$|E
5|$|M36 (NGC 1960) {{is a young}} galactic {{open cluster}} with {{approximately}} 60 stars, {{most of which are}} relatively bright; however, only about 40 stars are visible in most amateur instruments. It is at a distance of 3,900 light-years and has an overall magnitude of 6.0; it is 14 light-years wide. Its <b>apparent</b> <b>diameter</b> is 12.0 arcminutes. Of the three open clusters in Auriga, M36 is both the smallest and the most concentrated, though its brightest stars are approximately 9th magnitude. It was discovered in 1749 by Guillaume Le Gentil, the first of Auriga's major open clusters to be discovered. M36 features a 10-arcminute-wide knot of bright stars in its center, anchored by Struve 737, a double star with components separated by 10.7 arcseconds. Most of the stars in M36 are B type stars with rapid rates of rotation. M36's Trumpler class is given as both I 3 r and II 3 m. Besides the central knot, most of the cluster's other stars appear in smaller knots and groups.|$|E
5|$|M38 is a diffuse {{open cluster}} at a {{distance}} of 3,900 light-years, the least concentrated of the three main open clusters in Auriga; it is classified as a Trumpler Class II 2 r or III 2 r cluster because of this. It appears as a cross-shaped or pi-shaped object in a telescope and contains approximately 100 stars; its overall magnitude is 6.4. M38, like M36, was discovered by Guillaume Le Gentil in 1749. It has an <b>apparent</b> <b>diameter</b> of approximately 20 arcseconds and a true diameter of about 25 light-years. Unlike M36 or M37, M38 has a varied stellar population. The majority of the population consists of A and B type main sequence stars, the B type stars being the oldest members, and a number of G type giant stars. One yellow-hued G type star is the brightest star in M38 at a magnitude of 7.9. The brightest stars in M38 are magnitude 9 and 10. M38 is accompanied by NGC 1907, a smaller and dimmer cluster that lies half a degree south-southwest of M38; it is {{at a distance}} of 4,200 light-years. The smaller cluster has an overall magnitude of 8.2 and a diameter of 6.0 arcminutes, making it about a third the size of M38. However, NGC 1907 is a rich cluster, classified as a Trumpler Class I 1 m n cluster. It has approximately 12 stars of magnitude 9–10, and at least 25 stars of magnitude 9–12.|$|E

25|$|An annular {{solar eclipse}} {{took place on}} May 20, 2012 (May 21, 2012 in local time in the Eastern Hemisphere).

50|$|For a total {{solar eclipse}} to happen, {{the ratio of}} the <b>apparent</b> <b>diameters</b> of the Moon and of the Sun must be 1.0 or more, and the three {{celestial}} bodies (Sun, Earth and Moon) must be aligned centrally enough. When that is the case, the Moon's disk covers the Sun's disk in the sky completely. The path of totality (i.e. of the travelling shadow of the Moon cutting off all direct sunlight from reaching the Earth's surface) is a relatively narrow strip, at most a few hundreds of kilometers across.|$|R

Pappus of Alexandria described it (in his commentary on the Almagest of that chapter), as did Proclus (Hypotyposis IV). It was a 4-foot rod with a scale, a sighting hole at one end, and a wedge that could be moved along the rod to exactly obscure the disk of Sun or Moon.|$|E
25|$|A total {{solar eclipse}} {{occurred}} on July 11, 1991. A solar eclipse {{occurs when the}} Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring {{the image of the}} Sun for a viewer on Earth.

25|$|A {{total eclipse}} {{occurs when the}} {{observer}} is within the umbra, an annular eclipse when the observer is within the antumbra, and a partial eclipse when the observer is within the penumbra. During a lunar eclipse only the umbra and penumbra are applicable. This is because Earth's <b>apparent</b> <b>diameter</b> {{from the viewpoint of}} the Moon is nearly four times that of the Sun. The same terms may be used analogously in describing other eclipses, e.g., the antumbra of Deimos crossing Mars, or Phobos entering Mars's penumbra.|$|E

This disparity in angular size makes the moons' shadows sharper and more well-defined on Jupiter than the lunar shadow on Earth during total solar eclipses, as it narrows the penumbra for a given distance.|$|R
40|$|Some stimuli, if scaled in {{proportion}} to the reciprocal of inter ganglion cell receptive field separation (M-scaled) exhibit an isosensitivity profile. Perimetric profiles which are isosensitive across the extent of the normal visual field facilitate multiple stimulus perimetry and provide a convenient method for the detection of abnormality. The purpose of the investigation was to establish whether the stimulus diameters necessary to produce an isosensitive perimetric profile were scaled {{in proportion}} to M. Sensitivity profiles for a sample of 15 age-matched observers were obtained with the Friedmann VFA Mk II. The stimulus aperture diameters were then measured under 100 X magnification. The observed elliptical apertures, corrected for obliquity of viewing, plate thickness and distance from the eye were represented as diameters of circles possessing an equivalent area to that of the ellipse. The <b>apparent</b> <b>diameters</b> were then M-scaled relative to stimulus pattern h using the equations of Rovamo and Virsu (1979). An overestimation of the M-scaled diameters relative to the <b>apparent</b> <b>diameters</b> was noted which increased with eccentricity for all four cardinal meridians by a factor of up to 3. 5 times. It is suggested that the over compensation indicates that the cortical representation of perimetric spot targets at low photopic adaptation levels depends not only upon retinal ganglion cell density but also upon the variation of ganglion cell characteristics with eccentricity. The implications of this finding for perimetric instrument design are discussed...|$|R

He found that at the mean distance of the Moon, the Sun and Moon had the same apparent diameter; at that distance, the Moon's diameter fits 650 times into the circle, i.e., the mean apparent diameters are 360/650 = 0°33'14".|$|E
25|$|The eclipse {{was part}} of Saros series 136, as was the solar eclipse of July 11, 1991, which was {{slightly}} longer, lasting up to 6 minutes 53 seconds (previous eclipses of the same saros series on June 30, 1973 and June 20, 1955, were longer, lasting 7 min 04 and 7 min 08, respectively). The next event from this series will be on August 2, 2027. The exceptional duration {{was a result of}} the Moon being near perigee, with the <b>apparent</b> <b>diameter</b> of the Moon 8% larger than the Sun (magnitude 1.080) and the Earth being near aphelion where the Sun appeared slightly smaller.|$|E

25|$|Carina {{is known}} for its namesake nebula, NGC 3372, {{discovered}} by French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in 1751, which contains several nebulae. The Carina Nebula overall is an extended emission nebula approximately 8,000 light-years away and 300 light-years wide that includes vast star-forming regions. It has an overall magnitude of 8.0 and an <b>apparent</b> <b>diameter</b> of over 2 degrees. Its central region is called the Keyhole, or the Keyhole Nebula. This was described in 1847 by John Herschel, and likened to a keyhole by Emma Converse in 1873. The Keyhole is about seven light-years wide and is composed mostly of ionized hydrogen, with two major star-forming regions. The Homunculus Nebula is a planetary nebula {{visible to the naked eye}} that is being ejected by the erratic luminous blue variable star Eta Carinae, the most massive visible star known. Eta Carinae is so massive that it has reached the theoretical upper limit for the mass of a star and is therefore unstable. It {{is known for}} its outbursts; in 1840 it briefly became one of the brightest stars in the sky due to a particularly massive outburst, which largely created the Homunculus Nebula. Because of this instability and history of outbursts, Eta Carinae is considered a prime supernova candidate for the next several hundred thousand years because it has reached the end of its estimated million-year life span.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} book, Hipparchus starts from the {{opposite}} extreme assumption: he assigns a (minimum) distance to the Sun of 490 Earth radii. This would correspond to a parallax of 7', which is apparently the greatest parallax that Hipparchus thought would not be noticed (for comparison: the typical resolution of the human eye is about 2'; Tycho Brahe made naked eye observation with an accuracy down to 1'). In this case, {{the shadow of the}} Earth is a cone rather than a cylinder as under the first assumption. Hipparchus observed (at lunar eclipses) that at the mean distance of the Moon, the diameter of the shadow cone is 2+½ lunar diameters. That <b>apparent</b> <b>diameter</b> is, as he had observed, 360/650 degrees. With these values and simple geometry, Hipparchus could determine the mean distance; because it was computed for a minimum distance of the Sun, it is the maximum mean distance possible for the Moon. With his value for the eccentricity of the orbit, he could compute the least and greatest distances of the Moon too. According to Pappus, he found a least distance of 62, a mean of 67+1/3, and consequently a greatest distance of 72+2/3 Earth radii. With this method, as the parallax of the Sun decreases (i.e., its distance increases), the minimum limit for the mean distance is 59 Earth radii – exactly the mean distance that Ptolemy later derived.|$|E

He hypothesizes that the [...] "heralding sequences" [...] are instructions to observe the <b>apparent</b> <b>diameter</b> of the Moon, and that the half-size superscripted crescents (orange) preceding the sixth night before and sixth night after the full moon represent the small <b>apparent</b> <b>diameter</b> at apogee which triggers intercalation.
