40|$|Background: More {{and more}} {{experiments}} {{have shown that}} transcription and mRNA processing are not two independent events but are tightly coupled to each other. Both promoter and transcription rate were found to influence <b>alternative</b> splicing. More than half of human genes have <b>alternative</b> promoters, {{but it is still}} not clear why there are so many <b>alternative</b> promoters and what their biological roles are. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, we explored whether there is a functional correlation between <b>alternative</b> promoters and <b>alternative</b> splicing by a genome-wide analysis of human and mouse genes. We constructed a large data set of genes with <b>alternative</b> promoter and <b>alternative</b> splicing annotations. By analyzing these genes, we showed that genes with <b>alternative</b> promoters tended to demonstrate <b>alternative</b> splicing compare to genes with single promoter, and, genes with more <b>alternative</b> promoters tend to have more <b>alternative</b> splicing variants. Furthermore, transcripts from different <b>alternative</b> promoters tended to splice differently.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} general practitioners' {{opinions and}} behaviour regarding <b>alternative</b> medicine. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of {{a random sample}} of Ontario and Alberta general practitioners. SETTING: General practices in Ontario and Alberta. PARTICIPANTS: A questionnaire was mailed to 400 general practitioners. Of the 384 eligible physicians, 200 completed the questionnaire. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Reported beliefs and practices concerning <b>alternative</b> medicine. RESULTS: Acupuncture, chiropractic, and hypnosis were considered most useful and reflexology, naturopathy, and homeopathy least useful. Results showed 56 % of general practitioners believed that <b>alternative</b> medicine has ideas and methods from which conventional medicine could benefit, 54 % referred to <b>alternative</b> practitioners, and 16 % practised some form of <b>alternative</b> medicine. Province of practice, place of graduation, training in <b>alternative</b> approaches, number of <b>alternative</b> approaches perceived useful, and attitude toward <b>alternative</b> medicine were clearly related to referring to <b>alternative</b> practitioners. Sex, age, type of practice, training in <b>alternative</b> medicine, referring to <b>alternative</b> practitioners, number of <b>alternative</b> approaches perceived useful, and attitude toward <b>alternative</b> medicine were related to practicing <b>alternative</b> medicine. CONCLUSION: Although acceptance and integration of <b>alternative</b> medicine extend only to certain approaches, <b>alternative</b> medicine cannot be discounted in general practice.
