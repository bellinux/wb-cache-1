5|$|As a result, many {{countries}} in the Pacific region emulated the lead of Puerto Rico and introduced the toad in the 1930s. There are introduced populations in Australia, Florida, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, the Ogasawara, Ishigaki Island and the Daitō Islands of Japan, most Caribbean islands, Fiji and many other Pacific islands, including Hawaii. Since then, the cane toad has become a pest in many host countries, and poses <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>threat</b> to native animals.|$|E

C. mutica fouling populations may also incur minor economic effects through the cost of their removal from submerged aquaculture equipment and ship hulls.|$|E

5|$|C. mutica {{are native}} to shallow {{protected}} {{bodies of water}} in the Sea of Japan. In as little as 40 years, they have become an invasive species in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and along the coasts of New Zealand. They are believed to have been accidentally introduced to these areas through the global maritime traffic and aquaculture. Outside of their native range, C.mutica are often exclusively synanthropic, being found in large numbers in and around areas of human activity. Their ecological and economic impact as an invasive species is unknown, but they pose <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>threat</b> to native populations of skeleton shrimp in the affected areas.|$|E
5|$|Cane toads pose <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>threat</b> {{to native}} species when {{introduced}} to a new ecosystem. Classified as an invasive species in over 20 countries, there are multiple reports of the cane toad moving into a new area {{to be followed by}} a decline in the biodiversity in that region. The most documented region of the cane toad's invasion and subsequent effect on native species is Australia, where multiple surveys and observations of the toad's conquest have been completed. The best way to illustrate this effect is through the plight of the northern quoll, as well as Mertens' water monitor, a large lizard native to South and Southeast Asia.|$|E
5|$|Following the RPF victory, {{approximately}} two million Hutu fled to {{refugee camps in}} neighboring countries, particularly Zaire, fearing RPF reprisals for the Rwandan Genocide. The camps were {{set up by the}} United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), but were effectively controlled by the army and government of the former Hutu regime, including many leaders of the genocide. This regime was determined to return to power in Rwanda and began rearming, killing Tutsi residing in Zaire, and launching cross-border incursions in conjunction with the Interahamwe paramilitary group. By late 1996, the Hutu militants represented <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>threat</b> to the new Rwandan regime, and Kagame launched a counteroffensive.|$|E

The Russian wheat aphid (RWA) is <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> insect <b>threat</b> to wheat {{and other small}} grains. Growers should examine small grain fields regularly for this pest throughout the fall. In the spring, weekly examinations are needed from the time wheat resumes growth through the late heading stages. Farmers are encouraged to collect samples of unknown aphids on small grains and have them identified by the Cooperative Extension Service. Proper identification of the aphid is critical in determining the need for insecticidal controls. Even a relatively few RWA may justify treatment costs...|$|R

5|$|Inconsistent {{performances}} in the league, particularly away from home, meant Arsenal never posed <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>threat</b> to Manchester United, the reigning champions. Midfielder Patrick Vieira was suspended from playing for much of late autumn after a confrontation with West Ham United player Neil Ruddock. In October, Arsenal notably staged a comeback against Chelsea, with Nwankwo Kanu scoring a hat-trick in the final 15 minutes of the game. A run of eight straight wins between March and May propelled Arsenal from fifth to second and the team finished on 73 points.|$|E
5|$|Overfishing is <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>threat</b> to {{seamount}} ecological welfare. There {{are several}} well-documented cases of fishery exploitation, {{for example the}} orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) off the coasts of Australia and New Zealand and the pelagic armorhead (Pseudopentaceros richardsoni) near Japan and Russia. The {{reason for this is}} that the fishes that are targeted over seamounts are typically long-lived, slow-growing, and slow-maturing. The problem is confounded by the dangers of trawling, which damages seamount surface communities, and the fact that many seamounts are located in international waters, making proper monitoring difficult. Bottom trawling in particular is extremely devastating to seamount ecology, and is responsible for as much as 95% of ecological damage to seamounts.|$|E
