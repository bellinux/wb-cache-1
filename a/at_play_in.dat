5|$|Another {{controversy}} {{regards the}} main influences <b>at</b> <b>play</b> <b>in</b> the Georgian alphabet, as scholars have debated {{whether it was}} inspired more by the Greek alphabet, or by Semitic alphabets such as Aramaic. Recent historiography focuses on greater similarities with the Greek alphabet than in the other Caucasian writing systems, most notably the order and numeric value of letters. Some scholars have also suggested certain pre-Christian Georgian cultural symbols or clan markers as a possible inspiration for particular letters.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{theory can}} also be seen <b>at</b> <b>play</b> <b>in</b> Stowe's book, with the novel as a {{critique}} of the patriarchal nature of slavery. For Stowe, blood relations rather than paternalistic relations between masters and slaves formed the basis of families. Moreover, Stowe viewed national solidarity as an extension of a person's family, thus feelings of nationality stemmed from possessing a shared race. Consequently, she advocated African colonization for freed slaves and not amalgamation into American society.|$|E

5|$|Neuroscientist and {{psychologist}} Pascal Wallisch {{states that}} while inherently ambiguous stimuli {{have been known}} to vision science for many years, this is the first such stimulus in the colour domain that was {{brought to the attention of}} science by social media. He attributes differential perceptions to differences in illumination and fabric priors, but also notes that the stimulus is highly unusual insofar as the perception of most people does not switch. If it does, it does so only on very long time scales, which is highly unusual for bistable stimuli, so perceptual learning might be <b>at</b> <b>play.</b> <b>In</b> addition, he says that discussions of this stimulus are not frivolous, as the stimulus is both of interest to science and a paradigmatic case of how different people can sincerely see the world differently, an acknowledgement of which is a precondition for world peace. Daniel Hardiman-McCartney of the College of Optometrists stated that the picture was ambiguous, suggesting that the illusion was caused by a strong yellow light shining onto the dress, and human perception of the colours of the dress and light source by comparing them with other colours and objects in the picture. The philosopher Barry C. Smith compared the phenomenon with Ludwig Wittgenstein and the rabbit–duck illusion.|$|E

25|$|Bloom's {{critique}} of contemporary social movements <b>at</b> <b>play</b> <b>in</b> universities or {{society at large}} is derived from his classical and philosophical orientation. For Bloom, the failure of contemporary liberal education leads to the sterile social and sexual habits of modern students, and to their inability to fashion a life for themselves beyond the mundane offerings touted as success. Bloom argues that commercial pursuits had become more highly valued than love, the philosophic quest for truth, or the civilized pursuits of honor and glory.|$|E

25|$|Friction. This {{is a force}} always {{opposing}} the forward motion, whereby the vector invariably acts in the negative direction s with an effect to reduce the speed. The friction <b>at</b> <b>play</b> <b>in</b> the balanced-flow models is the one exerted by the roughness of the Earth's surface on the air moving higher above. For simplicity, we here assume that the frictional force (per unit mass) adjusts to the parcel's speed proportionally through a constant coefficient of friction K. In more realistic conditions, the dependence of friction on the speed is non-linear except for slow laminar flows.|$|E
25|$|A related finding {{indicates}} that slightly older infants can acquire both lexical and grammatical regularities {{from a single}} set of input, suggesting {{that they are able}} to use outputs of one type of statistical learning (cues that lead to the discovery of word boundaries) as input to a second type (cues that lead to the discovery of syntactical regularities. At test, 12-month-olds preferred to listen to sentences that had the same grammatical structure as the artificial language they had been tested on rather than sentences that had a different (ungrammatical) structure. Because learning grammatical regularities requires infants to be able to determine boundaries between individual words, this {{indicates that}} infants who are still quite young are able to acquire multiple levels of language knowledge (both lexical and syntactical) simultaneously, indicating that statistical learning is a powerful mechanism <b>at</b> <b>play</b> <b>in</b> language learning.|$|E
25|$|Polanyi's PhD {{studies at}} Manchester University focused on {{measuring}} {{the strengths of}} chemical bonds using thermal dissociation, building on Warhurst's graduate studies using a sodium flame apparatus to determine {{the likelihood that a}} collision between a sodium atom and another molecule would lead to a chemical reaction. For the majority of his career, Polanyi's research has focused on chemical dynamics, attempting to determine the mechanics of a chemical reaction, and the properties of chemical species in the transition state. While at the National Research Council (NRC), Polanyi evaluated transition state theory for its predictive powers, coming {{to the conclusion that the}} theory was flawed, largely due to a lack of knowledge about the forces <b>at</b> <b>play</b> <b>in</b> the transition state. Near the end of his stay at NRC, Polanyi worked in Gerhard Herzberg's lab, using spectroscopy to examine vibrational and rotational excitation in iodine molecules. During Polanyi's time at Princeton University, he worked with Sir Hugh Taylor and his colleagues, Michael Boudart and David Garvin. He was influenced by studies conducted at Princeton looking at the vibrationally excited reaction products between atomic hydrogen and ozone.|$|E

500|$|Another consequence, also {{according}} to Luna, was {{the dissolution of}} the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata into several different units. Most of the cities and provinces had distinctive populations, economies, attitudes, contexts, and interests. Until the revolution, all of these peoples were held together by the authority of the Spanish government, but with its disappearance, people from Montevideo, Paraguay and the Upper Peru began to distance themselves from Buenos Aires. The brief existence of the Viceroyalty of the Rio de la Plata, which had lasted barely 38years, impeded the consolidation of a patriotic feeling and failed to bring a sense of community to all of the population. The new country of Argentina lacked an established concept of national identity capable to unite the population under a common idea of statehood. Juan Bautista Alberdi sees the May Revolution as one of the early manifestations of the power struggles between the city of Buenos Aires and the provinces—one of the axial conflicts <b>at</b> <b>play</b> <b>in</b> the Argentine civil wars. Alberdi wrote in his book [...] "Escritos póstumos": ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the musical}} prelude climaxes, Woglinde and Wellgunde are seen <b>at</b> <b>play</b> <b>in</b> {{the depths of}} the Rhine. Flosshilde joins them after a gentle {{reminder}} of their responsibilities as guardians of the gold. They are observed by the Nibelung dwarf Alberich who calls out to them: [...] "I'd like to draw near if you would be kind to me". The wary Flosshilde cries: [...] "Guard the gold! Father warned us of such a foe". When Alberich begins his rough wooing the maidens relax: [...] "Now I laugh at my fears, our enemy is in love", says Flosshilde, and a cruel teasing game ensues. First, Woglinde pretends to respond to the dwarf's advances but swims away as he tries to embrace her. Then Wellgunde takes over, and Alberich's hopes rise until her sharp retort: [...] "Ugh, you hairy hunchbacked clown!" [...] Flosshilde pretends to chastise her sisters for their cruelty and feigns her own courtship, by which Alberich is quite taken in until she suddenly tears away to join the others in a mocking song. Tormented with lust, Alberich furiously chases the maidens over the rocks, slipping and sliding as they elude him, before he sinks down in impotent rage. At this point the mood changes: as a sudden brightness penetrates the depths, a magical golden light reveals, for the first time, the Rhinegold on its rock. The maidens sing their ecstatic greeting to the gold, which rouses Alberich's curiosity. In response to his question Woglinde and Wellgunde reveal the gold's secret: measureless power would belong to the one who could forge a ring from it. Flosshilde scolds them for giving this secret away, but her concerns are dismissed—only someone who has forsworn love can obtain the gold, and Alberich is clearly so besotted as to present no danger. But their confidence is misplaced; in his humiliation Alberich decides that world mastery is more desirable than love. As the maidens continue to jeer his antics he scrambles up the rock and, uttering a curse on love, seizes the gold and disappears, leaving the Rhinemaidens to dive after him [...] bewailing their loss.|$|E

500|$|For {{the change}} from Ghost Rider to LMD, Joseph McCabe at Nerdist said that any doubts he had about the change [...] "are more or less eliminated" [...] by the series take on a robotic antagonist, which he called [...] "Avengers: Age of Ultron done right ... where it most {{obviously}} improves on the overstuffed second Avengers film is in the humor department". Schwartz called the transition smooth, and felt the series' ongoing Inhuman subplot complimented the LMD storyline well. Valentine said that the beginning of LMD [...] "doesn’t maintain the heights of [...] days with Ghost Rider in the driver’s seat, but it does manage to remain a solid entry on the airwaves." [...] He was very critical of the Inhuman subplot, calling the Watchdogs [...] "pretty much played out at this point" [...] and feeling the Inhumans had become stale after the previous two seasons. Fitzpatrick also criticized the [...] "flat" [...] Inhuman storyline, but felt the change to LMD [...] "got off to the best possible start" [...] given the [...] "obviously less of an immediate hook" [...] than Ghost Rider. Beginning the Agents of Hydra pod, Schwartz said [...] "this return episode more than delivered" [...] on the previous episode's cliffhanger. She was satisfied that the Framework reality was not undone within a single episode, and was hopeful that the remaining episodes of the season would offer [...] "similar surprises [...] our expectations". Valentine felt [...] "What If..." [...] "made for a very good start" [...] to the pod, feeling it [...] "continues {{to build on the}} goodwill created by season 4 of S.H.I.E.L.D. presenting an interesting concept and world to be explored". McCown-Levy continued the praise, saying [...] "This could’ve been a sodden slog through too-obvious reveals and portentous doom and gloom. Instead, S.H.I.E.L.D. kept its fleet and efficient pacing, but bent it to the service of a dark and compelling narrative arc already paying dividends in terms of rewarding long-time viewers with deep-pull references and stories". Fitzpatrick, however, felt the episode [...] "stumbled" [...] and was [...] "something of a bumpy reentry into season 4, and doubly so for anyone who lost sight of the Life Model Decoy conflict in play, or harbor concern ABC might not order a fifth season." [...] He found it difficult to determine the rules <b>at</b> <b>play</b> <b>in</b> the Framework, and felt the storyline was done more so because the [...] "producers missed working with Brett Dalton".|$|E
