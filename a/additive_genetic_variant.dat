40|$|Personality {{traits are}} basic {{dimensions}} of behavioral variation, and twin, family, and adoption {{studies show that}} around 30 % of the between-individual variation is due to genetic variation. There is rapidly growing interest in understanding the evolutionary basis of this genetic variation. Several evolutionary mechanisms could explain how genetic variation is maintained in traits, and each of these makes predictions {{in terms of the}} relative contribution of rare and common <b>genetic</b> <b>variants</b> to personality variation, the magnitude of nonadditive genetic influences, and whether personality is affected by inbreeding. Using genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from > 8000 individuals, we estimated that little variation in the Cloninger personality dimensions (7. 2 % on average) is due to the combined effect of common, <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>variants</b> across the genome, suggesting that most heritable variation in personality is due to rare variant effects and/or a combination of dominance and epistasis. Furthermore, higher levels of inbreeding were associated with less socially desirable personality trait levels in three of the four personality dimensions. These findings are consistent with genetic variation in personality traits having been maintained by mutation-selection balance. © 2012 The Author(s).

The total number of risk alleles of these <b>genetic</b> <b>variants</b> was calculated for each participant as a genetic risk score (GRS), and the association between the GRS and the maximum IOP, mean VCDR, and phenotype (HTG or NTG) of POAG was evaluated. As the GRS increased, the maximum IOP (P = 0. 012) and VCDR (P = 0. 010) significantly increased. The GRS (9. 1 ± 1. 9) in patients with HTG was significantly higher (P = 0. 011) than that (8. 7 ± 1. 8) in control subjects. The patients with GRS≥ 12 as a cut-off value had a 2. 54 times higher (P = 0. 0085) risk on HTG (maximum IOP≥ 22 mmHg) compared with all patients. The IOP-related GRS approach substantiated that the IOP and VCDR were increased by the additive effects of IOP-related <b>genetic</b> <b>variants</b> in POAG. The high IOP-related GRS in patients with HTG but not NTG shows that {{there are differences in}} the genetic background between HTG and NTG and supports the notion that the phenotype (HTG or NTG) in patients with POAG depends on the additive effects of IOP-related <b>genetic</b> <b>variants.</b> The above-mentioned cut-off value of IOP-related GRS may be clinically useful for predicting the risk of IOP elevation...|$|R

The study was performed in a population-based cohort of 1016 elderly individuals, which comprised 168 statin users investigated at age 75 and 80. Using random forest models, the major variants influencing LDL-C levels were summarized in a weighted GRS (wGRS). The wGRS was tested with lipid and glucose outcomes and validated in an independent population-based cohort including 221 statin users. Four SNPs within the APOE cluster (rs 7412, rs 4420638), ABCC 2 (rs 2002042) and CELSR/SORT 1 /PSRC 1 (rs 646776), displayed a major impact on statin efficacy. The wGRS was significantly associated with lower LDL-C at age 75 and 80. This association was replicated displaying similar results. GRS analysis is a powerful tool to evaluate the <b>additive</b> effects of <b>genetic</b> <b>variants</b> on statin response and to estimate the magnitude of LDL-C reduction to a considerable extent in the older population...|$|R
40|$|I {{investigated}} the genetic and environmental etiology {{of individual differences}} {{in a variety of}} complex human behaviours, broadly captured within three domains - 1) cannabis use, 2) personality, and 3) sexuality and mating. Research questions and hypotheses are addressed with large community-based, genetically informative datasets and various methodological and statistical approaches. Section I focuses on the genetics of cannabis use. By meta-analysing existing twin studies I determined more precisely the relative contributions of genes and environment on individual differences in cannabis use and abuse. For cannabis use initiation I found a heritability estimate of 48 % in males and 40 % in females. For problematic cannabis use the heritability estimates were 51 % and 59 % for males and females. I then performed a gene-based association test on a large sample to test for genetic association between ten previously reported candidate genes and lifetime frequency of cannabis use. None of the candidate genes reached even nominal significance, which may point to our limited understanding of the neurobiology of cannabis use and also to potential publication bias and false-positive findings in previous studies. To identify potential new <b>genetic</b> <b>variants</b> underlying cannabis use, I then meta-analysed results from two large genome-wide association studies for cannabis use initiation. I did not identify any <b>genetic</b> <b>variant</b> significantly contributing to cannabis use initiation. Furthermore, I estimated that only approximately 6 % of variance in cannabis initiation is due to common <b>genetic</b> <b>variants.</b> This suggests that non-additive effects, and/or rare mutations may also play a role in cannabis use vulnerability. Section II focuses on personality traits, which are known to be moderately heritable. I performed the first genome-wide association study on Cloninger’s personality traits to identify <b>genetic</b> <b>variants</b> underlying personality, followed by a meta-analysis of four genome-wide association studies. I also performed gene-based association tests and investigated if genes in specific biological pathways showed elevated association with personality traits. Additionally, I performed a genetic prediction analysis to test if the aggregated effects of common variants obtained from genome-wide association results from a discovery sample could predict personality in another sample. In both studies no <b>genetic</b> <b>variants</b> or pathways were found to be significantly related to any personality trait, nor could the genetic prediction scores explain a substantial part of the variation in any personality dimension. Our findings indicate that individual common <b>genetic</b> <b>variants</b> with an effect size of more than ~ 0. 5 % do not contribute to personality variation, which has important implications regarding the genetic architecture of personality and the evolutionary mechanisms by which heritable variation is maintained. In the next study, I tested these different evolutionary mechanisms by estimating the percentage of the genetic variation underlying personality attributable to the combined effect of common variants by using a newly developed methodology utilising genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism data; I also investigated whether inbreeding affects personality. I estimated that little variation in the personality traits is due to the combined effect of common, <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>variants,</b> suggesting that most heritable variation in personality is due to rare variant effects and/or some combination of dominance and epistasis. Furthermore, higher levels of inbreeding were associated with less socially-desirable personality trait levels in three of the four personality dimensions. These findings are consistent with genetic variation in personality traits having been maintained by mutation-selection balance. Section III focuses on human sexuality and mating. By employing the classical twin design, I found that individual differences in risky sexual behaviour are influenced to the same extent by genes, shared environment and residual influences. Moreover, risky sexual behaviour is associated with adolescent misconduct in other domains, primarily because of genetic correlation between the variables. I then {{investigated the}} etiology of elevated lifetime depression rates in homosexuals and bisexuals as compared to heterosexuals in a genetically informative sample. Analyses revealed that genetic factors account {{for the majority of the}} correlation between sexual orientation and depression. In addition, childhood sexual abuse and risky family environment were also significant predictors of both sexual orientation and depression, further contributing to their correlation. The last three studies investigated the genetic and environmental influences on human mate preferences and realised choices on a wide variety of physical and behavioural traits. Mate preferences showed substantial heritability, whereas for realised mate-choice the average heritability was near-zero. I also found that mate choice is not significantly influenced by sexual imprinting, where individuals acquire mate-choice criteria by using their opposite-sex parent as the template of a desirable mate. The main detectable pattern of mate choice was assortative mating, which I showed is likely due to both phenotypic matching (choosing a partner based on their self-similarity) and social homogamy (choosing a partner from within one’s social group, which includes individuals who tend to be self-similar). Following the empirical papers, I provide a general discussion in which I summarise the findings and their implications, mention potential limitations of the research, and suggest directions for future research...|$|R
40|$|Prior {{studies have}} shown that eating {{disorders}} and disordered eating characteristics have similar contributions of genetic and environmental influences. However, few studies have identified specific <b>genetic</b> <b>variants</b> that influence these phenotypes. It is possible that the lack of replication studies is due to the focus on one particular polymorphism rather than a more comprehensive approach that includes multiple polymorphisms at a given locus. In addition, little information is known about common risk factors for eating disorders and co-occurring traits, such as substance use and personality. This dissertation uses adolescent and young adult twins and their family members from the community sample of the Colorado Center for Antisocial Drug Dependence (CADD) to investigate risk factors for disordered eating, substance use, and specific personality traits. Findings from the research examining risk factors for disordered eating provide insight into whether putative <b>genetic</b> <b>variants,</b> such as those in the serotonin transporter gene (SLC 6 A 4), are associated with these characteristics. First, extended twin analyses were used to investigate genetic and environmental influences on two disordered eating characteristics identified from the CADD. Second, a family-based association test examined whether specific <b>genetic</b> <b>variants</b> in and near SLC 6 A 4 were associated with disordered eating. Finally, phenotypic correlations among disordered eating, substance use, and personality traits were examined. Results from the first study suggested that individual differences in disordered eating characteristics could be explained by <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> and non-shared environmental influences. Findings from the second study suggested that a <b>genetic</b> <b>variant</b> upstream of the 52 ̆ 7 region of SLC 6 A 4 was associated with a measure of weight and shape concerns and behaviors, even after controlling for multiple <b>genetic</b> <b>variant</b> testing. The final study found small phenotypic correlations between disordered eating and multiple substance use measures, and between disordered eating and specific personality traits.

40|$|The ENIGMA (Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis) Consortium {{was set up}} {{to analyze}} brain {{measures}} and genotypes from multiple sites across the world to improve the power to detect <b>genetic</b> <b>variants</b> that influence the brain. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) yields quantitative measures sensitive to brain development and degeneration, and some common <b>genetic</b> <b>variants</b> may be associated with white matter integrity or connectivity. DTI measures, such as the fractional anisotropy (FA) of water diffusion, may be useful for identifying <b>genetic</b> <b>variants</b> that influence brain microstructure. However, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) require large populations to obtain sufficient power to detect and replicate significant effects, motivating a multi-site consortium effort. As part of an ENIGMA-DTI working group, we analyzed high-resolution FA images from multiple imaging sites across North America, Australia, and Europe, to address the challenge of harmonizing imaging data collected at multiple sites. Four hundred images of healthy adults aged 18 - 85 from four sites were used to create a template and corresponding skeletonized FA image as a common reference space. Using twin and pedigree samples of different ethnicities, we used our common template to evaluate the heritability of tract-derived FA measures. We show that our template is reliable for integrating multiple datasets by combining results through meta-analysis and unifying the data through exploratory mega-analyses.

40|$|High blood {{pressure}} and obesity are two major public health problems and important contributors to multiple chronic disorders including cardiovascular disease, stroke, and type II diabetes. Heritability {{studies have shown that}} there is a substantial fraction of the interindividual variation in {{blood pressure}} and body mass index (BMI) that is due to <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> variation. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many novel chromosomal regions associated with these traits that are highly significant (p< 5 x 10 - 8) and replicate across multiple studies. Because most of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these chromosomal regions fall in non-coding sequences, their functional mechanisms are not well understood. To develop a deeper knowledge of the biological mechanisms that may be underlying the genetic associations for {{blood pressure and}} BMI, we examined the relationship between <b>genetic</b> <b>variants</b> and gene expression levels among non-Hispanic white sibships in the Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy (GENOA). In addition, we estimated the heritability of the gene expression levels from the 27 blood pressure-related genes and the 30 BMI-related genes. The heritability study found that approximately 67 % of the 27 BP-related genes and 47 % of the 30 BMI-related genes had gene expression levels that were significantly heritable (p< 0. 05). The genetic association study revealed that many <b>genetic</b> <b>variants</b> within a gene region contribute to variation in expression levels. However, only a few of these gene expression levels were also associated with the phenotypic traits of blood pressure and BMI. For example, ULK 4 was the only gene that was found to have <b>genetic</b> <b>variants</b> explaining significant variation in ULK 4 expression and its expression was also significantly associated with blood pressure levels. Lastly, we investigated whether the relationship between gene expression levels and the outcomes of blood pressure and BMI were influenced by <b>genetic</b> <b>variants.</b> Our results indicated that the relationship between CACNB 2 expression and systolic blood pressure could be modified by <b>genetic</b> <b>variants.</b> This dissertation took an important step in following up the recently identified GWAS genetic loci associated with blood pressure and BMI to better understand the molecular epidemiology of these major risk factors...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: In this study, our {{aim was to}} {{elucidate}} the role of four polymorphisms identified in a prior large genome-wide association study (GWAS) in which the investigators analyzed the responses of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to treatment with tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi). The authors of that study reported that the four <b>genetic</b> <b>variants</b> were significantly associated. However, none of the associations reached GWAS significance, and two subsequent studies failed to replicate these associations. Methods: The four polymorphisms (rs 12081765, rs 1532269, rs 17301249 and rs 7305646) were genotyped in a total of 634 TNFi-treated RA patients of Spanish Caucasian origin. Four outcomes were evaluated: changes in the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS 28) after 6 and 12 months of treatment and classification according to the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response criteria at the same time points. Association with DAS 28 changes was assessed by linear regression using an <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> model. Contingency tables of genotype and allele frequencies between EULAR responder and nonresponder patients were compared. In addition, we combined our data with those of previously reported studies in a meta-analysis including 2, 998 RA patients. Results: None of the four <b>genetic</b> <b>variants</b> showed an association with response to TNFi in any of the four outcomes analyzed in our Spanish patients. In addition, only rs 1532269 yielded a suggestive association (P = 0. 0033) with the response to TNFi when available data from previous studies were combined in the meta-analysis. Conclusion: Our data suggest that the rs 12081765, rs 1532269, rs 17301249 and rs 7305646 <b>genetic</b> <b>variants</b> do not have a role as genetic predictors of TNFi treatment outcomes...|$|R

Estimates of <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> variance, heritabilities, and CVA were low, but, {{in contrast to}} the CVA, moderate heritabilities could not be excluded due to highly skewed distributions.

40|$|One {{specific}} hypothesis {{explaining the}} evolution of extra-pair reproduction (EPR) by socially monogamous females is that EPR is under indirect selection because extra-pair offspring (EPO) sired by extra-pair males have higher <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> value for fitness than the within-pair offspring (WPO) a female would have produced had she solely mated with her socially paired male. This hypothesis has not been explicitly tested by comparing <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> value between EPO and the WPO they replaced. We show that the difference in <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> breeding value (BV) between EPO and the WPO they replaced {{is proportional to the}} genetic covariance between offspring fitness and male net paternity gain through EPR, and estimate this covariance with respect to offspring recruitment in free-living song sparrows (Melospiza melodia). Recruitment and net paternity gain showed non-zero <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> variance and heritability, and negative genetic covariance. Opposite to prediction, EPO therefore had lower BV for recruitment than the WPO they replaced. We thereby demonstrate an explicit quantitative genetic approach to testing the hypothesis that EPR allows polyandrous females to increase offspring <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> value, and suggest that there may be weak indirect selection against female EPR through reduced <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> value for recruitment of EPO versus WPO in song sparrows...|$|R

40|$|The forces {{driving the}} {{evolution}} of extra-pair reproduction in socially monogamous animals remain widely debated and unresolved. One key hypothesis is that female extra-pair reproduction evolves through indirect genetic benefits, reflecting increased <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> value of extra-pair offspring. Such evolution requires that a female's propensity to produce offspring that are sired by an extra-pair male is heritable. However, <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> variance and heritability in female extra-pair paternity (EPP) rate have not been quantified, precluding accurate estimation of the force of indirect selection. Sixteen years of comprehensive paternity and pedigree data from socially monogamous but genetically polygynandrous song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) showed significant <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> variance and heritability {{in the proportion of}} a female's offspring that was sired by an extra-pair male, constituting major components of the genetic architecture required for extra-pair reproduction to evolve through indirect <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> benefits. However, estimated heritabilities were moderately small (0. 12 and 0. 18 on the observed and underlying latent scales, respectively). The force of selection on extra-pair reproduction through indirect <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> benefits may consequently be relatively weak. However, the <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> variance and non-zero heritability observed in female EPP rate allow for multiple further genetic mechanisms to drive and constrain mating system evolution...|$|R

We then investigated the effect of polygenic risk for schizophrenia on cortical gyrification calculated from 3. 0 T structural imaging data in the discovery dataset (N = 315) and replication dataset (N = 357). We found a consistent effect of the polygenic risk for schizophrenia on cortical gyrification in the inferior parietal lobules in 2 independent general- population samples.

To determine whether or not the difference in the genetic variation in northern and southern populations {{can be explained by the}} differences in mutation rate and/or effective population size, numerical calculations were made using population genetic parameters. In addition, the average heterozygosities of the northern and southern populations at ten of 19 polymorphic structural loci surveyed were estimated in relation to the cline of <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> variance of viability, and the following findings were obtained. (1) The changes in mutation rate and population size cannot simultaneously explain the difference in <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> variance and inbreeding decline between the northern and southern populations. Thus, the operation of some kind of balancing selection, most likely diversifying selection, was suggested to explain the observed excess of <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> variance. (2) Estimates of the average heterozygosities of the southern population were not significantly different from those of the northern population. Thus, it was strongly suggested that the excess of <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> variance in the southern population cannot be caused by structural loci, but by factors outside the structural loci, and that protein polymorphisms are selectively neutral or nearly neutral...|$|R

40|$|When mapping {{expression}} {{quantitative trait}} loci, a linear <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> model is mostly {{commonly used to}} investigate how <b>genetic</b> <b>variants</b> influence transcript levels. This model assumes that the phenotype of heterozygotes is halfway between that of the low-homozygous and high-homozygous genotypes and may miss non-additive relationships, such as those caused by dominant alleles. Here we examine RNA-Seq data to identify dominant genetic associations with gene expression in the human genome. We applied a multiple linear regression model on genotypes and RNA-Seq data from Genotype-Tissue Expression project. With stringent permutations, we discovered that on average, 0. 19 % of all genes tested (including non-coding RNAs and pseudogenes) show evidence for dominant genetic associations across ten different tissues. Most dominant effect sizes are positive, implying that the phenotypes of heterozygotes tend to have similar gene expression levels to high-expression homozygotes. In 8 out of the 10 tissues we examined, we found that genes encoding major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins are enriched for dominant effects...|$|R

Detailed genealogic information allowed assignment of 597 individuals to 6 multihousehold pedigrees residing in 145 households. A variance component method was used to partition egg counts into shared household, <b>additive</b> <b>genetic,</b> and individual-specific environmental effects. Host <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> effects consistently accounted for {{a large proportion of}} the variation in egg counts: 43 % in an unadjusted model and 40 % in model adjusted for covariates. In a model that examined the confounding of shared household with kinship, <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> effects still accounted for 27 % of the variation in egg counts and shared household only 12 %. The consistently important role for host <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> factors on the variation in egg counts points to new ways of modeling and understanding the mechanisms that contribute to trait variation during infection with S. mansoni...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in genotyping methodologies have allowed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to accurately identify <b>genetic</b> <b>variants</b> that associate with common or pathological complex traits. Although most GWAS {{have focused on}} associations with single <b>genetic</b> <b>variants,</b> joint identification of multiple <b>genetic</b> <b>variants,</b> and how they interact, is essential for understanding the genetic architecture of complex phenotypic traits. Here, we propose an efficient stepwise method based on the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test (for stratified categorical data) to identify causal joint multiple <b>genetic</b> <b>variants</b> in GWAS. This method combines the CMH statistic with a stepwise procedure to detect multiple <b>genetic</b> <b>variants</b> associated with specific categorical traits, using a series of associated I × J contingency tables and a null hypothesis of no phenotype association. Through a new stratification scheme based on the sum of minor allele count criteria, we make the method more feasible for GWAS data having sample sizes of several thousands. We also examine {{the properties of the}} proposed stepwise method via simulation studies, and show that the stepwise CMH test performs better than other existing methods (e. g., logistic regression and detection of associations by Markov blanket) for identifying multiple <b>genetic</b> <b>variants.</b> Finally, we apply the proposed approach to two genomic sequencing datasets to detect linked <b>genetic</b> <b>variants</b> associated with bipolar disorder and obesity, respectively...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: MiR- 378 {{has been}} {{reported}} to be related to cell survival, tumor growth and angiogenesis and may participate in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development and prognosis. <b>Genetic</b> <b>variants</b> in primary miR- 378 (pri-miR- 378) may impact miR- 378 expression and contribute to HCC risk and survival. This study aimed to assess the associations between a <b>genetic</b> <b>variant</b> in primary miR- 378 and HCC susceptibility and prognosis. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study to analyze the association of rs 1076064 in pri-miR- 378 with hepatocellular carcinoma risk in 1300 HCC patients with positive hepatitis B virus (HBV) and 1344 HBV carriers. Then, we evaluated the correlation between the polymorphism and hepatocellular carcinoma prognosis in 331 HCC patients at either intermediate or advanced stage without surgical treatment. RESULTS: The variant genotypes of rs 1076064 were associated with a decreased HCC risk in HBV carriers [Adjusted odds ratio (OR)  =  0. 90, 95 % confidence intervals (CI)  =  0. 81 - 1. 00, P =  0. 047]. Moreover, HCC patients with the variant genotypes were associated with a better survival [Adjusted hazard ratio (HR)  =  0. 70, 95 % CIs =  0. 59 - 0. 83, P< 0. 0001 in an <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> model]. The reporter gene assay showed that the variant G allele of rs 1076064 exerted higher promoter activity than the A allele. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that rs 1076064 may be a biomarker for HCC susceptibility and prognosis through altering pri-miR- 378 transcription...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Low cost {{genotyping}} {{of individuals}} using high density genomic markers were recently introduced as genomic selection in genetic improvement programs in dairy cattle. Most implementations of genomic selection only use marker information, in the models used for prediction of genetic merit. However, in other species {{it has been}} shown that only a fraction of the total genetic variance can be explained by markers. Using 5217 bulls in the Nordic Holstein population that were genotyped and had genetic evaluations based on progeny, we partitioned the total <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> variance into a genomic component explained by markers and a remaining component explained by familial relationships. The traits analyzed were production and fitness related traits in dairy cattle. Furthermore, we estimated the genomic variance that can be attributed to individual chromosomes and we illustrate methods that can predict the amount of <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> variance that can be explained by sets of markers with different density. Results The amount of <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> variance that can be explained by markers was estimated by an analysis of the matrix of genomic relationships. For the traits in the analysis, most of the <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> variance can be explained by 44 [*]K informative SNP markers. The same amount of variance can be attributed to individual chromosomes but surprisingly the relation between chromosomal variance and chromosome length was weak. In models including both genomic (marker) and familial (pedigree) effects most (on average 77. 2 %) of total <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> variance was explained by genomic effects while the remaining was explained by familial relationships. Conclusions Most of the <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> variance for the traits in the Nordic Holstein population can be explained using 44 [*]K informative SNP markers. By analyzing the genomic relationship matrix it is possible to predict the amount of <b>additive</b> <b>genetic</b> variance that can be explained by a reduced (or increased) set of markers. For the population analyzed the improvement of genomic prediction by increasing marker density beyond 44 [*]K is limited. </p...|$|R
