500|$|Gangut {{was built}} by the Admiralty Works in Saint Petersburg. Her keel was laid down on 16 June 1909 and she was {{launched}} on 22 September 1911. At the end of October 1914, she collided with her sister Poltava which [...] delayed her trials, scheduled for 9 November 1914, [...] to late December 1914. She entered service on 11 January 1915 when she reached Helsingfors and {{was assigned to the}} First Battleship Brigade of the Baltic Fleet. Gangut and her sister [...] provided distant cover for minelaying operations south of Liepāja on 27 August, the furthest that any Russian dreadnought ventured out of the Gulf of Finland during World War I. She ran aground on 10 September, but suffered only minor damage. A minor mutiny broke out on 1 November when the executive officer refused to feed the crew the traditional meal of meat and macaroni after coaling. The return of the captain and the issue of <b>a</b> <b>dinner</b> <b>of</b> tinned meat restored order on the ship. On 10–11 November and 6 December Gangut and her sister [...] again provided distant cover for minelaying operations. She saw no action of any kind during 1916. Her crew joined the general mutiny of the Baltic Fleet on 16 March 1917, after the idle sailors received word of the February Revolution in Saint Petersburg. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk required the Soviets to evacuate their base at Helsinki in March 1918 or have them interned by newly independent Finland even though the Gulf of Finland was still frozen over. Gangut and her sisters led the first group of ships on 12 March and reached Kronstadt five days later in {{what became known as the}} 'Ice Voyage'.|$|E

Profitable parts of the steel industry and the railways had been privatised, along with British Telecom: 'They were like two Rembrandts still left.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Such was {{the extent}} to which {{stronger}} drugs entered cycling that the French team manager, Marcel Bidot, was cited to an inquiry by the Council of Europe as saying: [...] "Three-quarters of riders were doped. I am well placed to know that since I visited their rooms each evening during the Tour. I always left frightened after these visits." [...] At the 1956 Tour, it was evident how much drug-taking and the [...] "care" [...] of riders had changed. After stage 14, all members of the Belgian team chose to abandon the race following a [...] "mystery illness". Insiders suspected doping usage as the real reason, while the team attributed the illness to <b>a</b> <b>dinner</b> <b>of</b> 'bad fish' they had eaten, an excuse which was reused in both 1962 and 1991.|$|E
2500|$|The next year, NATO {{conducted}} a follow-up exercise, Operation Mariner, from September 16 to October 4, 1953. McCormick called Operation Mariner [...] "the most complete and widespread international exercise ever held," [...] involving 500,000 men, 1,000 planes, and 300 ships from nine navies. The exercise tested {{a variety of}} allied naval capabilities, ranging from command relationships to mine warfare and intelligence, although [...] "there was no strategic concept other than Blue was fighting Orange." [...] Convoys crossed the Atlantic while defending against submarines and surface ships. In order [...] "to keep us all atomic minded," [...] both sides launched and defended against simulated nuclear attacks. McCormick viewed the exercise as a qualified success, showing that ships and aircraft of the disparate NATO navies could cooperate effectively even under adverse weather conditions, although there had been problems with communications and logistical support. After the exercise, McCormick told <b>a</b> <b>dinner</b> <b>of</b> the American Council on NATO on October 29, 1953, that the Kremlin was [...] "well aware" [...] {{of the importance of}} the transatlantic sea lane and was readying submarines to fight another possible Battle of the Atlantic. While Operation Mariner had demonstrated that NATO could control the Atlantic given sufficient forces, he warned, [...] "The forces we have available at present to counter the potential underseas menace would be spread precariously thin for this task." ...|$|E
