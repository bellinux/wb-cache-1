50|$|Peer {{review is}} a process that can assist in {{reducing}} instances of confounding, either before study implementation or <b>after</b> analysis <b>has</b> occurred. <b>Peer</b> review relies on collective expertise within a discipline to identify potential weaknesses in study design and analysis, including ways in which results may depend on confounding. Similarly, replication can test for the robustness of findings from one study under alternative study conditions or alternative analyses (e.g., controlling for potential confounds not identified in the initial study).|$|R
5000|$|Mitford was {{an impassioned}} anti-Jacobin from the 1790s, and his {{partiality}} for a monarchy {{led him to}} be unjust to the Athenians. Hence his History of Greece, <b>after</b> <b>having</b> <b>had</b> no <b>peer</b> in European literature for half a century, faded in interest on {{the appearance of the}} work of George Grote. Clinton, too, in his Fasti hellenici, charged Mitford with [...] "a general negligence of dates," [...] though admitting that in his philosophical range [...] "he is far superior to any former writer" [...] on Greek history. Byron, who dilated on Mitford's shortcomings, nevertheless declared that he was [...] "perhaps the best of all modern historians altogether." [...] This Mitford certainly was not, but his preeminence in the little school of English historians who succeeded Hume and Gibbon would be easier to maintain.|$|R

40|$|Peer {{response}} {{is a widely}} researched subject, however, research of it is lacking in the Swedish context, in spite of it {{being part of the}} Swedish curriculum for English (Skolverket, 2011 a). It has proven to be beneficial for students, but mostly on university level thus far (see for example Zhao, 2014; Min, 2005; Cheng & Warren, 2005). Having taken this into consideration, this study set out to answer how students in one class at a Swedish upper secondary school perceive peer response, as well as if the use of peer response affects their writing. In order to answer these questions a questionnaire was administered to 23 students, and seven interviews were conducted. The students’ writing was also collected both prior to, and <b>after</b> <b>having</b> used <b>peer</b> response in order to make an analysis of the changes in their writing possible. The study shows that the students preferred receiving feedback to giving feedback, but still considered themselves learning much through the act of the latter. Analysis of their writing also indicates that they did learn through using peer response, as both the content and form of their writing showed improvements in their final drafts. Finally, {{the results of this study}} indicate that the students did benefit from using peer response, and that they themselves also perceived it as beneficial and were willing to work with it more...|$|R
50|$|The National Park Service in 2003 {{approved}} {{for sale in}} the Grand Canyon National Park bookstore Grand Canyon: A Different View: a book that presents the formation of the Grand Canyon as a result of Biblical events. PEER exposed the selling of this book as preferential treatment of a religion that toes the line of constitutional legality. On January 4, 2007 the National Park Service Chief of Public Affairs, David Barna released a response stating that the National Park Service neither uses the text in their teaching nor do they endorse its content. The release further states that the book is sold in the inspirational section of the bookstore which includes anthropological works on Native American culture. As PEER contests, the inspirational section was only created <b>after</b> <b>PEER</b> <b>had</b> exposed the book’s sale as a natural history. The controversial book remains on sale.|$|R
