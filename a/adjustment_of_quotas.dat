40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{dependency}} <b>of</b> the <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> prices, exchange rates, and production {{on the nature}} of the trade regime. We contrast the adjustment between a quota and a tariff regime for a 'semi-small' economy characterized by monopolistic competitive market structure and short-run nominal contracts under a floating exchange rate regime. Among other issues we focus on the factors determining the behavior <b>of</b> the <b>quota</b> rent and the 'pass- through' <b>of</b> exchange rate <b>adjustment</b> to the domestic prices of importable goods. We demonstrate that the 'pass-through ratio' (measuring the elasticity of the domestic price of importable goods with respect to the exchange rate) is determined by both the commercial policy and by the market power of the various producers. It tends to be higher in a tariff regime because the endogenous <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>quota</b> rent mitigates the 'pass-through'. We also show that the <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> the exchange rate tends to be larger in the quota regime than in the tariff regime. In the tariff regime we observe a larger switch of domestic demand relative to the quota regime, and a corresponding smaller exchange rate adjustment. In the quota regime we observe <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>quota</b> rent such as to keep the net domestic demand for foreign goods intact. As a result, the relative price (of the domestic good to the foreign good) facing the foreign consumer adjusts more in the quota regime than in the tariff regime. At the same time the relative price facing domestic consumers in the quota regime adjusts by less than in the tariff regime. ...|$|R
40|$|Successful {{individual}} transferable quota (ITQ) management {{requires a}} binding (constraining) total allowable catch (TAC). A non-binding TAC {{may result in a}} shift back towards open access conditions, where fishers increasingly compete (‘race’) to catch their share of the total harvest. This process was examined by comparing fishing fleet behaviour and profitability in the Tasmanian southern rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii) fishery (TSRLF), Australia. Between 2008 and 2010, the TSRLF had a non-binding TAC and effectively reverted to a regulated, limited-entry fishery. Fishers' uncertainty about future profitability and their ability to take their allocated catch weakened the security characteristic of the ITQ allocation. The low quota lease price contributed to an increase in fleet capacity, while the more limited reduction in quota asset value proved an investment barrier, hindering the autonomous <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> towards the most efficient fishers. In the TSRLF, catch rates vary more than beach price and are therefore more important for determining daily revenue (i. e., price x catch rate) than market price. Consequently, fishers concentrated effort during times of higher catch rates rather than high market demand. This increased rent dissipation as fishers engaged in competitive race to fish {{to be the first to}} exploit the stock and obtain higher catch rates. The history of this fishery emphasizes the need for a constraining TAC in all ITQ fisheries, not only for stock management, but also to manage the security of the ITQ allocation and prevent unanticipated and undesirable changes in fisher behaviour and fishery profitability...|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{argues that}} the perennial negotiations on <b>adjustments</b> <b>of</b> {{the law of the}} WTO (e. g. by means of the Doha Round negotiations) and of UN law (e. g. <b>adjustments</b> <b>of</b> the IMF <b>quota</b> and voting system, UN climate change regulations) reflect systemic problems of multilevel governance of international public goods (PGs) that call for reviewing traditional regulatory approaches at national and international levels of governance (as discussed in Sections II and III) so as to better respond to the 'collective action problems' of multilevel governance of international PGs (as discussed in Section IV). The concluding Section V draws policy lessons from the WTO agreements adopted at the WTO Ministerial Conference at Bali. Rather than lamenting about 'fragmentation' of UN and WTO law, bilateral, regional and other plurilateral agreements can be justified as necessary instruments for reforming international law for the benefit of citizens; the 'consistent interpretation'-and 'judicial comity'-requirements of national and international legal systems call for interpreting such agreements in conformity with the UN and WTO legal obligations of contracting parties as integral parts of multilevel governance of 'aggregate PGs' demanded by citizens...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMany ports {{are facing}} heavy truck {{congestion}} in the terminal, {{which leads to}} longer truck waiting time and lower operation efficiency. To alleviate congestion and decrease truck turn time in the container terminal, an optimization model for truck appointment was proposed in this paper. In the model, the appointment <b>quota</b> <b>of</b> each period was optimized subject to the constraints <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>quota.</b> And a BCMP queuing network was developed to describe the queuing process of trucks in the terminal. To solve the model, a method based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Point wise Stationary Fluid Flow Approximation (PSFFA) was designed. GA was used to search the optimal solution and PSFFA was designed to calculate the truck waiting time. Finally, numerical experiments were provided to illustrate {{the validity of the}} model and algorithm. The results indicate that the proposed PSFFA method can estimate the queue length accurately and the model can decrease the truck turn time efficiently...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a general equilibrium approach to calculating labour adjustment costs induced by trade policy changes or external sector shocks, which we illustrate {{by analyzing the}} <b>adjustment</b> consequences <b>of</b> eliminating <b>quotas</b> and tariffs on U. S. imports. In our approach, factor adjustments {{in the presence of}} transactions costs are endogenously determined within the equilibrium structure. The conventional way of calculating such labour adjustment costs is to use full equilibrium models which exclude adjustment costs, and apply exogenous estimates of duration of unemployment to implied intersectoral labour reallocations. By using an equilibrium model in which adjustment costs are absent, the conventional approach tends to overstate the amount of labour that moves to other sectors and hence introduces an upward bias to estimates <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> costs. As well, such an approach tends to ignore the impact on intersectoral wage rates. Our results suggest that concerns over adjustment problems should focus as much on the consequences <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> costs in impeding factor mobility, as on the magnitude <b>of</b> the <b>adjustment</b> costs themselves. Compared to the redistributive effects they induce by inhibiting labour movement in response to policy or other changes, these costs may be small. ...|$|R
40|$|Skills {{are the key}} {{elements}} contributing to the prosperity of nations and to better lives for individuals. That is why countries have invested heavily in skills over past decades. For workers, skills mean employability and social mobility. For society, skills represent {{a major component of}} its productivity, competitiveness and innovation. An important dimension of labour market disequilibria is the mismatch of supply and demand of different skills at the sectoral, regional and occupational levels. This is due to slow <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> skill structures in periods of rapid structural change that characterizes the post-transition economy. Skill mismatches may be caused by ineffective signalling of labour market demands to education and training providers and to individuals, but they are very often a consequence of a lack of responsiveness on the part of education and training providers to information about skills demand. Croatia is not unique in having a relatively high interest for adjusting (matching) educational output with dynamic trends on the labour market. Croatia does not have a system of labour market information on occupational trends. Thus, it is impossible to specify which kinds of future requirements and unmet demands are commonly perceived. Taking into account the process of globalization process Croatia is undergoing, economic restructuring and the pressures of competition, demographic factors, there is an obvious need for more effective planning and management of the education system particularly to put more attention to long-term forecasting of labour market needs. Thus, {{it will be necessary to}} monitor systematically the labour market and occupational trends to insure better labour market information on occupational trends. Furthermore, it is important to provide and/or improve transparent information on employment status of graduates from various education programmes, and to insure more fl exible <b>adjustments</b> <b>of</b> enrolment <b>quotas</b> in education and training programmes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Since the 1950 s, {{global trade}} in {{textiles}} and clothing has seen {{the evolution of a}} global system <b>of</b> bilateral <b>quotas</b> governing North-South trade in textiles and wearing apparel. As of 2005, these have been removed {{under the terms of the}} 1995 Agreement on Textiles and Clothing. In theory, the ATC was to have led to a smooth and progressive liberalization in the sector. In reality and especially when looking at trade flows from China, it appears that political leaders throughout the ATC period instead backloaded the problem <b>of</b> <b>adjustment,</b> delaying much <b>of</b> it until the very end of the ATC. In this paper, we explore econometrically the evolution of market access conditions in the textile and clothing sectors (T&C). Working with a panel of bilateral trade data on textile and clothing trade, underlying bilateral tariffs, and the coverage <b>of</b> <b>quotas</b> under the WTOs Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) we first develop an estimation framework for calculating the tax equivalents <b>of</b> ATC <b>quota</b> restrictions on bilateral trade. Within this framework, we track the price impact <b>of</b> the <b>quotas</b> through the ten year phase-out period. We also discuss a major concern of LDC exporters the impact <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> elimination on market access. Finally, as these quotas are a potentially significant omitted variable, the ATC episode provides us with an opportunity to examine the impact <b>of</b> bilateral <b>quotas</b> on the econometric estimation of trade elasticities...|$|R
