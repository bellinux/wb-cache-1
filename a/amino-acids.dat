5|$|As {{early as}} the 1920s Antoine Lacassagne, using {{polonium}} provided by his colleague Marie Curie, showed that the element has a specific pattern of uptake in rabbit tissues, with high concentrations, particularly in liver, kidney, and testes. More recent evidence suggests that this behavior results from polonium substituting for its congener sulfur, also in group 16 of the periodic table, in sulfur-containing <b>amino-acids</b> or related molecules and that similar patterns of distribution occur in human tissues. Polonium is indeed an element naturally present in all humans, contributing appreciably to natural background dose, with wide geographical and cultural variations, and particularly high levels in arctic residents, for example.|$|E
5|$|When {{taken up}} into the human body from the diet, the 20 {{standard}} amino acids either are used to synthesize proteins and other biomolecules or are oxidized to urea and carbon dioxide {{as a source of}} energy. The oxidation pathway starts with the removal of the amino group by a transaminase; the amino group is then fed into the urea cycle. The other product of transamidation is a keto acid that enters the citric acid cycle. Glucogenic amino acids can also be converted into glucose, through gluconeogenesis. Of the 20 standard amino acids, nine (His, Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, Phe, Thr, Trp and Val) are called essential amino acids because the human body cannot synthesize them from other compounds at the level needed for normal growth, so they must be obtained from food. In addition, cysteine, taurine, tyrosine, and arginine are considered semiessential <b>amino-acids</b> in children (though taurine is not technically an amino acid), because the metabolic pathways that synthesize these amino acids are not fully developed. The amounts required also depend on the age and health of the individual, so it is hard to make general statements about the dietary requirement for some amino acids. Dietary exposure to the non-standard amino acid BMAA has been linked to human neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{identification}} of peptides from tandem mass spectra {{is an important}} part of many high-throughput proteomics pipelines. In the high-throughput setting, the spectra are typically identified using software that matches tandem mass spectra with putative peptides from <b>amino-acid</b> sequence databases. The effectiveness of these search engines depends heavily on the completeness of the <b>amino-acid</b> sequence database used, but suitably complete <b>amino-acid</b> sequence databases are large, and the sequence database search engines typically have search times that are proportional to the size of the sequence database. We demonstrate that the peptide content of an <b>amino-acid</b> sequence database can be represented by a reformulated <b>amino-acid</b> sequence database containing fewer <b>amino-acid</b> symbols than the original. In some cases, where the original <b>amino-acid</b> sequence database contains many redundant peptides, we have been able to reduce the size of the aminoacid sequence to almost half of its original size. We develop a lower bound for achievable compression and demonstrate empirically that regardless of the peptide redundancy of the original <b>amino-acid</b> sequence database, we can compress the sequence to within 15 - 25 % of this lower bound. We believe this may provide a principled way to combine <b>amino-acid</b> sequence data from many sources without unduly bloating the resulting sequence database with redundant peptide sequences. ...|$|R

25|$|PDZ {{proteins}} are {{a family}} of proteins that contain the PDZ domain. This sequence of <b>amino-acids</b> is found in many thousands of known proteins. PDZ domain proteins are widespread in eukaryotes and eubacteria, whereas {{there are very few}} examples of the protein in archaea. PDZ domains are often associated with other protein domains and these combinations allow them to carry out their specific functions. Three of the most well documented PDZ proteins are PSD-95, GRIP, and HOMER.|$|E

Coffee ground are sterile, and rich in fibers. It is more environmentally-friendly; as an estimated millions of kilos of coffee waste disposed in landfill every day, which could be diverted into sustainable food production.

25|$|GHB induces the {{accumulation}} of either a derivative of tryptophan or tryptophan itself in the extracellular space, possibly by increasing tryptophan transport across the blood–brain barrier. The blood content of certain neutral <b>amino-acids,</b> including tryptophan, is also increased by peripheral GHB administration. GHB-induced stimulation of tissue serotonin turnover {{may be due to}} an increase in tryptophan transport to the brain and in its uptake by serotonergic cells. As the serotonergic system may be involved in the regulation of sleep, mood, and anxiety, the stimulation of this system by high doses of GHB may be involved in certain neuropharmacological events induced by GHB administration.|$|E
40|$|Increased {{demand for}} amino acids to sustain acute-phase protein {{synthesis}} {{could be the}} stimulus for the increased muscle protein catabolism during hemodialysis (HD). This could be attenuated by intradialytic <b>amino-acid</b> infusion. To test this, we measured the fractional synthesis rates of albumin, fibrinogen, and muscle protein in eight patients with end-stage renal disease at baseline before dialysis and during HD without or with <b>amino-acid</b> infusion. The percentage change in the fractional synthesis rates of albumin, fibrinogen, and muscle protein from baseline was significantly higher during HD with <b>amino-acid</b> infusion than without <b>amino-acid</b> infusion. Leg muscle proteolysis was significantly increased during unsupplemented HD compared with baseline, {{but this was not}} decreased by <b>amino-acid</b> infusion. Arteriovenous balance studies across the leg showed a net efflux of interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) from the muscle into the vein during HD. The fractional synthesis rate of albumin, fibrinogen, and muscle protein correlated {{with each other and with}} the IL- 6 efflux from the leg. Leg muscle protein catabolism was positively related to IL- 6 release from the leg and not associated with <b>amino-acid</b> availability. Our results show that intradialytic cytokine activation and not <b>amino-acid</b> depletion is the major protein catabolic signal during HD...|$|R

40|$|The {{mutation}} {{pattern in}} protein {{is a very}} important feature and is studied through various approaches including the study on mutation pattern in domains where amino acids are converted into numbers from letters. In this study, we converted the amino acids in human adrenoleukodystrophy protein with its 128 missense mutations into random domain using the <b>amino-acid</b> pair predictability, and then we studied their mutation patterns. The results show 1) the mutations are more likely to target the <b>amino-acid</b> pairs whose actual frequency is larger than their predicted one, 2) the mutations are more likely to form the <b>amino-acid</b> pairs whose actual frequency is smaller than their predicted frequency, 3) mutations are more likely to occur at unpredictable <b>amino-acid</b> pairs, and 4) mutations have the trend to narrow the difference between predicted and actual frequencies of <b>amino-acid</b> pairs...|$|R
25|$|SAO {{is caused}} by a {{mutation}} in the gene encoding the erythrocyte band 3 protein. There is a deletion of codons 400-408 in the gene, leading to a deletion of 9 <b>amino-acids</b> at the boundary between the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of band 3 protein. Band 3 serves as the principal binding site for the membrane skeleton, a submembrane protein network composed of ankyrin, spectrin, actin, and band 4.1. Ovalocyte band 3 binds more tightly than normal band 3 to ankyrin, which connects the membrane skeleton to the band 3 anion transporter. These qualitative defects create a red blood cell membrane that is less tolerant of shear stress and more susceptible to permanent deformation.|$|E

2500|$|The PDZ domain is {{a common}} {{structural}} domain of 80-90 <b>amino-acids</b> found in the signaling proteins of bacteria, yeast, plants, viruses and animals. Proteins containing PDZ domains {{play a key role}} in anchoring receptor proteins in the membrane to cytoskeletal components. PDZ is an initialism combining the first letters of the first three proteins discovered to share the domain — post synaptic density protein (PSD95), Drosophila disc large tumor suppressor (Dlg1), and zonula occludens-1 protein (zo-1). PDZ domains have previously been referred to as DHR (Dlg homologous region) or GLGF (glycine-leucine-glycine-phenylalanine) domains. Proteins with these domains help hold together and organize signaling complexes at cellular membranes. These domains {{play a key role in}} the formation and function of signal transduction complexes. PDZ domains also play a highly significant role in the anchoring of cell surface receptors (such as Cftr and FZD7) to the actin cytoskeleton [...] via mediators like NHERF and ezrin.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} genotypic {{drug resistance}} patterns of HIV- 1 {{in patients who}} were extensively pretreated with anti-HIV drugs and not responding to their current antiretroviral combination therapy. METHODS: Drug susceptibility of the viruses was tested by a phenotypic recombinant virus assay. Genotypic analysis of HIV resistance was performed by sequencing of the amino-terminal part of the corresponding reverse transcriptase (RT) gene (amino acids 1 - 280) for serum-derived and recombinant viruses. RESULTS: Among viruses from 92 patients studied, three (3 %) viruses contained a T 215 Y <b>amino-acid</b> change {{as well as a}} previously unseen combination of an <b>amino-acid</b> change at codon 67 (N [...] >E/S) and a two <b>amino-acid</b> insertion between codons 68 and 69 of the RT gene of HIV- 1. Phenotypic resistance analysis showed high levels of resistance to zidovudine, lamivudine and stavudine (in all patients) and moderate levels of resistance to didanosine and zalcitabine (in two patients), whereas neither serum-derived nor recombinant viruses contained previously known <b>amino-acid</b> changes conferring resistance to didanosine, zalcitabine, lamivudine and stavudine. However, all recombinant viruses contained an insertion of two amino acids between codons 68 and 69 of RT as well as an <b>amino-acid</b> change at codon 67, as was seen in the serum-derived viruses. CONCLUSIONS: Antiretroviral therapy including zidovudine may yield replicating viruses with a two <b>amino-acid</b> insertion in RT in combination with <b>amino-acid</b> changes at codons 67 and 215, which are highly resistant to lamivudine and stavudine on top of zidovudine and have unpredictable susceptibility to didanosine and zalcitabine despite lack of previously reported corresponding resistance-associated <b>amino-acid</b> changes. It is currently unknown what regimens can induce the emergence of this type of multidrug-resistant viruses. This will only be elucidated when resistance assays are capable of detecting these mutant...|$|R
