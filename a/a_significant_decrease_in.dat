40|$|Abstract: Aim: The goal of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of endurance training program on heart failure (HF) patients. Material: Ten male patients with stable HF and class II and III in NYAHA, age - years old, ejection fraction (EF) < %. The exercise program consists of minutes exercise session for three times per week. Method: all patients were evaluated prior and post four weeks and eight weeks of the training program. The patient started with stretching exercise as warming up for minutes, following by 	 minutes cycling on ergometer and the session end with 	 minutes of stretching exercise. Results: <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> increase in cardiac output (. ±. L/min. to. ±. L/min. - p:.); <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> increase in EF (. 	 ±	. % to. ±	. % - p:.); <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> increase in maximum heart rate (max.

5|$|Following the {{periodic}} trend, oganesson {{would be expected}} to be slightly more reactive than radon. However, theoretical calculations have shown that it could be significantly more reactive. In addition to being far more reactive than radon, oganesson may be even more reactive than the elements flerovium and copernicium, which are heavier homologs of the more chemically active elements lead and mercury respectively. The reason for the possible enhancement of the chemical activity of oganesson relative to radon is an energetic destabilization and a radial expansion of the last occupied 7p-subshell. More precisely, considerable spin–orbit interactions between the 7p electrons and the inert 7s2 electrons effectively lead to a second valence shell closing at flerovium, and <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> stabilization of the closed shell of oganesson. It has also been calculated that oganesson, unlike the other noble gases, binds an electron with release of energy—or in other words, it exhibits positive electron affinity, due to the relativistically stabilized 8s energy level and the destabilized 7p3/2 level.|$|E
5|$|Upon first {{becoming}} a subtropical cyclone, Andrea was {{embedded within a}} large, nearly stationary deep-layer trough, resulting in a westward movement. Drifting over sea surface temperatures {{of no more than}} 77°F (25°C), the organization of the system deteriorated with <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> convection. By early on May 10, much of the associated weather was located to the east of the cyclone within a band of moderate convection due to a brief spell of westerly vertical wind shear. The center of circulation had become disorganized, with several small cloud swirls within the larger circulation. This disorganization of the center, combined with increasing wind shear and dry air suppressing convective activity, caused it to begin weakening later that morning. By 1500UTC on May 10, only a few thunderstorms remained near the center, and thus the NHC downgraded Andrea to subtropical depression status. Though a few intermittent thunderstorms persisted over the eastern semicircle, the depression remained disorganized and weak; the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories early on May 11, after it had been without significant deep convection for 18hours about 80miles (125km) northeast of Cape Canaveral, Florida.|$|E

5|$|The ethnic Chinese {{population}} in Indonesia grew {{by an average}} of 4.3 percent annually between 1920 and 1930. It then slowed owing to the effects of the Great Depression and many areas experienced a net emigration. Falling growth rates were also attributed to <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> the number of Chinese immigrants admitted into Indonesia since the 1950s. The population is relatively old according to the 2000 census, having the lowest percentage of population under 14 years old nationwide and the second-highest percentage of population over 65. Their population pyramid had a narrow base with a rapid increase until the 15–19 age group, indicating a rapid decline in total fertility rates. This was evidenced by a decline in the absolute number of births since 1980. In Jakarta and West Java the population peak occurred in the 20–24 age group, indicating that the decline in fertility rates began as early as 1975. The upper portion of the pyramid exhibited a smooth decline with increasing population age. It is estimated that 60.7 percent of the Chinese Indonesian {{population in}} 2000 constitute the generation which experienced political and social pressures under the New Order government. With an average life expectancy of 75 years, those who spent their formative years prior to this regime will completely disappear by 2032.|$|E

40|$|Background: Asthma is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} {{condition of the}} airways. Pain and anxiety triggered by dental treatment can induce the secretion of endogenous catecholamines. When the situation is combined {{with the use of}} local anesthetics with vasoconstrictors, it may increase its undesirable effects on the cardiovascular system and respiratory systems. Aim of the work: To evaluate the effects of dental procedures with and without local anesthesia on pulmonary function and arterial oxygen saturation in healthy volunteers and asthmatic patients. Patients and methods: Our study included 30 asthmatic patients, and 20 healthy volunteers. Careful history taking, clinical examination, spirometry and pulse oximetry to measure O 2 saturation before and 10  min after dental procedures were obtained.
