With cover spalling, as illustrated in the proposed anchor shear reinforcement in Fig.  4, the shear behavior of concrete anchors would be different from that in pure shear as assumed by ACI 318 (2011). The double shear tests of <b>anchor</b> <b>rods</b> by Lin et al. (2013) provides understanding of the complex stresses in an exposed anchor shaft. However, the model failed accurately predicting the shear capacity of the anchors in this study, likely because the exiting model does not consider partial support from concrete cover before spalling.|$|R

40|$|Abstract:The creep {{character}} of <b>anchor</b> <b>rod</b> in argillaceous soft rock is remarkable. The big undisturbed mudstone samples in Nanning Basin {{as a typical}} argillaceous soft rock is chosen to the research object in this paper. The laboratory simulated destructive tests and the creep tests of full grouted <b>anchor</b> <b>rod</b> have been down. Through the destructive tests of mudstone sample, the instantaneous adhesive strength between the anchor body and mudstone in Nanning Basin is 70 kPa. By analyzing the creep curves of <b>anchor</b> <b>rod,</b> a conclusion {{is that there is}} a long-term adhesive strength of <b>anchor</b> <b>rod</b> in argillaceous soft rock. When the design adhesive strength of <b>anchor</b> <b>rod</b> is less than the long-term adhesive strength, eventually the <b>anchor</b> <b>rod</b> is stable during the process of long-term pull-out. When the design adhesive strength of <b>anchor</b> <b>rod</b> is greater than the value, the creep of <b>anchor</b> <b>rod</b> with the time will do not stop until the <b>anchor</b> <b>rod</b> failure. The greater difference value between the instantaneous and long-term adhesive strength, the faster the rate of creep, the faster the <b>anchor</b> <b>rod</b> failure. Finally, for the permanent support engineering design of <b>anchor</b> <b>rod</b> in argillaceous soft rock, the paper gives two principles, as follows: (1) the design of <b>anchor</b> <b>rod</b> in argillaceous soft rock must be determined according to the long-term adhesive strength.
