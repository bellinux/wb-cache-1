25|$|In 1954, Gerald Gardner, {{a retired}} English civil servant {{who had spent}} most of his life in the far east, {{published}} Witchcraft Today in which he made the claim to have encountered members of the Witch-Cult. At the same time he propagated his religion to new adherents, largely through the Bricket Wood coven (which is described further below).

Nevertheless, Long's uprising was significant because of its abnormal roots. It was the first uprising led by a self-styled religious leader whose support base came about due to man-made discontent. Prior to Long, peasant uprisings with religious themes had always been preceded by floods, outbreaks of disease, famine, crop failure or other natural phenomena, as sections of the rural populace attributed such disasters to {{the wrath of the}} heavens and sought help from leaders who purported to have supernatural powers.|$|E

2500|$|Much of this {{controversy}} {{was captured by}} the Discovery Channel while filming the television program [...] A crucial decision affecting the fate of Sharp {{is shown in the}} program, where an early returning climber Lebanese adventurer Maxim Chaya is descending from the summit and radios to his base camp manager (Russell Brice) that he has found a frostbitten and unconscious climber in distress. Chaya is unable to identify Sharp, who had chosen to climb solo without any support and so did not identify himself to other climbers. The base camp manager assumes that Sharp is part of <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> already calculated that they must abandon him, and informs his lone climber that there is no chance of him being able to help Sharp by himself. As Sharp's condition deteriorates through the day and other descending climbers pass him, his opportunities for rescue diminish: his legs and feet curl from frostbite, preventing him from walking; the later descending climbers are lower on oxygen and lack the strength to offer aid; time runs out for any Sherpas to return and rescue him.|$|E
