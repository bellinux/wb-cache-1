Campaigns also includes screening of films and conferences to provoke reflection on social values. In February there is a day of technical conferences, celebration of peace, sports, and feasting. A five-day Ignatian Way pilgrimage offers students reflection, adventure, and knowledge of the Society of Jesus. The role of tutors in offering help with personal problems is, if anything, taken more seriously with students in the vocational program.

By the middle of the 20 th century, the NCAA was more focused on upholding the amateur ideal of college sports than the safety of players. Today, defining the organization’s primary function depends on who you ask. The NCAA’s stated mission is to, “govern competition in a fair, safe, equitable and sportsmanlike manner, and to integrate intercollegiate athletics into higher education so that the educational experience of the student-athlete is paramount ” (NCAA, 2005 c). Student-athletes and faculty wonder if academics are really an important concern of the Association, as athletes register for bogus classes in an attempt to stay eligible and miss untold hours of <b>class</b> and <b>study</b> <b>time</b> practicing, traveling, and playing.

3000|$|Two serious {{problems}} encountered during the mining of association rules with maximum single constraints are that (1) their cardinality grows exponentially, and the known algorithms for mining them typically generate numerous redundancies and duplicates and (2) their constraints are frequently modified. We generate {{a solution to}} this problem with a mathematical approach. Starting with a lattice [...] L C G of closed itemset and their generators, which are suitable for use with frequently modified constraints, we efficiently extract the corresponding frequent sub itemsets. Based on this lattice, a proposed suitable equivalence relation partitions the set of association rules with maximum single constraints into disjoint equivalence classes.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 187 - 196) This qualitative case study explores the influence of outdoor learning on high school student's engagement in core academic content courses. Students placed at risk of school failure benefit from instructional supports that help them stay engaged in learning. This study examined the learning experiences of 14 at-risk students within four grade 9 and 10 core classes, including English 1 - 2, Biology 1 - 2, Algebra Explorations 1 - 2, and Geometry 1 - 2. Each student participant was observed across three separate outdoor lessons. Students took photographs of their experiences in the outdoors and participated in photo-mediated individual and/or focus group interviews. Three teacher research participants provided lesson plans for review and participated in interviews before and <b>after</b> <b>class</b> observations. <b>Study</b> findings support {{a growing body of}} research that connects high quality learning environments with student engagement: academic, behavioral, psychological, and social. Teacher assessments, student reports, and student class grades reflected increased conceptual understanding of core concepts through hands-on learning activities supported by group work in a number of flexible, open spaces on campus. The students appreciated the fresh air, green environment, open spaces, views, ease of movement, and close relationship to nature. They also valued having a choice of how and with whom they worked, as well as freedom from the direct supervision of their teachers. Students also voiced appreciation for their teachers' demonstrated respect and trust in them. Study findings advance understanding how teachers leverage certain facility and school site conditions and design features to increase student engagement in learning.

Nine fifth grade students and seven parents were interviewed using life-story methods to elicit participants 2 ̆ 7 perceptions regarding how the students 2 ̆ 7 study of nonviolence affected their beliefs and behaviors. Data were coded and then analyzed utilizing constant comparison methods. Analysis of interview transcripts resulted in two categories of data-the fifth grade experience and social and personal change. Analysis of interview transcripts revealed that the fifth grade experience had three distinct phases-a phase of initial anxiety and concern, a middle phase during which the class began to build relationships and recast their relationship with their teacher, and a third phase reflecting what occurred during and <b>after</b> the <b>class</b> <b>study</b> of nonviolence. Within the larger context of what occurred during and after their study of nonviolence, nine sub-themes emerged: the teacher 2 ̆ 7 s role, a university peace educators influence, parental reaction, students as leaders, a sense of public presence, the development of relationships, and shared values between home and school. Interview transcripts also revealed changes in the classroom environment, the teacher, the parents and students 2 ̆ 7 beliefs and behaviors. Students were more accepting of differences, more likely to refrain from negative self-talk, more apt to speak up for themselves and others, more likely to think before acting and more prone to serve as peacemakers.

Most students did not meet success during educational period due to the poor skill ability in learning and studying. This research has carried out in order to compare the successful and unsuccessful students ith related to the study's methods in Yazd medical university. Methods : This is a descriptive-analytical research. The participants of this study were medical, nurse and midwifery students of Yazd medical university. Successful student (SS) and unsuccessful (USS) was defined as 10 % of upper part of highest (n= 46) and 10 % of lower part of lowest (n= 45) average university, respectively and recruited in this study. The data of this research were been collected by questionnaire. Its reliability proved by three learning specialists and its validity was determined using test-retest at the intervals of two weeks on 30 students (r= 0. 765) data analyzed by SPSS software using Pearson correlation and t- test. Results : There was a significant difference between two groups according to their average in diploma (17. 21 vs 13. 39) and university average (11. 74 vs 18) in SS and USS groups, respectively.
