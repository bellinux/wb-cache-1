5000|$|Evan Fraser, a {{geographer}} at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada, {{explores the}} ways in which climate change may affect future famines. To do this, he draws on a range of historic cases where relatively small environmental problems triggered famines as a way of creating theoretical links between climate and famine in the future. Drawing on situations as diverse as the Great Irish Potato Famine, a series of weather induced famines in Asia during the late 19th century, and famines in Ethiopia during the 1980s, he concludes there are three [...] "lines of defense" [...] that protect a community's food security from environmental change. The first line of defense is the <b>agro-ecosystem</b> on which food is produced: diverse ecosystems with well managed soils high in organic matter tend to be more resilient. The second line of defense is the wealth and skills of individual households: If those households affected by bad weather such as drought have savings or skills {{they may be able to}} do all right despite the bad weather. The final line of defense is created by the formal institutions present in a society. Governments, churches, or NGOs must be willing and able to mount effective relief efforts. Pulling this together, Evan Fraser argues that if an ecosystem is resilient enough, it may be able to withstand weather-related shocks. But if these shocks overwhelm the ecosystem's line of defense, it is necessary for the household to adapt using its skills and savings. If a problem is too big for the family or household, then people must rely on the third line of defense, which is whether or not the formal institutions present in a society are able to provide help. Evan Fraser concludes that in almost every situation where an environmental problem triggered a famine you see a failure in each of these three lines of defense. Hence, understanding how climate change may cause famines in the future requires combining both an assessment of local socio-economic and environmental factors along with climate models that predict where bad weather may occur in the future ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Theoretical {{considerations}} on {{the paths}} of invasion of weeds are described with special mention of the invasive traits and spread of weedy species in terrestrial and aquatic <b>agro-ecosystems</b> in Malaysia. A sizeable number of introduced, naturalized, and native plant species in Malaysia have established and spread as invasive weed species, and some are classified as scheduled pests under the Plant Quarantine Act 1976 and Plant Quarantine Regulations 1981. Population increase, intensive agricultural and forestry practices, urbanization, and degradation and fragmentation of natural habitats {{are some of the}} driving anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic forces that increase the movement of weed species and new invasions. Today there are more than 100 weed species in our <b>agro-ecosystems,</b> many of which are invasive. The paths of invasion of weeds in our <b>agro-ecosystems</b> are largely unknown. Management of invasive weed species in Malaysian <b>agro-ecosystems</b> are very much herbicide-based, integrated with other control measures including cultural practices, prescribed burning, animal grazing, and to certain extent, followed by manual and mechanical roughing. Successful management of noxious invasives in our ecosystems will require the development of a long-term strategy incorporating prevention programmes, extension and educational activities, and sustainable and educational multi-year integrated approaches that prevent reinvasion or encroachment by other noxious invasive weed species.

Total of 177 tree species belonging to 52 families, representing 2930 individuals, were recorded. Differences occurred between the forest and agro ecosystem landscape in terms of species richness, family richness and number of individuals observed, with a decrease in <b>agro-ecosystem</b> compared to forest landscape. Species similarity was low between the forest and <b>agro-ecosystem</b> landscapes. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index was higher for forest landscape (5. 6) with more evenness in distribution.
