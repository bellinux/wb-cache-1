5|$|As part of {{his attempt}} to balance the budget, Corzine {{decreased}} funding to most programs and localities including state universities and colleges. The first of these decreases came with the 2007 budget. Rutgers University and other New Jersey state universities have raised tuition, cut hundreds of sections of classes, and several sports teams. With the latest decrease in funding for 2009, most state institutions have less funding than they had <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>ago.</b> Despite the $15 million in cuts, Rutgers went ahead with previous agreed upon raises of $15 million to their executive faculty. This resulted in Rutgers making $30 million in cuts.|$|E

25|$|The {{cookbook}} {{method of}} teaching introductory statistics leaves {{no time for}} history, philosophy or controversy. Hypothesis testing has been taught as received unified method. Surveys showed that graduates of the class were filled with philosophical misconceptions (on all aspects of statistical inference) that persisted among instructors. While the problem was addressed more than <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>ago,</b> and calls for educational reform continue, students still graduate from statistics classes holding fundamental misconceptions about hypothesis testing. Ideas for improving the teaching of hypothesis testing include encouraging students to search for statistical errors in published papers, teaching the history of statistics and emphasizing the controversy in a generally dry subject.|$|E
25|$|The Wayne County Airport Authority saw the {{potential}} for growth in the air transportation sector almost <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>ago</b> and began a capital improvement plan for the airport. The three original terminals from the 1950s were replaced by two new state-of-the-art terminals that opened in 2002 and 2008, respectively. Other major infrastructure improvements {{have been made to}} the runways, cargo facilities, and the terminals themselves with an eye toward increasing the airport’s capacity. At the time, the FAA forecasted a 15.2% growth in passenger travel from 2005 to 2010, and another 12.8% increase from 2010 to 2015. It was projected that the construction projects themselves would create 4,470 jobs, with an additional 21,500 jobs statewide due to increased passenger traffic.|$|E
25|$|Dendritic spines {{were first}} {{described}} {{at the end}} of the 19th century by Santiago Ramón y Cajal on cerebellar neurons. Ramón y Cajal then proposed that dendritic spines could serve as contacting sites between neurons. This was demonstrated more than 50 years later thanks to the emergence of electron microscopy. Until the development of confocal microscopy on living tissues, it was commonly admitted that spines were formed during embryonic development and then would remain stable after birth. In this paradigm, variations of synaptic weight were considered as sufficient to explain memory processes at the cellular level. But since about <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>ago,</b> new techniques of confocal microscopy demonstrated that dendritic spines are indeed motile and dynamic structures that undergo a constant turnover, even after birth.|$|E

25|$|Miss Anderson's {{debut as}} Gilda, {{although}} belated, {{could not have}} been more welcome. The Metropolitan is not rich in artists of this caliber. The tall soprano left America <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>ago</b> to build a phenomenal European career, chiefly in the florid works of Bellini, Donizetti and Rossini. She demonstrated in a Caro nome of exquisite taste, effortless fluidity and pinpoint precision that she is a master of the bel canto style. She is comfortable above high C, but the lower ranges do not suffer in quality or power. The wide leaps of the Caro nome coda were taken effortlessly and squarely on the note. The Met audience does not often hear a trill as thrushlike and as precise as Miss Anderson's, nor a soprano who can soar as grandly over the ensemble in the quartet.|$|E
25|$|Experimental and {{statistical}} criticisms followed. Until approximately <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>ago,</b> critics of Bateman’s model {{focused on his}} experimental design. In recent years, they have shifted attention to the actual experimental {{and statistical}} calculations Bateman published throughout his trials. Birkhead wrote a 2000 review arguing that the since Bateman’s experiments lasted only three to four days, the female fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, may not have needed to mate repeatedly, as it can store sperm for up to four days; if Bateman had used a species in which females had to copulate more often to fertilize their eggs, the results might have been different. Snyder and Gowaty (2007) conducted the first in-depth {{analysis of the data}} in Bateman’s 1948 paper. They found many sampling biases, mathematical errors, and even statistical misinterpretations.|$|E
25|$|The {{architectural}} {{styles of}} these churches vary from Gothic to Renaissance to Churrigueresque and Neoclassical, with many mixing elements {{of two or}} more. A number also have Talavera tile as a decorative feature, which is common in Puebla. A few have intricate stucco work done by indigenous hands. These churches together contain more than 300 works of art from the 16th to 19th centuries, which have a total value of millions of dollars. Increases in the theft of religious art {{have led to a}} number of measures being taken to protect them. Over <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>ago,</b> churches were routinely open during the week, but now many are not. When they are open, many have at least one guard on duty, {{or in the case of}} the Nuestra Señora de los Remedios church, video surveillance.
