5|$|Five minutes later, the Allied ships spotted {{clouds of}} smoke {{on the horizon}} and Acton ordered the Italian ships to attack shortly {{afterwards}} while the two British cruisers turned {{to cut off the}} two Austrian destroyers.

5|$|Most capable Soviet tank at Kursk was the T-34, the {{original}} version was armed with a 76.2mm gun, the gun struggled against uparmoured Panzer IVs, and the frontal armour of Tigers and Panthers was essentially impenetrable.

5|$|On 4 June, as per the agreement, all U.S. and Thai {{personnel}} {{left the}} country, leaving 50–60,000 PAVN troops still ensconced within Laos.

5|$|Sasaki {{described}} her fighting style as revolving around her dual weapons, comparing her to previous series character Cervantes {{but with the}} combination of her spear and short sword weapons allowing for both long distance and close-quarters combat. Control of her weapons is mapped to different inputs from the player's controller, allowing the attacks to be combined and create different horizontal and vertical strikes. However, as a result <b>at</b> <b>long</b> range Hilde's attacks become limited to entirely linear strikes.|$|E
5|$|The 5.7×28mm {{projectile}} potentially poses {{less risk}} of collateral damage than conventional pistol bullets, because the projectile design limits overpenetration, {{as well as}} risk of ricochet. The lightweight projectile also poses less risk of collateral damage {{in the event of}} a miss, because it loses much of its kinetic energy after traveling only 400 m (437yd), whereas a conventional pistol bullet such as the 9×19mm retains significant energy beyond 800 m (875yd). This range exceeds the engagement distances expected for the 5.7×28mm cartridge's intended applications, so the cartridge's limited energy <b>at</b> <b>long</b> range is not conversely considered to be disadvantageous.|$|E

Investigators examined the four charred engines and concluded all were producing power at the point of impact. They could not conclusively determine the amount of power being produced, but stated there was no evidence found in the wreckage that suggested the engines might have suffered an operational failure.|$|E
5|$|The damage Vertu {{had taken}} {{early in the}} combat {{rendered}} Lhermitte unable to continue the action, and his ship gradually {{fell out of the}} line to the south. Captain Pierre Julien Tréhouart turned Cybèle away too, using sweeps to reach Vertu and take the ship under tow. With Vertu secured and Arrogant slowly coming back into range, Sercey ordered his squadron to turn away to the north at 10:55, the last shots fired <b>at</b> <b>long</b> range from Victorious at 11:15.|$|E
