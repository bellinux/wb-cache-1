Although Ostrach had been a hard-fought battle, at Engen and Stockach, the Austrian and French forces were far more concentrated—more men in a smaller space—than they had been at Ostrach, where the French forces in particular had been stretched thinly on a long line from Lake Constance to north of the Danube. At Stockach, furthermore, Jourdan had all his troops under his direct control, {{with the possible exception}} of Dominique Vandamme, who was maneuvering his small force of cavalry and light infantry into position to attempt a flanking action on the far right Austrian flank.|$|E

She later mentioned several times that she had not originally intended to tour in support of the album, referring to her [...] "illegal tour" [...] and apologizing for her breaking her promise not to tour on stage at the Xcel Energy Center in Saint Paul, Minnesota on November 14 and admitting [...] "I just wanted to make a record.

In a September interview with MTV News, Stefani said of the tour: [...] "I'm looking forward to it, it's going to be unbelievable.

I mean, there's what the writers think and what I've sort of thought, and in my mind. Maybe I had a crush in high school or in college or something— there was something, but I don't think it's ever— I think it might be her first time." [...] Continuing with this theme, Smith also spoke with Kristin Dos Santos for E! about her character's lack of definitive romantic history, jesting; [...] "I'll look at the script next week and be like [...] "Oh my God, I've been a lesbian for years and I didn't know." [...] She also discussed the meetings with GLAAD she and Ramirez attended, and their impact on her portrayal of the storyline, explaining: [...] "It was actually very helpful because they did talk about their own personal lives, and how, I guess if you're an open person, and life is change, then <b>anything</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen.</b> And it could really rock your world I imagine, if you all of a sudden thought that you might be in love with a woman and maybe you weren't before." ...|$|E

[...] Herman Perry, Whittier Bank of America branch manager and Nixon family friend, wrote to Nixon, who was then a lieutenant commander in the Navy, telling him he should apply for the Committee's endorsement.

500|$|... "It's Not Up to You" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as a [...] "dizzying ballad" [...] and a song that lifts the album upward.

Its lyrics are about [...] "love for the unknown devices that culminate in 'perfect days'", and [...] "pleas to find beauty in unlikely places". The [...] "caressing lyrics" [...] of [...] "Undo" [...] assure that: [...] "It's not meant to be a strife/It's not meant to be a struggle uphill". Biographer Mark Pytlik writes, [...] "Undo" [...] is a held hand, a reassuring reminder that <b>anything</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> once you let it. If you are in pain, undo it, Björk suggests, no hint of disingenuousness in her voice, over climbing strings and a rising choir". [...] "Pagan Poetry" [...] is a [...] "harp-splashed" [...] song that concerns unrequited love. The track builds slowly, [...] "with Björk wailing over swelling keyboard crescendos," [...] until, at the four-minute mark, [...] "all the music drops away, leaving Björk utterly exposed" [...] as she sings [...] "I love him, I love him/I love him, I love him/I love him, I love him". The song also features [...] "a flotilla of music boxes with an Asian-teahouse touch." [...] The instrumental interlude [...] "Frosti" [...] {{has been described}} as a [...] "metallic tundra". Its sound stems from a music box, creating an intimate, fairy tale-like effect.|$|E

And she thought: 'London--all those big towns, their smoke, the things they make, the things we want them to make, that we shall always want them to make. Aren't they there?

2500|$|... "The marvelous" [...] may {{be easily}} {{confused}} with magical realism, as both modes introduce supernatural events without surprising the implied author. In both, these magical events are expected and accepted as everyday occurrences. However, the marvelous {{world is a}} unidimensional world. The implied author believes that <b>anything</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> here, as the entire world is filled with supernatural beings and situations to begin with. Fairy tales are {{a good example of}} marvelous literature. The important idea in defining the marvelous is that readers understand that this fictional world is different from the world where they live. The [...] "marvelous" [...] one-dimensional world differs from the bidimensional world of magical realism, as in the latter, the supernatural realm blends with the natural, familiar world (arriving at the combination of two layers of reality: bidimensional).

Interestingly, our work has shown that this level of detail is relatively unimportant in mission-critical domains. When certain types of events and conditions are considered catastrophic (and hence wholly unacceptable), degrees of uncertainty become a moot point: Murphy's Law must be observed and planned for.

5000|$|While many {{justifications}} for alternate histories involve a multiverse, the [...] "many world" [...] theory would naturally involve many worlds, {{in fact a}} continually exploding array of universes. In quantum theory, new worlds would proliferate with every quantum event, {{and even if the}} writer uses human decisions, every decision that could be made differently would result in a different timeline. A writer's fictional multiverse may, in fact, preclude some decisions as humanly impossible, as when, in Night Watch, Terry Pratchett depicts a character informing Vimes that while <b>anything</b> that <b>can</b> <b>happen,</b> has happened, nevertheless there is no history whatsoever in which Vimes has ever murdered his wife. When the writer explicitly maintains that all possible decisions are made in all possible ways, one possible conclusion is that the characters were neither brave, nor clever, nor skilled, but simply lucky enough to happen on the universe in which they did not choose the cowardly route, take the stupid action, fumble the crucial activity, etc.; few writers focus on this idea, although it has been explored in stories such as Larry Niven's story All the Myriad Ways, where the reality of all possible universes leads to an epidemic of suicide and crime because people conclude their choices have no moral import.|$|R
