5|$|About 30% of {{undergraduate}} men and about 40% {{of undergraduate}} women <b>at</b> <b>Duke</b> {{are members of}} fraternities and sororities. Most of the 17 Interfraternity Council recognized fraternity chapters live in sections within the residence halls. Starting in 2012, the nine Panhellenic Association sorority chapters decided to live in houses (clusters of apartments) on Central Campus. Not all sorority members live with their chapters, though, as membership exceeds house space. Eight National Pan-Hellenic Council (historically African American) fraternities and sororities also hold chapters <b>at</b> <b>Duke.</b> In addition, there are seven other fraternities and sororities that {{are a part of}} the Inter-Greek Council, the multicultural Greek umbrella organization. Duke also has Selective Living Groups, or SLGs, on campus for students seeking informal residential communities often built around themes. SLGs are residential groups similar to fraternities or sororities, except they are generally co-ed and unaffiliated with any national organizations. Fraternity chapters and SLGs frequently host social events in their residential sections, which are often open to non-members.|$|E

Sabina appeared friendly and stroked the dog as the three people struck up a conversation. Although friendly, Sabina appeared to be behaving oddly and this odd behaviour worried Molloy. Sabina asked the two men for directions to any nearby bed and breakfasts or hotels. Hollinshead took pity upon her and instead offered to take her back to his house <b>at</b> <b>Duke</b> Street, Fenton.

5|$|Campbell {{attended}} the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), {{where he was}} befriended by the eminent mathematician Norbert Wiener (who coined the term cybernetics).
