At the end of the month, Julia was nevertheless warmly received by Grant's family in Bethel, Ohio. They had four children: Frederick, Ulysses Jr. ("Buck"), Ellen ("Nellie"), <b>and</b> <b>Jesse.</b> After the wedding, Grant obtained a two-month extension to his leave and returned to St. Louis when he decided, with a wife to support, that he would remain in the army.|$|E

Breckinridge's friends, W. W. Corcoran <b>and</b> <b>Jesse</b> D. Bright, were two of Texas's major creditors. The bill, which was approved, paid only those debts related to powers Texas surrendered to Congress upon annexation. Breckinridge was disappointed that the House defeated a measure to pay the Sioux $12,000 owed them for the 1839 purchase of {{an island in the}} Mississippi River; the debt was never paid. Another increase in the subsidy to the Collins Line passed over his opposition, but Pierce vetoed it.|$|E

5|$|Kenyatta had {{continued}} writing articles, {{in which he}} reflected Padmore's influence.

He also wrote the entry on Kenya for Negro, an anthology edited by Nancy Cunard and published in 1934. In these, he took a more extreme position than {{he had in the}} past, calling for complete self-rule in Kenya. In doing so he was virtually alone among political Kenyans, with figures like Thuku <b>and</b> <b>Jesse</b> Kariuki being far less radical in their demands. The pro-independence sentiments {{that he was able to}} express in Britain would not have been permitted in Kenya itself.|$|E

Jesse doubts this, believing {{it will be too}} much trouble for Gus to find another drug manufacturer, and that both they and Gus understand the situation: neither can kill the other, so Gus might as well make them wish they were dead. The episode ends with police investigating Gale's apartment with the camera focusing on his lab notes which have yet to be discovered.|$|E
