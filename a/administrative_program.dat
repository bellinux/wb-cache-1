40|$|This study {{examines}} participation in Unemployment Insurance (UI) and Employment Services (ES) by adults who received cash welfare benefits through Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF).

We also investigate the correlations between UI and ES services receipt with reemployment and future independence from TANF. The analysis is based on person-level <b>administrative</b> <b>program</b> records from four of the nine most populated states between 1997 and 2003. Evidence suggests that three-quarters of new TANF leavers experience unemployment within three years, and one-quarter of the newly unemployed apply for UI benefits. About 87 percent of UI applicants have sufficient prior earnings to qualify for benefits. However, only about 44 percent qualify based on their job separation reasons. Among UI applicants, TANF leavers had much higher rates of voluntary quits and employer dismissals tha...|$|E

40|$|Compensation&mdash;are {{compared}} {{with respect to}} client evaluations of services received. To structure this comparison, an independent variable of <b>administrative</b> <b>program</b> is derived from three components, namely, climate, technology, and clientele. Data on client evaluation are obtained from exit interviews of clients as they leave welfare offices. A hypothesized order of client satisfaction among the three programs is supported empirically in large measure. It is proposed that the field of comparative administration concern itself more with such comparisons instead of concentrating on cross-national comparisons. This article is predicated {{on the notion that}} comparative administration is not dead. In fact, we have barely begun to tap its possibilities. This {{is not to say that}} the old CAG-style comparative administration did not have its problems. These included preoccupation with abstract models, concentration on the national political and cultural system as the independent variable, and limited use of systematic field data. What follows is a description of a comparative exercise that attempts to surmount each of these difficulties. First, the study does not relate theoretically to a grand or comprehensive model such as Riggs’s Prismatic or Weber’...|$|E

40|$|The high {{incidence}} of temporary agency employment among participants in government employment programs has catalyzed debate about whether these jobs help the poor transition into stable employment and out of poverty. We provide direct evidence on this question through analysis of a Michigan welfare-to-work program in which program participants were randomly allocated across service providers ('contractors') with different job placement practices. We draw on a telephone survey of contractors and on <b>administrative</b> <b>program</b> data linked with wage records data on all participants entering the program over a three-and-a half-year period. Our survey evidence documents a consensus among contractors that temporary help jobs are generally easier for those with weak skills and experience to obtain, but no consensus on whether temporary help jobs confer long-term benefits to participants. Our analysis of the quasi-experimental data introduced in Autor and Houseman (2005) shows that placing participants in either temporary or direct-hire jobs improves their odds of leaving welfare and escaping poverty in the short term. However, we find that only direct-hire placements help reduce welfare dependency over longer time horizons. Our fmdings {{raise questions about the}} incentive structure of many government employment programs that emphasize rapid placement of progra...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Despite its {{extensive}} use, {{the term}} ¨Surveillance ¨ often takes on various meanings in the scien-tific literature pertinent {{to public health}} and animal health. A critical appraisal of this literature also reveals ambiguities relating to the scope and necessary structural components underpinning the surveillance process. The authors hypothesized that these inconsistencies translate to real or perceived deficiencies in the conceptu-al framework of population health surveillance. This paper presents a population health surveillance theory framed upon an explicit conceptual system relative to health surveillance performed in human and animal populations. METHODS: The population health surveillance theory reflects the authors ’ system of thinking and {{was based on a}} creative process. RESULTS: Population health surveillance includes two broad components: one relating to the human organi-zation (which includes expertise and the <b>administrative</b> <b>program),</b> and one relating to the system per se (which includes elements of design and method) and which {{can be viewed as a}} process. The population health surveil-lance process is made of five sequential interrelated steps: 1) a trigger or need, 2) problem formulation, 3) sur-veillance planning, 4) surveillance implementation, and 5) information communication and audit. CONCLUSIONS: The population health surveillance theory provides a systematic way of understanding, or-ganizing and evaluating the population health surveillance process...|$|E
40|$|The {{streamlined}} <b>administrative</b> <b>program</b> that BP {{set up to}} pay claims {{arising out}} of the Deepwater Horizon Oil spill—the Gulf Coast Claims Facility (GCCF) —promised a significant transaction-cost savings over litigation in the public court system. At least in theory, that savings should have worked {{to the benefit of}} BP and claimants alike, freeing up money that would otherwise have gone to lawyers and other litigation costs to fund claimants’ recoveries. But a comparison of the GCCF to the class action settlement that replaced it reveals that the class settlement will result in greater payments to claimants. Paradoxically, the dispute resolution system with the higher built-in transaction costs appears superior. We offer some hypotheses for why this might be the case. Our central claim is that claimants did better under the higher-cost class action settlement because it allowed them to offer the defendant something it valued—a greater degree of finality than the GCCF could ever provide—in exchange for a “peace premium. ” And we analyze some of the features of the public system of class action litigation that enable parties to obtain a greater degree of closure than a purely private dispute resolution system like the GCCF, {{while at the same time}} providing guarantees of transparency, consistency, and equitable treatment of absentees...|$|E
