5|$|On 31 October 2015, McCaw captained New Zealand {{to retain}} the Rugby World Cup after a 34-17 win against Australia in the final at Twickenham. The <b>achievement</b> <b>was</b> marred {{somewhat}} by him receiving a yellow card for foottripping in the opening game against Argentina.

5|$|Architect Carl Frederik Stanley (1769–1805), {{educated in}} Copenhagen, spent some years in Norway {{around the turn}} of the 19th century. He did minor works for wealthy patrons in and around Oslo, but his major <b>achievement</b> <b>was</b> the {{renovation}} of the only seat of higher education in Christiania, the Oslo Katedralskole, completed in 1800. He added a classical portico to the front of an older structure, and a semi-circular auditorium that was sequestered by Parliament in 1814 as a temporary place to assemble, now preserved at Norsk Folkemuseum as a national monument.|$|E

5|$|Beauregard {{commanded}} armies in the Western Theater, {{including at}} the Battle of Shiloh in Tennessee, and the Siege of Corinth in northern Mississippi. He returned to Charleston and defended it in 1863 from repeated naval and land attacks by Union forces.

5|$|Hayes {{kept his}} {{pledge not to}} run for re-election, retired {{to his home in}} Ohio, and became an {{advocate}} of social and educational reform. Biographer Ari Hoogenboom said his greatest <b>achievement</b> <b>was</b> to restore popular faith in the presidency and to reverse the deterioration of executive power that had set in after Abraham Lincoln's death. Although supporters have praised his commitment to civil service reform and defense of civil rights, Hayes is generally listed among the high-end of the bottom half in historians' rankings of U.S. presidents.|$|E
5|$|He {{participated in}} many of the major {{conflicts}} of the 18th century, including the War of the Polish Succession, the War of the Austrian Succession, the Seven Years' War and the Anglo-Spanish War.

He ended his career {{in the service of the}} Spanish Bourbon monarchy, which had been allied with France prior to the French Revolution, and died in Madrid.|$|E

5|$|In the House of Representatives, Voorhis was a loyal {{supporter}} of the New Deal and compiled a liberal voting record. His major legislative <b>achievement</b> <b>was</b> the Voorhis Act of 1940 requiring registration of certain organizations controlled by foreign powers. After being re-elected by comfortable margins four times, he faced Nixon in 1946 in a bitter campaign in which Voorhis' supposed endorsement by groups linked to the Communist Party {{was made into a}} major issue. Nixon won the Republican-leaning district by over 15,000 votes and Voorhis refused to run against Nixon in 1948.|$|E
5|$|It took until 1994 for the Queen {{to approve}} the new design for general use, though the Canadian Heraldic Authority began to allow for its limited use {{beginning}} in 1987, where the arms were used to represent the Queen personally on letters patent granting new arms for distinguished Canadians. These letters patent carried the shield from the royal arms along with the annulus behind the shield bearing the motto of the Order of Canada—Desiderantes meliorem patriam. As soon as royal approval was forthcoming, the full <b>achievement</b> <b>was</b> redesigned {{for use by the}} federal government within the Federal Identity Program.

5|$|Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music {{became one}} of the best-selling albums {{recorded}} by a black musician of the time, as well as one of the best-selling country albums, shipping at least 500,000 copies in its first three months of release.

The album proved to be a crossover hit as well, as distributors claimed the record had been selling in pop, R and country music markets; at the time, often referred to as white and black markets during the period.|$|E

5|$|Stoke {{began to}} compete for honours in the 1970–71 season, though despite {{impressive}} victories against the top two clubs – Arsenal and Leeds United – City ended the season in mid-table obscurity. The club's great <b>achievement</b> <b>was</b> in reaching the semi-finals of the FA Cup, beating Millwall, Huddersfield Town, Ipswich Town and Hull City en route. Facing Arsenal at Hillsborough in the semi-finals, they lost a two-goal lead to draw 2–2, and were then beaten 2–0 in the replay at Villa Park.|$|E
5|$|The {{author of}} the Rule of Saint Benedict, which was the {{principal}} monastic code in Western Europe in the early Middle Ages, was Saint Benedict of Nursia (c. 480–550). Under this rule {{the lives of the}} monks were mainly devoted to prayer, together with reading sacred texts and manual work. They lived a communal life and were required to give complete obedience to their abbot. Benedict's <b>achievement</b> <b>was</b> to produce a stable system characterised by moderation and prudence.|$|E

This <b>achievement</b> <b>was</b> further followed by an artificial insemination (AI) assisted birth of an Indian blackbuck fawn in August 2007. These were the first reports in the world of such successful AI of wild animals.|$|E
50|$|Anno 1404 and its add-on Venice add the {{possibility}} of rewarding achievements to the player. Those <b>achievements</b> can <b>be</b> seen as 'milestones' and vary from quite easy to extremely hard, since {{a lot of them}} <b>are</b> 'hidden'. The <b>achievements</b> <b>are</b> divided in 5 categories: diplomacy, setup, economic, military and general. Quite a few of the <b>achievements</b> <b>are</b> interlinked, being part of another 'bigger' achievement. In the base game there <b>were</b> 206 <b>achievements</b> to <b>be</b> had, the Venice expansion added another 110 of them, totalling 316.However, as of patch 2.1/1.3 not all <b>achievements</b> <b>are</b> reachable, as syntax errors in the games' xml files are still present. Trying to correct these game files will result in the achievement not being awarded as the game recognises this as modification. This has been addressed by an unofficial user-made patch, about which see below.|$|R
40|$|This article {{gives an}} account of what makes {{achievements}} valuable. Although the natural thought <b>is</b> that <b>achievements</b> <b>are</b> valuable because of the product, such as a cure for cancer or a work of art, I argue {{that the value of}} the product of an <b>achievement</b> <b>is</b> not sufficient to account for its overall value. Rather, I argue that <b>achievements</b> <b>are</b> valuable in virtue of their difficulty. I propose a new perfectionist theory of value that acknowledges the will as a characteristic human capacity, and thus holds that the exercise of the will, and therefore difficulty, is intrinsically valuable...|$|R

5|$|While the {{movement}} had its greatest {{level of success}} in Sweden, {{there were a number}} of other important Danish proponents including Ivar Bentsen, Kaare Klint, Arne Jacobsen, Carl Petersen and Steen Eiler Rasmussen. Bentsen, with the assistance of Thorkild Henningsen, designed Denmark's first terraced houses in the Bellahøj district of Copenhagen. Very appropriately Klint, working with Bentsen, adapted the design of Frederiks Hospital to serve as the Danish Museum of Art & Design. Carl Petersen's main <b>achievement</b> <b>was</b> the Faaborg Museum built for collections of art from Funen. Steen Rasmussen is remembered above all for his town planning activities and for his contributions to the Dansk Byplanlaboratorium (Danish town planning laboratory).|$|E
5|$|With {{two games}} remaining, Yorke scored his 29th {{goal of the}} season at Middlesbrough to help his team return {{to the top of}} the table. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink's late winner against Arsenal two days later all but ended Wenger’s chances of {{retaining}} the league championship. United now needed only four points, one of them gained at Ewood Park, relegating Blackburn Rovers in the process. Manchester United eventually secured the championship on the final day, coming back from a goal down against Tottenham to win 2–1. The <b>achievement</b> <b>was</b> all the more special for Ferguson, who lifted his fifth domestic championship in seven seasons.|$|E
5|$|Yet arguably his {{greatest}} diplomatic <b>achievement</b> <b>was</b> negotiating with Phraates IV of Parthia (37–2BC) in 20BC {{for the return}} of the battle standards lost by Crassus in the Battle of Carrhae, a symbolic victory and great boost of morale for Rome. Werner Eck claims that this was a great disappointment for Romans seeking to avenge Crassus' defeat by military means. However, Maria Brosius explains that Augustus used the return of the standards as propaganda symbolizing the submission of Parthia to Rome. The event was celebrated in art such as the breastplate design on the statue Augustus of Prima Porta and in monuments such as the Temple of Mars Ultor ('Mars the Avenger') built to house the standards.|$|E
