5|$|Big G {{would have}} made {{landings}} on land, using a parasail or paraglider to guide it onto <b>a</b> <b>runway</b> or dry lake, {{such as the one}} at Edwards Air Force Base. It would have landed using skids derived from the North American X-15.|$|E
5|$|A female human {{trafficking}} victim is interviewed {{with her face}} hidden. She describes how she and other {{human trafficking}} victims in Eastern Europe were held in buildings with security cameras, where {{they were forced to}} walk naked down <b>a</b> <b>runway</b> before a group of men who watched under the guise of attending a fashion show. She then describes being auctioned off to the audience members, who she says examined her off the runway as one might examine cattle.|$|E
5|$|As the new {{residential}} area suffered from aircraft noise, residents {{joined in the}} demand that the airport be relocated. Despite this, the number of flights to the airport increased as the newly formed Israel Airports Authority strived to reduce congestion at Ben Gurion Airport by shifting all domestic turbo-prop flights to Sde Dov. Once again, the only feasible alternative proposed at this point was to build <b>a</b> <b>runway</b> in the sea and again, {{the high cost of}} this project meant that it never happened. This was a large issue in the area during the whole of the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|The {{airport was}} {{upgraded}} from <b>a</b> grass <b>runway</b> in the 1980s when <b>a</b> tarmac <b>runway</b> was laid.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "runway condition" [...] is <b>a</b> <b>runway's</b> {{current status}} in {{relation}} to current meteorological conditions and air safety.|$|R
50|$|Frederick Municipal Airport has <b>a</b> mile-long <b>runway</b> and <b>a</b> second 3600' <b>runway.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1917, the 6th Aero Squadron {{was created}} in Honolulu, with Captain John F. Currey as its commander. Although 50 were assigned, only 49 arrived; one deserted en route. Currey chose Ford Island as the {{location}} for the new squadron and bought it from the John Papa ʻĪʻī land trust for $236,000, citing its access to water and winds as assets. When Currey was transferred to Washington, command of the squadron was given to Captain John B. Brooks and then Major Hugh J. Knerr, who built hangars and <b>a</b> <b>runway.</b> Early soldiers had to level the island, removing hills and boulders.|$|E
5|$|Snow can be {{compacted}} {{to form a}} snow {{road and}} be part of a winter road route for vehicles to access isolated communities or construction projects during the winter. Snow {{can also be used to}} provide the supporting structure and surface for <b>a</b> <b>runway,</b> as with the Phoenix Airfield in Antarctica. The snow-compacted runway is designed to withstand approximately 60 wheeled flights of heavy-lift military aircraft a year.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{permanent}} population, {{although there are}} 12 active research stations housing a maximum average of 40 scientists, the numbers fluctuating depending on the season. Six are occupied year-round, while the remainder are seasonal summer stations. The main aerodromes for intercontinental flights, corresponding with Cape Town, South Africa, are Troll Airfield, near the Norwegian Troll research station, and <b>a</b> <b>runway</b> at the Russian Novolazarevskaya Station.|$|E
25|$|Reid–Hillview was <b>a</b> single <b>runway</b> airport until 1965, when <b>a</b> second <b>runway</b> was added. The {{control tower}} opened in October 1967.|$|R
50|$|Runway {{safety is}} {{concerned}} with reducing harm that could occur on <b>an</b> aircraft <b>runway.</b> Safety means avoiding incorrect presence (incursion) of aircraft, inappropriate exits (excursion) {{and use of the}} wrong runway due to confusion. The <b>runway</b> condition is <b>a</b> <b>runway's</b> current status due to meteorological conditions and air safety.|$|R
5000|$|London Gatwick - Battling with Heathrow for Government {{decision}} on <b>an</b> extra <b>runway.</b> <b>A</b> second <b>runway</b> at Gatwick {{could see it}} match or even overtake Heathrow's traffic and income. Supporters say multiple large London airports is better than one massive one.|$|R
5|$|Also in March 1941, 91 Squadron moved in, {{equipped}} with Spitfires. Additional dispersals and fighter pens {{as well as}} three new blister hangars were built during 1941. Typhoons were based at Lympne from March 1942 to February 1944 {{to counter the threat}} posed by the Luftwaffe's newly introduced Focke-Wulf Fw 190s and <b>a</b> <b>runway</b> was extended across Otterpool Lane to accommodate the Typhoons. In November 1944, Lympne was downgraded to Emergency Landing Ground status. Consideration was given to building four runways at Lympne, with the longest being , but it was noted that serious demolition work would be required and a number of roads would need to be closed.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{activities}} {{were taken in}} hand by the US Navy Seabees of the 18th Construction Regiment, which consisted of the 27th, 61st and 63rd Construction Battalions and the 17th Special Battalion, which arrived between 25 and 30 March, and the 77th Construction Battalion which arrived on 14 April. The 27th built a PT boat base, an LCT floating drydock and slipway, and roads. The 61st constructed housing, ammunition storage facilities, <b>a</b> <b>runway,</b> {{and some of the}} buildings at the PT boat base. It also handled sawmill operations. The 63rd assisted at the sawmill and worked on the roads, camps, harbor facilities, warehouses, magazines and avgas dumps. The 77th built taxiways, hardstands, aviation workshops and the avgas tank farm. The 88th worked on runways, roads, radar stations and a causeway at the eastern end of the island.|$|E
5|$|During the {{production}} run, the Navy {{decided to move}} the Chance Vought factory from Stratford, Connecticut to a much larger facility in Dallas, Texas which had been vacant {{since the end of}} World War II; this badly disrupted {{the production}} of the Pirate. The airframes were built in Stratford and trucked to Dallas where government-furnished equipment, such as the engines and afterburners, were installed. The completed aircraft were then taxied around the new plant's airfield, but the runway was deemed too short to handle jets. The aircraft had to be disassembled and trucked to an abandoned airfield at Ardmore, Oklahoma with <b>a</b> <b>runway</b> long enough for acceptance testing.|$|E
50|$|The airport has <b>a</b> single <b>runway,</b> runway 18/36. Previously, {{the airport}} had <b>an</b> {{additional}} <b>runway,</b> runway 15/33. This runway is currently closed and unusable.|$|R
50|$|Tiger Field on US 95A {{about three}} miles from Fernley, with <b>a</b> gravel <b>runway</b> of 2,750 feet and <b>a</b> paved <b>runway</b> of 5,600 feet.|$|R
25|$|In May 2010 BAA withdrew {{its plans}} to build <b>a</b> second <b>runway</b> at Stansted and withdrew the plans to build <b>a</b> new <b>runway</b> at Heathrow.|$|R
5|$|In León {{near where}} it moved ashore in Nicaragua, {{the passage of}} Alma left the city without power. Several {{buildings}} were destroyed in the city, and some roads were damaged. Much of the departments of León and Chinandega experienced power outages, due to the strong winds. One person died from electrocution, due to a downed high-tension cable, and another person died in a similar manner. Offshore, one person drowned when he rode out the storm in his boat. In Tegucigalpa, TACA Flight 390 skidded off <b>a</b> <b>runway</b> sodden by torrential rain, killing three passengers (plus two more on the ground) and injuring over eighty. One other fatality was reported in Honduras when a young girl was swept away in a raging stream.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB {{concluded}} that the crash occurred due to the TWA flight crew's inability to successfully abort takeoff due to {{the speed of the}} aircraft, and that <b>a</b> <b>runway</b> overrun was unavoidable at the 707's speed. The disabled DC-9, a Delta Air Lines flight which had reported that it had cleared the runway when in fact it had not, was a contributing factor in the crash. The NTSB recommended that the FAA establish and publicize standards of safe clearance from runway edges for both aircraft and ground vehicles which also take into account the exhaust fumes of jet engines. The board also recommended a reevaluation of training manuals and aircraft procedures in regard to abort procedures.|$|E
5|$|The {{line was}} {{influenced}} {{by a variety of}} cultures fashions, including Guatemalan, Japanese, Indian and Jamaican styles. Stefani came from a family of seamstresses. This further inspired her to launch her own fashion line. The line achieved popularity among celebrities and was worn by stars such as Teri Hatcher, Nicole Kidman, Paris Hilton and Stefani herself. The fashion line made <b>a</b> <b>runway</b> debut in the spring collection of 2004 and achieved mainstream success at New York Fashion Week in 2005. At one point its annual gross income was $90 million. The line, as well as the shows at which it was displayed, were well received by critics and appreciated the indulgence of a celebrity into the fashion world. An additional fashion line, called Harajuku Lovers, was subsequently launched by Stefani.|$|E
50|$|The airport {{will have}} <b>a</b> 3,400-meter <b>runway,</b> <b>a</b> 3,000 square-meter {{terminal}} building, and four aircraft parking places.|$|R
50|$|The airport has <b>a</b> {{concrete}} <b>runway</b> 10R/28L, measuring 1300 m x 90 m, and, {{parallel to}} it, <b>a</b> grass <b>runway</b> 10L/28R, measuring 1000 m x 150 m.|$|R
50|$|The airfield, created {{especially}} for heavy bombers, comprised two intersecting bitumen <b>runways,</b> <b>a</b> north-south (165°) <b>runway</b> 5000 x 150 ft and <b>an</b> east-west (107°) <b>runway</b> 7000 x 150 ft.|$|R
5|$|When {{facilities}} {{reached their}} maximum capacity, {{the need for}} upgrades became necessary for the airport to continue to grow. A proposal for runway expansion as well as facilities upgrades was developed in 1975, but was subsequently put on hold while a new regional airport was being studied to serve both Roanoke and all of Southwest Virginia. During this time airline deregulation was put in place, and combined with the airport's aging facilities and the phasing out of turbo prop aircraft in favor of jet aircraft by the airlines, the airport's outdated infrastructure and deteriorating condition resulted in a decline {{of service to the}} airport. In order to allow for larger, jet aircraft to land, <b>a</b> <b>runway</b> expansion began in the early 1980s. With the runway extension underway, the airport officially changed its name from Roanoke Municipal Airport to Roanoke Regional Airport in 1983. The runway expansion project was completed in 1985.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} it was re-formed as No.1 AFTS, the flying school at Point Cook had also been made {{responsible}} for training the RAAF's air traffic controllers; this role was transferred to Central Flying School at East Sale in December 1956. Southern Area Command was re-formed as Training Command in September 1953. On 28May 1958, No.1 AFTS relocated to RAAF Base Pearce, Western Australia, where its Wirraways were replaced by deHavilland Vampire jet trainers, which required <b>a</b> <b>runway</b> longer than that at Point Cook. The school's place at Point Cook was taken by No.1 BFTS, which transferred from Uranquinty on 19December. By this time the RAAF had decided to commission all pilots and navigators, who would be selected for these roles upon induction into the service; navigators therefore went straight to the School of Air Navigation at East Sale, without attending flying training school. On 31December 1958, the Flying Training Squadron of RAAF College was disbanded, and the flight instruction component of the four-year cadet course became the responsibility of No.1 BFTS (for basic training) and No.1 AFTS (for advanced training). Previously, the cadets had used FTS aircraft under RAAF College instructors, but from 1959 their flight training was fully integrated with the FTS system.|$|E
5|$|The Dream Within a Dream Tour was {{the fourth}} concert tour by American {{recording}} artist Britney Spears. It was launched in support of her third studio album, Britney (2001). The tour was promoted by Concerts West, marking the first time Spears did not tour with Clear Channel Entertainment. On September 21, 2001, a North American tour was announced that kicked off exactly two months later after various dates were postponed. In February 2002, Spears announced a second leg of the tour. It was directed and choreographed by Wade Robson, who explained the main theme of the show was Spears's coming of age and newfound independence. The stage was designed by Steve Cohen and Rob Brenner and was composed of a main stage and a B-stage, united by <b>a</b> <b>runway.</b> Inspired by Cleopatra's barge, a flying device was developed so Spears could travel over the audience to the B-stage. The setlist was mostly composed by songs from the supporting album, as Spears felt they were more reflective of her personality. Songs from her previous two studio albums were also included in remixed form by Robson.|$|E
50|$|It is {{equipped}} with hangars, <b>an</b> asphalt <b>runway</b> 1,200 metres in length, a campsite and seven bungalows. It also has <b>a</b> dirt <b>runway</b> suitable for model aircraft and ultralights.|$|R
25|$|The {{commission}} {{released its}} interim report in December 2013, shortlisting three options: the north-west third runway option at Heathrow, extending <b>an</b> existing <b>runway</b> at Heathrow, and <b>a</b> second <b>runway</b> at Gatwick Airport. After this report was published, the government confirmed that no options had been ruled out for airport {{expansion in the}} South-east and that <b>a</b> new <b>runway</b> would not be built at Heathrow before 2015. The full report was published on 1 July 2015, and backed <b>a</b> third, north-west, <b>runway</b> at Heathrow.|$|R
5000|$|The city of Gastonia {{owns and}} {{operates}} Gastonia Municipal Airport, which is a general aviation airport with <b>a</b> single <b>runway,</b> <b>Runway</b> 3/21, <b>an</b> asphalt <b>runway</b> that is 3,779 feet in length ...|$|R
5|$|The Skylon is a fully {{reusable}} {{single stage}} to orbit (SSTO) vehicle, {{able to achieve}} orbit without staging, which {{is intended to be}} used principally as a reusable launch system. Proponents of the SSTO approach have often claimed that staging involves a number of inherent complications and problems due to complexity, such as being difficult or typically impossible to recover and reuse most elements, thus unavoidably incurring great expense to produce entirely new launch vehicles instead; therefore, they believe that SSTO designs hold the promise of providing a reduction to the high cost of space flights. Operationally, it is envisioned for the non-crewed Skylon to take off from a specially strengthened runway, gain altitude in a fashion akin to a conventional aeroplane and perform an ascent at very high speeds, in excess of five times the speed of sound (3,800 miles per hour), to attain a peak altitude of roughly 92,000 feet, on the edge of low earth orbit (LEO), where payloads would typically be launched prior to the vehicle's re-entry into the atmosphere, upon which it will conduct a relatively gentle descent before performing a traditional landing upon <b>a</b> <b>runway.</b>|$|E
5|$|The player {{may choose}} to begin flight on <b>a</b> <b>runway</b> or taxiway, or in the air. Aircraft are {{controlled}} via keyboard, joystick, head-mounted display or specialized input devices such as pedals. During flight, several third- and first-person camera angles may be selected. For example, the third-person Flyby View places the camera {{in front of the}} plane as it flies past, while the first-person Three-Way View displays more information about the plane's position and speed than other angles. Certain camera angles, including the Three-Way View and 3-D Cockpit view, provide the player with simulated flight instruments such as an altimeter, airspeed indicator, accelerometer, variometer and tachometer. The game is designed to allow players to perform aerobatic maneuvers such as the Immelmann turn, tailslide, Lomcevak and Cuban Eight. Performances may be recorded and played back, with controls that allow the player to pause, rewind and fast forward. At any time, the player may stop a recording and resume flight from that point.|$|E
5|$|Sabah uses a dual {{carriageway}} with the left-hand traffic rule. All major towns in Sabah also provide public transportation {{services such as}} buses, taxis and vans. The BRT Kota Kinabalu is currently under construction to provide bus rapid transit (BRT) system in Sabah's capital. A rail transport through the Western Line operated by the Sabah State Railway provides daily services for commuters, travellers, {{as well as for}} cargo transportation. A separate company owned by Sutera Harbour known as the North Borneo Railway operates leisure tour for tourists. The train station and terminal is located in Tanjung Aru, not far from the city airport. Other main stations including in Papar, Beaufort and Tenom. The current Aeropod projects on the main station in Tanjung Aru will modernise the station and provide a provision for future light rail transit (LRT). In early 2016, the state government has purchased a new diesel multiple unit (DMU) for about RM8 million to replace the old train used between Beaufort and Tenom while the rail line from Halogilat and Tenom will be upgrading by the federal government at the cost of RM99.5 million along with the arrival of another three DMUs that will be received in early 2018. Kota Kinabalu International Airport is the main gateway to Sabah. In 2005, the Malaysian federal government approved major renovation and refurbishment works to the main terminal (Terminal 1) as well as <b>a</b> <b>runway</b> expansion. As a result of this expansion, the airport is now able to accommodate the world's largest passenger aircraft, the Airbus A380. It has also become the second largest airport in Malaysia. Other smaller airports in Sabah including Kudat Airport, Lahad Datu Airport, Sandakan Airport and Tawau Airport. Layang-Layang Airport in Swallow Reef served as a military and civilian airport. Three airlines serving flight routes in Sabah: Malaysia Airlines, AirAsia, and Malindo Air. Sabah Air is a helicopter chartered flight company owned by the Sabah state government, serving flights for aerial sightseeing to interested customers as well for the transportation of state government servants.|$|E
