5|$|During {{the period}} that the {{original}} proposals were being studied, advances in supersonic flight were proceeding rapidly. The narrow delta was establishing itself as a preferred planform for supersonic flight, replacing earlier designs like the swept-wing and trapezoidal layouts seen on designs like the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter and the earlier WS-110 concepts. Engines <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> with higher temperatures and widely varying intake ramp air speeds were also under design, allowing for sustained supersonic speeds.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} climate change on teleosts could be {{powerful}} but are complex. For example, increased winter precipitation (rain and snow) could harm populations of freshwater fish in Norway, whereas warmer summers could increase growth of adult fish. In the oceans, teleosts may be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> with warming, as it is simply an extension of natural variation in climate. It is uncertain how ocean acidification, caused by rising carbon dioxide levels, might affect teleosts.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, it was {{anticipated}} that traffic {{through the tunnel}} would rise on {{the completion of the}} M25 in 1986. At the time, the expectation was that other routes in London would be improved instead, diverting 15% of traffic away from the tunnel. In 1985, the Transport Minister, Lynda Chalker, announced that the number of toll booths would be increased to 12 each way, but concern grew that two tunnels would not be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> with the full demands of a completed M25.|$|E

5|$|Incubation takes 56days, and {{the male}} stops {{incubating}} the eggs shortly before they hatch. The temperature of the nest rises slightly during the eight-week period. Although the eggs are laid sequentially, they tend to hatch within two days of one another, as the eggs that were laid later experienced higher temperatures and developed more rapidly. During the process, the precocial emu chicks {{need to develop a}} capacity for thermoregulation. During incubation, the embryos are kept at a constant temperature but the chicks will need to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> with varying external temperatures by the time they hatch.|$|E
5|$|Lukić {{notes that}} the {{mortality}} rate among the children at Jastrebarsko was much {{lower than that of}} children at Stara Gradiška and Sisak for two reasons. Firstly, that almost half the children at Jastrebarsko were older children more <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> with the harsh conditions. More importantly, that from the end of July, twenty-six volunteer nurses from the teachers' school at Rude near Samobor, along with several doctors and other medical personnel, under the leadership of Marinić, began to intervene with the camp administration and Ustaše guards to improve the health of the children. The Ustaše propaganda soon took advantage of the improved condition of the children.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being one}} of the few major {{thoroughfares}} in Rome <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> with a high volume of traffic without congestion, it is the subject of much ire both within the Roman community and among historical scholars due to the circumstances under which it was constructed. The area around the church was rebuilt several times following the various Sacks of Rome, and again after having deteriorated due to the loss of prosperity resulting from the Papacy's relocation to Avignon during the 14th century. Through all of these reconstructions, the area in front of the short courtyard of Saint Peter's Basilica remained a maze of densely packed structures overhanging narrow side-streets and alleyways.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Smart-appliances {{ensembles}} {{are highly}} dynamic device col-lections in which devices can leave and join {{at any time}} without no-tice. Due to the high system dynamics, such ensembles cannot employ standard evolutionary algorithms for their internal self-organization pro-cesses. Therefore, this paper proposes a new evolutionary framework, called the appliances-go-evolution platform (AGE-P). The simulation experiments indicate that AGE-P is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> properly <b>cope</b> with the pe-culiarities of smart-appliances ensembles {{and that it is}} thus a suitable option for their self-organization processes. ...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{performance}} issues commercial {{off the shelf}} components {{are becoming more and}} more appealing in application fields where fault tolerant computing is mandatory. As a result, <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> with the intrinsic unreliability of such components against certain fault types like those induced by ionizing radiations, cost-effective fault tolerant architectures are needed. In this paper we present an in-depth experimental evaluation of a hybrid architecture to detect transient faults affecting microprocessors. The architecture leverages an hypervisor-based task-level redundancy scheme that operates in conjunction with a custom-developed hardware module. The experimental evaluation shows that our lightweight redundancy scheme is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> effectively <b>cope</b> with malicious faults as those affecting the pipeline of a RISC microprocesso...|$|R

5|$|Power {{and water}} schemes were {{expanded}} to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> with the industrial development occurring. The state {{was at a}} disadvantage {{in that it was}} completely reliant on imports for its fuel supply. South Australia's near-monopoly electricity supplier, the Adelaide Electricity Supply Company (AESC), was reluctant to build up coal reserves in case of a transportation problem. They ran on coal that was shipped over from New South Wales (NSW), where the mines were inefficient and plagued by communist-agitated industrial strife. Playford demanded that supplies be built up so the factories could keep producing; he managed to secure eight months worth of coal reserves from NSW, but even that began to dwindle due to the continued industrial action. Coal supplies were ordered from South Africa in desperation, at Playford's behest. The frustration he experienced while dealing with the AESC would later prove disastrous to the company as the Premier took action against them.|$|E
5|$|The trains were {{delivered}} late, and {{were put into}} service after the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate had given dispensation from parts of the safety regulation. On 17 June 2000, a train derailed at Nelaug Station after an axle broke. The class was grounded for a month, and the investigation showed both design errors, and lack of proper inspection and testing. After they were put back into service, they {{were not allowed to}} use the tilting mechanism—thus not being allowed to run faster than their predecessors. The construction was reinforced, and in 2004, the tilting mechanism was re-enabled along with higher speeds. In 2007, a train derailed on the Bergen Line, and questions were raised about the trains' ability to operate in snow, however the accident report showed that the trains' front axle load was just as <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> with heavy snow conditions as the locomotives running on the line, and that the derailment would have been more severe if the same conditions would hit a normal train with less secure connections between carriages. On 16 June 2011, two units were destroyed when the train ran into a fire in a snow tunnel at Hallingskeid Station.|$|E

Promotional events were also held in the United States and England. It was published by Knopf in North America and by Jonathan Cape in the United Kingdom. An excerpt {{was published in the}} October issue of Report on Business Magazine. In the Canadian market, the book spent seven weeks on the Maclean's nonfiction best sellers' list, including three weeks at the #1 spot. It did not sell well in the United States. Homer-Dixon was awarded the 2001 Governor General's Award for English language non-fiction for the book. The trade paperback was released a year after the hardcover edition. It was translated into French and published in 2002 by Éditions du Boréal. A Spanish version was published by Espasa in 2003. Homer-Dixon went on to write a similar book, , in which he elaborates upon the idea that societies are becoming less <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>cope</b> with problems, like global warming or population imbalances, as complexities compound each other and the readily available resources, like fossil fuels, are rapidly consumed.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay is to {{understand}} how children and adolescent regard participating in family therapy sessions, and the children´s views on their own contribution to the therapy. Another focus is weather family therapy can strengthen children´s identity and sence of coherence, and thus help them being more <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>coping</b> with dificulties in the future. Important questions for this work is to investigate how the attitudes and abilities of family therapists can help the children become participating subjects, and how the collaborative approach contribute to bringing new perspectives and opportunities in the family's relational context and life situation. By using Antonovsky´s salutogenic theory and narrative theory, {{the aim of this}} paper is to bring forth ways to approach children as family therapist that helps strengthen the childrens identity, self-esteem and sence of coherence. By analyzing family therapists known for being child-focused, such as Jim Wilson, Michael White, David Epston and Haldor Övreeide, and compare the approach as therapist to the conclusions of the recent studies, this paper wants to emphasize how to approach children, adolescents and parents in a way that helps children contribute to solving the problem and that brings forth new narratives about the childs identity and relational context...|$|R
