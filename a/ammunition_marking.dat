40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} marking {{practices}} applicable to conventional ammuni-tion. It {{is intended to}} present, in brief, the utility of systematic <b>ammunition</b> <b>marking</b> for improving the safety and security of conventional ammunition stocks, particularly {{in relation to the}} risk of accidents (including explosive and incendiary risks) and the potential for illicit diversion. The chapter also provides an overview of common marking methods and the rationale behind them. Marking, safety, and security Conventional <b>ammunition</b> <b>marking</b> can be defined as the application of marks—including colours, descriptive text, and symbols—to munitions, parts, and components thereof, and associated packaging, for the purposes of identifying, among other things, their role, operational features, and age; and the potential hazards posed by those munitions (UKMoD, 2006 a, p. 4; US Navy, 2001, p. 1). Marking is a critical precursor to effective stockpile manage-ment and, ultimately, has considerable bearing on the safety and security of ammunition stocks...|$|E

5000|$|Willis {{arrived on}} the Somme front with the Lafayette Escadrille (N 124) in March, 1917. Soon after {{arriving}} Willis redesigned the squadron insignia changing it from a Seminole warrior to a Sioux warrior. The original indian head was printed on boxes of <b>ammunition</b> <b>marked</b> [...] "Savage Arms Manufacturing Company". This company was providing ammunition for machine guns used by reconnaissance units and bombers of the French military aviation.Sgt. Willis, was captured after an aerial battle, probably against Lt. Wilhelm Schulz of Jasta 16b, 18 August 1917. The aircraft was hit numerous times with damage to the engine which forced the pilot to land in German territory near Convensoye, France.|$|R

25|$|Much {{speculation}} {{occurred over}} the date chosen for their attack. The original intended date of the attack may have been April 19; Harris required more <b>ammunition</b> from <b>Mark</b> Manes, who did not deliver it until the evening of April 19.|$|R
40|$|Lot {{numbers are}} marks that {{are applied to}} {{ammunition}} {{at the point of}} manu-facture, assembly, or modification. They identify a quantity of ammunition that has been assembled from uniform components and under similar condi-tions. These marks are applied to facilitate accounting and general manage-ment of <b>ammunition.</b> <b>Marks</b> may be applied on ammunition components themselves and/or on the packaging of the ammunition. Small arms ammunition is rarely lot <b>marked</b> on the <b>ammunition</b> itself, such as on the cartridge case. This chapter argues that applying lot marks di-rectly to small arms cartridges offers some security forces the prospect of in-creased logistical efficiency. In addition, lot marking of small arms ammuni-tion has proved to be an effective way of discouraging and detecting diversion from national stockpiles...|$|R
50|$|The gun was 3 ft {{long and}} its cyclic {{rate of fire}} was between 450 and 600 rounds per minute. In practice, it was {{expected}} that 10,000 rounds would be fired per hour, and that the barrel would be changed every hour—a two-minute job for a trained team. The Vickers gun could sustain fire for long durations of time exceeding the recommended 10,000 rounds an hour due to the water-cooled barrel and hourly barrel swaps. One account states a Vickers fired just under 5 million rounds in a week as a test in 1963 at Strensall Barracks and was still operable. The Mark 8 cartridge, which had a boat-tailed bullet, could be used against targets at a range of approximately 4500 yd. The muzzle-velocity for Vickers rounds were generally 2440 ±40 feet per second with a 150- to 175-grain bullet. The shell was generally made of an alloy of cupro-nickel, and gilding metal. Ammunition for the Vickers used colour-coded annuli. Tracer <b>ammunition</b> was <b>marked</b> with a red annulus; armouring-piercing ammunition a green annulus, and incendiary <b>ammunition</b> was <b>marked</b> with a blue annulus. Lastly, explosive <b>ammunition</b> was <b>marked</b> with an orange annulus before the Second World War and was changed to black.|$|R
50|$|The Carl Gustaf {{was used}} against Taliban {{defensive}} fortifications by soldiers of Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry in operations in Afghanistan. They {{developed a new}} system for firing at night in which a spotter with a night-scope fires tracer <b>ammunition</b> to <b>mark</b> the target for the Carl Gustaf gunner.|$|R
50|$|The United States {{acquired}} some 60 pounders, presumably for evaluation, {{reported in}} its May 1920 Handbook of Artillery :-"The United States procured {{a number of}} batteries of 5-inch 60 pounder guns with the necessary accompanying vehicles from Great Britain. The materiel is of British design and manufacture throughout, and the units ceded to the United States include the Gun, Mark I, mounted on a carriage, Mark II; the gun carriage limber, <b>Mark</b> II, the <b>ammunition</b> wagon, <b>Mark</b> II; and the <b>ammunition</b> wagon limber, <b>Mark</b> II".The accompanying photograph in the manual depicts a Mk I gun on Mk II carriage with traction-engine wheels typical of the Mk II carriage, and the accompanying diagram depicts the gun in the forward traveling position (i.e. with weight over the gun carriage) typical of the Mk II carriage mounting.|$|R
50|$|Each <b>ammunition</b> box was <b>marked</b> {{with the}} FSN and DODIC along {{the upper part}} of the box. It also was {{embossed}} with the ammunition designation and type (i.e., 5.56mm NATO M193 BALL), and there were symbols indicating packing method (linked, clips or cartons; bandoleers or containers).|$|R
5000|$|Early US Military <b>ammunition</b> {{boxes were}} <b>marked</b> with {{vertical}} rectangles or cartridge shapes lll instead. When the symbol was straight it indicated [...]30 ammunition {{and when the}} symbol was angled it indicated [...]50 ammunition. The Lot number was also marked with a [...] "B" [...] suffix for cloth belts or L for metal link belts.|$|R
50|$|This {{ended up}} with the 83rd moving as fast as an armored task force in a weird {{assortment}} of hurriedly repainted captured German vehicles: Wehrmacht jeeps, staff cars, <b>ammunition</b> trucks, <b>Mark</b> Very and Tiger panzers, motor bikes, buses and two cherished fire engines. Every enemy unit or town that surrendered or was captured subscribed its quota of rolling stock for the division, usually at gunpoint. Every newly acquired vehicle got a quick coat of olive-green paint and a U.S. star slapped on its side; then it joined the 83rd. The men of the Rag-Tag Circus had even managed to liberate a German ME-109 and surprisingly found someone to fly it.|$|R
5000|$|Basic Pouch: A large {{vertical}} rectangular pouch {{that went}} through three versions (Marks I, II, and III). It could carry either (2) BREN magazines, (6) 20-round Thompson SMG magazines, (4) No 36M Fragmentation, No 69 Offensive, or No.77 White Phosphorus grenades, (4) No 36M cup-discharger rifle grenades with attached gas-check baseplates, (2) Smoke Grenades, or boxes of Small Arms <b>Ammunition.</b> The <b>Mark</b> I version had three cartridge loops sewn into the inner lid for carrying three ballistite Rifle Grenade Blanks for launching rifle grenades; this feature was later omitted on the Mark II pouch. The longer Basic Pouch Mark III could hold (5) 32-round STEN Machine Carbine Magazines.|$|R
50|$|Forensic {{ballistics}} involves {{analysis of}} bullets and bullet impacts to determine information {{of use to}} a court or other part of a legal system. Separately from ballistics information, firearm and tool mark examinations ("ballistic fingerprinting") involve analyzing firearm, <b>ammunition,</b> and tool <b>mark</b> evidence {{in order to establish}} whether a certain firearm or tool was used in the commission of a crime.|$|R
40|$|Tracing {{is a set}} {{of diverse}} methods used to {{identify}} ammunition, its origins, and patterns of transfer. It is a prerequisite for successful ammunition management and a crucial means of identifying diversion and the illicit trade in all munitions. Tracing is contingent on being able to identify specific production runs, batches, lots, and other collections of ammunition, and to ascertain where they have come from. It therefore shares many similarities with ammunition accounting procedures (CHAPTER 5), but its application is usually retrospec-tive and applied to illicitly circulating arms and ammunition—notably di-verted munitions (CHAPTER 15). This chapter sketches a number of modes of ammunition tracing, ranging from identifying stocks via systematic and accurate markings to methodologies that can be applied where <b>ammunition</b> is poorly <b>marked</b> or bears no markings at all. It concludes that ammunition tracing is in its infancy, but offers consider-able hope for identifying and alleviating illicit arms proliferation. Modes of tracing There are two modes of ammunition tracing: direct identification using <b>marks</b> on the <b>ammunition</b> in question and indirect identification by a process of elimi-nation. As Table 4. 1 illustrates, the degree to which each method is employed is contingent on the degree of specificity in the way <b>ammunition</b> is <b>marked...</b>|$|R
50|$|Another direct {{outcome of}} the event at Kulachal was the {{takeover}} of the black pepper trade {{by the state of}} Travancore. This development was to have serious repercussions on the Dutch and the trading world of Kerala at large. In 1753 the Dutch signed the Treaty of Mavelikkara with the Dutch agreeing not to obstruct the Raja's expansion, and in turn, to sell to him arms and <b>ammunition.</b> This <b>marked</b> {{the beginning of the end}} of Dutch influence in India. The VOC (Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie, or the Dutch East India Company) continued to sell Indonesian spices and sugar in Kerala until 1795, at which time the English conquest of the Kingdom of Kochi ended their rule in India.|$|R
5000|$|The {{projectiles}} of RML 9 inch guns Marks I-V (the Woolwich rifled guns) {{had several}} rows of [...] "studs" [...] which engaged with the gun's rifling to impart spin. Sometime after 1878, [...] "attached gas-checks" [...] were fitted to {{the bases of}} the studded shells, reducing wear on the guns and improving their range and accuracy. Subsequently [...] "automatic gas-checks" [...] were developed which could rotate shells, allowing the deployment of a new range of studless ammunition. Thus, any particular gun potentially operated {{with a mix of}} studded and studless <b>ammunition.</b> The <b>Mark</b> VI high-angle gun had polygroove rifling, and was only able to fire studless ammunition, using a different automatic gas-check from the one used with Marks I-V.|$|R
50|$|Davis {{agreed to}} Jackson's request. On May 9, the steamer J. C. Swan {{delivered}} the Confederate aid: two 12-pound howitzers, two 32-pound siege guns, 500 muskets, and <b>ammunition,</b> in crates <b>marked</b> as Tamoroa marble. The munitions {{had been captured}} by the Confederates when they seized the Federal Baton Rouge Arsenal. MVM officers met the shipment at the St. Louis riverfront, and transported it to Camp Jackson, 6 mi inland.|$|R
50|$|On 29 October 50 Syrian Free Syrian Army (FSA) fighters {{crossed the}} border from Turkey into Kobanî. Two days later, more than 20 {{vehicles}} with Kurdish Peshmerga forces entered the city of Kobanî from Sh'ir Hill in the western countryside of the city. The Iraqi Peshmerga forces numbered around 150, and brought heavy weapons and <b>ammunition.</b> These arrivals <b>marked</b> the first time Turkey allowed ground troops from outside Syria to reinforce the Kurds defending Kobanî.|$|R
50|$|If the lot {{is made up}} of {{salvaged}} ammunition, it must be {{from the}} same Lot. If different ammunition types are mixed (as when ball and tracer ammunition are linked into a machinegun belt) and they originally had separate lot numbers, they must have all the <b>ammunition</b> lot numbers <b>marked</b> on the packaging. The repacker also has to put their manufacturer or military depot code and the two-digit year it was repacked on the packaging as well.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ammunition</b> crates were <b>marked</b> {{with the}} FSN and DODIC {{along the top}} of the front panel. Early crates from 1949 to 1956 also {{included}} the alphanumeric Ammunition Identification Code in the upper right corner. The weight in pounds and volume in cubic feet were stamped in the lower left corner. The Lot Code was stamped in the lower right corner. The text in the center of the front panel detailed the amount and type of contents the crate contained.|$|R
5000|$|During the First World War Browse {{served as}} the Company Sergeant Major of the 6th Battalion Seaforth Highlanders, part of the 51st (Highland) Division, where he was awarded during the Battle of Arras the Military Cross for [...] "conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty." [...] His {{citation}} included this description of his cited action: After all his officers had become casualties he consolidated a forward line, and held on against enemy counter-attacks for two days with three platoons. His coolness, powers of leadership, and of keeping up the spirits of his men, who were short of water, rations and <b>ammunition,</b> were most <b>marked.</b>|$|R
50|$|The earlier wartime Mark I, Mark II, and Mark II* {{versions}} of the Besa 7.92 mm were declared obsolete in 1951 and all Mark III versions were converted to Mark III*. The Mark III/2 introduced in 1952 was a conversion of the Mark III* with a new bracket and body cover. The later Mark III/3 introduced in 1954 was a conversion of the Mark III/2 that replaced the barrel and sleeve and made the gas vents larger on the gas cylinder {{to make it easier}} to use belts of mixed <b>ammunition.</b> The post-war <b>Mark</b> III/2 and Mark III/3 remained in service until the late 1960s.|$|R
5000|$|The Mark 2, Nos. 3 - 70, was a 40 caliber naval {{gun that}} fired semi-fixed <b>ammunition.</b> The <b>Mark</b> 2 {{consisted}} of tube, jacket, and 2 hoops, being hooped to 68.5 {{in from the}} muzzle. The Mod 1 had different exterior dimensions for the hoops and chase and was primarily intended {{to be used with}} the Mark 2 Mods 1 and 4 mounts. Mod 2 had a cylindrical jacket that was 15.5 in in diameter for 2.75 in {{to the rear of the}} mounting threads. It was intended for the Mark 2 Mods 1 and 4 and Mark 3 Mods 1 and 6 mounts. Mod 3 was the same as the Mod 2 but without the cylindrical section. It was designed to use the Mark 2 Mods 1, 2, 4, and 5 and the Mark 3 Mods 1, 4, 6, and 9 mounts. The Mod 4 only differed from the Mark 3 in that it had a muzzle bell. Mod 5, gun No. 39, was an experimental gun that hd 25 in cut off of the muzzle, making it a 35-caliber gun. It also had a locking hoop that extended the whole length of the chase hoop to help balance the gun. The Mod 6 was a Mod 4 gun that had been modified for use in the 5-inch Mark 8 Mods 4, 13, and 14 mounts. The breech was turned down a 0.25 in to 16.25 in for 13.435 in from the face of the breech with the front part of the thread for the sleeve cut away. The Mod 7 gun was a Mod 2, 3, or 4 that had a conical nickel-steel liner and a Mod 8 was a Mod 6 gun also with a conical nickel-steel liner. The first gun that was delivered in October 1890 was gun No. 5. The Mark 2 was intended for use on battleships and cruisers, such as , [...] protected cruisers, [...] unprotected cruisers, and auxiliary cruisers such as [...]|$|R

5000|$|Belgian {{inventor}} de Wilde, who {{was living}} in Switzerland, invented a new bullet in 1938. In December of that year the British Air Ministry purchased the design. However, as the bullet {{had to be made}} by hand rather than mass-produced, Major C. Aubrey Dixon of the British Royal Arsenal at Woolwich developed a greatly improved bullet with similar incendiary capabilities. This was adopted by British forces as the 0.303 Incendiary B Mark VI. For security reasons, and to confuse the enemy, it was initially called 'de Wilde' ammunition, even though the design was almost entirely different from the original version. The B Mark VI incendiary bullet was packed with nitrocellulose, and a small steel ball was placed in the tip of the bullet to ensure that the chemical exploded on impact. As opposed to earlier designs, the B Mark VI was a true incendiary rather than tracer <b>ammunition.</b> The B <b>Mark</b> VI incendiary bullets were first issued in June 1940 and tested operationally in the Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire in the air battles over Dunkirk. The explosive power, coupled with the flash on impact which guided their aim, was much appreciated by pilots. The bullets were at first scarce, and as a result, a mix of ball, AP, Mk IV incendiary tracer and Mk VI incendiary were used until production increased to sufficient levels. By 1942 the standard loading for fixed [...]303s was half loaded with AP and half with incendiary bullets.|$|R
