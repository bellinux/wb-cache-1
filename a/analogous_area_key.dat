40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{backbone of the}} success of the United States Naval Forces has been its ability to train for future events. By conducting successful training operations, the Navy has prepared for real-world operations. The principle, "fight like you train, train like you fight," has no less significance today than it did in the past. The purpose of this thesis is to develop a new, robust <b>analogous</b> <b>area</b> determination tool for the USN Fleet. This thesis builds upon previous approaches by expanding the potential <b>analogous</b> <b>areas</b> to the entire globe, and including more environmental parameters in the <b>analogous</b> <b>area</b> determination process. In addition, a different approach is used in determining the <b>analogous</b> <b>areas.</b> Instead of a MATLAB-based fuzzy logic approach, this method uses ArcMap software as a tool for performing <b>analogous</b> <b>area</b> searches and display of results. This method is more efficient and user-friendly than the fuzzy logic approach, and allows users to easily tailor the process to meet any requirement. The focus of this thesis is primarily on acoustic features within the water column, but other important environmental features are analyzed. The end result is an effective and accurate <b>analogous</b> <b>area</b> tool ready for immediate use in the fleet. Outstanding ThesisUS Navy (USN) author...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Climate {{change is}} one of the most crucial {{ecological}} problems of our age with great influence. Seasonal dynamics of aquatic communities are — among others — regulated by the climate, especially by temperature. In this case study we attempted the simulation modelling of the seasonal dynamics of a copepod species, Cyclops vicinus, which ranks among the zooplankton community, based on a quantitative database containing ten years of data from the Danube’s Göd area. We set up a simulation model predicting the abundance of Cyclops vicinus by considering only temperature as it affects the abundance of population. The model was adapted to eight years of daily temperature data observed between 1981 and 1994 and was tested successfully with the additional data of two further years. The model was run with the data series of climate change scenarios specified for the period around 2070 - 2100.
