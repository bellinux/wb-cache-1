5|$|Plays {{were being}} {{performed}} while Corder was still awaiting trial, and an anonymous author published a melodramatic {{version of the}} murder after the execution, a precursor of the Newgate novels which quickly became best-sellers. The Red Barn Murder was a popular subject, along {{with the story of}} Jack Sheppard and other highwaymen, thieves and murderers, for penny gaffs, cheap plays performed in the back rooms of public houses. James Catnach sold more than a million broadsides (sensationalist single sheet newspapers) which gave details of Corder's confession and the execution, and included a sentimental ballad supposedly written by Corder himself (though {{more likely to have been}} the work of Catnach or somebody in his employ). It was one of at least five ballads <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> that appeared directly following the execution.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{brought in}} a European Red Cross {{committee}} called the Katyn Commission, comprising 12 forensic experts and their staff, from Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, Finland, France, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Sweden, and Slovakia. The Germans were so intent on proving that the Soviets were behind the massacre that they even included some Allied prisoners of war, among them writer Ferdynand Goetel, the Polish Home Army prisoner from Pawiak. After the war, Goetel escaped with a fake passport due to an arrest warrant issued against him. Jan Emil Skiwski was a collaborator. Józef Mackiewicz has published several texts <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime.</b> Two of the 12, the Bulgarian Marko Markov and the Czech František Hájek, with their countries becoming satellite states of the Soviet Union, were forced to recant their evidence, defending the Soviets and blaming the Germans.

After the publication of London crime figures in June 2010, The Sunday Telegraph suggested Liddle was largely right on some of his claims, but that he was probably wrong on his claims about knife crimes and violent sex crimes.|$|E

500|$|In Poland, the pro-Soviet {{authorities}} {{covered up}} {{the matter in}} accordance with the official Soviet propaganda line, deliberately censoring any sources that might provide information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime.</b> Katyn was a forbidden topic in postwar Poland. Censorship in the Polish People's Republic was a massive undertaking and Katyn was specifically mentioned in the [...] "Black Book of Censorship" [...] used by the authorities to control the media and academia. Not only did government censorship suppress all references to it, but even mentioning the atrocity was dangerous. In the late 1970s, democracy groups like the Workers' Defence Committee and the Flying University defied the censorship and discussed the massacre, in the face of arrests, beatings, detentions, and ostracism. In 1981, Polish trade union Solidarity erected a memorial with the simple inscription [...] "Katyn, 1940". It was confiscated by the police and replaced with an official monument with the inscription: [...] "To the Polish soldiers—victims of Hitlerite fascism—reposing in the soil of Katyn". Nevertheless, every year on the day of Zaduszki, similar memorial crosses were erected at Powązki Cemetery and numerous other places in Poland, only to be dismantled by the police. Katyn remained a political taboo in the Polish People's Republic until the fall of the Eastern Bloc in 1989.|$|E
500|$|Mugford {{said she}} had spent the weekend before the murders with Bamber in his cottage in Goldhanger, where he had dyed his hair black. She had seen his mother's bicycle there, she said; the {{prosecution}} later alleged that he had used this bicycle to cycle between his cottage and the farmhouse {{on the night of}} the murders, to avoid being seen in his car on the road. She told police Bamber had telephoned her at 9:50pm on 6 August to say he had been thinking <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> all day, was [...] "pissed off", and that it was [...] "tonight or never". A few hours later, at 3:00–3:30am on 7 August, she said he phoned her again to say: [...] "Everything is going well. Something is wrong at the farm. I haven't had any sleep all night... bye honey and I love you lots." [...] Her flatmates' evidence suggested that call had come through closer to 3:00am. He called her later in the morning to tell her that Sheila had gone mad, and that a police car was coming to pick her up. When she arrived with the police at Bamber's cottage, she said he had pulled her to one side and said: [...] "I should have been an actor." ...|$|E
500|$|The only {{preserved}} {{example of}} the variant Blakumen of the ethnonym was an inscription on a runestone in the Sjonhem cemetery in Gotland in Sweden. The forms of the runes on the memorial stone suggest that it was raised in approximately 1050 AD. According to its inscription, a Varangian couple named Hróðvísl and Hróðelfr set up the stone in memory {{of one of their}} sons, Hróðfúss, who had been treacherously killed by Blakumen while traveling abroad. Although the inscription does not contain more information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime,</b> Spinei expands on the inscription, arguing that Hróðfúss was murdered by Vlachs in the regions east of the Carpathian Mountains. Curta proposes that Hróðfúss was a merchant traveling towards Constantinople, who was attacked and killed by Vlachs north of the Lower Danube. Jesch likewise suggests that Hróðfúss was a merchant [...] "on a voyage abroad", and assumes that he was murdered by local merchants who betrayed his trust. Jesch translates Blakumen as Vlachs, confronting their treachery with their untrustworthiness as claimed by Kekaumenos. Jesch also allows for the possibility that the term may have meant [...] "black men", in which case the meaning is unclear. [...] Pritsak refuses to identify the Blakumen in the inscription with Vlachs, instead stating that they were Cumans, whose migration towards the westernmost regions of the Pontic steppes began around the time when the memorial stone was erected. Spinei counters this view on account of the fact that several mentions of the Blakumen or Blökumen (for instance in the Eymund's Saga) occur in contexts taking place decades before the earliest appearance of the Cumans in the Pontic steppe. Spinei also says that if understood as meaning [...] "Black Cumans", then the term is not concordant with the Varangian ethnic terminology (derived from either Germanic or East-Slavic naming traditions), that it is not attested in mirror forms in other languages (such as *cumani nigri in Latin or *mauro Koumanoi in Greek), and that the juxtaposition of a Scandinavian adjective and a proper name of Greek or Latin origin (at the expense of the German Walven designating Cumans) to produce Blakumen ("black Cumans") and Blokumannaland ("the land of the black Cumans") is highly improbable.|$|E
