25|$|Scott {{testified that}} he then endured five days of {{derogatory}} comments about himself, his beliefs, his girlfriend and his pastor, and diatribes by Ross {{about the ways in}} which Christianity and conservative Protestantism were wrong. He was intimidated, forced to watch videos on cults and told his church was just the same. He said he was watched 24 hours a day. On every visit to the bathroom, he was accompanied by at least two men. Every day, Ross argued with Scott about matters of religion, without giving him <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> anything in return, often tapping him or hitting him on the head to underscore his points while Scott was being restrained or closely watched. Scott was told that he would only regain his liberty once the deprogramming had been concluded successfully and he had given up his beliefs.|$|E
500|$|The West Wing {{was honored}} with nine Primetime Emmy Awards for its debut season, making the series a record holder for most Emmys {{won by a}} series in a single season at the time. Following the ceremony, a fiasco ensued, {{centered}} on the category for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series. The West Wing episode [...] "In Excelsis Deo" [...] won, which was awarded to Sorkin and Rick Cleveland, while it was reported in a The New York Times article that Cleveland had been ushered off the stage by Sorkin without being given <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> a few words. The story behind The West Wing episode is based on Cleveland's father, a Korean war veteran who spent {{the last years of}} his life on the street, as Cleveland explains in his FreshYarn.com essay titled [...] "I Was the Dumb Looking Guy with the Wire-Rimmed Glasses". A back and forth took place between Sorkin and Cleveland in a public web forum at Mighty Big TV where Sorkin explained that he gives his writers [...] "Story By" [...] credit on a rotating basis [...] "by way of a gratuity" [...] and that he had thrown out Cleveland's script and started from scratch. In the end, Sorkin apologized to Cleveland. Cleveland and Sorkin also won the [...] at the 53rd Writer Guild of America Awards for [...] "In Excelsis Deo".|$|E

Depp explained in further detail during the interview: [...] "I wouldn't say I'm dropping out any second, but I would say it's probably not too far away. When you add up the amount of dialogue that you say per year and you realise that you've said written words more than you've had <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> your own words, you start thinking about that as an insane option for a human being." ...|$|E

2500|$|Zach was {{eventually}} confirmed {{as the father}} of the child by magazine Soap Opera Digest. Bianca's reasons for asking Zach to be the donor and doing so without informing her sister and Zach's wife, Kendall Hart Slater, infuriated viewers. They reasoned that neither Bianca nor Zach would do this to Kendall. After Ellen.com stated, [...] "This storyline is all kinds of wrong — and not just because it makes [...] feel like [...] need a shower. Bianca and Kendall have a strong, very close relationship." [...] The website could not fathom that Bianca would make [...] "a move like this" [...] without discussing it with Kendall first. Bianca's reason, however, was that {{she did not want to}} give Kendall <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> no.|$|E
2500|$|We heard {{something}} was wrong with my dad during the [...] World Cup. He started feeling unwell and then, out of the blue, we were told he only had a few months to live. It was a huge shock because we've always been a very close family. I missed the first couple of Tests in England that year so I could be at home with him. It was obviously the saddest time of my life but those last weeks were maybe some of the most beautiful. It gave me <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> thank you and goodbye. After a while I realised how lucky I was to do that. It's far harder if a parent is taken away before you have that time together. So his death put cricket in perspective for me. It's just a game – and a very simple game if you keep your mind straight.|$|E
2500|$|On February 1, 2012, CBS {{announced}} that the 10th season of CSI: Miami would have its episode order reduced to 19 episodes, {{in order to make}} room on the schedule for mid-season replacement NYC 22. On May 13, 2012, CSI: Miami was canceled. Series star Emily Procter later stated that [...] "the cancellation was kind of shocking for everyone because they had given an indication that [...] might go, so people would have been prepared and we just weren't prepared." [...] Procter had previously commented on the longevity of the series, commenting that [...] "I remember sitting around with David in the parking lot during season one, getting ready for the first episode to air. We said [...] 'we are going {{to spend the rest of}} our lives together. For better or worse.'" [...] Eva LaRue later echoed Procter's sentiments, stating that she [...] "was sad because we did not get <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> goodbye to the fans or to each other".|$|E

2500|$|Jeannie Miller, Rodney McKay's sister, {{comes to}} Atlantis when she learns her brother has been {{infected}} with a mysterious disease {{known as the}} [...] "Second Childhood", the Pegasus equivalent of fast on-set Alzheimer's disease. The Expedition gives Jeannie <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> goodbye; Rodney has already regressed to a childlike state and all attempts at medical intervention have failed. Jennifer Keller explains that McKay became infected with the Second Childhood parasite at some point {{over the past two}} weeks, and that she misinterpreted the first symptoms when they appeared after a mission to M44-5YN. The subsequent deterioration of McKay's mind is shown through a series of flashbacks and self-made video recordings. Keller blames herself for not catching the disease sooner, but refuses to give up even as McKay has only a few days left to live. Ronon Dex proposes an alternative: a shrine on the planet Talus that grants those afflicted with the Second Childhood a single day of mental clarity, followed by a quick death. Jeannie overrules Keller's wishes and asks that McKay be brought to the planet. Despite the fact that the planet has become a Wraith stronghold, Richard Woolsey reluctantly approves the mission.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after her}} term began, Congress was called into an {{extraordinary}} April session {{in response to}} Germany's declaration of unrestricted submarine warfare on all Atlantic shipping. On April 2, 1917, President Woodrow Wilson, addressing a joint session, asked Congress to [...] "make {{the world safe for}} democracy" [...] by declaring war on Germany. [...] After intense debate, the war resolution came to a vote in the House at 3 o'clock in the morning on April 6; Rankin cast one of fifty votes in opposition. [...] "I wish to stand for my country," [...] she said, [...] "but I cannot vote for war." [...] Years later, she would add, [...] "I felt the first time the first woman had <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> no to war, she should say it." [...] Although 49 male Representatives—and six Senators—joined her in voting against the declaration, Rankin was singled out for criticism. [...] Some considered her vote to be a discredit to the suffragist movement and to her authority in Congress, but others applauded it, including Alice Paul of the National Woman's Party and Representative Fiorello LaGuardia of New York.|$|E

5000|$|... "Without Ceremony" [...] {{is about}} Emma's {{spontaneous}} nature. While it may perhaps {{be related to}} the last time she entertained guests who stayed longer than they should have, more significantly it conveys Hardy's sense (like many people in mourning) that he never had <b>a</b> proper <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> good-bye <b>to</b> Emma. The lack of ceremony of her departure from life it details resonated with the estrangment of their marriage, which saw his growing indifference matched by her unpredictable attempts at independence. The resulting bitterness infusing Hardy's feelings was one of the motivations behind his subsequent pilgrimage to the places where he and Emma had first met, to recapture something of those happier times in his poetry.|$|R

50|$|In the {{penultimate}} season 13, {{the producers}} of the series {{were looking for a}} Pam look-alike in order to give Bobby one last fling before his marriage to April Stevens, played by Sheree J. Wilson, and to give Bobby Ewing <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> sort of <b>say</b> goodbye <b>to</b> his former wife, as he never had the chance when Pamela had left abruptly back in 1987. Michaels was asked to return to the show, this time not as Pamela Ewing, but as a Pam Ewing lookalike named Jeanne O'Brien. After her 4-episode stint on the show, Michaels' character Jeanne was written out.|$|R

2500|$|The {{turning point}} in Arthur's career came when she was chosen by Frank Capra to star in Mr. Deeds Goes to Town. Capra had spotted her in a daily rush from the film Whirlpool in 1934 and {{convinced}} Cohn to have Columbia Studios sign her for his next film as a tough newspaperwoman {{who falls in love}} with a country bumpkin millionaire. Even though several colleagues later recalled that Arthur was troubled by extreme stage fright during production, Mr. Deeds was critically acclaimed and propelled her to international stardom. In 1936 alone, she earned $119,000, more than the President of the United States and baseball player Lou Gehrig. With fame also came media attention, something Arthur greatly disliked. She did not attend any social gatherings, such as formal parties in Hollywood, and acted difficult when having to work with an interviewer. She was named the American Greta Garbo – who was also known for her reclusive life – and magazine Movie Classic wrote of her in 1937: [...] "With Garbo talking right out loud in interviews, receiving the press and even welcoming <b>an</b> occasional <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> her say in the public prints, the palm for elusiveness among screen stars now goes to Jean Arthur." ...|$|R

60|$|What I am {{arriving}} at is this: When whole races and peoples conspire to propagate gigantic mute {{lies in the}} interest of tyrannies and shams, why should we care anything about the trifling lies told by individuals? Why should we try to make it appear that abstention from lying is a virtue? Why should we want to beguile ourselves in that way? Why should we without shame help the nation lie, and then be ashamed to do a little lying on our own account? Why shouldn't we be honest and honourable, and lie every time we get <b>a</b> <b>chance?</b> That is <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> why shouldn't we be consistent, and either lie all the time or not at all? Why should we help the nation lie the whole day long and then object to telling one little individual private lie in our own interest to go to bed on? Just for the refreshment of it, I mean, and to take the rancid taste out of our mouth.|$|R
50|$|As {{they are}} {{discussing}} this an elf from Sentarshadeen comes {{to tell them}} of the Endarkened. They do not give him <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> speak and <b>say</b> {{if he does not}} leave they will kill him. They then banish Cilarnen and do the same thing to him as they did to Kellen—send the Outlaw Hunt after him. Once he is outside he meets the elf, who says he will help him escape. Kellen, Idalia, Jermayan, Vestakia, Shalkan and the knights find the place where the children are hidden. Idalia has a cloak that makes people invisible and hides sound and smell and decides to go in and help them. The things that kidnapped them are half-elf half-goblin, made by the Endarkened, which is why they could get into elven lands and help get others in elven lands. She gets all the children out including Sandalon. However Sandalon's nurse Lairamo and Idalia cannot fit under the cloak. Lairamo takes the cloak grudgingly, leaving Idalia, and goes ahead. Idalia tries to be quiet but gets caught and falls off a cliff.|$|R

Sting noted that he had never had <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> properly <b>say</b> goodbye <b>to</b> his fans. He then announced that Final Resolution had been [...] "his goodbye", before thanking the TNA management and the fans.
