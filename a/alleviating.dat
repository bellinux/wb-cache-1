40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} the current {{investigation}} was to study the effect of Ca 2 + on the seed germination of coastal species like Arthrocnemum indicum, A. macrostachyum, Desmostachya bipinnata, Halopyrum mucronatum and Urochondra setulosa under NaCl salinity. Seed germination was inhibited with the increase in NaCl concentration and species differ in their range of NaCl tolerance. Inclusion of CaCl 2 partially or completely <b>alleviated</b> NaCl effects on the germination of all species. In the case of A. macrostachyum calcium application completely <b>alleviated</b> salinity effects at all concentrations of NaCl, while in the case of A. indicum and D. bipinnata calcium completely <b>alleviated</b> NaCl effects except at 800 mM NaCl. While in the case of H. mucronatum and U. setulosa Ca 2 + completely <b>alleviated</b> the NaCl effects at low concentration and partially <b>alleviated</b> at higher concentrations. 1...|$|R

This, coupled with Qi and Tan's efforts to secure the frontier, brought a period of relative peace along the border. However, minor raids still happened {{from time to time}} when the profits of plunder outweighed those of trade, prompting the Ming to close all gaps along the frontier around Beijing. Areas of difficult terrain once considered impassable were also walled off, leading to the well-known vistas of a stone-faced Great Wall snaking over dramatic landscapes that tourists still see today.|$|E

5|$|Biomass {{for heat}} and {{power is a}} fully mature {{technology}} which offers a ready disposal mechanism for municipal, agricultural, and industrial organic wastes. However, the industry has remained relatively stagnant over the decade to 2007, even though demand for biomass (mostly wood) continues to grow in many developing countries. One {{of the problems of}} biomass is that material directly combusted in cook stoves produces pollutants, leading to severe health and environmental consequences, although improved cook stove programmes are <b>alleviating</b> some of these effects. First-generation biomass technologies can be economically competitive, but may still require deployment support to overcome public acceptance and small-scale issues.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{flooding}} in Florida, the heavy rainfall proved beneficial in <b>alleviating</b> drought conditions.

On September28, the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency declared seven Florida counties as disaster areas; this allocated federal funding for debris removal and repairing damaged public facilities.

5|$|Likewise, Canadian Psychiatric Association (CPA) {{recommends}} benzodiazepines alprazolam, bromazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam {{only as a}} second-line choice, if {{the treatment}} with two different antidepressants was unsuccessful. Although they are second-line agents, benzodiazepines {{can be used for}} a limited time to relieve severe anxiety and agitation. CPA guidelines note that after 4–6 weeks the effect of benzodiazepines may decrease to the level of placebo, and that benzodiazepines are less effective than antidepressants in <b>alleviating</b> ruminative worry, the core symptom of GAD. However, in some cases, a prolonged treatment with benzodiazepines as the add-on to an antidepressant may be justified.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of the storm in India, {{government}} officials there issued a severe storm warning for Thoothukudi District, and also warned fishermen not to go out to sea. Thousands were evacuated to emergency shelters prior to the storm's arrival. The cyclone produced rough surf along the southern Indian coast, and heavy rainfall in and around Thoothukudi, causing flooding in a few low-lying areas. The rainfall caused some damage to banana crops, uprooted several trees, and left some roads impassable, but was largely beneficial in <b>alleviating</b> drought conditions.

In addition, a weather station on the island reported gale-force gusting of up to 48mph (77km/h) {{at the height of the}} storm. The rain led to the cancellation of a local Little League baseball match.
