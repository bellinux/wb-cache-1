5|$|Plutonium–uranium–titanium and plutonium–uranium–zirconium were {{investigated}} {{for use as}} nuclear fuels. The <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> third element increases corrosion resistance, reduces flammability, and improves ductility, fabricability, strength, and thermal expansion. Plutonium–uranium–molybdenum has the best corrosion resistance, forming a protective film of oxides, but titanium and zirconium are preferred for physics reasons.|$|E

5|$|The bridge {{consists}} of two spans, 64.1 feet and 81.10 feet, with a 3.2 feet gap between them. The combined trussed portions of the bridge are 149.1 feet long. The bridge's Town lattice is an unusual design choice, but the later <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> queen trusses are also unusual, resulting in a unique visual appearance by the bridge's unequal spans. This gives the appearance of kingposts within the queenposts. Since the <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> steel I-beam flooring in 1973, the trusses have supported nothing but themselves. The State of Connecticut's lists the bridge as CT 1338 and the May 2012 inspection of the bridge found the deck and superstructure conditions to be satisfactory and condition of the substructure to be fair. The West Cornwall Covered bridge has been appraised as functionally obsolete.|$|E
5|$|The first {{remodeling}} {{work on the}} Ellwood Mansion {{took place}} as the 19th century drew to a close. The changes, commissioned by Isaac Ellwood, were meant to reflect more popular architectural styles including the Georgian and Colonial Revival. Many of the building's original Gothic features were replaced with more Classical elements. On the home's exterior, some of these changes {{can be observed in}} the <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> portico and porte-cochere. Inside the home, the dining room was enlarged with the <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> semicircular bay on the mansion's north facade.|$|E

5|$|As the {{aircraft}} aged, the avionics {{were viewed as}} lacking suitable components for the ground attack mission, such as terrain-following radar, GPS navigation or modern night-flight systems; consequently, several upgrades were {{carried out in the}} mid-1990s, including the <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Litening targeting pod. India placed an order for 17 additional upgraded Jaguar aircraft from Hindustan Aeronautics in 1999 and a further 20 in 2001–2002. The Indian Air Force plans to upgrade up to 125 Jaguars starting in 2013 by upgrading the avionics (including multi mode radar, auto-pilot and other changes) as part of the DARIN III programme and is considering fitting more powerful engines, Honeywell F125IN to improve performance, particularly at medium altitudes.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the awards in 1975, seven {{categories}} were presented: Best Novel, Best Short Fiction, Best Collection, Best Artist, Special Award—Professional, Special Award—Non-professional, and Life Achievement. Only a few categories have changed since then, and no changes have been made to the rules. 1978 saw the <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Convention Award, a special award given for general contributions to the genre, and the only award not given every year since the beginning. The Short Fiction award was split into Short Story and Novella awards in 1982, and in 1988 the multi-author anthologies, previously eligible for the Collection award, were split into their own Best Anthology category. No changes have been made since.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} 2005–06 season, the NHL instituted several new rules. Some {{of them were}} already used by the IIHF, such as the shootout and making the two-line pass legal. Others which were not {{picked up by the}} IIHF, such as {{requiring}} smaller goaltender equipment and the <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> goaltender trapezoid to the rink. However, the IIHF did agree to follow the NHL's league's zero-tolerance policy on obstruction and required referees to call more hooking, holding and interference penalties. In 2006, the IIHF voted to eliminate tie games and institute a three-point system: wins in regulation time would be worth three points, overtime wins would be two points and over-time losses would be worth one point. The system was first used at the 2007 World Championships.|$|E
