40|$|AbstractThis study {{aimed at}} {{investigating}} {{the incorporation of}} self-assessment in writing and its influence on improving writing skill. Forty-one Iranian female EFL learners participated in the study. Before starting the treatment learners {{had no idea of}} assessing their own writings <b>and</b> <b>the</b> task of assessment was done by <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> like most of traditional classes. At the beginning of the treatment learners were asked to write a piece of writing and assess it. They were not instructed how to do that. The criteria for assessing writing and modeling it were practiced in the following session. For four successive weeks four pieces of writing were written and given marks by the learners based on <b>the</b> discussed criteria <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> corrected their writings and gave her own marks. The data were collected through self-assessment questionnaire administered to them before <b>and</b> after <b>the</b> treatment <b>and</b> learners’ <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher's</b> marks on writings. The data were analyzed by paired t-test in order to compare the test results before <b>and</b> after <b>the</b> treatment. A repeated measure of ANOVA compared students <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher's</b> marks. <b>The</b> results of the analyses of the repeated measure showed students’ writing skill improved gradually in the treatment period. The interviews with some of <b>the</b> learners <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> confirmed that learners <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> had positive attitude towards self-assessment...|$|R

25|$|Increasingly, {{writing is}} a {{critical}} part of learning in English Language Arts and all content areas, and the ability to write effectively is a requirement for success at all levels of education, from elementary school through high school and in university and adult education classes. Studies of dialogue journal writing have shown that students (<b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>teachers,</b> classroom helpers, or prospective teachers they are writing with) increase their sense of engagement with each other, learn to express themselves for an audience, and experience an atmosphere of openness and expression. Students also develop writing fluency over time.|$|E

25|$|Since its founding, the RIPB had {{comprised}} 5 departments - Communications, Discipline, Human Resource, Welfare and the Gryphon's Committee (the latter's mandate was {{to drum up}} school spirit). Its Executive Committee {{constituted the}} Head and Deputy Head Prefects, together with the 10 Heads and Deputy Heads of each department. However, in July 2012, after an acrimonious schism between the previous Executive Committee <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> who oversaw the RIPB, the teachers initiated {{a comprehensive review of}} the RIPB's structure. It was the first in many years for the Board; and after 3 months of dialogues with students, teachers and the school management, the RIPB was streamlined to comprise 2 key branches, Standards and Spirit, reflecting the core mission of all prefects. The work of these 2 branches was supported by the Development branch. This top-down change generated a fair amount of controversy as the objections of numerous alumni to the changes were overruled by the school management.|$|E

The episode's storyline was pitched by Simpsons writer Matt Selman. In the DVD audio commentary for the episode, he stated that Matt Groening, {{the creator of the}} series, would usually tell the writers about how he was the class clown and did not pay attention in school, and yet grew up to become very successful. After hearing this, Selman thought that if Groening went back to his school to talk about his career, it [...] " [...] the last message that a principal <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> would wanna hear." [...] Selman pitched the story because {{he thought it would be}} [...] "humorously infuriating" [...] to teachers. The episode was also partly based on some of the Simpsons staff members' experience with making internet cartoons, such as Queer Duck and Hard Drinkin' Lincoln, both of which were created by Mike Reiss.|$|E
