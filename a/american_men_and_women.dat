It is also noted that 21.8 percent of Filipino Americans are multiracial, second among Asian Americans.

[...] Hunter thanked the general for his service and then argued that the sole issue was [...] "unit cohesion," [...] mirroring a statement from former Secretary of State Colin Powell. After the debate, Kerr was found {{to be a member of}} Hillary Clinton's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transsexual Americans For Hillary Steering Committee. Because of this, CNN removed footage of the question from future telecasts. The next day, Hunter sent a letter to Hillary Clinton that read: [...] "Dear Hillary Clinton, Regarding the [...] "plant", retired Brig. Gen. Keith H. Kerr, that you sent to ask me the question at the CNN-YouTube debate last night in Florida. Send more!!! Merry Christmas, Duncan Hunter."

[...] The Anti-Defamation League also stated [...] "Whatever his views may be on the administration's response to 9/11 and the conduct of the war on terrorism, likening it to Hitler's rise to power and Nazism is odious and demeans the victims of 9/11 and the brave <b>American</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> engaged in the war on terror.

2500|$|The {{interpreter}} {{warned the}} Texian officials {{that if he}} delivered this message the Comanches would attempt to escape by fighting. He was instructed to relay the message anyway {{and left the room}} as soon as he finished translating. After learning that they were being held hostage, the Comanches attempted to fight {{their way out of the}} Council House using arrows and knives. The Texian soldiers opened fire at point-blank range, killing both Indians and whites. The Comanche women and children waiting outdoors began loosing arrows after hearing the commotion inside. At least one Texian spectator was killed. When a small number of warriors managed to escape from the Council House, all of the Comanche began to flee. The soldiers who pursued them again opened fire, killing and wounding both Comanche and Texians. Armed civilians also joined the battle but, claiming they could not always differentiate between warriors and women and children, since all of the Comanche were fighting, shot at them indiscriminately. According to Anderson, such [...] "confusion" [...] between Native <b>American</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> was convenient to the Texians, who used it as an excuse to kill women and children.|$|E
2500|$|During her {{fellowship}} at the Charles Warren Center, Rossiter {{began to}} focus on the history of women in American science. She uncovered hundreds of such women when, in preparation for a postdoctoral study of 20th Century American science, she delved into the reference work American Men of Science (now called <b>American</b> <b>Men</b> <b>and</b> <b>Women</b> of Science). Hidden inside were the biographies of 500 women scientists. [...] This discovery spurred her Charles Warren Center fellowship talk, Women scientists in America before 1920 which she published [...] in the magazine American Scientist after it was rejected by Science and Scientific American. The paper's success led her to continue her research in the area, despite a lukewarm reception from both the scientific and historical communities. She took a visiting professor position at UC Berkeley where she prepared her dissertation for publication, and then she turned her attention to a new book on women scientists. Despite being told by some women scientists that [...] "there was nothing to study," [...] Rossiter found a wealth of information. This abundance of sources allowed her plans for a single book to grow into a three volume project. At the time Rossiter had still been unable to procure a tenure-track position, and was working mostly off grants. In 1981 she received the Guggenheim Fellowship which allowed her to continue her work. She published her first volume, Women Scientists in America, Struggles and Strategies to 1940, with Johns Hopkins University Press in 1982. The book was well received, including positive reviews in The New York Times, Nature, and Science.|$|E

To prune, gather, trim, conform, and ever cram and stuff, and be genteel and proper, is the pressure of our days. While aware that much can be said even in behalf of all this, we perceive {{that we have not}} now to consider the question of what is demanded to serve a half-starved and barbarous nation, or set of nations, but what is most applicable, most pertinent, for numerous congeries of conventional, over-corpulent societies, already becoming stifled and rotten with flatulent, infidelistic literature, and polite conformity and art. In addition to establish'd sciences, we suggest a science as it were of healthy average personalism, on original-universal grounds, the object of which should be to raise up and supply through the States a copious race of superb <b>American</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women,</b> cheerful, religious, ahead of any yet known.|$|E
