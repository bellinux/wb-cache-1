50|$|The first coffee {{estate in}} Ceylon was opened near Gampola in 1824, by Bird, who {{accompanied}} his older brother, Lieutenant Colonel Henry Bird, of the 16th Regiment (1780-1829) to Ceylon in 1823, {{for the purpose}} of engaging in such <b>agricultural</b> <b>undertaking</b> as inducements in the island should appear to offer; and the attention of the brothers (Col. Bird being at that time Commandant of Kandy), was directed to the cultivation of coffee; and the valley of Gampola was selected as an eligible locality wherein to carry out their intended speculations. Sir James Campbell, the then Lieutenant Governor, gave encouragement to the proposed undertaking by promising a loan and a grant of land for the purpose, which was afterwards confirmed by Sir Edward Barnes (Governor of Ceylon), and thus commenced that cultivation on the site of two ancient Kandian palaces (Singapetia and Weyanpwatte). The mode of cultivation adopted, and the enormous protective duties then in favour of the British West Indies, rendered this, and two other coffee estates at Ganga Orowa and Matale that soon followed the one at Gampola, equally unprofitable. Col. Bird's death of cholera on 3 April 1829 so paralysed the operations at Gampola that George Bird was induced to abandon the property in 1833 and relocate to Kundasale, where together with Ackland Boyd and Company, they established a coffee plantation. Due to but the financial difficulties he was compelled again to abandon the plantation. He subsequently planted a third estate, with Mr Tindall at Imbulpitiya, in Oudabulatgaiunia however owing to age and infirmities had to abandon the venture and retire. Bird moved back to his former residence at Kondasally, where exhausted by a long protracted illness, he moved to the house of his nephew in Kandy. Bird also had investments in arrack renting and was the proprietor of the Udapalata tavern in 1825.|$|E

50|$|During the {{preceding}} Mesolithic period, {{the inhabitants of}} the British Isles had been Mesolithic European hunter-gatherers. Around 4000 BCE migrants began arriving from central Europe. Although the earliest indisputably acknowledged languages spoken in the British Isles belonged to the Celtic branch of the Indo-European family it is not known what language these early farming people spoke. These migrants brought new ideas, leading to a radical transformation of society and landscape that has been called the Neolithic Revolution. The Neolithic period in the British Isles was characterised by the adoption of agriculture and sedentary living. To make room for the new farmland, these early <b>agricultural</b> communities <b>undertook</b> mass deforestation across the islands, dramatically and permanently transforming the landscape.
