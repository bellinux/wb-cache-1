40|$|Because of {{the close}} {{relation}} between oxidative stress and a plethora of inflammatory diseases, antioxidants have received an increased attention for incorporation into dermatological products. Their use and absorption are, however, limited by their low solubility in water-rich formulations. Herein, a set of novel cholinium-based salts, namely dicholinium ellagate and cholinium caffeate, syringate, vanillate, gallate, and salicylate, were synthesized and characterized. Their melting and decomposition temperatures, water solubility, and toxicological, antioxidant, cytotoxicity and pro-/anti-inflammatory activities were addressed. These new salts, exclusively composed of ions derived from natural sources, display a high thermal stability-up to 150 degrees C. The synthesized compounds are significantly more soluble in water (on average, 3 orders of magnitude higher) than the corresponding phenolic acids. Furthermore, they present not only similar but even higher antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, as well as comparable cytotoxicity and lower ecotoxicity profiles than their <b>acidic</b> <b>precursors.</b> Among all the investigated salts, dicholinium ellagate is the most promising synthesized salt when considering the respective antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities.

This study analyses and compares the production of higher alcohols and acetate esters from their amino <b>acidic</b> <b>precursors</b> in three Saccharomyces species: Saccharomyces kudriavzevii, Saccharomyces uvarum and S. cerevisiae. The global volatile compound analysis revealed that S. kudriavzevii produced large amounts of higher alcohols, whereas S. uvarum excelled in the production of acetate esters.

40|$|In many {{bacteria}} and archaea, an ancestral pathway is used where asparagine and glutamine are formed from their <b>acidic</b> <b>precursors</b> while covalently linked to tRNAAsn and tRNAGln, respectively. Stable complexes {{formed by the}} enzymes of these indirect tRNA aminoacylation pathways are found in several thermophilic organisms, and are called transamidosomes. We describe here a transamidosome forming Gln-tRNAGln in Helicobacter pylori, an ε-proteobacterium pathogenic for humans; this transamidosome displays novel properties that may be characteristic of mesophilic organisms. This ternary complex containing the non-canonical GluRS 2 specific for Glu-tRNAGln formation, the tRNA-dependent amidotransferase GatCAB and tRNAGln was characterized by dynamic light scattering. Moreover, we observed by interferometry a weak interaction between GluRS 2 and GatCAB (KD[*]=[*] 40 [*]±[*] 5 [*]µM). The kinetics of Glu-tRNAGln and Gln-tRNAGln formation indicate that conformational shifts inside the transamidosome allow the tRNAGln acceptor stem to interact alternately with GluRS 2 and GatCAB despite their common identity elements. The integrity of this dynamic transamidosome depends on a critical concentration of tRNAGln, above which it dissociates into separate GatCAB/tRNAGln and GluRS 2 /tRNAGln complexes. Ester bond protection assays show that both enzymes display a good affinity for tRNAGln regardless of its aminoacylation state, and support a mechanism where GluRS 2 can hydrolyze excess Glu-tRNAGln, ensuring faithful decoding of Gln codons...|$|R

The {{aim of the}} present work is to further clarify whether the pH of the film's precursor colloid {{is one of the}} most important factors that could influence the morphology of the ZnO films. The effects of acid nature and concentration on the pH of the precursor colloids were also investigated. The results of the X-ray diffraction, field-emission-scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy analyses reveal that the surface microstructure of the films can be tailored by adjusting the acid colloids at the optimum pH values. The morphology of the films indicates the presence of small polycrystallites with a size of similar to 20 nm when the pH of their acid colloids was adjusted to a pH domain of 5. 9 - 2. 0. However, the pH of the precursor colloids can further decrease to a pH domain below 1. 0 by using the strong mineral acid HCl or the HCOOH agent in high concentration, and numbers of large crystallites with a size of about 500 - 1000 nm appear on top of a ZnO fine crystallite layer; the surface root-mean-square of the coatings is over 71. 3 nm...|$|E
40|$|We have {{determined}} the complete {{sequence of the}} 637 -kilodalton precursor for the proline-rich polypeptides (PRPs). This protein is encoded in one large exon of a single copy gene. The <b>acidic</b> <b>precursor</b> of 5761 residues comprises a signal peptide and three large domains displaying a high proline content (11 - 15 %). The sequence of domain A (928 residues) is unique and contains several small clusters of acidic amino acids. Domain B (830 residues) exhibits seven tandem repeats, four of them displaying a strongly diverged sequence. In domain C (3914 residues) 39 units, of which only 8 are degenerate, occur in a tandem repeat. Their sequence of 100 amino acids shows a high structural similarity (76 - 92 %) and contains all the PRP variants which are produced by specific proteolytic processing. The COOH-terminal part (35 residues) is basic. Two variant PRP-precursor alleles occur which slightly differ {{in the number of}} repeats in domain C. The high degree of sequence conservation within the repeat regions suggests that the gene presumably evolved by multiple amplification and dispersion of two internal segments. In the 5097 -base pair genomic region 5 ' upstream from the translation start, several control elements for transcription are recognized. A potential binding site for the Sp 1 factor (GGGCGG) separated by 47 nucleotides from an initiator motif, most probably elements of the promoter, is detected {{in the vicinity of the}} ATG codon. Several putative androgen response elements (TGTYCT) are found in the 5 ' adjacent region and far upstream two Alu type III repeats and two (CA) n repeats are located.

Stunning {{features of this}} deposit are its uniformity over an area of 30 km 2 and the total absence of bioturbation, allowing documentation of the original sedimentary sequence. High-resolution mineralogical, petrological, elemental, isotopic (Sr-Nd), and rock magnetic data reveal a distinct microstratigraphy {{and a range of}} ejecta components. The deposit is normally graded and composed predominantly of rounded, 0. 1 - to max. 1 -mm sized spherules. Spherules are altered to dioctahedral aluminous smectite, though occasionally relict Si-Al-rich hydrated glass is also present, suggesting <b>acidic</b> <b>precursor</b> lithologies. Spherule textures vary from hollow to vesicle-rich to massive; some show in situ collapse, others include distinct Fe-Mg-Ca-Ti-rich melt globules and lath-shaped Al-rich quench crystals. Both altered glass spherules and the clay matrix (Site 1259 B) display strongly negative epsilon-Nd (T= 65 Ma) values (- 17) indicating uptake of Nd from contemporaneous ocean water during alteration. Finally, Fe-Mg-rich spherules, shocked quartz and feldspar grains, few lithic clasts, as well as abundant accretionary and porous carbonate clasts are concentrated in the uppermost 0. 5 - 0. 7 mm of the deposit. The carbonate clasts display in part very unusual textures, which are interpreted to be of shock-metamorphic origin. The preservation of delicate spherule textures, normal grading with lack of evidence for traction transport, and sub-millimeter scale compositional trends provide evidence for this spherule deposit representing a primary air-fall deposit not affected by significant reworking. The ODP Leg 207 spherule deposit is the first known dual-layer K-Pg boundary in marine settings; it incorporates compositional and stratigraphic aspects of both proximal and distal marine sites. Its stratigraphy strongly resembles the dual-layer K-Pg boundary deposits in the terrestrial Western Interior of North America (although there carbonate phases are not preserved). The occurrence of a dual ejecta layer in these quite different sedimentary environments - separated by several thousands of kilometers - provides additional evidence for an original sedimentary sequence. Therefore, the layered nature of the deposit may document compositional differences between ballistic Chicxulub ejecta forming the majority of the spherule deposit, and material falling out from the vapor (ejecta) plume, which is concentrated in the uppermost part...|$|E

40|$|A {{case study}} {{presenting}} considerable degradation of a reinforced concrete industrial building, constructed at Porto Marghera (Venice, North-Eastern Italy) in 1969, is here described. During {{the last fifty}} years the Porto Marghera area suffered from severe atmospheric pollution, with relevant emissions of sulphur and nitrogen pollutants, related to the industrial activities. Moreover, the site was affected by intense phosphate and ammonia soil pollution, related to the production of superphosphate and ammonium phosphate bearing fertilizers in the industrial plant. Concrete in the structure shows a remarkable lack of coherence with intense superficial exfoliation, up to several centimetres thick. Superficial black crusts are uniformly distributed, whereas in the lower portions of the structure in close contact with the soil the cement matrix below the cortical layer shows an anomalous yellowish colour. In these portions the conglomerate is highly incoherent and the binder is subjected to pulverization. The reinforcement bars are also deeply altered, showing severe oxidation and in some cases complete loss of shape. A selection of altered concrete samples was analyzed through a profile multi-analytical approach consisting of a combination of optical microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy coupled with EDS analysis, with the aim of characterizing the secondary phases formed and modelling the alteration processes. Moreover, the dehydration behaviour of the secondary phases was investigated on synthesized and thermally treated specimens through Rietveld refinement. Furthermore, sequence of reactions, environmental conditions, and stability of secondary mineral phases were studied and modelled using PHREEQC 2 software through a thermodynamic approach, taking into account several chemical-physical variables, such as pH and chemical composition. The results suggest severe decalcification of the cement matrix and formation of secondary sulphates and phosphates according to a marked mineralogical and textural zoning: I) gypsum, bassanite and anhydrite in the superficial efflorescence; II) monetite in the superficial crusts; III) gypsum-brushite solid solution and ardealite in the external strata; IV) octacalcium phosphate and struvite in the intermediate layers; V) apatite and struvite in the inner altered portions. The heterogeneous microstructural development of secondary phases was interpreted taking into account the different source of sulphate and phosphate pollutants, from atmospheric aerosols and through capillarity transport from the soil, respectively.

It is functionally replaced in some cases by cardiolipin, another abundant acidic phospholipid derived from phosphatidylglycerol. However, we now show that a null pgsA mutant is viable, if the major outer membrane lipoprotein is deficient. The pgsA gene normally encodes phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase that catalyzes the committed step in the biosynthesis of these acidic phospholipids. In the mutant, the activity of this enzyme and both phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin were not detected (less than 0. 01 % of total phospholipid, both below the detection limit), although phosphatidic acid, an <b>acidic</b> biosynthetic <b>precursor,</b> accumulated (4. 0 %). Nonetheless, the null mutant grew almost normally in rich media. In low-osmolarity media and minimal media, however, it could not grow.

The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the protein expression changes induced by condensed tannin intake on the fraction of mouse whole salivary proteins that are unable to form insoluble tannin-protein complexes. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis protein separation was used, followed by protein identification by mass spectrometry. Results Fifty-seven protein spots were excised from control group gels, and 21 different proteins were identified. With tannin consumption, the expression levels of one α-amylase isoform and one unidentified protein increased, whereas acidic mammalian chitinase and Muc 10 decreased. Additionally, two basic spots that stained pink with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R- 250 were newly observed, suggesting that some induced PRPs may remain uncomplexed or form soluble complexes with tannins.

Changes in the expression levels of the <b>acidic</b> mammalian chitinase <b>precursor</b> and in one of the 14 salivary α-amylase isoforms underscores the need to further investigate their role in tannin ingestion. </p...|$|R
40|$|RATIONALE: Tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra {{generated}} by collision-induced dissociation (CID) typically lack redundant peptide sequence {{information in the}} form of e. g. b- and y-ion series due to frequent use of sequence-specific endopeptidases cleaving C- or N-terminal to Arg or Lys residues. METHODS: Here we introduce arginyl-tRNA protein transferase (ATE, EC 2. 3. 2. 8) for proteomics. ATE recognizes acidic amino acids or oxidized Cys at the N-terminus of a substrate peptide and conjugates an arginine from an aminoacylated tRNA(Arg) onto the N-terminus of the substrate peptide. This enzymatic reaction is carried out under physiological conditions and, in combination with Lys-C/Asp-N double digest, results in arginylated peptides with basic amino acids on both termini. RESULTS: We demonstrate that in vitro arginylation of peptides using yeast arginyl tRNA protein transferase 1 (yATE 1) is a robust enzymatic reaction, specific to only modifying N-terminal <b>acidic</b> amino acids. <b>Precursors</b> originating from arginylated peptides generally have an increased protonation state compared with their non-arginylated forms. Furthermore, the product ion spectra of arginylated peptides show near complete 2 × fragment ladders within the same MS/MS spectrum using commonly available electrospray ionization peptide fragmentation modes. Unexpectedly, arginylated peptides generate complete y- and c-ion series using electron transfer dissociation (ETD) despite having an internal proline residue. CONCLUSIONS: We introduce a rapid enzymatic method to generate peptides flanked on either terminus by basic amino acids, resulting in a rich, redundant MS/MS fragment pattern...|$|R
40|$|Dichloroacetamide (DCAcAm) is an {{important}} type of nitrogenous disinfection byproduct. This study {{is the first to}} report that DCAcAm can be formed in the absence of chlorinated disinfectants (chlorine and chloramines). This can occur through reduction of three chloramphenicol (CAP) antibiotics by zero valent iron (ZVI). The effects of key experimental parameters, including reaction time, ZVI dose, pH, temperature, water type, and the presence of humic acid (HA) on the formation of DCAcAm were ascertained. The DCAcAm yields from three CAPs all presented the trend of increasing first and then decreasing with time and also increased with increasing ZVI dosage. DCAcAm yields from the ZVI reduction route were higher than those resulting from the chlorination of some previously identified DCAcAm <b>precursors.</b> <b>Acidic</b> conditions favored the formation of DCAcAm by the ZVI route. In addition, lower temperatures increased DCAcAm yields at extended contact times (> 12  h). DCAcAm formed from the three CAPs in the presence of HA was lower than in the absence of HA. The formation potential of DCAcAm from the reduction of authentic waters spiked with CAPs by ZVI showed good linear correlations with initial concentrations of the three CAPs. This allows the formation of DCAcAm from the reduction of CAPs by ZVI to be predicted. Given that many wastewater and drinking water distribution networks contain unlined cast iron pipes, reactions between CAPs and ZVI may contribute to the formation of DCAcAm in such systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{specific}} {{order by}} which functional neural circuits are established {{relies on the}} timely migration of newly specified neurons to target sites where they complete the differentiation program and form synapses. Chondroitin sulfate (CS) proteoglycans are well-positioned in the extracellular matrix of developing neural tissue for roles in cell proliferation, migration, growth cone guidance and axon fasciculation. In this study, we hypothesize that the newly born neurons tune into chemotactic signals in the environment by modulating the sulfation pattern of perineuronal chondroitins. We chose to study the migration of such neurons in hindbrain explants (E 11. 5 + 1 day-in-vitro, Sprague Dawley rats) using time lapse microscopy. In control cultures, neurons advanced along exiting neurites that radiated from the explant. In test cultures treated with chondroitinase ABC, neurons lost directional migration but retained motility; immunocytochemistry confirmed loss of the CS- 56 epitope in the chondroitinase ABC-treated cultures. Re-examination of the control culture revealed that the migrating neurons close to the explant core engaged in more active forward movements compared {{to those in the}} periphery (near the distal end of neurites). The regrowth of CS- 56 epitope positive CS moieties not only rescued the somal migration previously halted by ChABC treatment but also enhanced the advancement of migrating neurons. Fluorescence in situ hybridization for mRNAs of CS-sulfotransferases revealed that the migratory neurons largely expressed chondroitin- 6 -sulfotransferase- 1, chondroitin- 4 -sulfotransferase- 2, N-acetylgalactosamine 4 -sulfate 6 -O-sulfotransferaseand uronal- 2 -sulfotransferase whereas those remaining in the explant core signals largely expressed chondroitin- 4 -sulfotransferase- 1. CS- 56 epitopes were detectable in nestin-and glial fibrillary <b>acidic</b> protein-positive-neural <b>precursors</b> derived from human bone marrow stromal cells as well. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization for mRNAs of CS-sulfotransferases revealed that the mRNA expression of chondroitin- 4 -sulfotransferase- 2 remained high while chondroitin- 4 -sulfotransferase- 1 and chondroitin- 6 -sulfotransferase- 1 showed sudden changes during the days of active progenitor migration as shown in time-lapse video recordings. Our results suggest a new mechanism by which tuning sulfation of perineuronal chondroitins confers sensitivity of early hindbrain motor neuron progenitors to directional cues in the extracellular environment and that the sulfation patterns of cell surface CS on neurons are modified to overcome the inhibition imposed by the environmental CS deposited. Our preliminary data also suggest the roles of 4 -and 6 -O-sulfated CS by modified by chondroitin- 4 -sulfotransferase- 2 and chondroitin- 6 -sulfotransferase- 1 in migrating neural precursors. published_or_final_versionBiomedical SciencesMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|Traumatic {{brain injury}} (TBI) {{is a major}} brain injury type {{commonly}} caused by traffic accidents, falls, violence, or sports injuries. To obtain mechanistic insights about TBI, experimental animal models such as weight-drop-induced TBI in rats {{have been developed to}} mimic closed-head injury in humans. However, the relationship between the mechanical impact level and neurological severity following weight-drop-induced TBI remains uncertain. In this study, we comprehensively investigated the relationship between physical impact and graded severity at various weight-drop heights. The acceleration, impact force, and displacement during the impact were accurately measured using an accelerometer, a pressure sensor, and a high-speed camera, respectively. In addition, the longitudinal changes in neurological deficits and balance function were investigated at 1, 4, and 7 days post TBI lesion. The inflammatory expression markers tested by Western blot analysis, including glial fibrillary <b>acidic</b> protein, beta-amyloid <b>precursor</b> protein, and bone marrow tyrosine kinase gene in chromosome X, in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and corpus callosum were investigated at 1 and 7 days post-lesion. Gradations in impact pressure produced progressive degrees of injury severity in the neurological score and balance function. Western blot analysis demonstrated that all inflammatory expression markers were increased at 1 and 7 days post-impact injury when compared to the sham control rats. The severity of neurologic dysfunction and induction in inflammatory markers strongly correlated with the graded mechanical impact levels. We conclude that the weight-drop-induced TBI model can produce graded brain injury and induction of neurobehavioral deficits and may have translational relevance to developing therapeutic strategies for TBI...|$|R
40|$|Hemagglutinin (HA) glycoproteins {{isolated}} from influenza virus caused hemolysis and liposome lysis at pH less than 6. 0. The pH dependence {{was similar to}} that of the parent virus. Hemagglutination and hemolysis titers of HA were comparable with those of virus. The time course of hemolysis by HA was somewhat different from that by virus. HA did not cause fusion of erythrocytes in acidic media, in contrast to virus. Both HA and virus, previously incubated at pH less than 6. 0, lost their low-pH-induced hemolytic activity. Isolated HA formed rosette-like structures at neutral pH, and these aggregated in acidic media. Virus also aggregated in acidic media and its envelope became leaky to negative stain. HA previously incubated at pH less than 6. 0 became susceptible to trypsin digestion. Both reversible and irreversible structural changes of HA were observed by fluorescence spectroscopy; a reversible change at a pH between neutral and 6. 4 and an irreversible one at pH less than 6. 0. Bromelain-released HA did not cause hemolysis and liposome lysis in <b>acidic</b> media. The <b>precursor</b> form of HA did not have hemolytic activity in acidic media. The similarity in pH dependence indicates that the structural change in HA induced at pH less than 6. 0 is the cause of activation and inactivation of hemolysis, HA and virus aggregation, and trypsin susceptibility. We propose that the hydrophobic NH 2 -terminal segment of HA 2 is exposed during the structural change and interacts with the target membranes, causing a permeability increase and leading to hemolysis and lysis. The virus-induced hemolysis can be ascribed for the most part to envelope fusion activated in acidic media...|$|R
40|$|The {{formulation}} of innovative transparent hydrorepellent coatings is strongly motivated {{in order to}} satisfy the market request and necessity to improve the cleanability of the sanitarywares. A lot of attention is devoted to the use of cheap precursors, low temperature synthesis process and industrial scalability potentiality. In this framework, in the present paper the set-up of the deposition of modified SiO 2 coatings on glazed ceramic supports by spraying technique was reported. Several solutions were formulated using as precursor tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) and co-precursor methyltriethoxysilane (MTES) in different molar ratios (i. e. 50 : 50, 25 : 75, 75 : 25), in suitable solvents and mixture of solvents (i. e. H 2 O, ethanol). The influence of the process parameters (i. e. precursors ratio, solvents, catalyser, annealing temperature) on the properties of the produced coatings was deeply investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), simultaneous thermogravimetric and differential analyses (TG–DTA), infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-Ray diffraction (XRD) and Vickers microhardness. Their hydrophobic behaviour was tested by the measurements of the static water contact angles and the chemical and stain resistance by the conformity to some tests of the standard UNI 4543. The obtained coatings were amorphous, homogeneous, uniform, thin (average thickness 300 nm), crack-free, leading to an improved hardness value of the glazed ceramic support (4. 47 GPa vs 3. 68 GPa for the coated and uncoated substrates, respectively), and allowed to improve both the hydrophobic behaviour and the chemical and stains resistance of the glazed sanitaryware supports, {{on the basis of the}} standard UNI 4543. The best hydrophobic performances were revealed in the case of coatings prepared starting from <b>acidic</b> catalysis derived <b>precursor</b> solutions. Moreover, the highest water contact angle values were detected for lower temperatures annealing, due to the methyl groups preservation, in agreement with the FT-IR and TG–DTA findings...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, or GHB, is a {{substance}} naturally present within mammal species. Properties of neurotransmitter or neuromodulator are generally given to this substance. GHB is therapeutically {{used as an}} anesthetic, but {{can be used for}} criminal offenses (date-rape drug). It appears that the window of detection of GHB is very short in both blood and urine, and therefore its presence is very difficult to prove after a rape case. In order to document single exposure, we investigated the use of hair. Hair was collected one month after the allegated event in order to sample the corresponding period after regular growing. After rapid (2 min) decontamination with dichloromethane, the hair shaft was cut into 3 -mm segments. They were overnight incubated in 0. 01 N NaOH in the presence of GHB-d 6, followed by neutralization and extraction in ethyl acetate under <b>acidic</b> conditions. GHB (<b>precursor</b> ion m/z 233, product ions m/z 147 and 148) was tested by GC/MS/MS (Finnigan TSQ 700) after derivatization with BSTFA � 1 % TMCS. Physiological concentrations (n � 24) were in the range 0. 5 to 12. 0 ng/mg, with no influence due to hair color. No variation of concentrations was observed along the hair shaft in controlled subjects, except for the proximal segment, due to an incorporation through sweat. This demonstrates that endogenous levels for each single subject are constant during hair growth. A controlled human administration of 25 mg/kg to a volunteer demonstrated that a single exposure to GHB is detectable in hair after segmentation. In a case of rape under influence, a clear increase of the corresponding segment (about 2. 4 ng/mg) in time was observed, in comparison with the other segments (0. 6 to 0. 8 ng/mg). This study demonstrates that a single exposure to GHB in a case of sexual assault can be documented by hair analysis when collected about one month after the crime...|$|R
40|$|Two {{series of}} Rh/spinel {{catalysts}} supported on alumina were prepd. {{for use in}} prodn. of H for fuel use. In the first series, magnesium, nickel, and aluminum nitrates were co-impregnated over gamma-alumina beads (200 m 2 g- 1), dried, and further calcined at 1000 ° to obtain MgxNi 1 -xAl 2 O 4 (x = 0 - 1) /Al 2 O 3 supports (~ 100 m 2 g- 1). These supports were impregnated with aq. solns. of Rh nitrate to obtain 0. 1 - 0. 2 % Rh catalysts. The second series was obtained by coating alumina beads with Mg acetate, drying and calcining at 1000 °. The MgAl 2 O 4 spinel was formed by solid-solid reaction between magnesia and alumina. MgAl 2 O 4 was impregnated with Rh salts (nitrate, chloride, acetate) to obtain 0. 2 - 0. 8 % Rh loading. Supports and catalysts were characterized by BET area, pore vol., x-ray diffraction, TEM and SEM, CO 2 chemisorption (basicity), and dimethyl- 3, 3 -but- 1 -ene isomerization (acidity). Rh dispersion was measured by H 2 chemisorption. The second series of catalysts was also characterized by FTIR of adsorbed lutidine and DRIFT. The activity of the catalysts was evaluated in ethanol steam reforming at 700 ° under 1 or 11 atm (H 2 O/ethanol molar ratio of 4, space velocity 24, 000 h- 1). Acidity and basicity of the catalysts are crucial for control of selectivity for ethylene or acetaldehyde. To avoid ethylene formation, which leads to significant carbonaceous deposits, all acidic sites should be neutralized. The effects of precursor of support and catalyst were studied. The second prepn. method gave less acidic materials with high performances (activity and stability) in the ethanol steam reforming reaction. The morphol. of the support, with a Mg-deficient spinel layer (thickness of about 8 - 9 nm) intimately covering all of the alumina grains (around 40 nm in size), can explain the neutralization of most <b>acidic</b> sites.

Six new precursors were synthesized for cadmium and lead sulfide each, by {{the reaction of the}} appropriate metal acetate with picolinic (HPic), 2, 6 -dipicolinic (H 2 dipic) or salicylic acid (H 2 sal) followed by the addition of thiourea (th) or thiosemicarbazide (ths). The precursors for CdS are [Cd(Hsal) 2 (tu) 2] (Cd 1 a), [Cd(Hsal) 2 (ths) 2]·nH 2 O (Cd 1 b), [Cd(pic) 2 (tu) 2]· 0. 5 H 2 O (Cd 2 a), [Cd(pic) 2 (ths) 2]· 2 H 2 O (Cd 2 b), [Cd(dipic) (tu) 2] (Cd 3 a) and [Cd(dipic) (ths) 2 (H 2 O) ]· 2 H 2 O (Cd 3 b) and the precursors for PbS are [Pb(Hsal) 2 (th) 2] (Pb 1 a), [Pb(Hsal) 2 (ths) 2] (Pb 1 b), [Pb(pic) 2 (th) 2] (Pb 2 a), [Pb(pic) 2 (ths) 2] (Pb 2 b), [Pb(dipic) (th) (H 2 O) ] 2 · 2 H 2 O (Pb 3 a) and [Pb(dipic) (ths) 2]·H 2 O (Pb 3 b). All of the compounds were characterized spectroscopically and by elemental analysis. Cd 1 a, Cd 2 a, Cd 2 b, Cd 3 a, Cd 3 b, Pb 2 b Pb 3 a and Pb 3 b formed well-defined crystals and were characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The precursors were decomposed at or around 170 °C using n-cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), sodium dodecylsulphate (SDS), ethylenediamine, oleic acid, oleylamine, trioctylamine or hexadecylamine as surfactants. Systematic variations of surfactants gave small spherical nanoparticles, micro-sized flowers, multipods and nanorods for CdS and nanocubes, truncated nanocubes, hexapods, octahedrons and dendritic stars for PbS. From XRPD studies it was found that most of the CdS nanostructures were of the stable hexagonal phase. However, in two cases the nanostructures were found to be predominantly of a metastable orthorhombic phase. For PbS system, all the decompositions yielded pure crystalline galena. For CdS system, TEM studies revealed planar defects (such as polysynthetic and multiplet twinning) in the nanocrystals, which gave an explanation for mechanism of growth. For PbS system, in order to elucidate the effect of single source precursors on the mechanism of growth of nanoparticles, the decomposition results were compared with PbS nanostructures synthesized from multiple-source precursors, lead acetate and thiourea or thiosemicarbazide. It was found that in the reactions of multiple source <b>precursors,</b> <b>acidic</b> components in the reaction mixture (oleic acid, acetic acid) led to etching and crystal splitting, which {{played a crucial role in}} the formation of anisotropic nanostructures...|$|R
