5|$|In {{the late}} {{afternoon}} of 3 May, the niece {{of the woman who}} lived directly above the McCanns was sitting on her aunt's balcony, when she saw a man leave through the gate below, as though he had come out of a ground-floor apartment. What caught her attention was that he looked around before shutting the gate quietly, with both hands. At 14:30 two blonde-haired men were seen on the balcony of 5C, an empty apartment two doors from 5A. At 16:00–17:00 a blonde-haired man was seen near 5A. At 18:00 the same or another blonde-haired man was seen in the stairwell of the McCanns' block. At 23:00, after the disappearance, two blonde-haired men were seen in a nearby street speaking in raised voices. When they realized they had been noticed, they reportedly lowered their voices <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{first known}} victim {{linked to the}} Michigan Murderer was a 19-year-old Eastern Michigan University {{accounting}} student named Mary Terese Fleszar, who was last seen alive {{on the evening of}} July 9, 1967, by a neighbor walking towards her Ypsilanti apartment.

25|$|In 1955 a fictionalised {{version of}} the story was told in the film The Cockleshell Heroes made by Warwick Films, and {{starring}} Anthony Newley, Trevor Howard, Christopher Lee, David Lodge and Jose Ferrer who was also the director. This 1955 ﬁlm was a box office hit in 1956 and was quickly followed by the publication of Brigadier C. E. Lucas Phillips book of the same name. 'Blondie' Hasler had connections with both the ﬁlm and the book. He hated the title of both <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>away</b> from his role as technical adviser for the former to try and set the matter right in the latter.|$|E
25|$|Election in 2004 {{took place}} on 13 June 2004, {{together}} with {{the second round of}} the presidential election, resulting in a relatively high turnout of 48%. As with later elections, the election campaign in 2004 centered around domestic issues and not European policies, and populist parties featured prominently. The election was a disappointment for the governing Social Democrats, who received only 2 of the 13 seats, and their partners in the government, New Union (Social Liberals), who failed to win a seat. The biggest winners in the election were the populist Labor Party, who contested their first national election <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>away</b> with 5 seats in the European Parliament.|$|E
25|$|The Sooners ventured 90 {{miles east}} to Tulsa {{to take on}} the Golden Hurricane and their new coach, Todd Graham.

The Sooners last played the Conference USA-affiliated Golden Hurricane in 2005 in Norman <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>away</b> with a 31–15 victory. Oklahoma and Tulsa first played in 1914 and had played 22times with the Sooners leading the series, 14-7-1. Tulsa was led by senior quarterback Paul Smith who some considered the best quarterback in the state of Oklahoma, despite the early talk of Sam Bradford's Heisman chances. On September 17, 2007, the Sooners were favored to win by 20points.|$|E

25|$|A dismal New Zealand tour later, Kapil Dev {{was ready}} for the 1981–82 home series against England where his five-wicket haul won the first test at Wankhede Stadium, Bombay. Kapil scored 318 runs (Average: 53, 1 century, 1 fifty) and took 22 wickets (2 5-wicket hauls) <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>away</b> with the Man of the Series honours. England saw more of Kapil in the ensuing series at home against the Indian cricket team in the 1982 season when he opened with a 5-wicket haul and 130 runs in a losing cause at Lord's. Kapil Dev {{finished}} the 3-match series with 292 runs (Ave: 73, 3 fifties) and 10 Wickets and bagged the Man of the Series again.|$|E
25|$|Islamic {{tradition}} {{states that}} the Zamzam Well was revealed to Hajra, the second wife of Abraham and mother of Ishmael. By the instruction of God, Abraham left {{his wife and son}} at a spot in the desert <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>away.</b> She was desperately seeking water for her infant son, but she could not find any, as Mecca is located in a hot dry valley with few sources of water. Hajra ran seven times {{back and forth in the}} scorching heat between the two hills of Safa and Marwah, looking for water. Getting thirstier by the second, the infant Ishmael scraped the land with his feet, where suddenly water sprang out. There are other versions of the story involving God sending his angel, Gabriel (Jibra'il), who kicked the ground with his heel (or wing), and the water rose. A similar story about a well is also mentioned in the Bible.|$|E
25|$|Later in 1972, Sammartino {{was asked}} back by McMahon Sr. {{to regain the}} title. After refusing McMahon's initial offer, Sammartino was offered a {{percentage}} of all the gates when he wrestled and a decreased work schedule that only included major arenas. Soon after, Sammartino and then champion Pedro Morales teamed up {{for a series of}} tag team matches. In a televised match, Professor Tanaka blinded both men with salt and they were maneuvered into fighting each other. When their eyes cleared, they kept fighting each other. Two weeks later, all syndicated wrestling shows in the WWWF showed a clip of Sammartino and Morales signing a contract for a title match at Shea Stadium. When McMahon gestured for them to shake hands, both wordlessly turned <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>away.</b> On September 1, 1972, Sammartino and Morales wrestled to a 65-minute draw at Shea Stadium in New York.|$|E

25|$|When he was young, Dian Wei once {{agreed to}} help a certain Liu family in Xiangyi (襄邑) take revenge by killing Li Yong (李永), a man from Suiyang (睢陽). Li Yong was {{formerly}} the Chief (長) of Fuchun County (富春縣), {{and he was very}} cautious about his personal protection. Dian Wei disguised himself as a marquis and travelled to Li Yong's house in a carriage filled with food and wine. He entered the house without challenge, stabbed Li with a concealed dagger, and killed Li's wife as well. He then left the house and retrieved his weapons (a sword and a ji) from the carriage <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>away.</b> As Li Yong lived near the marketplace, news of his death spread quickly and the whole town was shocked. Hundreds of men went to pursue the murderer but none of them dared to approach Dian Wei. After travelling four or five li on foot, Dian Wei met his companions and they escaped after a brief fight with the pursuers. Dian Wei became recognised as a hero after that incident.|$|E
25|$|Among the few {{revisions}} Devil's Due instituted was {{the expansion}} of Cobra Commander's origin. After his brother's death, the future Commander sought out the surviving son of the family killed by Dan. He found the soldier (Snake Eyes) at a bar, where the Commander saved him from an oncoming truck and the two became friends. They traveled from state to state, acting as vigilantes. One night, Cobra Commander took Snake Eyes {{to the house of}} a corrupt Judge who he blamed for the hardships they had both experienced: years before, the judge had presided over a case involving Cobra Commander's brother Dan, who ran a veteran's hospital. The hospital had been burned down by a patient, but the judge ruled that it was insurance fraud; Dan lost everything and turned to drinking, which led to the crash that took his life and the lives of Snake Eyes' family. Realizing where his anger had taken him, Snake Eyes refused to kill the man <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>away.</b> Cobra Commander killed the judge himself and vowed revenge against Snake Eyes for having turned on him.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{aircraft}}'s many faults, {{only two}} {{were lost in}} accidents. The seventh aircraft (38-492) was on its final test flight from the Buffalo factory prior to delivery to the Air Corps when pilot John Strickler, a Bell pilot and engineer/co-pilot Brian Sparks, who was Bell's chief test pilot at the time, encountered problems recovering from a deliberate spin attempt {{which was part of}} the test flight profile. Despite every effort to emerge from the spin, the aircraft would not respond, and it appeared that the rudder had locked. Co-pilot Sparks shut down the engines and waited for the propellers to come to a stop before bailing out. Because of the tandem seating, it was necessary for Sparks to exit the aircraft first, and in doing so he struck the empennage, breaking his legs — and in the process, freeing the rudder. Strickler decided to stay with the aircraft and attempt an emergency landing. By this time, the aircraft had lost sufficient altitude that there was not time to restart the engines. Strickler put the Airacuda down hard in a farmer's field, <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>away</b> unhurt. The Airacuda was so badly damaged it had to be scrapped.|$|E

25|$|Bancroft {{was first}} capped on 1 February 1890 against Scotland as a {{replacement}} for the injured Tommy England. Bancroft would play 33 times for his country, all consecutively, a record that would lay unbroken until Ken Jones did so in 1954. Although Bancroft would only win two out of his first nine Welsh games, {{he was part of the}} Wales team that won their first Triple Crown in 1893. The first game of that season saw Wales face England at the Cardiff Arms Park. With little time left to play and Wales losing 9–11, they were awarded a penalty near touch, 30 yards from the England goal line. The Welsh captain, Arthur Gould called Bancroft over and told him to kick (from the ground) for goal. Bancroft insisted on dropping for goal, but Gould forbade it. The two began arguing in front of the home crowd, until in frustration Gould threw the ball to the ground <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>away.</b> Bancroft successfully kicked the drop goal which would win the match for Wales. This penalty goal although dropped by Bancroft was still awarded as such, and was rugby's first ever penalty goal.|$|E
25|$|On the 10 January 2011 {{episode of}} Raw, Gabriel and Slater {{refused to take}} part in new Nexus leader CM Punk's {{initiation}} <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>away</b> from the group. The following day, at the tapings of the 14 January 2011 episode of SmackDown, Gabriel and Slater helped former leader Barrett and Ezekiel Jackson attack Big Show. The following week, Gabriel, Slater, Barrett, and Jackson announced they had formed The Corre, and later that night Gabriel defeated World Heavyweight Champion Edge in a non-title match, following interference from the other members of The Corre. After winning a non-title match against the champions Kozlov and Marella on 4 February episode of SmackDown, Gabriel and Slater received a match for the WWE Tag Team Championship two weeks later, but lost via disqualification when the other members of The Corre interfered. They received a rematch at the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view on 20 February and defeated Marella and Kozlov to win the WWE Tag Team Championship for the second time. The following night on Raw, Gabriel and Slater lost the championship to John Cena and The Miz, but won the championship back minutes later after Barrett invoked The Corre's rematch clause, and The Miz turned on Cena. During this time, The Corre had continued to feud with The Big Show, and at WrestleMania XXVII in April the team of The Big Show, Kane, Santino Marella, and Kofi Kingston defeated The Corre. At the 19 April taping of SmackDown, the duo of Gabriel and Slater lost the Tag Team Championship to the team of Kane and The Big Show. In a backstage segment following the match, Gabriel was attacked by Slater, who thought Gabriel blamed him for their loss. On the 6 May episode of SmackDown, Gabriel, Barrett, and Slater attacked Jackson, removing him from the group. The three remaining members of The Corre feuded with Jackson until the 10 June episode of SmackDown, when Barrett walked out on Gabriel and Slater during a six-man tag team match against Jackson and the Usos, causing Gabriel and Slater to proclaim the end of The Corre. Gabriel continued to ally himself with Slater despite the dissolution of The Corre, and the duo began a feud with The Usos. On the 17 June episode of SmackDown, Gabriel and Slater were defeated by The Usos, but defeated them in a rematch the following week. They were again defeated by The Usos on the 8 July episode of SmackDown, resulting in the pair arguing in the ring. The following week, their team was ended when they faced off in a match won by Gabriel and Gabriel transitioned to a face (fan favourite) character.|$|E
