At the base of the mesometrial triangle they were restricted to the cellular sheaths of the <b>arterial</b> <b>channels</b> supplying the chorio-allantoic placenta and were not diffusely distributed throughout the mesometrial triangle.

40|$|Like {{other species}} with haemochorial placentation, {{pregnant}} rats show marked {{invasion of the}} uterine wall by trophoblast. While an endovascular pathway of invasion has been recognized for a long time, only recently, by application of cytokeratin immunostaining, {{the existence of an}} interstitial pathway of invasion has been established. Interstitial invasion is mainly effected by glycogen cell-like trophoblast arising from glycogen cell islands of the trophospongium opening up into the decidua, and from glycogen cell sheaths surrounding the intraplacental maternal <b>arterial</b> <b>channels</b> which are connected with the spiral arteries in decidua and mesometrial triangle. Quantitative evaluation of interstitial invasion in both maternal compartments was carried out on days 15 - 21, using PAS staining and cytokeratin and alpha-actin immunostaining for detecting trophoblast and defining maternal tissue compartments. Measurements of compartment size, cytokeratin-positive areas and invasion extent were performed using the KS 400 image analysis system. A distinct pattern of interstitial trophoblast invasion emerged, starting from central decidual areas around the maternal <b>arterial</b> <b>channels,</b> and mushrooming into the mesometrial triangle reaching a peak at day 18, followed by gradual regression of the invaded areas. These measurements may serve as a basis for further experiments to evaluate factors which may influence the depth of trophoblast invasion. status: publishe...|$|R

30|$|In {{the present}} rare case of rupture of {{secondary}} hepatic lymphoma, systemic malignant lymphoma {{was diagnosed as}} a result of hepatic tumor rupture. The cause of the tumor rupture might include bleeding from <b>arterial</b> <b>channels</b> coursing through the hypo-enhancing tumor, which was demonstrated by the existence of intratumoral extravasation of contrast medium on contrast-enhanced CT. The mechanisms of tumor rupture in the present case of malignant lymphoma might be the same as those of HCC rupture resulting from initial bleeding within the tumor due to impairment of the vascular integrity and the subsequent sudden increase in pressure within the tumor followed by bursting through the tumor capsule. Although clinical diagnosis before treatment was ruptured HCC and the treatment strategy applied was similar for HCC, the addition of chemotherapy for malignant lymphoma after surgery contributed to good patient prognosis.|$|R
30|$|Tsutani et al. {{suggested}} {{that one of}} the reasons for the low incidence of rupture of malignant lymphoma might be its hypo-vascularity [4]. Majority of hepatic lymphoma lesions demonstrate minimal to no enhancement on all the phases of contrast-enhanced CT. Enhancement, when present, is characteristically less than the surrounding hepatic parenchyma [10, 11]. However, <b>arterial</b> <b>channels</b> can often be seen coursing through the hypo-enhancing tumor [2]. The other pattern on contrast-enhanced CT is target-like appearance, that is, peripheral enhancement with a central non-enhancement, mimicking intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma or metastatic liver cancer [11, 12]. In our case, ruptured tumor was hypo-enhancing with extravasation of contrast medium within the tumor on contrast-enhanced CT. Although the hypo-vascularity is not likely to be the ruptured HCC, clinical diagnosis of ruptured HCC was made, suggesting that the hypo-vascularity might depend on the intratumoral hematoma due to hemorrhage or spastic changes of the feeding arteries after bleeding.|$|R
40|$|Implantation in {{the beaver}} is {{superficial}} and antimesometrial. The embryonic disc occupies {{one side of}} the flattened mesometrial hemisphere of the large blastocyst. An endometrial papilla, unique to the beaver, forms on the mesometrial uterine wall just prior to chorioallantoic contact. The reniform placenta then develops around this papilla. Amniogenesis is by folding. A transient choriovitelline placenta develops very early. Yolk sac inversion is late, and the bilaminar omphalopleure is partially retained throughout gestation. The chorion persists until term as two paraplacental membranes. A large permanent allantoic vesicle is present. The labyrinthine placenta has a lobulate architecture. It possesses a hemodichorial barrier, the inner layer being syncytial and the outer cellular. Maternal blood is supplied by two <b>arterial</b> <b>channels</b> which do not penetrate the labyrinth, and is drained by a single, central venous channel. A large basal subplacenta develops by trophoblastic invasion of the endometrial papilla, and becomes quite massive at term. Its function is unknown. Except for this specialized subplacenta, all the fetal membrane characteristics are typical of the primitive sciuromorph group, to which the Castoridae seem to be closely related...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary concern}} of {{agricultural}} drainage engineers is, as {{reflected by the}} contents of this Monograph, the control of water table conditions within an area of crop production. However, as concern about environmental impacts continues to grow, {{it is becoming increasingly}} important to be aware that agricultural effects may extend beyond the boundary of a field or a farm. Thus, drainage will inevitably affect the pattern of water flows from the land and into the receiving watercourses. It is these `downstream' or `offsite' impacts of farmland drainage on the timing and magnitude of flows which are considered in this Chapter. The impacts of drainage on flows may be considered at two scales: the individual field outfall, where discharge can be related directly to conditions in the field (water table height, soil type, drain spacing etc), and at the river catchment scale, where not only the distributed effects of the drained areas must be integrated, but also the role of improvements to the main (<b>arterial)</b> <b>channels</b> must be considered...|$|R
40|$|IT is {{well known}} that the {{arterial}} pressure in the arms in cases of con-genital stenosis at the isthmus of the aorta is frequently higher than the normal. This is so often the case, that the impression is more or less cur-rent that hypertension in the arms is a necessary part of the diagnostic pic-ture, and that investigation of all cases of hypertension will lead to recogni-tion of all cases of isthmus stenosis. Gossage M has said: " No doubt in these cases the blood pressure is always high, so as to overcome the difficulty of getting the blood through the narrow <b>arterial</b> <b>channels.</b> " Lewis, 57 re-ferring to instances of slight constriction and to cases of coarctation com-plicated by cardiac embarrassment, is of the opinion that " if we note these cases as natural exceptions then it is true to state that most cases, perhaps all uncomplicated cases, of coarctation of the aorta of the adult type present high blood pressure; the statement applies to both systolic and to so-called diastolic readings.

40|$|Abstract Background The paca is a South American rodent with {{potential}} as a commercial food animal. We examined paca placenta {{as part of a}} wider effort to understand the reproductive biology of this species. Methods Thirteen specimens between midgestation and term of pregnancy were studied by light and transmission electron microscopy. Results The placenta is divided into several lobes separated by interlobular trophoblast. Maternal <b>arterial</b> <b>channels</b> and fetal veins are found at the centre of each lobe. In the labyrinth, maternal blood flows through trophoblast-lined lacunae in close proximity to the fetal capillaries. The interhaemal barrier is of the haemomonochorial type with a single layer of syncytiotrophoblast. Caveolae occur in the apical membrane of the syncytiotrophoblast and recesses in the basal membrane, but {{there is no evidence of}} transtrophoblastic channels. The interlobular areas consist of cords of syncytiotrophoblast defining maternal blood channels that drain the labyrinth. Yolk sac endoderm covers much of the fetal surface of the placenta. The subplacenta comprises cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast. There are dilated intercellular spaces between the cytotrophoblasts and lacunae lined by syncytiotrophoblast. In the junctional zone between subplacenta and decidua, there are nests of multinucleated giant cells with vacuolated cytoplasm. The entire placenta rests on a pedicle of maternal tissue. An inverted yolk sac placenta is also present. The presence of small vesicles and tubules in the apical membrane of the yolk sac endoderm and larger vesicles in the supranuclear region suggest that the yolk sac placenta participates in maternal-fetal transfer of protein. Conclusion The paca placenta closely resembles that of other hystricomorph rodents. The lobulated structure allows for a larger exchange area and the development of precocial young. </p...|$|R
40|$|T H E {{advent of}} {{arteriosclerosis}} {{is one of}} the inevitable consequences of aging. The existence of arteriosclerosis in one or another part of the vas-cular tree after the age of 30 is to be expected. Its rate of progression and its predilection for certain special <b>arterial</b> <b>channels</b> are factors which influence profoundly the problem of longevity. It is apparent, also, that the anatomic distribution of the sclerotic process in relation to the arterial wall itself is an important consideration in determining the seriousness of the disease. Thus, the'intimal lesion affecting the medium-sized muscular arteries (coronary, cerebral and tibial) gains special prominence because of the likelihood of formation of secondary thrombi, with diminution and later obliteration of the lumens of such medium-sized muscular arteries. Neither the Monckeberg type of sclerosis nor, indeed, the intimal lesions of the larger elastic arteries possess the same potentialities for vascular occlusion. There are no doubt many factors which may influence the rate and extent of arteriosclerosis but our knowledge is, at best, inadequate to explain the phenomena which initiate arteriosclerosis or those which accelerate its prog-ress. The one factor which has received widespread consideration as a con-tributory cause to arteriosclerosis is diabetes mellitus. The recent survey of the incidence of coronary sclerosis among diabetic and nondiabetic patients carried out by Root, Bland, Gordon and White * again emphasizes this fact. The postinsulin era offers especially valuable subject material for analysis. Indeed, the introduction of insulin has created a fascinating biologic ex-periment, inasmuch as the diabetic patient now lives longer not only with his diabetes but also with his arteriosclerosis...|$|R

40|$|Since, in {{addition}} to its growth-promoting actions, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) has rapid vasoactive actions, we investigated the effects of IGF-I on whole-cell ATP-sensitive K+ (K-ATP) currents of rat mesenteric arterial smooth muscle cells. IGF-I (10 or 30 nM) reduced K-ATP currents activated by pinacidil or a membrane permeant cAMP analogue. Inhibition of phospholipase C, protein kinase C, protein kinase A, mitogen-activated protein kinase or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) did not prevent the action of IGF-I. However, inhibition of K-ATP currents by IGF-I was abolished by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein or the phosphoinositide 3 -kinase inhibitors, LY 294002 and wortmannin. Intracellular application of either phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate (PIP- 2) or phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (PIP- 3) increased the K-ATP current activated by pinacidil and abolished the inhibitory effect of IGF-I.

40|$|There is {{abundant}} landscape evidence for extensive land reclamation conducted within the Shannon estuary wetlands. To date, little published research is available which identifies how much reclamation has occurred, its timing and the likely environmental implications. This paper addresses these {{questions on the}} basis of available cartographic and documentary data on land reclamation in this area. Identification of reclaimed land was based on the 2 nd Edition Ordnance Survey of Ireland Map Series of 1924. These maps represent landscape features relating to reclamation, such as embankments, artificial <b>arterial</b> drainage <b>channels</b> and sluices.

In total, approximately 6, 500 ha of the Shannon estuary lowlands were reclaimed for agriculture and other purposes. This has significantly altered the morphometric characteristics of the estuary, as embankments and revetments for flood protection have reduced the potential energy dissipation area and the water storage capacity of the estuarine wetlands.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the role and regulation of <b>arterial</b> K+ <b>channels</b> during postnatal development. Rat thoracic aortic segments were suspended for isometric tension and resting membrane potential (RMP) recording. Contraction in response to 4 -aminopyridine (4 -AP) was similar in 4 -, 8 - and 12 -week-old rats but was higher in 1 -day-old rats. Contraction in response to tetraethylammonium (TEA) increased after 4 weeks. TEA increased the contractions evoked by noradrenaline in the aorta from 8 - and 12 -week-old rats but not from 1 -day- and 4 -week-old rats. RMP did not change during development. Patch-clamp studies of freshly isolated smooth muscle cells from the same aortas bathed in Ca 2 +-free medium showed a voltage-dependent K+ current (IK) sensitive to 4 -AP. This current remained stable at all ages whereas the density of the total IK, recorded in the presence of Ca 2 +, showed a twofold increase between 4 and 8 weeks. This current was highly sensitive to TEA and charybdotoxin. The binding site density of 125 I-labelled charybdotoxin was threefold higher in the membranes of aortas from 12 -week-old compared to 4 -week-old rats. These results indicate that changes in K+ channel distribution occur in the rat aorta during postnatal development. These are related to an increase in the expression of charybdotoxin-sensitive Ca 2 +-activated K+ channels...|$|R

Step increases in intraluminal pressure of cannulated cerebral arteries induced myogenic constriction and concomitant formation of superoxide (O 2 (. -)) and its dismutation product hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) as determined by fluorescent HPLC analysis, microscopic analysis of intensity of dihydroethidium fluorescence and attenuation of pressure-induced myogenic constriction by pretreatment with the ROS scavenger 4,hydroxyl- 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethylpiperidine 1 -oxyl (tempol) or Mito-tempol or MitoQ in {{the presence or absence of}} PEG-catalase.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} local nitroglycerin on the viable area of a prefabricated flap for vascular implant in rats, and to investigate the surgical delay procedure. METHODS: A femoral pedicle was implanted under {{the skin of the}} abdominal wall in forty Wistar rats. The animals were divided into four groups of ten: group 1 - without surgical delay procedure and local nitroglycerin; group 2 - with surgical delay procedure, but without local nitroglycerin; group 3 - without surgical delay procedure, but with local nitroglycerin; and group 4 - with simultaneous surgical delay procedure and local nitroglycerin. The percentages of the viable areas, in relation to the total flap, were calculated using AutoCAD R 14. RESULTS: The mean percentage value of the viable area was 8. 9 % in the group 1. 49. 4 % in the group 2; 8. 4 % in the group 3 and 1. 1 % in the group 4. There was significant difference between groups 1 and 2 (p= 0. 005), 1 and 4 (p= 0. 024), 2 and 3 (p= 0. 003), 2 and 4 (p= 0. 001).

40|$|Mechano-gated ion {{channels}} are implicated {{in a variety}} of neurosensory functions ranging from touch sensitivity to hearing. In the heart, rhythm disturbance subsequent to mechanical effects is also associated with the activation of stretch-sensitive ion <b>channels.</b> <b>Arterial</b> autoregulation in response to hemodynamic stimuli, a vital process required for protection against hypertension-induced injury, is similarly dependent on the activity of force-sensitive ion channels. Seminal work in prokaryotes and invertebrates, including the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the fruit fly drosophila, greatly helped to identify the molecular basis of volume regulation, hearing and touch sensitivity. In mammals, more recent findings have indicated that members of several structural family of ion channels, namely the transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, the amiloride-sensitive ENaC/ASIC channels and the potassium channels K(2 P) and K(ir) are involved in cellular mechanotransduction.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor {{responses}} in the rat middle cerebral artery are blocked by inhibiting IKCa channels alone, contrasting with peripheral vessels where block of both IKCa and SKCa is required. As the contribution of IKCa and SKCa to endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization differs in peripheral arteries, depending {{on the level of}} arterial constriction, we investigated the possibility that SKCa might contribute to equivalent hyperpolarization in cerebral arteries under certain conditions. METHODS: Rat middle cerebral arteries (approximately 175 microm) were mounted in a wire myograph. The effect of KCa channel blockers on endothelium-dependent responses to the protease-activated receptor 2 agonist, SLIGRL (20 micromol/L), were then assessed as simultaneous changes in tension and membrane potential. These data were correlated with the distribution of <b>arterial</b> KCa <b>channels</b> revealed with immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: SLIGRL hyperpolarized and relaxed cerebral arteries undergoing variable levels of stretch-induced tone. The relaxation was unaffected by specific inhibitors of IKCa (TRAM- 34, 1 micromol/L) or SKCa (apamin, 50 nmol/L) alone or in combination. In contrast, the associated smooth-muscle hyperpolarization was inhibited, but only with these blockers in combination. Blocking nitric oxide synthase (NOS) or guanylyl cyclase evoked smooth-muscle depolarization and constriction, with both hyperpolarization and relaxation to SLIGRL being abolished by TRAM- 34 alone, whereas apamin had no effect. Immunolabeling showed SKCa and IKCa within the endothelium. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of NO, IKCa underpins endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization and relaxation in cerebral arteries. However, when NOS is active SKCa contributes to hyperpolarization, whatever the extent of background contraction. These changes may have relevance in vascular disease states where NO release is compromised and when the levels of SKCa expression may be altered...|$|R
40|$|Exchange {{proteins}} directly {{activated by}} cyclic AMP (Epacs or cAMP-GEF) represent {{a family of}} novel cAMP-binding effector proteins. The identification of Epacs and the recent development of pharmacological tools that discriminate between cAMP-mediated pathways have revealed previously unrecognized roles for cAMP that are independent of its traditional target cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Here we show that Epac exists in a complex with vascular ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel subunits and that cAMP-mediated activation of Epac modulates KATP channel activity via a Ca 2 +-dependent mechanism involving the activation of Ca 2 +-sensitive protein phosphatase 2 B (PP- 2 B, calcineurin). Application of the Epac-specific cAMP analogue 8 -pCPT- 2 ′-O-Me-cAMP, at concentrations that activate Epac but not PKA, caused a 41. 6 ± 4. 7 % inhibition (mean ±s. e. m.; n= 7) of pinacidil-evoked whole-cell KATP currents recorded in isolated rat aortic smooth muscle cells. Importantly, similar results were obtained when cAMP was elevated by addition of the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin {{in the presence of}} the structurally distinct PKA inhibitors, Rp-cAMPS or KT 5720. Activation of Epac by 8 -pCPT- 2 ′-O-Me-cAMP caused a transient 171. 0 ± 18. 0 nm (n= 5) increase in intracellular Ca 2 + in Fura- 2 -loaded aortic myocytes, which persisted in the absence of extracellular Ca 2 +. Inclusion of the Ca 2 +-specific chelator BAPTA in the pipette-filling solution or preincubation with the calcineurin inhibitors, cyclosporin A or ascomycin, significantly reduced the ability of 8 -pCPT- 2 ′-O-Me-cAMP to inhibit whole-cell KATP currents.

IMID- 4 F (30 [*]μM) {{did not affect the}} vasorelaxation response to sodium nitroprusside (SNP). In rat mesenteric artery smooth muscle cells IMID- 4 F (1 – 10 [*]μM) caused a concentration-dependent depolarization of membrane potential. IMID- 4 F (10 [*]μM) abolished the hyperpolarizing effects of levcromakalim (10 [*]μM). In patch clamp experiments using rat mesenteric artery smooth muscle cells, KATP channel currents induced by levcromakalim (10 [*]μM) were inhibited by IMID- 4 F (0. 3 – 3 [*]μM) in a concentration-dependent manner. The calculated IC 50 for IMID- 4 F inhibiting KATP channel current was approximately 0. 8 [*]μM. Radioligand binding studies using bovine aortic smooth muscle cell membranes showed that IMID- 4 F (30 [*]μM) did not displace binding to the KATP channel opener [3 H]-P 1075. However, both levcromakalim (10 [*]μM) and glibenclamide (10 [*]μM) caused significant displacement of [3 H]-P 1075. These studies show that the imidazoline compound IMID- 4 F {{is one of the most}} potent antagonists of <b>arterial</b> KATP <b>channels</b> identified. Vasorelaxation, hyperpolarization and K+ currents through KATP channels were all inhibited by IMID- 4 F at micromolar concentrations. Radioligand binding studies indicate that IMID- 4 F does not bind to the same site as levcromakalim or as glibenclamide. Considering other evidence, it is likely that IMID- 4 F acts by interacting directly with the pore of the KIR channel, rather than through the sulphonylurea subunit of the KATP channel complex...|$|R

By light microscopy the brains of human embryos and fetuses {{ranging in size from}} 8. 5 to 70 mm crown-rump length have been studied in serial sections, usually of the whole embryo or fetus. In the smallest specimens the whole brain was encapsulated by a very dense vascular plexus.

40|$|Pressurization of {{isolated}} arteries {{may result in}} Ca(2 +) -dependent contraction and membrane depolarization. Because the open state probability of some vascular muscle K+ channels is augmented by rises in cytosolic Ca 2 + and membrane depolarization, we investigated the possibility that increases in intraluminal pressure activate K+ channels in isolated, perfused rat saphenous arteries. Stepwise increases in intraluminal pressure from 5 to 205 mm Hg resulted in increasing, active arterial contraction, measured as smaller diameters in physiological salt solution than in Ca(2 +) -free solution. Addition of 10 mM tetraethylammonium to the physiological salt solution to block <b>arterial</b> muscle K+ <b>channels</b> caused progressively greater diameter reductions at pressures above 25 mm Hg. Microelectrode measurements of membrane potential showed that tetraethylammonium depolarized arterial muscle more at 105 mm Hg (16 +/- 1 mV) than at 25 mm Hg (10 +/- 1 mV). The sensitivity of K+ current to tetraethylammonium was also demonstrated in patch-clamped vascular muscle cells from the same arteries. Peak whole-cell K+ current was suppressed 47 % and 79 % by 1 and 10 mM tetraethylammonium, respectively. This same current was enhanced 3. 6 -fold by the Ca 2 + ionophore A 23187 (10 microM), suggesting a Ca 2 + dependence. We conclude that increases in intraluminal pressure progressively activate tetraethylammonium-sensitive K+ <b>channels</b> in the <b>arterial</b> muscle membrane.

Case reportA 59 -year-old woman with a previously diagnosed Cognard Type IV dural arteriovenous fistula presented for transarterial embolization, performed outside the operating room, under total intravenous anesthesia. The procedure underwent without complications and the intraoperative angiography revealed complete obliteration of the fistula. In the early postoperative period, the patient presented with clinical signs of raised intracranial pressure attributable to a later diagnosed intraventricular hemorrhage, which conditioned placement of a ventricular drain, admission to an intensive care unit, cerebral vasospasm and a prolonged hospital stay. Throughout the perioperative period, there were no changes in the cerebral brain oximetry. The patient was discharged without neurological sequelae. ConclusionIntraventricular hemorrhage may be a serious complication after the endovascular treatment of dural arteriovenous fistula. A close postoperative surveillance and monitoring allow an early diagnosis and treatment which increases the odds for an improved outcome...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} aging on the contributions of NO and endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization (EDH) to endothelium-dependent relaxation in saphenous arteries {{of male and female}} C 57 BL/ 6 J mice aged 12, 34 and 64 weeks. Vasomotor responses of saphenous arteries were analysed by wire myography in the absence and presence of stimuli of the endothelium, inhibitors of NOS, and inhibitors and stimulants of small (KCa 2. 3) and intermediate (KCa 3. 1) conductance calcium-activated potassium <b>channels.</b> <b>Arterial</b> relaxing responses to sodium nitroprusside and to ACh in the absence of pharmacological inhibitors (indomethacin and L-NAME), were similar in all age groups and sexes, but those mediated by endothelium-derived NO were slightly but significantly increased in 64 -week-old male mice. In the presence of inhibitors, 12 -week-old animals showed pronounced ACh-induced relaxation, which was significantly reduced in 34 - and 64 -week-old mice of both sexes. The EDH-related component of ACh-induced relaxations was abolished by TRAM- 34 (KCa 3. 1 blocker) or UCL 1684 (KCa 2. 3 blocker). Although the maximal relaxation induced by NS 309 (KCa activator) was not affected by aging, the sensitivity for NS 309 significantly decreased with aging. The presence of SKA- 31 (KCa modulator) potentiated relaxations induced by ACh in arteries of 12 -week-old but not older mice. In a small muscular artery of mice of either sex, total endothelium-dependent relaxation is not affected by age. However, possibly due to changes in KCa channel function, the contribution of EDH to endothelium-dependent relaxations decreased with age. The contribution of endothelium-derived NO increases in old male mic...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: {{adaptation}} of saphenous vein to arterial flow may {{be critical to}} the results of bypass. The present paper summarizes work recently presented as a Hunterian Lecture. Work includes in vitro investigation of the response of saphenous vein endothelium to arterial flow and assessment of its clinical importance using a cohort of patients undergoing vein bypass surgery. Methods: freshly excised human saphenous vein segments were placed in an in vitro flow circuit to simulate arterial and venous flow conditions. Changes in the endothelial expression of proteins were assessed using a combination of immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. The role of ion channels in the changes seen induced by arterial flow in the saphenous vein endothelium was assessed by addition of ion channel blocking medication to the medium perfusing vein segments. A cohort of patients undergoing vein bypass surgery were followed to assess graft patency and the influence of prescribed medication on its outcome. Results: after arterial flow conditions, the staining area for the endothelial adhesin ICAM- 1 and nitric oxide synthase were increased, while that of the anticoagulant protein thrombomodulin was decreased. The concentration of the important stimulant of the clotting cascade tissue factor was unaffected by arterial flow. These changes were modulated by the addition of ion channel blocking drugs to the vein perfusate. In particular, nifedipine abolished the reduction in thrombomodulin, but increased the amount of tissue factor. In a series of 236 patients undergoing primary infra-inguinal vein grafts, prescription of calcium channel blocker was associated with improved primary patency. Conclusions: important changes in the venous endothelium are induced by <b>arterial</b> flow. Ion <b>channel</b> blocking drugs have the potential to modulate these responses...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{important}} meanings are given {{to the role of}} mesenteric lymph node as a peripheral immune organ in the formation of local and general immune reactions. Features of the mesenteric lymph nodes morphogenesis are not well understood due to the different functions of these organs [1, 2]. There is still no consensus on the initial stages of the mesenteric lymph nodes. Many authors attribute the histogenesis of lymph nodes with the development of the mesenteric lymph vessels [3, 8]. In other studies determinant role of these is given to blood vessels [5, 6, 7]. The discrepancy of views on the mesenteric lymph nodes early morphogenesis as well as a certain deficiency of works devoted to this problem require a comprehensive research of the mesenteric lymph nodes development with using of modern methods. The purpose: To study the features of human mesenteric lymph node development {{in the first half of}} the prenatal period of ontogeny. Materials and Methods: 19 mesentery of the human embryos and fetuses in 8 - 20 weeks of fetal development were investigated. Total film preparations and histological sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, resorcin-fuchsin by Weigert. Morphometric studies were carried out by S. B. Stefanov (1988). The research results: It was established that cells of the fibroblastic differon and cleft-like elements of vascular network are revealed in 8 - 9 weeks of fetal development in the loose connective tissue of the human small intestine, collagen and elastic fibers. Since the end of the 10 th week clearly visible blood vessels appear in the loose connective tissue of the mesentery, among them the units of the <b>arterial</b> and venous <b>channels</b> are found. Under the upper sheet of the mesothelium the large gaps are determined, which are the germs of the mesentery lymphatic network. In 10 - 11 week of the human embryogenesis the first zones of the hematopoietic cells emigration from blood vessels are registered in the points of blood and lymph vessels contacts eviction. The clusters without any borders are formed in these places of migration. In the 13 th week most clusters grow due to the ongoing process of hematopoietic cells emigration. Increasing clusters grow into the lumen of the primary lymphatic vessel. A closed system of the lymphatic circulation is formed. The amount of myelopoetic cells decreases gradually and the number of lymphoid cells, mainly medium and small lymphocytes, increases. Stromal cells are differentiated into reticulocytes. Lymph protocapillaries transform into the sinuses system of the future medulla. In the 14 - 15 weeks the quantity of lymph node germs in the mesentery continues to increase, there are sporadic macrophages. The formation of a capsule from collagen fibers of the lymphatic vessels adventitia and mesentery connective tissue is observed in the majority of lymph node germs. Endothelial cells of post-capillary venules thicken in the 16 - 17 week of fetal development. The amount of hemopoietic cells decreases. Dense clusters of lymphoid cells around the blood capillary glomeruli form the beginnings of the lymphoid follicles. To the 20 th week the content of lymphoid cells continues to increase, the majority of lymphocytes are found in the lymph node parenchyma and in the venules lumen. Cortex and medulla are visualized clearly. CONCLUSIONS: 1. The development of the human mesenteric lymph node is directly associated primarily with the development of the mesentery blood vessels. 2. We may identify the following stages in the histogenesis of the mesenteric lymph node in the first half of the prenatal period of the ontogeny: formation and differentiation of the structural units of the mesentery vascular network (8 - 10 week of fetal development); forming of hemo- and lymphopoietic cells clusters – lymph node germs (11 - 12 weeks), differentiation of the lymph node germs structures and reduce of the myelopoiesis (13 - 14 weeks), differentiation of structural zones of the mesenteric lymph node germs lymph (from the 15 weeks of fetal development). ...|$|R
