5|$|At the time, {{immunology}} {{was becoming}} more sophisticated, with the increasing role of molecular biology and biochemistry. Burnet was suspicious of {{the direction in which}} immunology was headed, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> emphasis on technology and more intricate experiments, and colleagues felt that Burnet's conservative attitude was a factor in his decision to turn the institute's focus to immunology.|$|E

5|$|However, {{with the}} {{increase}} in paved roads <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> size of cities, snow-paving fell out of favour, as the resultant slippery surfaces posed a danger to pedestrians and traffic. The earliest patents for snowplows date back to 1840, but there are no records of their actual use until 1862, when the city of Milwaukee began operating horse-drawn carts fitted with snowplows. The horse-drawn snowplow quickly spread to other cities, especially those in areas prone to heavy snowfall.|$|E

5|$|A Community of Witches {{is based}} on {{interviews}} with more than a hundred practicing Wiccans and Pagans, study of the pre-existing literature on the subject and a national survey of the Pagan community in the U.S. In her work, Berger interprets Wicca as a religion of late modernity, as opposed to postmodernity, and subsequently examines it using the theories of sociologists Anthony Giddens and James A. Beckford. Themes covered include Pagan conceptions of the self, the role of covens and the wider Pagan community, the place of children in the movement <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> routinization of Wicca through the foundation of organised churches and clergy.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{population}} density of Varanasi <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> number of tourists, the Uttar Pradesh government and international non-governmental organisations and institutions have expressed grave concern for the pollution and pressures on infrastructure in the city, mainly the sewage, sanitation, and drainage components. Pollution of the Ganges is a particular source of worry because of the religious significance of the river, the dependence of people on it {{as a source of}} drinking water, and its prominence as a symbol of Varanasi and the city itself. The sewage problem is exacerbated by the role of the Ganges in bathing and in river traffic, which is very difficult to control. Because of the sewage, people using local untreated water have higher risk of contracting a range of water-borne stomach diseases.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, Chelsea Bridge was in poor condition. It {{was unable to}} carry the {{increasing}} volume of traffic caused by the growth of London <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> popularity of the automobile; between 1914 and 1929 use of the bridge almost doubled from 6,500 to 12,600 vehicles per day. In addition, parts of its structure were beginning to work loose, and in 1922 the gilded finials on the towers {{had to be removed}} because of concerns that they would fall off. Architectural opinion had turned heavily against Victorian styles and Chelsea Bridge was now deeply unpopular with architects; former President of the Royal Institute of British Architects Reginald Blomfield spoke vehemently against its design in 1921, and there were few people supporting the preservation of the old bridge. In 1926 the Royal Commission on Cross-river Traffic recommended that Chelsea Bridge be rebuilt or replaced.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} Gilbert faced {{financial}} difficulty {{as an amateur}} cricketer. Most amateurs were from privileged backgrounds, whereas professionals mainly came from the working class. It was almost unthinkable for an amateur to become a professional, although many did receive financial inducements such as generous expenses and sinecure positions within county organisations. Unlike the Grace brothers, Gilbert {{did not have a}} profession outside cricket to provide a supplementary income allowing him to live comfortably. A solution seemed to arrive in 1880, when Fred Grace, the manager of the United South of England XI touring side and one of W. G. Grace's brothers, died and Gilbert took over his paid job as secretary. But the popularity of professional touring teams was already in decline, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> number of matches between county teams attracted more interest. An indication of trouble came in 1882 when a professional cricketer took Gilbert to court over unpaid fees for an appearance in a match.|$|E

5|$|Cardiff's {{first ground}} was at Sophia Gardens {{recreational}} park where they played from their founding in 1899 until 1910 when, {{due to the}} lack of facilities at the ground <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> amount of support for the club, Bartley Wilson contacted Bute Estate, who owned large amounts of Cardiff at the time, in an attempt to find land suitable for building a stadium. They eventually agreed on an area of waste ground on Sloper Road. The land was a former rubbish tip and required extensive work to get a playable surface, but with the assistance of Cardiff Corporation and volunteers the work was completed. The ground was originally to be known as Sloper Park but was instead named after Lord Ninian Crichton-Stuart, who was a large force in helping the club get the ground built, and became Ninian Park. The ground hosted its first match on 1 September 1910 with a friendly against Aston Villa, with the kick-off being performed by Lord Crichton-Stuart.|$|E
5|$|Gulf Oil {{was most}} synonymous for its {{association}} with auto racing, as it famously sponsored the John Wyer Automotive team in the 1960s and early '70s. The signature light blue and orange color scheme associated with its Ford GT40 and Porsche 917 {{is one of the}} most famous corporate racing colors and has been replicated by other racing teams sponsored by Gulf. Much of its popularity is attributed to the fact that in the 1971 film Le Mans, Steve McQueen's character, Michael Delaney, drives for the Gulf team. As a result of McQueen's increasing popularity following his death <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> popularity of the Heuer Monaco which he wore in the film, TAG Heuer released a limited edition of the watch with the Gulf logo and trademark color scheme. In the same era, Gulf Oil also sponsored Team McLaren during the Bruce McLaren days, which used a papaya orange color scheme with Gulf blue for lettering.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} part of the twentieth century, Slipher, Hubble and others made the first {{measurements}} of the redshifts and blueshifts of galaxies beyond the Milky Way. They initially interpreted these redshifts and blueshifts as due to random motions, but later Hubble discovered a rough correlation between the increasing redshifts <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> distance of galaxies. Theorists almost immediately realized that these observations could be explained by a mechanism for producing redshifts seen in certain cosmological solutions to Einstein's equations of general relativity. Hubble's law of the correlation between redshifts and distances is required by all such models that have a metric expansion of space. As a result, the wavelength of photons propagating through the expanding space is stretched, creating the cosmological redshift.|$|E
5|$|Sustainable use of {{materials}} has targeted {{the idea of}} dematerialization, converting the linear path {{of materials}} (extraction, use, disposal in landfill) to a circular material flow that reuses materials as much as possible, much like the cycling and reuse of waste in nature. This approach is supported by product stewardship <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> use of material flow analysis at all levels, especially individual countries and the global economy. The use of sustainable biomaterials that come from renewable sources {{and that can be}} recycled is preferred to the use on non-renewables from a life cycle standpoint.|$|E
5|$|The 1980s were a {{formative}} decade: {{the increased}} optimism after {{the signing of}} the peace treaty with Egypt in 1979, the economic recovery of the mid-1980s <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> travel abroad by average citizens were factors contributing to a greater interest in food and wine. In addition, high quality, locally produced ingredients became increasingly available. For example, privately owned dairies began to produce handmade cheeses from goat, sheep and cow’s milk, which quickly became very popular both among chefs and the general public. In 1983, the Golan Heights Winery was the first of many new Israeli winemakers to help transform tastes with their production of world-class, semi-dry and dry wines. New attention was paid to the making of handmade breads and the production of high quality olive oil. The successful development of aquaculture ensured a steady supply of fresh fish, and the agricultural revolution in Israel led to an overwhelming choice and quality of fresh fruit, vegetables and herbs.|$|E

5|$|The British mandate in Palestine, {{where an}} Arab {{majority}} lived alongside a Jewish minority, presented the British {{with a similar}} problem to that of India. The matter was complicated by large numbers of Jewish refugees seeking {{to be admitted to}} Palestine following the Holocaust, while Arabs were opposed {{to the creation of a}} Jewish state. Frustrated by the intractability of the problem, attacks by Jewish paramilitary organisations <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> cost of maintaining its military presence, Britain announced in 1947 that it would withdraw in 1948 and leave the matter to the United Nations to solve. The UN General Assembly subsequently voted for a plan to partition Palestine into a Jewish and an Arab state.|$|E
5|$|The devastating {{impact of}} this last war, added to the {{cumulative}} effects of a century of almost continuous conflict, left both empires crippled. When Kavadh II died only months after coming to the throne, Persia was plunged into several years of dynastic turmoil and civil war. The Sasanians were further weakened by economic decline, heavy taxation from Khosrau II's campaigns, religious unrest, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> power of the provincial landholders. The Byzantine Empire was also severely affected, with its financial reserves exhausted by {{the war and the}} Balkans now largely {{in the hands of the}} Slavs. Additionally, Anatolia was devastated by repeated Persian invasions; the Empire's hold on its recently regained territories in the Caucasus, Syria, Mesopotamia, Palestine and Egypt was loosened by many years of Persian occupation.|$|E
5|$|The first Olympic men's javelin throw contest {{was held}} in 1908 and a women's {{competition}} was introduced in 1932. The first javelins were made of various types of wood, but in the 1950s, former athlete Bud Held introduced a hollow javelin, then a metal javelin, both of which increased throwers performances. Another former athlete, Miklós Németh invented the rough-tailed javelin and throws reached in excess of 100m – edging towards the limits of stadia. The distances <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> number of horizontal landings led the IAAF to redesign the men's javelin to reduce distance and increase the implement's downward pitching moment to allow for easier measurement. Rough-tailed designs were banned in 1991 and all marks achieved with such javelins {{were removed from the}} record books. The women's javelin underwent a similar redesign in 1999. The current javelin specifications are 2.6 to 2.7m in length and 800grams in weight for men, and 2.2 to 2.3m and 600g for women.|$|E
