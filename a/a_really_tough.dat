That's {{a heck of a}} range for such a young actor." [...] Josh Hutcherson was not their first choice for the role of Jesse Aarons, but they settled with him because they [...] "felt the chemistry between AnnaSophia Robb and him".

500|$|Early on, I {{realized}} {{that what this}} particular crew needed from me was not pressure but the light touch. [...] Once informed of our objective, their enthusiasm infected everything they did, and here and there might easily have caused stress-related dysfunction. [...] Extended separation from home and family with no means of communications {{was not a problem}} — submariners are used to that — but bearing down too much on the job might be. [...] My concern was about our performance in an emergency, being at the same time unable to predict what emergencies might be in store for us. [...] It was important, I thought, to hold back on the pressure until <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>tough</b> problem came up. [...] This happened several times, as I knew it would, and I was glad I had something in reserve.|$|E

The opening sequence set {{in the corridors of}} a spaceship was filmed on 20 September 2011 at Uskmouth Power Station. As the conditions were very noisy, the crew had to wear ear protectors. [...] Filming of some scenes involving Alexander Armstrong took place in and around the Lancaster bomber Just Jane at the Lincolnshire Aviation Heritage Centre on 3 October 2011. External footage of the lighthouse building took place in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire. Smith stated, [...] "It was <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>tough</b> shoot.

They didn't tell me {{they were going to do}} this, but they told Jon to hold my hand and not let it go. Then he did, and I lost it. Every single one of those tears were absolutely real.

He said the style instead ended up being [...] "more gritty and rough around the edges due to the lack of time and money that we had to shoot the movie with" [...] and it ultimately became the aesthetic of the film.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers have praised Super Punch-Out!! for {{its other}} unique {{features}} {{and for its}} rewarding difficulty. Game Informer magazine praised the game for its time attack mode, which recorded and kept track of the fastest knockouts for each opponent. Miller also commended the time attack mode, adding to the game's replay value. Another review from VideoGames & Computer Entertainment magazine lauded the game for a fair difficulty curve, stating that it [...] "is <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>tough</b> game, but it's one in which repeated playing (and you will be playing it a lot) really pays off". Lucas Thomas from IGN, while praising the game overall, says that the game lacks the overall appeal that the NES version had and that he recommends the NES version over this version. He notes that the sound is [...] "Not as memorable as the music from the NES game, but [...] more varied". He says that {{many people who are}} familiar with the NES version have to relearn new attack patterns from different opponents. Thomas also notes that the game did not have as large an audience as the NES version enjoyed.|$|E

Simms later commented, [...] "ll of a sudden it kind of hit me, I've put Lawrence in <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>tough</b> spot; national TV, he's got dress shoes and a sports jacket on, and he's had a few beers and he's going to run down the field and I'm going to throw him a pass." [...] Simms then motioned for Taylor to run a longer pattern, and after 30–40yards, threw him the pass. Taylor later stated that the situation made him more nervous than any play of his career, [...] "I'm saying to myself (as the pass is being thrown), 'If I drop this pass, I got to run my black ass all the way to Upper Saddle River because there ain't no way I'm {{going to be able to}} stay in that stadium'." [...] Taylor caught the pass however, and the capacity crowd in attendance cheered in approval. Since he has been retired for more than five years, Simms is eligible for selection into the Pro Football Hall of Fame; he has yet to be inducted, however.|$|E

In December 2010, she had an Achilles injury. [...] She sustained the injury playing in Australia. Between January 2011 and February 2012, she had surgeries to assist with Achilles and hip injuries. She had surgery on her left hip acetabular labrum in June 2011 in Vail, Colorado at the Richard Steadman Clinic. [...] She said of the surgery: [...] "This is <b>a</b> <b>really,</b> <b>really</b> <b>tough</b> decision, but after talking with my doctors and my family, we felt that immediate surgery is {{the best course of}} action. With something painful like this hip injury, I want to be especially proactive. I plan to stay in Seattle to be here with my team and try my best to be back on the court as soon as possible. My goal is to be at full strength {{by the end of the}} season." [...] She did rehab twice a day in an attempt to speed recovery. Afterwards, Jackson injured her right knee, requiring surgery in 2012. Another knee injury while playing in China in 2014 degraded into arthritis and required many surgical intervention in the following years, including a hospitalization in January 2016 once the operated knee joint got infected. All the consequences of this knee problem lead to Jackson's retirement in March.

In 1975, following the success of Expo '74, Geraghty established and began publishing a weekly newspaper known as The Falls, referring to the Spokane River, which prominently passes through Riverfront Park and the central business district, flowing over the Spokane Falls, just under the Monroe Street Bridge. After two years, the newspaper shut down, when it was proven to be unsuccessful. Geraghty said of the venture, [...] "That was <b>really</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> go because we were fighting the newspaper in Spokane.

Before {{and during the}} shoot, for inspiration, ANR was asked by Ramakrishna to watch Uttam Kumar’s performance from Baradidi, a print of which he brought from Kolkata. ANR did heed to his advice and even donned the getup just like the Bengali super star but held to his own on histrionics. It {{was not easy to}} look pensive all through the film playing the introvert submerged in his own world and with measured dialogue delivery akin to method acting. ANR simply excelled. No wonder, he considered Suren as his best portrayal among his 250 plus films. For domineering actress like Bhanumathi, it was <b>really</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> task to under play. With subdued performance, as Madhavi torn between tragic personal life and tradition, she proved one more time her brilliance.
