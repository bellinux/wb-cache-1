25|$|This {{organization}} {{is said to}} be related to several fronts including the <b>anti-imperialist</b> <b>league</b> and its anti-clerical analogue.|$|E
25|$|In 1898 Addams {{joined the}} <b>Anti-Imperialist</b> <b>League,</b> in {{opposition}} to the U.S. annexation of the Philippines. A staunch supporter of the 'Progressive' Party, she nominated Theodore Roosevelt for the Presidency during the Party Convention, held in Chicago in August 1912. She signed up on the party platform, even though it called for building more battleships. She went on to speak and campaign extensively for Roosevelt's 1912 presidential campaign.|$|E
25|$|Some Americans, notably William Jennings Bryan, Mark Twain, Andrew Carnegie, Ernest Crosby, {{and other}} members of the American <b>Anti-Imperialist</b> <b>League,</b> {{strongly}} objected to the annexation of the Philippines. Anti-imperialist movements claimed that the United States had become a colonial power, by replacing Spain as the colonial power in the Philippines. Other anti-imperialists opposed annexation on racist grounds. Among these was Senator Benjamin Tillman of South Carolina, who feared that annexation of the Philippines would lead to an influx of non-white immigrants into the United States. As news of atrocities committed in subduing the Philippines arrived in the United States, support for the war flagged.|$|E
50|$|His {{moderate}} demeanor {{enabled him}} to establish close ties with Americans in Massachusetts, that soon he became an influential voice in the <b>Anti-Imperialist</b> <b>League's</b> shift from a nearly exclusive focus {{on the effects of}} imperialism on the United States to one, which included a component of solidarity with the Filipino people. López remained in exile for many years because he refused to take the pledge of allegiance to the United States that was required for his entrance back into his homeland.|$|R
50|$|Allen {{was also}} a member of several focused single {{interest}} groups, including the <b>anti-imperialist</b> American <b>League</b> for India's Freedom and the anti-fascist League Against German Fascism.|$|R
5000|$|Official {{statements}} by the North Korean government attribute {{the origin of}} Juche to Kim Il-Sung's experiences in the <b>Anti-Imperialist</b> Youth <b>League</b> in 1930 in his [...] "liberation struggle" [...] against Japan. The first documented reference to Juche as an ideology appeared in 1955, in a speech given by Kim Il Sung entitled [...] "On Eliminating Dogmatism and Formalism and Establishing Juche in Ideological Work". The speech had been delivered to promote a political purge similar to the earlier Yan'an Rectification Movement in China.|$|R
25|$|In 1884, he was {{a leader}} in the Independent (or Mugwump) {{movement}} against the nomination of James Blaine for president and for the election of Grover Cleveland. From 1888 to 1892, he was general American representative of the Hamburg American Steamship Company. In 1892, he succeeded George William Curtis as president of the National Civil Service Reform League and held this office until 1901. He also succeeded Curtis as editorial writer for Harper's Weekly in 1892 and held this position until 1898. In 1895 he spoke for the Fusion anti-Tammany Hall ticket in New York City. He opposed William Jennings Bryan for president in 1896, speaking for sound money and not {{under the auspices of the}} Republican party; he supported Bryan four years later because of anti-imperialism beliefs, which also led to his membership in the American <b>Anti-Imperialist</b> <b>League.</b>|$|E
25|$|While Carnegie did {{not comment}} on British imperialism, he very {{strongly}} opposed the idea of American colonies. He strongly opposed the annexation of the Philippines, {{almost to the point}} of supporting William Jennings Bryan against McKinley in 1900. In 1898, Carnegie tried to arrange for independence for the Philippines. As the end of the Spanish–American War neared, the United States bought the Philippines from Spain for $20 million. To counter what he perceived as imperialism on the part of the United States, Carnegie personally offered $20 million to the Philippines so that the Filipino people could buy their independence from the United States. However, nothing came of the offer. In 1898 Carnegie joined the American <b>Anti-Imperialist</b> <b>League,</b> in opposition to the U.S. annexation of the Philippines. Its membership included former presidents of the United States Grover Cleveland and Benjamin Harrison and literary figures like Mark Twain.|$|E
25|$|Darrow {{soon became}} one of America's leading labor attorneys. He helped {{organize}} the Populist Party in Illinois and then ran for U.S. Congress as a Democrat in 1895 but lost to Hugh R. Belknap. In 1897, his marriage to Jessie Ohl ended in divorce. He joined the <b>Anti-Imperialist</b> <b>League</b> in 1898 {{in opposition to the}} U.S. annexation of the Philippines. He represented the woodworkers of Wisconsin in a notable case in Oshkosh in 1898 and the United Mine Workers in Pennsylvania in the great anthracite coal strike of 1902. He flirted with the idea of running for mayor of Chicago in 1903 but ultimately decided against it. The following year, in July, Darrow married Ruby Hammerstrom, a young Chicago journalist. His former mentor, Governor John Peter Altgeld, joined Darrow's firm following his Chicago mayoral electoral defeat in 1899 and worked with Darrow until his death in 1902.|$|E
50|$|Lega Nord's {{political}} {{culture is a}} mix of Northern Italian pride or even Padanian nationalism, often with claims of a proud Celtic heritage; resentment for some Southern Italian habits and Roman authorities; distrust of the Republic of Italy and especially its flag; some support for the free market, anti-statism, anti-globalism, and separatism or secessionism. The party boasts historical references to the <b>anti-imperialist</b> Lombard <b>League</b> and Alberto da Giussano (stylized in the party's symbol), the hero of the wars against Frederick I Barbarossa. These historical references are the base for the party's anti-monopolism and anti-centralism.|$|R
40|$|On 10 February 1927, the "First International Congress against Imperialism and Colonialism" in Brussels {{marked the}} {{establishment}} of the <b>anti-imperialist</b> organisation, the <b>League</b> against Imperialism and for National Independence (LAI, 1927 - 37). The complex preparations for the congress were though initiated already in 1925 by Willi Münzenberg, a German communist and General Secretary of the communist mass organisation, Internationale Arbeiterhilfe (IAH, 1921 - 35), together with the Communist International (Comintern, 1919 - 43). Berlin was the centre for the LAI and its International Secretariat (1927 - 33), a city serving the intentions of the communists to find colonial émigré activists in the Weimar capital, acting as representatives for the anti-colonial movement in Europe after the Great War. With the ascendancy to power of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) on 30 January 1933, the LAI reached an abrupt, but nonetheless, expected end in Berlin. This doctoral thesis examines the role, pu rpose and functions of a sympathising communist organization (LAI) : to act as an intermediary for the Comintern to the colonies. The analysis evaluates the structure and activities of the LAI, and by doing so, establish a complex understanding {{on one of the most}} influential communist organisations during the interwar period, which, despite its short existence, assumed a nostalgic reference and historical bond for anti-colonial movements during the transition from colonialism to post-colonialism after the Second World War, e. g. the Afro-Asian Conference in Bandung, Indonesia in 1955. Fredrik Petersson’s study, based on archives in Moscow, Berlin, Amsterdam, London, and Stockholm, uncovers why the Comintern established and supported the LAI and its anti-imperialist agenda, disclosing a complicated undertaking, characterised by conflict and the internal struggle for power, involving structural constraints and individual ambitions defined by communist ideology and strategy...|$|R
25|$|Under presidents William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt, Root {{served as}} the United States Secretary of War 1899–1904. He {{reformed}} {{the organization of the}} War Department. He enlarged West Point and established the U.S. Army War College, as well as the General Staff. He changed the procedures for promotions and organized schools for the special branches of the service. He also devised the principle of rotating officers from staff to line. Root was concerned about the new territories acquired after the Spanish–American War. He worked out the procedures for turning Cuba over to the Cubans, ensured a charter of government for the Philippines, and eliminated tariffs on goods imported to the United States from Puerto Rico. When the <b>Anti-Imperialist</b> <b>League</b> attacked American policies in the Philippines, Root defended the policies and counterattacked the critics, saying they prolonged the insurgency. During the summer of 1902, Root visited Europe, including France and Germany. Root left the cabinet in 1904 and returned to private practice as a lawyer.|$|E
2500|$|After its {{magazine}} publication, the <b>Anti-Imperialist</b> <b>League</b> of New York {{published the}} essay as a pamphlet {{and seems to}} have distributed as many as 125,000 copies. However, [...] "Even within the <b>Anti-Imperialist</b> <b>League,</b> reaction to Mark Twain’s essay was mixed. Though the League reprinted it as a pamphlet (it had the widest circulation of any League publication) League censors excised significant passages, included the author’s quotation from the New York Sun on the prevailing squalor in the slums of Manhattan’s Lower East Side, {{as well as his}} bitter condemnation of the activities of Christian missionaries in China." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mark Twain was [...] "an outspoken {{critic of}} American {{involvement}} in the Philippines and China", and [...] "one of the mammoth figures in anti-imperialism, and certainly the foremost anti-imperialist literary figure" [...] of his days, having become in January 1901 {{a vice president of}} the <b>Anti-Imperialist</b> <b>League</b> of New York.|$|E
2500|$|Stokes {{served in}} the New York National Guard from 1899 to 1901. During the Spanish–American War of 1898-1899 he was a private in the U.S. Army cavalry, {{but he did not}} deploy overseas. At this same time, Graham's father was active in the <b>Anti-Imperialist</b> <b>League,</b> {{described}} by one historian as [...] "a group of substantial citizens" [...] opposed to American intervention in the Philippines.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1890s, Boutwell became {{increasingly}} disenchanted with the imperialist {{foreign policy of}} President William McKinley, and left the Republican Party after the annexation of the Philippines following the 1898 Spanish–American War. He was a founder and {{the first president of}} the American <b>Anti-Imperialist</b> <b>League,</b> an organization opposed to American expansion. [...] He campaigned against McKinley in the 1900, and was a presidential elector for the Democratic ticket of William Jennings Bryan. [...] He would promote Philippine independence until his death.|$|E
2500|$|Gompers, who had {{ties with}} the Cuban cigar workers in the U.S., called for American {{intervention}} in Cuba; he supported the resulting war with Spain in 1898. [...] After the war, however, he joined the <b>Anti-Imperialist</b> <b>League</b> to oppose President William McKinley's plan to annex the Philippines. Mandel (1963) argues that his anti-imperialism was based on opportunistic fears of threats to labor's status from low-paid offshore workers and was founded on a sense of racial superiority to {{the peoples of the}} Philippines.|$|E
2500|$|From 1901, {{soon after}} his return from Europe, {{until his death in}} 1910, Twain was {{vice-president}} of the American <b>Anti-Imperialist</b> <b>League,</b> which opposed the annexation of the Philippines by the United States and had [...] "tens of thousands of members". He wrote many political pamphlets for the organization. The Incident in the Philippines, posthumously published in 1924, was in response to the Moro Crater Massacre, in which six hundred Moros were killed. Many of his neglected and previously uncollected writings on anti-imperialism appeared {{for the first time in}} book form in 1992.|$|E
2500|$|In mid-1900, he was {{the guest}} of {{newspaper}} proprietor Hugh Gilzean-Reid at Dollis Hill House, located {{on the north side}} of London. Twain wrote that he had [...] "never seen any place that was so satisfactorily situated, with its noble trees and stretch of country, and everything that went to make life delightful, and all within a biscuit's throw of the metropolis of the world." [...] He then returned to America in October 1900, having earned enough to pay off his debts. In winter 1900/01, he became his country's most prominent opponent of imperialism, raising the issue in his speeches, interviews, and writings. In January 1901, he began serving as vice-president of the <b>Anti-Imperialist</b> <b>League</b> of New York.|$|E
2500|$|In 1916 Ji Chaoding entered Tsinghua University, {{a school}} {{supported}} by {{funds from the}} Boxer Indemnity and whose classes were taught largely in English. [...] In {{the aftermath of the}} 1919 May Fourth Movement, an awakening of patriotic spirit, Ji Chaoding led radical nationalist activities along with classmates Luo Longji and Wang Zaoshi. After graduating in 1924 he went to the United States to study on the Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program. He graduated from the University of Chicago in 1926 with a bachelor's degree in history. [...] While there he was president of the Chicago Chinese Student Association, and worked with the American <b>Anti-Imperialist</b> <b>League.</b> In 1926 Ji joined the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA). The Party had a keen interest in global communism, and established a Chinese Bureau to supervise students from China. At that time, the newly formed Communist Party of China was in a United Front alliance with the Nationalist Party of Sun Yat-sen, who was popular among American Chinese, and Ji developed a national reputation as a public speaker able to rouse support for China with his anti-imperialist speeches to local Chinese groups in Chinese or to leftist comrades in English. In 1926, Ji and several of his Tsinghua friends denounced American supporters of the Nationalists and secretly joined the Communist Party of China. Their membership was kept secret in order to avoid surveillance or deportation, to allow them to work in American Chinese communities where the Nationalists were strong, and to keep their options open when they returned to China.|$|E

50|$|In October 1899 a Chicago group {{inspired}} by the Boston organization which had previously styled itself as the Central <b>Anti-Imperialist</b> <b>League,</b> held a convention merging with another organization to form the American <b>Anti-Imperialist</b> <b>League.</b> This organization would in turn merge with the Boston-based <b>Anti-Imperialist</b> <b>League</b> in the following month, rechristening the Boston organization as the New England branch of the American <b>Anti-Imperialist</b> <b>League.</b> Despite this formal organizational change, the Boston office remained the leading center of the anti-imperialist movement nationwide.|$|E
50|$|Although {{itself an}} {{international}} group, the All-American <b>Anti-Imperialist</b> <b>League</b> was in turn attached to another Comintern-sponsored international organization, the League Against Imperialism.
