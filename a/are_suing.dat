25|$|A union may, in {{some limited}} circumstances, require {{employees}} to exhaust any internal appeals procedures provided under the union's constitution before filing suit. Unions and employers may also generally require employees to exhaust their {{rights under the}} grievance arbitration procedures provided for under {{the collective bargaining agreement}} before suing the employer for breach of contract. However employees do not usually have to exhaust such procedures if they <b>are</b> <b>suing</b> only the union, since very few collective bargaining agreements even allow for the filing of a grievance against the union by covered employees. To the extent that an employee might have a breach of contract claim against a union arising out of its performance of its duty to represent that employee, the courts will apply the same deferential standards and procedural requirements that they would employ if the worker sued the union on a breach of the duty of fair representation theory.|$|E

25|$|Adam Air {{is being}} sued by Indonesian {{consumer}} and labour groups over the accident, {{for a total}} of one trillion rupiahs (US$100 million), to be paid {{to the families of the}} victims. According to a lawyer for the families, speaking in a press conference along with the secretary for the Adam Air KI-574 Passengers' Families Association (formed in the aftermath of the disaster), 30 of the victims' families intend to sue Boeing instead of Adam Air over the accident. However, this does not necessarily mean that all of the others will sue Adam Air, as they may not necessarily exercise their right to sue at all. Representatives of the families have explained that they believe the plane was brought down by a faulty rudder control valve although there is no evidence that proves this, similarly to the accidents involving United Airlines Flight 585 and USAir Flight 427, which went down in the early 1990s. They have explained that, as a result, they <b>are</b> <b>suing</b> Boeing and Parker Hannifin, the valve's manufacturer, although airlines using the 737 have been warned about problems with the rudder control valves.|$|E

2500|$|Limited {{liability}} {{is where}} a person's financial liability {{is limited to a}} fixed sum, most commonly the value of a person's investment in a company or partnership. If a company with limited liability is sued, then the claimants <b>are</b> <b>suing</b> the company, not its owners or investors. [...] A shareholder in a limited company is not personally liable for any of the debts of the company, other than for the amount already invested in the company and for any unpaid amount on the shares in the company, if any. The same is true for the members of a limited liability partnership and the limited partners in a limited partnership. By contrast, sole proprietors and partners in general partnerships are each liable for all the debts of the business (unlimited liability).|$|E
2500|$|A June 2008 {{profile in}} The New Yorker {{detailed}} several controversies involving Adelson. In 2008 Richard Suen, a Hong Kong businessman {{who had helped}} Adelson make connections with top Chinese officials {{in order to obtain}} the Macau license, took Adelson to court in Las Vegas alleging he had reneged on his agreement to allow Suen to profit from the venture. Suen won a $43.8 million judgement; in November 2010, the Nevada Supreme Court overturned the judgment and returned the case to the lower court for further consideration. In the 2013 retrial, the jury awarded Suen a verdict for $70 million. The judge added another $31.6 million in interest, bringing the total judgment against Adelson to $101.6 million. Adelson is appealing again. Adelson faces another trial over claims by three alleged [...] "middlemen" [...] in the deal who <b>are</b> <b>suing</b> for at least $450 million.|$|E

2500|$|Proximate cause {{means that}} you {{must be able to}} show that the harm was caused by the tort you <b>are</b> <b>suing</b> for. The defense may argue that there was a prior cause or a {{superseding}} intervening cause. A common situation where a prior cause becomes an issue is the personal injury car accident, where the person re-injures an old injury. For example, someone who has a bad back is injured in the back in a car accident. Years later he is still in pain. He must prove the pain is caused by the car accident, and not the natural progression of the previous problem with the back. [...] A superseding intervening cause happens shortly after the injury. For example, if after the accident the doctor who works on you commits malpractice and injures you further, the defense can argue that it was not the accident, but the incompetent doctor who caused your injury.|$|E
