However, it is still important to be wary before ingesting any sort of silver-ion solution.|$|E

25|$|Silver's {{antimicrobial}} activity {{saw many}} applications {{prior to the}} discovery of modern antibiotics, when it fell into near disuse. Its association with <b>argyria</b> made consumers wary and led them to turn away from it when given an alternative.|$|E
25|$|Uneven {{pigmentation}} of {{some sort}} affects most people, regardless of bioethnic background or skin color. Skin may either appear lighter, or darker than normal, or lack pigmentation at all; there may be blotchy, uneven areas, patches of brown to gray discoloration or freckling. Apart from blood-related conditions such as jaundice, carotenosis, or <b>argyria,</b> skin pigmentation disorders generally occur because the body produces either {{too much or too}} little melanin.|$|E
25|$|A 2013 {{systematic}} {{review of the}} English-language case reports found that serious adverse events associated with acupuncture are rare, but that acupuncture is not without risk. Between 2000 and 2011 the English-language literature from 25 countries and regions reported 294 adverse events. The majority of the reported adverse events were relatively minor, and the incidences were low. For example, a prospective survey of 34,000 acupuncture treatments found no serious adverse events and 43 minor ones, a rate of 1.3 per 1000 interventions. Another survey found there were 7.1% minor adverse events, of which 5 were serious, amid 97,733 acupuncture patients. The most common adverse effect observed was infection (e.g. mycobacterium), {{and the majority of}} infections were bacterial in nature, caused by skin contact at the needling site. Infection has also resulted from skin contact with unsterilized equipment or with dirty towels in an unhygienic clinical setting. Other adverse complications included five reported cases of spinal cord injuries (e.g. migrating broken needles or needling too deeply), four brain injuries, four peripheral nerve injuries, five heart injuries, seven other organ and tissue injuries, bilateral hand edema, epithelioid granuloma, pseudolymphoma, <b>argyria,</b> pustules, pancytopenia, and scarring due to hot-needle technique. Adverse reactions from acupuncture, which are unusual and uncommon in typical acupuncture practice, included syncope, galactorrhoea, bilateral nystagmus, pyoderma gangrenosum, hepatotoxicity, eruptive lichen planus, and spontaneous needle migration.|$|E
500|$|The word used in Matthew 26:15 (ἀργύρια, <b>argyria)</b> {{simply means}} [...] "silver coins," [...] and {{scholars}} {{disagree on the}} type of coins that would have been used. Donald Wiseman suggests two possibilities. They could have been tetradrachms of Tyre, usually referred to as Tyrian shekels (14 grams of 94% silver), or staters from Antioch (15 grams of 75% silver), which bore the head of Augustus. Alternatively, they could have been Ptolemaic tetradrachms (13.5 ± 1 g of 25% silver). There are 31.1035 grams per troy ounce. At spot valuation of $17.06/oz (the closing price on Monday, December 12, 2016), 30 [...] "pieces of silver" [...] would be worth between $185 and $216 in present-day value (USD).|$|E
50|$|<b>Argyria</b> or argyrosis is a {{condition}} caused by inappropriate exposure to chemical compounds of the element silver, or to silver dust. The most dramatic symptom of <b>argyria</b> is that the skin turns blue or bluish-grey. It may {{take the form of}} generalized <b>argyria</b> or local <b>argyria.</b> Generalized <b>argyria</b> affects large areas over much of the visible surface of the body. Local <b>argyria</b> shows in limited regions of the body, such as patches of skin, parts of the mucous membrane or the conjunctiva.|$|E
50|$|The terms <b>argyria</b> and argyrosis {{have long}} been used interchangeably, with <b>argyria</b> being used more frequently. Argyrosis has been used {{particularly}} in referring to <b>argyria</b> of the conjunctiva, but the usage has never been consistent and cannot be relied on except {{where it has been}} explicitly specified.|$|E
50|$|Incorporation of {{the silver}} ions can lead to local <b>argyria</b> (discoloration of the skin), {{especially}} if the treated area is exposed to ultraviolet light. Generalised <b>argyria</b> with silver accumulation in kidneys, liver, and retina has only been found in association with excessive long-term use, or repeated use on severe and heavily inflamed burns. Possible consequences of generalised <b>argyria</b> include interstitial nephritis and anemia.|$|E

5000|$|Though {{toxicity}} of silver is low, {{the human body}} has no biological use for silver and when inhaled, ingested, injected, or applied topically, silver will accumulate irreversibly in the body, particularly in the skin, and chronic use combined with exposure to sunlight {{can result in a}} disfiguring condition known as <b>argyria</b> in which the skin becomes blue or blue-gray. Localized <b>argyria</b> can occur as a result of topical use of silver-containing creams and solutions, while the ingestion, inhalation, or injection can result in generalized <b>argyria.</b> Preliminary reports of treatment with laser therapy have been reported. These laser treatments are painful and general anesthesia is required. A similar laser treatment has been used to clear silver particles from the eye, a condition related to <b>argyria</b> called argyrosis. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) describes <b>argyria</b> as a [...] "cosmetic problem".|$|E
50|$|Localised <b>argyria</b> {{often results}} from topical use of {{substances}} containing silver, such as {{some kinds of}} eye drops. Generalized <b>argyria</b> results from chronically swallowing or inhaling silver compounds, either for home medicines purposes, or {{as a result of}} working with silver or silver compounds.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Argyria</b> and staining: Ingested silver {{or silver}} compounds, {{including}} colloidal silver, {{can cause a}} condition called <b>argyria,</b> a discoloration of the skin and organs.In 2006, there was {{a case study of}} a 17-year-old man, who sustained burns to 30% of his body, and experienced a temporary bluish-grey hue after several days of treatment with Acticoat, a brand of wound dressing containing silver nanoparticles. <b>Argyria</b> is the deposition of silver in deep tissues, a condition that cannot happen on a temporary basis, raising {{the question of whether the}} cause of the man’s discoloration was <b>argyria</b> or even a result of the silver treatment. Silver dressings are known to cause a “transient discoloration” that dissipates in 2-14 days, but not a permanent discoloration.|$|E
