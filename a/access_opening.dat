50|$|On September 4, 1979, US patent number 4166462 {{was issued}} for a {{self-propelled}} shark-proof cage; being {{designed to allow}} abalone divers to collect abalone without becoming vulnerable to attack. Thanks to the propulsion system, abalone divers would exert themselves less and, therefore, be able to collect their prey {{for longer periods of}} time. The patent abstract details a self-propelled cage with at least one <b>access</b> <b>opening</b> and a propeller mounting frame that carries both an air motor and a propeller. Buoyant material is attached to the frame so that the cage may be made neutrally buoyant in saltwater. This patent expired on September 4, 1996.|$|E

50|$|An {{access door}} or hatch is {{normally}} hinged inward and held closed by the pressure differential, {{but it may}} also be dogged for a better seal at low pressure. There is a door or hatch at the <b>access</b> <b>opening</b> to the forechamber, the main chamber, both ends of a medical or stores lock, and at any trunking to connect multiple chambers. A closed bell has a similar hatch at the bottom for use underwater and may have a side hatch for transfer under pressure to a saturation system, or may use the bottom hatch for this purpose. The external door to the medical lock is unusual in that it opens outward and is not held closed by the internal pressure, so it needs a safety interlock system to make it impossible to open when the lock is pressurised.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Abutment screw {{loosening}} {{has been}} considered as a common complication of implant-supported dental prostheses. This problem is more important in cement-retained implant restorations due to their invisible position of the screw <b>access</b> <b>opening.</b> Case Report: This report describes a modified retrievability method for cement-retained implant restorations {{in the event of}} abutment screw loosening. The screw <b>access</b> <b>opening</b> was marked with ceramic stain and its porcelain surface was treated using hydrofluoric acid (HF), silane, and adhesive to bond to composite resin.

40|$|Require {{only one}} [secondary] {{containment}} access door per <b>access</b> <b>opening</b> to be closed. Justification: NLJREG- 1433 SR 3. 6. 4. 1. 3 has been modified to only require one secondary containment access door per <b>access</b> <b>opening</b> to be closed. This {{is consistent with}} the intent of NUREG- 1434 (BWR/ 6 STS) since the BWRI 6 secondary containment design only includes one door per <b>access</b> <b>opening.</b> The BWR/ 2 - 5 designs normally include two doors per <b>access</b> <b>opening.</b> Verifying tat one door in each <b>access</b> <b>opening</b> is closed ensures that the infiltration of outside air of such a magnitude as to prevent maintaining the desired negative pressure does not occur. The Bases is modified to include a bracketed insert to provide additional description for those plants, which have airlocks with multiple inner or outer doors. The Bases will also be modified to state that the normal condition of the plant is to keep both doors closed, except during entry and exit or when maintenance is being performed on the access. The Bases description is consistent with flx BWR/ 2 - 5 practice. NUREG- 1434 SR 3. 6. 4. 1. 3 has also been modified to allow the one door option, similar to that described above fo...|$|E

40|$|This {{invention}} {{provides a}} prismatic zinc-air cell including, in general, a prismatic container having therein an air cathode, a separator and a zinc anode. The container has {{one or more}} oxygen <b>access</b> <b>openings,</b> and the air cathode is disposed in the container in gaseous communication with the oxygen <b>access</b> <b>openings</b> so as to allow access of oxygen to the cathode. The separator has a first side in electrolytic communication with the air cathode and a second side in electrolytic communication with the zinc anode. The separator isolates the cathode and the zinc anode from direct electrical contact and allows passage of electrolyte therebetween. An expansion chamber adjacent to the zinc anode is provided which accommodates expansion of the zinc anode during discharge of the cell. A suitable collapsible foam member generally occupies the expansion space, providing sufficient resistance tending to oppose movement of the zinc anode away from the separator while collapsing upon expansion of the zinc anode during discharge of the cell. One or more vent openings disposed in the container are in gaseous communication with the expansion space, functioning to satisfactorily minimize the pressure buildup within the container by venting gasses expelled as the foam collapses during cell discharge...|$|R

30|$|The shell {{buckling}} is {{the most}} important failure mode in most of the thin-walled structures. The buckling of thin-walled cylindrical shells is much more important during earthquakes. The shell buckling depends on many parameters, one of which is cutout. The cutouts are formed for <b>access</b> <b>openings,</b> pipe line passage and so on and can affect the stability of these structures. Therefore, in designing the tanks and marine structures, it is essential to discover how cutouts affect the loading capacity and buckling behavior of cylindrical shells. In this regard, wide investigations have been conducted by the researches.|$|R
