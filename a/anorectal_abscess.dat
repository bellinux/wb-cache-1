50|$|Pain in the perianal area is {{the most}} common symptom of an <b>anorectal</b> <b>abscess.</b> The pain may be dull, aching, or throbbing. It is worst when the person sits down and right before a bowel movement. After the {{individual}} has a bowel movement, the pain usually lessens. Other signs and symptoms of <b>anorectal</b> <b>abscess</b> include constipation, drainage from the rectum, fever and chills, or a palpable mass near the anus.|$|E
50|$|An <b>anorectal</b> <b>abscess</b> is an {{infection}} that forms {{a pocket of}} pus within the tissues around the anus. It is treated surgically by incision and drainage.|$|E
50|$|Diagnosis of <b>anorectal</b> <b>abscess</b> {{begins with}} a medical history and {{physical}} exam. Imaging studies which can help determine the diagnosis in cases of a deep non-palpable perirectal abscess include pelvic CT scan, MRI or trans-rectal ultrasound. These studies are not necessary, though, in cases which the diagnosis can be made upon physical exam.|$|E
25|$|Closing an abscess {{immediately}} after draining {{it appears to}} speed healing without increasing the risk of recurrence. This may not apply to <b>anorectal</b> <b>abscesses.</b> While they heal faster, {{there may be a}} higher rate of recurrence than those left open.|$|R
50|$|The {{bacterium}} Chlamydia trachomatis {{can cause}} 2 conditions in humans; viz. trachoma and lymphogranuloma venereum. Trachoma can cause an asymptomatic proctitis, but {{the symptoms of}} lymphogranuloma venereum are usually more severe, including pruritus ani, purulent rectaldischarge, hematochezia rectal pain and diarrhea or constipation. Lymphogranuloma venereum can cause fistulas, strictures and <b>anorectal</b> <b>abscesses</b> if left untreated. Hence, it can be confused with Crohn's disease.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Anorectal</b> <b>abscess</b> (also {{known as}} an anal/rectal abscess, or perianal/perirectal abscess) is an abscess {{adjacent}} to the anus. [...] It arises from an infection {{at one of the}} anal sinuses which leads to inflammation and abscess formation. Most cases of perianal abscesses are sporadic, though there are certain situations which elevate the risk for developing the disease, such as diabetes mellitus, Crohn's disease, chronic corticosteroid treatment and others. Ischiorectal, inter- and intrasphincteric abscesses have been described.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionPerianal suppurations have an {{incidence}} of 1 – 2 : 10, 000 inhabitants {{per year and}} represent about 5 % of proctology consultations, more frequently in males, being rare in childhood.

40|$|Anal sepsis is {{a common}} {{surgical}} condition. The management of anal sepsis requires sound knowledge of the anorectal anatomy and the etiology of the condition. The cryptoglandular hypothesis is widely accepted as the origin of primary <b>anorectal</b> sepsis. <b>Anorectal</b> <b>abscesses,</b> and fistulas are regarded as a single disease entity. However, from the various evidence, the cryptoglandular hypothesis could not ac- count {{for all of the}} primary anorectal sepsis. Underlying colorectal conditions and systemic diseases leading to anorectal suppuration should also be considered.

40|$|Endorectal {{ultrasound}} (ERUS) imaging is {{a complex}} process using electronic devices to control ultrasound waves and produce images of anatomic structures. It is a simple, cheep and well-tolerated procedure that provides excellent images of rectal and anal canal wall and pelvic floor muscles together with surrounding organs and tissues. The direct imaging of anal canal and pelvic floor muscles with surrounding tissues allows one to identify sphincter defects, <b>anorectal</b> <b>abscesses</b> and fistulas as well as great variety of benign and malignant pathology of the pelvis. Basically, techniques for ERUS are very similar, {{but there are some}} slight modifications regarding equipment, indications, and localization of pathologic process.

40|$|AB colon; We {{retrospectively}} {{reviewed the}} charts of 55 patients with ischiorectal abscesses treated from 1980 to 1983 at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. The patients were treated by placement of a 10 F to 16 F soft latex mushroom catheter into the abscess cavity under local anesthesia {{as an office}} procedure. The end of the catheter was shortened to leave 2 to 3 cm exiting the skin, and a bandage was applied. No sutures or irrigations were used, and the drains were removed an average of 12 days after placement. Antibiotics were not given. The patients {{ranged in age from}} 17 to 76 years (mean, 40 years) and 36 % were female. Four patients had diabetes, and eight had a history of inflammatory bowel disease. Nine patients had been treated previously for <b>anorectal</b> <b>abscesses.</b> There were no complications. Adequate follow-up was obtainable in 31 patients (ten to 63 months; mean, 30 months). Eight of them (26 %) were subsequently treated for fistulas found after resolution of the abscess, and an additional eight (26 %) had a second abscess form during the follow-up period. The average time to this recurrence was 20 months. Catheter drainage of ischiorectal abscess in selected cases resulted in healing with low morbidity and significant cost savings...|$|R

40|$|<b>Anorectal</b> <b>abscess</b> and fistula {{are among}} the most common {{diseases}} encountered in adults. Abscess and fistula should be considered the acute and chronic phase of the same anorectal infection. Abscesses are thought to begin as an infection in the anal glands spreading into adjacent spaces and resulting in fistulas in ~ 40 % of cases. The treatment of an <b>anorectal</b> <b>abscess</b> is early, adequate, dependent drainage. The treatment of a fistula, although surgical in all cases, is more complex due to the possibility of fecal incontinence as a result of sphincterotomy. Primary fistulotomy and cutting setons have the same incidence of fecal incontinence depending on the complexity of the fistula. So even though the aim of a surgical procedure is to cure a fistula, conservative management short of major sphincterotomy is warranted to preserve fecal incontinence. However, trading radical surgery for conservative (nonsphincter cutting) procedures such as a draining seton, fibrin sealant, anal fistula plug, endorectal advancement flap, dermal island flap, anoplasty, and LIFT (ligation of intersphincteric fistula tract) procedure all result in more recurrence/persistence requiring repeated operations in many cases. A surgeon dealing with fistulas on a regular basis must tailor various operations {{to the needs of the}} patient depending on the complexity of the fistula encountered...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Progression from <b>anorectal</b> <b>abscess</b> to fistula is po orly {{described}} {{and it remains}} unclear which patients develop a fistula following a preced ing abscess. We aim to assess the burden of <b>anorectal</b> <b>abscess</b> and the risk factors of subseq uent fistula formation. Methods The Hospital Episode Statistics database was used t o identify all patients presenting with new anorectal abscesses. Cox regression analysis wa s undertaken to identify factors predictive of fistula formation. Results 159, 052 patients in England with first-time abscess es presented from 1997 - 2012 with an incidence rate of 20. 2 / 100, 000. Subsequent fistula formation following an abscess was 16. 0 % (25, 530 / 159, 563) in idiopathic cases and 41. 5 % (4, 407 / 10, 613) in IBD cases (27 % coded concurrently as ulcerative colitis (UC); 47. 0 % coded as Crohn’s disease (CD)). Of the total patients who developed a fistula, 67. 0 % did s o within the first year. Independent predictors of fistula formation were; IBD, in particular CD (HR 3. 51, p< 0. 001), UC (HR 1. 82, p< 0. 001), female gender (HR 1. 18, p< 0. 001), 41 - 60 years old (HR 1. 85, p< 0. 001, compared to the < 20 age group); and intersphincteric (HR 1. 53, p< 0. 001) or ischiorectal (HR 1. 48, p< 0. 001) abscess locations, compared to peria nal. 2. 8 % of all patients presenting with a new abscess were subsequently diagnosed with CD (median 14 months). Conclusion This population study demonstrates that the burden of anorectal sepsis is high, with subsequent fistula formation nearly x 3 times higher in CD than idiopathic disease. Female gender is a novel, independent predictor of fistula formation following abscess drainage and most fistulas form within the first year.

40|$|Anorectal {{complaints}} are very common and {{are caused by}} a variety of mostly benign anorectal disorders. Many anorectal conditions may be successfully treated by primary care physicians in the outpatient setting, but patients tend not to seek medical attention due to embarrassment or fear of cancer. As a result, patients frequently present with advanced disease after experiencing significant decreases in quality of life. A number of patients with anorectal {{complaints are}} referred to gastroenterologists. However, gastroenterologists’ knowledge and experience in approaching these conditions may not be sufficient. This article can serve as a guide to gastroenterologists to recognize, evaluate, and manage medically or non-surgically common benign anorectal disorders, and to identify when surgical referrals are most prudent.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionAnorectal abscess {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{anorectal}} conditions encountered in practice. However, such abscesses may rarely extend upward and cause life-threatening medical conditions. Presentation of caseA 53 -year-old woman presented with symptoms of <b>anorectal</b> <b>abscess</b> and evidence of severe inflammatory response and acute kidney injury. Computed tomography revealed a widespread abscess extending to the bilateral retroperitoneal spaces. Surgical drainage was performed via a totally extraperitoneal approach through a lower midline abdominal incision, and the patient had a rapid and uncomplicated recovery. DiscussionAlthough retroperitoneal abscesses originating from the anorectal region are rare, they are life-threating events that require immediate treatment. Percutaneous abscess drainage has been recently evolved; however, surgical drainage is required sometimes that may be challenging, particularly in the case of widespread abscesses, as in our case. ConclusionThe midline extraperitoneal approach reported here might be an effective surgical option for patients with bilateral widespread retroperitoneal abscesses...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{the results of}} surgically treated ischiorectal abscesses in our service regarding postoperative morbidity, rate of abscess recurrence, and incidence of fistulas. Methods: From January 1, 1997 through December 21, 2007, 111 cases of ischiorectal abscess were surgically treated with incision-drainage and are surgically revised. Patients included 77 men and 34 women (male/female ratio of 2. 26 / 1) {{with a mean age}} of 42. 2 years. One third of the population reported a history of <b>anorectal</b> <b>abscess.</b> In 8. 1 % of patients the abscess spread. To adjacent tissues a fistula was found in 6. 3 % of patients at the time of incision and drainage All the patients were treated by intravenous antibiotic treatment. Results: There was no postoperative mortality. Localized postoperative morbidity was 5. 4 % and overall morbidity was 4. 5 %. A transphincteric fistula was present in 38. 6 % of patients and recurrence of abscess occurred in 12. 8 % on follow-up. Conclusions: Surgical treatment of ischiorectal abscesses by incision-drainage is a simple and safe technique. Nevertheless, long-term follow-up is necessary given the risk of recurrence and of transphincteric fistula requiring additional treatment...|$|E
40|$|Aim: Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive and high reliability procedure {{for evaluation of}} perianal area. In this study, our purpose is to present preoperative MRI findings and classification with images in diagnosed perianal fistula patients. Methods: Contrast enhanced (CE) conventional MRI images, diffusion weighted MRI images and demographics of 57 patients were retrospectively evaluated. Perianal fistula classification is based on St James University Hospital (SJUH) classification system.  Results: 57 patients (44 men and 13 women, average of 18 to 72 years, average age of 45. 7 year) were included in this study. Most of the patients had symptoms of rectal pain and discharge. Some patients had additional complaints like rectal itching, swelling and erythema. 37 patients had grade 1, nine patients had grade 2, four patients had grade 3, five patients had grade 4 and two patients had grade 5 fistula. Fistula opening positions into anal canal were 6 o'clock in 21 patients, 7 o'clock in 10 patients. Fistula tract, its opening position into anal canal, presence of abscess and its relationship with sphincters or neighboring anatomical structures were clearly appreciated with conventional and diffusion weighted MRI in all patients. Conclusion: Perianal fistula is the abnormal connection between anal canal and perinea. It is usually a complication of <b>anorectal</b> <b>abscess.</b> It could occur secondary to inflammatory processes like Crohn's disease, tuberculosis or malignancy. Surgery is considered as the primary treatment. Recurrence due to surgical inadequacy is common. Recurrence rates could be minimized with a good knowledge of MRI findings and well informing the surgeon...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Posterior {{horseshoe}} fistula {{with deep}} postanal space abscess {{is a complex}} disease. Most patients {{have a history of}} <b>anorectal</b> <b>abscess</b> drainage or surgery for fistula-in-ano. Methods Twenty-five patients who underwent surgery for posterior horseshoe fistula with deep postanal space abscess were analyzed retrospectively with respect to age, gender, previous surgery for fistula-in-ano, number of external openings, diagnostic studies, concordance between preoperative studies and operative findings for the extent of disease, operating time, healing time, complications, and recurrence. Results There were 22 (88 %) men and 3 (12 %) women with a median age of 37 (range, 25 – 58) years. The median duration of disease was 13 (range, 3 – 96) months. There was one external opening in 12 (48 %) patients, 2 in 8 (32 %), 3 in 4 (16 %), and 4 in 1 (4 %). Preoperative diagnosis of horseshoe fistula was made by contrast fistulography in 4 (16 %) patients, by ultrasound in 3 (12 %), by magnetic resonance imaging in 6 (24 %), and by physical examination only in the remainder (48 %). The mean ± SD operating time was 47 ± 10 min. The mean ± SD healing time was 12 ± 3 weeks. Three of the 25 patients (12 %) had diabetes mellitus type II. Nineteen (76 %) patients had undergone previous surgery for fistula-in-ano, while five (20 %) had only perianal abscess drainage. Neither morbidity nor mortality developed. All patients were followed up for a median of 35 (range, 6 – 78) months and no recurrence was observed. Conclusions Fistulotomy of the tracts along the arms of horseshoe fistula and drainage of the deep postanal space abscess with posterior midline incision that severs both the lower edge of the internal sphincter and the subcutaneous external sphincter and divides the superficial external sphincter into halves gives excellent results with no recurrence. When it is necessary, severing the halves of the superficial external sphincter unilaterally or even bilaterally in the same session does not result in anal incontinence. Close follow-up of patients until the wounds completely healed is essential in the prevention of premature wound closure and recurrence. </p...|$|E
