25|$|A common metric used to {{quantify}} food web trophic structure is food chain length. Food chain length {{is another way}} of describing food webs as a measure of the number of species encountered as energy or nutrients move from the plants to top predators. There are different ways of calculating food chain length depending on what parameters of the food web dynamic are being considered: connectance, energy, or interaction. In its simplest form, the length of a chain is the number of links between a trophic consumer and the base of the web. The mean chain length of an entire web is the <b>arithmetic</b> <b>average</b> of the lengths of all chains in a food web.|$|E
500|$|The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) {{describes}} climate [...] "normals" [...] as [...] "reference points used by climatologists {{to compare}} current climatological trends {{to that of}} the past or what is considered 'normal'. [...] A Normal is defined as the <b>arithmetic</b> <b>average</b> of a climate element (e.g. temperature) over a 30-year period. [...] A 30 year period is used, as it is long enough to filter out any interannual variation or anomalies, but also short {{enough to be able to}} show longer climatic trends." [...] The WMO originated from the International Meteorological Organization which set up a technical commission for climatology in 1929. At its 1934 Wiesbaden meeting the technical commission designated the thirty-year period from 1901 to 1930 as the reference time frame for climatological standard normals. In 1982 the WMO agreed to update climate normals, and these were subsequently completed on the basis of climate data from 1 January 1961 to 31 December 1990.|$|E
2500|$|The mean of a {{probability}} distribution is the long-run <b>arithmetic</b> <b>average</b> {{value of a}} random variable having that distribution.

In all cases, including those in which the distribution is neither discrete nor continuous, the mean is the Lebesgue integral of the random variable with respect to its probability measure.

2500|$|For example, {{suppose that}} a sample is {{obtained}} containing {{a large number}} of observations, each observation being randomly generated {{in a way that does}} not depend on the values of the other observations, and that the <b>arithmetic</b> <b>average</b> of the observed values is computed. If this procedure is performed many times, the central limit theorem says that the computed values of the average will be distributed according to a normal distribution. [...] A simple example of this is that if one flips a coin many times the probability of getting a given number of heads in a series of flips will approach a normal curve, with mean equal to half the total number of flips in each series. (In the limit of an infinite number of flips, it will equal a normal curve.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{descriptive}} statistics, {{the mean}} may {{be confused with}} the median, mode or mid-range, as any of these may be called an [...] "average" [...] (more formally, a measure of central tendency). The mean of a set of observations is the <b>arithmetic</b> <b>average</b> of the values; however, for skewed distributions, the mean is not necessarily the same as the middle value (median), or the most likely value (mode). For example, mean income is typically skewed upwards by a small number of people with very large incomes, so that the majority have an income lower than the mean. By contrast, the median income is the level at which half the population is below and half is above. The mode income is the most likely income, and favors the larger number of people with lower incomes. While the median and mode are often more intuitive measures for such skewed data, many skewed distributions are in fact best described by their mean, including the exponential and Poisson distributions.|$|E
