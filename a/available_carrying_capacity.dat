Lieutenant-Colonel Boxer adapted his design in 1864 to produce shrapnel shells {{for the new}} rifled muzzle-loader (RML) guns: the walls were of thick cast iron, but the gunpowder charge was now in the shell base with a tube running through {{the centre of the}} shell to convey the ignition flash from the time fuze in the nose to the gunpowder charge in the base.

40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Management Accountancy)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. The aim of {{this study}} was firstly to perform, from the {{existing}} literature, a SWOT ("Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats") analysis of the boerbok industry. Secondly, to design a case study where a number of management accounting evaluation techniques (i. e. performance measurement (short–term focus), capital investment evaluation (long–term focus) and risk have been identified to compare the financial results of different scenarios between boerbok, sheep and cattle farming. In the case study, Scenarios 1, 2 and 3 assumed a farm size of 200 hectares and capital available of R 200 000, R 500 000 and R 900 000, respectively. Scenarios 4, 5 and 6 assumed a farm size of 500 hectares, with the same capital as the above amounts, respectively; and Scenarios 7, 8 and 9 assumed a farm size of 900 hectares, with the same capital as the above amounts, respectively. The study concluded, from the SWOT analysis, that the boergoat inherently {{has the potential to be}} an important source of red meat in future markets. The sum total of the management accounting techniques indicated that the boerbok is in general financially the best specimen choice for farming, e. g. in seven of the nine scenarios it has the highest score. The recommendation is that the user must determine which of performance (short–term), return on capital (long–term) or risk are the most important considerations before a decision is made regarding to the choice of preferred specimen. The study's recommendation is to select boerbok farming in case both short–term financial performance and long–term return on capital are the most important factors. If risk is the major consideration, cattle farming should be selected. If the overall financial analysis outlined in the study is considered, boerbok farming should be selected, followed by sheep farming. Note that these recommendations are made for specific scenarios; therefore, the general recommendation is that each decision–maker should take his/her own unique situation's variables into account in this financial analysis. The limitations of the study, which arose because a number of assumptions were made, are as follows: The results of the investigation are only valid for the Potchefstroom and surrounding areas and, carrying capacity, based on this area's average, may even differ in the area; Dosage is based on the needs of the environment as in January 2011; Buying and selling prices are as at January 2011; The input costs for livestock handling infrastructure may differ, as farming practices and approaches differ; The physical shape of the farm could have a direct impact on the fencing expenditure; Lamb and calf growth percentages may vary as a result of different farming practices and approaches; and The combination of initial capital and farm size may influence the results. As a result of these constraints (assumptions), it is very risky to generalise, but the practical value of the study is that a Microsoft Excel programme was developed, which can be used for calculations, similar to calculations in this study, which is available at the following web address: [URL] Therefore, variables such as farm size, capital <b>available,</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity,</b> costs and prices can be changed for each unique scenario, and the results will be calculated accordingly. The contribution of this study is that it supports the decision regarding the choice between the types of red meat farming for several unique scenarios, because every land user can determine which of these species are recommended according to the different management accounting evaluation techniques. The value of the study is that it is the first attempt where the viability of three species of red meat farming is compared by means of a case study with different scenarios. The gap for further research that should be done is as follows: The number of evaluation techniques can be extended to give more substance to the results; The number of species in the comparison can be extended; An analysis of the behaviour of costs between the different scenarios can be done; and The optimal combination of farm size and capital available can be determined.

The research on <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of marine resource and environment has aroused the attention of scholars in recent years. William et al. <b>carried</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> research in the Marshall Islands based on the theory of island animal geography balance [15].

30|$|The {{coastline}} is {{not only}} the boundary line between the sea and the land, but also the transition zone from terrestrial ecosystem to marine ecosystem. It has biodiversity conservation, marine disaster protection, tourist leisure and entertainment, and other ecosystem service functions [1]. Most of the industry of iron and steel, petrochemical engineering, and mechanical manufacture transfer to coastline with global economic integrating in recent decades. This drives large-scale exploitation of the coastline with sea area reclamation, port construction, aquaculture, and other human activities. The exploitation changed coastline landscape and destroyed ecosystem service function of the coastline [2]. The conception of <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> in ecology comes from population ecology. The earliest <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> is the maximum number of individuals living in a specified condition [3]. Malthus introduced the <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> into human ecology and proposed that the resource and environment restrict the growth of population in the end of eighteenth century. Then, he established the basic framework of <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> research based on the logistics model of population <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> [4]. Park and Burgess gave the definition of <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> from the viewpoint of “capacity” and analyzed the relationship between the <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> and the <b>carrying</b> target in 1921 [5]. Hawden and Palmer transferred the expression of <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> from limited capacity to relative balance capacity based on theory of “balance quantity” and “environmental balance” [6]. The study on the <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of resource and environment was gradually rising from 1930 s; scholars carried a lot of research on land <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity,</b> water resource <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity,</b> tourist <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity,</b> environmental <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity,</b> etc. in agriculture area, typical watershed, wetland, natural reserve and other ecologically fragile areas, and created evaluation methods of net primary productivity estimation, ecological footprint, supply and demand balance, comprehensive index, and system models [7 – 9]. The <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> research has gradually developed from conception, theoretical analysis to practical application and provided policy guidance for solving problems such as population expansion, resource shortage, environmental pollution, and ecological destruction [10 – 13].|$|R

The sampling years of Wenzhou, Hangzhou and Ningbo contribution rates of land resource to synthetic <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> were grouped into three stages, {{and there were two}} milestones trends and changes in 1996 and 2004, respectively. This study demonstrated that geographic information system and relative <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of resources are effective for assessment of region sustainable development, and provide policy guidelines for decision-making...|$|R
40|$|The aims of this {{research}} were to examine environmental <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> analyzed based on aspects of spatial planning and eco-region. The result showed that Kulonprogo Regency has low value of environmental <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> and can only support as much as 79. 81 % of its total population. Analysis of variance showed significant difference of environmental <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of protected and cultivated area. The main factor among 12 variables determining the degree of environmental <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> is man-land ratio (contributed 39. 72 %). Priority {{should be given to}} 28 villages or 31. 81 % of the area with low environmental <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity.</b> Eco-region and spatial plan approaches in environmental management practice are also strongly recommended...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBased on {{research}} about structures of ecological system and <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of shallow mountain area, evaluation index system of ecological <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of shallow mountain area had been formed, {{as well as}} the relative principle about how to choose index layer and sub-index layer in index system, and then built the evaluation index system for ecological <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> and ecological stress, and constructed the evaluation model for ecological <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of shallow mountain area, which provide reference for sustainable development of shallow mountain area in Beijing...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{combined}} effects of periodically varying <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> and survival rate on populations. We show that our populations with constant recruitment functions do not experience either resonance or attenuance when either only the <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> or the survival rate is fluctuating. However, when both <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> and survival rate are fluctuating the populations experience either attenuance or resonance, depending on parameter regimes. In addition, {{we show that}} our populations with Beverton– Holt recruitment functions experience attenuance when only the <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> is fluctuating...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{simulated}} dog {{population dynamics}} for a thirty-years period using a logistic growth model. Through sensitivity analyses, we determined {{the influence of}} the parameters used in the model. <b>Carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> was the most influential parameter in all simulations. In the owned-dog population, the influence of immigration, abandonment and births was 19 %, 16 % and 6 % of {{the influence of the}} <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity,</b> respectively. In the sterilized owned-dog population, the influence of abandonment, female and male sterilization was 37 %, 30 % and 27 % of the influence of the <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity.</b> In the stray population, the influence of abandonment, <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of the owned-dog population and adoption was 10 %, 9 % and 6 % of the influence of the <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity.</b> In the sterilized stray population, the influence of births, female sterilization and male sterilization was 45 %, 15 % and 13 % of the influence of the <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity.</b> Other parameters had lower influence values. Modification of the <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> requires different interventions for the owned- and stray-dog populations. Dog trade control is a way to reduce immigration. The evaluation of sterilization effects must focus on the variations in the infertile population fraction. Adoption may improve the effects of the reduction in <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> on the stray-dog population...|$|R
