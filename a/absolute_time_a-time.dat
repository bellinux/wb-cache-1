Although the Newtonian model of <b>absolute</b> <b>time</b> has since been opposed and rejected in light of more recent scholarship, it still provides a way to study science with reference to time and understand the phenomena of time within the scientific tradition. According to this model, {{it is assumed that}} time runs at the same rate for all the observers in the universe, or in other words, the rate of time of each observer can be scaled to the <b>absolute</b> <b>time</b> by multiplying the rate by a constant. This concept of <b>absolute</b> <b>time</b> suggests <b>absolute</b> simultaneity by the coincidence of two or more events at different points in space for all observers in the universe. So, <b>absolute</b> <b>time</b> has been discussed in two senses of absoluteness. In first sense, absoluteness means independent of events, while in second sense, it means independent of observer or frame of reference...|$|R

We found a small backward telescoping effect for recent news events and a large forward telescoping effect for remote events. Events dated in the <b>absolute</b> <b>time</b> format were more accurate than those dated in the relative time format. Furthermore, participants preferred to date news events with the relative time format and personal events with the <b>absolute</b> <b>time</b> format, as well as preferring to date remote events in the relative time format and recent events in the <b>absolute</b> <b>time</b> format...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} a new analysis of early {{contributions to the}} development of the theory of absolute time-the notion that time exists independently of the presence or actions of material bodies and has no material cause. Though popularly attributed to Newton, I argue that this conception of time first appeared in medieval philosophy, as a solution to a peculiar theological problem generated by a widespread misrepresentation of Aristotle. I trace the subsequent evolution of the theory of <b>absolute</b> <b>time</b> through to the seventeenth-century, and argue that Newton, if anything, retreats from a full endorsement of the doctrine. Unlike <b>absolute</b> space, <b>absolute</b> <b>time</b> was absent from the philosophy of the Greeks, entering Western thought in the thirteenth century. <b>Absolute</b> <b>time</b> was first proposed as a negative thesis in response to a perceived irreconcilability between the popular theory of time, then seen as Aristotle's, that time was an attribute or effect of the motion of the primum mobile, and Biblical evidence from Joshua X 13, in which Joshua commands some heavenly motion to stop, but time continues. A pivotal moment in the development of theories of <b>absolute</b> <b>time</b> came at the close of the Scholastic period, in 1597, when the Jesuit philosopher Francisco Suarez built on these earlier ideas about time and proposed a theory of <b>absolute</b> <b>time</b> startlingly similar to the later absolutism of the neo-Epicurean atomistic philosophers. While Suarez's theory of time was dualistic, and he proposes one kind of time that is unmistakably Scholastic, his tempus imaginarius, which he describes as an infinitely extended immutable temporal flux that exists independently of material being, is very much of the early modern period. It is, however, in the work of Pierre Gassendi, the well known founder of seventeenth century neo-Epicurean atomism, that we see the first, and arguably the only, fully fledged theory of <b>absolute</b> <b>time.</b> Gassendi implanted <b>absolute</b> <b>time</b> into the Epicurean dualism of bodies and the void of absolute space. For Gassendi, time and space are truly absolute, and are ontologically prior to all other existing things-even God. Gassendi also removed the locus of God from changeless and atemporel extramundane eternity to our everyday world of change and decay, a radical move. I close the thesis with an investigation of the <b>absolute</b> <b>time</b> of Isaac Newton. Ironically, given that Newton is the most well-known absolutist, he in fact retreated from the true <b>absolute</b> <b>time</b> proposed by Gassendi, and instead described time as an affection of substance. For Newton however, following Henry More, this substance was not some mundane body or motion, but the spatially and temporally extended substance of God.

50|$|The {{concept of}} <b>absolute</b> <b>time</b> has far fewer {{attributes}} to specify than does absolute space. In <b>absolute</b> theory, <b>time</b> {{does not move}} with respect to space, nor can the axis of time be rotated. In <b>absolute</b> theory, <b>time</b> stands alone and is purely one-dimensional: it is the parameter that orders events. In absolute theory, a universal simultaneity is assumed, and provided that all observers have properly functioning measuring instruments they will all agree on what that universal simultaneity is. There is still some freedom to choose the origin of time (that point in time defined as t = 0) {{and there is also}} some freedom to determine the metric of time (such as seconds or minutes) but those are the only choices needed to arrive at a specific representation of <b>absolute</b> <b>time.</b>|$|R

40|$|For {{any given}} spacetime {{the choice of}} time {{coordinate}} is undetermined. A particular choice is the <b>absolute</b> <b>time</b> associated with a preferred vector field. Using the <b>absolute</b> <b>time</b> Hamilton’s equations are − δHc δq = ˙π + Θπ, + δHc δπ = ˙q, where Θ = V a.;a is {{the expansion of the}} vector field. Thus there is a hitherto unnoticed term in the expansion of the preferred vector field. Hamilton’s equations can be used to describe fluid motion. In this case the <b>absolute</b> <b>time</b> is the time associated with the fluid’s comoving vector. As measured by this <b>absolute</b> <b>time</b> the expansion term is present. Similarly in cosmology, each observer has a co-moving vector and Hamilton’s equations again have an expansion term. It is necessary to include the expansion term to quantize systems such as the above by the canonical method of replacing Dirac brackets by commutators. Hamilton’s equations in this form do not have a corresponding sympletic form. Replacing the expansion by a particle number N ≡ exp(− ∫ Θdτ) and introducing the particle numbers conjugate momentum π N the standard sympletic form can be recovered with two extra fields N and π N. Briefly the possibility of a non-standard sympletic form and the further possibility of there being a non-zero Finsler curvature corresponding to this are looked at. 2...|$|R
