Pursuant to that request, the Secretariat has prepared a research plan in collaboration with the international organizations enumerated above, {{as well as with the}} International Center fo...|$|E
40|$|To guide climate {{adaptation}} {{policies and}} investments, {{the majority of}} least developed countries (LDCs) have developed National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs). Agricultural biodiversity is an important, but often overlooked, element in climate adaptation; new crop varieties, cropping and farming systems will be important under future climates. This paper analyzes {{the extent to which}} <b>agricultural</b> <b>biological</b> <b>diversity</b> is included as part of national adaptation planning in the 50 NAPAs developed by LDCs as of December 2014. The paper presents an analytical framework that was used for the analysis of the NAPAs. It identifies 48 activities included in the NAPAs that do (or at least could) increase biodiversity in agricultural production systems or in research and development chains as part of strategies to adapt to climate change. These activities are clustered, first, by sectors (crops/forages, livestock, fisheries, forestry, agroforestry and natural resources) and then by biodiversity levels (genetic/intra-species, species and ecosystems). The highest concentration of activities was found in the combined crops/forages sector and at the ecosystem level. The analysis highlights that agricultural biodiversity is not incorporated within and across the NAPAs in a comprehensive manner, demonstrating {{that there is not a}} commonly adopted approach to integrating agricultural biodiversity into strategic planning. In light of these findings, one of the paper’s conclusions is that country teams developing national adaptation plans (NAPs) in the future would benefit from the guidelines for integrating genetic diversity considerations into climate change adaptation planning being considered by the Food and Agriculture Organization’s Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture during its fifteenth session in January 2015. Lessons learned from the NAPA development process are potentially valuable to countries that will be developing NAPs in the years to come.

40|$|Private {{rangeland}} near many Western {{cities is}} dis-appearing rapidly under {{an onslaught of}} suburban and “ranchette ” developments. As the “peopling of the New West” 1 continues unabated, alarms have been raised on two fronts: by rural citizens and conservation groups troubled {{by the loss of}} <b>agricultural</b> production and <b>biological</b> <b>diversity,</b> and by urban interests that lament the loss of open space and recreation opportunity. Some coun-ties and cities are taking steps to slow the rate of rangeland conversion by acquiring farms and ranches for use as open space, but that won’t do much to ease rural concerns unless concerted cooperative efforts are made to both reduce poten-tial confl icts over recreational and agricultural land uses and maintain rangeland landscapes that serve as more than just scenic backdrops for suburban lifestyles. Public Working Landscapes Many local governments are coping with the impacts of rapid growth by creating open space and natural area systems. Na-tionwide, state and local voters approved 75 % of the 217 open space ballot initiatives between 2004 – 2006, creating new tax-based revenue streams for the purchase of open space and natural areas or conservation easements. 2 This phenomenon has happened at a time when numerous other new tax pro-posals have been soundly defeated...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Over {{the last}} 50 years, the Europe's {{agricultural}} sector {{was supported by}} the commune agrarian policy (CAP). Although in the beginning the emphasis was on expanding farmland {{at the expense of the}} natural ecosystems and on an intensive agriculture in the existing farmland, in the last decades was understood also the need of nature conservation in parallel with the development of agriculture. This support has evolved alongside growing recognition and awareness of the strong links between <b>agricultural</b> production and <b>biological</b> <b>diversity</b> conservation. The Ecology development as science, mainly after the Odum approach, emphasized the role of natural ecosystems in natural capital conservation and biodiversity. Also the ecology studies conducted in the last two decades, have revealed and other services provided by the natural ecosystems besides the generated resources, that fixation carbon dioxide, the reduce diffuse pollution with nutrients, creation a local microclimate, etc The local microclimate created by natural vegetation areas near of the crops influences strongly the ecological functions of anthropogenic ecosystems, even the in the semi-natural ecosystems, important functions as cycles of nutrient and water (local water balance, nutrient balance and the production of biomass).
