2500|$|Joe Pesci didn't judge his {{character}} but found {{the scene where}} he kills Spider for talking back to {{his character}} hard to do, because he had trouble justifying the action until {{he forced himself to}} feel the way Tommy did. Lorraine Bracco found the shoot to be an emotionally difficult one because it was such a male-dominated cast, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> if she did not make her [...] "work important, it would probably end up on the cutting room floor". When it came to the relationship between Henry and Karen, Bracco saw no difference between an abused wife and her character.|$|E
2500|$|Moulton's {{imagination}} was fostered {{during her}} childhood. Her parents {{clung to the}} strictest Calvinistic principles. Games, dances, romances, were forbidden; and, as playmates were few, the child lived {{in a world of}} fancy. [...] "I was lonely," [...] she said, [...] "and I sought companions. What was there to do but to create them?" [...] Indeed, before she was eight years old, her active mind was creating a world of its own in a little unwritten play, which it pleased her fancy to call a Spanish drama, and with which she spent all summer, filling it with personages. The rigid Calvinism of the family had undoubtedly a very stimulating effect on the emotions of the sensitive child, and to its far-reaching influence may be ascribed the tinge of melancholy found in many of her pages. As a child, Moulton also exhibited a great vitality, especially when she was not burdened with the terrors of [...] "damnation". Running {{in the face of a}} great wind was one of her joys, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> the reverse of such emotion in listening to the sound of the wind through an outer keyhole, which seemed to her the calling of trumpets, the crying of lost souls.|$|E
2500|$|In 1917, {{she married}} Navy Commander Archibald Nelson Offley, (Archie), and had one child, Mary Yerkes Offley, born in 1918 and {{who died at}} the age of 15 from nephritis. The early married life to a naval officer found her {{transferred}} to several ports: Portsmouth, Virginia, in the East, and San Diego, Vallejo, Long Beach, and San Francisco, along the coast of California. They eventually took up permanent residence in San Mateo, California, in the 1930s. This time period saw the onset of the Great Depression <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> that a formal career in painting would be difficult: [...] "The Great Depression of the 1930s and the consequent lack of funds to patronize art severely affected the careers of many artists, both men and women." [...] A few artists during this time were lucky to find jobs through the Works Progress Administration's Federal Art Project in painting murals in public buildings, but for many artists their careers were crushed. This situation was confirmed by Yerkes' own journal, on one weekend’s journey to San Francisco from San Mateo in 1935. Yerkes had an appointment with the art director of Gump's Department Store. She left very discouraged because the director said [...] "nobody is buying art during these times". Their lifestyle was modest but far better than most [...] during this period with Offley's secure position at the Office of Censorship in the Navy. [...] Any free time and saved money went for putting gas in the car, to roam the countryside for her artistic exploration.|$|E
