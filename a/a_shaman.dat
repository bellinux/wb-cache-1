5|$|Banjo and Kazooie are {{occasionally}} {{aided by}} their friend Mumbo Jumbo, <b>a</b> <b>shaman</b> who can use magical powers to transform them into several creatures like a termite, a pumpkin, a bee, a walrus, and a crocodile. These transformations {{have their own}} special features and allow the player to access areas that were previously inaccessible. For instance, the walrus can resist the effects of icy-cold water.

5|$|Condor bones {{have been}} found in Native American graves, as have condor feather headdresses. Cave {{paintings}} of condors have also been discovered. Some tribes ritually killed condors to make ceremonial clothing out of their feathers. Shamans then danced while wearing these to reach the upper and lower spiritual worlds. Whenever <b>a</b> <b>shaman</b> died, his clothes were said to be cursed, so new clothing had to be made for his successor. Some scientists, such as Noel Snyder, believe that this process of making ceremonial clothing contributed to the condor's decline.|$|E
