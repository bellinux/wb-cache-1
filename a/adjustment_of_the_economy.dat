30|$|A {{second study}} by Druant et al. (2012) {{examines}} {{the frequency and}} character of wage and price increases and their interrelation. (Recall {{that the degree of}} wage and price rigidity determines the speed of <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> to macroeconomic shocks and with it the scale of the adjustment costs.) The authors’ examination of the speed with which firms change prices and wages indicates that the frequency of the latter is roughly one half that of the former—although both “series” display considerable time dependence. The overall stickiness of wages thus exceeds that of prices. The frequency of wage adjustment evinces lower dispersion across sectors, and higher dispersion across countries, than does the frequency of price adjustment. Coupled with widespread wage indexation, the implication of price and wage rigidity is real wage rigidity, which makes the <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> to aggregate shocks more costly. The authors’ cet. par. analysis of price and wage rigidity at the firm level indicates that prices are more flexible where competitive pressures in product markets are strong and where labor costs account for a smaller fraction of total costs. Wages are more flexible where bargaining is decentralized (being conducted at the firm level as opposed to the national/sectoral/regional level) and where the coverage of collective bargaining and the stringency of employment protection legislation are low. Finally, descriptive evidence is provided (e.g., on the comparable frequency of wage and price changes and the synchronization between the timing of wage and price changes) showing that wages and prices feed into each other at the firm level and that wage and price rigidity are interrelated especially in labor-intensive sectors.|$|E

While the estimates of the shoe-leather costs of long-run inflation (implied by this model) are generally consistent with previous studies, the article goes on to show that the transition between inflation rates can involve dynamics that alter the nature of these welfare effects.

We find that the undertaken PIT reform is unsustainable as it leads to permanent government budget deficits and ever increasing public debt. This result holds even allowing for endogenous reduction in tax evasion. After introducing permanent compensatory fiscal measures ensuring long-term sustainability of the PIT reduction, we demonstrate that the lower PIT produces higher output and lower prices in the long run. Higher domestic spending is supported by higher employment and after-tax wages. Moreover, following a reduction in the marginal production costs, producer prices fall enhancing economy’s international competitiveness and boosting domestic exports.
