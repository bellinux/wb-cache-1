5|$|The {{seasonal}} frosting {{of areas}} near the southern ice cap {{results in the}} formation of transparent 1-metre-thick slabs of dry ice above the ground. With the arrival of spring, sunlight warms the subsurface and pressure from subliming CO2 builds up under <b>a</b> <b>slab,</b> elevating and ultimately rupturing it. This leads to geyser-like eruptions of CO2 gas mixed with dark basaltic sand or dust. This process is rapid, observed happening {{in the space of a}} few days, weeks or months, a rate of change rather unusual in geology – especially for Mars. The gas rushing underneath <b>a</b> <b>slab</b> to the site of a geyser carves a spiderweb-like pattern of radial channels under the ice, the process being the inverted equivalent of an erosion network formed by water draining through a single plughole.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} the absorption coefficient of <b>a</b> transparent <b>slab,</b> which forms the outer layer of a roof/wall, on such factors as average thermal flux passing/through/a roof/wall, maximum and minimum values of this thermal flux and the thermal load levelling. It is seen that <b>a</b> non-completely transparent <b>slab</b> (non-zero absorption coefficient) performs slightly better than <b>a</b> completely transparent <b>slab</b> (zero absorption coefficient) for small thicknesses, as far as the average thermal flux through a roof/wall is concerned. <b>A</b> non-completely transparent <b>slab</b> with <b>an</b> absorption coefficient greater than 3 m- 1 is as effective as <b>a</b> completely transparent <b>slab</b> in introducing thermal load levelling. For both <b>a</b> non-completely transparent <b>slab</b> and <b>a</b> completely transparent <b>slab,</b> maximum, minimum and average values of the thermal flux increase with increasing thickness. ...|$|R

5|$|For {{many years}} Odontogriphus ("toothed riddle") was known from only one specimen, an almost featureless oval smear on <b>a</b> <b>slab,</b> with hints of tiny conical teeth. However, 189 new finds {{in the years}} {{immediately}} preceding 2006 made a detailed description possible. It had a pair of slightly V-shaped tooth-rows just ahead of the mouth, very like Wiwaxia′s. This pitched Odontogriphus {{into the middle of the}} debate about whether Wiwaxia was closer to the mollusc or the annelid lineage, resulting in a frank exchange of views.|$|E
5|$|Models of how Siletzia formed are of {{two general}} types: (1) Formation well {{offshore}} (possibly as seamounts, like the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain, or a hotspot at a spreading ridge, like Iceland) and then accretion to the continent; (2) formation inshore, {{on or near}} the continental margin (perhaps as a result of transcurrent extension, or of <b>a</b> <b>slab</b> window). All current models then have Siletzia rifting away from the continental edge about a northern pivot.|$|E
5|$|The {{western end}} of the chamber is closed off with <b>a</b> <b>slab</b> {{measuring}} about 4.42 metres (14 feet, 6 inches) wide, with a thickness of 30 centimetres (1 foot) and a depth of around 2.44 metres (8 feet). A collapsed, broken slab lies at the chamber's opening, eastern end. It {{is also possible that}} a largely rectangular slab {{at the bottom of the}} slope had once been part of the chamber's eastern end. Excavation has revealed that flint masonry was used to pack around the chamber and support its sarsens; 20th-century renovation has seen this largely replaced with cement, allowing the stones to continue standing upright.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{transient}} {{thermal stresses}} in <b>a</b> finite <b>slab</b> cooled by <b>a</b> linear moving coolant {{on the surface}} are measured by a strain gage. At the same time, the transient thermal stresses in <b>an</b> infinite <b>slab</b> heated by <b>a</b> linear moving heat source on the surface are theoretically analyzed. The industrial applicability of the theoretical results for <b>an</b> infinite <b>slab</b> is investigated by comparison of the theoretical results with the experimental ones...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{surface wave}} propagation in <b>a</b> grounded dielectric <b>slab</b> covered with <b>a</b> resistive sheet. Transcendental equations are derived for each polarization and are solved using iterative techniques. Attention and phase velocity are shown for a representative geometry. The results are applicable to both <b>a</b> grounded <b>slab</b> covered with <b>a</b> resistive sheet and <b>an</b> ungrounded <b>slab</b> covered {{on each side}} with a resistive sheet...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical investigation of power reflection and transmission coefficients for a meander-line polarizer placed periodically on <b>a</b> chiral <b>slab.</b> It {{is assumed that}} a linearly polarized transverse magnetic wave is incident on <b>a</b> chiral <b>slab</b> from the air region. In the analysis, we derive the electric and magnetic fields in the modal form {{in the air and}} chiral regions. We obtain power reflection and transmission coefficients in a straightforward manner after matching the tangential components of the electric and magnetic fields at the boundaries. We present numerical results for the power reflection and transmission coefficients versus frequency and incident angle for different values of the chirality admittance. A meander-line polarizer placed on <b>a</b> dielectric <b>slab</b> can convert <b>a</b> linearly polarized wave to a circularly polarized wave. The design parameters for a meander-line polarizer are the dimensions of the meander-line and the values of the dielectric <b>slab.</b> Replacing <b>a</b> dielectric <b>slab</b> with <b>a</b> chiral <b>slab</b> introduces <b>a</b> new independent parameter which controls the wave polarization...|$|R
5|$|They also {{expressed}} disbelief that slabs would split so smoothly, or that {{one half of}} <b>a</b> <b>slab</b> containing fossils would have good preservation, but not the counterslab. These are common properties of Solnhofen fossils, because the dead animals would fall onto hardened surfaces, which would form a natural plane for the future slabs to split along and would leave {{the bulk of the}} fossil on one side and little on the other.|$|E
5|$|Wells, et al., {{alternately}} {{suggested that}} as a terrane at {{the margin of the}} continent was pushed over the Yellowstone hotspot, it was rifted away from the continent by the upwelling magma, which then formed the Siletzia basalts. This idea was further developed by , who suggested rifting might have been initiated by a change in plate direction, or by kinematic effects as the Kula-Farallon ridge migrated along the continental margin. One such effect is the formation of <b>a</b> <b>slab</b> window (or slab gap) which would allow increased upwelling of magma.|$|E
5|$|After much discussion, Harrison, who {{coordinated the}} meetings, {{determined}} that a design based on Niemeyer's project 32 and Le Corbusier's project 23 would be developed for the final project. Le Corbusier's project 23 consisted of a large block containing both the Assembly Hall and the Council Chambers {{near the center of}} the site with the Secretariat tower emerging as <b>a</b> <b>slab</b> from the south. Niemeyer's plan was closer to that actually constructed, with a distinctive General Assembly building, a long low horizontal block housing the other meeting rooms, and a tall tower for the Secretariat. The complex as built, however, repositioned Niemeyer's General Assembly building to the north of this tripartite composition. This plan included a public plaza as well.|$|E

5|$|In 1885 Gaudí {{accepted}} a commission from Josep Maria Bocabella, promotor of the Sagrada Família, for an altar in the oratory of the Bocabella family, who had obtained {{permission from the}} Pope to have an altar in their home. The altar is made of varnished mahogany, with <b>a</b> <b>slab</b> of white marble in the centre for relics. It is decorated with plants and religious motifs, such as the Greek letters alpha and omega, symbol of the beginning and end, gospel phrases and images of Saint Francis of Paola, Saint Teresa of Avila and the Holy Family and closed with a curtain of crimson embroidery. It {{was made by the}} cabinet maker Frederic Labòria, who also collaborated with Gaudí on the Sagrada Família.|$|E
5|$|The first {{renovation}} in the 20thcentury {{occurred in}} 1922, when the Supreme Muslim Council under Amin al-Husayni (the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem) commissioned Turkish architect Ahmet Kemalettin Bey to restore al-Aqsa Mosque and the monuments in its precincts. The council also commissioned British architects, Egyptian engineering experts {{and local officials}} to contribute to and oversee the repairs and additions which were carried out in 1924–25 by Kemalettin. The renovations included reinforcing the mosque's ancient Umayyad foundations, rectifying the interior columns, replacing the beams, erecting a scaffolding, conserving the arches and drum of the main dome's interior, rebuilding the southern wall, and replacing timber in the central nave with <b>a</b> <b>slab</b> of concrete. The renovations also revealed Fatimid-era mosaics and inscriptions on the interior arches that had been covered with plasterwork. The arches were decorated with gold and green-tinted gypsum and their timber tie beams were replaced with brass. A quarter of the stained glass windows also were carefully renewed so as to preserve their original Abbasid and Fatimid designs. Severe damage {{was caused by the}} 1837 and 1927 earthquakes, but the mosque was repaired in 1938 and 1942.|$|E
5|$|After {{visiting the}} near-ruined town of Melmond, the Light Warriors {{go to the}} Earth Cave to defeat a vampire and {{retrieve}} the Star Ruby, which gains passage to Sage Sadda's cave. With Sadda's Rod, the Warriors venture deeper into the Earth Cave and destroy the Earth Fiend, Lich. The Light Warriors then obtain a canoe and enter Gurgu Volcano and defeat the Fire Fiend, Kary. The Levistone from the nearby Ice Cave allows them to raise an airship to reach the northern continents. After they prove their courage by retrieving the Rat's Tail from the Castle of Ordeal, the King of the Dragons, Bahamut, promotes each Light Warrior. A kind gesture is repaid by a fairy, receiving special liquid that produces oxygen, and the Warriors use it to help defeat the Water Fiend, Kraken, in the Sunken Shrine. They also recover <b>a</b> <b>Slab,</b> which allows a linguist named Dr. Unne to teach them the Lefeinish language. The Lefeinish give the Light Warriors access to the Floating Castle that Tiamat, the Wind Fiend, has taken over. With the Four Fiends defeated and the Orbs restored, a portal opens in the Temple of Fiends which takes them 2000 years into the past. There the Warriors discover that the Four Fiends sent Garland (now the archdemon Chaos) {{back in time and}} he sent the Fiends to the future to do so, creating a time loop by which he could live forever. The Light Warriors defeat Chaos, thus ending the paradox, and return home. By ending the paradox, however, the Light Warriors have changed the future to one where their heroic deeds remain unknown outside of legend.|$|E
