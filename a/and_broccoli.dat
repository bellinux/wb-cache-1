5|$|After {{several months}} of {{speculation}} as to the release date, Wilson <b>and</b> <b>Broccoli</b> officially announced on 20 July 2006, that the follow-up film, Quantum of Solace, was to be released on 7 November 2008, and that Craig would play Bond with an option for a third film. On 25 October 2007, MGM CEO Harry Sloan revealed at the Forbes Meet II Conference that Craig had signed on to make four more Bond films, through to Bond 25.|$|E
5|$|To {{develop a}} better feel of how Voodoo was practised, Saltzman <b>and</b> <b>Broccoli</b> escorted Hamilton, Mankiewicz and {{production}} designer Syd Cain to scout New Orleans further {{and then the}} islands of the West Indies. Haiti was an important destination of the tour and not only did Fleming connect it with the religion, there were many practitioners available to witness. Despite viewing actual demonstrations, due to political unrest {{in the country at}} the time, it was decided not to film in Haiti.|$|E
5|$|When {{the time}} came to begin You Only Live Twice, the {{producers}} were faced with the problem of a disenchanted star. Sean Connery had stated that he was tired of playing James Bond and all of the associated commitment (time spent filming and publicising each movie), together with finding it difficult to do other work, which would potentially lead to typecasting. Saltzman <b>and</b> <b>Broccoli</b> were able to persuade Connery by increasing his fee for the film, but geared up to look for a replacement.|$|E

5|$|Helicoverpa zea {{has a wide}} host range, attacking {{vegetables}} that include corn, tomato, artichoke, asparagus, cabbage, cantaloupe, collards, cowpea, cucumber, eggplant, lettuce, lima bean, melon, okra, pea, pepper, potato, pumpkin, snap bean, spinach, squash, sweet potato, and watermelon. However, {{not all of these}} are good hosts. While corn and lettuce are shown to be great hosts, tomatoes are less beneficial, <b>and</b> <b>broccoli</b> and cantaloupe are poor hosts. Corn and sorghum are most favored by corn earworms. Various signs reveal the presence of these moths. Young maize crops have holes in their leaves, following whorl-feeding on the apical leaf. Eggs can be found on silks on larger plants, and silks display grazing evidence. The soft, milky grains in the top few centimeters of corn cobs are eaten as the corn ears develop. One larva per cob can be observed. Bore holes are observed in cabbage and lettuce hearts, flower heads, cotton bolls, and tomato fruits. Sorghum heads are grazed, and legume pod seeds are eaten.|$|E

50|$|The Red Beret is {{the fictional}} {{story about an}} American who enlists in the British Parachute Regiment in 1940, {{claiming}} to be a Canadian. It is notable as the first film made by Irving Allen <b>and</b> Albert R. <b>Broccoli's</b> Warwick Films, {{with many of the}} crew later working on various films for Warwick Films <b>and</b> <b>Broccoli's</b> Eon Productions. It is partly based on the 1950 non-fiction book with the same title written by Hilary Saint George Saunders, about the Parachute Regiment and its first operation, Operation Biting, in February 1942.|$|R
25|$|After a {{slow start}} commercially, by August 1861 the {{directors}} of the company recorded their pleasure that large volumes of fish, potatoes <b>and</b> <b>broccoli</b> had been carried from West Cornwall. This had been transported to Truro by the West Cornwall Railway which had a line from Penzance to Truro; the West Cornwall company was a narrow gauge line, and all goods had to be transshipped into different wagons at Truro due to the break of gauge there.|$|E
25|$|Cheese slaw is {{prepared}} using grated cheese, crumbled or cubed cheese, grated carrot, and a mayonnaise dressing. Cheese slaw {{is very similar}} to some coleslaw recipes, but is distinguished by the inclusion of cheese. Cheddar cheese is typically used in the salad's preparation, although other cheeses such as blue and Swiss are sometimes used. It often does not contain cabbage, as per coleslaw, although cabbage is occasionally used. Cheese slaw may contain other vegetables, such as chives, spring onions, shallots, parsley, <b>and</b> <b>broccoli.</b>|$|E
25|$|Like much of {{the rest}} of the country, farmers in Penwith have in recent years been put under {{financial}} pressure, due to a withdrawal of subsidies from the EU Common Agricultural Policy, pressure from supermarkets and crises such as foot and mouth in 2001. Agriculture in Penwith is predominantly dairy with some arable crops such as potatoes, cauliflower <b>and</b> <b>broccoli</b> (confusingly these are locally called broccoli and calebrese, respectively). Cornwall's mild climate and an absence of hard winter frosts mean that these cold-sensitive crops can be produced much earlier than in the rest of the country, and early Cornish new potatoes are a lucrative source of income. Unfortunately this cash crop has come under pressure in recent years due to globalization, which means competition with cheap imports from Egypt.|$|E
50|$|Irving Allen <b>and</b> Albert R. <b>Broccoli's</b> Warwick Films had {{previously}} {{had a successful}} financing and distribution arrangement with Columbia Pictures, but there was occasionally friction between the two organisations. Allen thought they would increase their profits by creating their own distribution company to release films of a more highbrow nature than their successful action films. The two acquired Eros from the Hyams brothers in 1959, though the brothers remained on the board. Eros distributed Allen <b>and</b> <b>Broccoli's</b> The Trials of Oscar Wilde and Johnny Nobody, but both films failed at the box office.|$|R
5000|$|Albert Romolo Broccoli (April 5, 1909 - June 27, 1996), nicknamed [...] "Cubby," [...] was an American film {{producer}} who {{made more than}} 40 motion pictures throughout his career. Most of the films {{were made in the}} United Kingdom and often filmed at Pinewood Studios. Co-founder of Danjaq, LLC <b>and</b> Eon Productions, <b>Broccoli</b> is most notable as the producer of many of the James Bond films. He and Harry Saltzman saw the films develop from relatively low-budget origins to large-budget, high-grossing extravaganzas, <b>and</b> <b>Broccoli's</b> heirs continue to produce new Bond films.|$|R
50|$|Michael Wilson {{worked his}} way up through the {{production}} company to co-write <b>and</b> co-produce. Barbara <b>Broccoli,</b> in her turn, served in several capacities under her father's tutelage from the 1980s on. Wilson <b>and</b> Barbara <b>Broccoli</b> have co-produced the films since the elder Broccoli's death.|$|R
25|$|Another {{study from}} Zhejiang University {{examined}} the nutritional value of broccoli after five common cooking techniques; steaming, boiling, microwaving, stir-frying and stir-frying followed by deep frying. The {{study found that}} the two most common methods of home cooking in China, stir-frying and stir-frying combined with deep frying in soybean oil, resulted in a much greater loss of chlorophyll, soluble protein, soluble sugar and vitamin C. The method which affected these values the least was steaming. Stir frying for five minutes and stir frying combined with boiling caused the highest loss of glucosinolates which according to this study are best preserved by steaming. A study performed by the Spanish National Research Counsel stir fried the broccoli for only 3 minutes 30 seconds and found that nutritional value of these broccoli samples varied depending on which cooking oil was used. Comparing these results to an uncooked sample, the study found that phenolics and vitamin C were reduced more than glucosinolates and minerals. Stir-frying with soybean, peanut, safflower or extra virgin olive did not reduce glucosinolates, <b>and</b> <b>broccoli</b> stir-fried with extra virgin olive oil or sunflower oil had vitamin C levels similar to uncooked broccoli. These levels were significantly lower with other edible oils.|$|E
500|$|In 1959 {{producer}} Albert R. [...] "Cubby" [...] Broccoli at Warwick Films {{expressed interest}} in adapting the Bond novels, but his colleague Irving Allen was unenthusiastic. In June 1961 Fleming sold a six-month option on the film rights to his published and future James Bond novels and short stories to Harry Saltzman, {{with the exception of}} Casino Royale, which he had previously sold. Towards the end of Saltzman's option period, screenwriter Wolf Mankowitz introduced him to Broccoli, and Saltzman <b>and</b> <b>Broccoli</b> formed Eon Productions with the intention of making the first Bond film. A number of Hollywood studios did not want to fund the films, finding them [...] "too British" [...] or [...] "too blatantly sexual". Eventually the two signed a deal with United Artists for 100 per cent financial backing and distribution of seven films, with financing of $1million for the first feature. Saltzman <b>and</b> <b>Broccoli</b> also created the company Danjaq, which was to hold the rights to the films which Eon Productions was to produce.|$|E
500|$|This was {{the only}} Bond film until 2006 not to feature 'Q', played at this stage by Desmond Llewelyn. He was then {{appearing}} in the TV series Follyfoot, but was written out of three episodes {{to appear in the}} film. By then, Saltzman <b>and</b> <b>Broccoli</b> decided not to include the character, feeling that [...] "too much was being made of the films' gadgets", and decided to downplay this aspect of the series, much to Llewelyn's annoyance.|$|E
50|$|Danjaq S.A. {{was founded}} by Albert R. <b>Broccoli</b> <b>and</b> Harry Saltzman {{after the release of}} the first James Bond film Dr. No, in 1962, to ensure all future films in the series. The new company was to be called Danjaq, a {{combination}} of <b>Broccoli</b> <b>and</b> Saltzman's respective wives' names (Dana <b>Broccoli</b> <b>and</b> Jacqueline Saltzman). In 1962, Danjaq began its association with United Artists.|$|R

500|$|Chaim Topol {{was cast}} {{following}} a suggestion by Broccoli's wife Dana, while Julian Glover joined the {{cast as the}} producers felt he was stylish – Glover was even considered to play Bond at some point, but Michael G. Wilson stated that [...] "when we first thought of him he was too young, {{and by the time}} of For Your Eyes Only he was too old". Carole Bouquet was a suggestion of United Artists publicist Jerry Juroe, and after Glen <b>and</b> <b>Broccoli</b> saw her in That Obscure Object of Desire, they went to Rome to invite Bouquet for the role of Melina.|$|E
500|$|The novel On Her Majesty's Secret Service {{was first}} {{published}} after the film series started and contains [...] "a gentle dig at the cinematic Bond's gadgets, Broccoli and Saltzman had originally intended to make On Her Majesty's Secret Service after Goldfinger and Richard Maibaum worked on a script at that time. However, Thunderball was filmed instead after the ongoing rights dispute over the novel were settled between Fleming and Kevin McClory. On Her Majesty's Secret Service was due to follow that, but problems with a warm Swiss winter and inadequate snow cover led to Saltzman <b>and</b> <b>Broccoli</b> postponing the film again, favouring production of You Only Live Twice.|$|E
500|$|Jan Werich was {{originally}} cast by producer Harry Saltzman to play Blofeld. Upon his {{arrival at the}} Pinewood set, both producer Albert R. Broccoli and director Lewis Gilbert {{felt that he was}} a poor choice, resembling a [...] "poor, benevolent Santa Claus". Nonetheless, in an attempt to make the casting work, Gilbert continued filming. After several days, both Gilbert <b>and</b> <b>Broccoli</b> determined that Werich was not menacing enough, and recast Blofeld with Donald Pleasence in the role. Pleasence's ideas for Blofeld's appearance included a hump, a limp, a beard, and a lame hand, before he settled on the scar. He found it uncomfortable, though, because of the glue that attached it to his eye.|$|E

Rapini, sometimes called [...] "broccoli raab" [...] among other names, forms similar but smaller heads, and {{is actually a}} type of turnip (Brassica rapa). [...] Broccolini or [...] "Tenderstem broccoli" [...] is a cross between <b>broccoli</b> <b>and</b> Chinese <b>broccoli.</b> Beneforté is a variety of broccoli containing 2–3 times more glucoraphanin that was produced by crossing broccoli with a wild Brassica variety, Brassica oleracea var villosa.|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} to utilize brassica harvest residue and processing waste to add-value and /or to eliminate environmental concerns through fermentation was investigated. Some physicochemical properties (moisture, protein, ash, acid detergent fibre, vitamin C, total phenolic and amino acids contents, acidity and shear and compression forces) for <b>broccoli</b> <b>and</b> cauliflower stalks {{before and after}} fermentation were measured. Considerable vitamin C and total phenolics concentrations were found in fresh <b>broccoli</b> <b>and</b> cauliflower stalks. Fermentation decreased (P < 0. 001) vitamin C concentration to about 55 % of that found in fresh stalks of <b>broccoli</b> <b>and</b> cauliflower and decreased (P < 0. 001) total phenolics concentrations (by 15 % and 28 % for <b>broccoli</b> <b>and</b> cauliflower, respectively). The results from the sensory analysis indicated that the fermented <b>broccoli</b> <b>and</b> cauliflower stalks may be successful as condiment products for consumers familiar with fermented products...|$|R
500|$|Screenwriter Richard Maibaum, {{who worked}} on the first four Bond films, {{returned}} as script writer.

500|$|The {{maintenance}} dose of warfarin can fluctuate significantly {{depending on the}} amount of vitamin K1 in the diet. Keeping vitamin K1 intake at a stable level can prevent these fluctuations. Leafy green vegetables tend to contain higher amounts of vitamin K1. Green parts of members of the family Apiaceae, such as parsley, cilantro, and dill, are extremely rich sources of vitamin K; cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage <b>and</b> <b>broccoli,</b> as well as the darker varieties of lettuces and other leafy greens, are also relatively high in vitamin K1. Green vegetables such a peas and green beans do not have such high amounts of vitamin K1 as leafy greens. Certain vegetable oils have high amounts of vitamin K1. [...] Foods low in vitamin K1 include roots, bulbs, tubers, and most fruits and fruit juices. Cereals, grains and other milled products are also low in vitamin K1.|$|E
50|$|In 1986, Albert <b>and</b> Dana <b>Broccoli</b> {{acquired}} United Artists' 50% {{stake in}} the company and so assumed complete control of Danjaq.
