40|$|International audienceThe {{subject of}} {{structural}} health monitoring {{is emerging as}} an increasingly important component of overall nondestructive evaluation programs. Presently, vibration-based and contact <b>acoustic</b> <b>emission</b> <b>techniques</b> {{have been widely used}} for structural health monitoring. Both vibration-based and <b>acoustic</b> <b>emission</b> <b>techniques</b> require attaching transducers to structures. In many applications, such as those involving hot structural materials for thermal protection purposes or in rotating machines, non-contact measurements would be preferred because the operating environment is prohibitive leading to potential damage in contact sensors or their attachments. There are some examples of optical techniques, such as laser-based techniques that do not require contact measurements but these non-contact methods are very expensive with respect to hardware and computational effort. In such cases, non-contact acoustics techniques are a very attractive option for determining the location and extend of damage in the structure. In this paper, a new method of SHM using acoustic pressure response is proposed. In the proposed method, the acoustic pressure responses are used to obtain vibro-acoustic mode shapes of the vibrating structure, which are subsequently used for damage detection of the structure. The proposed acoustic-based SHM facilitates less expensive acoustic field measurements and fast data processing. In total, this will lead to an online structural health monitoring system...|$|R
40|$|The {{inspection}} of bridges is currently made by visual inspection or by wired sensor techniques, which are relatively expensive, vulnerable to damage, and time consuming to install. In contrast, {{wireless sensor networks}} are easy to deploy and flexible in application so that the network can adjust to the individual structure. Different sensing techniques {{can be used with}} such a network, but <b>acoustic</b> <b>emission</b> <b>techniques</b> have been rarely utilized. With the use of <b>acoustic</b> <b>emission</b> (AE) <b>techniques</b> it is possible to detect internal structural damage from cracks propagating during the routine use of a structure or the break of wires of prestressed elements for example. Most of the existing AE data analysis techniques are not appropriate for the requirements of a wireless network, especially regarding power consumption, memory storage or time synchronization. New algorithms have been developed using a new concept called <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Emission</b> Array Processing. As a first step, beamforming and source discrimination techniques were tested as well as a method based on a modified velocity spectral (VESPA) process. Traditional signalbased <b>acoustic</b> <b>emission</b> <b>techniques</b> include a two or three-dimensional localization of AE events based on the time difference of arrival (TDOA) technique using at least eight sensors that have to be placed well-distributed around the hypocenter, i. e. the AE source. The array concept allows for much simpler localization techniques with less hard- and software efforts. The beamforming method calculates the azimuth of the waves impinging on a small array of sensors by steering the beam through a range of azimuths until the steered delays match the observed time delays. This formulation operates under a different set of assumptions than the TDOA method and does not require the determination of any P wave arrival times. In fact, it doesn’t require the detection of a P wave at all. The direction of arrival can be determined simply from the relative time delays of Rayleigh waves (R-waves) ...|$|R
