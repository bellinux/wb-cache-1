Mackworth had made clear, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> to do, that the main {{consideration}} in handling dissent at Shrewsbury was state security.

25|$|For the film's poster, Universal brought Campbell in to {{take several}} {{reference}} head shots {{and asked him to}} strike a sly look on his face. They showed him a rough of the Frank Frazetta-like painting. The actor had a day to approve it or, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>told,</b> there would be no ad campaign for the film. Raimi ran into further troubles when the MPAA gave it an NC-17 rating for a shot of a female Deadite being decapitated early on in the film. Universal wanted a PG-13 rating, so Raimi made a few cuts and was still stuck with an R rating. In response, Universal turned the film over to outside film editors who cut the film to 81 minutes and another version running 87 minutes that was eventually released in theaters, still with an R rating.|$|E

500|$|At a {{performance}} in New Zealand in February 2010, Fiasco performed new {{material from the}} then-titled We Are Lasers for the first time. [...] He claimed that the album was complete and waiting for a release date from his label, Atlantic Records. [...] However, Atlantic feared that the record lacked commercial singles, and presented Fiasco with songs the label wanted him to record. [...] Fiasco declined, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> {{he would not have}} any ownership of the songs. [...] He explained, [...] "I don't think the label cares about an album...People just want their number-one record." [...] For six months, the cause of the album's delay remained unclear to the public. [...] In response, Fiasco's fans created an online petition demanding that Atlantic Records release Lasers. The petition garnered considerable attention on hip hop blog sites as well as over 16,000 signatures. [...] Fiasco stated that the petition [...] "brought [...] to tears", and in response to the petition, Fiasco released a song titled [...] "B.M.F-Building Minds Faster" [...] to thank his fans.|$|E

New captain Kevin Curran was suspended for striking Austen on the first occasion Hawthorn and Austen’s new club Richmond played.|$|E
2500|$|The Third Battle of Ypres {{caused the}} British far fewer {{casualties}} than the Battle of the Somme and the substantial {{success of the}} occupation of the ridges around Ypres, {{the first stage of}} the offensive strategy and inflicted comparable losses on the Germans, who were far less capable of replacing losses and which contributed to their defeat in 1918. When he asked the Canadian Corps commander, Arthur Currie, to capture Passchendaele Ridge during the final month of the battle, Currie flatly replied [...] "It's suicidal.

2500|$|By {{the time}} of the third season in 1965, however, some {{difficulties}} were beginning to arise. Lambert had moved on, to be replaced as producer by John Wiles, who did not have a good working relationship with Hartnell. The lead actor himself was finding it increasingly difficult to remember his lines as he was suffering from {{the early stages of the}} arteriosclerosis that would later cause his death. Wiles and Tosh came up with a way of writing Hartnell out in the story The Celestial Toymaker, by having the Doctor made invisible for part of the story, intending that when he re-appeared he would be played by a new actor. However, Wiles was forbidden to replace Hartnell by the new Head of Serials, Gerald Savory. Wiles had also hoped to make other bold changes, such as introducing a companion with a cockney accent (which was vetoed, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> all characters must speak [...] "BBC English"), and resigned shortly afterwards (allegedly after learning that he would be sacked at the end of the season), with Tosh also resigning on principle.|$|E

2500|$|Domitius {{was closely}} related to several notable figures who would {{dominate}} the Roman Empire during the 1st century. Suetonius describes him as ‘despicable and dishonest’. Suetonius says that as a young man, Domitius was serving {{on the staff of}} his second cousin Gaius Caesar in the East, but this seems odd because Domitius appears to have been born ca. 2 BC, and Gaius went East in AD 2. Gaius was a son of Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and Julia the Elder, daughter of Augustus. Domitius fortified their friendship by killing his freedman for refusing to drink as much <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>told.</b> The reported reason was that the freedman did not get as drunk as Domitius did. On the Appian Way, Domitius was reported of having deliberately run over a child who was playing with his doll. At the Roman Forum, Domitius reportedly pulled out an eye of an equestrian because the equestrian openly criticized him. [...] Gaius Stern claims that the Eastern expedition is actually that of Germanicus in AD 17-19, in keeping with the late birth date ca. 2 BC.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} day, July 1, {{turned out}} to be Huger's last fight with the Army of Northern Virginia as well as his final field command in the American Civil War. His division was directed toward the Union forces on Malvern Hill without a definite target, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> that Lee would [...] "place him where most needed" [...] against the position. Because Magruder had mistakenly led his command away from the battle, Huger took up his place on the Confederate right, just north of the [...] "Crew House", with the division of Maj. Gen. D.H. Hill on his left. To give his infantry a chance to charge and break the Union line, Lee ordered a concentrated artillery barrage at Malvern Hill. One of Huger's brigades, led by Brig. Gen. Lewis Armistead, was to determine when this barrage had the desired effect and begin the assault. Before the cannonade could begin however, the Union artillery fired first and took out most of the Confederate guns. Shortly after 2:30p.m. Armistead went in anyway, and though his men made some progress he failed to penetrate the strong defensive position. Other Confederate units made less progress and took heavy casualties, and around 4 p.m. Magruder arrived and put in two brigadesabout a third of his commandbehind Armistead, but he too retired with high loss. Two more of Huger's brigadesled by Brig. Gen. Ambrose R. Wright and Mahone, about 2,500 menfollowed Armistead and toward Malvern Hill. Taking Union artillery and infantry fire as they advanced, Huger's men slowed and then stopped, finding a measure of protection in a nearby bluff. They had fought to about [...] of the Union line but could go no further. Huger's last brigade under Brig. Gen. Robert Ransom managed to get within [...] by 6 p.m. but also fell back after receiving heavy casualties in the Confederate defeat.|$|E

5000|$|The comic {{effect of}} his style results partly from the {{juxtaposition}} of broad slang with mock-pomposity. Women, when not [...] "dolls", [...] "Judies", [...] "pancakes", [...] "tomatoes", or [...] "broads", may be [...] "characters of a female nature", for example. He typically avoided contractions such as [...] "don't" [...] in the example above, which also contributes significantly to the humorously pompous effect. In one sequence, a gangster tells another character to do <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>told,</b> or else [...] "find another world in which to live".|$|R
