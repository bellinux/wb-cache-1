25|$|The Craterostigmomorpha are {{the least}} diverse {{centipede}} clade, comprising only two extant species, both in the genus Craterostigmus. Their geographic range is restricted to Tasmania and New Zealand. They have a distinct body plan; their <b>anamorphosis</b> comprises a single stage: in their first moult, they grow from having 12 segments to having 15. Their low diversity and intermediate position between the primitive anamorphic centipedes and the derived Epimorpha has led to them being likened to the platypus. They represent the survivors of a once diverse clade.|$|E

2500|$|Artists who design <b>anamorphosis</b> (<b>anamorphosis</b> is Greek for [...] "re-transformation") {{play with}} {{perspective}} {{to create a}} distorted image that appears normal only when viewed from the correct angle or {{with the aid of}} curved mirrors. The technique was often used by Renaissance-era artists. Orosz tries to renew the technique of <b>anamorphosis</b> and his aim is to develop it as well when he gives a meaning to the distorted image, too. It is not an amorph picture any more, but a meaningful depiction that is independent from the result that appears in the mirror or viewed from a special point of view.|$|E

40|$|Today, <b>anamorphoses</b> are {{increasingly}} {{used in the}} field of Graphic & Architectural Design. The construction methods of <b>anamorphoses</b> have not changed since those theorized and used by the first treatise writers in 1600. A comparison between some of the existing procedures, based on the use of new technologies, and the theoretical concepts of the past shows that little or nothing has changed from a conceptual point of view. Those who make <b>anamorphoses</b> these days still follow, for example, the indications taken from Niceron’s studies, even though this task is made easier by the use of computers and video projectors. Some researchers have also developed software programs to facilitate the transformation/anamorphic deformation, although they did so mostly for their personal interest rather than to follow an input given by research bodies. The final objective of the study is to understand the possible further developments of <b>anamorphoses</b> {{in the field of}} Graphic & Architectural Design. In other words, the way reverse perspective is used, not only as a subject matter that is taught and explored at a theoretical and academic level, but as a living matter, with which one can have a dialogue to achieve those results that have always fascinated both researchers and the beneficiaries of the works inherited from the past up to our days...|$|R
