25|$|Hysterectomy can be {{performed}} in different ways. The oldest known technique is <b>abdominal</b> <b>incision.</b> Subsequently the vaginal (performing the hysterectomy through the vaginal canal) and later laparoscopic vaginal (with additional instruments inserted through a small hole, frequently close to the navel) techniques were developed.|$|E
30|$|Traditionally, {{hysterectomy}} {{is carried}} out through the <b>abdominal</b> <b>incisions</b> or through vagina. Laparoscopic hysterectomy involves removing the uterus, and sometimes the tubes and ovaries through smaller <b>abdominal</b> <b>incisions.</b>|$|R

25|$|Surgical {{removal of}} the prostate, or prostatectomy, is a common {{treatment}} either for early stage prostate cancer or for cancer that has {{failed to respond to}} radiation therapy. The most common type is radical retropubic prostatectomy, when the surgeon removes the prostate through an <b>abdominal</b> <b>incision.</b> Another type is radical perineal prostatectomy, when the surgeon removes the prostate through an incision in the perineum, the skin between the scrotum and anus. Radical prostatectomy can also be performed laparoscopically, through a series of small (1cm) incisions in the abdomen, with or without the assistance of a surgical robot.|$|E
25|$|Caesarean section can be {{performed}} with single or double layer suturing of the uterine incision. Single layer closure compared with double layer closure has been observed to result in reduced blood loss during the surgery. It is uncertain whether this is the direct effect of the suturing technique or if other {{factors such as the}} type and site of <b>abdominal</b> <b>incision</b> contribute to reduced blood loss. Standard procedure includes the closure of the peritoneum. However, research questions this may not be needed, with some studies indicating peritoneal closure is associated with longer operative time and hospital stay. The Misgave Ladach method is a surgery technical that may have fewer secondary complications and faster healing, due to the insertion into the muscle.|$|E
25|$|Most hysterectomies in the United States {{are done}} via {{laparotomy}} (<b>abdominal</b> <b>incision,</b> {{not to be}} confused with laparoscopy). A transverse (Pfannenstiel) incision is made through the abdominal wall, usually above the pubic bone, as close to the upper hair line of the individual's lower pelvis as possible, similar to the incision made for a caesarean section. This technique allows physicians the greatest access to the reproductive structures and is normally done for removal of the entire reproductive complex. The recovery time for an open hysterectomy is 4–6 weeks and sometimes longer due to the need to cut through the abdominal wall. Historically, the biggest problem with this technique was infections, but infection rates are well-controlled and not a major concern in modern medical practice. An open hysterectomy provides the most effective way to explore the abdominal cavity and perform complicated surgeries. Before the refinement of the vaginal and laparoscopic vaginal techniques it was also the only possibility to achieve subtotal hysterectomy, meanwhile vaginal route is the preferable technique in most circumstances.|$|E

25|$|The Misgav Ladach {{method is}} a {{modified}} caesarean section {{which has been}} used nearly {{all over the world}} since the 1990s. It was described by Michael Stark, the president of the New European Surgical Academy, {{at the time he was}} the director of Misgav Ladach, a general hospital in Jerusalem. The method was presented during a FIGO conference in Montréal in 1994 and then distributed by the University of Uppsala, Sweden, in more than 100 countries. This method is based on minimalistic principles. He examined all steps in caesarean sections in use, analyzed them for their necessity and, if found necessary, for their optimal way of performance. For the <b>abdominal</b> <b>incision</b> he used the modified Joel Cohen incision and compared the longitudinal abdominal structures to strings on musical instruments. As blood vessels and muscles have lateral sway, it is possible to stretch rather than cut them. The peritoneum is opened by repeat stretching, no abdominal swabs are used, the uterus is closed in one layer with a big needle to reduce the amount of foreign body as much as possible, the peritoneal layers remain unsutured and the abdomen is closed with two layers only. Women undergoing this operation recover quickly and can look after the newborns soon after surgery. There are many publications showing the advantages over traditional caesarean section methods. However, there is an increased risk of abruptio placentae and uterine rupture in subsequent pregnancies for women who underwent this method in prior deliveries.|$|E
500|$|The {{artificial}} propagation of American paddlefish {{began with the}} efforts of the Missouri Department of Conservation during the early 1960s, and focused primarily on maintenance of the sport fishery. [...] However, it was the growing importance of American paddlefish for their meat and roe that became the catalyst for further development of culture techniques for aquaculture in the United States. [...] Artificial propagation requires broodstock which, because of the late sexual maturation of American paddlefish, are initially obtained from the wild and brought into a hatchery environment. [...] The fish are injected with LH-RH hormone to stimulate spawning. [...] The number of eggs a female may produce depends {{on the size of the}} fish and can range anywhere from 70,000–300,000 eggs. [...] Unlike most teleosts, the oviduct branches of American paddlefish and sturgeons are not directly attached to the ovaries; rather, they open dorsally into the body cavity. [...] To determine the status of progression toward maturation, ova staging is performed. [...] The process begins with a minor procedure that involves a small <b>abdominal</b> <b>incision</b> from which to extract a few sample oocytes. [...] The oocytes are boiled in water for a few minutes until the yolk is hardened, and then they are cut in half to expose the nucleus. [...] The exposed nucleus is examined under a microscope to determine stage of maturity.|$|E
2500|$|If {{there is}} a {{suspected}} bowel perforation, a water-soluble contrast agent is used instead of barium.

The entire colorectal specimen was extracted transanally. A circular stapler anvil was introduced transanally. The J-pouch was created intracorporeally. The rectal stump was re-closed and a pouch-anal anastomosis was created using a circular stapler. We used a transanal tube for decompression of the pouch instead of a diverting ileostomy. The patients were discharged on the 10 th and 12 th days uneventfully. Both were doing well with their pouches after 18. 5 and 12. 1 months of follow-up.

2500|$|One of {{the most}} common {{elective}} surgical procedures in animals are those that render animals incapable of reproducing. [...] Neutering in animals describes spaying or castration (also please see castration). [...] To spay (medical term: ovariectomy or ovario-hysterectomy) is to completely remove the ovaries and often the uterus of a female animal. [...] In a dog, this is accomplished through a ventral midline incision into the abdomen. In a cat, this is accomplished either by a ventral midline <b>abdominal</b> <b>incision,</b> or by a flank incision (more common in the UK). With an ovariectomy ligatures are placed on the blood vessels above and below the ovary and the organ is removed. With an ovariohysterectomy, the ligaments of the uterus and ovaries are broken down and the blood vessels are ligated and both organs are removed. [...] The body wall, subcutis, and skin are sutured. [...] To castrate (medical term: orchiectomy) is to remove the testicles of a male animal. [...] Different techniques are used {{depending on the type of}} animal, including ligation of the spermatic cord with suture material, placing a rubber band around the cord to restrict blood flow to the testes, or crushing the cord with a specialized instrument like the Burdizzo.|$|E
2500|$|This is a {{modification}} of the perineal rectosigmoidectomy, differing in that only the mucosa and submucosa are excised from the prolapsed segment, rather than full thickness resection. The prolapse is exposed {{if it is not}} already present, and the mucosal and submucosal layers are stripped from the redundant length of bowel. The muscle layer that is left is plicated (folded) and placed as a buttress above the pelvic floor. The edges of the mucosal are then stitched back together. [...] "Mucosal proctectomy" [...] was first discussed by Delorme in 1900, now it is becoming more popular again as it has low morbidity and avoids an <b>abdominal</b> <b>incision,</b> while effectively repairing the prolapse. The procedure is ideally suited to those patients with full-thickness prolapse limited to partial circumference (e.g., anterior wall) or less-extensive prolapse (perineal rectosigmoidectomy may be difficult in this situation). Fecal incontinence is improved following surgery (40%–75% of patients). Post operatively, both mean resting and squeeze pressures were increased. Constipation is improved in 50% of cases, but often urgency and tenesmus are created. Complications, including infection, urinary retention, bleeding, anastomotic dehiscence (opening of the stitched edges inside), stricture (narrowing of the gut lumen), diarrhea, and fecal impaction occur in 6-32% of cases. Mortality occurs in 0-2.5% cases. There is a higher recurrence rate than abdominal approaches (7-26% cases).|$|E
2500|$|Laparoscopic {{surgery is}} {{performed}} using a camera and instruments placed through small incisions (ports) in the body wall. The patient is under anaesthesia and lying on the back. The incisions are between [...] and the number varies according to the equipment and technique used. The surgeon watches on a screen during the operation. The first port is made just behind the umbilicus and the camera is inserted. The abdomen is inflated with carbon dioxide gas to create a space to operate in. A second port is introduced a few centimeters {{in front of the}} navel and a long grasping instrument called a Babcock forceps is inserted. The surgeon finds the ovary with the instrument and uses it to suspend the ovary from a needle placed through the abdominal wall. This lifts the ovary and uterus safely away from other organs. The surgeon then removes the grasping instrument and replaces it with an instrument that cauterizes and cuts tissue. This instrument uses electricity to heat the blood vessels to seal them and to cut them. No sutures are placed inside. The ovary is separated from the uterus and round ligament. The cautery instrument is removed and replaced by the grasping instrument, which is used to pull the ovary out through the small <b>abdominal</b> <b>incision</b> (port). This is repeated {{on the other side and}} the small holes are closed with a few sutures.|$|E
30|$|The {{increased}} use of laparoscopy {{during the last decade}} has been followed by the occurrence of new types of postoperative complication related to the absence of closure of <b>abdominal</b> <b>incisions.</b> Postoperative incisional hernias are usually reported as occurring through 10 -mm sheath incisions [1].

40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine whether postoperative adhesions to the peritoneum beneath the anterior <b>abdominal</b> wall <b>incision</b> could be decreased by peritoneal closure using less reactive suture material. Study Design Six longitudinal <b>abdominal</b> <b>incisions</b> were made in each of 16 New Zealand white female rabbits. The peritoneum was randomly assigned to nonclosure or closure with chromic gut, braided nylon, braided coated polyglactin 910, polydioxanone monofilament, or poliglecaprone 25 suture. On postoperative day 14, adhesion formation was scored and evaluated microscopically. Results: Peritoneal closure decreased adhesion scores, compared with nonclosure, regardless of type of suture, and no particular suture was superior. Braided coated polyglactin 910 resulted in the least chronic inflammation and fibrosis. Conclusion: Peritoneal closure of peritoneum immediately below laparotomy incisions results in decreased adhesion scores, compared with nonclosure in our rabbit model.

ED value differs statistically significantly between the normal skin and the lesion treated by MAL. No direct proportionality was found between the fluorescence signal and singlet oxygen production. Nevertheless, the strong fluorescence signal is necessary but not a sufficient condition for higher singlet oxygen production in vivo. ED value correlates rather well with production of singlet oxygen, but differently in lesion and normal skin. Lifetimes of singlet oxygen differ between spots outside and in the lesion.
