Anyone molesting Islanders would be excommunicated. A Royal Charter in 1548 confirmed the neutrality.

The neutrality lasted another century, until William III of England abolished the privilege due to privateering activity against Dutch ships.|$|E

500|$|While {{ultimately}} an Israeli victory, the Battle of the Chinese Farm has {{an especially}} infamous legacy among Israeli participants, {{and it is}} remembered {{as one of the}} most brutal battles of the war—and for the heavy losses incurred by both the Egyptians and Israelis.

[...] The minister, taken aback by the great destruction before him, muttered in an undertone, [...] "What you people have done here!" [...] Later, Dayan would recount that: [...] "I am no novice at war or battle scenes, but I have never seen such a sight, not in reality, or in paintings, or in the worst war movies. Here was a vast field of slaughter stretching <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> could see." [...] Sharon would also provide his own poignant account of the aftermath: [...] "It was as if a hand-to-hand battle of armor had taken place... Coming close you could see the Egyptian and Jewish dead lying side-by-side, soldiers who had jumped from their burning tanks and died together.

2500|$|In July, {{continuing}} {{south in}} clear weather, Barkley found {{the entrance to}} the Strait of Juan de Fuca. He did not explore it, but gave it its present name honouring Juan de Fuca. Juan de Fuca claimed to have discovered and sailed up a large strait at this location in 1592. Barkley thought the strait he found matched the description Juan de Fuca had given and that it was in fact Juan de Fuca's strait. The veracity of Juan de Fuca's claim had long been scoffed at by geographers and is doubted by most historians to the present day. Captain Barkley was probably the first non-indigenous person to find the strait. He was surprised to find it at all because Captain James Cook had previously explored the area and not seen it. Cook had emphatically stated that Juan de Fuca's strait did not exist. Frances Barkley wrote about the discovery in her diary: [...] "In the afternoon, to our great astonishment, we arrived off a large opening extending to the eastward, the entrance of which appeared to be about four leagues wide, and remained about that width <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> could see, with a clear easterly horizon, which my husband immediately recognized as the long lost strait of Juan de Fuca, and to which he gave the name of the original discoverer, my husband placing it on his chart." [...] Barkley perhaps thought Tatoosh Island was the pinnacle reported by Juan de Fuca as located at {{the entrance to the}} strait. Fellow fur-trader Charles Duncan, who learned about the strait from Barkley, assumed the island was Juan de Fuca's pillar.|$|E
