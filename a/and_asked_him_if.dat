5|$|Directly {{prior to}} The Beatles' first American visit, Brian Epstein {{wanted someone to}} manage the {{escalating}} volume of merchandising requests that NEMS found itself unable to cope with, and asked his lawyer, David Jacobs, to oversee this task. Jacobs knew Nicky Byrne <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> he {{would be interested in}} taking over the merchandising subdivision from NEMS altogether, paying NEMS a commission. Byrne accepted the offer subject to a 90% rate, leaving only 10% for the Beatles and NEMS combined. Completely unaware of the potential market that existed, particularly in America, Epstein agreed to the deal, and subsequently lost The Beatles an estimated $100,000,000 in possible income.|$|E

The band, fans of The Posies, met Ken Stringfellow {{at a couple of}} festivals they attended, <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> he wanted to get involved. He accepted, and visited the studio for a day, {{contributing}} piano.|$|E

25|$|Large-scale Allied {{bombings of}} Bucharest {{took place in}} spring 1944, while the Soviet Red Army {{approached}} Romanian borders. The Battle for Romania began in late summer: while German commanders Johannes Frießner and Otto Wöhler of the Army Group South Ukraine attempted to hold Bukovina, Soviet Steppe Front leader Rodion Malinovsky stormed into the areas of Moldavia defended by Petre Dumitrescu's troops. In reaction, Antonescu attempted to stabilize the front on a line between Focșani, Nămoloasa and Brăila, deep inside Romanian territory. On August 5, he visited Hitler one final time in Kętrzyn. On this occasion, the German leader reportedly explained that his people had betrayed the Nazi cause, <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> Romania would go on fighting (to which Antonescu reportedly answered in vague terms). After Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov more than once stated that the Soviet Union {{was not going to}} require Romanian subservience, the factions opposing Antonescu agreed that the moment had come to overthrow him, by carrying out the Royal Coup of August 23. On that day, the sovereign asked Antonescu to meet him in the royal palace building, where he presented him with a request to take Romania out of its Axis alliance. The Conducător refused, and was promptly arrested by soldiers of the guard, being replaced as Premier with General Constantin Sănătescu, who presided over a national government.|$|E

I gave him a quick call <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> he could get on the record, and he recorded it and sent it over. As I expected, there was nothing I needed to change. It sounded perfect. He put my name in there, which is great – so people know to pronounce it now properly, hopefully." [...] The version featuring Ludacris was originally released digitally as the b-side to [...] "No Other One" [...] in November 2009, before in the United States in February 2010.|$|E

Although the sea was tranquil, Jean still felt queasy. Ostensibly, the purpose of MacArthur's visit was presenting Bulkeley with the Distinguished Service Cross for sinking an [...] "unidentified 5,000-ton enemy ship with torpedoes without serious damage to his ship or casualty to his crew", but afterwards MacArthur took Bulkeley aside <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> {{it would be possible}} to make the [...] journey through uncharted waters at night in PT boats.

500|$|His health {{began to}} improve by May 1784, and he {{travelled}} to Oxford with Boswell on 5 May 1784. By July, many of Johnson's friends were either dead or gone; Boswell {{had left for}} Scotland and Hester Thrale had become engaged to Piozzi. With no one to visit, Johnson {{expressed a desire to}} die in London and arrived there on 16 November 1784. On 25 November 1784, he allowed Burney to visit him and expressed an interest to her that he should leave London; he soon left for Islington, to George Strahan's home. His final moments were filled with mental anguish and delusions; when his physician, Thomas Warren, visited <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> he were feeling better, Johnson burst out with: [...] "No, Sir; you cannot conceive with what acceleration I advance towards death." ...|$|E
500|$|As the 30th {{anniversary of}} Star Trek was approaching, {{a number of}} plans were being put into place.

Producer Ira Steven Behr later recalled that he thought that Deep Space Nine might end up being missed out as he considered it to be the [...] "middle child" [...] of the franchise. However, Rick Berman contacted Behr <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> he would be interested in doing something to celebrate the anniversary. Behr agreed to discuss it with the staff writers. Initially, there was concern that if the proposed episode aired during the actual anniversary week (around September 8), that it would have to serve as the season opener, pre-empting the already planned opener.|$|E
500|$|Abbott {{stated that}} there were two reasons for what he {{considered}} to be the show's failure. The first was Rodgers and Hammerstein's overconfidence; they thought of themselves as Broadway's [...] "Golden Boys" [...] who could do no wrong. The other was the play-within-the-play, which had not been thoroughly thought out by anyone. According to Abbott, Hammerstein remained [...] "positively Sphinx-like" [...] on the subject. At a loss to understand the characters of the play-within-the play, Alton came up with nothing more than routine song-and-dance numbers. During the run, the duo approached choreographer Jerome Robbins <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> he could fix the dances. Robbins said that he could, but he would not, as [...] "it would kill Bob Alton". According to Hammerstein biographer Hugh Fordin, [...] " [...] intended contrast between onstage and backstage life was never achieved because the onstage show was so tepid and confusing." ...|$|E

500|$|Martin Olson, {{the father}} of Olivia Olson who voices Marceline, {{provides}} the voice for Marceline's demonic father Hunson Abadeer. A year after the series had been cast, Ward approached Olson <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> he wanted to voice a character on the show. Olson was apprehensive at first, arguing {{that he was not}} an actor but a writer, instead. Ward insisted and Olson eventually relented. Olson later joked that he was [...] "in heaven" [...] during the recording of the dialogue because the episode featured him [...] "fighting to the death with [...] daughter." [...] Olson later noted that the opportunity to voice act with her father was [...] "pretty cool”. Olson would make a cameo in the third season episode [...] "Memory of a Memory", and would be featured in {{a major role in the}} fourth season two-part episode [...] "Return to the Nightosphere"/"Daddy's Little Monster".|$|E
500|$|On May 2, 1969, the Experience {{performed}} at Cobo Hall in Detroit. According to Mitchell, {{while they were}} {{getting ready for the}} show the band and their entourage were informed about a possible drug bust planned for the following day. The group's road crew warned everyone to take precautions against any potential for drugs to be planted on them. Mitchell responded by wearing a suit without pockets and not wearing any underwear. Tour managers Gerry Stickells and Tony Ruffino expressed their concern to Hendrix <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> he had any drugs on him to which he replied: [...] "No." [...] After arriving in Toronto, he was awoken by concert promoter Ron Terry who told him: [...] "Whatever you got in that bag, get rid of it." [...] Terry then took him into the plane's bathroom and dumped anything that might be mistaken for illegal drugs into the toilet. Terry commented: [...] "I thought he was clean." ...|$|E
500|$|Prior to Christmas 2001, Bostaph {{sustained}} a chronic elbow injury which hindered {{his ability to}} drum, resulting in his decision to leave the band. His third-to-last performance with Slayer was recorded on War at the Warfield. To date, Bostaph has not viewed the footage; he has likened the experience to [...] "breaking up with a girlfriend," [...] and wants {{to move on with}} his life. Bostaph does not regret his time spent with the band, and described the period as a high point in his career. Bostaph eventually rejoined Slayer in 2013, once again replacing Dave Lombardo. Without a drummer the band were unable to finish their God Hates Us All tour. King contacted original drummer Dave Lombardo almost ten years after his departure, <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> {{he would be willing to}} play for the remainder of the tour. Lombardo accepted the offer, and played for the remaining 21 shows; however, he did not take on a permanent position with the band.|$|E

500|$|Having {{found his}} subject, Tippett sought {{advice on the}} {{preparation}} of the text from T. S. Eliot, whom he had met recently through a mutual friend, Francis Morley. [...] The musicologist Michael Steinberg comments that, given his anti-Semitism, Eliot may have been an inappropriate choice of collaborator, though Tippett considered the poet his spiritual and artistic mentor, and felt that his counsel would be crucial. Tippett writes: [...] "I plucked up courage <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> he would write it. Eliot said he would consider the matter as long as I provided him with a precise scheme of musical sections and an exact indication of the numbers and kinds of words for each stage". When Tippett produced his detailed draft, Eliot advised the composer to write his own libretto, suggesting [...] that his own superior poetry would either distract attention from the music, or otherwise would be [...] "swallowed up by it". Either way, there would be a mismatch. Tippett accepted this advice; henceforth, he records, he always wrote his own texts.|$|E
500|$|Bart's ballet {{teacher was}} voiced by Susan Sarandon, and was {{designed}} {{to look a little}} bit like her. Sarandon had wanted to guest star on the show because her children were big fans; she brought them with her to the recording session. Due to a traffic jam, she was late for the recording session, but once she arrived, she fell into character and worked very hard on getting her accent accurate. Sarandon would later have a cameo appearance as the voice of a computer in the season 17 episode [...] "Bart Has Two Mommies". Mel Brooks has a cameo appearance as himself. His wife Anne Bancroft had {{played a role in the}} episode [...] "Fear of Flying" [...] and Brooks had accompanied her to the recording session. David Mirkin realized that Brooks was [...] "dying to do the show" [...] <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> he would be willing to do a guest part, and he agreed. Many of the writers were fans of Brooks, and Matt Groening described the chance to have him guest star as [...] "an incredible honor".|$|E
500|$|Douglas {{worked with}} a speech {{instructor}} on breath control {{in order to become}} better acclimatized to the fast rhythm of the film's dialogue. Early on in the shoot, Stone tested Douglas by enhancing his [...] "repressed anger", according to the actor. At one point, Stone came into Douglas' trailer <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> he was doing drugs because [...] "you look like you haven't acted before". This shocked Douglas, who did more research and worked on his lines again and again, pushing himself harder than he had before. All of this hard work culminated with the [...] "Greed is good" [...] speech. Stone planned to use a Fortune magazine cover in exchange for promotional advertisements, but Forbes magazine made a similar offer. Stone stuck with Fortune, which upset Forbes publisher Malcolm Forbes, who turned down a later request to use his private yacht. Stone switched from 12- to 14-hour shooting days {{in the last few weeks}} in order to finish principal photography before an impending Directors Guild of America strike and finished five days ahead of schedule. Sheen remembered that Stone was always looking at the script and at his watch.|$|E
