5|$|The {{courtship}} between Ferdinand and Miranda {{is one of}} {{the chief}} beauties of this play. It is the very purity of love. The pretended interference of Prospero with it heightens its interest, and is in character with the magician, whose sense of preternatural power makes him arbitrary, tetchy, <b>and</b> <b>impatient</b> of opposition.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by the {{sluggish}} response of Brazil, infuriated by the {{mockery of the}} Buenos Aires press <b>and</b> <b>impatient</b> at Argentina's refusal to permit him to invade a further Brazilian province through sovereign Argentine territory, on 13 April 1865 López fired upon and seized two small Argentine naval vessels moored in the port of Corrientes, then proceeded to take the Argentine province of that name, making Paraguayan paper currency compulsory on pain of death. The resulting War of the Triple Alliance was to destroy his country.|$|E
5|$|Between 1956 and 1964 Manning's {{main project}} was The Balkan Trilogy, a {{sequence}} of three novels based on her experiences during the Second World War; as usual she was supported and encouraged by Reggie. The books describe the marriage of Harriet and Guy Pringle as they {{live and work in}} Romania and Greece, ending with their escape to Alexandria in 1941 just ahead of the Germans. Guy, a man at once admirable and unsatisfactory, and Harriet, a woman alternately proud <b>and</b> <b>impatient,</b> move from early passion to acceptance of difference. Manning described the books as long chapters of an autobiography, and early versions were written in the first person. There was significant fictionalisation, however. While Manning had been 31 and Reggie 25 at the outset of war, Manning's alter ego Harriet Pringle was a mere 21, and her husband a year older. Manning was a writer by profession, while her creation was not.|$|E

25|$|Tom Weylin: The merciless {{and brutal}} slave {{owner of an}} antebellum Maryland plantation. Tom’s cold, strict, <b>and</b> <b>impatient</b> {{personality}} makes him a hard master and father. When he perceives he has been disobeyed, he retaliates swiftly and violently; instilling fear in those subservient to him. He whips Dana on multiple occasions, and authorizes the selling of his slaves' children. He is often likened to Kevin in looks.|$|E
25|$|Many Conservative {{politicians}} of generations following Macleod recalled {{him as a}} highly effective speaker. His bald head and piercing gaze gave him a striking physical presence, {{and he was one}} of the most powerful platform speakers of his generation, in the league of Churchill or Aneurin Bevan. He was also a superb negotiator with a grasp of detail. Never one to suffer fools, by middle age his disability made him very short-tempered <b>and</b> <b>impatient</b> with people.|$|E

50|$|Of {{interest}} {{is the fact that}} Disney's Queen of Hearts seems to be an amalgamation of the Queen from the book, the Duchess, and the Red Queen of Through The Looking-Glass.

25|$|Gilruth {{refused to}} address the crowd other than making a {{statement}} that he was answerable to the Minister and would not and did not recognise the citizens of Darwin as having any authority over him. The crowd outside became tense <b>and</b> <b>impatient.</b> The crowd demanded that Gilruth appear before them to vindicate himself. Surprisingly, Gilruth complied but he was defiant, inviting the crowd to gaze upon him and stating if recalled by the Minister he would leave, but under no other circumstances would he leave his post.|$|E
25|$|Authorisation for the {{construction}} of the line was obtained in 1864, 1867 and 1870 by the South Eastern Railway (SER). No works having been undertaken by 1876, several local inhabitants, aware of the advantages of the railway <b>and</b> <b>impatient</b> for action, rallied together to sponsor a bill similar to the original 1864 bill. The line was to be built in two phases: phase one from Dunton Green via Brasted to Westerham, and phase two covering the 4 miles from Westerham to Oxted, where it would join the Oxted Line, {{the construction}} of which had not by then been completed. However, the second phase was never realised due to opposition from the SER.|$|E
25|$|The Director is an {{irritable}} <b>and</b> <b>impatient</b> man, his annoyance likely {{exacerbated by}} the fact that he has another appointment, “a caucus”, to attend and his time there is limited. He expresses concern with the overall appearance and demands that the coat and hat be removed leaving the man “shivering” in his “old grey pyjamas.” He has the man’s fists unclenched and then joined, the only suggestion of his Assistant’s that he pays any heed to; once arranged at breast-height he is satisfied. (Beckett explained to James Knowlson that when he was composing Catastrophe, “In my mind was Dupuytren’s contracture (from which I suffer) which reduces hands to claws.”) The Director dismisses his Assistant’s proposal to have the man gagged (“This craze for explicitation!”) or to “show his face … just for an instant.” He also has her make notes to whiten all the exposed flesh.|$|E

25|$|Columbo's {{wardrobe}} {{was personally}} provided by Peter Falk; {{they were his}} own clothes, including the high-topped shoes and the shabby raincoat, which made its first appearance in Prescription: Murder. Falk would often ad lib his character's idiosyncrasies (fumbling through his pockets {{for a piece of}} evidence and discovering a grocery list, asking to borrow a pencil, becoming distracted by something irrelevant in the room at a dramatic point in a conversation with a suspect, etc.), inserting these into his performance as a way to keep his fellow actors off-balance. He felt it helped to make their confused <b>and</b> <b>impatient</b> reactions to Columbo's antics more genuine. Some of the episodes established that Columbo carried a Colt snub-nosed revolver in his raincoat, which he pulled in rare episodes, and would occasionally remark that his wife, 'the Mrs.', would not allow him to buy a new car because it 'wasn't necessary', portraying the detective throughout the series as permanently driving an aged and battered 1959 Peugeot 403 Cabriolet.|$|E
25|$|The Qur'an {{has also}} pointed out that believers perform Salaah only to earn the {{pleasure}} of Allah and not to impress anyone else, calling anyone who does so a hypocrite. Moreover, those who abandon Salaah are warned of dire consequences, while only those who humbly submit themselves to Allah alone are said to have ease in offering it. In Surah Al-Ma'arij, Allah uses the word halu’an to describe the restless <b>and</b> <b>impatient</b> nature of man, stating that whenever he is afflicted with trouble he lacks patience and trembles in despair. This occurs due to shortcomings in his faith, whereas when he is given in abundance he becomes ungrateful towards Allah. He is also arrogant and uncaring towards those less fortunate than him. The Qur'an then assures the observance of Salaah as way to preserve hope in times of grievance and humbleness as well as humility in periods of bountiful life. Salaah thus has the power to erase the roots of evil deeds which bring barriers in the society giving birth to racial as well as financial discriminations and sinful intentions.|$|E
25|$|Gabriel travels {{back to the}} city, {{and finds}} the brothel where Amitiel works. He also {{encounters}} Asmodeus, the Fallen who runs the brothel. Gabriel rescues Amitiel and kills the Fallen Balan who tries to rape her. He then heals her of the drugs she has been taking to dull the pain of her job. As Gabriel's use of power makes his presence known in Purgatory, the Fallen grow weary <b>and</b> <b>impatient</b> of waiting. Amitiel takes Gabriel to the soup kitchen where the Archangel Ithuriel hides. Initially angry at Ithuriel for abandoning his mission of seeking out and destroying the Fallen, Gabriel eventually shows him compassion and understanding. Ithuriel takes Gabriel to the abandoned tunnels beneath the soup kitchen where the gravely wounded Raphael dwells. Gabriel heals Raphael, expending much of his strength. After rebuking Gabriel, Raphael explains that Sammael draws his immense power from the other Fallen. Gabriel proposes {{to take out the}} remaining Fallen one by one, before finally facing Sammael. Raphael is unconvinced, as Sammael has already killed the stronger angel Michael.|$|E

500|$|After Phips was discreetly {{informed}} of their amazing find, {{he spent the}} next nine days preparing the ships and gathering enough food to sustain the men over months of bringing up treasure. [...] (During the controversies that surrounded Phips {{at the end of his}} life, his critics like to portray him as hot-headed, ill-bred, <b>and</b> <b>impatient,</b> so it seems worth noting his careful conduct during this life-changing and momentous time.) ...|$|E

According to Kirkman, it was important to integrate dimension to the character so that viewers [...] "can see later in the episode, when [...] is losing it and actually getting somewhat violent with Lori, the transition he's gone through and how this world has changed him from being a loving, easygoing guy into this guy who is slowly devolving into a bit of a maniac." ...|$|E

500|$|Brittan was {{a member}} of the Canterbury Provincial Council for just over three years. He served as Provincial Secretary from 1855 to 1857 and was {{expected}} to succeed James FitzGerald as the second Superintendent of the Canterbury Province, but was beaten by William Sefton Moorhouse in October 1857. He established the third newspaper in Canterbury, the Canterbury Standard, which existed for 12 years until shortly before Brittan's death. [...] Brittan was a very eloquent speaker, but he had a biting and sarcastic character, and was disliked, and even feared, by some. [...] Later in life, he suffered from gout and frequent headaches, and this together with financial trouble, often made him irritable <b>and</b> <b>impatient.</b> He died at his homestead in October 1867 after a long period of declining health.|$|E
