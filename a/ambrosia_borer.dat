40|$|Problem statement: The borer insect Euplatypus segnis Chapuis is {{associated}} to Fusarium solani, Fusarium oxysporum, Alternariaalternata and Botryodiplodia theobromae fungi which produce regressive death in pecan (Carya illinoensis) trees. In the Mexico northern {{have been reported}} loses estimatesof more than 20 % in production by the combination of insects and phyto-pathogen organisms. It also has been observed that some trees can survive with or without chemical treatment. Approach: The aim of {{present study was to}} determine the biochemical changes (contained of nitrogen, crude protein, terpen, condensed and hydrolyzable tannins, cellulose, lignin and silicium) in tissue of pecan trees cv. Western colonized by <b>Ambrosia</b> <b>Borer</b> (Euplatypus segnis Chapuis) and associated fungi complex. Three damaged trees and three healthy trees were sampled in three different plantations in each one of three Coahuila State localities. The responses variables were analyzed under a nested design, Tukey s test (p Results: Dataindicated that content of: terpenes, hydrolyzables tannins, cellulose, lignin and silicium increased significantly in the damaged trees in comparison to healthy trees. Conclusion: This results allowed inferring that these components increased as a chemical defense answer to insect invasion and to the enzymatic action of the associated phyto-pathogenic fungi...|$|E

Attack begins in April, reaches a peak in May but then declines rapidly, being of negligible importance after August. Trees felled between November and January are more susceptible but few logs left at stump are attacked. Damage is much more widespread in logs stacked in the forest or at the mill. Good protection can be provided economically by spraying stacked timber with an emulsion of 0 Â· 75 per cent. gamma BHe. A fresh treatment is advisable if logs are restacked or the outside ones removed from a stack between April and August. These treatments, combined with rapid extraction and conversion of logs during the summer, should {{reduce the incidence of}} damage. Suspension of felling during this period appears unjustified if these measures are followed; moreover, freshly felled timber is less susceptible to attack. Although the Lymt:xylid beetle Hylecoetus dermestoides L. is also widespread, damage is less apparent due to the absence of associated staining. The control measures recommended for Trypodendron appear suitable for Hylecoetus...|$|R
