5|$|The last {{eruption}} {{took place}} between 32,600 and 27,500 years ago. Its date is likewise unclear. Ongoing seismic and geothermal activity, and exhalations of volcanic gas and evidence of a still existing magma chamber indicate that Ciomadul is a potentially <b>active</b> <b>volcano.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hualālai is {{the third}} most <b>active</b> <b>volcano</b> making up the island of Hawaii, behind Kīlauea and Mauna Loa. Although the two larger volcanos have each erupted over 150times in the last 1,000years, Hualālai has done so but 3times. The {{recurrence}} of activity at the volcano seems to be every 200 to 300years.|$|E

Approximately 40 ravines radiate from the summit and provide pathways for frequent pyroclastic flows and mudslides to the lowlands below. Mayon's most violent eruption occurred in 1814 and was responsible for over 1200 deaths.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of volcanic {{activity on the}} moon Io was the greatest unexpected finding of the mission, {{as it was the}} first time an <b>active</b> <b>volcano</b> was observed on a celestial body other than Earth.

5|$|The {{idea that}} Ciomadul {{could be a}} still <b>active</b> <b>volcano</b> was first {{proposed}} in 1780 {{on the basis of}} its young appearance and the release of gas. While a publication in 1964 postulated that the tuffs of Ciomadul were reworked Pliocene volcanites, the late Pleistocene age was established soon afterwards.|$|E

5|$|Uniquely, Ciomadul is a {{still alive}} volcano in Eastern Europe and its craters have a {{youthful}} appearance. There {{is always the}} possibility of renewed volcanic activity if the magma chamber has not solidified.

5|$|Like {{previous}} missions, {{the astronauts}} took many photos of Earth from the station, over 700 in total, {{which have been}} made freely available. These Crew Earth Observations, are intended to record dynamic events on the Earth's surface such as storms, fires, or volcanoes. For example, a photo from 1 January 2001 shows Mount Cleveland, Alaska, with a plume of smoke, prior to its eruption the following month. On 23 January 2001, the crew observed a unique perspective of a plume of volcanic ash coming from Popocatépetl, an <b>active</b> <b>volcano</b> 70 kilometres southeast of Mexico City.|$|E
5|$|They {{went on to}} Albemarle Island, where Darwin saw a small jet {{of smoke}} from a {{recently}} <b>active</b> <b>volcano.</b> On 1 October he landed near Tagus Cove and explored Beagle Crater. There he saw his first Galapagos land iguanas. Water pits were disappointingly inadequate for drinking, but attracted swarms of small birds and Darwin made his only note of the finches he was not bothering to label by island. He caught a third species of mockingbird.|$|E
30|$|Using the {{regional}} seismic network, we obtained a highresolution velocity {{structure in the}} crust, especially beneath central Kyushu. This enables us to discuss low-velocity anomalies beneath <b>active</b> <b>volcanoes</b> in central Kyushu, such as the Kujyu, Aso and Unzen volcanoes. In terms of the upper crust, some studies have obtained details on velocity structures beneath the <b>active</b> <b>volcanoes</b> using the local seismic network (e.g. Ohmi and Lees, 1995; Sudo and Kong, 2001; Yoshikawa et al., 2005). Therefore, here we compare their results and discuss a linkage of shallow structures and structures in the lower crust beneath the <b>active</b> <b>volcanoes.</b>|$|R

5|$|Vinson Massif, {{the highest}} peak in Antarctica at , {{is located in}} the Ellsworth Mountains. Antarctica {{contains}} many other mountains, on both the main continent and the surrounding islands. Mount Erebus on Ross Island is the world's southernmost <b>active</b> <b>volcano.</b> Another well-known volcano is found on Deception Island, which is famous for a giant eruption in 1970. Minor eruptions are frequent and lava flow has been observed in recent years. Other dormant volcanoes may potentially be active. In 2004, a potentially active underwater volcano was found in the Antarctic Peninsula by American and Canadian researchers.|$|E
5|$|During {{recorded}} history, eruptions have consisted {{primarily of}} a central vent eruption (in the caldera) followed by an explosive eruption, then lahars. Ruiz's earliest identified Holocene eruption was about 6660BC, and further eruptions occurred in 1245BC±150years (dated through radiocarbon dating), about 850BC, 200BC±100 years, 350AD±300 years, 675AD±50 years, in 1350, 1541 (perhaps), 1570, 1595, 1623, 1805, 1826, 1828 (perhaps), 1829, 1831, 1833 (perhaps), 1845, 1916, December 1984 – March 1985, September 1985 – July 1991, and possibly in April 1994. Many of these eruptions involved a central vent eruption, a flank vent eruption, and a phreatic (steam) explosion. Ruiz is the second-most <b>active</b> <b>volcano</b> in Colombia after Galeras.|$|E

5|$|Interferometric {{synthetic}} aperture radar (InSAR) is a radar technique used in geodesy and remote sensing. Satellite {{synthetic aperture}} radar images of a geographic feature are taken on separate days, and changes {{that have taken place}} between radar images taken on the separate days are recorded as fringes similar to those obtained in holographic interferometry. The technique can monitor centimeter- to millimeter-scale deformation resulting from earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides, and also has uses in structural engineering, in particular for the monitoring of subsidence and structural stability. Fig20 shows Kilauea, an <b>active</b> <b>volcano</b> in Hawaii. Data acquired using the space shuttle Endeavour's X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar on April 13, 1994 and October 4, 1994 were used to generate interferometric fringes, which were overlaid on the X-SAR image of Kilauea.|$|E
5|$|Sangay (also {{known as}} Macas, Sanagay, or Sangai) {{is an active}} {{stratovolcano}} in central Ecuador. It is the most <b>active</b> <b>volcano</b> in Ecuador, despite erupting only three times in recorded history, because the eruption that started in 1934 is still ongoing. It exhibits mostly strombolian activity. Geologically, Sangay marks the southern boundary of the Northern Volcanic Zone, and its position straddling two major pieces of crust accounts for its high level of activity. Sangay's approximately 500,000-year-old history is one of instability; two previous versions of the mountain were destroyed in massive flank collapses, evidence of which still litters its surroundings today.|$|E

5|$|Yellowstone National Park spans {{an area of}} , {{comprising}} lakes, canyons, {{rivers and}} mountain ranges. Yellowstone Lake {{is one of the}} largest high-elevation lakes in North America and is centered over the Yellowstone Caldera, the largest supervolcano on the continent. The caldera is considered an <b>active</b> <b>volcano.</b> It has erupted with tremendous force several times in the last two million years. Half of the world's geothermal features are in Yellowstone, fueled by this ongoing volcanism. Lava flows and rocks from volcanic eruptions cover most of the land area of Yellowstone. The park is the centerpiece of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the largest remaining nearly-intact ecosystem in the Earth's northern temperate zone.|$|E
5|$|Nevado del Ruiz has {{undergone}} three distinct eruptive periods, the first beginning 1.8million years ago. During the present period (beginning 11,000years ago), it has erupted at least twelve times, producing ashfalls, pyroclastic flows, and lahars. The historically recorded eruptions have primarily involved a central vent eruption (in the caldera) {{followed by an}} explosive eruption, then the formation of lahars. Ruiz's earliest identified Holocene eruption was in about 6660BC, and further eruptions occurred around 1245, 850, 200BC and in about 350, 675, in 1350, 1541 (perhaps), 1570, 1595, 1623, 1805, 1826, 1828 (perhaps), 1829, 1831, 1833 (perhaps), 1845, 1916, December 1984 through March 1985, 1987 through July 1991, and possibly in April 1994.

The low-velocity anomaly immediately beneath <b>active</b> <b>volcanoes</b> is explained by the existence of partial melting with fractions of 1 – 5 % in the lower crust, and can be attributed to aqueous fluids with smaller-scale partial melting in the upper crust.|$|R
40|$|AbstractFor {{hundred and}} {{thousand}} years, people have believed and accepted that <b>active</b> <b>volcanoes</b> {{are caused by}} hot magma from the mantle of the Earth. The magma degassing releases volatiles or gas such as CO 2 and H 2 O and also initiates volcanic eruptions. On {{the basis of his}} investigations, however, the author has put forward, developed and established an innovative hypothesis of originality for the cause of <b>active</b> <b>volcanoes</b> in the crust of the Earth. His hypothesis considers that <b>active</b> <b>volcanoes</b> are caused by methane gas (CH 4). The methane gas migrates and flows from the mantle and forms and occupies the volcano chambers. The methane gas acts physically and mechanically the surrounding crustal rocks and reacts chemically with the minerals in the surrounding crustal rocks, which forms and develops lava, ashes, broken rock particles and other gases such as H 2 O and CO 2. In this presentation, the author will give evidences to demonstrate his gas cause hypothesis of <b>active</b> <b>volcanoes...</b>|$|R
