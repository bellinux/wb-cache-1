5|$|According to Mihardja, {{religious}} thinkers {{blasted the}} novel for depicting Hasan, whom they interpreted <b>as</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> religion and religious people, as unable to overcome temptation; they also disliked the novel's lack of in-depth discussion of religion, {{necessary for a}} better understanding of theism. Marxists and anarchists also felt that their ideologies were not well explained. They considered Rusli and Anwar not truly representative of the thoughts of Karl Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche. In response, Mihardja wrote that the characters were meant to be realistic, and that few people have as much knowledge about an ideology as demanded by the critics.|$|E

5|$|After two years, {{the account}} went viral in 2011. While Capone {{remained}} anonymous, games journalists, such Kotaku and GameSetWatch, began {{to cover his}} tweets and journalists, such as Leigh Alexander (Gamasutra) and Alex Navarro (Giant Bomb), reposted his content. Journalists did not view the parody as a mockery but instead <b>as</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> a growing dissatisfaction over clich√©d trends in the mainstream games industry. In this way, the account led to greater respect for Molyneux's temerity. Kotaku wrote that Capone's account displayed uncharacteristic creativity on his part, but Capone countered by saying that most game designers have endless game ideas and that real skill rests in applying them well.|$|E
5|$|The {{powers of}} the President {{in the conduct of}} foreign {{relations}} included the power, without consent of the Senate, to determine the public policy of the United States with respect to the Russian nationalization decrees. What government is to be regarded here <b>as</b> <b>representative</b> <b>of</b> a foreign sovereign state is a political rather than a judicial question, and is to be determined by the political department of the government. That authority is not limited to a determination of the government to be recognized. It includes the power to determine the policy which is to govern the question of recognition. Objections to the underlying policy as well as objections to recognition are to be addressed to the political department and not to the courts.|$|E

The proposal was met with a mixed response from members of the Royal Canadian Legion and Canadian Forces, detractors feeling that the Unknown Soldier should not be elevated above his other fallen comrades. It had also been agreed {{at the time of the}} Unknown Soldier's repatriation that no award or decoration would be bestowed on the remains. No decision was taken about the awarding of the Canadian Victoria Cross to the Canadian Unknown Soldier.|$|E
