5|$|Although silk {{was well}} known in Europe and most of Asia, China {{was able to keep}} a near {{monopoly}} on silk production. The monopoly was defended by an imperial decree, condemning to death anyone attempting to export silkworms or their eggs. Only around the year 300 CE did a Japanese expedition succeed in taking some silkworm eggs and four young Chinese girls, who were forced to teach their captors the art of sericulture. Techniques of sericulture were subsequently introduced to Japan on <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>scale</b> by frequent diplomatic exchanges between the 8th century and 9th centuries.|$|E
5|$|At some {{stage in}} that summer the formal copying of the symphony began. On 4 September 1933 Paul Voigt, Sibelius's long-time copyist, sent {{a bill for}} making a fair copy of the first movement—23 pages of music. Sibelius {{informed}} him—the note survives—that the complete manuscript would be about eight times {{as long as this}} excerpt, indicating that the symphony might be on <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>scale</b> than any of its seven predecessors. Aino Sibelius later recalled other visits to Voigt that autumn at which Sibelius, whose mood she described as gloomy and taciturn, delivered further piles of music manuscript to the copyist.|$|E

Fearing they would not gain enough votes, Rajneeshpuram officials decided to incapacitate voters in The Dalles, the largest population center in Wasco County. The chosen biological agent was Salmonella enterica Typhimurium, which was first delivered through glasses of water to two County Commissioners and then, on <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>scale,</b> at salad bars and in salad dressing.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, McClintock {{received}} {{funding from}} the National Academy of Sciences to start research on indigenous strains of maize in Central America and South America. She was interested in studying the evolution of maize through chromosomal changes, and being in South America would allow her to work on <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>scale.</b> McClintock explored the chromosomal, morphological, and evolutionary characteristics of various races of maize. After extensive work in the 1960s and 1970s, McClintock and her collaborators published the seminal study The Chromosomal Constitution of Races of Maize, leaving their mark on paleobotany, ethnobotany, and evolutionary biology.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the success, the Massachusetts {{provisional}} government agreed to organize an expedition on <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>scale</b> against Quebec, the capital of New France, and gave its command to Phips. Originally intending to coordinate with a simultaneous overland attack on Montreal launched from Albany, New York, the expedition's departure was delayed in the vain hope that needed munitions would arrive from England. The expedition, counting 34 ships and more than 2,000 soldiers, finally sailed on August 20. It was short on ammunition, had no pilots familiar with the Saint Lawrence River, and carried what {{would turn out to be}} inadequate provisions.|$|E

5|$|Up {{to the end}} of the 18th century, slate was {{extracted}} on a {{small scale}} by groups of quarrymen who paid a royalty to the landlord, carted slate to the ports, and then shipped it to England, Ireland and sometimes France. Towards the close of the century, the landowners began to operate the quarries themselves, on <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>scale.</b> After the government abolished slate duty in 1831, rapid expansion was propelled by the building of narrow gauge railways to transport the slates to the ports.|$|E

5|$|In 1602 Frederico Spinola, {{younger brother}} of Ambrogio Spinola had {{distinguished}} himself greatly {{as a soldier}} in the Army of Flanders and had succeeded in 1599 going through the English Channel passing the straits of Dover unmolested; this led to a panic called the Invisible armada as it encouraged suspicions that the attempt might be renewed and on <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>scale.</b> Buoyed by this achievement he had indulged Philip III of Spain, the Duke of Lerma and Martín de Padilla in a vision of a massive galley-borne invasion of England from Flanders. However the council brought him down to a mere eight galleys, provided at Spinola's expense. He was on his way from San Lucar to Lisbon but he was defeated by Sir Richard Leveson at Sezimbra Bay which cost him two galleys.|$|E
5|$|Lawrencium is a {{synthetic}} chemical element with symbol Lr (formerly Lw) and atomic number 103. It is {{named in honor}} of Ernest Lawrence, inventor of the cyclotron, a device that was used to discover many artificial radioactive elements. A radioactive metal, lawrencium is the eleventh transuranic element and is also the final member of the actinide series. Like all elements with atomic number over 100, lawrencium can only be produced in particle accelerators by bombarding lighter elements with charged particles. Twelve isotopes of lawrencium are currently known; the most stable is 266Lr with a half-life of 11hours, but the shorter-lived 260Lr (half-life 2.7minutes) is most commonly used in chemistry because it can be produced on <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>scale.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mendelevium is a {{synthetic}} element with chemical symbol Md (formerly Mv) and atomic number 101. A metallic radioactive transuranic {{element in the}} actinide series, {{it is the first}} element that currently cannot be produced in macroscopic quantities through neutron bombardment of lighter elements. It is the third-to-last actinide and the ninth transuranic element. It can only be produced in particle accelerators by bombarding lighter elements with charged particles. A total of sixteen mendelevium isotopes are known, the most stable being 258Md with a half-life of 51days; nevertheless, the shorter-lived 256Md (half-life 1.17hours) is most commonly used in chemistry because it can be produced on <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>scale.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{official}} language is Modern Standard Arabic, a literary language {{taught in the}} schools. Most Jordanians natively speak one of the non-standard Arabic dialects known as Jordanian Arabic. Jordanian Sign Language {{is the language of}} the deaf community. English, though without official status, is widely spoken throughout the country and is the de facto language of commerce and banking, as well as a co-official status in the education sector; almost all university-level classes are held in English and almost all public schools teach English along with Standard Arabic. Chechen, Circassian, Armenian, Tagalog, and Russian are popular among their communities. French is offered as an elective in many schools, mainly in the private sector. German is an increasingly popular language; it has been introduced at <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>scale</b> since the establishment of the German-Jordanian University in 2005.|$|E
5|$|The {{settlements}} were small, forming family based communities, {{but some}} of them were more sizable and functioned over many generations. They lacked artificial fortifications, but natural factors facilitating self-defense were often utilized. Such settlements could form small clusters separated by uninhabited areas. One rather large dwelling place, which functioned from the 2nd to the 4th century, was discovered and investigated in Osowo near Suwałki. The living quarters consisted of pillar supported houses, while the farming infrastructure area included eighty grain storage caves. Small fortified refuge areas were built to a limited extend beginning {{at the end of the}} 4th century, but on <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>scale</b> fortified settlements were constructed by the Western Balts only during the Middle Ages.|$|E
