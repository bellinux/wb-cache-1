Johnson Space Center (NASA JSC) {{located in}} Southeast Houston, sits as {{the crown jewel}} of Texas's <b>aeronautics</b> industry. Fort Worth hosts both Lockheed Martin's <b>Aeronautics</b> {{division}} and Bell Helicopter Textron. Lockheed builds the F-16 Fighting Falcon, the largest Western fighter program, and its successor, the F-35 Lightning II in Fort Worth.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, {{once again}} {{returning}} to government service, he joined {{as a member}} of the Naval Technical Mission to Europe, and later, the U.S. Navy's Bureau of <b>Aeronautics</b> (1946–61). At the Bureau of <b>Aeronautics,</b> from 1950 until his retirement in 1961, Verville was a technical advisor and consultant to the director of the Technical Data Division. Verville retired in 1961 and moved to La Jolla, California.|$|E
5|$|Orville {{made his}} last flight {{as a pilot}} in 1918 in a 1911 Model B. He retired from {{business}} and became an elder statesman of aviation, serving on various official boards and committees, including the National Advisory Committee for <b>Aeronautics</b> (NACA), predecessor agency to the National <b>Aeronautics</b> and Space Administration (NASA) and Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce (ACCA), predecessor to the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA).|$|E
5|$|President Dwight D. Eisenhower {{established}} NASA in 1958 with {{a distinctly}} civilian (rather than military) orientation encouraging peaceful applications in space science. The National <b>Aeronautics</b> and Space Act was passed on July 29, 1958, disestablishing NASA's predecessor, the National Advisory Committee for <b>Aeronautics</b> (NACA). The new agency became operational on October 1, 1958.|$|E

5|$|The {{center was}} a part of the National Advisory Committee for <b>Aeronautics</b> (NACA), a United States federal agency founded to promote {{aeronautical}} research. Cooperative students at NACA took part in a program that combined work and study, providing a way for them to fund their college degrees while gaining experience in <b>aeronautics.</b> Lunney graduated from college in June 1958, with a Bachelor of Science degree in Aerospace engineering.|$|E
5|$|Grissom Hall at Purdue University, {{his alma}} mater, {{was the home}} of the School of <b>Aeronautics</b> and Astronautics for several decades. It is {{currently}} home of the Purdue department of Industrial Engineering.|$|E
5|$|In December 2015, {{infusion}} of silicon carbide nano-particles in molten magnesium was {{mentioned as a}} way to produce a new strong and plastic alloy suitable for use in <b>aeronautics,</b> aerospace, automobile and micro-electronics.|$|E
5|$|In September 2015, Saab <b>Aeronautics</b> head Lennard Sindhal {{announced}} that an electronic warfare {{version of the}} Gripen F two-seater was under development.|$|E
5|$|Mary Winston Jackson (April 9, 1921 – February 11, 2005) was an African American {{mathematician}} {{and aerospace}} {{engineer at the}} National Advisory Committee for <b>Aeronautics</b> (NACA), which in 1958 was succeeded by the National <b>Aeronautics</b> and Space Administration (NASA). She worked at Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, {{for most of her}} career. She started as a computer at the segregated West Area Computing division. She took advanced engineering classes and in 1958 became NASA's first black female engineer.|$|E
5|$|McCormack {{retired from}} the Air Force in 1955, {{and became the first}} head of the Institute for Defense Analysis, a {{non-profit}} research organization to provide advice and support to the Department of Defense's scientific and technological research efforts formed by ten universities. In 1958 he became vice president for industrial and governmental relations at MIT. He originated the proposal that the National Advisory Committee for <b>Aeronautics</b> be used as the basis for a new space agency, which eventually became the National <b>Aeronautics</b> and Space Administration.|$|E
5|$|Of the graduating {{classes at}} Hunter, 83% {{went on to}} {{specialized}} schools to train as yeomen; radiomen; storekeepers, and cooks and bakers. In addition to the college campuses, enlisted WAVES also trained at Georgia State College for Women in Milledgeville; Burdett College in Boston, and Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. The Bureaus of <b>Aeronautics</b> and Medicine opened their doors to enlisted WAVES. The training in <b>aeronautics</b> took place at naval air stations and training centers; the training for medical technicians {{was held at the}} National Medical and Great Lakes Training Centers. Unlike the training on the college campuses, the training at these facilities was coeducational.|$|E

5|$|That Autumn the {{government}} conducted a formal inquiry into military aviation. Capper {{had to return}} early from Blair Atholl in order to present his evidence. He argued strongly for a promising future {{of all forms of}} <b>aeronautics</b> and especially the aeroplane. However his Army superiors on the committee were against <b>aeronautics</b> in any form. It was decided that only small-scale airship experiments should continue and that aeroplane work should be stopped. It formally ceased when Dunne and Cody's contracts ran {{out at the end of}} March 1909.|$|E
5|$|Verville {{joined the}} <b>Aeronautics</b> Branch of the Department of Commerce in 1933. The <b>Aeronautics</b> Branch became the Bureau of Air Commerce in 1934. During his time there, Verville {{served in the}} {{following}} roles: aeronautical engineer; chief of the Manufacturing, Engineering, and Inspections Service; and finally assistant chief of the Aeronautic Development Section. In his role as chief of the Manufacturing, Engineering, and Inspections Service, {{he was in charge}} of the reviews for issuing type certificates for all manufactured airplanes.|$|E
5|$|A {{specification}} {{was issued}} by the U.S. Navy's Bureau of <b>Aeronautics</b> (BuAer) for a single-seat, carrier-based fighter powered by a Westinghouse 24C (later J34) axial turbojet on 5 September 1944. Chance Vought was awarded a contract for three V-340 (company designation) prototypes on 29 December 1944.|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} from the Navy, Hayward worked for General Dynamics as a vice president for international programs until 1973, {{and then as a}} consultant until 1979. He then worked with the Draper Laboratory and the Hertz Foundation. He became an American Institute of <b>Aeronautics</b> and Astronautics Fellow in 1998, and was inducted into the Naval Aviation Hall of Honor in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Armstrong {{announced}} {{shortly after}} the Apollo11 flight {{that he did not}} plan to fly in space again. He was appointed Deputy Associate Administrator for <b>aeronautics</b> for the Office of Advanced Research and Technology, Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), but served in this position for only a year, and resigned from it and NASA as a whole in 1971.|$|E
5|$|Data {{from the}} {{captured}} Zero had been {{transmitted to the}} U.S. Navy's Bureau of <b>Aeronautics</b> (BuAer) and Grumman Aircraft. After careful study, Roy Grumman decided that he could match or surpass the Zero in most respects, except in range, without sacrificing pilot armor, self-sealing tanks and fuselage structure. The new F6F Hellcat would compensate for the extra weight with additional power.|$|E
5|$|Despite all his prowess in {{piloting}} {{and design}} work, Longren {{was unable to}} maintain the financial side of his business and in 1924 he declared bankruptcy. He sold most of the company's assets and designs to new investors who in turn founded the Alexander Aircraft Company. Longren went on {{to work as a}} prized consultant for several other <b>aeronautics</b> firms including Spartan and Luscombe.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, Cummings {{was called}} back to USC to develop and teach a {{curriculum}} on civilian aviation for returning veterans. She {{spent much of the}} 1950s as a housewife, raising her children, but remained active as a part-time flight instructor, as well as helping develop curricula for Federal Aviation Administration institutions. She also raced airplanes competitively during this period and won the 1957 Powder Puff Derby, capturing the first prize pot of $800 (approximately $ in present-day terms). In 1962, she joined Harvey Mudd College and, in association with the Bates Foundation, founded the school's Bates <b>Aeronautics</b> Program. She ran the program with her husband until he retired in 1979, and continued alone until the program ended with her 1990 retirement. She continued teaching classes on <b>aeronautics,</b> however, until 1996. Her students include astronauts George Nelson and Stanley G. Love. She also served as an FAA Pilot Examiner for over two decades and was named the organization's Flight Instructor of the Year for the Ontario district in 1972.|$|E
5|$|Harding also {{wished to}} promote aviation, and Hoover again took the lead, {{convening}} a national conference on commercial aviation. The discussions focused on safety matters, inspection of airplanes, and licensing of pilots. Harding again promoted legislation {{but nothing was}} done until 1926, when the Air Commerce Act created the Bureau of <b>Aeronautics</b> within Hoover's Commerce Department.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, Wackett {{established}} advanced diploma {{training for}} twenty-five airmen annually at Melbourne Technical College, the graduates receiving commissions as pilot officers. He also began recruiting university-qualified engineers to the Technical Branch, {{and put in}} place formal relationships with such bodies as CSIRO, the Council of <b>Aeronautics</b> (of which he was a member), Aeronautical Research Laboratories, and local aircraft manufacturers deHavilland Australia, Government Aircraft Factories, and CAC. He further initiated RAAF sponsorship of a chair of <b>aeronautics</b> at the University of Sydney. Wackett was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1957 New Years Honours. Two years later, his wife Doreen was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire for her service as Vice President and, from 1948, President of the RAAF Women's Association.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Shea took a {{position}} at Raytheon in Lexington, Massachusetts. He would remain with the company {{until his retirement in}} 1990, serving as Senior Vice President for Engineering from 1981 through 1990. After leaving Raytheon, Shea became an adjunct professor of <b>aeronautics</b> and astronautics at MIT.|$|E
5|$|In July 1941, Radford was {{appointed}} {{commander of the}} Naval Air Station in Trinidad, British West Indies. He protested this appointment because he feared he would remain there for years, sidelined as World War II loomed. In the event he only remained in this station for three months, following an organizational shift in the Bureau of <b>Aeronautics.</b> By mid-1941, thanks to a large expansion in the naval aviator program, squadrons could no longer train newly arrived aviators. Further, at that time, the vast difference {{in the performance of}} combat aircraft over training aircraft meant that pilots needed more time in combat aircraft before becoming proficient in them. Radford was subsequently visited by Artemus L. Gates, Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Air. The latter was so impressed that he ordered Rear Admiral John H. Towers, chief of the Bureau of <b>Aeronautics,</b> to transfer Radford to a newly formed training division.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the accident, the Civil <b>Aeronautics</b> Administration (CAA) issued an Airworthiness Directive ordering all DC-6 and DC-6B aircraft to be fitted with a manual device which could prevent the inadvertent reversal of the propeller blades. United Airlines also stated they had begun installing reverse thrust indicator lights in the cockpits of their DC-6 aircraft, which would warn pilots when a propeller had reversed.|$|E
5|$|Lunney is a Fellow of the American Astronomical Society {{and of the}} American Institute of <b>Aeronautics</b> and Astronautics. In 1971, he {{was awarded}} an honorary Doctorate from the University of Scranton. He has {{received}} many awards from NASA, including three Group Achievement Awards, two Exceptional Service Medals and three Distinguished Service Medals.|$|E
5|$|National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and Civil <b>Aeronautics</b> Board (CAB) {{investigations}} {{determined that}} evasive maneuvers undertaken by Flight 663 {{to avoid an}} oncoming Pan Am Boeing 707 caused the pilot to suffer spatial disorientation and lose control of the aircraft. The accident is the third-worst accident involving a DC-7.|$|E
5|$|Orville Wright served NACA for 28 years. In 1930, he {{received}} the first Daniel Guggenheim Medal established in 1928 by the Daniel Guggenheim Fund for the Promotion of <b>Aeronautics.</b> In 1936, he was elected {{a member of the}} National Academy of Sciences.|$|E
5|$|Parsons' {{obituary}} listed him as {{a member}} of the Army Ordnance Association, the American Institute of <b>Aeronautics</b> and Astronautics, the American Chemical Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, anddespite his lack of an academic degreethe Sigma Xi fraternity. It also stated that he had turned down several honorary degrees.|$|E
5|$|The Civil <b>Aeronautics</b> Board (CAB), {{part of the}} Department of Transportation, {{were the}} primary {{investigators}} into the crash of Flight 2511. The wreckage of the DC-6 {{was taken to a}} hangar at nearby Wilmington Airport, where the fuselage was reassembled on a wood-and-chicken-wire frame. Investigators recovered approximately 90% of the fuselage, which was then assembled on the frame in the Wilmington hangar.|$|E
5|$|The Civil <b>Aeronautics</b> Board {{received}} {{notification of}} the accident at 10:10 AM EST and immediately sent investigators to Jamaica Bay to conduct an investigation. The flight recorder was found on March 9 and sent to Washington for analysis. Public hearings were held at the International Hotel in New York on March 20–23, 1962.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of the US project was revealed in 2000 by a former executive at the National <b>Aeronautics</b> and Space Administration (NASA), Leonard Reiffel, who led the project in 1958. A young Carl Sagan {{was part of the}} team responsible for predicting the effects of a nuclear explosion in vacuum and low gravity and in evaluating the scientific value of the project.|$|E
5|$|The rise of Fascism and Nazism in the 1920s and 1930s {{led many}} European scientists, {{including}} Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, and John von Neumann, to immigrate to the United States. During World War II, the Manhattan Project developed nuclear weapons, ushering in the Atomic Age, while the Space Race produced rapid advances in rocketry, materials science, and <b>aeronautics.</b>|$|E
5|$|TrollSat sees only a {{fraction}} of the business of SvalSat. Troll is used for downloading from the Canadian Space Agency's Radarsat-1 and Radarsat-2, and the private GeoEye-1, WorldView-1 and WorldView-2. It will also be one of thirty ground stations for the European Space Agency (ESA)'s satellite navigation system Galileo, and is Norway's main contribution to the project. It further serves ESA's Envisat and several National <b>Aeronautics</b> and Space Administration satellites.|$|E
