Tricyclazole is a non-included active substance and no EU uses are currently authorized. Thus, the existing EU MRL of 1 mg/kg in rice should be lowered to the LOQ. The applicant requested to maintain the existing EU MRL to allow the import of rice treated with tricyclazole from third countries. The EMS confirmed that the MRL should be set provisionally at the level 1 mg/kg to accommodate the Brazilian GAP. EFSA is of the opinion that {{on the basis of the}} currently available studies, the toxicological reference values for tricyclazole cannot be set, since the genotoxic potential of tricyclazole could not be totally disregarded. In addition, uncertainties regarding the carcinogenic potential of tricyclazole were identified by EFSA. The submitted residue trials data were found to be insufficient to derive an MRL proposal which accommodates the use of tricyclazole on rice in Brazil. EFSA concludes that the import tolerance request for tricyclazole in rice is not sufficiently supported by data which are needed to justify maintaining the existing EU MRL of 1 mg/kg in rice...|$|E
40|$|Since the 1980 s power {{distribution}} in agrofood networks {{has changed in}} many countries in Africa, Latin-America, South Asia, and the postsocialist countries in Europe and Asia. In the course of economic liberalization, retail and wholesale trade {{as well as the}} food processing and <b>agroscience</b> sector were opened up to foreign investment. Within the frame of such liberalization many states gradually refrained from directly governing this sector and reregulated the trade in a way that gave private companies the possibility to implement new power structures. We analyze the so-called ‘Food Chain Partnership’ (FCP) program implemented by the transnational company Bayer in India as an example for private governance in agrofood networks. Bayer is advancing and coordinating relations between the food processing and retailing industry and farmers. We explore whether such private activity can substitute for the activities of state institutions in governing agrofood networks. As the case study will show, the FCP model is highly selective in terms of farmers, who can participate (criteria include minimum farm size, irrigation facility, literacy, agricultural practices, and mobile phones), the crops that are covered, and the information passed on to the farmers. This limits the potential of market-driven instruments like the FCP to replace the traditional trade system as they concentrate only on those regions and products which are promising most profit to the companies. The global production network approach builds the analytical framework of this paper. ...|$|E
40|$|Random forest (RF) is {{a widely}} used machine {{learning}} method that shows competitive prediction performance in various fields, including biological science, finance, chemical engineering, <b>agroscience,</b> medical analysis, etc. In this dissertation, we study some characteristics and modifications of RFs {{in order to improve}} its prediction performance. In CHAPTER 1, we review the mechanics of classification and regression trees (CARTs), bootstrap aggregation (bagging) and RFs. The properties of RFs are discussed, along with several variations of this method. In CHAPTER 2, we describe a counter-intuitive discovery using RFs: the out-of-sample prediction errors can be reduced by augmenting the regressor with a new scientifically meaningless predictor variable independent of all variables in the dataset. We explain this phenomenon using a simulated example and discuss the importance of this result in interpreting predictor variable importance in RFs. RF predictions can be biased. In CHAPTER 3, we apply an iterative debiasing approach based on bagging to RFs and test this bias correction method with real datasets. The debiasing approach can significantly improve RF predictions. The number of debiasing iterations can be tuned using cross-validation. Standard RF methodology generates a common RF from a given training sample, regardless of test cases. In CHAPTER 4, we propose a new way to grow a RF specifically predicting a particular test case, namely, Case-Specific Random Forests (CSRF). We also suggest Case-Specific Variable Importance (CSVI), a new definition of predictor variable importance in terms of the prediction performance on a particular test case. Prediction error estimation is generally useful in evaluation of a prediction rule. All present methods deal with estimating prediction errors averaging over the distribution of a test set. In CHAPTER 5, we propose a method to estimate expected prediction loss on a specific regressor point using RF methodology...|$|E

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2013. Includes bibliographical references. Oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) (Diptera: Tephritidae) causes serious {{economic}} loss for papaya (Carica papaya L.) production in Hawaiʻi through direct fruit damage and restriction of export commodities. Suppression of female flies {{was a challenge}} until a protein-based bait contains reduced risk insecticide spinosad became available, GF- 120 NF Fruit Fly Bait (GF- 120; Dow <b>AgroScience,</b> Indianapolis, IN). This bait provides an environmentally sound alternative to conventional cover spraysof organophosphate insecticides. Factors that influence the attractiveness of protein bait include chemical composition, visual stimuli, and competing volatiles from host fruits. This dissertation focuses on biological factors that affect the foraging response of female B. dorsalis to volatiles emitted by protein bait. Female reproductive state and dietary experience are two biological variables that shape {{the manner in which}} a fly searches for and responds to essential resources such as food and egg-laying sites. The experiments reported in this dissertation were conducted in order to assess the influence of physiological states on the response of female B. dorsalis to protein bait in papaya orchards. In Chapter 1, baseline information on key morphological characters in B. dorsalis ovarian development and the associated morphometric parameter of each oogenesis stage is collected. Four oogenesis stages include previtellogenesis, vitellogenesis, gravid and parous. In Chapter 2, field observations were conducted to determine reproductive states of B. dorsalis females (using ovarian developmental stage as an indicator) that respond to 2 two protein bait trapping devices: visually enhanced attract-and-kill bait stations termed papaya leaf mimics (PLMs) treated with GF- 120 and dome traps containing torula yeast solution. Females with ovaries at previtellogenesis stage and egg laying females are the two main classes that responded to protein bait. Visual stimuli from the bait stations enhanced the response of immature females to protein bait but this effect was not found in egg-laying females. Yellow color also increased the capture of females with greater egg loads compared to those captured by green bait stations. This is an important finding for improved fruit fly management because reducing numbers of egg-laying females within an area results in lower fruit infestation. The physiological state of foraging flies determines the level of food searching behavior. In Chapter 3, the effects of female age and dietary history on the propensity of B. dorsalis to alight on protein bait were quantified. One week old females exposed to papaya as a diet source for 4 d {{in the first week of}} adult life showed a significantly greater propensity of alighting on GF- 120 protein bait than females fed on a protein or sugar diet. Delay of ovarian development from feeding on a sugar only diet resulted in significantly higher response of 4 week old females to protein bait than females fed on papaya or protein. On the contrary, ovarian development in papaya fed females was not significantly different than that of protein fed females. Feeding on papaya during weeks 2 to 4 of adult life increased the response of female flies to protein bait at a lesser level than for 1 week old females. These results are evidence of the possible physiological profile of females attracted to protein bait in the natural environments. In addition, previous exposure to papaya fruit enhanced the response of females to papaya compared to females without the experience. This is a finding that suggests sanitation practice of removing culled fruit not only removes a breeding source but may also reduce the number of females re-entering orchards. Studies conducted in this dissertation are the first documentation of the response of egg-laying female B. dorsalis to protein bait under natural and semi-natural conditions. Results suggest that protein baits such as GF- 120 attract females with developing ovaries as well as egg-laying females. In addition, fruit-based diet enhances the response of female B. dorsalis to protein bait and host fruit stimuli...|$|E
