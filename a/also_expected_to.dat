Islam requires {{both men and women}} to dress modestly; this concept is known as hijab and covers a wide interpretation of behavior and garments. There is mixed opinion among feminists over extremes of externally imposed control. Women from other religions are <b>also</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> follow dress codes.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} few months after the election, Modi made trips to a number of {{different}} countries to further the goals of his policy, and attended the BRICS, ASEAN, and G20 summits. One of Modi's first visits as prime minister was to Nepal, during which he promised a billion USD in aid. Modi also made several overtures to the United States, including multiple visits to that country. While this was described as an unexpected development, due to the US having previously denied Modi a travel visa over his role during the 2002 Gujarat riots, it was <b>also</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> strengthen diplomatic and trade relations between the two countries.|$|E
5|$|Global {{warming is}} {{expected}} to have a number of negative long-term ecological impacts on the region, including drought, increased forest fires, forest degradation to drought and disease, and less healthy or nonexistent salmon runs. The distribution and survival of plant species, especially those that inhabit alpine environments, as well as animals that are specifically adapted to those environments, will also be adversely affected. Glaciers are <b>also</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> recede due to a decreased buildup of snowpack and higher overall temperatures.|$|E

5|$|In {{parallel}} {{with the construction of}} the works, trunk sewers were built to convey sewage from the city to the works. These was a major programme of expansion to the sewer network in 1910, to ensure that it could cope with the expected volumes of effluent produced. Because British sewers are <b>also</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> handle rainwater, a series of storm sewage overflows were provided, which resulted in diluted sewage being discharged into the River Don in times of heavy rainfall.|$|E

Bullock made his loan permanent and signed an 18-month contract, and David Brown signed after impressing on a trial. Five players also left Valley Parade on loan deals during January, with Craig Bentham joining Farsley Celtic, Luke Medley joining Cambridge City, Sean Taylforth and Luke Morgan both going to Droylsden, and Simon Ainge joining Halifax Town. Goalkeeper Donovan Ricketts was <b>also</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> leave but his transfer to Queens Park Rangers collapsed after the Home Office rejected his application for a work permit.|$|E

5|$|The {{hurricane}} was <b>also</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> re-strengthen {{prior to}} its second landfall in Mexico, though the Weather Bureau also noted {{that there was a}} chance for the storm to affect Texas. Although the possibility never materialized, the agency expected rain bands and rough seas to affect southern Texas, and small watercraft were urged to remain in ports until the hurricane moved inland. On August 21, the cyclone was expected to move ashore between Nautla and Tuxpan, though it eventually made landfall further north near Tampico. Local officials expressed concerns about residents in huts and other vulnerable structures. In the Harlingen Valley region of southern Texas, precautionary measures were taken and Red Cross divisions organized a meeting at the local city hall. City departments and facilities were ready for disposal if the cyclone moved closer to the area. The cyclone's rains were <b>also</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> impact unpicked cotton plants in the region. In advance of the storm, a Coast Guard plane dropped messages from the air to several vessels, advising them to seek shelter. In Tampico, oil industries erected barriers to protect fields, and authorities planned to evacuate residents from the surrounding low-lying areas. Thousands of residents stayed in refugee centers on elevated ground.|$|E
5|$|The {{main purpose}} for kulintang {{music in the}} {{community}} is to function as social entertainment at a nonprofessional, folk level. This music is unique {{in that it is}} considered a public music in the sense everyone is allowed to participate. Not only do the players play, but audience members are <b>also</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> participate. These performances are important in that they bring people in the community and adjacent regions together, helping unify communities that otherwise may not have interacted with one another. Traditionally, when performers play kulintang music, their participation is voluntary. Musicians see performances as an opportunity to receive recognition, prestige and respect from the community and nothing more.|$|E
5|$|All {{roentgenium}} isotopes {{are extremely}} unstable and radioactive; in general, the heavier isotopes are {{more stable than}} the lighter. The most stable known roentgenium isotope, 282Rg, is also the heaviest known roentgenium isotope; it has a half-life of 2.1minutes. (The unconfirmed 286Rg is even heavier and appears to have an even longer half-life of about 11minutes, {{which would make it}} one of the longest-lived superheavy nuclides known.) The isotopes 280Rg and 281Rg have also been reported to have half-lives over a second. The remaining isotopes have half-lives in the millisecond range. The undiscovered isotope 287Rg has been predicted to be the most stable towards beta decay; however, no known roentgenium isotope has been observed to undergo beta decay. The unknown isotopes 277Rg and 283Rg are <b>also</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> have long half-lives of 1second and 10minutes respectively. Before their discovery, the isotopes 278Rg, 281Rg, and 282Rg were predicted to have long half-lives of 1second, 1minute, and 4minutes respectively; however, they were discovered to have shorter half-lives of 4.2milliseconds, 17seconds, and 2.1minutes respectively.|$|E

5|$|As Kujira {{began to}} track towards Taiwan, the Taiwanese {{government}} issued land- and sea-based warnings {{in advance of}} the storm. The local weather bureau specifically alerted vessels off the southern and southeastern coasts of the island. Continued strengthening of Kujira prompted the Central Weather Bureau to issue medium typhoon warnings for several portions of Taiwan, though these warnings were downgraded to light typhoon status following the subsequent weakening of the typhoon on April22. This made Kujira the first April typhoon to prompt the issuance of any cyclone-related warnings in Taiwan since 1978. Impacts on the island were expected to be limited to rainfall, though the forecasted precipitation was <b>also</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> lessen ongoing drought conditions. However, mudslides were also a potential impact from the typhoon. The National Fire Administration and Taiwan Power Company developed a contingency plan for the typhoon and had also undertaken other precautionary measures. Airports on Orchid Island and Green Island were closed. The resultant rainfall from Kujira's outer rainbands would be some of the most significant for the island in several months.|$|E
5|$|Coming off {{a loss to}} Minnesota the {{preceding}} week, Penn State looked to defeat Purdue, which they had in every meeting since 2004. Though expected to beat an overmatched Purdue squad that was reeling, having lost 38–14 the prior week against Iowa, and 56–0 the week before that against Ohio State, and entering {{the game with a}} 1–8 record, the Lions would have to do so with even less depth than normal. At his mid-week press conference, Bill O'Brien announced at the midweek press conference that Ben Kline would miss the remainder of the season with a shoulder injury, for which he sustained surgery. There was also some pregame concentration surrounding the receiving corps – Allen Robinson was listed on the injury report with a shoulder injury, and Geno Lewis, who had proved to be a potential big play threat early in the season when he caught a 54-yard touchdown pass against Syracuse, but had recently been relegated to special teams, was <b>also</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> receive increased playing time in Penn State's second-to-last home game of the season.|$|E
5|$|David S. Goyer and Zack Snyder are set {{to write}} and direct a sequel to Man of Steel, respectively.

On June 16, 2013, The Wall Street Journal {{reported}} that the studio is possibly planning to release the sequel in 2014. Warner Bros. announced that Superman and Batman will unite in a new film which will be the follow-up to Man of Steel, set for release in 2015. Goyer stated at the Superman 75th Anniversary Panel at 2013 San Diego Comic-Con International, that Batman and Superman would face off, and titles under consideration are Superman Vs Batman and Batman Vs Superman. On August 22, 2013, it was announced that Ben Affleck was cast as Batman. On December 4, 2013, it was reported that Gal Gadot was cast as Wonder Woman.|$|E

5|$|Days {{before the}} coup, fellow Lusophone country Angola {{announced}} its forces would be ending the two-year-old Angolan Military Mission in Guinea Bissau (MISSANG) that followed a similar failed {{effort by the}} European Union {{as part of the}} United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Guinea-Bissau (UNIOGBIS). State-owned Angolan news agency ANGOP said that the Angolan troops were sent to Guinea-Bissau in March 2011 in accordance with a bilateral military agreement to reform the armed forces. On 16 April, Guinea-Bissau Defense Minister Jorge Tolentino Araújo was scheduled to arrive in Angola to meet his counterpart Cândido Pereira dos Santos Van-Dúnem and the Army Chief-of-Staff Geraldo Sachipengo Nunda. He was <b>also</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> visit the Higher Warfare School (ESG) and the Higher Technical Military Institute (ISTM). The same day as the coup, the two Lusophone countries of Angola and Cape Verde agreed to review their defense cooperation agreements. Presidential candidate and former Prime Minister Carlos Gomes Júnior was also unpopular with the army for his attempts to reform the institution.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{stabilization}} of its outer 8s electrons, unbinilium's first ionization energy—the energy required to remove an electron from a neutral atom—is predicted to be 6.0eV, {{comparable to that}} of calcium. The electron of the hydrogen-like unbinilium atom—oxidized so it has only one electron, Ubn119+—is predicted to move so quickly that its mass is 2.05 times that of a non-moving electron, a feature coming from the relativistic effects. For comparison, the figure for hydrogen-like radium is 1.30 and the figure for hydrogen-like barium is 1.095. According to simple extrapolations of relativity laws, that indirectly indicates the contraction of the atomic radius to around 200pm, very close to that of strontium (215pm); the ionic radius of the Ubn2+ ion is also correspondingly lowered to 160pm. The trend in electron affinity is <b>also</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> reverse direction similarly at radium and unbinilium.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} first cities in the United States were chosen to host Major League Soccer teams, Seattle was {{considered}} a viable location for a professional team. In 1994, as the U.S. was preparing to host the FIFA World Cup, more than 30 cities were pursuing the rights to an MLS team, Seattle being among them. However, despite the strong soccer fan base in Seattle, {{the absence of a}} soccer-only stadium was a drawback to establishing an MLS team. Cities seeking consideration for an inaugural MLS team were <b>also</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> secure 10,000 assurances from fans for season tickets. By the June 3, 1994 deadline for MLS team bids, Seattle organizers had secured fewer than 1,500 such assurances. These low numbers were a result of competition between the ticket campaign for the MLS expansion team and for the American Professional Soccer League (APSL) Sounders expansion team.|$|E
