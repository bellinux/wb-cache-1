5|$|Although Pericles was a {{main source}} of his inspiration, some historians have noted that the passionate and idealistic {{literary}} style of the speeches Thucydides attributes to Pericles is completely at odds with Thucydides' own cold <b>and</b> <b>analytical</b> writing style. This might, however, {{be the result of}} the incorporation of the genre of rhetoric into the genre of historiography. That is to say, Thucydides could simply have used two different writing styles for two different purposes.|$|E

5|$|Forensic {{chemistry}} positions {{require a}} bachelor's degree or similar {{in a natural}} or physical science as well as laboratory experience in general, organic, <b>and</b> <b>analytical</b> chemistry.

Practicing chemists already {{in the field are}} expected to have continuing education to maintain their proficiency.|$|E
5|$|Some critics {{consider}} Balzac's writing exemplary of naturalism—a more pessimistic <b>and</b> <b>analytical</b> form of realism, {{which seeks}} to explain human behavior as intrinsically linked with the environment. French novelist Émile Zola declared Balzac {{the father of the}} naturalist novel. Zola indicated that whilst the Romantics saw the world through a colored lens, the naturalist sees through a clear glass—precisely the sort of effect Balzac attempted to achieve in his works.|$|E
5|$|In early 11th century, the Persian scholar Al Biruni visited India, {{lived with}} Hindus for 16 years, {{and with their}} help {{translated}} several significant Sanskrit works into Arabic and Persian languages. One of these was Patanjali's Yogasutras. Al Biruni's translation preserved many of the core themes of Patañjali 's Yoga philosophy, but certain sutras <b>and</b> <b>analytical</b> commentaries were restated making it more consistent with Islamic monotheistic theology. Al Biruni's version of Yoga Sutras reached Persia and Arabian peninsula by about 1050 AD. Later, in the 16th century, the hath yoga text Amritakunda was translated into Arabic and then Persian. Yoga was, however, not accepted by mainstream Sunni and Shia Islam. Minority Islamic sects such as the mystic Sufi movement, particularly in South Asia, adopted Indian yoga practises, including postures and breath control. Muhammad Ghawth, a Shattari Sufi {{and one of the}} translators of yoga text in 16th century, drew controversy for his interest in yoga and was persecuted for his Sufi beliefs.|$|E

5|$|Kilmer {{was born}} December 6, 1886, in New Brunswick, New Jersey, {{the fourth and}} {{youngest}} child, of Annie Ellen Kilburn (1849–1932), a minor writer and composer, and Dr. Frederick Barnett Kilmer (1851–1934), a physician <b>and</b> <b>analytical</b> chemist employed by the Johnson and Johnson Company and inventor of the company's baby powder. He was named Alfred Joyce Kilmer after two priests at Christ Church in New Brunswick: Alfred R. Taylor, the curate; and the Rev. Dr. Elisha Brooks Joyce (1857–1926), the rector. Christ Church is the oldest Episcopal parish in New Brunswick and the Kilmer family were parishioners. Rector Joyce, who served the parish from 1883 to 1916, baptised the young Kilmer, who remained an Episcopalian until his 1913 conversion to Catholicism. Kilmer's birthplace in New Brunswick, where the Kilmer family lived from 1886 to 1892, is still standing, and houses a small museum to Kilmer, {{as well as a}} few Middlesex County government offices.|$|E
