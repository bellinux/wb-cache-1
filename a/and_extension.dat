5|$|Switzerland's {{trade was}} {{blockaded}} {{by both the}} Allies and by the Axis.

5|$|The primary {{symptom of}} prepatellar {{bursitis}} is the {{swelling of the}} area around the kneecap.

Unlike arthritis, prepatellar bursitis generally does not affect the range of motion of the knee, though it may cause some discomfort when the knee is completely flexed.

5|$|Despite the {{extensive}} volcanism that gives Io its distinctive appearance, nearly all its mountains are tectonic structures, {{and are not}} produced by volcanoes. Instead, most Ionian mountains form {{as the result of}} compressive stresses on the base of the lithosphere, which uplift and often tilt chunks of Io's crust through thrust faulting. The compressive stresses leading to mountain formation are the result of subsidence from the continuous burial of volcanic materials. The global distribution of mountains appears to be opposite that of volcanic structures; mountains dominate areas with fewer volcanoes and vice versa. This suggests large-scale regions in Io's lithosphere where compression (supportive of mountain formation) <b>and</b> <b>extension</b> (supportive of patera formation) dominate. Locally, however, mountains and paterae often abut one another, suggesting that magma often exploits faults formed during mountain formation to reach the surface.|$|E
