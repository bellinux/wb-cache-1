25|$|According to Rapid Assessment surveys {{conducted}} by the World Bank Group in 2011 and 2012, business managers rank informal gifts or payments, <b>anticompetitive</b> <b>practices</b> and regulatory policy uncertainty {{high on the list}} of obstacles to creating and growing a business. These impediments have a chilling effect on foreign investment in Egypt which means that local businesses cannot be competitive in the international economy because of the high costs of raising capital. In addition, the amount of paperwork required for construction, imports, and exports is burdensome and the time for the government to process this paperwork is lengthy. Traders need to submit 8 documents to export and 10 to import—as opposed to France, for example, where only 2 documents are needed both for imports and exports. The high cost of doing business leads to fewer businesses operating within Egypt which causes unemployment. Egypt's unemployment rate reached 11.8 percent in the second quarter of 2011, down from 11.9 percent in the first quarter (although higher than last year's 8.96 percent). Additionally, there is no bankruptcy law in Egypt and entrepreneurs that fail to pay debts can face prison sentences.|$|E

40|$|The paper investigates pro- and anticompetitive e¤ects {{of the use}} {{of market}} share {{discounts}} (MSD’s). While MSD’s can be used for exploiting a dominant position and may lead to a welfare reduction, MSD’s also can serve as an e ¢ cient device for the creation of incentives.

5000|$|Another major <b>anticompetitive</b> <b>practice</b> is {{supported}} (indirectly) by various state laws which prohibit the [...] "sharing" [...] of commissions with unlicensed individuals. In broad interpretations, this is deemed {{to prevent a}} buyers' agent from providing a credit {{to his or her}} buyers from commissions received. Currently, there are 10 states where real estate agents and brokers are barred from offering homebuyers or sellers cash rebates or gifts of any kind with a cash value more than $25. Various Realtors in such states have successfully contested this interpretation in states which now allow the practice (notably, Patrick Lea, a Realtor in Ohio, and numerous agents in Kentucky). The Kentucky case was ultimately tried with the United States Department of Justice as the plaintiff and the Kentucky Real Estate Commission as the defendant.|$|R

40|$|It is well {{established}} that an incumbent firm may use exclusivity contracts so as to monopolize an industry or deter entry. Such an <b>anticompetitive</b> <b>practice</b> could be tolerated if it were associated with sufficiently large efficiency gains, e. g. insuring buyers against price volatility. In this paper we study the trade-off between positive effects (risk sharing) and negative effects (exclusion) of exclusivity contracts. We revisit the seminal model of Aghion and Bolton (1987) under risk-aversion and show that although exclusivity contracts induce optimal risk-sharing, {{they can be used}} not only to deter the entry of a more efficient rival on the product market but also to crowd out financial investors willing to insure the buyer at competitive rates. We further show that in a world without financial investors, purely financial bilateral instruments, such as forward contracts, achieve optimal risk sharing without distorting product market outcomes. Thus, {{there is no room for}} an insurance defens...|$|R

40|$|With {{the recent}} Kone judgment, the European Court of Justice has faced {{a debate on}} the {{admissibility}} of actions for damages suffered {{as a consequence of}} the umbrella effect in the private enforcement of European competition law. In particular, the Court was questioned about whether the right to compensation for damages suffered by the victims of a cartel is also valid for the customers of an undertaking not party to that cartel which decided to raise the prices of its own products above the normal market price under conditions of competition, taking advantage of the price distortion produced by the cartel. Recognizing this right to compensation suggests the likelihood of damage claims, even when those impacted by the <b>anticompetitive</b> <b>practice</b> are not in any way linked to business activities that infringe competition rules.

40|$|Cartels, {{which are}} {{considered}} {{as the most}} harmful <b>anticompetitive</b> <b>practice,</b> continue to exist in many sectors {{of the global economy}} in spite of the severe sanctions regularly imposed on the cartelists by the competition authorities worldwide. This suggests that the approach to antitrust enforcement requires rethinking, and the necessity to move beyond the traditional enforcement approach, to creating a pro-compliance culture in companies.  The paper suggests that robust compliance programmes, voluntarily implemented by companies to prevent infringements of competition law could be considered as one of the major elements of cartel deterrence. The paper reviews the pioneering experience of UK competition authorities in rewarding infringing companies for their efforts to comply with competition law – by reducing fines for committed violations, such as participation in cartels. The paper analyses the UK approach through the prism of its possible application in Russia, where antimonopoly laws continue to actively respond to the development of the best international competition practice, including cartel deterrence. The relative position of officials in the Russian antimonopoly body, the FAS, with respect to advocating antimonopoly compliance in Russia is presented in this work through an interview conducted by the author of this paper. The work formulates a three-step plan, embracing particular measures to develop competition compliance culture in Russia. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{financial}} crisis {{drew attention to}} the crucial role of transparency and the independence of financial certification intermediaries, in particular, statutory auditors. Now any <b>anticompetitive</b> <b>practice</b> involving coordinated increases in prices or concomitant changes in quality that impacts financial information affects the effectiveness of this intermediation. It is therefore not surprising that the competitive analysis of the audit market is a critical factor in regulating financial systems, all the more so as this market is marked by various barriers to entry, such as the incompatibility of certification tasks with the preparation of financial statements or consulting, the expertise on (and the ability to apply) international standards for the presentation of financial information, the need to attract top young graduates, the prohibition of advertising, or the two-sided nature of this market where the quality of financial information results from the interaction between the reputation of auditors and audited firms. Against this backdrop, we propose a legal and economic study of the risks of collective dominance in the statutory audit market in France using the criteria set by Airtours case and, in particular, by analyzing how regulatory obligations incumbent on statutory auditors may favour the appearance of tacit collusion. Our analysis suggests that nothing prevents collective dominance of the auditors of the Big Four group in France to exist, which is potentially detrimental to {{the economy as a whole}} as the audit industry may fail to provide the optimal level of financial information.

40|$|A {{market economy}} is the economy in which both {{physical}} persons and legal entities act in a legal framework established {{by the government and}} where the government does not have a major intervention on the market. Competition provides choices, improves product quality through efficient use of resources and stimulates economic growth by increasing investments. Some of the economic resources are land, labor and capital. Another resource is entrepreneurship, that is the individual's capacity to transform the production of economic resources in a business. The role of competition in a market economy is to allow more people and businesses to use resources as efficiently as possible in order to obtain the best products. To have a market functioning properly, it must comply with principles such as the principle of good faith or the consumers. These principles give the manufacturers the freedom to conduct their business according to their own decisions and to be protected only if they base their success on their own merits.

It then reviews systematic empirical evidence on the value of antitrust derived from informal experiments involving the behavior of U.
