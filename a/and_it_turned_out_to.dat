25|$|This time, Rytas, led by Renaldas Seibutis and Martynas Gecevičius, was {{successful}} – it won {{three games in}} a row (against VEF Rīga, EWE Oldenburg and Telenet Oostende), and qualified for the Euroleague. To strengthen the team roster before Euroleague games, Lietuvos rytas signed former NBA and Lithuania national team player Darius Songaila. On 18 October 2013, Lietuvos rytas started the 2013–14 Euroleague season with a 84–83 victory against Panathinaikos Athens after Renaldas Seibutis's winning shot in overtime. The game was named as the Euroleague's Game of the Week and re-broadcast in over 150 countries worldwide. However, after this, the level of play for the Lithuanian team dropped significantly and Rytas was not able to win any more games. 6 games were lost by 10 points or more <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be worst Lietuvos rytas season ever in Euroleague. Following the fiasco, coach Dirk Bauermann was replaced by Croat Aleksandar Petrović. The change helped and on 22 December 2013, Rytas crushed its rival Žalgiris with the result 90–58. After being eliminated in the Eurocup playoffs by KK Crvena zvezda, Lietuvos rytas also sufered a shocking defeat in the LKF Cup finals, losing to BC Prienai 91–92, leading to the firing of coach Aleksandar Petrović, who was replaced by Dainius Adomaitis.|$|E

On their second possession of the half, they advanced 66 yards to the 49ers 7-yard line before defensive back Johnnie Jackson picked off a third down pass intended for Monk in the end zone. Early in the fourth quarter, Monk caught three passes for 63 yards on a drive to the San Francisco 15, only to see Rypien get hit as he threw a pass, which floated right into the hands of cornerback Darryl Pollard. Linebacker Monte Coleman quickly gave the Redskins another chance {{to get back in the}} game, intercepting a pass from Montana and returning it 18 yards to the 49ers 19-yard line with 10:28 left in regulation. Faced with fourth down and 5 from the 14, Rypien threw the ball to receiver Gary Clark in the end zone. Defensive back Eric Davis seemed to make contact with Clark before the ball arrived, but no flag was thrown and the pass fell incomplete, causing a turnover on downs. In the closing minutes of the game, 49ers linebacker Charles Haley deflected a pass from Rypien into the arms of 295 pound defensive tackle Michael Carter, who rumbled 61 yards to the end zone to make the final score 28-10.|$|E

Later with stepbrother, Darren Osborne (Ashley Taylor Dawson), as her agent, she first auditioned for a girl band, (X-Pose) <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be a money scam.

Joe subsequently ignored and humiliated Steph. Outraged, Steph sold her story to a tabloid and a TV show, angering her family and causing Debbie to lose her job. By late 2006, Steph's fame had fizzled out. Darren then arranged for her to sleep with a footballer, in the hopes of extending her celebrity status. Steph's brother Craig was furious, and tried to talk her out of prostituting herself. Steph went along with the plan. The next morning, Steph realised the man had lied to Darren and was actually just a mascot for a football team. A humiliated Steph quit.|$|E

500|$|In 2017, Nolan {{directed}} and produced Dunkirk, {{based on his}} own original screenplay. The story is set amid World War II and the evacuation of Allied soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk, France in 1940. During the year-long production of his first film, Following (1998), Nolan and Thomas hired a small sailing boat to take them across the English Channel and retrace the journey of the little ships of Dunkirk. [...] "We did {{it at the same}} time of year to get a sense of what it was like, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be an incredibly dangerous experience. And that was with no bombs dropping on us." [...] For Dunkirk, Nolan said he was inspired by the work of Robert Bresson, silent films such as Intolerance (1916) and [...] (1927) as well as by The Wages of Fear (1953). Describing the film as a survival tale with a triptych structure, he wanted to make a [...] "sensory, almost experimental movie" [...] with minimal dialogue. Nolan said he waited to make Dunkirk until he had earned the trust of a major studio to let him make it as a British film, but with an American budget. Before filming, Nolan also sought advice from Spielberg, who later said in an interview with Variety, [...] "Knowing and respecting that Chris [...] is one of the world's most imaginative filmmakers, my advice to him was to leave his imagination, as I did on Ryan, in second position to the research he was doing to authentically acquit this historical drama." [...] Starring Fionn Whitehead, Jack Lowden, Aneurin Barnard, Harry Styles, Tom Hardy, Mark Rylance, Cillian Murphy and Kenneth Branagh, Dunkirk was released in theaters on 21 July 2017 to widespread critical acclaim and strong box office results, grossing over $520 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing World War II film of all time. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote in his review: [...] "It's one of the best war films ever made, distinct in its look, in its approach and in the effect it has on viewers. There are movies—they are rare—that lift you out of your present circumstances and immerse you so fully in another experience that you watch in a state of jaw-dropped awe. Dunkirk is that kind of movie." [...] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times lauded the film, calling it [...] "a tour de force of cinematic craft and technique, but one that is unambiguously in the service of a sober, sincere, profoundly moral story that closes the distance between yesterday's fights and today's." ...|$|E
