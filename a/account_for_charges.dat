40|$|First {{principles}} density functional theory (DFT) calculations {{have been}} performed to explore the stability, structural and electronic properties of Be and S codoped graphene sheets. The band-gap of graphene has been tuned by co-doping with beryllium and sulphur at different sites. The results show that by codoping graphene with Be and S, the band-gap increases from zero up to 0. 58 eV depending on the doping sites. The cohesive and {{the formation energies of}} the systems were also determined. All the isomers formed by exploring different doping sites differ notably in stability, bond length and band-gap. Nevertheless, the planar structure of all the systems investigated was preserved even after geometry optimisation. Majority of the isomers that correspond to co-doping at non-equivalent sites favour higher band-gap opening, but lesser stability, than the other set of isomers with equivalent doping sites. Bader charge analysis was adopted to <b>account</b> <b>for</b> <b>charges</b> distribution in the systems. As a result of the difference in electronegativity among carbon atoms and the impurities, it was observed that electrons accumulation occurred more on the carbon atoms in the proximity of Be and S than at any other position in the graphitic systems investigated.

40|$|The 1963 – 64 {{trial of}} Nelson Mandela and other leading {{members of the}} liberation {{movement}} was a political trial par excellence. In the courtroom, the Apartheid government was trying the accused for the crime of sabotage but {{in the court of}} public opinion, it was using the event of the trial to produce images and ideas aimed at slandering and discrediting the African National Congress (ANC) and the movement for a free and democratic South Africa. The defendants, on their part, used their trial to denounce the racist policies of Apartheid and to outline their vision of a post-Apartheid society. In this article, I want to read Nelson Mandela’s counter-historical mobilization of lived experiences and memories of Africans – the scars, chains, the rage and Apartheid’s unlivable juridical bind – as an act of epistemic resistance that re-opened epistemic battles and effected epistemic renegotiations. By submitting himself to the very law he denounces, strategically positioning himself at law’s aporetic sites and moments – those most fragile frontiers that are so heavily policed from transformative interventions – he bears witness to Apartheid’s rotten foundation. Drawing on modes of critique that are performative and genealogical, those that are possible within law’s frameworks and categories, Mandela both obeys and defies the law, uses and critiques it, resists and claims authority, at the very site he is called to <b>account</b> <b>for</b> <b>charges</b> of sabotage.
