Game was highly prized, but very rare, and included venison, wild boar, hare, rabbit, and birds. Kitchen gardens provided herbs, including some, such as tansy, rue, pennyroyal, and hyssop, which are rarely used today. Spices were treasured and very expensive at that time – they included pepper, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and mace. Some spices used then, but no longer today in French cuisine are cubebs, long pepper (both from vines similar to black pepper), grains of paradise, and galengale. Sweet-sour flavors were commonly added to dishes with vinegars and verjus combined with sugar (for the affluent) or honey.

5|$|The {{defeat of}} the U-boats in May 1943 did not signal {{the end of the}} Battle of the Atlantic. Some 60 vessels remained, and posed a threat to convoys. In later months, the Schnorchel, a device {{originated}} by the Dutch and later adopted by the Kriegsmarine after the Germans invaded the Netherlands were capable of allowing a U-boat to replace its air supply and vent its diesel exhaust without surfacing became available. However, it was sensitive to the weather, and put immense pressure <b>and</b> <b>strain</b> on crews who had to remain submerged for long period in hostile waters. Further, Coastal's Mark III radar could detect the mast. The smoke emitted was visible from 1,000 feet. In some cases the mast itself could be seen, some one foot in diameter, projecting two feet and moving at 12–15 knots. The technological response was to use High Tea, a series of sonobuoys dropped by aircraft onto the surface of the sea to detect U-boats. By late 1943, the U-bootwaffe was losing 20 percent of its strength per month. Some 70 percent that did return were seriously damaged.|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{analysis}} of notch-root stresses <b>and</b> <b>strains</b> in bodies subjected to multiaxial loading, a quantitative relationship between Neuber rule <b>and</b> the equivalent <b>strain</b> energy density method is found. In the case of elastic range, both Neuber rule <b>and</b> the equivalent <b>strain</b> energy density method get the same estimation of the local stresses <b>and</b> <b>strains.</b> Whereas {{in the case of}} elastic-plastic range, Neuber rule generally overestimates the notch-root stresses <b>and</b> <b>strains</b> <b>and</b> the equivalent <b>strain</b> energy density method tends to underestimate the notch-root stresses <b>and</b> <b>strains.</b> A modified method is presented considering the material constants of elastic-plastic Poisson's ratio, elastic modulus, shear elastic modulus, and yield stress. The essence of the modified model is to add a modified coefficient to Neuber rule, which makes the calculated results tend to be more precise and reveals its energy meaning. This approach considers the elastic-plastic properties of the material itself and avoids the blindness of selecting coefficient values. Finally the calculation results using the modified model are validated with the experimental data...|$|R

In contrast to many available semi-analytic solutions for residual autofrettage stresses <b>and</b> <b>strains,</b> the von Mises yield criterion and its associated flow rule are adopted. A remarkable property of the solution found is that the residual stresses <b>and</b> <b>strains</b> in the white layer can be determined without solving the strain equations in the plastic region.

40|$|Abstract [Correction Notice: An erratum {{for this}} article was {{reported}} in Vol 92 (1) of Journal of Applied Psychology (see record 2006 - 23339 - 016). The issue number at the upper left corner of the title page (p. 1359) is wrongly stated as 5 rather than 6. Furthermore, in Table 1 (p. 1362), the value in Column 12, Row 4 (Emo resources) should be -. 07 rather than - 0. 7. ] Two longitudinal studies investigated the issue of match between job stressors and job resources in the prediction of job-related strain. On {{the basis of the}} triple-match principle (TMP), it was hypothesized that resources are most likely to moderate the relation between stressors <b>and</b> <b>strains</b> if resources, stressors, <b>and</b> <b>strains</b> all match. Resources are less likely to moderate the relation between stressors <b>and</b> <b>strains</b> if (a) only resources and stressors match, (b) only resources <b>and</b> <b>strains</b> match, or (c) only stressors <b>and</b> <b>strains</b> match. Resources are least likely to moderate the relation between stressors <b>and</b> <b>strains</b> if there is no match among stressors, resources, <b>and</b> <b>strains.</b> The TMP was tested among 280 and 267 health care workers in 2 longitudinal surveys. The likelihood of finding moderating effects was linearly related to the degree of match, with 33. 3 % of all tested interactions becoming significant when there was a triple match, 16. 7 % when there was a double match, and 0. 0 % when there was no match. Findings were most consistent if there was an emotional match or a physical match. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved...|$|R
