5|$|The Dying Swan (originally The Swan) is a solo choreographed by Mikhail Fokine in 1905 to Camille Saint-Saëns's Le Cygne from Le Carnaval des <b>animaux</b> as a pièce d'occasion for the {{ballerina}} Anna Pavlova, {{who performed}} it about 4,000 times. The short ballet (4 minutes) follows the last {{moments in the}} life of a swan, and was first presented in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1905. The ballet has since influenced modern interpretations of Odette in Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake and has inspired non-traditional interpretations and various adaptations.|$|E
5|$|French naturalist Georges Cuvier {{originally}} {{described the}} yellow stingray as Raia jamaicensis in 1816, in Le Règne Animal distribué d'après son organisation pour servir de base à l'histoire naturelle des <b>animaux</b> et d'introduction à l'anatomie comparée. He based his account on specimens obtained from Jamaica, though no type specimens were designated. Subsequent authors moved this species to the genus Urolophus, {{and then to}} the genus Urobatis (some literature still refers to this species as Urolophus jamaicensis). Other common names used for this ray include the yellow-spotted ray, the round ray, and the maid ray.|$|E
5|$|Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744–1829) was {{a member}} of the French Academy of Sciences and a {{professor}} of botany at the Jardin des Plantes and then became the first professor of zoology at the new Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle. He became known for his work on the taxonomy of the invertebrates, especially of molluscs. However, he is mainly remembered for the theory that now bears his name, Lamarckism, and in particular his view that the environment (called by Lamarck the conditions of life) gave rise to permanent, inherited, evolutionary changes in animals. He described his theory in his 1802 Recherches sur l'organisation des corps vivants, and in his 1809 Philosophie Zoologique, and later in his Histoire naturelle des <b>animaux</b> sans vertèbres, (1815–1822).|$|E
5|$|Poulenc {{was briefly}} a soldier {{again during the}} Second World War; he was called up on 2 June 1940 and served in an {{anti-aircraft}} unit at Bordeaux. After France surrendered to Germany, Poulenc was demobilised from the army on 18 July 1940. He spent the summer of that year {{with family and friends}} at Brive-la-Gaillarde in south-central France. In the early months of the war, he had composed little new music, instead re-orchestrating Les biches and reworking his 1932 Sextet for piano and winds. At Brive-la-Gaillarde he began three new works, and once back at his home in Noizay in October he started on a fourth. These were L'Histoire de Babar, le petit éléphant for piano and narrator, the Cello Sonata, the ballet Les <b>Animaux</b> modèles and the song cycle Banalités.|$|E

25|$|In 1798 Cuvier {{published}} his first independent work, the Tableau élémentaire de l'histoire naturelle des <b>animaux,</b> {{which was an}} abridgment of his course of lectures at the École du Pantheon and may {{be regarded as the}} foundation and first statement of his natural classification of the animal kingdom.|$|E
25|$|In 1801, he {{published}} Système des <b>animaux</b> sans vertèbres, a major {{work on the}} classification of invertebrates, a term he coined. In an 1802 publication {{he became one of}} the first to use the term biology in its modern sense. Lamarck continued his work as a premier authority on invertebrate zoology. He is remembered, at least in malacology, as a taxonomist of considerable stature.|$|E
25|$|In 1801, he {{published}} Système des <b>Animaux</b> sans Vertebres, a major {{work on the}} classification of invertebrates. In the work, he introduced definitions of natural groups among invertebrates. He categorized echinoderms, arachnids, crustaceans and annelids, which he separated from the old taxon for worms known as Vermes. Lamarck {{was the first to}} separate arachnids from insects in classification, and he moved crustaceans into a separate class from insects.|$|E
25|$|Louis Fuzelier and Marc-Antoine Legrand titled their {{comic opera}} of 1718 Les <b>animaux</b> raisonnables.

Circe, wishing to be rid of the company of Ulysses, agrees to change back his companions, but only the dolphin is willing. The others, who were formerly a corrupt judge (now a wolf), a financier (a pig), an abused wife (a hen), a deceived husband (a bull) and a flibbertigibbet (a linnet), find their present existence more agreeable.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, some jam {{sessions}} {{with a group}} of musicians in London had resulted in two albums' worth of material, unofficially released without Vangelis' permission in 1978, titled Hypothesis and The Dragon. Vangelis succeeded in taking legal action to have them withdrawn. A more successful project was his scoring of wildlife documentary films in the early 1970s made by French filmmaker Frédéric Rossif. The first soundtrack L'Apocalypse des <b>animaux</b> was released in 1973. In 1972, the student riots of 1968 provided the inspiration for an album titled Fais que ton rêve soit plus long que la nuit (Make Your Dream Last Longer Than the Night), comprising musical passages mixed with news snippets and protest songs; some lyrics were based on graffiti daubed on walls during the riots. He also did music for the 1973 Henry Chapier film Amore.|$|E
25|$|Elsewhere in Europe, {{the monkey}} and cat version appears in Simone Majoli's Latin work Dies caniculares (1588), {{where it is}} told of the antics of the pet monkey of Pope Julius II {{at the start of}} the century; a little later the story {{appeared}} as Un Singe et un Chat in Philippe Deprez's collection of a hundred verse fables, Le Théâtre des <b>animaux</b> (Paris, 1595). It is from one or other of these last two that La Fontaine is said to have adapted his story. Even before he popularised it, the earlier version had been used by two artists: the Roman painter Tommaso Salini and the Dutch animal painter Abraham Hondius. Both of these illustrate the detail that La Fontaine chose to modify, in which the monkey uses the cat's paw to poke out the chestnuts against its will. A third version of the story, yet again quoted as happening recently, was contained in Gemelli Careri's Voyage round the world (1695) and related by 'the admiral of the Portuguese fleet in India' as witnessed by him.|$|E

500|$|André Marie Constant Duméril was {{the first}} author to refer to Torpedo as a genus, in his 1806 Zoologie analytique, ou méthode naturelle de {{classification}} des <b>animaux.</b> Duméril did not name any Torpedo species; the first author to do so was probably Charles Lucien Bonaparte, who assigned Linnaeus's Raja torpedo to the genus Torpedo in 1838. Since at the time T. torpedo was {{the only member of}} the genus, it became the type species. Within the genus Torpedo, the common torpedo is placed within the subgenus Torpedo, which differs from the other subgenus Tetronarce in having spiracles with [...] rims and ornate dorsal coloration. This species may also be referred colloquially to as crampfish, cramp ray, or torpedo ray.|$|E
500|$|In 1785, German naturalist Marcus Elieser Bloch {{described}} a shark that {{he referred to}} Squalus zygaena (a synonym of Sphyrna zygaena, the smooth hammerhead). French zoologist Georges Cuvier, as a brief footnote to the account of S. zygaena in his 1817 Le Règne animal distribué d'après son organisation, pour servir de base à l'histoire naturelle des <b>animaux</b> et d'introduction à l'anatomie comparée, observed that Bloch's specimen (which he labeled [...] "z. nob. Blochii") was not a smooth hammerhead, but rather a different species. Although Cuvier did not propose a proper binomial name, his colleague Achille Valenciennes interpreted it as such in 1822 when he {{described a}}nother specimen {{of the same species}} in detail, calling it Zygaena Blochii nobis and attributing the name to Cuvier.|$|E
500|$|For {{most of the}} war, Poulenc was in Paris, giving {{recitals}} with Bernac, {{concentrating on}} French songs. Under Nazi rule {{he was in a}} vulnerable position, as a known homosexual (Destouches narrowly avoided arrest and deportation), but in his music he made many gestures of defiance of the Germans. He set to music verses by poets prominent in the French Resistance, including Aragon and Éluard. In Les <b>Animaux</b> modèles, premiered at the Opéra in 1942, he included the tune, repeated several times, of the anti-German song [...] "Vous n'aurez pas l'Alsace et la Lorraine". [...] He was a founder-member of the Front National (pour musique) which the Nazi authorities viewed with suspicion for its association with banned musicians such as Milhaud and Paul Hindemith. In 1943 he wrote a cantata for unaccompanied double choir intended for Belgium, Figure humaine, setting eight of Éluard's poems. The work, ending with [...] "Liberté", could not be given in France while the Germans were in control; its first performance was broadcast from a BBC studio in London in March 1945, and it was not sung in Paris until 1947. The music critic of The Times later wrote that the work [...] "is among the very finest choral works of our time and in itself removes Poulenc from the category of petit maître to which ignorance has generally been content to relegate him." ...|$|E
500|$|Poulenc's {{principal}} {{works for}} large orchestra comprise two ballets, a Sinfonietta and four keyboard concertos. The {{first of the}} ballets, Les biches, was first performed in 1924 and remains one of his best-known works. Nichols writes in Grove that the clear and tuneful score has no deep, or even shallow, symbolism, a fact [...] "accentuated by a tiny passage of mock-Wagnerian brass, complete with emotive minor 9ths". The first {{two of the four}} concertos are in Poulenc's light-hearted vein. The Concert champêtre for harpsichord and orchestra (1927–28), evokes the countryside seen from a Parisian point of view: Nichols comments that the fanfares in the last movement bring to mind the bugles in the barracks of Vincennes in the Paris suburbs. The Concerto for two pianos and orchestra (1932) is similarly a work intended purely to entertain. It draws on a variety of stylistic sources: the first movement ends in a manner reminiscent of Balinese gamelan, and the slow movement begins in a Mozartian style, which Poulenc gradually fills out with his own characteristic personal touches. The Organ Concerto (1938) is in a much more serious vein. Poulenc said that it was [...] "on the outskirts" [...] of his religious music, and there are passages that draw on the church music of Bach, though there are also interludes in breezy popular style. The second ballet score, Les <b>Animaux</b> modèles (1941), has never equalled the popularity of Les biches, though both Auric and Honegger praised the composer's harmonic flair and resourceful orchestration. Honegger wrote, [...] "The influences that have worked on him, Chabrier, Satie, Stravinsky, are now completely assimilated. Listening to his music you think– it's Poulenc." [...] The Sinfonietta (1947) is a reversion to Poulenc's pre-war frivolity. He came to feel, [...] "I dressed too young for my age... is a new version of Les biches but young girls [...] that are forty-eight years old– that's horrible!" [...] The Concerto for piano and orchestra (1949) initially caused some disappointment: many felt that it was not an advance on Poulenc's pre-war music, a view he came to share. The piece has been re-evaluated in more recent years, and in 1996 the writer Claire Delamarche rated it as the composer's finest concertante work.|$|E
