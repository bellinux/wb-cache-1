5|$|The {{buildings}} were bought for US$4.7 million in 1988 by real estate investor Samuel A. Rappaport. Rappaport, {{who made a}} fortune by buying, improving, and then selling run-down properties, announced in 1989 {{that he planned to}} turn the building into his own personal headquarters and add a glass-enclosed ballroom on its top. Rappaport also planned to have an apartment in one of the York Row houses. However, like many other Rappaport-owned buildings, they ended up being left vacant and neglected, becoming a target for vandals <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>homeless.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Wong created Wandering Home, an {{installation}} {{consisting of a}} mobile home conceptualised on city living <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>homeless,</b> which was shown at the Venice Biennale of Architecture. The small tin hut {{on the back of}} a tricycle is a comment on Hong Kong society, and the plight of people who sleep on the streets and who are forced to move on periodically by government officials. Costing HK$5,000 to make, the house is not exactly a practical solution to the homeless, but the concept was tried out on street sleepers in Sham Shui Po. In 2008, Wong created Tin Man No.11, an essay in space in the form of a metallic robot that transforms into a bed. He extended the concept by creating Famiglia Grande, a series of transformable cases. In 2009, Wong attended the Subvision Festival in Hamburg as a skyscraper.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} {{is located in}} the district of St Giles, a short distance to the east of the east end of Oxford Street. The area was once notorious for being one of the worst slums in London, known as the Rookery – a maze of ramshackle houses, alleys and courtyards inhabited by thousands of destitute people. It was famously depicted by William Hogarth in his 1751 print Gin Lane. Central Saint Giles stands on the site of St Giles Court, an office development originally erected in the 1950s for the Ministry of Supply and latterly used by the Ministry of Defence (MOD). It consisted of a series of linked brick blocks of six to eight storeys high, arranged in an S-shape around two inner courtyards to which there was no public access. The grim appearance of St Giles Court contributed to the area becoming a magnet for prostitutes <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>homeless.</b> The building was owned by Legal & General but was occupied by the MOD on a lease that was not due to expire until 2011. However, {{at the start of the}} 21st century the MOD began undertaking a process of reducing its London estate and discontinued the use of several buildings in the capital, including St Giles Court. It vacated the building in April 2005.|$|E

25|$|Despite the market, {{the park}} has {{suffered}} serious deterioration over the past 20 years due to crime, nearby prostitution {{and the proliferation of}} non-art street vendors. While the homeless move out for the Sunday market, they dominate the park {{for the rest of the}} week. The result has been graffiti, garbage, dog waste and playgrounds in poor conditions. It is common to see cushions, and chairs as well and drying clothes on the park’s statues. In fact, by Sunday, the smell can be strong enough that art vendors need to clean with detergent and pine cleaner before setting up. The Cuauhtémoc borough invested 5 million pesos for cleaning, repairs and the improvement of drainage and lighting, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>homeless</b> were expelled from the park in 2005, but area residents complain that the problems have returned.|$|E

25|$|The {{legality}} of freegan practices of reclaiming wasted food, space, or buildings {{varies depending on}} local laws around property, trespassing, and waste removal. In some places, like New York City, freegans dumpster dive publicly; in other locations, urban foraging is a secretive activity. In recent years, there have been arrests of people dumpster diving for political reasons in the United Kingdom, Belgium, and France, although in most locations charges have eventually been dropped. These actions {{could be seen as}} part of a broader criminalization of acts of survival—like sleeping in public places, sharing food without a permit, or recovering aluminum cans to re-sell—that has affected freegans as well as affiliated groups like Food Not Bombs <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>homeless.</b> Freegans report that stores have responded to waste recovery as well, including deliberately destroying products prior to disposing of them, locking dumpsters, or pouring bleach on food to make it inedible. In France, a new national law bans the practice of destroying food in this way.|$|E
25|$|John Ranard (1952-2008) {{began his}} social {{documentary}} photography in his {{depictions of the}} brutal and ironic world of boxing.

Ranard went on to photograph squatters <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>homeless</b> in New York City, and spent lengthy periods in Russia photographing perestroika and the poignant problem of HIV/AIDS in Russia. He gained access to Russian prisons and photographed the grim life of Russian prisoners. A good many of his Russian photographs appeared in Forty Pounds of Salt (Fly by Night Press, 1995), Full Life and The Fire Within (the last two published by Medecins Sans Frontieres (Holland) & AIDS Foundation East-West, 2001). Ranard was closely connected with Louisville, Kentucky throughout his career. In his portfolio On Every Corner he photographed the inside world of the black communities' store-front churches. The churches were faced with the problem of violence by black teenagers.|$|E
500|$|In the beginning, convicts, soldiers, {{governors}} and civil authorities attended the church; in the 21st century, regular patronage by, and programs for, governors, politicians, {{the legal community}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>homeless</b> create a similarly diverse mix. In 1900, such a congregation was described by the sixth rector as representing [...] "many types, many classes.

[...] The Place is owned by a rich family, that needs to be guarded against threats by foreigners, thieves of all varieties, Negroes, poachers, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>homeless.</b> Within the novel, Terhune notes the provisions of the [...] "Guest Law", which reflect a fear of [...] "the flotsam of the American polity".

[...] He refers to Esperanza's determination not to forget her working-class roots once she obtains her dream house, and to open her doors {{to those who are}} less fortunate.
