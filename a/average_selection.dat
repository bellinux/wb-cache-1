Consequently, the total selection pressure on an organism is the <b>average</b> <b>selection</b> across all environments weighted by the percentage time spent in that environment. Variable environment can therefore select for environmental robustness where organisms can function across a wide range of conditions with little change in phenotype or fitness (biology). Some organisms show adaptations to tolerate large changes in temperature, water availability, salinity or food availability. Plants, in particular, are unable to move when the environment changes and so show a range of mechanisms for achieving environmental robustness. Similarly, this can be seen in proteins as tolerance to a wide range of solvents, ion concentrations or temperatures.|$|E

40|$|As {{a nearly}} neutral {{mutation}} model, the house-of-cards model is studied in finite populations using computer simulations. The {{distribution of the}} mutant effect {{is assumed to be}} normal. The behavior is mainly determined by the product of the population size, N, and the standard deviation, σ, of the distribution of the mutant effect. If 4 Nσ is large compared to one, a few advantageous mutants are quickly fixed in early generations. Then most mutation becomes deleterious and very slow increase of the <b>average</b> <b>selection</b> coefficient follows. It takes very long for the population to reach the equilibrium state. Substitutions of alleles occur very infrequently in the later stage. If 4 Nσ is the order of one or less, the behavior is qualitatively {{similar to that of the}} strict neutral case. Gradual increase of the <b>average</b> <b>selection</b> coefficient occurs and in generations of several times the inverse of the mutation rate the population almost reaches the equilibrium state. Both advantageous and neutral (including slightly deleterious) mutations are fixed. Except in the early stage, an increase of the standard deviation of the distribution of the mutant effect decreases the average heterozygosity. The substitution rate is reduced as 4 Nσ is increased. Three tests of neutrality, one using the relationship between the average and the variance of heterozygosity, another using the relationship between the average heterozygosity and the average number of substitutions and Watterson's homozygosity test are applied to the consequences of the present model. It is found that deviation from the neutral expectation becomes apparent only when 4 Nσ is more than two. Also a simple approximation for the model is developed which works well when the mutation rate is very small...|$|E

When applied to the gnd gene coding for 6 -phosphogluconate dehydrogenase in a sample of seven natural isolates of Escherichia coli, the method indicates that the proportion of observed amino acid polymorphisms that are selectively neutral is unlikely to be greater than 49 % (upper 95 % confidence limit). On the other hand, the observations are also consistent with a model in which all of the observed amino acid substitutions are mildly deleterious with an <b>average</b> <b>selection</b> coefficient approximating 1. 6 X 10 (- 7).

40|$|A two-locus {{model of}} {{reversible}} mutations with compensatory fitness interactions is presented; single mutations {{are assumed to}} be deleterious but neutral in appropriate combinations. The expectation of the time of compensatory nucleotide substitutions is calculated analytically for the case of tight linkage between sites. It is shown that selection increases the substitution time dramatically when selection intensity Ns > 1, where N is the diploid population size and s the selection coefficient. Computer simulations demonstrate that recombination increases the substitution time, but the effect of recombination is small when selection is weak. The amount of linkage disequilibrium generated in the process of compensatory substitution is also investigated. It is shown that significant linkage disequilibrium is expected to be rare in natural populations. The model is applied to the mRNA secondary structure of the bicoid 3 ' untranslated region of Drosophila.

40|$|The {{fixation}} of {{a beneficial}} mutation represents {{the first step}} in adaptation, and the average effect of such mutations is therefore a fundamental property of evolving populations. It is nevertheless poorly characterized because the rarity of beneficial mutations makes it difficult to obtain reliable estimates of fitness. We obtained 68 genotypes each containing a single fixed beneficial mutation from experimental populations of Pseudomonas fluorescens, evolving in medium with serine as the sole carbon source and estimated the selective advantage of each by competition with the ancestor. The distribution of selection coefficients is modal and closely resembles the Weibull distribution. The <b>average</b> <b>selection</b> coefficient (2. 1) and beneficial mutation rate (3. 8 × 10 − 8) are high relative to previous studies, possibly because the ancestral population grows poorly in serine-limited medium. Our experiment suggests that the initial stages of adaptation to stressful environments will involve the substitution of mutations with large effect on fitness...|$|E

Subsequent mapping studies in sunflower show four of five of the positively selected genes identified by these methods mapped to domes-tication QTLs.

40|$|Extinction, recolonization, {{and local}} {{adaption}} {{are common in}} natural spatially structured populations. Understanding their effect upon genetic variation is important for systems such as genetically modified organism management or avoidance of drug resistance. Theoretical studies {{on the effect of}} extinction and recolonization upon genetic variance started appearing in the 1970 s, but the role of local adaption still has no good theoretical basis. Here we develop a model of a haploid species in a metapopulation in which a locally adapted beneficial allele is introduced. We study the effect of different spatial patterns of local adaption, and different metapopulation dynamics, upon the fixation probability of the beneficial allele. Controlling for the <b>average</b> <b>selection</b> pressure, we find that a small area of positive selection can significantly increase the global probability of fixation. However, local adaption becomes less important as extinction rate increases. Deme extinction and recolonization have a spatial smoothing effect that effectively reduces spatial variation in fitness...|$|E
40|$|The genetic {{variation}} {{present in a}} species depends on the interplay between mutation, population size, and natural selection. At mutation-(purifying) selection balance (MSB) in a large population, the standing genetic variance for a trait (VG) is predicted to be proportional to the mutational variance for the trait (VM); VM {{is proportional to the}} mutation rate for the trait. The ratio VM/VG predicts the <b>average</b> strength of <b>selection</b> (S) against a new mutation. Here we compare VM and VG for lifetime reproductive success (≈ fitness) and body volume in two species of self-fertilizing rhabditid nematodes, Caenorhabditis briggsae and C. elegans, which the evidence suggests have different mutation rates. Averaged over traits, species, and populations within species, the relationship between VG and VM is quite stable, consistent with the hypothesis that differences among groups in standing variance can be explained by differences in mutational input. The <b>average</b> (homozygous) <b>selection</b> coefficient inferred from VM/VG is a few percent, smaller than typical direct estimates from mutation accumulation (MA) experiments. With one exception, the variance present in a worldwide sample of these species is similar to the variance present within a sample from a single locale. These results are consistent with specieswide MSB and uniform purifying selection, but genetic draft (hitchhiking) is a plausible alternative possibility...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe semilinear {{parabolic}} {{system that}} describes {{the evolution of the}} gene frequencies in the diffusion approximation for migration and selection at a multiallelic locus without dominance is investigated. The population occupies a finite habitat of arbitrary dimensionality and shape (i. e., a bounded, open domain in Rd). The selection coefficients depend on position; the drift and diffusion coefficients may depend on position. The primary focus of this paper is the dependence of the evolution of the gene frequencies on λ, the strength of selection relative to that of migration. It is proved that if migration is sufficiently strong (i. e., λ is sufficiently small) and the migration operator is in divergence form, then the allele with the greatest spatially <b>averaged</b> <b>selection</b> coefficient is ultimately fixed. The stability of each vertex (i. e., an equilibrium with exactly one allele present) is completely specified. The stability of each edge equilibrium (i. e., one with exactly two alleles present) is fully described when either (i) migration is sufficiently weak (i. e., λ is sufficiently large) or (ii) the equilibrium has just appeared as λ increases. The existence of unexpected, complex phenomena is established: even if there are only three alleles and migration is homogeneous and isotropic (corresponding to the Laplacian), (i) as λ increases, arbitrarily many changes of stability of the edge equilibria and corresponding appearance of an internal equilibrium can occur and (ii) the conditions for protection or loss of an allele can both depend nonmonotonically on λ. Neither of these phenomena can occur in the diallelic case...|$|R
