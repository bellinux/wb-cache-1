2500|$|In {{order to}} assist in {{detecting}} leaks, an odorizer {{is added to the}} otherwise colorless and almost odorless gas used by consumers. The odor has been compared to the smell of rotten eggs, due to the added tert-Butylthiol (t-butyl mercaptan). Sometimes a related compound, thiophane, may be used in the mixture. Situations in which an odorant that is added to natural gas can be detected by <b>analytical</b> <b>instrumentation,</b> but cannot be properly detected by an observer with a normal sense of smell, have occurred in the natural gas industry. [...] This is caused by odor masking, when one odorant overpowers the sensation of another. As of 2011, the industry is conducting research on the causes of odor masking.|$|E

It is shown that such plasma allows minimization of plasma damage in comparison with standard oxygen containing CF 4 based plasmas and provides in situ sealing of the pores by deposition of fluorocarbon polymers in the film. We also demonstrate that the resulting surface is well suited for the nucleation and growth of atomic layer deposited WCN films.

40|$|Ultrafine {{particles}} {{are among the}} most toxic pollutants produced by industrial processes and diesel engines. Nevertheless, the lack of suitable process for their abatement in large scale units is limiting the introduction of new regulations to contain their emissions. Heterogeneous condensation, already used in <b>analytical</b> <b>instrumentations,</b> can be used to enlarge ultrafine particles allowing to use the existing cleaning systems within their actual operational limits. In this paper, experimental and modeling results on the heterogeneous condensation of water vapor on ultrafine particles produced by an ethylene-air flame are reported. The tests have been carried out in a lab-scale facility based on the use of a evaporating liquid film growth tube. Different experimental protocols have been proven and experimental tests have been carried out to estimate the effect of several process parameters, as liquid film temperature and contact time, on the efficiency of heterogeneous condensation. In addition, this paper reports a semi-empirical model that has been used to interpret the experimental data by means of considerations on mass and energy balances in the growth tube and on water nucleation and growing of condensing water on the ultrafine particles...|$|R
40|$|The Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Analytical Chemistry (LCAP) is {{involved}} in numerous projects and therefore has to use different <b>analytical</b> <b>instrumentations.</b> Separation techniques, such as chromatography or electrophoresis, remain the techniques of choice but need to be adapted in each specific challenge. To better develop, optimize and validate analytical methodologies, {{the use of the}} multivariate approach is of utmost interest. Statistical experimental design is a powerful tool to quantify the effect of one or more variables on a set of measured responses. It provides a methodological framework for changing operating parameters simultaneously by the help of experimental designs. These approaches involve the smallest possible number of useful experiments and provide maximum information. The relevant results obtained in pharmaceutical analysis compared to a univariate approach come from their ability to detect and quantify variable interactions and therefore considerably increase the system knowledge. On the other hand, with the increase of modern computerized analytical techniques, the information could be present as hidden structures in the huge amount of data. As a result, chemometric methods have been applied to extract information. For this purpose, principal component analysis (PCA) combined with other statistical techniques are now necessary to efficiently reduce and interpret complex data structure...|$|R
