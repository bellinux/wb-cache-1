5|$|In these applications, one forms a graph {{in which}} each vertex {{represents}} a matched pair of atoms, one from each of two molecules. Two vertices are connected by an edge if the matches that they represent <b>are</b> <b>compatible</b> <b>with</b> each other. Being compatible may mean, for instance, that the distances between the atoms within the two molecules are approximately equal, to within some given tolerance. A clique in this graph represents a set of matched pairs of atoms {{in which all the}} matches <b>are</b> <b>compatible</b> <b>with</b> each other. A special case of this method is the use of the modular product of graphs to reduce the problem of finding the maximum common induced subgraph of two graphs to the problem of finding a maximum clique in their product.|$|E

A trading card game, titled Fire Emblem 0 (Cipher), based on the series is also available in Japan, featuring character artwork by old and new artists.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} this is the {{psychology}} of perception. Scientists working in this field have discovered general principles of the perception of forms. A law of the psychology of forms says that objects that move in the same direction are perceived as related to each other. This law describes a relation between visual input and mental perceptual states. However, it does not suggest anything about the nature of perceptual states. The laws discovered by psychology <b>are</b> <b>compatible</b> <b>with</b> all the answers to the mind–body problem already described.|$|E

A dock holds the iPad upright at an angle, and has a dock connector and audio line out port. Each generation of iPad requires a corresponding dock. A dock that included a physical keyboard was only supported for the original iPad, but all generations <b>are</b> <b>compatible</b> <b>with</b> Bluetooth keyboards that also work with Macs and PCs. The iPad can be charged by a standalone power adapter ("wall charger") also used for iPods and iPhones, and a 10 W charger is included with the iPad.|$|E

5|$|Saccharolipids {{describe}} {{compounds in}} which fatty acids are linked {{directly to a}} sugar backbone, forming structures that <b>are</b> <b>compatible</b> <b>with</b> membrane bilayers. In the saccharolipids, a monosaccharide substitutes for the glycerol backbone present in glycerolipids and glycerophospholipids. The most familiar saccharolipids are the acylated glucosamine precursors of the LipidA component of the lipopolysaccharides in Gram-negative bacteria. Typical lipidA molecules are disaccharides of glucosamine, which are derivatized {{with as many as}} seven fatty-acyl chains. The minimal lipopolysaccharide required for growth in E. coli is Kdo2-Lipid A, a hexa-acylated disaccharide of glucosamine that is glycosylated with two 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) residues.|$|E
5|$|Section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998 is a {{provision}} of the Human Rights Act 1998 that enables the Act to take effect in the United Kingdom. The section requires courts to interpret both primary and subordinate legislation so that their provisions <b>are</b> <b>compatible</b> <b>with</b> the articles of the European Convention of Human Rights, which {{are also part of}} the Human Rights Act 1998. This interpretation goes far beyond normal statutory interpretation, and includes past and future legislation, therefore preventing the Human Rights act from being impliedly repealed by subsequent contradictory legislation.|$|E

5|$|The {{fossil record}} (especially the sister species, Pinguinus alfrednewtoni) and {{molecular}} evidence {{show that the}} three closely related genera diverged soon after their common ancestor, a bird probably similar to a stout Xantus's murrelet, had spread to the coasts of the Atlantic. Apparently, by that time, the murres, or Atlantic guillemots, already had split from the other Atlantic alcids. Razorbill-like birds were common in the Atlantic during the Pliocene, but {{the evolution of the}} little auk is sparsely documented. The molecular data <b>are</b> <b>compatible</b> <b>with</b> either possibility, but the weight of evidence suggests placing the great auk in a distinct genus. Some ornithologists still believe it is more appropriate to retain the species in the genus Alca. It is the only recorded British bird made extinct in historic times.|$|E
