5|$|From stanzas 22 to 24, {{more details}} are given by Odin about Valhalla: the holy {{doors of the}} ancient gate Valgrind stand before Valhalla, Valhalla has five hundred and forty doors that eight hundred men can exit from at once (from which the einherjar will flow forth to engage the wolf Fenrir at Ragnarök). Within Valhalla exists Thor's hall Bilskirnir, and within it exist five hundred and forty rooms, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> halls within Valhalla, Odin states that he thinks his son's may be greatest. In stanzas 25 through 26, Odin states that the goat Heiðrún and the hart Eikþyrnir stand on top of Valhalla and graze on the {{branches}} of the tree Læraðr. Heiðrún produces vats of mead that liquor cannot be compared to, and from Eikþyrnir's antlers drip liquid into the spring Hvergelmir from which flows forth all waters.|$|E
5|$|He {{participated in}} attacks {{alongside}} Druze warriors against French positions and {{offices in the}} Hauran, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> rebel commanders from Damascus, al-Bakri was the most respected among the Druze. As fighting between rebels and French forces in the Ghouta escalated, al-Bakri devised an operation to wrest control of Damascus from the French by capturing the citadel and the Azm Palace. The former housed the city's French garrison, while the latter housed the French Mandate High Commissioner Maurice Sarrail. Al-Bakri requested reinforcements from al-Atrash and his men, but they were occupied by fighting in the Hauran and notified al-Bakri that any help would be delayed. Al-Bakri decided to move ahead nonetheless. On 17 October, he assembled al-Kharrat's group and another group of rebels from al-Midan and Jaramana inside Damascus. The next day al-Kharrat launched the operation.|$|E

All the imagery we wanted—and I had a few set ideas, for instance the cat {{and the idea of}} Metropolis. I definitely wanted to have that influence, that look on all the men—the workers, diligently, methodically working away.|$|E

Dartford's prowess is borne out by a 1723 journal entry recorded by the prominent Tory politician Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford: At Dartford upon the Heath (i.e., Dartford Brent) as we came out of the town, the men of Tonbridge and the Dartford men were warmly engaged at the sport of cricket, which of all the people of England the Kentish folk are the most renowned for, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> Kentish men, the men of Dartford lay claim to the greatest excellence.|$|E

At that point he is redeemed by the sacrifice of Aslan's life and he joins the fight against the White Witch. Lucy is the youngest of the four Pevensie siblings.

25|$|The {{separate}} celebrations then {{involved the}} building of many altars in one church and {{the reduction of the}} ritual to the simplest possible form. The deacon and subdeacon were in this case dispensed with; the celebrant took their part as well as his own. One server took the part of the choir <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> other ministers, everything was said instead of being sung, the incense and kiss of peace were omitted. So we have the well-known rite of low Mass (missa privata). This then reacted on high Mass (missa solemnis), so that at high Mass too the celebrant himself recites everything, even though it be sung by the deacon, subdeacon, or choir.|$|E
25|$|From the 15th century, {{northern}} Transnistria (current {{districts of}} Camenca and Rîbniţa) {{were part of}} the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and later to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569–1793) which encouraged the migration of peasants into the territory from the neighbouring populated areas (from north and from west). Prince of Moldavia George Ducas (1665–66, 1668–72, 1678–84) built a court at Țicanova on the east bank of the Dniester, and one at Nimirov on the Southern Bug, last mentioned in Moldavian hands in 1765. The localities Dubăsari, Rașcov, Vasilcău, as well as four other currently in Ukraine are mentioned in 17th–18th centuries as fairs for the Dniester-Bug region. In 1769, a document dated at Bender mentions the then title of the Mitropolitan of Moldavia as Mitropolitan of Proilavia, of Tamarova, of Hotin, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> borders of the Danube, of the Dniester, and the Han's Ukraine, the latter being a common reference to the then sparsely populated Dniester–Southern Bug–Dniepr area.|$|E

25|$|From the {{information}} requested by his predecessor, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> scenarios that were examined by the Minister, he agreed in August 1968 to {{the closure of the}} Lewes to Uckfield section of line. But the resultant row over the severing of what was a very important rail link began. Considerable opposition from the users centred, in the first instance, around the inadequate replacement bus service – which had Ministerial approval. The issue was resolved by the Transport Commissioners who, on examination of all the complaints from the users and undertaking the journey themselves, upheld the users' complaints. However concerns over the state of the bridge over Cliffe High Street remained and finally the BR Chief Civil Engineer declared the bridge unsafe. This meant the cessation of rail services along this section of line, with a replacement bus service in place. All of these actions resulted in the delaying of the closure from January 1969 to May 1969.|$|E

From 1729, under the management of Jonathan Tyers, property developer, impresario, patron of the arts, the gardens grew into an extraordinary business, a cradle of modern painting and architecture, and... music....
