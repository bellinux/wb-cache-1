60|$|Once Marguerite had put <b>all</b> <b>her</b> pride, <b>all</b> <b>her</b> dignity by, {{and asked}} citizen Chauvelin for news of her husband.|$|R
60|$|Marguerite had need of <b>all</b> <b>her</b> energy, <b>all</b> <b>her</b> steadfastness of purpose, {{to keep up}} {{her courage}} through this weary midnight waiting.|$|R
6000|$|She {{kissed him}} on the lips, and <b>all</b> <b>her</b> heart and <b>all</b> <b>her</b> youth were in that kiss. Then, gently enough, she pushed him from her, saying: ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was strange}} that through <b>all</b> <b>her</b> troubles, <b>all</b> <b>her</b> anxiety for Armand, she was mostly {{conscious}} {{at the present}} moment of a keen and bitter heartache.|$|R
6000|$|Running to him, <b>all</b> <b>her</b> repugnance gone, <b>all</b> <b>her</b> {{tenderness}} awake, {{she put her}} arm {{about his}} shoulders. [...] "Oh, Mart, did he hurt you? Are you worse?" ...|$|R
60|$|Farewell to Beatrice! The {{light went}} out of the sky and {{darkness}} gathered on the weltering sea. Farewell to Beatrice, and <b>all</b> <b>her</b> love and <b>all</b> <b>her</b> sin.|$|R

60|$|And then, how {{she hated}} him! Cheated, foiled, betrayed, forced {{to love him}} or to hate him: never able to be at peace near him nor away from him: poor Lottie, no wonder she was as a mad woman. She was {{strictly}} as a woman demented, {{after the birth of}} her second child. For <b>all</b> <b>her</b> instinct, <b>all</b> <b>her</b> impulse, <b>all</b> <b>her</b> desire, and above <b>all,</b> <b>all</b> <b>her</b> will, was to possess her man in very fulness once: just once: and once and for all. Once, just once: and it would be once and for all.|$|R
60|$|Then Martha sat {{upon the}} lid and pressed it down with <b>all</b> <b>her</b> weight. To her great delight the lock caught, and, {{springing}} down, she exerted <b>all</b> <b>her</b> strength and turned the key.|$|R

60|$|The joy which Miss Darcy {{expressed}} on receiving similar information, was as sincere as her brother's {{in sending}} it. Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain <b>all</b> <b>her</b> delight, and <b>all</b> <b>her</b> earnest desire of being loved by her sister.|$|R
60|$|She now {{resolved}} to keep Harriet {{no longer in}} the dark. She had reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold, and it was desirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of her other complaint before the gentleman's return. She went to Mrs. Goddard's accordingly the very next day, to undergo the necessary penance of communication; and a severe one it was.--She had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously feeding--to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred--and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis-judging in <b>all</b> <b>her</b> ideas on one subject, <b>all</b> <b>her</b> observations, <b>all</b> <b>her</b> convictions, <b>all</b> <b>her</b> prophecies for the last six weeks.|$|R

6000|$|Mrs. Yorke often {{complained that}} her {{children}} were mutinous. It was strange that with <b>all</b> <b>her</b> strictness, with <b>all</b> <b>her</b> [...] "strong-mindedness," [...] she could gain no command over them.

6000|$|... "Armand, Armand, go to him!" [...] she cried; and <b>all</b> <b>her</b> self-control, <b>all</b> <b>her</b> {{enforced}} calm, {{vanished in}} an outburst of wild, agonising passion. [...] "Let {{me get to}} him, Armand! This is the end; get me to him, {{in the name of}} God!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{the little}} darling," [...] cried Miss Rosetta, <b>all</b> <b>her</b> old maidishness and oddity falling {{away from her}} like a garment, and <b>all</b> <b>her</b> innate and denied {{motherhood}} shining out in her face like a transforming illumination.

60|$|She spent <b>all</b> <b>her</b> {{strength}} in <b>her</b> embrace, <b>all</b> <b>her</b> soul in {{the passion of}} her farewell kiss. Then she stood alone, tottering, sinking.

60|$|Emma was gratified, {{and would}} soon have shewn no want of words, if {{the sound of}} Mrs. Elton's voice from the sitting-room had not checked her, and made it {{expedient}} to compress <b>all</b> <b>her</b> friendly and <b>all</b> <b>her</b> congratulatory sensations into a very, very earnest shake of the hand.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>all</b> <b>her</b> vanity {{and greed}} welled {{up in the}} Beast of Shadows, for whosoever her dam may be, and <b>all</b> <b>her</b> lineage of {{solitude}} and strangeness, she has more greed than a wolf, more vanity than a vixen. She thrust her long lean head into the Cap.|$|R
