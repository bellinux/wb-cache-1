In a 1994 Boston Globe article, Nielsen explained, [...] "I did learn very early that when I would mention my uncle, people {{would look at me}} as if I were the biggest liar in the world. Then I would take them home and show them 8-by-10 glossies, and things changed quite drastically. So I began to think that maybe this acting business was not a bad idea, much as I was very shy about it and certainly without courage regarding it. My uncle died not too long <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in a position to know him. I regret that I had not a chance to know him better." ...|$|E

After initially denying having seen Bakshi's film, Jackson admitted to having first encountered The Lord of the Rings via Bakshi's film, stating that the film was a [...] "brave and ambitious attempt." [...] In another interview, Jackson stated that he [...] "enjoyed [...] {{and wanted to know}} more." [...] Bakshi is quoted as saying [...] "Peter Jackson did say that the first film inspired him to go on and do the series, but that happened <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> bitching and moaning to a lot of interviewers that he said at the beginning that he never saw the movie. I thought that was kind of fucked up." [...] On the audio commentary for the DVD release of , Jackson acknowledges one shot, a low angle of a hobbit at Bilbo's birthday party shouting [...] "Proudfeet!", as an intentional homage to Bakshi's film.|$|E

[...] "My life {{in the outside world}} began <b>after</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> 40," [...] she said in a 1979 interview with The Philadelphia Inquirer.. In another interview that year, she said that she was not very interested in politics at the time; though she ran for city council in 1947 she only did so when mayoral candidate Richardson Dilworth assured her she would lose. [...] Democratic ward leaders asked her to run for City Council that year because, according to Dallas, [...] "they needed a woman and a Protestant, and they got two for one in me." [...] Dallas was one of two women the Democrats nominated that year. She was nominated in the 6th district which sent four members to City Council under the 1919 city charter. Her first campaign was unsuccessful; in those days, Republicans dominated the city's politics and in 1947 all four of their candidates for councilman in the 6th district were elected. Dallas placed sixth, second among the four Democrats nominated.|$|E

[...] "In my sophomore year I decided to switch to math. I wasn't prepared for it. I had forgotten my high school algebra and trig, and I had to spend my sophomore year taking those courses over again. <b>After</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> accepted to Lewis & Clark, I made an appointment {{to talk with the}} math department chair, Elvy Fredrickson. That was in June 1964. I asked Elvy if she would let me squeeze four years of math into my junior and senior years at Lewis & Clark. To imagine her thoughts, {{you have to remember that}} I had not even taken a course in freshman calculus. I didn't then know what Elvy was thinking. I only knew what she said and what she did. She went to a bookshelf in her office in the old math building, scanned the titles, took down a calculus text, handed it to me, and said, 'Study this book during the summer. The week before classes start in the fall, I will give you a test. If you pass, I will let you take your sophomore and junior mathematics courses concurrently. By the time you reach your senior year, you will be on track.' [...] Years later, Elvy told me that she had no idea I would actually do it. But, I had no idea that she had no ideaand so I took her up on her offer. I read the calculus book, passed the test, and started taking third-semester calculus and linear algebra in the fall of 1964." ...|$|E
