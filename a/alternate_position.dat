5000|$|Extending {{the slide}} from one {{position}} {{to the next}} lowers the pitch by one semitone. Thus, each note in the harmonic series can be lowered by an interval of up to a tritone. The lowest note of the standard instrument is therefore an E - a tritone below B. Most experienced trombonists can play lower [...] "falset" [...] notes and much lower pedal notes (first partials or fundamentals, which have a peculiar metallic rumbling sound). Slide positions are subject to adjustment, compensating for imperfections in the tuning of different harmonics. The fifth partial is rather flat on most trombones and usually requires a minute shortening of the slide position to compensate; other small adjustments are also normally required throughout the range. Trombonists make frequent use of <b>alternate</b> <b>positions</b> to minimize slide movement in rapid passages; for instance, B3 may be played in first or fifth <b>position.</b> <b>Alternate</b> <b>positions</b> are also needed to allow a player to produce a glissando to or from a higher note on the same partial.|$|R

50|$|In {{connection}} with the Furstenberg-Sárközy theorem on sequences of numbers with no square difference, Imre Z.

When applied to the base , Ruzsa's construction generates the Moser-de Bruijn sequence multiplied by two, a set that is again square-difference-free. However,this set is too sparse to provide nontrivial lower bounds for the Furstenberg-Sárközy theorem.|$|R
