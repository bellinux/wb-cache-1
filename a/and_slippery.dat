5|$|Highway21 {{is often}} subject to {{closures}} {{at various points}} as it lies on the lee shore of Lake Huron. Lake effect snow squalls frequently subject motorists to poor visibility <b>and</b> <b>slippery</b> conditions, leading to whiteout conditions. Because of this, the Ontario Provincial Police claim that the road is the most often closed in the province.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{were created}} in 2001 to realign {{portions}} of the Columbia Park jogging path that were in lower areas or overlapped by sprinklers, to prevent flooded <b>and</b> <b>slippery</b> paths. The city added decomposed granite as part of fixing the problem, by draining water off the new raised sections.|$|E
5|$|Many {{plants have}} {{external}} structural defenses that discourage herbivory. Depending on the herbivore’s physical characteristics (i.e. size and defensive armor), plant structural defenses on stems and leaves can deter, injure, or kill the grazer. Some defensive compounds are produced internally but are released onto the plant’s surface; for example, resins, lignins, silica, and wax cover the epidermis of terrestrial plants and alter {{the texture of}} the plant tissue. The leaves of holly plants, for instance, are very smooth <b>and</b> <b>slippery</b> making feeding difficult. Some plants produce gummosis or sap that traps insects.|$|E

5|$|The final was {{postponed}} from its scheduled start on Monday at 4p.m. until Thursday, 19 July, at 3:30p.m. because of rain. On Thursday {{it was still}} showery, causing the final to be further delayed by an hour. It began on a dead <b>and</b> <b>slippery</b> court in front of about 200 spectators. There was a temporary three-plank stand {{on one side of}} the court offering seating to about thirty people. Marshall won the toss, elected to serve first and was immediately broken by Gore. After the first set was won by Gore, it started to rain for a quarter of an hour; this further softened the ground and affected the quality of play. The final lasted 48 minutes, and Spencer Gore won the inaugural championship against William Marshall in three straight sets of 15, 13, and 20 minutes respectively. En route to the title Gore had won 15 sets and lost two and won 99 games for the loss of 46. Gore, the volley specialist, had beaten the baseline player, at a time when volleying was considered by some to be unsporting. Some tried to outlaw the volley and a discussion on its merits took place in The Field for weeks after the tournament.|$|E
5|$|After the Sunday rest day, Australia resumed with a lead of 478 {{runs and}} six wickets in hand. The morning was punctuated by three rain stoppages, which {{increased}} England's chances of saving the game. Just ten {{minutes after the}} start of the day's play, heavy rain intervened. The weather cleared and Miller and Brown moved to lunch on 63 and 32 respectively, having advanced Australia to 409/4. Miller was given a life before lunch when he hit a ball high into the air; Dollery stood right under it and had ample time to prepare, but dropped the catch. In 88 minutes of play, Australia added a further 66 runs. During this time, the third new ball became available, but England opted not to use it immediately, as the wet <b>and</b> <b>slippery</b> ground had made it hard for the bowlers to grip the ball or run up to the crease with confidence; the hosts instead waited for drier conditions so they could exercise more control over the ball. However, after a period of using his slower bowlers, Yardley opted to take the new ball, and Miller hit three boundaries to pass 50, and both batsmen lifted their rate of scoring. It appeared that aside from the need to score quickly in preparation for the declaration, both players found the new ball easier to see than its muddied predecessor. Miller hooked Coxon repeatedly, and drove Bedser for many runs. Bradman was expected to declare just before lunch so he could attack the English openers for a short period before the adjournment, but a shower at this time deterred him from doing so, as his bowlers would have struggled to grip the ball; Lindwall had also been injured on a slippery surface in earlier times.|$|E
5|$|The depots and airbases {{depended}} on an efficient road network, so the engineers gave this a high priority. A major {{effort was made}} to bring the roads up to all-weather standard before onset of the 1942 wet season. New roads were also built. One of the first was the By Pass Road, which was designed to divert traffic from the main road, which ran around the south eastern end of Jackson Drome, and was therefore an operational hazard. The By Pass Road ran between Jackson and Wards Dromes, and was later extended to Berry, Schwimmer and Durand Dromes. The opening of the new wharf at Tatana Island in October caused a sudden jump in road traffic, so a new Barune Road was opened in November that provided a loop to Jackson and Wards Dromes. Fortunately, the local red shale contained clay and rock fragments, and when laid on a prepared subgrade and watered, either by sprinklers or rain, became hard like concrete. This could take motor vehicle traffic, although it became dusty when dry <b>and</b> <b>slippery</b> when wet. Surfacing material was obtained from the Nine Mile Quarry. Wood was found to be unsuitable for culverts, as it was quickly destroyed by the action of climate and insects. Oil drums were found to be superior, but they rusted, and using them for culverts depleted the drum supply.|$|E

5|$|While {{the rain}} had stopped come race time, the track was still wet <b>and</b> <b>slippery</b> and all drivers opted to start on {{intermediate}} tyres. Hamilton got away better at the start, entering the first corner alongside pole-sitter Rosberg and, by forcing the German wide, took the lead exiting turn one. Getting off track saw Rosberg lose additional positions, running fifth behind Hamilton, Kvyat, Ricciardo and Pérez. Further back, a collision involved Alonso, Massa, the two Sauber cars of Ericsson and Nasr as well as Bottas, who made a pit stop after the first lap, as did Nasr, who was the first to fit slick tyres, as the track was starting to dry. Will Stevens was touched from behind by teammate Alexander Rossi, breaking his rear wing and forcing him to retire. Having started {{from the back of the}} grid, Carlos Sainz profited from the incidents and was up to tenth by the end of the first lap. While Rosberg soon took back fourth from Pérez, Hamilton in front came under pressure from Kvyat, with the Red Bull drivers running fast in the damp conditions. With Kvyat just half a second behind the championship leader, a virtual safety car period was declared on lap five to clear the debris from the first corner incident. On lap 7, Valtteri Bottas retired with a damper failure caused by the turn one contact. When the virtual safety car ended on lap 8, Rosberg made an immediate move on Ricciardo to move into third, overtaking Kvyat for second on the same lap. Romain Grosjean became another victim of the accident on lap one, when he came into the pit lane for a second time on lap 12 and retired. By the same time, Sebastian Vettel had moved up into sixth place from thirteenth on the grid. Up front, Kvyat went wide while trying to overtake Rosberg, allowing teammate Ricciardo through into third; Ricciardo in turn made a successful manoeuvre on Rosberg to move up into second.|$|E

25|$|On a wet, slick, <b>and</b> <b>slippery</b> field, the Steelers {{dominated}} the Oilers by forcing 9 turnovers and only allowing 5 points. Pittsburgh took the early lead by driving 57 yards to score on running back Franco Harris' 7-yard touchdown run. Then, linebacker Jack Ham recovered a fumble at the Houston 17-yard line, {{which led to}} running back Rocky Bleier's 15-yard rushing touchdown.|$|E
25|$|The Pennsylvanian System is {{represented}} by the Amsden Formation and the Tensleep Sandstone. Cliffs of the Tensleep Sandstone can be seen along the Gros Ventre River at the east edge of the park. The Amsden, below the Tensleep, consists of red and green shale, sandstone, and thin limestone.

25|$|Beginning at mile 50.7 of the Skyline Drive {{near the}} Byrd Visitor Center, Dark Hollow Falls Trail leads {{downhill}} beside Hogcamp Branch to Dark Hollow Falls, a 70-foot cascade. The {{distance from the}} trailhead {{to the base of}} the falls is 0.7 mile, although the trail continues beyond that point, crossing the creek and connecting with the Rose River fire road. Various fauna can be viewed along the trail, including occasional sightings of black bear and timber rattlesnake. While the trail is relatively short, parts of it are steep and may prove challenging to some visitors. There is no view from the brink of the falls, <b>and</b> <b>slippery</b> rocks make it inadvisable to leave the trail.|$|E
25|$|The funerary monuments {{are located}} on a rocky range of seven hillocks. The site {{is on the left}} bank of the Tungabhadra River. It is covered with thorny bushes <b>and</b> <b>slippery</b> {{scattered}} boulders. The climb to reach the site is difficult as there are no regular paths or roads, except for a goat track. In addition, a rivulet has to be crossed. A perennial source of water has been found {{in the form of a}} lake and an old quarry site discovered nearby was probably the source for building materials of the type found in Hire Benakal monuments. Hire Benakal village is approachable from the towns of Gangavathi, Hospet and Koppal by the state highway. The nearest railway station to the site is Hospet.|$|E
25|$|Cruach Ardrain {{currently}} has one Munro “Top” located on its slopes, the 959 metre Stob Garbh (Rough Peak) situated 1km {{away on the}} northern ridge. Stob Garbh {{lives up to its}} name by being rocky and needs care when being traversed. It can be by-passed on the west side but the path is steep <b>and</b> <b>slippery</b> and it is best to stick to the path over the crest. The original 1891 edition of Munro's Tables lists another Top at an intermediate point on the ridge, Stob Garbh South East Top at 925m. This Top was deleted in the 1921 edition. The north west ridge has two intermediate summits, Meall Dhamh (814 metres) and Grey Heights (686 metres), before dropping steeply to Glen Falloch through a conifer plantation.|$|E
