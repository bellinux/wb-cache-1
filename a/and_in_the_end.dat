5|$|After {{capturing}} Fort Duperre, the commandos received {{reports that}} a force of some 2,000 Zouaves were moving up to recapture the position. The French attack did not eventuate, however, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> the commandos marched {{all the way to}} Maison Blanche. Having only been issued with rations for a day, they had to rely on fruit and bread that they obtained by bartering with the locals on the way.

5|$|After {{the fall}} of Atlanta in September 1864, President Davis {{considered}} replacing John Bell Hood {{in command of the}} Army of Tennessee and he asked Robert E. Lee to find out if Beauregard would be interested. Beauregard was indeed interested, but it is unclear whether Davis seriously considered the appointment, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> decided to retain Hood. Davis met with Beauregard in Augusta, Georgia, on October 2 and offered him command of the newly created Department of the West, responsible for the five Southern states from Georgia to the Mississippi River, with the armies of Hood and Richard Taylor under his ostensible command. However, it was a thankless job that was limited to logistical and advisory responsibilities, without true operational control of the armies unless he should join them in person during an emergency. Nevertheless, anxious to return to the field, he accepted the assignment.|$|E

5|$|Following Nationals, Liukin {{was named}} to the American team for the World Championships in Stuttgart, Germany, where she competed {{all-around}} in the team qualifying round and on bars and beam in the finals. Liukin's score for her bars routine in team finals was a 16.375, the highest score of the day <b>and,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> the entire World Championships. However, {{at the end of her}} beam routine, her foot slipped while she was setting up her dismount, prompting her to change her usual skill, a two and a half twisting salto, to a simple back tuck. While she lost credit for her dismount, she also avoided a deduction for a fall, and earned a 15.175. The team recovered from this and other mistakes to finish first overall with 184.400, nearly a point ahead of the silver-medal Chinese.|$|E

5|$|Hughes, in {{his speech}} at the opening session of the conference on November 12, 1921, made the American proposal—the U.S would {{decommission}} or not build 30 warships if Great Britain did the same for 19 vessels, and Japan 17 ships. The secretary was generally successful, and agreements were reached on this and other points, including settlements to disputes over islands in the Pacific, and limitations {{on the use of}} poison gas. The naval agreement was limited to battleships and to some extent aircraft carriers, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> did not prevent rearmament. Nevertheless, Harding and Hughes were widely applauded in the press for their work. Harding had appointed Senator Lodge and the Senate Minority Leader, Alabama's Oscar Underwood, to the U.S. delegation; they helped ensure that the treaties made it through the Senate mostly unscathed, though that body added reservations to some of the treaties.|$|E

5|$|The {{food supply}} of the country {{depended}} on cereals produced in southern Russia, while the Finns had specialized in milk and butter production. The cessation of the cereal imports from disintegrating Russia led to food shortages in Finland. The Senate responded by introducing rationing and price controls. The farmers opposed the state control; a black market with sharply rising food prices formed and export to free market of the Petrograd area increased. Food supply, prices, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> the fear of starvation became emotional political issues between farmers and industrial workers, in particular the unemployed ones. The common people, their fears exploited by the politicians and the political media, took to the streets.
