5|$|In September 1894, C. T. R. Wilson was {{employed}} at the observatory {{for a couple}} of weeks as temporary relief for one of the permanent staff. During this period, he witnessed a Brocken spectre and glory, caused by the sun casting <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> on a cloud below the observer. He subsequently tried to reproduce these phenomena in the laboratory, resulting in his invention of the cloud chamber, used to detect ionising radiation.|$|E
5|$|In this manner, the Emperor's modern role {{is often}} {{compared}} {{to those of the}} Shogunate period and much of Japan's history, whereby the Emperor held great symbolic authority but had little political power; which is often held by others nominally appointed by the Emperor himself. Today, a legacy has somewhat continued for a retired Prime Minister who still wields considerable power, to be called <b>a</b> <b>Shadow</b> Shogun (闇将軍).|$|E

40|$|Coalminers with "A" shadows (the {{first stage}} of {{progressive}} massive fibrosis (PMF)) have a similar standardised mortality ratio (SMR) to those without PMF, and those with <b>A</b> <b>shadows</b> have <b>a</b> much higher specific mortality from pneumoconiosis. It is therefore argued that either <b>A</b> <b>shadows</b> confer immunity against some other disease(s) or that those developing <b>A</b> <b>shadows</b> are {{selected on the basis}} of increased life expectancy. These two hypotheses were investigated and as the selection hypothesis appeared promising further studies were made to discover which specific cause of death might be associated with this selection. This, surprisingly, appeared to be ischaemic heart disease...|$|R

5|$|Many {{bivalves}} have no eyes, but a {{few members}} of the Arcoidea, Limopsoidea, Mytiloidea, Anomioidea, Ostreoidea, and Limoidea have simple eyes on the margin of the mantle.

All bivalves have light-sensitive cells that can detect <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> falling over the animal.|$|E
5|$|On 26 July 2006, the Hubble Space Telescope {{captured}} a rare transit made by Ariel on Uranus, which cast <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> {{that could be}} seen on the Uranian cloud tops. Such events are rare and only occur around equinoxes, as the moon's orbital plane about Uranus is tilted 98° to Uranus's orbital plane about the Sun. Another transit, in 2008, was recorded by the European Southern Observatory.|$|E

5|$|As with Seasons, the Triforce {{calls out}} to Link. Link is transported to a forest {{in the land of}} Labrynna, where he hears screaming.

The woman is Princess Zelda's nurse, Impa, who asks Link to help her find a singer in the forest. Continuing through the forest, the two find Nayru, a young woman with blue hair singing on a tree stump, {{surrounded}} by forest creatures. <b>A</b> <b>shadow</b> emerges from Impa and reveals itself as Veran, Sorceress of Shadows.

5|$|Evidently {{the great}} mass of laboring men failed to {{comprehend}} the situation. Too much then, as now, capital was their enemy, not their friend.

They did not see that capital could not pay wages, buy raw material and manufacture goods unless it could sell its products and get returns.
