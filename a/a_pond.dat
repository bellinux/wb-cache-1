5|$|<b>A</b> <b>pond</b> {{is a body}} of {{standing}} water, either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a lake. A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including water gardens designed for aesthetic ornamentation, fish ponds designed for commercial fish breeding, and solar ponds designed to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via current speed. While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents. These features distinguish <b>a</b> <b>pond</b> from many other aquatic terrain features, such as stream pools and tide pools.|$|E

5|$|Among non-living things, snowflakes have {{striking}} sixfold symmetry: each flake's structure {{forming a}} record of the varying conditions during its crystallisation, with nearly the same pattern of growth on each of its six arms. Crystals in general have a variety of symmetries and crystal habits; they can be cubic or octahedral, but true crystals cannot have fivefold symmetry (unlike quasicrystals). Rotational symmetry is found at different scales among non-living things including the crown-shaped splash pattern formed when a drop falls into <b>a</b> <b>pond,</b> and both the spheroidal shape and rings of a planet like Saturn.|$|E
5|$|Food webs {{are often}} limited {{relative}} to the real world. Complete empirical measurements are generally restricted to a specific habitat, such as a cave or <b>a</b> <b>pond,</b> and principles gleaned from food web microcosm studies are extrapolated to larger systems. Feeding relations require extensive investigations into the gut contents of organisms, which {{can be difficult to}} decipher, or stable isotopes can be used to trace the flow of nutrient diets and energy through a food web. Despite these limitations, food webs remain a valuable tool in understanding community ecosystems.|$|E

5|$|Though {{often used}} interchangeably, in biology these words have {{different}} meanings.

But if the pond contained a total of 120 fish from three different species, it would be said to contain three fishes. The distinction is similar to that between people and peoples.|$|E

40|$|In {{lowland rice}} production, water-saving {{irrigation}} technologies have been developed, {{but it has}} rarely been considered {{that the absence of}} <b>a</b> <b>ponded</b> water layer could change the field's microclimate due to the different thermal characteristics of water compared to air. At a site in the Senegal River valley, canopy and soil temperature as well as temperature at meristem level and relative humidity inside the canopy were observed in the presence and absence of <b>a</b> <b>ponded</b> water layer in an irrigated rice field. Gas-exchange measurements were conducted at different development stages of three varieties (IR 4630, IR 64, and Sahel 108) sown in bi-monthly intervals and the effects of climatic and microclimatic parameters on stomatal conductance, assimilation rate, and intrinsic water use efficiency were investigated. Minimum soil (Tsmin) and meristem temperature (TMmin) were usually lower in the absence of <b>a</b> <b>ponded</b> water layer. Stomatal conductance depended mainly on Tsmin, TMmin, and minimum relative humidity inside the canopy. Assimilation rate was positively correlated with solar radiation, Tsmin and TMmin, but depended mainly on stomatal conductance. Without standing water, stomatal conductance was significantly lower, but reductions could be explained with lower Tsmin and/or TMmin. Nevertheless, Tsmin and/or TMmin were the major determinants of stomatal conductance and assimilation rate, which suggests a pivotal role of root zone temperature on plant growth probably via water uptake and, thus, overall plant water status. Varietal differences were found, with assimilation rate in IR 4630 and Sahel 108 having been less affected by low temperature than in IR 64. When water-saving irrigation measures are applied in irrigated rice, the negative effects of lower soil and meristem temperature in the absence of <b>a</b> <b>ponded</b> water layer in the field on the productivity of rice need to be considered. In regions where night temperatures below 20 °C occur, varieties should be used that are less temperature-responsive, if the effect of cool nights on meristem temperature cannot be mitigated by <b>a</b> <b>ponded</b> water layer.

5|$|The {{surface of}} any liquid is an {{interface}} between that liquid {{and some other}} medium. The top surface of <b>a</b> <b>pond,</b> for example, is an interface between the pond water and the air. Surface tension, then, is not a property of the liquid alone, but a property of the liquid's interface with another medium. If a liquid is in a container, then besides the liquid/air interface at its top surface, {{there is also an}} interface between the liquid and the walls of the container. The surface tension between the liquid and air is usually different (greater than) its surface tension with the walls of a container. And where the two surfaces meet, their geometry must be such that all forces balance.|$|E
