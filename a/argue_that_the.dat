5|$|With {{the growth}} of {{scholarly}} criticism in the 17th and 18th centuries, fewer historians believed Philip to be a Christian. Historians had become increasingly aware of secular texts, which did not describe Philip as a Christianand which, indeed, recorded him participating as pontifex maximus (chief priest) over the millennial Secular Games in 248. Modern scholars are divided on the issue. Some, like Hans Pohlsander and Ernst Stein, <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ecclesiastic narratives are ambiguous, based on oral rumor, and do not vouch for a Christian Philip; others, like John York, Irfan Shahîd, and Warwick Ball, <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ecclesiastic narratives are clear and dependable enough that Philip {{can be described as}} a Christian; still others, like Glen Bowersock, <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sources are strong enough to describe Philip as a man interested in and sympathetic to Christianity, but not strong enough to call him a Christian.|$|E
5|$|Although the Auburn Dam is now mostly {{considered}} history, {{there are}} still proponents and groups devoted to restarting the long-inactive project. Advocates <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> construction of Auburn {{would be the only}} solution for providing much-needed flood protection to the Sacramento area; that millions of dollars have already been spent making preparations; that it would provide an abundant supply of reliable water and hydroelectricity; and also that the recreational areas lost under the reservoir could be rebuilt around it. A major supporter of the revival of the dam is the Sacramento County Taxpayer's League; a recent survey revealed that up to two-thirds of Sacramento citizens support construction of the Auburn. They also <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dam would only cost $2.6 billion instead of $6–10 billion, and that it is the cheapest alternative to provide flood control for the American River.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the recent}} successes in Cincinnati, the captive-breeding program has {{remained}} controversial. Proponents <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> zoos {{have not only}} aided the conservation effort by studying the reproductive habits, raising public awareness and education about the rhinos, helping raise financial resources for conservation efforts in Sumatra but, moreover, to have established a small captive breeding group. Opponents of the captive breeding program <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> losses are too great; the program is too expensive; removing rhinos from their habitat, even temporarily, alters their ecological role; and captive populations cannot match the rate of recovery seen in well-protected native habitats. In October 2015 Harapan, the last rhino in the Western Hemisphere, left the Cincinnati Zoo to Indonesia.|$|E
50|$|PNU <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{contract}} {{was at an}} end. <b>The</b> Ansleys <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> contract only ended due to PNU not pursing the consent in a proper manner.|$|R
50|$|While Pro-democracy groups <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> police used {{excessive}} force, Pro-Beijing advocates disputed this claim. Some {{who supported}} Beijing <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> protestors violated {{the rule of}} law.|$|R
25|$|James Marchand <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Euthalian {{apparatus}} probably {{dated to}} {{the first half of}} <b>the</b> 4th century, <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> original must precede its incorporation into Gothic, Armenian, and Syriac translations.|$|R
5|$|Historians <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mass {{confiscation}} of Armenian properties was {{an important}} factor in forming the economic basis of the Turkish Republic while endowing Turkey's economy with capital. The appropriation {{led to the formation of}} a new Turkish bourgeoisie and an exclusive middle class.|$|E
5|$|In 2015 Bancoult went {{to court}} to <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{judgement}} should be set aside due to the non-disclosure of a 2002 feasibility study relating to the resettlement of the former inhabitants of the Chagos Islands. The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom ruled against reviewing the case on 29 June 2016.|$|E
5|$|M.C. Curthoys and H.S. Jones <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rise of {{organised}} {{sport was}} one of the most remarkable and distinctive features of the history of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was carried over from the athleticism prevalent at the public schools such as Eton and Harrow.|$|E
50|$|Nixon <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> statute {{violated}} the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution. <b>The</b> defendants <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Court lacked {{jurisdiction over the}} issue, {{as it was a}} political question.|$|R

25|$|In their brief, the Bar of Human Rights Committee and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{shackling}} of Deck was a {{human rights}} violation. It was also <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> shackles violated due process and common law and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> shackles diminished courtroom dignity. Additionally, it was <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> shackles contributed to self-incrimination, and prevented Deck from confronting witnesses against him.|$|R
5|$|Several {{anti-noise}} {{and electric}} car advocates have opposed {{the introduction of}} artificial sounds as warning for pedestrians, as they <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> proposed system will only increase noise pollution. They also opposed U.S. pending legislation that would require generated warning sounds with no off switch for the driver.|$|E
5|$|Skeptics <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{connection}} of conspiracy theorists and occultists follows from their common fallacious premises. First, any widely accepted belief must necessarily be false. Second, stigmatized knowledge—what the Establishment spurns—must be true. The {{result is a}} large, self-referential network in which, for example, some UFO religionists promote anti-Jewish phobias while some antisemites practice Peruvian shamanism.|$|E
5|$|Skeptics <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> demonization of Western esotericism by {{conspiracy}} theorists {{is rooted in}} religious intolerance {{but also in the}} same moral panics that have fueled witch trials in the Early Modern period, and satanic ritual abuse allegations in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Rodrigue Tremblay has <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Quran {{commands}} <b>that</b> non-Muslims under a Muslim regime, should [...] "feel themselves subdued" [...] in [...] "a political {{state of}} subservience" [...] He also <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Quran may assert freedom within religion.

40|$|This Article <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Ninth Circuit {{decision}} in Stanton Road was wrong. Section II of this Article describes {{the majority and}} dissenting opinions in Stanton Road. Section III <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> majority misread Supreme Court precedent, leading it to adopt an excessively formalistic approach to statutory construction. It <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> majority should have used traditional approaches to statutory construction and that those approaches would have produced a different result. Finally, the Article concludes by <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Ninth Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s decision distorts the intent of Congress in enacting CERCLA and hinders private efforts to clean up hazardous waste...|$|R
5000|$|... ==Overview== His book Hadith: A re-evaluation <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Quran is {{complete}} and the hadith {{is a human}} invention. He further <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hadith were a product of human politics. He also states <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hadith often contradict themselves, contradict the Quran and often contradict scientific facts. He <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Quran is the sole source of legislation and <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> use of <b>the</b> hadith in an authoritative way is a sinful bid‘ah (innovation). His public lectures on hadith were subsequently cancelled in late 1985, and his book was banned in Malaysia.|$|R
5|$|Some {{put forth}} that this intermixing of species {{is against the}} teachings of the Talmud and thus against Jewish Law and nonkosher. Others <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> one in sixty parts law of kashrut is of significance, and that the foreign gene {{accounts}} for the less than 1/60 of the animal and thus the modified salmon is kosher.|$|E
5|$|The Annal stone gives {{absolutely}} {{no indication of}} {{a division of the}} Egyptian realm. Barta, TeVelde, Wilkinson and Edwards <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> theory of state division is untenable. An administrative reorganization or split in the priesthood sects is more likely.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent to}} which both Graffham and Fortitude North {{influenced}} German strategy in Scandinavia is disputed, with some historians arguing that very little of either deception reached the enemy. While others <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> existence of fictional units in Scotland helped confirm German fears of a diversionary attack in the region.|$|E
50|$|Kerr-McGee <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Indian Reorganization Act (IRA) {{required}} the Secretary of the Interior to approve any tribal taxes on non-Indians. They also <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Indian Mineral Leasing Act (IMLA) required BIA approval for taxes.|$|R
50|$|Both parties <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sequels were {{transformative}} at {{the trial}} and first appellate level. Whereas Hugo's estate <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> transformative nature diluted the protected essential personality of <b>the</b> work, Plon <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> transformative nature was made it less likely <b>that</b> <b>the</b> work borrowed the essential, protected personality. While this issue was not addressed by the Cour de Cassation, it is an argument which may bear fruit in subsequent droit moral litigation.|$|R
50|$|Nationwide News <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Act infringed {{the implied}} freedom of {{political}} communications, while <b>the</b> Commonwealth <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Act was valid under section 51(xxxv) (conciliation and arbitration power), {{as well as}} section 51(xxxix) (express incidental power).|$|R
5|$|An {{important}} event following {{the conquest of}} the Carpathian Basin, the Bavarians' murder of Kurszán, was recorded by the longer version of the Annals of Saint Gall, the Annales Alamannici and the Annals of Einsiedeln. The first places the event in 902, while the others date it to 904. The three chronicles unanimously state that the Bavarians invited the Hungarian leader to a dinner on the pretext of negotiating a peace treaty and treacherously assassinated him. Kristó and other Hungarian historians <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dual leadership over the Hungarians ended with Kurszán's death.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} related genus Barosaurus, the very long neck of Diplodocus {{is the source}} of much {{controversy}} among scientists. A 1992 Columbia University study of diplodocid neck structure indicated that the longest necks would have required a 1.6-ton heart — a tenth of the animal's body weight. The study proposed that animals like these would have had rudimentary auxiliary 'hearts' in their necks, whose only purpose was to pump blood up to the next 'heart'. Some <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> near-horizontal posture {{of the head and neck}} would have eliminated the problem of supplying blood to the brain, as it would not be elevated.|$|E
5|$|Baird's first {{press conference}} as a cabinet {{minister}} {{was held in}} July 1999, and was intended to highlight the Harris government's record in reducing the provincial welfare rolls. Baird told reporters that 15,000 people had left the system since the introduction of workfare, and used this figure to <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> government's policy was a success. At the time, he lacked information {{on the number of}} workfare recipients who actually found jobs, and he also did not account for 40% of the welfare recipients who had been cut from the list. A number of media reports subsequently criticized both the principle and the implementation of workfare in Ontario.|$|E
50|$|The {{mayor of}} Whitefish, Montana, John Muhlfeld, <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bill would protect the town's water supply indefinitely {{and said the}} city fully {{supported}} the bill. Supporters also <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bill {{would be good for}} tourism.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lack of uniform {{protection}} against SLAPPs has encouraged forum shopping; proponents of federal legislation have <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> uncertainty about one's {{level of protection}} has likely magnified the chilling effect of SLAPPs.|$|R
40|$|Conflict is so {{vital and}} complex {{an issue that}} it invites disagreement. Nehemia Friedland <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{cooperative}} and competitive approach focuses {{too much on the}} cognitive at the expense of motivation, whereas Jorn Rognes <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> framework needed to be supplemented by cognitive approaches. Evert van de Vliert critiqued the theory as not considering perceptional elements, whereas Ronald Fisher <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> approach was highly psychological and did not adequately consider structural, objective interests...|$|R
5|$|Dimetrodon was {{probably}} one of the apex predators of the Cisuralian ecosystems, feeding on fish and tetrapods, including reptiles and amphibians. Smaller Dimetrodon species may have had different ecological roles. The sail of Dimetrodon may have been used to stabilize its spine or to heat and cool its body as a form of thermoregulation. Some recent studies <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sail would have been ineffective at removing heat from the body, and was most likely used in courtship display.|$|E
5|$|Dualism and monism {{are the two}} central {{schools of}} thought on the mind–body problem, {{although}} nuanced views have arisen that do not fit {{one or the other}} category neatly. Dualism is seen even in the Eastern tradition, in the Sankhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy, and Plato, but its entry into Western philosophy was thanks to René Descartes in the 17th century. Substance dualists like Descartes <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mind is an independently existing substance, whereas property dualists maintain that the mind is a group of independent properties that emerge from and cannot be reduced to the brain, but {{that it is not a}} distinct substance.|$|E
5|$|FairTax proponents <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{proposal}} would provide tax burden visibility and reduce compliance and efficiency costs by 90%, returning {{a large share}} of money to the productive economy. The Beacon Hill Institute concluded that the FairTax would save $346.51 billion in administrative costs and would be a much more efficient taxation system. Bill Archer, former head of the House Ways and Means Committee, asked Princeton University Econometrics to survey 500 European and Asian companies regarding the effect on their business decisions if the United States enacted the FairTax. 400 of those companies stated they would build their next plant in the United States, and 100 companies said they would move their corporate headquarters to the United States. Supporters <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> U.S. has the highest combined statutory corporate income tax rate among OECD countries along with being the only country with no border adjustment element in its tax system. Proponents state that because the FairTax eliminates corporate income taxes and is automatically border adjustable, the competitive tax advantage of foreign producers would be eliminated, immediately boosting U.S. competitiveness overseas and at home.|$|E

50|$|In October 2011, a Wellington-based Taranaki tribal {{collective}} <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Wharewaka did {{not constitute}} a marae, and therefore they <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Port Nicholson Block Settlement Trust should move a Trust review meeting to an actual marae in the Hutt Valley.|$|R
