Our remarks pertain to the growth model p = D T L + as K, + s given as eq. (7) by Mason and Millis.

The resulting surfaces are called "hyperbolic nets" and are a novel piecewise smooth discretization of surfaces parametrized along <b>asymptotic</b> <b>lines.</b> It turns out that a simply connected affine A-net has to satisfy one combinatorial and one geometric condition to be extendable - all vertices have to be of even degree and all quadrilateral strips have to be "equi-twisted". Furthermore, if an A-net can be extended to a hyperbolic net, then there exists a 1 -parameter family of such C^ 1 -surfaces. It is briefly explained how the generation of hyperbolic nets can be implemented on a computer. The article uses the projective model of Pluecker geometry to describe A-nets and hyperboloids.

40|$|Abstract—Based on {{the concept}} of charge moment tensor T ̃ which is {{different}} from the existent electric multiple-moment, and the concept of principal axes and principal-axis scalar charge moment, the condition of zero magnetic moment for an arbitrary rotational body with given charge distribution has been given explicitly in this paper. We find the loss of positive definiteness of T ̃ is its most important characteristic which forms a sharp contrast with that of its mechanic counterpart — the positive definite inertia tensor of rigid bodies. Meanwhile the relationship between the quadric distributive law of magnetic moment and the parameters of tensor T ̃ is discussed in detail. According to the theory of analytic geometry, we give a series of test formulae, classify and enumerate every kind of possible quadric in a table. Finally, conclusion is given that any rotation axis which passes through originO and along with any of the <b>asymptotic</b> <b>line</b> of the quadric (hyperboloids or hyperbolic cylinders) can lead to a vanishing magnetic moment. 1...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} devoted {{to the study of the}} {{mechanical}} behavior of thin elastic shells when their relative thickness ε tends to zero. We focus on the case of hyperbolic shells whose middle surface has principal curvatures of opposite signs everywhere. We use the Koiter model to describe the mechanical behavior of the shell. The corresponding system, which depends on the relative thickness ε, is elliptic except at the limit for ε= 0 where it is hyperbolic. In a first part, we study theoretically the phenomena of internal layers appearing during the singular perturbation process, when the loading is somewhat singular. These layers have very different structures either they are along or across the asymptotic lines of the middle surface of the shell. Moreover, we may have pseudo-reflections when a part of the boundary is not along an <b>asymptotic</b> <b>line</b> of the surface. In any case, the layers become very thin when ε tends to zero and the displacements inside the layers tends to infinity. In order to have a good description of the singularities of the displacements inside the layers, we propose here to use an anisotropic and adaptive mesh procedure. In a second part, we will present numerical computations performed with such meshes. They enable us to approach accurately the singularities inside the layers predicted by the theory. Finally, we test the behavior of the remeshing procedure when the shell is non-inhibited...|$|E
40|$|Exact and <b>asymptotic</b> <b>line</b> shape {{expressions}} {{are derived}} from the semiclassical density matrix representation describing a set of closed three-level atomic or molecular states including decoherences, relaxation rates, and light shifts. An accurate analysis of the exact steady-state dark-resonance profile describing the Autler- Townes doublet, the electromagnetically induced transparency or coherent population trapping resonance, and the Fano-Feshbach line shape leads to the linewidth expression of the two-photon Raman transition and frequency shifts associated to the clock transition. From an adiabatic analysis of the dynamical optical Bloch equations in the weak field limit, a pumping time required to efficiently trap {{a large number of}} atoms into a coherent superposition of long-lived states is established. For a highly asymmetrical configuration with different decay channels, a strong two-photon resonance based on a lower states population inversion is established when the driving continuous-wave laser fields are greatly unbalanced. When time separated resonant two-photon pulses are applied in the adiabatic pulsed regime for atomic or molecular clock engineering, where the first pulse is long enough to reach a coherent steady-state preparation and the second pulse is very short to avoid repumping into a new dark state, dark-resonance fringes mixing continuous-wave line shape properties and coherent Ramsey oscillations are created. Those fringes allow interrogation schemes bypassing the power broadening effect. Frequency shifts affecting the central clock fringe computed from asymptotic profiles and related to the Raman decoherence process exhibit nonlinear shapes with the three-level observable used for quantum measurement. We point out that different observables experience different shifts on the lower-state clock transition...|$|E

40|$|Considering the {{tangent plane}} {{at a point}} to a surface in the four-dimensional Euclidean space, we find an {{invariant}} {{of a pair of}} two tangents in this plane. If this invariant is zero, the two tangents are said to be conjugate. When the two tangents coincide with a given tangent, then we obtain the normal curvature of this tangent. Asymptotic tangents (curves) are characterized by zero normal curvature. Considering the invariant of the pair of a given tangent and its orthogonal one, we introduce the geodesic torsion of this tangent. We obtain that principal tangents (curves) are characterized by zero geodesic torsion. The invariants and k are introduced as the symmetric functions of the two principal normal curvatures. The geometric meaning of the semi-sum of the principal normal curvatures is equal (up to a sign) to the curvature of the normal connection of the surface. The number of asymptotic tangents at a point of the surface is determined by the sign of the invariant k. In the case k= 0 there exists a one-parameter family of <b>asymptotic</b> <b>lines,</b> which are principal. We find examples of such surfaces (k= 0) in the class of the general rotational surfaces (in the sense of Moore).
