5000|$|It {{is common}} {{practice}} for boards to include [...] "prototyping areas", {{areas of the}} board laid out as <b>a</b> solderable <b>breadboard</b> area with the bus and power rails available, but without a defined circuit. Several controllers, particularly those intended for training, also include <b>a</b> pluggable, re-usable <b>breadboard</b> for easy prototyping of extra I/O circuits that could be changed or removed for later projects.|$|R
50|$|Under a {{contract}} from the US Air Force's RADC research arm, they had built <b>a</b> <b>breadboard</b> prototype machine in 1964, but the RADC contract ended and Westinghouse decided not to follow it up on their own.|$|E

50|$|Italy, joining Germany, entered WWII in June 1940 {{without an}} {{operational}} RDT. <b>A</b> <b>breadboard</b> of the EC-3 was built and tested from atop a {{building at the}} Academy, but most RDT work was stopped as direct support of the war took priority.|$|E

50|$|Some {{manufacturers}} provide separate bus and terminal strips. Others just provide breadboard blocks {{which contain}} both in one block. Often breadboard strips or blocks of one brand can be clipped {{together to make}} <b>a</b> larger <b>breadboard.</b>|$|R
40|$|A planar digital-beamforming (DBF) antenna for user {{terminals}} {{in future}} satellite navigation systems {{has been developed}} to improve the overall system performance. <b>A</b> C-band <b>breadboard</b> model including aperture coupled patches, receiver and signal-processing unit has been designed, manufactured and tested...|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>breadboard</b> is a {{construction}} base for prototyping of electronics. Originally it was literally a bread board, a polished {{piece of wood}} used for slicing bread. In the 1970s the solderless breadboard (AKA plugboard, a terminal array board) became available and nowadays the term [...] "breadboard" [...] is commonly {{used to refer to}} these.|$|E
50|$|Alternative {{methods to}} create prototypes are {{point-to-point}} construction (reminiscent {{of the original}} wooden breadboards), wire wrap, wiring pencil, and boards like the stripboard. Complicated systems, such as modern computers comprising millions of transistors, diodes, and resistors, do not lend themselves to prototyping using breadboards, as their complex designs {{can be difficult to}} lay out and debug on <b>a</b> <b>breadboard.</b>|$|E
50|$|The NSSC-1 had an assembler/loader/simulator toolset hosted on Xerox XDS 930 (24- bit) mainframe. An {{associated}} simulator ran at 1/1000 of real time. The Xerox {{computer was}} interfaced to <b>a</b> <b>breadboard</b> OBP in a rack. (Which, of course, operated {{at room temperature}} ambient conditions). Later, the Software Development and Validation Facility (SDVF) added a flight dynamics simulator hosted on a PDP-11/70 minicomputer.|$|E
50|$|Initially, the Rad Lab built <b>an</b> {{experimental}} <b>breadboard</b> {{set with}} <b>a</b> 10 cm {{transmitter and receiver}} using separate antennas (the T-R switch was not yet available). This was successfully tested in February 1941, detecting an aircraft at a range of 4 miles.|$|R
50|$|The Big Board II (1982) {{incorporated}} many of {{the most}} popular upgrades for the original Big Board into its design. It also featured <b>a</b> small <b>breadboard</b> area that allowed for many simple upgrades to be performed without the addition of daughter boards.|$|R
5000|$|Breadboards {{have evolved}} over time, {{with the term}} now being used {{for all kinds of}} {{prototype}} electronic devices. For example, US Patent 3,145,483, was filed in 1961 and describes <b>a</b> wooden plate <b>breadboard</b> with mounted springs and other facilities. US Patent 3,496,419, was filed in 1967 and refers to a particular printed circuit board layout as <b>a</b> Printed Circuit <b>Breadboard.</b> Both examples refer to and describe other types of breadboards as prior art.|$|R
50|$|Within a year, the {{controller}} had become {{larger and more}} complex. <b>A</b> <b>breadboard</b> electronic version complete with sensor amplifiers and large control modules consumed the entire back end of a station wagon. Input data came from variable reluctance sensors installed at the front drive shaft, rear drive shaft, throttle, brakes, and steering. The goal was to control clutch actuation by controlling current.|$|E
50|$|Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) are {{the modern-day}} {{technology}} for building <b>a</b> <b>breadboard</b> or prototype from standard parts; programmable logic blocks and programmable interconnects allow the same FPGA {{to be used}} in many different applications. For smaller designs or lower production volumes, FPGAs may be more cost effective than an ASIC design even in production. The non-recurring engineering (NRE) cost of an ASIC can run into the millions of dollars.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>breadboard</b> {{prototype}} {{was largely}} completed by late 1983, and {{shown at the}} January 1984 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) with the Boing Ball demo. A further developed version was demonstrated at the June 1984 CES and shown to many companies in hopes of garnering further funding, but found little interest in a market {{that was in the}} final stages of the North American video game crash of 1983.|$|E
50|$|The Data Manager module {{allows the}} user to import data from Microsoft Access, Microsoft Excel or text files and perform various {{preprocessing}} and data analysis operations. From the Data Manager, the user can load the data directly into <b>a</b> NeuroSolutions <b>breadboard</b> or use the data {{to create a new}} neural network.|$|R
5000|$|The first Amiga {{computer}} was the [...] "Lorraine" [...] developed using the Sage IV system. It consisted of <b>a</b> stack of <b>breadboarded</b> circuit boards.|$|R
40|$|The VISIR Open Lab Platform is a client/server {{application}} enabling {{learners to}} perform physical electrical experiments over the Internet using a web browser. Virtual front panels and <b>a</b> virtual <b>breadboard</b> {{displayed on the}} client PCs are used to control the physical equipment giving the learners {{the impression that they}} are working in a real laboratory...|$|R
5000|$|Snap Circuits {{is a line}} of {{electronic}} kits manufactured by Elenco Electronics and aimed at children eight years and older. [...] The kits {{come in a variety}} of sizes, offering a range of building experience for the user, and may include motors, lamps and speakers. The kits consist of <b>a</b> <b>breadboard</b> with prewired interconnections, into which the various components can be snapped to easily create a working circuit.|$|E
50|$|The first radar {{proximity}} fuze {{was proposed}} by Butement, Edward S. Shire, and Amherst F.H. Thompson, {{in a memo}} to the British Air Defence Establishment in May 1940. <b>A</b> <b>breadboard</b> circuit was constructed by the inventors and the concept was tested in the laboratory by moving a sheet of tin at various distances. Early field testing connected the circuit to a thyratron trigger operating a tower-mounted camera which photographed passing aircraft to determine distance of fuze function.|$|E
5000|$|A jump wire (also {{known as}} jumper, jumper wire, jumper cable, DuPont wire, or DuPont cable - named for one {{manufacturer}} of them) is an electrical wire {{or group of}} them in a cable with a connector or pin at each end (or sometimes without them - simply [...] "tinned"), which is normally used to interconnect the components of <b>a</b> <b>breadboard</b> or other prototype or test circuit, internally or with other equipment or components, without soldering.|$|E
50|$|One example use of CPMV {{particles}} is {{to amplify}} signals in microarray based sensors. In this application, the virus particles separate the fluorescent dyes used for signaling {{in order to}} prevent the formation of non-fluorescent dimers that act as quenchers. Another example is the use of CPMV as <b>a</b> nanoscale <b>breadboard</b> for molecular electronics.|$|R
