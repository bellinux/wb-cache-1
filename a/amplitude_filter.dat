This architecture allows power-efficient and flexible sculpturing of the output spectrum, which is no longer tied directly to the characteristics of the pulse source used at the input. The pulse shaping function is obtained by application of the inverse split-step Fourier method (ISSFM) [1], which uses the desired output spectrum and the HNLF characteristics as its input parameters [2]. As an example of the application of this technique, we study the generation of broadband flat (third-order super-Gaussian) spectra starting from a 10 GHz mode-locked pulsed laser (MLL).

40|$|We {{analyze the}} effect of a highly {{dispersive}} element placed inside a modulated optical cavity on the frequency and amplitude of the output modulation to determine the conditions for enhanced gyroscopic sensitivities. The element is treated as both a phase and <b>amplitude</b> <b>filter,</b> and the time-dependence of the cavity field is considered. Both atomic gases (two-level and multi-level) and optical resonators (single and coupled) are considered and compared as dispersive elements. We find {{that it is possible to}} simultaneously enhance the gyro scale factor sensitivity and suppress the dead band by using an element with anomalous dispersion that has greater loss at the carrier frequency than at the side-band frequencies, i. e., an element that simultaneously pushes and intensifies the perturbed cavity modes, e. g. a two-level absorber or an under-coupled optical resonator. The sensitivity enhancement is inversely proportional to the effective group index, becoming infinite at a group index of zero. However, the number of round trips required to reach a steady-state also becomes infinite when the group index is zero (or two). For even larger dispersions a steady-state cannot be achieved, and nonlinear dynamic effects such as bistability and periodic oscillations are predicted in the gyro response...|$|E

We model these circuits, and from stochastic simulations, we study the performance of the filters and the stability of the switch. We find that these features degrade as the transcript levels are lowered. These effects can be alleviated by adding rate limiting steps to the transcription initiation process. In addition, we show that some features of the filters, such as cutoff levels, are affected by changes in mRNA production dynamics as well. In conclusion, our study shows that the kinetics of transcription initiation of the genes composing these circuits, which are largely determined by the promoter sequence, can be varied within realistic parameter ranges of values to alter considerably their behaviors...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} innovative {{techniques for}} reducing speckle noise {{and improving the}} intensity profile of the speckle correlation fringes. The methods are based on reducing {{the range of the}} modulation intensity values of the speckle interference pattern. After the fringe pattern is corrected adaptively at each pixel, a simple morphological filtering of the fringes is sufficient to obtain smoothed fringes. The concepts are presented both analytically and by simulation by using computer-generated speckle patterns and experimental verifications are performed wherever possible. A new generalized method for designing continuous amplitude-only pupil filters for transverse superresolution using a nonlinear programming method is also presented. The thesis emphasises the principal advantage of amplitude-only filters over their phase-only counterparts, that the side lobe intensities can be highly reduced along with the spot size. A quantitative comparison with continuous phase-only filters as well as the two-zone binary phase filter is shown with respect to spot size and ratio of side lobe to central peak intensity. The work is extended to combine the advantages of <b>amplitude</b> and phase <b>filters</b> in one complex filter that performs better than either phase or <b>amplitude</b> <b>filters</b> designed so far. The performance here refers to having a smaller spot size along with higher peak to side lobe intensity ratio. Using numerical simulation the limitations of phase and <b>amplitude</b> <b>filters</b> are assessed. The experimental verification of the designed combination filter is performed with two LCD spatial light modulators used for displaying separately the phase and amplitude part of the filter. Results obtained from this setup confirm the simulation. Finally, the effect of optical superresolution on speckle correlations is studied. Simulations reveal that using a lateral super-resolution pupil filter more than twice the out of plane correlation length of the clear pupil can be achieved. This means that the measurement range in speckle correlation measurements doubles. To verify the correlation length an experiment is performed using a liquid crystal (LCD) spatial light modulator as a programmable superresolution filter. The results corroborate the simulation...|$|R
40|$|A two-mode {{adjustable}} superresolving filter {{based on}} a birefringent filter is proposed. This kind of filter has superresolution in two modes of adjustment.

The filters act as complex <b>amplitude</b> <b>filters</b> in the former mode, and as pure phase filters in the latter. By analyzing two superresolving parameters, we obtain the optimal design parameters that ensure a large field of view, a large superresolving range, and a high setting accuracy.

40|$|Experimental {{realization}} of Fourier plane filters {{for use in}} a coherent optical deblurring system for pictures affected hy spaceÂ­ invariant blurs is discussed. Linear motion blur and defocusing are the two types of blurs considered. A method of developing phaseÂ­ inverting filters as diffraction gratings is given. The amplitude filters to go with the phase-inverting filters are developed as density variations on photographic films. The results of deblurring both linear motion blurred objects and out-of-focus pictures are presented and the degree of deblurring achieved is discussed. It is found that increasing the noise tenn in the <b>amplitude</b> <b>filter</b> results in loss of resolution in the deblurred output. Linear motion blurred object is then processed with an 'amplitude only' filter after subjecting the input object to a further blur of the same nature and amount as the original blur. Deblurring filters are also developed as binary holograms and the deblurred outputs presented and discussed. Loss of resolution in the output due to coarse amplitude quantization levels in a binary hologram filter is reduced by splitting the amplitude part of the filter into two halves and having only one of the halves encoded in the binary hologram filter while the other is produced as a photographic density variation.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} effect of a highly {{dispersive}} element placed inside a modulated optical cavity on the frequency and amplitude of the modulation to determine the conditions for cavity self-stabilization and enhanced gyroscopic sensitivity. Hence, we model cavity rotation or instability by an arbitrary AM/FM modulation, and the dispersive element as a phase and <b>amplitude</b> <b>filter.</b> We find that anomalous dispersion may be used to self-stabilize a laser cavity, provided the magnitude of the group index of refraction is smaller than the phase index of refraction in the cavity. The optimal stabilization is found to occur when the group index is zero. Group indices with magnitudes larger than the phase index (both normal and anomalous dispersion) are found to enhance the sensitivity of a laser gyroscope to rotation. Furthermore, our results indicate that atomic media, even coherent superpositions in multilevel atoms, are not useful for these applications, because the amplitude and phase filters work against one another, i. e., decreasing the modulation frequency increases its amplitude and vice versa, with one exception: negative group indices whose magnitudes are larger than the phase index result in negative, but enhanced, beat frequencies. On the other hand, for optical resonators the dispersion reversal associated with critical coupling enables the amplitude and phase filters to work together under a greater variety of circumstances than for atomic media. We find that for single over-coupled resonators, {{or in the case of}} under-coupled coupled-resonator-induced absorption, the absorption and normal dispersion on-resonance increase the contrast and frequency of the beat-note, respectively, resulting in a substantial enhancement of the gyroscopic response. Moreover, for cavity self-stabilization, we propose the use of a variety of coupled-resonator induced transparency that is accompanied by anomalous dispersion...|$|E
