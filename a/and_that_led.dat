5|$|Jones was {{not alone}} in his wish to get more screen time; the writers, who were reading Internet forums and {{receiving}} mail from the audience that requested the same thing, decided that Pete would learn Clark's secret in season two. The creative team hoped that knowing Clark's secret would allow the character to be written into more scenes, and become involved on a daily basis with the Kent family. Ultimately, Pete's primary story arc in season three became the character's inability to deal with knowing Clark's secret, and his growing feeling of abandonment from Clark, who was spending more time with Chloe, Lana and Lex. Millar explains that they felt that the character was being wasted on Smallville, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> to the decision of writing the character off the show with the hope that he could come back in future episodes. There was dissension between the cast and crew over Jones's departure. According to Annette O'Toole (Martha Kent), Clark needs a guy friend in his life, and she feels that the Kents would have taken Pete in when his parents left Smallville. Though Gough does not disagree that writing out Pete Ross was the best thing, he does feel that his exit could have gone better. According to Gough, Pete's departure felt rushed, and seemed to lack the importance that it should have had.|$|E

One of the most violent incidents was the 1937 Ponce massacre, in which police officers fired upon Nationalists who were participating in a peaceful demonstration against American abuse of authority. About 100 civilians were wounded and 19 were killed, among them, a woman, Maria Hernández del Rosario, and a seven-year-old child, Georgina Maldonado.|$|E

In an accident in 1991, a tower controller in an airport forgot a step in a simple procedure <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> to two planes crashing into each other, killing a number of passengers and crew. An analysis of over 1300 fatal aviation accidents from 1950-2009 showed that the majority were due to pilot error: 50% attributed to pilot error, 6% due to non-pilot human error, 22% to mechanical failure, 12% to bad weather, 9% to sabotage, and 1% to other causes.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though they}} were disproved by police statistics, they {{received}} wide attention in the Serbian press <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> to further ethnic problems and eventual removal of Kosovo's status. Beginning in March 1981, Kosovar Albanian students of the University of Pristina organised protests seeking that Kosovo become a republic within Yugoslavia and demanding their human rights. The protests were brutally suppressed {{by the police and}} army, with many protesters arrested. During the 1980s, ethnic tensions continued with frequent violent outbreaks against Yugoslav state authorities, resulting in a further increase in emigration of Kosovo Serbs and other ethnic groups. The Yugoslav leadership tried to suppress protests of Kosovo Serbs seeking protection from ethnic discrimination and violence.|$|E
25|$|The Beothuks {{attempted}} to avoid Europeans in Newfoundland by moving from their traditional settlements. First they {{attempted to}} move to different coastal areas of Newfoundland where the Europeans did not have fishing camps set up, but soon they were so overrun {{that they had to}} move into inland Newfoundland. The Beothuks' main food sources were traditionally caribou, fish and seals, but their forced migration inland deprived them of two of these. This led to the over-hunting of caribou to survive, which soon led to a decrease in the caribou population in Newfoundland. The Beothuks were put into a position where they were forced from their traditional land and lifestyle into ecosystems that could not support them <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> to undernourishment and eventually starvation.|$|E

25|$|The {{decision}} is often remembered today as {{paving the way}} for free agency in baseball. However, it did so, according to Bill James, only by showing players they could not rely on the courts to strike down the antitrust exemption and the reserve clause along with it. But the effort by a player of Flood's stature did galvanize the players, and according to Marvin Miller it made the general public aware of the reserve clause. Labor law proved a more fruitful opportunity for the invalidation of the reserve clause. The next year the National Labor Relations Board voted that baseball came under its jurisdiction, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> to the Seitz decision three years later that Andy Messersmith and Dave McNally were free agents after they had played out a year without signing new contracts. That event is considered the true beginning of baseball free agency.|$|E

The newspaper La Prensa gave her good reviews <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> to its being brought by Canal 7 to television on the insistence of Mariano Perla. Simultaneously with her performance for Madanes, she opened the play Maribel y la extraña familia in the Odeón Theater, whose success led to performances in other cities such as Mar del Plata.

500|$|Christian Bale as John Connor. Director McG deemed Bale [...] "the most {{credible}} action {{star in the}} world" [...] during development. McG wanted Bale for Marcus, but the actor—even {{though he}} [...] "can't really remember why"—wanted to play John, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> to the character's role getting expanded in rewrites of the script. Bale {{was the first person}} to be cast and signed on for the role in November 2007. McG talked extensively with Bale in the UK about the role while the latter was filming The Dark Knight, and they both agreed to proceed. Although a fan of the Terminator series, he was at first uninterested until McG convinced him the story would be character-based and not rely on special effects. They kept working on the story every day, along with Worthington. McG said Bale broke his hand punching a Terminator prop during filming. Bale spent six to eight hours each day with McG in the editing room to advise the finished product.|$|E

[...] It's going to be a truly artistic experience that is going to take the form of the greatest post-apocalyptic house party that you've ever been to." [...] Although Gaga stated that she was inspired by the things she and West were doing with the Fame Kills tour, she concluded that {{she did not want to}} use any of the things that they had designed together. Later, she said that Fame Kills was [...] "the great lost tour", but confirmed that some of the elements of it were incorporated into The Monster Ball.|$|E
