25|$|However, the aye-aye {{is often}} viewed as a harbinger of evil and killed on sight. Others believe, if one points its narrowest finger <b>at</b> <b>someone,</b> they are marked for death. Some say the {{appearance}} of an aye-aye in a village predicts {{the death of a}} villager, {{and the only way to}} prevent this is to kill it. The Sakalava people go so far as to claim aye-ayes sneak into houses through the thatched roofs and murder the sleeping occupants by using their middle finger to puncture the victim's aorta.|$|E
25|$|Sticking one's {{tongue out}} <b>at</b> <b>someone</b> is {{considered}} a childish gesture of rudeness and/or defiance in many countries; the act may also have sexual connotations, depending {{on the way in}} which it is done. However, in Tibet it {{is considered a}} greeting. In 2009, a farmer from Fabriano, Italy was convicted and fined by the country's highest court for sticking his tongue out at a neighbor with whom he had been arguing. Proof of the affront had been captured with a cell phone camera. Blowing a raspberry can also be meant as a gesture of derision.|$|E

25|$|In Bernini’s sculpture, you see Neptune {{towering over}} Triton. He {{appears to be}} a man in his early thirties, with a beard and wavy locks. Neptune has his legs spread apart and is {{balancing}} on a large seashell that carries both himself and Triton. Neptune only has a large sheet covering his right shoulder and gliding in between his legs, revealing parts of the male anatomy. The anatomy of the entire body is defined and the twisting of his torso gives him a more trimmed outline of his muscles, allowing the viewer to pay particular attention to his muscles and how they are contracted or relaxed in his state of movement. While standing, Neptune also holds a trident downward in motion that makes it look like he is about to thrust it <b>at</b> <b>someone.</b> “(H)e turns his angry look towards the water, which gushes forth at his feet, imposing his command by thrusting down with his trident.” His arms are tense, forcefully gripping it to dictate his divine power. There is an implication of wind in the long sheet and Neptune’s hair drift backwards, aiding the illusion of reality.|$|E

500|$|Boone {{began to}} have {{financial}} troubles while living in Maysville. According to the later folk image, Boone the trailblazer was too unsophisticated for the civilization which followed him and which eventually defrauded him of his land. Boone was not the simple frontiersman of legend, however: he engaged in land speculation on a large scale, buying and selling claims {{to tens of thousands}} of acres. The land market in frontier Kentucky was chaotic, and Boone's ventures ultimately failed because his investment strategy was faulty and because his sense of honor made him reluctant to profit <b>at</b> <b>someone</b> else's expense. According to Faragher, [...] "Boone lacked the ruthless instincts that speculation demanded." ...|$|E

[...] When a second, larger, parley arrived to discuss the release of the two captives and the ships, the situation turned nasty when Captain Rogers, leader of the party, was insulted. [...] After he fired <b>at</b> <b>someone</b> on the occupied ship, the British responded in kind, wounding one and very nearly sinking the parley group's boat.

(The DVD, released the same year, also managed to sell over a million copies (equivalent to $7.91 million in pirated versions) in its first week alone., and, as of 11 February 2007, had grossed over $36.45million in rentals. A. O. Scott criticised Farrell's work: [...] "When he's not on screen, you don't miss him, and when he is, you find yourself, before long, looking <b>at</b> <b>someone</b> or something else." [...] Conversely, Peter Travers of Rolling Stone was enthusiastic. The actor also reportedly took a slight pay cut to make friend and recent Oscar winner Jamie Foxx happy: His salary was initially larger than Foxx's.|$|E

During the later stages of the project, Carey released the title, Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel, that would serve as the singer's twelfth studio album. She explained how plans for a ballad to be released were put on hold, because a new song she had written [...] "needed to be heard". On June 9, 2009, she wrote on her official Twitter account: [...] "Seriously, {{this is one of my}} favorite songs ever. I love the whole album. I'm completely immersed in it. I can't wait for you to hear it", and announced its title as [...] "Obsessed". Later that week, The-Dream, who co-wrote the song with Carey, claimed that the song was definitely aimed <b>at</b> <b>someone</b> in particular, and that it would upset them greatly. The song was transmitted digitally to radio stations on June 16, 2009 for immediate airplay and made its debut on Chicago radio station B96 at 2:00 pm. An official remix of the song, featuring rapper Gucci Mane, premiered on the same day.|$|E

Gaga then comes from around the block walking with her friends in pace and singing in the camera. Next, she is shown sleeping in a bed, and waking up to reveal pink high-heeled shoes. She sings and cooks for {{a man in a}} house while dancing. She irons clothes while the man is on phone screaming <b>at</b> <b>someone.</b> The two harlequin Great Danes who appear at the start of her [...] "Poker Face" [...] music video, also appear in this one.

Although heavily R, the song [...] "Superstar" [...] contains an interpolation of the rock song [...] "Light My Fire" [...] by The Doors. Hill said that she [...] "didn't {{want to come out}} with a [...] type of sound", but create [...] "something that was uniquely and very clearly a Lauryn Hill album." [...] She also said that she did not intend for the album's sound to be commercially appealing: [...] "There's too much pressure to have hits these days. Artists are watching Billboard instead of exploring themselves. Look <b>at</b> <b>someone</b> like Aretha, she didn't hit with her first album, but she was able to grow up and find herself. I wanted to make honest music. I don't like things to be too perfect, or too polished. People may criticize me for that, but I grew up listening to Al Green and Sam Cooke.

Rebecca was revealed to have been the one who pushed Paul and McGregor said that he knew early on in the storyline that she was the culprit. However, Mark did not know that Rebecca was responsible as he had been thrown by the false alibis. McGregor later said that his first week on Neighbours, filming the Who Pushed P.R? storyline, had stuck in his mind as there were many long interview scenes he had to get through.|$|E

[...] During the show's third season, {{the development of the}} character received negative reviews, with Cristopher Monfette of IGN stating that her storyline has become [...] "some bizarrely under-developed sub-plot about depression and giving Derek a season's worth of reconsidering to do." [...] Also during the third season, Robert Rorke of the New York Post noted the decline in Meredith's role in the show, expressing disappointment: [...] "She used to be the queen of the romantic dilemmas, but lately, she's been a little dopey, what with the endless McDreamy soliloquies." [...] Similarly, Macleans.ca found their storyline in the fourth season overused, [...] "This whole 'Oh I need more time,' but 'Oh, I'm jealous if you look <b>at</b> <b>someone</b> else' angst was tired in the second season, frustrating in the third and now a total channel changer. The will-they-or-won't-they plot doesn't work because they've already {{been in and out of}} that relationship too many times. Meredith is a nag and McDreamy is henpecked."

[...] To me the song is about something most people can relate to, the battle you have with yourself, with your morality, with your demons. [...] We all know that we can be our own worst enemy and the only person that you truly have to blame in many instances is yourself. [...] “Trying to consume, the drug in me is you and I’m so high on misery can’t you see,” evokes the feeling that you are your own drug, the creator of your misery and if you need to point fingers <b>at</b> <b>someone</b> try looking in the mirror first.
