5|$|On January 6, the Bears {{conducted}} {{interviews for}} general manager with Gaine and Dawson. Ballard <b>and</b> <b>Pace</b> were interviewed the next day, <b>and</b> <b>Pace</b> was hired on January 8. On January 13, director of pro personnel Kevin Turks was fired. The Bears hired former Saints area scout Josh Lucas as their director of player personnel on January 18. In the scouting department, three scouts were hired on May 15. Ravens national scout Joe Douglas became {{the director of}} college scouting, Broncos assistant director of pro personnel Anthony Kelly as director of pro scouting and New York Jets area scout Christopher Prescott was hired in the same role.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fire}} in 1938, the {{pavilion}} was replaced with a 1,564 seat theatre which has since hosted a number of acts including; Frankie Vaughan, Frank Randle, Tessie O'Shea, Dave Morris, Bernard Delfont, Morecambe and Wise, Paul Daniels, Freddie Starr, Russ Abbot, Bruce Forsyth, Des O'Connor, Joe Longthorne, Lily Savage, Brian Conley and Hale <b>and</b> <b>Pace.</b>|$|E
5|$|Greaves was a {{prolific}} goalscorer, and cited his relaxed attitude {{as the reason}} for his assured composure and confidence. He also had great acceleration <b>and</b> <b>pace,</b> as well as great positional skills and opportunism inside the penalty area; he was also an excellent dribbler.|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{construction}} delay disputes {{often end}} up on the arbitration route where the delay experts appointed by the parties advise the tribunal on the extension of times entitlements of the parties. For this purpose, the identification and quantification of concurrent <b>and</b> <b>pacing</b> delays are integral aspects of resolving these disputes using a proper delay analysis methodology. The aim of the study is therefore, threefold. Firstly, the available literature on the concurrent <b>and</b> <b>pacing</b> delays are analyzed in detail to establish the principles for the evaluation of the concurrency <b>and</b> <b>pacing</b> delays. Secondly, a robust delay analysis methodology called ‘windows impact/update method’ is explained often used by the experts for the effective quantification of concurrent <b>and</b> <b>pacing</b> delays. This methodology is an improved version of time impact analysis and normal windows analysis. For better demonstration, the explanation of the methodology is facilitated {{with the help of a}} typical case study analysis. Finally, the principles of concurrency <b>and</b> <b>pacing,</b> as explained in the literature review, are promptly applied to the case study results to show the applicability of the analysis method on any types of delay disputes. The study shows the effectiveness of the windows impact/update method for the quantification of the concurrent <b>and</b> <b>pacing</b> delays...|$|R

5|$|A {{creative}} {{player on}} the ball, with excellent vision, technical skills, and an eye for goal, he is a free kick specialist and is capable of playing in several offensive positions. Due to his short stature, dynamic abilities <b>and</b> <b>pace,</b> Giovinco acquired the nickname formica atomica ("atomic ant", after the eponymous Hanna-Barbera character) in his youth. In 2015, he was {{named one of the}} 100 best footballers in the world by The Guardian, FourFourTwo, and L'Équipe.|$|E
5|$|It {{quickly became}} {{evident that the}} {{cyclical}} pattern of the monsoon weather would dictate the timing <b>and</b> <b>pace</b> of military operations in the northeast. From November through May (the dry season), North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces advanced out of Sam Neua Province along Route 6 {{and out of the}} Barthelemy Pass through Ban Ban toward the Plain of Jars. The lack of roads and the primitive state of those that did exist forced the communists to stretch their lines of communication taut, inviting counterattack. This Vang Pao's forces did from June through October (the wet season), utilizing air power, air mobility, and guerrilla tactics to push the communists back to their starting places.|$|E
5|$|Jones {{was born}} in Point Fortin, Trinidad and Tobago, to Lydia and Pamphile. and he {{attended}} St. Anthony's College in Trinidad along with his future Sunderland team-mate Carlos Edwards. His uncle, Philibert Jones was also a footballer as a prolific forward for Strike Squad that came within a point of qualifying for the 1990 World Cup and was a similar player to Kenwyne; both in style and celebration. His athleticism <b>and</b> <b>pace,</b> which Sunderland considered attractive, was not established until he joined Sheffield Wednesday in September and began to show his potential.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{his wide}} range of skills, Rodríguez is known for being equally adept at {{defending}} as he is going forward. Although usually a left-back, his size and physique have also seen him be deployed as a centre-back on occasion. Experts consider him as an accomplished defender and note his strong heading ability, as well his personality. He is also considered a continual attacking threat, and has been noted by analysts for his exceptional stamina <b>and</b> <b>pace,</b> which allow for his constant, buccaneering runs up the wing; he has also drawn praise from pundits for rarely conceding careless fouls. Conversely, he has been criticised for giving too much room to opposition attackers, taking up poor positioning and lacking in defensive discipline, while other analysts have criticised his concentration.|$|E
5|$|Icelandic horses {{still play}} {{a large part}} in Icelandic life, despite {{increasing}} mechanization and road improvements that diminish the necessity for the breed's use. The first official Icelandic horse race was held at Akureyri in 1874, and many races are still held throughout the country from April through June. Both gallop <b>and</b> <b>pace</b> races are held, as well as performance classes showcasing the breed's unique gaits. Winter events are often held, including races on frozen bodies of water. In 2009 such an event resulted in both horses and riders falling {{into the water and}} needing to be rescued. The first shows, focused on the quality of animals as breeding stock, were held in 1906. The Agricultural Society of Iceland, along with the National Association of Riding Clubs, now organizes regular shows {{with a wide variety of}} classes. Some horses are still bred for slaughter, and much of the meat is exported to Japan. Farmers still use the breed to round up sheep in the Icelandic highlands, but most horses are used for competition and leisure riding.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} innings, Bradman thought that rain might come so he {{utilised}} Toshack to bowl defensive leg theory. He did so {{to slow the}} scoring so that England {{would not have a}} lead by the time the rain came to create a sticky wicket, otherwise Australia would have been forced to chase a target on a difficult pitch with irregular bounce <b>and</b> <b>pace.</b> As the umpires were obliged to not call off play unless the light was so poor as endanger the batsman, the lack of pace of Johnson and Toshack forced proceedings to continue as they posed no injury threat to the batsmen. Early on the fourth morning, Toshack were able to make the ball deviate regularly while bowling to Hutton and Denis Compton, but Bradman opted to have Miller take the new ball in the fifth over of the day {{as soon as it was}} available, taking Toshack off. Later, Toshack was used defensively while Miller attacked from the other end. Bradman's response to a boundary being hit from Toshack was to further stack the leg side with fielders in defensive positions, and scoring was slow as Toshack bowled accurately. Toshack took the wicket of Joe Hardstaff junior for 43, who holed out to Hassett on the leg side, having supported Denis Compton in a partnership of 93. The ball looped up in the air and travelled half-way to the square leg boundary, but Hassett managed to keep track of its trajectory through the fog. Toshack ended with 1/60 from 33 overs as Australia were one bowler short after an injury to Lindwall had prevented him from bowling since the first afternoon. England were bowled out for 441 and Australia reached the target of 98 with eight wickets in hand.|$|E

5|$|In 1944, Shelton House, a {{building}} across Elm Road, was purchased as a dormitory, and a classroom and office wing was dedicated in 1951. In 1955, after Howard Deering Johnson joined {{the board of}} trustees, the dormitory Howard Johnson Hall was built. From 1963, Briarcliff College rapidly expanded, constructing two dormitories, the fine arts and humanities building, the Woodward Science Building, and a 600-seat dining hall. In 1964, the college began offering the Bachelor of Arts and of Sciences degrees. The Center for Hudson Valley Archaeology was opened in 1964. Enrollment at the college jumped from around 300 to over 500 from 1960 to 1964; by 1967, enrollment was at 623, with 240 freshmen. During the Vietnam War, students protested US involvement, and Adkins and trustees resigned; James E. Stewart became president. In 1969, twelve students, led by student president Edie Cullen, stole the college mimeograph machines and gave nine demands to the college. The next day, around 50 students participated in a 48-hour sit-in at Dow Hall. Josiah Bunting III became president in 1973 <b>and</b> <b>Pace</b> University and New York Medical College of Valhalla began leasing campus buildings. The college had 350 students in 1977, and students enjoyed half-empty dormitory buildings.|$|E
