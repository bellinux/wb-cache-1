5|$|After {{participating}} in Canada's Olympic summer camp before the season, Iginla again set new personal highs in 2001–02 when he registered 52goals and 96points.

The Hart Trophy voting proved to be controversial: Iginla tied Canadiens goaltender José Théodore in voting points, but received fewer first place votes than Théodore. However, one voter, rumoured to be from Quebec—Théodore and the Canadiens' home province—inexplicably left Iginla off his ballot.

5|$|Alabama {{started from}} their own four, and Lacy had a short gain before Richardson had four {{consecutive}} runs to move {{the ball to the}} 39-yard line. The next play was Alabama's longest play from scrimmage in the game when McCarron threw a 39-yard pass to Richardson and brought the ball to the LSU 19-yard line. However, for the fourth time in four offensive possessions, the LSU defense held Alabama to a field goal attempt. This time, the 34-yard Jeremy Shelley kick was good and the Crimson Tide took a 3–0 lead. Once the received the kickoff, LSU began their fourth offensive possession {{from their own}} 24. The Tigers opened their drive with runs of 14 and nine yards from Ford, followed by short runs from Ware, Jefferson and Ford again to bring the ball to the Alabama 36. After a five yard substitution penalty, Jefferson completed a 34-yard pass to Russell Shepard to give the Tigers a first <b>and</b> <b>goal</b> from the Alabama eight. After a four-yard rush by Ford and a Jefferson incompletion, Dre Kirkpatrick was called for holding that resulted in a first <b>and</b> <b>goal</b> from the Alabama two-yard line. Jefferson then threw another incompletion followed with a run for no gain by Ford. LSU then called a time-out with two seconds left in the half to set up a field goal attempt, and Alabama followed with a second time-out in an attempt to ice the kicker.

5|$|Arsenal {{went into}} {{the final day of}} the {{competition}} knowing a draw was enough to win the Emirates Cup. Alexandre Lacazette started for Arsenal, as did Mesut Özil, while Ben Yedder continued to lead the line for Sevilla in a front three – either side of Nolito and Joaquín Correa. After an uneventful first half which saw both sides create few chances, Sevilla took the lead when Ben Yedder's reverse ball found an incoming Correa who slotted the ball past Petr Čech. Lacazette equalised for Arsenal, but the hosts went behind again after Steven N'Zonzi's long shot looped into the far top corner. Sevilla held on to win, but despite a 100% record they finished second because Arsenal's points <b>and</b> <b>goal</b> difference was identical to theirs, and the Spanish club had scored fewer goals over the two days.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of rule changes on game-related statistics in men’s water polo matches. A total of 856 men’s matches played in all Olympic Games and World Championship since 1936 was analysed.
