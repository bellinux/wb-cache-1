5|$|After the war, of course, {{the roads}} were all bad. There were cobbles from the moment you left Paris, or Senlis where we started in those days. There'd be {{stretches}} of surfaced roads and often there'd be a cycle path or a pavement and sometimes a thin stretch of something smoother. But you never knew where was best to ride and you were for ever switching about. You could jump your bike up on to a pavement but that got harder the more tired you got. Then you'd get your front wheel up but not your back wheel. That happened to me. And then you'd go sprawling, of course, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> bring other riders down. Or they'd fall off and bring you down with them. And the cycle paths were often just compressed cinders, which got soft {{in the rain and}} got churned up by so many riders using them and then you got stuck and you lost your balance. And come what may, you got covered in coal dust and other muck. No, it's all changed and you can't compare then and now.|$|E

The school building is land-locked and bounded by surrounding buildings. Victoria Park High School resides {{to the west of}} LCI. Businesses are {{to the north of the}} school. A church and residential homes are across the street to the south of the LCI building. The Catholic Central High School is across the street to the east.|$|E
25|$|The {{first episode}} of Chef! was {{developed}} over two years, and so Peter Tilbury and I were really put through loads of hoops about character motivation. Why is this character such an arsehole? Is this {{the right kind}} of character for Lenny Henry to be playing? All that kind of stuff. Once we got through that and they greenlit the series, Peter then had something like eight or nine weeks to write the rest of it. The remaining five episodes were much easier to write because we'd had every argument about who, what, where, and how. The world had been mapped out. Actually, the very first episode of Chef! was the hardest one to watch for me because we'd worked so hard on it <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> see all the things that had been rewritten in the first episode.|$|E

25|$|Jim Wyatt, of the Tennesseean, {{reports that}} Ringer is the {{favorite}} for the 3rd string job, and almost a lock to make the roster. Fullback Ahmard Hall said “He’s a character guy, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> tell that from the start, He’s the total package. You rarely get that combination of humility and natural athletic ability and I think he has that great combination. You combine those two and you get someone who could be unstoppable.’’ Of all the praise, Ringer responded, “I have to give credit to how I was brought up. I {{grew up in a}} religious family and I know without God none of this would be possible for me anyway, so that definitely keeps me humble. My personality is not to boast and brag about the accomplishments and things I am trying to do. Actions speak louder than words and that is what I try and strive for.’’ In a 17-23 loss to the Cleveland Browns, Ringer only had one run for two yards. Ringer finished off the pre-season with a 7 carry 18 yard performance, in a 27-13 win over the Green Bay Packers.|$|E

500|$|After Wiggins died, several {{well-known}} baseball figures {{commented on}} his death. Longtime Oriole Frank Robinson said, [...] "He {{was a very}} bright individual, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> like the guy. But {{there was always something}} there to back you off."

500|$|St Hill {{possessed a}} {{presence}} which compelled attention {{when he was}} batting. James wrote: [...] "Fires burned in St Hill <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> always see them glow." [...] When playing for Shannon, he insisted on the highest standards, {{and even though he}} was not captain, he would take over if the game was going against his team. James also wrote that he never understood St Hill as he did others: [...] "His eyes used to blaze when he was discussing a point with you; but even within his clipped sentences there were intervals when he seemed to be thinking of other things, far removed." ...|$|E
500|$|Grimsby made {{a strong}} {{challenge}} for promotion in 1951–52 but finished second, three points behind Lincoln City (only one team was promoted from Division Three North, with one from Division Three South). Shankly insisted in his autobiography that his Grimsby team was: [...] "Pound for pound, and class for class, the best football team I have seen in England since the war. In the league they were in, they played football nobody else could play. Everything was measured, planned and perfected <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not wish to see more entertaining football". Stephen Kelly quotes the [...] "pound for pound" [...] analysis but qualifies it as [...] "another slight exaggeration, but he meant well". Kelly went on: [...] "that kind of talk could only boost morale at the club".|$|E

500|$|McNeill {{also agreed}} with Biller's view that [...] "Unity" [...] was {{a metaphor for}} the {{break-up}} of the USSR, and McNeill read up on the subject before directing the episode, saying that [...] "I think some of those ideas did come out in the story, even though it wasn't a really heavy, political episode. Yet there were some references <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> connect that to contemporary issues, individuality as opposed to group needs or desires." [...] McNeill was very happy with the resulting episode, saying that the Borg [...] "were not as one-dimensional as previously depicted, but still as evil as ever", and hoped to direct two or three more episodes in the [...] By the end of Voyager, he had directed four episodes overall; this signalled a change in direction for his career into directing full-time.|$|E
500|$|Sayers' {{ability as}} a runner in the open field was {{considered}} unmatched, both during his playing career and since his retirement. Although he possessed modest raw speed—he completed a 100-yard dash in 9.7 seconds—he was highly elusive and had terrific vision, a combination which made him very difficult to tackle. Actor Billy Dee Williams, who portrayed Sayers in the 1971 film Brian's Song, likened his running to [...] "ballet" [...] and [...] "poetry". Mike Ditka, a teammate of Sayers' for two seasons, called him [...] "the greatest player I've ever seen. That's right—the greatest." [...] Another former teammate, linebacker Dick Butkus, famous for his tackling ability, said of Sayers: He had this ability to go full speed, cut and then go full speed again right away. I saw it every day in practice. We played live, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> never get a clean shot on Gale. Never.|$|E
500|$|Falcons coach Dan Reeves {{was praised}} {{for his ability}} to lead the team after having heart surgery only weeks prior, as Reeves' {{comeback}} proved to be an emotional rallying point for the team. Austin Murphy of Sports Illustrated noted that Reeves' return [...] " [...] the already close-knit Falcons," [...] and Falcons linebacker Jessie Tuggle agreed: [...] "Dan has really inspired us all. [...] He walked in the meeting room four days after having had surgery, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have heard a pin drop. We wanted to hear every last word he had to say." [...] Reeves described his time during the season as [...] "more rewarding than any other teams I've been involved in," [...] and to Falcons special teams coach Joe DeCamillis, Reeves' leadership that season was [...] "his best coaching job ever." [...] CBS called Reeves' return [...] "an amazing comeback that people will be talking about for years." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1999, when Aronofsky turned 30 years old, {{his parents}} were {{diagnosed}} with cancer. He began reflecting on human mortality, [...] "That was a really heavy-duty emotional time. I know it's a very young age, but turning thirty marks when your twenties are over <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> start considering, 'Wow, {{one of these days}} I'm actually going to die.'" [...] While his parents overcame cancer, he began to focus on the concept of a young man saving a loved one from a life-threatening disease. He shared the concept with Handel, his undergraduate school roommate at Harvard University. Handel earned a Ph.D in neuroscience from New York University but was uncertain about a future in neuroscience. He recalled the discussion, [...] "Darren and I just started talking about the story. We kept wanting to talk more about it as the story kept getting bigger. I decided to make some life choices to continue working with Darren, because it was so much fun." ...|$|E
500|$|Before {{embarking on}} the storyline, the show's {{producers}} consulted with the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation {{to ensure they}} maintained realism throughout. Trish Doolan, star of April's Shower was invited to consult in the workshop sessions which took place, and surmised that; [...] "They were really wanting to be truthful to the two characters they're focusing on in the woman-woman relationship", with Nikki Weiss, who also consulted, adding: [...] "they didn't want to stereotype anything, either, and write from {{a place where they}} didn't understand it. [...] I don't think they did it as a stunt to get people back to watching after the strike. I really think that they wanted to develop these two characters, and that you could see a closeness with them way before they ever decided any kind of— I think they just have a chemistry together, as actresses, too. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> tell that in the room. They definitely have a chemistry." ...|$|E
500|$|Ford became Vice President as the Watergate scandal was unfolding. On Thursday, August 1, 1974, Chief of Staff Alexander Haig {{contacted}} Ford to {{tell him}} that [...] "smoking gun" [...] evidence had been found. The evidence left little doubt that President Nixon had {{been a part of the}} Watergate cover-up. At the time, Ford and his wife, Betty, were living in suburban Virginia, waiting for their expected move into the newly designated vice president's residence in Washington, D.C. However, [...] "Al Haig asked to come over and see me," [...] Ford later said, [...] "to tell me that there would be a new tape released on a Monday, and he said the evidence in there was devastating and there would probably be either an impeachment or a resignation. And he said, 'I'm just warning you that you've got to be prepared, that things might change dramatically <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> become President.' And I said, 'Betty, I don't think we're ever going to live in the vice president's house.|$|E

500|$|As Smith {{entered the}} 1996 season, he {{finalized}} a divorce {{from his wife}} Denise {{during the first half}} of the year. Meanwhile, manager Tony La Russa began his first season with the Cardinals in tandem with a new ownership group. After General Manager Walt Jocketty acquired shortstop Royce Clayton during the offseason, La Russa emphasized an open competition for the spot that would give the Cardinals the best chance to win. When spring training concluded, Smith had amassed a [...]288 batting average and zero errors in the field, and Clayton batted [...]190 with eight errors. Smith believed he had earned the position with his spring training performance, but La Russa disagreed, and awarded Clayton the majority of playing time in the platoon situation that developed, where Smith typically saw action every third game. La Russa said, [...] "I think it's fair to say he misunderstood how he compared to Royce in spring training...When I and the coaches evaluated the play in spring training—the whole game—Royce started very slowly offensively <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> see him start to get better. By what he was able to do defensively and on the bases, Royce deserved to play the majority of the games." ...|$|E
500|$|McCartney later said, [...] "We lived {{backstage}} in the Bambi Kino, {{next to the}} toilets, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> always smell them. The {{room had}} been an old storeroom, and there were just concrete walls and nothing else. No heat, no wallpaper, not a lick of paint; and two sets of bunk beds, with not very much covers—Union Jack flags—we were frozen." [...] Lennon remembered: [...] "We were put in this pigsty. We {{were living in a}} toilet, like right next to the ladies' toilet. We'd go to bed late and be woken up next day by the sound of the cinema show and old German fraus [...] pissing next door." [...] After having been awoken in this fashion, the group were then obliged to use cold water from the urinals for washing and shaving. They were paid £2.50 each a day, seven days a week, playing from 8:30-9:30, 10 until 11, 11:30-12:30, and finishing the evening playing from one until two o'clock in the morning. German customers found the group's name comical, as [...] "Beatles" [...] sounded like [...] "Peedles", which meant a small boy's penis.|$|E
500|$|Caribbean Sound Basin housed three {{separate}} studios and several amenities, including a swimming pool, gym, sauna, photographic studio, and bedroom suites. In contrast to most recording studios, its interior was spacious and exposed to natural light. At the studio complex, Raphael, D'wayne, and Riley recorded extensively {{into the night}} {{and went out to}} enjoy the nightlife, before returning to the studio. They often dimmed the lights, burned incense, and drank wine to set the mood when recording, which D'wayne explained in Musician, [...] "We try to make it real calm and mellow. 'Cause {{you want to be able}} to get into what you're singing." [...] They also immersed themselves in the local dancehall scene and attended late-night block parties that lasted until dawn. D'wayne later recalled his nightlife experiences with the group in Maravel: [...] "We'd heard dancehall, but we didn't really know anything about it before going there. We would go to these block parties <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> hear them from almost a mile away. You'd just park on the street and walk to the party along with four or five thousand other people, all partying with these giant speakers all over the place. And this happened just about every weekend." ...|$|E
