Gandhi, a group of 20 Indians and black people of South Africa volunteered as a stretcher-bearer corps to treat wounded British soldiers and {{the opposite side of}} the war: Zulu victims.|$|E
5|$|The plot follows four characters, Karen, Rick, Luke, and Rachel, as {{they arrive}} in the lounge of an airport bar, as they {{interact}} with one another, and as they cope with chaos that erupts as cataclysmic events occur.

40|$|In this {{introduction}} to the special issue on Action <b>and</b> <b>perception</b> in infancy, we summarize recent arguments of Milner and Goodale for a dissociation between vision for action <b>and</b> vision for <b>perception</b> in adults. We propose that this dissociation is probably present from birth, and further that vision for action <b>and</b> vision for <b>perception</b> follow different developmental trajectories. Based on this framework, we discern four themes of interest for infancy research (i. e., information and action, exploration and action, information <b>and</b> <b>perception,</b> <b>and</b> the interaction between action <b>and</b> <b>perception)</b> <b>and</b> introduce {{the contributions of the}} special issue accordingly...|$|R
40|$|During {{the eating}} of food, the in-mouth process leads to food {{breakdown}} which induces {{the release of}} flavour compounds. Volatile and non-volatile compounds are released into the saliva, and volatile compounds are transferred into the vapour phase to reach olfactory receptors in the nasal cavity. The aim of this chapter is to review the effects of changing the composition of cheeses on the mobility, release <b>and</b> <b>perception</b> of flavour molecules (salt, aroma compounds), and to discuss the results with respect to human physiology. Cheese is a good model because {{it is possible to}} vary its composition (in lipids, proteins, salt), in order to comply with nutritional guidelines (less salt, less fat) and to study the effects of these changes in composition on its microstructure and texture, and then on flavour (taste and aroma) release <b>and</b> <b>perception,</b> while taking account of in-mouth breakdown. Papers on this subject have mainly been related to either salt release <b>and</b> <b>perception</b> or aroma release <b>and</b> <b>perception,</b> <b>and</b> few have taken account of the combined effects of cheese composition on both salt and aroma release <b>and</b> <b>perception.</b> Indeed, recent papers from our research group have shown that the salt and fat contents of cheeses induce modifications to texture and microstructure that affect not only salt release <b>and</b> <b>perception</b> but also aroma release <b>and</b> <b>perception</b> <b>and</b> chewing behaviour...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of action <b>and</b> <b>perception,</b> <b>and</b> their relation in infancy {{is a central}} research area in socio-cognitive sciences. In this Perspective Article, {{we focus on the}} developmental variability and continuity of action <b>and</b> <b>perception.</b> At group level, these skills have been shown to consistently improve with age. We would like to raise awareness for the issue that, at individual level, development might be subject to more variable changes. We present data from a longitudinal study on the <b>perception</b> <b>and</b> production of contralateral reaching skills of infants aged 7, 8, 9 and 12 months. Our findings suggest that individual development does not increase linearly for action or for perception, but instead changes dynamically. These non-continuous changes substantially affect the relation between action <b>and</b> <b>perception</b> at each measuring point and the respective direction of causality. This suggests that research on the {{development of}} action <b>and</b> <b>perception</b> <b>and</b> their interrelations needs to take into account individual variability and continuity more progressively...|$|R
5|$|A {{pioneering}} {{work of the}} fantasy genre was The King of Elfland's Daughter, a 1924 novel by Lord Dunsany. The Elves of Middle-earth {{played a central role}} in Tolkien's legendarium, notably The Silmarillion and The Lord of the Rings; this legendarium was enormously influential on subsequent fantasy writing. Tolkien's writing had such influence that in the 1960s and afterwards, elves speaking an elvish language similar to those in Tolkien's novels became staple non-human characters in high fantasy works and in fantasy role-playing games. Post-Tolkien fantasy elves (which featured not only in novels but also role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons) are often portrayed as being wiser and more beautiful than humans, with sharper senses <b>and</b> <b>perceptions</b> as well. They are said to be gifted in magic, mentally sharp and lovers of nature, art, and song. They are often skilled archers. A hallmark of many fantasy elves is their pointed ears.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, {{acting on}} these {{feelings}} <b>and</b> <b>perceptions,</b> Stanton joined Mott, Mott's sister Martha Coffin Wright, Jane Hunt {{and a handful}} of other women in Seneca Falls. Together they organized the Seneca Falls Convention held in Seneca Falls on July 19 and 20. Over 300 people attended. Stanton drafted a Declaration of Sentiments, which she read at the convention. Modeled on the United States Declaration of Independence, Stanton's declaration proclaimed that men and women are created equal. She proposed, among other things, a then-controversial resolution demanding voting rights for women. The final resolutions, including female suffrage, were passed, in no small measure, because of the support of Frederick Douglass, who attended and informally spoke at the convention.|$|E
5|$|The PV {{industry}} has seen drops in module prices since 2008. In late 2011, factory-gate prices for crystalline-silicon photovoltaic modules dropped below the $1.00/W mark. The $1.00/W installed cost, is often regarded in the PV industry as marking {{the achievement of}} grid parity for PV. These reductions have taken many stakeholders, including industry analysts, by surprise, <b>and</b> <b>perceptions</b> of current solar power economics often lags behind reality. Some stakeholders still have the perspective that solar PV remains too costly on an unsubsidized basis to compete with conventional generation options. Yet technological advancements, manufacturing process improvements, and industry re-structuring, mean that further price reductions are likely in coming years.|$|E

5|$|After the war, {{federal highway}} {{subsidies}} and postwar development encouraged outward migration as residents moved to gain newer housing; this suburbanization significantly reduced the city's middle-class population. The city made {{efforts to create}} new attractions, such as the Gateway Arch, which construction became a focus {{of the civil rights}} movement to gain non-segregated jobs in the skilled trades. The first litigation under the 1964 Civil Rights Act was against St. Louis unions. The city worked to replace substandard housing by new public housing projects such as PruittIgoe. A combination of factors resulted in this being notoriously unsuccessful, and it was demolished in the late 20th century. Starting in the 1980s and continuing into the following century, construction and gentrification have increased in some areas of St. Louis, particularly downtown. City beautification and crime reduction have made progress, although St. Louis has continued to struggle with crime <b>and</b> <b>perceptions</b> of crime. The city saw modest population growth during the mid-2000s, but showed a decline in the 2010 U.S. Census.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the losses}} of {{industry}} and jobs, St. Louis has had significant and persistent problems with both crime <b>and</b> <b>perceptions</b> of crime. In 2011 St. Louis was named by U.S. News and World Report as the most dangerous city in the United States, using Uniform Crime Reports data published by the U.S. Department of Justice. In addition, St. Louis was named as the city with the highest crime rate in the United States by CQ Press in 2010, using data reported to the FBI in 2009. Critics of these analyses note that division between St. Louis City and St. Louis County make crime reports for the area appear inflated, and that reporting crime differs greatly depending on the localities involved. The FBI cautioned against using this data {{as a form of}} ranking, as it presents too simplistic a view of crime. From 2006 to 2007, the rate of city youth to be killed by guns was the second-highest in the United States, according to data released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The rate of firearm deaths for the metropolitan statistical area was one-fifth of the city rate.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{consider}} India's {{modern age}} {{to have begun}} sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1848 of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company {{set the stage for}} changes essential to a modern state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and the education of citizens. Technological changes—among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph—were introduced not long after their introduction in Europe. However, disaffection with the company also grew during this time, and set off the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Fed by diverse resentments <b>and</b> <b>perceptions,</b> including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule. Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and to the direct administration of India by the British government. Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest. In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all over India, leading eventually to the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885.|$|E

40|$|A growing {{literature}} suggests that individuals repeatedly check {{in part because they}} lack confidence in their memories for previously-completed actions. It has also been hypothesized that the cognitive distrust demonstrated by individuals with OCD extends beyond memory to related factors such as attention and perception; however, the relation between distrust in attention, <b>perception</b> <b>and</b> memory has yet to be examined. The present study examined the extent to which distrust in attention <b>and</b> <b>perception</b> relate to memory distrust and compulsive checking in participants ranging in OCD symptom severity. A measure of distrust in attention <b>and</b> <b>perception</b> was developed for this purpose. Initial psychometric results indicated that distrust in attention <b>and</b> <b>perception</b> can be measured reliably and that it is related to previously-established metacognitive factors (e. g., distrust in memory) and OCD-relevant beliefs (e. g., inflated sense of responsibility). Importantly, the present results also indicated that distrust in attention <b>and</b> <b>perception</b> contributed to checking symptoms beyond memory distrust, baseline negative mood and neuroticism, and previously-established OCD beliefs (i. e., inflated sense of responsibility). Taken together, these findings suggest that distrust in attention <b>and</b> <b>perception</b> may be an important mechanism in the persistence of compulsive checking...|$|R

40|$|Speech-associated {{gestures}} {{represent an}} important communication modality. However, {{individual differences in}} the production <b>and</b> <b>perception</b> of gestures are not well understood so far. We hypothesized that the perception of multisensory action consequences might play a crucial role. Verbal communication involves continuous calibration of audio–visual information produced by the speakers. The effective production <b>and</b> <b>perception</b> of gestures supporting this process could depend on the given capacities to perceive multisensory information accurately. We explored the association between the production <b>and</b> <b>perception</b> of gestures <b>and</b> the monitoring of multisensory action consequences {{in a sample of}} 31 participants. We applied a recently introduced gesture scale to assess self-reported gesture production <b>and</b> <b>perception</b> in everyday life situations. In the perceptual experiment, we presented unimodal (visual) and bimodal (visual and auditory) sensory outcomes with various delays after a self-initiated (active) or externally generated (passive) button press. Participants had to report whether they detected a delay between the button press and the visual stimulus. We derived psychometric functions for each condition and determined points of subjective equality, reflecting detection thresholds for delays. Results support a robust link between gesture scores and detection thresholds. Individuals with higher detection thresholds (lower performance) reported more frequent gesture production <b>and</b> <b>perception</b> <b>and</b> furthermore profited more from multisensory information in the experimental task. We propose that our findings indicate a compensational function of multisensory processing as a basis for individual differences in both action outcome monitoring and gesture production <b>and</b> <b>perception</b> in everyday life situations...|$|R
