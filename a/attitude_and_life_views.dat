40|$|This study {{examined}} the impact of selected Junior Master Gardeners (JMG) lessons on students? science knowledge gain, science <b>attitudes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>life</b> skill development. During summer 2013, sixth grade students (N = 84) and teachers (N = 11) from two rural schools in Guatemala participated in six weeks of JMG lessons. Students completed pre-and post- science knowledge tests, and pre-and post- science <b>attitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>life</b> skills surveys. Teachers completed surveys to evaluate their perceptions of JMG lessons and perceived impacts those lessons had on students? science learning <b>and</b> <b>attitudes,</b> <b>and</b> development of <b>life</b> skills. Results showed that students? science knowledge significantly increased {{as a result of}} their participation in JMG lessons. No change in attitude toward science was observed in the student data; however, data from teachers? surveys indicated that teachers perceived JMG lessons were important in stimulating students? desires to learn science and in increasing students? interests in science. No significant change in students? perceptions of life skills development was observed; data from teachers? surveys indicated they perceived JMG lessons were important in helping students develop life skills such as communications and leadership. The lack of significant change in students? science <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> <b>life</b> skills development may be attributed to low internal reliability scores for both scales. Many previous studies conducted in the U. S. indicate that participation in 4 -H, JMG, and other agricultural education activities facilitates changes in <b>attitudes</b> toward science <b>and</b> <b>life</b> skill development. Future studies should address instrument reliability issues to improve research in this field or rely more heavily on teacher evaluation of JMG programs since research suggests that adults are better able to assess changes in <b>attitudes</b> <b>and</b> skills than youth. Overall, this study suggests that there is great potential for the use of JMG programs in developing countries. Because of their impact on science education, science <b>attitude,</b> <b>and</b> <b>life</b> skills development, JMG programs should be accepted as viable tools for international development projects working toward a stronger, more educated, and more capable youth population in developing countries. Both science knowledge <b>and</b> <b>life</b> skills development are closely tied with economic prosperity and successful livelihoods so by giving youth these skills, JMG is preparing them for a better future. Before incorporating JMG into development projects, more time should be invested in adapting JMG lessons and activities to a rural Guatemalan context to maximize learning and ease of adoption...|$|R

Both monetary- and non-monetary-based organisational WLB provision had no direct association with employee well-being, but had indirect effects via individual coping strategies to help employees achieve better well-being.

Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis ("World <b>and</b> <b>Life</b> <b>Views,</b> Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature") (1910) examined the origins and development of a great many philosophical areas, including the broadest and most far-reaching examination of the theological theory of Pandeism written up to that point. A critique reviewing Weinstein's work in this field deemed Pandeism to be an 'unsightly' combination of Greek and Latin. The reviewer further criticises Weinstein's broad assertions that such historical philosophers as Scotus Erigena, Anselm of Canterbury, Nicholas of Cusa, Giordano Bruno, Mendelssohn, and Lessing all were Pandeists or leaned towards Pandeism.|$|R
