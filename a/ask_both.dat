25|$|The Associated Press {{will decline}} to {{interview}} Amber and Jameka {{if they are}} members of the Jury, {{due to the fact that}} they are not allowed to <b>ask</b> <b>both</b> contestants about Amber's comments. A CBS spokesperson reported that asking Amber or Jameka about Amber's comments could influence the jury voters and affect the integrity of the game.|$|E
25|$|Older {{cases had}} held {{that if a}} {{contract}} had already been performed, or a misrepresentation had become a term of the contract, this would preclude rescission. This inflexible position was amended by the Misrepresentation Act 1967 s 1, which simply says such bars no longer exist. However, it must still be remembered that one cannot <b>ask</b> <b>both</b> for rescission and for recovery of expectation damages for breach of contract.|$|E
25|$|The First or Dark World, , {{was small}} and {{centered}} on an island floating {{in the middle of}} four seas. The inhabitants of the first world were the four , the Coyotes, the four rulers of the four seas, mist beings and various insect and people, the latter being the Air-Spirit People. The supernatural beings First Woman and First Man came into existence here. Coyote sees First Man burning crystal which is a sign of life then Coyote sees First Woman burning turquoise which is a sign of death. Coyote then decides to <b>ask</b> <b>both</b> if they want to meet each other and both agreed. Then Coyote gathers both of them and met for the first time. The various beings started fighting with one another and departed by flying out an opening in the east.|$|E

2500|$|Fulton's funeral {{took place}} {{six days after}} his death. In tribute to his Scotch and Wry {{character}} Supercop (a police traffic officer), police motorcyclists escorted the funeral cortège as it {{made its way to}} Clydebank Crematorium. The Reverend Alastair Symington, who was a close friend of Fulton, led the service, which featured tributes from Fulton's widow Kate Matheson and Tony Roper. Symington had previously collaborated with Fulton on the book, For God's Sake, <b>Ask!.</b> <b>Both</b> Rikki and his Kate were strong supporters of the Scottish SPCA, which received a financial donation following Fulton's funeral. [...] A Scottish SPCA inspector represented the animal welfare organisation at the service.|$|E
2500|$|Clooney has {{advocated}} {{a resolution of}} the Darfur conflict. He spoke at a 2006 Save Darfur rally in Washington, D.C. In April 2006, he spent ten days in Chad and Sudan with his father to make the TV special [...] "A Journey to Darfur" [...] reflecting the situation of Darfur's refugees, and advocated for action. The documentary was broadcast on American cable TV {{as well as in the}} UK and France. In 2008, it was released on DVD with the sale proceeds being donated to the International Rescue Committee. In September of the same year, he spoke to the UN Security Council with Nobel Prize-winner Elie Wiesel to ask the UN to find a solution to the conflict and to help the people of Darfur. In December, he visited China and Egypt with Don Cheadle and two Olympic winners to <b>ask</b> <b>both</b> governments to pressure Sudan's government.|$|E
6000|$|... "That ends our business, then, for the present," [...] he said. [...] "Now I {{am going}} to <b>ask</b> <b>both</b> of you a favor. Perhaps I have no right to, but {{as a man of}} honor, Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge, you can take it from me that I ask it in your {{interests}} as well as my own. Don't tell the Count von Hern of my visit to you." ...|$|E

6000|$|I forget {{as many as}} I remember; and I <b>ask</b> <b>both</b> {{to pardon}} me, these for silence, those for {{inadequate}} speech. But one name I have kept on purpose to the last, {{because it is a}} household word with me, and because if I had not received favours from so many hands and in so many quarters of the world, it should have stood upon this page alone: that of my friend Thomas Bodley Scott of Bournemouth. Will he accept this, although shared among so many, for a dedication to himself? and when next my ill-fortune (which has thus its pleasant side) brings him hurrying to me when he would fain sit down to meat or lie down to rest, will he care to remember that he takes this trouble for one who is not fool enough to be ungrateful? ...|$|E
60|$|If this {{relation}} be accurate, {{then the}} foreign secretary did not construe strict neutrality as excluding what diplomatists call good offices. On October 13, Lord Russell circulated a memorandum {{to the cabinet}} setting out in an argumentative tone all the adverse and confused aspects {{of the situation and}} outlook in America, and ending in the emphatic conclusion that it had now become a question for the great Powers of Europe whether it was not their duty to <b>ask</b> <b>both</b> parties to agree to a suspension of arms for the purpose of weighing calmly the advantages of peace. Cornewall Lewis (Oct. 17), while expressing an opinion that a peaceful separation between North and South would in the end have been best for the North, and while apparently believing that the war must one day end in Southern independence, met Russell’s suggestion by cogent arguments against action on our part.(61) A week later (Oct. 24), Mr. Gladstone circulated a rejoinder to Lewis, arguing for representation to the two combatants from England, France, and Russia—a representation with moral authority and force, of the opinion of the civilised world upon the conditions of the case.|$|E

50|$|The game {{featured}} two three-member {{teams that}} were complete opposites (firemen/pyromaniacs). Proops would <b>ask</b> <b>both</b> teams questions about general topics {{as well as}} topics relating to the subject that divided the teams.|$|E
50|$|Four {{days after}} Álvarez's appointment, President Manuel Ávila Camacho, decided to <b>ask</b> <b>both</b> the rector and the rector ephemeral, Manuel Gual Vidal, {{appointed}} by the University Council, to resign, {{as they had been}} appointed a compromise board which would assume the government of the institution and restore the university organization.|$|E

50|$|Both the President and the Attorney General were {{concerned}} about King's ties to suspected Communists Jack O'Dell and Stanley Levison. After the President and his civil rights expert Harris Wofford pressed King to <b>ask</b> <b>both</b> men to resign from the SCLC, King agreed to ask only O'Dell to resign from the organization and allowed Levison, whom he regarded as a trusted advisor, to remain.|$|E

50|$|If a {{point has}} been awarded, then the {{competitors}} {{return to their}} en-garde lines; if not, they remain approximately where they were when the bout was interrupted. The referee will then restart the bout as before. If the fencers were within lunging distance when the bout was interrupted {{and they are not}} required to return to their en-garde lines, the referee will <b>ask</b> <b>both</b> fencers to give sufficient ground to ensure a fair start. A common way of establishing the correct distance is to <b>ask</b> <b>both</b> fencers to straighten their arms and to step back to the point where their blades no longer overlap in the referee's view. If a fencer needs to stop the bout to adjust his/her mask or tie his/her shoe, or something else requires the referee's attention, he/she may do so by tapping their back foot and/or waving their back hand and the referee will generally call a halt. Tapping the front foot is called an appel and is actually a tactical move, intended to distract the opposing fencer; thus, the referee may ignore a front-foot tap.|$|E
50|$|On 2 December 2015, the arbitral {{tribunal}} deciding {{on the border}} between Slovenia and Croatia <b>asked</b> <b>both</b> countries for additional submissions concerning Croatia's decision to unilaterally withdraw from arbitration and scheduled a hearing on 17 March 2016.|$|R
30|$|In {{developing}} these tools, it {{is important}} to keep in mind that multiple stressor assessment <b>asks</b> <b>both</b> for more understanding of the processes underlying stressor interactions and for more “ecological topping up” (see Sect. 10) of existing approaches.|$|R
50|$|A {{fill-in-the-blank}} {{question is}} <b>asked.</b> <b>Both</b> teams bet 5, 15, 30, {{or all of}} their points; if they answer the question correctly, they gain that number of points, but if their answer is incorrect, they lose that number of points.|$|R
50|$|The council {{unanimously}} appointed Manuel Gual as rector, who set out {{to perform}} the actions deemed necessary to resolve {{the crisis of the}} university. However, just four days later, the President decided to <b>ask</b> <b>both</b> the Rector and Joseph Aguilar Alvarez, appointed by the University Council, to resign, as they had been appointed a compromise board (the Board of exrectors) which would assume the government of the institution and restore the university organization.|$|E
50|$|In {{the latter}} meaning, {{the case in}} {{question}} cannot be decided through referring to and/or relying on precedent. Since the legal issue under consideration has never been decided by an appeals court and, therefore, there is no precedent for the court to follow, the court uses analogies from prior rulings by appeals courts, refers to commentaries and articles by legal scholars, and applies its own logic. In cases of first impression, the trial judge will often <b>ask</b> <b>both</b> sides' attorneys for legal briefs.|$|E
5000|$|On October 20, 2010, ODEBO {{decided to}} {{withdraw}} Panama City as host. ODEBO explained that Panama's Olympic Committee has actually two committees with two co-presidents in conflict, Miguel Vanegas and Miguel Sánchiz, one recognized by Panama's Supreme Court of Justice {{and the other}} one recognized by IOC. Ricardo Martinelli, Panama's president, commented: [...] "I'm going to kill both of them... I will publicly <b>ask</b> <b>both</b> of them to hand over their resignations for the good of this country and stop with their petty personal interests.|$|E

50|$|Finally in 2005, {{the champions}} from both {{national}} cups faced each other, Vitória de Setúbal and Real Betis.
