5|$|After {{receiving}} the punt, Boston College quarterback Matt Ryan connected on a 31-yard pass to wide receiver Brandon Robinson. As before, however, the offense stalled. On 4th-and-1 from the Virginia Tech 30-yard line, Ryan attempted a pass that fell incomplete, turning {{the ball over}} on downs. As a result of pressure <b>applied</b> <b>by</b> the Boston College defense, the Hokies continued to have difficulty moving the ball.|$|E
5|$|Another use {{concerns}} X-ray optics, especially X-ray telescopes. The mirrors of the Chandra X-ray Observatory are {{coated with}} a layer of iridium 60nm thick. Iridium proved to be the best choice for reflecting X-rays after nickel, gold, and platinum were also tested. The iridium layer, which had to be smooth to within a few atoms, was <b>applied</b> <b>by</b> depositing iridium vapor under high vacuum on a base layer of chromium.|$|E
5|$|As Taeniura meyeni, {{the round}} ribbontail ray was {{described}} by German biologists Johannes Peter Müller and Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle in their 1841 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen, based on two syntypes collected from Mauritius. However, this species is better known under the name Taeniura melanospila (or melanospilos), which was <b>applied</b> <b>by</b> Dutch ichthyologist Pieter Bleeker to a juvenile specimen from Java, in a 1953 volume of the scientific journal Natuurkundig Tijdschrift voor Nederlandsch Indië.|$|E

5|$|At his death, {{the role}} of the emperor as a patron of Eastern Orthodoxy was claimed by Ivan III, Grand duke of Muscovy. He had married Andreas' sister, Sophia Paleologue, whose grandson, Ivan IV, would become the first Tsar of Russia (tsar, or czar, meaning caesar, is a term {{traditionally}} <b>applied</b> <b>by</b> Slavs to the Byzantine Emperors). Their successors supported the idea that Moscow was the proper heir to Rome and Constantinople. The idea of the Russian Empire as the successive Third Rome was kept alive until its demise with the Russian Revolution.|$|E
5|$|Burst {{frequency}} offset (BFO) – The {{difference between the}} expected and received frequency of transmissions. The difference is caused by doppler shift as the signals travelled from the aircraft to the satellite to the ground station; the frequency translations made in the satellite and at the ground station; a small, constant error (bias) in the SDU that results from drift and ageing; and compensation <b>applied</b> <b>by</b> the SDU to counter the Doppler shift on the uplink. This measure can be analysed to determine where along the BTO rings the aircraft was located.|$|E

5|$|Ficus aurea, {{commonly}} known as the Florida strangler fig (or simply strangler fig), golden fig, or higuerón, is a tree in the family Moraceae that is native to the U.S. state of Florida, the northern and western Caribbean, southern Mexico and Central America south to Panama. The specific epithet aurea was <b>applied</b> <b>by</b> English botanist Thomas Nuttall who described the species in 1846.|$|E

5|$|Several {{species of}} entomopathogenic {{nematode}} are important predators of insect and other invertebrate pests. Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita is a microscopic nematode that kills slugs. Its complex life cycle includes a free-living, infective {{stage in the}} soil where it becomes associated with a pathogenic bacteria such as Moraxella osloensis. The nematode enters the slug through the posterior mantle region, thereafter feeding and reproducing inside, {{but it is the}} bacteria that kill the slug. The nematode is available commercially in Europe and is <b>applied</b> <b>by</b> watering onto moist soil.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Appeal {{also held}} that legal {{precedents}} from other Commonwealth jurisdictions supported {{a rejection of}} the subjective test in favour of the objective test. The subjective test was applied in Liversidge v. Anderson (1941) and subsequently affirmed in Greene v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs (1941). However, these decisions had been departed from in subsequent decisions by the Privy Council and House of Lords. These courts had rejected the subjective test <b>applied</b> <b>by</b> the majority in Liversidge, preferring the objective test <b>applied</b> <b>by</b> Lord Atkin in his dissenting judgment. In the light of these developments, the Malaysian case of Karam Singh v. Menteri Hal Ehwal Dalam Negeri (Minister for Home Affairs), Malaysia (1969), which had applied the test in Liversidge and which the respondents' counsel had relied on in support of the subjective test, could no longer be considered good law. Additionally, Teh Cheng Poh v. Public Prosecutor (1978) decided by the Privy Council on appeal from Malaysia, was referred to by the Court in support of the objective test. The case concerned the exercise of discretionary power under the Malaysian Internal Security Act, which the ISA of Singapore is derived from.|$|E
30|$|Scalability {{focuses on}} the general ability to process {{arbitrary}} workloads. A definition of scalability for distributed systems in general and with respect to DDBMSs is provided by Agrawal et al. [40], where the terms scale-up, scale-down, scale-out and scale-in are defined focusing on the management of growing workloads. Vertical as well as horizontal scaling techniques are applied to distributed DBMSs and can also be applied to DFSs. Vertical scaling <b>applies</b> <b>by</b> adding more computing resources to a single node. While horizontal scaling <b>applies</b> <b>by</b> adding nodes to a cluster (or in general to the instances of a certain application component).|$|R

5|$|The Moon {{may have}} {{dramatically}} affected {{the development of}} life by moderating the planet's climate. Paleontological evidence and computer simulations show that Earth's axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the Moon.

5|$|The {{director}} {{attempted to}} limit the use of digital effects.

5|$|The {{operation}} was criticised for its poor planning and execution, insufficient preparation, reconnaissance and training, and inappropriate {{command and control}} methods <b>applied</b> <b>by</b> the Sisak Operational Group {{in charge of the}} offensive.

Afterwards, Croatian military authorities investigated the offensive, but found that there was very little written documentation, including written unit-level orders, pertaining to the operation. That led Admiral Davor Domazet-Lošo to conclude that the offensive was not formally authorised. The formal investigation did not specifically charge anyone with the failures, simply specifying the problems observed instead.|$|E
