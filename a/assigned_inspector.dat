His whereabouts could not be discovered and Wood <b>assigned</b> <b>Inspector</b> Condon and Detective Manning to find him. In March 1927 a tip was received and Murnane was subpoenaed to appear. Wood instructed Nairn {{that he could not}} speak to Murnane before he testified, an instruction Nairn ignored when he intercepted him {{on the way to the}} court and briefed him while Wood waited. When Murnane testified, he confirmed the main points of the evidence of the white participants but differed on two points. Jolly had said that Murnane had taken part in a raid on a large encampment, Murnane said that he had not been on that raid and that Jolly was mistaken. The other point of difference was cited by Wood; Regan's patrol (and Murnane) had originally stated they first joined St Jack's patrol north of Nulla Nulla while St Jack and Overheu said they met at the homestead (where they met had an important bearing on the alleged killings by St Jack and Overheu before Regan's party joined them). Testifying before the commission, with the exception of Murnane who repeated his earlier statement, all the white members of the patrol now repeated St Jacks version. An angry Wood concluded this was due to Nairn only having 15 minutes to speak to Murnane before he testified and added him to the list of witnesses he believed were prepared to lie to the commission.|$|E

40|$|Inspection is a {{fundamental}} means of achieving software usability. Past research showed that the current usability inspection techniques were rather ine ective. We developed perspective-based usability inspection, which divides the large variety of usability issues along di erent perspectives and focuses each inspection session on one perspective.

The control group used heuristic evaluation, {{which is the most}} popular technique for usability inspection. The experimental design and the results are presented, which show that inspectors applying perspective-based inspection not only found more usability problems related to their assigned perspectives, but also found more overall problems.

" A single evader attempts to traverse a path between two vertices in a directed network while an interdictor, controlling inspectors of different types, attempts {{to detect the}} evader by <b>assigning</b> <b>inspectors</b> to edges in the network. Each edge has a known probability of detection if the evader traverses the edge when an inspector of a given type is present. The problem for the interdictor {{is to find a}} mixed inspector-to-edge assignment strategy that maximizes the average probability of detecting the evader, i. e., the "interdiction probability. " The problem for the evader is to find a mixed "path-selection strategy" that minimizes the interdiction probability. The problem is formulated as a two-person zero-sum game with a surrogate objective that evaluates expected number of detections. That model is solved with a "direct solution procedure" and a "marginal-probability solution procedure. " On numerous test problems, both procedures correctly compute expected number of detections, but the latter more often finds a solution that simultaneously optimizes interdiction probability. The latter procedure is also much faster and is therefore preferred. Turkish Army autho...|$|R
50|$|The Keating-Owen Child Labor Act of 1916 {{also known}} as Wick's Bill, was a {{short-lived}} statute enacted by the U.S. Congress which sought to address child labor by prohibiting the sale in interstate commerce of goods produced by factories that employed children under fourteen, mines that employed children younger than sixteen, and any facility where children under fourteen worked after 7:00 p.m. or before 6:00 a.m. or more than eight hours daily. The Bill was accepted after its first failure to be enacted, was revised and re-introduced.

To enforce the Act, the Secretary of Labor would <b>assign</b> <b>inspectors</b> to perform inspections of workplaces that produce goods for commerce.
