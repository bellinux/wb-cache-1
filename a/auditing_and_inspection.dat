30|$|The {{findings}} have strong policy implications for developing countries.

40|$|The use of {{performance}} <b>auditing</b> <b>and</b> <b>inspection</b> as tools of public services reform {{is a key}} feature of contemporary public management.

However significant differences have emerged between the local government performance assessment frameworks which now operate in England, Scotland and Wales. These reflect contrasting theories of improvement and differences in the relationships between central government, local authorities and audit bodies...|$|E

40|$|The paper commences by {{considering}} the wider policy context in which these reforms will rest. It is a policy context containing a number of countervailing challenges: a context where an undue focus on the Equality Bill’s reforms risks obscuring more pressing and present changes that could undermine the rights of carers to equal treatment. The paper briefly considers the scope for combining {{some of the new}} obligations on public bodies, created by the Bill, with other existing functions – for example the obligation to gather information for the Outcomes and Performance Characteristics framework and Equality Impact Assessments as part of a council’s <b>auditing</b> <b>and</b> <b>inspection</b> responsibilities in relation to the Care Quality Commission.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} a puzzle : how {{to account for}} changes in the routine behavior of groups, organizations and individuals in Britain ? Following a detailed analysis of state/market interdependence {{and the role of the}} state in creating the market, an analysis drawn from the thinking of Weber and Polanyi, we suggest adapting Weber’s notion of bureaucratic revolution : in what we call the British bureaucratic revolution, the state has played an essential role in social change by creating institutions and rules that are lastingly reorienting actors’ behavior. The example of the healthcare field is examined in order to identify the specific mechanisms that have been impacting on behavior within an approximately ten-year period; namely, the introduction of 1) competitive practices (sanction/reward) and 2) of <b>auditing</b> <b>and</b> <b>inspection.</b> If this interpretation is valid, then it is reasonable to assume that the effects of this bureaucratic revolution extend beyond Britain...|$|E

30|$|Informal {{employment}} {{presents an}} important policy problem in most developing countries {{as it has}} implications on social protection and access to safety nets for millions of individuals. Informality limits tax revenues {{and at the same}} time combating with informality requires effective inspection mechanisms and vast public resources. <b>Auditing</b> <b>and</b> <b>inspection</b> are usually inefficient and insufficient, failing to keep up with the growth of businesses in many developing countries. On the other hand, during processes of globalization and financial integration, the increase in consumer credits, use of credit cards, and access to other financial services might produce positive externalities on formal employment through the electronization of payment systems. While there is abundant research on the dynamics of informality and on the impact of financial liberalization on growth, this paper, to my knowledge, is the first one to explore the channels through which consumer credits and changing modes of finance can affect formal employment.|$|E
40|$|Special Issue: Road Trauma and InjuryWork {{health and}} safety (WHS) and road safety are {{distinctive}} perspectives of public health but they share much in common. Both have evolved from a former focus on individual responsibility to embracing systemwide, integrated approaches. Both now talk of incidents rather than accidents. Both are now characterised by proactive rather than reactive responses and their broad countermeasure approaches share many similarities. However, there are various aspects of WHS policy and practice that could be examined {{in relation to the}} road safety experience, particularly how compliance and deterrence approaches work best in WHS; the use of rewards and incentives; better attention to young worker safety; improved collection, analysis and usage of WHS data; and optimal use of WHS <b>auditing</b> <b>and</b> <b>inspection</b> programs. The aim of such examinations should be to gauge if current WHS policies and practices are appropriately balanced in light of the road safety experience.

40|$|There {{has already}} been much {{discussion}} and critique of the New Public Management, {{and the impact of}} <b>auditing</b> <b>and</b> <b>inspection</b> on professional work in schools, hospitals, local government and the police. This study, by a qualitative sociologist, uses interpretive methods to examine this new form of regulation from the inside. Based on interviews with inspectors, quality assurance managers, and auditors, as well as with professionals struggling with red tape, it offers a critical and insightful account of organisational change. The author includes vivid accounts of how quality assurance procedures and systems work in practice, conveying a sense of what is practically involved in the work of counting, measuring and managing quality, and the everyday frustrations of professionals dealing with ever-increasing amounts of paper work and red tape. This book should be essential reading for anyone concerned about the rise of this new bureaucracy and the contemporary state of the professions. It is intended to support courses on quality assurance and the New Public Management in public administration and management. It also provides an accessible introduction for students in socio-legal studies, sociology and social policy about the effects of neo-liberalism on public sector work...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal International Journal of Public Sector Managements and the definitive published version is available at [URL] – The {{purpose of this paper}} is to illustrate the back office efficiency savings made by English councils during the 2004 Spending Review (SR 04) period in order to consider the relationship between service delivery, <b>audit</b> <b>and</b> <b>inspection</b> <b>and,</b> efficiency programmes in local government. It considers three research questions: the use of secondary data, the relationship between efficiency savings and contextual factors, and the influence of <b>audit</b> <b>and</b> <b>inspection</b> in delivering efficient public services. Design/methodology/approach – Through statistical analysis the paper discusses the secondary analysis of publicly available sets of administrative data about local councils in England. These datasets are the annual efficiency statements (AES) taken from records made by each council. The paper discusses through the analysis of the AES the degree of efficiency savings and service improvements in English councils and whether efficiency savings are influenced by internal or external contextual factors. Findings – The paper illustrates that secondary data is a useful source of data, but finds that although councils have achieved the efficiency savings set there is no relationship with the contextual factors. The paper considers the influence of <b>audit</b> <b>and</b> <b>inspection,</b> suggesting that the focus has been on meeting the target rather than local needs. Originality/value – This paper aims to contribute to the debate regarding the use of performance indicators, <b>audit</b> <b>and</b> <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> efficiency achievement within local government. The paper starts to explore the implication in the UK where, after a decade of use, the influence of these is reducing dramatically...|$|R
