5|$|Grid {{computing}} is {{the most}} distributed form of parallel computing. It makes use of computers communicating over the Internet {{to work on a}} given problem.

Many distributed computing applications have been created, of which SETI@home and Folding@home are the best-known examples.|$|E

Microsoft later discontinued the Android bridge project in favor of continuing support for iOS application porting instead.|$|E

Other forum members quickly discovered keys for different titles. Keys for many discs are now readily <b>available</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>internet.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several reviewers have {{likened the}} album to a bootleg. Neither Wheeler nor Parallel World {{provided}} {{any information about}} the artists or names of the tracks. When re-issued in 2003, reviewer Mack Hagood criticized Parallel World for reifying its bootleg status by retaining the anonymous track list rather than working to look for surviving artists or their families, who would likely benefit greatly from royalties. With information more widely <b>available</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> {{and the opportunity to}} collaborate, all tracks have since been identified.|$|E

5|$|In March 2006, Mills and McCartney {{travelled}} to Canada {{to bring}} attention to the country's annual seal hunt. Sponsored by the Humane Society of the United States, they complained that the hunt was inhumane, and called on the Canadian government {{to put an end}} to it. Their arrival on the floes sparked much attention in Newfoundland and Labrador, where 90 per cent of the sealers live. Mills and McCartney protested against seals being clubbed to death, pierced with boat hooks and sometimes skinned alive. Newfoundland and Labrador's Premier, Danny Williams, debated the issue with them on Larry King Live, the issue being that seals are no longer hunted that way, and have not been for a while. Mills joined a Viva! film team at a pig farm in Somerset, in February 2007, to publicise the use of restrictive farrowing crates, which are used for sows who are suckling piglets. A video of the investigation was made <b>available</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet.</b>|$|E

5|$|There was an {{apparent}} misconception among video game fans that the SNES title Secret of Evermore {{was released in}} lieu of an English language version of Seiken Densetsu 3 in 1995. Secret of Evermore was developed by a new team at Square's office in Redmond, Washington called Square Soft. According to Fehdrau, no one {{who worked on the}} Evermore project would have been involved in a translation of Seiken Densetsu 3; the Redmond team was specifically hired to create Evermore. In 2000, a fan translation project for Seiken Densetsu 3 led by Neill Corlett was successfully completed and made <b>available</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>internet</b> as an unofficial patch, which could be applied to ROMs of the game when played with an emulator or played on a Super NES console with a development kit or backup device. A port for the Nintendo Switch was released with ports of Final Fantasy Adventure and Secret of Mana as part of the Seiken Densetsu Collection on June 1, 2017.|$|E

5|$|In India, the Hindi {{version of}} Ra.One was {{released}} across more than 4,000 plus screens worldwide- 3,100 screens in 2,100 theatres, breaking {{the record for}} the widest Bollywood release previously held by Bodyguard (2011). The Tamil and Telugu versions were released on 275 prints and 125 prints respectively. A week before the release, multiplex owners throughout India decided to allot 95% of the total available screen space to the film. Overseas, Ra.One was released in 904 prints. This including 600 prints in Germany, 344 prints in the USA, 200–300 prints in South Korea, 202 prints in the UK, 79 prints in the Middle East, 75 prints in Russia, 51 prints in Australia, 49 prints in Canada and 25 prints in New Zealand and Taiwan. In early October 2011, a partnership deal was being finalised by the distributors to allow the film to be released in China across 1,000 prints. In addition, the film was released in Pakistan and non-traditional territories like Brazil, Spain, Italy, Greece and Hong Kong. The 3D version was released in 550 screens across the world. Ra.One was noted for the extensive use of digital prints, reportedly making up 50–60% of the total release; in India, the film was exhibited in over 1,300 digital theatres, breaking the record previously held by Bodyguard. The wide digital release was implemented to lower distribution costs, make the film accessible to a wider audience and reduce piracy. However, despite the measures taken, pirated versions of Ra.One were <b>available</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> within hours of the film's release.|$|E
