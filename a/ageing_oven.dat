Laboratory flexural test {{was conducted on}} the beam specimens of plain asphalt mixtures and rubber-modified asphalt mixtures. Experiment results indicate that rubber-modified asphalt mixtures have superior low-temperature anti-cracking performance than that of plain asphalt mixtures. Compared with the short term <b>oven</b> <b>aging</b> test, the long term <b>oven</b> <b>aging</b> test has more significant effect on the low-temperature anti-cracking of the mixture.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the mechanical properties of different classifications of composites indicated for posterior application as {{functions of the}} storage condition and of the energy dose. Material and Methods: Specimens (8 x 2 x 2 mm) were obtained according to the factors: I) Composites (3 M ESPE) : Filtek P 60, Filtek Z 350 XT, and Filtek Silorane; II) Syringe storage conditions: room temperature, <b>aged,</b> <b>oven,</b> refrigerator, and freezer; and III) Energy dose: 24 J/cm 2 and 48 J/cm 2. After photoactivation, the specimens were stored at 37 ºC for 24 h. After storage, a three-point bending test {{was carried out in}} a universal testing machine at 0. 5 mm/min. Flexural strength (S) and flexural modulus (E) were calculated. Data were analyzed by three-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (α= 0. 05). Results: Different storage conditions significantly affected the silorane composite for S; conversely, no effects were noted in terms of E. The accelerated aging protocol significantly increased the S of Filtek P 60 and Filtek Silorane, whereas storage in the oven significantly decreased the S for all of the composites tested. Filtek P 60 was the only composite not affected by the lower storage temperatures tested for S, whereas for the silorane this parameter was impacted at the same conditions. The factor "dose" was not statistically significant. Conclusions: The syringe storage at different temperature conditions proved to influence mostly the flexural strength, a clinically important characteristic considering the posterior indication of the materials tested. The silorane composite should not be stored at lower temperatures...|$|R
40|$|Oxidative {{degradation}} is {{a serious}} threat to long-term use and recyclability of polymers. Successful recycling of polymeric quality products requires characterization of the polymer material after reprocessing and use. Lately, a growing awareness of the heterogeneous nature of degradation has developed in terms of physical spreading, non-uniform distribution of stabilizer, physical loss of stabilizer etc. In this thesis the issues of heterogeneous degradation and recyclability of PP are addressed mainly using imaging chemiluminescence (ICL) technique. An extensive test program was carried out on PP subjected to simulated recycling in terms of combined (re) processing and <b>oven</b> <b>ageing</b> or alternatively to repeated reprocessing steps or continuous <b>oven</b> <b>ageing.</b> For this study an ICL instrument with improved performance was developed including a multi-cell specimen chamber with up to 23 cells with excellent control of temperature and gas flow in the cells and a high sensitivity for low-mass specimens. Comparative studies with microcalorimetry (MC) showed good agreement between CL intensity-time and heat flow-time curves during oxidation of PP. From ICL images, oxidation induction time (OIT) and total luminous intensity (TLI) data as well as from data of other techniques like elongation at break, yellowness index and melt viscosity a number of conclusions were made: The total oven lifetime was reduced if <b>oven</b> <b>ageing</b> included an intermediate reprocessing step. A commercial stabilization system based on a low-molar mass phenolic antioxidant was inadequate for recycling due to loss by evaporation, while an antioxidant with twice the molar mass showed satisfactory performance. The effect of upgrading PP during reprocessing with virgin PP was small, while addition of extra stabilizer prolonged the oven lifetime. In mapping the heterogeneity of the degradation of PP plaques pronounced edge oxidation was discovered and explained by antioxidant loss by evaporation. Simultaneous ICL and oxygen uptake experiments showed matching OITs and supported the opinion that luminescence and oxygen uptake reflect the oxidizing area rather than the oxidation kinetics...|$|R
40|$|We {{have been}} working for many years to develop {{improved}} methods for predicting the lifetimes of polymers exposed to air environments and have recently turned our attention to seal materials. This paper describes an extensive study on a butyl material using elevated temperature compression stress-relaxation (CSR) techniques in combination with conventional <b>oven</b> <b>aging</b> exposures. The results initially indicated important synergistic effects when mechanical strain is combined with <b>oven</b> <b>aging,</b> as well as complex, non-Arrhenius behavior of the CSR results. By combining modeling and experiments, we show that diffusion-limited oxidation (DLO) anomalies dominate traditional CSR experiments. A new CSR approach allows us to eliminate DLO effects and recover Arrhenius behavior. Furthermore, the resulting CSR activation energy (E{sub a}) from 125 C to 70 C is identical to the activation energies for the tensile elongation and for the oxygen consumption rate of unstrained material over similar temperature ranges. This strongly suggests that the same underlying oxidation reactions determine both the unstrained and strained degradation rates. We therefore utilize our ultrasensitive oxygen consumption rate approach down to 23 C to show that the CSR E{sub a} likely remains unchanged when extrapolated below 70 C, allowing very confident room temperature lifetime predictions for the butyl seal...|$|R

40|$|Because of {{the need}} to {{significantly}} extend the lifetimes of weapons, and because of potential implications of environmental O-ring failure on degradation of critical internal weapon components, the authors have been working on improved methods of predicting and verifying O-ring lifetimes. In this report, they highlight the successful testing of a new predictive method for deriving more confident lifetime extrapolations. This method involves ultrasensitive oxygen consumption measurements. The material studied is an EPDM formulation use for the environmental O-ring the W 88. Conventional <b>oven</b> <b>aging</b> (155 C to 111 C) was done on compression molded sheet material; periodically, samples were removed from the ovens and subjected to various measurements, including ultimate tensile elongation, density and modulus profiles. Compression stress relaxation (CSR) measurements were made at 125 C and 111 C on disc shaped samples (12. 7 mm diameter by 6 mm thick) using a Shawbury Wallace Compression Stress Relaxometer MK 2. Oxygen consumption measurements were made versus time, at temperatures ranging from 160 C to 52 C, using chromatographic quantification of the change in oxygen content caused by reaction with the EPDM material in sealed containers...|$|R
40|$|The {{interest}} in biodegradable polymers has increased {{because of their}} environmental advantages. Blending them with other polymers {{is one of the}} techniques currently employed to overcome their brittleness, poor processing and cost. This work evaluated different blend compositions of PHB/PP, using a pro-degrading additive for this latter, to make the formulation prone to oxo-biodegradability in simulated soil (ASTM D 6003). The mechanical, thermal and chemical behavior of buried injection molded tensile bars was monitored through measurements of tensile strength, DSC, FTIR, GPC and SEM. Part of the samples was <b>oven</b> <b>aged</b> at 90 ̈C for 10 days in order to accelerate the PP oxidation by the additive. The blend made of 56 wt% of PP / 40 wt% of PHB / 3 wt% of GMA / 1 wt% of MnSt was the most susceptible to oxo-biodegradation, having reduced after 180 days of burring in soil, its tensile stress by 40 %, tensile elongation by 46 % and mass by 24 %. These values were even higher than the ones for the pure PHB. This synergic effect was attributed to the acceleration of PHB degradation by the oxidized PP...|$|R
40|$|Usage {{of fresh}} bitumen and {{aggregates}} in pavement construction and rehabilitation can be minimised by utilising reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP). RAP {{is a waste}} material generated from old or damaged pavement surface. Although it has been practiced since 1970 s and several suggestions on the usage of RAP in the new mixture have been introduced, there is {{a limited number of}} research has been found, discussing on the issue of second recycling of RAP (R 2 AP). Pavement made with RAP will reach the end of service life and {{there is a need to}} recycle again. This study focused on investigating the performance of mixtures incorporating RAP and R 2 AP. It was carried out in three phases. In the first phase, three ageing procedures consisted of eight laboratory ageing methods were conducted to select suitable method that produced most severe ageing effect. Ageing methods used were combination of rolling thin film <b>oven</b> (RTFO), pressure <b>aging</b> vessel (PAV), short term <b>oven</b> <b>ageing</b> (STOA) and long term <b>oven</b> <b>ageing</b> (LTOA). In the second phase, mixture tests were conducted to evaluate the performance of asphaltic concrete with 14 mm nominal maximum aggregate size (AC 14) mixture incorporating RAP and R 2 AP. Final phase involved the physical, rheological and chemical property tests of aged bitumen. Penetration, softening point, viscosity, dynamic shear, elemental analysis and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) tests were performed on the bitumen which were extracted from the selected mixtures. Three mixtures consisted of 20, 40 and 60 % RAP were evaluated in the first cycle and four mixtures consisted of 20, 40, 60 and 80 % R 2 AP were evaluated in the second cycle. Results show that seven days of LTOA is the most suitable ageing method for AC 14. Mixture consisted of 40 % RAP shows a better performance when it was mixed with 80 - 100 PEN (B 1) bitumen whereas mixture with 60 % RAP performed better with 60 - 70 PEN (B 2) bitumen compared to other mixtures. After seven days of LTOA, mixture consisted of 40 % R 2 AP mixed with B 1 and 40 % R 2 AP mixed with B 2 show better performance compared to other recycled mixtures. Physical, rheological and chemical analyses of the extracted bitumen also indicated that there were acceptable differences between first and second cycle. Hence, it is proven that R 2 AP is suitable to be used as an alternative material to minimise the usage of fresh bitumen and aggregates. Based on regression model of aged bitumen properties, it can be concluded that RAP was suitable to be recycled up to second time...|$|R
30|$|First, {{the core}} samples were cleaned in the Soxhlet {{apparatus}} using methanol and toluene as the solvents. Then, the cores were dried {{in the oven}} at 110  °C for 12  h. The dimensions and weight of the core were measured, and then, the cores were saturated by the brine using evacuation system. To be sure about the complete saturation of the cores with the brine, they were flooded in the core-flooding apparatus (Fig.  1). Having established the steady-state flow rate in the core, the absolute permeability of the core was calculated using Darcy law (Amyx et al. 1988). The porosity of each core was calculated by comparing the weight of dry and saturated core. The connate water in the rock was established by flooding the core by the crude oil. The flooding was performed {{to the point that}} no brine was observed in the outlet and it was continued with the oil volume of four times of core pore volume. Then, the core samples were <b>aged</b> in the <b>oven</b> at 75  °C for 2 weeks (the aged time was measured and optimized using contact angle measurement) to achieve the mixed-wet wettability condition, so that the pores occupied by the connate water remain water-wet, while the oil-saturated pores become oil-wet.|$|R
40|$|This work aims to {{understand}} the mechanism of the thermal degradation of the ethylene-carbon monoxide (E-CO) alternating copolymer under mild conditions. The copolymer was subjected to accelerated <b>ageing</b> in an <b>oven</b> at different temperatures below the copolymer melting point, under argon atmosphere, {{and in the absence}} of light. The properties of the aged samples were compared with the properties of the untreated copolymer. Untreated and aged samples were analysed by mass spectroscopy (MS) with the direct introduction probe (DIP) and pyrolysis (Py) techniques. The accelerated ageing experiments showed that the thermal degradation of the E-CO alternating copolymer under inert atmosphere is characterized by chain cross-linking, loss of water, and changes in the UV absorption spectrum. The IR spectrum shows modifications only for highly degraded samples in which O-H and C=C groups are present. The experiments performed with the DIP-MS technique have confirmed that the E-CO alternating copolymer loses water during its thermal ageing. The pyrolysis products of the copolymer are linear molecules with 1, 4 -diketonic structure, 2 -cyclopentenone derivatives, alkyl furans, and aromatic compounds. These results suggest that during the thermal degradation of the E-CO alternating copolymer under inert atmosphere, and at low temperatures, aldol condensations and/or dehydration to furan rings probably occur...|$|R
