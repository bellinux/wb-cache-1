5|$|In 1932 {{the line}} to Upminster was {{electrified}} and new vehicles were purchased. After the District Railway became part of London Underground, similar cars were ordered to allow the Metropolitan line be extended to Barking and replace some of the rapidly deteriorating original wooden trailers. The 1935–40 New Works Programme fitted electro-pneumatic brakes and <b>air-operated</b> doors {{to most of the}} District line stock and allowed the remaining wooden cars to be scrapped. A number of motor cars were not suitable for conversion and so some trains retained their hand-worked doors and these ran until 1957.|$|E
25|$|An {{airbrush}} is a small, <b>air-operated</b> {{tool that}} sprays various media, most often paint but also ink and dye, and foundation {{by a process}} of nebulization. Spray painting developed from the airbrush and is considered to employ a type of airbrush.|$|E

Spray guns developed from the airbrush and are still considered a type of airbrush. The first airbrush was invented in 1876 by Francis Edgar Stanley of Newton, Massachusetts.|$|E
25|$|In 1932, some {{carriages}} {{built for}} the Piccadilly line by Cammell Laird in Nottingham in 1919 were transferred to the Bakerloo line. When built, these {{had been the first}} Tube trains to have <b>air-operated</b> doors. These were later replaced by more trains of Standard Stock, in turn being replaced by 1938 stock and 1949 stock.|$|E
25|$|In 1925–28 {{the trains}} were reconstructed, {{replacing}} the gated ends with <b>air-operated</b> doors, allowing {{the number of}} guards to be reduced to two. After reconstruction of the Central London Railway tunnels, the trains were replaced by Standard Stock and {{the last of the}} original trains ran in service in 1939. Subsequently a number of motor cars were rebuilt as sleet locomotives.|$|E
25|$|Lagos {{has many}} {{hospitals}} and medical facilities, {{some of which}} have accomplished feats in Nigeria's medical history. For example, the oldest Nigerian hospital is located in the city as well as West Africa's first <b>air-operated</b> emergency medical service which commenced in the city. The Lagos healthcare system is generally divided into public and private sectors which provide medical services at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels. Although the private hospitals are usually more expensive, it does not necessarily translate to better healthcare delivery.|$|E
25|$|During {{the eighties}} it was {{apparent}} that additional trains would be needed. BREL built nine 450 Class sets on former Mk 1 underframes between 1985 and 1987. The power cars had an English Electric 4SRKT engine recovered from former 70 Class units (except 457, which uses the engine recovered from 80 Class power car 88) and had two English Electric 538 traction motors. The sets were three-car diesel-electric multiple units, based on a more modern British design, with <b>air-operated</b> sliding doors. They were withdrawn from service in 2012 and replaced by new 4000 Class diesel multiple units.|$|E
25|$|To operate {{services}} {{north of}} Queen's Park, 72 additional cars were {{built by the}} Metropolitan Carriage, Waggon and Finance Company of Birmingham. These trains, known as the Watford Joint Stock, were partly owned by the Underground and partly by the London and North Western Railway (later London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS)). They were initially painted in LNWR livery. They were not equipped with <b>air-operated</b> doors and proved slow and unreliable, so they were replaced by new trains of Standard Stock in 1930 (although a few were retained by the LMS). For some years in the 1930s Watford trains had a distinctive blue stripe at window level.|$|E
25|$|These are four- and six-car sets {{based at}} Makuhari Depot {{modified}} in 2009 from former Keihin-Tōhoku Line 209-0 series ten-car sets {{for use on}} Chiba area and Bōsō Peninsula local services from 1 October 2009. The first four-car set was outshopped from Nagano Works in June 2009. Modifications include new electrical equipment, the addition of transverse seating, LED destination indicator panels, and a toilet. The cars are numbered in the -2100 series, although some four-car sets have end cars numbered in the -2000 series. The -2000 series cars are converted from early batch 209-0 series units with <b>air-operated</b> doors rather than the electrically-operated doors of later batch units.|$|E
25|$|The narrow carbody {{provides}} for a catwalk along each side between the cabs, with fold back body panels for maintenance access. The cab {{is similar to that}} of the contemporary G class, with an anti-climber beam to prevent upward movement should a collision occur. Twin high impact windscreens are provided, with dual blade wipers. Each cab has room for a two-person crew, as well as an instructor if required. Air conditioning is provided, as well as an <b>air-operated</b> retention toilet at one end accessible from the catwalk. The locos were initially provided with automatic staff exchange equipment, but this was removed in the 1990s when the use of Electric Staff ended. The space remains in the cab side today.|$|E
25|$|On 1 July 1933 the District Railway amalgamated {{with other}} Underground railways, tramway {{companies}} and bus operators {{to form the}} London Passenger Transport Board, and from 23 October 1933 Piccadilly line trains ran through to Uxbridge and the District line shuttle withdrawn. Most of the trailer cars on the District line were the 1904–05 B Stock type with wooden bodies, but motor cars were less than fifteen years old. The 1935–40 New Works Programme saw the Q Stock formed from these motor cars, upgraded with electro-pneumatic brakes and guard controlled <b>air-operated</b> doors, and the trailers replaced with new vehicles. The off-peak District line services on the Hounslow branch were withdrawn on 29 April 1935 and South Acton served by a shuttle to Acton Town.|$|E
25|$|After the war new trains were {{purchased}} {{to run on}} the Metropolitan, District, Bakerloo and Piccadilly lines, the Piccadilly line trains having <b>air-operated</b> sliding doors. In the 1920s, taking advantage of government backed financial guarantees for capital projects that promoted employment, there were major extensions of the City & South London and the Hampstead lines. The tunnels of the City & South London Railway were rebuilt {{to have the same}} diameter of the other tubes, and the extended north from Euston to a junction with the Hampstead line at Camden Town, and south to Morden. The Hampstead line was extended to the north from Golders Green to Edgware and south to another junction with the City & South London at Kennington, this opening in 1926. Although physically connected, the lines were still officially named the City Railway and Hampstead & Highgate line. The lines were {{to be known as the}} Edgware, Highgate and Morden and the Morden-Edgware until finally renamed the Northern line in 1937. Also during the 1920s the original tube gate stock was replaced with 1,460 cars of Standard Stock with air-operating sliding doors, except for the Central line where the cars were refurbished. Busy central London stations were modernised with escalators replacing lifts.|$|E
25|$|When {{the railway}} opened in 1900, it was {{operated}} by electric locomotives hauling carriages with passengers boarding via lattice gates at each end. The locomotives {{had a large}} unsprung mass, which caused vibrations that could be felt in the buildings above the route. After {{an investigation by the}} Board of Trade, by 1903 the carriages had been adapted to run as trailers and formed with new motor cars into electric multiple units. The Central London Railway trains normally ran with six cars, four trailers and two motor-cars, although some trailers were later equipped with control equipment to allow trains to be formed with 3 cars. Work started in 1912 on an extension to Ealing Broadway, and new more powerful motor-cars were ordered. These arrived in 1915, but completion of the extension was delayed due to the outbreak of World War I, and the cars stored. In 1917 they were lent to the Bakerloo line, where they ran on the newly opened extension to Watford Junction. Returning in 1920/21 and formed with trailers converted from the original carriages they became the Ealing Stock. In 1925–28 the trains were rebuilt, replacing the gated ends with <b>air-operated</b> doors, allowing the number of guards to be reduced to two. After reconstruction of the Central London Railway tunnels, the trains were replaced by Standard Stock transferred from other lines and the last of the original trains ran in service in 1939.|$|E
25|$|When the Subway first opened, single-carriage four axle (twin truck) trains were operated. Late in {{the evening}} on the opening day, after 11pm, one car laden with 60 {{passengers}} was run into by another under the River Clyde. Four people were injured, one being taken to the infirmary. This entailed {{the closure of the}} Subway until 19 January 1897. The 20 original wooden bodied carriages were built by the Oldbury Railway Carriage and Wagon Company, of Oldbury, Worcestershire. Many continued in service until 1977 in an upgraded form. A further 10 were delivered by the same manufacturer in 1897. From 1898, second four axle (trailer) carriages without a cable gripper mechanism were added, though they were considerably shorter than the front (gripper) carriage. These additional carriages, eventually numbering 30, were built by Hurst Nelson & Company, Motherwell, Lanarkshire. These carriages were soon expanded to match the length of the front carriages, although carriage 41T has been restored to its original length and cut longitudinally and number 39T is preserved in the Riverside Museum. Carriage 41T was on display at Buchanan Street subway station but was removed with the latest round of station modernisations. Enquiries with station staff on 27 September 2017 reveal that the removal was conducted {{in the middle of the}} night at the end of 2015 or the start of 2016. The removal sparked protests. Its location is currently unknown. Most of the gripper carriages were subsequently converted to electric traction in 1935. All carriages were originally built with lattice gates (instead of doors) at the ends; many were converted to <b>air-operated</b> sliding doors in the 1960s, but a few retained the gates until 1977.|$|E
2500|$|XENT-AM: Operated by Norman G. Baker from 1933 until forced {{off the air}} in 1940; [...] "The Calliaphone Station" [...] (for an <b>air-operated</b> calliope {{invented by}} Baker) {{promoted}} a cancer-cure clinic of Baker's, essentially continuing his former station KTNT ("Know The Naked Truth") of Muscatine, Iowa, as was itself forced off the air in 1931. Brochures for the clinic urged patients to [...] "phone 666 upon arrival in Laredo," [...] attracting many complaints to the American Medical Association as invoked reference to Revelation 13:18, citing 666 as the Mark of the Beast. When the original XENT was dismantled, the callsign was assigned to a new and unrelated station at La Paz, Baja California Sur.|$|E
2500|$|The twelve aluminium-bodied {{motor cars}} were ordered from Cravens in 1958, and each was {{equipped}} with four traction motors, instead of the two which previous stock had used. They were controlled by a Pneumatic Camshaft Motor (PCM) controller, where an <b>air-operated</b> camshaft controlled the switching of the motors, which was itself governed by an accelerating relay. This system had proved reliable in the control of two motors. In order for it to control four, without a major re-design, pairs of motors were wired together in series, and the controller switched between all four motors operating in series, and the two pairs operating in parallel. In order to protect against wheel-spin, the contoller automatically reset if one motor of a pair began to run faster than the other. Whereas previous bogies had been asymmetric, to ensure that more weight was carried by the axle driven by the motor, the pivot was central as every axle carried a motor. One further innovation was that the fully automatic couplers at the outer ends of the trains were not [...] "handed". Previously, trains were designated with 'A' and 'D' ends, and could only be coupled together by joining an 'A' end of one train to a 'D' end of another. This could cause operational problems, particularly on a line such as the Central, where operating a train right round the Hainualt loop resulted in it facing the wrong way. The 1960 stock avoided this problem by duplicating most of the connections in the automatic coupler, so that trains could be joined either way round. The cars also included a flat floor for the first time, rather than having a raised section over the motor bogies.(previous stock from 1935 to 1962 had flat floors at the centre section only, with a rising transition in the two double doorways to a steeply curved floor 4 inches higher at either end over the bogies).|$|E
50|$|In 1921 new trains were {{introduced}} on the Underground's Piccadilly line with <b>air-operated</b> sliding doors. Between 1923 and 1934 Standard stock with <b>air-operated</b> doors replaced gate stock on London's deep-level tube railways, improving {{access to the}} cars so reducing boarding times.|$|E

50|$|In London, the {{formation}} of the London Passenger Transport Board in 1933 was followed by the 1935-40 New Works Programme. For sub-surface lines this involved an investment in rolling stock. For the new Metropolitan line the T Stock standardised the newer compartment stock Metropolitan EMUs; older wooden-bodied stock, with hand operated sliding doors, was replaced by new O Stock and P Stock. These had <b>air-operated</b> sliding doors and used a new Metadyne control system and electric braking. In 1938 Q Stock was built by replacing the District line EMU wooden trailers with new steel ones and equipping the trains with <b>air-operated</b> sliding doors and electro-pneumatic brakes. Also in 1938 the tube standard stock was replaced by 1,121 new cars of 1938 Stock with the control equipment under the car floor, thus giving 14% more capacity.|$|E
