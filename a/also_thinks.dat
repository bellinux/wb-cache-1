5|$|Mel {{tries to}} return to Tlanth, with Debegri, Shevraeth and (ostensibly) his cousin the Duke of Savona in pursuit. Along the way people of the {{countryside}} assist her, but Debegri eventually captures Mel, furious about the months of trouble she caused. Taken to Debegri's nearby fortress, Shevraeth unexpectedly frees her and takes her to Renselaeus where she finds Bran. Shevraeth and his father reveal {{that they had been}} secretly fighting Galdran for years, wish to form an alliance with the Astiars, and plan for Shevraeth to take the throne. However, Mel refuses their help still deeply distrustful of Shevraeth and thinking of the promise made by Bran herself to their father: to become Remalna's rulers. Mel <b>also</b> <b>thinks</b> of Shevraeth as insincere, having been taught by her father to distrust of anyone who resides at court.|$|E
5|$|Former British {{soldier and}} writer Ken Wharton {{published}} {{in his book}} Wasted Years, Wasted Lives, Volume 1, an alternative theory that was suggested to him by loyalist paramilitarism researcher Jeanne Griffin; this was that the ambush was planned by Robin Jackson as an elaborate means of eliminating trumpet player Brian McCoy. Griffin suggests that McCoy, who originally came from Caledon, County Tyrone and had strong UDR and Orange Order family connections, was possibly approached at some stage by Jackson {{with a view of}} securing his help in carrying out UVF attacks in the Irish Republic. When McCoy refused, Jackson then hatched his plan to murder McCoy and his bandmates in retaliation, even macabrely choosing Buskhill as the ambush site due to its similarity to Bus-kill. Griffin goes on to add that the bogus checkpoint was set up not only to plant the bomb on board the van but to ensure the presence of McCoy which would have been confirmed when he handed over his driver's license to the gunmen. She <b>also</b> <b>thinks</b> that had everything gone to plan once the bomb was planted in the van McCoy would have been instructed to drive through Newry where the bomb would have gone off and the UVF could then afterwards portray the Miami Showband as IRA members on a mission to blow up the local RUC barracks. Griffin based her theory on the nine bullets that were fired from a Luger into McCoy's body and that Jackson's fingerprints were found on the silencer used for a Luger. She furthermore opined that Jackson was the man Travers saw kicking McCoy's body {{to make sure he was}} dead.|$|E
25|$|Selby {{tries to}} pass himself {{off as a}} classy and {{polished}} young man, considered by Mrs. Warbucks as a genius with a talent for the piano. She <b>also</b> <b>thinks</b> that he is absolutely perfect, {{and is one of}} those who wants everything just so.|$|E

25|$|According to Bronkhorst, this {{indicates}} that the four truths were later added to earlier descriptions of liberation by practicing the four dhyanas, which originally {{was thought to be}} sufficient for the destruction of the arsavas. Anderson, following Norman, <b>also</b> <b>thinks</b> that the four truths originally were not part of this sutta, and were later added in some versions.|$|E
25|$|Diodorus {{states that}} the Khufu pyramid was beautifully covered in white, but the top {{was said to be}} capped. The pyramid {{therefore}} already had no pyramidion anymore. He <b>also</b> <b>thinks</b> that the pyramid was built with ramps, which were removed during the finishing of the lime stone shell. Diodorus estimates that the total number of workers was 300.000 and that the building works lasted for 20 years.|$|E
25|$|Khan {{is known}} for his {{trademark}} shoot up, but performed poorly in this event. In the Colombo SAF Games, two of his shoot up scores were under ten with a highest of 10.7 where he used to reach 10.8 three to four times. About his poor shoot up performances he said,"I don't quite enjoy it these days. A fear works in my mind. He <b>also</b> <b>thinks</b> the pressure of expectation may be the reason for this and expect to overcome this soon.|$|E

25|$|Also {{referred}} to as Natasha. Natasha is a seventeen-year-old daughter of Dar’ya Mikhailovna. She is observant, well-read and intelligent, but also quite secretive. While her mother thinks {{of her as a}} good-natured and well-mannered girl, she is not of a high opinion about her intelligence, and quite wrongly. She <b>also</b> <b>thinks</b> Natasha is ‘cold’, emotionless, but in the beginning of Chapter Five we are told by the narrator that “Her feelings were strong and deep, but reserved; even as a child she seldom cried, and now she seldom even sighed and only grew slightly pale when anything distressed her.” She engages in intellectual conversations with Rudin (which are not discouraged by her mother because she thinks that these conversations “improve her mind”); Natasha thinks highly of Rudin, who confides to her his ideas and “privately gives her books”, and soon falls in love with him. She also often compels him to apply his talents and act. Natasha is often thought of as the first of 'Turgenev maids' to feature in Turgenev's fiction.|$|E
500|$|Zell was {{designed}} to look and act like the main character of a shōnen manga (Japanese comic books intended primarily for boys); his neighbors in Balamb describe him as a [...] "'comic-bookish' type of hero". He <b>also</b> <b>thinks</b> of himself as Seifer's rival, despite not being the main character. The inspiration for the tattoo on his face came from an MTV music video that featured {{a man with a}} full body tattoo.|$|E
500|$|The {{instrumental}} demos {{were primarily}} written in majorchords, which Byrne considered slightly [...] "ominous" [...] and surprising from Eno. In spite of this, Byrne's lyrics {{ended up being}} hopeful and spiritual, with themes of redemption—what he considers [...] "optimism {{in spite of the}} dread." [...] The tension between optimism and pessimism and the spiritual themes quickly emerged {{over the course of a}} year in which Byrne was writing lyrics, which he has speculated might be an antidote to being [...] "completely pessimistic and cynical about politics and the state of the world;" [...] for instance, [...] "TheRiver" [...] is about the effects of HurricaneKatrina. He has also cited the political climate of the IraqWar, the beginning of the late-2000s recession, the policies of the GeorgeW.Bush administration, and his 2004 divorce from AdelleLutz as factors that inspired him to create uplifting music. As he explained, [...] "I was surprised that's what came out... The tracks are very different from what I would have done myself. I lean toward things that are more complicated." [...] Eno <b>also</b> <b>thinks</b> the album is much better than the songs he imagined when composing them solo.|$|E

2500|$|Filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock was {{a friend}} of Addams, and owned two pieces of {{original}} Addams art. Hitchcock references Addams in his 1959 film, North by Northwest. During the auction scene, Cary Grant discovers two of his adversaries with someone whom he <b>also</b> <b>thinks</b> is against him and says: [...] "The three of you together. Now that's a picture only Charles Addams could draw." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Bronkhorst, this {{indicates}} that the four truths were later added to earlier descriptions of liberation by practicing the four dhyanas, which originally {{was thought to be}} sufficient for the destruction of the arsavas. Anderson, following Norman, <b>also</b> <b>thinks</b> that the four truths originally were not part of this sutta, and were later added in some versions. According to Bronkhorst, the [...] "twelve insights" [...] are probably also a later addition, born out of unease with the substitution of the general term [...] "prajna" [...] for the more specific [...] "four truths".|$|E
2500|$|In his book, Christopher Hitchens says [...] {{of prayer}} {{that if the}} {{petitioner}} is praying to a god which is omnipotent and all-knowing, it would be presumptuous for the petitioner to believe they understand {{the grand scheme of}} things sufficiently to pray for what is best. For example, he interprets Ambrose Bierce's definition of prayer by stating that [...] "the man who prays is the one who thinks that god has arranged matters all wrong, but who <b>also</b> <b>thinks</b> that he can instruct god how to put them right." ...|$|E
2500|$|Grampa Johnson (Oliver [...] "Swede" [...] Johnson) — Alice's father, who spoils Dennis often. He {{evokes the}} unintentional jealousy of Mr. Wilson, for {{he gets to}} see Dennis only on occasion, but Mr. Wilson sees him all the time. Because they are so much alike, Dennis and Grampa Johnson get along beautifully. Mr. Wilson <b>also</b> <b>thinks</b> that Johnson should act his age, but this advice is often ignored. To Grampa, life is worth living and he {{encourages}} Dennis to live it to the fullest. His wife's status is unknown; she is never seen in the comics, although she is mentioned twice: once when, thanks to Dennis, a furious Alice finds out that Henry had thrown his mother-in-law's gift (a tie) into the trash.; another time Alice wished her mother a Happy Mother’s Day via the telephone.|$|E

2500|$|Toriyama {{believes}} his strength is in directing games {{that are very}} story-driven. He <b>also</b> <b>thinks</b> that it becomes very difficult to tell a compelling story when the player is given {{a huge amount of}} freedom to explore. According to him, {{the most important aspect of}} a Final Fantasy game is the characters. Toriyama explains that there are different approaches to creating a protagonist: with Yuna from Final Fantasy X, the general plot had already been set when the character was conceived; with Lightning from Final Fantasy XIII instead, the character's personality was decided upon before the backstory was written. He feels that a developer needs to [...] "essentially fall in love at first sight with a character" [...] to [...] "keep [...] going". Toriyama considers the voice the [...] "main image of the character" [...] and thus [...] "the most delicate part of making the character".|$|E
2500|$|Hippias Minor (...) , or On Lying, {{is thought}} to be one of Plato's early works. Socrates matches wits with an arrogant polymath, who is also a smug {{literary}} critic. Hippias believes that Homer can be taken at face value, and he <b>also</b> <b>thinks</b> that Achilles may be believed when he says he hates liars, whereas Odysseus' resourceful (...) behavior stems from his ability to lie well (365b). Socrates argues that Achilles is a cunning liar who throws people off the scent of his own deceptions and that cunning liars are actually the [...] "best" [...] liars. Consequently, Odysseus was equally false and true and so was Achilles (369b). Socrates proposes, possibly for the sheer dialectical fun of it, that it is better to do evil voluntarily than involuntarily. His case rests largely on the analogy with athletic skills, such as running and wrestling. [...] He says that a runner or wrestler who deliberately sandbags is better than the one who plods along because he can do no better.|$|E
2500|$|Everyone is {{thoroughly}} {{confused by the}} two mysteries – who moved the body and who rang the police? While the police are searching the house and grounds, Miss Peake comes downstairs and tells Clarissa and her three guests that she {{is responsible for the}} body being moved in order that a charge couldn't be made against her as the primary evidence is missing. She wasn't in the hysterical state that she made out and, hearing how things were developing, the strong woman removed the body from the recess from the library side and hid it under the bolster of the bed she was [...] "recovering" [...] on. Pippa also comes downstairs, still drowsy over her sleeping pill and talking about seeing policemen in her room in her dreams. She <b>also</b> <b>thinks</b> that her sighting of Oliver was a dream and links this to the wax doll she produces – her [...] "recipe" [...] book was an ancient book on witchcraft and this explains why she confessed to killing Costello: she thought her [...] "spells" [...] had done the deed.|$|E
5000|$|Cato the Elder, a Roman senator, {{frequently}} {{ended his}} speeches {{with the statement}} Ceterum censeo Carthaginem delendam esse ("I <b>also</b> <b>think</b> Carthage {{to be something that}} must be destroyed", i.e. [...] "Besides which, I think Carthage must be destroyed").|$|R
