500|$|Commented {{longtime}} former Atlanta Braves manager Bobby Cox on Bagwell – {{who opposed}} {{him from the}} dugout for the entirety of his career, including numerous times in the playoffs: [...] "Jeff Bagwell was [...] {{for so long and}} starred every year. [...] For me a guy that dominated like that for one team, even in the league stats through the years. [...] His are up there with anybody's. [...] I would put him in right away. [...] So he would get my vote on the first ballot." [...] Still, in spite of the speculation that Bagwell used performance-enhancing drugs, San Francisco Chronicle sportswriter Bruce Jenkins opined that Bagwell did not have the credentials to be in the Hall of Fame. [...] In July 2015, he acknowledged [...] "that many are suspicious of Bagwell—without proof, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>say.</b> [...] I've always voted for the best players—Bonds, McGwire, Clemens, etc.—so that's not a factor for me. [...] I always found Bagwell just a bit short of Hall of Fame material." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} {{released}} on 11 August 2001. It begins with Minogue driving a De Tomaso Mangusta sports car on a futuristic bridge, while singing the [...] "la la la" [...] hook of the song. The next scene consists {{of a number of}} dance couples performing a dance routine dressed in black and white costumes; they are soon joined by Minogue, who is seen wearing a white tracksuit. The setting changes to a room where Minogue is seen striking various poses sporting bright crimson lipstick and a hooded white jumpsuit with a neckline plunging down to her navel. The outfit was designed by London-based fashion designer Fee Doran, under the label of Mrs Jones. Minogue then performs a synchronised dance routine with several backup dancers, who are wearing red and black suits. As the video ends, she performs a similar routine {{on the top of a}} building during the night, this time wearing a lavender halter neck dress with ribbon tile trim. Various scenes in the video show Minogue's face [...] "unusually" [...] close to the lens of the camera, thus it [...] "subtly distorts, yet remains glamorous." [...] Shadforth felt the shot gave a [...] "sort of sense of intimacy and <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> a sort of strangeness," [...] again drawing upon the suggestion of Minogue being an alien. Similarly, Morley opined that it was [...] "the side of Kylie that suddenly reveals itself as being experimental, she is prepared to push herself into positions and shapes that might not be conventionally attractive [...] She becomes alien Kylie as well." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{the end of}} {{his stay}} in Saint-Rémy and the days ahead in Auvers-sur-Oise neared, Van Gogh {{conveyed}} his optimism and enthusiasm by painting flowers. [...] About the time that Van Gogh painted this work, he wrote to his mother, [...] "But for one's health, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> it is very necessary to work in the garden and see the flowers growing." [...] To his sister Wil he wrote, [...] "The last days in Saint-Rémy I worked like a madman. Great bouquets of flowers, violet-colored irises, great bouquets of roses." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Maybe, Mr. 'Empseed," [...] {{interrupted}} Jellyband, with biting sarcasm, [...] "as you're {{a personal}} friend of Mr. Pitt, and <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>says</b> along with Mr. Fox: 'Let 'em murder!' says you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Let me in again, [...] Out {{of the wet}} an' rain, Lord! [...] Out of {{the dark}} an rain, Lord! [...] For it's best <b>as</b> <b>you</b> shall <b>say,</b> My Lord! [...] An' it's best <b>as</b> <b>you</b> shall <b>say!</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|The Prince smoked hard a minute. [...] "As <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> she's splendid, {{but there}} is--there always will be--much of her left. Only, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> also <b>say,</b> for others." ...|$|R
2500|$|I {{am not an}} abstractionist ... I am not {{interested}} in the relationship of color or form or anything else. ... I'm interested only in expressing basic human emotions — tragedy, ecstasy, doom and so on — and the fact {{that a lot of people}} break down and cry when confronted with my pictures show that I communicate those basic human emotions. ... The people who weep before my pictures are having the same religious experience I had when I painted them. And if you, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> are moved only by their color relationships, then you miss the point! ...|$|E
2500|$|Lerner {{points out}} that grey and black {{operations}} ultimately have a heavy cost, in that the target population sooner or later recognizes them as propaganda and discredits the source. He writes, [...] "This {{is one of the}} few dogmas advanced by Sykewarriors that is likely to endure as an axiom of propaganda: Credibility is a condition of persuasion. Before you can make a man do <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> you must make him believe what you say." [...] Consistent with this idea, the Allied strategy in World War II was predominantly one of truth (with certain exceptions).|$|E
2500|$|Enduring {{questions}} remained after [...] "La Noche Triste" [...] (the Sad Night) {{that have}} taken the Mexican government over 30 years to answer. Eventually in 2001, President Vicente Fox, the president who ended the 70-year reign of the PRI, attempted to resolve {{the question of who}} had orchestrated the massacre. President Fox ordered the release of previously classified documents concerning the 1968 massacre. The documents revealed that Elena Poniatowska's synthesis of the events that October night was accurate, as Kate Doyle uncovered, Thousands of students gathered in the square and, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> the government version is that the students opened fire. Well, there's been pretty clear evidence now that there was a unit that was called the Brigada Olympica, or the Olympic Brigade, that was made up of special forces of the presidential guard, who opened fire from the buildings that surrounded the square, and that that was the thing that provoked the massacre.|$|E

60|$|TOPPING. Don't you fret, Miss; he'll come through. His jaw's {{above his}} brow, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> might <b>say.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "True; {{but that}} being, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> the natural route, don't {{you think it}} likely he'll expect {{that it will be}} guarded, and avoid it accordingly?" ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1923, Polly could not put up with their affair any longer and left for London. Harry told Constance {{that he could not}} meet Polly's demand that he [...] "love her more than anyone in the world. This is {{absolutely}} impossible". But Crosby would not leave Polly, nor did Constance ask him to. But when Constance received a letter from Polly, who confessed that Constance's affair with her husband had made her [...] "very miserable", Constance wrote Harry and told him she would not see him any more. Harry was devastated by her decision. [...] "Your letter was bar none the worst blow I have ever received."... I wouldn't leave her under any circumstances nor <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> would you ever marry me." [...] But the three remained friends, and on October 1, 1924, Constance married the Count Pierre de Jumilhac, although the marriage only lasted five years. Polly appeared at least outwardly to tolerate Harry's dallying unconventional behavior, and she soon had her own courtiers. In her journals, she privately worried about Harry's continued loyalty to her.|$|E
2500|$|Blink-182 reunited in February 2009 and Hoppus {{confirmed}} {{in an interview}} with Alternative Press that +44 was on hiatus: [...] "I don't consider it done. We'll never say never with anything," [...] he remarked. [...] "As soon <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> 'I'm not gonna do that anymore,' you find yourself in a situation where you wanna do that. Shane [...] and Craig [...] are awesome guitarists and great fun to play in a band with, so we definitely won't say that the band is done. But obviously, for the foreseeable future, all of our energy is going into Blink-182." [...] In an interview with Blunt Magazine in March 2009, Hoppus was asked if +44 will continue again, where he stated [...] "I think so, yes. I love Shane [...] and Craig [...] They are great guitarists and good friends and I'd love to do another record with them. I know that Tom DeLonge plans to continue doing Angels & Airwaves in some capacity but right now all of our efforts are on Blink." ...|$|E
2500|$|H. P. Lovecraft {{held the}} book in very high regard (though {{he did not say}} whether it {{influenced}} any of his own stories), saying in a 1936 letter to Fritz Leiber [...] "no one ought to miss reading W. Olaf Stapledon's Last and First Men ... Probably you have read it. If not, make a bee line for library or bookstall!", and in another 1936 letter to Leiber [...] "I'm glad to hear of your perusal of Last and First Men—a volume which to my mind forms the greatest of all achievements in the field that Master Ackerman would denominate [...] "scientifiction". Its scope is dizzying—and despite a somewhat disproportionate acceleration of the tempo toward the end, and a few scientific inferences which might legitimately be challenged, it remains a thing of unparalleled power. <b>As</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> it has the truly basic quality of a myth, and some of the episodes are of matchless poignancy and dramatic intensity." [...] Finally, in a 1937 letter to Arthur Widner he said [...] "I don't care for science fiction of the sort published in cheap magazines. There's no vitality in it—merely dry theories tacked on to shallow, unreal, insincere juvenile adventure stories. But I do like the few real masterpieces in the field—certain of H. G. Wells's novels, S. Fowler Wright's The World Below, & that marvellous piece of imagination by W. Olaf Stapledon, Last & First Men." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1923, {{shortly after}} their arrival in Paris, Caresse {{introduced}} Crosby {{to her friend}} Constance Coolidge, also a Boston Brahmin, an American expatriate. She was the niece of Frank Crowninshield, editor of Vanity Fair, and had been married to American diplomat Ray Atherton. Constance didn't care what others thought about her. She loved anything risky and was addicted to gambling. Crosby nicknamed her the [...] "Lady of the Golden Horse." [...] Crosby immediately began {{a sexual relationship with}} her that continued for several months. Harry rationalized their affair, telling Constance, [...] "One should follow every instinct no matter where it leads." [...] In the fall of 1923, Caresse could not put up with their affair any longer and left for London. Harry told Constance the Caresse he could not meet Caresses' [...] demand that he [...] "love her more than anyone in the world. This is absolutely impossible." [...] But Crosby would not leave Caresse, nor did Constance ask this of him. But when Constance received a letter from Caresse who confessed that her affair with her husband had made her [...] "very miserable", Constance wrote Harry and told him she would not see him any more. Harry was devastated by her decision. [...] "Your letter was bar none the worst blow I have ever received.

[...] But the three remained friends, and on October 1, 1924 Constance married the Count Pierre de Jumilhac, although the marriage only lasted 5 years.|$|E
2500|$|On January 10, 2007, Bush {{announced}} {{his plans for}} the Iraq War troop surge of 2007. The gist of this announcement had been known around the Capitol for over a week, and when the Associated Press asked Ellison for his reaction to the idea on January 8, 2007, he stated that it was [...] "way too late, way too little.... So rather than do something small and ineffective, why not get about the business of what we're {{going to have to do}} eventually, which is to begin to end the occupation?" [...] Ellison called for an immediate withdrawal in Iraq: [...] "We could describe it as a redeployment or withdrawal, but I think we have run the course in terms of our ability to resolve this conflict militarily. I think we need to have a political and economic and diplomatic engagement, and we need to encourage the forces that are in Iraq to begin to resolve the violence in Iraq." [...] When asked if he would support Bush's call for an additional $100 billion to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Ellison said, [...] "I want to see [...] first, I want to actually look at it, but I'm not inclined to continue to support a war or an occupation that he has no plans to get us out of, and which is so costly in terms of dollars and lives of American soldiers but also Iraqis." [...] The White House, when asked for a reaction to the comments, referred to a previous statement by press secretary Tony Snow: [...] "Democrats will have to decide where they stand on two issues: 'No. 1, do you want Iraq to succeed, and, if so, what does that mean? And, No. 2, do you believe in supporting the troops <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> and how do you express that support?'" ...|$|E
60|$|DUKE. [Reasoning genially.] But <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> it is {{something}} quite simple.|$|E
6000|$|... "That wouldn't be remembrance; no, {{it would}} be prescience; and your {{consciousness}} here, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> were <b>saying</b> yesterday, is through knowing, not remembering." ...|$|R
60|$|THE BYSTANDER [inept at definition] It's a--well, it's a copper's nark, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> might <b>say.</b> What {{else would}} you call it? A sort of informer.|$|R

6000|$|They said: [...] "Yes; it will serve." [...] Reading {{what passed}} in their minds, she added: [...] "Have no fear for your baggage. Were you as rich <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> you are poor, and as noble <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> you are humble, both {{it and you}} are safe in the inn of the widow Masouda, O my guests--but how are you named?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I am," [...] replied Luke simply, [...] "looking {{the matter}} {{squarely}} in the face, sir, but I don't quite see how I can avoid standing in the dock <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> before the next four and twenty hours. You see I had quarrelled with Philip, and my stick--which contained a dagger--was found in the park, covered with mud, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> and other stains." ...|$|E
