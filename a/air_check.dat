Sinatra was an aficionado of classical music, and would often request classical strains in his music, inspired by composers such as Puccini and Impressionist masters. His personal favorite was Ralph Vaughan Williams. [...] He would insist on always recording live with the band because it gave him a [...] "certain feeling" [...] to perform live surrounded by musicians. By the mid 1940s, such was his understanding of music that after hearing an <b>air</b> <b>check</b> of some compositions by Alec Wilder which were for strings and woodwinds, he became the conductor at Columbia Records for six of Wilder's compositions: [...] "Air for Oboe", [...] "Air for English Horn", [...] "Air for Flute", [...] "Air for Bassoon", [...] "Slow Dance" [...] and [...] "Theme and Variations".

5000|$|The {{decision}} was made to change to a Top 40/hard rock format, in contrast to what they saw as the rigid, bland presentation of other similar stations in town.

Consequently the launch of U100 was delayed three days. As Hartman and a crew worked 24 hours to changed all the logos and artwork on the broadcast trailer.

They liked the sound of that and [...] "U100" [...] was born, only later realizing the coincidence of the [...] "WYOO" [...] call letters and the new branding of [...] "U100". Another oddity was the placement on the dial. The AM broadcast at 980, and the FM at 101.3.
