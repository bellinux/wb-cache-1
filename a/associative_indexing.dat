40|$|This article explores {{patterns}} of language use in oral poetry within {{a variety of}} semantic formula. Such a formula may vary its surface texture in relation to phonic demands of the metrical environment {{in which it is}} realised. This is the second part of a four-part series based on metrically entangled kennings in Old Norse dróttkvætt poetry as primary material. Old Norse kennings present a semantic formula of a particular type which is valuable as an example owing to the extremes of textural variation that it enables. The first part in this series introduced the approach to kennings as semantic formulae and included an illustrative case study on kennings meaning ‘battle’ realising the last three metrical positions of a dróttkvætt line. This demonstrated that lexical variation in realising these formulae varied according to functional equivalence across semantic categories. The present case study advances this discussion through the examination of the metrical entanglement of the lexicon in realising the semantic formula. On the one hand, it presents evidence of the <b>associative</b> <b>indexing</b> of lexical items realising a battle-kenning of this particular metric-structural type: certain kenning base-words exhibit a preferred semantic category of determinant. On the other hand, it also presents evidence of the <b>associative</b> <b>indexing</b> of lexical items that are used for realising the metrically required rhyme in a position in the line that is outside of the semantic formula: certain kenning base-words exhibit co-occurrence with a particular rhyme-word...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{introduces}} {{an interactive}} Memex-like application using a self-modifiable Petri Net model – Self-modifiable Color Petri Net (SCPN). The Memex (“memory extender”) device proposed by Vannevar Bush in 1945 {{focused on the}} problems of “locating relevant information in the published records and recording how that information is intellectually connected. ” The important features of Memex include <b>associative</b> <b>indexing</b> and retrieval. In this paper, the self-modifiable functions of SCPN are used to achieve trail recording and retrieval. A place in SCPN represents a website and an arc indicates the trail direction. Each time when a new website is visited, a place corresponding to this website will be added. After a trail is built, users can use it to retrieve the websites they have visited. Besides, useful user interactions are supported by SCPN to achieve Memex functions. The types of user interactions include: forward, backward, history, search, etc. A simulator has been built to demonstrate that the SCPN model can realize Memex functions. Petri net instances can be designed to model trail record, back, and forward operations using this simulator. Furthermore, a client-server based application system has been built. Using this system, a user can surf online and record his surfing history on the server according to different topics and share them with other users...|$|E

The purpose of the work: the isolation of morpho-funstional versions of the nucleiforming areas of the man's chromosomes {{on the base of}} the comparative analysis of availability of active and inactive copies of the rRNA genes in the nucleiforming areas (NFA); studying some functional properties of the man's NFA variants. For the first time, 4 morphofunctional versions NFA, differein in presence of the rRNA gene copies and in quantity of the active and inactive copies, have been isolated. The interindividual differences by the occurance of the NFA different versions have been characterized. The non-uniformity of its betweenchromosome distribution has been detected. It has been shown, that the decrease of the <b>associative</b> <b>index</b> has not been connected with the decrease of the rRNA genes transcription in NFA.

To date, {{there are still}} some significant security and privacy challenges in people-centric sensing networks. In this paper, we focus on the private data sharing and protection in people-centric sensing networks. First, we formalize the network model with relay nodes which improves the data forwarding efficiency of networks. Second, we propose a novel Attribute based Private data sharing protocol in People-centric sensing networks (APP). Relying on the technology of ciphertext policy attribute based encryption, our APP protocol can protect the privacy and integrity with efficient approaches of authentication, encryption, transmission and decryption. Also, we propose an <b>associative</b> data <b>indexing</b> scheme to improve the private data sharing performance. Finally, we discuss the performance evaluation of APP protocol in detail and find that it can achieve much better efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Addicts show both reward {{processing}} {{deficits and}} increased salience attribution to drug cues. However, no study {{to date has}} demonstrated that salience attribution to drug cues can directly modulate inferences of reward value to non-drug cues. Associative learning depends on salience: a more salient predictor of an outcome will ‘overshadow’ a less salient predictor of the same outcome. Similarly, blocking, a demonstration that learning depends on prediction error, can {{be influenced by the}} salience of the cues employed. This study investigated whether salient drug cues might interact with neutral cues predicting financial reward in an <b>associative</b> learning task <b>indexing</b> blocking and overshadowing in satiated smokers (n= 24), abstaining smokers (n= 24) and non-smoking controls (n= 24). Attentional bias towards drug cues, craving and expired CO were also indexed. Abstaining smokers showed drug cue induced overshadowing, attributing higher reward value to drug cues than to neutral cues that were equally predictive of reward. Overshadowing was positively correlated with expired CO levels, which, in turn, were correlated with craving in abstainers. An automatic attentional bias towards cigarette cues was found in abstainers only. These findings provide the first evidence that drug cues interact with reward processing in a drug dependent population...|$|R
40|$|Most {{applications}} require storing multiple {{versions of}} data and involve a lot of temporal semantics in their schema. This requires maintenance and querying of temporal relations. A Bitemporal DBMS will simplify the development and maintenance of such applications by moving temporal support from the application into the DBMS engine. The success of such Bitemporal DBMSs relies mainly {{on the availability of}} high performance indices that handle update and search operations efficiently. A successful <b>associative</b> data structure (<b>index)</b> is the one that can efficiently partition the space of the attributes that are used within the keys. Temporal attributes have unique characteristics and should support now-relative intervals. These intervals grow as time grows and thus we need an index that can handle attributes with variable values. The proposed bitemporal index partitions the bitemporal space into four subspaces according to the end value of the temporal intervals. This results in separating those keys that have variable intervals from those that have fixed interval(s). In this thesis we have used on-the-shelf index that successfully indexes spatial attributes. But instead of representing the two temporal dimensions as a rectangle, we have represented them as 4 dimensional points. This results in better partitioning of each subtree space and in better search performance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The content {{addressable}} memory (CAM) is {{a memory}} in which data can be accessed {{on the basis of}} contents rather than by specifying physical address. In the paper, five novel dynamic ternary CAM cells with decoupled match lines are presented. A ternary CAM cell is capable of storing and matching three values: zero (0), one (1), and don’t care (X). The proposed dynamic CAM (DCAM) cells range in the number of transistors from 6 n-type transistors up to 10. 5 n- and p-type transistors (one transistor is shared between two cells). The cells are capable of fast match and read operations enhancing the performance of the memory system. Using a 0. 25 - m CMOS technology, simulations of the proposed CAM cells were performed to compare their performance. With this technology, the shortest match delay is 89. 7 ps for the 7. 5 DCAM cell. A complete characterization of the five cells is provided in this paper. These results show that the novel CAM cells outperform existing cells. The compact size and low power dissipation of these ternary CAM cells make them suitable for many applications such as routers, database, and <b>associative</b> cache memories. <b>Index</b> Terms—Content addressable memory (CAM), dynamic circuits, memory cells, ternary digit (trit) operations, ternary matching.

40|$|Although many {{behavioral}} {{studies have}} reported associative memory was different from item memory, evidence coming from ERP researches has been in debate. In addition, directed forgetting effect for items has been fully discussed, but whether association between items can be directed-forgotten was unclear. The directed forgetting effect was important for disassociating the item retrieval and associative retrieval because of the one-to-one mapping relationship both between item retrieval and familiarity and between associative retrieval and recollection Thus, {{the aim of this}} study was to investigate the dissociation between item retrieval and associative retrieval and test directed forgetting effect for associative information. Associative recognition paradigm combined with directed forgetting paradigm by ERP recording was employed. Old/rearranged effect in to-be-remembered condition, which was associated with associative memory, was significant at 500 - 800 ms (LPC) but not at 300 - 500 ms interval (FN 400), indicating that item information was retrieved prior to associative information. The ERP wave calculated by subtracting the to-be-forgotten old pairs with old response from those with rearranged response, which reflected associative retrieval in the to-be-forgotten condition, was negative from 500 to 800 ms (reversal old/new effect), indicating that association between items can be directed-forgotten. Similar evidence was obtained by contrasting rearranged responses aimed to the to-be-forgotten old pairs with those aimed to the to-be-remembered rearranged pairs, which actually represented the complete failure of associative retrieval. Therefore, item retrieval and <b>associative</b> retrieval were <b>indexed</b> by FN 400 and LPC respectively, with associative retrieval more inhibited than item retrieval...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to extend the {{theoretical}} {{understanding of the relationship}} between hippocampal spatial and memory functions to the level of neurophysiological mechanisms underlying spatial navigation and episodic memory retrieval. The proposed unifying theory describes both phenomena within a unique framework, as based on one and the same pathfinding function of the hippocampus. We propose a mechanism of reconstruction of the context of experience involving a search for a nearly shortest path in the space of remembered contexts. To analyze this concept in detail, we define a simple connectionist model consistent with available rodent and human neurophysiological data. Numerical study of the model begins with the spatial domain as a simple analogy for more complex phenomena. It is demonstrated how a nearly shortest path is quickly found in a familiar environment. We prove numerically that associative learning during sharp waves can account for the necessary properties of hippocampal place cells. Computational study of the model is extended to other cognitive paradigms, with the main focus on episodic memory retrieval. We show that the ability to find a correct path may be vital for successful retrieval. The model robustly exhibits the pathfinding capacity within a wide range of several factors, including its memory load (up to 30, 000 abstract contexts), the number of episodes that become associated with potential target contexts, and the level of dynamical noise. We offer several testable critical predictions in both spatial and memory domains to validate the theory. Our results suggest that (1) the pathfinding function of the hippocampus, in addition to its <b>associative</b> and memory <b>indexing</b> functions, may be vital for retrieval of certain episodic memories, and (2) the hippocampal spatial navigation function could be a precursor of its memory function...|$|R
