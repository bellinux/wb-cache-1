A pronounced change in the magnetic entropy was found near the critical temperature.

40|$|Nanostructured samples {{serve as}} a {{playground}} of solid state physics due to their vast diversity of applications. In addition to various fabrication recipes and measurement methods, the temperature at which these experiments are performed {{plays a crucial role}} because thermal excitations can conceal the underlying physics. Thus advancing to lower temperatures in solid state systems might shed light on presently unknown physical phenomena, as e. g. new topological states of matter. We present a novel type of refrigerator using <b>adiabatic</b> nuclear <b>demagnetization</b> with the goal of reaching sub-millikelvin electron temperatures in nanostructured samples. The nuclear stage consists of electronically separated Cu plates, each of which is part of a measurement lead. Before connecting to the nuclear stage, each lead is strongly filtered and then thermalized to the mixing chamber of the dilution refrigerator. This thesis presents measurements on two of these systems: the first operated in a standard, "wet" cryostat and the second on a "dry" pulse tube refrigerator. Both nuclear stages cool below 300 microkelvin with heat leaks in the order of a few nanowatts per mol of copper. We perform electronic transport measurements on various nanostructured samples. For the wet system, we extract electron temperatures around 5 - 7 mK after replacing the sample holder material and including an additional filtering stage. These measurements are highly sensitive to noise of the experimental setup and to the electrostatic environment of the devices, e. g. wafer-intrinsic charge noise. In yet another experiment on a high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas, we observe a quantization of the longitudinal resistance Rxx which arises from a density gradient across the wafer. As for the dry system, we attach a home-built magnetic field fluctuation thermometer to the nuclear stage. While calibrated at 4 K, it shows good agreement with various other thermometers down to 5 mK, with the lowest temperature being 700 microkelvin. However, electron temperatures in the samples are around 15 mK, possibly caused by the increased heat leak combined with the weakened thermalization...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{low temperature}} experiments on lithium. The experiments concentrate on investigating low temperature phase transitions of two subsystems in this metal: its nuclear spin and electronic systems. These phenomena were investigated {{in two separate}} sets of samples, each {{designed to meet the}} experimental requirements for the phenomena under investigation. The electronic ground state of lithium at ambient pressures is expected to be superconducting, but earlier experiments show that the metal remains normal at least down to 4  mK. In this thesis research, a lithium sample was cooled down to 0. 1  mK, B <  10  nT, but no superconductivity was observed. A new upper limit for the superconducting transition temperature was established, over an order of magnitude lower than the earlier upper limit. Many theoretical estimates predict superconductivity already at higher temperatures, and its absence remains a puzzle. The superconductivity in lithium has been under considerable interest recently, since the superconducting phase was observed in the highly compressed state. The nuclear spin system of lithium was investigated as well. The large magnetic moment of the lithium- 7 nuclei made lithium an interesting target for studies of nuclear magnetism. The spin system was cooled down by a two stage <b>adiabatic</b> nuclear <b>demagnetization</b> cryostat. The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, the spin temperature, and the static susceptibility were measured. The NMR spectra revealed the appearance of an anomalous peak at low frequencies. Also, the spin system was found to behave in an irreversible manner at low fields and high nuclear polarizations. These effects give evidence for the existence of a magnetically ordered state of the lithium nuclei. The type of the order was not resolved unambiguously, but some facts point to a ferromagnetic ordering. A tentative phase diagram was constructed for the system. Previously, nuclear magnetism and superconductivity in rhodium metal have been investigated. This thesis also includes some numerical and analytical modeling on the nuclear spin system of rhodium, aimed at the interpretation of the experimental data. reviewe...|$|R

50|$|One {{variant of}} <b>adiabatic</b> <b>demagnetization</b> that {{continues}} to find substantial research application is nuclear demagnetization refrigeration (NDR). NDR follows the same principles, {{but in this case}} the cooling power arises from the magnetic dipoles of the nuclei of the refrigerant atoms, rather than their electron configurations. Since these dipoles are of much smaller magnitude, they are less prone to self-alignment and have lower intrinsic minimum fields. This allows NDR to cool the nuclear spin system to very low temperatures, often 1 µK or below. Unfortunately, the small magnitudes of nuclear magnetic dipoles also makes them less inclined to align to external fields. Magnetic fields of 3 teslas or greater are often needed for the initial magnetization step of NDR.|$|E

50|$|The {{magnetocaloric effect}} (MCE, from magnet and calorie) is a magneto-thermodynamic {{phenomenon}} {{in which a}} temperature change of a suitable material is caused by exposing the material to a changing magnetic field. This is also known by low temperature physicists as <b>adiabatic</b> <b>demagnetization.</b> In {{that part of the}} refrigeration process, a decrease in the strength of an externally applied magnetic field allows the magnetic domains of a magnetocaloric material to become disoriented from the magnetic field by the agitating action of the thermal energy (phonons) present in the material. If the material is isolated so that no energy is allowed to (re)migrate into the material during this time, (i.e., an adiabatic process) the temperature drops as the domains absorb the thermal energy to perform their reorientation. The randomization of the domains occurs in a similar fashion to the randomization at the curie temperature of a ferromagnetic material, except that magnetic dipoles overcome a decreasing external magnetic field while energy remains constant, instead of magnetic domains being disrupted from internal ferromagnetism as energy is added.|$|E
5000|$|The basic {{operating}} principle of an <b>adiabatic</b> <b>demagnetization</b> refrigerator (ADR) {{is the use}} of a strong magnetic field to control the entropy of a sample of material, often called the [...] "refrigerant". Magnetic field constrains the orientation of magnetic dipoles in the refrigerant. The stronger the magnetic field, the more aligned the dipoles are, corresponding to lower entropy and heat capacity because the material has (effectively) lost some of its internal degrees of freedom. If the refrigerant is kept at a constant temperature through thermal contact with a heat sink (usually liquid helium) while the magnetic field is switched on, the refrigerant must lose some energy because it is equilibrated with the heat sink. When the magnetic field is subsequently switched off, the heat capacity of the refrigerant rises again because the degrees of freedom associated with orientation of the dipoles are once again liberated, pulling their share of equipartitioned energy from the motion of the molecules, thereby lowering the overall temperature of a system with decreased energy. Since the system is now insulated when the magnetic field is switched off, the process is adiabatic, i.e., the system can no longer exchange energy with its surroundings (the heat sink), and its temperature decreases below its initial value, that of the heat sink.|$|E
