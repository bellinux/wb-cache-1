5|$|Leonard Victor (Len) Waters (20June 1924– 24August 1993) was {{the first}} Aboriginal Australian {{military}} aviator, {{and the only one}} to serve as a fighter pilot in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) during World WarII. Aborigines at the time suffered significant discrimination and disadvantages in Australian society, such as restrictions on movement, residence, employment, and <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>services</b> and citizenship. Born in northern New South Wales and raised in Queensland, Waters was working as a shearer when he joined the RAAF in 1942. Training initially as a mechanic, he volunteered for flying duties and graduated as a sergeant pilot in 1944. He flew P-40 Kittyhawks in the South West Pacific theatre, where he completed 95 missions, mainly close air support. By {{the end of the war}} he had risen to the rank of warrant officer. Following his discharge from the RAAF in 1946, he attempted to start a regional airline but was unable to secure financial backing and government approval. He went back to shearing, and died in 1993 at the age of 69.|$|E

30|$|The {{analysis}} of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> credit <b>services</b> received by farmers showed that 75.6 and 24.4 % {{of the farmers}} have {{and do not have}} <b>access</b> <b>to</b> credit <b>services</b> respectively. The chi-square result (X 2 [*]=[*] 1.485) of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> credit <b>services</b> is statistically insignificant at the 95 % level of significance. Therefore, there is no relation between <b>access</b> <b>to</b> credit <b>services</b> and farmers’ decision to participate in watershed management programs. This could be because of farmers’ fear about their inability to pay back the credit within the prescribed period of time, which could lead to punishment.|$|R
40|$|The ethical {{approach}} of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>services</b> {{is motivated by}} the particularity of health services {{and the meaning of}} justice. <b>Access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>services</b> has become a priority of our societies, and inequalities in <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>services</b> are perceived as inhuman, immoral, or unjust. Health policies mobilize solidarity networks as well as the health <b>services</b> offered. Fair <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>services</b> depends both on individual demands (possibility of accessing <b>services</b> and actual <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>services)</b> and supplies (availability and organization of the system). What are the choices to be made in accessing health services {{from the point of view}} of justice? What are the criteria that stand at the basis of justice? Is it the market? Or solidarity? Perhaps utilitarianism? These choices must be preceded by a serious debate...|$|R
40|$|Background: Equity of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>services</b> {{is a major}} {{challenge}} faced by many countries in the world. The gap in health status between developed and developing countries often occur. Including health inequalities between groups within a country. This study aimed to describe theory and application of the equity of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>services</b> in research. Methods: The literature review with systematic mapping studies related <b>to</b> equity of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>services</b> in some countries. It is conducted {{with a set of}} five research questions, there were 30 studies, from 1999 to 2014, were evaluated. Results: Equity in <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>services</b> occurred when health services have been distributed according to geography, socio-economic and community needs, and vice versa. Empirical studies generally reported incidents of inequity of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>services</b> was influenced by various factors. Generally, researchers used secondary data in exploring equity of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>services.</b> Conclusion: Equity of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health care is an important issue {{that needs to be addressed}} in achieving the goals of health systems. This can be achieved if health care is distributed according to geography, socio-economic and community needs. Both improvement of the supply side and the demand side also exploration studies of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>services</b> need <b>to</b> be developed...|$|R
25|$|Illiteracy {{is both an}} {{important}} cause, and {{an important}} effect, of chronic global poverty. Improvements in livelihoods and <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>services</b> in rural communities depends {{on their ability to}} manage local organizations, or hold external ones accountable. The processes of development can also be undermined by educated agents of development whose 'deeply interiorized literacy' informs their decisions. In recent years this has begun to change, with methods of engagement with oral communities that have emphasized participation, voice, and other development methods like participatory rural appraisal, participatory action research and Farmer Field Schools.|$|E
25|$|Equity {{is highly}} valued in Finland {{and the law}} {{provides}} same rights for all citizens, including in healthcare. There still exists some geographic and socioeconomic disparities. Perhaps {{one of the most}} important reasons for the socioeconomic differences in the use of services is that the private sector and occupational healthcare, which are less accessible to the low-income population, offer better <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>services</b> (e.g. a major difference is waiting times) than the municipal sector. Narrowing health gaps has been the objective of Finnish health policy since the 1980s, however, this objective has not been fully achieved.|$|E
25|$|When Portugal {{emerged from}} years of {{dictatorship}} and the Carnation Revolution's turmoil in 1974, the level of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>services,</b> the technologies used and the service quality were far from optimal. In particular, most municipal wastewater was discharged without any treatment at that time. However, substantial improvements have been achieved since then, in particular after Portugal's adhesion to the European Community (now the European Union) in 1986 which was accompanied by the gradual introduction of EU standards and financing by the European Investment Bank, the introduction of multi-municipal utilities and the holding company Águas de Portugal in 1993, {{and the creation of}} a regulatory agency for the sector in 2000.|$|E

This means that as a farmer gains <b>access</b> <b>to</b> extension <b>service,</b> the frequency of pesticide application decreases. Hashemi et al. (2009) revealed that extension service is an effective method to promote rational use of pesticide.|$|R

25|$|Historical {{investment}} levels There are no {{recent data}} {{on the level of}} investments in the sector. In the five years between 1997 and 2001 Venezuela invested US$ 637million in water and sanitation, or about US$ 127million annually on average. Investment in the sector has historically been volatile. For example, annual investments fluctuated in the 1986-1998 period between less than US$100million (in 1989) and US$400million (in 1992). To a large extent investment levels mirror fluctuation in oil prices. Investment levels declined from 1986-1989 when oil prices were very low. Investments skyrocketed in 1992 after oil prices had increased. Then they plummeted again when oil prices decreased during the remainder of the 1990s. The volatility in sector financing has made it difficult to initiate a sustainable medium-term investment program needed to rehabilitate infrastructure and extend <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>services.</b>|$|E

In 1996, the Southern Weekend newspaper ran a front-page story and devoted another two pages to AIDS in China. This coverage was the first time any comprehensive exposure of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in China had been published by the Chinese press. From 1999, the international and subsequently the national media reported on the thousands of infected plasma donors in Henan and neighbouring provinces who did not have <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>services.</b> Although the government had acted quickly when the tragedy became apparent in 1995 by shutting down collection stations and, later, introducing new laws and regulations on the collection and management of blood and blood products, provision of HIV testing, prevention, and care for donors in the local areas was slower. Progress was stimulated by the media's attention to the plight of the infected plasma donors. Since these initial reports, the HIV/AIDS situation in China has received much attention from the local and international media.|$|E
25|$|As head of each {{district}} office, {{the district}} officer is {{the representative of}} the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government at the district level.

40|$|Surveys of artists&# 039; {{location}} choices {{show that}} they disproportionately reside in large cities. This paper introduces a model that attempts to explain this urban preference. The model includes four factors: <b>access</b> <b>to</b> other artists; <b>access</b> <b>to</b> consumer demand; <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>service</b> jobs; and housing affordability. These four factors are combined in a spatial equilibrium model. An equilibrium spatial distribution of artists {{is derived from the}} model and is correlated with the actual distribution among Swedish municipalities. Subsequently, the model is used for an econometric estimation of factor effects. The results show that <b>access</b> <b>to</b> other artists and local <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>service</b> jobs are important localization factors.
