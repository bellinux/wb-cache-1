50|$|The <b>Antillean</b> <b>siskin</b> (Spinus dominicensis) is {{a species}} of finch in the family Fringillidae. It is found in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Its natural {{habitats}} are subtropical or tropical moist montane forests and heavily degraded former forest.|$|E
5000|$|... • The Eurasian siskin, S. spinus is the {{ancestor}} of pine siskin, <b>Antillean</b> <b>siskin,</b> S. dominicensis, and black-capped siskin, S. atriceps. The sub-species S. pinus perplexus may {{be closer to}} S. atriceps; they both thrive in the Guatemalan-Mexican altiplano.|$|E
50|$|The nearby {{scientific}} {{reserve of}} Ebano Verde is the stronghold of the widest variety of {{flora and fauna}} of Hispaniola. The mountains surrounding the valley of Constanza are covered in Hispaniolan pine (Pinus occidentalis) forests. Typical fauna seen in the area includes the Hispaniolan palm crow, <b>Antillean</b> <b>siskin,</b> rufous-throated solitaire, Hispaniolan crossbill (abundance directly related to pine cone crop), and Hispaniolan trogon, while at lower elevations the Hispaniolan parrot, scaly-naped pigeon and golden swallow can be seen.|$|E
50|$|Birds of {{the moist}} forests include the Hispaniolan amazon (Amazona ventralis), Hispaniolan parakeet (Aratinga chloroptera), Hispaniolan lizard cuckoo (Coccyzus longirostris), palm crow (Corvus palmarum), American kestrel (Falco sparverius), vervain hummingbird (Mellisuga minima), narrow-billed tody (Todus angustirostris), stolid flycatcher (Myiarchus stolidus), Hispaniolan pewee (Contopus hispaniolensis), rufous-throated {{solitaire}} (Myadestes genibarbis), Hispaniolan woodpecker (Melanerpes striatus), white-necked crow (Corvus leucognaphalus), palmchat (Dulus dominicus), Hispaniolan trogon (Priotelus roseigaster), ruddy quail-dove (Geotrygon montana), red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), white-winged warbler (Xenoligea montana), green-tailed warbler (Microligea palustris), <b>Antillean</b> <b>siskin</b> (Carduelis dominicensis), La Selle thrush (Turdus swalesi), eastern chat-tanager (Calyptophilus frugivorus), and Hispaniolan crossbill (Loxia megaplaga). Native mammals include the Hispaniolan hutia (Plagiodontia aedium), Hispaniolan solenodon (Solenodon paradoxus), and 18 bat {{species such as}} the Cuban flower bat (Phyllonycteris poeyi).|$|E
50|$|The {{mountain}} {{and the surrounding}} landscape are covered in pino de cuaba (Pinus occidentalis) forests. The pines frequently host the epiphytes guajaca (Tillandsia spp.) and the parasitic Dendropemon pycnophyllus. Some areas, like the Valle de Lilís, are treeless meadows of tussock-like pajones (Danthonia domingensis). The understory is composed of shrub such as Lyonia heptamera, Myrica picardae, Myrsine coriacea, Ilex tuerkheimii, Garrya fadyenii and Baccharis myrsinites. All of these species are adapted to the acidic soil of the area.Birds seen in the area include the endemic Hispaniolan palm crow (Corvus palmarum palmarum), <b>Antillean</b> <b>siskin</b> (Carduelis dominicensis), rufous-throated solitaire (Myadestes genibarbis), Hispaniolan crossbill (Loxia megaplaga) (abundance directly related to pine cone crop), and Hispaniolan trogon (Priotelus roseigaster); at lower elevations the Hispaniolan amazon (Amazona ventralis), scaly-naped pigeon (Patagioenas squamosa) and golden swallow (Tachycineta euchrysea) can be seen. There are two extant mammals endemic to Hispaniola whose remaining range includes the broadleaf forests of lower elevations: the primarily nocturnal Hispaniolan solenodon (Solenodon paradoxus) and the Hispaniolan hutia (Plagiodontia aedium). Both are endangered and rarely seen. Wild boars, descendants of animals introduced to the island during the colonial period, have been reported.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Three {{separate}} and parallel North American Carduelis evolutionary radiations have been identified. North American siskin radiation (starting about 2. 7 million years ago) comprises siskin, <b>Antillean</b> <b>siskin,</b> black-capped siskin, pine siskin and pine siskin perplexus. C. spinus could have passed to America through the Beringia or Greenland coast and, during Pliocene Epoch, reached the Antilles and evolved into <b>Antillean</b> <b>siskin</b> (C. dominicensis), endemic to Hispaniola Island. It is ancestor of pine siskin. Pine Siskin, also a sister taxon of C. spinus, thrives in North America from Alaska to Guatemala since about 0. 2 MYA. It lives below the Mexican Isthmus {{in the highlands}} from northern Chiapas (Mexico) to western Guatemala. Black-capped siskin (C. atri-ceps) is a sister species of C. spinus, with which it shares habitat and territory. C. pinus green-backed morphs may have been mis-taken by C. atriceps which is a grey-backed finch. Mesoamerican goldfinch radiation (starting about 5 million years ago) includes C. tristis (American goldfinch), C. psaltria (lesser goldfinch) and C. lawrencei (Lawrence's goldfinch). They all thrive in west-ern United States and Mexico, down to northern South America. C. psaltria is a North American bird that colonized South American habitats to North Peru and evolved into darker head and back while going southwards. South American siskin radiation started about 3. 5 million years ago; parental C. notata thrives in Mexican mountains and successfully colonized South America, giv-ing rise to this radiation. South American Carduelis radiation occurred only when mesothermal plants from the Rocky Mountains invaded the Andean spine after emergence of the Panama Isthmus...|$|E
