50|$|After missed site visit, further {{correspondence}} and twists and turns, the private contractors Hoolooman & Associates were hired {{to conduct the}} survey and valuation, reason given being that Navin Ramgoolam’s government lacked the necessary quantity surveying human resources to do so.

Also, the new valuation is not said to be confined only to the MedPoint property <b>after</b> <b>depreciation</b> {{for the purposes of}} the purchase, but to second hand medical equipment and the cost of a new replacement building at current prices which Mrs Hanoomanjee allegedly wanted, hence her need for a Quantity Surveyor, who is a professional in the construction industry concerned with building costs. Hoolooman & Associates were also originally involved in the construction of the MedPoint Clinic and they valued the Land, Building and Services at Rs.145 millions (US$5 Millions). If this valuation contained the replacement cost of the building, the government would have therefore purchased a building which is non-existent and paid the seller for a fictitious building. This in itself should go to the root of the contract and be enough to set it aside.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we measure}} {{economic}} profit in an inflationary environment. Inflation adjusted EVA ® requires two principal alterations. First, we obtain the replacement cost of assets {{by adjusting the}} book value of non-current assets for past inflation. This adjustment reduces EVA ® because replacement cost tends to exceed book value. Second, we add a term to EVA ® to represent a manager’s ability to increase product price as costs increase. This adjustment is positive because this ability adds value to the business. When assets are largely current, the second adjustment dominates because the first is not necessary. In this case, EVA ® underestimates economic profit. Economic profit remains positive when the {{rate of return on}} invested capital, after tax and <b>after</b> <b>depreciation,</b> is less than the weighted average cost of capital by as much as the rate of inflation. Even when inflation is modest, unadjusted EVA ® has the potential to seriously misrepresent the operating performance of business investments...|$|E
40|$|We {{assess the}} motivations for {{changing}} capital controls and their effectiveness in India, {{a country with}} extensive and long-standing controls.

40|$|Do exports expand <b>after</b> <b>depreciations?</b> If so, by how much? And do {{they react}} {{differently}} to such fluctuations {{depending on the}} development status of the traders or the type of the exported good? This paper estimates the export response to real fluctuations in exchange rates using a bilateral sample of 136 countries (34 high-income and 102 developing) for the period 1981 - 1997. Exploiting yearly country-pair variation of the real exchange rate and sectoral bilateral export flows, I estimate the distribution of real exchange rate elasticities of exports by exporter and by sector. The estimated exporter-level elasticities are broadly consistent with existing estimates of unity price elasticities for trade among high-income countries and well below unity for developing countries (from, e. g., Hooper and Marquez, 1995 and Reinhart, 1994). Notably, though, the elasticity for high-income countries (including export flows to the entire sample) is {{significantly lower than the}} consensus of one at only 0. 13. Novel to the empirical literature, I find a sectoral differential in elasticities in which differentiated sectors have a larger elasticity than homogeneous sectors.

40|$|A {{conceptual}} basis {{is laid out}} for measuring the cost of capital for corpora- tions from data typically available {{in countries such as}} the US, Canada, and Japan. Attempts are made to carry out the measurement based both on the accounting records of individual companies and on the aggregate National Accounts data, supplemented by the market information on the price of equity shares. We find a consistent pattern for the US from both sets of data, and the real cost of capital <b>after</b> <b>depreciation</b> and before taxes is found to fluctuate around 10 - 11 % without a persistent trend. For Canada, the indivi- dual company data cover too few companies for too short a period to produce reliable estimates. The aggregate National Accounts data for Canada supple- mented by some unpublished data supplied by Statistics Canada suggest that the cost of capital in Canada is equal to or somewhat lower than that in the US For Japan, the individual company accounts and National Accounts data yield apparently inconsistent results. Attempts are made to identify the sources of inconsistency, although the full clarification of this problem must await the publication by the Economic Planning Agency of a detailed and full explanation of the derivation of its national accounts estimates. Finally, we suggest that the extraordinarily high prices of land and the persistent real capital gains which companies enjoyed on their ownership of land until 1990 were an important cause leading to an underestimation of the cost of capital when the standard procedure is applied to Japanese data, and effects still appear to persist. ...|$|E
30|$|To {{show the}} {{robustness}} of our results, we challenged them {{on two different}} levels. First, we re-calculated our model with different proxies {{for some of the}} independent variables yielding the same results qualitatively: instead of EMPLOYEES as a proxy for company size, we used ASSETS as well as SALES, i.e., the natural logarithm of the company’s total assets/net sales in the focal year (Baranchuk et al. 2011; Elston and Goldberg 2003; Shipilov et al. 2010). We also used another definition of leverage using long-term total debt divided by total assets. Instead of the dummies EXTERNAL_BLOCKHOLDER and OWNER_CONTROLLED_MANAGING_ BOARD to depict the ownership structure, we used the percentages of shares held by different groups of investors: MANAGEMENT_OWNERSHIP for members of the management team, PRIVATE_OWNERSHIP for private owners who {{are not part of the}} management team BANK_OWNERSHIP for banks, and INDUSTRY_OWNERSHIP for other companies. Additionally, we changed the control FEMAL_DIRECTOR from a dummy to a percentage variable and our results remained stable. We also changed the accounting-based and stock-based company performance measures and received the same results. Instead of the return on equity, we used the OPERATIVE_PERFORMANCE (calculated as operative income <b>after</b> <b>depreciation</b> divided by the mean of total assets of the focal and the previous year) as well as the return on assets ROA, and instead of TOBINS’ Q we also used DIVIDEND YIELD (dividends per share divided by market price at year end). Furthermore, we challenged our results by substituting both performance measures with the respective values of the previous year as well as with the average of the focal and the previous year.|$|E
40|$|A survey amongst {{stakeholders}} in 2007 identified wintering systems with less environmental impact and a reliable supply {{of high quality}} feed, which are cost effective and simple to implement, {{as one of the}} top three issues requiring research and demonstration in the Southland region of New Zealand. This study used a modelling approach to examine the cost effectiveness, exposure to climate-induced risk and major economic drivers of four selected wintering strategies, i. e. (1) grazing a forage brassica crop on support land (Brassica system), (2) grazing pasture on support land (All pasture system), (3) cows fed grass silage, made on the support land, on a loafing pad where effluent is captured (Standoff system), and (4) cows fed grass silage, made on the support land, in a housed facility where effluent is captured (Housed system). The model was driven by virtual climate data generated by the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research and economic input data from the DairyNZ Economics Group for the 08 / 09 season with a milk price of NZ$ 4. 551 /kg milksolids (fatÂ +Â protein). The Housed system had the highest average (Â± STDEV) operating profit (profit <b>after</b> <b>depreciation</b> but before interest charges) over 35 independently simulated climate years (NZ$ 743 Â Â±Â  122 /ha), followed by All pasture (NZ$ 681 Â Â±Â  197 /ha), Standoff (NZ$ 613 Â Â±Â  135 /ha) and Brassica (NZ$ 599 Â Â±Â  212 /ha). This ranking was sensitive to the assumptions and treatment of capital costs. The Housed system was the least exposed to climate-induced risk with a coefficient of variation of operating profit of 16 % compared to 35 % of the Brassica system. The four systems demonstrated different financial strengths and weaknesses that largely balanced out in the end. The Brassica system is a high risk system from an environmental perspective and the All pasture system an unlikely alternative because of scarcity of suitable land. Both the Housed and Standoff systems appear to be cost effective alternatives that allow high control over cow feeding, body condition and comfort over winter. Furthermore, both systems have the potential to provide high control over the storage and release of animal effluent onto land, thus saving fertiliser costs and reducing environmental footprint.
