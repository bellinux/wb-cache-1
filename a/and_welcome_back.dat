Except Puli, {{the rest of}} the {{releases}} achieved commercial success. She earned a nomination for the Best Actress – Telugu award at the 63rd Filmfare Awards South ceremony for her performance in Srimanthudu. The following year, she had two releases: Rocky Handsome and Premam. The latter, a Telugu remake of the 2015 Malayalam-language film of the same name, drew criticism for Haasan's casting before its release. She played the role of a young college lecturer with a slightly stern approach towards her students. The remake gained positive critical reception, and earned average returns. Her Tamil film Si3 had a delayed theatrical release in 2017; it was a commercial success.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner, two former {{executives}} at ABC, left the network {{to start their}} own production company. At ABC, they had overseen sitcoms such as Mork & Mindy, Three's Company, <b>and</b> <b>Welcome</b> <b>Back,</b> Kotter. The two decided that {{in order to get a}} sitcom to sell for their fledgling company, they needed a big name behind it. Bill Cosby, who, during the 1970s, starred in two failed sitcoms, produced award-winning stand up comedy albums, and had roles in several different films, was relatively quiet during the early 1980s.|$|E

The Punisher was shot on {{location}} in Tampa, Florida, and surrounding environs in mid to late 2003. It was distributed by Lions Gate Entertainment in North America, although Artisan Entertainment, which produced a 1989 film adaptation of The Punisher, financed and co-distributed the film with eventual Artisan owner Lionsgate, while Columbia Pictures distributed the film in non-North American countries. Screenwriter Jonathan Hensleigh agreed to helm the film during its development stage despite a dispute with Marvel Studios, marking his directorial debut.|$|E

60|$|Spring, {{beautiful}} spring! returned {{again to}} cheer {{us in our}} solitude, and to open into life the waters and streams of Hudson Bay. Great will {{be the difference between}} the reader's idea of that season in that place and the reality. Spring, with its fresh green leaves and opening flowers, its emerald fields and shady groves, filled with sounds of melody! No, reader; that is not the spring we depict: not quite so beautiful, though far more prized by those who spend a monotonous winter of more than six months in solitude. The sun shines brightly in a cloudless sky, lighting up the pure white fields and plains with dazzling brilliancy. The gushing waters of a thousand rills, formed by the melting snow, break sweetly on the ear, like the well-remembered voice of a long-absent friend. The whistling wings of wild-fowl, as they ever and anon desert the pools of water now open in the lake and hurry over the forest-trees, accord well with the shrill cry of the yellow-leg and curlew, and with the general wildness of the scene; while the reviving frogs chirrup gladly in the swamps to see the breaking up of winter <b>and</b> <b>welcome</b> <b>back</b> the spring. This is the spring I write of; and to have a correct idea of the beauties and the sweetness of this spring, you must first spend a winter in Hudson Bay.|$|E
