5|$|These {{ships were}} {{designed}} by Sir Edward Reed, the Director of Naval Construction, as replacements for the various gunvessels built for the Crimean War. Being built of green timber, their hulls were starting to rot after <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> in service, but their engines were still generally sound. As the older ships were broken up their engines were salvaged and transferred to Beacon-class ships under construction. Combat experience against Chinese fortifications had shown that the single 32-pounder smoothbore armament of the earlier ships was not powerful enough so Reed was directed to prepare a twin-screw, shallow draft design suitable for riverine operations that incorporated a pair of steam engines from the older gunboats, a heavy armament, and enough freeboard to allow for service at sea. These rather contradictory requirements forced Reed to discard traditional wooden framing for these ships and the Beacon class became the first ships of the Royal Navy to be framed in iron with wooden planking.|$|E

30|$|To {{investigate}} {{the changes in}} microstructures of wood with elapsed time in the environment, CO 2 adsorption onto dry wood was measured at ice-water temperature (273 K) for samples aged from 0.1 years to over 1000 years. The micropore size distribution was obtained using the Horvath-Kawazoe method. Micropores smaller than 0.6 nm in wood decreased in number with elapsed time in the environment, and a negative correlation was found between cumulative pore volume for pores smaller than 0.6 nm and elapsed time in the environment. Cumulative pore volume in the 1000 -year sample was almost half {{of that in the}} 0.1 - year sample. Micropores smaller than 0.6 nm in wood with <b>a</b> few <b>decades</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> of elapsed time increased in number after rewetting and drying. Consequently, microstructures of wood with longer time elapsed in the environment were considered to be more stable, because of longer-term thermal motion and possibly more repeated moisture adsorption and desorption and/or temperature variation in the environment.|$|R

40|$|With the {{increasing}} professionalisation of the Australian Football League (AFL), greater demands are being placed upon AFL players {{with respect to}} their technical, tactical, and physiological training, in addition to increased requirements to promote their club’s brand via community appearances. Modern AFL players have an additional challenge as their careers will be typically limited to, at best, <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> slightly <b>more</b> at the elite level. This means that they are also encouraged to develop an alternative career for when their playing days are over. Thus, given these demands, there is substantial challenge for the modern footballer in achieving a sense of balance between work and non-work life whilst also preparing for their next career. Although there is a strong ethical argument to support professional athletes’ off-field activities and development away from the field, there is also a growing argument from some coaches and athletes that participating in these activities actually carries some benefit for the way athletes perform in their sport. Such an argument is consistent with contemporary human resource and management literature where in demanding professions, the support of employee work-life balance and holistic development {{has been shown to be}} associated with employee engagement and productivity. Within the AFL however there has been mixed views concerning the value of supporting player off-field activities and preparations for life after football. This is understandable given that there is often an underlying assumption in elite sport that to be successful you must ‘out work’ those you are competing with. The present thesis sought to investigate the potential value that participation in off-field activities associated with their lives away from football (i. e., their social, recreational, and career development activities) may have with respect to AFL players’ experience of engagement in their roles as footballers...|$|R
40|$|Many {{scientists}} in the fin de siècle era saw a need to coordinate and unify the increasing amount of data relating the physical conditions of the Earth and the Sun; <b>or</b> <b>more</b> generally to establish a synthetic perspective that covered the earth sciences {{in relation to the}} new astrophysical sciences. Promoted under the label "cosmical physics'', the unifying solar–terrestrial perspective was in vogue for <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> two. Perhaps <b>more</b> than any other scientist in the period, the versatile Swedish chemist and physicist Svante Arrhenius represented the aims of cosmical physics. A central problem in the new and ambitious research programme was to understand the origin and nature of the aurora, and to relate it to other celestial phenomena such as the solar corona and the tails of comets. In 1900 Arrhenius proposed a unified explanation of these and other phenomena based on the Sun's radiation pressure. The theory was widely discussed, praised as well as criticized. Arrhenius was not only a key scientist in the short-lived tradition of cosmical physics, but also influential as a popular writer and powerful member of the Nobel Committee for Physics. His work illustrates an approach to the earth and space sciences characteristic of the fin de siècle period...|$|R
40|$|Current drugs {{used in the}} {{treatment}} of Parkinson's disease (PD), for example, L-DOPA and dopamine agonists, are very effective at reversing the motor symptoms of the disease. However, they do little to combat the underlying degeneration of dopaminergic neurones in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and their long-term use is associated with the appearance of adverse effects such as L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. Much emphasis has therefore been placed on finding alternative non-dopaminergic drugs that may circumvent some or all of these problems. Group III metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors were first identified in the basal ganglia <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> ago. One <b>or</b> <b>more</b> of these receptors (mGlu 4, mGlu 7 or mGlu 8) is found on pre-synaptic terminals of basal ganglia pathways whose overactivity is implicated not only in the generation of motor symptoms in PD, but also in driving the progressive SNc degeneration. The finding that drugs which activate group III mGlu receptors can inhibit transmission across these overactive synapses has lead to the proposal that group III mGlu receptors are promising targets for drug discovery in PD. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the role and target potential of group III mGlu receptors in the basal ganglia. Overwhelming evidence obtained from in vitro studies and animal models of PD supports group III mGlu receptors as potentially important drug targets for providing both symptom relief and neuroprotection in PD...|$|R

25|$|The {{common law}} is more {{malleable}} than statutory law.

Second, the common law evolves {{through a series of}} gradual steps, that gradually works out all the details, so that over <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> <b>more,</b> the law can change substantially but without a sharp break, thereby reducing disruptive effects. In contrast to common law incrementalism, the legislative process is very difficult to get started, as legislatures tend to delay action until a situation is totally intolerable. For these reasons, legislative changes tend to be large, jarring and disruptive (sometimes positively, sometimes negatively, and sometimes with unintended consequences).|$|E

40|$|The study {{deals with}} the {{migration}} {{of large numbers of}} black workers from white-owned farms in the Albany and Bathurst districts to Grahamstown. In South Africa the migration of farm residents to the towns has not yet received much attention from researchers. Instead, most migrant studies have concentrated on the migration from the 'homeland' areas and for this reason {{little is known about the}} people who have been associated with the farms in some cases for five generations. From the 1940 s these farms were rapidly losing labour largely on account of the introduction of mechanization and land rationalization. At that time many farm dwellers were migrating to Grahamstown and, to same extent, Port Elizabeth. The past few <b>decades</b> witnessed <b>a</b> massive further migration from these farms and this, together with natural increase, contributed to the 53, 9 % increase in Graharnstown's black population in the 1970 - 80 decade. The study has these aims: 1. To consider the factors that have promoted the move away from the farms, especially as from the end of the Second World War. 2. To account for the overwhelming attraction of Grahamstown as a destination among those who must, or decide to, migrate. 3. To assess the mode of adaptation of those who settle in Grahamstown pennanently. Those who have been in town for several <b>decades</b> provide <b>a</b> background for the central focus of the study, the new irrmigrants who came to town <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> ago <b>or</b> <b>more</b> recently. The latter include people who migrated to town from August 1984, i. e. during a period of extra-ordinary political developments and serious unrest in Grahamstown. The study places an emphasis on the way the imnigrants themselves perceive the process. The aims of the study which have been mentioned above revolve around the impoverishment of rural inhabitants who must now work for wages with hardly any measure of autonomy over the major aspects of their lives while those who go and live in town must contend with a competitive urban economy in which economic opportunities are scarce. This is the central problem of this thesis. ...|$|R

Other aromas associated with Nebbiolo include dried fruit, damsons, leather, licorice, mulberries, spice as well dried and fresh herbs. While Barolo & Barbaresco tend to be the heaviest and most in need of aging, wines made in the modernist style are becoming more approachable at a young age.
