Saudi Arabia {{is considered one of}} the world’s foremost emerging markets. Since Saudi Arabia joined the World Trade Organization, its stock market has been growing quickly, including rapid growth in M 2 ̆ 6 A transactions. The author of this paper argues that Saudi has a significant need for M 2 ̆ 6 A activity and notes that despite the sharp growth in M 2 ̆ 6 A activity in Saudi in recent years, most of Saudi’s M 2 ̆ 6 <b>A</b> <b>laws</b> are not modern or sophisticated enough to handle the large, complex M 2 ̆ 6 A transactions that are beginning to occur in the Kingdom. Certain M 2 ̆ 6 A transactions attempted in Saudi, such as the Sahara-Sipchem deal, have been unsuccessful due to the absence of a legal framework capable of reinforcing and protecting M 2 ̆ 6 A transactions and boosting M 2 ̆ 6 A activities. This paper offers a critique and analysis of Saudi Arabia’s M 2 ̆ 6 <b>A</b> <b>laws.</b> The author argues that most of Saudi’s current M 2 ̆ 6 <b>A</b> <b>laws</b> discourage corporations from engaging in M 2 ̆ 6 A activity and/or cause M 2 ̆ 6 A transactions to fail due to their (the laws’) deficits. This dissertation identifies loopholes in the Saudi legislation that governs M 2 ̆ 6 A transactions. It covers antitrust law, corporate law, securities law and tax law and provides recommendations supported by models from different jurisdictions as to how M 2 ̆ 6 <b>A</b> <b>laws</b> in Saudi can be made more efficient and brought in line with modern economic principles...|$|R

5|$|Aggrieved {{persons who}} cannot avail {{themselves}} of the protection afforded by Article 12(2) may try to argue {{that they are a}} member of a group defined by <b>a</b> <b>law</b> in a way that violates Article 12(1). The rational nexus test, also known as the doctrine of reasonable classification, is a three-stage test formulated by the courts to determine if the manner in which <b>a</b> <b>law</b> classifies a group of persons is discriminatory. The equality guaranteed by the provision is a relative and not an absolute concept; it does not require that all persons are treated alike, but rather that all persons in like situations should be treated alike. Consequently, <b>a</b> <b>law</b> that differentiates between classes of persons is valid and constitutional provided that there is some difference in circumstances, and the factor which the legislature adopts as constituting the dissimilarity in circumstances is not purely arbitrary but bears a reasonable relation to the legislative object of the law. If there is no such relationship, the difference is discriminatory and the impugned legislation is unconstitutional and invalid.|$|E
