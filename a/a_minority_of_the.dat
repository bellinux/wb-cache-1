5|$|A {{person with}} Tourette's has about a 50% chance of passing the gene(s) {{to one of}} his or her children, but Tourette's is a {{condition}} of variable expression and incomplete penetrance. Thus, not everyone who inherits the genetic vulnerability will show symptoms; even close family members may show different severities of symptoms, or no symptoms at all. The gene(s) may express as Tourette's, as a milder tic disorder (provisional or chronic tics), or as obsessive–compulsive symptoms without tics. Only <b>a</b> <b>minority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> children who inherit the gene(s) have symptoms severe enough to require medical attention. Gender appears to have a role in the expression of the genetic vulnerability: males are more likely than females to express tics.|$|E

Alaska has {{the most}} national forest land with 21.9 million acres (8.9 million ha), followed by California (20.8 million acres, 8.4 million ha) and Idaho (20.4 million acres, 8.3 million ha). Idaho also has the greatest percent of its land in national forests with 38.2%, followed by Oregon with 24.7% and Colorado with 20.9%.

5|$|In the 1980s, <b>a</b> <b>minority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> club's {{supporters}} had {{a reputation}} as one of Britain's most prominent casuals groups, the Aberdeen Soccer Casuals. The rise of the Aberdeen Casuals coincided with the most successful period in the club's history, and has been chronicled in more than one published account. Whilst numbers have steadily declined with the introduction of Football Banning Orders preventing hooligans from travelling to games, the Aberdeen Casuals still appear at big fixtures often away from home and in the UEFA Europa League. There were clashes at both fixtures against FC Groningen in 2014, as well as 13 arrests after violent clashes with Dundee United fans at a game in December 2015.|$|E
5|$|Not all mating {{takes place}} at the lek, since only <b>a</b> <b>minority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> males attend an active lek. As {{alternative}} strategies, males can also directly pursue females ("following") or wait for them as they approached good feeding sites ("intercepting"). Males switched between the three tactics, being more likely to attend a lek when the copulation rate the previous day was high or when fewer females were available after nesting had started. Lekking rates were low in cold weather early in the season when off-lek males spent most of their time feeding.|$|E

5|$|The Flavian period {{also saw}} the first {{formation}} of large, double-size units, both infantry and cavalry, of a nominal strength of 1,000 men (cohors/ala milliaria), though they were actually mostly smaller (720 for an ala milliaria and 800 for a cohors milliaria). These were the {{mirror image of the}} double-strength first cohorts of legions also introduced at this time.

5|$|Although {{the plan}} was {{theoretically}} sound, it was ineffective in stimulating economic growth. During Diem's time, there was little meaningful economic investment or development of infrastructure. The businessmen mostly used the import subsidies to purchase consumer goods such as boats, motorbikes, refrigerators, radios, music systems and other similar goods, which were luxuries at the time. The program was thus effective in expanding {{the size of the}} urban middle class, but it did not generate much economic investment. Only <b>a</b> <b>minority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> purchases were of capital goods such as manufacturing equipment and supplies for factory production. As a result, not much of the subsidies created more economic production. The government funds generated from selling importing licenses also became a problem, with corruption and explicit theft dogging its effectiveness as a means of bankrolling the military and civil service. In addition, some government officials would not sell the coveted licenses to the businessmen until a bribe was paid. Another criticism of the CIP was that the funds collected by the government were not used for any significant amount of government-sector economic investment but mainly to fund the army. Diem defended this by stating that national security was paramount.|$|E
5|$|Artemisinin is a {{sesquiterpene}} lactone {{containing a}} peroxide group, which {{is believed to}} be essential for its anti-malarial activity. Its derivatives, artesunate and artemether, have been used in clinics since 1987 for the treatment of drug-resistant and drug-sensitive malaria, especially cerebral malaria. These drugs are characterized by fast action, high efficacy and good tolerance. They kill the asexual forms of P. berghei and P. cynomolgi and have transmission-blocking activity. In 1985, Zhou Yiqing and his team combined artemether and lumefantrine into a single tablet, which was registered as a medicine in China in 1992. Later it became known as “Coartem”. Artemisinin combination treatments (ACTs) are now widely used to treat uncomplicated falciparum malaria, but access to ACTs is still limited in most malaria-endemic countries and only <b>a</b> <b>minority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patients who need artemisinin-based combination treatments receive them.|$|E

5|$|Despite a large {{expansion}} of the prison system, the problem of overcrowding remained throughout the 20th century, as did Western Australia's high incarceration rate relative {{to the rest of}} Australia. The nature of prisoners changed, with three times the proportion of 16- to 19-year-olds in 1984 compared to 1898, and a growing over-representation of Aboriginal prisoners to nearly half the incarcerated population. Sentences also increased in length, such that in 1984 more than 80% of inmates were serving more than a year. In the 1970s and 1980s, there was an increasing number of people committed for violent crimes, but still <b>a</b> <b>minority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population. Both staff and prisoners, however, perceived a notable increase in violence during these years, coinciding with the rise of illegal drugs in prison, and of sentences for drug-related offences.|$|E
5|$|Hibernian {{are one of}} {{only two}} {{full-time}} professional football clubs in Edinburgh, which is the capital of and second largest city in Scotland. The club had the fourth largest average attendance in the Scottish leagues during the 2016–17 season, with 15,394. This was a significant increase on recent seasons, inspired by the Scottish Cup victory in 2016. In the period after the Second World War, Hibs attracted average attendances in excess of 20,000, peaking at 31,567 in the 1951–52 season. Since Easter Road was redeveloped into an all-seater stadium in the mid-1990s, average attendance has varied between a high of 15,394 in 2016–17 and a low of 9,150 in 2003–04.

5|$|In 1931, the MacDonald Government faced {{a serious}} crisis, as the May Report {{revealed}} that the budget was unbalanced, with an expected shortfall of £120million. As this information became public, there was a run on the pound, depleting the nation's gold reserves. The Labour Party refused to consider the massive cuts in unemployment compensation which {{would be needed to}} balance the budget, and Prime Minister MacDonald sought support from outside his party. With Baldwin on holiday in France, Chamberlain negotiated for the Conservatives. Chamberlain told MacDonald that the Conservatives would only join a coalition if the full recommended cuts in unemployment compensation were made. Finally, on 24 August 1931, the Labour Government resigned and MacDonald formed a National Government, supported by most Conservative and Liberal MPs and <b>a</b> <b>minority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Labour Party. Chamberlain once more returned to the Ministry of Health. The National Government was intended as only a temporary expedient, but governed Britain until Chamberlain's fall in 1940. In the ensuing General Election, the National Government won 554 of the 615seats in the House of Commons, with 473 of its supporters Conservative MPs.|$|E

5|$|In 1972, {{the company}} {{collected}} NOK3.07 million in tolls, 21% more than estimated. By 1977, the annual income had reached NOK5.03 million, which was up 28% from the estimates. From 1978, the tolls for people were removed, resulting in about NOK1 million less revenue per year. One {{of the reasons}} for the removal of passenger tolls was the extra time used to count passengers, which increased the queues at the toll plaza, and that the company's debt would be covered anyway, even without the extra revenue. From 1 January 1981, scheduled buses were also exempt from tolls, under the condition that the funds saved were used by the bus companies to strengthen public transport on Sotra. From 1980, there was disagreement within the company as to whether the toll period should be extended to increase the subsidies to projects on Sotra and Øygarden, or if an as short as possible collection period was desirable. The board decided to terminate toll collections from 31 December 1983. <b>A</b> <b>minority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> owners wanted to extend the period for another two years, which would have given an estimated additional NOK20 million.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, 76–77 {{per cent}} of output by value was {{livestock}} farming and, although this {{has fallen to}} about 64 per cent since 1990, arable farming remains <b>a</b> <b>minority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sector and two-thirds of agricultural land is rough pasture. One result is that chemicalisation and arable-based subsidies have had less impact on Scottish biodiversity than {{is the case in}} England where farming is overwhelmingly arable. The UK membership of the European Economic Community (later the European Union) in 1972 began a re-orientation for Scottish farming. A preference for Commonwealth markets was replaced by EU obligations. Agriculture became dominated by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the EU, which made farming dependent on market support and direct grants to farmers. As a result, some sectors, particularly hill sheep farming, became viable only with subsidies. Eight-four per cent of Scottish land qualified for extra support as a Less Favoured Area (LFA), but 80 per cent of the payments were going to only 20 per cent of the farmers, mainly large commercial arable farms in the Lowlands. A series of reforms to the CAP from the 1990s attempted to control over-production, limit incentives for intensive farming and mitigate environmental damage. As part of an attempt to mitigate the depopulation and commercialisation of Scottish farming, the Crofting Act of 1976 made it easier for crofters to buy their farms, but most were insufficient to support a family, and many small farmers turned to fish farming and tourism to supplement their incomes. A dual farm structure has emerged with agriculture divided between large commercial farms and small pluralised and diversified holdings. Scotland has the highest average farm size in the European Union, almost ten times the average.|$|E
