40|$|<b>Anti-fouling</b> <b>biocide</b> {{zinc pyrithione}} (ZnPT) and its {{biological}} fate have received little attention because this compound was assumed {{not to be}} persistent in marine ecosystems. We developed an analytical procedure {{that proved to be}} efficient and very sensitive in extracting ZnPT and its main secondary products, zinc and ionized PT‾, from both seawater and biological samples, namely in gills and digestive gland of the bioindicator species Mytilus galloprovincialis. Short-term experiments were carried out to investigate ZnPT toxicity and bioaccumulation. The effects on survival and the tissue bioaccumulation of ZnPT and its secondary products were studied on adult mussels from a natural population, collected inside the harbour area of Porto Santo Stefano (Italy) and exposed to sublethal doses of the biocide up to 7 days. ZnPT was shown to be persistent in experimental seawater in the short term. A basal level of ZnPT and ionized PT‾ was detected in mussels, indicating that ZnPT availability in the sampling site is already high enough to induce a detectable accumulation in individuals of the native population. ZnPT rapidly accumulated in tissues of the exposed mussels, proportionately to both exposure concentration and time, identifying the gills and the digestive gland as important targets in the biological path of the contaminants. Even though the 7 day-LC 50 = 8. 27 µM established here appears high with respect to reported ZnPT environmental concentrations, our results indicate that this biocide could represent a threat for marine organisms in coastal environments and that further investigations on its biological effects at sublethal doses are needed...|$|E
40|$|The {{addition}} of biocides to water systems {{has been the}} most direct attempt to limit or mitigate the formation of surface biofilms that lead to the development of microbial-induced corrosion (MIC), a process that costs industry millions of pounds annually. The efficacy of this approach is dependent upon a) the biocide being delivered to all water-metal substrate interaction sites and b) the biocide remaining active, therein preventing biofilm development/growth. <b>Anti-fouling</b> <b>biocide</b> additions to water supplies, or anti-fungal additives in paints, have an adverse impact upon the environment, for example, tri-butyl tin is toxic to aquatic life. An alternative non-toxic approach currently being pursued by the authors involves localizing a biologically active reagent close to the metal substrate. Localization in this case is achieved by synthesizing a hybrid functional sol-gel coating and encapsulating a suitable non-pathogenic biological component within the sol-gel matrix. Distribution within the sol-gel coating of vegetative bacteria or spores has been confirmed using various microscopy techniques. Electrochemical data in the form of polarization resistance, impedance spectroscopy, and electrochemical noise all show that the presence of either P. fragi or P. polymyxa within a sot-gel coating leads to a corrosion resistance improvement at least 10 times that of an equivalent abiotic coating. Confirmation of this improvement is derived from six months of field trial testing conducted in a tidal estuarine environment. Comparative tests that use a control sol-gel coating immersed within nutrient poor artificial seawater that contained freely suspended R polymyxa reveal no marked improvement over a control sample {{in the absence of the}} endospores...|$|E
40|$|The <b>anti-fouling</b> <b>biocide</b> {{zinc pyrithione}} (ZnPT) was {{recently}} demonstrated {{to be more}} persistent than expected in the coastal environment, {{and to have a}} potential for bioaccumulation. We investigated the occurrence of adverse effects in the marine mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis when exposed to non-lethal concentrations of the contaminant (0. 2 and 0. 4 µM ZnPT), {{through the use of a}} battery of biomarkers from the molecular to the individual level. In particular, the expression of HSP 27, HSP 60, HSP 70 and the presence of genotoxic damage were investigated in the gills and digestive gland of mussels by means of Western Blot and TUNEL procedures, respectively. In addition, a stress on stress response test was performed in order to highlight a possible general stress conditions in the exposed bivalves. A concentration of 0. 2 µM ZnPT was found sufficient to trigger a marked stress response in gills and digestive gland, and a dose-dependent HSP expression was highlighted. Moreover, at the tested concentrations, ZnPT was found able to induce genotoxic effects, as demonstrated by an amplified DNA fragmentation (up to + 37 % of TUNEL positive cells in comparison to the control group) and by an increased frequency of apoptotic cells (up to + 5 %) in the tissues of the exposed mussels. In addition, the stress on stress response test demonstrated a heavily decreased tolerance to anoxic conditions in mussels exposed to the higher tested concentration of the biocide (LT 50 = 5. 4 days) compared to the control individuals (LT 50 = 10. 7 days). Multivariate analyses highlighted a strong correspondence between the observed biological effects in M. galloprovincialis, HSP over-expression and DNA damage in the gills and digestive gland, and the bioaccumulation levels of the biocide. Data presented here indicate the need for further investigations on the ZnPT effects on the key species of marine coastal communities, with the aim of obtaining the necessary information for a sound risk assessment of the impact of this new antifoulant on marine ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|A {{bioassay}} method {{using the}} early life stages (germlings) of macroalgae {{was developed to}} detect toxicity of <b>anti-fouling</b> paint <b>biocides.</b> A laboratory based bioassay using Ulva intestinalis and Fucus spiralis germlings was performed with 4 common <b>anti-fouling</b> <b>biocides</b> (tributyltin (TBT), Irgarol 1051, Diuron and zinc sulphate), over a range of environmentally relevant concentrations (0. 0033 - 10 lg l 1). Comparison between the two species showed that germlings of U. intestinalis were better adapted for in-situ monitoring, as germlings of F. spiralis appeared to be too robust to display sufficient growth differences. The response of U. intestinalis germling growth appeared to reflect environmental biocide concentrations. Overall the developed method showed potential {{for the assessment of}} the sub-lethal effects of antifouling biocides on the early developmental stages of U. intestinalis...|$|R
40|$|The {{toxicity}} of the <b>anti-fouling</b> <b>biocides</b> tributyltin (TBTO), copper, and Irgarol 1051 (irgarol) at nominal concentrations ranging from 10 to 10000 μg 1 - 1 was investigated against {{the speed of}} encystment and successful formation of a protective cyst of the cercariae of Parorchis acanthus. For all biocide exposures, cercariae had a much slower rate of encystment and reduced cyst formation than controls. Exposure of the snail host Nucella lapillus for 7 d caused complete cessation of cercarial shedding in irgarol-exposed snails but {{had no effect on}} cercarial encystment from TBTO and copper-exposed snails. The mechanisms of {{toxicity of}} the biocides are briefly discussed. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Vessel {{anti-fouling}} {{is key to}} {{the efficient}} operation of ships, and essential for effective control of invasive species introduced through international shipping. Anti-Fouling Systems, however, pose their own threats to marine environments. The Anti-Fouling Convention of 2001 banned the use of organotin compounds such as Tributyltin, and created a system for adoption of alternative <b>anti-fouling</b> <b>biocides.</b> In 2011, the Marine Environmental Protection Committee of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) released guidelines on bio-fouling management record keeping, installation, inspection, cleaning, maintenance, design and construction. Though these Guidelines provide a template for more effective and environmentally sound anti-fouling control and implementation, they are not mandatory. This article proposes that the member states of the IMO adopt the 2011 Guidelines as a mandatory instrument...|$|R
40|$|The {{toxicity}} of the <b>anti-fouling</b> <b>biocides</b> tributyltin (TBTO), copper, and Irgarol 1051 (irgarol) at a nominal concentration of 10 μg/l over a 30 day period were investigated against {{the viability of}} metacercarial cysts of the digenean parasite Echinoparyphium recurvatum resident within the body of two common freshwater snails, Lymnaea peregra and Physa fontinalis. Reduced parasite viability was found under most exposures in both snail species. However a greater effect of toxicant exposure was found in cysts within P. fontinalis compared to those in L. peregra. This was {{associated with an increased}} mortality of the host snail. Among all tested biocides, TBTO exposures induced the highest mortality to both the parasite and their hosts. These results suggest that parasite viability is interlinked with survival of the host snail. The mechanisms of differing toxicity between host species and its relevance to successful parasite transmission to the next host are discussed. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Organotin {{compounds}} {{have been}} used in marine <b>anti-fouling</b> paints as <b>biocides.</b> Because tunicates are vulnerable to these compounds in their natural habitats, we used Ciona intestinalis to establish an assay for phagocytosis in vitro of yeast by hemocytes after exposure to different concentrations (0. 0015, 0. 015, 0. 15 and 1. 5 μM) of four organotin compounds: tributyltin (TBT), triphenyltin (TPT), dibutyltin (DBT) and diphenyltin (DPT). To evaluate the phagocytic activity, we used a method based on fluorescence excitation of yeasts pre-treated with eosin-Y. The percentage of phagocytosis decreased from 45. 1 ± 3. 49 to 22. 4 ± 5. 14 at 1. 5 μM of TBT (P < 0. 001); it was significantly reduced in presence of the ionophore A 23187. TPT, DPT and DBT did not show significant effects on phagocytosis. Because the effect of TBT was irreversible, differences between the inhibitory mechanisms of ionophore and TBT are suggested. These results indicate that for future analyses, tunicates should become excellent models for dissecting events such as phagocytosis that are associated with immunosuppression after exposure to xenobiotics. © 1995...|$|R
