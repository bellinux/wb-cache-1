However, after Dwane Casey's firing after the Twolves' 40th game (when they had a record of 20–20), the Twolves struggled, yet the young star played well when given minutes. In March, Foye saw nearly 24 minutes of playing time <b>a</b> <b>night,</b> <b>and</b> in April saw almost 27 minutes a night to perform.|$|E
25|$|The {{second stage}} show was {{performed}} throughout Wales between 15January and 23February 1980. This was {{a production of}} Clwyd Theatr Cymru, and was directed by Jonathan Petherbridge. The company performed adaptations of complete radio episodes, at times doing two episodes in <b>a</b> <b>night,</b> <b>and</b> at other times doing all six episodes of the first series in single three-hour sessions. This adaptation was performed again at the Oxford Playhouse in December 1981,the Bristol Hippodrome, Plymouth's Theatre Royal in May–June 1982, and also at the Belgrade Theatre, Coventry, in July 1983.|$|E
25|$|Though Carson's {{program was}} based in Burbank {{beginning}} in 1972, NBC's editing and production services for the program were located in New York, resulting in the requirement that Carson's program be transmitted from Burbank to New York. In 1976, NBC used the Satcom 2 satellite to do this, feeding the live taping (which usually {{took place in the}} early evening) directly to New York, where it would be edited prior to the normal broadcast. This live feed lasted usually from two to two-and-a-half hours <b>a</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> was uncensored and commercial-free. During the commercial breaks, the audio and picture would be left on, capturing at times risqué language and other events that would certainly be edited out later going out over the feed.|$|E

25|$|Great Desert: It {{lies between}} Calormen and the {{northern}} countries of Archenland and Narnia. Located immediately {{to the north of}} the Carlomen capital Tashbaan, the desert can be crossed on horseback in about <b>a</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> a day of hard riding. The desert provides some protection from Calormen invasion since the springs at the great oasis would not be sufficient to enable an army of any size to cross it. This oasis is halfway across the desert; however a secret and well watered valley leads into Archenland. The desert is described as an ocean of sand by Narnians. It can be bypassed by sea as the Calormenes do in The Last Battle. The Hermit of the Southern March lives north of it. Beyond it is Anvard and Narnia.(HHB)(LB).|$|E
25|$|Miles first ordered only Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Henry J. Madill's brigade {{to attack}} Cooke's and Hyman's (Galloway's) positions. Madill's men were {{exhausted}} from <b>a</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> morning of marching and Madill himself was severely wounded as the Confederates repulsed the assault. Then, Miles ordered {{an attack on}} MacRae's and McGowan's positions again with Colonel Madill's brigade, now {{under the command of}} Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Clinton McDougall and Colonel Robert Nugent's brigade. The two brigades again were repulsed with Colonel McDougall being wounded. After an interval to regroup, Miles's division finally overcame the Confederate right flank defenders with an attack at 4:00p.m. by a strong skirmish line, MacDougall's and Nugent's brigades and Lieutenant Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) John Ramsey's brigade. The Union attackers captured 600 prisoners, two guns and a battle flag.|$|E
25|$|During {{the winter}} of 1915–16 the 1/7th Londons carried out regular tours of duty in the Loos sector. losing {{a steady stream of}} {{casualties}} to artillery and mine attacks. In March 1916 the 47th Division took over part of the Vimy sector {{on the west side of}} the Vimy Ridge. On 21 May 140 Bde (temporarily under the command of Col Faux of the 1/7th) was subjected to a heavy bombardment, and the Germans attacked in the evening. The weight of the attack fell on 1/7th and 1/8th Londons, who were forced back from their front and support lines halfway down the slope. 1/7th made a local counter-attack, but it was too weak to succeed. After <b>a</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> day of confusion, the 1/6th and 1/7th Bns pushed forward 250 yards to reoccupy an old French trench which they consolidated and thereby prevented any further enemy advance. They were relieved in the evening of 22 May, having suffered heavy casualties.|$|E

500|$|In 1961–62, the NBA's three highest scoring averages were {{by black}} players (Chamberlain, Baylor, Walt Bellamy).

[...] "People heard about Wilt scoring a 100, averaging 50 <b>a</b> <b>night,</b> <b>and</b> {{they wanted to see}} the guy do it ... I believe Wilt Chamberlain single-handedly saved the league."

She describes an incident when, after Melissa found pictures of a man's grandchildren in his wallet, they realized he was old enough to be their own grandfather. [...] "I wanted to die," [...] she says, close to tears.

500|$|The new candle {{sustained}} {{some minor}} damage over its first few years. On November 20, 1970, heavy rain and inclement weather snapped a wire helping keep the structure in place, and firefighters had to install additional braces the next day. Also that year, about 75 lights {{were stolen from}} the decorative Christmas trees set up around the candle's base. In 1971, the building where the Peace Candle was stored was broken into and the fiberglass paneling was vandalized. Easton officials {{declined to discuss the}} extent of the damage, but Henry Schultz dismissed the vandals as [...] "kids". In 1974, the Peace Candle was only lit a few hours <b>a</b> <b>night,</b> <b>and</b> not at all on some nights, due to an ongoing energy crisis, which prompted the Metropolitan Edison Company to ask its Easton area customers not to use Christmas lights that year. Since the Peace Candle was seldom lit, charitable donations dropped in 1974, resulting in an $800 defect for the Easton Area Christmas Committee. Additionally the committee [...] spent $1,700 in Peace Candle Christmas cards meant to bring in donations, but only 500 packs were sold at $1 each. The use of less electricity to light the Peace Candle did not help the committee because the city paid the lighting bill.|$|E
500|$|Development of Super Meat Boy {{began in}} January 2009. Initially {{announced}} for WiiWare and PC, {{the game was}} set {{to be released in}} the first quarter of 2010. The release date was pushed back to the fourth quarter because the developers wanted more time to create extra levels, such as the dark worlds. A picture released on Team Meat's Twitter page on February 22, 2010, revealed that the game would also be released for XBLA. The next day, they announced that, while all versions would be released in the same month, the game would be released for XBLA first due to [...] "contractual obligations". In August 2010, the developers were contacted by Microsoft with the prospect of inclusion in Microsoft's 2010 Fall GameFeast XBLA promotion two months later. As they were almost out of money, they did not believe that they could financially support themselves until the Spring event, but felt they had four months' worth of work left to complete on the game. For the final two months of development they worked daily, slept five hours <b>a</b> <b>night,</b> <b>and</b> frequently forgot to eat—a process that McMillen said he [...] "would never voluntarily go through" [...] again. According to McMillen, due to Microsoft's low expectations for the game, Super Meat Boy was lightly promoted. The level of promotion was not increased during the GameFeast, though the game greatly outsold the rest of the games in the event. The team described the effort required to finish the game for the promotion as [...] "by far the biggest mistake [...] made during SMB's development". Their development struggle is depicted in the documentary [...] The game was released on XBLA in October 2010 and on PCs via Steam and Direct2Drive a month later. McMillen noted that the PC release was more heavily promoted than the XBLA version. A version for Mac OS X was released in November 2011, while another version for Linux operating systems was released in December 2011 as part of the Humble Indie Bundle #4 game pack.|$|E

2500|$|After his rescue, Jonah obeys {{the call}} to prophesy against Nineveh, causing {{the people of the}} city to repent and God to forgive them. Jonah is furious, however, and angrily tells God that this is the reason he tried to flee from Him, as he knew Him to be a just and merciful God. He then beseeches God to kill him, a request which is denied when God causes a tree to grow over him, giving him shade. Initially grateful, Jonah's anger returns the next day, when God sends a worm to eat the plant, {{withering}} it, and he tells God {{that it would be better}} if he were dead. God then points out: [...] "You are concerned about the bush, for which you did not labour and which you did not grow; it came into being in <b>a</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> perished in <b>a</b> <b>night.</b> <b>And</b> should I not be concerned about Nineveh, that great city, in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand people who do not know their right hand from their left, and also many animals?
