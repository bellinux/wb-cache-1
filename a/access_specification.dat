40|$|Abstract. The {{interoperability}} {{among different}} data formats over the Internet has drawn increasing interest recently due to {{more and more}} heterogeneous data models are used in different Web services. In order to ease the manipulation of data models for heterogeneous data, generic model management has been intensively researched and also implemented in a prototype since its first introduction. <b>Access</b> control <b>specifications</b> attached to each individual data model require significant amount of efforts to manually specify. Based on a general security model for <b>access</b> control <b>specifications</b> on heterogeneous data models and its visual representation, we present secure model management operators for managing <b>access</b> control <b>specifications.</b> The secure model management operators disccussed in the paper include a secure match operator and a secure merge operator. We introduce a novel graphical schema matching algorithm and extend the algorithm to make a secure match operator. The paper also discusses secure merge principles for the integration of data models. ...|$|R

The newly published specifications address a number of features including solution for address collision when connecting two home or small business networks together, provisioning of remote access services, network address translation, and the concept of virtual device that allows multiple devices or services to be exposed to a remote home or small business network under the framework of a single device.

40|$|Access {{is a new}} {{algebraic}} specification formalism, which focuses on the fine description of the ``true'' concurrency and on {{a high degree of}} expressivity. Systems are specified by a set of local states, whose value changes under the occurrence of events. Both events and data structure are specified by abstract data types. Static properties, i. e. global constraints over events and data structure, are described by first order formulae, while dynamic axioms, explaining the behavior of events, are given by causality rules. Concurrency can be described in different ways, it can be interleaving or true concurrency. Finally, expressivity is given by fine descriptions of both static and dynamic properties. Access has demonstrate to be a natural generalization of a great variety of Petri Nets (as for example -Algebraic, -Coloured, -With arc extensions Petri Nets). It is also able to capture concepts from other formalisms as Gamma language or CO-OPN.

Different kinds of performance indices {{have been developed}} and tested with simulation models and offline process data before implementing them in real automation system or performance monitoring tool.

The model consists of access control policies specified over DTDs with XPath expression for data-dependent access control policies.
