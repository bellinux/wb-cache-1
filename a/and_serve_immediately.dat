This type of dish is usually served as an appetizer at bars or restaurants in the United States and elsewhere, though they generally tend to be as sizable as a meal. Typically, the tortilla chips are arranged on a platter, meat and refried bean toppings are then added, and the entire platter is smothered with shredded cheese. The platter is then put into a broiler or microwave to cause the cheese to melt. The platter is then covered with the cold toppings (shredded lettuce, tomatoes, salsa, jalapeños, etc.) <b>and</b> <b>served</b> <b>immediately.</b>|$|R
50|$|Chicken marsala is an Italian-American dish {{made from}} chicken cutlets, mushrooms, and Marsala wine. It is a {{variation}} of traditional Italian scaloppina dishes, {{of which there are}} many varieties throughout Italy. The dish dates to the 19th century, when it most likely originated with English families who lived in western Sicily, where Marsala wine is produced. The chicken is coated in flour, briefly sautéed, and then removed from the pan, which is then used to make a Marsala reduction sauce. The sauce is made by reducing the wine to nearly the consistency of a syrup while adding onions or shallots, as well as mushrooms, herbs and possibly other ingredients. The sauce is then poured over the chicken, which has been kept in a warming oven, <b>and</b> <b>served</b> <b>immediately.</b>|$|R

This thesis is presented as {{a collection of short stories}} that are seemingly independent from one another imitating the separate layers of a halo-halo as it is assembled. The collection includes a halo-halo recipe that acts as an introduction. The historical foundations of the research project are then presented in the form of a childrens story dedicated to my firstborn. A transcript of correspondence detailing an exchange with a family in the Philippines who accepted my charity illustrates themes of colonial history and politics. A recount of a personal experience with the folklore of the Philippines allows for the discussion of sociological literature surrounding second-generation migrants. The collection is concluded with a letter to my son that addresses his ethnic heritage and hints towards further research in globalization and the changing face of Australia. The overarching themes of cultural plurality, displacement and acceptance prompts the mixing process and the consumption of these themes result in the works produced. Each painting, each mouthful, is a combination of all the elements mixed together; a halo-halo of cultures, ideas and techniques...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} service {{differentiation}} and admission control in web services that utilize a multi-tier architecture is more challenging {{than in a}} single-tiered one, especially {{in the presence of}} bursty conditions, i. e., when arrivals of user web sessions to the system are characterized by temporal surges in their arrival intensities and demands. We demonstrate that classic techniques for a session based admission control that are triggered by threshold violations are ineffective under bursty workload conditions, as user-perceived performance metrics rapidly and dramatically deteriorate, inadvertently leading the system to reject requests from already accepted user sessions, resulting in business loss. Here, as a solution for service differentiation of accepted user sessions we promote a methodology that is based on blocking, i. e., when the system operates in overload, requests from accepted sessions are not rejected but are instead stored in a blocking queue that effectively acts as a waiting room. The requests in the blocking queue implicitly become of higher priority <b>and</b> are <b>served</b> <b>immediately</b> after load subsides. Residence in the blocking queue comes with a performance cost as blocking time adds to the perceived end-to-end user response time. We present a novel autonomic session based admission control policy, called AWAIT, that adaptively adjusts the capacity of the blocking queue as a function of workload burstiness in order to meet predefined user service level objectives while keeping the portion of aborted accepted sessions to a minimum. Detailed simulations illustrate the effectiveness of AWAIT under different workload burstiness profiles and therefore strongly argue for its effectiveness. ...|$|R

The game lasted for ten minutes before Federer broke Nadal with a forehand winner to level the opening set at 1-1. Federer held serve with another forehand winner to get to 2-1. Nadal held comfortably to reach 2-2. In the fifth game at 30-30, Nadal's forehand was out but the linesman didn't call it. Federer challenged and the Hawkeye review showed the ball was long, giving Federer 40-30 instead of break point to Nadal. Federer held at deuce to go ahead 3-2.|$|R
