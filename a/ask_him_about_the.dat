500|$|Nevertheless, Mulder and Scully {{visit the}} care home where Roland lives. When they gently <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{night of the}} murder, he tells them {{he had not seen}} {{anything}} out of the ordinary. He also inadvertently reveals his mathematical prowess by rapidly counting the star designs visible on Scully's blouse; however, his handwriting does not match the fourth sample taken from the whiteboard. The discussion ends when Roland experiences a violent vision and has {{what seems to be a}} fit. Later that night, Roland has another vision in which he sees someone killing Keats. He appears at the lab and murders Keats by submerging his head in a tank of liquid nitrogen. Keats' frozen body is left to shatter as Roland begins typing at one of the computers.|$|E
500|$|As {{shown in}} [...] "The Impossible Astronaut", the Doctor joins his friends at Lake Silencio and then {{approaches}} the astronaut, now {{known to be}} a younger version of River Song, Amy and Rory's daughter, trained to kill the Doctor by the Silence and Madame Kovarian. River does not want to kill him but is unable to fight the suit's control, and the Doctor says he forgives her and reminds her that the event is inevitable. River, despite his warning against interfering with a fixed point, surprises the Doctor by draining the astronaut suit's weapons systems and averting his death. Time becomes [...] "stuck" [...] as a result and begins to disintegrate; all of Earth's history begins to run simultaneously at a fixed moment of 5:02p.m. on 22 April 2011. In London, Holy Roman Emperor Winston Churchill takes the Doctor, his [...] "soothsayer", out from his locked cell to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> condition of time. The Doctor explains the preceding events, as tally marks begin appearing on his arms, indicating the presence of the Silence. After noticing a Silence nest overhead, they are rescued by Amy and a squad of soldiers under her command. Due to the effects of the crack in her bedroom, Amy is cognizant of the altered timeline, though she is unaware that her trusted captain is her husband Rory. Amy takes the Doctor to [...] "Area 52", a hollowed-out Giza pyramid, where they have captured over a hundred Silence and Madame Kovarian. River is also there; aware of the consequences of her actions, she refuses to allow the Doctor to touch her, an event that would [...] "unfreeze" [...] time and allow it to resume. They all wear [...] "eyedrives", external memory eye patches which enable them to avoid the Silence's effect of erasing themselves from memory.|$|E
500|$|Former UCLA {{professor}} of information studies Philip E. Agre and journalist Eric Boehlert argued that three articles in Wired News {{led to the}} creation of the widely spread urban legend that Gore claimed to have [...] "invented the Internet", which followed this interview. In addition, computer professionals and congressional colleagues argued in his defense. Internet pioneers Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn stated that [...] "we don't think, as some people have argued, that Gore intended to claim he 'invented' the Internet. Moreover, there is no question in our minds that while serving as Senator, Gore's initiatives had a significant and beneficial effect on the still-evolving Internet." [...] Cerf would later state: [...] "Al Gore had seen what happened with the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of 1956, which his father introduced as a military bill. It was very powerful. Housing went up, suburban boom happened, everybody became mobile. Al was attuned to the power of networking much more than any of his elective colleagues. His initiatives led directly to the commercialization of the Internet. So he really does deserve credit." [...] In a speech to the American Political Science Association, former Republican Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Newt Gingrich also stated: [...] "In all fairness, it's something Gore had worked on a long time. Gore is not the Father of the Internet, but in all fairness, Gore is the person who, in the Congress, most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an Internet, and the truth is—and I worked with him starting in 1978 when I got , we were both part of a [...] "futures group"—the fact is, in the Clinton administration, the world we had talked about in the '80s began to actually happen." [...] Finally, Wolf Blitzer (who conducted the original 1999 interview) stated in 2008 that: [...] "I didn't <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Internet. I asked him about the differences he had with Bill Bradley [...] Honestly, at the time, when he said it, it didn't dawn on me that this was going to have the impact that it wound up having, because it was distorted to a certain degree and people said they took what he said, which was a carefully phrased comment about taking the initiative and creating the Internet to—I invented the Internet. And that was the sort of shorthand, the way his enemies projected it and it wound up being a devastating setback to him and it hurt him, as I'm sure he acknowledges to this very day." ...|$|E

2500|$|In July 2009, Coppola was put {{on trial}} for murder, {{racketeering}} and extorting the Local 1235 of the International Longshoremen's Association for over 30 years. If found guilty of all counts, he could have faced life imprisonment. Defense lawyer Henry Mazurek told jurors that Coppola admitted to making a [...] "rash" [...] decision to flee, but that it didn't prove he's a killer. [...] "He didn't want to stand trial for a murder he didn't commit," [...] Mazurek said. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jack Dennehy told the jury not to be fooled by Coppola's claims and that Coppola [...] "ran because he didn't want to face a jury like you. He hid because he didn't want to face a jury like you." [...] Thomas Riccardi testified that Coppola {{said he did not}} agree with the Lardiere murder, but that he followed the orders given to him by Tino Fiumara (who was never charged). Genovese family member turned government witness George Barone was also called to aid the prosecution. Barone was such a difficult witness that the prosecutor apparently decided not to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Lardiere murder.|$|E

2500|$|The witness, Arthur Calgary, who {{was unaware}} of the events and thus failed to come forward and not {{otherwise}} locateable by the police, believed the family would be grateful once he cleared their son's name. He failed to realize the full implications of the information he provides. However, once he does so, he is determined to protect the innocent by finding the murderer. To be able to do so, he visits the retired local doctor, Dr MacMaster, to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> now-cleared murderer, Jacko Argyle. MacMaster states that he was surprised when Jacko killed his mother. Not because he thought that murder was outside Jacko's 'moral range', but because he thought Jacko would be too cowardly to kill somebody himself; that, if he wanted to murder somebody, he would egg on an accomplice to do his dirty work. MacMaster says [...] "the kind of murder I'd have expected Jacko to do, if he did one, was the type where a couple of boys go out on a raid; then, when the police come after them, the Jackos say 'Biff him on the head, Bud. Let him have it. Shoot him down.' They're willing for murder, ready to incite to murder, but they've not got the nerve to do murder themselves with their own hands." [...] This description seems to be a reference to the Craig and Bentley case which had occurred in 1952.|$|E
