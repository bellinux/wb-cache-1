50|$|By the {{standards}} of the 2010s, early 1980s desktop publishing was a primitive affair. Users of the PageMaker-LaserWriter-Macintosh 512K system endured frequent software crashes, cramped display on the Mac's tiny 512 x 342 1-bit <b>monochrome</b> <b>screen,</b> the inability to control letter-spacing, kerning, and other typographic features, and discrepancies between the screen display and printed output. However, it was a revolutionary combination at the time, and was received with considerable acclaim.|$|R

5000|$|Duke Nukem 3D (Game.com) was {{released}} in 1997 in the USA only. Unlike every other version of the game, Duke Nukem cannot turn; he can only move forward, backward, and strafe {{to the left or}} right. Due to the Game.com's <b>monochrome</b> <b>screen,</b> it is also the only version to lack color. It only includes four levels from each of the original three episodes for a total of 12 levels. These levels were modified to accommodate Duke Nukem's inability to turn.|$|R

25|$|The {{earliest}} test models used screens only a {{few inches}} across and had the guns arranged almost at right angles to it, making for a very large tube. Later models were built inside very large Hackbridge-Hewittic (H-H) vacuum tubes, which the company originally designed for use as high-power rectifiers in power supplies. Arthur Johnson, a glass blower who had previously worked for both Baird and H-H, produced the new models. These had screens ten inches across, comparable to <b>monochrome</b> <b>screens</b> of the era. The guns fired upward at about a 45 degree angle. As in the teapot tube, the necks were very long.|$|R
50|$|Nintendo {{released}} the Game Boy on April 21, 1989 (September 1990 for the UK). The design team headed by Gunpei Yokoi {{had also been}} responsible for the Game & Watch system, as well as the Nintendo Entertainment System games Metroid and Kid Icarus. The Game Boy came under scrutiny by some industry critics, saying that the <b>monochrome</b> <b>screen</b> was too small, and the processing power was inadequate. The design team had felt that low initial cost and battery economy were more important concerns, and when compared to the Microvision, the Game Boy was a huge leap forward.|$|R
