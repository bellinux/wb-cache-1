40|$|In this paper, various {{harmonic}} {{characteristics of}} SVC 2 ̆ 7 s (Static Var Compensators) are discussed, comparison being made between symmetrical and <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>modulation</b> strategies which influence {{a quality of}} output waveform. It appears that the <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>modulation</b> strategy is the better approach in higher power factor applications such as ac motor drives. However, in a case requiring a passive filter, for example, with an extremely large scale SVC, a symmetrical modulation strategy is superior. Therefore, in this research, a symmetrical modulation is preferred for a NPC-PWM inverter. Since the harmonics, due to the switching appear in a limited narrow frequency band, such output harmonics can be easily eliminated using a simple passive filter. Furthermore, harmonics such as the fifth and the seventh can be suppressed using the proposed SVC scheme, in which the feedback signals for the fifth and seventh harmonics are injected into the SVC. Using these feedback signals, the harmonics in the power system can be significantly reduced. This result is confirmed by simulation. Thus, {{in addition to the}} proper operation of the SVC, it is possible to perform an active filtering function...|$|E

Then a comparison is drawn between the method under examination and another one with symmetrical modulation; it is shown {{that in some cases}} the former has advantageous results in that at a parity of estimate dispersion it demands a smaller number of components...|$|E
40|$|Observations of galactic {{cosmic rays}} (GCRs) from the two Voyager {{spacecraft}} inside the heliosheath indicate significant differences between them, suggesting {{that in addition to}} a possible global asymmetry in the north–south dimensions (meridional plane) of the heliosphere, {{it is also possible that}} different modulation (turbulence) conditions could exist between the two hemispheres of the heliosphere. We focus on illustrating the effects on GCR Carbon of <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>modulation</b> conditions combined with a heliosheath thickness that has a significant dependence on heliolatitude. To reflect different modulation conditions between the two heliospheric hemispheres in our numerical model, the enhancement of both polar and radial perpendicular diffusion off the ecliptic plane is assumed to differ from heliographic pole to pole. The computed radial GCR intensities at polar angles of 55 ° (approximating the Voyager 1 direction) and 125 ° (approximating the Voyager 2 direction) are compared at different energies and for both particle drift cycles. This is done in the context of illustrating how different values of the enhancement of both polar and radial perpendicular diffusion between the two hemispheres contribute to causing differences in radial intensities during solar minimum and moderate maximum conditions. We find that in the A > 0 cycle these differences between 55 ° and 125 ° change both quantitatively and qualitatively for the assumed <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>modulation</b> condition as reflected by polar diffusion, while in the A < 0 cycle, minute quantitative differences are obtained. However, when both polar and radial perpendicular diffusion have significant latitude dependences, major differences in radial intensities between the two polar angles are obtained in both polarity cycles. Furthermore, significant differences in radial intensity gradients obtained in the heliosheath at lower energies may suggest that the solar wind turbulence at and beyond the solar wind termination shock must have a larger latitudinal dependence...|$|E
40|$|Goubau {{line is a}} single-conductor {{transmission}} line, featuring easy {{integration and}} low-loss transmission properties. Here, we propose a periodic leaky-wave antenna (LWA) based on planar Goubau transmission line on a thin dielectric substrate. The leaky-wave radiations are generated by introducing periodic modulations along the Goubau line. In this way, the surface wave, which is slow-wave mode supported by the Goubau line, achieves an additional momentum and hence enters the fast-wave region for radiations. By employing the periodic modulations, the proposed Goubau line LWAs are able to continuously steer the main beam from backward to forward within the operational frequency range. However, the LWAs usually suffer from a low radiation efficiency at the broadside direction. To overcome this drawback, we explore both transversally and longitudinally <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>modulations</b> to the Goubau line. Theoretical analysis, numerical simulations and experimental results are given {{in comparison with the}} symmetrical LWAs. It is demonstrated that the <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>modulations</b> significantly improve the radiation efficiency of LWAs at the broadside. Furthermore, the measurement results agree well with the numerical ones, which experimentally validates the proposed LWA structures. These novel Goubau line LWAs, experimentally demonstrated and validated at microwave frequencies, show also great potential for millimeter-wave and terahertz systems...|$|R

40|$|Multiphase {{systems are}} {{nowadays}} considered for various industrial applications. Numerous {{pulse width modulation}} (PWM) schemes for multiphase voltage source inverters with sinusoidal outputs have been developed, but no {{detailed analysis of the}} impact of these modulation schemes on the output peak-to-peak current ripple amplitude has been reported. Determination of current ripple in multiphase PWM voltage source inverters is important for both design and control purposes. This paper gives the complete analysis of the peak-to-peak current ripple distribution over a fundamental period for multiphase inverters, with particular reference to seven-phase VSIs. In particular, peak-to-peak current ripple amplitude is analytically determined {{as a function of the}} modulation index, and a simplified expression to get its maximum value is carried out. Although reference is made to the centered symmetrical PWM, being the most simple and effective solution to maximize the DC bus utilization, leading to a nearly-optimal modulation to minimize the RMS of the current ripple, the analysis can be readily extended to either discontinuous or <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>modulations,</b> both carrier-based and space vector PWM. A similar approach can be usefully applied to any phase number. The analytical developments for all different sub-cases are verified by numerical simulations...|$|R
30|$|To {{overcome}} the drawbacks of the MMC, {{a new type}} of VSC called a hybrid multilevel converter has been proposed in recent years [14, 15]. The hybrid multilevel converter combines features and advantages of the aforementioned two groups of VSCs and employs IGBTs and SMs in series. The alternate arm converter (AAC) proposed in [14] and the hybrid cascaded multilevel converter (HCMC) proposed in [15] are two typical hybrid multilevel converters that can be regarded as hybrids of the TLC and MMC. By employing IGBTs in series as director switches (DSs) in place of some SMs, the AAC and HCMC employ fewer SMs, and therefore can reduce the number and cost of power electronic devices. By using FBSMs as SMs, the two converters are capable of blocking the DC fault current during a pole-to-pole DC fault [16]. Under normal conditions, the DSs in the AAC operate at the fundamental frequency (i.e., 50 / 60  Hz), thereby reducing the switching loss of the DSs. However, as analyzed in [14], the AAC needs to operate at the “sweet spot” to maintain the energy balance of stacks; thus, the modulation range is limited [17]. Compared with the AAC, the HCMC reduces the number of power electronic devices [16]. By employing a symmetrical modulation scheme [18, 19], the modulation range of the HCMC can be [0, 4 /π], which is wider than that of the AAC. However, in the symmetrical modulation scheme, the DSs in the HCMC switch at a higher frequency [18, 19]; thus, the switching loss is higher than for the AAC. In [5] and [20], <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>modulation</b> methods for the HCMC are investigated to reduce the switching frequency and thereby the switching loss of the DSs. The <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>modulation</b> schemes are suitable for the HCMC for operation with a high modulation index but cannot be applied to the HCMC when the modulation index is lower than 2 √ 3 /π [5].|$|E
40|$|Totally blind APP channel {{estimation}} {{is based}} on the A Posteriori Probability (APP) calculation algorithm. <b>Asymmetrical</b> <b>modulation</b> schemes are used in order to resolve the phase ambiguity with no need for any pilot or reference symbols. In OFDM-systems, the two-dimensional channel estimation is performed by applying a concatenation of two one-dimensional APP estimators for frequency and time direction in combination with an iterative estimation and decoding loop. Linear filters are used to predict the channel transfer function while traversing the trellis of the APP estimator. In this paper, we study the influence which the coefficients of these predictors have on the channel estimation result. We compare the performance of ideal predictors with the performance of predictors with coefficients based on optimal channel statistics and averaging. We study the behavior of the the iterative estimation and decoding loop using the Extrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) Chart and evaluate the performance of the algorithm with respect to the BER. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{was to develop a}} novel {{behavioural}} technique to disrupt parietal function in order to induce top-down cortical modulation of low-level brain structures, namely the brainstem mediated vestibulo- ocular reflex and the early visual cortex. The premise of the technique was based upon using stimuli that engaged overlapping neuronal networks. To this end, we employed a technique that involved concurrent vestibular activation and viewing of bistable perceptual visual stimuli or performing visualised spatial attention tasks. The thesis presents data that shows the ability of this technique to induce a handedness related cortical modulation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex and modulation of the early visual cortex. Subsequently we applied trans-cranial direct stimulation to directly disrupt parietal inter-hemispheric balance in order to induce an <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>modulation</b> of the VOR and propose a revised computational model for vestibular processing. The results from these experiments present the first behavioural demonstration that vestibular cortical processing is strongly lateralised to the non-dominant hemisphere. We propose that this technique developed and validated in this thesis can be used to further probe and investigate cognitive parietal function such as numerical cognition and human decision making.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a multioutput converter using an <b>asymmetrical</b> pulsewidth <b>modulation</b> half-bridge flyback topology employing a parallel-series-connected transformer. Compared to conventional multioutput topologies, the proposed converter operates using a single-output controller {{without the need}} for additional control loops and devices. In order to solve the cross-regulation problem, the output stages of the proposed converter are stacked in series. In addition, the voltage regulation of the proposed multioutput converter is improved through the analysis of its resonant characteristics under load variations and minimizing the secondary conduction loss. The proposed multioutput converter shows excellent performance in terms of its output regulation from no-load to full-load conditions and good cross regulation under high output currents. The design methodology and performance of the proposed converter have been verified through experimentation employing a 110 -W (3. 3 V/ 16 A, 5 V/ 12 A) prototype converter. close 98...|$|R
40|$|V H(+) -ATPase has an {{important}} role in a variety of key physiological processes. This enzyme is reversibly activated/partly inactivated by the addition/exhaustion of extracellular glucose. The current model of its regulation assumes the reversible disassembly/reassembly of ∼ 60 - 70 % of the V 1 and V 0 membrane complexes, which are responsible for ATP hydrolysis and H(+) conductance, respectively. The number of assembled complexes determines the pump activity because disassembled complexes are inactive. The model predicts the identical catalytic properties for the activated and semi-active enzymes molecules. To verify the model predictions we have isolated total membranes from yeast spheroplasts that were pre-incubated either with or without glucose. Nitrate treatment of membranes revealed the similar ATPase inhibition for two enzyme states, suggesting that they have identical structures that are essential for ATP hydrolysis. However, H(+) transport was inhibited more than the ATPase activities, indicating a nitrate uncoupling action, which was significantly higher for the nonactivated enzyme. This finding suggests that the structure of the non-activated enzyme, which is essential for H(+) transport, is less stable than that of the activated enzyme. Moreover, the glucose activation of the pump increases i) its coupling capacity; ii) its K(M) for ATP hydrolysis and ATP affinity for H(+) transport; iii) the Vmax for H(+) transport in comparison with the Vmax for ATP hydrolysis and iv) the immune reactivity of catalytic subunit A and regulatory subunit B by 9. 3 and 2. 4 times, respectively. The protein content of subunits A and B was not changed by extracellular glucose. We propose that instead of the dissociation/reassociation of complexes V 1 and V 0, changes in the extracellular glucose concentration cause reversible and <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>modulations</b> in the immune reactivity of subunits A and B by their putative biochemical modifications. This response asymmetrically modulates H(+) -transport and ATP hydrolysis, exhibiting distinct properties for the activated versus non-activated enzymes...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMulti-sensory visuo-vestibular {{cortical}} {{areas within}} the parietal lobe {{are important for}} spatial orientation and possibly for descending modulation of the vestibular-ocular reflex (VOR). Functional imaging and lesion studies suggest that vestibular cortical processing is localized primarily in the non-dominant parietal lobe. However, the role of inter-hemispheric parietal balance in vestibular processing is poorly understood. Therefore, we tested whether experimentally induced asymmetries in right versus left parietal excitability would modulate vestibular function. VOR function was assessed in right-handed normal subjects during caloric ear irrigation (30  °C), before and after trans-cranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) was applied bilaterally over the parietal cortex. Bilateral tDCS with the anode over {{the right and the}} cathode over the left parietal region resulted in significant <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>modulation</b> of the VOR, with highly suppressed responses during the right caloric irrigation (i. e. rightward slow phase nystagmus). In contrast, we observed no VOR modulation during either cathodal stimulation of the right parietal cortex or SHAM tDCS conditions. Application of unilateral tDCS revealed that the left cathodal stimulation was critical in inducing the observed modulation of the VOR. We show that disruption of parietal inter-hemispheric balance can induce asymmetries in vestibular function. This is the first report using neuromodulation to show right hemisphere dominance for vestibular cortical processing...|$|E
40|$|Multilevel {{converters}} {{have seen}} an increasing popularity {{in the last years}} for medium- and high-voltage applications. The most popular has been the three-level neutral clamped converter and still research is going on to improve the control of it. This master thesis was a continuation of the specialization project fall 2009. The main topics of current thesis were to further investigate the DC-bus balancing issues, compare symmetrical (one sampling per triangular wave) and asymmetrical (sampling at {{the top and bottom of}} the triangular wave) modulation, derive current equations for Space Vector and Double-Signal, improve output voltage in overmodulation and be able to DC-bus balance, and to implement the methods in the laboratory. Models of the three-level converter were made in the specialization project in both PSCAD and SIMULINK and further studies of the DC-bus balance were also made in this master thesis. None of the methods showed problems to regulate the DC-bus voltage when there was different capacitor values and unsymmetrical load. A PI controller was introduced for Space Vector but it did not show better performance than a regular P regulator. <b>Asymmetrical</b> <b>modulation</b> showed a clearly better performance than symmetrical modulation when the switching frequency was low compared to the fundamental frequency, especially for Space Vector. The 1 st harmonic line-to-line voltage was closer to the wanted value and the THDi was significantly lower. Simulations also showed that the THDi can vary significantly depending on at which angle the first sampling is done. This is most clear for asymmetrical Space Vector modulation, but also for the other cases this pattern occurs. By implementing an overmodulation algorithm the amplitude of the 1 st harmonic output voltage was closer to what was desired. Simulations showed how important it was to have three phase sampling symmetry in overmodulation. By having a wrong switching frequency the line-to-line output voltage dropped down to 2. 06 when operating in six-step, when the wanted output value should be 2. 205. Hence there is a quite large mismatch and the converter is sensitive to the switching frequency when it is operating in the higher modulation area. The balancing algorithm introduced for overmodulation is able to remove an initial offset without a notable change the 1 st harmonic output. Both Space Vector and Double-Signal were tested in the laboratory with two separated DC-sources. Asymmetrical and Symmetrical modulation were tested and so was also overmodulation. The laboratory results confirmed the simulated results, but since the switching was not synchronized in the laboratory, some errors occurred. </p...|$|E

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis aims to bridge an existing gap {{in the state of}} droplet aerobreakup knowledge associated with the fundamental flow physics that govern the experimentally observable droplet morphologies. Using direct numerical simulations of the aerobreakup of water cylinders and droplets in the flow behind shock waves in air, we investigate the behavior of the surrounding gas flow to gain insight into the droplet’s deformation and evolution in the stripping breakup regime. The compressible multicomponent Navier-Stokes equations are solved using the Multicomponent Flow Code — a high-order accurate structured finite-volume flow solver with shock- and interface-capturing. Following qualitative descriptions of the aerobreakup process, comparisons are made with available experimental data. In 2 D, accurate measurements of the cylinder’s center-of-mass acceleration across a range of incident shock Mach numbers allow characterization of the unsteady drag coefficient. Additionally, mass loss measurements from viscous simulations refute a well-known boundary layer stripping theory.
