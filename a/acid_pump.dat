50|$|Three drug {{categories}} {{have been}} used to inhibit H+/K+ ATPases. H2-receptor antagonists, like cimetidine (Tagamet), inhibit the signaling pathway that leads to activation of the ATPase. This type of inhibitor is effective in treating ulcers but does not prevent them from forming, and patients develop tolerance to them is developed after about one week, leading to a 50% reduction in effect. Proton pump inhibitors were later developed, starting with timoprazole in 1975. PPIs are acid-activated prodrugs that inhibit the hydrogen potassium ATPase by binding covalently to active pumps. Current PPIs like omeprazole have a short half-life of 90 minutes. <b>Acid</b> <b>pump</b> antagonists (APAs) or potassium-competitive acid blockers (PCABs) are a third type of inhibitor that blocks acid secretion by binding to the K+ active site. APAs provide faster inhibition than PPIs since they do not require acid activation. Revaprazan was the first APA used clinically in east Asia, and other APAs are being developed since they appear to provide better acid control in clinical trials.|$|E

40|$|The {{regulation}} of acid secretion was clarified {{by the development}} of H 2 -receptor antagonists in the 1970 s. It appears that gastrin and acetylcholine exert their effects on acid secretion mainly by stimulation of histamine release from the enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell of the fundic gastric mucosa. The isolated ECL cell of rat gastric mucosa responds to gastrin/cholecystokinin (CCK), acetylcholine, and epinephrine with histamine release and to somatostatin and R-alpha-methyl histamine by inhibition of histamine release. Histamine and acetylcholine stimulate the parietal cell by elevation of cAMP or [Ca]i by activation of H 2 or M 3 receptors, respectively. These independent pathways converge to activate the gastric <b>acid</b> <b>pump,</b> the H+,K+ ATPase. Activation {{is a function of the}} association of the ATPase with a potassium chloride transport pathway that occurs in the membrane of the secretory canaliculus of the parietal cell. Hence the secretory canaliculus is the site of acid secretion, the acid being pumped into the lumen of the canaliculus. The pump is composed of two subunits, a large catalytic and a smaller glycosylated protein. This final step of acid secretion has become the target of drugs also designed to inhibit acid secretion. The target domain of the benzimidazole class of <b>acid</b> <b>pump</b> inhibitors is the extracytoplasmic domain of the pump that is secreting acid, and the target amino acids are the cysteines present in this domain. The secondary structure of the pump can be analyzed by determining trypsin-sensitive bonds in intact, cytoplasmic-side-out vesicles of the ATPase, and it has been shown that the alpha subunit has at least eight membrane-spanning segments. Omeprazole, the first <b>acid</b> <b>pump</b> inhibitor, forms a disulfide bond with cysteines in the extracytoplasmic loop between the fifth and sixth membrane-spanning segment and to a cysteine in the extracytoplasmic loop between the seventh and eight segments, preventing phosphorylation of the pump by ATP. As a result of the effective and long-lasting inhibition of acid secretion by the <b>acid</b> <b>pump</b> inhibitor, superior clinical results have been found in all forms of acid-related disease...|$|E

Omeprazole reduces gastric acid secretion at its source – the <b>acid</b> <b>pump</b> of the parietal cell, thereby offering precise and consistent clinical effects. Omeprazole once daily has been shown to heal over 80 % of duodenal ulcers within two weeks and over 95 % within four weeks In gastric ulcer, the healing rates are up to 80 % within four weeks and 96 % within eight weeks. More patients are free from symptoms earlier on omeprazole therapy than with the H 2 receptor antagonists. Omeprazole is also effective in healing and symptom relief even where prolonged H 2 receptor antagonist therapy has been unsuccessful. Omeprnzole has been shown in clinical trials to be the first consistently effective treatment of erosive/ulcerative reflux esophagitis. Complete healing is achieved in the majority of patients and symptom relief is rapid. In clinical trials with 20 mg once daily, over 70 % of patients healed within four weeks and up to 85 % healed within eight weeks. Also. patients with erosive/ulcerative reflux esophagitis resistant to three months or more of treatment with full therapeutic doses of H 2 receptor antagonists have shown significant benefit, with healing rates of 49 % within four weeks and 73 % within eight weeks of therapy with omcprazole. The rare Zollinger-Ellison syndrome has been difficult to treat in the past due to the massive hypersecretion of gastric acid Omeprazole has proved highly effective in this syndrome, being well tolerated by patients who have received more than five years of continuous treatment with daily oral doses up to 160 mg.

Fracture conductivity {{is one of the key}} parameters that affects acid fracturing effects, but it's difficult to be predicted accurately due to the strong randomness of acid-rock reaction as well as various influence factors. Analyses of the impacts on fracture conductivity resulted from the rock embedment intensity, closure stress, acid dosage, rock-acid contact time, acid fluid loss, <b>acid</b> <b>pumping</b> rate through self-developed small-core fracture capacity test instrument.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of H 2 -receptor antagonists in the mid- 1970 s provided, {{for the first}} time, acceptable medical therapy for acid-related diseases. Their short duration of action and single receptor targeting, however, limited satisfactory treatment of patients. Today the control of gastric acid secretion can be effectively achieved by direct inhibition of the H+, K+-ATPase. Inhibition of the proton pump suppresses acid secretion independent of the route of stimulation. Two classes of drugs are able to inhibit the proton pump. First, the substituted benzimidazoles (proton pump inhibitors [PPIs]), which, due to their pKa of about 4, accumulate in the acidic secretory canaliculus of the stimulated parietal cell. Following conversion to a cationic sulfenamide, they react with cysteines on the extracytoplasmatic face of the H+, K+-ATPase subunit.

Methods: Gastric tissue was subjected to indirect double immunofluorescence staining with antiserum against the C-terminal decapeptide of the CCK 2 receptor and antibodies against 5 ' bromo- 2 -deoxyuridine, which had been injected into the rats 1 h before they were killed, the <b>acid</b> <b>pump</b> H, K-ATPase, the membrane-cytoskeletal linker ezrin, pepsin/pepsinogen or histidine decarboxylase. Results: Undifferentiated foetal gastric epithelial cells expressed CCK 2 receptors, whereas stem cells of adult gastric glands did not exhibit immunoreactivity. However, other epithelial cells in the progenitor zone of adult gastric glands did express CCK 2 receptors. Some of these cells were faintly stained for H, K-ATPase; pepsin/pepsinogen was also detected in this region. Parietal cells in the isthmus/pit region of the glands contained ezrin, and some showed weak immunoreactivity for the CCK 2 receptor.

40|$|A {{hallmark}} of all primary and metastatic tumours is their {{high rate of}} glucose uptake and glycolysis. A consequence of the glycolytic phenotype is the accumulation of metabolic acid; hence, tumour cells experience considerable intracellular acid stress. To compensate, tumour cells upregulate <b>acid</b> <b>pumps,</b> which expel the metabolic acid into the surrounding tumour environment, resulting in alkalization of intracellular pH and acidification of the tumour microenvironment. Nevertheless, we have only a limited understanding {{of the consequences of}} altered intracellular pH on cell physiology, or of the genes and pathways that respond to metabolic acid stress. We have used yeast as a genetic model for metabolic acid stress with the rationale that the metabolic changes that occur in cancer that lead to intracellular acid stress are likely fundamental. Using a quantitative systems biology approach we identified 129 genes required for optimal growth under conditions of metabolic acid stress. We identified six highly conserved protein complexes with functions related to oxidative phosphorylation (mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III and IV), mitochondrial tRNA biosynthesis [glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase complex], histone methylation (Set 1 C–COMPASS), lysosome biogenesis (AP- 3 adapter complex), and mRNA processing and P-body formation (PAN complex). We tested roles for two of these, AP- 3 adapter complex and PAN deadenylase complex, in resistance to acid stress using a myeloid leukaemia-derived human cell line that we determined to be acid stress resistant. Loss of either complex inhibited growth of Hap 1 cells at neutral pH and caused sensitivity to acid stress, indicating that AP- 3 and PAN complexes are promising new targets in the treatment of cancer. Additionally, our data suggests that tumours may be genetically sensitized to acid stress and hence susceptible to acid stress-directed therapies, as many tumours accumulate mutations in mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes required for their proliferation...|$|R

Leakage and contamination of drilling fluid is the main factor restricting reservoir stimulation effects, so the acidification will be the solution also as the first choice to enhance the gas recovery. In view of this, an acidification design was proposed to minimize the contamination skin factor to the highest degree. A model was first developed to calculate the critical pumping rate for opening natural fractures in deep beds. Then, the acidification model for the rock samples of natural fractures in the experimental scale was modified, and a model was established for predicting the effective penetration distance of acid and the fracture aperture in the conditions of wellbores. Accordingly, a skin factor calculation model for network-fracture acidification was developed. It is indicated that when the <b>acid</b> <b>pumping</b> rate is 5. 0  m 3 /min, all natural fractures around Well S 1 - 1 can be opened, regardless of their dip angles. Besides, the advantage of high-rate acid injection emerges gradually when the injected acid is more than 100  m 3. Moreover, for minimizing the skin factor, the network-fracture acidification in Well S 1 - 1 was optimized by pumping 210  m 3 acid {{at the rate of}} 4. 5  m 3 /min.

Empirical therapy, with evaluation of symptom response, is a central management strategy that can minimize overall costs. In cases of diagnostic uncertainty, a 1 – 2 -week diagnostic/therapeutic test with high dose <b>acid</b> <b>pump</b> inhibitor is an emerging attractive alternative to oesophageal pH monitoring. Choice of therapy, and its subsequent adjustment to individual patients, should be made in the light of a now well-defined hierarchy of efficacy, which is essentially the same for endoscopy-negative and oesophagitis patients. Management strategies must acknowledge that gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is a chronic disorder in the majority of oesophagitis and endoscopy-negative patients. Management steps should identify the most cost-effective long-term treatment that gives adequate relief of symptoms and so corrects any symptom-related impairment of quality of life. The strategies that are recommended are largely based on clinical trial outcomes. There is a need for formal clinical trials of management strategies as distinct from evaluations of specific therapies. J. Den...|$|E
40|$|Background: Fusaric acid (5 -butylpicolinic acid), a mycotoxin, is noxious to some microorganisms. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia {{displays}} {{an intrinsic}} resistance to fusaric acid. This study aims to elucidate the mechanism {{responsible for the}} intrinsic fusaric acid resistance in S. maltophilia. Methodology: A putative fusaric acid resistance-involved regulon fuaR-fuaABC was identified by the survey of the whole genome sequence of S. maltophilia K 279 a. The fuaABC operon was verified by reverse transcriptase-PCR. The contribution of the fuaABC operon to the antimicrobial resistance was evaluated by comparing the antimicrobials susceptibility between the wild-type strain and fuaABC knock-out mutant. The regulatory role of fuaR in {{the expression of the}} fuaABC operon was assessed by promoter transcription fusion assay. Results: The fuaABC operon was inducibly expressed by fusaric acid and the inducibility was fuaR dependent. FuaR functioned as a repressor of the fuaABC operon in absence of a fusaric acid inducer and as an activator in its presence. Overexpression of the fuaABC operon contributed to the fusaric acid resistance. Significance: A novel tripartite fusaric <b>acid</b> efflux <b>pump,</b> FuaABC, was identified in this study. Distinct from the formall...|$|R
40|$|The human cathelicidin {{antimicrobial}} peptide (CAMP) is a {{broad spectrum}} microbicidal agent and modulator of both the innate and adaptive immune system. It is induced by 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D (1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3) through activation of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and primary bile salts through activation of the xenobiotic nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR). Both receptors are expressed by enterohepatic and gastrointestinal (GI) tissues and play important roles in GI immunity and homeostasis. It has been demonstrated by us and others that plant polyphenol xanthohumol (XN) acts as an FXR ligand, but its regulation of CAMP gene expression has not been determined. We hypothesize that plant polyphenols obtained in the diet act as ligands for FXR and regulate expression of the CAMP gene in the GI tract thereby promoting gastrointestinal health through improved barrier defense against infection and inflammation. In this study, we demonstrate that XN induces BSEP (bile <b>acid</b> export <b>pump)</b> and human CAMP promoter activity via FXR. This activation appears to require some combination of the vitamin...|$|R
40|$|Microbiological {{samples were}} {{collected}} from the recycle tank of the vapor compression distillation (VCD) subsystem of the water recovery test at NASA MSFC following a 68 -day run. The recycle tank collects rejected urine brine that was pretreated with a commercially available oxidant (Oxone) and sulfuric <b>acid</b> and <b>pumps</b> {{it back to the}} processing component of the VCD. Samples collected included a water sample and two swab samples, one from the particulate filter surface and a second from material floating {{on the surface of the}} water. No bacteria were recovered from the water sample. Both swab samples contained a spore-forming bacterium, Bacillus insolitus. A filamentous fungus was isolated from the floating material. Approximately 1 month after the pretreatment chemicals were changed to sodium hypochlorite and sulfuric acid, a swab of the particulate filter was again analyzed for microbial content. One fungus was isolated, and spore-forming bacteria were observed. These results indicate the inability of these pretreatments to inhibit surface attachment. The implications of the presence of these organisms are discussed...|$|R
