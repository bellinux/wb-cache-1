5|$|The game {{belongs to}} the Chrono series and is a gaiden, or side story, to the 1995 game Chrono Trigger. It was {{released}} to complement its predecessor's plot, and later served as inspiration for Chrono Cross. It features text-based gameplay with minimal graphics and sound effects, and was scored by composer Yasunori Mitsuda. Unlike many Satellaview titles, Radical Dreamers was not designed to lock after <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>number</b> of playthroughs, so players owning an 8M Memory Pack onto which the game was downloaded can still play today.|$|E

5|$|The game {{includes}} {{a wide variety}} of weapons, including melee, projectile, and explosive weapons, as well as airstrike-based attacks. Some are based on real-life arms, such as the shotgun, bazooka, and hand grenade; others are rather fanciful and cartoonish, such as the sheep, which serves as a mobile explosive, and the skunk, which releases poisonous gas. In a normal match, all teams begin with the same weapons, based on the chosen weapon set. Some weapons may not become available until <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>number</b> of turns pass. Depending on the game options, additional weapons may randomly fall onto the terrain in airdropped and teleported crates. In addition to normal weapons, during team creation, each team chooses a special weapon which becomes available to them after <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>number</b> of turns. The special weapons are more powerful than regular weapons and often offer special abilities; super weapons will rarely fall in weapon crates. These weapons are often based on cartoonish themes, such as the French Sheep Strike, and usually devastating in power. In homage to the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail, one of the game weapons is a Holy Hand Grenade, with a sound-effect reminiscent of the Hallelujah chorus from Handel's Messiah.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{used because}} {{the rules of}} these leagues allow for only <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>numbers</b> of players on each team's roster. Designating a player as [...] "Injured/Reserve" [...] frees up a spot, {{enabling}} the team to add a new player during the injured athlete's convalescence. In the NFL, when a player {{is placed on the}} list he cannot return to play {{for the remainder of the}} regular season; the other leagues allow the player to return to play during the season.
