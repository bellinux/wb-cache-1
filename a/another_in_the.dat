5|$|A third North American genus called Stegomus {{was named}} by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1896. Marsh had a long-time rivalry with Cope {{that was made}} famous in the Bone Wars of the late 19th century, {{in which the two}} tried to out-compete one <b>another</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field and in {{scientific}} literature. Unlike Cope's aetosaurs, Stegomus was found from the eastern United States in Connecticut. Marsh also recognized Stegomus as an aetosaur rather than a phytosaur in his initial description of the genus. Like Cope, many paleontologists tended to consider aetosaur scutes to belong to phytosaurs during this time period.|$|E

5|$|Another {{issue is}} the role of {{inherited}} genetic factors in shaping attachments: for example one type of polymorphism of the gene coding for the D2 dopamine receptor has been linked to anxious attachment and <b>another</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gene for the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor with avoidant attachment. This suggests that the influence of maternal care on attachment security is not the same for all children. One theoretical basis for this is that it makes biological sense for children to vary in their susceptibility to rearing influence.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Wheldon had been working with IndyCar {{officials}} to develop the ICONIC chassis with the intention of improving safety in the sport. Planned changes to the chassis include larger cockpits for driver protection and bodywork over the rear wheels to prevent cars from launching off one <b>another</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> event of a collision, long a problem in open-wheel racing, regardless of oval or road course, but troublesome on high-speed ovals and tight street circuits with a long straight and a tight turn, similar to the style of many modern road courses.|$|E
5|$|Bears may mark {{territory}} by rubbing against {{trees and}} other objects which may serve to spread their scent. This is usually accompanied by clawing and biting the object. Bark may be spread around {{to draw attention to}} the marking post. Pandas are known to mark objects with urine and a waxy substance from their anal glands. Polar bears leave behind their scent in their tracks which allow individuals to keep track of one <b>another</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vast Arctic wilderness.|$|E

The pair notice a red comet in the sky; Bran remarks that the men claim it is an omen of victory for one side or <b>another</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> war, but Osha insists it means one thing: dragons have returned.|$|E
5|$|Bruno Bongongo {{participated in}} boxing in the men's welterweight class (69kilograms in weight and below), {{and was the}} only Central African participated in any event outside track and field that year. Born in 1985, Bongongo was 23 {{at the time he}} participated in Beijing. He had not {{previously}} participated in any Olympic games. Bongongo participated in the preliminary round of the event on 10 August, facing Cameroon's Joseph Mulema in the fifth bout. Bruno Bongongo was defeated when Mulema scored 17 punches on him, while Bongongo only scored two in return. Of those two punches, Bongongo scored one in the third round, and <b>another</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fourth. He did not advance to later rounds.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{its life}} the site {{consisted}} of a single ditch encompassing an area of about , with two gateways, one in the south-west and <b>another</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> east; two more rings of ditches were added later. The north part of the fort was occupied by four-post structures, probably granaries, which were later replaced by storage pits, and in the south part, there were roundhouses in between granaries and storage pits. When Danebury {{was built in the}} 6th century BC, it coincided with the construction of several other hillforts in the Wessex region, all of a similar size and layout.|$|E

5|$|In 1972, {{sessions}} for the album started, with recording {{taking place at}} three different studios in Kingston, Jamaica: Dynamic Sound, Harry J's and Randy's. Engineer Sylvan Morris put the songs on eight-track tape, and allocated tracks with the drum mixes on one track and piano and guitar together on <b>another.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> winter of 1972, Marley flew back to London to present the master tapes. The deal with Island led to a dispute with CBS and Sims, to whom the band were already contracted. The Island Records label won the resulting court case, and it received US$9,000 and two percent of royalties from the band's first six albums, and Sims received 5,000 and the publishing rights to the Wailers songs.|$|E
5|$|In Pseudo-Kodinos' work, the Domestic of the Schools ranks 31st in the {{imperial}} hierarchy, between the mystikos and the Grand Drungary of the Fleet. The Domestic's distinctive court dress, as reported by Pseudo-Kodinos, consisted of a gold-brocaded hat (skiadion), a plain silk kabbadion tunic and a silver staff (dikanikion) with a knob on top and <b>another</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle. For ceremonies and festivities, he bore the domed skaranikon, of lemon-yellow silk and decorated with gold wire embroidery, and with {{a portrait of the}} emperor seated on a throne in front and another with the emperor on horseback on the rear.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Bert T. Combs Mountain Parkway, Bert T. Combs Lake, an artificial lake constructed in 1963 in Clay County, is named in Combs' honor. On April 20, 2007, two life-sized statues of Combs were dedicated—one in Stanton, near the parkway that bears his name, and <b>another</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> county courthouse in Prestonsburg. Combs' widow, Sara Walter Combs, {{became the first woman}} to serve on the Kentucky Supreme Court in 1993 and currently sits on the Kentucky Court of Appeals, where she was chief judge from 2004 to 2010, also a first for a woman. Combs' daughter, Lois (Combs) Weinberg, unsuccessfully challenged incumbent Mitch McConnell for his Senate seat in 2002.|$|E

5|$|In late December 2009, WWE Divas Champion Melina tore her {{anterior}} cruciate ligament, {{and was forced}} to vacate the championship. As a result, it was announced in January 2010 that a single-elimination tournament would be held to determine a new champion. The tournament began on the January 4 episode of Raw, when Maryse advanced to the semi-finals by defeating Brie Bella. She was followed into the semi-finals by Gail Kim, Alicia Fox, and Eve, who defeated Jillian Hall, Kelly Kelly, and Katie Lea Burchill respectively. In the semi-finals, Maryse defeated Eve and Kim defeated Fox. It was then announced on the February 8 episode of Raw that Maryse and Kim would face one <b>another</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final at the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, several {{historians have}} noted that within the Gaelic-language genealogies and praise-poetry {{concerning}} the MacLeods, Leod's great-grandfather's name appears to equate to the Old Norse Ölvir, Olvér; rather than the Old Norse Óláfr. There {{are considered to be}} four significant Gaelic-language genealogies which concern Leod's ancestry. These pedigree roughly agree with one <b>another</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> three generations after Leod. The greatest similarity between these genealogies are the names of Leod's great-grandfather, variously spelt Oilmoir, Olbair Snaige, Olbuir Snaithe, and Olbair Snoice. Taking into account variances in spelling, these names are now considered to represent the literary Gaelic Olbhar, and the vernacular Gaelic Olghair; both which are in turn forms of Ölvir.|$|E
5|$|In the confusion, {{the tail}} of the Dutch line {{disintegrated}} into a chaotic melee, with eight British ships of the line fighting four Dutch and the frigate Monnikkendam. So close was the action that the British ships found themselves at risk of firing into one <b>another</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> high seas, heavy rain and poor visibility. The Dutch centre, consisting of the ships of the line Brutus, Leijden and the fifth rate razee Mars, pulled away from the engagement behind them under Rear-Admiral Johan Bloys van Treslong, coming under only distant fire from the ships of Onslow's division. Isolated, the Dutch rearguard were rapidly overwhelmed, with Jupiter, Haarlem, Alkmaar and Delft all surrendering to Onslow's attack before 13:45, while the battered Monnikkendam was seized by the frigate Beaulieu.|$|E

Liverpool won the first meeting in the 2011–12 Premier League 2–1, they won their second meeting in the 2011–12 Football League Cup 2–0, before winning the final against Cardiff City. As Liverpool and Chelsea had been due to play one <b>another</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Premier League at Anfield on 5 May 2012, {{the same day as}} the final, the FA {{announced}} that the league game would be postponed until Tuesday 8 May, meaning that the two sides would play each other twice in four days.|$|E
5|$|On top of {{the failure}} of the franchises to approve the spin-off, a series of {{lawsuits}} complicated the divestiture. Two legal challenges to the parent company were filed by investors, one in Pillsbury's home state of Minnesota and <b>another</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state where it was incorporated, Delaware, in which the legality of the stock tender plan was questioned. These three events eventually forced Pillsbury to give up its bid to fend off Grand Metropolitan and agree to be acquired in November 1988 for a sum of US$5.7 billion.|$|E
