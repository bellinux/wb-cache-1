Throughout the night, as Porthos' immune system weakens, Archer {{experiences}} Phlox's side of life in Sickbay. During the night, as he dreams of Porthos' funeral, Archer also deals with unresolved and suppressed sexual tension with T'Pol. He also relates to Phlox how he met Porthos, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the last in a litter of four male puppies, the 'Four Musketeers'. Through it all, Archer struggles to reach an emotional understanding with Phlox and T'Pol, as the two alien senior-crew members have little grasp of the human-pet relationship, and Phlox keeps offering Archer unsolicited advice about dealing with his apparent feelings for T'Pol.|$|E

First off he was tried for murdering Navarra and Navarra's companion back in 1958. The trial ended with him being acquitted due to insufficient evidence. He stood trial in late 1968 with 113 defendants relating to the Mafia War that resulted in the Ciaculli massacre. However, what became known as Trial of the 114 ended with only ten convictions.

500|$|Reviewers call Gyllenhaal's {{character}} a [...] "charming sociopath" [...] and {{his performance}} [...] "a bravura, career-changing tour-de-force". Film critic Christy Lemire called Gyllenhaal's performance [...] "supremely creepy" [...] and praised the film's themes and messages. Christopher Orr of The Atlantic compared Gyllenhaal {{to a young}} Robert De Niro and his performances in the films Taxi Driver (1976) and The King of Comedy, feeling Gyllenhaal's character harbored traits shared by De Niro's characters in the two films. Orr called Gyllenhaal [...] "tremendous" [...] in the role and stated that the actor is learning to [...] "channel an eerie, inner charisma, offering it up in glimpses and glimmers rather than all at once". He also declared the role as Gyllenhaal's [...] "best performance to date". Ben Sachs of the Chicago Reader highlighted Gilroy's direction, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> able to command an [...] "uncommon assurance" [...] from the cast and crew, despite being a first time director. Conversely, Richard Roeper felt that Gyllenhaal's performance was merely good, but {{that it did not}} enter [...] "new dramatic territory". He also found Russo's portrayal of Nina to be blatantly unethical and oblivious, and commented that she eventually becomes a caricature.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the radio}} drama, which debuted in 1937, The Shadow was an {{invisible}} avenger who had learned, while [...] "traveling through East Asia," [...] "the mysterious power to cloud men's minds, {{so they could}} not see him." [...] This feature of the character {{was born out of}} necessity: time constraints of 1930s radio made it difficult to explain to listeners where The Shadow was hiding <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> remaining concealed. Thus, the character was given the power to escape human sight. Voice effects were added to suggest The Shadow's seeming omnipresence. To explain this power, The Shadow was described as a master of hypnotism, as explicitly stated in several radio episodes.|$|E

Grohl admired Norton from his work with the Pixies <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> able to [...] "distil a coherent pop song out of all their multi-layered weirdness." [...] Norton was very demanding of the band's performance, eventually leading bassist Nate Mendel to enhance his musical formation.

[...] "The song 'Apology' for example was from the first demo sessions. We tried that song a year later completely differently ... way more up-tempo and it just didn't feel right. It didn't serve the song and what Raine was saying <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> singing dictated how we were playing.

Quite striking were his extraordinary collection of phobias and fears, along with general hypochondria." [...] In an 1880 letter to photographer Konstantin Shapiro who had recently published his gallery of Russian writers he confessed: [...] "My portrait repeats the one flaw which all of my photographic portraits have, my not knowing how to pose.
