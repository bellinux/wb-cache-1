40|$|Background:  Initial food‐allergic {{reactions}} are often poorly recognized and under‐treated. Methods:  Parents of food‐allergic children {{were invited to}} complete an online questionnaire, designed with Kids with Food Allergies Foundation, about their children’s first food‐allergic reactions resulting in urgent medical evaluation. Results:  Among 1361 reactions, 76 % (95 % CI 74 – 79 %) were highly likely to represent anaphylaxis based on NIAID/FAAN criteria. Only 34 % (95 % CI 31 – 37 %) of these were administered epinephrine. In 56 % of these, epinephrine was administered by emergency departments; 20 % by parents; 9 % by paramedics; 8 % by primary care physicians; and 6 % by urgent care centers. In 26 % of these, epinephrine was given within 15  min of the onset of symptoms; 54 % within 30  min; 82 % within 1  h; and 93 % within 2  h. Factors associated with a decreased likelihood of receiving epinephrine for anaphylaxis included age < 12  months, milk and egg triggers, and symptoms of abdominal pain and/or diarrhea. Epinephrine {{was more likely to}} be given to asthmatic children and children with peanut or tree nut ingestion prior to event. Post‐treatment, 42 % of reactions likely to represent anaphylaxis were referred to allergists, 34 % prescribed and/or given epinephrine <b>auto‐injectors,</b> 17 % trained to use epinephrine <b>auto‐injectors,</b> and 19 % given emergency action plans. Of patients treated with epinephrine, only half (47 %) were prescribed epinephrine <b>auto‐injectors.</b> Conclusions:  Only one‐third of initial food‐allergic reactions with symptoms of anaphylaxis were recognized and treated with epinephrine. Fewer than half of patients were referred to allergists. There is still a need to increase education and awareness about food‐induced anaphylaxis...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAnaphylaxis is a {{life-threatening}} condition, with at-risk individuals remaining at chronic {{high risk of}} recurrence. Anaphylaxis is frequently underrecognized and undertreated by healthcare providers. The first-line pharmacologic intervention for anaphylaxis is epinephrine, and guidelines uniformly agree that its prompt administration is vital to prevent progression, improve patient outcomes, and reduce hospitalizations and fatalities. Healthcare costs potentially associated with failure to provide epinephrine (hospitalizations and emergency department visits) generally exceed those of its provision. At-risk patients are prescribed epinephrine <b>auto-injectors</b> to facilitate timely administration {{in the event of}} an anaphylactic episode. Despite guideline recommendations that patients carry 2 <b>auto-injectors</b> at all times, a significant proportion of patients fail to do so, with cost of medicine cited as one reason for this lack of adherence. With the increase of high-deductible healthcare plans, patient adherence to recommendations may be further affected by increased cost sharing. The recognition and classification of epinephrine as a preventive medicine by both the US Preventive Services Task Force and insurers could increase patient access, improve outcomes, and save lives...|$|R
50|$|An ATNAA (Antidote Treatment Nerve agent autoinjector) is any of {{a variety}} of autoinjectors in use with the US Armed Forces. An autoinjector (or <b>auto-injector)</b> is a medical device {{designed}} to deliver a single dose of a particular (typically life-saving) drug. Most autoinjectors are spring-loaded syringes. By design, autoinjectors are easy to use and are intended for self-administration by patients. The site of injection depends on the drug loaded, but it typically is administered into the thigh or the buttocks. The injectors were initially designed to overcome the hesitation associated with self-administration of the needle-based drug delivery device. It is the newer delivery vehicle to be used in lieu of the Mark I NAAK.|$|E
5000|$|The European Medicines Agency {{conducted}} {{a review of}} the safety of devices then on the market and found several factors that determine whether the devices successfully deliver drug into muscle, including [...] "needle length, the thickness of fat under the skin, the way the <b>auto-injector</b> works (e.g., if it is spring loaded or not), the angle at which the device is placed on the skin and the force used to activate the device as well as how well the user follows the instructions for injection." [...] It found that how well the user was trained was the most important factor determining successful delivery, and requested companies to develop better training materials for doctors and people to whom the devices are prescribed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{alternate}} products {{expected to}} most commonly replace the recalled Sanofi devices are the EpiPens made by Mylan in the US and by Pfizer—under license from Mylan—in Canada. Mylan already had an 85% {{market share of}} the auto-injectors in the US {{in the first half}} of 2015. Maylan is expected to benefit from the recall by its competitor Sanofi, according to a report published in the Fierce Pharma newsletter of November 2, 2015: [...] ".... it is very hard to see Auvi-Q returning to the market, as it will need to be redesigned and face uphill battle to recapture patient trust after the recall," [...] Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal wrote in a note to clients on Monday. Gal also believes that the company will eventually have 95% of the Epinephrine <b>auto-injector</b> market, according to another Fierce Pharma report on November 3, 2015.|$|E

30|$|Auto-injection devices can be {{classified}} according {{to the type of}} delivery system used (prefilled syringe-based systems vs. cartridge-based systems) (Frew, 2011). <b>Auto-injectors</b> based on prefilled syringes are designed for the single-use administration of fixed doses only. Cartridge-based systems (pen injectors) can be designed for both single-use and multiple-use administration if their reservoir can contain more than a single dose. In turn, cartridge-based systems can be divided into refillable systems and disposable systems. The present literature review is focused on disposable, syringe-based and cartridge-based auto-injection devices.|$|R

40|$|BackgroundAlthough vaccine-associated {{anaphylaxis}} is very rare, it is {{the most}} serious of adverse events. An emerging role for appropriately credentialed pharmacists in Australia is the administration of vaccines to adults. Pharmacists administering vaccinations must be adequately prepared and competent to act should anaphylaxis occur within the community pharmacy setting. AimThis paper aims to review the evidence, identifies recommendations for established vaccinators administering vaccines in the community setting and provides recommendations for the most appropriate management of anaphylaxis in the community pharmacy setting. DiscussionAvailable literature revealed that the pharmacist vaccinator should utilise a pre-vaccination checklist to screen for patients at high risk of anaphylaxis. All pharmacists administering vaccines should demonstrate assessed competency using both available brands of adrenaline <b>auto-injectors</b> and demonstrate the adrenaline ampoule/needle/syringe technique. There is a strong case for pharmacist anaphylaxis response kits to contain at minimum three in-date adult adrenaline <b>auto-injectors,</b> in addition to other components of the kit. Pharmacies providing a vaccination service must have an appropriate treatment room and display a posted, written emergency protocol. Pharmacists should be able to identify anaphylaxis and differentiate this medical emergency from other adverse events following immunisation such as vasovagal syncope. ConclusionTo ensure public health, pharmacists administering vaccines must be prepared for, able to screen for and immediately recognise and manage vaccine-associated anaphylaxis and ensure appropriate follow-up and referral...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Pediatric obesity {{threatens the}} {{efficacy}} of life-saving medications given intramuscularly to anaphylactic patients. Epinephrine <b>auto-injector</b> needle lengths are potentially too short to reach the muscle compartment in patients with elevated body habitus. The objective {{of the study was}} to determine needle length requirements for intramuscular injections in pediatric patients. Methods Ultrasound was used to measure the distance from skin to muscle compartment of the thigh in 200 pediatric patients of various weight and body mass index who presented to the Emergency Department. Results Patients with higher body mass index had an increased distance to muscle and bone. If current <b>auto-injector</b> recommendations were followed, 12 % of patients weighing less than 30 kilograms and 9 % of patients weighing more than 30 kilograms would have potentially used an <b>auto-injector</b> inadequate in needle length.

Thirty one patients with RRMS using the electronic <b>auto-injector</b> Rebismart ® for selfinjecting interferon β- 1 a subcutaneously three times weekly were included in a reallife clinical multicenter study for 24 weeks in Finland. Mean adherence reported by the device and mean self-assessment of adherence were studied. Reasons for missing injections and treatment convenience were assessed. Association between adherence and gender and age were studied. The mean adherence calculated from the device data was 93. 5 %. The mean self-assessment of adherence was 96. 6 %. The most common reason for missing an injection was forgetfulness. Adherence (measured by the device) was not changed over time. In the high adherence group there were more females and young patients (< 30 years of age). The <b>auto-injector</b> was found to substantially ease the treatment by 90 % of the patients.
