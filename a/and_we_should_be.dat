I think instead the nation should be quiet; black and white, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> in a prayerful mood, which would be {{in keeping with his}} life. We should make that kind of dedication and commitment to the goals which his life served to solving the domestic problems. That's the memorial, that's the kind of memorial we should build for him. It's just not appropriate for there to be violent retaliations, and that kind of demonstration {{in the wake of the}} murder of this pacifist and man of peace.|$|E
500|$|Descent 3 is {{the first}} project {{developed}} by Outrage Entertainment. The company was founded when Parallax Software, creators of previous Descent games, decided to split in two: Outrage Entertainment and Volition. Volition would focus on creating the combat space simulator FreeSpace games, while Outrage would continue with the Descent series. Development on Descent 3 began in November 1996 {{with a team of}} eight people. According to programmer Jason Leighton, one of the major problems during the game's development cycle was a lack of direction and control. He explained that the team had [...] "No code reviews, no art reviews, [...] no way of saying, 'This is bad <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> going in a different direction'". This [...] "anarchistic" [...] development environment worked for Descent and Descent II because they were developed by small groups that worked closely together and often in the same room. However, as Outrage started to grow from eight people to almost 20 {{by the end of the}} project, the developers did not introduce enough management to control the process. As Leighton recalls, [...] "we literally had to build the team and company at the same time we started production on the game".|$|E
500|$|The {{military}} {{ordered a}} flight test using liquid rather than solid fuel in early 1942. Upon the United States' {{entry into the}} Second World War in December 1941, the Group realized they could be drafted directly into military service if they failed to provide viable JATO technology for the military. Informed by their left-wing politics, aiding the war effort against Nazi Germany and the Axis powers was {{as much of a}} moral vocation to Parsons, Forman and Malina as it was a practical one. Parsons, Summerfield and the GALCIT workers focused on the task and found success with a combination of gasoline with red fuming nitric acid as its oxidizer; the latter, suggested by Parsons, was an effective substitute for liquid oxygen. The testing of this fuel resulted in another calamity, when the testing rocket motor exploded; the fire, containing iron shed fragments and shrapnel, inexplicably left the experimenters unscathed. Malina solved the problem by replacing the gasoline with aniline, resulting in a successful test launch of a JATO-equipped A-20A plane at the Muroc Auxiliary Air Field in the Mojave Desert. It provided five times more thrust [...] than GALCIT-27, and again reduced takeoff distance by 30%; Malina wrote to his parents that [...] "We now have something that really works <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> able to help give the Fascists hell!" ...|$|E

But our sin involves investing too little, not borrowing too much." [...] Young workers face high unemployment and studies have shown their income may lag throughout their careers as a result. Teacher jobs have been cut, which could {{affect the quality of}} education and competitiveness of younger Americans.|$|E
2500|$|... "On paper, {{it should}} never have happened. Hunt is Seventies man writ large <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> {{grateful}} that species is extinct.

He has no concept of innocent until proved guilty and thinks it's acceptable to turn up to a swingers' evening with a prostitute he's just busted. He's racist, disablist and homophobic, and he calls his only female detective Flash Knickers. (And he means it as a compliment.) In fact when you see Hunt's qualities spelled out like that, it looks appalling. [...] the fact remains: Gene Hunt is my guilty secret, and I know scores of other women feel the same." ...|$|E
2500|$|In The Selfish Gene, Richard Dawkins {{describes}} {{an approach to}} life-extension that involves [...] "fooling genes" [...] into thinking the body is young. Dawkins attributes inspiration for this idea to Peter Medawar. The basic idea is that our bodies are composed of genes that activate throughout our lifetimes, some when we are young and others when we are older. Presumably, these genes are activated by environmental factors, and the changes caused by these genes activating can be lethal. It is a statistical certainty that we possess more lethal genes that activate in later life than in early life. Therefore, to extend life, {{we should be able}} to prevent these genes from switching on, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> able to do so by [...] "identifying changes in the internal chemical environment of a body that take place during aging... and by simulating the superficial chemical properties of a young body".|$|E

2500|$|On 6 September 2013, an {{interview}} was published quoting Ewen confirming {{that the group}} had split. Ewen was quoted saying [...] "This is a tricky one because I don't feel comfortable lying, saying we're in the studio recording and we're going to bring music out next year, {{which seems to be}} the favoured line," [...] she said. [...] "I think it's unfair to fans <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> honest. The band being over is definitely not my choice. I kind of was unlucky in that I came in [...] {{towards the end of the}} cycle when things naturally came to the end. There was so much drama surrounding the group, I think the music just got lost. I don't like all the drama and the negativity. We kind of fizzled out about two years ago. I do think the lineup changes have obviously got to be a factor, you can't get away from it," [...] she said. [...] "I'd be lying if I didn't think the same when I was approached. I was like, 'Is this going to work? Are people going to accept it?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Machpelah Cemetery {{operator}} Jacobson said, they [...] "never {{paid the}} cemetery for any {{restoration of the}} Houdini family plot in my tenure since 1988", claiming that the money came from the cemetery's dwindling funds. The granite monuments of Houdini's sister, Gladys, and brother, Leopold were also destroyed by vandals. For many years, until recently, The Houdini grave site has been only cared for by Dorothy Dietrich and Dick Brookz of the Houdini Museum in Scranton, Pennsylvania. The Society of American Magicians, at its National Council Meeting in Boca Raton, Florida, in 2013, under the prompting of The Houdini Museum's Dorothy Dietrich and Dick Brookz, voted to assume the financial responsibilities for the care and maintenance of the Houdini Gravesite. In MUM Magazine, the Society's official magazine, President Dal Sanders announced [...] "Harry Houdini is an icon as revered as Elvis Presley or Marilyn Monroe. He {{is not only a}} magical icon; his gravesite bears the seal of The Society of American Magicians. That seal is our brand <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> proud to protect it. This gravesite is clearly our responsibility and I'm proud to report that the National Council unanimously voted to maintain Houdini's final resting place." ...|$|E
2500|$|Few {{critics of}} Beves of Hampton have shared Eugen Kölbing's opinion that, [...] "The strain {{in which this}} work is written, is serious, even severe". More {{recently}} Derek Pearsall {{was one of those}} who took the diametrically opposite view: [...] "Beves of Hamtoun makes every possible concession to popular taste. The story is a heady brew of outrageous incident... the whole fantastic pot-pourri is carried off with irresistible panache and a marked sense of the comic. It is vivid, gross and ridiculous by turns, but never dull." [...] Again, it has been said that [...] "Bevis of Hampton is not a remarkable example of medieval romance. It is made up of stock motifs and episodes... the articulation of the episodes is loose and inexpert. What gives the romance its chief distinction is its exuberance, its racy, buoyant style, and the spirit of broad humor in which it is written." [...] Dieter Mehl called it [...] "extremely lively and entertaining, though on the whole rather artless". [...] In other words, the poem is often treated as an example of what G. K. Chesterton and George Orwell called the [...] "good bad book", having the characteristics that make for readability and popular success rather than high literary quality. W. R. J. Barron was not enthusiastic about works of this kind: [...] "The English versions of Bevis and Guy are competent but somewhat vulgarized, given to the reduplication of striking effects, paying lip-service to the heroes' values while almost wholly preoccupied by their adventures". Other critics have found themselves enjoying Beves almost in spite of themselves. George Kane wrote that it [...] "has a better effect than its component material would seem to warrant, for this almost formless story, with its miracles and marvels, ranting Saracens and dragons, is told without any polish or skill in a style generously padded and tagged, with little sense of poetic or narrative art, and still the romance is more than merely readable. As with Horn and Havelok we tolerate its artistic crudity for the sake of the company of the hero and heroine, Beues and Iosiane, who reflect the warm humanity of the imagination that created them." [...] The romance's most recent editors considered that [...] "If the values of the hero are not particularly deep, they are nonetheless heartfelt, and expressed with admirable verve. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> reluctant to underestimate the value of a good adventure story or the difficulty of producing one. Its energy and its variety, perhaps more than anything, are what enable modern readers to understand its earlier popularity and also to respond to it in the present." ...|$|E
