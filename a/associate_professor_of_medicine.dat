500|$|In 1930, Warren {{became an}} <b>Associate</b> <b>Professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Medicine.</b> That year he {{published}} [...] "A Roentgenologic Study of the Breast". X-ray imaging {{of the breast}} had first been investigated by Albert Salomon at the University of Berlin in 1913. He produced images of over 3,000 mastectomy specimens, and observed different forms and stages of cancer. He was even able to detect an undiagnosed cancer in a breast that had been removed because of a large cyst. However, Salomon apparently did not appreciate the life saving potential of his observations. Warren used radiology to track changes in breast tissue {{as a result of}} pregnancy and mastitis. He developed a stereoscopic technique, using patients rather than specimens and adapting general purpose X-ray equipment to his needs. His method involved having the patient lie on her side with one arm raised while being X-rayed. In 119 women who subsequently underwent surgery, he correctly found breast cancer in 54 out of 58 cases. This represented a leap forward, as it made diagnosis of breast cancer possible without surgery. It also sparked intense interest in the technique around the world. Today mammography saves thousands of lives.|$|E

[...] "They haven't been as physically active as you would want [...] to be, so they have undoubtedly experienced some muscle loss", she said. [...] "Probably after that extended period of time, in both a confined space and in relative darkness, they've also probably experienced some bone loss." ...|$|E
