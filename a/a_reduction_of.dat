40|$|RFID is a {{well-established}} and well used technology for item tracking and anti-theft protection. Further on-going development goals include <b>a</b> size <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> the transponders. On UHF frequency the transponder antenna is typically the largest element. Thus, <b>a</b> size <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> the transponder {{can be achieved}} by <b>a</b> size <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> the antenna. There are a lot of well-established techniques for achieving this. However, an external antenna remains typically the largest part of a transponder. <b>A</b> further size <b>reduction</b> can done by using an on-chip antenna. This will also lead to <b>a</b> strong <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> the production costs since, besides the chip production, no further steps are necessary. Another way {{to reduce the size of}} a transponder is to increase its working frequency. Due to the inverse antenna size and frequency relationship, an increased frequency allows <b>a</b> size <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> the antenna at the same proportion. We have used this principle to design an RFID transponder at 24 GHz using an on-chip antenna. The transponder has a size of 2. 5 mm x 1. 5 mm and is using the standard EPC G 2 protocol for communication...|$|R

5|$|Andronicus' {{rule was}} marked by {{incompetence}} and short-sighted decisions {{that in the long}} run would damage the Byzantine Empire beyond repair.

To popularize his rule he repudiated the union of the Orthodox and Catholic Churches decreed by the Second Council of Lyon in 1274, thereby further increasing hostilities between the Latins and the Byzantines.|$|E

40|$|The {{foundation}} STUNS {{is investigating}} a possible move of the Origo office with tenants {{to a new}} office space. The Origo office today has a low utilization rate which makes it interesting to investigate the possibility of having an office space based on the ratio of occupancy. The {{purpose of this study}} is to calculate a ratio of occupancy with the corresponding risk of overcrowding and estimate the energy reduction. When adapting the new office space to the optimal ratio of occupancy, three office design proposals will be created. With the chosen optimal ratio of occupancy at 68 percent, the risk of overcrowding spanned between 0. 3 to 0. 6 percent. All proposals based on the optimal ratio of occupancy lead to electricity and cost reductions. An open office design leads to <b>an</b> electricity <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> 686 kWh and <b>a</b> cost <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> 168 kSEK per month. An activity based workplace leads to <b>an</b> electricity <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> 540 kWh and <b>a</b> cost <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> 132 kSEK per month. An individual office design leads to <b>an</b> electricity <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> 452 kWh and <b>a</b> cost <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> 111 kSEK per month. A sensitivity analysis is made by altering input parameters. The analyzed parameters are the unique attending employees, the transition probabilities and the choice of risk of overcrowding. For optimal utilization an open office space is the best alternative because it requires least square meters based on the same ratio of occupancy and workspaces. But when considering more aspects about work habits, employees’ opinions and behaviour the optimal office design may need a different structure...|$|R
5|$|Another {{criticism}} is that outcomes {{are presented in}} terms of relative risk reduction to exaggerate the apparent benefits of the treatment. For example, he writes, if four people out of 1,000 will {{have a heart attack}} within the year, but on statins only two will, that is a 50 percent reduction if expressed as relative risk reduction. But if expressed as absolute risk reduction, it is <b>a</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> just 0.2 percent.|$|E

5|$|Selenium is {{used with}} bismuth in brasses to replace more toxic lead.

5|$|The UK {{government}} {{has set a}} target to generate 10% of the UK's electricity from renewable energy sources by 2010. The Energy White Paper (2003) sets out the Government's aspiration to double that figure to 20% by 2020.
