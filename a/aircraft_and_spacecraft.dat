25|$|Applications of {{gyroscopes}} include {{inertial navigation}} systems, {{such as in}} the Hubble telescope, or inside the steel hull of a submerged submarine. Due to their precision, gyroscopes are also used in gyrotheodolites to maintain direction in tunnel mining. Gyroscopes can be used to construct gyrocompasses, which complement or replace magnetic compasses (in ships, <b>aircraft</b> <b>and</b> <b>spacecraft,</b> vehicles in general), to assist in stability (bicycles, motorcycles, and ships) or be used as part of an inertial guidance system.|$|E
25|$|The most {{effective}} clutter reduction technique is pulse-Doppler radar. Doppler separates clutter from <b>aircraft</b> <b>and</b> <b>spacecraft</b> using a frequency spectrum, so individual signals can {{be separated from}} multiple reflectors located in the same volume using velocity differences. This requires a coherent transmitter. Another technique uses a moving target indicator that subtracts the receive signal from two successive pulses using phase to reduce signals from slow moving objects. This can be adapted for systems that lack a coherent transmitter, such as time-domain pulse-amplitude radar.|$|E

25|$|The {{frequency}} of the electrical system varies by country and sometimes within a country; most electric power is generated at either 50 or 60hertz. Some countries have a mixture of 50Hz and 60Hz supplies, notably electricity power transmission in Japan. A low frequency eases the design of electric motors, particularly for hoisting, crushing and rolling applications, and commutator-type traction motors for applications such as railways. However, low frequency also causes noticeable flicker in arc lamps and incandescent light bulbs. The use of lower frequencies also provided the advantage of lower impedance losses, which are proportional to frequency. The original Niagara Falls generators were built to produce 25Hz power, as a compromise between low frequency for traction and heavy induction motors, while still allowing incandescent lighting to operate (although with noticeable flicker). Most of the 25Hz residential and commercial customers for Niagara Falls power were converted to 60Hz by the late 1950s, although some 25Hz industrial customers still existed as of {{the start of the}} 21st century. 16.7Hz power (formerly 16 2/3Hz) is still used in some European rail systems, such as in Austria, Germany, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. Off-shore, military, textile industry, marine, <b>aircraft,</b> <b>and</b> <b>spacecraft</b> applications sometimes use 400Hz, for benefits of reduced weight of apparatus or higher motor speeds. Computer mainframe systems were often powered by 400Hz or 415Hz for benefits of ripple reduction while using smaller internal AC to DC conversion units. In any case, the input to the M-G set is the local customary voltage and frequency, variously 200V (Japan), 208V, 240V (North America), 380V, 400V or 415V (Europe), and variously 50Hz or 60Hz.|$|E
