40|$|International audienceThe present work is {{concerned}} with the dynamic modeling as well as the design of position and <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> <b>laws</b> for a balloon-multirotor vehicle consisting of an oblate spheroid helium balloon coupled with a quadrotor airframe. A six-degrees-of-freedom nonlin-ear dynamic model is derived for the balloon-quadcopter using the Newton-Euler approach. To capture the contact flexibility between the balloon and the airframe, the center of buoyancy is supposed to oscillate with second-order dynamics with respect to the airframe. Under the assumption of timescale separation between the translational and rotational dynamics, the <b>attitude</b> and position <b>control</b> <b>laws</b> are designed separately from each other. Both the <b>attitude</b> and position <b>control</b> <b>laws</b> are proportional-derivative actions plus feedforward compensation of nonlinearities combined with control input saturation within appropriate parallelepipedal sets.

The nonminimal (four-component) quaternion form is used to attitude because it is globally nonsingular, but the minimal (three-component) quaternion form is used for attitude error because it has no nonlinear constraints to prevent the rotational error dynamics from being linearized, and {{the definition of the}} attitude error is based on quaternion algebra. This approach produces an <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> <b>law</b> that linearizes the closed-loop rotational error dynamics exactly, without any attitude singularities, even if the control errors become large...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} two <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> <b>laws</b> {{suitable for}} atmospheric flight vehicles {{with a steady}} angular momentum bias in the vehicle yaw axis. This bias {{is assumed to be}} provided by an internal flywheel, and is introduced to enhance roll and pitch stiffness. The first <b>control</b> <b>law</b> is based on Lyapunov stability theory, and stability proofs are given. The second <b>control</b> <b>law,</b> which assumes that the angular momentum bias is large, is based on a classical PID control. It is shown that the large yaw-axis bias requires that the PI feedback component on the roll and pitch angle errors be cross-fed. Both <b>control</b> <b>laws</b> are applied to a vehicle simulation in the presence of disturbances for several values of yaw-axis angular momentum bias. It is seen that both <b>control</b> <b>laws</b> provide a significant improvement in attitude performance when the bias is sufficiently large, but the nonlinear <b>control</b> <b>law</b> is also able to provide improved performance for a small value of bias. This is important because the smaller bias corresponds to a smaller requirement for mass to be dedicated to the flywheel...|$|R

The method uses the technique known as Lifting to transform the original time-varying uncertain system into linear fractional transformation (LFT) form. The stability and performance robustness of the system to structured parametric uncertainty can then be analysed non-conservatively using the structured singular value μ. The method is applied to analyse the stability robustness of an <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> <b>law</b> for a spacecraft controlled by magnetic torquer bars, whose linearised dynamics can naturally be written in linear periodically time-varying form.

40|$|Magnetic torquers are {{frequently}} adopted as primary actuators for the <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> of small satellites in low Earth orbit. Such actuators generate a magnetic dipole which, in turn, leads to control torques {{thanks to the}} interaction with the magnetic field of the Earth. The design of <b>attitude</b> <b>control</b> <b>laws</b> based on magnetic torquers is a challenging problem as the torques generated by the coils are instantaneously constrained to lie in the plane orthogonal to the local direction of the geomagnetic field vector, which varies according to the current orbital position of the spacecraft.

In this paper, the design of <b>control</b> <b>laws</b> for magnetically actuated spacecraft is considered and an approach guaranteeing robustness to parametric uncertainty and optimal performance in terms of disturbance attenuation is presented.
