5|$|Generally {{seen as a}} {{pioneering}} work of zoology, Aristotle frames his text by explaining that he is investigating the what (the existing facts <b>about</b> <b>animals)</b> prior to establishing the why (the causes of these characteristics). The book is thus an attempt to apply philosophy to {{part of the natural}} world. Throughout the work, Aristotle seeks to identify differences, both between individuals and between groups. A group is established when it is seen that all members have the same set of distinguishing features; for example, that all birds have feathers, wings, and beaks. This relationship between the birds and their features is recognized as a universal.|$|E
5|$|On 28 August 1924 Blyton married Major Hugh Alexander Pollock, DSO (1888–1971) at Bromley Register Office, without {{inviting}} her family. They married {{shortly after}} he divorced from his first wife, {{with whom he had}} two sons. Pollock was editor of the book department in the publishing firm of George Newnes, which became her regular publisher. It was he who requested that Blyton write a book <b>about</b> <b>animals,</b> The Zoo Book, which was completed in the month before they married. They initially lived in a flat in Chelsea before moving to Elfin Cottage in Beckenham in 1926, and then to Old Thatch in Bourne End (called Peterswood in her books) in 1929. Blyton's first daughter Gillian, was born on 15 July 1931, and after a miscarriage in 1934, she gave birth to a second daughter, Imogen, on 27 October 1935.|$|E
5|$|Cochrane {{establishes}} {{the book as}} a work of normative political theory asking to what extent animals {{should be included in the}} domain of justice. States can and do regulate human-animal relationships, whether the animals in question are used in agriculture, as companions, or in some other way. Cochrane's focus is not on why laws are passed or on comparing laws, but in exploring what kind of laws should be passed. As his focus is on political theory, he is less concerned with questions about individual moral obligations than he is with institutional arrangements. He notes, however, that questions <b>about</b> <b>animals</b> have been neglected in political theory. In the second chapter, Cochrane considers the history of thinking on the relationship between justice and animals. He argues that within ancient philosophy there was disagreement about the inclusion of animals within accounts of justice, in medieval Christian philosophy there was a consensus that they should be excluded, and in modern philosophy there has been a return to disagreement.|$|E

In his The Assault on Truth (1984), Masson argues that Freud may have abandoned his seduction theory because he feared that granting the truth of his female patients' claims (that they had been sexually abused) would hinder the acceptance of his psychoanalytic methods. Masson is a veganism advocate and has written about animal rights. Most of his books since 1997 are <b>about</b> <b>animals.</b>|$|E

25|$|Goodall {{had always}} been passionate <b>about</b> <b>animals</b> and Africa, which {{brought her to the}} farm of a friend in the Kenya {{highlands}} in 1957. From there, she obtained work as a secretary, and acting on her friend's advice, she telephoned Louis Leakey, the notable Kenyan archaeologist and palaeontologist, with no other thought than to make an appointment to discuss animals. Leakey, believing that the study of existing great apes could provide indications of the behaviour of early hominids, was looking for a chimpanzee researcher, though he kept the idea to himself. Instead, he proposed that Goodall work for him as a secretary. After obtaining his wife Mary Leakey's approval, Louis sent Goodall to Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania, where he laid out his plans.|$|E
25|$|Milius and Lubell {{remained}} {{members of}} the Communist Party of the United States of America until they either were forced to leave (Cecil Lubell) or left {{of their own accord}} after the Kruschov speech of 1956 (Winifred), but nonetheless they and their family were affected by the Red Scare Cold War policies. In 1956, Cecil Lubell was subpoenaed by the Internal Security Subcommittee of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee chaired by Senator James O. Eastland to testify against friend and neighbor Joseph North. Lubell did not incriminate his friend and neighbor, denying any knowledge of North and his involvement within the Communist Party. During this time, Milius began illustrating more books. She co-created, with Lubell, a series of children's books <b>about</b> <b>animals,</b> natural history, plants and ecosystems.|$|E

40|$|A {{main purpose}} of this paper is to trace the roots of modern discussions <b>about</b> <b>animal</b> ethics. First, I sort out and survey major discussions <b>about</b> modern <b>animal</b> ethics. Next, I review the discussions about moral {{considerations}} for animals in eighteenth-century England which are probably thought of as templates of modern discussions <b>about</b> <b>animal</b> ethics. Additionally, I track back discussions in the seventeenth century, as a germ of discussions in eighteenth- century England, in the area of animal experiments, such as vivisection. Lastly, I speculate why these discussions in the seventeenth century spread out explosively in the following centuries in England...|$|R
