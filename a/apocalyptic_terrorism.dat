40|$|Religious {{terrorism}} is typically characterised as acts of unrestrained, irrational and indiscriminant violence, thus offering {{few if any}} policy options for counterterrorism measures.

40|$|A Time Magazine issue {{released}} {{immediately after}} the assassination of Osama bin Laden, shows {{the figure of the}} al Qaeda leader with a red cross marked on his face. Erasure, liquidation, a figure expunged. The magazine issue strikes a note of triumphalism [...] the United States had finally gotten its man in the preferred state: dead. But this was no conventional death. Nothing regarding bin Laden&# 039;s deaths (for he has died several times) has been &# 039;conventional&# 039;. From the moment the Twin Towers were attacked on September 11, 2011 and assimilated into the symbolic language of <b>apocalyptic</b> <b>terrorism,</b> the entire &# 039;war&# 039; (itself necessarily a questionable state) became an image, be it through the terrorist response itself, or the reaction of the security state...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this policy paper is to {{highlight}} {{the role of the}} judiciary in reconciling counter-terrorism strategies with human rights standards. Indeed, judicial assent to the excesses of policy-makers risks deepening the human rights crisis caused by the fight against <b>apocalyptic</b> <b>terrorism.</b> In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks against the United States, the political climate has been dominated by security concerns. The United States has invoked its right to self-defence and declared itself to be engaged in a “war” against terrorism of global reach. The condemnation by the UN Security Council of any act of terrorism as a threat to international peace and security has contributed to the prioritization of counter-terrorism strategies worldwide. In this context, the collision of anti-terrorist measures with human rights has not received the attention it deserves. This is particularly the case with regard to the extensive financial measures imposed by the UN Security Council against persons and organisations suspected of association with terrorism...|$|E
