40|$|The role of fan-shaped volcaniclastic deltas {{included}} in the edifice structure is critical to slump formation. This process is more efficient if deltas are associated with another upper LSL, such as weak hyaloclastites or hydrothermally altered rocks. In this Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research 144 (2005) 169 – 189 case, recurrent events generating collapses with increasing width are observed. Gravitational spreading of a volcanic island occurs when it is underlain by a ductile marine substratum, or includes an intra-edifice unconstrained hyaloclastic layer, 1 / 3 as thick as {{the height of the}} subaerial edifice. Spreading is characterized by edifice stretching and subsidence and does not generate major landslides. We also show that gravitational spreading on a marine substratum tends to inhibit slide generation, especially when the thickness of the sedimentary layer is larger than 1 / 10 of the edifice total height. However, if this value is lower, spreading occurs later and slumps can develop initially. We describe natural examples of oceanic hot-spot or <b>arc</b> <b>shield</b> volcanoes affected by both spreading and landslides, such as Reunion Island, Hawaii Island, James Ross Island (Antarctica) and Martinique Island (Antilles). The main structural features on these volcanoes can be explained solely by deformation on LSLs. We therefore propose a general model for the destabilization of volcanic islands that is applicable to all shield-like edifices...|$|E

40|$|Tungsten {{inert gas}} (TIG) welding {{which uses a}} non-consumable {{tungsten}} electrode and an inert gas for <b>arc</b> <b>shielding,</b> is an extremely important arc welding process. The aims of this research project are to find optimization parameters in weld bead using TIG. Semi-automatic TIG was developed to ensure {{the success of this}} research project. Samples are produce in single bead and padding bead on top of substrate (base metal) in horizontal position. Substrate material is from Mild Steel AISI 1018 while wire filler ER 70 S- 6 has a diameter of 0. 8 mm and Tungsten electrode EWth- 2 (2 % Thorium, Red) has a diameter 2. 4 mm. Argon is used as shielding gas for this research project. Parameters such as Ampere (A), Travel Speed (mm/s) and Wire Feed Rate (mm/min) has been determined and selected as factors that can influence the weld bead result. Taguchi orthogonal array L 9 (Minitab 16) was used to determine the amount of runoff and the analysis of samples. The result for surface roughness was found to be better with an average value of Ra 2. 96 μm for single bead and Ra 3. 08 μm for padding bead when compared to the work of other researchers. Surface hardness has also shown improvement from this research project.
