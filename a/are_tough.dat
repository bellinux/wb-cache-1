25|$|Caterpillars have soft {{bodies that}} can grow rapidly between moults. Their size varies between species and instars (moults) from {{as small as}} 1mm up to 14cm. Only the head capsule is hardened. The mandibles <b>are</b> <b>tough</b> and sharp for chewing (this {{contrasts}} with most adult Lepidoptera, which have highly reduced or soft mandibles). Behind the mandibles of the caterpillar are the spinnerets, for manipulating silk. Antennae are present {{on either side of}} the labrum, but small and relatively inconspicuous.|$|E
25|$|Although {{intertidal}} ecology {{has traditionally}} focused on these negative interactions (predation and competition), there is emerging evidence that positive interactions are also important. Facilitation refers to one organism helping another without harming itself. For example, salt marsh plant species of Juncus and Iva {{are unable to}} tolerate the high soil salinities when evaporation rates are high, thus they depend on neighboring plants to shade the sediment, slow evaporation, and help maintain tolerable salinity levels. In similar examples, many intertidal organisms provide physical structures that are used as refuges by other organisms. Mussels, although they <b>are</b> <b>tough</b> competitors with certain species, are also good facilitators as mussel beds provide a three-dimensional habitat to species of snails, worms, and crustaceans.|$|E
25|$|Although rugby {{union is}} not as popular as {{football}} in Argentina, Los Pumas impressive results since the 1999 World Cup have seen the sport's popularity grow significantly.

A surprise victory over the hosts France {{in the first game}} of the 2007 World Cup took Argentina to fourth in the IRB World Rankings. The team were undefeated in their pool, and reached the semi-finals for the first time, beating Scotland 19–13 in their quarter-final. They were defeated 37–13 by eventual winners South Africa in the semi-finals, but followed this up with a second win over France to claim third place overall.|$|E

500|$|The Game Boy Color port {{received}} mixed reviews. Concluding {{that the}} port is an [...] "abridged {{edition of the}} overall game", Craig Harris of IGN criticized the version's great lack of the PC version's features (e.g. weapons) and personality and pointed out its [...] "quirky" [...] graphics. The reviewer felt that the game's front end was [...] "extremely thrown together". However, he concluded that it was still fun to play. Chris Hudak of The Electric Playground similarly criticized the lack of weapons and also criticized the great lack of sound bytes and complete lack of voices and what he perceived to be [...] "microscopic" [...] worms that <b>are</b> <b>tough</b> for the eye to see.

500|$|Due to {{both the}} film's {{explicit}} nature and award contender status, 12 Years a Slaves financial success was being watched closely. Many analysts compared the film's content to other drama films of a similar vein such as Schindler's List (1993) and The Passion of the Christ (2004), which became box office successes despite their respective subject matters. [...] "It may be a tough subject matter, but when handled well... films that <b>are</b> <b>tough</b> to sit through can still be commercially successful," [...] said Phil Contrino of Boxoffice Magazine. Despite its content, the film's critical success has assisted its domestic distribution by Fox Searchlight that began with a limited released aimed primarily towards art house and African-American patrons. The film's release was gradually widened in subsequent weeks, similarly to how the studio had successfully done in years prior with films such as Black Swan and The Descendants. International release dates for 12 Years a Slave were largely delayed to early 2014 {{in order to take}} advantage of the attention created by awards seasons.|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{said that}} despite being {{based on a}} musical theater concept [...] "that {{periodically}} makes no sense", Green Day [...] "makes the journey entertaining enough". It described some of the songs as forgettable, though, arguing the album focuses more on lyrics than music. Rolling Stone said the album could have been, and was, a mess, but that the [...] "individual tunes <b>are</b> <b>tough</b> and punchy enough {{to work on their}} own". The Guardian called American Idiot a mess—"but a vivid, splashy, even courageous mess". Slant Magazine described it as a [...] "pompous, overwrought," [...] but nonetheless [...] "glorious concept album". Uncut was more critical and wrote in a mixed review that although the album was heavily politically focused, [...] "slam-dancing is still possible". In a negative review, Robert Christgau of The Village Voice called the album a [...] "dud" [...] and asserted that Armstrong's lyrics eschew [...] "sociopolitical content" [...] for [...] "the emotional travails of two clueless punks—one passive, one aggressive, both projections of the auteur", adding that [...] "there's no economics, no race, hardly any compassion." ...|$|E

500|$|The song {{is written}} in the key of A Minor with a time {{signature}} in common time. Jackson's vocal range spans from G3 to C6. The track has a tempo of 114 beats per minute. [...] "Bad" [...] {{was viewed as a}} rived [...] "Hit the Road Jack" [...] progression. Davitt Sigerson, a writer for Rolling Stone magazine, commented on the track's lyrical content while reviewing Bad, [...] "When Jackson declares that 'the whole world has to answer right now,' he is not boasting but making a statement of fact regarding his extraordinary stardom. If anything, he is scorning the self-coronation of lesser funk royals and inviting his fickle public to spurn him if it dare." [...] Sigerson compared the track to material by James Brown, whose [...] "It's a Man's Man's Man's World" [...] is openly referenced by the four chromatic note brass introduction to the song. Lyrically, [...] "Bad" [...] pertains to proving to people that you <b>are</b> <b>tough</b> boasting, with Jackson asking [...] "who's bad?" [...] in a repeating lyric in the song's chorus.|$|E
500|$|Dave Zinkoff, {{the public}} address announcer, began announcing Chamberlain's point total after {{each of his}} baskets. With ten minutes {{to play in the}} game, Warriors forward Tom Meschery sensed the team concept {{breaking}} down. The team's offense had shifted to getting Chamberlain the ball and then stopping and watching instead of cutting and moving without the ball. Chamberlain needed 25points with eight minutes remaining to reach 100, a rate equivalent to 150points in a full game. He scored his 79th point with 7:51 left, breaking his own record and sending the crowd into a frenzy. The 4,124 spectators screamed, [...] "Give it to Wilt! Give it to Wilt!" [...] After he reached 80, the crowd yelled for 100. Chamberlain thought, [...] "Man, these people <b>are</b> <b>tough.</b> I'm tired. I've got 80 points and no one has ever scored 80." [...] The Warriors continued giving Chamberlain the ball. Warrior Al Attles later explained, [...] "We wanted that Wilt got the record, because we all liked him." [...] Attles himself led by example, passing up on an easy layup so that Chamberlain could score points 88 and 89, five minutes before the end.|$|E
500|$|The antbirds are a {{group of}} small to {{medium-sized}} passerines that {{range in size from}} the large giant antshrike, which measures 45cm (18in) and weighs 150 g (5.29 oz), to the tiny 8-cm (3in) pygmy antwren, which weighs 7 g (0.25oz). In general terms, [...] "antshrikes" [...] are relatively large-bodied birds, [...] "antvireos" [...] are medium-sized and chunky, while [...] "antwrens" [...] include most smaller species; [...] "antbird" [...] genera can vary greatly in size. Members of this family have short rounded wings that provide good manoeuvrability when flying in dense undergrowth. The legs are large and strong, particularly in species that are obligate ant-followers. These species are well adapted to gripping vertical stems and saplings, which are more common than horizontal branches in the undergrowth, and thus the ability to grip them is an advantage for birds following swarms of army ants. The claws of these antbirds are longer than those of species that do not follow ants, and the soles of some species have projections that <b>are</b> <b>tough</b> and gripping when the foot is clenched. Tarsus length in antbirds is related to foraging strategy. Longer tarsi typically occur in genera such as the Thamnophilus antshrikes that forage by perch-gleaning (sitting and leaning forward to snatch insects from the branch), whereas shorter tarsi typically occur in those that catch prey on the wing, such as the Thamnomanes antshrikes.|$|E
