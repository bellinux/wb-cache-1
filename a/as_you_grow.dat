Yet fear her, you who are Nature's darling: she may detain her treasure, but not keep it forever. Her last account, though delayed, must be paid and her discharge is to render you up.|$|E
500|$|In 1967 the BBC {{commissioned}} Britten {{to write}} an opera specially for television. Owen Wingrave was based, like The Turn of the Screw, on a ghost story by Henry James. By the 1960s Britten found composition much slower than in his prolific youth; he told the 28-year-old composer Nicholas Maw, [...] "Get as much done now as you can, because it gets much, much more difficult <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>grow</b> older." [...] He did not complete the score of the new opera until August 1970. Owen Wingrave was first broadcast in Britain in May 1971, when it was also televised in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the US and Yugoslavia.|$|E
500|$|... "A Change in Me" [...] was {{originally}} published in the key of D major, performed at a slow tempo. A [...] "belty" [...] pop ballad often performed within [...] "a plaintive register", its lead vocal spans two octaves, from A3 to F5. Like most of the musical's songs, the melody of [...] "A Change in Me" [...] is borrowed from the film's orchestral score. The New Jersey Montly summarized [...] "A Change in Me" [...] as [...] "a soaring number about how adventure comes in many forms." [...] Beginning, [...] "There's been a change in me a kind of moving on though what I used to be", the song was identified by author Thomas S. Hischak as a delicate, [...] "moving ballad". Lyrically, the song is [...] "about being at peace with oneself and how it’s expected <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>grow</b> up." [...] It has also been described as [...] "uplifting", featuring the lyrics [...] "I never thought I’d leave behind / My childhood dreams / But I don’t mind / I’m where and who I want to be". The chorus ends [...] "Now I love the world I see / No change of heart–a change in me".|$|E

[...] "This time we really mean business," [...] said Harburg. [...] "We've gotten a substantial deal and participation in money and production.

2500|$|Two Entertainment Weekly {{reviews of}} the show have been posted. Ken Tucker's review shortly after the show's debut awarded it a B+; he stated the show's writing wasn't [...] "top-notch", but [...] "Romano manages to {{communicate}} something distinctive." [...] A 1997 review by Bruce Fretts, which gave the show the same score, said that the show [...] "may now be the best sitcom on the air." [...] Common Sense Media's Betsy Wallace, who awarded the show {{four out of five}} stars, wrote: [...] "the cast is stellar and plotlines shed light on universal human insecurities, such as doubting that your spouse still finds you attractive <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>grow</b> older." [...] However, she warned that the show's [...] "intimacy issues of married couples -- including (in)frequency of sex -- often take center stage," [...] as well as the show's mild language. Plugged In said in their review, [...] "Seven years and a mantle full of Emmys later, Raymond is still smartly scripted, now with new characters added to a maturing, expanding family." [...] In 2013, Complex ranked the show as 49th of [...] "The 50 Funniest TV Comedies of All Time", with writer Matt Barone saying that [...] "You'd want to pat Ray on the shoulder and say, 'We feel for you, man,' if you weren't laughing so hard." [...] Also in 2013, TV Guide ranked it #60 on its list of the [...] "60 Best Series of All Time".|$|E
2500|$|In {{her teenage}} years, she {{was locked up}} in a Nigerian prison cell because of her femininity. Being imprisoned {{encouraged}} her to leave Nigeria, if she could not have left, the other option was to finally succeed in ending her life. She remembered her experiences in this poignant piece she wrote for Gay Star News on Transgender Day of Remembrance on 20 November 2013, which was re-published by some online news outlets:I wish I could tell the younger me who tried to commit suicide twice that life gets better and dreams do honestly come through. [...] I did not imagine life could be this amazing many years ago after being released from a horrid Nigerian prison for being different. Then all I could think was I could die in this prison and no one will know or care. [...] Being imprisoned felt justifiable, considering I was being punished for being 'gay' as they assumed due to my feminine features and mannerisms. [...] I wasn't gay, I am a woman born differently due to natural defects. What I felt did not match my outward appearance. Being assigned male at birth doesn't make me a man or a woman, nobody was born a man or a woman, you are born male or female, then you develop into your preferred gender <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>grow</b> up thus making you a man or a woman. For me that gender was female. I was born male but my brain, gestures, features and carriage functioned as that of a female. Growing up and not knowing what was happening to my body made me confused and lost. I couldn't discuss it with my family because my femininity was frowned upon due to religion and I could not talk to my friends because they would not understand what I was going through. I found solace in music and dreams. I dreamt of being free to be myself, free of insults, free of judgment and free from harassments. Her experience with the Nigerian police made her to seek [...] in London, United Kingdom.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Then {{you believe}} I care more {{for my own}} {{feelings}} than yours, Cathy?' he said. 'No, it was not because I disliked Mr. Heathcliff, but because Mr. Heathcliff dislikes me; and is a most diabolical man, delighting to wrong and ruin those he hates, if they give him the slightest opportunity. I knew {{that you could not}} keep up an acquaintance with your cousin without being brought into contact with him; and I knew he would detest you on my account; so for your own good, and nothing else, I took precautions that you should not see Linton again.

60|$|Wise {{children}} always {{choose a}} mother who was a shocking flirt in her maiden days, and so had several offers before she accepted their fortunate papa. The reason they do this is because every offer refused by their mother means another pantomime to them. You see you can't trust to your father's taking you to the pantomime, but you can trust to {{every one of the}} poor frenzied gentlemen for whom that lady has wept a delicious little tear on her lovely little cambric handkerchief. It is pretty (but dreadfully affecting) to see them on Boxing Night gathering together the babies of their old loves. Some knock at but one door and bring a hansom, but others go from street to street in private 'buses, and even wear false noses to conceal the sufferings you inflict upon them <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>grew</b> more and more like your sweet cruel mamma.|$|R

I {{have always}} loved you, Suzanne, yes, {{from the time}} when I was but a boy: we used to meet now and again, you know, when you were out riding with the Englishman who is dead"--here Suzanne's face changed, then resumed its deathlike mask--"and always I worshipped you, and always I hated the Englishman whom <b>you</b> favoured. Well, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>grew</b> older <b>you</b> began to {{understand}} and dislike me, and Kenzie began to understand and insult me, and from that seed of slight and insult grew most that is bad in me. Yes, Suzanne, you will say that I am wicked; and I am wicked. I have done things of which I should not like to tell you. I have done such things <b>as</b> <b>you</b> saw last night; I have mixed myself up with Kaffir wizardries and cruelties; I have forgotten God and taken another master, and so far from honouring my own father, why, I struck him down when he was drunk and dared me to do it, and of that blow they say he died. Well, I owed him nothing less for begetting me into such a world as this, and teaching me {{how to find the}} devil before my time.|$|R

I want to express my appreciation to Sheila for her excellent service as a member and as deputy chair of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank’s board of directors from 1999 to 2004. I am very pleased to have the chance to speak to a group of professionals dedicated to advancing the understanding of land economics. As you know, problems in real estate were central to the financial crisis and ongoing developments in this sector bear importantly on the economy’s prospects for recovery. So my comments will focus on the economic outlook and I will emphasize the role of real estate in shaping it. Throughout my remarks, I will compare the situation in {{the nation as a whole}} with that here in Phoenix. I’m always struck when I visit Phoenix by the beauty of your natural setting and the great vitality of the city that has grown in this magnificent place. Phoenix demonstrates a spirit of entrepreneurship, a sense of optimism about the future, and an eagerness to build something new. But, as the housing market collapsed and the nation fell into financial crisis and recession, your desert metropolis was set back on its heels. Just <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>grew</b> faster than the nation as a whole during the boom years in the middle of the decade, so did you fall harder whe...|$|R
