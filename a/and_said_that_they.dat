5|$|Co-writer Glen Morgan felt {{doing an}} episode on vampires was a mistake, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were also criticized for having Mulder fall for Kristen. Co-writer James Wong was also disappointed, {{saying that the}} script was {{a lot better than}} the show and that the episode was {{weakened}} when Fox censors had problems with the episode. Actor David Duchovny thought the episode had style, but suffered some lapses in logic, including the scene where Kristen shaves Mulder before the two kiss.|$|E
5|$|Corythosaurus is {{currently}} {{classified as a}} hadrosaurid, in the subfamily Lambeosaurinae. It is related to other hadrosaurs such as Hypacrosaurus, Lambeosaurus and Olorotitan, {{with the exception of}} Olorotitan they all share similar looking skulls and crests. However, research published in 2003 has suggested that even though it possesses a unique crest, Olorotitan is Corythosaurus closest known relative. Benson et al. (2012) found that Corythosaurus was closely related to Velafrons, Nipponosaurus, and Hypacrosaurus, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> formed a group of fan-crested lambeosaurines.|$|E

Situated between a steep mountain range, its wartime population of approximately 45,000–60,000 was primarily made up of ethnic Azeris and Kurds. Throughout the war, the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh had been voicing their discontent over seventy years of Azeri rule <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were defending themselves from Azerbaijan's aggression. Their capture of the towns of Khojaly and Shusha stemmed from security concerns in silencing artillery bombardments positioned in those towns. They stated that Karabakh had historically been an Armenian region and that their claims for territory did not extend beyond its boundaries.|$|E

During the 2015 GaymerX in San Jose, California, the video game was demoed. About {{three years after the}} release of the original prototype, the full game, which was developed and published by Sassybot, a three-man indie game studio in the Netherlands, {{was released on}} 3 May 2016 for Microsoft Windows and 1 June 2016 for Xbox One, with the PlayStation 4 version released 26 September 2017.

5|$|The union {{rejected}} the offer on November 9 {{and asked for}} another bargaining session. The two sides met again as the deadline passed. After two days of negotiation, the owners put forth a revised final offer <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were done bargaining. If accepted by the players, Stern hoped to start a 72-game season in mid December. On November 14, the union {{rejected the}} last offer and dissolved the union. The NBPA was converted into a trade association, enabling the players as individual employees {{to participate in a}} class action antitrust lawsuit against the league, calling the lockout an illegal group boycott. Attorney David Boies, who represented the NFL owners in their 2011 lockout, agreed to represent the players and join Keesler, who also represented the players in the NFL lockout. On November 15, one group of NBA players (including Carmelo Anthony, Chauncey Billups, Kawhi Leonard, and Leon Powe) filed an antitrust lawsuit against the NBA in a California federal court, while another (including Anthony Tolliver, Ben Gordon, Caron Butler and Derrick Williams) filed their own suit against the NBA in a Minnesota federal court. November 15 was also the day players were to receive their first paychecks if the season was played.|$|E
5|$|Wembley bosses were {{in dispute}} with {{newsreel}} companies over the broadcast {{rights for the}} 1936 final. Gaumont British Film Company initially had offered £900 to film inside the ground, but this was refused by the authorities who wanted a sum of £1,500. They later backed down <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would accept the initial offer, but the film company was now only willing to pay £500. A solution could not be reached, and the media were banned from inside of the stadium. To get around the ban {{and be able to}} report on the match, a number of autogyros were hired to fly the reporters over the stadium giving them a birds–eye view of the match, with the only filming inside Wembley conducted by the official stadium cameraman. Autogyros had been used to film the final in 1935, and also by the Metropolitan police for crowd control.|$|E

5|$|When Silva {{was arrested}} in October 2012, he confessed {{to the murder of}} Martínez Pérez. Investigators and {{authorities}} in Veracruz concluded that the journalist was killed during a robbery. But when placed before a judge, Silva retracted his confession and stated that he had been tortured, held hostage for over a week, and threatened by Veracruz authorities in order to make him confess to the assassination. Silva said that officials had threatened to kill his mother, his last remaining family member. During a press conference, the Veracruz authorities relied solely on the confession of Silva as evidence against him. None of them made references to DNA, fingerprint, or blood samples from the murder scene. Sources close to the Committee to Protect Journalists stated that the samples collected at the crime scene do not match those of any of the criminals listed on the national database. This should rule out both Silva and Domínguez (who is still at large) from the murder, because both of them have extensive criminal records. Proceso news magazine immediately took a critical stance toward the investigation <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> did not believe that the Veracruz authorities were capable of completing a clean investigation. The Committee to Protect Journalists believes that the murder case was possibly fabricated, and that Silva was likely used as a scapegoat by the authorities. Just a few items were stolen from Martínez Pérez's house while valuable goods were left behind, so they allege that theft was not the real motive behind her murder. According to Mexican law, Proceso was allowed to participate in the investigation, so they appointed a top journalist to cover every detail of it. Proceso has complained that the Veracruz authorities have lied to them regarding possible developments in the investigation.|$|E
