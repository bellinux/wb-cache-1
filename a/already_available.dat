5|$|The album {{received}} mixed reviewssome critics {{claimed it}} was fresh and a new sound, while others argued it was very similar to music <b>already</b> <b>available.</b> Desolate North has an extremely slow rhythm and has only limited vocals. The music is interspersed with various woodland sounds, such as running water and footsteps. The natural imagery used on the album is reminiscent of that used in black metal, but the music is closer to ambient.|$|E

It first flew on 23 November 1943 but the manufacturer's flight tests were not completed until June 1944.

When he was led to believe that many of his works would not be allowed for publishing, he retook possession of all the manuscripts he had sent in, including some previously unpublished writings. The volumes were <b>already</b> <b>available</b> by that time. The writer died in Cluj in 1963, and was buried in the city's Hajongard Cemetery in a grave topped by a white marble cross.|$|E
5|$|Producer Yoshinori Kitase and {{director}} Motomu Toriyama have {{explained that the}} objective in mind when designing Final Fantasy X-2 was to embrace the concept of change as the game's theme and establish a more upbeat atmosphere than its predecessor. The reuse of the engine and locations from the original game meant that the team could {{spend most of their}} time focusing on the gameplay systems and plot. To portray the drastic change in Spira, the developers excluded summons, redesigned towns, and included vehicles. The low-flying vehicles were added to allow the player quicker access and mobility to the areas that were <b>already</b> <b>available</b> in the previous title.|$|E

The class was one of several classes reserved for Crufts subscribers at the cost of a guinea per year. Because of the restriction in entry, there were years when the winner of Best Champion was defeated in other classes which were not restricted to subscribers. Crufts was not the first dog show in the UK to introduce this type of title, the first event to do so was at the Cambridge Canine Society Show in 1900.|$|E
5|$|Consisting of six chapters, Madonnaland finds Simone visiting Madonna's birthplace, Bay City, Michigan, {{where she}} spoke with the local people about the singer. The book also {{analyses}} Madonna's career and fame, with the author delving into her own music career and obscure Bay City bands. Simone had been initially commissioned to write a new biography about the singer. However, due to <b>already</b> <b>available</b> excess content on her, the author felt {{she would not be}} able to find anything new. Instead, she ended up writing Madonnaland about her own failure to create a Madonna biography, why Bay City did not have any commemoration for the singer, as well as unknown music bands, pop culture and celebrity life.|$|E

AnonSec group also claimed gaining access of a Global Hawk Drone of NASA, and released some video footage purportedly from the drone's cameras. A part of the data was released by AnonSec on Pastebin service, as an Anon Zine.

5|$|Keen {{to follow}} up his {{interest}} in aviation, Johnson started taking flying lessons at his own expense. He applied to join the Auxiliary Air Force (AAF) but encountered some of the social problems that were rife in British society at the time. Johnson strongly felt he was rejected {{on the grounds of}} his class status. Johnson's fortunes were to improve. As the chances of war increased {{in the aftermath of the}} Munich Crisis, the standards of the RAF were relaxed, however, as the service expanded and brought in men from ordinary social backgrounds. Johnson re-applied to the AAF. He was informed that sufficient pilots were <b>already</b> <b>available</b> but there were some vacancies in the balloon squadrons. Johnson rejected the offer.|$|E
5|$|Sabah's public {{infrastructure}} {{are still}} lagged behind mostly {{due to its}} geographical challenges as the second largest state in Malaysia. The Sabah Ministry of Infrastructure Development (formerly known as Ministry of Communication and Works) is responsible for all public infrastructure planning and development in the state. To narrow the development gap, the federal government are working to build more infrastructures and improve the <b>already</b> <b>available</b> one. In 2013, Sabah state government allocates RM1.583billion for infrastructure and public facilities development, of which the state were allocated another RM4.07billion {{by the federal government}} in 2015 Malaysian Budget. Since the Eight Malaysia Plan (8MP) until 2014, a total of RM11.115billion has been allocated for various infrastructure projects in the state. Under the Tenth Malaysia Plan (10MP), infrastructure in the rural areas was given attention with the increase of rural water, electricity supply and road coverage.|$|E
5|$|The 8-track {{tapes of}} the three shows were {{carefully}} put in storage by Warner Bros. Japan for future use. For the album's 21st anniversary in 1993, Deep Purple author and archivist Simon Robinson decided to enquire via the band's management if the tapes could be located. He discovered the entire show had been recorded well, including all the encores. In July, Robinson and Darron Goodwin remixed the tapes at Abbey Road Studios for an expanded edition, that was then mastered by Peter Mew in September. To compromise between including {{as much of the}} shows as possible and setting a realistic price that most fans would accept, they decided to release a 3-CD box set, titled Live in Japan. This included all {{of the three}} main shows except for two tracks <b>already</b> <b>available</b> on the original album. In their place were two previously unreleased encores.|$|E

5|$|The Report was {{to serve}} two functions. First, {{it was to}} be the public and {{official}} U.S. government account of the development of the atomic bombs, outlining the development of the then-secret laboratories and production sites at Los Alamos, New Mexico, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and Hanford, Washington, and the basic physical processes responsible for the functioning of nuclear weapons, in particular nuclear fission and the nuclear chain reaction. Second, it served as a reference for other scientists as to what information was declassified—anything said in the Smyth Report could be said freely in open literature. For this reason, the Smyth Report focused heavily on information <b>already</b> <b>available</b> in declassified literature, such as much of the basic nuclear physics used in weapons, which was either already widely known in the scientific community or could have been easily deduced by a competent scientist.|$|E
5|$|The UAAI badge-engineered cars first {{introduced}} in 1989 sold in far fewer numbers than anticipated, but the Holden Commodore, Toyota Camry, and Corolla were all successful when sold under their original nameplates. The first generation Nova and the donor Corolla were produced at Holden's Dandenong, Victoria facility until 1994. UAAI was dissolved in 1996, and Holden returned to selling only GM products. The Holden Astra and Vectra, both designed by Opel in Germany, replaced the Toyota-sourced Holden Nova and Apollo. This {{came after the}} 1994 introduction of the Opel Corsa replacing the <b>already</b> <b>available</b> Suzuki Swift as the source for the Holden Barina. Sales of the full-size Holden Suburban SUV sourced from Chevrolet commenced in 1998—lasting until 2001. Also in 1998, local assembly of the Vectra began at Elizabeth, South Australia. These cars were exported to Japan and Southeast Asia with Opel badges. However, the Vectra did not achieve sufficient sales in Australia to justify local assembly, and reverted to being fully imported in 2000.|$|E
