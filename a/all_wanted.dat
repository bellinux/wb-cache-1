6000|$|What {{the world}} at large really needs, and will one day get, is not this, but due {{recognition}} of the true value of science in education. We don't <b>all</b> <b>want</b> to be made into first-class anatomists like Owen, still less into first-class practical surgeons, like Sir Henry Thompson. But what we do <b>all</b> <b>want</b> is a competent general knowledge (amongst other things) of anatomy at large, and especially of human anatomy; of physiology at large, and especially of human physiology. We don't <b>all</b> <b>want</b> to be analytical chemists: but what we do <b>all</b> <b>want</b> is to know as much about oxygen and carbon as will enable us to understand the commonest phenomena of combustion, of chemical combination, of animal or vegetable life. We don't <b>all</b> <b>want</b> to be zoologists, and botanists of the type who put their names after [...] "critical species:" [...] but what we do <b>all</b> <b>want</b> to know is as much about plants and animals as will enable us to walk through life intelligently, and to understand the meaning of the things that surround us. We want, in one word, a general acquaintance with the results rather than with the methods of science.|$|R

25|$|Initially, no studio would {{finance the}} film {{because of its}} {{potentially}} controversial and off-beat subject matter. After Drugstore Cowboy received favorable critical raves and awards, studios started to show some interest. However, they <b>all</b> <b>wanted</b> their own versions made and not Van Sant's. This frustration prompted the filmmaker to attempt the feature on a shoestring budget with a cast of actual street kids filling out the roles including Michael Parker and actor Rodney Harvey, {{who was going to}} play Scott.|$|E

Thomas said that he had [...] "never had a more cut and dry audition" [...] than he did with Seyfried. He said that she was [...] "about 100 times better than anyone else that we saw, she was just spectacular". He continued by saying that she ended up being so good in the series that he used her three or four more times than he initially planned.|$|E

[...] The rest of the committee <b>all</b> <b>wanted</b> the prize to go to U Thant, for his work in defusing the Cuban Missile Crisis, ending the war in the Congo, and his ongoing work to mediate an end to the Vietnam War. [...] The disagreement lasted three years and in 1966 and 1967 no prize was given, with Gunnar Jahn effectively vetoing an award to U Thant.|$|E

[...] Kreisberg explained that since they are all comic book fans themselves, they have all debated the age-old question of which superhero would win in a fight; [...] "So, the idea that [...] would fight each other in one of these episodes was one of our earliest ideas, and that the cast members would have that Comic-Con argument on camera was one of our earliest ideas."

500|$|Vice President Henry Wallace {{was popular}} among Democratic voters, {{but he was}} viewed as {{too far to the}} left and too {{friendly}} to labor for some of Roosevelt's advisers.

Outgoing Democratic National Committee chairman Frank C. Walker, incoming chairman Hannegan, party treasurer Edwin W.

Roosevelt told party leaders that he would accept either Truman or Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas. State and city party leaders strongly preferred Truman, and Roosevelt agreed.

500|$|Hoppus and Barker {{decided to}} {{continue}} on without DeLonge, and enlisted Alkaline Trio vocalist/guitarist Matt Skiba to [...] "fill in" [...] for three shows in March 2015. Hoppus and Skiba had been wanting to work together musically for several years, so {{he was the first}} and only person considered for the role. After legal battles with DeLonge were worked out, Skiba joined Blink-182 as an official member and began preparations for new music. The resulting album, California, was produced by John Feldmann. He was the group's first new producer since longtime collaborator Jerry Finn. California was recorded between January and March 2016. The band, as well as Feldmann, would regularly spend [...] "18 hours" [...] in the studio a day, aiming to start and complete multiple songs in that timeframe. [...] "We <b>all</b> <b>wanted</b> to write the best record that we could [...] It does feel like a new beginning. It feels like when we used to tour and sleep in the van because that's all we wanted to do is play rock music," [...] said Hoppus.|$|E

500|$|Several {{weeks before}} the gold {{certification}} of Fillmore East and their rehabilitation, the band headed to Miami's Criteria Studios with producer Tom Dowd {{to work on their}} third studio album. The band first began recording the album one month prior, when they laid down the initial tracks for [...] "Blue Sky". The band saved money on studio time by writing and debuting songs on the road. The band worked on three songs: [...] "Blue Sky", an instrumental titled [...] "The Road to Calico" [...] (which would eventually develop into [...] "Stand Back", with added vocals) and [...] "Little Martha", the only song solely credited to Duane Allman. The band laid down these three songs and went back on the road for a short run of shows, and at this point several checked into rehab. After Duane's death, the band held a meeting on their future; it was clear <b>all</b> <b>wanted</b> to continue, and after a short period, the band returned to the road. Drummer Butch Trucks later said, [...] "We all had this thing in us and Duane put it there. He was the teacher and he gave something to us—his disciples—that we had to play out".|$|E

We found strength, vitality, newness, reason, and belonging as we worked on finishing Eat a Peach," [...] said Allman. [...] "Those last three songs [...] just kinda floated right on out of us [...] The music was still good, it was still rich, and it still had that energy—it was still the Allman Brothers Band." [...] Released in February 1972, Eat a Peach was the band's second hit album, shipping gold and peaking at number four on Billboard Top 200 Pop Albums chart. [...] "We'd been through hell, but somehow we were rolling bigger than ever," [...] said Gregg Allman.|$|E
