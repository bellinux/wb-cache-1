5|$|The Seleucids {{sued for}} peace and began {{settling}} it with Scipio Asiaticus. In spring, the new consul, Gnaeus Manlius Vulso, arrived {{to take control of}} the army from Scipio Asiaticus. He was sent to conclude the treaty that Scipio was arranging. However, he was not content with the task given to him <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> plan a new war. He addressed the soldiers and congratulated them on their victory and then proposed a new war, against the Galatian Gauls of Asia Minor. The pretext he used for the invasion was that the Galatians had supplied soldiers to the Seleucid army at the Battle of Magnesia. The principal reason for the invasion was Manlius' desire to seize the wealth of the Galatians, who had become rich from plundering their neighbours, and to gain glory for himself.|$|E
25|$|Vladimir Igorevich Arnold {{was born}} on 12 June 1937 in Odessa, Soviet Union. His father was Igor Vladimirovich Arnold (1900–1948), a mathematician. His mother was Nina Alexandrovna Arnold (1909–1986, née Isakovich), an art historian. When Arnold was thirteen, an uncle who was an {{engineer}} told him about calculus and {{how it could be}} used to understand some physical phenomena, this contributed to spark his interest for mathematics, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> study by himself the mathematical books his father had left to him, which included some works of Leonhard Euler and Charles Hermite.|$|E

25|$|Rorik of Dorestad {{was born}} about ca. 810–820 to Ali Anulo, 9th king of Haithabu. Frankish chroniclers mention that he {{received}} lands in Friesland from Emperor Louis I. This was not enough for him, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> plunder neighbouring lands: he took Dorestad in 850, captured Haithabu in 857, and looted Bremen in 859. The Emperor was enraged and stripped him of all his possessions in 860. After that, Rorik disappears from the Western sources for a considerable period of time, while only two years later, in 862, the Russian chronicle's Rurik arrives in the eastern Baltic, builds the fortress of Ladoga, and later moves to Novgorod.|$|E
25|$|Lionel moved onto Grace (Lynette Forday) but as 1996 ended he and Kirsty finally reconciled. However the {{relationship}} again fell apart and a reconciliation with Grace also fell through. Whilst talking {{through a divorce}} with Kirsty, the two narrowly escaped death {{in a plane crash}} and finally ended their marriage. In 1998 Lionel realized he really did love Kirsty but missed her by seconds as she left Ferndale. He was shocked to discover he had an illegitimate teenage son - Luke Billingham (Greg Freeman) <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> date Mackenzie (Ingrid Park). The two married in 1999 but shortly after the wedding, Lionel discovered evidence to suggest his wife had tried to murder Oscar (Christopher Brown) and was washed off a rock whilst trying to escape her.

25|$|In 1900, {{when he was}} 13 years old, {{his mother}} was {{approached}} {{by one of the}} owners of the Brandon Mill <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> play for the mill's baseball team. He was the youngest player on the team. He was paid $2.50 to play on Saturdays (equivalent to $ today). He was originally placed as a pitcher, but one day he accidentally broke another player's arm with a fastball. No one wanted to bat against him so the manager of the team placed him in the outfield. His hitting ability made him a celebrity around town. Around that time he was given a baseball bat which he named Black Betsy. He was compared to Champ Osteen, another player from the mills who made it to the Majors. He moved from mill team to mill team in search of better pay, playing semi-professional baseball by 1905.|$|E

25|$|Saint-Quentin-la-Poterie {{is about}} 5km north of Uzès and some 30km north of Nîmes. Joseph {{was one of}} ten {{children}} born to a family of horticulturists {{in the service of}} the duc d'Uzès. All hands being needed in the fields, Joseph was not sent to school. By the age of 17 he had proved his worth as a gardener, and the duke offered him a post at his mansion in Paris. Joseph took the opportunity to attend evening classes and learned to read and write. When friends of the duke began to ask his advice, his horizons widened <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> make the high-level contacts that were to define his later career. In 1846 he left the duke's service to take up a post at the Tuileries Gardens near the Louvre. Responsible for the orangery, he began to look for a more durable form of container for the orange trees, which were moved from the open air into the greenhouses during the winter. He began to make them of cement (mixed with sand, cinders, and/or crushed firebricks) and reinforced them with a grid of iron rods. There was a general notion at the time that thermal expansion and contraction of embedded iron would rupture the concrete. It seems that Monier spent some years experimenting with his containers in order to prove that this was not the case.|$|E
25|$|Morton {{was born}} at Mellor, Derbyshire. He made his debut for Derbyshire in May 1903 against MCC {{when he was out}} for a duck in both innings and took the only wicket in the second innings before MCC won. He played six matches in 1903 taking a total of 3 wickets with a top score of 22. However in 1904 he played 17 matches, but only took six wickets and made a top score of 56. In 1905 his bowling picked up <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> improve his run total, but it was 1907 before he managed his first 5 wicket innings. He managed another 5 wicket innings in 1908 but in 1909 took five 5-wicket innings with a best {{performance}} of 6–38. In 1910 against Hampshire he took 8 for 117 in the first innings and 2 wickets in the second to make it a 10 wicket match. In the whole season he achieved ten 5 wicket innings and three 10 wicket matches. In 1911 he managed his best bowling performance of 9 for 71 against Nottinghamshire and scored his first century against Hampshire. He took seven 5-wicket innings in 1912 with a best performance of 7 for 16 and five in 1913 with a best performance of 7 for 43. In 1913 he took three 5-wicket innings and made a top performance of 6 for 95. In 1912, 1913 and 1914 he played occasional games for MCC.|$|E

500|$|By 1935 19‑year‑old Wellington {{had become}} the team's secretary, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> exert {{influence}} over personal decisions. Wellington was a fan of George Washington University's Alphonse [...] "Tuffy" [...] Leemans, and he selected the obscure running {{back in the second}} round of the NFL's first draft in 1936. Leemans led the league in rushing with 830 yards, and posted 118 in the second hald of a come-from-behind victory against the Chicago Cardinals. Hubbard came out of retirement to help the team's line towards the end of the season, but despite his solid performance, the Giants finished 5–6–1, losing out on a chance to win the Eastern Division when they lost to eventual Division champion Boston in the final game of the season.|$|E
500|$|Vandersteen was now at {{the height}} of his {{productivity}} as a solo artist. Apart from his work for De Standaard and Het Nieuwsblad, he contributed to Ons Volk and Ons Volkske, he made a special Suske en Wiske story for het Parochieblad (a weekly Christian newspaper), <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> contribute to Kuifje journal (Tintin magazine) that published Hergé. The magazine was very popular in Wallonia, but struggled in Flanders, where The Adventures of Tintin was not yet as well known. A popular Flemish author would give the sales a boost, while it could mean the breakthrough on the French language market for Vandersteen. However, Hergé, as editor-in-chief, set a very high quality standard for his magazine, and Vandersteen had to improve and stylize his drawings, and had to remove the more Flemish, popular aspects of his comics. Vandersteen obliged, and the stories of Suske en Wiske he created for Kuifje are now considered the best of his career, with the first one, Het Spaanse Spook (The Spanish Ghost), which started on 16 September 1948, as his masterpiece. It was because of his work for Kuifje that Hergé nicknamed Vandersteen [...] "The Brueghel of the Comic Strip".|$|E
500|$|Though {{he never}} adhered to Christianity in his {{adolescent}} or adult life, Koht valued {{the faith in}} the perfectability of human beings, as prompted [...] "the greatest religions", <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> feel solidarity with the labour movement and the working classes, leading to the radicalisation of his views: from 1900 he voted for the Norwegian Labour Party, and had four years prior to that began to consider himself a socialist. While living in the United States, he developed a form of historical materialism, {{which led to a}} fusion of history scholarship and political views. He viewed the Liberal Party as an important agent in Norwegian history, since it pronounced the rights of the farmers, but he now viewed the working class as the next class {{to be included in the}} political life, and specifically through the Labor Party. In Koht's Liberal Party period, he cooperated with some of their more radical members, among them Carl Jeppesen, who later would join the Labour Party. He joined the Labour Party when he returned from the United States and moved to Bærum in 1909. He lived with his family in Stabekk, but commissioned a house in Lysaker in 1910. The house, designed by architect Arnstein Arneberg, was dubbed [...] "Karistua". The university offered him no office, so he had to conduct his research at home.|$|E

500|$|Despite their marital problems, Lloyd went on an American {{tour with}} Hurley in 1908. She {{was eager to}} equal the success of her sister Alice, who had become popular in the country a few years previously. By 1910, Marie's {{relationship}} with Hurley had ended, {{due in part to}} her endless parties and her developing friendship with the jockey Bernard Dillon, winner of the 1910 Derby. [...] Lloyd and the young sportsman began an open and passionate affair. [...] For the first time, her private life eclipsed her professional career. She was seldom mentioned in the theatrical press in 1910, and when she did perform, it was not to the best of her abilities. [...] The writer Arnold Bennett, who witnessed her on stage at the Tivoli Theatre in 1909, admitted that he [...] "couldn't see the legendary cleverness of the vulgarity of Marie Lloyd" [...] and accused her songs of being [...] "variations of the same theme of sexual naughtiness." [...] As with Courtenay years previously, the shy and retiring Dillon was finding it hard to adapt to Lloyd's elaborate and sociable lifestyle. Dillon's success on the racecourse was short lived. In 1911, he was expelled from the Jockey Club for borrowing £660 to bet on his own horses to win. Dillon's horses lost, and he ended up in debt to trainers. He became jealous of Lloyd's successful life in the spotlight. [...] Depression led to drink and obesity, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> abuse her. [...] Hurley, meanwhile, had initiated divorce proceedings, the strain of which caused him to drink heavily, which in turn finished his theatrical career. Lloyd left the marital home in Hampstead and moved to Golders Green with Dillon, a move which MacQueen-Pope describes as being [...] "the worst thing she ever did." ...|$|E
500|$|By 1935 Jack Mara had {{received}} a degree from Fordham Law School, passed the bar, and was, at age 27, the team's president. By that same year, 19‑year‑old Wellington had become the team's secretary, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> exert influence over personal decisions. Newman retired before the 1935 season rather than {{come back from a}} back injury suffered the previous year when the team refused to give him a raise. This left Strong as the team's top draw, and the Giants signed him to a contract which guaranteed him $4,000 but gave him a percentage of the draw that could make his salary reach a maximum of $6,000 depending on attendance. At midseason the team's attendance had increased by 15% from the previous year's record ticket sales. Although Strong was paid well that season, and took advantage of high ticket sales from games in which he was injured, many of the other team's players were not. [...] "I felt pretty damn good," [...] Strong later said about his salary, [...] "but guys like Hein, Morgan, and Burnett weren't making much more than a hundred dollars a game. The salaries the front office fed to the newspapers weren't exactly true. We had three All-Stars on the Giants making less money than most of the bench warmers on the Dodgers. Hein was the greatest player the Giants ever had, but he didn't start making $5,000 until after his 12th season." [...] Hein remarked that he felt he was well paid for the time however, [...] "I think at the time $150 [...] was probably the highest pay of any lineman in the league. It was pretty good money, even though it wouldn't sound that way now, but you could buy a loaf of bread for a nickel and get a full meal for thirty-five cents in the Automat back then. And you had no income tax." ...|$|E
