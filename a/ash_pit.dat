50|$|Six brick built kilns were {{identified}} {{during the course}} of the excavations. All were fragmentary and truncated by both the modern buildings and later 19th century buildings. All that survived of each was the partial remains of circular structures forming the base of the pottery-firing kiln. A number of rectangular <b>ash</b> <b>pits,</b> evenly spaced along the edges of the main kiln bases, {{were identified}} with each kiln. These contained ash and kiln furniture and were used to collect the burnt material falling from the fires above. Surrounding each of the kilns were cobbled floors, which sloped downward to the external edges of the <b>ash</b> <b>pits</b> - to allow easy emptying of the content of the <b>ash</b> <b>pits.</b>|$|R

2500|$|The PG plant {{produced}} {{millions of}} {{cubic feet of}} manufactured gas per year from coal and later, oil and natural gas. By 1878, it was consuming nearly 300,000 pounds of coal each day and had an <b>ash</b> <b>pit</b> [...] long to catch flyash and cinders. By 1905 they produced [...] of gas per day. [...] By 1911, they had a capacity of [...] per day. The first method of manufacturing gas for urban users utilized coal gasification (1870 to 1907), [...] then oil-gas generators (1888 to 1907), water-gas generators from 1904 to 1915, newer oil-gas generators from 1906 to 1924 and still newer oil-gas generators from 1915 until natural gas was discovered and imported into the Bay area in 1930 and the gas plant [...] was placed on standby. The last time it was fired up was in 1953 and the entire MGP was dismantled in the late 1950s.|$|E
2500|$|The {{location}} {{and purpose of}} several structures were determined {{through a combination of}} archaeological and historical work. [...] A map of the fort drawn by De Brahm suggested the powder magazine was located in the northwest corner of the fort, and it was in this area that excavators discovered the location of the only structure in the fort built with stone walls, consistent with the design of contemporary powder magazines. [...] Excavators uncovered what was likely an <b>ash</b> <b>pit</b> from a forge in the southeast corner of the fort, where De Brahm indicated the fort's blacksmith shop was located. A 1757 letter from Demeré indicated the fort's guardhouse had a double chimney. [...] Excavators noted the only structure in the fort with a double chimney was an elongate building adjacent to the east gate, a position consistent with guardhouse placement at the time. [...] A string of hearths in the western section of the fort indicated the location of the fort's barracks.|$|E
2500|$|Kibo is {{the largest}} cone and is more than [...] wide at the [...] "Saddle Plateau" [...] altitude. The last {{activity}} here has been dated to between 150,000 and 200,000 years ago and created the current Kibo summit crater. Kibo still has gas-emitting fumaroles in the crater. Kibo is capped by an almost symmetrical cone with escarpments rising [...] to [...] on the south side. These escarpments define a [...] caldera caused {{by the collapse of}} the summit. Within this caldera is the Inner Cone and within the crater of the Inner Cone is the Reusch Crater, which the Tanganyika government in 1954 named after Gustav Otto Richard Reusch upon his climbing the mountain for the 25th time (out of 65 attempts during his lifetime). The <b>Ash</b> <b>Pit,</b> [...] deep, lies within the Reusch Crater. About 100,000 years ago, part of Kibo's crater rim collapsed, creating the area known as the Western Breach and the Great Barranco.|$|E

50|$|Thirroul {{was one of}} {{the major}} depots that were built by the NSW Railway Department. At one time it {{employed}} about 450 men. It consisted of a roundhouse engine shed capable of accommodating eighteen engines, a 90 ft. turntable, a general office, machine shops, <b>ash</b> <b>pits</b> and an elevated coal stage where coal and water for the engines were dispensed.|$|R
50|$|On 23 May 1853 a {{contract}} for foundations was agreed with Messrs Cockburn & Son builders (for £24,000) and ground was broken some months later. It was during this time that Samuel Haughton (Professor of Geology) undertook {{an investigation into the}} suitability of the site due to its close proximity to the Old Library. He reported various layers of made ground, <b>ash</b> <b>pits</b> and calcareous drift, finally deeming the site permissible to build upon.|$|R
60|$|Now was the crisis, and all {{the little}} nerves of Denton's being seemed leaping and dancing. He had decided to show fight if any fresh indignity was offered him. He stopped his press and turned.

He walked back. He met the albino eye to eye.|$|R
50|$|The Spectrum Range {{is one of}} {{four large}} stratovolcanoes that make up the Mount Edziza {{volcanic}} complex. A predominantly lava dome overlies a basal shield volcano. The range is Pliocene in age and on its southwestern flank contains Pleistocene subglacial and subaerial cones and its northwest and southwest sides contain Holocene pyroclastic cones and lava flows. The youngest feature in the volcanic complex could be The <b>Ash</b> <b>Pit.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Its Upwell depot was [...] {{distant from}} Wisbech. The line had eleven sidings, with two {{originally}} allocated for passenger traffic. During the fruit season the sidings could hold {{more than a}} hundred vans. The depot had a cattle dock, a depot office, a passenger waiting room, and a coal merchant's office and staithes. There was also an <b>ash</b> <b>pit,</b> and an old GER tender was used for a water tower until 1953 when it was removed.|$|E
50|$|The Mess Lake Lava Field is a {{volcanic}} field {{associated with the}} Mount Edziz{{a volcanic}} complex of the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province in northwestern British Columbia, Canada. It lies northwest of the Spectrum Range on the Kitsu Plateau and consists of young basaltic lava flows and tephra. The source for the basaltic lava and tephra was three cinder cones, including Mess Lake Cone and The <b>Ash</b> <b>Pit,</b> {{which may be the}} youngest volcanic feature of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex.|$|E
5000|$|There {{have been}} undocumented {{concerns}} voiced {{as recently as}} September 2007 that the plant's <b>ash</b> disposal <b>pits</b> have been leaking boron into the water tables of the area.|$|R
50|$|Seaholm was a semi-outdoor power plant, {{with its}} boilers {{outdoors}} but its generators inside the Turbine Generator Building. It ultimately housed five Westinghouse turbine generators; {{the plant was}} originally built with two 20-megawatt generators and later expanded with two more 20-megawatt units and then one larger 40-megawatt unit. Seaholm was built with underground <b>ash</b> <b>pits</b> to accommodate coal-firing, {{but in fact the}} plant never ran on coal; the Oil Heating Building and underground fuel tanks also allowed the plant to burn crude oil, yet over its operating lifetime it was fired primarily with natural gas.|$|R
50|$|Heavy {{combustion}} products fell into basement mounted hoppers with water troughs under each furnace that engaged {{with the bottom}} furnace header casing skirt. The hoppers were emptied by a water jet/sluice arrangement into an <b>ash</b> receiving <b>pit.</b>|$|R

Here the ash is removed through a water lock.Part of the combustion air (primary combustion air) is supplied through the grate from below. This air flow also has the purpose of cooling the grate itself. Cooling is important for the mechanical strength of the grate, and many moving grates are also water-cooled internally.|$|E
50|$|Don't Be Afraid of the Dark is a 2010 dark fantasy horror film {{written by}} Matthew Robbins and Guillermo del Toro and {{directed}} by comic book artist Troy Nixey. An international co-production between the United States, Australia, and Mexico, it was filmed at the Drusilla Mansion in Mount Macedon, Victoria and Melbourne, Australia. The film stars Katie Holmes, Guy Pearce, and Bailee Madison, as a family moving into a 19th-century Rhode Island mansion, where the withdrawn daughter (Madison) begins to witness malevolent creatures that emerge from a sealed <b>ash</b> <b>pit</b> {{in the basement of}} the house. It is a remake of the 1973 ABC made-for-television horror film of the same name.|$|E
50|$|School House Lane was {{the first}} {{terminus}} of the North East railway, opened as a temporary terminus as the girders for the Goulburn River bridge had not yet arrived from England. Located at 59 miles, 20 chains (95.4 kilometres) from Spencer Street it was open for public services between April 18 to August 28, 1872, and was provided with passenger and goods platforms, an engine shed, <b>ash</b> <b>pit,</b> water supply, and a derrick crane. A station building was provided, {{as well as a}} tent with brick chimney for the station master. After the line was extended into Seymour station, School House Lane was closed.|$|E
2500|$|Discussion {{about the}} superiority of the Ripley Ville houses {{compared}} to the average working class houses of the time focused on the provision of WCs. In November 1866 Mr Gott, the corporation's chief engineer gave evidence to the Pollution of Rivers Commission. He said there were 26,000 houses in the town and 19,500 privies – of which 1,500 were WCs, 6,000 <b>ash</b> <b>pits</b> and 12,000 pail closets. [...] Half of all houses, 13,000 in total, did not have sole use of a privy and WCs were installed in 5.7% of the total housing stock. WC's were a middle class preserve and virtually unknown in working class dwellings – other than the houses being constructed in Ripley Ville.|$|R
25|$|Polo did {{not entirely}} {{understand}} what he saw, however. As explained in the Aobo Tu, workers actually sprinkled sea water on the fields which then filtered through sand or fine <b>ash</b> into <b>pits,</b> or perhaps he could have seen “earth salt” derived from soil.|$|R
40|$|Since 1984, the {{coal-fired}} {{plant at}} the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC, formerly Idaho Chemical Processing Plant) has been generating fly ash {{at a rate}} of approximately 1, 000 tons per year. This ash is hydrated and placed in an <b>ash</b> bury <b>pit</b> near the coal-fired plant. The existing <b>ash</b> bury <b>pit</b> will be full in less than 1 year at its present rate of use. A conceptual design to build a new <b>ash</b> bury <b>pit</b> was completed, and the new pit is estimated to cost $ 1. 7 million. This report evaluates ash reutilization alternatives that propose to eliminate this waste stream and save the $ 1. 7 million required to build a new pit. The alternatives include using ash for landfill day cover, concrete admixture, flowable fill, soil stabilization, waste remediation, and carbon recovery technology. Both physical and chemical testing, under the guidance of the American Society for Testing and Materials, have been performed on ash from the existing pit and from different steps within the facility`s processes. The test results have been evaluated, compared to commercial ash, and are discussed as they relate to reutilization alternatives. This study recommends that the ash be used in flowable fill concrete for Deactivation and Demolition work at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory...|$|R
