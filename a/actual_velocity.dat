We focus here on some applications of kymography in the study of one among the range of ‘nearly- 1 D’ processes – mitosis. Using this biological context, we suggest generalized procedures in kymograph assembly that allow a partial retrieval of spatial information which is typically lost or distorted in conventional kymography. These kymograph variations, namely guided-kymography and chromo-kymography, are helpful in the determination of <b>actual</b> <b>velocities</b> and discrimination of structures when using thick regions of interest (ROIs).

Now if the <b>actual</b> <b>velocities</b> of the stars, which can, of course, be measured, were smaller than the calculated velocities, we should have a proof that the actual attractions at great distances are smaller than by Newton's law.

40|$|Blood flow {{is a very}} {{important}} part of human physiology. In this paper, we present a new method for estimating and visualizing 3 D blood flow on-the-fly based on Doppler ultrasound. We add seman-tic information about the geometry of the blood vessels in order to recreate the <b>actual</b> <b>velocities</b> of the blood. Assuming a laminar flow, the flow direction is related to the general direction of the vessel. Based on the center line of the vessel, we create a vector field rep-resenting the direction of the vessel at any given point. The <b>actual</b> flow <b>velocity</b> is then estimated from the Doppler ultrasound signal by back-projecting the velocity in the measured direction, onto the vessel direction. Additionally, we estimate the flux at user-selected cross-sections of the vessel by integrating the velocities over the area of the cross-section. In order to visualize the flow and the flux, we propose a visualiza-tion design based on traced particles colored by the flux. The veloc-ities are visualized by animating particles in the flow field. Further, we propose a novel particle velocity legend as a means for the user to estimate the numerical value of the current velocity. Finally, we perform an evaluation of the technique where the accuracy of the velocity estimation is measured using a 4 D MRI dataset as a basis for the ground truth...|$|R
40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{which measures}} the lateral component of blood flow velocity {{was developed in}} our previous studies based on the increase in speckle size due to relative motion between moving scatterers and spatial rate of scanner A-line acquisition (scan velocity). In this paper, the apparent dominant angle of the speckle pattern in a straight vessel was investigated and a new method of two-dimensional blood flow velocity estimation is introduced. Different scan velocities were used for data acquisition from blood flow traveling at an angle relative to the ultrasound beam. The apparent angle of the speckle pattern changes with different scan velocities due to mis-registration between the ultrasound beam and scatterers. The apparent angle of the speckle pattern was resolved by line-to-line cross-correlation in the fast time (axial) direction on a region-of-interest (ROI) in each blood flow image and used to spatially align the ROI. The resulting lateral speckle size within the aligned ROI was calculated. The lateral component of the blood flow is shown to be closest to the scan velocity which gives the maximum speckle size and the apparent angle of speckle pattern collected by this scan velocity is the best estimate for the actual angle of blood flow. These two components produce two dimensional blood flow velocity estimations. Blood flow data were collected from a blood flow phantom with a 50 degrees beam-to-flow angle. Nine scan velocities were used to collect data for three different <b>actual</b> <b>velocities.</b> Estimation results for the 2 -D velocity magnitude (mean ± std) were 40. 2 ± 10. 1, 61. 8 ± 9. 3, and 96. 8 ± 12. 3 cm/s for <b>actual</b> <b>velocities</b> of 41, 65, and 98 cm/s respectively. Estimation results for the angle (actual 50 degrees for all tests) were 52. 7 ± 7. 8, 51. 6 ± 6. 2, and 53. 8 ± 5. 2 degrees.
