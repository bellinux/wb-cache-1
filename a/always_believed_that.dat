5|$|As Ziva and Tony {{drive home}} from the airport, she divulges the reason for her resentment of the new director: Orli Elbaz {{was the reason for}} her parents' divorce. She {{discloses}} that she had <b>always</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> it was a political strategy on Elbaz's part in attempt to advance her rank in Mossad, though she now thinks that it is possible that Elbaz had loved Eli. When she adds that she believes that she would be a different person were it not for Elbaz, Tony expresses thankfulness that things occurred the way they did.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we focus on}} dynamic games with almost perfect information, that is, at every stage some players (possibly one) make a choice simultaneously, and these choices become known to {{everyone}} before the next stage starts. We introduce the idea of common belief in future rationality, which states <b>that</b> a player <b>always</b> <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> his opponents will choose rationally {{in the present and}} in the future, <b>that</b> a player <b>always</b> <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> every opponent <b>always</b> <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> each of his opponents will choose rationally in the present and in the future, and so on. We present an easy elimination procedure, backwards dominance, that selects exactly those strategies that can rationally be chosen under common belief in future rationality. This procedure {{can be viewed as a}} combination of backwards induction and iterated strict dominance. We 8 ̆ 5 nally relate the concept to other rationality concepts in the literature. Key words and phrases: Epistemic game theory, dynamic games, belief in future ratio-nality, algorithms...|$|R

25|$|Meanwhile, Maga made Houphouët-Boigny {{recognize}} the R.D.D. as the Dahomeyan wing of his African Democratic Rally (R.D.A.). Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin had <b>always</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the U.D.D. {{was the sole}} representative of the Rally. This had helped bring a new political philosophy to the R.D.D., which had, up to this point, done little more than express regionalism without much of a platform.|$|E

I've <b>always</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> it takes 3-4 years to prove yourself as a Shield batsman, and Langer has achieved that. He is more of a grafting batsman than any of his rivals and that should definitely count in his favour, given the current state of Australian batting. He probably doesn't have as much natural ability as some others around, but he has proved that he can make best use of what he has got. He's prepared to work hard, and has tightened his game a lot since he came into first class cricket. His ability to get his head down and his tight defence will both be strong assets in England.|$|E

25|$|I've <b>always</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> {{you play}} to {{highlight}} the song, not {{to highlight the}} player. The song is all that matters. There are two ways {{you can choose to}} go. You can try to be someone like Eddie Van Halen, who is a great guitarist, a virtuoso. Yet he doesn't make good records because what he plays is totally lost {{in the context of this}} band's music. Then there are guitar players like Chet Atkins, who weren't out there trying to show themselves off as guitarists per se, but were using the guitar as a tool to make good records. I remember loving Chet's work when I was a kid, but it was only later, when I really listened to his guitar parts, that I realized how much they were a part of the song's fabric, and how much you'd be going 'Oh, that song just isn't working' if they weren't there.|$|E
25|$|Robin, however, {{sensed the}} truth and killed her before leaving for the play. Then he planted the {{evidence}} and made the three calls {{to make it appear}} that a woman had committed the crime. At this point he still had the photo, but rather than destroy it, he kept it and planted it at Mrs Summerhayes' house to incriminate her. But Poirot had gone through the drawer earlier and did not see the photo, so he knew it had been planted subsequently. Further revelations are also made. Eve Carpenter wanted to conceal her past for reasons of her own, which was why she didn't co-operate in the investigation. Poirot discovers that Dr Rendell may have killed his first wife, which led Mrs Rendell to talk about anonymous letters she'd received warning her of the fact. Poirot now suspects it was Dr Rendell, convinced that Poirot was in Broadhinny to investigate the death of his first wife, and not that of Mrs McGinty, who tried to push him under the oncoming train, not Robin. Maude Williams {{turns out to be the}} daughter of Eva Kane's lover, and has <b>always</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> her mother was murdered by Eva and that her father took the blame. She came to see Mrs Upward, who she thought was Eva Kane, intending to confront her, but found her dead and left quietly. She admits this to Poirot, who agrees to keep it a secret and wishes her good luck in her life.|$|E

He had <b>always</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> [...] "scientifiction", as he called these stories, had educational power, but he now understood that the fiction had to entertain {{as well as to}} instruct. His continued belief in the instructional value of science fiction was not in keeping with the general attitude of the public towards pulp magazines, which was that they were [...] "trash".|$|E

On December 26, 2010, Daley surpassed his father as Chicago's longest-serving mayor. Daley chaired his final city council meeting on Wednesday morning, May 11, 2011 and his term ended May 16, 2011. Daley was succeeded by Rahm Emanuel.|$|E
500|$|Environment {{plays a role}} in all of the Shannara novels: [...] "Environment is a {{character}} in my story and almost always {{plays a major role in}} affecting the story's outcome. I have <b>always</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> fantasy, in particular, because it takes place in an imaginary world with at least some imaginary characters, needs to make the reader feel at home in the setting. That means bringing the setting alive for the reader, which is what creating environment as {{a character}} is really all about." [...] However, Brooks believes that Sword was more about behavioral issues and personal sacrifice.|$|E

Although rumours of a relationship with Salman Khan first emerged in 2003, it was not until after their 2010 breakup that Kaif spoke of the affair, calling it her first serious relationship. They have remained friends, and the actress credits Khan with giving her confidence and guidance: ...|$|E

Shankly developed his skills to the point that he was unemployed for only a few months before Carlisle United signed him. He wrote that he had his football future worked out in his mind and that, even when working in the pit, he was only [...] "killing time". He <b>always</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> {{it was only a matter}} of time before he became a professional player.

[...] Barbauld was surrounded by boys as a child and adopted their high spirits. Her mother attempted to subdue these, which would have been viewed as unseemly in a woman; according to Lucy Aikin's memoir, what resulted was [...] "a double portion of bashfulness and maidenly reserve" [...] in Barbauld's character. Barbauld was never quite comfortable with her identity as a woman and <b>always</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> she {{failed to live up to}} the ideal of womanhood; much of her writing would center around issues central to women and her [...] "outsider" [...] perspective allowed her to question many of the traditional assumptions about femininity during the eighteenth century.|$|E

A bullet passed through his shoulder, severing nerves, and tearing a gash in his throat. General Micah Jenkins, who was riding with Longstreet, was also shot and died from his wounds. The momentum of the attack subsided. As he {{was taken from the}} field, Longstreet urged Lee to press the attack. Instead, Lee delayed further movement until units could be realigned, giving the Union defenders adequate time to reorganize. The subsequent attack was a failure. Alexander called the removal of Longstreet the critical juncture of the battle: [...] "I have <b>always</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that,</b> but for Longstreet's fall, the panic which was fairly underway in Hancock's [...] Corps would have been extended & have resulted in Grant's being forced to retreat back across the Rapidan." ...|$|E

500|$|Only two exemplifications of Magna Carta {{are held}} outside England, both from 1297.

This copy is now {{on display in the}} Members' Hall of Parliament House, Canberra. The second was originally held by the Brudenell family, earls of Cardigan, before they sold it in 1984 to the Perot Foundation in the United States, which in 2007 sold it to U.S. businessman David Rubenstein for US$21.3million. Rubenstein commented [...] "I have <b>always</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> this was an important document to our country, even though it wasn't drafted in our country. I think it was the basis for the Declaration of Independence and the basis for the Constitution". This exemplification is now on permanent loan to the National Archives in Washington, D.C.

500|$|The {{overall effect}} of Starr's {{drumming}} for the Beatles has received high praise from notable drummers. Starr commented: [...] "I'm no {{good on the}} technical things ... I'm your basic offbeat drummer with funny fills ... because I'm really left-handed playing a right-handed kit. I can't roll around the drums because of that." [...] Beatles producer George Martin stated: [...] "Ringo hit good and hard and used the tom-tom well, even though he couldn't do a roll to save his life", although Martin later added, [...] "He's got tremendous feel. He always helped us to hit the right tempo for a song, and gave it that support – that rock-solid back-beat – that made the recording of all the Beatles' songs that much easier." [...] Starr commented: [...] "I've <b>always</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the drummer is not there to interpret the song"; comparing his drumming to painting, he stated: [...] "I am the foundation, and then I put a bit of glow here and there ... If there's a gap, I want to {{be good enough to}} fill it." ...|$|E
500|$|When Alberta and Saskatchewan {{were made}} provinces in 1905, the federal {{government}} retained control over their lands and natural resources, which made the new provinces unique in Canada. [...] The Rutherford government acquiesced to this state of affairs; because the terms of confederation had been drawn up by the Liberal government of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, it was natural for the provincial Liberal Party to cast itself as their defender. [...] In this capacity, Rutherford pointed to the $375,000 per year that the provincial government received from {{the federal government}} as compensation. [...] In 1910, however, Liberal MLA Alwyn Bramley-Moore (who was a staunch provincial rights advocate and who many years later would be called [...] "Alberta's first separatist" [...] by the Edmonton Journal) moved a resolution calling on the Sifton government to [...] "take such steps as may be deemed necessary to acquire the control of all such natural resources as are of purely local concern". [...] Sifton responded that it was already the intention of his government to begin negotiations with the federal government to this end. [...] He asserted [...] "I have <b>always</b> <b>believed...</b> <b>that</b> we should administer our mines and timber.
