[...] Chester Bennington, the lead vocalist of the {{alternative}} rock band Linkin Park, has {{a role in the}} film playing Evan, a white power skinhead. Bennington met with an acting coach to prepare for his role. He said, [...] "It was actually a little more difficult than I expected because it took a lot for me {{to figure out how to}} portray this guy and what exactly his motives were going to be throughout. I thought maybe I was overthinking it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> with this really great acting coach who helped me walk through and make sense of the, 'Motivation' [...] ". Devon Bostick was offered to reprise his role as Brent from Saw VI, but turned it down due to scheduling conflicts.|$|E
500|$|After a [...] "fierce bidding war", on April 5, 2005, it was {{announced}} that Spears had signed a deal with UPN to air a reality television series documenting her relationship with Federline. The series, which would air in five episodes, was revealed to chronicle the relationship [...] "from the earliest stages of their courtship to their engagement and ultimately, their stroll down the aisle". In a statement about the series, Spears stated: [...] "From the day that Kevin <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>met,</b> there have been constant rumors and inaccurate speculation about our lives together. I feel that last year, the tabloids ran my life, and I am really excited about showing my fans what really happened, rather than all the stories, which have been misconstrued by journalists in the past. As I mentioned before, I am now going to be expressing my personal life through art".|$|E
500|$|Paramount's {{vice-president}} of music Joel Sill took a liking to a 28-year-old composer named James Horner, feeling that his demo tapes {{stood out from}} generic film music. Horner was introduced to Bennett, Meyer and Salin. [...] Horner said that [...] " [...] {{did not want the}} kind of score they had gotten before. They did not want a John Williams score, per se. They wanted something different, more modern." [...] When asked about how he landed the assignment, the composer replied that [...] "the producers loved my work for Wolfen, and had heard my music for several other projects, and I think, so far as I've been told, they liked my versatility very much. I wanted the assignment, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> with them, we all got along well, they were impressed with my music, and that's how it happened." [...] Horner agreed with the producers' expectations and agreed to begin work in mid-January 1982.|$|E

500|$|Most of the game's soundtrack is non-lyrical ambient music {{composed}} by Kelly Bailey and Mike Morasky, somewhat dark and mysterious {{to match the}} mood of the environments. The closing credits song, [...] "Still Alive", was written by Jonathan Coulton and sung by Ellen McLain (a classically trained operatic soprano) as the GLaDOS character. A brief instrumental version of Still Alive is played in an uptempo Latin style over radios in-game. Wolpaw notes that Coulton was invited to Valve a year before the release of Portal, though it was not yet clear where Coulton would contribute. [...] "Once Kim [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> with him, it quickly became apparent that he had the perfect sensibility to write a song for GLaDOS." [...] The use of the song over the closing credits was based on a similar concept from the game God Hand, one of Wolpaw's favorite titles. The song was released as a free downloadable song for the music video game Rock Band on April 1, 2008. The soundtrack for Portal was released as a part of The Orange Box Original Soundtrack and includes both GLaDOS's in-game rendition and Coulton's vocal mix of [...] "Still Alive".|$|E
500|$|... "In the Dark" [...] {{was written}} by Dev {{alongside}} The Cataracs, a group that consists of Niles Hollowell-Dhar and David Singer-Vine, who also produced the track. Dev described the song as [...] "very flavorful" [...] and [...] "hot". In an interview with music blog Idolator, she talked in-depth about the conception of the song, stating, [...] "The idea behind 'In The Dark' was {{for me to make}} a sexy song. I'm a grown woman now. I've been working with The Cataracs {{for the past three years}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> them when I was kind of young and from a small town. I was like, dammit, I'm gonna make a sexy song! So that's what I did." [...] She explained that she wanted the song to be [...] "tasteful, yet sexual" [...] and described it as [...] "very sexy, but very musical at the same time". She said, [...] "The songs I had before, even though they were explicit to an extent, they were just fun. It was time when we just wanted to make that sort of record, and we did. It's probably one of the sexier songs on the record, but I think it needed that!" [...] "In the Dark" [...] was recorded during a session in January 2011; it was one of the first songs to be recorded for Dev's debut album and it was eventually also recorded by Demi Lovato. It was later mixed by Manny Marroquin at Larrabee Studios in Los Angeles, California and mastered by Tom Coyne at Sterling Sound in New York City.|$|E
500|$|Linda Eastman was a music fan {{who once}} commented, [...] "all my teen years were spent with an {{ear to the}} radio." [...] At times, she played hookey to see artists such as Fabian, Bobby Darin and Chuck Berry. She became a popular {{photographer}} with several rock groups, including the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the Grateful Dead, the Doors and the Beatles, whom she first met at Shea Stadium in 1966. She commented, [...] "It was John who interested me at the start. He was my Beatle hero. But when I met him the fascination faded fast, and I found it was Paul I liked." [...] The pair first properly met in 1967 at a Georgie Fame concert at The Bag O'Nails club, during her UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London. As Paul remembers, [...] "The night Linda <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>met,</b> I spotted her across a crowded club, and although I would normally have been nervous chatting her up, I realised I had to... Pushiness worked for me that night!" [...] Linda said this about their meeting: [...] "I was quite shameless really. I was with somebody else ... and I saw Paul {{at the other side}} of the room. He looked so beautiful that I made up my mind I would have to pick him up." [...] The pair married in 1969. About their relationship, Paul said, [...] "We had a lot of fun together... just the nature of how we are, our favourite thing really is to just hang, to have fun. And Linda's very big on just following the moment." [...] He added, [...] "We were crazy. We had a big argument the night before we got married, and it was nearly called off... miraculous that we made it. But we did." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Cronauer, he and Williams were {{forbidden}} by Levinson to {{meet each other}} because the director [...] "was afraid that if Robin <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>met,</b> that Robin would somehow start to do an unconscious imitation of me, which would change his characterization."

2500|$|Hynek {{remained}} with Project Sign after it became Project Grudge (though {{he was far}} less involved in Grudge {{than he had been}} in Sign). Project Grudge was replaced with Project Blue Book in early 1952, and Hynek remained as scientific consultant. Air Force Captain Edward J. Ruppelt, Blue Book's first director, held Hynek in high regard: [...] "Dr. Hynek {{was one of the most}} impressive scientists I met while working on the UFO project, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> a good many. He didn't do two things that some of them did: give you the answer before he knew the question; or immediately begin to expound on his accomplishments in the field of science." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “I’m pretty surprised, I didn’t {{expect to}} {{actually}} podium. I thought top five {{would be a}} really good ride for me.

I just buried myself in the last 500 meters. I {{knew it was going to}} hurt, but it hurts for everyone. With 100 meters to go I wanted to quit, but I did one more click down on my gears and I just counted the pedal strokes to get me to the finish. This hurt worse than I’ve ever hurt before." [...] She also felt sorry for Evelyn Stevens who missed a place on the podium by 0.04 seconds. [...] "It's a very bittersweet feeling for me. Evelyn is a good friend, a teammate and a fellow countryman. We've spent a lot of time together this season and it's hard to have been beaten and have it be so close".|$|E

2500|$|Gibb met Scottish {{pop singer}} Lulu through Colin Petersen. Lulu recalls about Maurice, [...] "I thought Maurice was cute, so I said, 'In that case, {{tell him to}} stop talking about me and take me out', He did just that, I never {{expected}} much to come from this, but in fact our relationship grew, after a fashion. Going steady is quite {{the wrong way to}} describe what was happening between us. Going unsteady might better sum up the way we fell in and out with each other". According to Lulu, she, Maurice and Robert Stigwood watched Pink Floyd at the Saville Theatre in London. Later, after his relationship with Lulu had become public knowledge, he said: [...] "Lulu <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> on the Top of the Pops TV show three months ago, and then at the Saville Theatre in London last month". Later in 1968, Lulu was seen out on the town with Davy Jones of The Monkees, Jones was also a friend of Maurice's. As Gibb recalled, [...] "Davy Jones was a good friend of mine, I broke it off with Lulu over the phone and Davy called me up and said 'I am going to ask Lu to dinner with some friends, is that all right?' I said, 'Yes, I am not going out with her anymore, have a ball' and threw the phone down. They then took so many photos of them and made it look like a six-month romance, but she had only been out with him that one night, she did not even want to go out. She phoned me the next day and she was crying, saying she was sorry". Maurice later regretted not accepting her apology, [...] "We just grew up, that's all," [...] Maurice admitted. [...] "We were miserable apart and when we started going out again, it got so that I didn't want to be with anyone. I used to phone her up from Los Angeles about twice a day. Then she'd call me back. We used to make about 90 minute calls".|$|E
