5|$|In Russia, {{blackcurrant}} leaves may be {{used for}} flavouring tea or preserves, such as salted cucumbers, and berries for home winemaking. Sweetened vodka may also be infused with blackcurrant leaves making a deep greenish-yellow beverage with a tart flavour and <b>astringent</b> <b>taste.</b> The berries may be infused in a similar manner. In Britain, 95% of the blackcurrants grown end up in Ribena (a brand of fruit juice whose name is derived from Ribes nigrum) and similar fruit syrups and juices.|$|E

When roasted with meats or vegetables, the leaves impart a mustard-like aroma with an additional fragrance of charred wood compatible with barbecued foods.|$|E

2500|$|The alumen of {{the ancients}} then, {{was not always}} {{the same as the}} alum of the moderns. They knew how to produce alum from alunite, as this process is archaeologically attested on the island Lesbos. This site was {{abandoned}} in the 7th century but dates back at least to the 2nd century CE.

They were acquainted with a variety of substances of varying degrees of purity by the names of misy, sory, and chalcanthum. As alum and green vitriol were applied to a variety of substances in common, and as both are distinguished by a sweetish and <b>astringent</b> <b>taste,</b> writers, even after the discovery of alum, do not seem to have discriminated the two salts accurately from each other. In the writings of the alchemists we find the words misy, sory, chalcanthum applied to alum as well as to iron sulfate; and the name atramentum sutorium, which one might expect to belong exclusively to green vitriol, applied indifferently to both. Various minerals are employed in the manufacture of alum, the most important being alunite, alum schist, bauxite and cryolite.|$|E
2500|$|The {{astringency}} {{associated with}} wine is usually {{derived from a}} wine's tannins. Tannins add a gritty texture and chalky, <b>astringent</b> <b>taste.</b> It can enhance the perception of [...] "body" [...] or weight in the wine. Tannins are normally derived from the skins, seeds, and stems of the grapes themselves (leeched out during the maceration process) or from contact with oak during barrel aging. Tannins react with proteins. When paired with dishes that are high in proteins and fats (such as red meat and hard cheeses), the tannins will bind to the proteins and come across as softer. In the absence of protein from the food, such as some vegetarian dishes, the tannins will react with the proteins on the tongue and sides of the mouth—accentuating the astringency and having a drying effect on the palate. Various cooking methods, such as grilling and blackening can add a bitter [...] "char" [...] component to the dish that will allow it to play well with a tannic wine. While fish oils can make tannic wines taste metallic or off. Astringent tannic wines like Barolo and Cabernet Sauvignon can overwhelm a lot of foods but can be soften by fatty foods {{with a lot of}} proteins such as hard cheeses or meats. The dry tannins also serve as a cleansing agent on the palate by binding to the grease and oils left over in the mouth. Spicy and sweet foods can accentuate the dry, bitterness of tannins and make the wine seem to have off flavors.|$|E
60|$|Boiled {{with water}} this forms a thick glutinous mass, with a rather <b>astringent</b> <b>taste,</b> and is eaten with salt, limes, and chilies. Sago-bread {{is made in}} large quantities, by baking it into cakes in a small clay oven {{containing}} six or eight slits side by side, each about three-quarters of an inch wide, and six or eight inches square. The raw sago is broken up, dried in the sun, powdered, and finely sifted. The oven is heated over a clear fire of embers, and is lightly filled with the sago-powder. The openings are then covered with a flat piece of sago bark, and in about five minutes the cakes are turned out sufficiently baked. The hot cakes are very nice with butter, and when made {{with the addition of}} a little sugar and grated cocoa-nut are quite a delicacy. They are soft, and something like corn-flour cakes, but leave a slight characteristic flavour which is lost in the refined sago we use in this country. When not wanted for immediate use, they are dried for several days in the sun, and tied up in bundles of twenty. They will then keep for years; they are very hard, and very rough and dry, but the people are used to them from infancy, and little children may be seen gnawing at them as contentedly as ours with their bread-and-butter. If dipped in water and then toasted, they become almost as good as when fresh baked; and thus treated they were my daily substitute for bread with my coffee. Soaked and boiled they make a very good pudding or vegetable, and served well to economize our rice, which is sometimes difficult to get so far east.|$|E

40|$|Nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is well-established {{in assessing the}} binding affinity between low molecular weight ligands and proteins. However, conventional NMR-based binding assays are often limited to small proteins of high purity and may require elaborate isotopic labeling {{of one of the}} potential binding partners. As protein-polyphenol complexation is assumed to be a key event in polyphenol-mediated oral astringency, here we introduce a label-free, ligand-focused 1 H NMR titration assay to estimate binding affinities and characterize soluble complex formation between proteins and low molecular weight polyphenols. The method makes use of the effects of NMR line broadening due to protein-ligand interactions and quantitation of the non-bound ligand at varying protein concentrations by quantitative 1 H NMR spectroscopy (qHNMR) using electronic reference to access in vivo concentration (ERETIC 2). This technique is applied to assess the interaction kinetics of selected <b>astringent</b> <b>tasting</b> polyphenols and purified mucin, a major lubricating glycoprotein of human saliva, as well as human whole saliva. The protein affinity values (BC 50) obtained are subsequently correlated with the intrinsic mouth-puckering, astringent oral sensation imparted by these compounds. The quantitative NMR method is further exploited to study the effect of carboxymethyl cellulose, a candidate "anti-astringent" protein binding antagonist, on the polyphenol-protein interaction. Consequently, the NMR approach presented here proves to be a versatile tool to study the interactions between proteins and low-affinity ligands in solution and may find promising applications in the discovery of bioactives...|$|R

40|$|World apple {{production}} {{accounted for}} 80 million {{tons per year}} (1. 7 and 3. 1 Mts in France and Poland, respectively). Most of this production corresponds to dessert apples. However, in France, ciders (fermented apple juices) are famous beverages produced from specific apple varieties classified according to two main criteria: polyphenol concentration and acidity of the crude juice (i. e. the must). Indeed, polyphenols are divided into six main classes: phenolic acids, catechins, procyanidins (i. e. condensed tanins), dihydrochalcones, flavonols and anthocyanins. Depending on the considered classes, polyphenols more or less contribute to organoleptic qualities of ciders including colour, bitter and <b>astringent</b> <b>tastes,</b> colloidal stability (clearness/cloudiness) and also indirectly to some particular aromas. Now they are also well-known for their contribution to preserve human health through their presence in food. In this conference, I will present a review of our works {{in the field of}} varietal diversity, biochemistry, analytical chemistry and physico-chemistry of apple polyphenols in raw materials (fruits) and in processed products (musts, juices and ciders) with regard to their contribution to organoleptic properties. Particular attention will be paid to enzymatic and chemical oxidation reactions that occur during fruit processing and that contribute to significant changes in both qualitative and quantitative polyphenol composition in cider apple products. The impact of polyphenol molecular structures on solubility, tanning properties and sensory characteristics of polyphenols will be also discussed. Regarding methodological approaches, the benefits of associating chemical degradation, chromatographic separations, UV-visible and mass spectrometry detections for the analysis of complex phenolic structures and mixtures will be illustrated by examples. Research questions related to valorisation of apple by-products (apple pomaces) to produce natural colorant or related to the production of innovative apple products such as “Rosé” ciders and juices will be also discussed...|$|R
