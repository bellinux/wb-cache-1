500|$|Blade Runner delves {{into the}} effects of {{technology}} {{on the environment and}} society by reaching to the past, using literature, religious symbolism, classical dramatic themes, and film noir techniques. This tension between past, present, and future is mirrored in the [...] "retrofitted" [...] future depicted in the film, one which is high-tech and gleaming in places but decayed and outdated elsewhere. In an interview with The Observer in 2002, director Ridley Scott described the film as [...] "extremely dark, both literally and metaphorically, with an oddly masochistic feel". He also said that he [...] "liked the idea of exploring pain" [...] {{in the wake of his}} brother's death from skin cancer: [...] "When he was ill, I used to go and visit him in London, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> traumatic for me." ...|$|E
500|$|This episode {{does not}} feature Scully, as Gillian Anderson was busy still filming her final parts of Fight the Future. Noted actor Darren McGavin appears as Arthur Dales. He was {{requested}} {{for the part}} especially by Chris Carter. Casting director Rick Millikan noted, [...] "McGavin was Chris's inspiration for writing this series. He always had Darren in mind to use somewhere, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> his doing. He said 'I want Darren McGavin for this,' and {{he happened to be}} available, and we got him." [...] McGavin had originally been casting directors' first choice for the role of Senator Matheson for the second season opener [...] "Little Green Men". McGavin was later sought out to be Mulder's dad, but he again eluded the staff. In the end, McGavin finally agreed to appear on the show playing Dales, the agent who founded the X-Files.|$|E
500|$|The album {{also helped}} the Red Hot Chili Peppers earn a {{dedicated}} cult fanbase in Los Angeles. [...] One of these fans was John Frusciante, {{who would later}} join the band as guitarist after Slovak's death. [...] Frusciante recalled: [...] "The first time I saw the Red Hot Chili Peppers live was at the Variety Arts Center, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> amazing ... They were going for this real hard sound. [...] Hillel was doing all this awesome feedback and stuff. [...] It was the most magical experience I ever had {{in the experience of}} a show." [...] Frusciante based a lot of his playing style on Slovak's work, and explained, [...] "I learned everything I needed to know about how to sound good with Flea by studying Hillel's playing and I just took it sideways from there." ...|$|E
2500|$|The secretive {{nature of}} gay culture in Jamaica makes {{outreach}} nearly impossible. Fear of being identified as gay has forced many men into early marriages {{in the hopes}} of avoiding future accusations. Miriam Maluwa, the UNAIDS country representative for Jamaica, said, [...] " [...] marry fairly rapidly, they have children fairly rapidly to regularise themselves, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> a ticking bomb". Gay men forced into heterosexual marriage are bound to have extramarital affairs. These affairs put their wives at high risk for infection as well.|$|R
30|$|Nia: The store [J. Crew] is {{visually}} {{appealing to}} me, and I {{kind of like}} the mixture of classic stuff <b>and</b> things <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> feminine… <b>and</b> then they always have really great accessories. The style of the store really fits my personality.|$|R
2500|$|Nancy Pearl, a {{reviewer}} at Library Journal, felt <b>that</b> {{this book}} <b>was</b> mistakenly categorized as science fiction, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> it <b>is</b> <b>really</b> [...] "a philosophical {{novel about the}} nature of good and evil and what happens when a man tries to do the right thing, for the right reasons and ends up causing incalculable harm".|$|R
500|$|In March 2005, Radiohead {{began writing}} and {{recording}} new music in their Oxfordshire studio. In {{an effort to}} [...] "get out of the comfort zone", they decided against involving producer Nigel Godrich, with whom they had recorded five albums. At the Ether Festival in July 2005, Greenwood and Yorke performed {{a version of the}} future In Rainbows track [...] "Weird Fishes/Arpeggi" [...] with the London Sinfonietta orchestra and the Arab Orchestra of Nazareth. Regular recording sessions began in August 2005, with the band updating fans on their progress intermittently on their new blog, [...] The sessions were slow, and the band struggled to regain confidence; according to Yorke, [...] "we spent {{a long time in the}} studio just not going anywhere, wasting our time, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>really,</b> really frustrating." [...] Guitarist Ed O'Brien said the band considered splitting up, but kept working [...] "because when you got beyond all the shit and the bollocks, the core of these songs were really good." [...] They attributed their slow progress to a lack of momentum after their break and the lack of deadline and producer.|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} June 2013 at Filmistan, Mumbai. Hindustan Times {{reported that the}} set was ready at Filmistan studio, but following Chopra's father's death, the plans for shooting were put on hold. To make the boxing scenes authentic, some of the crew members, including Kumar himself, learnt boxing to get the necessary understanding of the sport to film the fight scenes. Initially, the makers had planned to use actors and teach them boxing to film the boxing scenes. They eventually realised {{that it would not}} be feasible and would be time-consuming. They also thought that if both Chopra and her opponents were not real boxers, it would not look convincing enough. Professional boxers were then employed to film the boxing sequences for giving a more natural feel and convincing look. Filming boxing scenes was difficult for Chopra as she got hurt several times; she says, [...] "They are real boxers and they don't know how to fake a punch, they had to really hit you. So I had to get hit a lot <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> hard." [...] Robert Miller, the sports coordinator for films such as Bhaag Milkha Bhaag and Chak De! India (2007), was hired to choreograph the fight sequences.|$|E
500|$|Chopra saw {{the deal}} as an {{opportunity}} to represent South Asia and challenge Indian stereotypes in Hollywood and the United States, saying: [...] "When I was in school , you never saw anyone who looked like us that was on TV. <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> weird for me because there's so many people of South Asian descent in America – in the world. I didn't want to be this stereotype of what Indian people are usually seen as in global pop culture. We don't just have to be Apu from The Simpsons." [...] After being given all 26 pilot scripts which ABC was filming for the 2015–2016 television season, she chose Quantico. The actress, who had appeared in over fifty films at that time, was required to audition for the first time, which she found nerve-wracking. Safran was impressed by Chopra's audition, which helped him re-envision the character, adding [...] "She walked into the room, and it was like the molecules shifted in that way that superstars have. I was very confused because I didn't know who she was, but we all sat up straighter. We're like this is clearly a movie star; it's like every {{hair on the back of}} your neck stands up watching her act. When I went back home I couldn't think about anyone else." [...] Chopra became the first South Asian to headline an American network drama series.|$|E

50|$|At {{the end of}} the show, host Steve Harvey mistakenly {{announced}} Miss Colombia Ariadna Gutiérrez as the winner. However, after Gutiérrez's crowning, Harvey {{returned to}} the stage <b>and</b> stated <b>that</b> he had misread the results <b>and</b> <b>that</b> Wurtzbach <b>was</b> <b>really</b> Miss Universe 2015. Paulina Vega (Miss Universe 2014) then removed the crown from Gutiérrez's head and placed it on Wurtzbach's head.|$|R
2500|$|A new album, Sounds {{from the}} Other Side, was {{released}} on 27 September 2013 by the Permanent Records label and distributed by Shock Records. Pete Laurie of theMusic website found [...] "isn't about reinventing the wheel, but it never sounds like a lazy rehash of {{the good old days}} either". Lewis explained to The Ages Martin Boulton [...] "We got to a point after the re-formation where we decided not to put an end date on it [...] we said we can't keep playing that same period [...] {{for the rest of our}} lives [...] While we love it and we know our fans love it … in order to be a relevant, creative unit [...] for our own personal satisfaction more than anything, we've got to try writing again and doing something new together <b>and</b> <b>that's</b> <b>been</b> <b>really</b> interesting <b>and</b> amazing". The group announced an Australian tour to promote the album during November and December 2013.|$|R
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Greg Hernandez, Mills explained: [...] "I {{knew that she was}} going to be a trouble maker but actually knowing the writers and the producers, I knew that the character would be rounded and have dimension <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> fun for me to play. It wasn’t one-note all the time, it was a lot of different colors." [...] Television personality Julie Chen said, [...] "The women of Knots, Michele Lee, Joan Van Ark, and Donna Mills have been compared to earth, wind, and fire, with Donna Mills bringing the heat as Abby, the conniving vixen that everybody loved to hate." [...] According to Mills, many people were wary of meeting her in person because they assumed she would be like Abby. She said, [...] "They were very trepedacious about what I was going to do." [...] Mike Celizic of NBC said that her character was [...] "the archetypal predatory female", while Meredith Vieira said [...] "even the bad girl could show a tender side every once in a while", in reference to her daughter's on-screen drug addiction. It was this very storyline that showed Abby at her most vulnerable and human, a story which audiences recall as perhaps one of her most desperate and motherly of moments. In addition to that, Abby also helped Val get her kidnapped babies back, even though she was blamed she said she [...] "could never do a thing like that to anyone". When Karen and Mack began to have some problems in their marriage and Karen distanced herself from Mack, Abby confronted Karen aggressively and told her she was wrong for doing so to him.|$|E
2500|$|Parker later {{spoke of}} how his musical {{relationship}} with Canyons came to be: [...] "They used to run a label which Tame Impala used to sort of be on. We released a 12” vinyl with them once, on one side it had three Tame Impala songs {{and on the other}} it was the same three songs remixed by Canyons <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> cool, it was a really casual relationship. We always talked about releasing things but we never got round to it because I’d just go round to his house and talk about music for a while. So we never actually got anything pressed until we had signed with Modular and then we went back and did stuff with Canyons." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Bunk Gardner, [...] "Cruising with Ruben & the Jets {{was an easy}} {{album to}} record. We were {{recording}} {{it at the same}} time as Uncle Meat because the songs were easy and very simple and didn't require a lot of time for arrangements and technical overdubbing. It was the beginning of the end for Ray Collins because all the new material Frank was writing was a little too far out and away from Ray's roots - which was Ruben-era material. Motorhead too was in his glory during the recording of this album. He loved Ruben <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> his kind of music to get nostalgic over - on stage and doing the dance steps and playing that music [...] I really enjoyed playing a solo on Ray's tune 'Anything'. I remember Frank, Ray and Roy standing in the control booth while I recorded my solo. Frank was telling me after the first take to keep it simple. So I nailed it on the second take and everyone was happy!" ...|$|E
25|$|In 1992, {{the first}} major {{biography}} of Joplin in two decades, Love, Janis, authored by her younger sister, Laura Joplin, was published. In an interview, Laura stated that Joplin enjoyed being on the Dick Cavett Show, that Joplin {{while growing up in}} Texas had difficulties with some people at school, but not the entire school, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> Joplin <b>was</b> <b>really</b> enthusiastic after performing at Woodstock in 1969.|$|R
2500|$|According to Trenin, Russians [...] "no longer {{recognize}} U.S. or European moral authority"—i.e., values gap. He said, [...] "from the Russian perspective, {{there is}} no absolute freedom anywhere in the world, no perfect democracy, <b>and</b> no government <b>that</b> does not lie to its people. In essence, all are equal by virtue of sharing the same imperfections. Some are more powerful than others, however, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> what <b>really</b> counts." ...|$|R

2500|$|The Black Keys began {{recording}} Turn Blue in January 2013 at Key Club in Benton Harbor, Michigan, {{during a}} break from their El Camino Tour. The studio had a rare Flickinger recording console custom built for Sly Stone that the band liked, and the location had been recommended by fellow rock band the Kills. For Turn Blue, {{just as they did}} for El Camino, the Black Keys entered the studio without having written any songs. Auerbach said, [...] "Every morning we got to the studio, we'd start from scratch {{and by the end of}} the day we'd have a new song <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> it." [...] The group spent 12 days at Key Club, sleeping above the studio and not once leaving the building. During these sessions, [...] "Gotta Get Away", [...] "It's Up to You Now", and the first half of [...] "Fever" [...] were recorded. Carney said that while in Michigan, the group was still trying to write hooky songs like they did for El Camino: [...] "we were still on that singles thing. I wanted [...] to let the record just breathe, and I think [...] wanted the songs to move along... There were some moments that got a little tense." [...] Carney added, [...] "We were kind of playing it safe. So we put the sessions on hold." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> the situation. The seven great trusts, working together, had pooled their {{enormous}} surpluses {{and made}} a farm trust. The railroads, controlling rates, and the bankers and stock exchange gamesters, controlling prices, had long since bled the farmers into indebtedness. The bankers, and all the trusts for that matter, had likewise long since loaned colossal amounts of money to the farmers. The farmers were in the net. All that remained to be done was the drawing in of the net. This the farm trust proceeded to do.|$|E
6000|$|... "Drive on to Freshitt Hall," [...] {{she said}} to the coachman, and any one looking at her might have thought that though she was paler than usual she was never {{animated}} by a more self-possessed energy. <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> her experience. It was as if she had drunk a great draught of scorn that stimulated her beyond the susceptibility to other feelings. She had seen something so far below her belief, that her emotions rushed back from it and made an excited throng without an object. She needed something active to turn her excitement out upon. She felt power to walk and work for a day, without meat or drink. And she would carry out the purpose with which she had started in the morning, of going to Freshitt and Tipton to tell Sir James and her uncle all that she wished them to know about Lydgate, whose married loneliness under his trial now presented itself to her with new significance, and made her more ardent in readiness to be his champion. She had never felt anything like this triumphant power of indignation in the struggle of her married life, in which there had always been a quickly subduing pang; and she took it as a sign of new strength.|$|E
500|$|Regarding Johnny Blaze, Schwartz {{said that}} [...] "Marvel TV is {{introducing}} {{the idea of}} multiple Ghost Riders into its mythology, which {{sets the stage for}} Robbie Reyes not being the only one possessed by the Spirit of Vengeance in this world. That's more than we could have hoped for Agents of SHIELDs take on the iconic Marvel hero." [...] She [...] speculated that a spin-off featuring Blaze and/or Reyes was now a realistic possibility. Buxton said that [...] "Marvel just established a much bigger Ghost Rider mythos <b>that</b> can <b>be</b> explored on TV, in movies, or Netflix <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> damn exciting." [...] Valentine felt the appearance was a [...] "pretty amazing development", and stated, [...] "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. almost seemed hamstrung by its connections to the Marvel Universe, seemingly unable to make a move without first consulting what precisely was happening in the movie universe. [...] we’re shown what Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. could have been all along: a sister piece that plays to the outer elements of the MCU that the movies haven’t been able to touch." ...|$|R
500|$|Concerns have <b>been</b> {{expressed}} <b>that</b> new fissures may be opening underground, allowing {{radioactive materials}} to leak into the ocean. [...] A 1996 Greenpeace study found <b>that</b> Cannikin <b>was</b> leaking both plutonium and americium into the environment,. [...] In 2004, scientific divers from the University of Alaska Fairbanks collected shallow subtidal organisms <b>and</b> reported <b>that</b> [...] "There <b>were</b> no indications of any radioactive leakage, <b>and</b> all <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> wonderful news."

500|$|... "I {{like her}} music! I think it’s like perfect pop music. That song [...] "Everytime"— I was always taken by that song. It has this real kind {{of beauty and}} airlessness and this {{haunting}} kind of morose lullaby effect and underneath it there’s some type of hardcore aggression <b>and</b> menace <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> connected to the film {{in the way that}} the film deals with the culture of surfaces, this candy-coated neon haze reality. Underneath it, there’s this subtext and feeling of this kind of darkness. It was a connection I felt." ...|$|R
6000|$|Fanny Assingham {{was there}} to explain away--of this she was duly conscious; for that at least had been true up to now. In the light, however, of Maggie's {{demonstration}} the quantity, even without her taking as yet a more exact measure, might well seem larger than ever. Besides which, with or without exactness, the effect of each successive minute in the place was to put her more in presence of what Maggie herself saw. Maggie herself saw the truth, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>really,</b> while they remained there together, enough for Mrs. Assingham's relation to it. There was a force in the Princess's mere manner about it that made the detail of what she knew a matter of minor importance. Fanny had in fact something like a momentary shame over her own need of asking for this detail. [...] "I don't pretend to repudiate," [...] she said after a little, [...] "my own impressions of the different times I suppose you speak of; any more," [...] she added, [...] "than I can forget what difficulties and, as it constantly seemed to me, what dangers, every course of action--whatever I should decide upon--made for me. I tried, I tried hard, to act for the best. And, you know," [...] she next pursued, while, {{at the sound of}} her own statement, a slow courage and even a faint warmth of conviction came back to her--"and, you know, I believe it's what I shall turn out to have done." ...|$|E
60|$|But the {{particular}} wasp at table I {{had in my}} mind remains to be spoken of. I was lunching {{at the house of}} a friend, the vicar of a lonely parish in Hampshire, and besides ourselves there were five ladies, four of them young, at our round table. The window stood open, and by-and-by a wasp flew in and began to investigate the dishes, the plates, then the eaters themselves, impartially buzzing before each face in turn. On his last round, before taking his departure, he continued to buzz so long before my face, first in front of one eye then the other, as if {{to make sure that they}} were fellows and had the same expression, that I at length impatiently remarked that I did not care for his too flattering attentions. <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> the only inconsiderate or inhospitable word his visit had called forth. Yet there were, I have said, five ladies present! They had neither welcomed nor repelled him, and had not regarded him; and although it was impossible to be unconscious of his presence at table, it was as if he had not been there. But then these ladies were cyclists: one, in addition to the beautiful brown colour with which the sun had painted her face, showed some dark and purple stains on cheek and forehead--marks of a resent dangerous collision with a stone wall at the foot of a steep hill.|$|E
