5000|$|The {{so-called}} [...] "perpetual inventory method" [...] (PIM) used {{to estimate}} fixed capital stocks was invented by Raymond W. Goldsmith in 1951 and subsequently used around the world. The basic idea of the PIM method is, that one starts off from a benchmark asset figure, and adds on the net <b>additions</b> <b>to</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>assets</b> year by year (using gross fixed capital formation data), while deducting annual depreciation, all data being adjusted for price inflation using a capital expenditure price index. In this way, one obtains a time series of annual fixed capital stocks. This data series can also be modified further with various other adjustments for prices, asset lifetimes etc. (several variants of the PIM approach are nowadays used by economic historians and statisticians).|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{incentives}} for <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> revaluation. The motives that are investigated include firm size, <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> intensity, firm foreign operations and acquisitions, firm indebtedness and earnings management inclination. Design/methodology - The study utilises logistic and linear regressions to test the hypothetical relations set up in the study. The categorisation of sample companies into those that perform asset revaluations and those that do not is based on the examination of firms' annual reports. Findings - The findings of the study provide evidence that firm size is positively related <b>to</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> revaluation. Firms with foreign operations, with low <b>fixed</b> <b>assets,</b> and with high debt capital needs are more likely <b>to</b> perform <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> revaluations. This is also the case for firms that carry out acquisitions. The study also shows that <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> revaluation is negatively related to earnings management. Research limitations/implications - Firms that revalue their <b>fixed</b> <b>assets</b> should examine the signals that are likely to be conveyed to investors about their managerial ability and financial prospects. Firms would tend <b>to</b> revalue their <b>fixed</b> <b>assets</b> when it is likely to result in maximum favourable financial consequences. Future research should investigate the possible opportunism in firms' behaviour, as well as the stock market reaction <b>to</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> revaluations. Originality/value - The paper is useful for investors and financial analysts, as it sheds light on the motives for <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> revaluations. The reporting of asset values based on fair values would assist them in making unbiased predictions about firms' future performance. The paper gives insight about the financial attributes of firms that perform <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> revaluations. For example, firms with capital needs would be inclined <b>to</b> undertake a <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> revaluation in order to reinforce their financial position.
