5|$|Kirchner was reelected in 2011. The Constitution of Argentina allows {{only one}} reelection. Many of her {{supporters}} proposed {{an amendment to}} the Constitution to allow indefinite reelections. Kirchner did not publicly support the proposal, but did not discourage or reject it either.

The first big demonstration (a cacerolazo) took place in September 2012. It was not called by specific politicians or social leaders, but by the public using social networks. The massive turnout was completely unexpected by both the government and the opposition.
