He made his Eredivisie debut {{four days later}} in a 2–0 home win over ADO Den Haag, replacing Arber Zeneli in the last seconds. After the game, he spoke to Fox Sports <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> pleased with his new surroundings. He scored his first goal for the Frisians on 18 May in his 15th appearance, a 3–1 home loss to FC Utrecht in {{the first leg of}} a play-off semi-final (5–2 aggregate).|$|E

25|$|A formal congressional {{subcommittee}} investigation {{began in}} summer 1959. Enright was revealed to have rigged Twenty One; Charles Van Doren also eventually came forth with revelations <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> persuaded to accept specific answers {{during his time}} on the show. These elements of the scandal were portrayed in the 1994 movie Quiz Show.|$|E

25|$|Another artist {{that ran}} {{afoul of the}} Oprys {{stringent}} standards was Jerry Lee Lewis, who, {{after several years of}} success on the country charts, made his first and only appearance on the show on January 20, 1973. Given two conditions for his appearance (no rock and roll and no profanity), Lewis proceeded to disregard both (referring to himself as a certain unairable maternal insult at one point) and, in a continuous 40-minute set, played a mixture of his rock and roll hits and covers of other singers' country songs. Lewis was said to be bitter <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> treated when he first arrived in Nashville in 1955 and supposedly used his Opry appearance to exact revenge on the Nashville music industry.|$|E
25|$|On 25 November 2008 V.V. Augustine, the Assistant Sub Inspector who {{prepared}} the First Information Report {{during the initial}} case investigation, was found dead. Police said he committed suicide by cutting the artery on his wrist and taking poison. A suicide note cited mental torture by the CBI. The CBI had alleged that Augustine had destroyed evidence and closed the case as a suicide, but the case diary revealed it was Augustine who pointed {{to the possibility of}} homicide. He had recorded that Abhaya could have seen something objectionable in the dining room and could have been silenced. In his personal diary, Augustine wrote <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> pressured by CBI to say that senior police officers tried to influence him.|$|E
500|$|Following his return, Gaveston's {{relationship}} with the major barons became increasingly difficult. He was considered arrogant, and he took to referring to the earls by offensive names, including calling one of their more powerful members the [...] "dog of Warwick". The Earl of Lancaster and Gaveston's enemies refused to attend parliament in 1310 because Gaveston would be present. Edward was facing increasing financial problems, owing £22,000 to his Frescobaldi Italian bankers, and facing protests <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> using his right of prises to acquire supplies {{for the war in}} Scotland. His attempts to raise an army for Scotland collapsed and the earls suspended the collection of the new taxes.|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} June 1956, {{his song}} [...] "Roll Over Beethoven" [...] reached number 29 on the Billboards Top 100 chart, and Berry toured {{as one of the}} [...] "Top Acts of '56". He and Carl Perkins became friends. Perkins said that [...] "I knew when I first heard Chuck that he'd been {{affected}} by country music. I respected his writing; his records were very, very great." [...] As they toured, Perkins discovered that Berry not only liked country music but also knew about as many songs as he did. Jimmie Rodgers was one of his favorites. [...] "Chuck knew every Blue Yodel and most of Bill Monroe's songs as well", Perkins remembered. [...] "He told me <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> raised very poor, very tough. He had a hard life. He was a good guy. I really liked him." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I Am Furious (Yellow)" [...] {{was written}} by John Swartzwelder and {{directed}} by Chuck Sheetz. It was first broadcast on Fox in the United States on April 28, 2002. The episode's storyline was pitched by Simpsons writer Matt Selman. In the DVD audio commentary for the episode, he stated that Matt Groening, {{the creator of the}} series, would usually tell the writers <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the class clown and did not pay attention in school, and yet grew up to become very successful. After hearing this, Selman thought that if Groening went back to his school to talk about his career, it [...] " [...] the last message that a principal and the teachers would wanna hear." [...] Selman pitched the story because {{he thought it would be}} [...] "humorously infuriating" [...] to teachers. The episode was also partly based on some of the Simpsons staff members' experience with making internet cartoons, such as Queer Duck and Hard Drinkin' Lincoln, both of which were created by Mike Reiss.|$|E
500|$|Homer's {{behavior}} {{has changed a}} number of times through the run of the series. He was originally [...] "very angry" [...] and oppressive toward Bart, but these characteristics were toned down somewhat as his persona was further explored. In early seasons, Homer appeared concerned that his family was going to make him look bad; however, in later episodes he was less anxious <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> perceived by others. In the first several years, Homer was often portrayed as sweet and sincere, but during Mike Scully's tenure as executive producer (seasons nine, 1997 to twelve, 2001), he became more of [...] "a boorish, self-aggrandizing oaf". Chris Suellentrop of Slate wrote, [...] "under Scully's tenure, The Simpsons became, well, a cartoon. [...] Episodes that once would have ended with Homer and Marge bicycling into the sunset [...] now end with Homer blowing a tranquilizer dart into Marge's neck." [...] Fans have dubbed this incarnation of the character [...] "Jerkass Homer". At voice recording sessions, Dan Castellaneta has rejected material written in the script that portrayed Homer as being too mean. He believes that Homer is [...] "boorish and unthinking, but he'd never be mean on purpose." [...] When editing The Simpsons Movie, several scenes were changed or otherwise toned down to make Homer more sympathetic.|$|E

50|$|After Richie {{finds out}} that Fonzie promised Pinky he would wrestle anyway, he {{promises}} the Fonz that he will tell everyone about his weakness. Fonzie laments <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> torn between being embarrassed or risking serious injury ("Maybe it's Time to Move On").|$|R
5000|$|The song <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> anti-Hollywood {{and that}} he's not a fake. The song {{is very similar}} to Lynyrd Skynyrd's [...] "All I Can Do Is Write About It". It was co-written by Arthur Penhallow Jr, C. Wojcik, and a local artist from Detroit, Michigan, Huck Johns.|$|R
500|$|Boston pitted former Yankee pitcher Mike Torrez {{against the}} Yankees' Cy Young Award winner, Ron Guidry, {{who took a}} 24–3 record into the game. The Sox were beating Guidry 2–0 {{in the top of}} the seventh inning when light-hitting Yankee shortstop Bucky Dent hit a two-out, three-run home run over Fenway Park's Green Monster to take a 3–2 lead. It was only his fifth home run of the season. The Yankees later led 5–2 and held on to win 5–4 when Yastrzemski popped out with runners on first and third, ending the Red Sox' season. Yankees closer Goose Gossage notched his 27th save of the season. Gossage would later comment years later <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> spat on at Fenway Park and had beer thrown in his face. [...] "There is no rivalry in sports that rivals the Yankees—Red Sox...that playoff game in '78–it felt like the playoffs and World Series were {{exhibition}} games after that." [...] The headline in The Boston Globe the next day summed it all up: [...] "Destiny 5, Red Sox 4." [...] New York went on to defeat the Kansas City Royals in the ALCS and the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series for their second straight championship.|$|E
500|$|Both sides {{committed}} {{human rights}} abuses in Anbar Province, often involving civilians {{caught in the middle}} of the conflict. [...] By late 2005, abuses had gotten so common that one American officer nonchalantly referred to [...] "discovering... 20 bodies here, 20 bodies there" [...] and the head of MNF-W referred to them as [...] "a cost of doing business." [...] During Operation Steel Curtain, insurgents forced their way into peoples' houses and held them hostage while engaging in gun battles with American forces, who often destroyed the homes. One Sunni Iraqi family described how in 2006 they fled the sectarian violence in Baghdad to Hīt. During their yearlong stay in Hīt, they watched AQI fighters kidnap a man for talking back to them; the fighters later dumped the man's body on his doorstep. The family also watched an American patrol hit a mine in front of their house, and worried that the Americans would conduct reprisal killings on the family. [...] An Iraqi sheikh spoke <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> accidentally shot and arrested by the Americans and thrown in Abu Ghraib prison where he was tortured. [...] After his release he was targeted by insurgents in Fallujah who thought he was an American spy.|$|E
500|$|Brian Donlevy as Professor Bernard Quatermass: Donlevy reprised {{his role}} as the eponymous professor, much to the despair of Nigel Kneale, who had heavily criticised his {{interpretation}} of the role in The Quatermass Xperiment. As had been the case on The Quatermass Xperiment, Donlevy's alcoholism presented challenges for the production. Nigel Kneale recalled visiting the set one day: “He [...] was so full of whiskey he could hardly stand up. He staggered over to the set and looked dazedly around. They held up an idiot board with his lines on and he said, “What's this movie called?” and they said, “Well, it's called Quatermass 2”. He said, “I've got to say all that? There's too much talk. Cut down some of the talk”. He tried to read it and he had to have go after go after go, so crippled with drink he hardly knew who he was”. Val Guest has denied Kneale's claims, saying “So many stories have been concocted since, <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a paralytic. It's absolute balls, because he was not paralytic. He wasn't stone cold sober either, but he was a pro and he knew his lines”. Guest also recalled, “By after lunch he would come to me and say “Give me a breakdown of the story so far. Where have I just been before this scene?” We used to feed him black coffee all morning but then we discovered he was lacing it. But he was a very professional actor and very easy to work with”.|$|E
5000|$|... "Heart of a Champion" [...] {{is a song}} by {{the rapper}} Nelly, {{released}} in 2004, from the album Sweat.

5000|$|He {{performed}} at the music festival Lollapalooza in Chicago in August 2011. In late 2011, Adams signed with RCA Records of Sony.

2500|$|Raymond Edward Brown {{remarks that}} in the {{canonical}} gospels [...] "not a word is reported about {{the form of the}} cross, <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> affixed, about the amount of the pain", but excludes the use for Jesus of a crux simplex, [...] "since he carried a cross to the place of execution".|$|E
2500|$|Corso {{published}} The Day After Roswell, <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{involved in}} the research of extraterrestrial technology recovered from the 1947 Roswell UFO Incident. On July 23, 1997, he was a guest on the popular late night radio show, Coast to Coast AM with Art Bell where he spoke live about his Roswell story. [...] This interview was rebroadcast by Coast to Coast AM on July 3, 2010.|$|E
2500|$|King's {{favorite}} singer was Frank Sinatra. In {{his autobiography}} he spoke <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a [...] "Sinatra nut" [...] {{and how he}} went to bed every night listening to Sinatra's classic album In the Wee Small Hours. During the 1960s Sinatra had arranged for King to play at the main clubs in Las Vegas. He credited Sinatra for opening doors to black entertainers who were not given the chance to play in [...] "white-dominated" [...] venues.|$|E
50|$|One of his gimmicks is {{the fact}} that he gets heel heat from the fans by {{sticking}} his tongue out at them and taunting them <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> manhandling their hero in the ring. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> proud of the fact that he does not have to get crude, use profanity, or become vulgar to get heel heat.|$|R
60|$|I {{would not}} have gone into this {{dissertation}} upon Syrian villages but {{for the fact that}} Nimrod, the Mighty Hunter of Scriptural notoriety, is buried in Jonesborough, and I wished the public to know <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> located.

Over Tracy's cries that Nathan is [...] "One of us",Tracy is redrugged and rehooded and Nathan walks away in darkness.|$|R
2500|$|He {{told the}} family that he was rehabilitated and about his desire for a new beginning. He wrote eloquently <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{studying}} in prison and referred to crimes he had committed as [...] "mistakes of his youth". The family believed that Schillaci was sincere and wanted {{to give him a}} place to stay after his release. Another reason for the family's trust was that Schillaci had gained acceptance to a Ph.D. program in Tufts University.|$|E
2500|$|Although he amassed {{such a large}} {{collection}} of art, he never attempted to sell any of it for profit, instead enjoying thinking <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> [...] "the wealthiest man in Europe." [...] It was all kept in his bedroom in his mother's house in Mulhouse, France. His room was kept in semi-darkness so the sunlight would not fade the paintings. A local framer did not recognize the art which he would re-frame for Nikolaus as being some of Europe's masterpieces. His mother, Marielle Schwengel, {{did not realize that}} the works were stolen and thought they were legitimately bought at auction, only later suspecting that he had not bought them legitimately.|$|E
2500|$|On March 23, 2004 he was [...] "traded" [...] (along {{with the}} Dudley Boyz) to the SmackDown! brand in {{exchange}} for Triple H, {{but as part of}} a new storyline, he appeared unhappy with the move calling SmackDown! [...] "the minor leagues" [...] and even disrespected Eddie Guerrero, the brand's WWE Champion, turning heel in the process. Later on, Booker T bragged <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the biggest star on SmackDown! and feuded with The Undertaker. Booker tried to utilize [...] magic to try to overcome his [...] "supernatural" [...] foe; however, it did nothing to prevent him from losing to the Undertaker at Judgment Day.|$|E
5000|$|After PepsiCo {{bought the}} soft drink Mountain Dew in 1964, they {{commissioned}} {{a set of}} advertisements featuring a [...] "Good Old Mountain Dew"-based jingle and the drink's hillbilly mascot.
