5000|$|Fine {{blanking}} presses {{are similar}} to other metal stamping presses, {{but they have a}} few critical additional parts. A typical compound fine blanking press includes a hardened die punch (male), the hardened blanking die (female), and <b>a</b> <b>guide</b> <b>plate</b> of similar shape/size to the blanking die. The guide plate is the first applied to the material, impinging the material with a sharp protrusion or stinger {{around the perimeter of the}} die opening. Next a counter pressure is applied opposite the punch, and finally the die punch forces the material through the die opening. Since the guide plate holds the material so tightly, and since the counter pressure is applied, the material is cut in a manner more like extrusion than typical punching. Mechanical properties of the cut benefit similarly with a hardened layer at the cut edge of the part. [...] Because the material is so tightly held and controlled in this setup, part flatness remains very true, distortion is nearly eliminated, and edge burr is minimal. Clearances between the die and punch are generally around 1% of the cut material thickness, which typically varies between 0.5 - 13 mm. Currently parts as thick as 19 mm can be cut using fine blanking. Tolerances between ±0.0003 - 0.002 in are possible, depending on base material thickness and tensile strength, and part layout.|$|E
50|$|The Sukhoi Shkval was {{designed}} as a two-engined interceptor with radar, two built-in aircraft guns and side-by-side afterburner engines. Two designs were investigated in the wind tunnel. These differed only {{in the form of the}} air intakes and the position of the canards. The first version with D-shaped air intakes, comparable to the Su-15, and canards in front of the cockpit, which extend to the radome, could not get through. The second concept with rectangular ramp air inlets (comparable to the air inlets of the MiG-25) and canards at the upper side edge of the air inlets got the advantage. The hull itself is similar to the fuselage of the Su-15 without landing gear, wing, fin and brake flaps. The four wings were fixed at the corners of the fuselage as a reclining X (comparable to the fictional X-wing fighter from Star Wars). On the four wings end were cylindrical containers, which in the lower part contain shock absorbers for take-off and landing. In the remaining part of these cylindrical containers were kerosene tanks, as in wings and the fuselage. The containers were externally provided with <b>a</b> <b>guide</b> <b>plate</b> as a continuation of the wing. Each wing has a rudder that functions as a rudder and aileron. In order to facilitate the vertical landing, the entire Ejection seat as well as the Thrust lever and the Side-stick were pivotally mounted in the cockpit in such a way that the ratio of the ejection seat to these control elements remained unchanged regardless of the pivoting position. The swivel device gave the pilot a better view of the ground / landing zone by a window in the cockpit floor. A cockpit section of the Sukhoi Shkval was built with the window in the ground and the swivel seat / instrument combination, with which this function could be tested and demonstrated, which happened several times. A two-axle trailer was also planned for the transport and erection of the Sukhoi Shkval.|$|E

This study investigated a customized guide plate for osteotomy placement in TKAs {{with the aid of}} the statistical shape model technique using weight-bearing lower-extremity X-rays and computed tomography (CT) images of the knee. Methods: From October 2014 to June 2015, 42 patients who underwent a TKA in Guizhou Provincial People's Hospital were divided into <b>a</b> <b>guide</b> <b>plate</b> group (GPG, 21 cases) and a traditional surgery group (TSG, 21 cases) using a random number table method. In the GPG group, <b>a</b> <b>guide</b> <b>plate</b> was designed and printed using preoperative three-dimensional measurements to plan and digitally simulate the operation. TSG cases were treated with the conventional method. Outcomes were obtained from the postoperative image examination and short-term follow-up. Results: Operative time was 49. 0 ± 10. 5 min for GPG, and 62. 0 ± 9. 7 min in TSG. The coronal femoral angle, coronal tibial angle, posterior tibial slope, and the angle between the posterior condylar osteotomy surface and the surgical transepicondylar axis were 89. 2 ± 1. 7 °, 89. 0 ± 1. 1 °, 6. 6 ± 1. 4 °, and 0. 9 ± 0. 3 ° in GPG, and 86. 7 ± 2. 9 °, 87. 6 ± 2. 1 °, 8. 9 ± 2. 8 °, and 1. 7 ± 0. 8 ° in TSG, respectively. The Hospital for Special Surgery scores 3 months after surgery were 83. 7 ± 18. 4 in GPG and 71. 5 ± 15. 2 in TSG. Statistically {{significant differences were found between}} GPG and TSG in all measurements. Conclusions: A customized guide plate to create an accurate osteotomy in TKAs may be created using lower-extremity X-ray and knee CT images. This allows for shorter operative times and better postoperative alignment than the traditional surgery. Application of the digital guide plate may also result in better short-term outcomes...|$|E

50|$|However, {{the area}} of the screen that can be {{dynamically}} adjusted {{is a function of the}} backlighting source. CCFLs are thin tubes that light up many rows (or columns) across the entire screen at once, and that light is spread out with diffusers. The CCFL must be driven with enough power to light the brightest area of the portion of the image in front of it, so if the image is light on one side and dark on the other, this technique cannot be used successfully. Displays backlit by full arrays of LEDs have an advantage, because each LED lights only a small patch of the screen. This allows the dynamic backlighting to be used on a much wider variety of images. Edge-lit displays do not enjoy this advantage. These displays have LEDs only along the edges and use <b>a</b> light <b>guide</b> <b>plate</b> covered with thousands of convex bumps that reflect light from the side-firing LEDs out through the LCD matrix and filters. LEDs on edge-lit displays can be dimmed only globally, not individually. For cost reasons, most of LCD TVs have edge-lit backlighting.|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{forefoot}} {{is frequently}} involved in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) {{resulting in a}} painful, handicapping deformity. The prevalence stated has long been based on a study from 1956. The most common surgical treatment has been a resection of the metatarsal joints (MTP), initially effective but often connected to recurrence of pain and deformity. Fusion instead of resection in MTP 1 seemed to produce better results. This operation is though technically more demanding. The aim of this thesis was to analyse and optimise the operative technique for fusion in MTP 1, {{to compare it to}} Mayo resection in MTP 1 in a prospective, randomised manner and to investigate the frequency and impact of foot problems in patients with RA today. Results: · A guide-plate may aid the positioning of the arthrodesis in recommended angles. The rounded cup and cone technique for preparation of the joint surfaces and two crossed cortical screws for fixation resulted in a high healing rate. · In comparing resection of MT heads 2 to 5 combined with either Mayo resection or fusion in MTP 1, after mean 3 years follow-up, we found excellent patient satisfaction rate, significant reduction of pain and handicap according to the Foot Function Index with no statistically significant differences between the groups. There were no recurrent prominences or tenderness under the forefoot in any group, no recurrent severe hallux valgus in the resection group and no increased risk for painful IP joint problems after fusion. The operating time was significant longer for fusion. · After mean 6 years follow-up, patient satisfaction rate was still excellent and the reduction in the parameters mentioned above was still significant with no differences between the methods. Gait velocity, step length, plantar moment, mean pressure or position of centre of force under the forefoot, measured in half of the patients. did not differ significantly either. Cadence (steps/min) was higher and stance phase (ground contact time) shorter in the fusion group. · In a study of 1000 RA patients, 80 %reported current foot problems, of which 86 %in the forefoot. In 45 % the forefoot had been involved in the debut of the disease. Difficulty in walking due to the feet was declared in 71 %. For 41 % the foot was the most important part and for 32 % the only part in the lower extremity causing reduced walking capacity. Conclusions: The positioning of a fusion in MTP 1 may be facilitated by the use of <b>a</b> <b>guide</b> <b>plate.</b> Careful preparation and fixation lead to a high healing rate. In a prospective, randomised study, both fusion and Mayo resection in MTP 1 as part of a total rheumatoid forefoot reconstruction resulted in significant and lasting reduction of pain, handicap and deformity with no statistically significant differences between the groups. Load distribution under the forefoot and time-and distance gait data, measured after 6 years, did not differ either, except in cadence and stance phase, possibly {{as a sign of the}} loss of motion in MTP 1 after fusion. The foot is still, during active medical treatment today, next to the hand, the most frequently symptomatic joint complex in RA. In 1 / 4 of the cases the foot caused walking disability and was twice as often as the knee or hip the only joint impairing the gait...|$|E

Next, a bicortical self-tapping lag screw is inserted eccentrically in the dynamic part of the combi-hole directly superior to the osteotomy putting the osteotomy under axial compression. Three self-tapping monocortical or bicortical (depending on bone quality and patient’s stature) screws are inserted in the remaining holes proximal of the lag screw. Finally, the lag screw is changed for a self-tapping bicortical locking screw inserted in the locking part of the combi-hole. After a final check with the image intensifier, the wound is closed over a non-suction drain. Care is taken to meticulously close the fascia lata before subcutaneous closure.
