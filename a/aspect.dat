5|$|<b>Aspect</b> weavers take {{instructions}} {{known as}} advice specified {{through the use}} of pointcuts and join points, special segments of code that indicate what methods should be handled by <b>aspect</b> code. The implementation of the <b>aspect</b> then specifies whether the related code should be added before, after, or throughout the related methods. By doing this, <b>aspect</b> weavers improve modularity, keeping code in one place that would otherwise have been interspersed throughout various, unrelated classes.|$|E
5|$|In the {{programming}} language AspectJ, pointcuts, join points, and the modularized code are defined in an <b>aspect</b> block {{similar to that}} of Java classes. Classes are defined using Java syntax. The weaving process consists of executing the <b>aspect</b> advice to produce only a set of generated classes that have the <b>aspect</b> implementation code woven into it.|$|E
5|$|The example {{at right}} shows a {{potential}} implementation of an <b>aspect</b> which logs the entry and exit of all methods. Without an <b>aspect</b> weaver, this feature would necessitate duplication of code {{in the class}} for every method. Instead, the entry and exit code is defined solely within the <b>aspect.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we examine}} the notion of {{functional}} <b>aspects</b> in context of aspect-oriented refactoring. Treating <b>aspects</b> as functions reduces the potential interactions between <b>aspects</b> significantly. We propose a simple mathematical model that incorporates fundamental properties of <b>aspects</b> and their interactions. Using this model, we show that with regard to refactoring functional <b>aspects</b> are as flexible as traditional <b>aspects,</b> but with reduced program complexity. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{previous}} researches {{showed that}} alliance performance was normally {{influenced by the}} structural <b>aspects</b> as well as psychological <b>aspects.</b> The structural <b>aspects</b> involves the characteristics of an alliance such as resource uniqueness, organization culture, number of partners, etc. Psychological <b>aspects</b> which are also called as relational capital determine the quality of collaboration. There are three key <b>aspects</b> of relational capital, namely, trust, commitment and communication. The previous researches examined the direct impact of structural and psychological <b>aspects</b> on alliance performance respectively, however, limited {{attention has been paid}} to treating those <b>aspects</b> as multiple and interrelated dependence relationships. This research attempts to examine how structural and psychological <b>aspects</b> interrelatedly affect alliance performance. This research uses 7 latent variables which consist of 3 exogenous constructs and 4 endogenous ones. The impact of structural and psychological <b>aspects</b> that are interrelatedly dependent on alliance performance was analyzed by AMOS 4. 01. Results show that there are significant interrelated dependence relationships among constructs. Structural <b>aspects</b> have significant direct impact on psychological <b>aspects.</b> Both structural and psychological <b>aspects</b> have significant direct impact on alliance performance. This research also shows that structural <b>aspects</b> have significant indirect impact on alliance performance through psychological <b>aspects</b> as mediating variables. The results support the stated hypotheses which were developed based on several previous researches. Alliance performance is the function of both structural and psychological <b>aspects.</b> Both of these <b>aspects</b> must be taken into consideration by partners entering into an alliance...|$|R

50|$|In medieval astrology, certain <b>aspects,</b> like certain planets, were {{considered}} to be either favorable (benefic) or unfavorable (malefic). Modern usage places less emphasis on these fatalistic distinctions. The more modern (but still unscientific) approach to astrological <b>aspects</b> is exemplified by research on astrological harmonics, of which John Addey was a major proponent, and which Johannes Kepler earlier advocated in his book Harmonice Mundi in 1619. But even in modern times, the <b>aspects</b> are divided into hard <b>aspects</b> or easy <b>aspects.</b> Major hard <b>aspects</b> being the square and opposition and the easy <b>aspects</b> as trine and sextile. The conjunction can be in either category depending on the planets that are connected.|$|R
5|$|<b>Aspect</b> weavers' {{performance}}, {{as well as}} {{the performance}} of the code that they produce, has been a subject of analysis. It is preferable that the improvement in modularity supplied by <b>aspect</b> weaving does not impact run-time performance. <b>Aspect</b> weavers are able to perform aspect-specific optimizations. While traditional optimizations such as the elimination of unused special variables from <b>aspect</b> code can be done at compile-time, some optimizations can only be performed by the <b>aspect</b> weaver. For example, AspectJ contains two similar but distinct keywords, thisJoinPoint, which contains information about this particular instance of woven code, and thisJoinPointStaticPart, which contains information common to all instances of code relevant to that set of advice. The optimization of replacing thisJoinPoint with the more efficient and static keyword thisJoinPointStaticPart can only be done by the <b>aspect</b> weaver. By performing this replacement, the woven program avoids the creation of a join point object on every execution. Studies have shown that the unnecessary creation of join point objects in AspectJ can lead to a performance overhead of 5% at run-time, while performance degradation is only approximately 1% when this object is not created.|$|E
