5|$|Rocks mined for {{phosphate}} fertilizers contain varying {{amounts of}} cadmium, {{resulting in a}} cadmium concentration {{of as much as}} 300mg/kg in the fertilizers and a high cadmium content in <b>agricultural</b> <b>soils.</b> Coal can contain significant amounts of cadmium, which ends up mostly in flue dust. Cadmium in soil can be absorbed by crops grown on the land such as in rice. Chinese ministry of agriculture officials have measured in 2002 that 28% of rice it sampled had excess of lead and 10% had an excess of cadmium above limited defined by law. Some plants such as willow trees and poplars have been found to clean both lead and cadmium from soil.|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} was initiated {{to assess the}} following objectives: (1) to measure the total calcium and magnesium content in <b>agricultural</b> <b>soil</b> and sewage sludge from the Mediterranean coastal area of Motril (southeastern Spain); (2) to determine the pH values of indicated samples in order to evaluate first their influence on calcium and magnesium content, and second on levels of these minerals in the main crop (sugar cane: Saccharum officinarum) grown in the area; (3) to study the influence of industrial activities, first on calcium and magnesium cantents and pH values in <b>agricultural</b> <b>soil,</b> and second on calcium and magnesium concentrations present in sugar cane samples; (4) to check if the calcium and magnesium levels existing in <b>agricultural</b> <b>soil</b> exert any influence on corresponding element uptake by sugar cane plants. Calcium levels found in <b>agricultural</b> <b>soil</b> were significantly higher (p < 0. 05) than those found in sewage sludge. Significant linear relationships between calcium and magnesium concentrations in <b>agricultural</b> <b>soil</b> and sewage sludge (p < 0. 005) were found. Calcium concentrations found in soil from the industrialized area (39. 2 ± 7. 2 mg g − 1) {{were significantly higher than}} those corresponding to the non-industrialized area (31. 0 ± 6. 6 mg g − 1). The pH values determined in <b>agricultural</b> <b>soil</b> were significantly influenced by industrial activity (p < 0. 05). The industrial activity and pH values measured in <b>agricultural</b> <b>soil</b> did not statistically influence either calcium or magnesium levels in the sugar cane plants.

25|$|In the Blyth estuary in Suffolk {{in eastern}} England, the mid-estuary reclamations (Angel and Bulcamp marshes) that were {{abandoned}} in the 1940s {{have been replaced by}} tidal flats with compacted soils from agricultural use overlain with a thin veneer of mud. Little vegetation colonisation has occurred in the last 60–75 years and has been attributed to a combination of surface elevations too low for pioneer species to develop, and poor drainage from the compacted <b>agricultural</b> <b>soils</b> acting as an aquaclude. Terrestrial soils of this nature need to adjust from fresh to saline interstitial water by a change in the chemistry and the structure of the soil, accompanied with fresh deposition of estuarine sediment, before salt marsh vegetation can establish. The vegetation structure, species richness, and plant community composition of salt marshes naturally regenerated on reclaimed agricultural land can be compared to adjacent reference salt marshes to assess the success of marsh regeneration.|$|E
2500|$|Since the 1850s, a large {{proportion}} of the world's grasslands have been tilled and converted to croplands, allowing the rapid oxidation of large quantities of soil organic carbon. [...] However, in the United States in 2004 (the most recent year for which EPA statistics are available), <b>agricultural</b> <b>soils</b> including pasture land sequestered 0.8% (46 teragrams) as much carbon as was released in the United States by the combustion of fossil fuels (5988 teragrams).

[...] Agriculture enhances nitrous oxide production through soil cultivation, {{the use of}} nitrogen fertilisers, and animal waste handling. These activities stimulate naturally-occurring bacteria to produce more nitrous oxide.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{and discusses}} data on baseline levels {{the concentration of}} U, Th and K in agricultural and grazing land soils across Europe. In total, 2218 samples of <b>agricultural</b> <b>soil</b> and 2127 samples of grazing land soil were collected with an average sampling density of 1 site per 2500 km 2 (a grid of 50 x 50 km) over an area of 5. 6 million km 2 across Europe. The uranium concentrations over the survey area vary from < 0. 1 to 23. 55 mg/kg in <b>agricultural</b> <b>soil</b> and from < 0. 1 to 73. 32 mg/kg in grazing land soil, with a median value of 0. 77 and 0. 74, respectively. The median Th content is 2. 89 mg/kg in <b>agricultural</b> <b>soil</b> and 2. 5 mg/kg in grazing land soil; the range varies from < 0. 1 to 63. 1 mg/kg in <b>agricultural</b> <b>soil</b> and < 0. 1 to 55. 64 mg/kg in grazing land soil. The median potassium content is 16 000 mg/kg in <b>agricultural</b> <b>soil</b> and 14 900 mg/kg in grazing land soil, with a range between 241 mg/kg and 79, 200 mg/kg in <b>agricultural</b> <b>soil</b> and between 241 mg/kg and 50000 mg/kg in grazing land soil. The new data define the soil geochemical U, Th and K baseline background for European agricultural and grazing land soil, providing information of crucial importance to increase our knowledge about ’soil quality’ at the European scale. Such data are essential for agriculture, animal and human health, setting of environmental standards, water quality, land use planning and the identification of mineral resource potential...|$|R

40|$|Periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus) is {{a mostly}} {{cultivated}} for its medicinal properties {{but it is}} also enjoyed worldwide as an ornamental plant due to its very beautiful flowers. Young leaves of periwinkle contain vinblastine and vincristine, which are compounds used to treat some cancers. This research was done to study the effects of two types of mycorrhiza and four variations of seedbed preparation on biochemical characteristics of periwinkle. Tests were done for evaluations of total alkaloids and concentrations and contents of vinblastine and vincristine. Tests were arranged as a factorial pot experiment based on a randomized complete block design with two factors. One of the factors was that of mycorrhiza; a control, Glomus mosseae and Glomus intraradices and the other factor was type of seedbed <b>soil</b> (only <b>agricultural</b> <b>soil,</b> mixture of <b>agricultural</b> <b>soil</b> + rotten animal manure + leaf mold + fine sand, mixture of <b>agricultural</b> <b>soil</b> + vermicompost, and mixture of <b>agricultural</b> <b>soil</b> + compost), tests were done in 3 replications during the year 2011 in Tehran, Iran. Results showed that application of G. mosseae increased amounts of total alkaloid and vinblastine in leaves but had no significant effect on amounts of vincristine.

30|$|The {{ratio of}} {{obtained}} kd values of U for undisturbed soil in groundwater to deionised water {{was found to}} be 1.92 and 1.58 at 25 °C and 50 °C respectively whereas for <b>agricultural</b> <b>soil</b> this ratio was obtained to be almost constant as 1.14 for both temperature. This clearly shows that the sorption of uranium onto undisturbed soil {{was found to be}} stronger than <b>agricultural</b> <b>soil</b> in both aqueous media at 25 °C. The high sorption onto undisturbed soil may be due to presence of high amount of finer particles in the form of silt (61 %) and clay (5 %) and less content of sand (34 %). The finer the particles, the greater the exchange surfaces of U and higher the binding capacity. The low sorption onto <b>agricultural</b> <b>soil</b> may be due to presence of high amount of coarse particles in the form of sand (56 %). Due to high content of sand, availability of exchange surfaces for U in soil is small and subsequently it released into the groundwater leading to low kd. The another reason for low kd in <b>agricultural</b> <b>soil</b> might be due to low abundances of total carbon content caused for the poor sorption and complexation processes on organic soil constituents. The ratio of carbon content in undisturbed to <b>agricultural</b> <b>soil</b> was observed to be 2.26.|$|R
