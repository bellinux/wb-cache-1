5|$|The folly and {{absurdity of}} the Queen in {{allowing}} this trumpery must strike every sensible and well-thinking mind, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> astonished the ministers themselves do not insist on her at least going to Osborne during the Exhibition, as no human being can possibly answer for what may {{occur on the}} occasion. The idea... must shock every honest and well-meaning Englishman. But it seems everything is conspiring to lower us {{in the eyes of}} Europe.|$|E

She was once noted as saying: The Democratic party is one that I've always observed.

Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Kennedy have done so much in that regard for the two generations they've won over during their career course.|$|E

5|$|I am {{at first}} {{inclined}} to agree... But on re-reading the whole Ode, this line {{strikes me as}} a serious blemish on a beautiful poem, and the reason must be either that I fail to understand it, or that it is a statement which is untrue. And I suppose that Keats meant something by it, however remote his truth and his beauty may have been from these words in ordinary use. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure that he would have repudiated any explanation of the line which called it a pseudo-statement... The statement of Keats seems to me meaningless: or perhaps {{the fact that it is}} grammatically meaningless conceals another meaning from me.|$|E
5|$|I was {{of course}} happy to meet the Hizbullah people, {{because it is a}} point of view that is rarely heard in the United States. I have no problem saying that I do want to express {{solidarity}} with them, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{not going to be a}} coward of (sic) a hypocrite about it. I don't care about Hizbullah as a political organization. I don't know much about their politics, and anyhow, it's irrelevant. I don't live in Lebanon. It's a choice that the Lebanese have to make: Who they want to be their leaders, who they want to represent them. But there is a fundamental principle. People have the right to defend their country from foreign occupiers, and people have the right to defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country. That to me is a very basic, elementary and uncomplicated question.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} mihrab, {{uncovered in}} 1933, has a semi-dome above {{it with a}} marble column on either side. Intricate stucco decorations were a prominent feature of the mosque, with the mihrab and the walls ornately decorated. The mihrab had two sets of verses from the Quran inscribed in the conch, which is still intact. The first set of verses are the three that open al-Mu’minoon:Successful indeed are the believers – who are humble in their prayers – and who avoid vain talkThe next inscription {{is made up of}} verses 162 and 163 of al-An'am:Say: Surely my prayer and my sacrifice and my life and my death are (all) for Allah, the Lord of the worlds – No associate has He; and this am I commanded, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> the first of those who submit.These inscriptions are the only surviving piece of decoration that has been definitively traced to the Fatimids.|$|E
