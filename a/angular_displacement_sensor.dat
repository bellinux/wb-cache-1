For example, Droste and Teisseyre (1976) derived rotations from an array of seismographs. Arrays of translational sensors (as standard accelerometers) were also used by Spudich et al.

The development of more compact (and cheaper) sensors based on electrochemical magnetohydrodynamic technology allowed easier field deployment, used, for example, by Liu et al.

40|$|In this paper, <b>angular</b> <b>displacement</b> and <b>angular</b> {{velocity}} <b>sensors</b> {{based on}} coplanar waveguide (CPW) transmission lines and S-shaped split ring resonators (S-SRRs) are presented. The sensor {{consists of two}} parts, namely a CPW and an S-SRR, both lying on parallel planes. By this means, line-to-resonator magnetic coupling arises, the coupling level being dependent on the line-to-resonator relative angular orientation. The line-to-resonator coupling level is the key parameter responsible for modulating the amplitude of the frequency response seen between the CPW ports {{in the vicinity of}} the S-SRR fundamental resonance frequency. Specifically, an amplitude notch that can be visualized in the transmission coefficient is changed by the coupling strength, and it is characterized as the sensing variable. Thus, the relative angular orientation between the two parts is measured, when the S-SRR is attached to a rotating object. It follows that the rotation angle and speed can be inferred either by measuring the frequency response of the S-SRR-loaded line, or the response amplitude at a fixed frequency in the vicinity of resonance. It is in addition shown that the angular velocity can be accurately determined from the time-domain response of a carrier time-harmonic signal tuned at the S-SRR resonance frequency. The main advantage of the proposed device is its small size directly related to the small electrical size of the S-SRR, which allows for the design of compact <b>angular</b> <b>displacement</b> and velocity <b>sensors</b> at low frequencies. Despite the small size of the fabricated proof-of-concept prototype (electrically small structures do not usually reject signals efficiently), it exhibits good linearity (on a logarithmic scale), sensitivity and dynamic range.

40|$|The {{variable}} displacement pump control system has greater energy-saving advantages and application prospects than the valve control system. However, the {{variable displacement}} pump control of differential cylinder is not concurrent with the existing technologies. The asymmetric pump-controlled cylinder is, therefore, used to balance the unequal volume flow through a single rod cylinder in closed-circuit system. This {{is considered to be}} an effective method. Nevertheless, the asymmetric axial piston pump (AAPP) is a constant displacement pump. In this study, variable-displacement asymmetric axial piston pump (VAPP) is investigated according to the same principle used in investigating AAPP. This study, therefore, aims at investigating the characteristics of VAPP. The variable-displacement output of VAPP is implemented by controlling the swash plate angle with angle feedback control circuit, which is composed of a servo proportional valve and an <b>angular</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>sensor.</b> The <b>angular</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>sensor</b> is connected to the swash plate. The simulation model of VAPP, which is set up through the ITI-SimulationX simulation platform, is used to predict VAPP’s characteristics. The purpose of implementing the experiment is to verify the theoretical results. Both the simulation and the experiment results demonstrated that the swash plate angle is controlled by a variable mechanism; when the swash plate angle increases, the flow of Port B and Port T increases while the response speed of Port B and Port T also accelerates. When the swash plate angle is constant, the flow of Port B and Port T increases along with the increase of pump speed, although the pressure-response speed of Port B is faster than that of Port T. Consequently, the flow pulsation of Port B and Port T tends to decrease gradually along with the increase of pump speed. When the pressure loaded on Port B equals to that of Port T, the flow ripple cycle of Port B is longer than that of Port T, whereas the peak flow of Port B is higher than that of Port T. Since the flow ripple of Port T is bigger than that of Port B, Port T should be connected to the low pressure sides or the oil tank so that it does not affect VAPP’s performance. Further, to avoid the backflow of VAPP from Port T to Port B, Port T cannot be loaded alone, and the loading pressure of Port T also cannot exceed that of Port B...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the design, development {{and testing of}} a novel sensor based on optical interferometry that measures displacement to 6 degree of freedom (DoF). It starts with an in-depth mathematical analysis of the behaviour of the radiant flux over the active area of a rectangular photodetector under varying mirror tilt angle, width of photodetector active area, distance of photodetector from beam centre, distance of the photo-detector from the optical origin and light source wavelength. Findings not evident in the literature are presented, such as flux behaviour beyond the first modulation amplitude zero {{and the effect of}} fringe contraction and expansion on the flux at varying distance from beam centre and optical origin. The outcome of the analysis was crucial for deciding to use image sensors rather than photodetectors for this <b>displacement</b> <b>sensor.</b> Obtaining tilt and rotation information from the interferogram is discussed as well as the orthogonal design of the sensor. The mathematics for deriving the position vectors of displaced mirrors from the fringe analysis is given in detail. An experiment rig was built to test the sensor that included an XYZ translation stage as well as a Tilt/Rotation stage, which together provided a means of displacing the interferometer cube mirror to 6 DoF.

The geometrical parameters analyzed were the lens focal length, the gap between fibers, the fibers cladding radii, the emitting fiber critical angle (or, equivalently, the emitting fiber numerical aperture), and the standoff distance (distance between the lens and the reflective surface). Besides, we analyzed the sensor sensitivity regarding any spurious linear displacement. The simulation and experimental results showed that the parameters which play the most important roles are the emitting fiber core radius, the lens focal length, and the light coupling efficiency, while the remaining parameters have little influence on sensor characteristics.

Indeed, Fig.  6 d shows that there is a strong correlation between magnitude and PGTA (or PGRV), whereas, for the other datasets, the magnitudes are better “distributed” along the whole dataset distribution (see Fig.  3). The Takeo (2009) dataset is relatively different from the other ones as it recorded signals from a swarm at very short distances.
