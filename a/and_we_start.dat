I knew that was a catalyst to really turn up the team, to get a little bit more out of everyone. Denny goes down with his knee injury. He comes back, obviously not 100 percent. The team steps up. We narrow the gap to try to pick him up knowing he's not going to be there, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>start</b> winning races, even with a driver that is not 100 percent. Now that he's coming back healthier each week, we're winning more and more. I simply think that's the catalyst for us to move forward. It's easier when the morale is high to get a little bit more out of your guys. Our benchmark is ourselves and we're just trying to work on that." ...|$|E
2500|$|John Paesano {{sought out}} the {{composer}} role for the first Marvel/Netflix series, Daredevil, after he had previously worked with showrunner Steven S. DeKnight on a proof of concept. After successfully auditioning for the job, Paesano joined the series several weeks into post-production, and had to provide around 25–30 minutes of music per episode. He averaged [...] "around an episode every four or five days". DeKnight [...] "had a very clear vision of what he wanted. He wanted to really keep the show grounded {{and he wanted to}} make it feel real and not so fantastical like some of the other Marvel properties were. He wanted music you could feel and not necessarily hear. We cut the score to be minimalistic." [...] Once Daredevil gets his superhero costume {{at the end of the}} first season, [...] "the music starts to change color <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>start</b> to get more in to that Marvel universe." [...] Due to his schedule and the style of the score, Paesano ultimately used mostly electronic sounds and music, but did try to add acoustic instruments, such as cellos, where possible to have more of a hybrid sound, often using these in non-traditional ways. Instead of more traditional percussion, Paesano used a low pulse throughout the series, emulating a heartbeat since the titular character often listens to people's heartbeats with his heightened senses. Paesano took inspiration from James Newton Howard's Michael Clayton score for the series' lawyer-oriented scenes.|$|E
