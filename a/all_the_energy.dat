5|$|The {{way this}} man's dark hair grows, with the sharp {{dip in the}} middle of his high forehead, as though concentrating there <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> of the {{masculine}} M, makes his face different from all the others. His coal-black eyes are rigidly focused in a gaze that expresses compelling force. The nose is unusually long and boldly curved. The mouth is wide and sensual, but the lips are firmly shut in a straight line, the corners strongly marked and tightened into final points, and this strengthens the impression — already suggested by the eyes — of a strong controlling will. It is an extraordinarily fascinating face, reminding us of faces of famous men, especially of Machiavelli's; and indeed the whole aspect of the head suggests something Mediterranean, as though this man had acquired his frank, searching, superior air at Italian academies.|$|E
5|$|Mulder goes {{to visit}} Madame Zirinka again, who {{tells him that}} the planets come into {{alignment}} like this only once every 84 years, and additional alignments will cause anyone born on January 12, 1979 (Margi and Terri's birthdate) to have <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> in the cosmos focused on them. Margi goes to see Scott alone but an angry Terri arrives. The two argue {{with each other and}} end up accidentally killing Scott. Margi goes to Mulder, telling him that Terri is responsible for the murders, while Terri goes to see Scully and tells her the opposite. The agents call each other and bring both girls to the police station, where the place starts shaking and all the guns go off on their own. Mulder locks the girls in a room together and their power goes away once the clock ticks midnight. When the town mob and Detective White finally see Terri and Margi as the culprits, Spitz claims it was the work of Satan, oblivious to the cosmic alignment's energy. Mulder and Scully drive home, arguing again over directions; when Scully defiantly runs a stop sign, Mulder notifies her but she tells him to shut up, which he does.|$|E
25|$|Since {{a finite}} {{universe}} is an isolated system, the Second Law of Thermodynamics states that its total entropy is constantly increasing.

25|$|Fischer–Tropsch plants {{associated}} with coal or related solid feedstocks (sources of carbon) must first convert the solid fuel into gaseous reactants, i.e., CO, H2, and alkanes. This conversion is called gasification {{and the product}} is called synthesis gas ("syngas"). Synthesis gas obtained from coal gasification tends to have a H2:CO ratio of ~0.7 compared to the ideal ratio of ~2. This ratio is adjusted via the water-gas shift reaction. Coal-based Fischer–Tropsch plants produce varying amounts of CO2, depending upon the energy source of the gasification process. However, most coal-based plants rely on the feed coal to supply <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> requirements of the Fischer–Tropsch process.|$|E
25|$|The {{main source}} of light on Earth is the Sun. Sunlight {{provides}} the energy that green plants use to create sugars mostly {{in the form of}} starches, which release energy into the living things that digest them. This process of photosynthesis provides virtually <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> used by living things. Historically, another important source of light for humans has been fire, from ancient campfires to modern kerosene lamps. With the development of electric lights and power systems, electric lighting has effectively replaced firelight. Some species of animals generate their own light, a process called bioluminescence. For example, fireflies use light to locate mates, and vampire squids use it to hide themselves from prey.|$|E

The second Death Star was significantly larger, between 200km to 400km in diameter depending on source, and technologically more advanced than its predecessor.

25|$|Black-body radiation, the {{emission}} of electromagnetic energy {{due to an}} object's heat, could not be explained from classical arguments alone. The equipartition theorem of classical mechanics, the basis of all classical thermodynamic theories, stated that an object's energy is partitioned equally among the object's vibrational modes. But applying the same reasoning to the electromagnetic emission of such a thermal object was not so successful. That thermal objects emit light had been long known. Since light {{was known to be}} waves of electromagnetism, physicists hoped to describe this emission via classical laws. This became known as the black body problem. Since the equipartition theorem worked so well in describing the vibrational modes of the thermal object itself, it was natural to assume that it would perform equally well in describing the radiative emission of such objects. But a problem quickly arose: if each mode received an equal partition of energy, the short wavelength modes would consume <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>energy.</b> This became clear when plotting the Rayleigh–Jeans law which, while correctly predicting the intensity of long wavelength emissions, predicted infinite total energy as the intensity diverges to infinity for short wavelengths. This became known as the ultraviolet catastrophe.|$|E
