50|$|Margaret Gale Kidwell (born August 17, 1933) is a British American {{evolutionary}} {{biologist and}} Regents’ Professor Emerita at the University of Arizona, Tucson. She {{grew up on}} a farm in the English Midlands during World War II. After graduating from the University of Nottingham in 1953, she worked in the British Civil Service as an <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Advisory</b> <b>Officer</b> from 1955-1960. She moved to the USA in 1960 under the auspices of a Kellogg Foundation Fellowship to study Genetics and Statistics at Iowa State University. She married quantitative geneticist James F. Kidwell in 1961, obtained her MS degree in 1962 and moved with her husband to Brown University in 1963. She received her PhD from Brown University in 1973 under the guidance of Masatoshi Nei. From 1973 to 1984 she pursued independent research into a number of anomalous genetic phenomena in Drosophila which later lead to collaborative studies resulting in the discovery of hybrid dysgenesis and the isolation of transposable P elements. After appointment as Professor of Biology at Brown University in 1984 she moved to the University of Arizona in 1985 as Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. Additional positions included Chair of the Interdisciplinary Genetics Program from 1988-1991 and Head of the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from 1992-1997. Research at the University of Arizona has increasingly focused on the evolutionary significance of transposable genetic elements. In 1996, she was the first woman from Arizona to be elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences.|$|E

40|$|The article {{provides}} {{a conceptual framework}} and discusses research methods for analyzing pluralistic <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> services. The framework can also assist policy-makers in identifying reform options. It addresses the following question: Which forms of providing and financing <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> services work best in which situation? The framework 'disentangles' <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> services by distinguishing between (1) governance structures, (2) capacity, (3) management, and (4) advisory methods. The framework suggests an impact chain approach to analyze the performance and impact of <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> services and discusses theoretical and empirical research methods {{that can be used}} when applying the framework. The framework shows that reforms of <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> services can combine different reform elements—such as decentralization, contracting out, using new advisory methods, and changing the management style—in different ways so as to best fit local circumstances. Using a New Institutional Economics approach (transaction costs approach), the article shows that the following sets of contextual factors need to be considered in this regard: the policy environment; the capacity of potential service providers; the type of production systems and market access of farm households; and the characteristics of local communities. The framework can be used to develop assessment tools for <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> services, to inform processes of reforming of <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> services and to guide inter-disciplinary research. The framework is unique in combining the insights from different disciplines, which have, so far, been treated separately in the literature. The framework can help policy-makers and analysts to move from 'ideological' discussions on reform models to an evidence-based 'best fit' approach...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{develops}} {{a framework for}} the design and analysis of pluralistic <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> services and reviews research methods from different disciplines {{that can be used}} when applying the framework. <b>Agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> services are defined in the paper as the entire set of organizations that support and facilitate people engaged in agricultural production to solve problems and to obtain information, skills and technologies to improve their livelihoods and well-being [...] . To classify pluralistic <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> services, the paper distinguishes between organizations from the public, the private and the third sector that can be involved in (a) providing and (b) financing of <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> services. The framework for analyzing pluralistic <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> services presented in the paper addresses the need for analytical approaches that help policy-makers to identify those reform options that best fit country-specific frame conditions. Thus, the paper supports a shift from a “one-size-fits-all” to a “best fit” approach in the reform of public services [...] . Based on a review of the literature, the paper presents a variety of quantitative and qualitative methodological approaches derived from different disciplines that can be applied when using the framework in empirical research projects. The disciplines include agricultural and institutional economics, communication theory, adult education, and public administration and management. The paper intends to inform researchers as well as practitioners, policy-makers and development partners who are interested in supporting evidence-based reform of <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> services.

40|$|The present article {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of local governance on <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> services in Tajikistan. The Central Asian Republic of Tajikistan is an agricultural country that {{has been described as}} a hybrid state, where local governance tends to be dominated by a few powerful actors. Local governance processes do have a strong influence on the agriculture practise and on the exchange of the knowledge. <b>Agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> services claim various effects in the country. Especially in regions that are dominated by monocultures, advisory services have limited success. Therefore the present article assumes that the nexus of knowledge and innovation in Tajik agriculture is largely dependent on the decision-making of local governance processes.

A literature review and expert opinion for analysis is provided to illustrate the findings, indicating different understandings of the concept of extension, and that extension actors are organised in sub-regional networks and countries as a link to GFRAS, AFAAS, and the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD), sub-program CAADP.

Use the methods was analyzed {{as a process of}} co-production in which farmers, NGOs and the public sector share the costs of <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> service provision. The analysis assesses to what extent participatory methods provide protocols that facilitate co-production. In all cases, the participatory method helped to create pre-conditions for co-production by catalyzing powersharing and the development of new rights and responsibilities in the performance of coproduced <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> services. In several respects the utility to the poor of technology and extension services improved. But the absence of external support from powerful decisionmaking bodies with control over important resources restricted the benefits poorly organized farmers could obtain from co-production of these services, even when public policy in support of their participation was in place. While use of SEP or CIAL cannot overcome the structural power inequalities that lead research and extension to neglect poor farmers’ needs, the methods undoubtedly trigger a process in which farmers become more assertive about what they want and less accepting of bad quality <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisory</b> services, poorly oriented training, inappropriate technologies, untested recommendations and unmet election promises...|$|R
