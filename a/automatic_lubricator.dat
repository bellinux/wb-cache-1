5000|$|An <b>automatic</b> <b>lubricator,</b> is {{a device}} fitted to a steam engine to supply {{lubricating}} {{oil to the}} cylinders and, sometimes, the bearings and axle box mountings as well. [...] There are various types of <b>automatic</b> <b>lubricator,</b> which include various designs of displacement, hydrostatic and mechanical lubricators.|$|E
5000|$|When Elijah McCoy {{arrived in}} Michigan, {{he could find}} work only as a fireman and oiler at the Michigan Central Railroad. In a home-based machine shop in Ypsilanti, Michigan McCoy also did more highly skilled work, such as {{developing}} improvements and inventions. He invented an <b>automatic</b> <b>lubricator</b> for oiling the steam engines of locomotives and ships, patenting it in 1872 as [...] "Improvement in Lubricators for Steam-Engines" [...] (...)

50|$|Oil {{is drawn}} from the sump by the oil pump and {{delivered}} to the three inner main bearings and to the other bearings within the crank chamber. Oil is led into {{the centre of the}} crankpins by oil scoops which lubricate the big end bearings from inside. The end main bearings and each of the four cylinders receive measured doses of oil through a mechanical <b>automatic</b> <b>lubricator.</b> This lubricator, driven by chain, contains positive pumps to force the oil through each of six feed-pipes. Mounted on the dashboard the lubricator's sight glasses give visual confirmation oil is circulating.|$|E

5000|$|During the {{restoration}} of 4501, the locomotive {{received a lot of}} upgrades with its trailing wheel modified with roller bearings to help guide the engine steer through curve tracks. A replica of a Worthington SA type feedwater heater from a China Railways QJ Class 2-10-2 was built to improve the locomotive's performance along with its tender modified with a mechanical stoker that came from a Canadian National Railway 4-6-2. The Armstrong lubricators that spring loaded the driving wheels are replenished by an <b>automatic</b> <b>lubricator</b> from the North Yorkshire Moors Railway in North Yorkshire, England. 4501's boiler also received attention and was re-certified from her operating pressure [...] to increase of , the higher operating pressure also gives a small boost to tractive effort.|$|E
5000|$|On July 13, 1976, two trains collided, {{killing two}} and {{injuring}} 29. In October 1976, the CDOT released their report which only blamed the engineer of the northbound train (Number 1994) for excessive speed. The engineer's union contended {{that there was}} a problem with the train brakes, {{that there was a}}n <b>automatic</b> track <b>lubricator</b> which had been putting down excessive oil for two weeks before the incident and an insufficient signal system. The National Transportation Safety Board released their final report on the incident on May 19, 1977 as Report Number RAR-77-04. That report concluded that the cause was [...] "the failure of the engineer of train No. 1994 to perceive the train ahead and to apply the brakes at the earliest possible time". It also cited problems with the design of the signal system, design of the M2's exit doors and interior design of the trains.|$|R
