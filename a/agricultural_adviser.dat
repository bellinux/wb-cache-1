40|$|Climate {{changes and}} the {{associated}} higher frequency of heat waves in Middle-European countries will aggravate occupational heat stress experienced by Slovenian workers. Appropriate behavioral adaptations are important coping strategies and it is pertinent to establish if knowledge among advisers and workers is sufficient and identify the symptoms experienced by workers. Therefore a survey including 230 farmers and 86 <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisers</b> was completed. Thermal comfort ranged from hot to extremely hot for 85 ± 5  % of farmers working outside and heat stress had {{a negative impact on}} well-being (74 ± 6  %), productivity (68 ± 6  %) and concentration (34 ± 6  %). Reported symptoms were excessive sweating (84 ± 5  %), thirst (81 ± 5  %), and tiredness (59 ± 6  %). Women had a higher prevalence of headache (64 ± 10  %) compared to males (47 ± 8  %), higher frequency of fatigue (69 ± 10 vs 56 ± 8  %), and incidents with nausea or vomiting (19 ± 8 vs 9 ± 5  %). 81 ± 4  % of the responders reported that more time is required to complete tasks when the weather is hot. Nevertheless, 61 ± 6  % of farmers have never been informed of the impacts of heat stress and 29 ± 10  % of the <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisers</b> does not include this information in their guidance. This emphasizes the need for increased information and implementation of feasible solutions to mitigate the negative impact of heat stress on workers in the agricultural sector. </p...|$|R

Above all, they showed huge ingenuity in demonstrating their devotion to their farmer clients, without evading the framework set by their employers. These capacities for adaptation so essential to their profession were initially highly valued. Then, from the 1970 s onwards, they attracted criticism for their failure to conform to the new imperatives of bureaucratisation, specialisation and commercialisation in agricultural advice...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{is concerned with}} the dynamic relationship between <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisers,</b> knowledge and soil in England. On the basis that <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisers</b> have always {{played a central role in}} linking research and farming practice and implementing policy on the farm, the thesis explores the role of the adviser in facilitating a shift towards sustainable soil management (which encompasses a range of complex and knowledge intensive practices) and to the realisation of policy objectives in this domain. Specifically it aims to provide detailed empirical evidence of the role that <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisers</b> play in the acquisition, utilisation, generation and transfer of knowledge about soil best management practice and to elicit the factors that enable and constrain these knowledge processes. Conceptually, the research draws on approaches to knowledge and knowledge processes in agriculture from the allied disciplines of rural geography, rural sociology and extension science. An actor-oriented Agricultural Knowledge and Information System (AKIS) approach provides the basis for examining adviser interactions with both the research and farming communities. While the AKIS describes the factors that enable and constrain how advisers engage in knowledge processes in terms of connections across institutional interfaces between research, advice and farming, an actororiented approach, which understands knowledge processes as social processes operating across social interfaces, enables exploration of how individual advisers behaving as autonomous agents resolve these constraining and enabling factors. The- study, combining quantitative and qualitative methods, employs an extensive postal questionnaire survey of a 163 <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisers</b> from across England and three detailed case studies where sustainable soil management is a central theme, namely: the Landcare Project; the UK Soil Management Initiative; and the SUNDIAL Fertiliser Recommendation System. The data describe an advisory community with a range of involvement, concerns and competence in soil management. Patterns of acquisition and utilisation of knowledge about soil best management practice revealed by the questionnaire data suggest that advisers are actively seeking and using knowledge about soil management, although some are more constrained than others in accessing it. These patterns, however, only provide a partial understanding of the complex knowledge processes in which advisers engage as they operate at the boundaries between science and practice. As such, qualitative data from the case studies are used to reveal that, in bridging the different institutional cultures and life worlds of research and practice, advisers encounter different understandings and expectations of soil best management practices. Rather than simply acquiring, utilising and transferring knowledge, the data reveal that advisers negotiate, adapt, transform, generate and integrate knowledge about soil as they struggle to reconcile the principles of research-based soil best management practice with the practical and business constraints of the farm. In doing this advisers, and agronomists in particular, tend to closely align themselves with the interests of the farming community and as such are more likely to reject or question soil best management practice. In addition the apparent lack of advisers' competence and skills in certain knowledge intensive soil best management practices and their reliance on experiential knowledge further explains their reluctance to engage in soil best management practices derived from national research. Integration of knowledge through dialogue and understanding emerges as key to overcoming these tensions and providing the basis for facilitating sustainable soil management. Advisers are shown to have a central role in integrating knowledge from research and from farmers. The processes and relationships that enable this integration are identified. The thesis concludes with some policy relevant suggestions to improve the effectiveness of advisers' participation in the transition to sustainable soil management in England. These include: exploiting a diverse and flexible advisory community; improving advisers' skills and expertise; instilling in them confidence to provide credible and practical soil best management practice; and improving the quality of communication between the advisers, researchers and farmers. Future research directions are reviewed in the context of the proposed implementation of Soil Management Plans on all farms in England as a component of cross compliance within CAP reforms...|$|R
50|$|Consciously organic {{agriculture}} (as opposed to traditional agricultural methods {{from before the}} inorganic options existed, which always employed only organic means) began more or less simultaneously in Central Europe and India. The British botanist Sir Albert Howard {{is often referred to}} as the father of modern {{organic agriculture}}, because he was the first to apply modern scientific knowledge and methods to traditional agriculture. From 1905 to 1924, he and his wife Gabrielle, herself a plant physiologist, worked as <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisers</b> in Pusa, Bengal, where they documented traditional Indian farming practices and came to regard them as superior to their conventional agriculture science. Their research and further development of these methods is recorded in his writings, notably, his 1940 book, An Agricultural Testament, which influenced many scientists and farmers of the day.|$|R
40|$|It {{is often}} assumed that hedgerows and field margins are most valued for {{providing}} wildlife habitats for threatened species and refuges for beneficial organisms. Interviews {{with a range}} of people showed that farmers and members of the public were as much concerned with the aesthetic appeal of a hedged landscape as the ecological value of hedgerows per se. While <b>agricultural</b> <b>advisers</b> stressed the ecological aspects when talking from a professional capacity, they were equally taken by the landscape qualities when talking from a personal viewpoint. Farmers were most concerned with the practical management of the hedgerows on their own farm, but when thinking of hedgerows beyond their farm they were also more appreciative of the landscape aspects. In all cases the trust each group had in the statements and actions of the other groups was important.

40|$|Seasonality can be {{extremely}} damaging to the lives and livelihoods of rural people, but this is rarely recognised and factored into the design and implementation of agricultural projects.

Seasonal employment programmes can smooth income and consumption but could overburden women, since seasonal workloads are highly gendered.
