5|$|After {{the recent}} events, Queen Margaret still {{considered}} Warwick {{a threat to}} the throne, and cut off his supplies. In August 1457, however, a French attack on the English seaport of Sandwich set off fears of a full-scale French invasion. Warwick was again funded to protect the garrison and patrol the English coast. In disregard of royal authority, he then conducted highly successful <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>piracy,</b> against the Castilian fleet in May 1458, and against the Hanseatic fleet a few weeks later. He also used his time on the Continent to establish relations with Charles VII of France and Philip the Good of Burgundy. Developing a solid military reputation and with good international connections, he then brought a part of his garrison to England, where he met up with his father and York in the summer of 1459.|$|E
5|$|In August 1718, Bonnet {{anchored}} the Royal James on an estuary of the Cape Fear River {{to careen}} and repair the ship. In late August and September, Colonel William Rhett, with the authorization of South Carolina governor Robert Johnson, led a naval expedition against pirates on the river. Rhett and Bonnet's men fought {{each other for}} hours, but the outnumbered pirates ultimately surrendered. Rhett arrested the pirates and brought them to Charles Town in early October. Bonnet escaped on 24October, but was recaptured on Sullivan's Island. On 10November, Bonnet was brought to trial and charged with two <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>piracy.</b> Judge Nicholas Trott sentenced Bonnet to death. Bonnet wrote to Governor Johnson to ask for clemency, but Johnson endorsed the judge's decision, and Bonnet was hanged in Charles Town on 10December 1718.|$|E
5|$|In {{return for}} his {{assistance}} in the war, Rome accepted Nabis' possession of the polis of Argos. While Nabis was already King of Sparta, he made his wife Apia ruler of her hometown Argos. Afterwards, Apia and Nabis staged a financial coup by confiscating large amounts of property from the wealthy families of these cities, and torturing those who resisted them; much of the confiscated land was redistributed to liberated helots loyal to Nabis. After increasing his territory and wealth by the aforementioned method, Nabis started to turn the port of Gythium into a major naval arsenal and fortified the city of Sparta. His Cretan allies were already allowed to have naval bases on Spartan territory, and from these they ventured on <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>piracy.</b> His naval buildup offered a chance even for the very poor to participate, as rowers, in the profitable employment. However, {{the extension of the}} naval capacities at Gythium greatly displeased the abutting states of the Aegean Sea and the Roman Republic.|$|E
5000|$|Under {{international}} law, the Israeli raid {{was considered}} state action and not piracy. Commander James Kraska said, [...] "Whether what Israel did {{is right or}} wrong, {{it is not an}} <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>piracy.</b> Piracy deals with private conduct particularly with a pecuniary or financial interest." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Paris-based organisers {{described}} the Israeli naval interception as [...] "an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> violence and an illegal act," [...] and as [...] "a new <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>piracy</b> against harmless people".|$|R
50|$|UNCLOS does {{recognise}} {{universal jurisdiction}} over the crime <b>of</b> <b>piracy</b> but it only applies to criminal acts that take place on international waters.

5|$|On 10 November 1718, Bonnet {{was brought}} to trial before Sir Nicholas Trott, sitting in his {{capacity}} as Vice-Admiralty judge. Trott had already sat in judgment on Bonnet's crew and sentenced most of them to hang. Bonnet was formally charged with only two <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>piracy,</b> against the Francis and the Fortune, whose commanders were on hand to testify against Bonnet in person. Ignatius Pell had turned King's evidence in the trial of Bonnet's crew and now testified, somewhat reluctantly, against Bonnet himself. Bonnet pleaded not guilty and conducted his own defence without assistance of counsel, cross-examining the witnesses to little avail, and calling a character witness in his favour. Trott rendered a damning summation of the evidence, and the jury delivered a guilty verdict. Two days later, after treating the convicted man to a stern lecture on his violation of Christian duties, Trott sentenced Bonnet to death.|$|E

25|$|In {{his book}} Blood-Red Arab Flag, Charles E. Davies alleges {{that the issue}} of piracy in the Persian Gulf {{appeared}} to have escalated in 1797.

50|$|In June 2009 {{while taking}} part in anti-piracy {{operations}} off the Horn of Africa, Portland intercepted ten pirates. However, as they were not caught in the immediate <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>piracy</b> the vessel was unable legally to detain them.|$|R

25|$|The ship's {{hijacking}} {{and subsequent}} events remain mysterious as no credible explanation exists of its disappearance and Russia's conduct {{during and after}} capturing the ship.

25|$|Combined Task Force 150, a {{multinational}} coalition task force, subsequently {{took on the}} role of fighting piracy off the coast of Somalia by establishing a Maritime Security Patrol Area (MSPA) within the Gulf of Aden. However, many foreign naval vessels chasing pirates were forced to break off when the pirates entered Somali territorial waters. To address this, in June 2008, following a letter from the Somalian Transitional Federal Government (TFG) to the President of the UN Security Council requesting assistance for the TFG's efforts to tackle <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>piracy</b> off the coast of Somalia, the UN Security Council unanimously passed a declaration authorizing nations that have the consent of the Transitional Federal Government to enter Somali territorial waters to deal with pirates. On the advice of lawyers, the Royal Navy and other international naval forces have often released suspected pirates that they have captured because, although the men are frequently armed, they have not been caught engaging in <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>piracy</b> and have thus not technically committed a crime.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-17th century, {{all three}} kingdoms were {{involved}} in a series of connected wars (including the English Civil War) which led to the temporary overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the short-lived unitary republic of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland.

25|$|To {{maintain}} his dwindling wealth, Hatton began investing {{in some of}} the voyages of Francis Drake. He helped fund Drake's <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>piracy</b> in Spanish America. During Drake's subsequent circumnavigation of the globe, when he reached the straits of Magellan, he renamed his ship The Golden Hind in honour of Hatton's coat of arms, which contained a golden hind, and of and all the Spanish gold on board. Hatton made a profit of £2300 from this particular expedition.|$|E

50|$|While the Southern sympathisers {{believed}} they were engaging in an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> war because they had an official letter of marque from the Confederacy, as {{the investigation into the}} affair unfolded, it was discovered there was no legality to their letter.

25|$|Paul Boyer and Stephen Nissenbaum have {{postulated}} {{that without a}} valid charter, the colony had no legitimate form of government to try capital cases until Phips arrived with the new charter. This has been disputed by David Konig. He points out that between charters, according to the Records of the Court of Assistants, the colony tried and condemned a group of fourteen pirates on January 27, 1690, for <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>piracy</b> and murder committed in August and October 1689.|$|E
25|$|In 1479, {{the vice}} {{president}} of the Ministry of War burned the court records documenting Zheng He's voyages; it was one of many events signalling China's shift to an inward foreign policy. Shipbuilding laws were implemented that restricted vessels to a small size; the concurrent decline of the Ming navy allowed the growth of piracy along China's coasts. Japanese pirates—or wokou—began staging raids on Chinese ships and coastal communities, although much of the <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>piracy</b> were carried out by native Chinese.|$|E
25|$|Kuwait signed {{protective}} {{treaties with}} Britain in 1899 and 1914 and Qatar signed a treaty in 1916. These treaties, {{in addition to}} the earlier treaties signed by the Trucial States and Bahrain, were aimed suppressing piracy and slave trade in the region. <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>piracy</b> in the Persian Gulf desisted during this period. By the 20th century, piracy had become a marginal activity, mainly due to the increasingly widespread use of steamships which were too expensive for freebooters to finance.|$|E
25|$|It was {{discovered}} that Yung Haos engine had been disabled, so she was towed from Hong Kong to Singapore, with a Royal Navy crew for the voyage, by , escorted by , arriving on 24 April 1951.

5000|$|Jennings first {{recorded}} <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>piracy</b> {{took place in}} early 1716 when, with three vessels and 150-300 men, Jennings' fleet ambushed the Spanish salvage camp from the 1715 Treasure Fleet. After the Florida raid, Jennings and his crew also linked up with Ben Hornigold's [...] "three sets of pirates" [...] from New Providence Island.

The German Defense Ministry estimated that the Sea Lynx fleet will return to full strength in early 2015. In the long term, the German Navy is to retire the Super Lynx in favour of the larger and newer NHIndustries NH90.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} trial location {{had been}} Kenya, following a May 2009 {{arrangement with the}} European Union granting Kenyan jurisdiction over <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>piracy</b> committed in the Indian Ocean. However, in 2010 Kenya's High Court had ruled that the Kenyan government should put on trial only those subjects captured inside its territorial waters. This was overturned by the Kenyan Court of Appeal in October 2012, by which time the Spanish trial for Patiños pirates had already commenced. During their trial in Spain, all six men pleaded not guilty, claiming they were fishermen who had approached Patiño for assistance at sea.|$|E
25|$|In August 1783, as {{punishment}} for the <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>piracy</b> undertaken by the city, a Spanish fleet with Maltese participation under Antonio Barceló bombarded Algiers for 8 days. The success of the attack, achieved {{at the cost of}} less than 50 casualties, caused joy in Spain and encouraged the Regency of Tripoli to make peace with Spain. Despite the heavy damage suffered, the Algerians did not surrender. Five Algerian privateers captured two Spanish merchant vessels near Palamós in September 1783 as a gesture of defiance. The city's defenses were reinforced with a new 50-gun fortress, 4,000 Turkish volunteer soldiers were recruited in Anatolia, and European advisors were hired to assist in the building fortifications and batteries. In addition, at least 70 vessels were prepared to repel the Spanish, and a reward of one thousand gold pieces was offered by the Dey to anyone who captured a ship of the attacking fleet.|$|E
5000|$|In addition, {{the statute}} adds {{additional}} instances, not {{listed in the}} Offences at Sea <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> 1536, which expanded the legal definition <b>of</b> <b>piracy</b> as a capital crime. The first of these includes any subject of the crown who commits any <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>piracy</b> “under colour <b>of</b> any commission from any foreign prince or state.” Additionally, any commander who “piratically and feloniously run away with his or their ships", anyone who may “consult, combine, or confederate” with any pirates, or “shall lay violent hands upon his commander whereby to hinder him from fighting” pirates who may be attempting to capture their vessel.|$|R
5000|$|Pedro Gilbert or Don Pedro Gibert (c. 1800 - June 11, 1835) was {{an early}} 19th-century pirate, {{who was one of}} the few {{remaining}} pirates continuing to raid shipping on the Atlantic coast.

25|$|While the British {{claim that}} <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>piracy</b> {{disrupted}} maritime {{trade in the}} Persian Gulf, Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi, author of The Myth of Piracy in the Gulf, dismisses this as an excuse used by the British to further their agendas in the Persian Gulf. Indian historian Sugata Bose maintains that while he believes the British colonial accounts of piracy were self-serving, he disagrees with Al Qasimi's thesis that piracy was not widespread in the Persian Gulf region. Davies argues that the motives of the Al Qasimi tribe in particular may have been misunderstood and that it cannot be definitively stated that they were pirates due to issues of semantics. J.B. Kelly comments in his treatise on Britain and the Persian Gulf that the Qasimi are undeserving of their reputation as pirates, {{and goes on to}} state that it was largely earned as a result of successive naval incidents with the rulers of Muscat.|$|E
25|$|During {{the last}} years of the Wanli Emperor's reign and those of his two successors, an {{economic}} crisis developed that was centered around a sudden widespread lack of the empire's chief medium of exchange: silver. The Protestant powers of the Dutch Republic and the Kingdom of England staged frequent raids and <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>piracy</b> against the Catholic-based empires of Spain and Portugal in order to weaken their global economic power. Meanwhile, Philip IV of Spain (r. 1621–1665) began cracking down on illegal smuggling of silver from Mexico and Peru across the Pacific towards China, in favor of shipping American-mined silver directly from Spain to Manila. In 1639, the new Tokugawa regime of Japan shut down most of its foreign trade with European powers, causing a halt of yet another source of silver coming into China. However, the greatest stunt to the flow of silver came from the Americas, while Japanese silver still came into China in limited amounts. Some scholars even assert that the price of silver rose in the 17th century due to a falling demand for goods, not declining silver stocks.|$|E
25|$|Piracy {{is an act}} of robbery or {{criminal}} violence by ship or boat-borne attackers upon another ship or a coastal area, typically with the goal of stealing cargo and other valuable items or properties. Those who engage in <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>piracy</b> are called pirates. The earliest documented instances of piracy were in the 14th century BC, when the Sea Peoples, a group of ocean raiders, attacked the ships of the Aegean and Mediterranean civilizations. Narrow channels which funnel shipping into predictable routes have long created opportunities for piracy, as well as for privateering and commerce raiding. Historic examples include the waters of Gibraltar, the Strait of Malacca, Madagascar, the Gulf of Aden, and the English Channel, whose geographic strictures facilitated pirate attacks. A land-based parallel is the ambushing of travelers by bandits and brigands in highways and mountain passes. Privateering uses similar methods to piracy, but the captain acts under orders of the state authorizing the capture of merchant ships belonging to an enemy nation, making it a legitimate form of war-like activity by non-state actors.|$|E
25|$|In March 1820, the Heroína, {{a privately}} owned frigate that was {{operated}} as a privateer under a license {{issued by the}} United Provinces of the River Plate, {{under the command of}} American Colonel David Jewett, set sail looking to capture Spanish ships as prizes. He captured Carlota, a Portuguese ship, which was considered an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>piracy.</b> A storm resulted in severe damage to Heroína and sank the prize Carlota, forcing Jewett to put into Puerto Soledad for repairs in October 1820.|$|R
2500|$|In modern times, {{ships and}} {{airplanes}} are hijacked {{for political reasons}} as well. The perpetrators <b>of</b> these <b>acts</b> {{could be described as}} pirates (for instance, the French term for plane hijacker is pirate de l'air, literally air pirate), but in English are usually termed hijackers. An example is the hijacking of the Italian civilian passenger ship Achille Lauro by the Palestinian Liberation Organization in 1985, which is regarded as an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>piracy.</b> A 2009 book entitled International Legal Dimension of Terrorism called the attackers [...] "terrorists".|$|R
2500|$|The pirates of {{the early}} eighteenth century, however, were men who acted on their own apart from {{official}} political sanction. [...] Pirates were very specific, unauthorized entities who worked outside the more socially accepted scenarios and did not discriminate when conducting their raids. The <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>piracy</b> was [...] "massively" [...] criminal. [...] Laws against piracy were often very strict, with charges and punishments escalating in attempts to curb piratical actions. But many braved the consequences of being caught if it meant a life lived more freely.|$|R
