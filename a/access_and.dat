30|$|When {{examining}} all {{the parameters}} tested in conjunction, {{it is possible}} to conclude that the results obtained with all the policies proposed outperformed the ones achieved by both MST and MinMax. When compared to MinMax, if we observe the results obtained considering that k equals to 50, the tree built with the PDS policy required 4 % fewer disk <b>accesses</b> <b>and</b> 12.7 % fewer distance computations, the tree built with the RE policy required 12.2 % fewer disk <b>accesses</b> <b>and</b> 15.2 % fewer distance computations, the tree built with the MD policy required 2 % fewer disk <b>accesses</b> <b>and</b> 4.3 % fewer distance computations, and the tree built with the RE+ policy required 2.9 % fewer disk <b>accesses</b> <b>and</b> 3.2 % more distance computations. Compared to MST, if we observe the results obtained considering that k equals to 80, the tree built with the PDS strategy required 22.5 % fewer disk <b>accesses</b> <b>and</b> 14.9 % fewer distance computations, the tree built with the RE strategy required 29 % fewer disk <b>accesses</b> <b>and</b> 17.3 % fewer distance computations, the tree built with the MD strategy required 20.9 % fewer disk <b>accesses</b> <b>and</b> 6.7 % fewer distance computations, and the tree built with the RE+ policy required 21.8 % fewer disk <b>accesses</b> <b>and</b> 0.2 % more distance computations. Particularly with respect to the RE+ policy, {{it is important to note}} that the gain in efficiency in disk access surpassed the need for a greater number of distance computations. This fact can be observed in Figure 9 c that shows that the time required for the RE+ policy to execute the queries was inferior than the ones required for both MST and MinMax.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—H. 264 /AVC video {{compression}} standard uses multiple reference frame motion estimation (MRF-ME) {{to enhance the}} coding performance. The required frame memory <b>accesses</b> <b>and</b> the computational cost of the MRF-ME, however, are very high. This paper proposes an approach which exploits the characteristic of a constant luminance macroblock (L-MB) to avoid unnecessary frame memory <b>accesses</b> <b>and</b> MRF-ME computation. Simulation {{results show that the}} proposed scheme can reduce about 43 % of the frame memory <b>accesses</b> <b>and</b> 33 % of the MRF-ME computation for low motion video sequences without any PSNR degradation and bit-rate increase.
