The section in question is the only one in that work that is written in first-person view. Bede says: [...] "Prayers are hindered by the conjugal duty because <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> perform what is due to my wife I am not able to pray." [...] Another passage, in the Commentary on Luke, also mentions a wife in the first person: [...] "Formerly I possessed a wife in the lustful passion of desire and now I possess her in honourable sanctification and true love of Christ."

You've got a white man's house to live in now and I am anxious to learn all that I can, so that I can come home by and by and live with you.

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{variation}} of the received line-of-sight (LoS) power due to ground multipath propagation for the L-band air to ground radio channel. Within, both theoretical as well as results taken from flight trial measurements are presented. In theory, ground multipath propagation leads to periodic amplification and attenuation of the received LoS power. Measurement data presented within the paper confirms that in general, the variation can be well modeled by introducing an additional ground multipath component. Nevertheless, in reality strong signal variations do not appear <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> expected, <b>i.</b> e. the reflection off the ground is strongly attenuated. Two main reasons can be identified attenuation. First, ground multipath propagation can be blocked by nearby buildings, terrain features or vegetation. Second, a rough ground surfaces causes the incident radio waves to be reflected in all directions. This effect is called scattering and results in {{only a small portion}} of the power being received at the aircraft...|$|R

I elaborated the Church directives determining the participation of children in liturgy so that they could be used in practice <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> possible. <b>I</b> paid special attention to the problematics of preparation of children for the liturgy.

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a {{systematic}} exploration of reputation mechanism design in trading environments with opportunistic sellers of commonly known cost and ability parameters, imperfect monitoring of a seller’s actions, and two possible seller effort levels, {{one of which}} has no value to buyers. The objective of reputation mechanisms in such pure moral hazard settings is to induce sellers to exert high effort <b>as</b> <b>often</b> <b>as</b> possible. <b>I</b> study the impact of various mechanism parameters (such as the granularity of solicited feedback, {{the format of the}} public reputation profile, the policy regarding missing feedback, and the rules for admitting new sellers) on the resulting market efficiency. I find that maximum efficiency is bounded away from the hypothetical firstbest case where sellers can credibly precommit to full cooperation by a factor that is related to the probability that cooperating sellers may receive “unfair ” bad ratings. Furthermore, maximum efficiency is independent of the length of past history summarized in a seller’s public reputation profile. I apply my framework to a simplified model of eBay’s feedback mechanism and conclude that, in pure moral hazard settings, eBay’s simple mechanism is capable of inducing the maximum theoretical efficiency independently of the number of recent ratings that are being summarized in a seller’s profile. I derive optimal policies for dealing with missing feedback and easy online identity changes. Finally, I show that if the number of buyers is large, the results obtained in the monopoly case are also approximately valid in settings where multiple sellers of different reputations simultaneously offer auctions for identical goods.
