In terms of population, Windsor Castle is the largest inhabited castle {{in the world and}} the longest-occupied palace in Europe, but it also remains a functioning royal home. As of 2006, around 500 people were living and working in the castle. The Queen has increasingly used the castle as a royal palace as well as her weekend home and it is now as often used for state banquets and official entertaining as Buckingham Palace. In recent years, Windsor Castle has hosted visits from President Mbeki of South Africa, King Abdullah II of Jordan <b>and</b> <b>President</b> <b>Obama</b> of the United States. The castle remains an important ceremonial location. The Waterloo ceremony is carried out in the presence of the Queen each year, and the annual ceremony of the Order of the Garter takes place in St George's Chapel.

25|$|Presidents may {{use their}} {{predecessors}} as emissaries to deliver private messages to other nations or as official {{representatives of the}} United States to state funerals and other important foreign events. Richard Nixon made multiple foreign trips to countries including China and Russia and was lauded as an elder statesman. Jimmy Carter has become a global human rights campaigner, international arbiter, and election monitor, {{as well as a}} recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. Bill Clinton has also worked as an informal ambassador, most recently in the negotiations that led to the release of two American journalists, Laura Ling and Euna Lee, from North Korea.

25|$|Both House Republicans <b>and</b> <b>President</b> <b>Obama</b> {{proposed}} {{increasing the}} additional premiums {{paid by the}} wealthiest people with Medicare, compounding several reforms in the ACA that would {{increase the number of}} wealthier individuals paying higher, income-related Part B and Part D premiums. Such proposals are projected to save $20 billion {{over the course of a}} decade, and would ultimately result in more than a quarter of Medicare enrollees paying between 35 and 90 percent of their Part B costs by 2035, rather than the typical 25 percent. If the brackets mandated for 2035 were implemented today, it would mean that anyone earning more than $47,000 (as an individual) or $94,000 (as a couple) would be affected. Under the Republican proposals, affected individuals would pay 40 percent of the total Part B and Part D premiums, which would be equivalent of $2,500 today.|$|E
25|$|There are {{divergent}} {{views on}} the peace process held by US officials, citizens and lobbying groups. All recent US Presidents have maintained a policy that Israel must give {{up some of the}} land that it conquered in the 1967 war in order to achieve peace; that the Palestinians must actively prevent terrorism; and that Israel has an unconditional right to exist. Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush publicly supported {{the creation of a new}} Palestinian state out of most of the current Palestinian territories, based on the idea of self-determination for the Palestinian people, <b>and</b> <b>President</b> <b>Obama</b> has continued that policy. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton thought that peace can only be achieved through direct, bilateral negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. Obama outlined the pursuit of the two-state solution as American policy for achieving Palestinian aspirations, Israeli security, and a measure of stability in the Middle East.|$|E

500|$|The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) {{completed}} a disaster survey of houses on August19, {{a first step}} toward a federal disaster declaration.

[...] On August25, Governor Abercrombie formally requested for federal assistance, after the state depleted its disaster fund, but that was rejected by FEMA due to insufficient damage. However, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack declared an agriculture disaster, prompting the Small Business Administration to allow federal disaster loans to small businesses. The FEMA decision was reversed on September12, when the federal government approved aid for rebuilding public buildings, as well as future disaster mitigation.|$|E
