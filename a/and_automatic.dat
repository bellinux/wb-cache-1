5|$|A Storm Mark III {{was set to}} be {{produced}} for the Israeli defense forces starting in June 2008, when the IDF was to purchase around 600 vehicles beginning in early 2011. Based on the then new four-door Jeep Wrangler JK design, the Mark III is meant {{to address some of}} the shortfalls of the earlier Mark II. Whereas the previous vehicle was an update of the original TK Storm, the Storm III was designed from the outset with a five-door configuration. Unlike the TJ-L, the new JK Storm has a much higher maximum load capacity in part due to heavier-duty shock absorbers, springs and axles, necessary for an armored version. It includes a standard 2.8L VM Motori turbodiesel <b>and</b> <b>automatic</b> transmission.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, when {{alternative}} rock began to experience broad mainstream success, R.E.M. was viewed by subsequent acts such as Nirvana and Pavement as {{a pioneer of}} the genre. The band then released its two most commercially successful albums, Out of Time (1991) <b>and</b> <b>Automatic</b> for the People (1992), which veered from the band's established sound and catapulted it to international fame. R.E.M.'s 1994 release, Monster, was {{a return to a}} more rock-oriented sound, but still continued its run of success. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three of the band members.|$|E

5|$|Danny Bergara was {{appointed}} as manager in March 1989, quickly transforming the team, <b>and</b> <b>automatic</b> promotion was gained in 1990–91. The next three seasons saw Stockport make the play-offs, {{but failed to}} result in another promotion. In March 1995 Bergara was sacked after an altercation with then-chairman Brendan Elwood, and Dave Jones {{was appointed}} manager in April of that year. A new all-seater, Cheadle End, holding just over 5,000 in capacity, was opened {{at the start of}} the 1995–96 season. Although this particular season was unremarkable, the club reached the third round of the FA Cup, where they faced holders Everton. Stockport reached a 2–2 draw with Everton at Goodison Park, and for the replay ten days later over 11,000 gathered at Edgeley Park to witness Everton's late winner in a 3–2 victory.|$|E
5|$|Perl's text-handling {{capabilities}} can be {{used for}} generating SQL queries; arrays, hashes, <b>and</b> <b>automatic</b> memory management make it easy to collect and process the returned data. For example, in Tim Bunce's Perl DBI application programming interface (API), the arguments to the API can be the text of SQL queries; thus it is possible to program in multiple languages at the same time (e.g., for generating a Web page using HTML, JavaScript, and SQL in a here document). The use of Perl variable interpolation to programmatically customize each of the SQL queries, and the specification of Perl arrays or hashes as the structures to programmatically hold the resulting data sets from each SQL query, allows a high-level mechanism for handling large amounts of data for post-processing by a Perl subprogram.|$|E
5|$|Steam is {{a digital}} {{distribution}} platform developed by Valve Corporation, which offers {{digital rights management}} (DRM), multiplayer gaming, video streaming and social networking services. Steam provides the user with installation <b>and</b> <b>automatic</b> updating of games, and community features such as friends lists and groups, cloud saving, and in-game voice and chat functionality. The software provides a freely available application programming interface (API) called Steamworks, which developers can use to integrate many of Steam's functions into their products, including networking, matchmaking, in-game achievements, micro-transactions, and support for user-created content through Steam Workshop. Though initially developed for use on Microsoft Windows operating systems, versions for OS X and Linux were later released. Mobile apps with connected functionality with the main software were later released for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone devices in the 2010s.|$|E
