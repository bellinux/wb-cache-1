5|$|Kalara McFadyen of the Memphis Lady Tigers {{achieved}} {{perhaps the}} most unusual triple-double in history, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> it without scoring a point or even attempting a shot. On February 3, 2002, in a women's Division I game against Charlotte, she had 12 assists, 10 steals, and 10 rebounds.|$|E
5|$|Benin had {{one woman}} {{competing}} in swimming at the 2008 Olympics. That athlete was Gloria Koussihouede who {{competed in the}} 50 meters freestyle. The 2008 Olympics was Koussihouedes second Olympics after competing in 2004, and she was selected to compete in heat one.

5|$|Both Lowell and Sexton {{encouraged}} Plath {{to write}} from her experience <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> so. She openly discussed her depression with Lowell and her suicide attempts with Sexton, who {{led her to}} write from a more female perspective. Plath began to conceive {{of herself as a}} more serious, focused poet and short-story writer. At this time Plath and Hughes first met the poet W. S. Merwin, who admired their work and was to remain a lifelong friend. Plath resumed psychoanalytic treatment in December, working with Ruth Beuscher.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is right}} enough. It {{is just a}} toss up. If we run, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> runs, she will {{overtake}} us; if we haul up close into the wind, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> the same, <b>she</b> will overtake us, again; but if we <b>do</b> one thing, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> the other, we are safe.|$|R
6000|$|That's different,' William replied. 'She {{was only}} a girl, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> hadn't <b>done</b> {{anything}} except walk like a quail, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>does.</b> But it isn't fair {{to make fun of}} a man.' ...|$|R

5|$|For 2011, Robson hired a new coach, Frenchman Patrick Mouratoglou, {{and moved}} her working base to Paris. Her season was {{disrupted}} by injury at the Hopman Cup <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not {{compete in a}} tournament until March 2011; her comeback was then delayed for a further month by an injury in her second competition. Returning again {{at the end of}} April 2011, Robson's best performance to date came at the $50,000 tournament at Indian Harbor Beach, Florida, where she reached the semifinal. Robson split from Mouratoglou just before Wimbledon. Robson then won her first match at a Grand Slam as she defeated Angelique Kerber, but lost to Maria Sharapova in the second round.|$|E
5|$|HMS Ledbury was {{an escort}} {{destroyer}} of the Hunt class Type II. The Royal Navy ordered Ledburys construction {{two days after}} the outbreak of the Second World War and J. I. Thornycroft Ltd laid down her keel at their Southampton yard on 24 January 1940. Air raid damage to the yard delayed her construction <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not launch until 27 September 1941. Her initial assignment was to perform escort duties between Scapa Flow and Iceland. She remained in this theatre for {{the first part of the}} war, during which time she served with the ill-fated Arctic convoy PQ 17 in June 1942, from which twenty-four ships were lost.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>done</b> it, too; <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>done</b> it {{beautiful}}. <b>She</b> <b>done</b> it {{so beautiful}} {{it was good}} to hear; and I wished I could tell her a thousand lies, so <b>she</b> could <b>do</b> it again.|$|R
60|$|But <b>she</b> <b>does</b> {{not call}} herself Signora Ballatino, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not play upon the zithern. Her name has a homelier sound, and her {{speciality}} is the delineation of coster character.|$|R

5|$|Ships of the Royal Australian Navy also {{assisted}} the Royal Navy in the blockade of the German High Seas Fleet. In February 1915, HMAS Australia joined the British Grand Fleet, and was made flagship of the 2nd Battle Cruiser Squadron. Australia {{was not involved}} in the Battle of Jutland; in April, the battlecruiser was damaged in a collision with sister ship , <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not return to service until June. Three RAN ships were present during the surrender of the German High Seas Fleet; Australia, Sydney, and Melbourne, with Australia leading the port division of the Grand Fleet as it sailed out to meet the Germans.|$|E
5|$|After the war ended, Sam took up {{an offer}} from Dee to become Professor of Natural Philosophy at Glasgow University. In Glasgow, the Currans, {{together}} with a few friends, set up the Scottish Society for the Parents of Mentally Handicapped Children (Enable), which eventually grew to 100 branches and more than 5000 members. Later, when Joan {{was a member of}} the Greater Glasgow Health Board and the Scottish Special Housing Association, the needs of the disabled were always at the forefront of her mind, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> much to promote their welfare. She took a close interest in the work of the Council for Access for the Disabled and helped improve the range of facilities, especially for disabled university students.|$|E
5|$|Dresden was {{commissioned}} into service with the High Seas Fleet eight {{months before the}} end of World War I; as a result, her service career was limited <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not see action. She participated in a fleet operation to Norway to attack British convoys to Scandinavia, but they failed to locate any convoys and returned to port. Dresden was to have participated in a climactic sortie {{in the final days of}} the war, but a revolt in the fleet forced Admirals Reinhard Scheer and Franz von Hipper to cancel the operation. The ship was interned in Scapa Flow after the end of the war and scuttled with the fleet there on 21 June 1919, under orders from the fleet commander Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter.|$|E

5|$|In 1931, Fatima Jinnah {{joined her}} brother in England. From then on, Muhammad Jinnah would receive {{personal}} care {{and support from}} her as he aged and began to suffer from the lung ailments which would kill him. She lived and travelled with him, and became a close advisor. Muhammad Jinnah's daughter, Dina, was educated in England and India. Jinnah later became estranged from Dina after she decided to marry a Christian, Neville Wadia from a prominent Parsi business family. When Jinnah urged Dina to marry a Muslim, she reminded {{him that he had}} married a woman not raised in his faith. Jinnah continued to correspond cordially with his daughter, but their personal relationship was strained, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not come to Pakistan in his lifetime, but only for his funeral.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{featured}} preliminary matches on the SmackDown brand was between The Undertaker and Edge for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship. At Backlash, the Undertaker defeated Edge {{to retain the}} title by forcing him {{to submit to the}} gogoplata, a chokehold move that causes opponents to spit blood (scripted) from their mouths. On the May 2 episode of SmackDown, authority figure Vickie Guerrero stripped the title from the Undertaker, after claiming the gogoplata was an illegal submission hold <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> it to protect the other wrestlers. The following week, Guerrero booked Undertaker in a match for the vacant title at Judgment Day against Edge, who last eliminated Batista in a battle royal, an elimination style match where the last person in the ring is the winner, to become the number one contender.|$|E
5|$|Captain S. H. Carlill assumed command on 24 June and the Illustrious resumed deck-landing training. On 8 and 9 November the Supermarine 510 {{research}} aircraft {{made the}} first ever landings by a swept-wing aircraft aboard a carrier. This aircraft {{was one of the}} ancestors of the Supermarine Swift fighter. A month later the ship began a four-month refit and hosted the first carrier landing of the de Havilland Sea Venom on 9 July 1951. Later in the month she hosted the Sea Furies of 802 and the Fireflies of 814 Squadrons for Exercise Winged Fleet. Captain C. T. Jellicoe relieved Carlill on 27 August and the ship ferried 10 Fireflies of 814 Squadron to Malta beginning on 1 October. She exchanged them for Firebrands for the return voyage. On 3 November she began loading the 39th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom) of the 3rd Infantry Division in response to the riots in Cyprus that broke out when Egypt abrogated the Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936. She set sail two days later and arrived at Famagusta on 11 November. She returned to Portsmouth on 19 November and began loading the 45th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery, the 1st Battalion, Coldstream Guards, and the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment two days later. Illustrious set sail on 23 November and reached Famagusta on 29 November. She returned to Portsmouth on 7 December <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not leave harbour until 30 January 1952 when she resumed her customary role as a training ship.|$|E

25|$|Since {{consent was}} impossible, given her {{powerless}} position, David in essence raped her.

25|$|Linda McCartney (then Linda Eastman) {{was one of}} Roxon's closest female friends <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> much {{to further}} Eastman's career, but the {{friendship}} ended abruptly in 1969 when Eastman moved to London, married Paul McCartney and cut all ties with all her former friends, a move which wounded Roxon deeply.|$|E
25|$|She briefly dated Gregory Lekhtman, the {{inventor}} of Exerlopers, during her term as prime minister, but the relationship was relatively private <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not involve him in the 1993 election campaign.
