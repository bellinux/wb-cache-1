30|$|The {{increment}} of {{the random}} traffic {{is larger than}} that of the uniform traffic. The reasons are as follows. Under uniform traffic, the transmission durations of links in <b>a</b> <b>pairing</b> are diverse in MPMH [1]. The diversities bring about the waste of time slots in <b>a</b> <b>pairing.</b> The differences among the transmission durations of links in <b>a</b> <b>pairing</b> under random traffic are worse, which result in further degradations in the throughput performance. However, the transmission durations of links in <b>a</b> <b>pairing</b> are the same under both traffic patterns in MPMH-SRSC. Thus, it outperforms the MPMH under uniform traffic and has greater performance increment under random traffic.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{rational}} solution for a mixed nonlinear Schr¨odinger (MNLS) equation. This solution has two free parameters a and b representing {{the contributions of}} self-steepening and self phasemodulation (SPM) of an associated physical system. It describes five soliton states: <b>a</b> <b>paired</b> bright-bright soliton, single soliton, <b>a</b> <b>paired</b> bright-grey soliton, <b>a</b> <b>paired</b> bright-black soliton, and a rogue wave state. We show that the transition among these five states is induced by self-steepening and SPM through tuning the values of a and b. This is a unique and potentially fundamentally important phenomenon in a physical system described by the MNLS equation...|$|R

5|$|During the Evacuation of Greece, Formidable {{provided}} {{air cover}} for Convoy GA-15 on 29 April. A Fulmar from 803 Squadron {{was forced to}} ditch on 2 May before the carrier returned to Alexandria the next day.

On the morning of 8 May, <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of Fulmars claimed to have shot down <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of Z.1007s searching for the fleet; one Fulmar failed to return. Later that afternoon, the fighters shot down four German Heinkel He 111 bombers {{at the cost of}} one Fulmar forced to crash-land.

5|$|LSU {{received}} {{the ball to}} start the second half and started their fifth offensive drive from their own 18. After they gained a first down on a short pass on <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of runs, the Alabama defense stopped the Tigers on their next series to force a punt. Alabama then started from their own 48, but were only able to muster a three and out. This resulted in their first punt of the night from Cody Mandell. With Lee back at quarterback for LSU, he threw his second interception, this time to Mark Barron, to give Alabama possession at the LSU 35. Again the LSU defense held the Alabama offense in check to set up another long field goal attempt. This time Foster connected on a 46-yard field goal to give the Crimson Tide a 6–3 lead. On the next drive, LSU was able to gain <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of first downs primarily with only runs by Jefferson and Ford, but again were forced to punt. Alabama started this drive from their own 11, {{and was able to}} gain <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of first downs on McCarron passes before he threw an interception to Morris Claiborne that was returned to the Alabama 15.
