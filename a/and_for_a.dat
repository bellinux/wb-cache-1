She subsequently testified against Bamber during his trial in October 1986. The judge told the jury that they could convict Bamber on Mugford's testimony alone. Immediately after the verdict was announced, Mugford sold her story to the News of the World for ₤25,000 (£ in 2016).|$|E

5|$|After Crawford graduated, Professor A. J. Herbertson {{offered him}} {{a job as a}} junior {{demonstrator}} in the university's geography department. Crawford agreed, and served in the teaching position over the ensuing year. Through Herbertson, Crawford was introduced to the geographer Patrick Geddes. Crawford then decided to focus his attentions on archaeology rather than geography even though few professional positions in the field existed in Britain at the time. Looking elsewhere for archaeological employment, he unsuccessfully applied for a Craven Fellowship <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> post at Bombay Museum.|$|E

5|$|After John succeeded Richard in 1199, {{he decided}} to restore Geoffrey to the archiepiscopal estates, but {{continued}} to receive the income until the archbishop returned from Rome. Some of Geoffrey's opponents who were officials in his diocese resigned their offices, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> short time peace reigned in York. But the perceived arrogance of Geoffrey's officials offended the cathedral chapter at York, and this further conflict was not resolved until March 1200. For most of the remainder of 1199 Geoffrey was frequently with the king, and the two {{appear to have been}} on good terms, a state of affairs that continued throughout the first half of 1200.|$|E
5|$|After disbanding, {{all four}} members of Bauhaus {{undertook}} various solo projects before Ash, David J and Kevin Haskins reformed as Love and Rockets in 1985.

Another reunion tour followed {{towards the end of}} 2005, before work started on a new album Go Away White, released in March 2008. The album charted poorly, only reaching No. 120 on the UK Albums Chart, but gave the band their first entry for a studio album on the U.S. Billboard 200 when it reached No. 105. Following the release of the album, Bauhaus disbanded again.|$|E

5|$|As a senator, Walker {{continued}} {{to focus on}} finance, although his views on social policy sometimes saw him {{on the outside of}} his party. He supported the White Australia policy but disagreed with key elements, and was a leader in opposition to the dictation test, by which a potential immigrant was required to pass a test in any European language before their application was accepted. He also campaigned for a transcontinental railway <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> capital city to be located on federal territory. Attempts to guide financial reform through the parliament as a backbench senator led to frustration, and Walker retired due to ill health in 1913 with his legislation unpassed.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the role of {{switching}} costs in the relationship between satisfaction, trust, <b>and</b> commitment <b>for</b> <b>a</b> brand. Data analyzed in this study were collected via questionaires from real consumers (n= 457). Our research model emphasizes associations among switching costs, satisfaction, trust <b>and</b> commitment <b>for</b> <b>a</b> brand. Our study provides compelling evidence for future work to gain further insight into switching costs, satisfaction, trust, <b>and</b> commitment <b>for</b> <b>a</b> brand <b>and</b> includes several implications <b>for</b> management practice <b>and</b> future research. Switching costs have positively effect the relationships between satisfaction, trust <b>and</b> commitment <b>for</b> <b>a</b> brand. This empirical study provides a new approach to understand the effects of switching costs on the relationships between satisfaction, trust, <b>and</b> commitment <b>for</b> <b>a</b> brand...|$|R

5|$|Burnell {{was behind}} {{the efforts of the}} royal {{officials}} to enforce royal rights during his term of office as chancellor, including the implementation of the Quo warranto procedures. He also helped with the legislative and legal reforms of Edward's reign. During Burnell's tenure the chancellor's office and records became fixed in London rather than travelling with the king. Burnell went abroad on diplomatic missions for Edward, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> time governed Gascony. He continued to enjoy the king's trust until his death in 1292; one historian has suggested that Burnell may have been the most important royal official of the 13th century.|$|E
