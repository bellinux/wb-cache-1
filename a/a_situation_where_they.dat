2500|$|Collusion was practiced {{among various}} Champagne houses {{in order to}} drive down the prices of grapes to as a low as they would go, with the ever-present threat that if the houses could not get their grapes for cheap enough they would {{continue}} to source grapes from outside the region. Champenois vineyard owners found themselves in <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> were being paid less for fewer grapes. Poverty was widespread. In January 1911, frustrations reached their boiling point as riots erupted in the towns of Damery and Hautvilliers. Champenois vine growers intercepted trucks with grapes from the Loire Valley and pushed them into the Marne river. They then descended upon the warehouses of producers known to produce faux Champagne, tossing more wine and barrels into the Marne. The French Government tried to answer the vine growers' concerns by passing legislation defining where Champagne wine was to come from. This early legislation dictated that the Marne department and a few villages from the Aisne department were the only areas approved to grow grapes for Champagne production. The glaring exclusion of the Aube region, where the historic capital of Champagne—Troyes—is located, promoted further discontent as the Aubois protested the decision. The Aube, located south of the Marne, was closer to the Burgundy region in terms of soil and location. The growers of the Marne viewed the region as [...] "foreign" [...] and not capable of producing true Champagne but the Aubois viewed themselves as Champenois and clung to their historical roots. The government eventually reversed themselves and included the Aube-much {{to the dismay of}} vine growers in the Marne who vigorously protested the decision. More riots erupted and the region was on the brink of civil war. As the government fumbled for an answer that would appease both parties, World War I erupted and those issues had to be set aside as the entire country braced itself for war.|$|E
25|$|Crayfish {{often find}} {{themselves}} in <b>a</b> conflicting <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> are performing the highly motivated behavior of feeding when they suddenly receive a tail flip stimulus. Often, the crayfish will not perform a tail flip in this situation. This is because when a crayfish is actively feeding, the LGI itself is modulated by the behavior. Feeding increases the threshold for the tail flip, and even when the tail is tapped, no spikes are initiated. As a result, it takes an especially strong stimulus to elicit the tail flip. This prevents the crayfish from going hungry unless it is absolutely necessary.|$|R

Commodore Whipple had by this time ascertained by sounding, that a wrong idea had prevailed of the depth of water in the harbor, and that his ships could not anchor nearer than within three miles of the bar, so that it would be impossible for him to defend the passage of it. He quitted his station within it, therefore, after having destroyed a part of the enemy's buoys, and took a position where his ships might be abreast, and form a cross-fire with the batteries of Fort Moultrie, where Colonel Pinckney commanded.|$|E

Manual had, therefore, the satisfaction of seeing his little party quartered, as he thought, in military manner, before he retired with Griffith and his men into one of the vaulted apartments of the ruin, which, by its open and broken doors, invited their entrance. Here the marines disposed themselves to rest, while the two officers succeeded in passing the tedious hours, without losing their characters for watchfulness by conversing with each other, or, at whiles, suffering their thoughts to roam in the very different fields which fancy would exhibit to men of such differing characters. In this manner hour after hour passed, in listless quiet or sullen expectation, until the day had gradually advanced, and it became dangerous to keep the sentinels and picket in <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> were liable to be seen by any straggler who might be passing near the wood. Manual remonstrated against any alteration, as being entirely unmilitary, for he was apt to carry his notions of tactics to extremes whenever he came in collision with a sea officer: but in this instance his superior was firm, and the only concession the captain could obtain was the permission to place a solitary sentinel within a few feet of the vault, though under the cover of the crumbling walls of the building itself. With this slight deviation in their arrangements, the uneasy party remained for several hours longer, impatiently awaiting the period when they should be required to move.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In an {{empirical}} study, eye-gaze patterns of pairs {{of students were}} recorded and analyzed in <b>a</b> remote <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> had to build a concept map collaboratively. They were provided (or not), with a knowledge awareness tool that provided learner A with learner B's level of knowledge measured through a pre-test. Previous {{results showed that the}} awareness tool positively affected learning gain by enhancing the production of elaborative talk and knowledge negotiation. In the present paper, we describe the actual use of a knowledge awareness tool during the course of interaction by analyzing the gaze paths recorded during the experiment and how they relate to learning performance and verbal interactions. The results showed that learners refer to the knowledge awareness tool episodically during the course of collaboration, mainly to assess the epistemic value of the information provided by the peer, especially when the peer seems uncertain about his understanding. The potential of the synchronized eye-tracking method for research in computer supported collaborative learning is discussed...|$|R
