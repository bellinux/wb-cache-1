40|$|<b>Anomalous</b> <b>tropospheric</b> <b>propagation</b> {{caused by}} ducting {{phenomenon}} {{is a major}} problem in wireless communication. Thus, it is important to study the behavior of radio wave propagation in tropospheric ducts. The Parabolic Wave Equation (PWE) method is considered most reliable to model anomalous radio wave propagation. In this work, an improved Split Step Wavelet transform Method (SSWM) is presented to solve PWE for the modeling of tropospheric propagation over finite and infinite conductive surfaces. A large number of numerical experiments are carried out to validate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Developed algorithm is compared with previously published techniques; Wavelet Galerkin Method (WGM) and Split-Step Fourier transform Method (SSFM). A very good agreement is found between SSWM and published techniques. It is also observed that the proposed algorithm is about 18 times faster than WGM and provide more details of propagation effects as compared to SSFM...|$|E

50|$|Depending {{on signal}} {{propagation}} and multiple reflections (hops) and local interference the DCF77 signal {{can sometimes be}} received further away (see <b>tropospheric</b> <b>propagation).</b> This {{is associated with a}} significant decrease in the signal strength and depends on many factors, e.g., the daytime and season, the angle of incidence of the skywave on the D-layer and the solar activity.|$|R
50|$|Tropospheric {{propagated}} signals {{travel in}} the part of the atmosphere adjacent to the surface and extending to some 25,000 feet (7,620 m). Such signals are thus directly affected by weather conditions extending over some hundreds of miles. During very settled, warm anticyclonic weather (i.e., high pressure), usually weak signals from distant transmitters improve in strength. Another symptom during such conditions may be interference to the local transmitter resulting in co-channel interference, usually horizontal lines or an extra floating picture with analog broadcasts and break-up with digital broadcasts. A settled high-pressure system gives the characteristic conditions for enhanced <b>tropospheric</b> <b>propagation,</b> in particular favouring signals which travel along the prevailing isobar pattern (rather than across it). Such weather conditions can occur at any time, but generally the summer and autumn months are the best periods.

40|$|Since the {{development}} of microwave sensors using higher frequency bands is topical and {{on the agenda of}} several space agencies, there is an actual demand to further investigate <b>tropospheric</b> <b>propagation</b> effects and related issues in more detail. We address the problem of <b>tropospheric</b> <b>propagation</b> for satellite mounted radars and remote sensing by active microwave SAR sensors for frequencies of X-band, up to Ka-band. Strong effects can be observed due to attenuation from rain including backscattering; where fog, clouds and gaseous attenuation also, come into play for propagating signals in the respective higher bands. We estimate and quantify the probability of occurrence of diverse effects and show how attenuation due to rain might lead to useful information about the rain intensity. Such intensity measurements of precipitation are sought in regions where ground based weather radars are lacking and are in need for modelling of precipitation effects and probabilities of attenuation for communication applications. Not only point-to-point line-of-sight measurements are required but areal information of attenuation also, which can be considered as a potential application to be deduced from two-dimensional synthetic aperture radar images. Measurements from highly-successful recently-launched TanDEM-X/ Terra-SAR-X sensors will be used for analysis and illustration...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} reforecast {{experiments}} using the ensemble prediction {{system of the}} Meteorological Research Institute is conducted to reveal the predictability and downward influence of a reflection event of stratospheric planetary waves in February 2014, which recorded {{the highest level of}} the downward propagation of the wave activity.

It is found that the skill of forecasts with a prediction period around the predictability limit crucially depends on whether planetary waves are reflected or absorbed in the stratosphere. Composite analyses also reveal that the persistence of the tropospheric wave source in the eastern hemisphere is a key in determining the propagating property of stratospheric planetary waves.

40|$|International audienceA {{large body}} of work has shown that year-to-year {{variations}} in North African dust emission are inversely proportional to previous year monsoon rainfall in the Sahel, implying that African dust emission is highly sensitive to vegetation changes in this narrow transitional zone. However, such a theory is not supported by field observations or modeling studies, as both suggest that interannual variability in dust is due to changes in wind speeds over the major emitting regions, which lie {{to the north of}} the Sahelian vegetated zone. Here we reconcile this contradiction showing that interannual variability in Sahelian rainfall, and surface wind speeds over the Sahara, are the result of changes in lower tropospheric air temperatures over the Saharan Heat Low (SHL). As the SHL warms an <b>anomalous</b> <b>tropospheric</b> circulation develops that reduces windspeeds over the Sahara and displaces the monsoonal rainfall northward, thus simultaneously increasing Sahelian rainfall and reducing dust emission from the major dust “hot-spots” in the Sahara.
