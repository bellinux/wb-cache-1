5|$|Bupropion-induced {{psychosis}} {{may develop}} in select populations, or worsen a pre-existing psychotic syndrome. Symptoms may include delusions, hallucinations, paranoia, and confusion. In most cases these symptoms {{can be reduced}} or eliminated by reducing the dose, ceasing treatment or adding <b>antipsychotic</b> medication. However, adding a benzodiazepine to treat psychosis, instead of an <b>antipsychotic,</b> may become a valid alternative according to the model of amphetamine-induced psychosis. Psychotic symptoms are associated with factors such as higher doses of bupropion, a history of bipolar disorder or psychosis, concomitant medications, for example, lithium or benzodiazepines, old age, or substance abuse.|$|E
5|$|Midazolam, in {{combination}} with an <b>antipsychotic</b> drug, is indicated for the acute management of schizophrenia when it is associated with aggressive or out-of-control behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Atypical {{antipsychotics}} are modestly {{useful in}} reducing aggression and psychosis {{in people with}} Alzheimer's disease, but their advantages are offset by serious adverse effects, such as stroke, movement difficulties or cognitive decline. When used in the long-term, they {{have been shown to}} associate with increased mortality. Stopping <b>antipsychotic</b> use in this group of people appears to be safe.|$|E
50|$|<b>Antipsychotics</b> are broadly {{divided into}} two groups, the typical or first-generation <b>antipsychotics</b> and the {{atypical}} or second-generation <b>antipsychotics.</b> The typical <b>antipsychotics</b> are classified according to their chemical structure while the atypical <b>antipsychotics</b> are classified according to their pharmacological properties. These include serotonin-dopamine antagonists (see dopamine antagonist and serotonin antagonist), multi-acting receptor-targeted <b>antipsychotics</b> (MARTA, those targeting several systems), and dopamine partial agonists, which are often categorized as atypicals.|$|R
50|$|There are two {{categories}} of antipsychotics: typical <b>antipsychotics</b> and atypical <b>antipsychotics.</b> Most <b>antipsychotics</b> are available only by prescription.|$|R
2500|$|The newer {{atypical}} <b>antipsychotics</b> are {{claimed to}} have an improved adverse effect profile than the typical <b>antipsychotics.</b> <b>Antipsychotics</b> are also sometimes used to treat distortions in thinking or false perceptions. Use of <b>antipsychotics</b> is generally short-term. One meta-analysis of two randomly controlled trials, four non-controlled open-label studies and eight case reports has suggested that several atypical <b>antipsychotics,</b> including olanzapine, clozapine, quetiapine and risperidone, may help BPD patients with psychotic-like, impulsive or suicidal symptoms. [...] However, there are numerous adverse effects of <b>antipsychotics,</b> notably Tardive dyskinesia (TD). Atypical <b>antipsychotics</b> are known for often causing considerable weight gain, with associated health complications.|$|R
5|$|However, the {{widespread}} use of <b>antipsychotic</b> drugs has long been controversial. There are several reasons for this. First, <b>antipsychotic</b> drugs are perceived as very aversive by people who have to take them, because they produce a general dullness of thought and suppress the ability to experience pleasure. Second, it is difficult to show that they act specifically against psychotic behaviors rather than merely suppressing all types of active behavior. Third, they can produce a range of serious side effects, including weight gain, diabetes, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, hormonal changes, and a type of serious movement disorder known as tardive dyskinesia. Some of these side effects may continue long after the cessation of drug use, or even permanently.|$|E
5|$|Metformin {{appears to}} be safe and {{effective}} to counteract the weight gain caused by <b>antipsychotic</b> drugs olanzapine and clozapine. Although modest reversal of clozapine-associated weight gain is found with metformin, primary prevention of weight gain is more valuable.|$|E
5|$|Psychiatric {{symptoms}} can {{be treated}} with medications {{similar to those used}} in the general population. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and mirtazapine have been recommended for depression, while atypical <b>antipsychotic</b> drugs are recommended for psychosis and behavioral problems. Specialist neuropsychiatric input is recommended as people may require long-term treatment with multiple medications in combination.|$|E
25|$|The {{side effects}} {{reportedly}} {{associated with the}} various atypical <b>antipsychotics</b> vary and are medication-specific. Generally speaking, atypical <b>antipsychotics</b> are widely believed to have a lower likelihood {{for the development of}} tardive dyskinesia than the typical <b>antipsychotics.</b> However, tardive dyskinesia typically develops after long-term (possibly decades) use of <b>antipsychotics.</b> It is not clear, then, if atypical <b>antipsychotics,</b> having been in use for a relatively short time, produce a lower incidence of tardive dyskinesia.|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} {{significant}} {{confusion about the}} relative advantage of new generation <b>antipsychotics</b> over first generation <b>antipsychotics</b> {{as well as of}} clinical trials performed to evaluate their efficacy vs. those designed to evaluate their effectiveness. Pragmatic or effectiveness clinical trials like CATIE and CUtLASS sponsored by governments have challenged the current worldview of the greater advantages of new generation over first generation <b>antipsychotics</b> and suggested more clinical applicability of older <b>antipsychotics.</b> Public policy regarding the role and place of modern <b>antipsychotics</b> in schizophrenia treatment is usually guided by the imperfect state of clinical trials and by economic constraints. The right question is not whether new generation <b>antipsychotics</b> are better than first generation <b>antipsychotics</b> in terms of effectiveness, tolerability and safety. How to reach personalized, evidence based and value oriented decision making in the complex treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, that is the question now. Personalized medicine in psychiatry is not possible without the availability of enough number of different modern <b>antipsychotics...</b>|$|R

5|$|Schizophrenia {{has great}} human and {{economic}} costs. It {{results in a}} decreased life expectancy by 10–25years. This is primarily because of its association with obesity, poor diet, sedentary lifestyles, and smoking, with an increased rate of suicide playing a lesser role. <b>Antipsychotic</b> medications may also increase the risk. These differences in life expectancy increased between the 1970s and 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The {{first-line}} {{psychiatric treatment}} for schizophrenia is <b>antipsychotic</b> medication, which {{can reduce the}} positive symptoms of psychosis in about 7 to 14 days. Antipsychotics, however, fail to significantly improve the negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction. In those on antipsychotics, continued use decreases the risk of relapse. There is little evidence regarding effects from their use beyond two or three years. However use of anti-psychotics can lead to dopamine hypersensitivity increasing the risk of symptoms if antipsychotics are stopped.|$|E
5|$|The {{mainstay}} of treatment is <b>antipsychotic</b> medication, along with counselling, {{job training and}} social rehabilitation. It is unclear whether typical or atypical antipsychotics are better. In {{those who do not}} improve with other antipsychotics clozapine may be tried. In more serious situations where there is risk to self or others involuntary hospitalization may be necessary, although hospital stays are now shorter and less frequent than they once were.|$|E

25|$|Atypical <b>antipsychotics</b> {{are most}} {{commonly}} administered orally. <b>Antipsychotics</b> {{can also be}} injected, but this method is not as common. They are lipid-soluble, are readily absorbed from the digestive tract, and can easily pass the blood–brain barrier and placental barriers. Once in the brain, the <b>antipsychotics</b> work at the synapse by binding to the receptor. <b>Antipsychotics</b> are completely metabolized {{in the body and}} the metabolites are excreted in urine. These drugs have relatively long half-lives. Each drug has a different half-life, but the occupancy of the D2 receptor falls off within 24 hours with atypical <b>antipsychotics,</b> while lasting over 24 hours for the typical <b>antipsychotics.</b> This may explain why relapse into psychosis happens quicker with atypical <b>antipsychotics</b> than with typical <b>antipsychotics,</b> as the drug is excreted faster and is no longer working in the brain. Physical dependence with these drugs is very rare. However, if the drug is abruptly discontinued, psychotic symptoms, movement disorders, and sleep difficulty may be observed. It is possible that withdrawal is rarely seen because the AAP are stored in body fat tissues and slowly released.|$|R
25|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests a {{role of the}} α1 adrenoceptor and 5-HT2A receptor in the metabolic effects of atypical <b>antipsychotics.</b> The 5-HT2A receptor, however, is also believed to {{play a crucial role}} in the therapeutic advantages of atypical <b>antipsychotics</b> over their predecessors, the typical <b>antipsychotics.</b>|$|R
5|$|The primary {{treatment}} of schizophrenia is <b>antipsychotic</b> medications, often {{in combination with}} psychological and social supports. Hospitalization may occur for severe episodes either voluntarily or (if mental health legislation allows it) involuntarily. Long-term hospitalization is uncommon since deinstitutionalization beginning in the 1950s, although it still occurs. Community support services including drop-in centers, visits by members of a community mental health team, supported employment and support groups are common. Some evidence indicates that regular exercise has {{a positive effect on}} the physical and mental health of those with schizophrenia.|$|E
5|$|A {{more general}} medical and {{neurological}} examination {{may be needed}} to rule out medical illnesses which may rarely produce psychotic schizophrenia-like symptoms, such as metabolic disturbance, systemic infection, syphilis, AIDS dementia complex, epilepsy, limbic encephalitis, and brain lesions. Stroke, multiple sclerosis, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and dementias such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy Body dementia may also be associated with schizophrenia-like psychotic symptoms. It may be necessary to rule out a delirium, which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations, acute onset and fluctuating level of consciousness, and indicates an underlying medical illness. Investigations are not generally repeated for relapse unless there is a specific medical indication or possible adverse effects from <b>antipsychotic</b> medication. In children hallucinations must be separated from typical childhood fantasies.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are also}} used to treat the acute panic caused by {{hallucinogen}} intoxication. Benzodiazepines {{are also used}} to calm the acutely agitated individual and can, if required, be given via an intramuscular injection. They can sometimes be effective in the short-term treatment of psychiatric emergencies such as acute psychosis as in schizophrenia or mania, bringing about rapid tranquillization and sedation until the effects of lithium or neuroleptics (antipsychotics) take effect. Lorazepam is most commonly used but clonazepam is sometimes prescribed for acute psychosis or mania; their long-term use is not recommended due to risks of dependence. Further research investigating the use of benzodiazepines alone and in combination with <b>antipsychotic</b> medications for treating acute psychosis is warranted.|$|E
50|$|Bipolar {{patients}} taking <b>antipsychotics</b> {{have lower}} scores on tests {{of memory and}} full-scale IQ than patients taking other mood stabilisers.

5|$|In 1999, Weston {{was found}} incompetent {{to stand trial}} due to mental illness as {{he was a man}} with {{schizophrenia}} who stopped taking his medication. A judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia ordered that he be treated with <b>antipsychotic</b> medication without his consent in 2001, and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the decision. In 2004, the court determined that Weston still was not competent to be tried, despite ongoing treatment, and suspended but did not dismiss the criminal charges against him. Weston was known to the United States Secret Service prior to the incident as a person who had threatened the President of the United States.|$|E
5|$|More global {{behavioural}} abnormalities may be noted, {{such as an}} increase in arousal and movement (described as psychomotor agitation or hyperactivity) which might reflect mania or delirium. An inability to sit still might represent akathisia, {{a side effect of}} <b>antipsychotic</b> medication. Similarly, a global decrease in arousal and movement (described as psychomotor retardation, akinesia or stupor) might indicate depression or a medical condition such as Parkinson's disease, dementia or delirium. The examiner would also comment on eye movements (repeatedly glancing to one side can suggest that the patient is experiencing hallucinations), and the quality of eye contact (which can provide clues to the patient's emotional state). Lack of eye contact may suggest depression or autism.|$|E
5|$|Abnormalities of behavior, {{also called}} {{abnormalities}} of activity, include observations of specific abnormal movements, {{as well as}} more general observations of the patient's level of activity and arousal, and observations of the patient's eye contact and gait. Abnormal movements, for example choreiform, athetoid or choreoathetoid movements may indicate a neurological disorder. A tremor or dystonia may indicate a neurological condition or the side effects of <b>antipsychotic</b> medication. The patient may have tics (involuntary but quasi-purposeful movements or vocalizations) which may be a symptom of Tourette's syndrome. There are a range of abnormalities of movement which are typical of catatonia, such as echopraxia, catalepsy, waxy flexibility and paratonia (or gegenhalten). Stereotypies (repetitive purposeless movements such as rocking or head banging) or mannerisms (repetitive quasi-purposeful abnormal movements such as a gesture or abnormal gait) may be a feature of chronic schizophrenia or autism.|$|E

40|$|The {{introduction}} of <b>antipsychotics</b> 50 years ago caused {{a revolution in}} psychiatry and deinstitutionalised psychotic patients on a massive scale. However, the new atypical <b>antipsychotics</b> introduced in the last 25 years have done very little to improve the treatment of psychosis. During this period pharmacological research into new <b>antipsychotics</b> has concentrated {{on the development of}} drugs which are just as effective as typical <b>antipsychotics</b> but which cause fewer extra-pyramidal side effects and have a more powerful effect on negative symptoms and cognitive problems. Although some patients have undoubtedly benefited from these new atypical <b>antipsychotics,</b> the drugs have not lived up to our expectation...|$|R
50|$|The role {{of typical}} <b>antipsychotics</b> {{has come into}} {{question}} recently as {{studies have suggested that}} typical <b>antipsychotics</b> may increase the risk of death in elderly patients. A retrospective cohort study from the New England Journal of Medicine on Dec. 1, 2005 showed an increase in risk of death with the use of typical <b>antipsychotics</b> that was on par with the increase shown with atypical <b>antipsychotics.</b> This has led some to question the common use of <b>antipsychotics</b> for the treatment of agitation in the elderly, particularly with the availability of alternatives such as mood stabilizing and antiepileptic drugs.|$|R
5|$|No {{medications}} directly {{treat the}} core symptoms of AS. Although {{research into the}} efficacy of pharmaceutical intervention for AS is limited, {{it is essential to}} diagnose and treat comorbid conditions. Deficits in self-identifying emotions or in observing effects of one's behavior on others can make it difficult for individuals with AS to see why medication may be appropriate. Medication can be effective in combination with behavioral interventions and environmental accommodations in treating comorbid symptoms such as anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, inattention and aggression. The atypical <b>antipsychotic</b> medications risperidone and olanzapine have been shown to reduce the associated symptoms of AS; risperidone can reduce repetitive and self-injurious behaviors, aggressive outbursts and impulsivity, and improve stereotypical patterns of behavior and social relatedness. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline have been effective in treating restricted and repetitive interests and behaviors.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{extensive}} research into metallopharmaceuticals, including discussion of rhodium compounds in medicine. A substantial {{body of research}} has examined using metallocene derivatives of ruthenium and iron as metallopharmaceuticals. One area of such research has utilised metallocenes {{in place of the}} fluorophenyl group in haloperidol, which is a pharmaceutical classified as a typical <b>antipsychotic.</b> The ferrocenyl–haloperidol compound investigated has structure (C5H5)Fe(C5H4)–C(=O)–(CH2)3–N(CH2CH2)2C(OH)–C6H4Cl and can be converted to the ruthenium analog via a transmetalation reaction. Using the radioactive isotope 103Ru produces a ruthenocenyl–haloperidol radiopharmaceutical with a high affinity for lung but not brain tissue in mice and rats. Beta-decay of 103Ru produces the metastable isotope 103mRh in a rhodocenyl–haloperidol compound. This compound, like other rhodocene derivatives, has an unstable 19-valence electron configuration and rapidly oxidises to the expected cationic rhodocenium–haloperidol species. The separation of the ruthenocenyl–haloperidol and the rhodocenium–haloperidol species and the distributions of each amongst bodily organs has been studied. 103mRh has a half-life of 56min and emits a gamma ray of energy 39.8keV, so the gamma-decay of the rhodium isotope should follow soon after the beta-decay of the ruthenium isotope. Beta- and gamma-emitting radionuclides used medically include 131I, 59Fe, and 47Ca, and 103mRh has been proposed for use in radiotherapy for small tumours.|$|E
5|$|Management {{is based}} {{primarily}} on stopping the usage of the precipitating drugs, the administration of serotonin antagonists such as cyproheptadine, and supportive care including the control of agitation, the control of autonomic instability, and the control of hyperthermia. Additionally, those who ingest large doses of serotonergic agents may benefit from gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal {{if it can be}} administered within an hour of overdose. The intensity of therapy depends on the severity of symptoms. If the symptoms are mild, treatment may only consist of discontinuation of the offending medication or medications, offering supportive measures, giving benzodiazepines for myoclonus, and waiting for the symptoms to resolve. Moderate cases should have all thermal and cardiorespiratory abnormalities corrected and can benefit from serotonin antagonists. The serotonin antagonist cyproheptadine is the recommended initial therapy, although there have been no controlled trials demonstrating its efficacy for serotonin syndrome. Despite the absence of controlled trials, {{there are a number of}} case reports detailing apparent improvement after people have been administered cyproheptadine. Animal experiments also suggest a benefit from serotonin antagonists. Cyproheptadine is only available as tablets and therefore can only be administered orally or via a nasogastric tube; it is unlikely to be effective in people administered activated charcoal and has limited use in severe cases. Additional pharmacological treatment for severe case includes administering atypical <b>antipsychotic</b> drugs with serotonin antagonist activity such as olanzapine. Critically ill people should receive the above therapies as well as sedation or neuromuscular paralysis. People who have autonomic instability such as low blood pressure require treatment with direct-acting sympathomimetics such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, or phenylephrine. Conversely, hypertension or tachycardia can be treated with short-acting antihypertensive drugs such as nitroprusside or esmolol; longer acting drugs such as propranolol should be avoided as they may lead to hypotension and shock. The cause of serotonin toxicity or accumulation is an important factor in determining the course of treatment. Serotonin is catabolized by monoamine oxidase in the presence of oxygen, so if care is taken to prevent an unsafe spike in body temperature or metabolic acidosis, oxygenation will assist in dispatching the excess serotonin. The same principle applies to alcohol intoxication. In cases of serotonin syndrome caused by monoamine oxidase inhibitors oxygenation will not help to dispatch serotonin. In such instances, hydration is the main concern until the enzyme is regenerated.|$|E
40|$|Abstracts for the 12 th International Congress on Schizophrenia Research (ICOSR) Session - 9. 9. Health Economics and Services ResearchThis naturalistic study {{reviews the}} use of <b>antipsychotics</b> in {{patients}} with psychotic disorders {{in the first three}} years of psychiatric treatment. This historical-controlled study included 700 patients first presented to the local early intervention programme (EI) from 2001 to 2003, and 700 patients first presented to standard care service (SC) from 1998 to 2001. The data were systematically extracted from medical records according to operationalized definitions. In the EI group, 22. 2 % of cases were prescribed atypical <b>antipsychotics</b> as the initial pharmacotherapy, which increased to 59. 4 % and 58. 7 % in the first and second switches of <b>antipsychotics</b> respectively. Respective statistics in the SC group (6. 3 %, 19. 5 % and 23. 4 %, all p-value <. 001) were significantly lower than the EI group. In EI, the three most frequently prescribed <b>antipsychotics</b> in initial treatment were conventionals: haloperidol (28. 6 %), trifluoperazine (23. 7 %) and sulpiride (14. 5 %). First switch of <b>antipsychotics</b> was mainly risperidone (22. 0 %), olanzapine (19. 3 %) and sulpiride (11. 1 %). Second switch of <b>antipsychotics</b> was mainly to olanzapine (19. 9 %), risperidone (13. 6 %) and sulpiride (10. 7 %). In SC, the three most frequently prescribed <b>antipsychotics</b> in the initial treatment were haloperidol (32. 1 %), trifluoperazine (26. 6 %) and chlorpromazine (12. 7 %). First switch of <b>antipsychotics</b> were mainly conventional <b>antipsychotics,</b> which were trifluoperazine (15. 3 %), sulpiride (15. 0 %) and chlorpromazine (11. 1 %). The second switch of <b>antipsychotics</b> was similar to the first switch: sulpiride (16. 9 %), chlorpromazine (14. 9 %) and trifluoperazine (12. 9 %). In {{the first three years of}} psychiatric treatment, the findings revealed that early intervention programme in Hong Kong had a different practice in prescribing <b>antipsychotics.</b> Atypical <b>antipsychotics</b> were more widespread in use in the EI group while conventional <b>antipsychotics</b> remained to be the major pharmacotherapy in the SC group. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
