5|$|In parody masses, {{the source}} {{material}} {{was not a}} single line, but an entire texture, often of a popular song. Several works by Josquin fall loosely into this category, including the Missa Fortuna desperata, based on the three-voice song Fortuna desperata (possibly by Antoine Busnois); the Missa Malheur me bat (based on a chanson variously ascribed to Obrecht, Ockeghem, or, most likely, Abertijne Malcourt); and the Missa Mater Patris, based on a three-voice motet by Antoine Brumel. The Missa Mater Patris is probably the first true parody mass to be composed, for it no longer contains <b>any</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> a cantus firmus. Parody technique was to become the most usual means of mass composition {{for the remainder of the}} 16th century, although the mass gradually fell out of favor as the motet grew in esteem.|$|E
5|$|Whilst the Coronation {{class was}} {{represented}} at the 1948 British Railways locomotive exchange trials, designed {{to compare the}} performances of similar locomotives from {{all four of the}} pre-nationalised companies, the representative engine performed disastrously. Gone was <b>any</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> the power that could be unleashed by these engines; instead, uncharacteristically low coal consumption was the target. If the trials were forgettable, other achievements of the class are certainly memorable. Firstly, No. 6220 Coronation held the British steam speed record between 1937 and 1939. Secondly, No. 6234 Duchess of Abercorn holds the record to this day for the greatest British power output to be officially recorded on an attached dynamometer car, achieved in 1939. Unfortunately the most memorable event {{in the history of the}} class was the Harrow and Wealdstone rail crash precipitated by 46242 City of Glasgow. This was the second worst rail crash in British history, the death toll being 112.|$|E

25|$|There is {{historical}} evidence that some cultures strongly discouraged cleavage or <b>any</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> a bosom. Early English Puritans used a tight bodice to flatten breasts completely, while 17th century Spaniards put lead plates across the chests {{of young girls}} to prevent their bosoms from developing.|$|E

5000|$|Similar {{to other}} Griffith productions, Way Down East was {{subjected}} to censorship by some American state film censor boards. For example, the Pennsylvania film board required over 60 cuts in the film, removing the mock marriage and honeymoon between Lennox and Anna as well as <b>any</b> <b>hints</b> <b>of</b> her pregnancy, effectively destroying the film's integral conflict. The resulting film may have surprised viewers in that state when a child suddenly appears shortly before its death. Other cuts removed scenes where society women smoked cigarettes and an intertitle with the euphemism [...] "wild oats." ...|$|R
25|$|Fulfilling Garvey's wishes, VanDerZee's job was {{to project}} a {{positive}} image of the Association, especially to emphasize the strength and social standing of its membership, the so-called Garveyites. Nowhere in VanDerZee's visual record was there <b>any</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> the controversy surrounding Garvey in the early 1920s: a period when the leader was subject to public interrogation, quarrels with the writer and philosopher W.E.B.

25|$|It {{is notable}} that some sources {{indicate}} that Axouch was much attached to Isaac and, at least {{early in his}} reign, Manuel was suspicious of <b>any</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> collusion between his brother and Axouch.

On the contrary, this album rips through 15 tracks of high-energy punk that's {{accompanied}} by heavy bass leads and Armstrong's permanently slurred vocals. And to top it all off, the lyrical content deals with urban blight and the lifestyle of being a public nuisance. With this trademark sound, Rancid provide the perfect soundtrack for any car chase that includes massive property damage; is it a wonder MTV wouldn't touch this?" ...|$|R

Accepted into Johnny & Associates {{in their early}} teens, these boys, collectively known as 'Johnnys', are trained and promoted {{to become the next}} leading singing-acting-commercially successful hit sensations.

25|$|When the {{hurricane}} hit North Carolina, it flooded hog waste lagoons and released 25 {{million gallons of}} manure into the rivers, which contaminated the water supply and reduced water quality. Ronnie Kennedy, Duplin County director for environmental health, said that of 310 private wells he had tested for contamination since the storm, 9 percent, or three times the average across eastern North Carolina, had faecal coliform bacteria. Normally, tests showing <b>any</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> faeces in drinking water, an indication {{that it can be}} carrying disease-causing pathogens, are cause for immediate action.|$|E
25|$|Foreign aid to {{the region}} is a {{difficult}} proposition, according to Craig Cohen, {{an analyst at the}} Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C. Since security is difficult, local nongovernmental organizations are required to distribute aid, but {{there is a lack of}} trust amongst NGOs and other powers that hampers distribution. Pakistani NGOs are often targets of violent attacks by Islamist militants in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. Due to the extensive hostility to <b>any</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> foreign influence, the American branch of Save the Children was distributing funding anonymously in the region as of July 2007.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} various models realizing baryogenesis {{during the}} electroweak phase transition (EWBG). Our focus is their possible detection in future collider experiments and possible observation of gravitational waves emitted during the phase transition. We also discuss {{the possibility of}} a non-standard cosmological history which can facilitate EWBG. We show how acceptable parameter space can be extended due to such a modification and conclude that next generation precision experiments such as the ILC will be able to confirm or falsify many models realizing EWBG. We also show that, in general, collider searches are a more powerful probe than gravitational wave searches. However, observation of a deviation from the SM without <b>any</b> <b>hints</b> <b>of</b> gravitational waves can point to models with modified cosmological history that generically enable EWBG with weaker phase transition and thus, smaller GW signals...|$|R

25|$|Christian and Manichaean missionaries {{considered}} this doctrine to be exemplary of the Zoroastrian faith {{and it was}} these and similar texts that first reached the west. Corroborated by Anquetil-Duperron’s “erroneous rendering” of Vendidad 19.9, these led to the late 18thcentury conclusion that Infinite Time was the first Principle of Zoroastrianism and Ohrmuzd was therefore only “the derivative and secondary character”. Ironically, {{the fact that no}} Zoroastrian texts contained <b>any</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> the born-of-Zurvan doctrine was considered to be evidence of a latter-day corruption of the original principles. The opinion that Zoroastrianism was so severely dualistic that it was, in fact, ditheistic or even tritheistic would be widely held until the late 19thcentury (Dhalla, 1932:490-492; cf. Boyce, 2002:687).|$|E
25|$|In December as Emma's first {{pregnancy}} progressed, Charles {{fell ill}} and accomplished little {{during the following}} year. He did accept {{a position on the}} Council of the Geographical Society in May 1840. In 1841 he became able to work for short periods a couple of days a week, and produced a paper on stones and debris being carried by ice floes, but his condition did not improve. Having consulted his father he began looking for a house in the countryside to escape a city suffering from economic depression and civil unrest. Owen {{was one of the few}} scientific friends to visit Darwin at this time, but Owen's opposition to <b>any</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> Transmutation made Darwin keep quiet about his theories.|$|E
25|$|Although {{direct and}} open {{confrontation}} ceased, the Communist party continued {{to control and}} manipulate {{the art of the}} bandurist through a variety of indirect means. Bandura players now had to censor their repertoire and stop any cultural aspects that were deemed to be anti-Soviet. This included songs with religious texts or melodies, Christmas carols, historic songs about the cossack past, and songs with <b>any</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> a nationalistic sub-text. Some bandurists rose in the ranks of the Communist Party to become high-level administrators. (e.g. Professor Serhiy Bashtan was the first secretary of the Communist Party at the Kiev conservatory for over 30 years and, in that position, restricted the development of many aspects of Ukrainian culture in the premier music establishment in Ukraine).|$|E

25|$|In 1934, Mutual filed a {{complaint}} with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regarding its difficulties in establishing new stations, in a radio market that was already being saturated by NBC and CBS. In 1938, the FCC began a series of investigations into the practices of radio networks and published its report on the broadcasting of network radio programs in 1940. The report recommended that RCA give up control of either NBC Red or NBC Blue. At that time, the NBC Red Network was the principal radio network in the United States and, according to the FCC, RCA was using NBC Blue to eliminate <b>any</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> competition. Having no power over the networks themselves, the FCC established a regulation forbidding licenses to be issued for radio stations if they were affiliated with a network which already owned multiple networks that provided content of public interest.|$|E
25|$|Kardar captained Pakistan {{against all}} the Test playing nations of the day, and {{achieved}} an unparalleled distinction of leading his team to victory against each of them, which was remarkable for a nascent cricketing nation. Especially famous was the series-levelling victory achieved touring England in 1954 at The Oval. Kardar and his men also created history by winning the first-ever and only Test against Australia in Karachi in 1957. Although aggressive, motivated and confident, Kardar's Pakistan was yet immature, inexperienced and raw in their cricketing skills to win series victories. The attitude of the players was especially criticised when all the five Tests played by the Indian cricket team on its first tour of Pakistan in 1954–1955 ended in a draw. The fear of both Indian and Pakistani players of losing to each other, owing to political tensions and the bloody legacy of independence, {{was too much for}} competitive cricket to be played. During his tenure, Pakistan won six, lost six and drew eleven matches in a total of 23 Tests. In all his positions of authority, he was inclined to be dictatorial and quickly angered, especially by <b>any</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> criticism. But he was also a visionary and was an advocate of neutral umpires. Kardar retired from international Test cricket in 1958.|$|E

40|$|We present {{up-to-date}} {{constraints on}} a generic Higgs parameter space.

We show that, using the expected and observed exclusions which are quoted for each search channel, we can fully reconstruct likelihood profiles under very reasonable and simple assumptions. Even working with this somewhat limited information, we show that our method is sufficiently accurate to warrant its study and advocate its use over more naive prescriptions. Using this method, we can begin to narrow in on the remaining viable parameter space for a Higgs-like scalar state, and to ascertain the nature <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>hints</b> <b>of</b> new physics - Higgs or otherwise - appearing in the data...|$|R
