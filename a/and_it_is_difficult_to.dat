5|$|Chemistry {{experiments}} {{have confirmed that}} nobelium behaves as a heavier homolog to ytterbium in the periodic table. The chemical properties of nobelium are not completely known: they are mostly only known in aqueous solution. Before nobelium's discovery, {{it was predicted that}} it would show a stable +2 oxidation state as well as the +3 state characteristic of the other actinides: these predictions were later confirmed, as the +2 state is much more stable than the +3 state in aqueous solution <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> keep nobelium in the +3 state.|$|E
5|$|Edward, {{or rather}} {{those who were}} {{wielding}} power on his behalf, also appointed {{a number of new}} ealdormen to positions in Wessex. Little is known of two of these men, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> determine which faction, if any, they belonged to. Edwin, probably ruling in Sussex, and perhaps also parts of Kent and Surrey, was buried at Abingdon, an abbey patronised by Ælfhere. Æthelmær, who oversaw Hampshire, held lands in Rutland, perhaps suggesting links to Æthelwine.|$|E
5|$|Minnie Island State Park offers {{opportunities}} for picnicking and fishing to visitors who reach it by boat. Though the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection lists boating as an activity, which is redundant because {{the island is}} accessible by boat. The Oh Ranger website advises visitors of the tiny island to use a kayak to access the island because the island is heavily wooded <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> find a spot to dock.|$|E

5|$|We {{know the}} titles of several lost works because of a list in Eusebius' Ecclesiastical History, 6.13.1-3. They include the Outlines, in eight books, and Against Judaizers. Others are known only from {{mentions}} in Clement's own writings, including On Marriage and On Prophecy, although few are attested by other writers <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> separate works which he intended to write from those which were actually completed.|$|E
5|$|The incline {{from there}} is not visible because of tree growth <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> get access to it without {{unreasonable}} encroachment on private property, although the OS map shows a public footpath crossing the incline {{about two-thirds of the}} way up. The remains of Brendon Hill station are Grade II listed. The remains of the summit winding house can be approached but are dangerous to enter: they are located just west of the junction of the B3224 and B3190 roads. A chapel built to attend to the spiritual needs of the miners and their families still stands at the junction.|$|E
5|$|The {{simulations}} run on Folding@home {{are used}} in conjunction with laboratory experiments, but researchers can use them to study how folding in vitro differs from folding in native cellular environments. This is advantageous in studying aspects of folding, misfolding, and their relationships to disease that are difficult to observe experimentally. For example, in 2011 Folding@home simulated protein folding inside a ribosomal exit tunnel, to help scientists better understand how natural confinement and crowding might influence the folding process. Furthermore, scientists typically employ chemical denaturants to unfold proteins from their stable native state. It is not generally known how the denaturant affects the protein's refolding, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> experimentally determine if these denatured states contain residual structures which may influence folding behavior. In 2010, Folding@home used GPUs to simulate the unfolded states of ProteinL, and predicted its collapse rate in strong agreement with experimental results.|$|E

25|$|The {{processors}} {{are available}} {{in a variety of}} speeds including 8 and 16MHz configurations, producing 2,100 and 4,376Dhrystones each. These processors have no floating-point unit, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> implement an FPU coprocessor (MC68881/2) with one because the EC series lacks necessary coprocessor instructions.|$|E
25|$|When most of Iranian {{surnames}} {{are used}} with a name, the name will be ended with a suffix _E or _ie (of) such as Hasan_e roshan (Hasan is name and roshan is surname) that means Hasan of Roshan or Mosa_ie saiidi (Muses of saiidi). The _e is not for surname <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> {{say it is a}} part of surname.|$|E
25|$|This {{method of}} {{detecting}} binaries {{is also used}} to locate extrasolar planets orbiting a star. However, the requirements to perform this measurement are very exacting, due to the great difference in the mass ratio, and the typically long period of the planet's orbit. Detection of position shifts of a star is a very exacting science, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> achieve the necessary precision. Space telescopes can avoid the blurring effect of Earth's atmosphere, resulting in more precise resolution.|$|E

25|$|Russert {{does not}} recall stating to Libby, in this conversation, {{anything}} about the wife of former ambassador Joe Wilson. Although he could not completely {{rule out the possibility}} that he had such an exchange, Russert was at a loss to remember it, and moreover, he believes that this would be the type of conversation that he would or should remember. Russert acknowledged that he speaks to many people on a daily basis <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> reconstruct some specific conversations, particularly one which occurred several months ago.|$|E
25|$|In general, one can {{say that}} the {{processes}} to make PET bottle flakes from collected bottles are as versatile as the different waste streams are different in their composition and quality. In view of technology there isn't just one way to do it. Meanwhile, there are many engineering companies that are offering flake production plants and components, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> decide for one or other plant design. Nevertheless, there are processes that are sharing most of these principles. Depending on composition and impurity level of input material, the general following process steps are applied.|$|E
25|$|They produce large mucus webs to filter-feed on {{phytoplankton}} {{but also}} small zooplankton. They eat the web with the captured prey and then re-reproduce a web net. The web {{is large and}} spherical <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> see during the day because of diffuse reflection. Webs are easier to see at night. Limacina helicina is easily disturbed (like all other Thecosomata); when disturbed, it retracts into its shell and destroys its web. Gilmer & Harbison (1991) have assumed, that Limacina helicina feeds while motionless (without actively swimming). Its web enables them neutral buoyancy or allow them slow sinking only.|$|E

50|$|In Australia, {{compulsory}} education was enacted in the 1870s, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>difficult</b> to enforce. People {{found it hard}} to afford for school fees. Moreover, teachers felt that they did not get high salary for what they have done.|$|R
25|$|It was a {{point of}} {{discussion}} at a Chetnik congress held in village Ba in central Serbia in January 1944; however, Moljević's ideas were never put into practice due to the Chetniks' defeat by Josip Broz Tito's Partisans (a predominantly Serb movement which became multi-ethnic by this time) <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> assess how influential they were, {{due to the lack}} of records from the Ba congress. Nonetheless, Moljević's core idea—that Serbia is defined by the pattern of Serb settlement, irrespective of existing national borders—was to remain an underlying theme of the Greater Serbian ideal.|$|E
25|$|Spamming remains {{economically}} viable because advertisers have no operating costs beyond {{the management of}} their mailing lists, servers, infrastructures, IP ranges, and domain names, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> hold senders accountable for their mass mailings. Because the barrier to entry is so low, spammers are numerous, and the volume of unsolicited mail has become very high. In the year 2011, the estimated figure for spam messages is around seven trillion. The costs, such as lost productivity and fraud, are borne by the public and by Internet service providers, which {{have been forced to}} add extra capacity to cope with the deluge. Spamming {{has been the subject of}} legislation in many jurisdictions.|$|E
25|$|Datames {{appears to}} have {{obtained}} the highest reputation in his day for courage and ability in war, which caused his fame to extend even among the Greeks, {{though he did not}} come into personal collision with them. Cornelius Nepos (to whose biographical sketch we owe the only connected narrative of his life) calls him the bravest and most able of all non-Greek and non-Roman generals, except Hamilcar and Hannibal; but there is much confusion in the accounts transmitted to us, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> assign the anecdotes of him recorded by Polyaenus to their proper place in his history. The chronology of the events related by Nepos is also very obscure; but according to that author and Diodorus it would appear that Datames must have died before Artaxerxes, probably 362 BC.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} part of the 20th century many Roman Catholic churches started schools to educate {{children}} of their parish.

25|$|Singing is an {{integrated}} and coordinated act <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> discuss {{any of the}} individual technical areas and processes without relating them to the others. For example, phonation only comes into perspective when it is connected with respiration; the articulators affect resonance; the resonators affect the vocal folds; the vocal folds affect breath control; and so forth. Vocal problems are often {{a result of a}} breakdown in one part of this coordinated process which causes voice teachers to frequently focus in, intensively, on one area of the process with their student until that issue is resolved. However, some areas of the art of singing are so much the result of coordinated functions {{that it is hard to}} discuss them under a traditional heading like phonation, resonation, articulation, or respiration.|$|E
25|$|This, {{according}} to the oaths taken, made Margaret the heir at three years of age, but that same year Robert Bruce, 5th Lord of Annandale had rebelled {{with the aid of}} his son the Earl of Carrick. The Bruces captured strongholds in Galloway, and as well as bolstering their position in the south-west where their rivals the Balliols also had influence, may have been making a bid for the Crown. However, Robert Bruce seems to have overestimated his chances of successfully pressing his claim, as further support {{does not appear to have}} been forthcoming, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> prove that even Bruce allies such as the Stewarts decided to back them, in spite of what some historians have inferred from the Turnberry Band of September 1286. The rebellion thus quickly fizzled out, though no drastic action was taken against the Bruces after they had handed back the castles they had seized. In this way, the Guardians possibly hoped to maintain the peace in Scotland between the competing claims of Robert Bruce and John Balliol, without jeopardising their ultimate loyalty to the realm, and probably to Margaret as the more generally accepted heir.|$|E
25|$|Although the University of Michigan Highway Safety Research Institute did get bad publicity, it was {{suggested}} {{that this is not the}} reason why they stopped using baboons. The University of Michigan's mission was to create safer cars for human use. In order to reach this goal, research and testing is inevitable. The cruelty and the moral dilemmas of animal testing did not trump researchers still using them as subjects. They reasoned that biomechanics data is needed for an experiment like this, which will lead to safer cars. Years later animal testing ceased and instead an instrumental dummy was created for replacement. In 1978, animals were their only source of subject that would be a reliable substitution to the human being. The disadvantage though to using an instrumental dummy or a human cadaver, is that the tissue is not alive and will not elicit the same response as, for an example, a live animal. Today, it is not common to see animals being tested upon for automobile accidents because of the advance in computers and technology. It is, although, difficult to use cadavers instead of animals because of human rights, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> obtain permission from the families, especially with children. Consent for a research and testing can occur only if the person responsible for giving consent is a competent person and one who also comprehends the research and testing procedures fully.|$|E
