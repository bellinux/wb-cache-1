5|$|Since 1887, {{the borough}} has {{included}} the former villages of Southcote and Whitley and small parts of Earley and Tilehurst. By 1911, it also encompassed the Oxfordshire village of Caversham {{and still more}} of Tilehurst. <b>A</b> <b>small</b> <b>area</b> of Mapledurham parish was added in 1977. An attempt to take over <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>area</b> of Eye and Dunsden parish in Oxfordshire was rejected because of strong local opposition in 1997. Today the borough itself is unparished, and the wards used to elect the borough councillors generally ignore the old parish boundaries and use invented ward names.|$|E
5|$|Ba Cụt was {{publicly}} guillotined on 13 July 1956, in Cần Thơ. His {{body was}} later diced into small pieces, {{which were then}} buried separately. Some followers, led by a deputy named Bảy Đớm, retreated to <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>area</b> beside the Cambodian border, where they vowed not to rest until Ba Cụt was avenged. Many of his followers later joined the Việt Cộng—the movement that succeeded the Việt Minh their leader had fought—and took up arms against Diệm.|$|E

5|$|However {{unlike the}} above {{examples}} most species have very restricted endemic ranges which may overlap resulting in natural hybrids. For instance {{in the vicinity}} of the Portuguese city of Porto where both N. pseudonarcissus and N. triandrus occur there are found various intersections of the two species while in <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>area</b> along part of the Portuguese Montego river are found intersectional hybrids between N. scaberulus and N. triandrus.|$|E
5|$|Hyacinthoides non-scripta forms a clade {{with three}} other species – H.hispanica, H.paivae and H.cedretorum – centred on the Iberian Peninsula.

Within Iberia, H.non-scripta and H.hispanica are geographically separated by the Duero river. The genus also contains seven further species, mostly distributed further east in the Mediterranean Basin.|$|E

5|$|Norte Chico {{sites are}} notable for {{exceptional}} collective density, {{as well as}} individual size. Haas argues that the density of sites in such <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>area</b> is globally unique for a nascent civilization. During the third millennium BC, Norte Chico may have been the most densely populated area of the world (excepting, possibly, northern China). The Supe, Pativilca, Fortaleza, and Huaura River valleys each have several related sites.|$|E

5|$|A band of {{convection}} formed {{northeast of}} Greg early on September7, inducing moderate to strong northeasterly wind shear on the cyclone. Combined with land interaction, the storm weakened to tropical storm intensity by 18:00UTC that day, and Greg made landfall near Cabo San Lucas three hours later, with winds of 60mph (95km/h). After turning west-northwest and then west, the cyclone moved over progressively cooler waters {{and continued to}} lose strength, although <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>area</b> of deep convection persisted. Greg weakened to a tropical depression by 18:00UTC on September8 before succumbing to the unfavorable environment and dissipating a day later west of Baja California Sur.|$|E
5|$|Anchoring near Darwin Bay, Beebe {{made his}} first attempt at {{studying}} sea animals in their native environment by descending into the ocean in a diving helmet. Beebe continued to perform helmet dives throughout his Galápagos expedition, documenting several previously unknown sea animals. In addition to his helmet dives, Beebe applied the same method of research that he had pioneered in the tropics to <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>area</b> of ocean, sailing in circles around it for ten days {{with the intention of}} documenting all actions and interactions of marine life within that area. This study yielded a collection of 3,776 fish of 136 species, many of them also new to science.|$|E
5|$|As the {{radiation}} sources can be precisely positioned at the tumour treatment site, brachytherapy enables a high {{dose of radiation}} {{to be applied to}} <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>area.</b> Furthermore, because {{the radiation}} sources are placed in or next to the target tumour, the sources maintain their position in relation to the tumour when the patient moves or if there is any movement of the tumour within the body. Therefore, the radiation sources remain accurately targeted. This enables clinicians to achieve a high level of dose conformity – i.e. ensuring the whole of the tumour receives an optimal level of radiation. It also reduces the risk of damage to healthy tissue, organs or structures around the tumour, thus enhancing the chance of cure and preservation of organ function.|$|E
