40|$|Concern over {{budgetary}} costs {{has been}} the traditional driving force behind changes to the EU's Common Agricultural Policy. While the recent MacSharry reform of this policy was more related to external pressures arising from the need {{to reach an agreement}} on agriculture in the GATT Uruguay Round, many expect the budgetary constraint to re-emerge towards the end of this decade, particularly {{in the light of the}} impending accession of a number of Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs). This paper argues that it is unlikely that there will be any budgetary need to further reform Europe's agricultural policy to accommodate the CEECs. Using a simple forecasting model of the FEOGA Guarantee budget, the paper demonstrates that, under a range of plausible assumptions for the key variables affecting the resources available for agricultural expenditure and the amount of that expenditure, a significant positive margin will emerge between the <b>agricultural</b> <b>guideline</b> and the cost of EU agricultural policy by the beginning of the next decade. While the budget constraint may disappear, however, both external and internal factors such as concern about agriculture's impact on the environment will remain as pressures for further CAP reform. ...|$|E
40|$|With {{the coming}} {{enlargement}} of the ED, and with the ongoing dispute over the national incidence of the ED-budget, budgetary discipline {{with respect to the}} general ED-budget will become of increasing importance. Budgetary discipline can be achieved by commitment to numerical targets, or by procedural strategic dominance of a party that is sympathetic to the efficient use of public resources (like a Minister of Finance on the national level). As for the ED-budget, at this moment a range of numerical targets is used, such as the VAT-call-up-rate and -ceiling, the own resources ceiling, and the <b>agricultural</b> <b>guideline.</b> As a result of Agenda 2000 these targets have been supplemented by rules concerning the structural policies, and regarding pre-accession and accession expenditure. In addition to these numerical rules, various procedural rules are used, mostly relating to the division of budgetary competence between Commission, Council, and Parliament, in stead of rules that institute strategic dominance of one of these parties. In this paper these rules as well as their application are critically assessed, focusing on the period 1977 - 1999. It is concluded that both Commission and Council have wrongfully stayed clear of introducing new procedural budgetary rules. Instead of that, they rely heavily on new numerical targets, that give cause to rigidity and creative budgeting...|$|E

40|$|The current ACIAR (Australian Centre for International <b>Agricultural</b> Research) <b>guidelines</b> for impact {{assessment}} of agricultural development projects see {{impact assessment}} as being useful for both accountability to stakeholders {{and as a}} learning tool {{to find out what}} works, what doesn’t work and why. The methodology involves the use of conventional economic evaluation and the estimation of a money metric based on measuring outcomes in terms of economic surplus changes attributable to directed actions and activities. On the question of accountability to stakeholders, this paper suggests that the money metric {{may not be the best}} outcomes-based measure of performance against development goals and that other performance indicators ought to be considered. The paper also suggests exploring other approaches to assess accountability including qualitative (narrative) methods as well as process-based accountability. On the question of using impact assessment as a learning tool, the paper suggests this might be quite useful for more traditional non-adaptive research, but is less useful for adaptive research projects involving participatory action research (PAR). With PAR projects, learning about what works, what doesn’t work and why already occurs as an integral part of the research process.

40|$|Background and Purpose: Various crop {{cultivation}} {{systems may}} affect field-dwelling organisms, representatives of both harmful and beneficial entomofauna. In this paper, attention {{was drawn to}} one of the factors which distinguishes organic and integrated farming, that is the application of chemical plant protection preparations. Materials and Methods: The experiment was conducted in Poland, at the Experimental Station IOR-PIB in Winna Góra near Środa Wielkopolska, on crop fields of lupine and pea. The experiment was composed of a block of organic fields (no chemical plant protection preparations) and another block, where a plant protection programme was carried out in line with the integrated <b>agricultural</b> production <b>guidelines.</b> Carabidae were caught into modified Barber traps, from May to the end of July in 2006, 2010 and 2014. Results and conclusions: As a result of our study, 8 848 specimens belonging to 67 species of Carabidae were collected. The most numerous species collected in the pea and lupine were: Poecilus cupreus, Pterostichus melanarius, Harpalus rufipes, Bembidion femoratum, Bembidion quadrimaculatum and Bembidion tetracolum. Overall, our results demonstrate that an application of chemical plant protection preparations decreases the abundance and species diversity of carabid beetles assemblages in studied crops and induces changes in particular life traits of carabids fauna. After the treatment, the abundance of large carabid beetles diminishes and their place is occupied by small zoophages. Furthermore, the forecrop {{could be one of the}} factors that influence assemblages of carabids on crop fields. </p...|$|R

40|$|Erosion of the {{productive}} surface soil from a landscape reduces crop production and alters chemical and physical {{properties of the}} soil, especially {{the thickness of the}} effective rooting depth and surface horizon thickness. Fast and reliable tools are needed to detect and map the thickness of soil horizons of eroded landscapes to allow for proper management of eroded soil for optimum agricultural production and environmental protection. A truck-mounted, constant rate profile cone penetrometer was used to determine horizon thickness and thus, map the distribution of various erosion levels of an eroded Dubuque silt loam soil, in southwest Wisconsin, USA. The penetrometer was pushed into the ground with the hydraulic cylinder of a soil probe mounted on a large truck, to a depth of approximately 1. 3 m. Data were collected continuously with a datalogger connected to a load cell and a string potentiometer depth guage. The 30 O tip of the penetrometer was constructed following the American Society of <b>Agricultural</b> Engineers <b>guidelines.</b> Data collected with the penetrometer correlate well with previously constructed maps of soil erosion distribution for the study site, where depth to clay residuum (2 Bt 2 horizon) was used to determine erosion severity.

A field experiment was conducted at the Research Farm of Faculty of Agriculture, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran, during growing season of 2009 - 2010. A split plot arrangement based on a complete randomized block design with three replications was used. Cultivation and no cultivation of Lathyrus sp. and Persian clover (Trifolium resopinatum) in autumn assigned to the main plots. The sub plot factor consisted of three different types of biofertilizers plus control, including 1 -nitroxin (containing of Azotobacter sp. and Azospirillum sp.), 2 - phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSB) (containing of Bacillus sp. and Pseudomonas sp.), 3 - biosulfur (containing of Thiobacillus ssp.) and 4 - control (no fertilizer). The results showed the effect of cover crops on seed number and seed weight per plant, biological and seed yield was significant, as the seed yield increased of 9 %. In general, biofertilizers showed superiority due to the most studied traits compared to control. Nitroxin, PSB and biosulfur increased biological yield of 44, 28 and 26 % compared to control, respectively. Cover crops and biofertilizers interactions, showed significant effect on all studied traits, as the highest and the lowest harvest index resulted in cover crop combined with biofertilizers (22. 1 %) and cultivation and no cultivation of cover crops combined with control (15. 3 %), respectively. The highest seed oil and protein content resulted from cover crops plus biofertilizers (42. 4 %) and cover crops plus PSB (22. 5 %), respectively. In general, the results showed cover crops cultivation in combination with biofertilizers application could be an ecological alternative for chemical fertilizers, in addition of achieving advantages of cover crops.

Dietary diversity is a commonly used proxy to assess dietary quality in low-income countries. This study identified predictors of household dietary diversity in Ethiopia and pattern of consumption of animal source food (ASF) among households. Methods Secondary data were analyzed from the 2011 Ethiopian Welfare Monitoring Survey (WMS). This survey used a structured questionnaire to collect socio-demographic and economic data. Dietary data were collected using a dietary diversity questionnaire measuring dietary diversity over the past 1 week. A Household Dietary Diversity Score (HDDS) was constructed according to the Food and <b>Agricultural</b> Organization (FAO) <b>guidelines.</b> Consumption of ASFs is described by its distribution among the regions and by HDDS. Multiple logistic regression analysis was fitted to identify independent predictors for HDDS. Results A total of 27, 995 households {{were included in the}} analyses. A little over half of the study households (52. 2 %) had more than four household members, and 75 % of households were male headed. The mean HHDS was five food groups.

40|$|Purpose This {{contribution}} investigates {{agricultural soils}} and sedimentary deposits {{in the province}} of Ferrara (Padanian alluvial plain, Northern Italy) in order to: examine their genesis; to define the geochemical background of the area; and to evaluate the existence of anthropogenic contamination. Moreover, environmental risk related to the presence of potentially toxic heavy metals that can be transferred into agricultural products (and consequently bio-accumulated in the food chain) was also assessed. Materials and methods The analyses (reported in an extensive supplementary dataset) include XRD, XRF and ICP-MS assessment of bulk sediments, tests of metal extraction with aqua regia, as well as analyses of local agricultural products, i. e. biomonitoring which is important in the evaluation of element mobility. Results and discussion Based on the results, GIS-based geochemical maps were produced and local background levels were defined. This approach demonstrated that high concentrations of Cr and Ni is a natural (geogenic) feature of the local alluvial terrains, which in turn is related to the origin and provenance of the sediments, as confirmed by the lack of top enrichment in all of the investigated sites. Tests of metal extraction and analyses of <b>agricultural</b> products provide <b>guidelines</b> for <b>agricultural</b> activities, suggesting that extensive use of sewage sludge, industrial slurry and manure (that are often rich in metals) should be minimised. Conclusions The dataset reported in this paper shows that the agricultural terrains of the studied alluvial plain are not characterised by anthropogenic heavy metal pollution.

40|$|The role {{of natural}} {{resources}} {{in the lives of}} rural children impacted by HIV/AIDS remains unexplored. This study highlights wild food use by rural children vulnerable to the impacts of HIV/AIDS as an important and regular activity that supplements their domestic diets. This work found that with an increase in vulnerability to HIV/AIDS, children rely more on wild foods. Through an 18 month project in the Eastern Cape, using a broad quantitative and qualitative school and non-school survey, individual interviews, food diaries, participant observation, interactive photography, and other participatory techniques, a total of 850 children's coping strategies and livelihoods were examined. The quality of children’s domestic diets was, on average, 60 % lower than the Food and <b>Agricultural</b> Organization (FAO) <b>guidelines.</b> However, 62 % of the children interviewed were supplementing their diets with wild foods, 30 % having over half their diet supplemented with wild foods. Dietary diversity showed a 13 % increase when wild food supplementation occurred. While traditionally rural children rely on reciprocal networks during times of crisis, we found that these networks were eroding from the pressures of HIV/AIDS. Begging, for some children, was replaced by wild food collection and a significantly larger proportion of children more vulnerable to HIV/AIDS relied on wild foods more than did less vulnerable children. Considering the heightened nutritional and energy needs of children, combined with the impact of HIV/AIDS on household food access, wild foods represent the last freely attainable food sources available to them. Hunting and collection of wild food is a group activity, which was found to have valuable psychosocial benefits. Commercialisation of wild foods was observed among 38 % of the children, with significantly more vulnerable children selling wild foods. The use of wild foods by rural children also had positive influences on the preservation of indigenous ecological knowledge. WriterOpenOffice. org 2. ...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The aim {{of this research is}} to determine whether Industrial Design has an important role to play in the design and development of agricultural equipment, particularly in Malaysia. It is perhaps natural to think of agricultural machinery and equipment as being functional devices with issues such as task performance, robustness and reliability in all weathers being paramount. So is there really a role for the industrial designer? It is argued here that effective design of agricultural products cannot be achieved by considering only the functional requirements and technological aspects, since there are also many human issues to be taken into account. Effectiveness of new product development depends on interdisciplinary team working. This research has been conducted utilising qualitative and quantitative survey methods consisting of interviews and postal questionnaires. The findings show the need for a broad approach to design and confirm that industrial design has an important contribution to make in Malaysian agricultural equipment industries. Introducing two design projects in this research has strengthened the research methodology. The purpose of these design projects is to implement the knowledge and skills of the researcher into agricultural machinery design activities as a means of gaining insight into the problems and processes fundamental to <b>agricultural</b> design. Design <b>guidelines</b> formulated from the research findings will provide Malaysian industrial designers with an approach for effective participation within agricultural design activities. These will help design teams to identify and consider the broad range of issues inherent in agricultural design projects, and hence to work more effectively. Designing agricultural machinery requires an understanding not only of the tasks, crops and the working environment but also of the people who will buy and use the products. Malaysian agricultural machinery design activities have been left, behind compared to some other countries.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project {{was to determine if}} Galaxiella nigrostriata populations could belong to a metapopulation. Metapopulation theory describes how multiple populations with occasional connectivity are a ‘population of populations’. Some populations’ habitats have optimal conditions (source habitats), others experience regular extinctions (sink habitats). Connectivity allows repopulation of extinct or uninhabited habitats. Galaxiella nigrostriata occurred randomly in 11 seasonal wetlands in the Kemerton wetland complex in south-west Western Australia over a 16 year period. The wetlands {{did not appear to be}} connected. Around 70 % of wetlands on the Swan Coastal Plain in south-west WA have been filled or degraded since European settlement around 180 years ago. Of those, seasonal wetlands are at most risk from degradation. Galaxiella nigrostriata mainly live in seasonal wetlands between Augusta and Albany and in three remnant populations on the Swan Coastal Plain. They are small freshwater fish (length), aestivate in moist wetland sediments when wetlands dry and live for about one year. Seasonal wetlands and G. nigrostriata are threatened by nutrient enrichment, salinity, introduced fish, landscape modification and changes to hydroperiod by groundwater abstraction and declining rainfall. Inundated wetlands that previously contained G. nigrostriata, and wetlands where they had not been recorded, were sampled throughout south-west WA. Fish and crayfish abundance was surveyed and water samples analysed on site and in a laboratory. Physical characteristics of each wetland and surrounding landscape were also recorded. Information about wetlands was analysed to determine if physico-chemical characteristics accounted for G. nigrostriata abundance or distribution between wetlands. Lentocorrals were then established in two Kemerton wetlands prior to inundation. They were sampled following inundation to determine how and where within a wetland G. nigrostriata entered the sediment to aestivate. Aestivation was examined to determine whether any physical features may be lacking which could inhibit population persistence. Galaxiella nigrostriata specimens from each population had morphological measurements and counts taken prior to tissue being removed for genetic analyses. Two mitochondrial DNA markers were used to investigate divergence and connectivity within and between populations and catchments. Most wetlands were small (mean 0. 6 ha), had tannin-stained water and 41 % vegetation cover. All wetlands exceeded guideline values for Fe and Zn and those near <b>agricultural</b> land exceeded <b>guideline</b> values for TN and TP. However, no physico-chemical water properties or habitat features impeded G. nigrostriata abundance or distribution between wetlands. Additionally, it was thought there may be a commensal relationship between G. nigrostriata and burrowing crayfish, with G. nigrostriata using burrows to enter the sediment. No relationship was found between G. nigrostriata, crayfish or their burrows, indicating an alternative way for them to enter the sediment. Genetic research and examination of wetland positions in the landscape confirmed G. nigrostriata populations (particularly Kemerton) are part of metapopulation. This research showed populations between catchments had not connected for thousands of years but populations in wetland complexes had recent connectivity. Management of wetlands requires investigation and monitoring of nearby wetlands which may be part of a metapopulation, and may affect population longevity of all wetlands...|$|R
