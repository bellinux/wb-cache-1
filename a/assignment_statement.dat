500|$|Python {{features}} sequence unpacking where multiple expressions, each evaluating {{to anything}} that can be assigned to (a variable, a writable property, etc), are associated in the identical manner to that forming tuple literals and, as a whole, are put on the left hand side of the equal sign in an <b>assignment</b> <b>statement.</b> The statement expects an iterable object on the right hand side of the equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided writable expressions when iterated through, and will iterate through it, assigning each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on the left.|$|E
500|$|Statements {{cannot be}} a part of an expression, so list and other comprehensions or lambda expressions, all being expressions, cannot contain statements. A {{particular}} case of this is that an <b>assignment</b> <b>statement</b> such as a = 1 cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement. This has the advantage of avoiding a classic C error of mistaking an assignment operator = for an equality operator == in conditions: if (c = 1) { ... } is syntactically valid (but probably unintended) C code but if c = 1: ... causes a syntax error in Python.|$|E

500|$|The <b>assignment</b> <b>statement</b> (token '=', the equals sign). This {{operates}} {{differently than}} in traditional imperative programming languages, and this fundamental mechanism (including {{the nature of}} Python's version of variables) illuminates many other features of the language. Assignment in C, e.g., x = 2, translates to [...] "typed variable name x receives a copy of numeric value 2". The (right-hand) value is copied into an allocated storage location for which the (left-hand) variable name is the symbolic address. The memory allocated to the variable is large enough (potentially quite large) for the declared type. In the simplest case of Python assignment, using the same example, x = 2, translates to [...] "(generic) name x receives {{a reference to a}} separate, dynamically allocated object of numeric (int) type of value 2." [...] This is termed binding the name to the object. Since the name's storage location doesn't contain the indicated value, it is improper to call it a variable. Names may be subsequently rebound at any time to objects of greatly varying types, including strings, procedures, complex objects with data and methods, etc. Successive assignments of a common value to multiple names, e.g., x = 2; y = 2; z = 2 result in allocating storage to (at most) three names and one numeric object, to which all three names are bound. Since a name is a generic reference holder it is unreasonable to associate a fixed data type with it. However at a given time a name will be bound to some object, which will have a type; thus there is dynamic typing.|$|E

50|$|Conventional, von Neumann {{programs}} are value-level: expressions {{on the right}} side of <b>assignment</b> <b>statements</b> are exclusively concerned with building a value that is then to be stored.|$|R
50|$|In {{computer}} programming, an <b>assignment</b> <b>statement</b> sets and/or re-sets {{the value}} {{stored in the}} storage location(s) denoted by a variable name; in other words, it copies a value into the variable. In most imperative programming languages, the <b>assignment</b> <b>statement</b> (or expression) is a fundamental construct.|$|E
5000|$|In most expression-oriented {{programming}} languages (for example, C), the <b>assignment</b> <b>statement</b> {{returns the}} assigned value, allowing such idioms as , {{in which the}} <b>assignment</b> <b>statement</b> [...] returns the value of , which is then assigned to [...] In a statement such as , the return value of a function is used to control a loop while assigning that same value to a variable.|$|E

40|$|AbstractNondeterminism is {{introduced}} into an ordinary iterative programming language by treating procedure calls as nondeterministic <b>assignment</b> <b>statements.</b> The effect of such <b>assignment</b> <b>statements</b> {{is assumed to}} be determined solely by the entry-exit specifications of the corresponding procedures. The nondeterminism which this approach yields is not necessarily bounded. The paper discusses the problem of defining a denotational semantic for programming languages with this kind of, possibly unbounded, nondeterminism. As an additional constraint, the semantics is required to be continuous, {{in the sense that the}} underlying semantic algebra is continuous. It is shown how such a continuous semantics for unbounded nondeterminism can be derived from a simple operational semantics based on program execution trees...|$|R

40|$|GENTRAN is a code {{generation}} and translation package implemented in RLISP to run under REDUCE. It generates complete numerical programs directly from REDUCE by transforming REDUCE prefix forms into formatted FORTRAN, RATFOR or C code. <b>Assignment</b> <b>statements,</b> control structures, type declarations, and subprogram headings {{can be generated}} from algorithmic specifications and symbolically derived formulas. An expression segmentation facility breaks large expressions into subexpressions of manageable size, and an interface to an existing code optimizer allows sequences of <b>assignment</b> <b>statements</b> {{to be replaced by}} their optimized equivalents. In addition, special file-handling facilities allow code generation to be guided by template files and output to be redirected to one or more files.
