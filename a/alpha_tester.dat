5000|$|Glitch {{was officially}} {{launched}} on September 27, 2011, but reverted to beta status on November 30, 2011, citing accessibility and depth issues. Glitch was officially shut down on December 9, 2012. In 2013, Children of Ur was created as a fan project and is currently up and running for public use. The whole game is being rewritten in HTML5 {{as an alternative to}} Dart, Glitch's original language. On December 9, 2014, another fan project to relaunch Glitch under the name Eleven began alpha testing. An <b>alpha</b> <b>tester</b> described Eleven as [...] "identical to Glitch". The two fan relaunches were made possible when all of Glitch's artwork and most of the source code was released under the public domain-like Creative Commons license CC0 on November 18, 2013.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{volume of}} {{personal}} information and data most Internet users find themselves amassing is ever increasing and the fast {{pace of the}} modern world results in most requiring instant access to their files. Millions of these users turn to cloud based file synchronisation services, such as Dropbox, Microsoft Skydrive, Apple iCloud and Google Drive, to enable “always-on ” access to their most up-to-date data from any computer or mobile device with an Internet connection. The prevalence of recent articles covering various invasion of privacy issues and data protection breaches in the media has caused many to review their online security practices with their personal information. To provide an alternative to cloud based file backup and synchronisation, BitTorrent Inc. released an alternative cloudless file backup and synchronisation service, named BitTorrent Sync to <b>alpha</b> <b>tester...</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{identified}} and purified a new DNA polymerase (DNA polymerase IV), {{which is similar}} to mammalian DNA polymerase beta, from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and suggested that it is encoded by YCR 14 C (POLX) on chromosome III. Here, we provided a direct evidence that the purified DNA polymerase IV is indeed encoded by POLX. Strains harboring a pol 4 deletion mutation exhibit neither mitotic growth defect nor a meiosis defect, suggesting that DNA polymerase IV participates in nonessential functions in DNA metabolism. The deletion strains did not exhibit UV-sensitivity. However, they did show weak sensitivity to MMS-treatment and exhibited a hyper-recombination phenotype when intragenic recombination was measured during meiosis. Furthermore, MAT alpha pol 4 delta segregants had a higher frequency of illegitimate mating with a MAT <b>alpha</b> <b>tester</b> strain than that of wild-type cells. These results suggest that DNA polymerase IV participates in a double-strand break repair pathway. A 3. 2 kb of the POL 4 transcript was weakly expressed in mitotically growing cells. During meiosis, a 2. 2 kb POL 4 transcript was greatly induced, while the 3. 2 kb transcript stayed at constant levels. This induction was delayed in a swi 4 delta strain during meiosis, while no effect was observed in a swi 6 delta strain...|$|E

50|$|ArenaNet {{has used}} open beta testing {{throughout}} {{the development of}} the Guild Wars series. For the first public appearance of Prophecies in April 2004, that occurred in conjunction with E3 2004, people were encouraged to download the client and play an online demo of the game to test its networking capabilities. This was followed by a preview event and several beta test weekend events. Both Factions and Nightfall had similar test weekends prior to their release. Nearly 500,000 players spent an average of 8.5 hours playing the Nightfall PvE content during its second beta test weekend. In addition to the public beta events, ArenaNet used continuously running closed alpha test servers throughout development; some <b>alpha</b> <b>testers</b> were ArenaNet employees but most were volunteers from the player community who signed a non-disclosure agreement with ArenaNet. After the release of Eye of the North, the bulk of the development and test teams were moved to the Guild Wars 2 project, though a small maintenance and QA team remains on the original Guild Wars project. The group of volunteer <b>alpha</b> <b>testers</b> was disbanded in January 2008, and no plans have yet been announced about repeating such an alpha test program for Guild Wars 2.|$|R

It outlines the major components of the workbench and their usage (Sections 1, 2, 3 and 6), as well as the structure and feature of the TPR-DB (Section 7). Since gaze information is the most valuable source for tracking translator e ort in text understanding, and due to the noise inherent in current head-free eye-tracking technology, Sections 4 and 5 report attempts to implement solutions for obtaining better gaze-to-word mapping accuracy. At the time of this writing, an installation guide 1 has been written and made available to a select group of <b>alpha</b> <b>testers</b> (researchers from universities and research laboratories) to prepare a wider release of the prototype...|$|R

40|$|Current {{software}} for AI development requires {{the use of}} programming languages to develop intelligent agents. This can be disadvantageous for AI designers, as their work needs to be debugged and treated as a generic piece of software code. Moreover, such approaches are designed for experts, requiring a steep initial learning curve, as they are tailored for programmers. This can be disadvantageous for implementing transparent inspection of agents, as additional work is needed to expose and represent information to end users. We are working towards {{the development of a new}} editor, ABOD 3, shown in fig. . It allows the graphical visualisation of BOD-based plans, including its two major derivatives: POSH and Instinct. The new editor is designed to allow not only the development of reactive plans, but also to debug such plans in real time to reduce the time required to develop an agent. This allows the development and testing of plans from a same application. The editor provides a user-customisable user interface (UI) aimed at supporting both the development and debug of agents. Plan elements, their subtrees, and debugging-related information can be hidden, to allow different levels of abstraction and present only relevant information. The graphical representation of the plan can be generated automatically, and the user can override its default layout by moving elements to suit his needs and preferences. The simple UI and customisation allows the editor to be employed not only as a developer's tool, but also to present transparency related information to the end-user to help them develop more accurate mental models of the agent. <b>Alpha</b> <b>testers</b> have already used ABOD 3 in experiments to determine the effects of transparency on the mental models formed by humans. Their experiments consisted of a non-humanoid robot, powered by the BOD-based Instinct reactive planner. They have demonstrated that subjects can show marked improvement in the accuracy of their mental model of a robot observed, if they also see an accompanying display of the robot's real-time decision making as provided by ABOD 3. They concluded that providing transparency information by using ABOD 3 does help users to understand the behaviour of the robot, calibrating their expectations. We plan to continue developing this new editor, implementing debug functions such as "fast-forward" in pre-recorded log files and usage of breakpoints in real-time. A transparent agent, with an inspectable decision-making mechanism, could also be debugged in a similar manner to the way in which traditional, non-intelligent software is commonly debugged. The developer would be able to see which actions the agent is selecting, why this is happening, and how it moves from one action to the other. This is similar to the way in which popular Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provide options to follow different streams of code with debug points. Moreover, we will enhance its plan design capabilities by introducing new views, to view and edit specific types of plan-elements and through a public beta testing to gather feedback by both experienced and inexperienced AI developers...|$|R
30|$|Kanode and Haddad (2009) {{stated that}} an important, but incorrect, {{assumption}} {{was made that}} GDSE follows the waterfall method. More recently, researchers have agreed that it must follow the incremental model (Munassar and Govardhan 2010) because it combines the waterfall method with an iterative process. A major concern, reported by Petrillo et al. (2009), was that very poor development methodologies are commonly used by developers for software creation in the game industry. The GDSE appears as a question in many forms attempting to determine what types of practices are used. However, {{there is no single}} answer to this question. Few researchers have explored GDSE practices and then tried to answer questions like the phases of the GDSE process life cycle. Blitz game studios (2014) proposed six phases for the GDSE process life cycle: Pitch (initial design and game concept), Pre-production (game design document), Main production (implementation of game concepts), <b>Alpha</b> (internal <b>testers),</b> Beta (third-party testers), and the Master phase (game launch). Hendrick (2014) proposed a five-phase GDSE process life cycle consisting of Prototype (initial design prototype), Pre-production (design document), Production (asset creation, source code, integration aspects), Beta (user feedback), and, finally, the Live phase (ready to play). McGrath (2014) divided the GDSE process life cycle into six phases: Design (initial design and game design document), Develop/redevelop (game engine development), Evaluate (if not passed, then redevelop), Test (internal testing), Review release (third-party testing), and Release (game launch). Another GDSE process life cycle proposed by Chandler (2010) consisted of four phases: Pre-production (design document and project planning), Production (technical and artistic), Testing (bug fixing), and, finally, the Post-production phase (post-mortem activities). The latest GDSE process life cycle in 2013 proposed by Ramadan and Widyani (2013) was based on the four GDSE process life cycles previously described. They proposed six phases: Initiation (rough concept), Pre-production (creation of game design and prototype), Production (formal details, refinement, implementation), Testing (bug reports, refinement testing, change requests), Beta (third-party testers), and Release (public release).|$|R
