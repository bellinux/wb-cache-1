40|$|AbstractRupture of the {{atrioventricular}} groove is {{an uncommon}} but dreaded complication of mitral valve replacement. We present {{the case of}} a 74 -year-old male submitted to mitral valve surgery, complicated by atrioventricular groove rupture presaged by the excessive rocking movement of the prosthesis seen in the pre-discharge transthoracic echocardiogram. <Learning objective: Valvular prosthesis rocking movement has been typically associated with paravalvular leaks and fistulae. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case to illustrate the association of excessive rocking movement with atrioventricular groove weakness, <b>anticipating</b> <b>subsequent</b> sulcus rupture and pseudoaneurysm formation. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPrevious {{research}} has indicated that the ability to integrate individual elements in the presence of noise is immature in 3 -month-old infants. The present study extended the developmental timeline by investigating 6 -month-olds’ ability to integrate individual elements into whole contours through an assessment of their capability to discriminate circle and square contours constructed from oriented Gabor patches via a newly designed cueing paradigm for infants. If infants discriminate the centrally-presented contour cues, then their eye movements would correctly <b>anticipate</b> <b>subsequent</b> target presentation at a rate greater than chance. The results indicated that infants integrated the contours and discriminated the different shapes, but, consistent with past research, this ability is still fairly immature at this age, tolerating limited amount of noise...|$|R

40|$|David Pocock (1928 - 2007) co-founded {{this journal}} with Louis Dumont, {{and it is}} easy to assume that they were intellectually more ‘like-minded’ than we believe was really the case. In {{the first part of this}} {{appreciation}} we offer some biographical and intellectual context for Pocock’s career. In the second, we identify the principal ways in which his sociological project did converge with Dumont’s and the respects in which it seems fundamentally different. Both were deeply influenced by Evans-Pritchard; but much of their difference is explained, we suggest, by Pocock’s prior loyalty to the teachings of the literary critic, F. R. Leavis. For good or ill, Pocock’s more reflexive preoccupations and his concern with the moral complexity of social life chime better with, and indeed <b>anticipate,</b> <b>subsequent</b> theoretical trends in the discipline...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to clarify the}} meaning of "policy" {{in the context of}} food and agriculture through a simple classification with examples. It is hoped that such a classification will facilitate comparisons of methodology and results of the various efforts to use formal systems analytic methods to evaluate policy. It is not likely that any specific systems analytic model will be sufficiently general to embrace the range of food and agriculture policies discussed. Nevertheless, in model construction it may be prudent to anticipate the need to evaluate policies other than the specific ones for which the model is intended. A classification may thus also assist in <b>anticipating</b> <b>subsequent</b> modification of a specific policy-evaluation model by taking into account common elements of a larger set of policies at the time of initial model construction...|$|R
