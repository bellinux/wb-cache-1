5|$|After {{suffering}} from a prolonged respiratory infection, Mandela died on 5 December 2013 {{at the age of}} 95, at around 20:50 local time (UTC+2) at his home in Houghton, surrounded by his family. Zuma publicly announced his death on television, proclaiming ten days of national mourning, a memorial service held at Johannesburg's FNB Stadium on 10 December 2013, and 8 December as a national day of prayer and reflection. Mandela's body lay in state from 11 to 13 December at the Union Buildings in Pretoria and a state funeral was held on 15 December in Qunu. Approximately 90 representatives of foreign states travelled to South Africa to attend memorial events. The media was <b>awash</b> <b>with</b> tributes and reminiscences, while images of and tributes to Mandela proliferated across social media. His $4.1 million estate was left to his widow, other family members, staff, and educational institutions.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his sudden death in 1940, Scott {{believed}} himself a failure, and Zelda's death in 1948 was little noted. However, interest in the Fitzgeralds surged in the years following their deaths. In 1950, screenwriter Budd Schulberg, who knew the couple from his Hollywood years, wrote The Disenchanted, with characters based recognizably on the Fitzgeralds who end up as forgotten former celebrities, he <b>awash</b> <b>with</b> alcohol and she befuddled by mental illness. It was followed in 1951 by Cornell University professor Arthur Mizener's The Far Side of Paradise, a biography of F. Scott Fitzgerald that rekindled interest in the couple among scholars. Mizener's biography was serialized in The Atlantic Monthly, and a story about the book appeared in Life magazine, then one of America's most widely read and discussed periodicals. Scott was viewed as a fascinating failure; Zelda's mental health was largely blamed for his lost potential.|$|E

5000|$|The only {{school is}} Lutumba SDA primary which {{is run by}} the Adventist church. It is served by {{secondary}} schools like Vhembe, Tshidixwa, Tongwe and Nuli with the nearest one Tshidixwa being about 5 kilometres away. This challenge of having few, and distant both primary and secondary schools makes the youths vulnerable to violent behaviors since others do not even see the mouth of the school while parents will be saying their children are at school. This challenge is affecting both the community and national development since these kids will be <b>awashed</b> <b>with</b> abject and squalid poverty since they will not be employed. Other school youths do not even complete ZJC. They cross to nearest plantations in SouthAfrica. The community needs special attention as far as sensitization of the importance of education in community development is concerned. The Secondary School which is under construction by the Seventh Day Adventist eastwards of the primary school will help the community to uproot intellectual zealous for community development. Close by is a Roman Catholic Training Centre.|$|R

Three times the galley had been washed out, and the men, in the {{forecastle}} <b>awash,</b> contented themselves <b>with</b> hard tack and cold salt horse.

25|$|With the {{increased}} demand in urban living downtown, there was interest in converting the structure to residential uses. However, the complex was <b>awash</b> <b>with</b> asbestos, which {{would need to}} be removed before any remodeling could begin. The complex was also poorly configured for residential, as it had a lot of floor space without windows, requiring demolition of some buildings. The two combinations made for an expensive reconversion.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} concession of March 14, 1925 {{covered all}} of Iraq, but IPC {{was reluctant to}} develop it quickly and production was restricted to fields constituting only one-half of 1 percent of the country's total area. During the Great Depression, the world was <b>awash</b> <b>with</b> oil and greater output from Iraq would simply have driven the price down to even lower levels. Delaying tactics were employed not only in actual drilling and development, but also in conducting negotiations on such matters as pipeline rights-of-way.|$|E
50|$|On 25 September 1999, Thomas S. Gates {{responded to}} a call for {{assistance}} from the United States Coast Guard vessel , then {{in the process of}} conducting boarding operations of the suspect merchant vessel Love. After an attempt by the Loves crew to scuttle their ship, the cruiser sent a damage control team to try to keep the merchant vessel seaworthy, but those efforts failed after repeated attempts to stop the flooding. The cruiser then sank the <b>awash</b> vessel <b>with</b> 5-inch gunfire as it was as a hazard to navigation.|$|R
40|$|Given the {{abundant}} human {{and natural resources}} located at rural areas, {{it is expected that}} rural dwellers will be <b>awashed</b> <b>with</b> continuous affluence. On the contrary, rural areas are deprived of the benefits of resources located within the area. Rural areas have continued to be subjected to all forms of deprivation and thus live in abject and excruciating poverty {{at the expense of the}} urban areas. This work attempted to examine the increasing or widening gulf of inequality and trace, over time, how the state has continued to roll out policies and strategies that have deprived rural areas of the basic needs of life at the expense of urban growth and consolidation. Thus, within the framework of the emergence and consolidation of the State of Zazzau, rural Zaria and its economy became subsumed into the survival operations of the city. This was facilitated through intense extraction of surplus and other forms of appropriations along with economic and political subordination leading to the further urban-rural gap. Lack of access to politically participate in and exert influence on decision making, quality education, health care services and other forms of deprivations that subjected rural communities of Zaria to intense poverty provoke them, more than anything else, to politically unite against their city counterparts and overlords. The point of departure of the study suggests that for prosperity to override on poverty, rural folks must be strategically strengthened, organized and turned out be politically proactive with enhanced services...|$|R
30|$|The highest {{diversity}} {{was recorded}} in Semu <b>Awash</b> kebele <b>with</b> Shannon index of 3.38 and the lowest was in Nuba kebele an index of 2.56. The Sorenson similarity/variation indices showed that Gurmina Hangeri/Meleka and Ediya/Gurmina Hangeri each pairs of kebeles share 18 clones with index value of 0.81 and 0.67, respectively. While lowest share recorded between Laignaw (upper) Kesheli and Tachignaw (lower) Kesheli kebeles with Sorenson indices of 0.16 (only five clones in common recorded). Enset bacterial wilt disease is distributed in all sampled kebeles in varying ranges. The rate of disease prevalence, incidence and severity lies between ranges of 75 – 100 %, 46.8 – 88.9 %, and 36.1 – 81.4 %, respectively. Semu Awasho and Laignaw Kesheli kebeles scored 100 % prevalence while in Shemona Metelo kebele it is scored 75 %.|$|R
25|$|The first West Ham {{home game}} {{after his death}} was on 6 March 1993, against Wolverhampton Wanderers. The Boleyn Ground was <b>awash</b> <b>with</b> floral tributes, scarves and other {{football}} memorabilia from both West Ham fans {{and those of other}} clubs. Fellow 1966 World Cup winners Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters placed a floral replica of a West Ham shirt, showing Moore's number, 6, on the back, on the centre spot before the game. West Ham rested the No. 6 for the game, with the regular No. 6, Ian Bishop, wearing No. 12. The game was won by West Ham 3–1 with goals by Trevor Morley, Julian Dicks and Matty Holmes for West Ham and Steve Bull for Wolves.|$|E
25|$|EIPH is most {{commonly}} diagnosed by endoscopic {{examination of the}} trachea and larger bronchi, with the optimal timing for endoscopy being 60–90 minutes after hard exercise. This post-exercise delay allows time for blood within the lungs {{to travel to the}} trachea. Blood can usually be detected in the trachea or bronchi for 1–3 days after an episode of EIPH, but may be present for up to a week. The amount of blood visible in the trachea at the time of examination is {{most commonly}} graded on a scale of 0 (no blood) to 4 (airways <b>awash</b> <b>with</b> blood). In some mildly-affected horses, endoscopy must be performed on multiple occasions to confirm a diagnosis of EIPH.|$|E
25|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1351, Ibn Battuta left Fez {{and made his way}} to the town of Sijilmasa on the {{northern}} edge of the Sahara in present-day Morocco. There he bought a number of camels and stayed for four months. He set out again with a caravan in February 1352 and after 25 days arrived at the dry salt lake bed of Taghaza with its salt mines. All of the local buildings were made from slabs of salt by the slaves of the Masufa tribe, who cut the salt in thick slabs for transport by camel. Taghaza was a commercial centre and <b>awash</b> <b>with</b> Malian gold, though Ibn Battuta did not form a favourable impression of the place, recording that it was plagued by flies and the water was brackish.|$|E

25|$|On 15 December 1918, {{only two}} days from New York, Yellowstone sighted a {{derelict}} three-masted schooner and altered course to close. She discovered the water-logged Joseph P. Cooper of Mobile, Alabama, abandoned with her decks and cabin <b>awash</b> and <b>with</b> her forerigging gone and her forecastle smashed in. Joseph P. Cooper looked like she had been adrift from six to eight weeks. After leaving the derelict, Yellowstone continued her passage and arrived at Pier 5, Bush Terminal, in Brooklyn on 17 December 1918. Shifting to Pier 1 {{at the end of}} December, she spent a week at anchor off the Statue of Liberty before returning to Bush Terminal and, later, shifting to the U.S. Army docks at Brooklyn. There, from 17 to 25 January 1919, Yellowstone took on board 5,150 tons of supplies and, on 25 January 1919, got underway for France.|$|R

25|$|Wynter {{returned}} to Australia, disembarking in Sydney on 19 February 1920. His AIF appointment was terminated on 18 April 1920 and he reverted to his permanent rank of major. He {{was entitled to}} retain his AIF rank as an honorary rank but would not be promoted to the substantive rank until 1 October 1931. Wynter was posted to the 4th Military District (South Australia) but his sojourn in Australia was brief. On 19 November 1920 he re-embarked for the United Kingdom to attend the Staff College, Camberley. The first two post-war classes at the re-opened Staff College were <b>awash</b> <b>with</b> distinguished students. Twenty had been brigadier generals; five had been awarded the Victoria Cross and no less than 170, including Wynter, had been awarded the Distinguished service Order. On returning to Australia in 1923, Wynter was posted to Army Headquarters in Melbourne as a staff officer. In 1925, he became Director of Mobilisation, responsible {{for the development of}} war plans.|$|E

2500|$|On 22 December, Trigger sighted a ship {{approaching}} from Uraga {{and made a}} surface attack. A spread of three torpedoes produced one hit forward of the bridge, and the target started to settle by the bow. The submarine fired one more torpedo into the ship and, when last seen, Teifuku Maru was <b>awash</b> forward <b>with</b> her screws nearly {{out of the water}}. On 31 December 1942, she attacked a cargo ship loaded with planes. Trigger fired three torpedoes from extremely close range , and watched two hit. The target began to list to starboard and was down by the bow. Sound reported a heavy secondary explosion. The submarine came up to periscope level and saw the freighter with her stern high {{out of the water and}} a destroyer approaching. Trigger went deep and when she next came up for a look, there was nothing to be seen. (The sinking was not confirmed by JANAC postwar.) ...|$|R

Directly after Awash station, the railway crosses the <b>Awash</b> River canyon <b>with</b> a 155 meters long bridge 60 meters above the canyon. It is the longest bridge of the whole railway. The railway then proceeds further northeastwards. After passing Dire Dawa, the railway changes course and heads directly for Djibouti. Crossing the border between Dewele and Ali Sabieh, it reaches the Djibouti passenger terminal at Nagad railway station, near Djibouti–Ambouli International Airport. Freight trains continue to the Port of Doraleh on diesel power.|$|R

Schock found Ogawa dead in the cockpit, and removed Ogawa's name tag from his flight suit, along with a letter Ogawa carried with him on his last mission, some photographs, a belt from Ogawa's parachute harness, and a large smashed aviator watch of the type that Japanese pilots wore around their necks.|$|R
500|$|His {{apparent}} {{decline in}} popularity {{may have been}} as much {{a reflection of the}} public's changing taste for entertainment as it was a comment on his act. By the time L'Estrange returned to Sydney to attempt his second harbour crossing in 1882, the city was <b>awash</b> <b>with</b> Blondin imitators performing increasingly dangerous, and probably illegal, feats. At least five were performing in Sydney from 1880 under variations of the title from the [...] "Young Blondin" [...] (Alfred Row) to the [...] "Blondin Brothers" [...] (Alexander and Collins), the [...] "Great Australian Blondin" [...] (James Alexander), the [...] "original Australian Blondin" [...] (Collins), the [...] "Great Australian Blondin" [...] (Signor Vertelli), the [...] "Female Australian Blondin" [...] (Azella) and another [...] "Australian Blondin" [...] (Charles Jackson).|$|E
500|$|Aronofsky {{planned to}} have a strong {{presentation}} of the thematic movement from darkness into light. He originally sought to show only a silhouette of the man until the second of the film's three acts, but he chose not to be so extreme, wanting to be more communicative to the audience. The movement was presented less aggressively in the film; Jackman's characters are seen in silhouette at the beginning, kept out of key light. In each of the three periods, the lighting on Jackman's characters is initially dim and gradually grows brighter as the storylines unfold. Meanwhile, Weisz's characters are frequently <b>awash</b> <b>with</b> light in the storylines. Libatique described the metaphoric change of the lighting on Jackman's characters, [...] "We follow the arc of the Thomas character as he gets {{closer and closer to the}} truth." ...|$|E
500|$|King Charles II patronised Cresswell's establishments, as he {{did those}} of Madam Damaris Page; he {{declared}} Cresswell's to be [...] "a Sound organisation". She became as well known as the politicians of her time, largely shielded from legal proceedings by her extensive London network of clients across the court, the guilds and government. Her increasing immunity from prosecution furthered her stature as a hate figure, particularly with the many thousands of London apprentices who could not afford her bawds, and bound {{by the terms of}} their contracts, were forbidden to marry. The houses of Cresswell and Page were a target for the 1668 Bawdy House Riots that swept London. Starting on Shrove Tuesday, the rioting lasted for five days, as young apprentices burnt and smashed the royally supported brothels. To some, the brothels symbolised Charles's continental style court: licentious and <b>awash</b> <b>with</b> unaffordable debauchery. The apprentices attacked her [...] "cathouse" [...] in Moorfields, assaulting the women, tearing up the bedding, looting the property and destroying the building.|$|E
5000|$|The 2002 reissue of {{the album}} was {{reviewed}} by Ken Dryden at Allmusic who critiqued the marketing {{of the album}} as a jazz album. Dryden described the music as [...] "very listenable, with a solid performance throughout by Eckstine" [...] though the arrangements he felt were [...] "very predictable, lacking any significant improvising or solos, <b>awash</b> in strings <b>with</b> a rhythm section that seems on autopilot....Billy Eckstine's vocal abilities are never in question, but jazz fans {{need to know what}} to expect prior to purchasing this reissue."

60|$|It was Mark's wish {{to learn}} {{something}} {{of the nature and}} extent of the shoals in this direction. With this object in view, he continued beating up, sometimes passing boldly through shallow water, at others going about to avoid that which he thought might be dangerous, until he believed himself to be about ten miles to windward of the island. The ship's masts were his beacon, for the crater had sunk below the horizon, or if visible at all, it was only at intervals, as the boat was lifted on a swell, when it appeared a low hummock, nearly <b>awash.</b> It was <b>with</b> difficulty that the naked spars could be seen at that distance; nor could they be, except at moments, and that because the compass told the young man exactly where to look for them.|$|R
50|$|An upwind vessel {{is able to}} {{manoeuvre}} at will toward any downwind point, {{since in}} doing so the relative wind moves aft. A vessel downwind of another, however, in attempting to attack upwind, is constrained to trim sail as the relative wind moves forward and cannot point too far into the wind {{for fear of being}} headed. In sailing warfare, when beating to windward, the vessel experiences heeling under the sideward pressure of the wind. This restricts gunnery, as cannon on the windward side are now elevated, while the leeward gun ports aim into the sea, or in heavy weather may be <b>awash.</b> A ship <b>with</b> the weather gage, turning downwind to attack, may alter course at will in order to bring starboard and port guns to appropriate elevations. Ships seeking to evade capture or attack, however, have the advantage being downwind if they are faster vessels or are close to friendly land.|$|R
500|$|Madonna {{performed}} [...] "I Don't Give A" [...] on The MDNA Tour in 2012. The {{performance of}} the song closed the show's first segment known as Transgression, and found Madonna playing the guitar while Minaj appeared on the backdrops sitting on a throne singing her verse. Saeed Saeed of The National praised Madonna for [...] "re-emerging once again triumphant in rock star mode," [...] during the performance Kat Keogh of Birmingham Mail described that [...] "The crowd was <b>awash</b> <b>with</b> a sea of camera phones as Madge grabbed a guitar for Nicki Minaj duet 'I Don’t Give A'." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times was mixed in his review, writing that Madonna [...] "still looks silly when, as she did in 'I Don’t Give A', she slings an electric guitar and makes rocker-chick faces" [...] and found it odd that [...] "someone so physically disciplined can’t fake better guitar moves." [...] The performance was included on Madonna's fourth live album, MDNA World Tour.|$|E

500|$|During {{the winter}} of 1664, a bright comet was {{to be seen in}} the sky and the people of London were fearful, {{wondering}} what evil event it portended. London at that time consisted of a city of about 448 acres surrounded by a city wall, which had originally been built to keep out raiding bands. There were gates at Ludgate, Newgate, Aldersgate, Cripplegate, Moorgate and Bishopsgate and to the south lay the River Thames and London Bridge. In the poorer parts of the city, hygiene was impossible to maintain in the overcrowded tenements and garrets. There was no sanitation, and open drains flowed along the centre of winding streets. The cobbles were slippery with animal dung, rubbish and the slops thrown out of the houses, muddy and buzzing with flies in summer and <b>awash</b> <b>with</b> sewage in winter. The City Corporation employed [...] "rakers" [...] to remove the worst of the filth and it was transported to mounds outside the walls where it accumulated and continued to decompose. The stench was overwhelming and people walked around with handkerchiefs or nosegays pressed against their nostrils.|$|E
500|$|Riou {{gave the}} note to Mr Clements, {{the master of}} the Guardian, who was given command of the launch. A total of 259 people chose to join the five boats, leaving Riou with sixty-two people; himself, three midshipmen, {{including}} Thomas Pitt, the surgeon's mate, the boatswain, carpenter, three superintendents of convicts, a daughter of one of the superintendents, thirty seamen and boys and twenty-one convicts. The Guardian was nearly <b>awash</b> by now <b>with</b> 16 feet of water in the hold, but a bumping noise on the deck attracted attention, and on investigation was found to be a number of casks that had broken free and were floating in the hold, trapped under the lower gundeck. [...] Realising that this was providing extra buoyancy, Riou had the gun deck hatches sealed and caulked, while another sail was sent under the hull to control the flooding. Having now created a substitute hull out of his deck, Riou raised what little sail he could and began the long journey back to land, with the pumps being continuously manned.|$|R
25|$|Train {{stops on}} open {{stretches}} without platform can outnumber train stops in railway stations by a 2:1 margin, but these stopovers on open stretches {{are usually not}} included, when railway stations are counted. There are 25 dedicated railway stations along the railway with 23 having a single platform for passengers to enter or to leave trains. These platforms allow access without having the need to use stairs. Only the Furi-Labu railway station (and the Awash railway station after completed expansion in 2018) have two platforms connected through a footbridge above the overhead catenary system. This footbridge also has elevators at both ends for mobility-reduced passengers. The platforms are roofed to protect passengers against sun, wind and rain. Railway stations for passenger trains always have a station building directly attached {{to the back of}} the principal platform. Consequently, all railway stations with a single platform have space for only one platform line and do not allow the presence of more than one train at the platform at the same time. In contrast, the Furi-Labu and <b>Awash</b> railway stations <b>with</b> their two platforms have the space for two (Furi-Labu) or three (Awash) platform lines. All platforms are around 330 meters long. The Awash railway station plays a special role as it sits at the junction of two railway lines.|$|R
40|$|The chiton Acanthopleura japonica {{has a wide}} {{vertical}} distribution on moderately exposed Hong Kong shores, and it shows limited seasonal vertical migration. Observations revealed that chitons were active while awash on ebbing or flooding tides during both day- and night-time, but they were inactive in refuges at their resting shore heights when conditions were unfavourable. The most intense activity was always associated <b>with</b> <b>awash</b> periods, but the timing of activity peaks and percentage activity varied between seasons, tidal conditions and the shore height individuals occupied. Activity periods were longer in summer than winter, but varied from day to day, depending on weather conditions such as wind speed and hours of sunshine. Duration of activity also varied with shore height; chitons living in the high-shore remaining active for nearly {{twice as long as}} those lower on the shore. Laboratory studies showed that activity was controlled by a circalunidian endogenous rhythm, but can be overridden by exogenous, environmental factors, such as wave splash. Therefore, the temporal organization of activity in A. japonica is controlled by both exogenous and endogenous mechanisms, of which the timing and duration of the awash phase of the tide appears to be the dominant controlling factor. To optimize foraging success, individuals exhibit a continuum of foraging strategies determined by season and the shore height they occupy, resulting in intraspecific variability in the duration and timing of activity. © Inter-Research 2006. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
