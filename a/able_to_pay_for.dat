5|$|Although kings, {{rulers and}} {{powerful}} {{people have always}} been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> entertainment {{to be provided for}} them and in many cases have paid for public entertainment, people generally have made their own entertainment or when possible, attended a live performance. Technological developments in the 20th century meant that entertainment could be produced independently of the audience, packaged and sold on a commercial basis by an entertainment industry. Sometimes referred to as show business, the industry relies on business models to produce, market, broadcast or otherwise distribute many of its traditional forms, including performances of all types. The industry became so sophisticated that its economics became a separate area of academic study.|$|E
5|$|Lhermitte {{filed for}} and {{received}} a judgment of divorce before her trial; Moqadem at first appealed the decision but later withdrew his objection. Following the trial, Lhermitte was not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> the trial costs, so under Belgian law it fell to her now ex-husband {{to pick up the}} bill. This conformed to the Law of Belgium, with the state seeking funds due to have been shared from the sale of their house under their divorce agreement. The overall court expenses and fines were 72,743 euros (about $93,000). Moqadem said he was “disgusted and revolted” by the injustice of this billing system. Moqadem’s attorney attempted to have the bill written off, calling for “administrative requirements to be balanced by decency” given the nature of the tragedy.|$|E
25|$|Birmingham {{had been}} {{provided}} with swimming baths {{for some time}} before {{the establishment of the}} Birmingham Baths Committee, which became possible through the introduction of an Act of Parliament. These baths were private and members were often only the wealthy who were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> the service.|$|E

50|$|As Smith’s {{father did}} not approve of his musical {{interests}} as a child, his first job was mowing a neighbor’s lawn every week in order <b>to</b> be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> afford <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> piano lessons on his own.|$|R

25|$|Electric {{lighting}} {{was highly}} desirable. The light was much brighter than oil or gas lamps, {{and there was}} no soot. Although early electricity was very expensive compared to today, it was far cheaper and more convenient than oil or gas lighting. Electric lighting was so much safer than oil or gas that some companies were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> the electricity with the insurance savings.|$|E
25|$|This {{prosperity}} continued up to 1955 {{at which}} point Britain stopped giving New Zealand guaranteed prices for its exports. From then on, what New Zealand received was dictated by the free market. As a result, during the 1950s and 1960s the country's standard of living began to slip as the export sector was no longer <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> the level of imported goods required to meet the country's growing consumerism.|$|E
25|$|The {{plan was}} for {{education}} of children in three successive stages corresponding with three types of schools: primary schools, which all children, regardless of their parents' financial ability, {{would be able to}} attend for at least three years; intermediate schools, for students who excelled in primary school, as well as for children whose parents are willing and <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> it; and the university, for students whose parents were willing to pay.|$|E
50|$|Other purchasers of land {{during the}} Crown Land Sales at Soldiers Hill {{during this time}} were {{generally}} quite eminent Ballarat citizens, so {{it seems reasonable to}} assume that “J.Taylor” was also. <b>To</b> be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> £90 <b>for</b> the purchase of land was a significant amount at this time.|$|R
50|$|Arcandor {{requested}} {{financial assistance}} from the German government, which {{was rejected by the}} European Commission on 3 June 2009. On 6 June 2009, the company announced it was no longer <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> rent <b>for</b> its department stores, which the company had previously sold and leasebacked. Three days later, the company filed for bankruptcy.|$|R

He lodged at Mrs. Lee's, and was, in a manner, free of Miss Mohun's house; but {{he spent much of}} his leisure time in study, being now <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> {{regularly}} <b>for</b> instruction from the tutor who taught at Mrs. Edgar's school.|$|R
25|$|Following Bale's {{two goals}} against Norwich City on 27 December 2011, manager Harry Redknapp said:If we sell him, we've had it haven't we? It {{would only be}} a Barcelona, a Man City or a Real Madrid who would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> him. He's an amazing player. He's got everything, there's not a {{weakness}} in his make-up. He can head the ball, he's as strong as an ox, he can run, dribble and shoot. Most important of all, he's a smashing lad.|$|E
25|$|On July 28, 1893, the Melrose Hospital Association was {{established}} with forty-eight corporate {{members at the}} home of Decius Beebe on West Foster Street in Melrose, Massachusetts. The bylaws of the Association stated that the purpose for which the Association is constituted is to establish and maintain a hospital for the treatment and care of needy, sick and disabled persons of both sexes, and also of persons who may be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> such treatment in whole or in part; such receipts {{to be used in the}} partial support of the hospital.|$|E
25|$|A 1GB {{portion of}} Half-Life 2 became {{available}} for pre-load through Steam on August 26, 2004. This meant that customers {{could begin to}} download encrypted game files to their computer before the game was released. When the game's release date arrived, customers were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> the game through Steam, unlock the files on their hard drives and play the game immediately, without having {{to wait for the}} entire game to download. The pre-load period lasted for several weeks, with several subsequent portions of the game being made available, to ensure all customers had a chance to download the content before the game was released.|$|E

50|$|The {{deceased}} {{were buried}} with an obol {{placed in the}} mouth of the corpse, so that—once a deceased's shade reached Hades—he or she would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> Charon <b>for</b> passage across the river Acheron or Styx. Legend had it that those without enough wealth or whose friends refused to follow proper burial rites were forced to wander the banks of the river for one hundred years.|$|R
25|$|The {{change was}} publicized {{as a way}} to {{increase}} the ability for missionaries to serve. At the time, missionaries paid for all their expenses in their country of service. Recession during the Carter presidency pushed inflation higher and the exchange rate lower. This sudden increase in costs together with already high costs of living in Europe and other industrialized nations resulted in a steady {{decline in the number of}} missionaries <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> two full years of service. The shortening of the required service time from 24 to 18 months cut off this decline in numbers, leveling out in the period following the reinstatement. For those in foreign missions, this was barely enough time to learn a more difficult language and difficulty with language was reported.|$|E
25|$|In {{the land}} {{boom of the}} 1920s, the Wallace Apartments were {{converted}} into the Edwards-Maxwell Hospital, the first hospital in Broward County. Soon, the land boom busted, followed by the September 1926 hurricane, {{one of the worst}} in county history. Due to lack of patients <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> care, the hospital was forced to close in 1929. It was reopened by Juanita Clay in 1932 and remained successful until it was purchased in 1937 by Medical Services, Inc., an insurance company owned by Dr. F.A. Brunson and M.L. Menger. Medical Services issued hospital and family insurance policies that required the use of their own hospital and doctors. The Broward County medical community rebelled, refusing to use the Medical Services hospital.|$|E
25|$|The {{project was}} {{approved}} by the government in May 1988. The first center, in Mo i Rana, opened on 31 January 1989 and was opened by Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland and Kristensen. The centers were established under the presumption that they would be fully occupied with publicly financed projects, but in reality they were forced to attempt to find various private projects and all had too much capacity. They thus became a financial failure because they had massive overcapacity in computing power and few project which were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> the costs. By 1991, one of the centers was bankrupt and the rest were struggling financially. The only center with success was the one in Tromsø, which was used for Tromsø Satellite Station.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the liberation}} of Lesko, and when the Jews had regained enough {{strength}} to leave, they left and excused themselves <b>for</b> not being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> him <b>for</b> his trouble and expenses. Zwonarz responded by giving them his last items of worth, a wristwatch and a $10 bill, saying: [...] "Take this, it's all I have. You'll need it {{to start a new}} life." ...|$|R

25|$|Despite going {{days without}} eating, {{and having to}} sleep on the wrestling mats at the gym, he refused to turn professional, {{partially}} to preserve his amateur status and he also did not want his mother to discover he was earning a living as a boxer. When friends who knew him from his gym work, and seeing him struggle to pay for a decent meal, asked why he didn't take up the nightly paid 'private' fights, Welsh initially refused. Despite his misgivings, the next day Welsh took up the offer and knocked out Kid Allen in a third round bout. This was followed with wins over Johnny Mezier, Young Peterson and Jack Cameron. With his financial issues resolved and being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> steady meals, at the age of nineteen, Welsh decided to turn professional.|$|E
25|$|The {{university}} {{grew at a}} {{rapid rate}} throughout the 1960s, with three colleges and many other buildings on campus being completed {{by the end of}} the decade. The 1970s saw further construction, but the university also encountered the biggest physical problem in its history. The university had been built above a tunnel on the disused Canterbury and Whitstable Railway. In July 1974 the tunnel collapsed, damaging part of the Cornwallis Building, which sank nearly a metre within about an hour on the evening of 11 July. Fortunately, the university had insurance against subsidence, so it was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> the south-west corner of the building to be demolished and replaced by a new wing at the other end of the building. Building elsewhere included the Park Wood accommodation village and the Darwin houses in 1989.|$|E
25|$|In Britain, the {{nationalisation}} {{was perceived}} as {{a direct threat to}} British interests. In a letter to the British Ambassador on 10 September 1956, Sir Ivone Kirkpatrick, the Permanent Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office wrote: If we sit back while Nasser consolidates his position and gradually acquires control of the oil-bearing countries, he can and is, according to our information, resolved to wreck us. If Middle Eastern oil is denied to us for a year or two, our gold reserves will disappear. If our gold reserves disappear, the sterling area disintegrates. If the sterling area disintegrates and we have no reserves, we shall not be able to maintain a force in Germany, or indeed, anywhere else. I doubt whether we shall be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> the bare minimum necessary for our defence. And a country that cannot provide for its defence is finished.|$|E
50|$|The Tahirih Justice Center {{deals with}} a number of human rights issues related to women and girls. The {{organization}} focuses on cases that fall within the scope of its mission and goals. In particular, accepted requests must involve the protection of women from persecution, although men may be eligible for assistance to protect their female family members from abuse. Women who wish to receive Tahirih's services free of charge must demonstrate that they are not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> afford <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> such services. When requests for assistance fall outside Tahirih's scope, staff members attempt to locate other legal service providers who can offer the prospective client assistance.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to his positions in the media, Nash was also a publican, which proved so financially successfully he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> cash <b>for</b> {{a house in the}} upmarket Melbourne suburb of South Yarra. An altercation with a drunken patron resulted in a broken left hip and forced Nash to sell his hotel, the Prince Alfred in Port Melbourne and gain employment as a clerk in the Melbourne Magistrates Court, a position he held until his mandatory retirement at 65.|$|R
25|$|Large loss: The size of {{the loss}} must be {{meaningful}} {{from the perspective of}} the insured. Insurance premiums need to cover both the expected cost of losses, plus the cost of issuing and administering the policy, adjusting losses, and supplying the capital needed to reasonably assure that the insurer will be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> claims. <b>For</b> small losses, these latter costs may be several times the {{size of the}} expected cost of losses. There is hardly any point in paying such costs unless the protection offered has real value to a buyer.|$|R
500|$|In a 1991 interview, Zappa {{reported}} {{that he was a}} registered Democrat but added [...] "that might not last long—I'm going to shred that". Describing his political views, Zappa categorized himself as a [...] "practical conservative". He favored limited government and low taxes; he also stated that he approved of national defense, social security, and other federal programs, but only if recipients of such programs are willing and <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> them. He favored capitalism, entrepreneurship, and independent business, stating that musicians could make more from owning their own businesses than from collecting royalties. He opposed communism, stating, [...] "A system that doesn't allow ownership... has—to put it mildly—a fatal design flaw." [...] He had always encouraged his fans to register to vote on album covers, and throughout 1988 he had registration booths at his concerts. He even considered running for president of the United States as an independent.|$|E
500|$|A 1993 Parliamentarians for Global Action {{survey showed}} that a strong {{majority}} of parliamentary respondents thought that the public would {{support the idea of}} a UN Parliamentary Assembly, but they were less sure the public would be prepared to finance it. The analysis pointed out, [...] "The possibility of a greater financial burden to support an enlarged UN is unlikely to evoke support unless it can be demonstrated that the return on investment is significant. Citizens are often known to express lofty globalist sentiments when questioned on general principles, and to surrender them when costs or trade offs are concerned." [...] A 1995 United Nations University report claimed, [...] "it is difficult to see how the Parliamentary Assembly would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> the salaries and travel of what could be over 1,000 representatives; this proposal could increase the duplication and waste that already exist within multilateral bodies." ...|$|E
500|$|The South {{and most}} of the West were deemed certain to vote for Bryan. When early-voting Maine and Vermont went {{strongly}} Republican in September, this meant that McKinley would most likely win the Northeast. [...] These results made the Midwest the crucial battlefield that would decide the presidency. [...] Bryan spent most of October there—160 of his final 250 train stops were in the Midwest. [...] Early Republican polls had shown Bryan ahead in crucial Midwestern states, including McKinley's Ohio. [...] Much of the blizzard of paper the Republican campaign was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> concentrated on this area/ By September, this had its effect as silver sentiment began to fade. [...] Morgan noted, [...] "full organization, [...] party harmony, a campaign of education with the printed and spoken word would more than counteract" [...] Bryan's speechmaking. [...] Beginning in September, the Republicans concentrated on the tariff question, and as Election Day, November 3, approached, they were confident of victory.|$|E
25|$|Many renters {{retained}} {{ties to the}} estates, diversifying their household's {{sources of}} income and level of economic security. In San Luis Potosí, rentals were fewer and estate employment the norm. After {{a number of years}} of drought and bad harvests {{in the first decade of}} the nineteenth century Hidalgo's 1810 grito appealed more in the Bajío than in San Luis Potosí. In the Bajío estate owners were evicting tenants in favor of renters better <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> more <b>for</b> land, there was a disruption of previous patterns of mutual benefit between estate owners and renters.|$|R
