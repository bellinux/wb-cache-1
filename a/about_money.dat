5|$|Culverhouse's {{relationships}} with other NFL owners were occasionally, as in {{his relationship with the}} Rams, alleged to constitute conflicts of interest. His $3 million loan to help Philadelphia Eagles owner Leonard Tose with his gambling debts was one example, as it violated the NFL constitution and bylaws. On other occasions, he was criticized for his overly-secretive ways as NFL Finance Committee Chairman, as other league owners found it difficult to obtain information on how league finances were being spent. In particular, owners were upset about not being informed <b>about</b> <b>money</b> given to NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle in a 5-year extension of his contract. The extension was awarded to him by the Finance Committee as a reward for negotiation of the league television contract in 1982, even though Rozelle had five years remaining on his current contract.|$|E
5|$|Money is {{important}} throughout the film. Concerns <b>about</b> <b>money</b> dominate {{much of the}} film—for example, a large portion is devoted to Wei and her students' attempt to earn enough money for bus tickets—as well as motivating them.

Zhu Ying points out the prominence of money in the film creates a conflict between traditional Confucian values (such as the implication that the solutions to Wei's problems can be found through the help of authority figures) and modern, capitalist and individualistic society.|$|E

Inside, Si, Sally and Graham argue about how to split the money they will make from the balloon. The {{argument}} gets heated after Sally argues that the fact Tamsin will soon die should preclude her from getting a share. As Graham threatens to pop the balloon, Jan reappears and chastises him. Tamsin, who is now considered neutral, takes the balloon. Graham says they should all settle down and have lunch.
