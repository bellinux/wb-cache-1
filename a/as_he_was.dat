Thus did Cardinal Pole arrive to become Archbishop of Canterbury in Cranmer's place. Mary could have had Cranmer imprisoned <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> tried and executed for treason—he had supported the claims of Lady Jane Grey—but she resolved to have him tried for heresy. His recantations of his Protestantism {{would have been a}} major coup. Unhappily for her, he unexpectedly withdrew his recantations at the last minute <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> to be burned at the stake, thus ruining her government's propaganda victory.|$|E
