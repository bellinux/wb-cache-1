2500|$|On January 24, 2002, Agere Systems {{announced}} that it would be closing the [...] Reading Works in 12 to 18 months. The planned changes involved closing the Breinigsville, Pennsylvania plant in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, which was opened in 1988; selling the Orlando plant in Florida; and consolidating several locations in New Jersey. All operations were consolidated at the Allentown, Pennsylvania, headquarters location and the New Jersey locations. About 1,500 workers were transferred from Reading to Allentown where 3,200 workers were employed prior to the relocation. As Agere was leaving, Legerity, Inc., assumed some of the operations formerly done by the Muhlenberg plant in the old Building 10 on North 13th Street. In this facility Legerity assembled 40 former Agere circuit-design, physical-design, application-design and process development engineers to support the <b>analog</b> <b>line</b> card integrated circuit business it purchased from Agere. Legerity is a design facility that uses other companies foundries to manufacture its products. In May 2003, Agere Systems Inc. ended all manufacturing and began decommissioning its Muhlenberg Township plant. The last 346 manufacturing employees were laid off. About 50 employees — mostly maintenance — remained at the plant until a buyer was found.|$|E

50|$|In Germany, ISDN {{was very}} popular with an {{installed}} base of 25 million channels (29% of all subscriber lines in Germany as of 2003 and 20% of all ISDN channels worldwide). Due {{to the success of}} ISDN, the number of installed <b>analog</b> <b>lines</b> was decreasing. Deutsche Telekom (DTAG) offered both BRI and PRI. Competing phone companies often offered ISDN only and no <b>analog</b> <b>lines.</b> However, these operators generally offered free hardware that also allows the use of POTS equipment, such as NTBAs with integrated terminal adapters. Because of the widespread availability of ADSL services, ISDN was primarily used for voice and fax traffic.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Analog</b> delay <b>lines</b> {{are applied}} in {{many types of}} signal {{processing}} circuits; for example the PAL television standard uses an <b>analog</b> delay <b>line</b> to store an entire video scanline. Acoustic and electromechanical delay lines are used to provide a [...] "reverberation" [...] effect in musical instrument amplifiers, or to simulate an echo. High-speed oscilloscopes used an <b>analog</b> delay <b>line</b> to allow observation of waveforms just before some triggering event.|$|R
50|$|Until 2007 ISDN (BRI) and ADSL/VDSL {{were often}} bundled {{on the same}} line, mainly because the {{combination}} of ADSL with an <b>analog</b> <b>line</b> had no cost advantage over a combined ISDN-ADSL line. This advantage diminished when vendors of ISDN technology stopped manufacturing it and spare parts became hard to come by. Since then phone companies started introducing cheaper ADSL-only products using VoIP for telephony.|$|E

50|$|IXCs {{originally}} carried {{voice traffic}} on <b>analog</b> <b>lines,</b> but voice traffic {{has since become}} largely digitized. Therefore, voice traffic is more typically a data stream and can be intermixed with data traffic such as uplinks for DSL. Most commonly, links between IXCs and COs are ATM links carried on optical fiber.|$|R
50|$|Despite being {{inherently}} four-wire, VoIP systems require hybrids {{when they}} interface to two-wire lines. A VoIP-to-Telco gateway used to interface a VoIP PBX (private branch exchange) to <b>analog</b> <b>lines</b> would contain hybrids {{to perform the}} required conversion. End-end VoIP needs no hybrids unless adaptation to a two-wire line is required.|$|R
50|$|DLU handles <b>analog</b> and ISDN <b>lines</b> and {{includes}} codecs for <b>analog</b> <b>lines,</b> {{one of the}} BORSCHT functions for subscriber lines. Digital signals are assigned a time slot. DLU concentrates traffic onto an LTG-B unit, as well as Primary Rate ISDN and V5.2 connections. Supervision and address signalling (dial pulse, DTMF) are also integrated in the DLU. For PCM30 (E-1) connections to other exchanges, LTG-C Units are used, which also handle signalling including SS7, MFC R2 signalling, IKZ (dial pulse), and E&M.|$|R
5000|$|DSP hybrids {{are also}} called [...] "line echo cancellers" [...] (LECs). (The phrase [...] "echo canceller" [...] {{in this context}} is {{misleading}} since there is no cancellation of echo per se but rather of leakage from the <b>analog</b> <b>line</b> interface with very short time delay more accurately characterized as phase-shift. However, any uncancelled hybrid leakage will cause echo when the associated transmission path has delay, so the effect on the system is reduction of echo.) ...|$|E
50|$|The TCU was {{responsible}} {{for a group of}} Facility Interface Units (FIUs). Each FIU {{was responsible}} for connecting the system to a particular class of physical connection: analog lines in the <b>Analog</b> <b>Line</b> FIU (and its successor, the Extended Line FIU); analog trunks in the Analog Trunk FIU; and digital carrier in the Digital Trunk FIU and its successor, the EDT FIU. Unlike the SM in the competitive 5ESS Switch, the TCUs did not perform all call processing functions, but limited themselves to digit collection and signalling interpretation.|$|E

However, as of December 2012, there is limited support for emergency calls in the United Kingdom, Australia, Denmark, and Finland. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has ruled that, {{for the purposes of}} section 255 of the Telecommunications Act, Skype is not an [...] "interconnected VoIP provider".

50|$|POTS codecs, ISDN codecs, and IP codecs {{are used}} for remote {{broadcasts}} when {{it is possible to}} have specialized equipment {{at both ends of the}} connection. POTS codecs work with <b>analog</b> <b>lines,</b> ISDN codecs with ISDN lines, and IP codecs with any link that can provide IP connectivity. These employ audio data compression and decompression at each end. Audio bandwidths up to 20 kHz can be achieved this way. Compression is often via MPEG MP3 or AAC.|$|R
50|$|The {{digital signal}} {{processing}} technology used in modern hybrids addresses the isolation requirement and implements ancillary functions.ISDN and VoIP telco connections theoretically have no need for hybrids. However, calls that have ISDN or VoIP on one end usually terminate to an <b>analog</b> <b>line</b> at the other, {{and so there is}} a significant source of echo from both the telco hybrid on the line card and the phone itself. Acoustic coupling, when the microphone picks up the output of the earpiece, is another potential source of echo. Electrical pickup between analog circuits (crosstalk) is yet another. Even low echo levels can be audible when there is a long delay, as is usually the case with VoIP.|$|E
50|$|Framebuffers differ {{significantly}} from the vector displays that were common prior to the advent of faster graphics (and, consequently, {{to the concept of}} a framebuffer). With a vector display, only the vertices of the graphics primitives are stored. The electron beam of the output display is then commanded to move from vertex to vertex, tracing an <b>analog</b> <b>line</b> across the area between these points. With a framebuffer, the electron beam (if the display technology uses one) is commanded to trace a left-to-right, top-to-bottom path across the entire screen, the way a television renders a broadcast signal. The color information for each point thus displayed on the screen is pulled from the framebuffer, creating a set of discrete picture elements, i.e. pixels.|$|E
50|$|Designers of secure systems often {{forget to}} take {{information}} leakage into account. A {{classic example of}} this is when the French government designed a mechanism to aid encrypted communications over an <b>analog</b> <b>line,</b> such as at a phone booth. It was a device that clamped onto both ends of the phone, performed the encrypting operations, and sent the signals over the phone line. Unfortunately for the French, the rubber seal that attached the device to the phone was not airtight. It was later discovered that although the encryption itself was solid, if heard carefully, one could hear the speaker, since the phone was picking up some of the speech. Information leakage can subtly or completely destroy the security of an otherwise secure system.|$|E

5000|$|The GTD-5 EAX ran on a Time-Space-Time (TST) topology. Each TCU {{contained}} two timeswitches (TSWs) with a {{total capacity}} of 1544 timeslots: 772 in the originating time switch and 772 in the terminating time switch. Four FIUs of 193 timeslots each were connected to the TSW. Trunking FIUs connected 192 timeslots of facility (eight DS1 carriers or 192 individual analog trunks). The original <b>Analog</b> <b>Line</b> FIU had a 768 line capacity with one codec per line. The digital output of the 768 codecs was concentrated to 192 timeslots before presentation to the timeswitch, a 4:1 concentration. In the later 1980s, higher capacity line frames of 1172 and 1536 lines became available, allowing for higher concentration ratios of 6:1 and 8:1.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{consumer}} PBX systems used analog (POTS) telephone lines, typically supporting four private analog and one public <b>analog</b> <b>line.</b> They {{were the}} size of a small cigar box. In Europe these systems for analog phones were followed by consumer-grade PBXs for ISDN. Using small PBXs for ISDN is a logical step, since the ISDN basic rate interface provides two logical phone lines (via two ISDN B channels) which can be used in parallel. With the adoption of VoIP by consumers, consumer VoIP PBXs have appeared, with PBX functions becoming simple additional software features of consumer-grade routers and switches. Additionally, many telecommunications providers now offer hosted PBX systems where the provider actually hosts the PBX and the phone handsets are connected to it through an internet connection.|$|E
50|$|In {{the diagram}} above, {{there is a}} sample-rate clock in the fax {{terminal}} {{and one in the}} gateway’s modems that is used to trigger the sampling of the <b>analog</b> <b>line</b> 8,000 times per second. These clocks are usually quite accurate, but in some low-cost terminal adapters (a one or two-line gateway) the PCM clock can be surprisingly inaccurate. If the terminal is sending data to the gateway, and the gateway’s clock is too slow, the buffers (jitter buffers) in the gateway will eventually overflow, causing the transaction to fail. Since the difference is often quite small, this problem occurs on long, detailed fax images giving the clocks more time to cause the jitter buffer in the gateway to either underflow or overflow, which is just the same as missing or duplicated packets.|$|E

50|$|<b>Analog</b> <b>lines</b> are {{terminated}} {{on individual}} line cards, {{each with its}} own codec, in pull-out Line Drawers in frames. The original design of such frames was called the Line Module (LM) with 32 lines per drawer. LMs were not able to send caller-id information (CLASS services) and became rare late in the century, having been supplemented or replaced by the newer Line Concentrating Module (LCM). Duplicated ringing generators serve each LM or pair of LCM. For DC testing, each line card has a relay to connect it to a test bus.|$|R
