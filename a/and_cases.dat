Its large size {{and the quality of}} its meat means that the coconut crab is {{extensively}} hunted and is very rare on islands with a human population. The coconut crab is eaten by Southeast Asians and Pacific Islanders and is considered a delicacy and an aphrodisiac, and intensive hunting has threatened the species' survival in some areas. While the coconut crab itself is not innately poisonous, it may become so depending on its diet, <b>and</b> <b>cases</b> of coconut crab poisoning have occurred. For instance, consumption of the sea mango Cerbera manghas by the coconut crab may make the coconut crab toxic due to the presence of cardiac cardenolides.|$|E

5|$|In Eurasia, many {{gray wolf}} populations {{are forced to}} subsist largely on {{livestock}} and garbage in areas with dense human activity, though wild ungulates such as moose, red deer, roe deer and wild boar are still the most important food sources in Russia and the more mountainous regions of Eastern Europe.

The prey animals of North American wolves have largely continued to occupy suitable habitats with low human density, <b>and</b> <b>cases</b> of wolves subsisting largely on garbage or livestock are exceptional.

5|$|Many human {{medicines}} {{should never}} be given to cats. For example, the painkiller paracetamol (or acetaminophen, sold as Tylenol and Panadol) is extremely toxic to cats: even very small doses need immediate treatment and can be fatal. Even aspirin, which is sometimes used to treat arthritis in cats, is much more toxic to them than to humans and must be administered cautiously. Similarly, application of minoxidil (Rogaine) to the skin of cats, either accidentally or by well-meaning guardians attempting to counter loss of fur, has sometimes been fatal. Essential oils can be toxic to cats <b>and</b> <b>cases</b> have been reported of serious illnesses caused by tea tree oil, including flea treatments and shampoos containing it.|$|E
5|$|Peter Cane has {{distinguished}} between {{cases where the}} courts have found that an applicant has standing to represent identifiable individuals (associational standing), <b>and</b> <b>cases</b> where the applicant purports to represent the public interest (public interest standing). Under this analysis, ex parte Greenpeace may be regarded {{as an example of}} the former, and ex parte World Development Movement the latter. In 1994, the Law Commission recommended that there should be a two-track system for standing. An applicant should have standing in one of two situations: either in his or her personal capacity, in which case a remedy lies ex debito justitae ("from a debt of justice", that is, as a matter of right); or at the discretion of the court if it considers that it is in the public interest to accord standing.|$|E

Minton stated on several occasions his personal preference to affirm the decisions of the lower courts.

In the present article, the author has considered the three-factor experimental design with repeated measures on one factor. Having decided, for example, that the repeated factor is Factor C, and the non-repeated factors are Factor A and Factor B, there are six cases which are described as follows: Case 1 : Factor A, Factor B, and Factor C are all fixed. Case 2 : Factor A and Factor B are both fixed, but Factor C is random. Case 3 : Factor A is random, but Factor B and Factor C are both fixed. Case 4 : Factor A and Factor C are both random, but Factor B is fixed. Case 5 : Factor A and Factor B are both random, but Factor C is fixed. Case 6 : Factor A, Factor B, and Factor C are all random.

5|$|A major {{reform to}} the Court {{happened}} {{soon after the}} restoration, {{with the introduction of}} a right of appeal to the House of Lords from the Chancery. Before this there had been no records of appeals to the Lords, and a committee had concluded that there was no precedent to give the Lords jurisdiction over equity matters, except when problems <b>and</b> <b>cases</b> were sent directly to Parliament (as occasionally had been the case). In 1660 the Convention Parliament claimed for itself the right of appellate jurisdiction over equity matters, and also the right of original jurisdiction to hear equity cases at first instance. After disputes which lasted into the next Parliament, this second measure was dropped, but the right to hear equity appeals was confirmed. Horowitz writes that despite these changes, one of the academic certainties is that the problems which had dogged the court for the last two centuries persisted; Observations on the Dilatory and Expensive Proceedings in the Court of Chancery, written in 1701, listed 25 different procedures, areas and situations which contributed to the problems of high fees and slow processes.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{only about}} 4% of {{patients}} with photosensitive disorders are reported to {{have been diagnosed with}} solar urticaria. Internationally, the number is slightly larger at 5.3%.

5|$|In {{veterinary}} practice, {{dogs are}} the species most commonly affected by hypothyroidism. The {{majority of cases}} occur {{as a result of}} primary hypothyroidism, of which two types are recognized: lymphocytic thyroiditis, which is probably immune-driven and leads to destruction and fibrosis of the thyroid gland, and idiopathic atrophy, which leads to the gradual replacement of the gland by fatty tissue. There is often lethargy, cold intolerance, exercise intolerance, and weight gain. Furthermore, skin changes and fertility problems are seen in dogs with hypothyroidism, {{as well as a number}} of other symptoms. The signs of myxedema can be seen in dogs, with prominence of skin folds on the forehead, <b>and</b> <b>cases</b> of myxedema coma are encountered. The diagnosis can be confirmed by blood test, as the clinical impression alone may lead to overdiagnosis. Lymphocytic thyroiditis is associated with detectable antibodies against thyroglobulin, although they typically become undetectable in advanced disease. Treatment is with thyroid hormone replacement.|$|E
