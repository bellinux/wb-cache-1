5|$|Every test session {{began at}} 9a.m. EST, stopped at 12:00– 1:00p.m. EST, and {{concluded}} at 5:00p.m. EST. During {{the first session}} {{on the morning of}} January 20, 2011, thirty-three drivers participated, and Clint Bowyer was quickest with <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> of 184.216mph while David Reutimann had the highest speed of 195.780mph during the second session in the afternoon. The third test session, scheduled for the morning of January 21, was canceled because of wet weather. During the fourth session, held during the afternoon, 34 drivers participated with Denny Hamlin being quickest with <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> of 196.868mph. Several drivers decided to leave after the session, which included Reutimann, Martin Truex, Jr., Jimmie Johnson, and Bowyer. During the fifth session, held on the morning of January 22, 29 drivers participated, and Joey Logano was quickest with <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> of 197.516mph. Brad Keselowski was quickest with <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> of 198.605mph in the final session.|$|E
5|$|Betelgeuse is {{travelling}} supersonically {{through the}} interstellar medium at <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> of 30km per second (i.e. ~6.3AU per year) creating a bow shock. The shock is not created by the star, but by its powerful stellar wind as it ejects vast amounts of gas into {{the interstellar medium}} at <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> of 17km/s, heating the material surrounding the star, thereby making it visible in infrared light. Because Betelgeuse is so bright, {{it was only in}} 1997 that the bow shock was first imaged. The cometary structure is estimated to be at least 1 parsec wide, assuming a distance of 643 light-years.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{magnetic}} field, predominantly dipolar at its surface, is distorted {{further out}} by the solar wind. This is a stream of charged particles leaving the Sun's corona and accelerating to <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> of 200 to 1000kilometres per second. They carry with them a magnetic field, the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF).|$|E

5|$|Henry Kolm went on {{to start}} Magplane Technology in the 1990s to develop the {{magnetic}} transportation technology that O'Neill had written about. In 2007, Magplane demonstrated a working magnetic pipeline system to transport phosphate ore in Florida. The system ran at <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> of 40mph (65km/h), far slower than the high-speed trains O'Neill envisioned.|$|E
5|$|In 2013 Voyager 1 was {{exiting the}} solar system at <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> of about 3.6 AU per year, while Voyager 2 is going slower, leaving {{the solar system}} at 3.3 AU per year. Each year Voyager 1 {{increases}} its lead over Voyager 2.|$|E
5|$|Some seamounts {{have not}} been mapped and thus pose a navigational danger. For instance, Muirfield Seamount is named after the ship that hit it in 1973. More recently, the {{submarine}} USS San Francisco ran into an uncharted seamount in 2005 at <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> of , sustaining serious damage and killing one seaman.|$|E

5|$|The Queen Elizabeth-class {{ships were}} {{designed}} to form a fast squadron for the fleet that was intended to operate against the leading ships of the opposing battleline. This required maximum offensive power and <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> several knots faster than any other battleship {{to allow them to}} defeat any type of ship.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships were}} also armed with {{submerged}} torpedo tubes in their hulls. Derfflinger {{was equipped with}} four 50cm tubes; the later ships were armed with more powerful 60cm weapons. The tubes were arranged with one in the bow, one in the stern, and two on the broadside. Derfflingers 50cm torpedoes were the G7 type, 7.02m (276in) long and armed with a 195kg (430lb) Hexanite warhead. The torpedo had a range of 4,000m (4,370yd) when set at <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> of 37knots, and up to 9,300m (10,170yd) at 27 knots. The 60cm torpedoes were the H8 type, which were 8m long and carried a 210kg (463lb) Hexanite warhead. The torpedoes had a range of 6,000m (6,550yd) when set at <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> of 36knots; at a reduced speed of 30knots, the range increased significantly to 14,000m (15,310yd).|$|E

5|$|All tiger sharks {{generally}} swim slowly, which, {{combined with}} cryptic coloration, may make them difficult for prey to detect in some habitats. They are especially well camouflaged against dark backgrounds. Despite their sluggish appearance, tiger sharks {{are one of}} the strongest swimmers of the carcharhinid sharks. Once the shark has come close, <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> burst allows it to reach the intended prey before it can escape.|$|E
5|$|As enemies {{accumulate}} in the arena, {{the amount of}} safe space decreases. This, alongside the enemies' aggressive behaviour, encourages constant player movement and spatial awareness. The player character can move at high speed and jump to perform evasive manoeuvres. The game employs advanced movement techniques to increase player speed and jump height. The player can gain <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> boost by strafing while jumping. The shotgun-like blast can supplement the jumping mechanism; the player can be propelled further and perform a double jump by firing downwards while still in the air.|$|E
5|$|Dan Albone {{constructed}} the first commercially successful gasoline-powered {{general purpose tractor}} in 1901, and the 1923 International Harvester Farmall tractor marked a major point in the replacement of draft animals (particularly horses) with machines. Since that time, self-propelled mechanical harvesters (combines), planters, transplanters and other equipment have been developed, further revolutionizing agriculture. These inventions allowed farming tasks {{to be done with}} <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> and on a scale previously impossible, leading modern farms to output much greater volumes of high-quality produce per land unit.|$|E

5|$|Danner's {{physical}} strength extends to his legs, {{allowing him to}} leap great heights and distances. At age 10 he can leap 40 {{feet into the air}} and run faster than a train. During his freshman year in college, he easily breaks a world track record, though he actually doesn't run at his full speed. While {{in the service of the}} French Foreign Legion in World War I, he traverses thirty-seven miles round trip in just thirty minutes (<b>a</b> <b>speed</b> of about 148mph); all while carrying 2,000 pounds of food, water, and ammunition for his unit. Despite his great strength, he is still susceptible to fatigue.|$|E
5|$|Folding@home {{is one of}} the world's fastest {{computing}} systems, with <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> {{of approximately}} 70 petaFLOPS. This performance from its large-scale computing network has allowed researchers to run computationally costly atomic-level simulations of protein folding thousands of times longer than formerly achieved. Since its launch on October1, 2000, the Pande Lab has produced 139 scientific research papers {{as a direct result of}} Folding@home. Results from the project's simulations agree well with experiments.|$|E
5|$|Frahm {{anti-roll}} {{tanks were}} fitted during construction, but these {{proved to be}} ineffective; the tanks only reduced rolling by 33%. Bilge keels were later added to improve stability, and the space previously used for the anti-roll tanks was instead used as extra fuel storage. The ship was able to carry an additional 180 t(200 short tons) of coal in the anti-roll tanks. Von der Tanns hull consisted of 15 watertight compartments, and a double bottom extended for 75% of the ship's length. The ship was known to have good maneuvering characteristics, with <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> loss of 60% and a heel of 8degrees at full rudder.|$|E

5|$|Heat {{levels on}} the speeder must be monitored, as {{although}} there are no set top speeds for the vehicles, they can explode if allowed to overheat. Heat builds up from acceleration and from collisions. To counteract this, the player may activate the onboard cooler, however, this will slow the vehicle down. Designated cooling strips along the track and the Ice power-up can cool the vehicle without <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> penalty, allowing the player to continue accelerating.|$|E
5|$|INS Shakti can refuel four ships at a time, with a {{fuelling}} {{speed of}} 1,500 tonnes per hour while her predecessors had <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> of 300 per hour.

5|$|In 1994, RA85656, a Tupolev Tu-154 {{operating}} as Baikal Airlines Flight 130, crashed near Irkutsk shortly after departing from Irkutsk Airport, Russia. Damage to the starter caused {{a fire in}} engine number two (located in the rear fuselage). High temperatures during the fire destroyed the tanks and pipes of all three hydraulic systems. The crew {{lost control of the}} aircraft. The unmanageable plane, at <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> of 275 knots, hit the ground at a dairy farm and burned. All passengers and crew, as well as a dairyman on the ground, died.|$|E
