500|$|A {{common problem}} with the scripts, {{according}} to Novak, is {{that they tend to}} run too long for the regular 22-minute time slot, leading to several cuts. For example, the script for the episode [...] "Search Committee" [...] was initially 75 pages—10 pages too long. A complete script is written for each episode; however, actors are given opportunities to improvise during the shooting process. Fischer said, [...] "Our shows are 100 percent scripted. They put everything down on paper. But we get to play <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit,</b> too. Steve and Rainn are brilliant improvisers." [...] This leads to a large number of deleted scenes with almost every episode of The Office, all of which are considered part of the show's canon and storyline by Daniels. Deleted scenes have sometimes been restored in repeats to make episodes longer or draw back people who have seen the episode before to see the bonus footage. In an experiment, a deleted scene from [...] "The Return" [...] was made available over NBC.com and iTunes, explaining the absence of a character over the next several episodes. Daniels hoped that word of mouth among fans would spread the information, but eventually considered the experiment a failure.|$|E

And we’ll be jumping <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit,</b> but I believe this is our only Then and Now." [...] Kirkman noted that the audience [...] " [...] so much more about Gareth {{and all of those}} people because of those two very minor scenes." [...] Gimple knew the backstory of Terminus while the characters were traveling there in the previous season, and stated that it echoes what happens next to Rick's group.

2500|$|Regarding the album's stripped-back closing track, [...] "You Were Good", Jim Adkins stated: [...] "A {{fair amount}} of the ideas for Damage started out as {{acoustic}} songs, like really rough acoustic songs. 'You Were Good' started out in a pretty acoustic-based world and {{when we tried to}} take it out of that world, we realized that without the acoustic guitar in there as a bed, it didn't feel the same without it being there. With 'You Were Good', we experimented <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> with fleshing it out and building the dynamics of it in a full band sense, {{but at the end of}} the day we all looked at each other and agreed it sounded better with just me and a guitar and the weirdo, Indian drone thing on there." [...] Guitarist and backing vocalist Tom Linton elaborated: [...] "It was just [...] with an acoustic guitar and his vocals, and there was never a point where he stopped and started over. He just played it from the beginning to the end live. Then I overdubbed an organ part and Alain [...] played the guitar part. That was really fun to do, and I don't think we had ever done it before, especially with vocals." ...|$|E

So we'll see what happens. It's gonna be an interesting album for us, for sure." ...|$|R
500|$|On the {{creation}} of Yang, Shonda Rhimes said the character contained [...] "a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of [...] personality". Speaking with talk show host Oprah Winfrey, Rhimes said: [...] "Cristina was second, simply because she's {{the kind of woman}} I know really well, and I like her. There's something interesting about a person who is that driven, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> emotionally disconnected but still a caring, sweet, and smart individual you could be friends with." [...] Sandra Oh, initially auditioned for the character of Bailey, adding: [...] "Thank God I did not get that part", explaining the show would not be the same without fellow cast member, Wilson. Discussing casting Oh as Yang, Rhimes said: [...] "She brought this energy that felt very fresh. From the beginning, I've been shaping Cristina <b>around</b> Sandra <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit.</b> One of my favorite things to do is take as much of her dialogue out of a scene as possible because she does so much nonverbally. Then I just watch what she manages to do without having a word to say." ...|$|R

Each role was cast without the character's races being pre-determined, keeping Rhimes' vision of diversity. The production staff began casting with the program's title character, Meredith Grey, which Rhimes stated was a difficult role to cast. [...] "I kept saying we need a girl like that girl from Moonlight Mile," [...] said Rhimes, [...] "and after a while, they were like, 'We think we can get that girl from Moonlight Mile." [...] The next to be cast, Sandra Oh (Dr. Cristina Yang), was initially invited to audition for the character of Bailey, but pressed to read for the role of Cristina instead. Many actors read for the role of Dr. Derek Shepherd, but when Patrick Dempsey read for the part, [...] "he was just perfect", according to Rhimes.|$|R

On November 18, 2008, in Obama's first {{interview}} as president-elect, Steve Kroft of 60 Minutes ended the interview with a question about the topic. Obama replied: I think any sensible person would say that if you've got a bunch of teams who play throughout the season, and many of them have one loss or two losses, there's no clear decisive winner that we should be creating a playoff system. Eight teams. That would be three rounds, to determine a national champion. It would add three extra weeks to the season. You could trim back on the regular season.

40|$|This chapter {{considers}} {{the role of}} women in British silent film comedy from 1895 to the end of the 1920 s and their legacy into the early sound period. It argues that women comedians became increasingly marginalized as cinema developed into an industry, with the codes, form and style of the “mature silent cinema” restricting women into a narrow range of stereotypes that negated female agency and prioritized looks and glamour over personality or character. The dominance of a few male directors in British cinema, particularly Asquith and Hitchcock, narrowed opportunities for comedic women with their preponderance for objectifying women. It commences with a resume of women performing slapstick and physical comedy, using the Edwardian Tilly Girl comedies as case studies, arguing that women enjoyed relative comic freedom until the Great War, despite the plethora of stereotypes—coy young ladies, “old maids,” suffragettes, domineering wives etc—that characterized their representation in early cinema. Florence Turner is presented as a key figure in the pivotal period immediately following World War I, before falling victim to one of British cinema’s periodic recessions. Betty Balfour’s ingénue “Squibs” is emblematic of the early 1920 s, but even her star wanes as she outgrows her youthful persona, becoming the butt of jokes <b>around</b> ageing in <b>A</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Bit</b> of Fluff (1928) ...|$|R

Bluto abruptly takes the singer's acoustic guitar out of his hands and smashes it, then hands a splintered piece of it back, saying [...] "Sorry." [...] Bishop told Songfacts that he and the film's musical director Kenny Vance {{came up with the idea}} for his folk singer character to perform [...] "Cherry." [...] "It seemed like the right song to do in the scene," [...] he said. The song was also featured in the children's CD, the Song of the Unicorn.

50|$|It is {{important}} to note that the horse, not the rider, is responsible for opening and closing the rider's angles (notably, the hip and knee). As the horse takes off, it raises its upper body off the ground and comes closer to the rider. This makes the rider's hip angle (between the thigh and chest) close. Over the fence, the rider keeps the angles closed. As the horse lands, it moves away from the rider's body, which allows the hip angle to open and the rider to become more perpendicular to the ground. Also, if the horse takes a jump wrong in some manner, due to rider error or other, the rider may be thrown <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> and may sometimes get 'left behind', where the rider's center of balance is behind that of the horse's. This can also throw the horse off balance and lead to other problems such as knocking down a rail.|$|E

In the interim, several of her songs were covered, including [...] "Start All Over", a song which was recorded for Sunday Love, but never made the album, by Miley Cyrus, [...] "Don't Let It Go to Your Head", the first single, by American Idol winner Jordin Sparks, and [...] "As a Blonde", which was covered by Selena Gomez & the Scene. Dobson was dropped from her label, Island Records, upon the shelving of her album, Sunday Love, after the release of two singles from it, the album was later released digitally in 2012. She then {{decided to go back to}} her roots and create a new album on her own terms. She said in an April 2007 interview that her new efforts were coming along nicely and should see the light of day sooner than later. However, during Dobson's songwriting and independent period, Joy had faced multiple delays due to her management, Chris Smith Management. Two years after Dobson spoke with ChartAttack.com, she was picked back up by Island. This caused numerous more push backs since Island wanted Dobson to write new tracks for the album, and omit previous ones.|$|R

I’d be carving to keep me awake or something like that. Well, that’s when I really went back to carving. I always did have something I like to put on wood. I actually saw a piece of wood that kinda reminded me of something, and so I started carving. I used to make pieces and set them in the window. You’d go to lunch, you’d come back and it’d be gone. And so I fixed them. I made a coffin with a dead man and stuck it in the window. He stayed there for about 2 months and nobody bothered it. We {{had a lot of fun}} with that thing. Nobody bothered. It’d sit there in the window and look at them, and nobody looked at it. Nobody steal nothing. If it was anything else, they’d get it.

If we teach him to say too much, I 2 ̆ 7 m afraid he might reach the error of our very high judicial authorities, and pest control for birds will be in much the same kind of situation as criminal control. We 2 ̆ 7 ll probably have to get permission from the bullies before we can conduct any control measures. Really, I think in commercial pest control, there are three areas we have to consider. One, of course is regulation that includes state, federal, municipal, or whatever domain may be involved. Second, is the commercial aspect of what we do. This may include the chemicals from the commercial companies, the cost of application, the price we have to pay for the material, and, of course, a moderating effect of what the competitor gets for the same type job. Third, is this individual right that we mentioned. In any commercial work we do, I think we must consider the individual right of our customer, the rights of the neighbors adjacent to our customer, and any others in the community who might be interested...|$|E

And everybody loves that message, 'What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.' It's a perfect representation of my life." ...|$|R
