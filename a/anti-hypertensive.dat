For the body to generate nitric oxide through the nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway, the reduction of nitrate to nitrite (by nitrate reductase, a bacterial enzyme) occurs in the mouth, by commensal bacteria, an obligatory and necessary step.

A cross sectional survey using the Morisky medication adherence scale (with intentional and unintentional non-adherence subscales) was completed by 480 people prescribed oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs), antihypertensive agents and statins. A within-subject analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that intentional non-adherence did not vary between OADs, <b>anti-hypertensives</b> and statins. Intentional non-adherence to statins significantly increased when the number of medicines prescribed was included as a between-subjects variable (p< 0. 05). Another within-subject ANOVA on unintentional non-adherence found a significant difference between OADs, <b>anti-hypertensives</b> and statins; unintentional non-adherence to OADs was significantly higher (p< 0. 05). When the number of medicines was added as a between-subject variable unintentional non-adherence was associated with higher numbers of medicines.

Echocardiography, including tissue Doppler imaging (TDI), and neurohormones were done at baseline and after 6 months. Mean age was 65 (+/- 10) years and 64 % was female. During 6 months of treatment, SBP decreased from 157 +/- 16 to 145 +/- 18 mmHg in the eprosartan group and from 158 +/- 17 to 141 +/- 18 mmHg {{in the control group}} (both p < 0. 001; p = ns between groups). Diastolic function was unaffected in both groups and there was no correlation between changes in SBP and changes in mean TDI (r = - 0. 06; p = 0. 58). Aldosterone levels decreased in the eprosartan group, but other neurohormones remained largely unchanged. Change in SBP was however related to the change in NT-proBNP (r = 0. 26; p = 0. 019).

40|$|Background: Insulin {{resistance}} {{may play}} a pathogenic role in cardiovascular disease (CVD). Resistance to insulin {{has been associated with}} obesity, hypertension, and abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism. The constellation of these features among insulin resistant subjects has been called the metabolic syndrome. Prevalence of the metabolic syndrome increases with age and is most common in the elderly. Different criteria have been proposed to define the metabolic syndrome (ATP, WHO, AACE, EGIR). Current management of metabolic syndrome focuses on the specific risk factors that the patient may have without targeting the underlying insulin resistance. Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEI) and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARB) are widely used antihypertensive medications that may improve insulin sensitivity. We hypothesize that they can be used to reduce the long term cardiovascular complications in elderly hypertensive subjects with evidence of insulin resistance. In this study, we determined the effect of ACEI/ARB on the long term development of CVD in hypertensive non-diabetic elderly patients with the metabolic syndrome, as well as in patients with insulin resistance. Methods: Our research project utilizes the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) dataset. This dataset is a community based observational study where elderly participants were randomly selected and followed up for 11 years and the time to any cardiovascular event was recorded. In our project, we included hypertensive, non-diabetic individuals, with evidence of metabolic syndrome or insulin resistance, but had not experienced cardiovascular events at baseline. Cox regression model was used to evaluate the effect of ACEI/ARB on the time to the first cardiovascular event compared to the other antihypertensive medications adjusting for possible confounders such as age, race, gender, smoking status, triglycerides, LDL levels, systolic blood pressure, development of diabetes, congestive heart failure (CHF) and the number of <b>anti-hypertensives.</b> Results: In elderly hypertensive non-diabetic subjects with the metabolic syndrome according to the ATP and the WHO criteria, the hazard ratio for CVD {{associated with the use of}} ACEI/ARB was 0. 65 or 0. 68 (with 95 % C. I. of [0. 45, 0. 98], and [0. 48, 0. 96]) respectively when compared to the group exposed to the other <b>anti-hypertensives.</b> When the metabolic syndrome was defined according to the AACE and EGIR, the use of ACE/ARB was associated with hazard ratios for CVD equal to 0. 74 and 0. 899, respectively (with 95 % C. I. of [0. 54, 1. 09] and [0. 61, 1. 34]) compared to the use of the other <b>anti-hypertensives.</b> Hypertensive non-diabetic elderly subjects who were insulin resistant as evidenced by a HOMA-IR in the upper quartile, had a hazard ratio for CVD of 0. 78 (95 % C. I. [0. 56, 1. 09]) associated with the use of ACEI/ARB compared to the use of other <b>anti-hypertensives.</b> Conclusions: The effect of ACEI/ARB on the development of cardiovascular events differs according to the definition of the metabolic syndrome. Elderly hypertensive patients with the metabolic syndrome, defined by ATP and WHO, seem to have lower risk of CVD with ACEI/ARB compared to the other antihypertensive medications. However, this association is not significant in elderly hypertensive patients in the upper quartile of HOMA and in patients with the metabolic syndrome as defined by AACE and EGIR criteria...|$|R
