5|$|The {{gray wolf}} {{is one of}} the world's best-known and most-researched animals, with {{probably}} more books written <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>than</b> any other wildlife species. It {{has a long history of}} association with humans, having been despised and hunted in most pastoral communities because of its attacks on livestock, while conversely being respected in some agrarian and hunter-gatherer societies. Although the fear of wolves is pervasive in many human societies, the majority of recorded attacks on people have been attributed to animals suffering from rabies. Non-rabid wolves have attacked and killed people, mainly children, but this is rare, as wolves are relatively few, live away from people, and have developed a fear of humans from hunters and shepherds.|$|E
25|$|His {{other groups}} {{would include the}} Adrian Rollini Quintette, The Adrian Rollini Trio (primarily late 1930s), and Adrian and his Tap Room Gang based in the Hotel President at 234 West 48th Street in New York City. He managed Adrian's Tap Room, inside the hotel during the early swing era {{starting}} in 1935, as well as leading the small band of 6–8 players. He had the Whitby Grill on West 45th Street. Both of these were indicative of his inseparability of professional and social life. His clientele in each club were {{for the most part}} musicians on a holiday. Rollini could be found on the radio working with artists like Kate Smith. As if he didn't have enough going for him he turned once again to another phase of musical venture, and opened a store for sale and repair of musical instruments, known as White Way Musical Products which was located at 1587 Broadway. It had long been his belief that the artist playing the instrument knows more <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>than</b> the maker concerned only with the mechanics. The shop was a hot spot for autograph hounds who trolled the shop in search of famous band leaders. He was also making excursions between the Georgian Room and the Piccadilly Circus Bar, both in the Piccadilly Hotel. He also began recording for Master and Muzak.|$|E
500|$|Published in {{an article}} for the Daily Mail {{discussing}} a rise in bi-curiosity amongst middle class teenage girls, an E4 spokeswoman said of Emily and Naomi's kiss: [...] "Skins is written by young people who don't see sexuality as defining who they are. They're a bit cooler <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>than</b> that, so they think of the characters they create as being {{in love with a}} person, rather than a boy or a girl." ...|$|E

500|$|One of Jenny's storylines {{in season}} two was her revelation of being sexually abused as a child. The events were portrayed {{in a series}} of flashbacks and dream sequences. Yet, this left viewers {{confused}} about what actually happened to Jenny. During an interview with LGBT monthly magazine The Advocate, Chaiken commented about the storyline: [...] "Well we all know it was an incident of sexual abuse. I had not wanted to be more explicit <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>than</b> that – one because memory of trauma is very strange. Who knows what happened to Jenny? Jenny doesn't necessarily know herself." ...|$|E
500|$|The writer Rupert Gould, in {{a lengthy}} essay on New South Greenland [...] {{published}} in 1929, queries {{the assumption that the}} [...] sighting was simply invented by Morrell, partly on the grounds that very little weight is given to the discovery in Morrell's 500-page account. Gould writes: [...] "If Morrell wished to gain an undeserved reputation as an Antarctic explorer, one would think he could have gone a better way <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>than</b> to bury his pièces justificatives, after he had forged them, in an undistinguished [...] corner of so bulky a book." [...] Nor would he have credited it to Captain Johnson two years earlier, rather than to himself.|$|E
500|$|The 19th-century {{antiquarian}} Angharad Llwyd {{described the}} church as [...] "small, but remarkably well built", and mentioned the [...] "ancient and curious chapel at {{the west end of}} the nave." [...] Writing in 1859, the clergyman and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones said that St Cwyllog's had [...] "rather better architectural features <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>than</b> most of the small churches in Anglesey." [...] A 2009 guide to the buildings of the region describes the 1854 restoration as [...] "tactful", and notes the [...] "rare surviving Georgian fittings", including the pulpit. [...] A 2011 guide to the religious buildings of Wales says that St Cwyllog's has [...] "the earliest and finest of several pre-ecclesiological church interiors in Anglesey".|$|E

6000|$|... "But it ain't true," [...] said Captain Rik firmly. [...] "They talk a deal {{of stuff}} <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> more <b>than</b> nine-tenths {{of which is}} lies--pure fable.

500|$|Bill Muehlenberg from Australian Family Association {{believed}} Lana's {{introduction and}} storyline {{was just an}} attempt to increase ratings. A Sydney Star Observer reporter praised Lana's cousin, Sindi, for being sympathetic and reacting {{in a positive way}} when Lana came out to her. The reporter also praised Sky's reaction for being [...] "more let's talk <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>than</b> get away from me, you lezzo freak", while adding that it seemed Neighbours had wanted Lana to be a [...] "sympathetic gay character", which must have upset the Christian groups. Of Lana's storyline, a writer for AfterEllen stated, [...] "The significance of this depiction was that it occurred in a relatively conservative, family-oriented show with a large child viewership, and all the major sympathetic characters were presented as supportive of Lana's sexuality, with the bullies being depicted as villains." ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{the speech}} was little noticed, and McGovern backed away from saying {{anything}} publicly {{for over a year}} afterward, partly because of the November 1963 assassination of President Kennedy and partly to not appear strident. Though more skeptical <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>than</b> most senators, McGovern voted in favor of the August 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, {{which turned out to be}} an essentially unbounded authorization for President Lyndon B. Johnson to escalate U.S. involvement in the war. McGovern thought the commander-in-chief should be given limited authority to retaliate against an attack; subsequently he said his instinct had been to vote no, but that he had voted yes based on Senator J. William Fulbright's urging to stand behind Johnson politically. Indeed, the day after the resolution vote, McGovern spoke concerning his fears that the vote would lead to greater involvement in the war; Wayne Morse, one of only two senators to oppose the resolution, sardonically noted that this fell into the category of [...] "very interesting, but very belated". This would become the vote that McGovern most bitterly regretted.|$|E
2500|$|The explorer, Richard Francis Burton, in {{his study}} of Thule points out that it has had many {{definitions}} over the centuries. Many more authors have written <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>than</b> remembered Pytheas. The question of the location of Pytheas' Thule remains. The latitudes given by the ancient authors can be reconciled. The missing datum required to fix the location is longitude: [...] "Manifestly we cannot rely upon the longitude." ...|$|E

There are thirteen known dry rotting species of Fusarium but Fusarium sambucinum causes the most {{problems in the}} United States. Fusarium species are asexual but some do have a sexual stage.

2500|$|The {{books are}} lavish and with just 400 to 600 {{original}} editions published are now prized {{as examples of}} {{a certain type of}} High Victorian grandeur. Millais' skills are essentially Victorian, as private wealth allowed him to indulge his passions on a grand scale. He was undoubtedly tenacious. His son Raoul spoke of him as an [...] "astonishing man and his power of concentration was such that once he took up a subject he never left it until he knew more <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>than</b> anyone in the World" ...|$|E
2500|$|Cage {{returned}} to the United States in 1931. He went to Santa Monica, California, where he made a living partly by giving small, private lectures on contemporary art. He got to know various important figures of the Southern California art world, such as pianist Richard Buhlig (who became his first teacher) and arts patron Galka Scheyer. By 1933 Cage decided to concentrate on music rather than painting. [...] "The people who heard my music had better things to say <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>than</b> the people who looked at my paintings {{had to say about}} my paintings", Cage later explained. In 1933 he sent some of his compositions to Henry Cowell; the reply was a [...] "rather vague letter", in which Cowell suggested that Cage study with Arnold Schoenberg—Cage's musical ideas at the time included composition based on a 25-tone row, somewhat similar to Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique. Cowell also advised that, before approaching Schoenberg, Cage should take some preliminary lessons, and recommended Adolph Weiss, a former Schoenberg pupil.|$|E
2500|$|Because of {{a reduced}} {{budget for the}} Goddard building, Kahn was forced {{to make some changes}} to its design that have reduced its {{interest}} to architectural historians, who have written much less <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>than</b> about the Richards building. [...] Differences between the two buildings are especially noticeable in the cantilevered corners of the laboratory towers, which have a plainer aspect in the Goddard building. [...] In addition, the administration required Kahn to work on the Goddard building in association with an engineering and construction firm, leaving him unable to assert his usual painstaking control over the construction process and resulting in a lower standard of finish detail. [...] Plywood was used to create the forms for poured concrete in the Goddard building, for example, whereas Kahn had used carefully selected planks for that purpose at Richards to create a more interesting concrete finish. [...] As a result, the Goddard building [...] "employs a simplified and visually heavier precast structural system" [...] than the Richards building and [...] "does not possess the same elegant character".|$|E

"It {{would be}} {{difficult}} to set <b>about</b> <b>it</b> otherwise <b>than</b> coolly with the thermometer thirty-five below zero," [...] remarked Fred, beating his hands together, and stamping his feet, while the breath issued from his mouth like dense clouds of steam, and fringed the edges of his hood and the breast of his jumper with hoar-frost.|$|R

2500|$|Wilson took a {{break from}} the {{negotiations}} and departed February 14, 1919 for home, then returned to Paris three weeks later and remained until the conclusion of a treaty in June. Heckscher describes Wilson, during the first four weeks of the Conference as, [...] "playing, with force and discretion, a commanding role…he established his priorities, secured accommodation on major issues and won preliminary acceptance of the League." [...] He promoted his plan in France, and then at home in February. Wilson gave a speech at the Metropolitan Opera House in defense of the League—he was more insistent <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>than</b> ever. Heckscher contends that the enduring image of Wilson as a grim, unsmiling and unforgiving figure dates from this visit home during the conference. While the general public along with editorial writers, churches and peace groups generally favored the League, the Republicans vowed to defeat the League and discredit Wilson. Wilson notably did not address the Congress as to ongoing deliberations at the peace conference, as indeed his counterpart Lloyd George did with Parliament. Heckscher opines that this was a missed opportunity to forge the debate even though the Congressional majority had changed. In France he was without the usual control over his message through the media; in fact, the French initiated an aggressive propaganda campaign {{in the midst of the}} Conference to affect its outcome.|$|E

5000|$|The novel {{garnered}} mostly upbeat reviews. The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books said [...] "it...is smart, {{taking the}} old vampire story and really thinking <b>about</b> <b>it</b> rather <b>than</b> merely letting the vampire go through his traditional paces" [...] while Publisher's Weekly commented [...] "The overtly supernatural climax and a disappointing plot twist squelch the sparkle of Anderson's prose somewhat".|$|R
