5|$|As he {{prepared}} {{to run for president}} in 2000, Vice President Al Gore attempted to maintain good relations with the Jackson family, hoping to discourage Jackson's father from running for president against him. Jackson received a congratulatory call from Gore after his election in 1995. In 1998, Gore campaigned for and advised Jackson, <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> of his way to instruct aides to create a vice presidential event in Jackson's district to boost Jackson.|$|E
5|$|Beatty's first {{newspaper}} was the Beatty Bullfrog Miner, which began publishing in 1905 <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> {{of business in}} 1909. The Rhyolite Herald was the region's most important paper, starting in 1905 and reaching a circulation of 10,000 by 1909. It ceased publication in 1912, and the Beatty area had no newspaper from then until 1947. The Beatty Bulletin, a supplement to the Goldfield News, was published from then through 1956.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{his early}} success, sales later {{declined}} and Muntz's creditors refused to provide further financing in 1954. Muntz admitted his business lost $1,457,000 from April to August 1953, {{and although he}} tried to reorganize, Muntz TV filed bankruptcy <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> of business in 1959. (The company would be reorganized and last through the 1960s, but without its namesake at the helm.) However, Muntz's success continued in the sales of cars and general consumer electronics.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a change}} in management, Coleman signed with Island Records, and Of Human Feelings was {{released}} in 1982 by its subsidiary label Antilles Records. Critics generally praised the album's expressive music and harmolodic approach, but it made little commercial impact <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> of print. Coleman enlisted his son Denardo as manager after a dispute with his former managers over the album's royalties, a change that inspired him to perform publicly again during the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|On 5 November 2013, Anonymous protesters {{gathered}} {{around the world for}} the Million Mask March. Demonstrations were held in 400 cities around the world to coincide with Guy Fawkes Night.

5|$|The 1958 FIFA World Cup finals saw Scotland {{draw their}} first game against Yugoslavia 1–1, but they then lost to Paraguay and France <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> {{at the first}} stage. Matt Busby had been due to manage the team at the World Cup, but the severe {{injuries}} he suffered in the Munich air disaster meant that trainer Dawson Walker {{took charge of the}} team instead.|$|E
5|$|After Tommy Docherty's brief spell as manager, Willie Ormond {{was hired}} in 1973. Ormond lost his first match in charge 5–0 to England, but {{recovered}} to steer Scotland to their first World Cup finals in 16 years in 1974. At the 1974 World Cup finals in West Germany, Scotland achieved their most impressive performance at a World Cup tournament. The team was unbeaten but failed to progress beyond the group stages on goal difference. After beating Zaïre, they drew with both Brazil and Yugoslavia, <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> because they had beaten Zaïre by the smallest margin.|$|E
5|$|Barcelona {{kicked the}} match off, but Manchester United showed their intent from the outset, forcing goalkeeper Víctor Valdés to concede a throw-in after just 10 seconds. Further {{pressure}} on the attack resulted in Yaya Touré fouling Anderson within Cristiano Ronaldo's shooting range. Ronaldo fired the free kick directly at Valdés, but the Spanish goalkeeper could only parry the ball and Gerard Piqué did well to divert Park Ji-sung's follow-up effort over the bar. The resulting corner was cleared, but {{only as far as}} Wayne Rooney, whose snap-shot was wayward <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> for a goal kick.|$|E

5|$|In the 22ndminute, a lofted through-pass from Carrick found Rooney on {{the left}} wing, but the Liverpudlian's cross was blocked by Touré <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> for a corner kick. The corner, taken by Giggs, found Ronaldo, but the Portuguese got too far under the ball and headed over. Precise passing from the Barcelona midfield got the Catalans moving upfield until a {{shoulder}} charge from Anderson sent Iniesta stumbling {{to the ground in}} the inside-left channel 30yards from goal. The consequent free kick was taken by Xavi, who sent the ball just wide of the near post. Another free kick followed, as Messi was bundled over by a double-challenge from Vidić and Carrick, but it came to nothing.|$|E
5|$|On 23 December, Tom Bawcock {{decided to}} brave the storms <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> in his fishing boat. Despite the stormy {{weather and the}} {{difficult}} seas, he managed to catch enough fish to feed the entire village. The entire catch (including seven types of fish) was baked into a pie, which had the fish heads poking through to prove that there were fish inside. Ever since then, the Tom Bawcock's Eve festival is held on 23 December in Mousehole. The celebration and memorial {{to the efforts of}} Tom Bawcock sees the villagers parading a huge stargazy pie during the evening with a procession of handmade lanterns, before eating the pie itself.|$|E
5|$|The furnace {{continued}} in anemic health until the Panic of 1907. As {{a result of}} that crisis, it was idle for most of 1908 and half of 1909. It was operated in 1910 largely to use up its inventory of local ore, <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> of blast on January 23, 1911. Bellefonte Furnace had closed in December. The shutdown of the furnaces was to be temporary, but both facilities were no longer remunerative to operate, and no buyer willing to operate them could be found. Leftover pig iron and furnace slag from Nittany Furnace were shipped out over the Nittany Valley RR in 1912–1913. The furnace and railroad were put up for sale in 1914 and the furnace demolished. The furnace site was later used by the Titan Metal and Manufacturing Company.|$|E

5|$|Built at Frindsbury, near Rochester in Kent, Bellerophon was {{initially}} laid up in ordinary, briefly being commissioned during the Spanish and Russian Armaments. She entered service with the Channel Fleet on {{the outbreak of}} the French Revolutionary Wars, and took part in the Glorious First of June in 1794, the first of several fleet actions of the wars. Bellerophon narrowly escaped being captured by the French in 1795, when her squadron was nearly overrun by a powerful French fleet, but the bold actions of the squadron's commander, Vice-Admiral Sir William Cornwallis, caused the French to retreat. She played a minor role in efforts to intercept a French invasion force bound for Ireland in 1797, and then joined the Mediterranean Fleet under Sir John Jervis. Detached to reinforce Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson's fleet in 1798, she took part in the decisive defeat of a French fleet at the Battle of the Nile. She then returned to England <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> to the West Indies, where she spent the Peace of Amiens on cruises and convoy escort duty between the Caribbean and North America.|$|E
5|$|In April 1966, Kerlan told Koufax it {{was time}} to retire and that his arm could not take another season. Koufax kept Kerlan's advice to himself <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> every fourth day to pitch. He ended up {{pitching}} 323 innings, a 27–9 record, and a 1.73 ERA. Since then, no left-hander has had more wins, nor a lower ERA, in a season (Phillies pitcher Steve Carlton did match the 27-win mark in 1972). In the final game of the regular season, the Dodgers had to beat the Phillies to win the pennant. In the second game of a doubleheader, Koufax faced Jim Bunning for the second time that season, in a match-up between perfect game winners. Koufax, on two days rest, pitched a complete game, 6–3 victory to clinch the pennant. He started 41 games (for {{the second year in a}} row); only two left-handers started as many games in any season over the ensuing years through 2016.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool got {{the second}} half under way, but it was West Ham who had the first attack of the half. Etherington {{advanced}} down the right hand side of the pitch and passed to Harewood, whose shot was saved by Reina, who also saved a subsequent shot from Benayoun. Liverpool had a chance immediately afterwards as Cissé passed to Alonso, but his shot was blocked <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> for a corner. A minute later, Liverpool made the first substitution of the match, as the injured Harry Kewell was replaced by Fernando Morientes. Liverpool equalised in the 54th minute, when Gerrard volleyed home a knock-down header from Crouch. The first yellow card of the match went to Ashton after he fouled Finnan in the 60th minute. Three minutes later, Carragher also received a yellow card for a foul on Ashton.|$|E

5|$|When Veronica discovers new {{evidence}} that suggests that Lilly's convicted killer is innocent, she decides to investigate the case. As Veronica delves deeper into the murder, she also works on other investigations, seeks her mother's whereabouts and deals with the aftermath of being drugged and raped during an 09er party. Veronica, no longer part of the school's wealthy in-crowd, makes some new friends: Wallace, Neptune High basketball star; Weevil, leader of the PCHers, a Latino biker gang; and Mac, Neptune High's resident computer genius. Using her friends' resources, {{as well as those}} provided by her father and his contacts, Veronica gains a reputation for sleuthing and finds her skills in increasingly high demand at her school. Things get more complicated when Veronica falls into a relationship with Lilly's ex-boyfriend Logan, who for a time held Veronica partly responsible for Lilly's death <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> of his way to harass her.|$|E
