40|$|Abstract: Antimony {{toxicity}} occurs either due to {{occupational exposure}} or during therapy. Occupational exposure may cause respiratory irritation, pneumoconiosis, <b>antimony</b> <b>spots</b> {{on the skin}} and gastrointestinal symptoms. In addition antimony trioxide is possibly carcinogenic to humans. Improvements in working conditions have remarkably decreased the incidence of antimony toxicity in the workplace. As a therapeutic, antimony has been mostly used {{for the treatment of}} leishmaniasis and schistosomiasis. The major toxic sideeffects of antimonials as a result of therapy are cardiotoxicity (~ 9 % of patients) and pancreatitis, which is seen commonly in HIV and visceral leishmaniasis co-infections. Quality control of each batch of drugs produced and regular monitoring for toxicity is required when antimonials are used therapeutically...|$|E
