5|$|Before Crisis began {{development}} in 2002. The Compilation was first unveiled in 2003 with {{the announcement of}} Advent Children. None of the titles in the series {{up to that point}} were traditional role-playing games like the original. The explanation for this was that traditional RPGs took long production periods and a large staff, which would have made the project stand out <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>too</b> <b>much.</b> One of the other considerations for the team was not to make the titles lightweight as X-2 had been, due to backlash from parts of the fanbase. Conversely, making Final Fantasy X-2 reminded the team that they did not need to stick to completely serious traditional RPGs, enabling the original creation of the Compilation. While Advent Children was the first Compilation title to begin production, it ran into problems during post-production, resulting in the first released title being Before Crisis, despite it being the second title to begin development. Before Crisis was also originally planned for release in North America, but the mobile phones available in North America at the time were not able to handle the game. In addition, the producer Kosei Ito left Square Enix in 2008 and Tabata moved on to other projects, leaving its localization unlikely. Japanese animation studio Madhouse created a commercial to promote Before Crisis. Due to its success and staff feelings that important scenes from VII represented in Advent Children had been needlessly disjointed, the studio was chosen to produce an animated film: this eventually became Last Order. Crisis Core was originally going to be an action game, but became an action RPG, staying within the staff's design strengths while incorporating action elements.|$|E
500|$|In {{the words}} of Robert Smith, {{regarding}} the album's conception, [...] "I had two choices at the time, which were either completely giving in [...] or making a record of it and getting it out of me". He also claims he [...] "really thought that was it for the group. I had every intention of signing off. I {{wanted to make the}} ultimate 'fuck off' record, and then sign off [...] ". Smith was mentally exhausted during that period of time: [...] "I was in a really depressed frame of mind between 1981 and 1982". The band [...] "had been touring for about 200 days a year and it all got <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> because there was never any time to do anything else".|$|E
500|$|Perry {{expressed}} {{approval of}} the cover of her song, [...] "Teenage Dream", through the social networking website Twitter. Harper found the choreography uncomfortable viewing, and Hanh Nguyen of Zap2it agreed that the performers appeared to be [...] "rockin' out <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> to it", but felt that the song worked [...] "remarkably well" [...] overall. Futterman deemed it the best song of the episode, and appreciated {{that it was more}} understated than numbers performed by rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline during the show's first season. Stack went further and called the performance one of his favorites on Glee; he enjoyed the choreography and arrangement and graded it [...] "A+". Benigno again gave the song an [...] "A"; he called it [...] "flawless" [...] and an improvement on Perry's original. In December 2012, TV Guide named the rendition one of Glee best performances.|$|E

The website reported the critical consensus as [...] "... visually arresting, but the story could be told with a bit more energy." [...] Critical reception of Girl With a Pearl Earring was mixed, with reviewers positively emphasising the film's visuals and performances while questioning elements of its story. Historian Alex von Tunzelmann, writing for The Guardian, praised the film for its [...] "... sumptuous design and incredible Vermeerish appearance ..."

500|$|IGN {{gave the}} episode a [...] "Good" [...] rating of 7.8 out of 10 and {{summarized}} the episode as being [...] "a much more focused story than 'Because You Left' {{but in the}} shadow of the season premiere's revelations and grandeur it is ultimately the weaker of the two. The comedic moments that string together Hurley's journey only go so far and the rest feels <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> like filler...

[...] IGN later ranked [...] "The Lie" [...] 84th out of the 115 Lost episodes, writing [...] "this isn't a terrible episode, but it feels like a bit of a stop-gap, in the midst of a very cool run of episodes.

500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} television critics, with Rudd's {{performance and the}} various subplots being generally well-received, although some disliked the main mystery. Eric Goldman of IGN graded the episode a 7.8 out of 10, indicating that it was [...] "good". He generally praised Rudd's performance and the case-of-the week, but he was critical of its ending, stating that [...] "after last week, it was <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of another 'and that's one to grow on' conclusion." [...] He was also mixed towards the episode's subplots, enjoying Mac's romantic storyline but disliking Logan's continued interest in Veronica. He also referred to Vinnie running for Sheriff as [...] "a bit ridiculous". Reviewer Alan Sepinwall, on his blog What's Alan Watching?, lauded the episode, particularly Rudd's performance. He stated that Rudd, despite playing a stock character, [...] "made me feel like I hadn't seen it a thousand times before." [...] He also enjoyed the pairing of Mac and Max, while {{he believed that the}} impact of Vinnie and Leo's reappearances was blunted by the knowledge that the show would likely not return for a fourth season. Television Without Pity graded the episode a [...] "B".|$|E

For less dedicated listeners, the rarities bog down the set slightly, but this remains the definitive overview of this blue-collar Australian rocker." ...|$|R
500|$|Metro {{gave the}} episode {{three out of}} five stars, writing that [...] "Colin Morgan makes a likeable boy wizard but there’s <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> formula– {{and not in the}} magical sense". The review {{described}} the episode as a [...] "test of patience" [...] due to Merlin's inability to use magic and the [...] "hideously jaunty, distinctly non-medieval soundtrack". Tom Shales of The Washington Post criticised the [...] "sluggish pace" [...] of the premiere, noting that the episode was only [...] "brightened" [...] by the dragon, though similar creatures were common in the genre and it [...] "lacks personality as well as panache". Shales felt that the series took [...] "the stuff of legend and imagination and makes it dry and commonplace". Den of Geek reviewer Mark Pickavance felt that the episode was [...] "uneven and often very stilted", and failed at introducing both the characters and telling the story of the first meeting of Arthur and Merlin. He was displeased with the deviation from established mythology and the lapses in logic. The Times AA Gill described Merlin as [...] "bland", writing that it was for [...] "a large untapped audience that yearns for Abercrombie & Fitch drama". Hermione Eyre of The Independent called it [...] "horrible", disliking the [...] "modern" [...] feeling, the [...] "awful" [...] make-up, and commented that [...] "Guinevere looks like a supply teacher".|$|E
500|$|However, {{in a more}} mixed review, Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times {{felt that}} the song [...] "seems {{as if it were}} written by a ninth-grader imagining her rebellious college sister’s lifestyle" [...] and felt that it lacked {{creativity}} within Cyrus' catalog. Writing for Rolling Stone, Jon Dolan was skeptical of Cyrus' increasingly provocative image, stating that the lyrics in the chorus would be [...] "an odd fit for any singer" [...] and opining that [...] "there's still <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> Disney in her voice to fill the track." [...] Naomi Zeichner of The Fader praised the song, writing, [...] "Cyrus said in her recent MTV doc (...) , that she chose it to be her album's first single: 'Not everyone {{came to me and said}} okay, you've got the first single. I had to say no, I know this is it and I'll go to battle if I have to, against anyone who doesn't believe in it. Now I have this freedom to do whatever I want, because people trust me.' She was right about this one. The song's straightforward party is now tied to a sordid universe of visuals- the official video and the VMA performance."

500|$|B in the Mix: The Remixes {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Kurt Kirton of About.com highlighted the remixes of [...] "Everytime" [...] and [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know", {{adding that the}} album {{would be better if}} it included more tracks. He summarized his review saying, [...] "this is a decent release that should please any Britney fan and most club music fanatics". Barry Walters of Rolling Stone said the album was [...] "even more redundant" [...] than Greatest Hits: My Prerogative, but added that with the exception of [...] "Toxic", [...] "just about every original track is bettered here". Spence D. of IGN said: [...] "If you had the choice to purchase only one Britney Spears' album, then this would be the one to spend your money on." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic commented that [...] "B in the Mix doesn't exactly erase the impression that Spears isn't in tune with her recording career". He also stated that on tracks such as [...] "Toxic", [...] "her flaws stand out just <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> [...] the instrumental hooks have been removed from the record, leaving Spears to carry the day—which she can't really do. [...] Overall this album sounds and feels like what it really is: a piece of product." [...] MTV writer Bradley Stern praised the album, saying it [...] "featured loads of excellent remixes stretching from [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] to [...] "Toxic", but nothing shined quite as bright as the album's undeniable highlight: [...] "And Then We Kiss" [...] (Junkie XL Remix)." ...|$|E
500|$|After this, Holst tackled {{his final}} attempt at opera in a cheerful vein, with The Wandering Scholar (1929–30), to a text by Clifford Bax.

[...] Short observes that the opening motif makes several reappearances without being {{identified}} with a particular character, but imposes musical unity on the work.|$|R

For us that was intense eye contact, lack of personal space, oversharing, maybe <b>a</b> little <b>bit</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> love here and there.

500|$|The cast of FOX musical series Glee {{performed}} {{this song}} on the episode [...] "Blame It on the Alcohol", with Heather Morris' character, Brittany Pierce, taking the lead. The episode revolved around teen drinking and its dangers. The members of Glee Club are asked to perform at the school's alcohol awareness assembly, in which [...] "Tik Tok" [...] {{is one of the}} songs performed. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club wrote that the song's inclusion in the episode was superfluous, stating that it was just an excuse to get a Kesha song on Glee. VanDerWerff however, wrote that he [...] "REALLY liked Heather Morris'" [...] rendition of the song. Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly praised Brittany's choreography and overall performance in [...] "Tik Tok", writing, [...] "The huge star of this number was clearly Brittany, who more and more every week proves that she needs to be moved to the forefront of this show's big performances and storylines." [...] Gonzalez gave the cover version of [...] "Tik Tok" [...] a B, calling it [...] "pure, fun entertainment up until we got to the part straight out of the mind of Gordie LaChance. So even though the purple vomit was <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for this weak viewer, the performance made me add a Ke$ha song to my iTunes, which I never thought would happen." [...] Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone gave the cover version of [...] "Tik Tok" [...] a mostly positive review, writing, [...] "Love Brittany as we do, we wish Rachel or Mercedes stepped up to the mic. The performance is less risqué than their Pep Rally [...] "Push It" [...] but winds up causing more controversy when Brittany pukes on Rachel and Santana also vomits up grey slush.

Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone acknowledged the influences of Madonna but pointed out {{that they would not}} overshadow the song, as it [...] " [...] up all the complex Gaga mythos, all her politics and Catholic angst and smeared lipstick, in one brilliant pop blast." [...] Caryn Ganz, while writing for Yahoo! Music, criticized [...] "Born This Way", stating that the song was [...] "overworked, overwrought, noisy, cheesy, and very, very derivative." [...] She specifically noted the similarities to songs like [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] (2010), [...] "Waterfalls" [...] (1995), and three of Madonna's songs: [...] "Express Yourself", [...] "Ray of Light" [...] (1998), and [...] "Vogue". Megan Friedman from Time and Marissa Moss from The Huffington Post summarized their reaction as [...] "mixed", due to the similarities they found with [...] "Express Yourself". Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph noted that the imitative nature of the song would affect perceptions of Gaga's artistry, since [...] "Born This Way" [...] was [...] " [...] a reworking of Madonna's 'Express Yourself' with a touch of 'Vogue', which is <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> Madonna for someone who is trying to establish her own identity as the, er, new Madonna."

There didn't seem to be any geography and you were wondering what the hell was going on." [...] Kim Newman of Empire gave it 4/5, remarking it was not [...] "bigger and better than Casino Royale, [...] perhaps a smart move in that there's still a sense at the finish that Bond's mission has barely begun." [...] However, he expressed nostalgia for the more humorous Bond films. The Sunday Times review noted that [...] "following Casino Royale {{was never going to be}} easy, but the director Marc Forster has brought the brand's successful relaunch crashing back to earth – with a yawn"; the screenplay [...] "is at times incomprehensible" [...] and the casting [...] "is a mess." [...] The review concludes that [...] "Bond has been stripped of his iconic status. He no longer represents anything particularly British, or even modern. In place of glamour, we get a spurious grit; instead of style, we get product placement; in place of fantasy, we get a redundant and silly realism." [...] The Guardian gave a more positive review, rating it as 3/5 stars, and was particularly fond of Craig's performance, saying he [...] "made the part his own, every inch the coolly ruthless agent-killer, nursing a broken heart and coldly suppressed rage" [...] and calling the film [...] "a crash-bang Bond, high on action, low on quips, long on location glamour, short on product placement"; it concludes [...] "Quantum of Solace isn't as good as Casino Royale: the smart elegance of Craig's Bond debut has been toned down in favour of conventional action. But the man himself powers this movie; he carries the film: it's an indefinably difficult task for an actor. Craig measures up." ...|$|E
