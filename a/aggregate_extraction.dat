40|$|This {{short letter}} investigates the {{dynamics}} of <b>aggregates</b> <b>extraction</b> in Serbia between 1973 and 2015. The change point analysis identifies 5 structural breaks in the intercept and linear time trend of aggregates extraction: 1980, 1989, 1995, 2003 and 2009. The estimated break dates correspond to the major business cycle turning points of the Serbian economy in the last 40 years. These findings suggest how <b>aggregates</b> <b>extraction</b> industry in Serbia was largely affected by the overall economic activity between 1973 and 2015...|$|R

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Age of Discoveries, Oeiras became the industrial and commercial warehouse of Lisbon. The development of the Gunpowder factory (Fábrica da Pólvora) in Barcarena, was therefore, important in the expansion of the Portuguese dominions of the Orient, in addition to the <b>aggregate</b> <b>extraction</b> and calcium oxide furnaces in Paço de Arcos. These industries were supported and guarded by the construction of several fortifications along a defensive maritime line that ringed the southern coast to Lisbon and that controlled navigation in the Tagus estuary, from the 16th to 18th centuries. This perimeter included the Fort of São Lourenço da Cabeça Seca (also known as the Lighthouse or Tower of Bugio), rising from a tiny islet {{in the middle of the}} Tagus River, and the Fort of São Julião da Barra, both examples of the Renaissance military architecture.|$|E
50|$|The Bruce Mines changed {{ownership}} {{several times}} between 1847 and 1944, {{when they were}} decommissioned. Flooding and cave-ins in 1876 ended the 30-year period of active mining history.

The Township of Plummer Additional was incorporated in 1891 while Northern Ontario's first town, the Town of Bruce Mines was officially incorporated in 1903 when it separated from the Township of Plummer Additional. Several attempts to re-open the mines in the early 1900s saw only limited success by Mond Nickel, who shipped the quartz-copper flux ore to Sudbury. Mond Nickel shut down the Bruce Mines in 1921. The mines were decommissioned in 1944 and forestry activities have declined, but agriculture, <b>aggregate</b> <b>extraction</b> and tourism continue as the main economic activities in the area.|$|E

40|$|There are {{two ways}} to {{calculate}} the dynamic path of <b>aggregate</b> <b>extraction</b> when there is free access to a common property resource: (1) calculate the rent-dissipating <b>aggregate</b> <b>extraction</b> in any period (as a function of the stock) and then derive the dynamic path using the transition equation and initial condition or (2) examine the path of <b>aggregate</b> <b>extraction</b> in a subgame perfect equilibrium as the number of players expands without bound. The latter approach is theoretically correct but often intractable. The former approach, which has been widely used for more than thirty years, is tractable and generally presumed to yield the identical <b>aggregate</b> <b>extraction</b> path. We show by example that this presumption is erroneous. We then provide conditions which suffice for the traditional approach to be correct...|$|E
