5|$|Four Israeli airmen, led by future {{squadron}} leader Dror Ben-David, travelled to the US in 1997 for the F-15E conversion course, {{and the first}} two aircraft landed in Hatzerim on January 19, 1998. 16 aircraft had <b>arrived</b> <b>by</b> January 1, 1999, when the squadron was declared operational, and 10 days later the unit carried out it first operational sorties over southern Lebanon.

5|$|Historical {{large-scale}} immigration was {{facilitated by}} the introduction of steamships (from 1823). By 1840, up to 5,000 English people, mostly half-pay officers and their families, had settled in Jersey. In the aftermath of 1848, Polish, Russian, Hungarian, Italian and French political refugees came to Jersey. Following Louis Napoléon's coup of 1851, more French proscrits <b>arrived.</b> <b>By</b> the end of the 19th century, well-to-do British families, attracted by the lack of income tax, were settling in Jersey in increasing numbers, establishing St Helier as a predominantly English-speaking town.|$|E
5|$|In February 1864, {{her family}} sent {{her and her}} brother to Melbourne {{to live with her}} sister, with the {{intention}} of helping to improve Baeyertz's health. By the time that the siblings <b>arrived</b> <b>by</b> ship in Melbourne, Baeyertz had already recovered and she quickly integrated herself into the Australian social life. She soon met Charles Baeyertz, a bank manager at the Richmond branch of National Bank of Australasia and a practising Anglican. The couple started a relationship, keeping it secret from both their families.|$|E

5|$|In July 1877, Young tried {{one more}} time at a {{spelling}} reform, ordering lead type designed for the orthography of Benn Pitman (Isaac's brother) {{with the intention of}} printing an edition of the Book of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants using it. Most of the type had <b>arrived</b> <b>by</b> August, but with Young's death, the translation was never undertaken and the type never used. Young's death thus marked the end of the Mormon experimentation with English spelling reforms.|$|E
5|$|In the 1860s and 1870s, {{the city}} {{became a major}} {{outfitting}} center for the major trails that went across Nebraska, including the Oregon, California and Mormon Trails. Jobbers Canyon was built in Downtown Omaha {{for the purpose of}} outfitting these migrants. Stagecoach lines had <b>arrived</b> <b>by</b> 1858, including the Local Stage Coach Company in 1857, and the Western Stage Company which began its easterly and westerly routes in Omaha. The Pony Express and Wells Fargo lines maintained offices in the city.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 27 April 1965, a crack {{battalion}} of Indonesian soldiers launched a surprise attack on 'B' Company, 2nd Battalion of the Parachute Regiment in their base at Plaman Mapu.

Acting commanding officer Sergeant-Major John Williams received a Distinguished Conduct Medal {{for his role in the}} action. Relief units soon <b>arrived</b> <b>by</b> helicopter, but the battle had concluded by this point.|$|E

5|$|Mitchell's tour {{in support}} of her {{critically}} acclaimed Court and Spark album arrived in London in April 1974. While backstage at her and Scott's show at the New Victoria Theatre, Harrison invited the {{five members of the}} L.A. Express to come out to his Oxfordshire home, Friar Park, the following day. Bennett recalls that they <b>arrived</b> <b>by</b> limousine and he mistook the property's grand gatehouse for the main residence.|$|E
5|$|Reinforcements <b>arrived</b> <b>by</b> glider around 04:00 (Mission Chicago and Mission Detroit), and 21:00 (Mission Keokuk and Mission Elmira), {{bringing}} additional {{troops and}} heavy equipment. Like the paratroopers, many landed {{far from their}} drop zones. Even those that landed on target experienced difficulty, with heavy cargo such as Jeeps shifting during landing, crashing through the wooden fuselage, {{and in some cases}} crushing personnel on board.|$|E
5|$|The 1965 {{tour was}} highly successful, with well-attended concerts {{on each of}} its ten dates.

After the 1965 tour's final concert, which took place at Cow Palace, San Francisco, the Beatles accepted an invitation to visit Elvis Presley {{before returning to the}} UK.|$|E

5|$|The 2nd Parachute Brigade <b>arrived</b> <b>by</b> sea at Naples on 28August. From {{there they}} moved to Rome on 3 September, and on 8September, to a camp near Taranto in {{preparation}} for their next mission. During Operation Rugby the 2nd Parachute Brigade recorded 362 casualties; 51 dead, 130 wounded and 181 missing. Most of the missing eventually returned to the brigade and only 126 replacements were required to bring the brigade back up to strength.|$|E
5|$|The Eretrian {{strategy}} was to defend their walls, and undergo a siege. Possibly {{this was the only}} plan that could be agreed on, or became the default option when no plan was agreed. At any rate, since the Persian army had only suffered two defeats in the last century, and since a Greek army had never successfully fought the Persians, this was probably a sensible strategy. Since the Persians <b>arrived</b> <b>by</b> ship, it is probable they had little siege equipment, and indeed, they had already been foiled in the siege of Lindos earlier in the expedition.|$|E
5|$|The {{buildings}} stand above a {{warren of}} tunnels: previously, live animals {{were brought to}} market by hoof (from the mid-19th century onwards they <b>arrived</b> <b>by</b> rail) and were slaughtered on site. The former railway tunnels are now used for storage, parking and as basements. An impressive cobbled ramp spirals down around West Smithfield's public garden, {{on the south side}} of the Market, providing access to part of this area. Some of the buildings on Charterhouse Street on Smithfield north side maintain access to the tunnels via their basements.|$|E

5|$|The division's two {{parachute}} brigades, {{landing in}} the early hours of 6June, were scattered across the countryside during the parachute drop. Most of the battalions could only muster around sixty per cent or less of their total strength on the drop zones (DZ). They did carry out all of their objectives, however, before the 6th Airlanding Brigade <b>arrived</b> <b>by</b> gliders to reinforce them at 21:00 that evening.|$|E

He faced Yokozuna for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam 1993; he won the match by countout but did not win the title. Lex Luger and Bret Hart each earned a title match against Yokozuna the following year at WrestleMania X. Luger was disqualified in his match, but Hart won the championship later that night.|$|E
