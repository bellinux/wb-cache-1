50|$|Having the {{grandson}} of Leo Tolstoy {{involved in the project}} helped Marineland become a very fashionable destination in its early days, prompting writers Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, John Dos Passos, and Ernest Hemingway to visit Moby Dick's Bar located there. Ms. Rawlings was married to Norton Baskin who at one time (1950s/early 1960s) was the operator/manager of the Dolphin Restaurant/Moby Dick Lounge. The park's facilities were very popular with tourists and also used for numerous movies, including Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954) and Revenge of the Creature (1955). Trained dolphins became an additional attraction in the early 1950s as Marineland became one of Florida's major attractions, attracting over 900,000 visitors per year with peak attendance in the mid-1970s. The opening of Walt Disney World Resort in 1971 gave a major boost to the attraction's annual attendance. However, Sea World's entry into the Florida market eventually had a very negative impact on Marineland from the late 1970s through the 2009. Many publications erroneously note the peak attendance as having been 300,000. The break-even <b>admission</b> <b>point</b> was actually 400,000, however, even during the 1950s.|$|E

Patients (n= 78) of both sexes, with age group between 10 and 50 years and with first and second degree of burn of less than 50 % of TBSA (Total body surface area) {{were included in the}} study, over a period of 2 years (2006 - 08). After stabilization, patients were randomly attributed into two groups: ‘honey group’ and ‘SSD group’. Time elapsed since burn was recorded. After washing with normal saline, undiluted pure honey was applied over the wounds of patients in the honey group (n= 37) and SSD cream over the wounds of patients in SSD group (n= 41), everyday. Wound was dressed with sterile gauze, cotton pads and bandaged. Status of the wound was assessed every third and seventh day and on the day of completion of study. Patients were followed up every fortnight till epithelialization. The bacteriological examination of the wound was done every seventh day. The mean age for case (honey group) and control (SSD group) was 34. 5 years and 28. 5 years, respectively. Wound swab culture was positive in 29 out of 36 patients who came within 8 hours of burn and in all patients who came after 24 hours. The average duration of healing in patients treated with honey and SSD dressing at any time of admission was 18. 16 and 32. 68 days, respectively. Wound of all those patients (100 %) who reported within 1 hour became sterile with honey dressing in less than 7 days while none with SSD. All of the wounds became sterile in less than 21 days with honey, while tthis was so in only 36. 5 % with SSD treated wounds. The honey group included 33 patients reported within 24 hour of injury, and 26 out of them had complete outcome at 2 months of follow-up, while numbers for the SSD group were 32 and 12. Complete outcome for any <b>admission</b> <b>point</b> of time after 2 months was noted in 81 % and 37 % of patients in the honey group and the SSD group. Honey dressing improves wound healing, makes the wound sterile in lesser time, has a better outcome in terms of prevention of hypertrophic scarring and post-burn contractures, and decreases the need of debridement irrespective of time of admission, when compared to SSD dressing...|$|E
40|$|Summary: The new school-leaving certificate, the National Senior Certificate (NSC), {{was awarded}} {{for the first}} time in 2008. This necessitated a relook at the {{entrance}} requirements for university, as the school subjects offered, and the evaluation thereof, had changed considerably compared with those for the previous schoolleaving certificate (Senior Certificate). It became important for universities to adjust their admission requirements from the 2009 firstyear intake onwards. The admission requirements of nine universities (considered by FinWeek, 18 March 2010, to be similar in terms of effectiveness and classification) were compared. The universities are: the University of the Free State (UOFS), the University of the Western Cape (UWC/WestCapU), the University of KwaZuluNatal (UKZN), the University of Pretoria (UP/UPret), NorthWest University (NWU/NWestU), the University of the Witwatersrand (WITS/UWits), the University of Cape Town (UCT), Rhodes University (Rhodes/RhodesU) and the University of Stellenbosch (US/UStell). (The second abbreviation appearing in some cases is the abbreviation used in Figure 1, which was taken directly from Finweek.) Effectiveness is defined by FinWeek as a combination of the following: undergraduate success rate; graduates as percentage of total enrolment; research output units and contracted research, while classification of institutions is defined as a range from mainly undergraduate training institutions to mainly researchled institutions. This study considered how the nine selected South African universities utilise the NSC results to select students for their mathematical statistics and computer science degrees. Some of the universities use only the NSC results for placement, while others use a combination of the NSC results and some additional admission tests. At most universities the NSC results are combined into an <b>admission</b> <b>point</b> score (APS). This APS is calculated differently at the different universities. The following questions were investigated:  How is the APS calculated by each of the nine universities considered in this study?  What minimum APS is required for general entrance to undergraduate studies at these universities?  What minimum APS do students need to enter a three-year programme in mathematical statistics or computer science at these nine universities? To compare the admission requirements of the universities considered, the entrance requirements documents of the various universities were studied and compared. Furthermore, secondary data of the University of the Western Cape were used to illustrate the differences in the APSs for these universities. A sample of 176 students who matriculated in 2008 with six or more designated NSC subjects and who were in their first year at UWC in 2009 was considered for this study. The UWC data were used to calculate the APSs according to the 2011 admission requirements of the nine universities. In general, students have to offer a minimum of four subjects from the designated subject list, with a level 4 (≥ 50 percent) or more, to qualify for university admission. For this study only students who had completed six or more designated subjects were considered. To further contain the study, only students that could possibly have qualified for a mathematical statistics or computer science degree were considered. These programmes require school mathematics and not mathematical literacy as a subject. Both these programmes are offered at all the universities considered in this study and could, therefore, be compared. The method for calculating the APS differs substantially between the universities, as does the minimum score required for university admission. To compare the minimum required APS for admission to the respective selected universities the research data of 176 UWC students were used. It was found that only 11 percent of the 176 students admitted to UWC would have qualified for admission at UCT. Although UWC and Rhodes use similar methods for calculating their APSs they have very different minimum APS requirements: Rhodes requires an APS of 40, whereas UWC requires an APS of only 27. Consequently Rhodes would have accepted only 18 percent of the students that were accepted by UWC. Due to the stricter mathematics requirement for the programmes considered, fewer students qualify for these programmes than would have qualified for general university admission. In order to see what APS would be necessary for a student studying at UWC to successfully complete a first year, the 2009 end-of-year university results of the 176 students of this pilot study were used. Of the 176 UWC students that started their studies in 2009, only 108 (61 percent) progressed to the next academic year in 2010. Their average UWC APS was 41, 4 with a 95 percent confidence interval of (40, 4; 42, 3). If a simplified method is used for calculating the APS, namely summing the school scores (without life orientation (LO)), the 95 percent confidence interval for the mean APS of the students that progressed is (30, 4; 32, 1). It needs to be noted that both UWC and Rhodes use a more complex method of calculating the APS which inflates the APS by approximately 10 points. Currently universities differ considerably in their calculation of the APS as well as their minimum entrance requirements. A simplified and standardised method for the calculation of the APS would allow learners and other stakeholders to easily determine the APS required to be selected for a particular tertiary programme. For most programmes further school subject requirements are specified. For the mathematical statistics and computer science programmes at the universities studied, the difference in the school mathematics requirement is most pronounced. According to this pilot study the APS a student requires to successfully complete the first academic year at UWC, is approximately 30 when the simplified method to calculate the APS is used (summing the scores of six designated school subjects (without LO)). An APS of 30 is currently being used by UP, UKZN and UFS as the minimum requirement for selection. Their method of calculating the APS is very similar to the method proposed by this study. Additional studies would need to be carried out to confirm the results of this pilot study. Further studies are also needed to determine how the scores of the nondesignated subjects should be adjusted for possible inclusion in the calculation of the APS. The NSC is now standardised across South Africa. If the APS is also calculated in a standardised manner it should be sufficient to use this information to determine which students would be able to succeed at university. The minimum admission requirement could vary from university to university depending on the programme for which a student applies. The minimum APS for a programme should be carefully considered and adjusted so that selected students have a chance to succeed. If academically underprepared students are selected for tertiary studies the universities should be aware that these students will need extensive extracurricular assistance. Without additional interventions these underprepared students will have no chance of succeeding at university, which is ethically unjustifiable.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} prediction of the unequal admission performance of a double entry turbine based on the full admission turbine maps and a minimal number of unequal <b>admission</b> <b>points.</b> The double entry turbine has two separate inlet ports which feed a single turbine wheel: this arrangement can be beneficial in a turbocharger application; however the additional entry does add complexity in producing a complete turbine map which includes unequal admission behavior. When a double entry turbine is operated under full admission conditions, with both entries feeding the turbine equally, this will act effectively as a single entry device and the turbine performance can be represented by a standard turbine map. In reality a multiple entry turbine will spend the majority of time operating under varying degrees of unequal admission, with each entry feeding the turbine different amounts; the extent of this inequality can have a considerable impact on turbine performance. In order to produce a full map which extends from full admission through to the partial admission case (where one inlet has no flow) {{a large number of}} unequal <b>admission</b> data <b>points</b> are required. The paper starts by discussing previous attempts to describe the partial and unequal admission performance of a double entry turbine. The full unequal admission performance is then presented for a nozzled, double entry turbine. The impact of unequal admission on turbine performance is demonstrated. Under some conditions of operation, the turbine efficiency may be less than half that of the equivalent full admission case based on the average turbine velocity ratio. A method of using the steady, equal admission maps, with a limited number of unequal <b>admission</b> data <b>points,</b> to predict the full unequal admission behavior is presented. A good agreement is found when the map extension method is validated against the full unequal admission turbine performance measured on a test stand. In the prediction of efficiency a mean error of approximately 0. 39 % is found between the test stand data and the proposed extrapolation method, {{with a standard deviation of}} 2. 79 %.

Methods. This study included 240 patients aged ≥ 65 years with community acquired pneumonia. On admission, demographic characteristics, underlying diseases, physical symptoms and findings, laboratory values, chest radiography and oxygen blood saturation (SaO 2) were analyzed. Multivariate analysis was used to identify characteristic prognostic factors which showed a statistical significance in relation to mortality. Results. Altered mental status, respiratory frequency ≥ 23 /min and the presence of bilateral pneumonic infiltrates were defined as the most important prognostic factors of mortality (p < 0. 001). These factors displayed 57. 89 % sensitivity, 100 % specificity and 93. 33 % accuracy. Conclusion.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{investigate}} {{the short term}} effects of air pollution on the respiratory morbidity of children living in São Paulo, Brazil, {{one of the largest}} cities in the developing world.  METHODS—Daily counts of hospital admissions due to respiratory diseases along with daily levels of meteorological variables and air pollutants (PM 10, SO 2, NO 2, O 3, and CO) were analysed with Poisson regression. Final models were adjusted for the effects of time trends, seasonal patterns, weekdays, holidays, meteorological factors, and serial correlation.  RESULTS—Daily admissions of children to hospital for total respiratory disease and pneumonia showed significant increases associated with O 3 (5 - 8 %), NO 2 (9 %), and with PM 10 (9 %) (results are for an increase from the 10 th to the 90 th percentile of pollution measurements). Consistently, effects for pneumonia were greater than for all respiratory diseases combined. Also, effects on infants (children < 1 year old) presented higher estimates. Similar associations were found for asthma <b>admissions.</b> <b>Point</b> estimates for most pollutants were higher for asthma than for other diagnosed admissions. However, these associations were not significant.  CONCLUSIONS—These results agree with the limited publications on this subject but indicate a rather smaller magnitude of effects.
