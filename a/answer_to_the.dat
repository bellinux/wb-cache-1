5|$|Among {{the most}} {{controversial}} areas of interpretation of John is its sacramental theology. Scholars' views have fallen along a wide spectrum ranging from anti-sacramental and non-sacramental, to sacramental, to ultra-sacramental and hyper-sacramental. Scholars disagree both on whether and how frequently John refers to the sacraments at all, and {{on the degree of}} importance he places upon them. Individual scholars' answers to one of these questions do not always correspond to their <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other.|$|E

5|$|The key {{difference}} between QA technology and document search is that document search takes a keyword query and returns {{a list of}} documents, ranked in order of relevance to the query (often based on popularity and page ranking), while QA technology takes a question expressed in natural language, seeks to understand it in much greater detail, and returns a precise <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> question.|$|E

5|$|A spin-off, The Colbert Report, was {{announced}} in early May 2005. The show starred former correspondent Stephen Colbert, and served as Comedy Central's <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> programs of media pundits such as Bill O'Reilly. Colbert, Stewart, and Ben Karlin developed {{the idea for the}} show based on a series of faux television commercials that had been created for an earlier Daily Show segment. They pitched the concept to Comedy Central chief Doug Herzog, who agreed to run the show for eight weeks without first creating a pilot. The Colbert Report premiered on October 17, 2005 and aired following The Daily Show for nine years. Initial ratings satisfied Comedy Central and less than three weeks after its debut the show was renewed for a year. The Colbert Report was produced by Jon Stewart's production company, Busboy Productions.|$|E
5|$|Alberto Contador {{rode the}} Giro with full {{knowledge}} {{that he was to}} <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) regarding his positive test for clenbuterol at the 2010 Tour de France, since his national federation cleared him of doping charges but both the UCI and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) chose to appeal the ruling. He rode and won with the most dominant Grand Tour performance of his career, and later rode a relatively normal and full 2011 season as his CAS date was continually pushed back. It was originally scheduled for June, to occur soon enough to decide conclusively his status prior to the 2011 Tour de France, but it was instead pushed back to August and then again to November.|$|E
5|$|As {{reports of}} the grave {{registration}} work became public, the Commission began to receive letters of enquiry and requests for photographs of graves from relatives of deceased soldiers. By 1917, 17,000 photographs had been dispatched to relatives. In March 1915, the Commission, {{with the support of}} the Red Cross, began to dispatch photographic prints and cemetery location information in <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> requests. The Graves Registration Commission became the Directorate of Graves Registration and Enquiries in the spring of 1916 in recognition of the fact that the scope of work began to extend beyond simple grave registration and began to include responding to enquiries from relatives of those killed. The directorate's work was also extended beyond the Western Front and into other theatres of war, with units deployed in Greece, Egypt and Mesopotamia.|$|E

5|$|Faulkner's Dublin Journal, a {{newspaper}} established in 1725, featured many articles written by Swift or inspired by writings of Swift. Between 1727 and 1730, Faulkner published many works attributed to Swift, but many were actually written by others. After 1730, {{only one of}} those works printed by Faulkner under Swift's name {{turned out to be}} written by someone besides Swift, which suggests to some critics that Swift was working with Faulkner to ensure that only authentic works were printed under Swift's name. He was the first to publish The <b>Answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Craftsman, Swift's final defense of the Irish economy from England's policies. Faulkner was also the first to publish the collected Drapier's Letters as Fraud Detected on 2 October 1725. Faulkner also helped edit An Epistle upon an Epistle around December 1729.|$|E
5|$|However, {{this theory}} allowed a {{compound}} symmetry CP to be conserved. CP combines parity P (switching left to right) with charge conjugation C (switching particles with antiparticles). Physicists were again surprised when in 1964, James Cronin and Val Fitch provided clear evidence in kaon decays that CP symmetry could be broken too, winning them the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physics. In 1973, Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa showed that CP violation in the weak interaction required {{more than two}} generations of particles, effectively predicting {{the existence of a}} then unknown third generation. This discovery earned them half of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics. Unlike parity violation, CP violation occurs in {{only a small number of}} instances, but remains widely held as an <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> difference between the amount of matter and antimatter in the universe; it thus forms one of Andrei Sakharov's three conditions for baryogenesis.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, Mani {{directed}} Nayagan starring Kamal Haasan, and {{the film}} became a huge success and brought him recognition at the national level. Inspired by the 1972 American crime film, The Godfather, the film {{was based on the}} real-life story of underworld don Varadarajan Mudaliar, and tells the story of an orphaned slum-dweller and his rise to top of the Mumbai underworld hierarchy, was included in Time magazine's All-Time 100 Greatest Movies in 2005. Satyajit Ray's The Apu Trilogy and Guru Dutt's Pyaasa are the only other Indian films that have appeared in the list. Indian critics dubbed the film as India's <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>The</b> Godfather. Nayagan was both commercially successful and critically acclaimed winning three National Awards—Best Actor, Best Cinematography and Best Art Direction—at the 35th National Film Awards. The film was India's official entry to the Oscars for Best Foreign Language Film at the 60th Academy Awards.|$|E

5|$|Negation is {{done with}} the adverb not, which precedes the main verb and follows an {{auxiliary}} verb. A contracted form of not -n't {{can be used as}} an enclitic attaching to auxiliary verbs and to the copula verb to be. Just as with questions, many negative constructions require the negation to occur with do-support, thus in Modern English I don't know him is the correct <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> question Do you know him?, but not *I know him not, although this construction may be found in older English.|$|E
5|$|On 24 November, {{some of the}} French ships {{traveled}} to Tangier, where they picked up Consul Julius Doazan and his secretary, Fleurat, on Narval. Later that evening, Caton reached Salé and offered safe passage to Rabat for the British consul Elton and his family, {{in anticipation of the}} bombardment of the city. The following day, at 11:00a.m., Caton anchored between the cities of Rabat and Salé. Its commander demanded an apology over the thefts and raids and immediate repayment for the stolen goods, under threat of bombardment. The rais in the ports of both cities promised to <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> French demands within three hours. Two hours later, all of the French ships had reached the mouth of the Bou Regreg, between Rabat and Salé.|$|E
5|$|The SEAD {{campaign}} was halted, but although the IAF possessed no operational <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> massive air defence array forming {{west of the}} Canal, it nevertheless still enjoyed supremacy in the air-ro-air arena. On July 30, 69 Squadron took part in Operation Rimon 20, a ruse designed to draw Soviet-flown MiG-21s into battle. In the ensuing dogfight, five Soviet fighters were downed, of which one was shot down by Avihu Ben-Nun with Shaul Levi and another by Aviem Sella with Reuven Reshef. With no side securing a clear advantage, yet both able to claim military achievements, American pressure soon bore fruit and a ceasefire marking {{the end of the}} war came into effect on August 7, 1970.|$|E

Laura succumbs to the nerve agent after finding the clue {{revealing}} Daniel's identity. Addison and Amanda abandon him, but Amanda returns after finding Jonas' body. Addison finds a glass box housing an antidote, but her arms become trapped in the arm holes which are lined with hidden blades, and Xavier leaves her to die after reading her number. Amanda and Daniel find a tunnel in the safe room which leads to a dilapidated bathroom with two rotting corpses. Daniel collapses inside just before Xavier finds them. Amanda notes that he can't read his own number, and he cuts the skin from his neck. As he approaches, Daniel, who feigned his collapse, jumps up and slashes his neck with a hacksaw, killing him.|$|E
5|$|In {{early summer}} 1165, Pope Alexander III wrote twice to Foliot, {{ordering}} him to intercede {{with the king}} and protest the royal injunction against appeals to the papacy. Foliot replied that the king respected the pope, heard his protests carefully, and that the archbishop had not been expelled, but had left of his own accord. Foliot wrote that the king had said Becket was free to return at any time, but {{would still have to}} <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> charges he had faced at Northampton. Foliot then advised the pope not to impose any sentences of excommunication and to be patient and continue to negotiate. In 1166, Foliot accused Becket of simony, or the purchase of church offices, basing this on the alleged purchase Becket had made of the chancellorship, although {{there is no evidence that}} Becket bought the office. By 1166, the king had made Foliot the head of the English Church, in fact if not in law. The king and Foliot got along well, and it was probably Foliot's influence that kept the king from more violent measures against Becket.|$|E
