40|$|Two major {{features}} of the overcorrection procedure, restitution and positive practice, were analyzed for their educative and suppressive properties {{in the treatment of}} profoundly retarded adults. Positive practice techniques that were topographically similar and dissimilar to the target behavior were studied. Eating behavior and puzzle performance were observed. Restitutional overcorrection and both forms of positive practice were effective for suppressing inappropriate <b>behaviors.</b> Even when <b>appropriate</b> <b>behaviors</b> had been acquired by positive practice, restitution and dissimilar positive practice were generally ineffective for increasing their rate of occurrence. However, topographically similar positive practice was successful as a means of teaching new <b>appropriate</b> <b>behaviors...</b>|$|R

25|$|Organizational {{culture has}} been {{described}} as a set of assumptions shared by individuals in an organization; the assumptions influence the interpretation and actions that define <b>appropriate</b> <b>behavior</b> for various situations. Organizational {{culture has been}} shown to affect important organizational outcomes such as performance, attraction, recruitment, retention, employee satisfaction, and employee well-being. There are three levels of organizational culture: artifacts, shared values, and basic beliefs and assumptions. Artifacts comprise the physical components of the organization that relay cultural meaning. Shared values are individuals' preferences regarding certain aspects of the organization's culture (e.g., loyalty, customer service). Basic beliefs and assumptions include individuals' impressions about the trustworthiness and supportiveness of an organization, and are often deeply ingrained within the organization's culture.|$|E
25|$|West and Central African {{religious}} practices generally manifest themselves in communal ceremonies or divinatory rites in {{which members of}} the community, overcome by force (or ashe, nyama, etc.), are excited {{to the point of}} going into meditative trance in response to rhythmic or mantric drumming or singing. One religious ceremony practiced in Gabon and Cameroon is the Okuyi, practiced by several Bantu ethnic groups. In this state, depending upon the region, drumming or instrumental rhythms played by respected musicians (each of which is unique to a given deity or ancestor), participants embody a deity or ancestor, energy or state of mind by performing distinct ritual movements or dances which further enhance their elevated consciousness. When this trance-like state is witnessed and understood, practitioners are privy to a way of contemplating the pure or symbolic embodiment of a particular mindset or frame of reference. This builds skills at separating the feelings elicited by this mindset from their situational manifestations in daily life. Such separation and subsequent contemplation of the nature and sources of pure energy or feelings serves to help participants manage and accept them when they arise in mundane contexts. This facilitates better control and transformation of these energies into positive, culturally <b>appropriate</b> <b>behavior,</b> thought, and speech. Further, this practice can also give rise to those in these trances uttering words which, when interpreted by a culturally educated initiate or diviner, can provide insight into appropriate directions which the community (or individual) might take in accomplishing its goal.|$|E

500|$|Sesame Street's creators {{recognized}} that television lent itself {{well to the}} use of modelling as a teaching tool. They understood that children tended to imitate what they saw on the screen, so many writing and production methods were used to directly model effective verbal communication. Indirect modeling, without explicit labeling, was used to demonstrate positive behaviors as well. [...] One of the positive behaviors they modeled was inquisitiveness and the enjoyment of learning. [...] If humor, for example, interfered with the intended instructional message or exhibited inappropriate behavior, it was removed. As Muppet performer Fran Brill explained, the show's puppeteers demonstrated emotions by banging their puppets' heads against the wall or by having them fall backwards, but when research found that these behaviors did not demonstrate good models of <b>appropriate</b> <b>behavior,</b> these behaviors were changed. The Muppet Roosevelt Franklin, for example, was removed from the show because many leaders in the African American community felt that he displayed negative cultural stereotypes.|$|E

Typically, parents learn to reward <b>appropriate</b> <b>behavior</b> through social rewards (such as praise, smiles, and hugs) as well as concrete rewards (such as stickers or points towards a larger reward as part of an incentive system created collaboratively with the child). In addition, parents learn to select simple behaviors as an initial focus and reward each of the small steps that their child achieves towards reaching a larger goal (this concept is called [...] "successive approximations").|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: To {{compare the}} number of <b>appropriate</b> <b>behaviors</b> for tooth {{brushing}} before and after a playful learning intervention with preschool children. Method: A quasi-experimental, quantitative, before and after study design was conducted in an early childhood educational institution, with children between three and five years of age. The intervention consisted of three meetings with educational activities about tooth brushing, whose outcome was evaluated by means of observation of ten behaviors suitable for tooth brushing. Results: Forty-four children participated in the study. The mean of adequate behaviors was 4. 4 before the intervention, and 8. 5 after the intervention. A {{significant increase in the}} adoption of <b>appropriate</b> <b>behaviors</b> for tooth brushing (p < 0. 01) was identified.

5000|$|PBIS is {{an acronym}} for Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports. [...] Effective {{classroom}} management and discipline are essential for teaching and learning. PBIS emphasizes the integrated use of classroom management and school-wide discipline strategies coupled with effective academic instruction to create a positive and safe school climate for all students. PBIS is based in a behaviorist psychology approach to improving student behavior, which means that teachers and students identify misbehavior, model <b>appropriate</b> <b>behaviors,</b> and provide clear consequences for behavior in the classroom context. In a PBIS model, schools must define, teach, and reinforce <b>appropriate</b> <b>behaviors</b> to ensure success. Research shows that punishing students inconsistently without a positive alternative, is ineffective and only offers short-term solutions. Modeling and rewarding positive behaviors are more effective. The goal of PBIS {{is to establish a}} positive school climate. To do this, a continuum of behavior support has been established which can be applied at the school level (primary level), for small groups of students (secondary level), and for individual level (tertiary level).|$|R
