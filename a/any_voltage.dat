25|$|Stray voltage is the {{occurrence}} of electrical potential between two objects that ideally should not have <b>any</b> <b>voltage</b> difference between them. Small voltages often exist between two grounded objects in separate locations, due to normal current flow in the power system. Large voltages can appear on the enclosures of electrical equipment due to a fault in the electrical power system, such as a failure of insulation.|$|E
5000|$|Most mains-powered {{electrical}} equipment, {{though it}} may specify a single nominal voltage, actually has a range of tolerance above and below that point. Thus, devices usually {{can be used on}} either <b>any</b> <b>voltage</b> from approx. 100 to 120 V, or <b>any</b> <b>voltage</b> from approx. 210 to 240 V. In such cases, voltage converters need only be specified to convert <b>any</b> <b>voltage</b> within one range, to a voltage within the other, rather than separate converters being needed for all possible pairs of nominal voltages (110-220, 117-220, 110-230, etc.) ...|$|E

5000|$|As each PoweredUSB plug {{provides}} one {{of three}} voltages, the plugs come keyed in three versions, {{so that they will}} only accept connections from devices requiring that version's voltage. The connectors can be color-coded for different voltages: Gray (Pantone Cool Gray 1C) (sometimes also [...] "nature" [...] or yellow) for 5 V, blue-green (Pantone Teal 3262C) for 12 V, red (Pantone Red 032C) for 24 V/25 V and violet for 19 V; alternatively, <b>any</b> <b>voltages</b> higher than 5 V can be indicated by a black connector color.|$|R

The device, consisting of a cathode (target), anode, magnetic system and power supply, is designed {{in such a way}} that the target consists of at least two isolated subtargets to which <b>any</b> <b>voltages</b> can be applied. The subtargets are attached to heat sinks which are also isolated. Magnetic units are arranged opposite to the target side of the substrate and they are coupled to the heat sinks by means of pole shoes. A realtive movement is possible between the magnetic units and the targets comprising the heat sinks...|$|R

50|$|In the United States 2011 National Electrical Code (NEC) is the {{standard}} regulating most electrical installations. There are no definitions relating to high voltage. The NEC® covers voltages 600 volts and less and that over 600 volts. The National Electrical Manufacturer's Association (NEMA) defines high voltage as over 100kV to 230kV. British Standard BS 7671:2008 defines high voltage as <b>any</b> <b>voltage</b> difference between conductors that is higher than 1000 V AC or 1500 V ripple-free DC, or <b>any</b> <b>voltage</b> difference between a conductor and Earth that is higher than 600 V AC or 900 V ripple-free DC.|$|E

50|$|Johnson-Nyquist noise (sometimes thermal, Johnson or Nyquist noise) is unavoidable, and {{generated}} by the random thermal motion of charge carriers (usually electrons), inside an electrical conductor, which happens regardless of <b>any</b> applied <b>voltage.</b>|$|R
50|$|The drivers provide TIA-232 {{voltage level}} outputs (about ±7.5 volts) {{from a single}} 5-volt supply by on-chip charge pumps and {{external}} capacitors. This makes it useful for implementing TIA-232 in devices that otherwise do not need <b>any</b> other <b>voltages.</b>|$|R
50|$|Line traps are {{connected}} {{in series with}} power line and thus their coils are rated to carry the full line current. The impedance of a line trap is very low at the power frequency and will not cause <b>any</b> significant <b>voltage</b> drop.|$|R
50|$|Two trivial {{cases are}} worth noting: A nullator in {{parallel}} with a norator is equivalent to a short (zero voltage any current) and a nullator in series with a norator is an open circuit (zero current, <b>any</b> <b>voltage).</b>|$|E
50|$|In principle, if the Norton {{equivalent}} {{current source}} {{was replaced with}} a Norton equivalent voltage source, a VNIC of equivalent magnitude could be placed in series with the voltage source's series resistance. <b>Any</b> <b>voltage</b> drop across the series resistance would then be added back to the circuit by the VNIC. However, a VNIC implemented as above with an operational amplifier must terminate on an electrical ground, and so this use is not practical. Because <b>any</b> <b>voltage</b> source with nonzero series resistance can be represented as an equivalent current source with finite parallel resistance, an INIC will typically be placed in parallel with a source when used to improve the impedance of the source.|$|E
50|$|High voltage {{is defined}} as <b>any</b> <b>voltage</b> over 1000 volts. Cables for 3000 and 6000 volts exist, but the {{majority}} of cables are used from 10 kV and upward. Those of 10 to 33 kV are usually called medium voltage cables, those over 50 kV high voltage cables.|$|E

50|$|To {{reduce the}} risk of <b>any</b> <b>voltage</b> surge it is {{desirable}} to replace the Korndörfer motor starter circuit with an autotransformer that has a central switch circuit that disconnects redundant windings of the first starting stage from the circuit at the transition, thereby preventing any step-up transformer connection and voltage escalation.|$|E
50|$|A {{transmission}} gate {{is similar}} to a relay that can conduct in both directions or block by a control signal with almost <b>any</b> <b>voltage</b> potential.

50|$|Insulation {{failure is}} a {{stochastic}} process {{and it is}} erroneous to identify single events and attribute this to a particular source.

Better tests will be better predictors of condition but no tests should be considered infallible.|$|E
40|$|The system {{approach}} to placement of transformer substations in the UPSS is developed. The mathematical and geometrical modeling of TS service areas {{in view of}} correct hexagons is made. The practical calculating of dependences of service areas and radiuses from load density for 110 / 10 kV transformer substations is made. The model-templates to placement TS of <b>any</b> <b>voltages</b> in the city territory are developed and theoretical expressions for calculations of geometrical sizes are received. The calculation program Microsoft EXCEL and the graphic computer program AutoCAD are offered to automate the process of arranging the service area at Masterplan on the city.
