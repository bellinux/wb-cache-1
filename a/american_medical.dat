5|$|He {{drew from}} his medical {{training}} to discredit popular ideas about {{differences among the}} races. In 1843 he gave a lecture series, Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of the Races, to demonstrate the failings of phrenology, which was a so-called scientific practice {{of the time that}} was applied in a way to draw racist conclusions and attribute negative characteristics to ethnic Africans. He rejected the practice of homeopathy, an alternative to the scientific medicine being taught in universities. Although he had a successful medical career, he was not admitted to the <b>American</b> <b>Medical</b> Association or local associations because of racial discrimination.|$|E
5|$|Obesity is {{a leading}} {{preventable}} cause of death worldwide, with increasing rates in adults and children. In 2015, 600 million adults (12%) and 100 million children were obese.

Obesity is stigmatized in much of the modern world (particularly in the Western world), though it was seen as a symbol of wealth and fertility at other times in history and still is in some parts of the world. In 2013, the <b>American</b> <b>Medical</b> Association classified obesity as a disease.|$|E

Two people, whose identities were withheld, were selected to administer individual injections, of which only one was lethal so that neither would know with certainty who executed the prisoner. The prison selected among paramedics or nurses because the <b>American</b> <b>Medical</b> Association prohibits licensed physicians from participating in executions. A mild sedative was delivered intravenously to calm Parsons before the deadly drugs were administered.|$|E

5|$|A {{position}} paper {{published by the}} American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in 2007 warns {{that there is no}} valid medical reason to perform the procedure, which is not considered routine or accepted by the College; and it has not been proven to be safe or effective. The potential risks include sexual dysfunction, infection, altered sensation, dyspareunia, adhesions and scarring. The College position is that it is untenable to recommend the procedure. The procedure is also not approved by the Food and Drug Administration or the <b>American</b> <b>Medical</b> Association, and no peer-reviewed studies have been accepted to account for either safety or effectiveness of this treatment.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{licensed}} to practise {{medicine in the}} United States, he began testing the boxes on human beings diagnosed with cancer and schizophrenia. In one case the test had to be stopped prematurely because the subject heard a rumour that Reich was insane; there were stories, which were false, {{that he had been}} hospitalized in the Utica State Mental Hospital. In another case the father of an eight-year-old girl with cancer approached him for help, then complained to the <b>American</b> <b>Medical</b> Association that he was practising without a licence. He asked his supporters to stick with him through the criticism, believing that he had developed a grand unified theory of physical and mental health.|$|E
5|$|By the 1940s it was {{recognized}} that this arrangement was unsatisfactory. The <b>American</b> <b>Medical</b> Association conducted {{a series of}} studies in 1948, followed by a Department of the Interior study in 1950. They highlighted the deficiencies of the program: commitment procedures in Alaska were archaic, and the long trip to Portland had a negative effect on patients and their families. In addition, an audit of the hospital contract found that the Sanatorium Company, which owned the hospital, had been padding its expenses. This had enabled it to make an excess profit of $69,000 per year (equivalent to over $588,000 per year at 2007 prices).|$|E

5|$|Charles DeWitt Watts (September 21, 1917 – July 12, 2004) was an African American {{surgeon and}} activist for the poor. Watts {{was the first}} surgeon of African American ancestry in North Carolina. Earning his medical degree in 1943 from Howard University College, {{he was the first}} African American board {{certified}} surgeon to serve in North Carolina. After surgical training at Freedman's Hospital in Washington, D.C. in 1949, he moved to Durham, North Carolina in 1950 and established a clinic to provide access to medical services for the poor. Breaking the social customs of racial obstacles, he advocated for certification of African <b>American</b> <b>medical</b> students. He also became a member of many professional colleges including the National Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine and the American College of Surgeons. He served as chief of surgery at Durham's Lincoln Hospital and was later one of the key figures in converting it to the Lincoln Community Health Center, a low-priced clinic for the poor.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with growing}} {{legal and illegal}} {{competition}} for the globally marketed ASA, Bayer worked to cement the connection between Bayer and Aspirin. One strategy it developed was to switch from distributing Aspirin powder for pharmacists to press into pill form to distributing standardized tablets—complete with the distinctive Bayer cross logo. In 1903 the company set up an American subsidiary, with a converted factory in Rensselaer, New York, to produce Aspirin for the American market without paying import duties. Bayer also sued the most egregious patent violators and smugglers. The company's attempts to hold onto its Aspirin sales incited criticism from muckraking journalists and the <b>American</b> <b>Medical</b> Association, especially after the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act that prevented trademarked drugs from being listed in the United States Pharmacopeia; Bayer listed ASA with an intentionally convoluted generic name (monoacetic acid ester of salicylic acid) to discourage doctors referring to anything but Aspirin.|$|E
5|$|Having {{finished}} her studies, Morton {{returned to the}} United States in 1902 and opened a medical practice specialising in gynecology in Washington D.C. After marrying George Morton Jr., she opened a new medical practice in New York, where he was an attorney. In 1909 the <b>American</b> <b>Medical</b> Association created a Public Health Education Committee {{with the aim of}} educating the public on subjects including health, hygiene, child care, and other medical topics; they made Morton its first chairperson. Morton was appointed as a clinical assistant and instructor at the Polyclinic Hospital of New York (where {{she was one of the}} first female faculty members), and later became a professor of gynecology. During this time she lectured at a number of other universities including a summer at the University of Vermont.|$|E
