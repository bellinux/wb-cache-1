5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the century, Gaudí was working on numerous projects simultaneously. They reflected his shift to <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>personal</b> style inspired by nature. In 1900, he received an award for the best building of the year from the Barcelona City Council for his Casa Calvet. During {{the first decade of the}} century Gaudí dedicated himself to projects like the Casa Figueras (Figueras house, better known as Bellesguard), the Park Güell, an unsuccessful urbanisation project, and the restoration of the Cathedral of Palma de Mallorca, for which he visited Majorca several times. Between 1904 and 1910 he constructed the Casa Batlló (Batlló house) and the Casa Milà (Milá house), two of his most emblematic works.|$|E
5|$|The album {{revealed}} <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>personal</b> {{side of the}} singer, {{illustrated in}} its declarative theme of emancipation from her previous marriage, and from her personal and professional setbacks. Although it shared similar vocal production {{as well as an}} inclination to her signature pop and R ballads, the album also encompassed a variety of dance-oriented and uptempo styles. It {{was meant to be a}} continuation, or a second part of her tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi (2005). Carey collaborated with a number of artists on the album, including T-Pain, Damian Marley and Young Jeezy. Though considered by critics very similar to the formula its predecessor had been built on, E=MC² included other genres she had never explored, such as reggae, and her continued recording of gospel-influenced hymns.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí's {{professional}} life was distinctive {{in that he}} never ceased to investigate mechanical building structures. Early on, Gaudí was inspired by oriental arts (India, Persia, Japan) through {{the study of the}} historicist architectural theoreticians, such as Walter Pater, John Ruskin and William Morris. The influence of the Oriental movement can be seen in works like the Capricho, the Güell Palace, the Güell Pavilions and the Casa Vicens. Later on, he adhered to the neo-Gothic movement that was in fashion at the time, following the ideas of the French architect Viollet-le-Duc. This influence is reflected in the Teresian College, the Episcopal Palace in Astorga, the Casa Botines and the Bellesguard house {{as well as in the}} crypt and the apse of the Sagrada Família. Eventually, Gaudí embarked on <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>personal</b> phase, with the organic style inspired by nature in which he would build his major works.|$|E

5|$|In {{his role}} as Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, Cunningham had to {{negotiate}} with the French Admiral Rene-Emile Godfroy for the demilitarisation and internment of a French squadron at Alexandria, in June 1940, following the Fall of France. Churchill had ordered Cunningham to prevent the French warships from leaving port, and to ensure that French warships did not pass into enemy hands. Stationed at the time at Alexandria, Cunningham entered into delicate negotiations with Godfroy to ensure his fleet, which consisted of the battleship Lorraine, four cruisers, three destroyers and a submarine, posed no threat. The Admiralty ordered Cunningham to complete the negotiations on 3 July. Just as an agreement seemed imminent Godfroy heard of the British action against the French at Mers el Kebir and, for a while, Cunningham feared a battle between French and British warships in the confines of Alexandria harbour. The deadline was overrun but negotiations ended well, after Cunningham put them on <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>personal</b> level and had the British ships appeal to their French opposite numbers. Cunningham's negotiations succeeded and the French emptied their fuel bunkers and removed the firing mechanisms from their guns. Cunningham in turn promised to repatriate the ships' crews.|$|E
