Vision and mission statements describe the organization’s goals. <b>Core</b> <b>values</b> and <b>core</b> principles represent the organization’s culture. In this paper, we have discussed a model on how a higher education institution can prosper to reach its goal of ‘creating innovators’ through its vision, mission, {{objectives and}} <b>core</b> <b>values.</b> A model for the <b>core</b> <b>values</b> required for a prospective graduate from higher educational institutions is developed, discussed and analysed. The model identifies some of the <b>core</b> <b>values</b> which are essential for a student/graduate to become successful and stand-out in his/her life. Based on the <b>core</b> <b>values,</b> a set of core principles for higher educational institutions is developed.

For the topological entropy ht(ΦE) (in the sense of Brown–Voiculescu) of the canonical completely positive map ΦE on the graph C∗-algebra, {{it is known that}} if E is finiteht(ΦE) =ht(ΦE|AE) =hb(E) =hl(E), where hb(E) (respectively, hl(E)) is the block (respectively, the loop) entropy of E. In case E is irreducible and infinite, hl(E) ⩽ht(ΦE|AE) ⩽hb(Et) is known recently, where Et is the graph E with the edges directed reversely. Then by monotonicity of entropy, hl(E) ⩽ht(ΦE) is clear. In this paper we show that ht(ΦE) ⩽hb(Et) holds for locally finite infinite graphs E. The <b>AF</b> <b>core</b> AE is known to be stably isomorphic to the graph C∗-algebra C∗(E×cZ) of certain skew product E×cZ and we also show that ht(ΦE×cZ) =ht(ΦE|AE).

40|$|Purpose–The {{concept of}} {{learning}} organization has been inspiring {{both public and}} private sectors since the early 90 s. This paper discusses the implementation of learning organization ideas along with the organization’s <b>core</b> <b>values</b> at one of the public universities in Malaysia. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to identify the components of <b>core</b> <b>values</b> that support the development and maintenance of learning organization ideas. It also aims to examine the potential integration of the learning organization idea with organizational <b>core</b> <b>values.</b> Design/methodology/approach– The study analyses the application of learning organization principles based on Örtenblad’s (2002) four understandings of learning organization, which are organizational learning, learning at work, learning climate and learning structure, along with the five <b>core</b> <b>values</b> initiatives at the university. Findings– This study suggests that the university <b>core</b> <b>values</b> and the learning organization idea work harmoniously with each other. This paper provides examples of the application of the learning organization idea and the <b>core</b> <b>values</b> attribute and how both fit into each other in one of the Malaysian public universities. A learning organization– <b>core</b> <b>values</b> matrix is proposed at the end of the paper. Research limitations/implications– This research uses the specific case of organizational <b>core</b> <b>values</b> that are established based on Islamic principles. Opportunities for further research can be a study of learning organizations in other <b>core</b> <b>values</b> environment and also from a different belief system. Practical implications– Learning organization is relevant and in harmony with Islamic environment.

The aim is on one hand {{to look at the}} widely spread use of corporate branding strategies and on the other hand, which is the main focus of this project, to explore and utilize some of the tools used in Danish pragmatic text analyses. The <b>core</b> <b>values</b> from Alfa Laval consist of 4 values and a describing text, which is presented in a brochure containing Alfa Laval’s mission, vision, <b>core</b> <b>values</b> and code of conduct. To unfold the text I examine the text genre PR texts using literature on this topic from Rita Therkelsen. The <b>core</b> <b>values</b> speech acts is analysed with {{the use of}} Jürgen Habermas and a part of his language philosophy. Alfa Laval’s <b>core</b> <b>values</b> do not have a consistent use of pronouns, and to examine the possible consequences of this breach I use Ole Togeby’s work on Danish functional grammar. To define <b>core</b> <b>values</b> and corporate branding strategies, I use Ole Thyssen and Lars Thøger Christensen and Mette Morsing. The focus of my analysis is whether it is an appropriate way to formulate the <b>core</b> <b>values</b> as a regulative speech act, with a breach in the use of pronouns, based on the knowledge of how <b>core</b> <b>values</b> are used in a corporate branding strategy. At the end of the analysis I make two new suggestions on how to formulate the <b>core</b> <b>values.</b> The conclusion is that it is recommended to use a constative speech act, and to be consistent in the use of pronouns in the <b>core</b> <b>values,</b> so that the ownership of the <b>core</b> <b>values</b> remains clear...|$|R

A pre-test, post-test design was used to evaluate recruit (n = 302) motivational internalisation of <b>core</b> <b>values</b> during a structured 5 -day training week, where recruits undertook a mixture of rock climbing, caving, canoeing, kayaking, and hill walking activities, and were required to complete tasks in unfamiliar and challenging environmental conditions. Reflecting the influence of the training, Bonferroni corrected, pair-samples, ttests conducted on the Relative Autonomy Index were significant for the motivational internalisation of All <b>core</b> <b>values</b> and four of the six independent <b>core</b> <b>values</b> (Selfless Commitment, Courage, Loyalty and Respect for Others). Further examination at external, introjected and integrated regulations additionally revealed significant results for all <b>core</b> <b>values</b> with the AT week appearing to have the most robust effect on introjected regulation. A second hypothesis was concerned with the effects of the leadership of AT instructors in developing recruit <b>core</b> <b>values</b> and asked specifically whether high levels of transformational leadership behaviours were associated with an enhanced internalisation of <b>core</b> <b>values.</b> Fifty nine instructors took part in the study and four transformational leadership behaviours were hypothesised to be associated with greater gains in the internalisation of all <b>core</b> <b>values.</b> Analyses revealed mixed results regarding individual transformational leadership behaviours; however, individual consideration was found to be the most significant behaviour.

In this paper we focus on <b>core</b> <b>values,</b> which guide and motivate an organisation, an area of the framework not examined in the accounting literature. Specifically we examine the process through which a new <b>core</b> <b>value</b> develops. We also show how this process is influenced by and acts upon the other levers of control. We highlight how this process initially involves few actors, little complexity and creates a descriptive definition for the <b>core</b> <b>value.</b> Based on this descriptive definition more actors become involved, resulting in more complexity and focuses on these actors trying to develop an understanding of the practical relevance of the new <b>core</b> <b>value.</b> The process of developing the <b>core</b> <b>value</b> and the search for practical relevance necessitates the creation and transformation of other management controls. These management controls in turn change the <b>core</b> <b>value</b> and other actors within the process. The process of search and discovery provides belief control through embedding elements of the <b>core</b> <b>value</b> in the management controls that were created or transformed. While the <b>core</b> <b>value</b> may be displaced its effects on other controls remain in place thus showing how and why controls embody both technical and social elements...|$|R
40|$|Neuroeconomic {{research}} has delineated neural regions {{involved in the}} computation of value, referring to a currency for concrete choices and decisions ('economic value'). Research in psychology and sociology, on the other hand, uses the term 'value' to describe motivational constructs that guide choices and behaviors across situations ('core value'). As a first step towards an integration of these literatures, we compared the neural regions computing economic <b>value</b> and <b>core</b> <b>value.</b> Replicating previous work, economic value computations activated a network centered on medial orbitofrontal cortex. <b>Core</b> <b>value</b> computations activated medial prefrontal cortex, a region involved in the processing of self-relevant information and dorsal striatum, involved in action selection. <b>Core</b> <b>value</b> ratings correlated with activity in precuneus and anterior prefrontal cortex, potentially reflecting {{the degree to which}} a <b>core</b> <b>value</b> is perceived as internalized part of one's self-concept. Distributed activation pattern in insula and ACC allowed differentiating individual <b>core</b> <b>value</b> types. These patterns may represent evaluation profiles reflecting prototypical fundamental concerns expressed in the <b>core</b> <b>value</b> types. Our findings suggest mechanisms by which <b>core</b> <b>values,</b> as motivationally important long-term goals anchored in the self-schema, may have the behavioral power to drive decisions and behaviors in the absence of immediately rewarding behavioral options...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this article}} is to {{introduce}} a conceptual framework for a corporate brand building process based on <b>core</b> <b>values.</b> The nature, role, and function of <b>core</b> <b>values</b> are considered a central part of the value foundation of a corporate brand. In line with this reasoning, a distinction is also made between three groups of values: organisational <b>values,</b> <b>core</b> <b>values,</b> and added values. This article is based on research into the brand building efforts of more than 50 major companies over a period of 10 years. The Volvo case is used as an illustration and places special emphasis on internal processes. The role of the <b>core</b> <b>values</b> in the ten steps of the framework is explored and illustrated. The work is based on first-hand experiences, interviews, and unique internal strategy documents from Volvo. The discussion defines <b>core</b> <b>values</b> as overarching concepts that summarise the identity of the corporate brand and as guiding lights for the brand building process. Another conclusion drawn from the article is that <b>core</b> <b>values</b> are vital for continuity, consistency and credibility in a value creating process. The theoretical and practical implications of using <b>core</b> <b>values</b> as a unifying common thread are discussed in relation to the paradigm of brand orientation...|$|R
40|$|Extensive {{research}} suggests organizations have unique guiding principles, called <b>core</b> <b>values,</b> which {{play a central}} role in strategic decision making, sustaining high-performance cultures, and guiding organizational culture change. Although the Competing Values Framework (CVF) has been widely used to identify a standardized set of <b>core</b> <b>values,</b> it has not been used to identify unique <b>core</b> <b>values</b> at a given organizations. Unique <b>core</b> <b>values</b> help to distinguish organizations and drive market success. The present research focused on development of a technique to extend the application of the CVF to identify the <b>core</b> <b>values</b> unique to a given organization. The CVF-based <b>Core</b> <b>Values</b> Identification Technique (CCVI) was developed and empirically tested at three companies. Data collection methods included semi-structured interviews, review of documents, participant observation and the standard CVF-based Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument (OCAI). The data analysis employed grounded theory methods in conjunction with the standard OCAI analysis. The primary research result is the iteratively developed and empirically tested tool, the CCVI Technique. Secondary research results include the identification of unique <b>core</b> <b>values</b> at each of the three participating companies. Lessons learned and the rationale for making modifications to the technique based on the case studies, along with best practices for utilization and opportunities for informing organizational change efforts are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - This paper aims to {{describe}} the uncovering of a corporate brand's <b>core</b> <b>values</b> and implications for strategic management of its track record. Design/methodology/approach - The paper examines the specific track records of Volvo, IKEA, IBM, and Scanpump, focusing on <b>core</b> <b>values</b> and how they evolve. Based on multiple sources of evidence, the track records of the case companies emerge as patterns of values that are: perceived externally by customers and non-customer stakeholders; and rooted internally within an organisation. Findings - Four categories of <b>core</b> <b>values</b> emerge, termed true, aspirational, potential, and hollow. Originality/value - The <b>Core</b> <b>Value</b> Grid is proposed as a managerially useful model on "how to build true values and avoid hollow values". In principle, a corporate brand cannot be stronger externally than it is internally.

40|$|Research has {{indicated}} that positive and negative attitudes toward intercollegiate athletics {{can contribute to the}} perceptions of both congruency and incongruency with the established university mission and <b>values.</b> <b>Core</b> <b>values</b> are considered to represent philosophical viewpoints and organizational priorities, further providing a sense of purpose to stakeholders. As such, established <b>core</b> <b>values</b> are expected to be applied and enacted in daily interactions in order to fulfill the mission and vision of an organization. Over time, however, the increase in negative attitudes attributed to athletic department behavior brings into question their perceived alignment with the university <b>core</b> <b>values</b> and brand. The potential existence of incompatibility and misalignment among internal constituents concerning <b>core</b> <b>values</b> has been linked to the starting point for conflicts within the organizational setting. Thus, attitudes toward athletic department behavioral congruency or incongruency with stated university <b>core</b> <b>values</b> is worthy of investigation {{in order to determine the}} consequential impact on the university brand. The purpose of this study was to investigate stakeholder attitudes toward athletic department behavioral congruency with the stated <b>core</b> <b>values</b> of Texas A&M University and assess the subsequent implications for the university brand. Personal interviews (N= 13) were conducted with individuals from each of six university internal and external stakeholder groups: current students, alumni, faculty/staff members, community members, athletic department personnel, and athletic department boosters. Findings revealed four primary themes: 1) 'Excellence' Equals Winning, 2) For Public Relations Purposes Only, 3) Separation and Isolation of the Athletic Department, and 4) Lack of Leadership from the Top-Down. Implications communicated the necessity of a consistent and accurate representation of the Texas A&M brand at all university levels. Further, the implementation of a unique, potentially more effective model for <b>core</b> <b>value</b> congruency and brand management was presented. Finally, the necessity of promotion and implementation of the <b>core</b> <b>values</b> from university and athletic department leadership was recommended for <b>core</b> <b>value</b> effectiveness and brand consistency...|$|R
40|$|Brands that do {{good for}} the society {{as well as for}} {{themselves}} are motivated by the <b>core</b> <b>values</b> they espouse, which necessitates a better understanding of what qualities a true <b>core</b> <b>value</b> must possess. The inherent tension within brands that do good, between commercial interests to increase competitiveness, and societal interests that are closely linked to the brand’s authenticity, has largely been overlooked. Hence, we develop and demonstrate a relatively easy-to-apply visual tool for evaluating <b>core</b> <b>values</b> based on a set of ‘goodness’ criteria derived from extant theory. The <b>Core</b> <b>Value</b> Compass adopts a paradox-based, evolutionary perspective by incorporating the inherent tensions within true <b>core</b> <b>values,</b> and classifying them according to their temporal orientation. Thus, we contribute towards a better understanding of underlying tensions of <b>core</b> <b>values,</b> and provide a practical tool that paves the way for improved, and indeed ethical, corporate branding strategies. Furthermore, we demonstrate the Compass’ application using the case of a public sector brand, which is a quintessential brand that does good. Thereby, we also contribute to the nascent theoretical discourse on public sector branding. This paper therefore adds to the notable attempts {{to bridge the gap between}} theory and practice in core values-based corporate branding...|$|R
