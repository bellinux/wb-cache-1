Religious {{education is not}} forbidden as such, but the federal constitution states that the union can neither impose, nor promote, nor finance any religion, because by law Brazil is a secular state. In 2004 however, teachers of religious education classes in schools of the education department of Rio de Janeiro began to present creationism in their classes as scientific fact. The practice was directly initiated by politicians in power who were promoting their personal religious views, and their action moved Brazilian scientists to protest the abuse. Subsequently, in congress a [...] "religious bench," [...] or faction, has become increasingly influential.

50|$|The ancient port of Cosa {{is located}} below {{the city on}} the hill to the southeast. It was likely founded {{at the same time as}} the early Roman colony in 273 BC, and thus {{represents}} the earliest Roman harbor known thus far. The port was initially associated with the Etruscans, however excavations have determined that it was first used by the Romans in the 3rd century BC and continued being used into the 3rd century AD, as confirmed by the material evidence. The Cosa harbor was never a major port of transit, however in ancient times it provided the best anchorage between Gaeta in the south and La Spezia to the north. This was probably a primary reason for the colony’s position within newly acquired Etruscan territory. Eventually the harbor established its own community, including a temple dedicated either to Portunus or Neptune, which resembled the Temple on the Arx and probably also dates to 170-160. In addition, remains of fish tanks have been found which suggest the importance of <b>aquiculture</b> and the production of garum. The port’s main period of prosperity occurred from the late 2nd century BC through the later 1st century BC, and there was a revival by the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD due to the growth of the villa economy in the countryside of Cosa. Although the city of Cosa and the port must have interacted in important ways, material evidence indicates that they do not follow a parallel development.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To study some morphometric parameters, {{protein and}} {{lysozyme}} content in organs and serum in several sturgeon species reared in <b>aquiculture</b> at {{the ages of}} 3, 8 and 18 months, and to investigate the specific and age distribution of lysozyme in fish organs. Methodology. For the experiments we used sturgeon species of different age groups reared in the fish farm «Fortuna XXI» located in the Galerny Gulf of the Dіnprо river. The study objects were: bester (Huso huso×Acipenser ruthenus), age of 3, 8 and 18 months; Russian sturgeon (Acipenser gueldenstaedtii), age of 3 months, Siberian sturgeon (A. baeri) and sterlet (A. ruthenus), age of 8 month. Following morphometric parameters were determined in the studied fish: weight (g), length (cm), absolute weight of liver, kidneys, spleen (mg), condition factor and relative weight (index, ‰) of organs. The lysozyme content was determined in serum and extracts of the tissues of fish organs by a diffusion method on the agar and protein content was determined by Louri's method. Findings. We detected significant differences in morphometric parameters, protein and lysozyme content in organs and serum of 3 -month bester and Russian sturgeon as well as specific differences of relative organ weight, protein and lysozyme levels in organs and serum of 8 -month Siberian sturgeon, bester and sterlet. A comparison of the investigated parameters in 3, 8 and 18 -month bester showed {{an increase in the}} condition factor with fish growth, significant changes of protein content in fish of different age groups, high level of lysozyme in kidneys and serum of 18 -month fish, redistribution of lysozyme contents in fish organs depending on age.
