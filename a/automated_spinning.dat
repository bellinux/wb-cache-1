Writers may also spin their own articles, allowing them to sell the same articles with slight variations to a number of clients or to use the article for multiple purposes, for example as content and also for article marketing.|$|E

An {{automatic}} flour mill was developed by Oliver Evans in 1785, making it the first completely automated industrial process.The centrifugal governor, which was invented by Christian Huygens in the seventeenth century, was used to adjust the gap between millstones. Another centrifugal governor was used by a Mr. Bunce of England in 1784 as part of a model steam crane. The centrifugal governor was adopted by James Watt for use on a steam engine in 1788 after Watt’s partner Boulton saw one at a flour mill Boulton & Watt were building.|$|E

We assessed the hematological characteristics of schoolchildren to establish the prevalence of anemia in Ýstanbul. The study was performed on 1, 600 students {{between the ages of}} 6 - 16. Hematological parameters of all the students were measured by an electronic cell counter on blood taken intravenously. Anemia prevalence was primarily determined according to Dallman’s criteria. The results showed that if hemoglobin (Hb) was used as the primary criterion to define anemia, 423 students (27. 6 %) were found anemic; if hematocrit (Hct) was used, 625 students (40. 8 %) were found anemic and if mean corpuscular volume (MCV) was taken as a criterion to define microcytosis, 121 students (7. 9 %) remained below the normal level. The difference of anemia prevalence was high (p< 0. 001) when two evaluation criteria (Hb or Hct) were compared. Furthermore it is known that a 3 % difference occurs when <b>automated</b> and <b>spun</b> Hct values are compared. When a correction was made by adding thi...|$|R

Shudehill Mill was built between Miller Street and Angel Street {{to the north of}} Rochdale Road; its site is now a car park. The River Irwell and Mersey had been made navigable to Manchester in the 1720s opening the way for {{importing}} raw cotton and exporting finished cloth and the Bridgewater Canal brought coal from the Worsley Navigable Levels to the Castlefield Basin after 1761. Arkwright had patented a water frame to spin cotton, and in 1775 patented a mechanical carding engine. He took out a second patent that year for drawing and roving. All the pieces were in place for a large <b>automated</b> <b>spinning</b> mill to be built in Manchester. Shudehill Mill, a watermill, was next to a stream, but derived its power from cycling water between two storage ponds, a steam pump was used to replenish the upper pond from the lower.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Web spam is {{an abusive}} search engine {{optimization}} technique that artificially boosts the search result rank of pages promoted in the spam content. A popular form of Web spam today relies upon <b>automated</b> <b>spinning</b> to avoid duplicate detection. Spinning replaces words or phrases in an input article {{to create new}} versions with vaguely similar meaning but sufficiently different appearance to avoid plagiarism detectors. With just a few clicks, spammers can use automated tools to spin a selected article thousands of times and then use posting services via proxies to spam the spun content on hundreds of target sites. The goal {{of this paper is}} to develop effective techniques to detect automatically spun content on the Web. Our approach is directly tied to the underlying mechanism used by <b>automated</b> <b>spinning</b> tools: we use a technique based upon immutables, words or phrases that spinning tools do not modify when generating spun content. We implement this immutable method in a tool called DSpin, which identifies automatically spun Web articles. We then apply DSpin to two data sets of crawled articles to study the extent to which spammers use <b>automated</b> <b>spinning</b> to create and post content, as well as their spamming behavior.
