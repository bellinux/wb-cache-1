25|$|On September 6, 1985, Midwest Express Flight 105, Midwest's {{first and}} only fatal accident, crashed upon takeoff from Milwaukee. One of the airline's Douglas DC-9s crashed while taking off, bound for Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport. According to NTSB reports, the crash was caused by {{improper}} pilot reaction when the plane's right engine failed due to stress corrosion cracking. The improper flight control inputs caused an uncommanded roll and <b>accelerated</b> <b>stall.</b> The 31 people on board died.|$|E
25|$|The four-engine propliner {{originated}} in Boston, and after making intermediate stops in New York and Pittsburgh, arrived at Chicago Midway Airport at 01:18 CST, where a new crew took over, and fuel and oil were added. At 02:00 the flight departed from runway 22, bound for Las Vegas, Nevada, the next stop. Five minutes later, while climbing westbound to 5,000ft, the aircraft suddenly pitched violently upwards, {{resulting in an}} <b>accelerated</b> <b>stall</b> from which the crew was unable to recover. The aircraft crashed into terrain, and left a debris field of 200 by 1,100 feet.|$|E
500|$|The {{investigation}} found {{that as the}} B-52 entered its final turn sequence around the tower, its indicated airspeed (IAS) was [...] Although Holland increased the engine power after starting the turn, his input came too late to maintain the aircraft's airspeed, as the B-52 turbofan engines take up to eight seconds to respond to throttle commands. Even though the airspeed indicator was available to all four aircrew members, the aircraft's airspeed was allowed to continue to decrease. Eight seconds before impact, the aircraft's IAS had deteriorated to [...] and the aircraft's bank angle increased past 60°. At this time Holland or McGeehan applied full right spoiler, right rudder, and nose-up elevator, and the aircraft entered a turning flight stall (also called <b>accelerated</b> <b>stall).</b> This phenomenon is a stall that occurs at a higher airspeed than the design stall speed – which always refers to {{straight and level flight}} – because the aircraft is turning. Due to the bank of 60° or more, the stall speed for the aircraft at that moment was [...] Thus, flying 2 knots slower, the aircraft stalled, without having sufficient altitude to recover before striking the ground.|$|E
40|$|Field {{measurements}} {{were made on}} a fighter airplane to determine the approximate magnitude of the horizontal tail loads in accelerated flight. In these flight measurements, pressures at a few points were used as an index of the tail loads by correlating these pressures with complete pressure-distribution data obtained in the NACA full-scale tunnel. In addition, strain gages and motion pictures of tail deflections were used to explore the general nature and order of magnitude of fluctuating tail loads in <b>accelerated</b> <b>stalls...</b>|$|R
500|$|The city of San Diego {{constructed}} SR56 from Black Mountain Road to Carmel Mountain Road, and Caltrans {{built the}} remaining {{portion of the}} route to Carmel Creek Road. The bridges were still under construction in November2000 on the city portion. San Diego mayor Dick Murphy commissioned the San Diego Freeway Congestion Strike Team to attempt to <b>accelerate</b> <b>stalled</b> freeway projects such as SR56 in 2001. In May2001, the City Council allocated another $5.1million (about $ in [...] dollars) to purchase land to build the freeway. Critics stated that the construction of SR56 was a short-term solution, and that traffic would return by 2020.|$|R

5000|$|On June 10, 2001, Zuyev died {{along with}} another aviator, Jerry [...] "Mike" [...] Warren, in a crash near Bellingham, Washington, USA when their Yakovlev Yak-52 entered and failed to recover from an <b>accelerated</b> <b>stall.</b>|$|E
50|$|The normal stall speed, {{specified}} by the VS values above, always refers to straight and level flight, where the load factor is equal to 1g. However, if the aircraft is turning or pulling up from a dive, additional lift is required to provide the vertical or lateral acceleration, and so the stall speed is higher. An <b>accelerated</b> <b>stall</b> is a stall that occurs under such conditions.|$|E
5000|$|N91DR. The {{original}} prototype, crashed by Rick Fessenden at an airshow at Santa Paula, California. Although the NTSB investigation {{concluded that}} an <b>accelerated</b> <b>stall</b> during Fessenden's [...] "wind up turn" [...] - a level 360-degree very high-G turn - caused the airplane to crash, examination of videotapes {{of the crash}} gave a strong indication that the pilot blacked out under 9+ Gs. Fessenden was killed.|$|E
40|$|Powered, {{radio-controlled}} {{flight tests}} were conducted on a 1 / 4 -scale model of a spin-resistant trainer configuration to determine the stall departure and spin resistance characteristics provided by an outboard wing leading-edge droop modification. The model was instrumented to provide quantitative as well as qualitative information on flight characteristics. Flight test {{results indicated that the}} unmodified configuration (wing leading-edge droop off) exhibited an abrupt, uncontrollable roll departure at the stall. With the outboard wing leading-edge droop installed, the modified configuration exhibited flight characteristics that were resistant to stall departure and spin entry. The stall departure and spin resistance characteristics of the modified configuration were demonstrated in flight maneuvers that included idle-power stalls, full-power stalls, sideslip <b>stalls,</b> and <b>accelerated</b> <b>stalls...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The pilot {{adjusts the}} {{instrument}} {{to indicate the}} edge of the red-white zone during minimum airspeed practice at altitude, indicating the aircraft has zero POWL beyond that point. Since the wing will stall at the same angle of attack at any airspeed, once properly adjusted the LRI will indicate the red-white edge anytime the stall is approached. This includes landing stalls, climbing <b>stalls,</b> and <b>accelerated</b> <b>stalls.</b> After adjustment, the black line {{in the center of the}} white indicates maximum angle of climb and maximum angle of descent with enough reserve lift for the landing flare. With practice, the pilot can use the LRI to determine the exact moment for liftoff with minimum ground roll and maximum angle of climb combined.|$|R
50|$|It {{should be}} noted that, {{according}} to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) terminology, the above example illustrates a so-called turning flight stall, while the term accelerated is used to indicate an <b>accelerated</b> turning <b>stall</b> only, that is, a turning flight stall where the airspeed decreases at a given rate.|$|R
50|$|On September 6, 1985, Midwest Express Flight 105 crashed {{shortly after}} takeoff from Milwaukee, bound for Atlanta. According to the NTSB investigation, the crash {{was caused by}} {{improper}} control inputs by the pilots when the plane's right engine failed due to stress corrosion cracking. The improper reaction caused the Douglas DC-9 jet aircraft to enter an uncommanded roll and <b>accelerated</b> <b>stall.</b> All 31 people on board died in the airline's sole fatal accident.|$|E

30|$|Polymers are {{attractive}} materials {{because of their}} flexibility, transparency, and sensitivity to external stimuli. Stimuli-responsive polymer tubes were shown to open and close when a small temperature change is applied [33]. Polymeric bilayers were utilized to fabricate thermoresponsive microjets that fold and unfold upon temperature change [34]. Polycaprolactone as outer passive layer, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) as middle thermo-active layer, and platinum as inner catalytic layer form the triple film of the microjet. PNIPAM swells below 28 °C and shrinks above this temperature, so that a slight temperature difference leads {{to a change in}} the radius of the multilayer jet (Figure  2 BIIb). By doing so, the microjet can be reversibly <b>accelerated</b> and <b>stalled</b> on demand, because the radius determines the bubble propulsion and, in turn, the speed of the microjet. Polymers are also, as mentioned above, easily functionalized with bioactive molecules. In addition, such flexible microjets have potential for studies of the mechanism of bubble generation inside tubular microjets and for biodegradable micromotors.|$|R
50|$|On January 20, 1999, Handley {{once again}} {{got into the}} record books by flying the Turbo Raven from brake release to 3,000 meters in one minute and nine seconds. In July 1999 at EAA AirVenture Oshkosh, the Turbo Raven took three minutes, six seconds to get to 6,000 meters, and {{established}} the Turbo Raven as the fastest-climbing propeller-driven aircraft in the world. This aircraft was also able to reverse the pitch of its propeller blades in flight, and could actually slow down while diving towards the ground; Handley used this ability to make very steep approaches to land, {{as well as for}} unique maneuvers where he could slow below stall speed while diving. On October 3, 1999, exactly one year to the day after its debut, the Turbo Raven was destroyed after the engine failed to deliver power during one such approach at the California International Airshow at Salinas Municipal Airport, and Handley was unable to <b>accelerate</b> above <b>stall</b> speed with the propeller in reverse pitch. He was seriously injured, but made a full recovery, and was flying within a month after the accident. The NTSB official accident investigation found no indications of problems with power plant and the propeller, and attributed the crash to pilot error.|$|R
40|$|NACA {{instrumentation}} {{has been}} installed ii the X-J 4 airplanes to obtain stability and control data during the acceptance tests {{conducted by the}} Northrop Aircraft Corporation. This report presents data obtained on the stalling characteristics of the airplane in the clean and gear- down configurations. The center of gravity was located at approximately 18 percent of the mean aerodynamic chord during the tests. The {{results indicated that the}} airplane was not completely stalled when stall was gradually approached during nominally U accelerated flight but that it was completely stalled during a more abruptly approached <b>stall</b> in <b>accelerated</b> flight. The <b>stall</b> in <b>accelerated</b> flight was relatively mild, and this was attributed {{to the nature of the}} variation of lift with angle of attack for the 001 - 614 airfoil section, the plan form of the wing, and to the fact that the initial sideslip at the stall produced (as shown by wind-tunnel tests of a model of the airplane) a more symmetrical stall pattern...|$|R
50|$|The Thunderstreak {{suffered}} from the same poor takeoff performance as the straight-wing Thunderjet despite having a more powerful engine. In reality, almost 700 pounds-force (3.11 kN) or ten percent of total thrust was lost because the J65 was installed at an angle and its exhaust had a prominent kink. On a hot day, 7,500 feet (2,285 m) of runway were required for takeoff roll. A typical takeoff speed was 160 knots (185 mph, 300 km/h). Like the Thunderjet, the Thunderstreak excelled at cruise and had predictable handling characteristics within its performance envelope. Like its predecessor, it also {{suffered from}} <b>accelerated</b> <b>stall</b> pitch-up and potential resulting separation of wings from the airplane. In addition, spins in the F-84F were practically unrecoverable and ejection was the only recourse below 10,000 feet (3,000 m).|$|E
50|$|If {{the total}} lift is kept constant, the {{vertical}} component of lift will decrease. As {{the weight of}} the aircraft is unchanged, this would result in the aircraft descending if not countered. To maintain level flight requires increased positive (up) elevator to increase the angle of attack, increase the total lift generated and keep the vertical component of lift equal with {{the weight of the}} aircraft. This cannot continue indefinitely. The total load factor required to maintain level flight {{is directly related to the}} bank angle. This means that for a given airspeed, level flight can only be maintained up to a certain given angle of bank. Beyond this angle of bank, the aircraft will suffer an <b>accelerated</b> <b>stall</b> if the pilot attempts to generate enough lift to maintain level flight.|$|E
5000|$|The {{investigation}} found {{that as the}} B-52 entered its final turn sequence around the tower, its indicated airspeed (IAS) was 182 kn. Although Holland increased the engine power after starting the turn, his input came too late to maintain the aircraft's airspeed, as the B-52 turbofan engines take up to eight seconds to respond to throttle commands. Even though the airspeed indicator was available to all four aircrew members, the aircraft's airspeed was allowed to continue to decrease. Eight seconds before impact, the aircraft's IAS had deteriorated to 145 kn and the aircraft's bank angle increased past 60°. At this time Holland or McGeehan applied full right spoiler, right rudder, and nose-up elevator, and the aircraft entered a turning flight stall (also called <b>accelerated</b> <b>stall).</b> This phenomenon is a stall that occurs at a higher airspeed than the design stall speed - which always refers to {{straight and level flight}} - because the aircraft is turning. Due to the bank of 60° or more, the stall speed for the aircraft at that moment was 147 kn. Thus, flying 2 knots slower, the aircraft stalled, without having sufficient altitude to recover before striking the ground.|$|E
50|$|Production quickly {{ran into}} problems. Although tooling {{commonality}} with the Thunderjet {{was supposed to}} be 55 percent, in reality only fifteen percent of tools could be reused. To make matters worse, the F-84F utilized press-forged wing spars and ribs. At the time, only three presses in the United States could manufacture these, and priority was given to the Boeing B-47 Stratojet bomber over the F-84. The YJ65-W-1 engine was considered obsolete and the improved J65-W-3 did not become available until 1954. When the first production F-84F finally flew on 22 November 1952, it differed from the service test aircraft. It had a different canopy which opened up and back instead of sliding to the rear, as well as airbrakes {{on the sides of the}} fuselage instead of the bottom of the aircraft. The aircraft was considered not ready for operational deployment due to control and stability problems. The first 275 aircraft, equipped with conventional stabilizer-elevator tailplanes, suffered from <b>accelerated</b> <b>stall</b> pitch-up and poor turning ability at combat speeds. Beginning with Block 25, the problem was ameliorated by the introduction of a hydraulically powered one-piece stabilator. A number of aircraft were also retrofitted with spoilers for improved high-speed control. As a result, the F-84F was not declared operational until 12 May 1954.|$|E
40|$|The LOC {{sequences}} attempted were as follows: 1. Roll Upset: Pilot rolls {{the aircraft}} to approximately 60 degrees bank angle {{at a low}} airspeed and power setting, simulating a roll disturbance (e. g. wake turbulence encounter). Pilot lets the pitch angle fall well below the horizon before initiating recovery inputs. Pilot applies inappropriate recovery inputs; in this case, gradual pull to full up elevator prior to leveling the wings. This results in an <b>accelerated</b> <b>stall</b> and LOC event. Variations on this maneuver was to use higher power settings. 2. Yaw Upset: Similar to the Roll Upset, except the pilot uses the rudder to initiate the disturbance. A variation on this maneuver was to hold {{a certain amount of}} rudder input in throughout the maneuver, simulating a stuck actuator. 3. Sustained Post-Stall Flight: Pilot enters a normal power-off stall, pulling the elevator to maximum nose up deflection and holds this input. Pilot attempts to maintain a wings level attitude.
