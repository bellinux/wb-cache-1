25|$|Young <b>aye-ayes</b> {{typically}} are silver colored on their front {{and have a}} stripe down their back. However, as the <b>aye-ayes</b> begin to reach maturity, their bodies will be completely covered in thick fur and are typically not one solid color. On the head and back, {{the ends of the}} hair are typically tipped with white {{while the rest of the}} body will ordinarily be a yellow and/or brown color.|$|E
25|$|The aye-aye {{was thought}} to be extinct in 1933, but was rediscovered in 1957. Nine {{individuals}} were transported to Nosy Mangabe, an island near Maroantsetra off eastern Madagascar, in 1966. Recent research shows the aye-aye is more widespread than was previously thought, but its conservation status was changed to Endangered in 2014. This is for three main reasons: the aye-aye is considered evil, the forests of Madagascar are being destroyed, and the farmers will kill <b>aye-ayes</b> to protect their crops and for poaching. However, there is no direct evidence to suggest <b>aye-ayes</b> pose any legitimate threat to crops and therefore are killed based on superstition.|$|E
25|$|Further {{evidence}} {{indicating that}} the aye-aye belongs in the superfamily Lemuroidea can be inferred from the presence of petrosal bullae encasing the ossicles of the ear. However, interestingly, the bones themselves may have some resemblance to those of rodents. The <b>aye-ayes</b> are also similar to lemurs in their shorter back legs.|$|E
500|$|Another {{interpretation}} of the <b>aye-aye's</b> origins has once again called into question the single origins of the lemurs. [...] The <b>aye-aye</b> and a fossil strepsirrhine primate from Africa, Plesiopithecus, share similarities {{in the shape of}} the skull and the morphology of the lower jaw, which suggest that the latter could be an early relative of the <b>aye-aye.</b> [...] However, the placement of an <b>aye-aye</b> ancestor in Africa would require multiple colonizations of Madagascar by strepsirrhine primates. [...] Molecular tests may offer support, since they show that the <b>aye-aye</b> was the first to diverge in the lemur clade and that the other lemur families did not diverge until much later.|$|R
5|$|Only the <b>aye-aye,</b> the extinct giant <b>aye-aye,</b> and {{the largest}} of the extinct giant sloth lemurs lack a {{functional}} strepsirrhine toothcomb. In the case of the <b>aye-aye,</b> the morphology of the deciduous incisors, which are lost shortly after birth, indicate that its ancestors had a toothcomb. These milk teeth are lost shortly after birth and are replaced by open-rooted, continually growing (hypselodont) incisors.|$|R
500|$|Until Owen {{published}} a definitive anatomical study in 1866, early naturalists were uncertain whether the <b>aye-aye</b> (genus Daubentonia) was a primate, rodent, or marsupial. [...] In {{the late eighteenth}} century, for example, the <b>aye-aye</b> was classified under the squirrel genus Sciurus. [...] By emphasizing its primate features, such as its postorbital bar, stereoscopic vision, and opposable hallux, over its rodent-like teeth, Owen demonstrated its affinity with other primates. [...] In 1996, Ankel-Simons demonstrated that the shape and arrangement of the <b>aye-aye's</b> diminutive deciduous incisors indicate that this genus has a shared ancestry with the toothcombed primates. [...] However, {{the placement of the}} <b>aye-aye</b> within the primates remained problematic until very recently. [...] The karyotype of the <b>aye-aye</b> is noticeably different from that of its closest relatives, the lorises {{and the rest of the}} lemurs, with a diploid chromosome count of 2n=30. [...] Based on its anatomy, researchers have found support for classifying the genus Daubentonia as a specialized indriid, a sister group to all strepsirrhines, and an indeterminate taxon within the primates. In 1931, Schwarz labeled the <b>aye-aye</b> as an offshoot of Indriidae, claiming that all lemurs were monophyletic, whereas Reginald Innes Pocock had previously placed the <b>aye-aye</b> outside of the lemurs. [...] In that same year, Anthony and Coupin classified the <b>aye-aye</b> under infraorder Chiromyiformes, a sister group to the other strepsirrhines. [...] Colin Groves upheld this classification in 2005 because he was not entirely convinced the <b>aye-aye</b> formed a clade with the rest of the Malagasy lemurs, despite molecular tests that had shown Daubentoniidae was basal to all Lemuroidea.|$|R
25|$|The aye-aye lives {{primarily}} {{on the east coast}} of Madagascar. Its natural habitat is rainforest or deciduous forest, but many live in cultivated areas due to deforestation. Rainforest <b>aye-ayes,</b> the most common, dwell in canopy areas, and are usually sighted above 700 meters altitude. They sleep during the day in nests built in the forks of trees.|$|E
25|$|The {{conservation}} {{of this species}} has been aided by captive breeding, primarily at the Duke Lemur Center in Durham, North Carolina. This center has been influential in keeping, researching and breeding <b>aye-ayes</b> and other lemurs. They have sent multiple teams to capture lemurs in Madagascar and have since created captive breeding groups for their lemurs. Specifically, they {{were responsible for the}} first aye-aye born into captivity and studied how he and the other aye-aye infants born at the center develop through infancy. They have also revolutionized the understanding of the aye-aye diet.|$|E
25|$|However, the aye-aye {{is often}} viewed as a harbinger of evil and killed on sight. Others believe, if one points its narrowest finger at someone, they are marked for death. Some say the {{appearance}} of an aye-aye in a village predicts {{the death of a}} villager, {{and the only way to}} prevent this is to kill it. The Sakalava people go so far as to claim <b>aye-ayes</b> sneak into houses through the thatched roofs and murder the sleeping occupants by using their middle finger to puncture the victim's aorta.|$|E

500|$|An extinct, giant {{relative}} of the living <b>aye-aye,</b> the giant <b>aye-aye</b> shared {{at least two of}} the <b>aye-aye's</b> bizarre traits: ever-growing central incisors and an elongated, skinny middle finger.

[...] Weighing as much as , it was between two-and-half and five times the size of living <b>aye-aye.</b> [...] Alive when humans came to Madagascar, its teeth were collected and drilled to make necklaces.|$|R
2500|$|Due to its derived {{morphological}} features, {{the classification}} of the <b>aye-aye</b> has been debated since its discovery. [...] The possession of continually growing incisors (front teeth) parallels those of rodents, leading early naturalists to mistakenly classify the <b>aye-aye</b> within the mammalian order Rodentia and as a squirrel, due to its toes, hair coloring, and tail. However, the <b>aye-aye</b> is also similar to felines in its head shape, eyes, ears and nostrils.|$|R
25|$|Like {{many other}} prosimians, the female aye-aye is {{dominant}} to the male. They are not typically monogamous, and will often challenge {{each other for}} mates. Male <b>aye-ayes</b> are very assertive in this way, and sometimes even pull other males away from a female during mating. Males are normally locked to females during mating in sessions that may last up to an hour. Outside of mating, males and females interact only occasionally, usually while foraging. The aye-aye {{is thought to be}} the only primate which uses echolocation to find its prey.|$|E
500|$|The lemur {{dentition}} is heterodont (having multiple tooth morphologies) and {{derives from}} an ancestral primate permanent dentition of [...] Indriids, sportive lemurs, the aye-aye, and the extinct sloth lemurs, monkey lemurs, and koala lemurs have reduced dentitions, having lost incisors, canines, or premolars. The ancestral deciduous dentition is , but young indriids, <b>aye-ayes,</b> koala lemurs, sloth lemurs, and probably monkey lemurs have fewer deciduous teeth.|$|E
2500|$|The aye-aye is a nocturnal and {{arboreal}} animal {{meaning that}} it spends most of its life high in the trees. Although they are known {{to come down to}} the ground on occasion, <b>aye-ayes</b> sleep, eat, travel and mate in the trees and are most commonly found close to the canopy where there is plenty of cover from the dense foliage. During the day, <b>aye-ayes</b> sleep in spherical nests in the forks of tree branches that are constructed out of leaves, branches and vines before emerging after dark to begin their hunt for food. Aye-aye are solitary animals that mark their large home range with scent. [...] The smaller territories of females often overlap those of {{at least a couple of}} males. Male <b>aye-ayes</b> tend to share their territories with other males and are even known to share the same nests (although not at the same time), and can seemingly tolerate each other until they hear the call of a female that is looking for a mate.|$|E
40|$|This report aims {{to clarify}} the nocturnal {{activity}} of the <b>aye-aye</b> (Daubentonia madagascariensis) under captive conditions to compare it with that under natural conditions. The <b>aye-aye</b> was nocuturnal and showed activity at any time at night. However, from 02 : 00 hrs until just prior to dawn, it often rested. It frequently returned to the nest throughout this period to take long rests of {{more than half an}} hour. The <b>aye-aye's</b> activities were classified into four categories: feeding, moving, resting and other activities. The average proportions of these activities were 14. 8 %, 25. 3 %, 56. 7 % and 3. 2 %, respectively. The relative proportions of the activities showed seasonal changes. Rises in atmospheric temperature were highly correlated with increases in the proportion of moving (r= 0. 908). Generally speaking, the proportion of feeding was high in the early evening and gradually fell as night progressed. The four activities were sub-divided into several component acts. In terms of component acts, hanging was positively correlated with a rise in temperature (r= 0. 889), while sitting was negatively correlated (r=- 0. 862), suggesting that the activity of the <b>aye-aye</b> is generally enhanced with rises in atmospheric temperature. The <b>aye-aye</b> engaged in tapping and gnawing throughout the period. These acts consisted of along duration of gnawing at definite places on the window or the steel frame of the door. Since the proportion of feeding activity was virtually undetermined under natural conditions because of intermittent observations and fragmented data, we assumed that it would be similar to that seen in the captive condition. On average, the <b>aye-aye</b> engaged in feeding for 89 minutes during a night, and consumed 48. 5 ramy fruits or ingested 212 kcal. The energy intake from this quantity of ramy fruits would be sufficient, considering the basal metabolic rate of prosimians. These analyses support a hard-nut adaptation hypothesis suggesting that ramy fruit is an important staple food of the <b>aye-aye.</b> During the period of study, the <b>aye-aye</b> was presented with 12 diet items such as coconuts, ramy nuts, bread, etc. The weight of food consumed during meals was measured over 16 nights to calculate the energy intake of the <b>aye-aye,</b> which was found on average 306. 1 kcal per meal. The response of the <b>aye-aye</b> to light was markedly different from other nocturnal prosimians. The <b>aye-aye</b> was not apparently disturbed when exposed to intense light...|$|R

2500|$|If Plesiopithecus is an African {{relative}} of the aye-aye, it would suggest lemuroid primates colonized Madagascar twice. [...] Molecular {{studies show that the}} aye-aye diverged early in the evolutionary history of lemurs, followed later by a sudden burst of diversification of the other four lemur families. [...] If Plesiopithecus is an aye-aye relative, lemurs and <b>aye-ayes</b> would have diverged in Africa and the aye-aye ancestor would have colonized Madagascar separately from the other lemurs, which would have diversified immediately upon arrival to the island. [...] If <b>aye-ayes</b> are more closely related to lemurs than Plesiopithecus, then only one colonization event occurred, with the aye-aye branching off first and then the other lemuroid families diverging several million years later following a major extinction event.|$|E
2500|$|The aye-aye is classically {{considered}} 'solitary' as {{they have}} not been observed to groom each other. However, recent research suggests it is more social than once thought. It usually sticks to foraging in its own personal home range, or territory. The home ranges of males often overlap, and the males can be very social with each other. Female home ranges never overlap, though a male's home range often overlaps that of several females. The male <b>aye-ayes</b> live in large areas up to , while females have smaller living spaces that goes up to [...] It is difficult for the males to defend a singular female because of the large home range.

Regular scent marking with their cheeks and neck is how <b>aye-ayes</b> let others know of their presence and repel intruders from their territory.|$|E
2500|$|The adapiforms are early {{primates}} {{which are}} known {{only from the}} fossil record, and {{it is unclear whether}} they form a suborder proper or a paraphyletic grouping.

5|$|The <b>aye-aye</b> {{is almost}} universally viewed unfavorably across Madagascar, though the tales vary from village to village and region to region. If people see an <b>aye-aye,</b> they may kill it and hang the corpse on a pole near a road {{outside of town}} (so others can carry the bad {{fortunes}} away) or burn their village and move. The superstitions behind <b>aye-aye</b> fady include beliefs that they kill and eat chickens or people, that they kill people in their sleep by cutting their aortic vein, that they embody ancestral spirits, or that they warn of illness, death, or bad luck in the family. As of 1970, {{the people of the}} Marolambo District in the Toamasina Province feared the <b>aye-aye</b> because they believed it had supernatural powers. Because of this, no one was allowed to mock, kill, or eat one.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Aye-ayes</b> tap on {{the trunks}} and {{branches}} of trees {{at a rate of}} up to eight times per second, and listen to the echo produced to find hollow chambers. Studies have suggested that the acoustic properties associated with the foraging cavity have no effect on excavation behavior. Once a chamber is found, they chew a hole into the wood and get grubs out of that hole with their highly adapted narrow and bony middle fingers. The aye-aye begins foraging between 30 minutes before and three hours after sunset. Up to 80% of the night is spent foraging in the canopy, separated by occasional rest periods. It climbs trees by making successive vertical leaps, much like a squirrel. Horizontal movement is more difficult, but the aye-aye rarely descends to jump to another tree, and can often travel up to [...] a night.|$|E
2500|$|Alternatively, it {{may have}} closer ties to the aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis) within the lemuroid (lemur) radiation. [...] The cranial and dental {{morphology}} of Plesiopithecus resemble what is predicted of an aye-aye ancestor, with an arched cranial vault suggesting klinorhynchy (a marked angle between the palate and the basicranium, or the lower region of the braincase) {{similar to that of}} <b>aye-ayes,</b> significantly enlarged canines and/or incisors, reduced molars and premolars, a high muzzle, and anteriorly placed orbits. [...] However, it lacked ever-growing incisors and the diastema found in the aye-aye. [...] The increased anterior dentition is peculiar because it has only happened in lemuriforms, and has never been observed in any of the numerous adapiforms. [...] Key to this possible close affinity with the aye-aye is the identity (canine vs. incisor) of the procumbent front teeth of both species, neither of which is definitively known. [...] If they are different between the two species, then the similarities would be due to convergence. [...] If they are the same tooth, then it may suggest a close phylogenetic relation and African origins for the aye-aye.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{study was}} carried out between July and August 1989 on the usage of the manual digits of one captive <b>aye-aye</b> (Daubentonia madagascariensis) at the Tsimbazaza Zoo, Antananarivo. Manipulation of the digits was {{examined}} by direct observation and by analysis of tapes taken with a video-camera. The third digit (the most slender) and the fourth digit (the longest) of both hands, were us-ed for scooping foods: the average duration of one scoop was 11. 9 seconds for the third digit and 14. 7 seconds for the fourth digit, with no substantial difference between them (t-test, p>O. 05). The <b>aye-aye</b> alternated between using {{the third and fourth}} digits, accor-ding to the foods presented. The third digit was also used for tapping food. The average duration of one tapping bout was 2. 9 seconds. The fourth digit was often used for grooming and for grasping a twig or holding Onto wire mesh while traversing. This report forms the experimental part of a series of papers examining the hard-nut adap-tation hypothesis of the <b>aye-aye's</b> ecological niche. In this investigation, the captive female <b>aye-aye</b> showed some extraordinary examples of feeding behavior. The <b>aye-aye</b> ate all foods except sugar cane, by using her third and fourth digits after tapping the food with her third digits. Primates often feed by holding a food item with the hands and biting off pieces direct-ly with the mouth. But the <b>aye-aye</b> did not eat in such a manner. This feeding behavior shows the specialization for consuming the contents of hard nuts of ramy (Canarium spp.) under natural conditions, and that the <b>aye-aye's</b> morphological characteristics are closely adapted to such a feeding method...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} high-coverage draft genome {{assembly}} of the <b>aye-aye</b> (Daubentonia madagascariensis), a highly unusual nocturnal primate from Madagascar. Our assembly totals ∼ 3. 0 billion bp (3. 0 Gb), {{roughly the size of}} the human genome, comprised of ∼ 2. 6 million scaffolds (N 50 scaffold size = 13, 597 bp) based on short paired-end sequencing reads. We compared the <b>aye-aye</b> genome sequence data with four other published primate genomes (human, chimpanzee, orangutan, and rhesus macaque) {{as well as with the}} mouse and dog genomes as nonprimate outgroups. Unexpectedly, we observed strong evidence for a relatively slow substitution rate in the <b>aye-aye</b> lineage compared with these and other primates. In fact, the <b>aye-aye</b> branch length is estimated to be ∼ 10 % shorter than that of the human lineage, which is known for its low substitution rate. This finding may be explained, in part, by the protracted <b>aye-aye</b> life-history pattern, including late weaning and age of first reproduction relative to other lemurs. Additionally, the availability of this draft lemur genome sequence allowed us to polarize nucleotide and protein sequence changes to the ancestral primate lineage—a critical period in primate evolution, for which the relevant fossil record is sparse. Finally, we identified 293, 800 high-confidence single nucleotide polymorphisms in the donor individual for our <b>aye-aye</b> genome sequence, a captive-born individual from two wild-born parents. The resulting heterozygosity estimate of 0. 051 % is the lowest of any primate studied to date, which is understandable considering the <b>aye-aye's</b> extensive home-range size and relatively low population densities. Yet this level of genetic diversity also suggests that conservation efforts benefiting this unusual species should be prioritized, especially in the face of the accelerating degradation and fragmentation of Madagascar's forests...|$|R
