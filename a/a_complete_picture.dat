5|$|In 1973, {{the naval}} museum curator Robert F. Sumrall (following Kerr) {{suggested}} a {{mechanism by which}} dazzle camouflage may have sown the kind of confusion that Wilkinson had intended for it. Coincidence rangefinders used for naval artillery had an optical mechanism, operated by a human to compute the range. The operator adjusted the mechanism until the two half-images of the target lined up in <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> <b>picture.</b> Dazzle, Sumrall argued, was intended to make that hard, as clashing patterns looked abnormal even when the two halves were aligned, something that became more important when submarine periscopes included such rangefinders. Patterns sometimes also included a false bow wave to {{make it difficult for}} an enemy to estimate the ship's speed.|$|E

However, by 1921, when {{he was awarded the}} Nobel Prize and his work on photoelectricity was mentioned by name in the award citation, most physicists thought that light quanta were possible. <b>A</b> <b>complete</b> <b>picture</b> of the photoelectric effect was only obtained after the maturity of quantun mechanics.|$|E
25|$|Once the {{horoscope}} {{has been}} constructed {{the process of}} interpretation can begin, which involves building <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> <b>picture</b> of {{the personality of the}} subject, or native. Interpretation involves three main steps: noting the important features of the chart, and the processes of chart weighting and chart shaping. Chart weighting involves noting the distribution of zodiac signs and houses in the chart, and the significance of this to the overall personality of the native. Chart shaping involves assessing the placement of the planets by aspect and position in the chart, and noting any significant patterns which occur between them.|$|E
25|$|Trogons are {{generally}} sedentary, with no species known to undertake long migrations. A {{small number of}} species are known to make smaller migratory movements, particularly montane species which move to lower altitudes during different seasons.

The Narina trogon of Africa is thought to undertake some localised short distance migrations over parts of its range, for example birds of Zimbabwe's plateau savannah depart after the breeding season. <b>A</b> <b>complete</b> <b>picture</b> of these movements is however lacking.

25|$|By 1873 the Colonial Office in London came to {{perceive}} Ord as incompetent. He was soon replaced by Sir Andrew Clarke and Clarke {{was ordered to}} get <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> <b>picture</b> {{of what was happening}} in the Malay states and recommend how to streamline British administration in Malaya. The reason was that London was increasingly aware that the Straits Settlements were increasingly dependent on the economy of the Malay states, including Perak. After Clarke's arrival in Singapore, many British traders including Read became close to the governor. Through Read, Clarke learned of Raja Abdullah's problem and willingness to accept a British representative in his court if the British assisted the once apparent heir.|$|E
25|$|Together, {{semantic}} and {{episodic memory}} make up our declarative memory. They each represent {{different parts of}} context to form <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> <b>picture.</b> As such, something that affects episodic memory can also affect semantic memory. For example, anterograde amnesia, from damage of the medial temporal lobe, is an impairment of declarative memory that affects both episodic and semantic memory operations. Originally, Tulving proposed that episodic and semantic memory were separate systems that competed {{with each other in}} retrieval. However, this theory was rejected when Howard and Kahana completed experiments on latent semantic analysis (LSA) that supported the opposite. Instead of an increase in semantic similarity when there was a decrease in the strength of temporal associations, the two worked together so semantic cues on retrieval were strongest when episodic cues were strong as well.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th {{century the}} Scottish {{physicist}} James Clerk Maxwell {{found a new}} way of explaining colours, by the wavelength of their light. He showed that white light could be created by combining red, blue and green light, and that virtually all colours could be made by different combinations of these three colours. His idea, called additive colour or the RGB colour model, is used today to create colours on televisions and computer screens. The screen is covered by tiny pixels, each with three fluorescent elements for creating red, green and blue light. If the red, blue and green elements all glow at once, the pixel looks white. As the screen is scanned from behind with electrons, each pixel creates its own designated colour, composing <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> <b>picture</b> on the screen.|$|E

25|$|The naïve Roofline {{provides}} just {{an upper}} bound (the theoretical maximum) to performance. Although {{it can still}} give useful insights on the attainable performance, it does not provide <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> <b>picture</b> of what is actually limiting it. If for instance the considered kernel or application performs far below the Roofline, it might be useful to capture other performance ceilings, other than simple peak bandwidth and performance, to better guide the programmer on which optimization to implement, or even to assess the suitability of the architecture used {{with respect to the}} analyzed kernel or application. The added ceilings impose then a limit on the attainable performance that is below the actual Roofline, and indicate that the kernel or application cannot break through anyone of these celining without first performing the associated optimization.|$|E
25|$|Two flight {{recorder}}s, {{the cockpit}} voice recorder (CVR) and the flight data recorder (FDR), were recovered undamaged from the crash site during the afternoon/early evening of 10 April, as was confirmed by Sergey Shoygu, the Russian Minister of Emergency Situations. That evening, {{it was reported that}} the CVR recordings confirmed the crew attempted to land against the advice of air traffic controllers. A third flight recorder, a Quick Access Recorder (QAR) designed for maintenance diagnostics, was found on 12 April. The two Flight Management System (FMS) units were also recovered. The investigation was able to obtain information from the electronic memories of the Quick Access Recorder and one of the FMS units, {{despite the fact that they}} were not designed to withstand a crash. Since the FMS units are linked together, being able to read the memory of one meant the investigation was able to determine the actions performed by both units. It would later be discovered that the FDR was partially defective and had occasional gaps in its data, but as the QAR managed to survive the crash, by synchronizing the data from the two units, <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> <b>picture</b> of flight data emerged.|$|E
25|$|After World War II {{ended in}} 1945, {{commercial}} {{fishing in the}} United States experienced a boom as demand for fish to feed a growing population attracted international investment. International meetings to discuss fishery issues of common interest increased in frequency and stature, and Sette was a U.S. representative at many of these. The sardine fishery quickly declined alarmingly, and in response the California state government in 1947 created a Marine Research Committee made up of fishing industry representatives, with Sette as its scientific advisor. Sette, who had pondered fluctuating fisheries since 1920, was influential in the committee′s decision to create the California Cooperative Sardine Research Program, which in 1953 was renamed the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI), in which five U.S. Government agencies, California state government agencies, and universities took part. Sette played {{a prominent role in}} planning the new effort, and in doing so made one of his greatest contributions to the maturation of fisheries science by pioneering the integration of fisheries research with that of oceanography and meteorology to gain <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> <b>picture</b> {{of the impact of the}} environment on fisheries.|$|E
