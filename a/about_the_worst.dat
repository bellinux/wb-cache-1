In Rowling's words, [...] "it is <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> {{kept secret}} on this website that I am {{a huge fan}} of The Leaky Cauldron," [...] which she calls a [...] "wonderfully well {{designed}} mine of accurate information on all things Harry Potter." [...] On another occasion, Rowling has called the Leaky Cauldron her [...] "favourite fan site." [...] In 2006, the Brazilian website Potterish was the only site honoured, in recognition of its [...] "style, [...] Potter-expertise and [...] responsible reporting." ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{newspaper}} columnist dismissed Miller as [...] "a Republican strategist's dream opponent. He's as charismatic as a toaster, wonkier than Al Gore and as proudly liberal as Al Franken. And at just <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> time {{ever to be}} one, he's a lobbyist. He's a total contrast to Allen; no cowboy boots or chewing tobacco here." [...] AFL-CIO National Executive Director Michael W. Gildea said: [...] "...Miller is truly one of the bad guys. Over and over again on core issues like trade, immigration, overtime protections and privatization of federal jobs, he’s not only been on the wrong side, he’s been galvanizing corporate efforts against us." ...|$|E
2500|$|Duke University Provost Peter Lange responded, [...] "I cannot {{tell you}} how disappointed, saddened and appalled I was to receive this letter from you. A form of {{prejudice}} - one felt so often by minorities whether they be African American, Jewish or other - is the act of prejudgment: to presume that one knows something 'must' have been done by or done to someone because {{of his or her}} race, religion or other characteristic." [...] He continued, [...] "We do not know much <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> of what may have happened in the incident that has inflamed our community," [...] and concluded, [...] "Sadly, letters like yours do little to advance our common cause." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ludlow’s {{account was}} {{probably}} flavored by {{the tale of}} opium addiction which formed the model for his book: Thomas DeQuincey’s Confessions of an English Opium-Eater. But Ludlow’s “addiction” is curiously missing signs of physical withdrawal symptoms — terrible nightmares are <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> symptom he specifies. He takes up tobacco smoking to help him through his “suffering,” but this suffering seems mostly to be from disappointment at the dreary colors and unfantastic drudgery of sober life, rather than from any physical pain (ironically, his incipient nicotine addiction {{may have been the}} real source of any physical suffering he experienced; he writes at one point that “to defer for an hour the nicotine indulgence was to bring on a longing for the cannabine which was actual pain.”): ...|$|E
2500|$|On 1 May 2006, the Crown-in-Council, on {{the advice}} of Prime Minister Stephen Harper, {{announced}} the launch of a full public inquiry into the bombing, headed by retired Supreme Court Justice John Major, to find [...] "answers to several key questions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> mass murder in Canadian history." [...] Initiated later in June, the Commission of Inquiry into the Investigation of the Bombing of Air India Flight 182 was to examine how Canadian law restricted funding terrorist groups, how well witness protection is provided in terrorist cases, if Canada needed to upgrade its aviation security, and if issues of co-operation between the RCMP, CSIS, and other law enforcement agencies had been resolved. It was to also provide a forum wherein families of the victims could testify on the impact of the bombing and would not repeat any criminal trials.|$|E
2500|$|Keane {{returned}} as captain the side the following season, and guided {{them to a}} treble of the FA Premier League, FA Cup, and UEFA Champions League. In an inspirational display against Juventus in the second leg of the Champions League semi-final, he helped haul his team back from two goals down to win 3–2, scoring the first United goal. His performance in this game {{has been described as}} his finest hour as a footballer. Keane, however, received a yellow card after a trip on Zinedine Zidane that ruled him out of the final. United defeated Bayern Munich 2–1 in the final, but Keane had mixed emotions about the victory due to his suspension. Recalling his thoughts before the game, Keane said, [...] "Although I was putting a brave face on it, this was just <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> experience I'd had in football." [...] Later that year, Keane scored the only goal in the final of the Intercontinental Cup, as United defeated Palmeiras in Tokyo.|$|E

2500|$|Van Vliet's {{arrival in}} Salt Lake City was welcomed {{cautiously}} by the Mormon leadership. Van Vliet {{had been previously}} known by the Latter-day Saints in Iowa, and they trusted and respected him. However, he found the residents of Utah determined to defend themselves. He interviewed leaders and townspeople and [...] "...attended Sunday services, heard emotional speeches, and saw the Saints raise their hands in a unanimous resolution to guard against any 'invader.'" [...] Van Vliet {{found it impossible to}} persuade resentful Mormon leaders that the Army had peaceful intentions. He quickly recognized that supplies or accommodations for the Army would not be forthcoming. But Young told Van Vliet that the Mormons did not desire war, and [...] "if we can keep the peace for this winter I do think there will be something turned up that may save the shedding of blood." [...] However, marking a change from earlier pronouncements, Young declared that under threat from an approaching army he would not allow the new governor and federal officers to enter Utah. Nevertheless, Van Vliet told Young that he believed that the Mormons [...] "have been lied <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> of any people I ever saw." [...] He promised to stop the Utah Expedition on his own authority, and on September 14 he returned east through the Mormon fortifications then being built in Echo Canyon (see below).|$|E
2500|$|Most of the negativity {{focused on}} the overuse of special effects, {{thinness}} of plot, and excessive use of clichés. Roger Ebert {{went so far as}} to say, [...] "The movie Ed Wood, <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> director of all time, was made to prepare us for Stargate". Ebert awarded the film one out of four stars; and, even over ten years later, Stargate remained on his list of most hated films. Mike DiBella from Allmovie said, [...] "There simply isn't enough spectacle in Stargate to make up for its many flaws." [...] The film peaked at number one on the Billboard chart Top Video Rentals on April 29, 1995. However, the positive reviews stated that it was an [...] "instant camp classic" [...] and praised the film for its special effects and entertainment value, with Chris Hicks of the Deseret News calling it [...] "Star Wars meets Ben Hur". Scott McKenzie from DVDactive said, [...] "It's a shame because the world created around the Stargate is compelling and detailed. It's almost enough to make me want to watch the TV series, but not quite." [...] After the release of the movie, Emmerich and Devlin were sued by an Egyptology student, claiming he had written the story and given them the idea. The suit was later settled out of court.|$|E
