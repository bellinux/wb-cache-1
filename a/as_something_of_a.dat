5|$|In United States {{railroad}} terminology, a troop sleeper was {{a railroad}} passenger car {{which had been}} constructed to serve <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mobile barracks (essentially, a sleeping car) for transporting troops over distances sufficient to require overnight accommodations. This method allowed part of the trip to be made overnight, {{reducing the amount of}} transit time required and increasing travel efficiency.|$|E
5|$|Anti-Earp {{writers and}} {{researchers}} use Frank Waters' Earp Brothers of Tombstone, {{as their primary}} source for material that presents Wyatt Earp <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> villainous monster, aided and abetted by his brothers who were almost brutes. Waters detested the Earps so badly that he presented a book that was terribly flawed, poorly edited, and brimming with prevarications. In his other work, Waters is poetic. In the Earp Brothers of Tombstone, he {{is little more than}} a tabloid hack, trying to slander someone he dislikes. To date, no reason has been uncovered for the bias Frank Waters exhibited against Wyatt Earp and his brothers.|$|E
5|$|As I {{was reading}} about Cope and Marsh, I ran across Knight <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bit player in their lives. As I got {{further into the}} Cope and Marsh story, and I liked the two less and less as people—which is {{different}} from liking them as characters, of course—I {{wanted to have a}} character in the book for the readers to root for, and neither of the scientists could fill that role. When I found out that Knight had met Cope just before Cope died, I became convinced that he was the character I needed.|$|E

5|$|Contemporaries {{regarded}} Organt <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> salacious novelty and it {{was quickly}} banned, but censors who tried to confiscate it discovered that few copies were available anywhere. It did not sell well and resulted in a financial loss for its author. The public's taste for literature had changed in the prelude to the Revolution, and Saint-Just's taste changed with it: aside from a few pages of an unfinished novel found amidst his papers {{at the end of}} his life, Saint-Just devoted his future writing entirely to undecorated essays of social and political theory. With his previous ambitions of literary and lawyerly fame unfulfilled, Saint-Just directed his focus on the single goal of revolutionary command.|$|E
5|$|Head I, {{completed}} late in 1948, {{is considered}} {{more successful than}} Head II. Although it is well-regarded critically, Head II is seen <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> creative cul-de-sac, while Heads III, IV and V are usually considered as merely intermediate steps towards HeadVI. It is exceptional in Bacon's oeuvre that works of their relative poor quality survive; he was ruthlessly self-critical and often slashed or abandoned canvasses before they were completed. When pressed again by Brausen in 1953 to produce works for a New York show {{that she had been}} publicising for a year, he was full of doubt and destroyed most of what he had been working on, including several other popes.|$|E
5|$|The {{pursuit of}} full {{dominion}} status was then regarded <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> non-issue by most Southern Rhodesian politicians. They viewed themselves as virtually independent already; they lacked only the foreign affairs portfolio and taking this on would mean having to shoulder the expense for high commissions and embassies overseas. Huggins and the United Party instead pursued an initially semi-independent Federation with Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, two protectorates directly administered from London, {{with the hope}} of ultimately creating a single, united dominion in south-central Africa.|$|E
50|$|Penrose's Law {{states that}} the {{population}} size of prisons and psychiatric hospitals are inversely related, although this is generally viewed <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> oversimplification.|$|R

50|$|In Australia, it {{is known}} as brawn or Presswurst. It is usually seen <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> old-fashioned dish, {{although}} various large firms, such as Don Smallgoods and KR Castlemaine produce it.|$|R
5|$|Constantine {{received}} a formal education at Diocletian's court, {{where he learned}} Latin literature, Greek, and philosophy. The cultural environment in Nicomedia was open, fluid and socially mobile, and Constantine could mix with intellectuals both pagan and Christian. He may have attended the lectures of Lactantius, a Christian scholar of Latin in the city. Because Diocletian did not completely trust Constantius—none of the Tetrarchs fully trusted their colleagues—Constantine was held <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hostage, a tool to ensure Constantius's best behavior. Constantine was nonetheless a prominent member of the court: he fought for Diocletian and Galerius in Asia, and served {{in a variety of}} tribunates; he campaigned against barbarians on the Danube in 296AD, and fought the Persians under Diocletian in Syria (297AD) and under Galerius in Mesopotamia (298–299AD). By late 305AD, he had become a tribune of the first order, a tribunus ordinis primi.|$|E
5|$|The roman {{designs of}} Garamond which are his most imitated {{were based on}} a font cut around 1495 for the Venetian printer Aldus Manutius by {{engraver}} Francesco Griffo. This was first used in the book De Aetna, a short work by poet and cleric Pietro Bembo which was Manutius' first printing in the Latin alphabet after a long series of publications of classics of Greek literature that won him an international reputation. Historian Beatrice Warde has assessed De Aetna <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pilot project, a small book printed to a higher standard than Manutius' norm. Among other details, this font popularised the idea that in printing the cross-stroke of the 'e' should be level instead of slanting upwards to the right like handwriting, something imitated in almost all type designs since.|$|E
25|$|In {{what was}} seen <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tribute to Glory's past, the 2009–10 strip reverted to the {{vertical}} stripes, {{similar to what}} {{can be found on}} Glory's jersey of 1996–97.|$|E
2500|$|Vallée's {{opposition}} to the popular ETH was not well received by prominent U.S. ufologists, hence he was viewed <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> outcast. Indeed, Vallée refers to himself as a [...] "heretic among heretics".|$|R
50|$|Jaramillo had {{previously}} run against Pick for mayor, unsuccessfully, and her 1994 election was viewed <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> upset, {{since she had}} been outspent by her opponents and she had trailed in pre-election polls.|$|R

25|$|Certain {{political}} parties will provide transport for voters {{to and from}} the voting centre. While campaigning is not allowed on election day, transportation is seen <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> social service, especially since many people did not have a personal means of conveyance until the last decade or two, as of 2004.|$|E
25|$|In 1906, {{working at}} the Bateau Lavoir, Picasso {{continued}} to explore new directions; portraying monumental female figures standing in abstract interior spaces. Now, {{in addition to the}} bathers of Cézanne, Spanish romanesque art and Iberian sculpture provide a prominent influences for Picasso. Around this time he also created a self-portrait depicting himself <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> latter-day Cézanne.|$|E
50|$|Electric Shadows: The Story <b>Of</b> <b>A</b> Cinema (Co-producer with Harriet Pike) in 2009. This {{documentary}} {{looks at}} the history of the Electric Shadows cinema, and considers its emergence <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> icon in the Canberra cultural scene.|$|R

50|$|KYOURadio was {{the first}} radio station to have output that is 100% based on podcasts, or user-generated content. Announcing the change of format, CBS Radio chief {{executive}} Joel Hollander described the new format <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> experiment. The first program was from podcast veteran Dave Winer.|$|R
25|$|Coming off {{a regular}} season conference title, {{the team was}} {{obviously}} dejected in not going further, and this served <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> chip of their shoulder heading into the next season. In the stands, the club experienced another solid but unspectacular year averaging 5,983 (announced), but dipped well below that during the post season, seeing only 4,638 {{show up for the}} conference final game versus St. Louis.|$|E
25|$|After {{this basic}} training, {{the third group}} were {{assigned}} specializations, with Collins receiving his first choice of pressure suits and EVA (spacewalk). His job was to monitor the development and act <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> go-between for the Astronaut Office and the contractors. As such he was annoyed when during the secretive planning of Ed White's EVA on Gemini 4, he was not involved.|$|E
25|$|The lyrics tell part of {{the story}} of Jesus of Nazareth. Mercury, {{credited}} with writing the song, was a Parsi Zoroastrian. The track features a two-chord rhythm section during the verses with a long instrumental break {{toward the end of the}} song. Because of the effects created by May's Red Special guitar, among other things, many early followers of Queen viewed the band <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> psychedelic rock band.|$|E
50|$|Robert Lindsay Mason (April 1942 - 25 August 2006), {{known as}} Lindsay Mason, was a unionist {{politician}} in Northern Ireland.

5000|$|Kénôse is an EP by {{the black}} metal band Deathspell Omega, {{released}} in 2005 under The Ajna Offensive. It continues the avant-garde and progressive direction they had been exploring on 2004's Si monvmentvm reqvires, circvmspice, and is considered by the band <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> [...] "appendix" [...] to that album.|$|R
50|$|Almost {{two decades}} on, Dave had another near-death experience, one which served <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> epiphany when he {{contracted}} pneumonia.

25|$|Following the 2006 local elections, Tony Blair demoted Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, and {{appointed}} Margaret Beckett as his successor. She {{was the first}} woman to hold the post, and only the second woman to hold one of the great offices of state (after Margaret Thatcher). Beckett's appointment came <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> surprise, for the media and for Beckett herself. She admitted reacting to the news with a four-letter word.|$|E
25|$|Garfield's {{assassination}} {{was instrumental}} {{to the passage}} of the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act on January 16, 1883. Garfield himself had called for civil service reform in his inaugural address and supported it as President in the belief that it would make government more efficient. It was passed <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> memorial to the fallen President. Arthur lost the Republican Party nomination in 1884 to Blaine, who went on to lose a close election to Democrat Grover Cleveland.|$|E
25|$|The {{incumbent}} Liberal Democrats {{were pushed}} into third place behind Labour. Although the plans had been {{blocked by the}} time of the poll, proposals to convert a nursing home in the ward into a centre for asylum seekers were seen as a key election issue. Developments in Burnley and Blackburn were regarded <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> renaissance for the far right in British politics; no such councillors had been elected in the UK since victories in Tower Hamlets nearly ten years before.|$|E
50|$|Indeed, Takeminakatas {{portrayal}} in the Kojiki and the Kuji Hongi as one {{who suffered}} a humiliating defeat was apparently seen <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> embarrassment during the Middle Ages, leading to the appearance of alternative stories which portray Suwa Myōjins origins in a more positive light such as the Kōga Saburō legend.|$|R
50|$|Meganthropus {{is a name}} {{commonly}} {{given to}} several large jaw and skull fragments found at the Sangiran site near Surakarta in Central Java, Indonesia.

50|$|The {{game was}} not {{developed}} with an overarching plot structure {{in mind and}} this was implemented <b>as</b> <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> afterthought {{towards the end of}} development.
