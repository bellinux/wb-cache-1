25|$|The Archives is {{involved}} in research projects and in the publishing of books and scholarly papers, mostly {{in the fields of}} <b>archival</b> <b>science,</b> history, and law. Its publishing activities are mostly realised through the Association of Archivists of Republika Srpska, which also organises seminars for registry employees. The Archives cooperates with related institutions in other countries, and it has signed agreements on cooperation with the Archives of Serbia, Archives of Yugoslavia, Croatian State Archives, State Archives of the Republic of Macedonia, Budapest City Archives, International Institute for <b>Archival</b> <b>Science</b> of Trieste and Maribor, and a number of regional archives in Serbia. This cooperation is primarily reflected in exchanges of exhibitions of archival materials. As part of marking the First World War centenary in 2014, the Archives of Republika Srpska prepared the exhibition Young Bosnia and the Sarajevo Assassination, which toured Belgrade and other cities in Serbia, as well as Skopje in Macedonia. The Archives is designated as a central institution {{for the protection of the}} cultural heritage of Republika Srpska, along with the institutions such as the National and University Library of Republika Srpska and the Museum of Modern Art of Republika Srpska.|$|E

In this generation we have one foot in the world of paper and the other now firmly planted in the electronic realm.
