5|$|Larrys Creek flows {{south from}} the {{dissected}} Allegheny Plateau to the Ridge-and-valley Appalachians. It rises in Cogan House Township <b>and</b> <b>flows</b> south to Green Mountain. There it turns southwest <b>and</b> <b>flows</b> under the Cogan House Covered Bridge, {{which is on}} the National Register of Historic Places and one of only three remaining covered bridges in Lycoming County. At Buckhorn Mountain it turns south through Pennsylvania State Game Lands (SGL) No. 114 <b>and</b> <b>flows</b> through Mifflin and Anthony Townships, passing between Coal Mountain and Harris Point. From Mifflin Township it enters the borough of Salladasburg, where it receives the Second Fork, and just south of the borough the First Fork joins the creek. These two largest tributaries drain parts of Pine, Cogan House, Cummings, and Mifflin Townships (there are named streams in the Larrys Creek watershed in all but Pine Township). Piatt Township is the last municipality the creek flows through and it enters the West Branch Susquehanna River there.|$|E

Experimental results are evaluated in three conditions. First, a fixed pressure value is set <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> value is varied as step. Second, a fixed flow value is set while varying pressure value. Final, both pressure <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> value is simultaneously varied.

5|$|The terrain in the Trout Creek Mountains {{varies from}} broad, flat basins and rolling ridges to high rock escarpments cut by deep canyons. The canyons have steep walls with loose talus slopes at the bottoms. There are meadows around springs in the mountains, {{although}} most streams {{in the range}} do not flow year-round. Major streams that flow off the north slopes of the mountains include (from west to east) Cottonwood Creek, Trout Creek, Willow Creek, and Whitehorse Creek. These streams all flow into endorheic basins in Harney County, Oregon. Trout Creek and Whitehorse Creek are {{the largest of the}} four. The Kings River and McDermitt Creek each drain an area on the south slopes of the Trout Creek Mountains. The Kings River begins in The Granites <b>and</b> <b>flows</b> south into Nevada, where it meets the Quinn River, which evaporates in the Black Rock Desert. McDermitt Creek begins in Oregon a few miles north of The Granites <b>and</b> <b>flows</b> generally east, crossing the Oregon–Nevada border five times before disappearing into the floor of the Quinn River Valley south of McDermitt.|$|E
5|$|About 40percent of the tributaries that {{originally}} flowed {{over the surface}} of the watershed were piped or relocated during urban development, especially {{on the north side of}} the main stem. Generally, the remaining free-flowing tributaries begin south of the main stem and run north; the major exception is Crystal Springs Creek, which begins as a groundwater discharge <b>and</b> <b>flows</b> south. The other major tributaries are Hogan, Kelley, Butler, Sunshine, and Badger creeks. Crystal Springs and Kelley creeks contribute more flow to the main stem than the other tributaries.|$|E
5|$|As {{the creek}} enters Union Township, its valley briefly becomes very deep before {{becoming}} shallower again. It picks up Dark Run in the township. The creek flows along the East Union Township/Union Township border before entering North Union Township. Upon entering North Union Township, Catawissa Creek flows northwards {{until it reaches}} the community of Zion Grove, where it takes a sharp turn northwest. At Zion Grove, {{the walls of the}} creek's valley again become considerably higher and steeper. As it exits Zion Grove, it picks up Tomhicken Creek. Catawissa Creek takes a sharp turn to the west <b>and</b> <b>flows</b> under Red Ridge. At the western edge of Red Ridge, the creek takes a sharp turn northwards, followed shortly afterwards by a gentle turn westwards. It picks up Crooked Run at the edge of North Union Township, and then flows into Columbia County.|$|E
40|$|Spiritual {{well-being}} <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> {{are important}} religious constructs, one reflecting Christian {{and the other}} Buddhist perspectives. Moberg (1971) theorized that spiritual well-being involves a vertical dimension with God and a horizontal dimension with other humans and the physical world. Csikszentmihalyi (1990) developed the concept of flow as a state of optimal human functioning and hypothesized a relationship between <b>flow</b> <b>and</b> spirituality. Following Csikszentmihalyi (2005), we suspected <b>flow</b> <b>and</b> spiritual well-being are somewhat related constructs despite their disparate origins. While research has explored the relationship between spirituality <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> within particular experiences (Phillips, 2007; Purdey & Dupey, 2005), our study examined how experiences of flow may become generalized into a global sense of spiritual well-being. Our study investigated: (a) the relationship between spiritual well-being <b>and</b> <b>flow,</b> (b) convergent <b>and</b> divergent validity for measures of spiritual well-being <b>and</b> <b>flow,</b> (c) possible predictors of spiritual well-being <b>and</b> <b>flow...</b>|$|R
40|$|Based on {{preceding}} researches on {{the plan}} of reducing urban heat island through introduction of wind path, this study analyzed the effects that the change of land cover, which is resulted from urbanization, brought about on the cold air formation <b>and</b> <b>flow.</b> Dalseo-gu district in Daegu {{was selected as the}} subject and research was carried out about the urban micro-climate change in 1987, 1997 and 2007. Research showed that increased artificial land cover was unfavorable to the cold air formation <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> <b>and</b> the quantity and height of cold air downtown remarkably lowered. This implied that cold air formation <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> is influenced by land cover. Simulation in main zones of cold air formation <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> showed that the cold air formation <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> became positive after the areas are turned into natural land cover. To secure continuous cold air formation <b>and</b> <b>flow,</b> it is judged that the spatial characteristics of {{the outskirts of the city}} should be analyzed to carry out urban development or urban restoration, and through the process, to formulate a pleasant and healthy town...|$|R

5|$|At {{atmospheric}} pressure, {{molecular nitrogen}} condenses (liquefies) at 77K (−195.79°C) and freezes at 63K (−210.01°C) into the beta hexagonal close-packed crystal allotropic form. Below 35.4K (−237.6°C) nitrogen assumes the cubic crystal allotropic form (called the alpha phase). Liquid nitrogen, a colourless fluid resembling water in appearance, but with 80.8% of the density (the density of liquid nitrogen at its boiling point is 0.808g/mL), {{is a common}} cryogen. Solid nitrogen has many crystalline modifications. It forms a significant dynamic surface coverage on Pluto and outer moons of the Solar System such as Triton. Even at the low temperatures of solid nitrogen it is fairly volatile and can sublime to form an atmosphere, or condense back into nitrogen frost. It is very weak <b>and</b> <b>flows</b> {{in the form of}} glaciers and on Triton geysers of nitrogen gas come from the polar ice cap region.|$|E

The valley gets deeper and the stream receives several small tributaries. It turns southwest shortly downstream {{of the mouth}} of Elkhorn Run. In the southern reaches of the township, the stream receives the tributary Bell Branch and turns south-southeast, exiting Eulalia Township.|$|E
5|$|Hull Creek {{begins in}} a pond in Scott Township. It flows {{south-southwest}} {{for more than a}} mile before turning south. Several tenths of a mile further downstream, the creek turns south-southeast, flowing through a water gap alongside Pennsylvania Route 247 and entering Blakely. After several tenths of a mile, the creek crosses a highway <b>and</b> <b>flows</b> south-southwest in a much smaller valley.

5|$|Icings – Roofs {{must also}} be {{designed}} to avoid ice dams, which result from meltwater running under the snow {{on the roof and}} freezing at the eave. Ice dams on roofs form when accumulated snow on a sloping roof melts <b>and</b> <b>flows</b> down the roof, under the insulating blanket of snow, until it reaches below freezing temperature air, typically at the eaves. When the meltwater reaches the freezing air, ice accumulates, forming a dam, and snow that melts later cannot drain properly through the dam. Ice dams may result in damaged building materials or in damage or injury when the ice dam falls off or from attempts to remove ice dams. The melting results from heat passing through the roof under the highly insulating layer of snow.|$|E
