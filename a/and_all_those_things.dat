500|$|In {{his third}} term as Leader, Treatt criticised {{government}} cuts in transport services, but supported reductions in death duty taxes. At a Remembrance Day address in 1952, Treatt criticised radical student politics embodied by the [...] "long-haired intellectual types": [...] "My {{belief in the}} value of university life and in higher education generally is a strong and abiding one...the sort of long-haired type I am thinking about may not even have a university degree. He is encased in self satisfied assurance of his own mental superiority." [...] In his speech at the Lyceum Hall, Treatt warned of Australia's attitudes on its success: [...] "A sort of mental haze seems to obscure the vision splendid that lies before this country. We are proud of being a British country, a country with British traditions, institutions, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> which go to make up what we call our 'British heritage. But this pride is not matched by a pride in being Australian. This seems to me one of the strongest sources of our weakness." ...|$|E
2500|$|Paisley {{and actress}} Kimberly Williams began dating in 2001. Paisley had first seen Williams in Father of the Bride. [...] Paisley {{has stated that}} he watched Williams' {{performance}} and thought [...] "She seems like a great girl — smart and funny <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> that are so hard to find." [...] In 2002, Williams appeared in a video for the song [...] "I'm Gonna Miss Her (The Fishin' Song)", the last release from his Part II album. The two married on March 15, 2003, at Stauffer Chapel {{on the campus of}} Pepperdine University after a nine-month engagement. They live in Franklin, Tennessee, and had another home in Pacific Palisades that was sold in 2013.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 October 2012, his 50th birthday, Flea gave an {{interview}} with CNN discussing the Chili Peppers and {{was asked if he}} plans to continue with them. Flea responded by saying [...] "I love the Chili Peppers, and I would love to. If there's anything I know, it's every time you start making plans, you don't know what's going to come up next. Anything can happen. So I love being in the Chili Peppers and it's my home, and I've been doing it for more than half my life. Of course, during the course of doing it, there's been all kinds of ups and downs, and moments of extreme (positivity), floating on clouds of greatness, and times of just groveling, and misery, and uncertainty, and anger, and love <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>things.</b> Like being in a family. I really can't predict. But I love being in it for now, and right now, about as far as I'm thinking is getting through this tour that we're doing, performing at the highest level possible, then hunkering down and writing another record." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't be solemn, Rose. It fidgets me {{to think}} about life-times, <b>and</b> respecting, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> {{responsible}} <b>things.</b> I'm not used to it, and I don't know how to do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|AUNT MARY. I suppose so. It's a well-managed road. They've got the air- brake, I've heard, and the Miller platform, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> horrid <b>things.</b> What {{makes you}} {{introduce}} such unpleasant subjects? ...|$|R
60|$|Now he was rich, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> he had desired {{could be}} his.|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{make him}} go; he went himself. He liked {{to look at}} the books, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> in the glass cases. He knows all about them; he knows all about everything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a great deal. Most of {{my stuff}} {{is in my}} trunk. But the case alone was worth six dollars, and it had my comb and brush and {{toothbrush}} <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> in it." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{the title}} of highness, and of a princess, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> fine <b>things,</b> as they came in, weighed down <b>all</b> this; <b>and</b> the sense of {{gratitude}} vanished {{as if it had}} been a shadow.|$|R
6000|$|... 'She has not {{had half}} your {{training}} in boldness, with your inspectors <b>and</b> examinations, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> horrid <b>things.</b> Why, you never thought of taking fright before, even when you have sung to people here. Why should you now?' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{would never}} wear your funky old clothes, {{you are a}} woman <b>and</b> can do <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>things,</b> <b>and</b> yet you don't. That's such a waste!" [...] - Danielle Lindenmuth ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She may act very beautifully, Munseer, but she don't dress so; and I am {{very glad}} they threw that orange-peel <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> at her, {{and that the}} people waved to her to get off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm afraid I'm getting gushy. Miss Hartenstein--she's in my department--she'd {{laugh at}} me.... But I do love birds and {{squirrels}} and pussy-willows <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>things.</b> In summer I {{love to go}} on picnics on Staten Island or tramp in Van Cortlandt Park." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They would be, without Henrietta," [...] said Queen Bee, [...] "but she {{was always}} {{excellent}} as wreath weaving, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> that belong to choice taste and clever fingers. Only let us have plenty of the wherewithal, {{and we will do}} our work so as to amaze the parish." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And how ever she {{can stand}} up <b>and</b> say <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> for that girl, passes me!" [...] said Mrs. Tappitt, holding up both her hands. [...] "She was flighty herself, when young; she was, no doubt; and now I suppose she likes others to be the same. If that's what she calls manners, I shouldn't like her to take my girls about." ...|$|R
60|$|Q. Who {{are they}} that are poor in spirit?--A. They that are {{sensible}} of the want <b>and</b> necessity of <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> of God, that prepare {{a man to}} the kingdom of heaven.|$|R
60|$|GERALD. I {{believe you}} implicitly, darling. But do {{you happen to}} know me through and through, and in and out, all my past and present doings, mother? Have you a secret access to my room, and a spy-hole, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>things?</b> This is uncomfortably thrilling. You take on a new lustre.|$|E
60|$|Every {{improvement}} that is put {{upon the}} real estate {{is the result of}} an idea in somebody's head. The skyscraper is another idea; the railroad is another; the telephone <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> are merely symbols which represent ideas. An andiron, a wash-tub, is the result of an idea that did not exist before.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, any way,' Bat went on, 'I'm glad I always {{believed}} in God and Providence <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>things.</b> Else I should lose my nerve. We've {{put it over}} the whole world--the {{full extent of the}} geographical globe. We couldn't stop it if we wanted to now. It's got to burn itself out. I'm not in charge any more. What d'you expect'll happen next. Angels?' ...|$|E
60|$|He {{subscribed to}} the Ball Club, the Lacrosse Club, the Curling Club, to anything, in fact, <b>and</b> {{especially}} to <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> which needed premises {{to meet in}} and grew thirsty in their discussions.|$|R
6000|$|... “You {{never saw}} anyone so {{astonished}} as Mrs. Smith when I went in <b>and</b> ordered <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>things.</b> Her eyes opened wider and wider as I went on, and when I offered her the gold I {{thought she would}} have a fit. She took it and bit it {{to make sure that it}} was good, and then said: ‘Have you found it, Mrs. Hammond, or what good fortune have you had?’ ...|$|R
5000|$|Chad {{shares in}} regard to the album [...] "I can {{honestly}} say we made a record about love, cars, drinking, and drugs and sex <b>and</b> murder, <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> are elements of our record and I think that's pretty cool, what else do you want to listen to?, there's nothing better to listen to". Brett also shares that the record benefits from having [...] "bite and venom" [...] and that [...] "the album lyrically packs a lot more punch".|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{feel about}} it as I do. Of course, we have both lived too long, and seen {{too much of the}} world, to suppose we can control such things. The child is good, I haven't the least doubt, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> can be managed so that they wouldn't disgrace us. But she has had a certain sort of {{bringing}} up. I should prefer Tom to marry a girl with another sort, and this business venture of his increases the chances that he won't. That's all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, dear. You {{must have}} seen last night; that's impossible. Please don't argue about it now; I'm too tired. I {{just wanted to tell}} you I appreciated--And when you get back to America you won't be any the worse for playing around with poor Istra because she told you about {{different}} things from what you've played with, about rearing children as individuals and painting in tempera <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>things?</b> And--and I don't want you to get too fond of me, because we're--different.... But we have had an adventure, even if it was a little moist." [...] She paused; then, cheerily: [...] "Well, I'm going to beat it back and try to sleep again. Good-by, Mouse dear. No, don't come back to the Cara-advanced-serai. Play around and see the animiles. G'-by." ...|$|E
6000|$|In the end {{he decided}} to {{leave it to the}} {{sympathetic}} exponent of the fashionable religious cult, whose conversation had been so pleasing in the past. [...] "He will understand," [...] said Bindon with a sentimental sigh. [...] "He knows what Evil means--he understands something of the Stupendous Fascination of the Sphinx of Sin. Yes--he will understand." [...] By that phrase it was that Bindon was pleased to dignify certain unhealthy and undignified departures from sane conduct to which a misguided vanity and an ill-controlled curiosity had led him. He sat for a space thinking how very Hellenic and Italian and Neronic, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>things,</b> he had been. Even now--might one not try a sonnet? A penetrating voice to echo down the ages, sensuous, sinister, and sad. For a space he forgot Elizabeth. In the course of half an hour he spoilt three phonographic coils, got a headache, took a second dose to calm himself, and reverted to magnanimity and his former design.|$|E

But we weren't thinking like that." [...] It has been noted that British punk rock critics of disco were very supportive of the pro-black/anti-racist reggae genre. Christgau and Jim Testa have said that there were legitimate artistic reasons for being critical of disco.|$|R

6000|$|... "Breweries <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> sort of <b>things</b> necessitate {{money to}} start with; {{one has to}} pay {{premiums}} or invest capital in the undertaking, and so forth.

6000|$|Disko {{wiped the}} wet {{from his eyes}} and led the [...] "We're Here" [...] to Wouverman's wharf, giving his orders in whispers, while she swung round moored tugs and night-watchmen hailed her from the ends of inky-black piers. Over and above the {{darkness}} and {{the mystery of the}} procession, Harvey could feel the land close round him once more, with all its thousands of people asleep, and the smell of earth after rain, and the familiar noise of a switching-engine coughing to herself in a freight-yard; <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> made his heart beat and his throat dry up as he stood by the foresheet. They heard the anchor-watch snoring on a lighthouse-tug, nosed into a pocket of darkness where a lantern glimmered on either side; somebody waked with a grunt, threw them a rope, and they made fast to a silent wharf flanked with great iron-roofed sheds full of warm emptiness, and lay there without a sound.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is so different," [...] said Pauline Stacey, loftily. [...] "Batteries and motors <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> are {{marks of}} the force of man--yes, Mr. Flambeau, and the force of woman, too! We shall take our turn at these great engines that devour {{distance}} and defy time. That is high and splendid--that is really science. But these nasty props and plasters the doctors sell--why, they are just badges of poltroonery. Doctors stick on legs and arms {{as if we were}} born cripples and sick slaves. But I was free-born, Mr. Flambeau! People only think they need these things because they have been trained in fear instead of being trained in power and courage, just as the silly nurses tell children not to stare at the sun, and so they can't do it without blinking. But why among the stars should there be one star I may not see? The sun is not my master, and I will open my eyes and stare at him whenever I choose." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This upward {{scramble}} was short, and we {{soon found}} ourselves tramping along a broad road of flat roofs, broader than many big thoroughfares, with chimney-pots {{here and there}} that seemed in the haze as bulky as small forts. The asphyxiation of the fog seemed to increase the somewhat swollen and morbid anger under which my brain and body laboured. The sky <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> that are commonly clear seemed overpowered by sinister spirits. Tall spectres with turbans of vapour seemed to stand higher than the sun or moon, eclipsing both. I thought dimly of illustrations to the `Arabian Nights' on brown paper with rich but sombre tints, showing genii gathering round the Seal of Solomon. By the way, what was the Seal of Solomon? Nothing to do with sealing-wax really, I suppose; but my muddled fancy felt the thick clouds as being of that heavy and clinging substance, of strong opaque colour, poured out of boiling pots and stamped into monstrous emblems.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear Mr Chuzzlewit, what {{shocking}} words! Of course, I shall {{quarrel with}} him. I should quarrel with any husband. Married people always quarrel, I believe. But as to being miserable, <b>and</b> bitter, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> dreadful <b>things,</b> you know, why I couldn't be absolutely that, unless {{he always had}} the best of it; and I mean {{to have the best}} of it myself. I always do now,' cried Merry, nodding her head and giggling very much; 'for I make a perfect slave of the creature.' ...|$|R
60|$|St. Asaph's is episcopal. As a {{consequence}} {{it has in}} it <b>and</b> about it <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> which go {{to make up the}} episcopal church--brass tablets let into its walls, blackbirds singing in its elm trees, parishioners who dine at eight o'clock, and a rector who wears a little crucifix and dances the tango.|$|R
6000|$|... "No!" [...] I answered. [...] "Who are they? {{and who is}} to be his executioner? Surely, if he is {{all that}} you say there are laws under whose ban he must have come.
