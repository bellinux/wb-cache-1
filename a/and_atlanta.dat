Major depots were in Columbus, Athens <b>and</b> <b>Atlanta,</b> Georgia for the Army of Tennessee and Houston, Texas and Shreveport, Louisiana for the Trans-Mississippi forces.

This resulted in a varied set of uniforms worn by different Confederate units.|$|E

5|$|M-33 was {{designated}} by 1919 along {{a section of}} the current highway between Mio <b>and</b> <b>Atlanta.</b> The highway also included roadway segments south of Mio that are now parts of other trunklines. The portion south of Mio was rerouted in the mid-1920s, transferring sections to M-72 in the process. The state started extending M-33 in both directions in 1930s. The current highway segment between Onaway and Cheboygan was the former route of US Highway 23 (US23) until 1940 when the latter highway was realigned onto an alignment that runs along Lake Huron. Several minor changes have been made to M-33's routing since the 1950s to straighten out curves or finish paving the highway.|$|E

5|$|BCal {{entered into}} a bid to acquire at least one Concorde. However, BCal {{eventually}} arranged for two aircraft to be leased from BA and Aérospatiale respectively, to be maintained by either BA or Air France. BCal's envisaged two-Concorde fleet would have required {{a high level of}} aircraft usage to be cost-effective; therefore, BCal had decided to operate the second aircraft on a supersonic service between Gatwick <b>and</b> <b>Atlanta,</b> with a stopover at either Gander or Halifax. Consideration was given to services to Houston and various points on its South American network at a later stage. Both supersonic services were to be launched at some point during 1980; however, steeply rising oil prices caused by the 1979 energy crisis led to BCal shelving their supersonic ambitions.|$|E
