5|$|On Enterprise, T'Pol teaches some of {{the colonists}} how to evade edged-weapon attacks (from Vulcan martial-art 'Suus-mahna'), while Ensign Hoshi Sato (Linda Park) and Lieutenant Malcolm Reed (Dominic Keating) teach other colonists how to fire their weapons more accurately. Archer and Tucker then suggest the colonists shift the entire colony to the south 50 meters. When the Klingon marauders arrive, the colony appears deserted and silent. Finally the {{defenders}} show themselves, and in the ensuing fight the Klingons are lured into an area surrounded by the capped-off deuterium well heads. On cue, the wells are ignited, surrounding the Klingons with flames. Tessic then tells the Klingons to leave <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>come</b> back. After they depart, Archer is rewarded with 2,000 liters of deuterium by the grateful miners.|$|E
5|$|The Mounties arrive {{the next}} morning, in hot pursuit. Kripik {{prevents}} {{his eldest son}} from killing the Mounties, and says he will leave <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>come</b> back. Kripik departs on foot, but Iva professes her love and goes with him. The Mounties pursue them on foot across the ice, which is breaking up. Sergeant Hunt takes aim at Kripik with his rifle, but cannot shoot him because Kripik has saved their lives and exhibited more honor and decency than white men have. Kripik and Iva escape on an ice floe, Hunt calling out goodbye {{and good luck to}} them. Hunt tells Balk that the ice will take Kripik and Iva across the inlet, and that the adults will be able to return to Orsodikok and the other children next spring.|$|E

25|$|The Hercules was {{a monumental}} undertaking. It {{is the largest}} {{aircraft}} ever built. It is over five stories tall with a wingspan longer than a football field.

I have my reputation all rolled up in it and I have stated several times that if it's a failure, I'll probably leave this country <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>come</b> back. And I mean it.|$|E

By the late 1850s, they began to suspect a northern white abolitionist was secretly enticing their slaves away. They considered that John Brown himself {{had come to the}} Eastern Shore to lure slaves away before his ill-fated raid on Harper's Ferry in October 1859.|$|E
500|$|Album opener [...] "Bullshittin'" [...] was {{produced}} by Three 6 Mafia's Juicy J, and features a murky bassline with a calming vibe. The track is inspired {{by the sound of}} southern hip hop. [...] "Cookie Coma" [...] {{was produced}} by The Alchemist, and contains a jazzy beat, with lush horns and upright bass. The style of production is inspired by boom bap production, with prominent sounding drums.

500|$|Inside the {{underground}} {{part of the}} Orchid station, Ben puts every metal item he can find into a small compartment {{at the back of}} the room, while Locke watches the orientation video for the Orchid. On the tape, Pierre Chang (François Chau) begins to discuss time travel involving [...] "negatively charged exotic matter" [...] when the VCR malfunctions and the tape rewinds itself. Shortly, Keamy arrives and tells Locke that if he (Keamy) dies, the C4 on the freighter will detonate, due to a remote trigger linked to a heart rate monitor he is wearing. Regardless, Ben kills Keamy with no remorse or sympathy for those on the boat, in order to avenge his adopted daughter Alex (Tania Raymonde), whom Keamy executed. Ben seals and then activates power to the compartment he had loaded with metal items, blowing a hole in the back of it. Ben, now wearing a parka, tells Locke that whoever moves the island is forced to leave it <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>come</b> back; Ben must do it so that Locke can stay and lead the Others. Locke then goes to the Others, who welcome him home. Ben climbs through the hole and down a rocky tunnel beyond it into a frozen chamber, cutting his arm in the process. [...] He then turns a very large metal wheel. As he completes the rotation, an eerie sound and white-yellow light soon envelop the entire island. Ben disappears, only to reappear several months later in the Sahara Desert (as seen in [...] "The Shape of Things to Come").|$|E
2500|$|Parker travels back to {{the time}} of Malakai's arrival, and using clues he has picked up {{over the course of the}} game, reprograms Malakai, {{allowing}} him to return to his own time.

All that will pass is set back on course and will never suffer corruption. My past deeds forgiven, my past crimes reversed." [...] The game then cuts to 1912, on the same night the ship reported the lighthouse in darkness. As the fog rolls across the sky, the lighthouse reignites.|$|E

In his award-winning autobiography, More Please (1992), Humphries relates that he had created a character similar to Edna {{in the back of a}} bus while touring country Victoria in Twelfth Night with the MTC at the age of 20. He credited his then mentor, Peter O'Shaughnessy, that without his [...] "nurturing and promotion, the character of Edna Everage would have been nipped in the bud after 1956 <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>come</b> to flower, while the character of Sandy Stone would never have taken shape as a presence on the stage".|$|E
