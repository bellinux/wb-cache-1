Illustrative anatomical examples are presented. This natural, non-disease process appears to set conditions which may influence the effectiveness of botulinum toxin injection and our expectations for its success. Adductor spasmodic dysphonia, a type of laryngeal dystonia, is typically treated using botulinum toxin injections of the vocal folds in order to suppress adductory muscle spasms which are disruptive to production of speech and voice. A few studies have suggested diminished response to treatment in older patients with adductor spasmodic dysphonia. This retrospective study provides a reanalysis of existing pre-to-post treatment data as function of age. Perceptual judgments of speech produced by 42 patients with ADSD were made by two panels of professional listeners with expertise in voice or fluency of speech. Results demonstrate a markedly reduced positive response to botulinum toxin treatment in the older patients. Perceptual findings are further elucidated by means of <b>acoustic</b> <b>spectrography.</b> Literature on vocal aging is reviewed to provide a specific set of biological mechanisms that best account for the observed interaction of botulinum toxin treatment with advancing age...|$|E
40|$|This studY is an investigg-ation of the {{spectral}} and temporal {{characteristics of the}} sounds of the Egyptian dialect of Arabic, mainly as revealed by <b>acoustic</b> <b>spectrography.</b> The consonant sounds of Arabic speech are divided into groups according to their manner of articulation and are studied in separate chapters accordingly. Each chapter is divided into two main parts. In the first part we look into the articulatory mechanism for the production of the consonant under study, as well as at its acoustic theory of production. I. We also report the results of the acoustic analyses of sounds produced with the same mechanism in other languages as well as the results of synthetic speech experiments. In the second part of each chapter we report the results of the acoustic analysis of the Arabic consonant under investigation. In this part we study the temporal and spectral characteristics of the particular consonant in different word positions. We also study its effect on the direction and extent of the second-formant transitions of the adjacent vowels, as well as the effect of the adjacent vowel on the frequency positions of the components of the consonant spectrum. This part is then followed by a concluding section in which we provide an overall view of the specifics of the acoustics of that consonant and discuss the relevance of our findins on its -acoustics to the general theories of speech production and perception...|$|E

40|$|OBJETIVO: Verificar a relação entre o uso da estratégia de alongamento compensatório e a consciência do próprio desvio de fala e entre essa e diferentes hipóteses de escrita. MÉTODOS: Crianças com idades entre cinco anos, zero meses e 26 dias e seis anos, 11 meses e 26 dias e diagnóstico de desvio fonológico compuseram a amostra. Aplicou-se o Teste de Consciência do Próprio Desvio de Fala e a Avaliação da Hipótese de Escrita. A estratégia de alongamento compensatório foi identificada com auxílio da espectrografia acústica. Foram formados dois grupos: grupo que faz uso da estratégia de alongamento compensatório e grupo que não faz uso dessa estratégia. Analisou-se a relação entre o uso da estratégia estudada e a consciência do próprio desvio de fala individualmente e entre os grupos. Conforme a hipótese de escrita, a amostra foi dividida em grupo com hipótese de escrita pré-silábica e grupo com hipótese de escrita silábica. Os dados foram analisados através do teste estatístico Kruskal-Wallis. RESULTADOS: Os resultados demonstraram que o grupo que não fez uso da estratégia de alongamento compensatório obteve média {{superior}} na consciência do próprio desvio de fala ao grupo que fez uso da estratégia. O grupo com hipótese de escrita silábica obteve média superior ao grupo pré-silábico na consciência do próprio desvio. CONCLUSÃO: As crianças podem fazer uso da estratégia de alongamento compensatório e não ter consciência do próprio desvio de fala; ou podem ter consciência do próprio desvio e não fazer uso dessa estratégia. Observou-se uma possível relação entre a consciência do próprio desvio de fala e a hipótese de escrita. PURPOSE: To {{verify the}} relationship between the use of the compensatory lengthening strategy and the awareness of their own speech impairment, as well as between the latest and different writing hypotheses. METHODS: The sample was composed by children with ages between five years, zero months and 26 days and six years, 11 days and 26 days, diagnosed with phonological disorder. The Awareness of Their Own Speech Impairment Test and the Writing Hypotheses Evaluation were carried out. The compensatory lengthening strategy was identified using <b>acoustic</b> <b>spectrography,</b> and subjects were divided into two groups: one that uses the compensatory lengthening strategy, and another one that does not use this strategy. It was analyzed the relation between the use of the compensatory lengthening strategy and the awareness of their own speech impairment, both individually and between the groups. The sample was also divided according to the writing hypotheses into a group with pre-syllabic and a group with syllabic writing hypothesis. Data were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. RESULTS: The results showed that the group that did not use the compensatory lengthening strategy had higher awareness of their own speech impairment than the group that used the compensatory lengthening strategy. The group with syllabic writing hypothesis achieved higher average than the group with pre-syllabic writing hypothesis regarding awareness of their own speech impairment. CONCLUSION: Children can either use the compensatory lengthening strategy and not be aware of their own Speech Impairment, or be aware and not use the strategy. It was observed a possible relationship between awareness of their own speech impairment and writing hypothesis...|$|E
