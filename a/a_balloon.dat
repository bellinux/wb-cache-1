40|$|This study {{investigated}} the tensile properties of <b>a</b> rotating or <b>ballooning</b> staple yarn. The {{results indicated that the}} effect of rotating speed on the tensile properties of <b>a</b> <b>ballooning</b> staple yarn was significant. As the yarn rotating speed increased, the tenacity of the rotating or ballooning yarn decreased, while the yarn breaking elongation increased. The effect of rotating speed on the tenacity of <b>a</b> <b>ballooning</b> staple yarn varied for different yarns. These results demonstrated that the breaking force of <b>a</b> <b>ballooning</b> yarn was much lower than the yarn breaking force obtained from normal tensile tests. These results provide new insight into the problems of yarn breakage in yarn spinning and twisting processes. <br /...|$|R

5|$|Ali Bhai visits Hyderabad and assassinates Narayana. He meets Pandu {{to discuss}} {{the murder of a}} {{minister}} by blowing up <b>a</b> <b>balloon.</b> Pandu rejects this as it would involve killing innocents. At the same time as they are arguing, Qadri arrests Ali Bhai and tortures him. Ali Bhai's henchmen retaliate by filming Qadri's daughter as she is enticed into sexual activity by the minister's son, and release it to the media. They also kidnap her, forcing the police to release Ali Bhai. At the same time, Pandu manages to catch the gangsters who pretended to rape Shruti and she reconciles with him.|$|E
5|$|Homing pigeons {{were used}} {{extensively}} in the 19th and early 20thcenturies, both for civil pigeon post and as war pigeons. In the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, the famous pigeon post of Paris carried up to 50,000microfilmed telegrams per pigeon flight from Tours into the besieged capital. Altogether 150,000 individual private telegrams and state dispatches were delivered. In an 1889 experiment of the Imperial Russian Technical Society at Saint Petersburg, {{the chief of the}} Russian balloon corps took aerial photographs from <b>a</b> <b>balloon</b> and sent the developed collodion film negatives to the ground by pigeon post.|$|E
5|$|In late July 1861, Lowe {{inflated}} <b>a</b> <b>balloon</b> in Washington with {{hopes of}} providing aerial {{coverage for the}} impending Battle of Bull Run, but a violent storm buffeted the inflated balloon and delayed Lowe until word of the Union defeat reached him on the road. Lowe subsequently {{decided to make a}} detour to Fort Corcoran, reaching it on July 27. Over the next few days, he repeatedly ascended in the balloon in order to make maps of the surrounding area and gather intelligence about Confederate troops advancing on Washington.|$|E

5|$|Myers and {{his wife}} did the first balloon {{ascension}} on the Fair grounds on July 4 to race the aeronaut Tracy A. Tisdell to draw crowds. A second ascension was done by Myers on August 27. He had <b>a</b> <b>balloon</b> race with professor G. E. Tomlinson to the Washington Monument. Both were unsuccessful. Myers landed 21 miles from his starting location and Tomlinson ended up hundreds of miles off course before he landed.|$|E
5|$|Myers {{resigned}} from the bank in 1867 and moved to Hornellsville, New York. There he bought a photography gallery and ran the business for several years. Myers met Mary Hawley in Hornellsville and married her on November 8, 1871. She was 7 years younger, being born in 1849. In 1873 Myers took up an interest in making hydrogen gas and ballooning. The couple moved back to Mohawk from Hornellsville in 1875 and began activities of balloon manufacturing and flying. Mary became his lab assistant and later <b>a</b> <b>balloon</b> pilot known as Carlotta, the Lady Aeronaut.|$|E
5|$|The first aerial {{photographs}} {{were taken in}} 1858 by the balloonist Nadar; in 1860 James Wallace Black took the oldest surviving aerial photographs, also from <b>a</b> <b>balloon.</b> As photographic techniques made further progress, {{at the end of}} the 19thcentury some pioneers placed cameras in unmanned flying objects. In the 1880s, Arthur Batut experimented with kite aerial photography. Many others followed him, and high-quality photographs of Boston taken with this method by William Abner Eddy in 1896 became famous. Amedee Denisse equipped a rocket with a camera and a parachute in 1888, and Alfred Nobel also used rocket photography in 1897.|$|E

Merry-go-round trains are used, so that wagons can be unloaded without the train stopping as it passes through an unloading house. On average, there are 35 deliveries a day, 6 days a week.|$|E
5|$|U-5 was {{commissioned}} into the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 1 April 1910, with Linienschiffsleutnant Urban Passerar in command. Over {{the next three}} years she served primarily as a training boat, making as many as ten training cruises per month. On 1 May 1911, she hosted a delegation of Peruvian Navy officers that inspected her. In June 1912, she towed <b>a</b> <b>balloon</b> as part of efforts to assess the underwater visibility of hull paint schemes.|$|E
5|$|After {{missions}} {{discovered the}} reality of the harsh nature of the planet's surface, attention shifted towards other targets such as Mars. There {{have been a number of}} proposed missions afterwards however, and many of these involve the little-known upper atmosphere. The Soviet Vega program in 1985 dropped two balloons into the atmosphere, but these were battery-powered and lasted for only about two Earth days each before running out of power. Since then, there has been no exploration of the upper atmosphere. In 2002, the NASA contractor Global Aerospace proposed <b>a</b> <b>balloon</b> that would be capable of staying in the upper atmosphere for hundreds of Earth days as opposed to two.|$|E

5|$|After the trachea {{has been}} intubated, <b>a</b> <b>balloon</b> cuff is {{typically}} inflated {{just above the}} far end of the tube to help secure it in place, to prevent leakage of respiratory gases, and to protect the tracheobronchial tree from receiving undesirable material such as stomach acid. The tube is then secured to the face or neck and connected to a T-piece, anesthesia breathing circuit, bag valve mask device, or a mechanical ventilator. Once there is no longer a need for ventilatory assistance and/or protection of the airway, the tracheal tube is removed; this is referred to as extubation of the trachea (or decannulation, in the case of a surgical airway such as a cricothyrotomy or a tracheotomy).|$|E
5|$|Both monthly {{and daily}} Yotsuba&! {{calendars}} {{have been released}} every year since 2005, although a monthly calendar for 2009 was not released due to constraints on Azuma's schedule. The 2005 edition of the monthly calendar featured pictures of Yotsuba playing with animals such as lions, zebras, and kangaroos. The 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2010 editions feature photographs altered to include Yotsuba doing such things as playing with other children or reaching for <b>a</b> <b>balloon.</b> The photographs were by Miho Kakuta, with drawings by Kiyohiko Azuma. The daily calendars have a mix of original and manga artwork, with occasional captions, {{as well as other}} fun items – for example, the 2006 calendar had a game of shiritori ongoing through the year. The daily calendars run from April to March, following the Japanese school year instead of the calendar year.|$|E
5|$|For his 1896 {{attempt to}} launch the balloon, Andrée had many eager volunteers to choose from. He picked Nils Gustaf Ekholm (1848–1923), an {{experienced}} Arctic meteorological researcher and formerly his boss during an 1882–83 geophysical expedition to Spitsbergen, and Nils Strindberg (1872–97), a brilliant student who was doing original research in physics and chemistry. The main scientific purpose of the expedition was to map the area by means of aerial photography, and Strindberg was both a devoted amateur photographer and a skilled constructor of advanced cameras. This was a team with many useful scientific and technical skills, but lacking any particular physical prowess or training for survival under extreme conditions. All three men were indoor types, and only one, Strindberg, was young. Andrée expected a sedentary voyage in <b>a</b> <b>balloon</b> basket, and strength and survival skills were far down on his list.|$|E
