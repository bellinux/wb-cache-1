5|$|Egyptian cuisine {{remained}} remarkably stable over time; indeed, {{the cuisine}} of modern Egypt retains some striking similarities to the cuisine of the ancients.

They became even more widely popular during the mid-2000s due to the rise of Southern hip hop rap and the more mainstream pop culture status hip hop attained.|$|E

25|$|Harveytown Park {{is one of}} {{the newest}} parks in the Harveytown district.

During Phase I, the initial park site was cleared and prepared, underground utilities were installed, a main entrance and parking lot was constructed, and the picnic shelter was installed. The shelter was unique in that it was both aesthetically pleasing and functional. Possible expansion plans include a skateboard facility, bicycle trails and tennis courts.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{barbecue}} restaurants {{may offer}} dishes that are slow-smoked or barbecued over <b>a</b> <b>grill.</b> Fare includes barbecue sandwiches, brisket, barbecue chicken, pulled pork, pork shoulder, pork ribs, beef ribs, beefsteak and other foods. Various side dishes are typically available, such as baked beans, macaroni and cheese, coleslaw and {{corn on the}} cob, among others. A variety of barbecue sauces may be available, and some barbecue restaurants bottle their own sauces for customer purchase. Some barbecue restaurants prepare their foods without any sauces, and may not offer any as condiments. This may occur per a preference for {{the flavor of the}} meats to stand on their own, rather than being accentuated with flavors from sauces. Some barbecue restaurants use a dry spice rub to flavor meats.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} to braise meats and vegetables in a pot on top of <b>a</b> <b>grill.</b> A gas or electric charbroil grill are the best choices for barbecue-braising, combining dry heat charbroil-grilling directly on a ribbed surface and braising in a broth-filled pot for moist heat. The pot is placed {{on top of the}} grill, covered, and allowed to simmer for a few hours. There are two advantages to barbecue-braising; it allows browning of the meat directly on the grill before the braising. It also allows for glazing of meat with sauce and finishing it directly over the fire after the braising. This effectively cooks the meat three times, which results in a soft, textured product that falls off the bone. The time needed for braising varies depending on whether a slow cooker or pressure cooker is used; it is generally slower than regular grilling or baking, but quicker than pit-smoking.|$|E

500|$|According to the American Dental Association in June 2006, {{no studies}} have shown whether the {{long-term}} wearing of grills is safe. [...] If the grills fit properly and are worn only intermittently, wearers are at a low risk for dental problems, according to the ADA. [...] The ADA has warned, however, that grills made from base metals could cause irritation or allergic reactions, and that bacteria trapped under <b>a</b> <b>grill</b> worn on a long-term basis could result in gum disease, cavities, or even bone loss. [...] School districts in Alabama, Georgia, and Texas have banned grills for reasons both disciplinary and health-related.|$|E
500|$|Enclosure {{refers to}} a system that allows for the control of volume without {{requiring}} the addition or subtraction of stops. In a two-manual organ with Great and Swell divisions, the Swell will be enclosed. In larger organs, parts or all of the Choir and Solo divisions may also be enclosed. The pipes of an enclosed division are placed in a chamber generally called the swell box. At least one side of the box is constructed from horizontal or vertical palettes known as swell shades, which operate in a similar way to Venetian blinds; their position can be adjusted from the console. When the swell shades are open, more sound is heard than when they are closed. [...] Sometimes the shades are exposed, but they are often concealed behind a row of facade-pipes or <b>a</b> <b>grill.</b>|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} positive reviews, with critics complimenting its simple production, the songwriting and Gaga's vocals. An electronic rock lament, in {{the vein}} of Irish folk ballad rue, [...] "Dope" [...] is a bittersweet song {{centered on a}} dark theme. It has a minimal production and is only composed off Gaga's vocals sung in an intoxicated slur. Lyrically it talks about substance abuse and the yearning for a long lost love. Previous to the release Gaga uploaded an image of herself on Instagram, wearing a snapback featuring the word DOPE. She also posted the song's lyrics there, triggering the social media website's concern. The artwork featured Gaga with a big blazer, her face covered with a hat and <b>a</b> <b>grill</b> that made her teeth appear larger. Media outlets found the picture to be [...] "odd" [...] and compared it to different horror films.|$|E
