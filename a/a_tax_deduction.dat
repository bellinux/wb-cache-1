Idaho (up to $5,000 of unreimbursed expenses) and Louisiana (up to $7,500 of 72% of unreimbursed expenses) also provide donor tax credits.

25|$|Homeownership {{has been}} {{promoted}} as government policy using several means involving mortgage debt and the government sponsored entities Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and the Federal Home Loan Banks, which fund or guarantee $6.5 trillion of assets {{with the purpose of}} directly or indirectly promoting homeownership.

500|$|Returns {{to investors}} {{comprised}} <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> <b>deduction</b> {{in the year}} in which they bought the products, and returns from the sale of produce {{over the life of the}} project, which was typically at the point of harvest 10–12 years later for plantations, [...] "and up to 23 years for horticultural projects such as almonds". Great Southern would deduct management fees from the final sale value. A typical forestry investment in the early 2000s involved an initial payment of $3000 for one-third of a hectare woodlot, yielding a $2900 tax deduction at that time. Returns on harvesting depended on many variables; Great Southern forecast that investors would recoup their original investment and a further return of between $1923 and $4569 per woodlot, however early schemes did not achieve these figures on the basis of the timber sales, with some resulting in woodchip sales of only around A$1500, half the value of what was originally invested. Investors received their returns when the product (usually woodchip) was harvested and sold.|$|E
500|$|The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") took {{public action}} in 2005. [...] In mid year, it {{released}} two private letter rulings, {{each of which}} described an organization that was conducting operations {{in a manner similar}} to the Nehemiah Program. [...] Each ruling found that (i) the organization's operations did not exclusively serve a charitable purpose but, instead, served to promote [...] "the private interests of home sellers and other private parties" [...] and, consequently, (ii) the payments made by home sellers to the organization would not qualify as [...] "charitable contributions" [...] for which the seller could claim <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> <b>deduction.</b> [...] And in November 2005, the Department of Justice filed suit in Chicago on behalf of the IRS, seeking an injunction against an Illinois-based seller-funded down-payment program. [...] The injunction sought to bar that program from [...] "falsely advising" [...] home sellers that they could claim their payments to the program as charitable-contribution tax deductions. [...] The IRS made its findings applicable to all seller-funded down-payment assistance programs when it issued a revenue ruling in May 2006. [...] That ruling, Revenue Ruling 2006–27, contrasted the tax treatment of seller-funded programs with the treatment accorded to other types of down-payment assistance. [...] Seller-funded programs, the ruling stated, were [...] "not operated exclusively for charitable purposes". [...] Furthermore, payments made by the seller to the organizations were to be treated not as charitable contributions, but either as rebates to the home buyer or as reductions in the sales price of the home. [...] Shortly after the revenue ruling was issued, Nehemiah published an open letter from its president, in which it noted its opposition to the ruling but added that the ruling did not prevent the Nehemiah Program from continuing its operations. The letter did note, however, that Nehemiah might have to pay [...] "appropriate business taxes on the revenue generated by its downpayment assistance program".|$|E
