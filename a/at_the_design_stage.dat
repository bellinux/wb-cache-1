5|$|With {{the need}} for a remote site obviated, it was decided to build the {{facility}} on the coast of Cumberland at a former Royal Ordnance Factory, ROF Drigg. This was soon switched to a more suitable site at the nearby former ROF Sellafield. To avoid any confusion with Springfields, the name was changed to Windscale. Construction began in September 1947. The danger of Wigner's disease was not overlooked. Walter Zinn visited Britain in 1948 and provided crucial information. New calculations based on this meant that the layout of the graphite blocks, which were already being machined, had to be changed. The two Windscale reactors became operational in October 1950 and June 1951. Due to faulty calculations <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>stage,</b> the reactors did not produce the expected output. As a result, extraordinary measures had to be taken to provide Penney with a first shipment of plutonium in June 1952, and sufficient quantity for a core by the 1 August 1952 deadline. Improvements in the bomb design ultimately meant that he could get by with 15 per cent less plutonium. Starting in 1953, the Windscale reactors were able to use slightly enriched uranium as a fuel. They were shut down after the Windscale fire in October 1957.|$|E

40|$|Behaviour {{models are}} the most {{commonly}} used input for predicting the reliability of a software system <b>at</b> <b>the</b> early <b>design</b> <b>stage.</b> A component behaviour model reveals the structure and behaviour of the component during the execution of system-level functionalities. There are various challenges related to component reliability prediction <b>at</b> <b>the</b> early <b>design</b> <b>stage</b> based on behaviour models. For example, most of the current reliability techniques do not provide fine-grained sequential behaviour models of individual components and fail to consider the loop entry and exit points in the reliability computation. Moreover, some of the current techniques do not tackle the problem of operational data unavailability and the lack of analysis results that can be valuable for software architects <b>at</b> <b>the</b> early <b>design</b> <b>stage.</b> This paper proposes a reliability prediction technique that, pragmatically, synthesizes system behaviour {{in the form of a}} state machine, given a set of scenarios and corresponding constraints as input. The state machine is utilized as a base for generating the component-relevant operational data. The state machine is also used as a source for identifying the nodes and edges of a component probabilistic dependency graph (CPDG). Based on the CPDG, a stack-based algorithm is used to compute the reliability. The proposed technique is evaluated by a comparison with existing techniques and the application of sensitivity analysis to a robotic wheelchair system as a case study. The results indicate that the proposed technique is more relevant <b>at</b> <b>the</b> early <b>design</b> <b>stage</b> compared to existing works, and can provide a more realistic and meaningful prediction...|$|R
500|$|The Gresley 3-cylinder drive {{arrangement}} continued {{to bring a}} number of practical problems, the root of which was probably {{the need for the}} inside cylinder to be steeply inclined in order to give space for the inside connecting rod to clear the leading coupled axle; at the same time, the inside valve spindle had to be parallel with the outside ones from which it derived its motion. This problem had been overcome by what Holcroft called a [...] "twist in the ports" [...] (the passages that carried steam {{in and out of the}} cylinders). A consequence was that the length of these passages was greater than that generally recommended, increasing [...] "dead space", and this was combined with a shorter exhaust passage. The net result would be rather different working conditions in the middle cylinder from those on the outside. A contributing problem was that any elongation of the outside valve spindles was multiplied by the conjugated valve gear. Although this had been anticipated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>stage,</b> the overall consequence was that the inside cylinder had a tendency to give more power than the other two as speed increased, leading to the overloading of the inside connecting rod bearings, especially the big-end which was liable to overheat and fail. Various experiments were tried over the years to cure this chronic ailment, and it was only towards the end of the steam era that a real solution was found in Great Western methods of lubrication and manufacture for the big-end bearing. Other problems persisted, such as a stiff, insensitive regulator and overall design flaws that hampered maintenance.|$|E

2500|$|To {{deal with}} {{increasing}} reliability problems, the Class 50 fleet was refurbished at Doncaster Works between 1979 and 1984. Doncaster had taken {{responsibility for the}} fleet after BR completed {{the purchase of the}} locomotives from English Electric. The work involved simplifying the complex electronics and removing redundant features such as slow speed control and rheostatic braking. In addition, the air intake fan arrangement was modified, because the original setup often prevented fresh air from entering the engine room and stale, oil mist-filled air from escaping, leading to many main generator failures. This was in part due to the moisture in the air in the UK: dust and other particles would lodge in the filter system and become 'gummed up' with moisture, preventing circulation which in turn also hampered the intended engine compartment pressure levels which then meant 'filtered' air could not be evacuated by the intended means. The filtration system was fundamentally sound and widely used in other countries; the problems arose because relative humidity had not been taken into account <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>stage.</b> This modification eliminated the characteristic droning [...] "sucking" [...] noise which had earned the [...] "Hoover" [...] nickname.|$|E
