Shortly after receiving his commission <b>acceptance</b> <b>letter,</b> his local bishop asked him to serve as a counselor in the bishopric. Time conflicts with bishopric meetings would have made Navy service impossible. After discussion with church apostle Harold B. Lee (his former stake president), Monson declined the commission and applied for a discharge. The Navy granted his discharge in the last group processed before the Korean War. Lee set him apart six months later as a bishop—mentioning in the blessing that he likely would not have been called if he had accepted the commission.|$|E

He was assigned to the Great Lakes Naval Training Station in Illinois and played on the football team coached by Paul Brown. Using an <b>acceptance</b> <b>letter</b> from the University of Wisconsin–Madison to be discharged from the service, Grant decided to attend the University of Minnesota instead.

In the third season, Quinn intends to get full custody of her daughter, Beth, and her attempts to prove Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel)—the adoptive mother of Beth—an unfit mother fail; eventually, she realizes that Shelby is Beth's true mother. Quinn subsequently receives a college <b>acceptance</b> <b>letter</b> from Yale, and while driving to Finn and Rachel's wedding, her car is struck by a truck and she suffers a spinal injury that requires her to use a wheelchair for many weeks.

5|$|Regular Democrats {{were forced}} to call for {{annexation}} of Texas in their platform, {{but there was a}} bitter battle for the presidential nomination. Ballot after ballot, Van Buren failed to win the necessary super-majority of Democratic votes, and slowly fell in the rankings. It was not until the ninth ballot that the Democrats turned their sights to James K. Polk, a less prominent candidate who supported annexation. They found him to be perfectly suited for their platform, and he was nominated with two-thirds of the vote. Tyler considered his work vindicated, and implied in an <b>acceptance</b> <b>letter</b> that annexation was his true priority rather than election.|$|E
5|$|An {{invitation}} {{was sent}} to the Launceston Cricket Club in February with a view to playing that March. The invitation was accepted but the match was delayed when the <b>acceptance</b> <b>letter</b> was not posted in time to reach the steamer transporting mail. The MCC repeated their invitation later in 1850. While the match was being arranged, legislation passed in the United Kingdom to separate the Port Phillip District, which was to be renamed as Victoria, from the colony of New South Wales. When news of this much anticipated decision reached the colony late in 1850, two weeks of celebrations were arranged in Melbourne to mark independence. The delayed cricket match, now scheduled for February 1851, became part of the general festivities, although formal independence did not come about until later in 1851. Furthermore, the fixture was to be the first Australian intercolonial match and was later considered the first first-class cricket match in Australia.|$|E

He further claimed he had consulted, regarding {{the value of his}} collection, with Leonard Bernstein and Henry Mancini, both of whom denied this.

As Garfield had, the Democratic nominee sought to cause no controversy in his statement, which according to biographer David M. Jordan was [...] "bland and general".

Unlike Garfield, Hancock had no record in elected office, but the <b>acceptance</b> <b>letter</b> gave no further indication of his political preferences.

500|$|Chambers gave speeches on his {{way back}} to Texas, castigating the banks and {{defending}} the admission of socialists to the convention as [...] "simply a body of men enlisted in the cause of human rights." [...] In his official <b>acceptance</b> <b>letter,</b> he called for expansion of the currency, immigration restriction to help workingmen compete [...] "with Chinese serf labor," [...] and the forfeiture of all unfulfilled railroad grants. On July 8, before reaching home, Chambers fell as he exited his train in Kosse, Texas, and broke two ribs. He was confined to bed for several weeks and considered withdrawing from the race, but decided against it. His efforts, however, were limited by his injuries, and his only contribution to the campaign was to publish his newspaper, renamed the Cleburne Greenbacker. Greenbackers had high hopes for the 1880 election, but were disappointed with the result: Weaver and Chambers won just over 300,000 votes (3.3% of the popular vote) and did not carry a single state in the electoral college.|$|E

Armstrong, despite being a newcomer to the city, was open to the fact of running in the election, but ultimately did not run. Armstrong would however decide to run for council as an alderman in the 1907 election, on a platform based on assuring the availabilities of utilities {{to the people of}} Edmonton, as well as ensuring a sense of openness as a council to the people. During the time leading up to the election, he also voiced his opposition to the city's arbitrary divisions into sections. He was elected to council for a two-year term, receiving 774 votes, finishing second in a field of 12 candidates. Despite being a preferred candidate for the mayoralty in 1909, he opted to run for council instead and was re-elected for another two-year term in the 1909 election.

He wrote Anatomy of a Murder in three months and received an <b>acceptance</b> <b>letter</b> from a publisher in December 1956 just days before he {{was appointed to the}} Michigan Supreme Court. The book was the first to portray both the preparation and trial phases of a legal case, creating a new genre of fiction. The novel was chosen as the January 1958 Book-of-the-Month Club main selection, and it was listed on The New York Times Bestseller list for 62weeks. In The New York Times, reviewer Orville Prescott called it [...] "immensely readable and continuously entertaining" [...] and noted Voelker's [...] "unflagging invention and narrative pace".|$|E

2500|$|Greater {{chance of}} acceptance. There is strong {{consensus}} that applying early decision brings a greater statistical {{chance of being}} accepted, possibly doubling or tripling {{the chances of a}}n <b>acceptance</b> <b>letter.</b> In 2009, the average early acceptance rate according to one estimate was 15 percentage points greater than regular decision applicants. There is less agreement, however, whether it will help a borderline student win acceptance to a competitive college. There are numerous reports that early decision candidates tend to have stronger educational credentials than regular decision candidates, and as a result, these candidates would have been admitted whether they applied by early or regular methods, and therefore the greater statistical likelihood of acceptance may have been explained by membership in the stronger applicant pool. But a more widely held view is that early decision method boosts the chances of a borderline student; as Robert J. Massa of Lafayette College explained, [...] "colleges really want qualified students who want them" [...] {{and are more likely to}} offer acceptances to students ready to make a full commitment. There was a report that the [...] "acceptance rate gap" [...] between early and regular decision—currently an average of 57% accepted if applied early decision versus 50% if applied regular decision—has been narrowing in recent years. Early decision has been criticized for unfairly advantaging students from affluent families.|$|E

The course aims to give the prisoners proper tools to become students after leaving prison so {{that they have a}} lower chance of returning.
