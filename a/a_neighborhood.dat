40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the notion of}} N-topo nilpotent fuzzy set in <b>a</b> fuzzy <b>neighborhood</b> ring and develop some fundamental results. Here we show that <b>a</b> fuzzy <b>neighborhood</b> ring is locally inversely bounded {{if and only if}} for all 0 < α < 1, the α-level topological rings are locally inversely bounded. This leads us to prove a characterization theorem which says that if <b>a</b> fuzzy <b>neighborhood</b> ring on <b>a</b> division ring is Wuyts-Lowen WNT 2 and locally inversely bounded, then the fuzzy <b>neighborhood</b> ring is <b>a</b> fuzzy <b>neighborhood</b> division ring.

5|$|Exponentiation {{occurs in}} many areas of {{mathematics}} and its inverse function {{is often referred to as}} the logarithm. For example, the logarithm of a matrix is the (multi-valued) inverse function of the matrix exponential. Another example is the p-adic logarithm, the inverse function of the p-adic exponential. Both are defined via Taylor series analogous to the real case. In the context of differential geometry, the exponential map maps the tangent space at a point of a manifold to <b>a</b> <b>neighborhood</b> of that point. Its inverse is also called the logarithmic (or log) map.|$|E
