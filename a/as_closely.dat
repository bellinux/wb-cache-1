5|$|A {{conflict}} between the sexes of a species is seen in some species of ants with these reproducers apparently competing to produce offspring that are <b>as</b> <b>closely</b> related to them as possible. The most extreme form involves the production of clonal offspring. An extreme of sexual conflict is seen in Wasmannia auropunctata, where the queens produce diploid daughters by thelytokous parthenogenesis and males produce clones by a process whereby a diploid egg loses its maternal contribution to produce haploid males who are clones of the father.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Euchambersia was {{assigned}} to the newly named family Euchambersiidae by Lieuwe Dirk Boonstra. Boonstra initially misspelt the name as Euchambersidae (which is improper Latin), and was subsequently corrected by Friedrich von Huene in 1940. Euchambersiidae was initially considered to be separate from the families Moschorhinidae and Annatherapsididae; in 1974, Christiane Mendez recognized these groups <b>as</b> <b>closely</b> related subfamilies (renamed Annatherapsidinae, Moschorhininae and Euchambersiinae) within the wider group of her redefined Moschorhinidae (although she also referred to it as Annatherapsididae).|$|E
5|$|In textual references, Shashthi {{is often}} {{depicted}} <b>as</b> <b>closely</b> connected to Skanda. An early textual reference dating to 8th–9th century BCE relates Shashthi {{to the six}} Krittikas who nurtured and nursed Skanda. Sometimes regarded as {{an aspect of the}} goddess Durga (identified with Parvati – the mother of Skanda), she is also called Skandamata ("Skanda's mother"). The 3rd to 5th century text Yajnavalkya Smriti describes Shashthi as the foster-mother and protector of Skanda.|$|E

5|$|Oryzomys dimidiatus, {{also known}} as the Nicaraguan oryzomys, Thomas's rice rat, or Nicaraguan rice rat, is a rodent in the genus Oryzomys of the family Cricetidae. It is known from only three specimens, all {{collected}} in southeastern Nicaragua since 1904. Placed in Nectomys upon its discovery, it was later classified in its own subgenus of Oryzomys and finally recognized <b>as</b> <b>closely</b> related to other species now placed in Oryzomys, including the marsh rice rat and Oryzomys couesi, which occurs in the same region.|$|E
5|$|Shashthi's Bengali legends {{appear in}} the Mangal-Kavya texts, {{especially}} in the Shashthi-mangal section of this work. The Mangal-Kavya and Bengali folk tales describe Shashthi <b>as</b> <b>closely</b> related to Manasa, the serpent goddess. Shashthi furthermore appears as an ally of Manasa in a famous Bengali folk-tale describing Shashthi's activities during the Nag Panchami festival of Manasa.|$|E

5|$|What may be {{the most}} {{originally}} restored Spitfire in the world is maintained at Fantasy of Flight in Polk City, Florida. Over a six-year period in the 1990s, this aircraft was slowly restored by Personal Plane Services in England using almost 90% of its original aircraft skins. Owner Kermit Weeks insisted that the aircraft be restored <b>as</b> <b>closely</b> as possible to its original condition. Machine guns, cannon, gun sight and original working radios are all installed.|$|E
5|$|Alan Pegler, {{who first}} saw the {{locomotive}} at the British Empire Exhibition in 1924, in 1961 received £70,000 for his share holding when Northern Rubber was sold to Pegler's Valves, a company started by his grandfather. When Flying Scotsman was due to be scrapped, Pegler stepped in and bought it outright, with the political support of Prime Minister Harold Wilson. He spent {{large amounts of money}} {{over the next few years}} having the locomotive restored at Doncaster Works <b>as</b> <b>closely</b> as possible to its LNER condition: the smoke deflectors were removed; the double chimney was replaced by a single chimney; and the tender was replaced by one of the corridor type with which the locomotive had run between 1928 and 1936.

5|$|Behind this combat, {{other ships}} of the centre {{division}} struck the French line, HMS Valiant under Thomas Pringle passing close to Patriote which pulled away, her crew suffering from contagion {{and unable to}} take their ship into battle. Valiant instead turned her attention on Achille, which had already been raked by Queen Charlotte and Brunswick, and badly damaged her before pressing on sail to join the embattled van division. HMS Orion under John Thomas Duckworth and HMS Queen under Admiral Alan Gardner both attacked the same ship, Queen suffering severely from the earlier actions in which her masts were badly damaged and her captain John Hutt mortally wounded. Both ships bore down on the French Northumberland, which was soon dismasted and left attempting to escape on only the stump of a mast. Queen was too slow to engage Northumberland <b>as</b> <b>closely</b> as Orion, and soon fell in with Jemmappes, both ships battering each other severely.|$|E
5|$|Due to its perception-altering effects, {{the onset}} of {{narcosis}} {{may be hard to}} recognize. At its most benign, narcosis results in relief of anxiety– a feeling of tranquility and mastery of the environment. These effects are essentially identical to various concentrations of nitrous oxide. They also resemble (though not <b>as</b> <b>closely)</b> the effects of alcohol or cannabis and the familiar benzodiazepine drugs such as diazepam and alprazolam. Such effects are not harmful unless they cause some immediate danger to go unrecognized and unaddressed. Once stabilized, the effects generally remain the same at a given depth, only worsening if the diver ventures deeper.|$|E
5|$|Grisedale Tarn is the {{starting}} point for the south ridge of Helvellyn, and may be reached from Grasmere or Patterdale, or from Dunmail Raise by a path alongside Raise Beck. Above the tarn the old pony track zigzags up the fellside, and takes a safe but unexciting route well away from crags {{on the side of the}} ridge, and avoiding all the intermediate tops. In suitable weather a more interesting and scenic route is to follow the edge of the crags <b>as</b> <b>closely</b> as possible, over the tops of Dollywagon Pike, High Crag and Nethermost Pike.|$|E

This edition attempted to follow <b>as</b> <b>closely</b> as possible the runtime and format of the original roadshow version, and included additional restored live-action footage of Taylor and the orchestra, including the bookends to the film's intermission. In the 2000 and 2010 releases, Deems Taylor's voice has been dubbed throughout by Corey Burton because most of the audio tracks to Taylor's restored scenes have been lost.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Hiroshima, {{almost all of}} the buildings were of old-fashioned Japanese construction, consisting of timber or timber-framed buildings with timber walls (with or without plaster) and tile roofs. Many of the smaller industries and business establishments were also situated in buildings of timber or other materials not designed to withstand explosions. Nagasaki had been permitted to grow for many years without conforming to any definite city zoning plan; residences were erected adjacent to factory buildings and to each other almost <b>as</b> <b>closely</b> as possible throughout the entire industrial valley. On the day of the bombing, an estimated 263,000 people were in Nagasaki, including 240,000 Japanese residents, 10,000 Korean residents, 2,500 conscripted Korean workers, 9,000 Japanese soldiers, 600 conscripted Chinese workers, and 400 Allied prisoners of war in a camp to the north of Nagasaki.|$|E
5|$|Later that month, Breckinridge {{served as}} an {{independent}} commander in the lower Mississippi Valley, securing Confederate control of the area by taking Port Hudson, which helped halt the federal advance down the Mississippi River. Meanwhile, General Braxton Bragg, commanding the Army of Mississippi, was preparing an invasion of Kentucky, and Breckinridge was ordered to join him. Confederate leaders believed that Breckinridge's presence in the state could spur enlistments. Van Dorn was reluctant to lose command of Breckinridge and his men, {{and by the time}} he relented on October 15, Bragg was already retreating from the state after being defeated at the Battle of Perryville. Breckinridge and his division of 7,000 men met Bragg at Murfreesboro, Tennessee. With Kentucky solidly under Union control, Breckinridge's wife and children moved south and followed his troops <b>as</b> <b>closely</b> as was safely possible.|$|E

5|$|Most coincidentally, a small {{theropod}} dinosaur named Oviraptor philoceratops {{had been}} discovered while Heilmann was working on his book, and was described by Henry Fairfield Osborn in 1924. Figure 8 of Osborn's paper, redrawn from the fossil, shows what was later proven to be an oviraptorid wishbone between the animal's arms. Unfortunately, this important structure was misidentified at the time. If Heilmann had examined this paper <b>as</b> <b>closely</b> as he had much of his source material – or had traveled to New York to see the specimens in person – he may have reversed his conclusions entirely.|$|E
5|$|Most of the UB I {{boats were}} shipped to their port of {{operations}} by rail, where they were assembled, launched, tested, and commissioned. Information on UB-14 suggests that she may not have followed that pattern <b>as</b> <b>closely</b> as most other boats. According to several sources, UB-14 was launched on 23 March 1915, and commissioned into the German Imperial Navy as SM UB-14 on 25 March {{under the command of}} Oberleutnant zur See Heino von Heimburg a 25-year-old first-time U-boat commander. Those same sources are silent on UB-14s whereabouts at the time, but information on UB-14 later shipment and arrival in the Mediterranean suggest that her initial launch and commissioning may have occurred in Germany.|$|E
5|$|Psilocybe allenii was {{described}} as new to science in 2012 by Jan Borovička, Alan Rockefeller, and Peter G. Werner. Borovička received material collected from Seattle, Washington, which he noted was microscopically similar to Psilocybe cyanescens, but lacked the wavy cap margins characteristic of that species. In previous publications, Borovička had noted that both macro- and microscopic characters of certain Psilocybe species were highly variable, which could also account for the differences observed in the Seattle material. However, DNA sequencing revealed a 5-base pair change in the internal transcribed spacer regions (a segment of RNA often used in molecular phylogenetics to identify or distinguish fungal species) between P.cyanescens and the Seattle collections. This difference, {{in addition to the}} readily observable macroscopic differences, was deemed sufficient to warrant describing the taxon as a new species. Additional molecular studies published by Borovička and colleagues in 2015 identified P.azurescens, P.cyanescens, P.weraroa, P.cubensis, and P.serbica <b>as</b> <b>closely</b> related to P.allenii.|$|E
