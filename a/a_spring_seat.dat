40|$|A shaker with a Terfenol-D rod {{actuator}} {{includes a}} mass coupled to {{both ends of}} the rod through <b>a</b> <b>spring</b> <b>seat,</b> a spring seat/adjuster and a spring washer. The actuator is mounted inside a cylindrical coil, which in turn is mounted inside a cylindrical permanent magnet, which in turn is mounted inside a cylindrical housing. An electrical drive system provides a predetermined excitation signal to the coil to cause the rod to vibrate {{under the influence of the}} magnetic field generated by the coil. One embodiment features a vibrating mass on one end of the rod. An implantable shaker includes a seal to leak-proof the shaker and a coating of Biomer™. The implantable shaker can be implanted in an animal to test tissue response to certain vibrations. According to another embodiment, the Terfenol-D rod actuator is held in place on one end with a pre-stress adjusting screw, which is threaded into the end of the housing and fixed in place with a jam nut. In all embodiments, a spring base is seated on one end of the rod actuator and forms an annular coaxial air gap between it and <b>a</b> <b>spring</b> <b>seat,</b> so that the air gap remains constant when the rod actuator vibrates and the spring base moves coaxially with respect to the spring seat...|$|E

50|$|Mr M Bertoux, a French army officer, {{secured a}} prize {{offered by a}} French {{newspaper}} in 1893 for the best method of carrying a passenger on a bicycle. The sidecar wheel was mounted on the same lateral plane as the bicycle's rear and {{was supported by a}} triangulation of tubes from the bicycle. <b>A</b> <b>sprung</b> <b>seat</b> with back rest was mounted above the cross-member and a footboard hung below.A sidecar appeared in a cartoon by George Moore in the January 7, 1903, issue of the British newspaper Motor Cycling. Three weeks later, a provisional patent was granted to Mr. W. J. Graham of Graham Brothers, Enfield, Middlesex. He partnered with Jonathan A. Kahn to begin production.|$|R
50|$|From his mid-teens Page had ambitions {{to design}} aircraft, {{but it was}} not a dream of the marvels of flight that {{motivated}} him, instead it was the recognition that aircraft design was the most rapidly advancing ofall the branches of engineering and therefore a field in which new things could he created. After graduating in 1938 he joined Hawker Aircraft at Kingston upon Thames working under Sydney Camm. As his career at Hawkers developed he was increasingly asked to help solve difficult problems. The Typhoon was subject to severe propeller-induced vibration and to counter this Page developed anti-vibration mountings for the engine and <b>a</b> <b>sprung</b> <b>seat</b> for the pilot. But it was in the aerodynamics and control of the Tempest that he made major contributions.|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} electrode {{mounting structure}} for a {{gas tungsten arc welding}} torch having a coaxial imaging system. The electrode mounting structure includes a support having a central hub and {{a plurality of}} spokes which extend from the hub generally radially with respect to the axis of the torch into supporting engagement with the interior walls of the torch. The spaces between the spokes are optical passages for transmission of light to form the image. A tubular collet holder is threadedly engaged at its upper end to the hub and extends downwardly toward the open end of the torch. The collet holder has an inwardly tapering constriction near its lower end. An electrode-retaining, tubular collet is mounted within the collet holder and has a longitudinally split and tapered end seating against the tapered constriction. <b>A</b> <b>spring</b> <b>seats</b> against {{the upper end of the}} collet and forces the split end against the tapered constriction to wedge the split end radially inwardly to grip the electrode within the collet...|$|R
50|$|The cab, {{a type of}} fly, sat two {{passengers}} (three if squeezed in) and {{a driver}} who sat on <b>a</b> <b>sprung</b> <b>seat</b> behind the vehicle. The passengers could give their instructions to the driver through a trap door near {{the rear of the}} roof. They could pay the driver through this hatch and he would then operate a lever to release the doors so they could alight. In some cabs, the driver could operate a device that balanced the cab and reduced strain on the horse. The passengers were protected from the elements by the cab, and by folding wooden doors that enclosed their feet and legs, protecting their clothes from splashing mud. Later versions also had an up-and-over glass window above the doors to complete the enclosure of the passengers. Additionally, a curved fender mounted forward of the doors protected passengers from the stones thrown up by the flying hooves of the horse.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{suspension}} in an ICF Bogie {{is through a}} dashpot arrangement. The dashpot arrangement consists of <b>a</b> cylinder (lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat)</b> and the piston (axle box guide). Axle box springs are placed on the lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> placed on the axle box wing of the axle box housing assembly. A rubber or a Hytrel washer is placed below the lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> for cushioning effect. The axle box guide is welded to the bogie frame. The axle box guide acts as a piston. A homopolymer acetyle washer {{is placed on the}} lower end of the axle box guide. The end portion of the axle box guide is covered with a guide cap, which has holes in it. A sealing ring is placed near the washer and performs the function of a piston ring. The axle box guide moves in the lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> filled with dashpot oil. This arrangement provides the dampening effect during the running of the coach.|$|R
5000|$|Wakefield {{stood against}} Chief Minister Adam Giles in the 2016 election, {{in the south}} Alice <b>Springs</b> <b>seat</b> of Braitling. [...] Going into the election, Braitling was the fourth-safest seat in the Territory; Wakefield needed a 19.6 percent swing to win it. Like Alice <b>Springs</b> as <b>a</b> whole, Braitling had long been {{considered}} CLP heartland; it had only {{been out of the}} party's hands for two terms since its creation in 1984, when CLP-turned-independent Loraine Braham held it 2001 to 2008. Labor had never won <b>an</b> inner Alice <b>Springs</b> <b>seat</b> before (though it held at least one remote-based seat that spilled into Alice Springs from 1983 to 2012), and had never come particularly close to winning Braitling.|$|R

50|$|Although {{opinion polls}} and {{commentators}} had already universally written off the CLP government {{both before and}} during the 2016 election campaign, there was no suggestion that Giles was in any danger in his own seat. He sat on a seemingly insurmountable margin of 19.6 percent, and Labor had never come close to winning the seat. However, in a result not foreseen by any commentators, let alone either party, Labor challenger Dale Wakefield narrowly led Giles on election night. Ultimately, Wakefield defeated Giles by a knife-edge margin of 27 votes. Not only is Wakefield just the second challenger to unseat a sitting Chief Minister/Majority Leader in their own seat and the third challenger to oust a major-party leader in the Territory, she is also the first Labor member to represent <b>an</b> Alice <b>Springs</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|R
50|$|The D3 Major {{represented}} {{the first step}} in development of the Bantam, although the D1 would be produced for many years to come. First produced in late (most likely October was the first released) 1953 with a 150cc engine, the D3 continued in production until 1957. A modern-style foam-filled pillion seat was fitted as standard, an economy and comfort breakthrough that had become popular as an option on the D1. It replaced the original standard fitting of a parcel carrier behind <b>an</b> individual <b>sprung</b> rubber <b>seat.</b>|$|R

25|$|Bicycle {{historian}} David V. Herlihy {{documents that}} Lallement {{claimed to have}} created the pedal bicycle in Paris in 1863. He had seen someone riding a draisine in 1862 then originally {{came up with the}} idea to add pedals to it. It is a fact that he filed the earliest and only patent for a pedal-driven bicycle, in the US in 1866. Lallement's patent drawing shows a machine which looks exactly like Johnson's draisine, but with the pedals and rotary cranks attached to the front wheel hub, and a thin piece of iron over the top of the frame to act as <b>a</b> <b>spring</b> supporting the <b>seat,</b> for a slightly more comfortable ride.|$|R
5000|$|The {{number of}} scooter {{manufacturers}} and designs increased after World War I. The Skootamota, the Kenilworth, and the Reynolds Runabout debuted in 1919, with Gloucestershire Aircraft Company following with its Unibus in 1920. [...] The Skootamota was noted for being practical, popular, and economical, the Kenilworth for its electric lights, and the Reynolds Runabout for its advanced specifications, including front suspension, a two-speed gearbox, leg shields, and <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>sprung</b> with leaf springs and coil springs. [...] The Unibus {{also had a}} two-speed gearbox, {{but it is more}} notable for its full bodywork, similar to that which would appear of second- and third-generation scooters.|$|R

50|$|Traditionally, rubber washers {{have been}} used at the seating {{arrangement}} of the primary springs of the axle box housing in the ICF design passenger coaches on the Indian Railways. The rubber washer is used directly on the axle box seating area. the lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> sits on the washers. The lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> is <b>a</b> tubular structure and 3/4 section is partitioned by using a circular ring which is welded at the 3/4 section. On the top of <b>spring</b> <b>seat,</b> <b>a</b> polymer ring called NFTC ring sits. The primary spring sits on the NFTC ring. The lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> {{plays the role of}} a cylinder in the dashpot arrangement and is filled with oil. In the dashpot arrangement, the top portion is called the axle box guide. The axle box guide is welded to the bogie frame. The axle box guide works as a piston in the Lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> filled with oil. This helps in damping the vibrations caused during running train operation.|$|R
5000|$|Smith {{had over}} forty patents for his inventions with the United States Patent Office. The Smithsonian Institution {{describes}} Smith as having taken the woodworking business from hand tools to mechanized. His business (which he incorporated in 1878 {{under the name}} [...] "H.B. Smith Machine Company") In addition to the woodworking tools which were the staple of his business, he also manufactured the American Star Bicycle. This bicycle differed from others of its time by having a larger back wheel, where the rider sat, and a smaller front wheel for steering. The Star was driven by ratchet drive, had a hand brake and <b>a</b> <b>sprung</b> leather <b>seat.</b> The Star sold for $150 {{at a time when}} the average person earned $500 a year. Not the greatest of commercial successes, it was however fast, and a great stunt bike, winning many track races, endurance rides, and stunt exhibitions, as well as being a great advertising tool for the Smith Machine Co. He also manufactured the first steam-driven vehicle operated in New Jersey, although only one was ever manufactured as he died before it could go into regular production. On his desk at the time of his death was a prototype of an autogiro.|$|R
50|$|However, {{amid the}} massive Labor wave that {{swept through the}} Territory on {{election}} night, Wakefield was ahead of Giles as counting began. Preliminary returns had Giles on 49.9 percent to Wakefield's 50.1 percent—a lead that increased as returns came in during the week after the election. This was mainly because Giles lost 20 percent of his primary vote from 2012. While he was still 10 points ahead of Wakefield on the first count, Wakefield narrowly pulled ahead on preferences. By 2 September, Wakefield led Giles by 23 votes—well within the threshold for a recount under Territory election law. The recount took place on 5 September, and confirmed that Wakefield was still leading on a knife-edge. When the final result was announced, Wakefield won the seat with a margin of 27 votes on a swing of 19.9 percent. This made Wakefield just the second challenger to oust a sitting Majority Leader/Chief Minister in their own seat, and the third to unseat a major-party leader in the Territory. She is also the first Labor member to represent <b>an</b> inner Alice <b>Springs</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|R
50|$|As the {{top portion}} of the lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> is not sealed and only covered {{with the help of}} a {{protective}} tube also called the dashpot cover, the rising oil has a tendency to shoot above the top rim of the lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> and spill out.|$|R
60|$|The {{young fellow}} spat upon his hands and, seizing the ropes, began slowly and {{carefully}} to mount the flimsy, shaking ladder. Those below held it as tight as they were able, but nevertheless he swung backward and forward and round and round as he climbed steadily upward. Once he stopped upon the way, and those below saw him clutch the ladder close to him as though dizzied by the height and the motion but he soon began again, up, up, up like some great black spider. Presently he came out from the black shadow below and into the white moonlight, and then his shadow followed him step by step up the gray wall upon his way. At last he reached the jutting beam, and there again he {{stopped for a moment}} clutching tightly to it. The next he was upon the beam, dragging himself toward the window of the bartizan just above. Slowly raising himself upon his narrow foothold he peeped cautiously within. Those watching him from be low saw him slip his hand softly to his side, and then place something between his teeth. It was his dagger. Reaching up, he clutched the window sill above him and, with <b>a</b> silent <b>spring,</b> <b>seated</b> himself upon it. The next moment he disappeared within. A few seconds of silence followed, then of sudden a sharp gurgling cry broke the stillness. There was another pause of silence, then a faint shrill whistle sounded from above.|$|R

50|$|Within 6 {{months of}} {{provision}} of Hytrel washers {{on all the}} main line coaches, the failure of Axle box housing increased. The reason was the axle box wing cracks. Hence on examination of the failed axle boxes, it was noticed that the Hytrel washers were forming a deep groove of 4 to 8mm on the seating area of the axle box <b>spring</b> <b>seating.</b> They washers were also increasing {{the diameter of the}} <b>spring</b> <b>seating</b> due to continuous hitting of the raised section of the sitting area.|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinder}} piston {{arrangement of the}} dashpot, i.e. the Lower <b>Spring</b> <b>seat</b> and the axle box guide is not fully sealed due to the limitation of the design and practical applicability. Its design provides that when a vertical vibration occurs during {{the movement of the}} railway coach, the axle box guide moves down. The downward movement of the Axle box guide puts pressure on the oil in the lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat.</b> The oil rushes up. However, since there are holes in the guide cap, the oil passes through these holes into the hollow body of the axle box guide. This helps in dampening the vertical vibrations. The axle box guide displaces the oil in the lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> and pushes it upwards. Since, only part quantity of oil is able to move up in the hollow portion of the axle box guide, the balance displaced oil moves up.|$|R
60|$|At last, in a nook {{formed by}} the {{weathered}} joints, Eustace found a rugged niche, somewhat dryer than the rest, and laid Cleer gently down in it, on <b>a</b> natural <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> of tufted rock-plants. Then he settled down beside her, with what cheerfulness he could muster up, and taking off his wet coat, spread it on top across the cleft, like a tent roof, to shelter them. It was no time, indeed, to stand upon ceremony. Cleer recognized as much, and nestled close to his side, like a sensible girl as she was, so as to keep warm by mere company; while Eustace, still holding her hand, just to assure her of his presence, placed himself in such an attitude, leaning before her and above her, as to protect her {{as far as possible}} from the drizzling rainfall through the gap in front of them. There they sat till morning, talking gradually of many things, and growing more and more confidential, in spite of cold and wet, as they learnt more and more, with each passing hour, of each other's standpoint. There are some situations where you get to know people better in a few half-hours together than you could get to know them in months upon months of mere drawing-room acquaintance. And this was one of them. Before morning dawned, Eustace Le Neve and Cleer Trevennack felt just as if they had known one another quite well for years. They were old and trusted friends already. Old friends--and even something more than that. Though no word of love was spoken between them, each knew of what the other was thinking. Eustace felt Cleer loved him; Cleer felt Eustace loved her. And in spite of rain and cold and fog and darkness they were almost happy--before dawn came to interrupt their strange tete-a-tete on the islet.|$|R
30|$|After {{assembly}} of the bogie, {{the upper end of}} the lever-type damper fits closely with one side of the bolster. In application, the lever-type damper rotates by a slight angle around the pivot because of irregularities in the track, and thus only requires a small space for installation. In practice, cracks in the side frame mainly occur on the top of the side frame pedestal and the brake chutes [18]. The lever-type damper is located on the side-frame <b>spring</b> <b>seat,</b> which, whilst it would slightly decrease the static strength of the <b>spring</b> <b>seat,</b> would not significantly weaken the fatigue strength of the side frame.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work, the {{operating}} conditions of “side-load” springs, which are typically employed in McPherson suspensions, were analysed by finite element analysis. The finite element model, including {{the spring and}} {{the upper and lower}} <b>spring</b> <b>seats,</b> is firstly described in the paper; the spring geometry was accurately obtained by a reverse engineering procedure based on two video cameras and a video projector. Surface to surface contact elements were defined between spring and seats; the initial assembling phase of the <b>spring</b> between the <b>seats</b> was also included in the finite element analysis. The experimental rig, employed for spring characterisation, and the performed numerical analyses are then presented; results are discussed in comparison with experimental data, in terms of spring characteristic, side-load force and thrust axis spatial position, as <b>a</b> function of <b>spring</b> compression. <b>A</b> fully satisfactory agreement was generally observed between numerical results and experiments. The effect of lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> orientation on results was also investigated by numerical analysis. A higher inclination of the lower seat appeared to increase the side-load force; at the same time, for a given configuration, the thrust axis orientation, remained almost constant during suspension compression...|$|R

40|$|A {{few years}} ago, the MET {{department}} started constructing an electric vehicle. The {{problem was that}} this electric vehicle was unfinished and required a seat and racing harness. I took this opportunity to help finish the electric vehicle last fall for my senior project. This project was divided up into three phases; planning in the fall, construction {{in the winter and}} testing in the <b>spring.</b> <b>A</b> go-kart <b>seat</b> was incorporated into the existing frame. A five-point racing harness was attached as well. The seating system meets all regulations as outlined in the Electrathon Handbook. The seat and harness will be tested a variety of ways. The most important test will be actually driving the vehicle and getting a feel for how the seating system supports the driver. The finished vehicle will hopefully be entered in an Electrathon race as well. The testing will be finished and included in this project by the time SOURCE takes place May 15...|$|R
