25|$|Joliet Army <b>Ammunition</b> <b>Plant</b> (JOAAP, {{formerly}} known as the Joliet Arsenal) was a United States Army arsenal located in Will County, Illinois, near Elwood, Illinois, south of Joliet, Illinois. Opened in 1940 during World War II, the facility consisted of the Elwood Ordnance Plant (EOP) and the Kankakee Ordnance Works (KNK). In 1945, the two were deactivated and combined forming the Joliet Arsenal. The plant was reactivated for the Korean War and renamed Joliet Army <b>Ammunition</b> <b>Plant</b> during the Vietnam War. Production of TNT ended in 1976, and the major plant operations closed shortly after in the late 1970s. The facility briefly revived an automated load-assemble-pack (LAP) artillery shell operation that was managed by the Honeywell Corporation during the Reagan administration in the 1980s before it was finally closed.|$|E
25|$|The Elwood {{unit was}} reopened in 1966 and would produce {{artillery}} rounds, supplementary charge assemblies and cluster bomb units.

25|$|Exposure to TCE occurs {{mainly through}} {{contaminated}} drinking water. With a specific gravity greater than 1, trichloroethylene can be present as a dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) if sufficient quantities are spilled in the environment. Another {{significant source of}} vapor exposure in Superfund sites that had contaminated groundwater, such as the Twin Cities Army <b>Ammunition</b> <b>Plant,</b> was by showering. TCE readily volatilizes out of hot water and into the air. Long, hot showers would then volatilize more TCE into the air. In a home closed tightly to conserve the cost of heating and cooling, these vapors would then recirculate.|$|E
25|$|After the {{division}} headquarters moved, the depot still carried out railroad functions; the building still {{served as a}} crew change location {{as well as the}} depot for the village of Amboy. The second floor was mostly abandoned after 1894 while the first floor handled the bulk of the day-to-day operations. As cars and buses became more popular Amboy's need for rail service could be served by the station in Dixon; passenger service to Amboy was discontinued in 1939 and the depot underwent an extensive remodeling. Operations were once again moved about the building. The northwest half of the first floor was transformed into a storage area and the second floor renovated into apartments for the station agent and employees of the nearby Green River Ordnance Plant. The station remained the transfer point for all ammunition made at the hastily constructed <b>ammunition</b> <b>plant</b> throughout World War II and the Korean War.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese in 1941, St. Louisans began {{preparing}} for an attack in the area by sending soldiers to protect local military and munitions installations, including the St. Louis Army <b>Ammunition</b> <b>Plant</b> at Goodfellow and Bircher, Lambert Field, and the Curtiss-Wright aircraft factory. St. Louis police were employed to protect bridges, while workers at military factories were checked to protect against sabotage. Other security measures included the interrogation or arrest of German, Italian, and Japanese persons, including naturalized citizens. Several local Japanese restaurants were closed, and at the Bridlespur Hunt Club in Huntleigh, Missouri, the manager (a Japanese man {{who had lived in}} the United States since 1904) was arrested. St. Louis labor leaders organized boycotts of products made by the Axis powers, and bonfires were lit of Japanese-made products. In {{the spring and summer of}} 1942, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) made several high-profile arrests or investigations in St. Louis, including one into a pastor in Chesterfield, Missouri who was accused of sedition for condemning lynchings and openly opposing the playing of the Star Spangled Banner in church.|$|E

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission report recommended that the Army close Kansas and Lone Star Army <b>Ammunition</b> <b>Plants</b> and relocate certain munitions production-related functions from the Kansas and Lone Star Plants to Iowa and Milan (Tennessee) Army <b>Ammunition</b> <b>Plants.</b> As {{a result of the}} recommendations, the Army closed the Kansas and Lone Star Plants in 2009 and {{is in the process of}} relocating munitions production functions to the Iowa and Milan Plants. The 2005 BRAC recommendations must be completed by September 15, 2011. In addition, in February 2008, the U. S. Army Sustainment Command issued a request for proposals for operating and maintaining both the Iowa and Milan Plants. As part of the proposals, all offerors were to submit optimization plans for the optimum operation, maintenance, and utilization of the plants. In October 2008 the Army awarded a contract to American Ordnance for the operation and maintenance of the Iowa and Milan Plants at no direct cost to the government. Under the contract, American Ordnance will perform (among other things) security and maintenance for the facilities and will perform the actions identified in its Baseline Optimization Plan to optimize the facilities. In exchange for these services, American Ordnance is given the use of government equipment and facilities and will be able to use the facilities and equipment to manufacture ammunition, either for sale to the government or for commercial sale to other authorized parties. As part of its Baseline Optimization Plan, which is incorporated in the contract, American Ordnance intends to relocate certain munitions functions existing at the Milan Plant and consolidate them at the Iowa Plant. Due to the proprietary nature of American Ordnance's optimization plans, certain information has been omitted from this correspondence. This correspondence responds to an Explanatory Statement accompanying the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2010. That Statement directed GAO to conduct an audit on the amount and sources of the funds used in furtherance of the 2008 contract with American Ordnance to operate and transform the Iowa and Milan Army <b>Ammunition</b> <b>Plants.</b> In examining Iowa and Milan <b>Ammunition</b> <b>Plants,</b> our objectives were to determine the extent to which (1) the Army has implemented its plan for relocating munitions production-related functions to Iowa and Milan in accordance with the provisions of the 2005 BRAC Commission's recommendations, (2) the federal government is providing funding to implement either the Baseline or the Enhanced Optimization Plans included in the contract awarded to American Ordnance for operating and maintaining the Iowa and Milan Army <b>Ammunition</b> <b>Plants,</b> and (3) the plan to relocate functions between the plants, in accordance with the 2008 contract, has been implemented. ...|$|R
500|$|Floyd was {{a surgeon}} with {{the rank of}} major in the Virginia State Militia from 1807 to 1812. At the {{outbreak}} of the War of 1812, Floyd moved his family to a new home near present-day Virginia Tech to be near friends and entered the regular army. On July 13, 1813, he was appointed surgeon of Lt. Col. James McDowell's Flying Camp in the Virginia militia. When he returned from a leave of absence, he discovered someone else had been appointed to replace him, and so his service in this role ended on November 16, 1813. Floyd was then commissioned as major of the militia on April 20, 1814 and was promoted to the rank of brigadier general of the 17th Brigade of Virginia militia. He served until {{he was elected to the}} Virginia House of Delegates in 1814. During this time, he moved his family again, this time to Thorn Spring, a large plantation in Montgomery County, Virginia. Thornspring (Pulaski) (Thornspring Golf Course) was inherited by Letitia Preston Floyd from her father William Preston and was located near her older brother, Virginia Treasurer, Gen John Preston, and his Horseshoe Bottoms Plantation (Radford Army <b>Ammunition</b> <b>Plant).</b> They both were near the Prestons Smithfield home (Virginia Tech) that their father had completed in Montgomery county for their mother, Susannah Smith Preston, before he died.
