Thus, an <b>alternative</b> <b>allocation</b> {{is considered to be a}} Pareto improvement if and only if the <b>alternative</b> <b>allocation</b> is strictly preferred by all individuals. When contrasted with weak Pareto efficiency, a standard Pareto optimum as described above may be referred to as a [...] "strong Pareto optimum" [...] (SPO).|$|E
5000|$|... "Pareto optimality" [...] is a {{formally}} defined concept used {{to determine}} when an allocation is optimal. Simply put, an allocation is not Pareto optimal {{if there is an}} <b>alternative</b> <b>allocation</b> where improvements can be made to at least one participant's well-being without reducing any other participant's well-being. If there is a transfer that satisfies this condition, the reallocation is called a [...] "Pareto improvement." [...] When no further Pareto improvements are possible, the allocation is a [...] "Pareto optimum." ...|$|E
50|$|Section 57 of the Australian Constitution {{requires}} {{the senate to}} divide the state senators into two classes following a double dissolution, with 3-year and 6-year terms. This has traditionally been done by allocating longer term seats to the senators elected earliest in the count. The 1984 amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act required the Australian Electoral Commission to conduct a recount for half the seats which was seen as producing a fairer allocation. This <b>alternative</b> <b>allocation</b> {{has not yet been}} used. Following double dissolution elections in 1987 and 2016, the first-elected allocation continued to be used, despite Senate resolutions in 1998 and 2010 agreeing to use the new method.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to propose an {{innovative}} score measuring the relative performance – in terms of return – of an asset allocation with respect to the <b>alternative</b> <b>allocations</b> offered to the manager. Intuitively, this score is defined as the percentage of <b>alternative</b> <b>allocations</b> outperformed by the manager’s allocation. In particular, considering the case of a manager investing according to the zero-dollar long/short equally weighted strategy, we study in details the computation and the properties of this score and we deal with the related combinatorial issues when the number of assets is large...|$|R

40|$|The {{allocation}} of resources within a system of autonomous agents, that not only have preferences over <b>alternative</b> <b>allocations</b> of resources but also actively participate in computing an allocation, is an exciting area {{of research at the}} interface of Computer Science and Economics. This paper is a survey {{of some of the most}} salient issues in Multiagent Resource Allocation. In particular, we review various languages to represent the preferences of agents over <b>alternative</b> <b>allocations</b> of resources as well as different measures of social welfare to assess the overall quality of an allocation. We also discuss pertinent issues regarding allocation procedures and present important complexity results. Our presentation of theoretical issues is complemented by a discussion of software packages for the simulation of agent-based market places. We also introduce four major application areas for Multiagent Resource Allocation, namely industrial procurement, sharing of satellite resources, manufacturing control, and grid computing. 2 TFG-MARA Chevaleyre et al...|$|R

40|$|A {{commodity}} {{is shared}} between some individuals: {{there is an}} initial allocation; some selection procedures are used to choose an <b>alternative</b> <b>allocation</b> and individuals decide between keeping the initial allocation or shifting to the <b>alternative</b> <b>allocation.</b> The selection procedures are supposed to involve an element of randomness in order to reflect uncertainty about economic, social and political processes. It is shown that for every allocation, λ, there exists a number, ζ(λ) set membership, variant[0, 1], such that, {{if the number of}} individuals tends to infinity, then the probability that a proportion of the population smaller (resp. larger) than ζ(λ) prefers an allocation chosen by the selection procedure converges to 1 (resp. 0). The index ζ(λ) yields a complete order in the set of Pareto optimal allocations. Illustrations and interpretations of the selection procedures are provided...|$|E

This study examines how <b>alternative</b> water <b>allocations</b> among irrigators in the Upper Klamath Basin could have lowered those costs. Per acre marginal water values vary {{by a factor of}} 20 due primarily to variations in soil productivity, with the highest productivity lands concentrated in the federal Project.

40|$|Many {{local public}} goods are {{allocated}} by federal governments using fixed regional shares: every region is entitled a fixed {{share of the}} total budget for {{a particular type of}} public good. This paper compares this fixed regional sharing rule with two <b>alternative</b> <b>allocation</b> rules: first best and common pool allocation. We find that the fixed regional sharing rule performs relatively well if the regional shares are reasonable. Legislative bargaining theory is used to study the determination of the fixed regional shares. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a formal analysis of how managerial investment incentives {{are affected by}} <b>alternative</b> <b>allocation</b> rules when managerial compensation is based on accounting measures of income that include allocations for investment expenditures.

The income measure created by this allocation rule is usually referred to as residual income or economic value added. Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago. ...|$|E

3000|$|Let us {{consider}} an economy {{in which there}} are only two individuals, j and k, and the initial allocation is given by x'_N∈ X^ 2. Individual k’s choice, which she makes with the preferences that show the lowest concern for health, is characterised by both the good medical disposition and a complete absence of regret, and hence ρ ^g_f_k(x'_k)= 0. Individual j also makes her choice with the preferences that exhibit the lowest concern for health, but she is endowed with the worst medical disposition, that is, the bad one. As a consequence of this she opts for a distribution x'_j of her total resources that entails a larger level of consumption than x'_k. Moreover, she changes her preferences ex post to another set R^b_ 2 that is related to a higher concern for health. Therefore, her measure of well-being loss, ρ ^b_f_j(x'_j)> 0, encompasses the effects of the two factors for which society wants to compensate individuals.
