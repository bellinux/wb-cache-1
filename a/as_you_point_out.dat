500|$|Law {{professor}} and legal commentator Eugene Volokh commented in 2003 {{that regardless of}} the behavior of real frogs, the boiling frog story is useful as a metaphor, comparing it to the metaphor of an ostrich with its head in the sand. Economics Nobel laureate and New York Times op-ed writer Paul Krugman used the story as a metaphor in a July 2009 column, while pointing out that real frogs behave differently. Journalist James Fallows has been advocating since 2006 for people to stop retelling the story, describing it as a [...] "stupid canard" [...] and a [...] "myth". But following Krugman's column, he declared [...] "peace on the boiled frog front" [...] and said that using the story is fine as long <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> it's not literally true.|$|E
6000|$|With {{that year}} one may say, with some justice, {{that the age}} of Turgenev {{had come to an}} end too; yet work so simple and human, so {{independent}} of the transitory formulas and theories of art, belongs <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> in the Preface to Smoke [...] "to all time." ...|$|E

He is, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>point</b> <b>out,</b> certainly Spanish, but {{there really are}} a few estimable gentlemen of that nationality. This one was Governor or Commandante in some part of Cuba, and I believe he got comparatively rich there. They usually do. Still, he's a little fond of the casino, and {{is reported to be}} unlucky, while, in spite of my obvious disadvantages, I am the daughter of Pancho Brown." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "For me, though, {{the real}} issue {{in the book is}} not whether or not one can vanquish the fukú—but whether or not one can even see it. Acknowledge its {{existence}} at a collective level. To be a true witness to who we are as a people and to what has happened to us. That is the essential challenge for the Caribbean nations—who, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> have been annihilated by history and yet who've managed to put themselves together in an amazing way. That's why I thought the book was somewhat hopeful at the end." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{question}} is wide, Ki, {{or so it}} seems to me who, as you say, have little wisdom, and whoever can answer it holds the key of knowledge. Your magic is but a small thing which seems great because so few can handle it. What miracle is it that makes the flower to grow, the child to be born, the Nile to rise, and the sun and stars to shine in heaven? What causes man to be half a beast and half a god and to grow downward to the beast or upward to the god--or both? What is faith and what is unbelief? Who made these things, through them to declare the purposes of life, of death, and of eternity? You shake your head, you do not know; how then can I know who, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>point</b> <b>out,</b> am but foolish? Go get your answer from the lady Merapi's self, only mayhap you will find your questions countered." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{problem which}} you raise {{with respect to}} the subject of the draft opinion in this case is a real one, but I am unsure of whether we should deal with it here. <b>As</b> <b>you</b> <b>point</b> <b>out,</b> {{respondent}} here sought only damages and reinstatement, and therefore we are not directly presented with the question which would be raised if he had in addition sought a delayed Roth hearing by the employer. The precise disposition of his case, had he sought only that sort of a hearing and neither damages nor reinstatement, is to my mind a cloudy and difficult question; it may be the disposition you propose is right, but while I would be happy to reserve the question I would rather not decide it now...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{speak for}} your people," [...] she said. [...] "That is well. I can {{understand}} their simple lives being as absorbing {{to them as}} ours are to us. I can imagine how, here among your hills, <b>you</b> can watch <b>as</b> a spectator a cycle of life which contains, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> have <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> every element of tragedy and happiness. But you yourself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘If I {{could have}} changed my name,’ said Neville, ‘I {{would have done}} so. But <b>as</b> <b>you</b> wisely <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> to me, I can’t do that, for {{it would look like}} guilt. If I could have gone to some distant place, I might have found relief in that, but the thing is not to be thought of, for the same reason. Hiding and {{escaping}} would be the construction in either case. It seems a little hard to be so tied to a stake, and innocent; but I don’t complain.’ ...|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} a very great benefit to me that we drifted into {{collaboration}} largely in its beginning <b>as</b> an accident-when <b>you</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> my mistake over the webs of Drong's tail feather-and the mistake has proved to me well worth while. And here and now I must thank you very warmly for making my collaboration a condition of your undertaking the Mysore and Sunderbans surveys.|$|R
40|$|We thank Dr. F. Conen for his {{positive}} {{comments and}} for his suggestions for extending the work to include potential number concentrations of agricultural soil dust IN active at warmer temperatures. <b>As</b> <b>you</b> <b>point</b> <b>out,</b> because of very small IN number concentrations, {{it is difficult for}} the CFDC to obtain the number fraction of agricultural soil dust particles capable of nucleating ice at temperatures warmer than about – 18 °C. To investigate the ice nucleation properties of the soil dusts at warmer temperatures, your suggestion to collect particles into water followed by analyses using immersion freezing is a good one, and we have indeed tested this approach. This is still an ongoing study, although some preliminary results {{have been reported in the}} 19 th International Conference on Nucleation and Atmospheric Aerosols (Hill et al., 2013). We will report the comprehensive results at warmer temperatures in a forthcoming paper (Hill et al., in preparation). In the revised manscript, we have added the following description: Page 9713, Line 17 : “Given the results of immersion freezing experiments showing that soils having higher contents of organic matter can serve as efficient IN even at temperatures warmer than about – 15 °C (Schnell and Vali, 1972; Conen et al., 2011; Hill et al., 2013...|$|E
40|$|<b>As</b> <b>you</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> in your Editorial (Nature 460, 933; 2009) on the {{distribution}} of human cell lines, withholding scientific material from the broader research community contravenes the basic norms of science. We do not believe, however, that standard international consent guidelines for donors are the solution to this problem and suggest that these should instead be devised on a local scale in collaboration with ethics committees to facilitate tissue distribution. Far from research being “hindered by restrictions from donors” as you suggest, people are generally willing to donate tissue for research, and even to give open-ended consent to unspecified future applications. This willingness is underpinned by donors’ faith in medical research and in their right to protection and confidentiality; the assumption is that their tissue will be used only for ‘ethical’ research. But problems can arise, for example over whether consent covers the proposed usage (at present there are many different models of consent, ranging from specific to general) and when and how tissue should be discarded (K. Aalto-Setälä et al. PLoS Biol. 7, e 1000042; 2009). The answers may not always be obvious, and ethics committees (in collaboration with donors or their representatives) need {{to take into account the}} kind of tissue involved as well as the demographics and potential vulnerability of the donor or donor community, to judge the acceptability of the research proposal. veli...|$|E
60|$|ERNEST. Try one of mine. They {{are rather}} good. I get them direct from Cairo. The only {{use of our}} {{attaches}} is that they supply their friends with excellent tobacco. And as the moon has hidden herself, let us talk a little longer. I am quite ready to admit that I was wrong in what I said about the Greeks. They were, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> have <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> a nation of art-critics. I acknowledge it, and I feel a little sorry for them. For the creative faculty {{is higher than the}} critical. There is really no comparison between them.|$|R
6000|$|... "It only remains," [...] {{continued}} Syme quite unperturbed, [...] "to adopt {{some other}} method {{of breaking the}} ice (if I may so express it) between myself and the man I wish to kill. And since {{the course of a}} dialogue cannot be predicted by one of its parties alone (<b>as</b> <b>you</b> have <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> with such recondite acumen), the only thing to be done, I suppose, is for the one party, as far as possible, to do all the dialogue by himself. And so I will, by George!" [...] And he stood up suddenly, his yellow hair blowing in the slight sea breeze.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘So, you {{settled with}} her that you would come back at Christmas?’ {{observed}} Jasper. ‘I see! Mr. Grewgious, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> quite fairly said just now, there is such an exceptional attachment between my nephew and me, that I am more sensitive for the dear, fortunate, happy, happy fellow than for myself. But it is only right that the young lady should be considered, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> have <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> and that I should accept my cue from you. I accept it. I understand that at Christmas they will complete their preparations for May, and that their marriage will be put in final train by themselves, and that nothing will remain for us but to put ourselves in train also, and have everything ready for our formal release from our trusts, on Edwin’s birthday.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{there is}} this Miss Merton--though I do not know her well enough to venture {{absolutely}} on a recommendation. Now, I told Lucy, no later than yesterday, while {{we were on the}} river, and <b>as</b> <b>you</b> were <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> to Miss Merton the forts in the Highlands, that I thought you would make one of the handsomest couples in the state--and, moreover, I told her--bless me, how this corn grows! The plants will be in tassel in a few days, and the crop must turn out most beneficent--truly, truly--there is a providence in all things; for, at first, I was for putting the corn on yonder hill-side, and the potatoes here; but old Hiram was led by some invisible agency to insist on this field for the corn, and the hill-side for the potatoes--and, now, look, and see what crops are in promise! Think of a nigger's blundering on such a thing?" ...|$|R
60|$|I take, then, {{this one}} {{institution}} as a test. As every normal man desires a woman, and children {{born of a}} woman, every normal man desires a house of his own to put them into. He does not merely want a roof above him and a chair below him; he wants an objective and visible kingdom; a fire at which he can cook what food he likes, a door he can open to what friends he chooses. This is the normal appetite of men; I do not say there are not exceptions. There may be saints above the need and philanthropists below it. Opalstein, now he is a duke, may have got used to more than this; {{and when he was}} a convict may have got used to less. But the normality of the thing is enormous. To give nearly everybody ordinary houses would please nearly everybody; that is what I assert without apology. Now in modern England (<b>as</b> <b>you</b> eagerly <b>point</b> <b>out)</b> {{it is very difficult to}} give nearly everybody houses. Quite so; I merely set up the desideratum; and ask the reader to leave it standing there while he turns with me to a consideration of what really happens in the social wars of our time.|$|R
6000|$|The second archer, who had {{curly hair}} and was pale, poetical, and rather effeminate, had merely gone {{out into the}} garden {{and stared at the}} moon. When the moon had become too wide, blank, and watery, even for his own wide, blank, and watery eyes, he came in again. And when the king said [...] "What have you been shooting?" [...] he {{answered}} with great volubility, [...] "I have shot a man; not a man from Tartary, not a man from Europe, Asia, Africa, or America; not a man on this earth at all. I have shot the Man in the Moon." [...] "Shot the Man in the Moon?" [...] repeated the king with something like a mild surprise. [...] "It is easy to prove it," [...] said the archer with hysterical haste. [...] "Examine the moon through this particularly powerful telescope, and you will no longer find any traces of a man there." [...] The king glued his big blue idiotic eye to the telescope for about ten minutes, and then said, [...] "You are right: <b>as</b> <b>you</b> have often <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> scientific truth can only be tested by the senses. I believe you." [...] And the second archer went out, and being of a more emotional temperament burst into tears.|$|R
