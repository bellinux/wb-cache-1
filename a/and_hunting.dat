5|$|Despite {{reproducing}} readily {{in captivity}} {{and being the}} most populous lemur in zoos worldwide, numbering more than 2,000 individuals, the ring-tailed lemur is listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List due to habitat destruction <b>and</b> <b>hunting</b> for bush meat and the exotic pet trade. As of early 2017, {{the population in the}} wild is believed to have crashed as low as 2,000 individuals due to habitat loss, poaching <b>and</b> <b>hunting,</b> making them far more critically endangered.|$|E
5|$|Fishing <b>and</b> <b>hunting</b> {{are popular}} outdoor {{activities}} in South Dakota. Fishing contributes over $224million to South Dakota's economy, <b>and</b> <b>hunting</b> contributes over $303million. In 2007, over 275,000 hunting licences and 175,000 fishing licences {{were sold in}} the state; around half of the hunting licences and over two-thirds of the fishing licences were purchased by South Dakotans. Popular species of game include pheasants, white-tailed deer, mule deer, and turkeys, as well as waterfowl such as Canada geese, snow geese, and mallards. Targets of anglers include walleye in the eastern glacial lakes and Missouri River reservoirs, Chinook salmon in Lake Oahe, and trout in the Black Hills.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes are {{implicated in}} the {{predation}} of game and song birds, hares, rabbits, muskrats, and young ungulates, particularly in preserves, reserves, <b>and</b> <b>hunting</b> farms where ground nesting birds are protected and raised, {{as well as in}} poultry farms.|$|E

5|$|Scholar Jesse Byock {{notes that}} the goddess Skaði is also {{associated}} with winter <b>and</b> <b>hunting,</b> and that the episode in Volsunga saga involving the male Skaði, Sigi, and Breði has been theorized as stemming from an otherwise lost myth.|$|E
5|$|Having {{inherited}} the Habsburg lip {{and not very}} feminine looks, Mary was not considered physically attractive. Her portraits, letters, and comments by her contemporaries do not assign her the easy Burgundian charm possessed by her grandmother, Duchess Mary of Burgundy, and her aunt Margaret.

5|$|Human {{activities}} such as encroachment of settlements, agriculture, <b>and</b> <b>hunting</b> in rural areas {{poses a threat to}} the Natal red rock hare, due to which its population is decreasing. Since the 1900s, more than 21% to 50% of its habitat has been destroyed, which is predicted to remain between 21% and 50% till 2022, decreasing its population by 20% or more by then.|$|E

5|$|Official {{efforts to}} protect this area started in 1960, when Senator Augusto Guzmán Robles {{presented}} a bill to the Peruvian Congress {{for the creation of}} Huascarán National Park. In 1963, the Forestry <b>and</b> <b>Hunting</b> Service (Servicio Forestal y de Caza) presented a preliminary project for the delimitation of the Cordillera Blanca National Park, covering an area of 321,000 hectares. On February 18, 1966 a government resolution prohibiting the logging <b>and</b> <b>hunting</b> of native species {{in the area of the}} Cordillera Blanca was issued. Later that year, the Patronage of Huascarán National Park was formed in Yungay. In 1967, Curry Slaymaker and Joel Albrecht, Peace Corps volunteers, formulated delimitation proposal on an area of 85,000 hectares; and simultaneously, the Forest Regional Service of Huaraz established the vicuña and queen-of the-Andes surveillance zone for an area of approximately 10,000 hectares. Finally, on July 1, 1975 Huascarán National Park was created by decree No. 0622-75-AG, with an extension of 340 000 hectares.|$|E

5|$|River otters are {{renowned for}} {{their sense of}} play. Otter play mostly {{consists}} of wrestling with conspecifics. Chasing is also a common game. River otters rely upon play to learn survival skills such as fighting <b>and</b> <b>hunting.</b> However, playful behavior was found in only 6% of 294 observations in a study in Idaho, and was limited mostly to immature otters.|$|E
5|$|The last {{surviving}} raphine species, the Rodrigues solitaire, probably became extinct before 1778. The dodo survived until 1662 or 1690. The Rodrigues solitaire became extinct {{because of}} the introduction of feral cats and heavy hunting by the human population. Although the dodo became extinct earlier, the causes of extinction are related and involve the introduction of animals <b>and</b> <b>hunting.</b>|$|E
5|$|The picture {{he painted}} {{of his father}} was of a pious {{religious}} man who {{was not interested in}} the affairs of this world.

He also recounted a few battles his father joined against the crusaders in his autobiography Kitab al Itibar.|$|E

5|$|When Nasr died in 1098, Usama's father, Majd Al-Deen Abi Salamah Murshed (1068- 1137) {{became the}} emir of Shaizar and the {{surrounding}} cities. However he soon gave up his position to Usama's Uncle (Iz Al-Deen Abi Al-Asaker Sultan Mrdad), Sultan, since Murshid {{was more interested in}} studying religion, writing the Quraan <b>and</b> <b>hunting</b> than matters of politics.|$|E
5|$|A tabloid {{paper offers}} a $10,000 reward for the tiger causing {{the town to}} be {{inundated}} with hunters and reporters. The sheriff forbids anyone from going in the woods <b>and</b> <b>hunting</b> the tiger, but while out with Deputy Sharon Weinman (Sarah Constible), he sees Roy in the woods. They give chase, but instead find a dead tabloid reporter. The National Guard is called in to help. The sheriff later sees Roy in the woods again and warns him to stay out before taking him home and giving Rose the same warning. After he leaves, she mistakenly believes Roy told the sheriff lies about there being a tiger and chastises him.|$|E

5|$|Across {{the texts}} of Hinduism, there is a profusion of ideas about the virtue of Ahimsa when applied to {{non-human}} life, but without a universal consensus. Alsdorf claims the debate and disagreements between supporters of vegetarian lifestyle and meat eaters was significant. Even suggested exceptions – ritual slaughter <b>and</b> <b>hunting</b> – were challenged by advocates of Ahimsa. In the Mahabharata both sides present various arguments to substantiate their viewpoints. Moreover, a hunter defends his profession in a long discourse.|$|E
5|$|Albany died in 1420, and Doune, the dukedom of Albany, and the Regency all {{passed to}} his son Murdoch (1362–1425). The ransom for James I was finally paid to the English, and the King {{returned}} in 1424, taking immediate steps {{to gain control of}} his kingdom. Albany and two of his sons were imprisoned for treason, and then executed in May 1425. Doune Castle became a royal possession, under an appointed Captain, or Keeper, and served as a retreat <b>and</b> <b>hunting</b> lodge for the Scottish monarchs. It was also used as a dower house by Mary of Guelders (c.1434–1463), Margaret of Denmark (1456–1486), and Margaret Tudor (1489–1541), the widowed consorts of James II, James III and James IV respectively.|$|E
5|$|Albatrosses {{combine these}} soaring {{techniques}} {{with the use}} of predictable weather systems: albatrosses in the Southern Hemisphere flying north from their colonies will take a clockwise route, and those flying south will fly counterclockwise. Albatrosses are so well adapted to this lifestyle that their heart rates while flying are close to their basal heart rate when resting. This efficiency is such that the most energetically demanding aspect of a foraging trip is not the distance covered, but the landings, take-offs <b>and</b> <b>hunting</b> they undertake having found a food source. A common assumption is that albatrosses must be able to sleep in flight, although no direct evidence has ever been obtained.|$|E
