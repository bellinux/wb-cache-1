2500|$|The vast {{majority}} of France's territory and population is situated in Western Europe and is called Metropolitan France, to distinguish it from the country's various overseas polities. It is bordered by the North Sea in the north, the English Channel in the northwest, the Atlantic Ocean {{in the west and}} the Mediterranean sea in the southeast. It land borders consist of Belgium and Luxembourg in the northeast, Germany and Switzerland in the east, Italy and Monaco in the southeast, and <b>Andorra</b> <b>and</b> <b>Spain</b> (including the unrecognised Catalan Republic) in the south and southwest. With the exception of the northeast, most of France's land borders are roughly delineated by natural boundaries and geographic features: to the south and southeast, the Pyrenees and the Alps and the Jura, respectively, and to the east, the Rhine river. Due to its shape, France {{is often referred to as}} [...] ("The Hexagon"). Metropolitan France includes various coastal islands, of which the largest is Corsica. Metropolitan France is situated mostly between latitudes 41° and 51° N, and longitudes 6° W and 10° E, on the western edge of Europe, and thus lies within the northern temperate zone. Its continental part covers about 1000km from north to south and from east to west.|$|E

5000|$|In 1997, the Eurovision Song Contest {{began to}} phase in public televoting to {{determine}} its winner, with a mass rollout beginning in 1998. Initially, televotes completely replaced the previous system, in which entries were scored by regional juries. These changes led to the increased prominence of [...] "bloc voting"—in which a country's voting pattern would commonly favour neighbouring nations (such as Scandinavian, Baltic, Balkan, and CIS countries), and countries with similar cultures (<b>Andorra</b> <b>and</b> <b>Spain).</b> From 2009 to 2015, most countries used a 50/50 split between a jury and televoting results. Since 2016, most countries still use a televoting process and a jury to determine the results, the votes are no longer combined and instead treated separately.|$|E

50|$|The Mediterranean {{pine vole}} is endemic {{to the greater}} Iberian Peninsula. Its range extends from {{southern}} France through <b>Andorra,</b> Portugal, <b>and</b> <b>Spain,</b> except for the northwestern corner of Spain, at altitudes of up to 2,250 m. It is widespread throughout its range and in some parts is common, with four hundred to six hundred animals per hectare having been recorded. It does not experience wide population swings as does the woodland vole (Microtus pinetorum). This species is mostly found in lowland areas where the soil is deep and light. It is found in clover-rich pasture, meadows, fallow land and orchards. In years {{in which it is}} plentiful it can be an agricultural pest.|$|R
50|$|The {{heraldry}} {{of southern}} France, <b>Andorra,</b> <b>Spain,</b> <b>and</b> Italy {{is characterized by}} a lack of crests, and uniquely shaped shields. Portuguese heraldry, however, does use crests. Portuguese and Spanish heraldry occasionally introduce words to the shield of arms, a practice disallowed in British heraldry. Latin heraldry is known for extensive use of quartering, because of armorial inheritance via the male and the female lines. Moreover, Italian heraldry is dominated by the Roman Catholic Church, featuring many shields and achievements, most bearing some reference to the Church.|$|R
50|$|Spanish fascist {{dictator}} General Francisco Franco contemplated {{joining the}} war on the German side. The Spanish Falangists made numerous border claims. Franco claimed French Basque departments, Catalan-speaking Roussillon, Cerdagne <b>and</b> <b>Andorra.</b> <b>Spain</b> also wanted to reclaim Gibraltar from the United Kingdom because of the symbolic and strategic value. Franco also called for the reunification of Morocco as a Spanish protectorate, the annexation of the Oran district from French Algeria and large-scale expansion of Spanish Guinea. This last project was especially unfeasible because it overlapped German territorial ambition to reclaim German Cameroon <b>and</b> <b>Spain</b> would mostly likely be forced to give up Guinea entirely. Spain also sought federation with Portugal on common cultural and historical grounds (such as the Iberian Union).|$|R

40|$|This {{presentation}} is a résumé {{of the third}} book published by Victor Pou {{on the subject of}} <b>Andorra</b> <b>and</b> its international relations, specially dealing with the European Union (EU). His first book was published in 1986 about the impact for <b>Andorra</b> of Portugal <b>and</b> <b>Spain</b> joining the European Community. The second appeared in 1994 dealing with the effects for Andorra of the creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The third appeared in 2002 on Andorra?s options in negotiating a new agreement or a set of new sectoral agreements with the EU, after the success of the first customs union agreement Andorra-EU signed in 1990 and in force since 1991. Published by Credit Andorrà, an Andorran bank, the book provides information for the current debate in Andorra {{about the nature of the}} new agreement or agreements to be signed with the EU. The different options are presented: membership to the EU, association, new commercial agreement, list of sectoral agreements, joining the European Economic Espace(EEE), or standing still. The explicit will of the Andorran government is to achieve a new set of more ambitious agreements with the EU. However the opinions contained in the book only represent the personal ones of the author, not his official position in the European Commission in Brussels. The first chapter talks of the evolution of the relations between <b>Andorra</b> <b>and</b> the EU. The second chapter deals with the progressive approximation process of Andorra to the EU. The author favours this progression without reaching full membership (asymptotic model), as full membership in the EU is not of interest for Andorra nor is it possible because Andorra does not fulfil some criteria for membership such as capacity to assume all the ?acquis communautaire? or institutional capabilities (Andorra does fulfil two other criteria: a democratic political regime and an advanced market economy) ...|$|R
