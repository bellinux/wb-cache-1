5000|$|Hunt defines that [...] "two {{colors are}} {{complementary}} {{when it is}} possible to reproduce the tristimulus values of a specified <b>achromatic</b> <b>stimulus</b> by an additive mixture of these two stimuli." [...] That is, when two colored lights can be mixed to match a specified white (achromatic, non-colored) light, the colors of those two lights are complementary. This definition, however, does not constrain what version of white will be specified. In the nineteenth century, the scientists Grassmann and Helmholtz did experiments in which they concluded that finding a good complement for spectral yellow was difficult, but that the result was indigo, that is, a wavelength that today's color scientists would call violet. Helmholtz says [...] "Yellow and indigo blue" [...] are complements. Grassmann reconstructs Newton's category boundaries in terms of wavelengths and says [...] "This indigo therefore falls within the limits of color between which, according to Helmholtz, the complementary colors of yellow lie." ...|$|E

However, it remains unclear whether LFPs can detect weak cortical responses (e. g., cortical responses to equiluminant color) and whether they have enough visual spatial resolution to distinguishdifferent chromatic and <b>achromatic</b> <b>stimulus</b> patterns. By recording fromawake behavingmacaques in primary visual cortex, here we demonstrate that LFPs respond robustly to pure chromatic stimuli and exhibit ∼ 2. 5 times lower spatial resolution for chromatic than <b>achromatic</b> <b>stimulus</b> patterns, a value that resembles the ratio of achromatic/chromatic resolution measured with psychophysical experiments in humans. We also show that, although the spatial resolution of LFP decays with visual eccentricity as is also the case for single neurons, LFPs have higher spatial resolution and show weaker response suppression to low spatial frequencies than spiking multiunit activity. These results indicate that LFP recordings are an excellent approach to measure spatial resolution from local populations of neurons in visual cortex including those responsive to color.

We measured infant VEPs using low spatial frequency, onset–offset stimuli, modulated along the three axes of a cone-based color space (Derrington et al. [J Physiol 1984; 357, 241 – 265. ]). Three color-normal infants were tested in a longitudinal design over the first postnatal year. One red/green color-deficient infant was also tested at 197 days. We found that VEP responses to S-axis (tritan) stimuli have their initial onset later than responses to red/green (L–M) or <b>achromatic</b> <b>stimuli,</b> and that developmental changes in VEP waveforms are more complex and longer lasting for chromatic than for <b>achromatic</b> <b>stimuli.</b> Possible mechanisms underlying these changes are discussed...|$|R

An improved method of systems analysis has allowed us to explore the dynamics of the colour-opponent subregions of P-cell receptive fields with a single chromatic stimulus. The data show that the centre and surround subregions of the P-cell receptive field have similar temporal responses, but the surround is slightly delayed. The centre and surround demonstrate a large degree of chromatic selectivity. The responses of the centre and surround subregions were fitted with a linear model and the model was used to predict the responses of P cells to new chromatic and <b>achromatic</b> <b>stimuli.</b> Although linear models predict the chromatic responses well, simple linear combinations of centre and surround responses fail to predict P-cell responses to <b>achromatic</b> <b>stimuli.</b> The temporal responses of the different subpopulations of P cells, such as ON/OFF or L-centre/M-centre were not significantly different...|$|R
40|$|Spatial {{facilitation}} {{has been}} observed with luminance-defined, <b>achromatic</b> <b>stimuli</b> on <b>achromatic</b> backgrounds {{as well as with}} targets and inducers defined by colour contrast. This paper reviews psychophysical results from detection experiments with human observers showing the conditions under which spatially separated contour inducers facilitate the detection of simultaneously presented target stimuli. The findings point towards two types of spatial mechanisms: (i) Short-range mechanisms that are sensitive to narrowly spaced stimuli of small size and, at distinct target locations, selective to the contrast polarity of targets and inducers. (ii) Long-range mechanisms that are triggered by longer stimuli, generate facilitation across wider spatial gaps between targets and inducers, and are insensitive to their contrast polarity. Spatial facilitation with chromatic stimuli requires a longer inducer exposure than spatial facilitation with <b>achromatic</b> <b>stimuli,</b> which is already fully effective at inducer exposures of 30 ms.

Subjects were infants of 8, 14, 20 and 32 weeks of age, and adults. Stimuli were 20 deg, 0. 3 – 4 cyc/deg sinusoidal gratings, counterphased at 6 Hz and modulated through white. Achromatic and chromatic CSFs for all ages could be fit simultaneously with a double exponential equation of a common, lowpass shape. Both achromatic and chromatic CSFs exhibited developmental shifts in both sensitivity and spatial scale. From 8 weeks to adulthood, sensitivity increased by 0. 64 log units for achromatic gratings and by 0. 91 log units for chromatic gratings, yielding an 0. 27 log unit larger sensitivity change for chromatic than for <b>achromatic</b> <b>stimuli.</b> Spatial scale shifts were closely similar across achromatic and chromatic CSFs, and were consistent with the factor of about four predicted on the basis of changes in foveal receptor packing density and eye size.

40|$|A {{nighttime}} {{field study}} was conducted to assess the effects of color on the detection of retroreflective pedestrian markings. Participants, seated in a stationary vehicle with its low-beam headlamps on, indicated when a moving pedestrian, who wore colored retroreflective markings on her legs, was just detectable. Independent variables included color (red, yellow, green, and white), retroreflective power (SIA), and participant age. This experiment demonstrated that the color of a retroreflective marking does affect the distance at which a moving pedestrian can be detected. Specifically, all three chromatic stimuli examined (red, yellow, and green) were detected at significantly greater distances (ranging from 7 to 10 %) than was the <b>achromatic</b> <b>stimulus</b> (white). Additional modeling determined that to be detected at the same distance as a red, yellow, or green stimulus, a white stimulus would need to be 26 to 44 % higher in SIA value. The results are consistent with previous research by Schumann et al. (1996), in which colored retroreflective stimuli were perceived by participants to be brighter than a comparable white stimulus. Furthermore, the findings are in agreement with the Helmholtz-Kohlrausch effect. In addition, a strong linear relationship was found to exist between the color correction factors determined in this experiment and those predicted by ASTM E 1501. However, the exact relationship between the experimental results and predicted ASTM color correction factors appears to be affected {{by the nature of the}} experimental task...|$|E

Accordingly, this study investigated visual function and color perception in adolescents with ADHD using color Visual Evoked Potentials (cVEP), which provides an objective measure of color perception. MethodThirty-one adolescents (aged 13 – 18), 16 with a confirmed diagnosis of ADHD, and 15 healthy peers, matched for age, gender, and IQ participated in the study. All underwent an ophthalmological exam, as well as electrophysiological testing color Visual Evoked Potentials (cVEP), which measured the latency and amplitude of the neural P 1 response to chromatic (blue–yellow, red–green) and <b>achromatic</b> <b>stimuli.</b> ResultNo intergroup {{differences were found in}} the ophthalmological exam. However, significantly larger P 1 amplitude was found for blue and yellow stimuli, but not red/green or <b>achromatic</b> <b>stimuli,</b> in the ADHD group (particularly in the medicated group) compared to controls. ConclusionLarger amplitude in the P 1 component for blue–yellow in the ADHD group compared to controls may account for the lack of difference in color perception tasks. We speculate that the larger amplitude for blue–yellow stimuli in early sensory processing (P 1) might reflect a compensatory strategy for underlying problems including compromised retinal input of s-cones due to hypo-dopaminergic tone...|$|R

METHODS: Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) in response to <b>achromatic</b> <b>stimuli</b> with low luminance contrast and low spatial frequency, and isoluminant red/green and blue/yellow stimuli with high spatial frequency were recorded in 10 dyslexic children and 10 age- and sex-matched, healthy subjects.

To our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that a dysfunction of colour vision has been brought to light in an objective way (i. e., by means of electrophysiological methods) in children with DD. CONCLUSION: These results give rise to speculation concerning the need for a putative approach for promoting both learning how to read and/or improving existing reading skills of children with or at risk of DD.

40|$|An <b>achromatic</b> <b>stimulus</b> {{is defined}} as a patch of light that is devoid of any hue. This is usually {{achieved}} by asking observers to adjust the stimulus such that it looks neither red nor green {{and at the same time}} neither yellow nor blue. Despite the theoretical and practical importance of the achromatic locus, little is known about the variability in these settings. The main purpose of the current study was to evaluate whether achromatic settings were dependent on the task of the observers, namely the navigation direction in color space. Observers could either adjust the test patch along the two chromatic axes in the CIE u*v* diagram or, alternatively, navigate along the unique-hue lines. Our main result is that the navigation method affects the reliability of these achromatic settings. Observers are able to make more reliable achromatic settings when adjusting the test patch along the directions defined by the four unique hues as opposed to navigating along the main axes in the commonly used CIE u*v* chromaticity plane. This result holds across different ambient viewing conditions (Dark, Daylight, Cool White Fluorescent) and different test luminance levels (5, 20, and 50 cd/m 2). The reduced variability in the achromatic settings is consistent with the idea that internal color representations are more aligned with the unique-hue lines than the u* and v* axes.

40|$|A {{nighttime}} {{field study}} was conducted to assess the effects of color on the detection of retroreflective pedestrian markings by color normal and color deficient drivers. Participants seated in a stationary vehicle, with its low-beam headlamps on, indicated when a moving pedestrian, who wore colored retroreflective markings on her legs, was just detectable. Independent variables included color (red, yellow, green, and white), retroreflective power, participant age, color-vision capability, and location of the stimulus in the visual field (centrally or peripherally located). This experiment demonstrated that, for persons with normal color vision, the color of a retroreflective marking affects the distance at which a pedestrian, located in the central portion of the visual field, can be detected. This result is consistent with previous research for color normal individuals (Sayer et al., 1998). Specifically, colored retroreflective stimuli were detected at distances 3 to 6 % greater than a photometrically matched <b>achromatic</b> <b>stimulus.</b> Furthermore, the findings are qualitatively in agreement with the Helmholtz-Kohlrausch effect. Color deficiency had a measurable, although limited, influence on the effect of color on detection distance. The results with regard to central versus peripheral locations were not conclusive. This study, as well as a related previous study (Sayer et al., 1998) indicated that, under the conditions of this experiment, color influences detection distance to a lesser extent than suggested by the color correction factors prescribed in ASTM E 1501. Tentatively, the discrepancy seems to be accounted for {{by the size of the}} retroreflective markings, in terms of visual angle, at the point at which drivers first detect or recognize them. The ASTM correction factors may be appropriate for larger visual angles, but smaller correction factors may be more appropriate if retroreflective markings can be expected to have very small visual angles (approaching point sources) at critical distances. However, the influence of color and its interaction with visual angle has not been fully characterized by this study or by the previous studies of retroreflective stimuli, and further research on the effects of color, SIA, and size is needed...|$|E

The IC effect is observed across {{a wide range of}} stimulus parameters, though until now it always involved high-contrast <b>achromatic</b> <b>stimuli.</b> Whether IC perception and its brain mechanisms differ {{as a function of the}} type of stimulus cue remains unknown. Resolving such will provide insights on whether there is a unique or multiple solutions to how the brain binds together spatially fractionated information into a cohesive perception. Here, participants discriminated IC from no-contour (NC) control stimuli that were either comprised of low-contrast <b>achromatic</b> <b>stimuli</b> or instead isoluminant chromatic contrast stimuli (presumably biasing processing to the magnocellular and parvocellular pathways, respectively) on separate blocks of trials. Behavioural analyses revealed that ICs were readily perceived independently of the stimulus cue-i. e. when defined by either chromatic or luminance contrast. VEPs were analysed within an electrical neuroimaging framework and revealed a generally similar timing of IC effects across both stimulus contrasts (i. e. at ~ 90 ms). Additionally, an overall phase shift of the VEP on the order of ~ 30 ms was consistently observed in response to chromatic vs. luminance contrast independently of the presence/absence of ICs. Critically, topographic differences in the IC effect were observed over the ~ 110 - 160 ms period; different configurations of intracranial sources contributed to IC sensitivity as a function of stimulus contrast. Distributed source estimations localized these differences to LOC as well as V 1 /V 2.

When presented with narrow-band colours the hemianopes detected a stimulus maximally effective for S-cones but invisible to M- and L-cones, indicating that blindsight is mediated not just by the mid-brain, which receives no S-cone input, or that the rods contribute to blindsight.

It is also shown that the Singh-Anderson mode! is invalid in principle in that, unlike Metelli's mode!, it fails co capture the principle of independence of the effects of a, b, p, and q on T...|$|R
40|$|A psychophysical {{experiment}} {{was performed to}} determine the effects of lightness dependency on suprathreshold lightness tolerances. Using a pass/fail method of constant stimuli, lightness tolerance thresholds were measured using <b>achromatic</b> <b>stimuli</b> centered at CIELAB L* = 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 90 using 44 observers. In addition to measuring tolerance thresholds for uniform samples, lightness tolerances were measured using stimuli with a simulated texture of thread wound on a card. A texture intermediate between the wound thread and the uniform stimuli was also used. A computer-controlled CRT was used to perform the experiments. Lightness tolerances were found to increase with increasing lightness of the test stimuli. For the uniform stimuli this effect was only evident at the higher lightnesses. For the textured stimuli, this trend was more evident throughout the whole lightness range. Texture had an effect of increasing the tolerance thresholds by a factor of almost 2 as compared to the uniform stimuli. The intermediate texture had tolerance thresholds that were between those of the uniform and full-textured stimuli. Transforming the results into a plot of threshold vs. intensity produced results that were more uniform across the three conditions. This may indicate that CIELAB is not the best space in which to model these effects...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIt is {{well known}} that {{chromatic}} information can assist in solving the stereo correspondence problem. It has also been suggested that there are two independent first-order stereopsis mechanisms, one sensitive to chromatic contrast and the other sensitive to luminance contrast (Vision Research 37 (1997) 1271). Could the effect of chromatic information on stereo correspondence be subserved by interactions between these mechanisms? To address this question, disparity thresholds (1 /stereoacuity) were measured using 0. 5 cpd Gabor patches. The stimuli possessed different relative amounts of chromatic and luminance contrast which could be correlated or anti-correlated between the eyes. Stereoscopic performance with these compound stimuli was compared to that with purely isoluminant and isochromatic stimuli at different contrasts. It was found that anti-correlated chromatic contrast severely disrupted stereopsis with <b>achromatic</b> <b>stimuli</b> and that anti-correlated luminance contrast severely disrupted stereopsis with chromatic stimuli. Less dramatic, but still significant, was the improvement in stereoacuity obtained using correlated colour and luminance contrast. These data are consistent with there being positive and negative interactions between chromatic and achromatic stereopsis mechanisms that take place after the initial encoding of disparity information, but before the extraction of stereoscopic depth. These interactions can be modelled satisfactorily assuming probability summation of depth sign information between independent mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Color is {{a salient}} feature which conveys {{important}} {{information about the}} objects in our visual world and may help identification and recognition. Previous psychophysical experiments in humans suggest that color can be beneficial in visual memory tasks, when shape information is no longer available. Here, we ask whether color in natural scenes improves object recognition under conditions in which shape information is degraded. We used a procedure based on Fourier analysis to create natural scenes, for which we manipulated color and shape information independently. Psychophysical performance of human observers was measured in a delayed matching to sample paradigm. Our observers were presented with natural scenes that contained object related (color image), irrelevant (colored noise) or no color (achromatic image and noise) for which we parametrically varied shape information by introducing noise into the images. Subjects performed significantly better when images contained object related color than no or irrele vant color information across the different noise levels (N = 8, p< 0. 05). In addition, performance across subjects did not differ for the <b>achromatic</b> <b>stimuli</b> and the images including unrelated color. Our results suggest that recognition of natural scenes can be enhanced by color information that {{is related to the}} object...|$|R
40|$|In {{children}} with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, color vision losses have {{been related to}} dystrophin deletions downstream of exon 30, which affect a dystrophin isoform, Dp 260, present in the retina. To further evaluate visual function in DMD children, we measured spatial, temporal, and chromatic red-green and blue-yellow contrast sensitivity in two groups of DMD {{children with}} gene deletion downstream and upstream of exon 30. Psychophysical spatial contrast sensitivity was measured for low, middle, and high spatial frequencies with achromatic gratings and for low and middle frequencies with red-green and blue-yellow chromatic gratings. Temporal contrast sensitivity was also measured with <b>achromatic</b> <b>stimuli.</b> A reduction in sensitivity at all spatial luminance contrasts was found for the DMD patients with deletion downstream of exon 30. Similar results were found for temporal luminance contrast sensitivity. Red-green chromatic contrast sensitivity was reduced in DMD children with deletion downstream of exon 30, whereas blue-yellow chromatic contrast sensitivity showed no significant differences. We conclude that visual function is impaired in DMD children. Furthermore, we report a genotype-phenotype relationship because the visual impairment occurred in children with deletion downstream but not upstream of exon 30, affecting the retinal isoform of dystrophin Dp 260.
