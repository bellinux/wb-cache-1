5|$|Although {{the seeds}} of both {{proactive}} government repression against the Puerto Rican independence movement had been planted before the Grito de Lares, and its aftermath only guaranteed the surge of autonomism as a political alternative in the island, the level of cultural and social development of a collective Puerto Rican conscience was almost <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> the event.

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>direct</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> the {{invasion}} was the almost total {{elimination of the}} old English aristocracy {{and the loss of}} English control over the Catholic Church in England. William systematically dispossessed English landowners and conferred their property on his continental followers. The Domesday Book meticulously documents the impact of this colossal programme of expropriation, revealing that by 1086 only about 5 per cent of land in England south of the Tees was left in English hands. Even this tiny residue was further diminished in the decades that followed, the elimination of native landholding being most complete in southern parts of the country.|$|E

5|$|The action {{came about}} as <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> the Battle of Grand Port three weeks earlier, {{in which a}} British {{squadron}} had been destroyed in a failed attack on Grand Port harbour on Isle de France. This gave the French forces on the island a significant regional advantage, outnumbering the British frigate on the recently captured Île Bourbon, commanded by Commodore Josias Rowley, by six to one. British reinforcements were hastily despatched to the area but the French were blockading Île Bourbon in force and the arriving reinforcements were in constant danger of attack by more powerful French units. Africaine was the first ship to reinforce Rowley's squadron, but within three days of her arrival in the region was engaged by two French ships while attempting to drive them away from Saint Denis on Île Bourbon. Corbet was severely wounded in the opening exchanges and subsequently died. Although his crew fought hard, they were overwhelmed by the French frigates and forced to surrender, only for Rowley to arrive in HMS Boadicea and drive off the French warships, recapturing Africaine.|$|E

30|$|This is <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> the lemmas in the {{previous}} section. There is, however, a simplification in the square case, namely the translation T_π(e_ 1 +e_ 2) is a symmetry. Indeed, using Lemma  3.1, it is straightforward to show that J_LR(T_π(e_ 1 +e_ 2)x,T_π (e_ 1 +e_ 2)y)=J_LR(x,y). Note that the translation T_π (e_ 1 +e_ 2) commutes with T_ 2 πe_ 1 and R_ϕ _ 0 ^p_c. Finally, let us show that T_ 2 πe_ 1 is generated by the group elements listed in the lemma. Indeed, T_π (e_ 1 -e_ 2)=(R_ϕ_ 0 ^p_c)^- 1 T_π (e_ 1 +e_ 2) and T_ 2 πe_ 1 = T_π(e_ 1 -e_ 2)+T_π(e_ 1 +e_ 2).|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} {{a class of}} insertion–deletion systems which have not been investigated so far, those without any context controlling the insertion–deletion operations. Rather unexpectedly, we found that context-free insertion–deletion systems characterize the recursively enumerable languages. Moreover, this assertion is valid for systems with only one axiom, and also using inserted and deleted strings of a small length. <b>As</b> <b>direct</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> the main result we found that set-conditional insertion–deletion systems with two axioms generate any recursively enumerable language (this solves an open problem), {{as well as that}} membrane systems with one membrane having context-free insertion–deletion rules without conditional use of them generate all recursively enumerable languages (this improves an earlier result). Some open problems are also formulated...|$|R
