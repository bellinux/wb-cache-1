500|$|The next morning, Conkling then {{submitted}} {{a resolution that}} bound every delegate in the hall to support the party's nominee. Conkling said that [...] "no man should hold his seat here who is not ready so to agree." [...] A voice vote was called, and the resolution received nearly unanimous delegate support. However, about {{a dozen or so}} delegates answered [...] "no". Conkling was shocked. He asked, [...] " [...] at a Republican convention would vote 'no' on such a resolution?" [...] He then demanded a roll call to identify the dissenters. Most of the dissenters chose not to declare their disagreement in front of the thousands of spectators at the [...] "Glass Palace". Only three delegates, all from West Virginia, voted [...] "no" [...] to the resolution, and were showered with a [...] "storm of hisses." [...] Conkling then issued another resolution to strip the three West Virginians of their votes and squash their voices at the convention. The West Virginians revolted against Conkling's resolution, and heavily criticized him for his motion. James Garfield, who was sitting at the Ohio delegation, stood up and tried to settle the matter. He stated that the convention would be making a big mistake if they approved Conkling's motion, and he asked the delegates for their time in order to state his case. Garfield argued that the three West Virginians should not [...] "be disenfranchised because they thought it was not the time to make such an expression [...]" [...] He stated that [...] "there never can be a convention...that shall bind my vote <b>against</b> <b>my</b> <b>will</b> on any question whatever." [...] Garfield had won the crowd over with his speech. Conkling did not particularly enjoy the situation. He scribbled a note to Garfield which read, [...] "New York requests that Ohio's real candidate and dark horse come forward...R.C." ...|$|E
