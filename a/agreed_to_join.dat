5|$|An opium-addicted British soldier {{named after}} his {{signature}} weapon. The character was partly inspired by RZA's late cousin Ol' Dirty Bastard. Crowe based his performance on Clint Eastwood in Dirty Harry (1971) and The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976). Crowe <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> the cast {{because of his}} previous working relationship with RZA. Crowe was only able to spend 10 days filming his scenes.|$|E

Crofts was later {{confirmed}} as permanent captain {{at the beginning of}} January 2010.|$|E
5|$|Such was his {{influence}} that Mertens was named new club captain for the 2008–09 Eerste Divisie season. Mertens excelled {{in his new}} role and contributed a further 13 goals for the season which contributed to him being awarded the Golden Bull award for the most talented player in the Eerste Divisie. It {{would be his last}} season with the club, however, as {{at the end of the}} season he <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> Eredivisie side Utrecht. Mertens made 110 appearances across all competitions for AGOVV during his three seasons at the club and netted 31 goals.|$|E
5|$|The Banu Nadir began rousing the nomads of Najd. The Nadir {{enlisted the}} Banu Ghatafan by paying them {{half of their}} harvest. This contingent, the second largest, added a {{strength}} of about 2,000 men and 300 horsemen led by Unaina bin Hasan Fazari. The Bani Assad also <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>join,</b> led by Tuleha Asadi. From the Banu Sulaym, the Nadir secured 700 men, though this force would likely have been much larger had not some of its leaders been sympathetic towards Islam.

5|$|The spell in Turkey, however, {{proved to}} be an unhappy time for Babangida and the Ankara side chose no to pursue their {{interest}} in the player once the loan deal expired. Looking for a move away from Netherlands, Babangida came close to signing with AJ Auxerre, but received a last-minute call from Ronald Koeman and <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> him at Vitesse instead. Another loan move followed. First team player under Koeman, Babangida subsequently lost his place in the starting line-up, when Ronald Koeman left for Ajax and was replaced by Edward Sturing.|$|E
5|$|While {{he was in}} the Army, he {{received}} a package from Paul Brown, the Ohio State football coach. It contained footballs and a contract for him to sign to play on a team Brown was coaching in the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC). He signed the contract in May 1945 and <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> the team, called the Cleveland Browns, after the war ended in 1946. Groza got $500 a month stipend {{until the end of the}} war and a $7,500 annual salary.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there was}} some fear of Rome and concern with her methods, the {{coalition}} arrayed against Philip continued to grow. As allowed for by the treaty, Pergamon, Elis and Messenia, followed by Sparta, all <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> the alliance against Macedon. The Roman fleet, together with the Pergamene fleet, controlled the sea, and Macedon and her allies were threatened on land {{by the rest of}} the coalition. The Roman strategy of encumbering Philip with a war among Greeks in Greece was succeeding, so much so that when Laevinus went to Rome to take up his consulship, he was able to report that the legion deployed against Philip could be safely withdrawn.|$|E

5|$|In Taylor's view, {{the best}} way forward was to admit California as a state rather than a federal territory, as it would leave the slavery {{question}} out of Congress's hands. The timing for statehood was in Taylor's favor, as the Gold Rush was well underway {{at the time of}} his inauguration, and California's population was exploding. The administration dispatched Rep. Thomas Butler King to California, to test the waters and advocate on behalf of statehood, knowing that the Californians were certain to adopt an anti-slavery constitution. King found that a constitutional convention was already underway, and by October 1849, the convention unanimously <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> the Union—and to ban slavery within their borders.|$|E
5|$|In either 469 or 466 BC, the Persians began {{assembling}} a large army and navy {{for a major}} offensive against the Greeks. Gathering near the Eurymedon, {{it is possible that}} the expedition aimed to move up the coast of Asia Minor, capturing each city in turn. This would bring the Asiatic Greek regions back under Persian control, and give the Persians naval bases from which to launch further expeditions into the Aegean. Hearing of the Persian preparations, the Athenian general Cimon took 200 triremes and sailed to Phaselis in Pamphylia, which eventually <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> the Delian League. This effectively blocked the Persian strategy at its first objective.|$|E
5|$|Kohli {{had been}} in discussions with Chopra for a {{different}} project before, which would have paired her with Saif Ali Khan. At that time, Khan and Chopra {{had been asked to}} star together in a number of films, including 2 States, Cocktail, Race 2 and Vishal Bhardwaj's Dreams. Siddharth Anand's adaptation of 2 States would film {{at the same time as}} Kohli's proposed film. Anand and Kohli met and agreed that Chopra would act in 2 States. Later, Kohli approached Chopra with a new script, and she <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> the cast for Teri Meri Kahaani. Prachi Desai and Neha Sharma were cast to play Kapoor's love interests in the 1960s and 2012, respectively.|$|E

5|$|While at the hotel, Hendrix {{made several}} {{telephone}} calls. Dannemann said he phoned his lawyer Henry Steingarten, {{asking him to}} find a way out of his contract with his manager Mike Jeffery, and producer Eddie Kramer, for whom Hendrix left a voice message. Mitch Mitchell said that he called Hendrix at the Cumberland on September 17, after having been asked to do so by tour manager Gerry Stickells, who had spoken to Hendrix just minutes earlier. Mitchell said that during the phone conversation Hendrix <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> him around midnight at the Speakeasy Club for a previously arranged jam session, which included Sly Stone.|$|E
5|$|At that meeting, held at Bulldogs owner Ralph Hay's Hupmobile {{showroom}} in Canton, Ohio, {{representatives of}} the Rock Island Independents, the Muncie Flyers, the Decatur Staleys, the Racine Cardinals, the Massillon Tigers, the Chicago Tigers, and the Hammond Pros <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> the league. Representatives of the Buffalo All-Americans and Rochester Jeffersons could not attend the meeting, but sent letters to Hay asking {{to be included in}} the league. Team representatives changed the league's name slightly to the American Professional Football Association and elected officers, installing Thorpe as president, Cofall as vice-president, Ranney as secretary-treasurer. Under the new league structure, teams created their schedules dynamically as the season progressed, so there were no minimum or maximum number of games needed to be played. Also, representatives of each team voted to determine the winner of the APFA trophy.|$|E

5|$|Barcelona were {{expected}} to line up in a 4–2–3–1 formation, with Ronaldinho, Ludovic Giuly and Deco supporting Samuel Eto'o who would be deployed as the lone striker. They had doubts about the fitness of Lionel Messi going into the final. He had pulled a thigh muscle during the second leg of their match with Chelsea, and had not played since, though he {{was included in the}} 22 man squad for the final. Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard stated he would leave it late before deciding whether to select him. Despite being included in the squad Messi did not feature in the final. Arsenal {{were expected}} to line up in a 4–5–1 formation, with Thierry Henry as the sole striker. There was much discussion about whether José Antonio Reyes would take the place of Robert Pirès on the left of midfield. It had been announced before the match that this would be Pirès' last match as he had <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> Villarreal next season.|$|E
