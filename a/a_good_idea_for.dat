5|$|Director Pete Docter {{first began}} writing Up in 2004. The fantasy of a flying house was {{developed}} {{on the idea}} of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating, which stemmed from his difficulty with social situations growing up. Actor and writer Tom McCarthy aided Docter and Bob Peterson in shaping the story for about three months. Docter selected an old man for the main character after drawing a picture of a grumpy old man with smiling balloons. The two men thought that an old man was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> a protagonist because they felt that their experiences and the way that they affect their view of the world was a rich source of humor. Docter was not concerned with an elderly protagonist, stating that children would relate to Carl {{in the way that they}} relate to their grandparents.|$|E

Kantor said that {{as he entered the}} hospital, at about 1:30 pm, he felt a tug on his coat. He turned around to see Jack Ruby who called him by his first name and shook his hand; {{he said that he had}} become acquainted with Ruby while he was a reporter for the Dallas Times Herald newspaper. According to Kantor, Ruby asked him if he thought that it would be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> him to close his nightclubs for the next three nights because of the tragedy and Kantor responded with thinking that doing so would be a good idea.|$|E

[...] They were unimpressed with the title track, suggesting that [...] "whoever {{decided it would be}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> Meat Loaf to tackle nu metal…should be tarred and feathered."

He flew in the lead plane, B-17 #41-24458, nicknamed [...] "San Antonio Rose I", from the 64th Bombardment Squadron, 43rd Bombardment Group, which was piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Jack W. Bleasdale, the group's executive officer. The 64th Bombardment Squadron's commanding officer, Major Allen Lindberg was also on board. The briefing officer for the mission, Major David Hassemer, did not think that it was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> so many senior officers to fly in the same plane, but his objection was overruled.|$|E

[...] "It was decided that it would be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> me to record some of my own stuff... partly to stop me moaning about the Yardbirds", Beck recalled. [...] Also, the Yardbirds' management was encouraging individual band members to bring attention to the band through success in solo projects. Studio time was booked for May 1966 at the IBC Studios in London. [...] To prepare for the session, Beck called on long-time friend and studio guitarist Jimmy Page, who had recommended Beck as Eric Clapton's replacement in the Yardbirds, to work up some ideas for songs to record.|$|E

[...] To combat this issue, Minear decided to make the remote viewer blind. He sought to make the blind woman [...] "not Audrey Hepburn", a reference to the 1967 film Wait Until Dark, in which Hepburn played the part of an innocent but terrorized blind woman. He later said, [...] "I wanted to make [...] a bitch, because the fact is that disability doesn't necessarily ennoble a person." [...] After several meetings with fellow writers John Shiban, Vince Gilligan, and Frank Spotnitz—who provided storyboard support—Minear was allowed to begin work on the episode.|$|E

500|$|Filming for {{the season}} began on August 31, and ended on December 19, 2015, with Edward J. Pei serving as {{director}} of photography. Unlike the first season, episodes were filmed concurrently, two at a time. Discussing the series' location move, Head of Marvel Television Jeph Loeb explained that [...] "Agent Carter season one took place in New York in 1946. It wasn't like {{we could go to}} New York and find 1946, so we shot in L.A. But that's {{part of the reason that}} when we talked about it, we said, 'You know what? This season let's stay in L.A.' Because so much of L.A. still looks like it did in 1946." [...] Butters expanded by saying the move to L.A. [...] "was something we had talked about in the middle of the first season... we realized that not only was it <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> the storytelling, but also...it's much easier for us to shoot L.A. for L.A. than try to shoot L.A. for New York." [...] She added the season hoped to film at Musso & Frank Grill, the Formosa Cafe, the Griffith Observatory, racetracks, piers, and other locations in Downtown Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|In March 1974, Lennon began {{producing}} Harry Nilsson's Pussy Cats album, thus {{named to}} counter the [...] "bad boy" [...] image the pair had earned in the media with two drinking incidents at The Troubadour: the first when Lennon placed a Kotex on his forehead and scuffled with a waitress at a concert given by Ann Peebles, {{who at the time}} had released one of Lennon's favorite records, 'I Can't Stand The Rain' and, two weeks later, when Lennon and Nilsson were ejected from the same club after heckling the Smothers Brothers. Lennon thought it would be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> the musicians to live under one roof to ensure they would get to the studio on time, so Pang rented a beach house in Santa Monica, for her, Lennon, Nilsson, Ringo Starr and Keith Moon to live in. At this time, Pang encouraged Lennon to reach out to family and friends. He and Paul McCartney mended fences and played together for the first and only time after the breakup of The Beatles (see A Toot and a Snore in '74). Pang also arranged for Julian Lennon to visit his father {{for the first time in}} almost four years.|$|E

500|$|... "Footprints in the Sand" [...] {{was written}} by Simon Cowell, David Kreuger, Per Magnusson and Richard Page, whilst the {{production}} was helmed by Steve Mac. It was recorded in 2007 at Rokstone Studios in London, England. Cowell originally {{came up with the}} idea to base a song around the Christian poem [...] "Footprints", and suggested it to Kreuger and Magnusson. They had a scheduled session in Page's home in Malibu, California and finished the song the next day. Cowell secured a songwriting credit for coming up with the idea. In an interview with HitQuarters, Magnusson said they had thought the song would be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> Irish boy band Westlife, but it was offered to British singer Leona Lewis instead. When Cowell mentioned the song concept to Lewis, she agreed that it could be [...] "really quite interesting". Regarding the song, Lewis commented: [...] "Originally it was a poem; it's very inspirational so we put it into a song.

500|$|Mughal-e-Azam {{became the}} first {{full-length}} feature film colourised for a theatrical re-release; although some Hollywood films had been colourised earlier, they were only available for home media. It was subsequently selected for seven international film festivals. Upon release, the film drew crowds to the cinemas, with an overall occupancy of 90 per cent. Subsequently, it completed a 25-week run. While some critics complained that the colours were [...] "psychedelic" [...] or [...] "unnatural", others hailed the effort as a technological achievement. Film critic Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times remarked that while colourising was not <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> most black-and-white classics, it was perfect in this particular instance. He compared it to films by Cecil B. DeMille and to Gone With the Wind (1939) for its larger-than-life storytelling. The Guardian said that although the new version was an improvement, [...] "the fake colours tend to look flat and brash, detracting from cinematographer RD Mathur's elegantly composed shots." [...] The BBC's Jaspreet Pandohar, observing that the film was [...] "restored in appealing candy-colours and high quality sound", considered it a [...] "cross between Gone With the Wind and Ben-Hur". Other critics {{have said that they}} prefer the black and white version.|$|E
500|$|A link {{developed}} during the war with the King's Royal Rifle Corps (KRRC), whose Southern Rhodesian contingent—numbering a few hundred, chiefly in its 2nd and 3rd Battalions—was the largest on the Western Front. The connection with this particular corps began {{as the result of}} a chance conversation aboard the ship that took the first batch of Southern Rhodesians from Cape Town to Southampton in late 1914. The 16th Marquess of Winchester, who had links with Rhodesia dating back to the 1890s, was also aboard the ship, returning from a visit to the colony. Encountering Captain John Banks Brady, the officer of Irish origin who led the volunteers, the Marquess asked where his party was headed. Brady enthusiastically replied that they were going to war together in France. The Marquess suggested to Brady that since it might be difficult to prevent his men from being split up during the enlistment process, it might be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> the Rhodesians to join the KRRC, where he could keep an eye on them through his connections with the Winchester-based regiment. The Southern Rhodesian contingent duly mustered into the KRRC.

[...] Julie Salamon of The Wall Street Journal wrote that the film as [...] "an edgy, intelligent script by playwright Tom Stoppard, Spielberg has made an extraordinary film out of Mr. Ballard's extraordinary war experience." [...] J. Hoberman from The Village Voice decried that the serious subject was undermined by Spielberg's [...] "shamelessly kiddiecentric" [...] approach. Roger Ebert gave a mixed reaction, [...] "Despite the emotional potential in the story, it didn't much move me. Maybe, like the kid, I decided that no world where you can play with airplanes can be all that bad." [...] On his TV show with Gene Siskel, Ebert said that the film [...] "is basically <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> a film that never gets off the ground." [...] Siskel added, [...] "I don't know what the film is about. It's so totally confused and taking things from different parts. On one hand, {{if it wants to}} say something about a child's-eye view of war, you got a movie made by John Boorman called Hope and Glory that was just released that is much better, and much more daring in showing the whimsy that children's view of war is.
