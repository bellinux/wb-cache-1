Environmental samples were screened to isolate effective yeast producers of <b>arabitol.</b> The most promising isolate 27 RL- 4, obtained from raspberry leaves, was identified genetically and biochemically as Candida parapsilosis. It secreted 10. 42 – 10. 72 g l- 1 of product from 20 g l- 1 of L-arabinose with a yield of 0. 51 - 0. 53 g g- 1 at 28 °C and a rotational speed of 150 rpm. Batch cultures showed that optimal pH value for <b>arabitol</b> production was 5. 5. High yields and productivities of <b>arabitol</b> were obtained during incubation of the yeast at 200 rpm, or at 32 °C, but the concentrations of the polyol did not exceed 10 g l- 1. In modified medium, with reduced amounts of nitrogen compounds and pH 5. 5 - 6. 5, lower yeast biomass produced a similar concentration of <b>arabitol,</b> suggesting higher efficiency of yeast cells.

40|$|A non-targeted {{metabolomics}} {{approach was}} used to identify significant changes in metabolism upon exposure of the wheat pathogen Stagonospora nodorum to 0. 5 M NaCl.

Amino acid synthesis was strongly down-regulated whilst mannitol levels were unaffected. A reverse genetic approach was undertaken to dissect the role of <b>arabitol</b> metabolism during salt stress. Strains of S. nodorum lacking a gene encoding an l-arabitol dehydrogenase (abd 1), a xylitol dehydrogenase (xdh 1) and a double-mutant lacking both genes (abd 1 xdh 1) were exposed to salt and the intracellular metabolites analysed. <b>Arabitol</b> levels were significantly up-regulated upon salt stress in the xdh 1 strains but were significantly lower than the wild-type. <b>Arabitol</b> was not significantly different in either the abd 1 or the abd 1 xdh 1 strains during osmotic stress but the concentration of glycerol was significantly higher indicating a compensatory mechanism in operation.

30|$|After {{selecting}} the appropriate ranges of medium components, {{the production of}} ethanol and <b>arabitol</b> was scaled up to 2.5 L bioreactor and the optimum aeration/agitation conditions were established. Oxygen {{is one of the}} important substrates for microbial metabolism. There were many reports indicating the necessity of adequate supply of oxygen for polyol production (Petrson et al. 1958; Hajny 1964; Escalante et al. 1990; Saha et al. 2007; Toyoda and Ohtaguchi 2011). In the present study, production of ethanol and <b>arabitol</b> was found to be maximum at lower rates of aeration and agitation. Drastic reduction of product yields and high biomass were observed when aeration was increased to 1 vvm. This could be due to the Pasteur effect, as indicated by Petrson et al. (1958) where higher levels of oxygen reduce the rate of fermentation. Several reports indicated that low levels of aeration and agitation are optimal for <b>arabitol</b> production (Petrson et al. 1958; Fonseca et al. 2007; Saha et al. 2007). Saha et al. (2007) studied the production of <b>arabitol</b> by Z. rouxii under different agitation rates and found that low agitation rates in the range 350 – 450 rpm were most conducive. But, in contrast to the above observation, Escalante et al. (1990) reported an increase in <b>arabitol</b> yield with increasing aeration and agitation speed. The partial anaerobic environment created by reduced agitation speed and low aeration rates resulted in maximum ethanol yield. When the initial substrate concentration was increased, the production of both ethanol and <b>arabitol</b> also increased. The increase in <b>arabitol</b> yield {{can be attributed to the}} osmotic stress caused by high sugar concentration. This is in agreement with earlier published report where D. nepalensis produced <b>arabitol</b> as a compatible solute along with glycerol to overcome hyperosmotic stress (Kumar and Gummadi 2011). This result also corresponds to the observations made by Morant et al. that <b>arabitol</b> production increased when Z. rouxii was cultivated in the presence of high glucose concentrations (Morant and Witter 1979). Similarly, Brown (1974) reported that the amount of <b>arabitol</b> produced by Saccharomyces rouxii was influenced by the solute concentration of the medium in which the organism was cultivated. But, in the case of Hansenula polymorpha, there was a reduction in <b>arabitol</b> production with increasing osmotic pressure (Escalante et al. 1990).|$|E
30|$|It was {{previously}} reported that D. nepalensis produces <b>arabitol</b> and ethanol when grown on glucose (Kumar and Gummadi 2011). The present study focuses on understanding {{the effect of}} various process parameters on product formation, with subsequent development of suitable medium {{for the production of}} both ethanol and <b>arabitol</b> using glucose as carbon source. Studies on the production of <b>arabitol</b> and ethanol by D. nepalensis in the presence of different carbon substrates indicated that fructose and glucose were favourable for ethanol production. Shafaghat et al. (2009) have studied the effect of glucose, fructose and sucrose on the growth and ethanol productivity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae PTCC 24860 and observed similar results. The fermentation performance of the organism was found to be better when fructose was used as carbon source (Shafaghat et al. 2009). Arabinose, followed by glucose, were found to be more favourable carbon sources for <b>arabitol</b> production, the yield being greater (0.29 g/g) with arabinose. Similarly, Ahmed (2001) has shown that glucose was the suitable carbon source for bioconversion to <b>arabitol</b> by Candida famata R 28. Nobre and Da Costa (1985) have also shown that <b>arabitol</b> production was better in medium containing arabinose and glucose. In contrast to the above observation, Metschnikowia reukaufii AJ 14787 was unable to convert arabinose to <b>arabitol</b> (Nozaki et al. 2003). D. nepalensis was found to utilize glycerol only for the formation of biomass. On the contrary, Koganti et al. have reported the production of <b>arabitol</b> using glycerol as carbon source by Debaryomyces hansenii NRRL Y- 7483 (Koganti et al. 2011). Based on experimental findings and comparison with literature suggest that there exists unique metabolism in D. nepalensis for concomitant production of ethanol and <b>arabitol.</b> Using glucose as carbon source and at pH 6.0 a final concentration of 12 g/L of ethanol was achieved. A similar pH range of 4 – 6 was shown to be optimal for ethanol production by Kluyveromyces marxianus (Bajpai and Margaritis 1987) and Zymomonas mobilis (Lawford et al. 1988). <b>Arabitol</b> production was also maximum at pH 6.0 (Saha et al. 2007; Zhu et al. 2010).|$|E

The concentrations of ribitol, <b>arabitol,</b> and mannitol were measured, using gas chromatography, in the central areolae and marginal hypothallus of the crustose lichen Rhizocarpon geographicum (L.)

The concentration of an individual carbohydrate in the prothallus was correlated primarily with the concentrations of the other carbohydrates in the prothallus and not to their concentrations in the areolae. Low concentration of ribitol, <b>arabitol,</b> and mannitol in the marginal prothallus compared with the central areolae suggests either a lower demand for carbohydrate by the prothallus or limited transport from areolae to prothallus and may explain the low growth rates of this species.

The use of biomarkers as tool for the determination of fungal and bacterial contribute to bioaerosol has been often suggested. In this study ergosterol, <b>arabitol</b> and mannitol have been associated to fungal spores, muramic acid has been associated to bacteria and dipicolinic acid has been associated to bacterial spores, as tracers. In the present work, a new analytical chemical method for the determination of this biomarkers was developed and fungal and bacterial component of aerosol was studied in suburban/rural and in urban sites. Ergosterol, <b>arabitol,</b> mannitol, muramic acid and dipicolinic acid content in airborne particulate matter, even at different sizes, was determined.

30|$|<b>Arabitol,</b> a pentitol {{that exists}} in both D and L forms, is sweet, colourless, {{crystalline}} and soluble in water with potential applications in food and pharmaceutical industries.

Lobes were collected from a north and a south facing slate rock surface in South Gwynedd, Wales, U. K. on 4 days during 1990 - 1991. On each day sampled, the most significant variation in soluble carbohydrate levels was between the individual lobes of a thallus. In addition, carbohydrate levels were significantly greater on the south facing rock surface on 2 of the 4 days sampled. Factorial analyses of variance suggested that the levels of individual carbohydrates varied significantly between days but not {{between north and south}} facing rock surfaces. Mannitol levels varied less between days than <b>arabitol</b> levels. Levels of ribitol, <b>arabitol</b> and mannitol were positively correlated in individual lobes. A stepwise multiple regression suggested that on the north facing rock surface, <b>arabitol</b> and mannitol levels could be explained by variations in the level of ribitol. By contrast, on the south facing rock surface, the levels of fungal carbohydrates were less dependent on the level of ribitol and there was evidence of a relationship between <b>arabitol</b> and mannitol. Variations in carbohydrate production, allocation and metabolism could help to explain lobe growth variation in foliose lichens and the radial growth of lobes {{over a longer period of}} time.

30|$|An {{increase}} in the concentration of nitrogen in the medium has {{a positive effect on}} ethanol and <b>arabitol</b> production. In the present study, the yield of both ethanol and <b>arabitol</b> increased with increasing nitrogen concentration (or decreasing C/N ratio).

But when the nitrogen concentration was further increased to 9 g/L, ethanol yield was reduced drastically to 0.09 g/g and there was a significant reduction in the percentage of glucose consumed (40 % of the total glucose). Similar observation on the effect of nitrogen source was made by Abd-Aziz et al. (2001) on ethanol production by recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae YKU 131. It was also reported that decreasing C/N ratio resulted in poor ethanol yield (Manikandan and Viruthagiri 2010).

By increasing the concentration of these additives a decrease in both the denaturation enthalpy (ΔdH) and temperature of the maximum of the denaturation peak (Tmax) of DNA is observed.

The particular behaviour of l(−) <b>arabitol,</b> which showed a much greater destabilizing ability compared to the other polyols, was further investigated and attributed to a direct more effective interaction with the double helix of DNA.

The influence of reaction parameters on the conversion has been investigated, including reaction time, temperature, alcohol/acid molar ratio, and enzyme amount. The highest conversions (94 % for xylitol, 98 % for <b>arabitol,</b> 80 % for mannitol, and 93 % for sorbitol) were obtained in pure tert-butanol at 60 °C and 72 h reaction time, 0. 3 alcohol/acid molar ratio, and 0. 5 g/mol enzyme/substrate ratio. The isolated new sugar alcohols esters were identified by different spectral analyses. MALDI-TOF MS analysis showed the formation of monoesters, diesters, and small quantities of triesters for all investigated sugar alcohols. The catalytic efficiency of the enzyme was higher for the pentitol substrates, decreasing in the following order: <b>arabitol</b> > xylitol > sorbitol > mannitol. These new compounds could have interesting applications in food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic formulation...|$|E
40|$|Fungal spores are the {{dominant}} biological component of air. Although ubiquitous in outdoor air, they are scarcely measured {{due to the}} inadequacy of measurement methods. The use of biomarkers as tools for the determination of fungal contribution to bioaerosol has often been suggested, and ergosterol, <b>arabitol</b> and mannitol have been associated to fungal spores as tracers. In the present paper, the fungal component of aerosol was studied at suburban/rural and at urban sites. Ergosterol, <b>arabitol,</b> and mannitol contents in airborne particulate matter, even at different sizes, were determined. Literature conversion factors and calculated conversion factors correlating ergosterol, <b>arabitol,</b> and mannitol masses to fungi mass were applied and compared to each other. The obtained fungal spore concentrations were different depending on the marker utilized both with the conversion factors found in literature and the calculated ones. Size-segregated marker distribution suggested different sources for the three tracers indicating ergosterol as the only reliable biomarker at our latitudes. The fungal spore concentrations were higher at the suburban/rural location and respectively inversely and directly proportional to temperature and relative humidity. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
