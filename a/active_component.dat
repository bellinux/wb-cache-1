40|$|Supercritical {{impregnation}} {{is one of}} {{the novel}} technologies exploited for incorporation of <b>active</b> <b>components</b> into packaging material.

The major advantages of using supercritical carbon dioxide as a solvent rely on the possibility to operate under mild temperature and so to process with thermo-sensitive <b>active</b> <b>components.</b> This technique permits the impregnation of diverse natural and synthetic polymers which is the main advantage of this process.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} effects of the <b>active</b> <b>components</b> of Xiaoxuming Decoction (XXM), a {{compound}} traditional Chinese herbal medicine, on chronic cerebral ischemia in rats. METHODS: Chronic cerebral ischemia was induced in rats by occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries. Then, the rats with chronic cerebral ischemia were randomly divided into five groups: model group, extract of Ginkgo biloba group and low-, medium- and high-dose <b>active</b> <b>components</b> of XXM groups. Another 11 rats without occlusion of common carotid arteries were used as the sham-operation group. Memory behavior was investigated by Morris water maze test. The structure of hippocampus and cortex neurons was observed with Nissel staining. The white matter lesion was stained with Klüver-Barrera stain method to observe the pathological changes. The astrocyte activation was observed using immunohistochemical method with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibody. RESULTS: The <b>active</b> <b>components</b> of XXM could significantly improve the impairment of learning and memory induced by chronic cerebral ischemia in rats. Compared with the model group, the time to reach the platform for rats was shortened by treating with the <b>active</b> <b>components</b> of XXM in Morris water maze test, particularly in the medium-dose group (P< 0. 05). In addition, the low- and medium-dose <b>active</b> <b>components</b> of XXM improved the decrease of cerebrovascular reactivity induced by chronic cerebral ischemia. The results of the pathological analysis also suggested that the <b>active</b> <b>components</b> of XXM could ameliorate the pathological damage induced by chronic cerebral ischemia in rats with the number of neurons increased, and the morphology and distribution of neurons recovered to normal levels. The low-dose <b>active</b> <b>components</b> of XXM significantly reduced the white matter lesions (P< 0. 05, P< 0. 01). <b>Active</b> <b>components</b> of XXM treatment could also reduce the activation of astrocytes. CONCLUSION: The <b>active</b> <b>components</b> of XXM may attenuate the chronic cerebral ischemic injury in rats...|$|R

5|$|The major {{commercial}} {{application of}} samarium is in samarium–cobalt magnets, which have permanent magnetization {{second only to}} neodymium magnets; however, samarium compounds can withstand significantly higher temperatures, above , without losing their magnetic properties, due to the alloy's higher Curie point.

Another isotope, samarium-149, is a strong neutron absorber and is therefore added to the control rods of nuclear reactors.

Other applications of samarium include catalysis of chemical reactions, radioactive dating and an X-ray laser.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1990, the U.S. {{intervened in}} the Middle East with Operation Desert Storm. During that intervention, Fort Lewis {{deployed}} 34 active and 25 reserve component units to Saudi Arabia.

Norman Schwarzkopf, the Commander of the American Forces. I Corps expanded its contingency missions and became a quick-response corps. For several months, I Corps was the nation's worldwide contingency corps, while the XVIII Airborne Corps was engaged in the Gulf War. This caused a good deal of activity on Fort Lewis, as the post restructured itself to support the corps' new mission, and to insure that it had a smooth, rapid departure in case they were needed anywhere in the world. This duty was returned to XVIII Airborne Corps upon its return to the United States. The corps then began to convert to a permanently structured, no-mobilization contingency corps and was placed under the operational control of the United States Army Forces Command.

5|$|The US Department of Defense {{issued its}} Quadrennial Defense Review on 6 February 2006.

This would include a large increase of the <b>active</b> <b>component</b> civil affairs, {{which at the time}} consisted of only the 96th Civil Affairs Battalion, commanding six company sized units assigned to the major regional commands of the US Army. The decision was made to form a brigade-sized civil affairs unit to act as a command element for the only four active duty battalion sized civil affairs units operating for the active duty US Army. This move would allow the brigade to more quickly prepare its subordinate units for rapid deployment in support of Army contingencies in order to provide tactical support to other Army units.

Cultivated Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fischer are the main source of licorice at present, but the content of main <b>active</b> <b>components</b> in cultivated G. uralensis are lower than in wild G. uralensis. Therefore, the production of high-quality cultivated G. uralensis is an urgent issue for the research and production fields. In this study, the content of five <b>active</b> <b>components</b> and seven endogenous phytohormones in cultivated G. uralensis (two-year-old) were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Furthermore, different concentrations (25 – 200 mg/L) of exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) were sprayed on the leaves of G. uralensis in the fast growing period. Results showed that ABA, zeatin riboside (ZR), and dihydrozeatin riboside (DHZR) had strong correlation with <b>active</b> <b>components.</b> In addition, the content of five <b>active</b> <b>components</b> increased remarkably after ABA treatment.
