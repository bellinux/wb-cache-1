5000|$|Designer / Manufacturer: Slingsby <b>Amphibious</b> <b>Hovercraft</b> Company ...|$|E
5000|$|The Slingsby SAH 2200 {{hovercraft}} {{is a small}} military hovercraft {{produced by}} Slingsby <b>Amphibious</b> <b>Hovercraft</b> Company of Kirkbymoorside, England, and used by the Finnish Border Guard.|$|E
5000|$|Developed and {{implemented}} {{the practice of}} the resonance method of ice destruction, implemented by the courts <b>amphibious</b> <b>hovercraft</b> that can many times lower power compared to conventional technologies (application crust of ice crystals, ice-breaker boxes, etc.) ...|$|E
50|$|Marine units {{primarily}} deploy from warships using boats, landing craft, <b>hovercraft,</b> <b>amphibious</b> vehicles or helicopters. Specialist {{units are}} also trained in combat diving/combat swimming and parachuting.|$|R
5000|$|The 75 new {{units that}} the {{expansion}} pack comes with include: seaplanes capable of landing underwater, aqueous metal deposits and structures (such as the floating [...] "Naval-Series" [...] heavy laser turrets and missile turrets), <b>hovercraft,</b> <b>amphibious</b> Kbots, pop-up turrets, and rapid-fire plasma cannons, among many others.|$|R
50|$|Boats and <b>amphibious</b> aircraft, <b>hovercraft,</b> or {{helicopter}} are {{the only}} means of transportation into and out of Akutan. A 200 ft dock and a small boat mooring basin are available. Plans are underway to develop a practical way to get to a large boat harbor that has been built {{at the head of the}} bay. The State Ferry operates from Kodiak bi-monthly between May and October. Cargo is delivered weekly by freighter from Seattle; the City owns and operates a landing craft, the M/V Akutan. Akutan has no airstrip due to the steep terrain, however, a seaplane base is available and open to the public. Helicopter service between Akutan and Akun Island, the location of Akutan Airport, began in February 2014. The only airline company serving the airport is Grant Aviation, flying to nearby Dutch Harbor. The airport was expected to cost $77 million of which nearly $60 million came from the U.S. federal government. Trident paid $1 million towards the cost of the airport.|$|R
50|$|The Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) in British {{service is}} a small <b>amphibious</b> <b>hovercraft</b> able to {{transverse}} both land and water. Like all amphibious landing craft in the Royal Navy, they are operated by the Royal Marines to transport troops or equipment from ship to shore during an amphibious landing.|$|E
50|$|These are {{three-dimensional}} oscillations {{of forces}} which occur within a disturbed liquid {{and are usually}} observed as surface waves. There have been cases of destruction of ice by flexural gravity waves (FGW) produced by moving cars, trains on railway crossings, aircraft during takeoff and landing, etc. However, at present the most appropriate vehicles for implementation of the method are <b>amphibious</b> <b>hovercraft,</b> also known as air cushion vehicles (ACV).|$|E
50|$|The KCG has its {{headquarters}} in Songdodong, Incheon, and has hundreds of smaller operating stations along the coastline of the Korean Peninsula. It operates 4 classes of heavy vessels (over 1000 tons), 3 classes of medium vessels (over 250 tons), and 3 classes of light vessels (speedboats over 30 tons). The KCG also uses several types of 'special purpose watercraft', such as firefighting vessels, barges, high speed scout boats, light patrols, and <b>amphibious</b> <b>hovercraft.</b> The KCG aviation unit fields 6 fixed-wing aircraft and 16 rotary-wing aircraft. The Coast Guard also had its own asymmetric warfare unit, the 'Korean Coast Guard Special Operation Unit'.|$|E
40|$|An attempt {{has been}} made to provide a better {{understanding}} of the influence of aerodynamic characteristics on the handling qualities of <b>amphibious</b> <b>hovercraft.</b> This is the third and final report of a series of three reports in which the following have been explored. i) Aerodynamic characteristics of related hovercraft shapes; ii) the effect of cushion efflux on external aerodynamic characteristics, and finally; iii) the effects of lift-system airflow and the location of induction ports on the aerodynamic characteristics of hovercraft hulls. It has been established that no major effects of consequence exist, yet at the same time, certain measures can be taken during the design stages of hulls, skirts and induction ports that will minimize inherent adverse characteristics...|$|E
40|$|A first {{generation}} of commercial <b>amphibious</b> <b>hovercraft</b> has now been operating on a scheduled basis with revenue payloads on relatively-short over-water routes. On some of these routes, open-sea conditions prevail. By and large, the degree of success attained during these operations has been encouraging. However, certain problem areas {{have been brought to}} light, one or the most important being concerned with handling qualities. As in the case of aircraft, the handling qualities of hovercraft depend heavily on stability and control characteristics. In this case, however, the problem is rather more complex being dependent on aerodynamic, hydrodynamic, and air-cushion effects. There are also important interference effects at the aero-hydro- interface. To understand the overall handling problem, each of these contributory effects must be isolated from the others, so that individual study from a stability and control viewpoint can be attempted. The task of isolation is difficult. It does not fall within the scope of full-scale testing, neither is it amenable to analysis except possibly in the case of air-cushion effects where good progress has been made using mathematical analysis. Thus it becomes essential that to study the aerodynamic and hydrodynamic effects, recourse be made to experimental testing. The National Physical Laboratory at Feltham has provided most of the effort in hydrodynamic experimentation, and the Cranfield Institute of Technology (formerly known as the College of Aeronautics) has complemented this work by undertaking the aerodynamic experimentation...|$|E
