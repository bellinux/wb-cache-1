5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>closed</b> {{immersion}} is finite and radicial (universally injective). In particular, <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> immersion {{is universally}} <b>closed.</b> <b>A</b> <b>closed</b> immersion is stable under base change and composition.

5|$|Also {{called the}} Malagasy pygmy hippopotamus, this species was {{originally}} classified as Hippopotamus along with H. lemerlei, {{and indeed the}} two species were roughly the same size.

5|$|DNA {{studies have}} {{identified}} close genetic relationships between Limousin cattle and other south-west European breeds. One study reported a possible common origin or recent gene flow between the Limousin and Charolais cattle breeds. whereas other studies indicated that <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> genetic relationship exists between Limousin, Gasconne, Aubrac, Bazadais, Salers, and Blonde d'Aquitaine cattle.|$|E
5|$|A 1992 phylogenetic {{study of}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA sequences showed a strong {{possibility of a}} clade consisting of Boselaphini, Bovini and Tragelaphini. Bovini consists of the genera Bubalus, Bos, Pseudoryx (saola), Syncerus (African Buffalo), Bison and the extinct Pelorovis. Tragelaphini consists of two genera: Taurotragus (eland) and Tragelaphus. <b>A</b> <b>closer</b> relationship between Boselaphini and Tragelaphini was predicted, and seconded by a similar study in 1999.|$|E
40|$|We {{prove the}} {{existence}} of <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> regularization of the integration current associated to an effective analytic cycle, with a bounded negative part. By means of the King formula, we are reduced to regularize <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> differential form with L 1 loc coefficients, which by extension has a test value on any positive current with the same support as the cycle. As a consequence, the restriction of <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> positive current to <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> analytic submanifold is well defined as <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> positive current. Lastly, given <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> smooth differential (qʹ, qʹ) -form on <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> analytic submanifold, we prove {{the existence of}} <b>a</b> <b>closed</b> (qʹ, qʹ) -current having a restriction equal to that differential form.

5|$|As had {{occurred}} with Bilheimer's previous film, <b>A</b> <b>Closer</b> Walk, Not My Life had several preview screenings before its official release.

5|$|Collaborations was {{presented}} in an unusually lavish package, designed by Drew Lorimer and Olivia Harrison.

5|$|In {{the early}} years of James's reign, the day-to-day running of the {{government}} was tightly managed by the shrewd Cecil, later Earl of Salisbury, ably assisted by the experienced Thomas Egerton, whom James made Baron Ellesmere and Lord Chancellor, and by Thomas Sackville, soon Earl of Dorset, who continued as Lord Treasurer. As a consequence, James was free to concentrate on bigger issues, such as a scheme for <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> union between England and Scotland and matters of foreign policy, as well as to enjoy his leisure pursuits, particularly hunting.|$|E

5|$|Riley {{returned}} {{to live near}} Indianapolis later in 1893, boarding in a private home in the Lockerbie district, then a small suburb. He developed a close friendship with his landlords, the Nickum and Holstein families.

Riley's friends frequently visited his home, and he developed <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> relationship with Eugene Debs.|$|E
5|$|Rivera's 2008 {{season was}} one of his best {{individual}} years. Along with a 1.40ERA and 39saves in 40opportunities, he set career bests in multiple statistical categories, including WHIP (0.67), on-base plus slugging (OPS)-against (.422), batting average against (.165), save percentage (97.5%), walks (6), earned runs (11), and blown saves (1). He averaged 9.81strikeouts per 9 innings pitched, his best mark as <b>a</b> <b>closer.</b> He pitched with such control that his 12.83strikeout-to-walk ratio made him the second MLB pitcher ever to record a figure that high in a season (minimum 50innings pitched). He placed fifth in the AL Cy Young Award voting.|$|E

5|$|The MSE {{method is}} also {{sensitive}} to secondary clustering. One {{example of this}} phenomenon is when a set of observations is thought {{to come from a}} single normal distribution, but in fact comes from a mixture normals with different means. A second example is when the data is thought to come from an exponential distribution, but actually comes from a gamma distribution. In the latter case, smaller spacings may occur in the lower tail. A high value of M(θ) would indicate this secondary clustering effect, and suggesting <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> look at the data is required.|$|E
