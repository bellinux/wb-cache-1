[...] Latta also felt that despite being familiar with the setting, Gaiman never utilized the period to its full potential.

Alonso stayed in Merseyside to be at her side while she gave birth, later saying, [...] "It was a little frustrating to miss the match against Inter but I have to be with my family <b>at</b> <b>times</b> <b>like</b> these." [...] His decision to place his family ahead of a Champions League tie caused much friction with former manager Rafael Benítez. On 30 March 2010, they had their second child, a girl named Ane Alonso Aranburu. Their third child and second daughter, Emma Alonso Aranburu, was born on 2 December 2013.|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} for Drowned in Sound, Alexander Tudor {{observed}} the album's [...] "abrasiveness, brute force, and determination {{to push the}} instrument to its limits," [...] describing a [...] "relentless pummelling of metal in motion; often aggressive or chaotic, but using scales to evoke a sense of discipline" [...] while noting that Stetson was [...] "equally at home with classical minimalism." [...] Exclaim! reviewer Vincent Pollard noted how Vol. 3 [...] "organically and coherently blends Stetson's avant-garde playing and dark, complex themes with accessible and compelling compositions," [...] while MusicOMH commented that Stetson was [...] "finding guttural, fuzzy, violent sounds from his saxophone... but also finding a disarming warmth where necessary." [...] In his review for No Ripcord, Stephen Wragg stated that [...] "there’s such a polyphonic richness to these recordings that it sounds, <b>at</b> <b>times,</b> <b>like</b> five people are present" [...] and noted that the techniques employed in the recording of the album [...] "creates this heady, vertiginous rush– adrenaline-inducing in its deftness; and that’s an effect that strikes me as incredibly difficult to recreate in music." [...] Spins Richard Gehr suggested that the music was [...] "densely multiphonic, often claustrophobic, and reeks of fear and flight" [...] but that it [...] "offers at least a slight sense of salvation," [...] {{and concluded that the}} final album in the trilogy was [...] "music of the moment, a work of granular epiphanies that accrete, finally, into a magnificent whole." ...|$|E

500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} mixed. John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode 5/10, noting [...] "Overall, this episode {{attempted}} to make a mundane murder case interesting by forcing the agents to interact with an 'alien' culture. Unfortunately, {{the structure of the}} episode gave the audience answers long before the agents discovered them, making the bulk of the episode an exercise. By not taking the theme far enough or deepening the mystery, the writers ultimately fail to reach their goals." [...] Reviewer Todd VanDerWerff from The A.V. Club gave the entry a C+ and wrote that the episode [...] "was also fairly bold for its time, providing a whole subplot that's mostly told through subtitles [...] it feels like a series of shocks that are strung together along a pretty standard story setup." [...] Ultimately, VanDerWerff concluded that, [...] "the major problem with 'Hell Money' is that it feels, <b>at</b> <b>times,</b> <b>like</b> a backdoor pilot for a new series starring B.D. Wong as corrupt detective Glen Chao." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. She critiqued the fact that the episode lacked a paranormal mystery, noting that the theme of the episode [...] "would fit nicely into any other police drama". Vitaris described the [...] "three actors in the black suits and ghost masks" [...] as [...] "not very convincing." ...|$|E
500|$|Issue #1 {{received}} an average score of 7.3/10 based on 26 reviews from critics on Comic Book Roundup. Greg McElhatton of CBR gave it four stars writing, [...] "Overall, Civil War II #1 {{is a good}} launching point for this miniseries, even as it integrates the information from Civil War II #0 and the Free Comic Book Day special. I'm curious to see if Bendis and Marquez can maintain this level of tension and what they'll add into the mix to keep the conflict burning strong. For now, though, it's {{more than enough to}} get readers coming back for more." [...] Schedeen gave it a 7.1 saying, [...] "This first issue cleanly establishes the conflict and delivers a nonstop stream of gorgeous artwork. However, it offers few surprises for those not already familiar with the basics of this crossover, and it often fails to elicit a strong emotional response in the way the first issue of Civil War did ten years ago." [...] Richard Gray of Newsarama gave it a 7 and said, [...] "At this early stage, Civil War II suffers {{some of the problems that}} have beleaguered similar narratives in recent years, principally in seeing heroes all too quick to take sides against comrades on a possible future. Yet this is also just the beginning of something much larger, and while it may seem <b>at</b> <b>times</b> <b>like</b> this is an extended version of the 'zero' issue that preceded it, all the pieces are now in place for the 'war' proper to commence." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} on Sydney radio {{a decade after the}} publication of Program for a Puppet, Perry spoke about learning more from the negative reviews for his first fiction book than the good reviews: ‘Some were a bit cranky; some were patronising,’ he said, ‘but they were all in some way instructive. One thought the writing was [...] "too high mileage." [...] Another spoke of a [...] "staccato" [...] style. I recall another mentioning that it was, <b>at</b> <b>times,</b> <b>like</b> a film script. One reviewer thought I had two good thrillers in one, which had merit. I did meld two big themes that may have been better separated. But you don’t really know what you are doing on a first fiction.

As such, the book feels <b>at</b> <b>times</b> <b>like</b> a movie, and sometimes more specifically, a snuff film. New technology such as photo manipulation software (e.g. [...] "PhotoSoap for Windows 95") are featured in the novel. This creates an ironic situation in which Victor, the character obsessed by appearances, is haunted by fake images that appear real which implicate him in a murder; it becomes {{hard to tell what}} is real in the 'modern' world. As such, [...] "meaningful identity is obliterated"; this furthers the recurring joke from American Psycho wherein [...] "characters are always getting confused by their friends with other people, with no noticeable consequences".|$|E
2500|$|B.O.A.T.S. II: Me Time {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 67, based on 16 reviews. Jordan Sargent of Spin said, [...] "B.O.A.T.S. II ups the production values {{like a true}} sequel should. Whereas his last album felt <b>at</b> <b>times</b> <b>like</b> a mixtape in expensive packaging, the beats here are full and gleaming with the fruits of success." [...] Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone said [...] "his second LP further displays his knack for playfully hollering about money like he's the first guy who ever had so much paper he couldn't fold it. He tries on some new looks here but nothing slows down the self-described Black Unicorn's scene-chewing charisma." [...] At USA Today, Elysa Garnder evoked that [...] "2 Chainz wraps his gritty flow in bright, crisp arrangements. And he's not afraid to wax lyrical now and then, notably on the pining, lushly orchestrated [...] "Black Unicorn"." [...] Dan Rys of XXL stated, [...] "while the album is billed as the continuation of his first record, last year’s No. 1-debuting Based on a T.R.U. Story, Chainz also branches out a bit {{in a way that}} makes the album feel like he’s bringing at least some new records to the table while remaining stylistically consistent." [...] Kevin Ritchie of Now said, [...] "Sonically, B.O.A.T.S. II is slightly more adventurous than its predecessor thanks to Pharrell’s funky summer jam [...] "Feds Watching" [...] and the EDM-influenced [...] "Netflix", a Diplo-Fergie tag team. 2 Chainz likes to offset the raunchy with the heartfelt, but when the tone shifts to earnestly autobiographical, he sounds derivative." [...] Paul Cantor of Vibe stated, [...] "B.O.A.T.S. II: Me Time really does what it set out to do—prove that 2 Chainz, while occasionally unfocused, is more than a guy who just makes trap music. Make no mistake, there’s a lot of that here, and he’s almost got that formula down to science." ...|$|E
