50|$|Spreading of {{pathogens}} between {{fish stocks}} {{is a major}} issue in disease control. Static offshore cages may help minimize direct spreading, as there may be greater distances between aquaculture production areas. However, development of roaming cage technology could bring about new issues with disease transfer and spread. The high level of carnivorous aquaculture production results in an increased demand <b>for</b> live aquatic <b>animals</b> <b>for</b> <b>production</b> and breeding purposes such as bait, broodstock and milt. This can result in spread of disease across species barriers.|$|R

40|$|The public’s concern <b>for</b> <b>animal</b> {{welfare is}} {{evolving}} {{and it is}} important to consider factors that are related to concern <b>for</b> <b>animals</b> and their use by humans. An online survey of 825 U. S. residents was conducted. Relationships between approval of animal uses and stated concern <b>for</b> <b>animal</b> welfare were examined. More than 90 % of respondents reported that using <b>animals</b> <b>for</b> egg <b>production,</b> service or therapy, pets, and milk production was acceptable to them. Respondents who were younger or reported being female less frequently found most uses acceptable than older or male respondents. Half of respondents reported concern for the welfare of bison while 40 % or more stated concern for the welfare of elk, beef cattle, and dairy cattle. Respondents who stated they were concerned for the welfare of dairy cattle less frequently reported accepting using <b>animals</b> <b>for</b> meat <b>production,</b> livestock shows, and hunting. Thus, self-reported concern <b>for</b> <b>animal</b> species and acceptance of the use of animals were related in some instances.

40|$|The {{stem cell}} field in {{veterinary}} medicine continues to evolve rapidly both experimentally and clinically. Stem cells are {{most commonly used}} in clinical veterinary medicine in therapeutic applications {{for the treatment of}} musculoskeletal injuries in horses and dogs. New technologies of assisted reproduction are being developed to apply the properties of spermatogonial stem cells to preserve endangered animal species. The same methods can be used to generate transgenic <b>animals</b> <b>for</b> <b>production</b> of pharmaceuticals or for use as biomedical models. Small and large animal species serve as valuable models for preclinical evaluation of stem cell applications in human beings and in veterinary patients in areas such as spinal cord injury and myocardial infarction. However, these applications have not been implemented in the clinical treatment of veterinary patients. Reviews on the use of <b>animal</b> models <b>for</b> stem cell research have been published recently. Therefore, in this review, animal model research will be reviewed only in the context of supporting the current clinical application of stem cells in veterinary medicine...|$|R

40|$|Meat {{tenderness}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} characteristic quality of beef not only for consumers but for breeders of beef cattle too. Selection of cattle focussed on an increment of meat tenderness is complicated because this trait has large variability not only between different breeds but between individuals of equal breed too. Similarly a measurement of meat tenderness is expensive because it make after slaughter of animal and ageing of meat post mortem. Therefore it was developed a several methods, by the help of which is possible increase tenderness of meat. However still exist variance in values of meat tenderness which are caused by distinctness genetic base of animal. By using molecular genetic methods was described the most significant candidate genes (CAPN 1, CAST) coding formation of the calpains-calpastatin proteolytic system, which exercise an influence on tenderness. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these genes were using to design commercially genetic marker panels GeneSTAR Tenderness and Igenity Tender-GENE. By help this commercially test is possible to make genotyping and selection of <b>animals</b> <b>for</b> <b>production</b> of tenderness beef meat in meat industry. doi: 10. 5219 / 102 </div...|$|R

30|$|No soil {{standards}} have yet {{been developed for}} PFOS, PFOA, PBDEs or PBDD/Fs, even though human exposure via livestock has been demonstrated for these POPs (see above) [346]. To establish soil standards, the most critical exposure pathway (in terms of <b>animals</b> <b>for</b> food <b>production)</b> should be considered. For the reasons detailed above, this pathway is the consumption of meat/eggs from chickens that ingest polluted soil. Higher soil contamination limits might be established for less-exposed animals—although, again, particular care {{needs to be taken}} in relation to those animals whose liver or kidneys are consumed, such as pigs, beef and sheep.|$|R
