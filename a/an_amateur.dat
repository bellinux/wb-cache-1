5|$|By {{this time}} Gilbert faced {{financial}} difficulty as <b>an</b> <b>amateur</b> cricketer. Most amateurs were from privileged backgrounds, whereas professionals mainly {{came from the}} working class. It was almost unthinkable for <b>an</b> <b>amateur</b> to become a professional, although many did receive financial inducements such as generous expenses and sinecure positions within county organisations. Unlike the Grace brothers, Gilbert {{did not have a}} profession outside cricket to provide a supplementary income allowing him to live comfortably. A solution seemed to arrive in 1880, when Fred Grace, the manager of the United South of England XI touring side and one of W. G. Grace's brothers, died and Gilbert took over his paid job as secretary. But the popularity of professional touring teams was already in decline, and the increasing number of matches between county teams attracted more interest. An indication of trouble came in 1882 when a professional cricketer took Gilbert to court over unpaid fees for an appearance in a match.|$|E
