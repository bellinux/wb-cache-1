500|$|One of Jenny's storylines {{in season}} two was her revelation of being sexually abused as a child. The events were portrayed {{in a series}} of flashbacks and dream sequences. Yet, this left viewers {{confused}} about what actually happened to Jenny. During an interview with LGBT monthly magazine The Advocate, Chaiken commented about the storyline: [...] "Well we <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> was an incident of sexual abuse. I had not wanted to be more explicit about it than that – one because memory of trauma is very strange. Who knows what happened to Jenny? Jenny doesn't necessarily know herself." ...|$|E
500|$|Reflecting on {{the success}} of the song in 2002, Vig admitted: [...] "People still ask us who the 'Stupid Girl' is, and that's {{impossible}} to answer. The song is sort of meant to be a wake up call. It could be about an ex-girlfriend. It could be about a rock diva that we <b>all</b> <b>know,</b> <b>it</b> could be about your sister. It could also be called 'Stupid Boy'." [...] Looking back, he also stated, [...] "It's impossible to predict what will be a hit. But subconsciously, I knew the song was good when I kept playing the same rough mix over and over again on my car stereo for months." ...|$|E

2500|$|You pledged {{during the}} last debate {{that you would not}} raise taxes on those making less than $200,000 a year. But the price of {{everything}} is going up, and we <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>it.</b> Health care costs, as you all talking about, is skyrocketing, the cost of the war. My question is, how can you or any president, whoever is elected next time, keep that pledge without running this country deeper into debt and passing on more of the bills that we're running up to our children? ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1873, Congressman Sidney Clarke, who {{assisted}} in Caldwell's election, testified that Caldwell's campaign had claimed {{that it would}} pay $250,000 to secure the election. Kansas Governor Thomas Carney testified that he was paid $15,000 {{to drop out of}} the race. An investigation followed; its final report asked the Senate to expel Caldwell for not being [...] "duly and legally elected". On March 21, 1873, Ferry took to the floor of the Senate and gave a speech asking the Senate to expel Caldwell: [...] "The crime of bribery goes down to the very foundations of the institutions under which we live. We <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> and...we shall stifle our consciences if we do not vote to expel." [...] After a survey of the Senate, Caldwell saw his inevitability of being expelled, and resigned, on March 23.|$|E
2500|$|Graham {{always told}} me right early on {{that he would never}} get married. He told me that his life was devastated when his parents split up, and he said {{straight}} out, [...] "Mrs Fox, I'll never get married", so I never expected anything more of him than what did happen. Even when Lana Cantrell came into the scene I was puzzled and I did say to him why all this, and of course we <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> was good publicity. Lana came to the house and I had to go up, and have it all cleaned, ready for her and her party to come one Sunday night. And then on the Monday night, this great big announcement was going to be made that {{he was supposed to be}} engaged to Lana Cantrell. Well, the ratings went through the roof...|$|E
5000|$|As we <b>all</b> <b>know,</b> <b>it's</b> only a comic if it uses art, and it {{can only}} be art if it's hand drawn. David Anez didn’t <b>know</b> <b>it</b> then, but he’d be the pioneer in {{shattering}} this stereotype" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "None {{of us is}} complaining, Gif. We <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>it's</b> {{the easiest}} {{thing in the world}} to get lost in a big woods like this--especially when there is snow on the ground to cover up the landmarks." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> must cost us something,' she said, 'and we'll try to {{be ready}} with it, though it does go to one's heart that the first should be what vexes you, my Alfy; but it won't be for long.' ...|$|R
60|$|The last {{appointed}} footstep sounded now {{upon the}} stairs. They <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it.</b> It was Mr Pecksniff's; and Mr Pecksniff {{was in a}} hurry too, for he came bounding up with such uncommon expedition that he stumbled twice or thrice.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No indeed,' said Flora. 'We <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> is a pity; but {{it would}} be a far greater pity to break it off now--and do Tom an {{infinity}} of harm. Now tell me all.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{of course}} nobody would ask Mr. Campbell. We <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> {{would be of}} no use. He doesn't believe in {{missions}} at all--in fact, he says he detests the very mention of missions--and he never gives one cent to them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, indeed!" [...] said Mrs. Smiley. [...] "But where's {{the other}} witness, Mrs. Moulder? He's {{the one who}} is a deal more {{interesting}} to me. Ha, ha, ha! But as you <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> here, what's the good of not telling the truth? Ha, ha, ha!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{course we}} <b>all</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it's</b> along of her ladyship's {{marriage}} which warn't no marriage," [...] said the cook. [...] "May the heavens be her bed when the Lord takes her! A betther lady nor a kinder-hearted niver stepped {{the floor of}} a kitchen." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Don't go to kickin' up a fuss with yourself," [...] Bob said soothingly. [...] "We <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> was an accident, for you set {{even more}} by the steamer than we did.

6000|$|... “Oh, Miguel!” she cried. “I {{tell you}} a secret. Of course {{it is no secret}} any more, for now they <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>it,</b> up there at the house.

6000|$|... "It was {{a terrible}} time. I was only a child, but I can {{remember}} how wild the men all seemed when you drove up and leaped out of the wagon. I didn't realize that my father's life depended on your coming, but we <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was brave of you." ...|$|R
5000|$|Look, {{technically}} it's not plagiarized. It's not {{the same}} chord progression. It's a feeling. Because there's a cowbell in it and a Fender Rhodes as the main instrumentation—that still doesn't make <b>it</b> plagiarized. We <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>it's</b> derivative. That's how Pharrell works. Everything that Pharrell produces is derivative of another song—but it's a homage.|$|R
60|$|We made {{a single}} halt, as before, to dine; but little was said, at this meal, and {{no change in}} our plan was proposed.

6000|$|... 'By Bacchus, yes, sir! They <b>all</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> in France. I {{have heard}} it many times, sung by the little children.

60|$|The papa {{had told}} the story so often that the {{children}} knew just exactly what to expect the moment he began.
