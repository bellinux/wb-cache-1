25|$|Chemists {{frequently}} {{refer to}} chemical compounds using chemical formulae or molecular {{structure of the}} compound. There has been a phenomenal {{growth in the number}} of chemical compounds being synthesized (or isolated), and then reported in the scientific literature by professional chemists around the world. An enormous number of chemical compounds are possible through the chemical combination of the known chemical elements. As of May 2011, about sixty million chemical compounds are known. The names of many of these compounds are often nontrivial and hence not very easy to remember or cite accurately. Also it is difficult to keep the track of them in the literature. Several international organizations like IUPAC and CAS have initiated steps to make such tasks easier. CAS provides the <b>abstracting</b> <b>services</b> of the chemical literature, and provides a numerical identifier, known as CAS registry number to each chemical substance that has been reported in the chemical literature (such as chemistry journals and patents). This information is compiled as a database and is popularly known as the Chemical substances index. Other computer-friendly systems that have been developed for substance information, are: SMILES and the International Chemical Identifier or InChI.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{constant}} {{changes of}} business requirements and applications, dynamical reconfiguration of service composition becomes {{an important and}} challenging task. Web service composition may save time and expense in software development. In this paper, we introduce the <b>abstract</b> <b>service</b> hierarchy in the OWL-S Ontology Framework for dynamic web service composition. In our approach, the web services are composed at the <b>abstract</b> <b>service</b> level which is {{a higher level of}} abstraction than concrete services. The super instance of an <b>abstract</b> <b>service</b> is also introduced to help describe the service is attached with an instance pool including all instances of the <b>abstract</b> <b>service</b> to facilitate fail-over and dynamic compositions. An algorithm to populate the concrete services to the instance pool is also provided. We illustrate our approach using a case study.

We service layer so that web services can be composed at the <b>abstract</b> <b>service</b> level instead of the concrete level.

50|$|In 1963, Taylor argued {{behavioral}} sciences provide fundamental approach to information science, {{as well as}} logic and mathematics, linguistics, and systems analysis.

50|$|Increasing {{reliance}} on <b>abstracting</b> <b>services,</b> especially on those available electronically, {{means that the}} effective criterion for whether a publication format forms part of the established, trusted literature is whether it is covered by these services; in particular, by the specialised service for the discipline concerned such as Chemical Abstracts Service, and by the major interdisciplinary services such as those marketed by the Institute for Scientific Information.|$|E
