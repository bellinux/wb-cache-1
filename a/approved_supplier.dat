25|$|Light water {{makes an}} {{excellent}} moderator, the light hydrogen atoms {{are very close}} in mass to a neutron and can absorb {{a lot of energy}} in a single collision (like a collision of two billiard balls). Light hydrogen is also fairly effective at absorbing neutrons, and there will be too few left over to react with the small amount of 235U in natural uranium, preventing criticality. In order to allow criticality, the fuel must be enriched, increasing the amount of 235U to an usable level. In light water reactors, the fuel is typically enriched to between 2% and 5% 235U (the leftover fraction with less 235U is called depleted uranium). Enrichment facilities are expensive to build and operate. They are also a proliferation concern as they can be used to enrich the 235U much further, up to weapons-grade material (90% or more 235U). This can be remedied if the fuel is supplied and reprocessed by an internationally <b>approved</b> <b>supplier.</b>|$|E

It articulates a supply chain flexibility framework which identifies two key antecedents of supply chain flexibility: vendor flexibility and sourcing flexibility. We argue that dimensions of criticality of service, spend, regularity of demand and relationship type are important variables when considering vendor and sourcing flexibility. Using these dimensions, construction companies can segment their supply base into <b>approved</b> <b>suppliers,</b> preferred suppliers and framework agreement suppliers.

40|$|International audienceAbstract Primary Objective: The {{aim of the}} {{research}} is to investigate whether it is possible for the smaller organisation to undertake supplier development activities. A review of the literature identifies that the furniture industry, which this paper focuses, has been overlooked in terms of supply chain (SC) research. Research design: This research adopted a case study approach, which included both with the lead organisation (assembler/customer) and a number of their suppliers. Methods and Procedures: Semi- structured interviews were conducted with various personnel within the lead organisation and their suppliers. Company documentation and field notes were also employed. Main outcomes and results: A three-stage model was used to communicate the different activities that the assembler employed in order to engage their suppliers. This model details the internal and external drivers for change and the outcomes in terms of <b>approved</b> <b>suppliers,</b> preferred suppliers and eventually working towards strategic partners. The findings include the benefits of SC activities can bring the smaller organization but also considers the issues around limited resources. Conclusions: The paper concludes that Supply Chain Management is appropriate for the smaller organisation and recommends further testing of the generic model proposed by this study.
