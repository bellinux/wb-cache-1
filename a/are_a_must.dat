It is wise not to wear spurs, which can get caught {{on the line and}} cause the trainer to trip.|$|E

25|$|Flucytosine is well absorbed (75 to 90%) {{from the}} {{gastrointestinal}} tract. Intake with meals slows the absorption, {{but does not}} decrease the amount absorbed. Following an oral dose of 2grams peak serum levels are reached after approximately 6 hours. The time to peak level decreases with continued therapy. After 4 days peak levels are measured after 2 hours. The drug is eliminated renally. In normal patients flucytosine has reportedly a half-life of 2.5 to 6 hours. In patients with impaired renal function higher serum levels are seen and the drug tends to accumulate. The drug is mainly excreted unchanged in the urine (90% of an oral dose) and only traces are metabolized and excreted in the feces. Therapeutic serum levels range from 25 to 100µg/ml. Serum levels in excess of 100µg {{are associated with a}} higher incidence of side effects. Periodic measurements of serum levels are recommended for all patients and <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>must</b> in patients with renal damage.|$|E
500|$|The {{weather is}} another major {{consideration}} of hikers on the trail. [...] Hiking {{season of the}} trail generally starts in mid-to-late spring, when conditions are much more favorable in the South. However, this time may also be characterized by extreme heat, sometimes in excess of [...] Under such conditions, hydration is imperative. Light clothing and sunscreens <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>must</b> at high elevations and areas without foliage, even in relatively cool weather. Farther north and at higher elevations, the weather can be cold, characterized by low temperatures, strong winds, hail or snow storms and reduced visibility. Prolonged rain, though not typically life-threatening, can undermine stamina and ruin supplies. [...] In March 2015, a hiker was killed on the trail in Maryland when a large tree blew over and fell onto him.|$|E

2500|$|They {{are very}} adept jumpers, and fences meant to contain them {{must be more}} than five feet (1.52 metres) high, six feet (1.82 metres) or higher being preferable. Because they are such good jumpers, they are well suited to the sport of dog agility. They are often {{classified}} as sighthounds, and thus compete in lure coursing. Because they maintain very little body fat and have short coats, they are sensitive to cold and cannot be left outside for long in cold climates. [...] Dog coats/jackets <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>must</b> for this breed in cold climates. Many Pharaoh Hounds enjoy snow, however, and will keep themselves warm through running, playing, and digging.|$|E

For the adventurous, Kemmangundi offers many peaks to scale and intricate jungle paths to explore. This place has a beautiful rose garden and other attractions.

2500|$|Mouhot's tomb was {{consumed}} by the jungle and lost until it was accidentally rediscovered in 1989 by a French Laos scholar, Jean-Michel Strobino, who {{played a part in}} rehabilitating it {{with the support of the}} French embassy and the Municipality of Montbeliard, Mouhot's birth town. A new plaque was fixed to one end of the crypt in 1990 to commemorate this rediscovery. [...] The location is now known to hotels and tourist operators in Luang Prabang, and a minivan or [...] "tuk tuk" [...] may be hired to take one the 10km from town to visit it. This entails a walk down a steep track on the southern bank of river Nam Khan, over a small wooden bridge, and then up to a well-cleared track to the tomb, altogether about 150 meters. A new road being constructed nearby (June 2013) will make access easier. The tomb is still quite near the river (only about 20m), and access by boat from town should be possible. As more people visit the tomb, the pathway hopefully will be improved, as it is quite slippery after rain; sensible shoes <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>must.</b>|$|E
