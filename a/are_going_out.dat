2500|$|The {{term was}} later used in March 1984 by Gay Bryant. She was the {{former editor of}} Working Woman {{magazine}} and was changing jobs to be the editor of Family Circle. In an Adweek article written by Nora Frenkel, Bryant was reported as saying, [...] "Women have reached a certain point—I call it the glass ceiling. They're {{in the top of}} middle management and they're stopping and getting stuck. There isn't enough room for all those women at the top. Some are going into business for themselves. Others <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> and raising families." [...] Also in 1984, Bryant used the term in a chapter of the book The Working Woman Report: Succeeding in Business in the 1980s. In the same book, Basia Hellwig used the term in another chapter.|$|E

2500|$|Nominal {{surnames}} {{may or may}} {{not change}} with gender. Like other Slavic languages, Polish has special feminine suffixes which were added to a woman's surname. A woman who was never married used her father's surname with the suffix -ówna or -'anka. A married woman or a widow used her husband's surname with the suffix -owa or -'ina / -'yna (the apostrophe means that the last consonant in the base form of the surname is softened). Although these suffixes are still used by some people, mostly the elderly and in rural areas, they are now becoming outdated and {{there is a tendency to}} use the same form of a nominal surname for both a man and a woman. Furthermore, the forms [...] "-anka" [...] and [...] "-ina/-yna" [...] <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> of fashion and being replaced by [...] "-ówna" [...] and [...] "-owa" [...] respectively.|$|E
2500|$|Faced {{with the}} {{exploding}} popularity of buying online, shopping malls are emptying and are seeking new solutions to generate traffic. In the US, for example, roughly 200 out of 1,300 malls {{across the country}} <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> of business. To combat this trend, developers are trying to turn malls into leisure centers that include attractions such as parks, movie theaters, gyms, and even fishing lakes. Others, such as the European commercial real-estate giant Unibail-Rodamco, are modernizing their approach by promoting brand interaction and enhanced architectural appeal. A recent example that integrates both approaches is the So Ouest mall outside of Paris {{that was designed to}} resemble elegant, Louis XV-style apartments and includes [...] of green space. The Australian mall company Westfield launched an online mall (and later a mobile app) with 150 stores, 3,000 brands and over 1 million products. Online shopping has increased its share of total retail sales since 2008. In Q3 2008, it comprised 3.6% of retail purchases and this increased to 7.4% by Q3 2015.|$|E
