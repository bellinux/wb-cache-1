5|$|Several {{relativistic}} {{effects are}} directly related to the relativity of direction.

For the Moon–Earth system, this effect has been measured with the help of lunar laser ranging.

5|$|The {{corresponding}} {{concept for}} undirected graphs is a forest, an undirected graph without cycles.

Moreover, every undirected graph has an acyclic orientation, an assignment of <b>a</b> <b>direction</b> for its edges that makes it into a directed acyclic graph.
