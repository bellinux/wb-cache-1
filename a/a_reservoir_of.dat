5|$|In the {{fountain}} effect, a chamber is constructed which {{is connected to}} <b>a</b> <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> heliumII by a sintered disc through which superfluid helium leaks easily but through which non-superfluid helium cannot pass. If {{the interior of the}} container is heated, the superfluid helium changes to non-superfluid helium. In order to maintain the equilibrium fraction of superfluid helium, superfluid helium leaks through and increases the pressure, causing liquid to fountain out of the container.|$|E
5|$|The average {{salinity}} of Earth's oceans {{is about}} 35grams of salt per kilogram of sea water (3.5% salt). Most of this salt {{was released from}} volcanic activity or extracted from cool igneous rocks. The oceans are also <b>a</b> <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> dissolved atmospheric gases, which are essential {{for the survival of}} many aquatic life forms. Sea water has an important influence on the world's climate, with the oceans acting as a large heat reservoir. Shifts in the oceanic temperature distribution can cause significant weather shifts, such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of water}} to {{extinguish}} the fire was also frustrated. In principle, water was available from a system of elm pipes which supplied 30,000 houses via a high water tower at Cornhill, filled from the river at high tide, and also via <b>a</b> <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> Hertfordshire spring water in Islington. It was often possible to open a pipe near a burning building and connect it to a hose to play on a fire or fill buckets. Further, Pudding Lane {{was close to the}} river. Theoretically, all the lanes from the river up to the bakery and adjoining buildings should have been manned with double rows of firefighters passing full buckets up to the fire and empty buckets back down to the river.|$|E

5|$|Scottish {{music is}} a {{significant}} aspect of the nation's culture, with both traditional and modern influences. A famous traditional Scottish instrument is the Great Highland Bagpipe, a wind instrument consisting of three drones and a melody pipe (called the chanter), which are fed continuously by <b>a</b> <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> air in a bag. Bagpipe bands, featuring bagpipes and various types of drums, and showcasing Scottish music styles while creating new ones, have spread throughout the world. The clàrsach (harp), fiddle and accordion are also traditional Scottish instruments, the latter two heavily featured in Scottish country dance bands. There are many successful Scottish bands and individual artists in varying styles including Annie Lennox, Amy Macdonald, Runrig, Boards of Canada, Cocteau Twins, Deacon Blue, Franz Ferdinand, Susan Boyle, Emeli Sandé, Texas, The View, The Fratellis, Twin Atlantic and Biffy Clyro. Other Scottish musicians include Shirley Manson, Paolo Nutini and Calvin Harris.|$|E

25|$|The hammer-headed bat is one {{of three}} species of African fruit bat that are thought to serve as {{reservoirs}} for the Ebola virus. Although antibodies against Ebola virus and fragments of viral RNA have been isolated from these bats, the virus itself has not been, so other species might be more important in its transmission.

25|$|On 7 October 2009, the {{presence}} of water ice was confirmed {{on the surface of}} 24 Themis using NASA’s Infrared Telescope Facility. The surface of the asteroid appears completely covered in ice. As this ice layer is sublimated, it may be getting replenished by <b>a</b> <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> ice under the surface. Organic compounds were also detected on the surface. Scientists hypothesize that some of the first water brought to Earth was delivered by asteroid impacts after the collision that produced the Moon.

25|$|The current {{hypothesis}} of calcium-dependent exocytosis at retinal ribbon synapses {{suggests that the}} ribbon accommodates <b>a</b> <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> primed releasable vesicles. The vesicles that are in closest contact with the presynaptic plasma membrane {{at the base of}} the ribbon constitute the small, rapidly releasable pool of vesicles, whereas the remaining vesicles tethered to the ribbon constitute the large, readily (slower) releasable pool. These regularly aligned rows of synaptic vesicles tethered to either side of the ribbon along with the expression of the kinesin motor protein KIF3A at retinal ribbon synapses can move vesicles like a conveyor belt to the docking/release site at the ribbon base.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the unusual}} {{relationship}} between water's temperature and its density, lakes form layers called thermoclines, layers of drastically varying temperature relative to depth. Fresh water is most dense at about 4 degrees Celsius (39.2°F) at sea level. When {{the temperature of}} the water at the surface of a lake reaches the same temperature as deeper water, as it does during the cooler months in temperate climates, the water in the lake can mix, bringing oxygen-starved water up from the depths and bringing oxygen down to decomposing sediments. Deep temperate lakes can maintain <b>a</b> <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> cold water year-round, which allows some cities to tap that reservoir for deep lake water cooling.|$|E

25|$|All in all, {{the region}} {{was used by the}} Austro-Hungarian {{government}} mostly as <b>a</b> <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> cheap workforce and recruits for the army, as well as a buffer zone against Russia. It was not until early in the 20th century that heavy industry started to be developed, which would be comparable to much of Russia and the Balkans. Even then it was mostly connected to war production. The biggest state investments in the region were the railways and the fortresses in Przemyśl, Kraków and other cities. Industrial development was mostly connected to the private oil industry started by Ignacy Łukasiewicz and to the Wieliczka salt mines, operational since at least the Middle Ages.|$|E
25|$|From 1875, major {{construction}} resumed, {{with the}} construction of <b>a</b> <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> , Polotsk and Solferino barracks, and of the auction market hall. The town continued to equip itself with the opening in 1884 of the municipal library, in 1886 the school group of St. Paul, in 1887 the dry dock and in 1897 a corps of firefighters. To entertain holidaymakers, the Granvillaises Regatta Society was founded in 1889, the horse racing course and the Société des Courses of Granville in 1890, and the golf course in 1912. The Montparnasse derailment was on 22 October 1895, when the Granville–Paris express train overran the buffers at Paris Montparnasse station. Finally, in 1898, the St. Paul Church was inaugurated.|$|E
25|$|Above ground are {{foundations}} of buildings, machinery, a ramp for transportation of mine cars to different levels, <b>a</b> <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> water and depots, some with systems of heating up building materials in winter. The largest structure is a single-storey, concrete building (680m2, 2,300m3) with walls 0.5m thick and roof adapted for camouflage by vegetation (0.6m). A utility tunnel (1.25mx1.95m, 30m) was under construction to connect {{it with the}} shaft. Another structure of unknown purpose is a concrete monolith (30.9mx29.8m) with tens of pipes, drains and culverts, buried into the rock at least 4.5m. A narrow gauge railway network connected the tunnels with the railway station {{in the village of}} Głuszyca Górna (German: Oberwüstegiersdorf). Since 1996, the complex is open to the public.|$|E

25|$|In {{the event}} of a {{petroleum}} shortage (see peak oil for global concerns), organic agriculture can be more attractive than conventional practices that use petroleum-based pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers. Some studies using modern organic-farming methods have reported yields equal to or higher than those available from conventional farming. In the aftermath of the fall of the Soviet Union, with shortages of conventional petroleum-based inputs, Cuba made use of mostly organic practices, including biopesticides, plant-based pesticides and sustainable cropping practices, to feed its populace. However, organic farming may be more labor-intensive and would require a shift of the workforce from urban to rural areas. The reconditioning of soil to restore organic matter lost during the use of monoculture agriculture techniques is important to provide <b>a</b> <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> plant-available nutrients, to maintain texture, and to minimize erosion.|$|E
25|$|As the British {{war machine}} pushed on across the Sinai Peninsula the {{infrastructure}} and supporting British garrisons strongly held all the territory they occupied. By {{the end of}} February 1917, 388miles of railway (at a rate of 1 kilometre a day), 203miles of metalled road, 86miles of wire and brushwood roads and 300miles of water pipeline had been constructed. The pipeline required three huge pumping plants working 24hours a day at Kantara, near <b>a</b> <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> 6,000,000 gallons. For local use, the pumps forced the water through 5inch pipe to Dueidar, through a 6inch pipe to Pelusium, Romani and Mahemdia and through a 12inch pipe the main supply was pushed across the desert from pumping station to pumping station. At Romani a concrete reservoir contained a further 6,000,000 gallons, at Bir el Abd 5,000,000 and at Mazar 500,000 and another of 500,000 at El Arish. And with railhead at Rafa, Gaza was by then just twenty miles away, five to six hours for infantry and mounted units at a walk and 2hours distant for horses at a trot.|$|E
25|$|The actual {{temperature}} in a drying kiln is the dry-bulb temperature (usually denoted by Tg), {{which is the}} temperature of a vapour-gas mixture determined by inserting a thermometer with a dry bulb. On the other hand, the wet-bulb temperature (TW) {{is defined as the}} temperature reached by a small amount of liquid evaporating in a large amount of an unsaturated air-vapour mixture. The temperature sensing element of this thermometer is kept moist with a porous fabric sleeve (cloth) usually put in <b>a</b> <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> clean water. A minimum air flow of 2m/s is needed to prevent a zone of stagnant damp air formation around the sleeve (Walker et al., 1993). Since air passes over the wet sleeve, water is evaporated and cools the wet-bulb thermometer. The difference between the dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures, the wet-bulb depression, is used to determine the relative humidity from a standard hygrometric chart (Walker et al., 1993). A higher difference between the dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures indicates a lower relative humidity. For example, if the dry-bulb temperature is 100°C and wet-bulb temperature 60°C, then the relative humidity is read as 17% from a hygrometric chart.|$|E
