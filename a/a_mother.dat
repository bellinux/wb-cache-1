5|$|Violet Clay (1978) and <b>A</b> <b>Mother</b> and Two Daughters (1982) {{are each}} about an {{unmarried}} protagonist's career in a creative profession. In <b>A</b> <b>Mother</b> and Two Daughters {{the main character}} resists the temptation {{to get married and}} chooses instead to focus on her work. <b>A</b> <b>Mother</b> and Two Daughters and A Southern Family (1987) each depend heavily on a southern setting and employ themes traditionally associated with social problems in the South. Some of their themes include racial discrimination, social-economic class and the cultural differences between generations. Many characters struggle to reduce the gap between the rich and poor or try to break free from a dominant cultural tradition, with mixed success.|$|E

5|$|As <b>a</b> <b>mother,</b> Lady Rosebery was {{presented}} with a dilemma: she was in fact already practically <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> to her husband who had no great feeling for a proximity to small babies. This was particularly evident in June 1880 when shortly {{after the birth of}} their first child Sybil, Rosebery wished to visit Germany for three months, to take a cure at a German spa (he was recovering from what is now thought to have been a nervous breakdown). His wife dutifully accompanied him. However, Rosebery, clearly aware of his wife's frustrated maternal instincts, reported that Hannah savoured every detail of the daily letters from London concerning the baby, and that she never complained at the forced separation.|$|E

The findings demonstrate that <b>a</b> <b>mother’s</b> short-term needs and interests may not always align with her children’s long-term interests, and work may become a contested terrain between mothers and children...|$|R

In 1987, Godwin was awarded the Janet Heidinger Kafka Prize for her work on The Southern Family.|$|E

5|$|Motherhood, a theme {{throughout}} Angelou's autobiographies, {{becomes more}} complex in The Heart of a Woman. Although Guy {{struggles with the}} developmentally appropriate process of adolescent separation from his mother, they remain close.

Her past conflict between her professional and personal lives are resolved, and she fulfills her promise to Guy she made to him {{at the end of her}} previous autobiography that they would never be separated again. Lupton writes that Angelou resolves this conflict by subordinating her needs to her child's.|$|E

The episode was stripped of all music—a regular staple of the Buffy series—and disorienting effects were included to convey the sense of displacement and loss associated with the death of a close family member.|$|E
