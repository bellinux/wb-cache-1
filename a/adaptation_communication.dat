The networked control system contains random delays from sensor to controller and from controller to actuator. The proposed predictive controller includes an adaptation loop which decreases the influence of communication delay on the control performance. Also, the predictive controller contains a filter which improves the robustness of the control system. The performance of the proposed adaptive predictive controller is demonstrated by simulation results in comparison with PI controller and predictive controller with constant delay.

More specifically, with the assistance of a worldwide data and a statistical computer program it is developed a conceptual scheme of five terms delimited in business to business context. This thesis falls within the International Purchasing Survey project which at present time works with Politecnico di Milano among other universities. As a matter of fact, this project collects information from markets and later interprets it to solve ongoing difficulties of firms. By doing so, this institution makes significant efforts to contribute {{to a better understanding of}} purchasing and its related details. Though this collaboration it is possible to acquire a verified list of aspects buyers should attach importance whether they desire to improve their relationships and achieve several positive effects in performances. Particularly, to do reach this goal, it has been proposed a set of constructs (i. e. attraction, trust, <b>adaptation,</b> <b>communication,</b> innovation) and analyzed its appropriation considering how partners interact in this kind of environments. Note that this article is built assuming its inclusion in a global collection of other studies and as a consequence it bears in mind the possibility of future revisions or amplifications by other researchers. Concrete methodology employed consists in (1) exploration of the area of analysis by testing suppliers’ relevance in success of buying companies, (2) reflexion on the concept and elements of attraction, (3) revision of trust, <b>adaptation,</b> <b>communication</b> and innovation in a fixed structure, (4) definition of the research framework, formalising hypotheses as well as model and describing data, measures and methods of analysis and (5) closure with results and conclusions.

Information received from 151 manufacturers revealed that these three parameters play a significant negative role in building sound relationship quality, in terms of adaptation, commitment, communication, cooperation, satisfaction, trust, and understanding - which, in turn, may inhibit the firm's progression along the internationalization path. Specifically, an inverse association was found between uncertainty, distance, and conflict, on one hand, and commitment, cooperation, and satisfaction, on the other. In addition, in relationships characterized by high uncertainty, <b>adaptation,</b> <b>communication,</b> trust, and understanding were low. In high distance relationships, communication was insufficient, and in high conflict situations, trust and understanding were low.

In order to inform coastal dwellers about affordable and suitable <b>adaptation,</b> <b>communication</b> should target all categories of households. A typology of household-level adaptation can further assist in addressing specific target groups. For instance, risk communication through social media could {{make use of}} the classification and address younger age groups that often belong to the category of minimalists. Furthermore, by identifying the factors which have an effect on decisions concerning adaptation, we improve our understanding of how behavioural changes and investment decisions can be encouraged. The proposed typology can provide indications about unexplored drivers of household-level adaptation for future research (e.g. by further focusing on the characteristics of specific categories of households) and improve our understanding of existing patterns in household-level adaptation. The typological construction can also help to manage larger data sets containing information about household-level adaptation.|$|E

In this context, narrative research is often seen as a qualitative social science method used to frame <b>adaptation</b> <b>communication.</b> However, this perspective neglects an important insight provided by narrative theory as applied in the cognitive sciences and other practical fields: human cognition is organized around specific narrative structures. In adaptation, this means that how we ‘story’ the environment determines how we understand and practice adaptation, how risks are defined, who is authorized as actors in the change debate, {{and the range of}} policy options considered. Furthermore, relating an experience through story-telling is already doing ‘knowledge work’, or learning. In taking narrative beyond its use as an extractive social research methodology, we argue that narrative research offers an innovative, holistic approach {{to a better understanding of}} socio-ecological systems and the improved, participatory design of local adaptation policies. Beyond producing data on local knowledge(s) and socio-cultural and affective-emotive factors influencing adaptive capacity, it can significantly inform public engagement, deliberation and learning strategies–features of systemic adaptive governance. We critically discuss narrative as both a self-reflective methodology and as a paradigmatic shift in future adaptation research and practice. We explore the narrative approach as a basis for participatory learning in the governance of socio-ecological systems. Finally, we assemble arguments for investing in alternative governance approaches consistent with a shift to a ‘narrative paradigm’...|$|E

They include software development, knowledge modeling, and information management methods and tools. In addition, navigation, interaction, <b>adaptation,</b> <b>communication,</b> and collaboration facilities are of concern. Software development and knowledge modeling tools allow authors of multimedia learning materials to design meaningful learning tasks and to explicate and organize the information and multimedia content learners need to construct subject knowledge. Well-designed navigation facilities let learners explore an information space {{at their own pace}} and orientation. Interaction facilities provide learners with opportunities for experimentation, contextdependent feedback, and constructive problem solving. Adaptation mechanisms render it possible to select, organize and present information depending on predefined user profile settings or through monitoring of user behavior and diagnosis of learning status. Asynchronous and synchronous communication and collaboration facilities help to bridge geographical distance between teachers and students. They also allow peer students to form a distributed project group or learning community and work together over a distance. Research on Web-based learning environments is still at its infancy and far from mature. The following discussion will therefore be biased and selective. It will put emphasis on issues that lie in the intersection of software en- gineering and knowledge engineering, including domain modeling, adaptation and adaptivity of learning environments, and synchronous collaboration. ...|$|E

This work draws its inspirations from neurobiology, psychophysics and sociology to approach the problem of building autonomous robots capable of interacting with each other and building strategies based on temperamental decision mechanism. Modelling emotions is a relatively recent focus in artificial intelligence and cognitive modelling. Such models can ideally inform our understanding of human behavior. We may see the development of computational models of emotion as a core research focus that will facilitate {{advances in}} the large array of computational systems that model, interpret or influence human behavior. We propose a model based on a scalable, flexible and modular approach to emotion which allows runtime evaluation between emotional quality and performance. The results achieved showed that the strategies based on temperamental decision mechanism strongly influence the system performance and there are evident dependency between emotional state of the agents and their temperamental type, as well as the dependency between the team performance and the temperamental configuration of the team members, and this enable us to conclude that the modular approach to emotional programming based on temperamental theory is the good choice to develop computational mind models for emotional behavioral Multi-Agent systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{intensity}} and occurrence of extreme weather events {{are expected to}} change with climate change. This change necessitates adaptive responses to extreme events, which need {{to take into account}} different societal perspectives, in order to be robust. In this paper, we explore the perspectives of different social actors in the Netherlands with respect to extreme weather events and ways to adapt to these events. The paper reports on a set of 41 interviews, using the repertory grid technique. The results were analyzed, to identify (a) the perspectives that stakeholders hold as most important for adaptation to extreme weather events; (b) the determinants of differences in perspectives. We find six different perspectives, all of which prioritize different adaptive actions. Producing robust adaptive responses which include different perspectives is therefore not a straightforward matter and is likely to result in win-lose situations. Further, differences in perspectives were not closely related to different sectors the interviewees belonged to. Thus, the traditional approach of involving different sectors to discuss and produce adaptation measures may be too limiting and needs to be supplemented to involving actors with different perspectives. The level of concern and level of information influenced the ways interviewees perceive adaptation priorities for extreme weather events.

40|$|Frontline {{employee}} behaviours are recognised {{as vital}} for achieving {{a competitive advantage}} for service organisations. The services marketing literature has comprehensively examined ways to improve frontline employee behaviours in service delivery and recovery. However, limited {{attention has been paid}} to frontline employee behaviours that favour customers in ways that go against organisational norms or rules. This study examines these behaviours by introducing a behavioural concept of Customer-Oriented Deviance (COD). COD is defined as, “frontline employees exhibiting extra-role behaviours that they perceive to defy existing expectations or prescribed rules of higher authority through service <b>adaptation,</b> <b>communication</b> and use of resources to benefit customers during interpersonal service encounters. ” This thesis develops a COD measure and examines the key determinants of these behaviours from a frontline employee perspective. Existing research on similar behaviours that has originated in the positive deviance and pro-social behaviour domains has limitations and is considered inadequate to examine COD in the services context. The absence of a well-developed body of knowledge on non-conforming service behaviours has implications for both theory and practice. The provision of ‘special favours’ increases customer satisfaction but the over-servicing of customers is also counterproductive for the service delivery and costly for the organisation. Despite these implications of non-conforming service behaviours, there is little understanding about the nature of these behaviours and its key drivers. This research builds on inadequacies in prior research on positive deviance, pro-social and pro-customer literature to develop the theoretical foundation of COD. The concept of positive deviance which has predominantly been used to study organisational behaviours is applied within a services marketing setting. Further, it addresses previous limitations in pro-social and pro-customer behavioural literature that has examined limited forms of behaviours with no clear understanding on the nature of these behaviours. Building upon these literature streams, this research adopts a holistic approach towards the conceptualisation of COD. It addresses previous shortcomings in the literature by providing a well bounded definition, developing a psychometrically sound measure of COD and a conceptually well-founded model of COD. The concept of COD was examined across three separate studies and based on the theoretical foundations of role theory and social identity theory. Study 1 was exploratory and based on in-depth interviews using the Critical Incident Technique (CIT). The aim of Study 1 was to understand the nature of COD and qualitatively identify its key drivers. Thematic analysis was conducted to analyse the data and the two potential dimensions of COD behaviours of Deviant Service Adaptation (DSA) and Deviant Service Communication (DSC) were revealed in the analysis. In addition, themes representing the potential influences of COD were broadly classified as individual factors, situational factors, and organisational factors. Study 2 was a scale development procedure that involved the generation and purification of items for the measure based on two student samples working in customer service roles (Pilot sample, N= 278; Initial validation sample, N= 231). The results for the reliability and Exploratory Factor Analyses (EFA) on the pilot sample suggested the scale had poor psychometric properties. As a result, major revisions were made in terms of item wordings and new items were developed based on the literature to reflect a new dimension, Deviant Use of Resources (DUR). The revised items were tested on the initial validation sample with the EFA analysis suggesting a four-factor structure of COD. The aim of Study 3 was to further purify the COD measure and test for nomological validity based on its theoretical relationships with key antecedents and similar constructs (key correlates). The theoretical model of COD consisting of nine hypotheses was tested on a retail and hospitality sample of frontline employees (Retail N= 311; Hospitality N= 305) of a market research panel using an online survey. The data was analysed using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The results provided support for a re-specified second-order three-factor model of COD which consists of 11 items. Overall, the COD measure was found to be reliable and valid, demonstrating convergent validity, discriminant validity and marginal partial invariance for the factor loadings. The results showed support for nomological validity, although the antecedents had differing impact on COD across samples. Specifically, empathy and perspective-taking, role conflict, and job autonomy significantly influenced COD in the retail sample, whereas empathy and perspective-taking, risk-taking propensity and role conflict were significant predictors in the hospitality sample. In addition, customer orientation-selling orientation, the altruistic dimension of organisational citizenship behaviours, workplace deviance, and social desirability responding were found to correlate with COD. This research makes several contributions to theory. First, the findings of this thesis extend the literature on positive deviance, pro-social and pro-customer behaviours. Second, the research provides an empirically tested model which describes the antecedents of COD. Third, this research contributes by providing a reliable and valid measure of COD. Finally, the research investigates the differential effects of the key antecedents in different service sectors on COD. The research findings also contribute to services marketing practice. Based on the research findings, service practitioners can better understand the phenomenon of COD and utilise the measurement tool to calibrate COD levels within their organisations. Knowledge on the key determinants of COD will help improve recruitment and training programs and drive internal initiatives within the firm...|$|E
