5|$|Unusual weather phenomena, such as {{snow and}} mist, fascinated Monet because they altered the {{chromatic}} appearance of familiar topography. In such paintings as The Magpie, one of Monet's early masterpieces, form dissolves under {{the combination of}} a greatly restricted color range, aerial perspective, and broken brushwork. A virtuoso color performance, the painting is an essay on the variations of white perceptible in the reflection of sun on crisp new snow. Wonderfully abstract passages of flat color, such as the strong violet shades <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence,</b> are divorced from the spatial realities of the objects portrayed.|$|E
25|$|Then Boycott and Edrich {{began to}} run what in the Tests had been 'impossible' runs, to play what had been 'impossible' strokes...the Australian out-fieldsmen were hurling {{themselves}} about <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> in a manner I had not seen for years in desperate endeavour to save fours and reduce runs.|$|E
25|$|The squad's third {{member was}} {{positioned}} near a road, and fired an RPG at an IDF jeep {{driven by a}} captain. After the captain returned fire, the militant fled towards a tunnel dug <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence,</b> throwing grenades. An IDF armored vehicle fired at him, but missed, and he escaped.|$|E

500|$|Secretariat's paddock at Claiborne Farm bordered {{three other}} stallions: Drone, Sir Ivor, and Hall of Fame inductee Spectacular Bid.

500|$|Lukić {{states that}} this figure, {{and the figure}} of 468 victims which is {{engraved}} on the monument {{to the victims of}} the camp in Jastrebarsko, are unreliable. He cites documentary evidence provided by the local gravedigger Franjo Ilovar, whose notes indicate a much higher mortality among the children. Ilovar lists a total of 768 burials of children at the Jastrebarsko cemetery, but Lukić points out that Ilovar was not the only gravedigger burying children, and further reports that Ilovar himself believed that the figure on the monument was too low. A survivor interviewed in 2010 quoted Ilovar as saying that he buried 1,018 children from the camp. One source states that 1,500 children died in the camp. [...] According to the records of the Croatian Red Cross, of the 1,507 Kozaran children brought to Jastrebarsko, 163 died. [...] When the children died, they were placed into empty sugar crates which were stacked <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> of the camp awaiting disposal.|$|E
2500|$|Finally the French {{reached a}} pagoda {{at the base}} of the dyke. [...] The Black Flags had {{evacuated}} the pagoda before the French arrived, and fallen back to the centre of their position, which lay behind the earth embankment of a dyke four hundred metres further on. [...] The Black Flags had crowned this embankment with a bamboo fence, and seven large and conspicuous black flags, embroidered in silver, flew side by side at regular intervals <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence.</b> [...] Behind the dyke Liu Yongfu had his headquarters in a small pagoda with a blue tiled roof. [...] The Black Flags had placed their few artillery pieces along the left and centre of this line, so that their fire could sweep the dyke path that led to their defences.|$|E

"'Tis all {{one with}} her--the Princess's silver neigh, the sheep bells of a frosty morn, the pretty Angora goats making silky {{pictures}} on the hillside all day long, the drifts of purple lupins <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>fences,</b> <b>the</b> long hot grass on slope and roadside, the summer-burnt hills tawny as crouching lions--and even have I seen the sheer sensuous pleasure of the Little Lady with bathing her arms and neck in the blessed sun." ...|$|R

2500|$|Gregg ordered Custer to counterattack {{with the}} 7th Michigan. Custer {{personally}} led the regiment, shouting [...] "Come on, you Wolverines!". Waves of horsemen collided in furious fighting <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> line on Rummel's farm. Seven hundred men fought {{at point-blank range}} across the fence with carbines, pistols and sabers. Custer's horse was shot out from under him, and he commandeered a bugler's horse. Eventually enough of Custer's men were amassed {{to break down the}} fence, and they caused the Virginians to retreat. Stuart sent in reinforcements from all three of his brigades: the 9th and 13th Virginia (Chambliss' Brigade), the 1st North Carolina and Jeff Davis Legion (Hampton's) and squadrons from the 2nd Virginia (Lee's). Custer's pursuit was broken, and the 7th Michigan fell back in a disorderly retreat.|$|E
2500|$|By April 1853, {{the entire}} [...] {{had been cleared}} of nearly all trees, and [...] of the site {{enclosed}} by a split-rail fence. [...] A boxwood hedge was planted <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence.</b> Of the enclosed area, [...] were ready for burials. The burial area was broken down into four sections (all of them with plots laid out), and [...] of road wound through the site. [...] A small gate {{was placed in the}} middle of the eastern side of the cemetery. Wells were dug to provide water to the site. Two circles were established in the cemetery. One of the smaller circles was on Main Drive near the Kinsman Avenue entrance, with another small circle to its west. A much larger circle was in the center of the cemetery, and officials intended to build a chapel there at a future date. A small mausoleum-like receiving vault, Gothic Revival in design, was built just east of the Kinsman Avenue entrance.|$|E
2500|$|Article 47 of the Albanian Criminal Code {{stated that}} to [...] "escape outside the state, {{as well as}} refusal {{to return to the}} Fatherland by a person who has been sent to serve or has been {{permitted}} temporarily to go outside the state" [...] was an act of treason, a crime punishable by a minimum sentence of ten years and a maximum sentence of death. The Albanian government went to great lengths in order to prevent people from defecting by fleeing the country:An electrically-wired metal fence stands 600 meters to one kilometer from the actual border. Anyone touching the fence not only risks electrocution, but also sets off alarm bells and lights which alert guards stationed at approximately one-kilometer intervals <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence.</b> Two meters of soil {{on either side of the}} fence are cleared in order to check for footprints of escapees and infiltrators. The area between the fence and the actual border is seeded with booby traps such as coils of wire, noise makers consisting of thin pieces of metal strips on top of two wooden slats with stones in a tin container which rattle if stepped on, and flares that are triggered by contact, thus illuminating would-be escapees during the night.|$|E
50|$|At the 1976 Universe Championships, Sugita {{finished}} {{first place in}} the short class and was the overall winner. On the day of the competition Sugita and two fellow countrymen and contestants, Kozo Sudo and Masashi Enomoto, posed for photographs in London's Hyde Park Square, an event which caused much interest to passers-by, who lined up <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>fences</b> to watch.|$|R

60|$|That was good, but Pan {{could not}} {{understand}} how they had ever accomplished it. Perhaps they had been keen enough {{to see that the}} wild horses would now {{have to go through the}} gateway or turn south <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence.</b>|$|E
6000|$|No voice replied, and, keeping Wayland's hand, {{she felt}} her way <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> till it {{revealed}} a gate; then she turned toward the roaring of the stream, which grew louder as they advanced.

60|$|The larger corral was not by {{any means}} round or level, and it was so big that the mass of horses in a far corner did not appear to cover a {{hundredth}} part of the whole space.

5000|$|Drift fences {{were used}} in the Texas Panhandle from 1882 to 1887 to control [...] "cattle drift"—the winter {{migration}} of livestock to warmer territory. Long sections of barbed wire fence were built by ranchers to keep the cattle from moving to the southern part of <b>the</b> state. This <b>fence</b> was disastrous for the animals during the winter of 1886-87. Deep snow covered the grasslands, and <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> prevented <b>the</b> herds from migrating to greener pastures. As a result, the cattle froze to death <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>fences.</b> Some 75 percent perished during the winter.|$|R

The animal turned, slunk <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence,</b> and disappeared behind a tree in front of the next house.|$|E
60|$|Pan and Blinky and Gus {{spread out}} to trot their mounts across the {{intervening}} space. The wild horses moved away <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence,</b> and halted to face about again. They let the riders {{approach to a}} hundred yards, then, with a trampling roar, they burst into action. Wild pointed noses, ears, heads, manes and flying hoofs and tails seemed to spread from a dark compact mass.|$|E

50|$|Vine Displays: Nearly every plant {{family has}} members with a vining or {{climbing}} habit. There are vining herbs, orchids, aroids, and even vining palms.

50|$|During {{the mating}} seasons of toads, frogs and {{salamanders}} in temperate climates, these animals {{often have to}} cross busy roads on their way from wintering grounds to breeding ponds. To prevent them from being killed, volunteers may place low <b>fences</b> <b>along</b> roads which <b>the</b> animals have to cross. On short distances, dry pitfall traps are then placed <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>fences</b> to collect <b>the</b> animals, which subsequently are manually transferred {{to the other side}} of the road, thus preventing massive roadkill.|$|R
