40|$|A {{treatability}} {{study was}} performed to develop and characterize an absorbent polymer waste form for application to low level (LLW) and mixed low level (MLLW) aqueous wastes at Argonne National Laboratory-West (ANL-W). In this study absorbent polymers proved effective at immobilizing <b>aqueous</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>wastes</b> {{in order to meet}} Land Disposal Restrictions for subsurface waste disposal. Treatment of aqueous waste with absorbent polymers provides an alternative to <b>liquid</b> <b>waste</b> solidification via high-shear mixing with clays and cements. Significant advantages of absorbent polymer use over clays and cements include ease of operations and waste volume minimization. Absorbent polymers do not require high-shear mixing as do clays and cements. Granulated absorbent polymer is poured into aqueous solutions and forms a gel which passes the paint filter test as a non-liquid. Pouring versus mixing of a solidification agent not only eliminates the need for a mixing station, but also lessens exposure to personnel and the potential for spread of contamination from treatment of radioactive wastes. Waste minimization is achieved as significantly less mass addition and volume increase is required of and results from absorbent polymer use than that of clays and cements. Operationa...|$|R

40|$|In {{the early}} 1980 's, AECL, at the Chalk River Laboratory (CRL) site, built a Waste Treatment Centre <WTC) for {{managing}} low level solid and <b>aqueous</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>wastes.</b> The {{objective was to}} demonstrate processes for converting Canadian Deuterium Uranium (CANDU) wastes to a form suitable for disposal while meeting or exceeding current environmental regulations. At present, two <b>liquid</b> <b>waste</b> streams are being treated at the Waste Treatment Centre. The <b>liquid</b> <b>waste</b> streams are volume reduced {{by a combination of}} continuous crossflow microfiltration (MF), spiral wound reverse osmosis (SWRO), and tubular reverse osmosis (TRO) membrane technologies [1]. The concentrate produced from the TRO system and the volume-reduced MF backwash solutions are evaporated while simultaneously adding bitumen in a thin-film evaporator. A water-free product of chemical and radiochemical salts and bitumen is removed in 200 L galvanized steel drums for storage and eventual disposal in the CRL Waste Management Area. The feed stream to the thin-film evaporator typically has a f 5 /y activity of about 1 - 3 jiCi/mL. This intermediate-level radioactive stream is concentrated by a factor of about 10, while simultaneously being immobilized. The radiation field of product drums on contact typically has a value of 0. 5 to 3 R/h depending upon the feed concentration of radioactivity to the evaporator. The total solids content in the 2 00 L drum ranges from 25 % to 35 %. Encapsulated in the bitumen matrix are a variety of non-radiochemical salts {including sodium phosphate, sodium sulphate, and sodium carbonate) which comprise the bulk of the total solids in the product drum. The drum contains less than 1 % of free water. The paper will discuss the volume reduction capability of the plant, with an emphasis on the immobilization of the aqueous waste with bitumen in a thin-film evaporator.

40|$|The {{radioactive}} waste management system at Cernavoda Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) in Romania was designed to maintain acceptable levels of safety for workers and to protect {{human health and the}} environment from exposure to unacceptable levels of radiation. In accordance with terminology of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), this system consists of the “pretreatment ” of solid and organic <b>liquid</b> radioactive <b>waste,</b> which may include part or all of the following activities: collection, handling, volume reduction (by an in-drum compactor, if appropriate), and storage. Gaseous and <b>aqueous</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>wastes</b> are managed according to the “dilute and discharge ” strategy. Taking into account the fact that treatment/conditioning and disposal technologies are still not established, waste minimization at the source is a priority environmental management objective, while waste minimization at the disposal stage is presently just a theoretical requirement for future adopted technologies. The necessary operational and maintenance procedures are in place at Cernavoda to minimize the production and contamination of waste. Administrative and technical measures are established to minimize waste volumes. Thus, an annual environmental target of a maximum 30 m 3 of {{radioactive waste}} volume arising from operation and maintenance has been established. Within the first five years of operations at Cernavoda NPP, this target has been met. The successful implementation of the waste minimization policy has been accompanied by a cost reduction while the occupational doses for plant workers have been maintained at as low as reasonably practicable levels.

40|$|Waste {{minimization}} in {{the automotive}} repair industry {{is characterized by}} the large numbers of small quantity generators (SQG) producing solvent, alkaline and detergent hazardous wastes. On-site management of multiple processes which vary {{depending on the size of}} shop make the administration of hazardous waste policies particularly complex. This paper presents the quantities and types of hazardous materials typically produced. Guidelines are presented to allow generators to organize a waste minimization program. The automotive repair industry is comprised of small quantity generators (SQG). These comprise the largest and heaviest producers of hazardous waste material of all SQGs. The two-year survey of small quantity generators of hazardous waste issued by EPA’s Office of Solid Waste (OSW) was released on March 12, 1985. It shows vehicle maintenance leading in numbers of generators (82, 530 of 175, 000) and highest in quantity of total waste produced (351, 500 tonslyear out of a total 760, 000 tonslyear) for SQGs. l SQGs produce less than one-half of one percent of the hazardous waste produced nationally. However, the sheer number of SQGs pose human health and environmental risks. EPA defines an SQG as generating at least 220 pounds but less than 2, 200 pounds of hazardous waste per month. The research performed to develop the industry characteristics used in this article is based upon the on-site audit of three specific sites.

40|$|The {{preparation}} of tungstate-containing glass–ceramic composites (GCC) {{for the potential}} immobilization of radio cesium has been considered. The GCC materials were prepared by blending two oxide precursor compositions in various proportions. These included a preformed Cs-containing hexagonal tungsten bronze (HTB) phase (Cs 0. 3 Ti 0. 2 W 0. 8 O 3, P 63 /mcm) and a blend of silica and other oxides. The use of the HTB phase was motivated {{on the assumption that}} a HTB-based adsorbent could be used to remove cesium directly from <b>aqueous</b> high level <b>liquid</b> <b>waste</b> feeds. In the absence of the HTB, glass–ceramics were relatively easily prepared from the Cs-containing glass-forming oxide blend. On melting the mixture a relative complex GCC phase assemblage formed. The principal components of this phase assemblage were determined using X-ray powder diffraction, 133 Cs MAS-NMR, and cross-sectional SEM and included glass, various zeolites, scheelite (CaWO 4) and a range of other oxide phases and Cs-containing aluminosilicate. Importantly, under no circumstance was cesium partitioned into the glass phase irrespective {{of whether or not the}} composition included the preformed Cs-containing HTB compound. For compositions containing the HTB, cesium was partitioned into one of four major phases including zeolite; Cs–silica–tungstate bronze, pollucite (CsAlSi 2 O 6), and an aluminosilicate with an Al/Si ratio close to one. The leach resistance of all materials was evaluated and related to the cesium distribution within the GCC phase assemblages. In general, the GCCs prepared from the HTB had superior durability compared with materials not containing tungsten. Indeed the compositions in many cases had leach resistances comparable to the best ceramics or glass materials. © 2009, Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
