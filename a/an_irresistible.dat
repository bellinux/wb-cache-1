5|$|Parasites {{can also}} be {{aggressive}} mimics, though the situation is somewhat different from those outlined previously. Some predators have a feature that draws prey; parasites can also mimic their host's natural prey, but are eaten themselves, a pathway into their host. Leucochloridium, a genus of flatworm, matures in the digestive system of songbirds, their eggs then passing out of the bird in the faeces. They are then taken up by Succinea, a terrestrial snail. The eggs develop in this intermediate host, and must then find a suitable bird to mature in. Since the host birds do not eat snails, the sporocyst has another strategy to reach its host's intestine. They are brightly coloured and move in a pulsating fashion. A sporocyst-sac pulsates in the snail's eye stalks, coming to resemble <b>an</b> <b>irresistible</b> meal for a songbird. In this way, it can {{bridge the gap between}} hosts, allowing it to complete its life cycle. A nematode (Myrmeconema neotropicum) changes the colour of the abdomen of workers of the canopy ant Cephalotes atratus to make it appear like the ripe fruits of Hyeronima alchorneoides. It also changes the behaviour of the ant so that the gaster (rear part) is held raised. This presumably increases the chances of the ant being eaten by birds. The droppings of birds are collected by other ants and fed to their brood, thereby helping to spread the nematode.|$|E

25|$|Tics are {{described}} as semi-voluntary or unvoluntary, {{because they are not}} strictly involuntary—they may be experienced as a voluntary response to the unwanted, premonitory urge. A unique aspect of tics, relative to other movement disorders, is that they are suppressible yet irresistible; they are experienced as <b>an</b> <b>irresistible</b> urge that must eventually be expressed.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{motivation}} {{of his body}} development was not health, but self-defence.

25|$|With diabolical help, Cambrinus wins {{a fortune}} in games of skill and chance, becomes <b>an</b> <b>irresistible</b> player of the carillon, and becomes the first mortal to brew beer. Cambrinus' music and beer make him very famous, and {{eventually}} {{the king of the}} Netherlands heaps titles of nobility on him: Duke of Brabant, Count of Flanders, Lord of Fresnes. But even after founding the town of Cambrai, Cambrinus prefers the villagers' honorary title for him: King of Beer. When Flandrine finally approaches him, he rejects her.|$|E
25|$|In 1894 Lockwood and Richardson, {{with their}} pace and sharp break-back, were <b>an</b> <b>irresistible</b> {{combination}} {{on the many}} treacherous wickets. Lockwood's bowling reached its highest point, though, against Yorkshire at the Oval when Richardson was injured: he took 7 for 94 on a very true pitch to win the match that decided the Championship. Lockwood's batting did not suffer from the advance of his bowling: indeed he frequently opened with Bobby Abel in 1894 and scored over 900 runs under the most difficult conditions. After demolishing Kent on a perfect batting wicket in the last match at The Oval, he and Richardson were chosen to tour Australia.|$|E
25|$|On {{his first}} tour, Lohmann moved even further {{ahead of the}} pack as a bowler. In the Second Test at the SCG, Lohmann became the first bowler to take eight wickets in a Test innings, and in the {{abnormally}} dry summer of 1887 showed himself far ahead of any other bowler – taking 154 wickets when the next best was 114. He also made his highest score as a batsman, scoring 115 against Sussex at Hove, whilst his aggregate of runs for the season totalled 843. Lohmann again toured Australia {{in the winter of}} 1887/1888, and with Johnny Briggs formed <b>an</b> <b>irresistible</b> combination in the only Test match on a sticky wicket.|$|E

25|$|In {{traditional}} Islamic societies, {{love between}} men and women was widely celebrated, and both the popular and classical literature of the Muslim world is replete with works on this theme. Throughout Islamic history, intellectuals, theologians and mystics have extensively discussed the nature and characteristics of romantic love (ishq). In its most common intellectual interpretation of the Islamic Golden Age, ishq refers to <b>an</b> <b>irresistible</b> desire to obtain possession of the beloved, expressing a deficiency that the lover must remedy in order to reach perfection. Like the perfections of the soul and the body, love thus admits of hierarchical degrees, but its underlying reality is the aspiration to the beauty which God manifested in the world when he created Adam in his own image.|$|E
25|$|Tattersall, however, bowled in {{excellent}} form for Lancashire {{right up to}} 1957; taking 100 County Championship wickets every year except 1956, when after <b>an</b> <b>irresistible</b> start, he unaccountably lost form. In the wet summer of 1958. he failed to reach 100 wickets {{for the first time}} since 1949. The eminent Lancashire cricket writer, John Kay, felt Tattersall the victim of inconsistent policy at Old Trafford. In 1956, he was left out in mid-season, a move that probably cost the County the championship. Nonetheless, it was a surprise to see Tattersall and Malcolm Hilton dropped at the beginning of 1959, for the leg-spinner Tommy Greenhough. Although Tattersall was recalled at the beginning of the 1960 season, he did not do well enough to keep his place after May.|$|E
25|$|We assume in {{accordance}} with that case that the corrective process supplied by the State may be so adequate that interference by habeas corpus {{ought not to be}} allowed. It certainly is true that mere mistakes of law {{in the course of a}} trial are not to be corrected in that way. But if the case is that the whole proceeding is a mask—that counsel, jury and judge were swept to the fatal end by <b>an</b> <b>irresistible</b> wave of public passion, and that the State Courts failed to correct the wrong, neither perfection in the machinery for correction nor the possibility that the trial court and counsel saw no other way of avoiding an immediate outbreak of the mob can prevent this Court from securing to the petitioners their constitutional rights.|$|E

25|$|The Byzantine {{attack was}} fierce {{and it was}} not long before the Bulgarians began slowly to retreat. The Byzantine cavalry charged the {{infantry}} in the centre killing many Bulgarians. The Bulgarian position became desperate as they could not manage to hold the heights to the south of the river and began a hasty retreat to the north. Elated, the Byzantines started a bitter chase and their battle formations soon began to break, especially as a rumour spread that their commander, Leo Phocas, had been killed. At this point, Simeon, who had detected the disarray in the Byzantine formation, ordered his army to stand, and, at the head of his heavy cavalry corps, attacked the Byzantine left wing from behind the hills. With <b>an</b> <b>irresistible</b> onslaught the cavalry bore down at the confused enemy who immediately bent under their attack, panicked and took to their heels.|$|E
25|$|Olsen captained the Danish {{team that}} {{qualified}} for the 1984 European Championship; Denmark's first international tournament participation since the 1972 Olympics. Denmark reached the semi-finals, before being eliminated by Spain on penalty shootout. In October 1985, Olsen became the second Dane, after Per Røntved, to play 75 national team matches. He captained Denmark at the 1986 World Cup, Denmark's first World Cup participation, which ended in a second round defeat to Spain. Olsen's most noticeable effort at the tournament came in the 2–0 group stage win against West Germany. He took the ball from his own half and made <b>an</b> <b>irresistible</b> dribbling run that was only stopped by a foul in the West German penalty area, with Jesper Olsen scoring the 1–0 goal on the resulting penalty kick. Olsen was identified {{as one of the}} overall top performers at the World Cup, and he was subsequently named 1986 Danish Player of the Year.|$|E
25|$|Ibrahimović {{started his}} third Inter season {{by winning the}} Supercoppa Italiana against Roma. After the regular and extra time had {{finished}} in a draw, the match went to a penalty shootout where he successfully converted his penalty attempt. He scored his team's only goal in the 2008–09 Serie A opening match against Sampdoria, which finished in a 1–1 draw. On 4 October, during the match against Bologna at home which Inter won 2–1, Ibrahimović scored a sensational goal, stunning Francesco Antonioli with <b>an</b> <b>irresistible</b> backheeled shot from Adriano's left-wing cross. The goal was later voted Goal of the Year in Serie A. On 19 October 2008, Ibrahimović continued with his solid performances by scoring twice in an impressive 4–0 win at Roma, taking his tally up to five league goals. He then scored another double in the Matchday 12 win against Palermo to help Inter {{take the lead in}} the Serie A table by one point. In the next fixture, Ibrahimović provided the assist on the only goal in the Derby d'Italia match against Juventus at home, helping Inter to extend their league lead.|$|E
