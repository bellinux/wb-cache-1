2500|$|Regarding the {{unification}} of Romania and Moldova, Klaus Iohannis declared during the 2014 presidential campaign that {{the unification}} is something that only Bucharest can provide and only Chișinău can accept. [...] "If Moldovan citizens want the unification with Romania, then nobody can stop them", stated Klaus Iohannis. After election, his position mitigated, stressing that, at the moment, Romania should support Moldova to consolidate its pro-European path. President Klaus Iohannis said that a possible unification of Romania and Moldova could be discussed at the moment things <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>well</b> and stable in the two countries.|$|E

[...] With two of his friends from the post office, he was charged with tampering with the official telegraph and arrested in 1893. He claimed that the message in question was to his girlfriend. The Jewish girl came forward to defend him. Sentenced to two years in jail, he was pardoned but exiled to Salonica as a postal clerk.|$|E

60|$|But it {{was about}} the dog I wished to speak more particularly. He had {{commenced}} innocently enough, trying to catch a sparrow. Nothing delights a sparrow more than being chased by a dog. A dozen times he thought he had the sparrow. Then another dog had got in his way. I don't know what they call this breed of dog, but abroad it is popular: it has no tail and looks like a pig--when things <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>well</b> with it. This particular specimen, when I saw him, looked more like part of a doormat. The fox-terrier had seized it by the scruff of the neck and had rolled it over into the gutter just in front of a motor cycle. Its owner, a large lady, had darted out to save it, and had collided with the motor cyclist. The large lady had been thrown some half a dozen yards against an Italian boy carrying a tray load of plaster images.|$|E

6000|$|... "Things <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>well,</b> Clinton. I {{have bought}} the two riding camels. I {{was a whole}} day haggling over the price with the chief. I had to pay a stiff price after all, but that I expected. But it won't come quite so heavy, {{because he wanted to}} take it out in goods, and as we don't mean to take all the things back to the coast again, I got an order from the chief for our quarter-master's {{department}} to sell me a lot of rugs, cooking pots, and tin goods, and also some powder and ball and a dozen muskets. As I get them cheap the camels won't cost you more than half what they would if you had had to pay in silver for them. In the next place, the sheik arrived yesterday afternoon and I had a long talk with him. He is willing enough to undertake the business and to wander about with you for as many months as you may choose, and to assist you in getting off your brother if you find him, if he thinks that you can disguise yourself well enough to pass as a native, but of that he is to be the judge. He won't take you at any price unless you satisfy him in that respect." ...|$|E
