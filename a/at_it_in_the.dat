5|$|In 1981, Bantam Books {{published}} a movie tie-in novelization written by Mike McQuay that adopts a lean, humorous style {{reminiscent of the}} film. The novel is significant because it includes scenes that were {{cut out of the}} film, such as the Federal Reserve Depository robbery that results in Snake's incarceration. The novel provides motivation and backstory to Snake and Hauk— both disillusioned war veterans— deepening their relationship that was only hinted <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film. The novel explains how Snake lost his eye during the Battle for Leningrad in World War III, how Hauk became warden of New York, and Hauk's quest to find his crazy son who lives somewhere in the prison. The novel fleshes out the world that these characters exist in, at times presenting a future even bleaker than the one depicted in the film. The book explains that the West Coast is a no-man's land, and the country's population is gradually being driven crazy by nerve gas as a result of World War III.|$|E
5|$|The poem is in {{many ways}} deeply Christian, with {{frequent}} references to the fall of Adam and Eve and to Jesus Christ. Scholars have debated the depth of the Christian elements within the poem by looking <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of the age in which it was written, coming up with varying views as to what represents a Christian element of the poem and what does not. For example, some critics compare Sir Gawain to the other three poems of the Gawain manuscript. Each has a heavily Christian theme, causing scholars to interpret Gawain similarly. Comparing it to the poem Cleanness (also known as Purity), for example, they see it as a story of the apocalyptic fall of a civilisation, in Gawain's case, Camelot. In this interpretation, Sir Gawain is like Noah, separated from his society and warned by the Green Knight (who is seen as God's representative) of the coming doom of Camelot. Gawain, judged worthy through his test, is spared the doom of the rest of Camelot. King Arthur and his knights, however, misunderstand Gawain's experience and wear garters themselves. In Cleanness the men who are saved are similarly helpless in warning their society of impending destruction.|$|E

500|$|Taking place 0.3mya, {{the second}} {{eruption}} {{was the most}} extensive. It was probably between [...] and [...] in volume and extended past the reaches of the caldera, down the adjacent foothills. Beyond the caldera, the eruptive products are poor in phenocrysts (unlike those of the first eruption). They are instead rich in lithic material, which makes {{up as much as}} 10percent of the rock in parts (50percent {{at the base of the}} caldera). As the first of the ash was deposited, it accumulated in layers that formed quickly and resisted erosion, but only partially melded together. However, except for these basal layers and thin zones where the ash was devitrified (loses the properties of a glass and becomes brittle), the entire sheet is melded together. Inside Calabozos, the ash resisted welding and contains more phenocrysts. Instead, erosion ate away <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of acid leaching, and broke down much of its pumice content. Still, the rock layer here contains five to 30percent phenocrysts, and has high levels of devitrification and lithic content.|$|E
500|$|Writing for The Washington Post, Allison Stewart {{opined that}} the track {{describes}} an eccentric night of romance, beginning with [...] "a body full of liquor with a cocaine kicker" [...] {{and ending with}} [...] "you and me/Making love like gorillas". She concluded, [...] "for all its awfulness" [...] the song is the [...] "image shifter Mars needs". Idolator's Emily Tan commented [...] "the libidinous lyrics are disguised with epic guitars and Phil Collins-esque heavy drum combinations...strong enough to soundtrack a scene in a drama series". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard magazine similarly felt that the [...] "drums and keyboards are nicely overwhelming, but the overall concept floats {{too far away to}} make a dent on the listener". Day Hyman of Spin thought that the lyrics on the album [...] "desperately needed kick in the pants" [...] mainly noticed on [...] "Gorilla". He also drew comparisons on the [...] "Prince-channeling" [...] vibe. On the critical side, Amy Dawson of Metro described it as a [...] "Phil Collins-esque low point" [...] in the album, [...] "in which the button-eyed singer makes plans to go <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same way as said giant ape, all over a Phil Collins-esque synth/percussion combo backing… {{but by the time the}} jungle noises kick in, you think he surely must be in on the joke." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{film was}} one of the few foreign-language {{pictures}} to be presented in the BBC's program Current Release; former war correspondent Matthew Halton was invited to comment on it. The American magazine Variety described it as [...] "The Russian answer to the many American and British films about the war... having some contemporary significance, in the light of the tensions between the West and the Soviet Union." [...] The New York Times' critic dubbed it as a [...] "deafening blend of historical pageantry and wishful thinking... directed as if his (Chiaureli's) life depended upon it" [...] and – in what author David Caute claimed was the worse condemnation which could be leveled <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> day – that it had a [...] "Hollywood-style plot". He also disapproved of the historical veracity of the Yalta Conference scene, while John Howard Lawson, recently released from prison, praised it as an authentic depiction of events.

2500|$|On 24 April, the FA handed Suárez a 10-match ban, after a three-man {{independent}} committee {{agreed that}} the standard three match ban was insufficient. In their written reasons, the FA pointed to Suárez's lackadaisical attitude to the whole incident, citing that he [...] "had not fully appreciated the gravity and seriousness of this truly exceptional incident". They also argued that [...] "these unsavoury pictures would have given a bad image of English football domestically and across the world alike", {{and that it would}} act as a deterrent to further behaviour. Suárez ruled out an appeal, citing recognition of his actions being unacceptable and that it would give [...] "the wrong impression" [...] if he did so. Rodgers launched a strong defence of his player stating that [...] "when you look <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cold light of day then it was violent conduct... he made a mistake and he's got a sanction which I don't believe fits with what he did". Rodgers also launched a broadside on the FA and their handling of the case, claiming [...] "prejudices" [...] against the FA led to the lengthy ban, and also pointed out alleged inconsistencies in the prior punishment of players who have bitten another human being, giving the lack of punishment Jermain Defoe received for biting Javier Mascherano in 2006 as an example. After the ban was imposed, Ivanović finally accepted Suárez's apology. Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was reminded of Eric Cantona's suspension in 1995 for kicking a racist Crystal Palace spectator, and showed empathy toward the situation, saying [...] "I think back to Cantona and I have to say that a nine-month ban doesn't equate to a 10-match, does it? I can understand how Liverpool are aggrieved at it, I must say that".|$|E
2500|$|Costume {{designer}} Stephanie Maslansky {{returned from}} the same role on Daredevil and Jessica Jones. Like the main characters of those shows, Cage has his own wardrobe evolution throughout the season after his initial look of T-shirts, jeans, leather jackets or an army jacket was introduced in Jessica Jones. The series opted to depict Cage in a Trayvon Martin-inspired hoodie, but introduces the character's classic costume for a brief flashback. Colter said that the costume, designed in the blacksploitation era, [...] "is not made for serious moments", but the series was able to poke fun <b>at</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> brief scene, with Cage saying [...] "You look like a damn fool" [...] to himself when wearing it. In looking {{to pay homage to}} Cage's original costume with his updated clothing, Maslansky and Coker considered [...] "the idea of him wearing a gold hoodie, a gold T-shirt, but those just seemed too on the nose, and just too bright for a guy who is trying to keep his identity quiet." [...] Instead, Maslansky lined the insides of all of Cage's hoodies with yellow, so the color could frame the character's face in close ups. In contrast to Cage's hoodie, with jeans and T-shirts, many of the series' villains wear well-tailored suits. Stokes does this because he wants to present himself as [...] "a wealthy, successful businessman", and wears a lot of suits from Dolce & Gabbana and Zegna. One of his suits for the show was custom made. To pay homage to the comic character, Maslansky dressed Ali in a green suit for his introduction, using a [...] "subtle shade of green" [...] to avoid being [...] "flamboyant". The character subsequently is always wearing a [...] "subtle piece of green", like emerald earrings for one costume. The designer noted that many of these elements would not be noticed by the audience, but they made a difference to Ali when he was getting into character. For the character Shades, brands such as Hugo Boss, Helmut Lang, Prada, and Ferragamo were used [...] "because he wasn't trying to hide who he was", while Misty Knight, in her final shot of the season, is shown wearing a version of her own iconic comic costume. That look includes leather pants and an [...] "interesting cold-shoulder"-shaped top; a cream-colored top that fit that shape was found and dyed red for the scene.|$|E
