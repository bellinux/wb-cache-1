In some species these structures are hollow {{and connected to}} poison-producing cells, functioning like a hypodermic needle. Generally most hairs are only irritating, but some are dangerous to the eyes and respiratory tract, and some can cause severe skin necrosis and shedding.

25|$|Some drives (such as VASIMR or electrodeless plasma thruster) <b>actually</b> <b>can</b> {{significantly}} vary their exhaust velocity. This {{can help}} reduce propellant usage or improve acceleration {{at different stages of}} the flight. However the best energetic performance and acceleration is still obtained when the exhaust velocity is close to the vehicle speed. Proposed ion and plasma drives usually have exhaust velocities enormously higher than that ideal (in the case of VASIMR the lowest quoted speed is around 15000m/s compared to a mission delta-v from high Earth orbit to Mars of about 4000m/s).|$|E
25|$|Imbrication of the rectus muscles over a nonintegrated implant {{traditionally}} {{was thought}} to impart movement to the implant and prosthesis. Like a ball-and-socket joint, when the implant moves, the prosthesis moves. However, because the so-called ball and socket are separated by layers of Tenon’s capsule, imbricated muscles, and conjunctiva, the mechanical efﬁciency of transmission of movement from the implant to the prosthesis is suboptimal. Moreover, {{the concern is that}} imbrication of the recti over nonintegrated implants <b>actually</b> <b>can</b> result in implant migration. The recent myoconjuctival technique of enucleation is an alternative to muscle imbrication.|$|E

25|$|It {{was also}} claimed that special {{relativity}} cannot handle acceleration, which {{would lead to}} contradictions in some situations. However, this assessment is not correct, since acceleration <b>actually</b> <b>can</b> be described {{in the framework of}} special relativity (see Acceleration (special relativity), Proper reference frame (flat spacetime), Hyperbolic motion, Rindler coordinates, Born coordinates). Paradoxes relying on insufficient understanding of these facts were discovered {{in the early years of}} relativity. For example, Max Born (1909) tried to combine the concept of rigid bodies with special relativity. That this model was insufficient was shown by Paul Ehrenfest (1909), who demonstrated that a rotating rigid body would, according to Born's definition, undergo a contraction of the circumference without contraction of the radius, which is impossible (Ehrenfest paradox). Max von Laue (1911) showed that rigid bodies cannot exist in special relativity, since the propagation of signals cannot exceed the speed of light, so an accelerating and rotating body will undergo deformations.|$|E

Director Ram Gopal Varma called Manam an [...] "avant garde product but {{deeply rooted in}} earth" [...] and [...] "the first {{constructive}} demonstration that Tollywood <b>actually</b> <b>can</b> go into a new age of cinema". He added that both Nagarjuna and Vikram deserved multiple salutes for making a film like Manam, and the only tragedy was that Nageswara Rao was not alive to see this film, which Varma termed an [...] "astounding celebration of human emotions". Ram Charan called Manam a film that induces [...] "Love, joy, passion, hatred, excitement and almost every feeling you can imagine and more". Kamal Haasan watched the film on 29 May 2014, at a special screening in Chennai. Haasan became emotional and could not control his tears. Regarding this, he said [...] "I {{have always been a}} fan of ANR and this film has brought back very fond memories. I turned emotional when I saw ANR on the big screen.

Vance C. McCormick (an economic adviser of Wilson) emphasized this point, and stated: [...] "...the preamble is useful. We are adopting an unusual method in not fixing a definite sum. The preamble tends to explain this, and further, prepares the public mind for disappointment as to what <b>actually</b> <b>can</b> be secured." [...] In 1940, Dulles stated that he was surprised that the article [...] "could plausibly be, and in fact was, considered to be a historical judgement of war guilt". He further noted that the [...] "profound significance of this article... came about through accident, rather than design". Dulles took it personally that the Treaty of Versailles failed in its intentions of creating a lasting peace and believed that the treaty was one of the causes of the Second World War. By 1954, as United States Secretary of State and in discussion with the Soviet Union in regards to German reunification, he commented that [...] "Efforts to bankrupt and humiliate a nation merely incite a people of vigor and of courage to break the bonds imposed upon them.... Prohibitions thus incite the very acts that are prohibited." ...|$|E
