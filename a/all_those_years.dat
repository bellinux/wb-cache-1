Najibullah still hung on to the presidency, so in June 1990 he renamed the party the Homeland Party. The party dropped the Marxist-Leninist ideology that had been held previously by the PDPA.|$|E

25|$|From 1881 through 1941, {{demographic}} data shows India had excess males overall in <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>years.</b> The gender difference was particularly high in north and western regions of India, {{with an overall}} sex ratio– males per 100 females– of between 110.2 and 113.7 in the north over the 60-year period, and 105.8 to 109.8 males for every 100 female in western India for all ages. Visaria states that female deficit among Muslims was markedly higher, next only to Sikhs.

25|$|After Mickey dies in 2010, Maggie {{begins a}} new {{friendship}} with Victor Kiriakis. The two grow closer, despite Victor's marriage to Vivian Alamain. The vengeful Vivian plots to have Maggie entombed in a crypt in the Kiriakis mausoleum, but as fate has it, ends up there herself. When Vivian is freed, {{she manages to}} entrap Maggie, and for days, her relatives are worried about her absence. Eventually, Victor finds her and she is rushed to the hospital. Maggie is stunned when she discovers that Victor knew Vivian was entrapped and did nothing about it. After Victor demands a divorce from Vivian, he begins to court Maggie. She struggles to accept Victor and his criminal past, but is able to build a relationship with him. Maggie and Victor begin to date and Victor proposes to Maggie in September 2011. During their engagement, Hope comes across a letter from Alice to Maggie, written the day before Alice died. Alice reminds Maggie about an experimental program she and Mickey entered into over thirty years prior, Maggie had attempted to harvest some of her eggs. Eventually she and Mickey abandoned the project, though the eggs were preserved. It was revealed that Daniel Jonas was her biological son, a product of these missing eggs. This also makes Melanie Layton her granddaughter. On November 8, 2011, Victor and Maggie get married. That Christmas Julie tells Maggie that she {{will always be a}} member of the Horton family, and extends an ornament to Victor, Daniel, and Melanie, despite their not being biological Hortons. In 2012, Maggie and Victor experience brief marital trouble when it is revealed that Victor knew about Maggie's missing eggs <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>years.</b> Maggie was eventually able to forgive him although she continues to keep him in line when his ruthless ways get the better of him. Maggie also said goodbye to Melanie, who left town. Additionally, Maggie opened her home to her nephew, Nick Fallon, Marie's grandson, who was recently paroled. Though Maggie has a new husband, son, granddaughter, and home, she is considered to be the matriarch of the Horton Family and still maintains a relationship with the members of the Horton family.In February 2016 her son Daniel Jonas was injured in a car accident that also injured Eric Brady, Brady Black and Jennifer Horton. He eventually dies from his injuries and Maggie makes the decision to take Daniel off Life Support and donate his heart to her Step-Grandson Brady. Maggie's life began to get more complicated when a young woman named Summer showed up in Salem and informed her that she was the child Maggie had when she was only 17 and had believed to be stillborn. In the middle of all of this, Victor's estranged brother, Deimos, showed up, vowing revenge against Victor. He poisoned Maggie with pills that caused her to have dizzy spells. After one serious dizzy spell, Maggie fell down the stairs in the Kiriakis mansion, was rushed to the hospital, where Victor was informed that not only had she broken her back, but that her legs were once again paralyzed, like they had been when she had first met Mickey. Victor learned that Deimos had poisoned her and had an antidote which he would give Maggie on the condition that Victor turn all his assets over to him. Determined to save Maggie from instant death, Victor agreed. Maggie's recovery seemed more psychological than physical, but with support from her husband and the Horton's, Maggie became encouraged to fight to walk once again, and Victor declared his determination to stand by her in her time of need, even deciding to retire from Titan to devote all of his time to her.|$|E

40|$|Objective Following the {{licensure}} of 23 -valent {{pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine}} (23 vPPV) in 1989, a risk-group–only immunization {{policy was}} implemented in 1992 in England. The PPV programme was extended in 2003 to include all individuals 65 years and over. In England, this was phased in over 3 years. To ascertain {{the performance of the}} risk group policy in <b>those</b> 65 <b>years</b> of age and over and provide a baseline to estimate the impact of the universal elderly programme. Methods Information was gathered on vaccine uptake for the period 1989 – 2003 in England from a national survey of general practitioners (GPs) through NHS primary care trusts (PCTs), the prescription cost analysis (PCA) system and the General Practice Research Database (GPRD). Results Between 1991 and 2003, 4. 5 million doses of PPV were prescribed. The GP survey found that by 2003, 29 % of <b>those</b> 65 <b>years</b> and over of age and 36 % of <b>those</b> 80 <b>years</b> of age over had received PPV. Sixty-two per cent of general practices had implemented a risk-group–only policy, 14. 4 % had targeted <b>all</b> <b>those</b> 65 <b>years</b> of age over and 14. 2 % had targeted <b>all</b> <b>those</b> 75 <b>years</b> of age over. The GPRD study found that 38 % of <b>those</b> 65 <b>years</b> over and 41 % of <b>those</b> 80 <b>years</b> over fell into one or more high-risk groups. By 2003, 36. 6 % of the high-risk group and 30. 2 % of <b>all</b> <b>those</b> 65 <b>years</b> over had ever been vaccinated. Vaccine uptake increased with age, with 52. 3 % of the high-risk group and 37 % of <b>all</b> <b>those</b> 80 <b>years</b> over having ever been vaccinated.
