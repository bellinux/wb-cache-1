25|$|Tentative {{evidence}} supports {{the use of}} <b>amisulpride</b> to treat dysthymia but with increased side effects.|$|E
25|$|A 2014 meta {{analysis}} of 9 published trials having minimum duration 6 months and median duration 52 weeks concluded that olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone had better effects on cognitive function than <b>amisulpride</b> and haloperidol.|$|E
25|$|In a 2013 {{study in}} a {{comparison}} of 15 antipsychotic drugs in effectiveness in treating schizophrenic symptoms, clozapine was ranked first, demonstrating very high effectiveness. 25% more effective than <b>amisulpride</b> (2nd), 33% more effective than olanzapine (3rd), and twice as effective as haloperidol, quetiapine, and aripiprazole.|$|E
25|$|Because of dysthymia's chronic nature, {{treatment}} {{resistance is}} somewhat common. In such a case, augmentation is often recommended. Such treatment augmentations can include lithium pharmacology, thyroid hormone augmentation, <b>amisulpride,</b> buspirone, bupropion, stimulants, and mirtazapine. Additionally, {{if the person}} also suffers from seasonal affective disorder, light therapy {{can be useful in}} helping augment therapeutic effects.|$|E
25|$|Olanzapine has {{a higher}} {{affinity}} for 5-HT2A serotonin receptors than D2 dopamine receptors, which is a common property of most atypical antipsychotics, aside from the benzamide antipsychotics such as <b>amisulpride</b> along with the non-benzamides aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, blonanserin, cariprazine, melperone and perospirone. Olanzapine also had the highest affinity of any second-generation antipsychotic towards the P-glycoprotein in one in vitro study. P-glycoprotein transports a myriad of drugs across a numerous of different biological membranes (found in numerous body systems) including the blood-brain barrier (a semi-permeable membrane which filters the contents of blood prior to it reaching the brain); P-GP inhibition could mean that less brain exposure to olanzapine results from this interaction with the P-glycoprotein. A relatively large quantity of commonly encountered foods and medications inhibit P-GP, and it is fairly common for pharmaceuticals to be either substrates of P-GP, or to inhibit its action; both substrates and inhibitors of P-GP effectively increase the permeability of the blood brain barrier to P-GP substrates and subsequently increase the central activity of the substrate while reducing the local effects on the GI tract. The mediation of olanzapine in {{the central nervous system}} by P-GP means that any other substance or drug which interacts with P-GP increases the risk for toxic accumulations of both olanzapine and the other drug.|$|E
500|$|The {{choice of}} which {{antipsychotic}} to use {{is based on}} benefits, risks, and costs. It is debatable whether, as a class, typical or atypical antipsychotics are better. <b>Amisulpride,</b> olanzapine, risperidone, and clozapine {{may be more effective}} but are associated with greater side effects. Typical antipsychotics have equal drop-out and symptom relapse rates to atypicals when used at low to moderate dosages. There is a good response in 40–50%, a partial response in 30–40%, and treatment resistance (failure of symptoms to respond satisfactorily after six weeks to two or three different antipsychotics) in 20% of people. Clozapine is an effective treatment for those who respond poorly to other drugs ("treatment-resistant" [...] or [...] "refractory" [...] schizophrenia), but it has the potentially serious side effect of agranulocytosis (lowered white blood cell count) in less than 4% of people.|$|E
2500|$|Antipsychotics: {{increased}} risk of ventricular arrhythmias with <b>amisulpride,</b> sertindole, or pimozide (avoid with pimozide) if hypokalemia occurs; enhanced hypotensive effect with phenothiazines ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2013 {{comparison}} of 15 antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenia, olanzapine was ranked third. It was 5% {{more effective than}} risperidone (4th), 24-27% more effective than haloperidol, quetiapine, and aripiprazole, and 33% less effective than clozapine (1st). A 2013 review of first episode schizophrenia concluded that olanzapine is superior to haloperidol in providing a lower discontinuation rate, and in short-term symptom reduction, response rate, negative symptoms, depression, cognitive function, discontinuation due to poor efficacy, and long-term relapse, but not in positive symptoms or on the Clinical Global Impressions score. In contrast, pooled second generation antipsychotics showed superiority to first generation antipsychotics only against the discontinuation, negative symptoms (with a much larger effect seen among industry- compared to government-sponsored studies), and cognition scores. [...] Olanzapine caused less extrapyramidal side effects, less akathisia, but caused significantly more weight gain, serum cholesterol increase, and triglyceride increase than haloperidol. A 2012 review concluded that among 10 atypical antipsychotics, only clozapine, olanzapine, and risperidone were better than first generation antipsychotics. A 2011 review concluded that neither first- nor second generation antipsychotics produce clinically meaningful changes in Clinical Global Impression scores but found that olanzapine and <b>amisulpride</b> produce larger effects on the PANSS and BPRS batteries than five other second generation antipsychotics or pooled first generation antipsychotics. A 2010 Cochrane systematic review found that olanzapine may have a slight advantage in effectiveness when compared to aripiprazole, quetiapine, risperidone and ziprasidone. No differences in effectiveness was detected when comparing olanzapine to <b>amisulpride</b> and clozapine.|$|E

50|$|Neither is it {{recommended}} to use <b>amisulpride</b> {{in patients with}} hypersensitivities to <b>amisulpride</b> or the excipients found in its dosage form.|$|E
50|$|Though it {{has long}} been widely assumed that dopaminergic {{modulation}} is solely responsible for the respective antidepressant and antipsychotic properties of <b>amisulpride,</b> it has recently been shown that it also acts as a potent antagonist at the 5-HT7 receptor. Several of the other atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone and ziprasidone are potent antagonists at the 5-HT7 receptor as well, and selective antagonists of the receptor show antidepressant properties themselves. To characterize the role of the 5-HT7 receptor in the antidepressant effects of <b>amisulpride,</b> a study prepared 5-HT7 receptor knockout mice. The study found that in two widely used rodent models of depression, the tail suspension test, and the forced swim test, those mice did not exhibit an antidepressant response upon treatment with <b>amisulpride.</b> These results suggest that 5-HT7 receptor antagonism mediates the antidepressant effects of <b>amisulpride.</b>|$|E
50|$|In a 2013 {{study in}} a {{comparison}} of 15 antipsychotic drugs in effectiveness in treating schizophrenic symptoms, <b>amisulpride</b> was ranked second, demonstrating high effectiveness. 11% more effective than olanzapine (3rd), 32-35% more effective than haloperidol, quetiapine, and aripiprazole, and 25% less effective than clozapine (1st). Although according to other studies {{it appears to have}} comparable efficacy to olanzapine in the treatment of schizophrenia. <b>Amisulpride</b> augmentation, similarly to sulpiride augmentation, has been considered a viable treatment option (although this is based on low-quality evidence) in clozapine-resistant cases of schizophrenia. Another recent study concluded that <b>amisulpride</b> is an appropriate first-line treatment for the management of acute psychosis.|$|E

50|$|<b>Amisulpride</b> {{function}} {{primarily as}} a D2 and D3 receptor antagonist. It has high affinity for these receptors with dissociation constants of 2.2 nM and 2.4 nM, respectively. Although standard doses used to treat psychosis inhibit dopaminergic neurotransmission, low doses preferentially block inhibitory pre-synaptic autoreceptors. This results in a facilitation of dopamine activity, and for this reason, low dose <b>amisulpride</b> has also been used to treat dysthymia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Amisulpride</b> and its {{relative}} sulpiride {{have been shown}} to bind to and activate the GHB receptor at doses that are used for therapeutic purposes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Amisulpride</b> {{also appears}} to bind with high {{affinity}} to the 5-HT2B receptor (see below table), though the clinical implications of this, if any, are unclear.|$|E
50|$|Torsades de pointes {{is common}} in overdose. <b>Amisulpride</b> is {{moderately}} dangerous in overdose (with the TCAs being very dangerous and the SSRIs being modestly dangerous).|$|E

5000|$|Sedation (causes less {{sedation}} {{than most}} antipsychotic drugs {{according to a}} recent meta-analysis of the efficacy and tolerability of 15 antipsychotic drugs. Causes only slightly non-significantly more sedation than <b>amisulpride</b> and paliperidone) ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Amisulpride,</b> {{like all}} other {{approved}} antipsychotics, is believed to work by reducing signalling via the dopamine D2 receptor. In amisulpride's case this is by blocking, or antagonizing, the receptor. Amisulpride's effectiveness in treating dysthymia and the negative symptoms of schizophrenia is believed to stem from its blockade of the presynaptic dopamine D2 receptors. These presynaptic receptors regulate the release of dopamine into the synapse, so by blocking them <b>amisulpride</b> increases dopamine concentrations in the synapse. This increased dopamine concentration is theorized to act on dopamine D1 receptors to relieve depressive symptoms (in dysthymia) and the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.|$|E
50|$|A 2014 meta {{analysis}} of 9 published trials having minimum duration 6 months and median duration 52 weeks concluded that olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone had better effects on cognitive function than <b>amisulpride</b> and haloperidol.|$|E
50|$|<b>Amisulpride</b> is not {{approved}} by the Food and Drug Administration {{for use in the}} United States, but it is used in Europe (France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Russia, United Kingdom, etc.), Israel, India, New Zealand and Australia (TGA approved in February 2002) to treat psychosis and schizophrenia.|$|E
50|$|In a 2013 {{study in}} a {{comparison}} of 15 antipsychotic drugs in effectiveness in treating schizophrenic symptoms, clozapine was ranked first, demonstrating very high effectiveness. 25% more effective than <b>amisulpride</b> (2nd), 33% more effective than olanzapine (3rd), and twice as effective as haloperidol, quetiapine, and aripiprazole.|$|E
50|$|It {{is unclear}} whether the {{atypical}} (second-generation) antipsychotics offer advantages over older, first generation antipsychotics. <b>Amisulpride,</b> olanzapine, risperidone and clozapine {{may be more effective}} but are associated with greater side effects. Typical antipsychotics have equal drop-out and symptom relapse rates to atypicals when used at low to moderate dosages.|$|E
50|$|<b>Amisulpride</b> {{should not}} be used in {{conjunction}} with drugs that prolong the QT interval (such as citalopram, venlafaxine, bupropion, clozapine, tricyclic antidepressants, sertindole, ziprasidone, etc.), reduce heart rate and those that can induce hypokalaemia. Likewise it is imprudent to combine antipsychotics due to the additive risk for tardive dyskinesia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome.|$|E

50|$|The benzamide neuroleptics (including sulpiride, <b>amisulpride,</b> and sultopride) {{have been}} shown to {{activate}} the endogenous gamma-hydroxybutyrate receptor in vivo at therapeutic concentrations.

5000|$|Since his committal Hunt {{has been}} {{forcibly}} medicated with a {{diverse range of}} psychoactive drugs including the typical antipsychotics zuclopenthixol and chlorpromazine, the atypical antipsychotic <b>amisulpride,</b> benzodiazepines and sleeping tablets.

The hospital authorities at Carraig Mór considered Hunt a 'chronic' patient and 'suitable' for long-term hospitalisation.|$|E
50|$|Tiapride is a {{drug that}} {{selectively}} blocks D2 and D3 dopamine receptors in the brain. It is used to treat a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders including dyskinesia, alcohol withdrawal syndrome, negative symptoms of psychosis, and agitation and aggression in the elderly. A derivative of benzamide, tiapride is chemically and functionally similar to other benzamide antipsychotics such as sulpiride and <b>amisulpride</b> known for their dopamine antagonist effects.|$|E
50|$|Sultopride (trade names Barnetil, Barnotil, Topral) is an {{atypical}} antipsychotic of the benzamide {{chemical class}} used in Europe, Japan, and Hong Kong {{for the treatment}} of schizophrenia. It was launched by Sanofi-Aventis in 1976. Sultopride acts as a selective D2 and D3 receptor antagonist. It has also been shown to have clinically relevant affinity for the GHB receptor as well, a property it shares in common with <b>amisulpride</b> and sulpiride.|$|E
5000|$|Amisulpride‡- Selective {{dopamine}} antagonist. Higher doses (greater than 400 mg) {{act upon}} post-synaptic dopamine receptors {{resulting in a}} reduction in the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as psychosis. Lower doses, however, act upon dopamine autoreceptors, resulting in increased dopamine transmission, improving the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Lower doses of <b>amisulpride</b> have also been shown to have antidepressant and anxiolytic effects in non-schizophrenic patients, leading to its use in dysthymia and social phobias.|$|E
5000|$|Neuroleptic Induced Deficit Syndrome is a {{clinical}} syndrome that develops {{in some patients}} who take high doses of an antipsychotic for an extended time. [...] It is most often caused by high-potency typical antipsychotics, but can also be caused by high doses of many atypicals, especially those closer in profile to typical ones (that have higher D2 dopamine receptor affinity and relatively low 5-HT2 serotonin receptor binding affinity), like risperidone and <b>amisulpride.</b>|$|E
