5|$|There is {{continuing}} critical {{debate about the}} status of the poem as it is now available to us. While some scholars accept the texts of the Hymn as more or less accurate transmissions of Cædmon's original, others <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> originated as a back-translation from Bede's Latin, and that there is no surviving witness to the original text.|$|E
5|$|From 1911 to 1917, {{money was}} {{collected}} for interior furnishings, which were relatively sparse {{apart from the}} impressive main altar. (These original furnishings remained until the 1930s.) Parts of the draft plan were abandoned: the floor was not constructed from marble as intended, but poured from plain concrete; outside there were no pinnacles on the façade. Writings vary on when the pinnacles were built: some claim they were built in 1923, but others <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were not completed until the renovation of the cathedral in 1999. Observers that argue for an earlier construction date state that they were damaged during World WarII and left dismantled for some time.|$|E
5|$|Keeping {{elephants}} in zoos {{has met with}} some controversy. Proponents of zoos <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> offer researchers {{easy access to the}} animals and provide money and expertise for preserving their natural habitats, as well as safekeeping for the species. Critics claim that the animals in zoos are under physical and mental stress. Elephants have been recorded displaying stereotypical behaviours in the form of swaying back and forth, trunk swaying, or route tracing. This has been observed in 54% of individuals in UK zoos. Elephants in European zoos appear to have shorter lifespans than their wild counterparts at only 17 years, although other studies suggest that zoo elephants live as long those in the wild.|$|E

Van Seters stated his position as follows: ...|$|R

ARI is also {{highly critical of}} diversity and affirmative action programs, as well as multiculturalism, <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are based on racist premises that ignore the commonality of a shared humanity.|$|R

5|$|The DPP {{argued that}} it was never the {{intention}} of The Chaser to breach security and that they were allowed into the restricted area only because of the mistakes of the police. The laws enacted for the summit meant that entry into the restricted zone needed justification, which could include police permission. The DPP stated that by waving The Chaser through, they had granted permission to be in the restricted zone. A further defence was available: all members charged, except Morrow, could <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were present for work-related purposes, and part of their employment was to be with Morrow, who was directing the stunt.|$|E
5|$|The {{two heads}} at Tres Zapotes, with the La Cobata head, are stylistically {{distinct}} from the other known examples. Beatriz de la Fuente views them as a late regional survival of an older tradition while other scholars <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are merely the kind of regional variant to be expected in a frontier settlement. These heads are sculpted with relatively simple headdresses; they have squat, wide proportions and distinctive facial features. The two Tres Zapotes heads are the earliest known stone monuments from the site. The discovery {{of one of the}} Tres Zapotes heads in the nineteenth century led to the first archaeological investigations of Olmec culture, carried out by Matthew Stirling in 1938.|$|E
5|$|Aggrieved {{persons who}} cannot avail {{themselves}} of the protection afforded by Article 12(2) may try to <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are {{a member of a}} group defined by a law in a way that violates Article 12(1). The rational nexus test, also known as the doctrine of reasonable classification, is a three-stage test formulated by the courts to determine if the manner in which a law classifies a group of persons is discriminatory. The equality guaranteed by the provision is a relative and not an absolute concept; it does not require that all persons are treated alike, but rather that all persons in like situations should be treated alike. Consequently, a law that differentiates between classes of persons is valid and constitutional provided that there is some difference in circumstances, and the factor which the legislature adopts as constituting the dissimilarity in circumstances is not purely arbitrary but bears a reasonable relation to the legislative object of the law. If there is no such relationship, the difference is discriminatory and the impugned legislation is unconstitutional and invalid.|$|E
500|$|The Publishers Weekly {{reviewer}} {{is critical}} of Dyer's illustrations, <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> do not provide the two dogs with sufficiently differing personalities. The reviewer calls the illustrations [...] "pretty and sweet", but <b>argues</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are too understated in their depiction of the dogs going on improbable adventures, such as snorkeling at the beach and riding in a hansom cab in Manhattan.|$|R

5|$|Contemporary jury {{consultants}} {{are often}} sociologists, people {{with experience in}} communications and marketing, or attorneys themselves, but they are most frequently psychologists and specialize in legal psychology. Although most of the practice's roots are in criminal trials, modern jury consultants are more often involved in torts (civil litigation), particularly where wealthy corporate defendants fear an enormous monetary judgment for the plaintiff, or where plaintiffs’ attorneys have invested {{large sums of money}} in an important lawsuit. Since the 1980s, large jury consulting and trial consulting firms have sprouted up with multi-million dollar incomes, mostly from such high-stakes civil litigation. The simultaneous shift from ad-hoc groups of academics to a business model has sparked the criticism that SJS magnifies the distorting effect money has on trials, since only the wealthy can afford it. Jury consultants <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> operate in an adversarial process the same way lawyers do; by pursuing their clients' interests in a rule-bound framework. Jeffrey Abramson, who has written extensively about juries, argues that even if SJS is ethical or has zero effect, the mere myth of powerful, effective jury manipulators shakes public confidence in the jury system.|$|E
5|$|In late 1944, the Australian Government {{committed}} twelve Australian Army brigades {{to replace}} six US Army divisions which were conducting defensive roles in Bougainville, New Britain and the Aitape-Wewak area in New Guinea. While the US units had largely conducted a static defence of their positions, their Australian replacements mounted offensive operations designed {{to destroy the}} remaining Japanese forces in these areas. The value of these campaigns was controversial {{at the time and}} remains so to this day. The Australian Government authorised these operations for primarily political reasons. It was believed that keeping the Army involved in the war would give Australia greater influence in any post-war peace conferences and that liberating Australian territories would enhance Australia's influence in its region. Critics of these campaigns <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were unnecessary and wasteful of the lives of the Australian soldiers involved as the Japanese forces were already isolated and ineffective.|$|E

However, most areas with significant natural sea bottom disturbance events are in relatively shallow water. In mid to deep waters, bottoms trawlers are the only significant area-wide events.|$|E
