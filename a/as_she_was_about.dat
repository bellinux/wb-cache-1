5|$|HMS Audacious {{was ordered}} on 29 April 1867 from Robert Napier in Govan, Glasgow. She was laid down on 26 June 1867 and {{launched}} on 27 February 1869 in a gale. The winds caught {{the rear of}} the ship <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> halfway down the slipway and twisted her enough that some plates and frames of her bottom were damaged. The ship was completed on 10 September 1870 and commissioned the following month. She cost £256,291 to build.|$|E
25|$|Olympic, like Titanic, did {{not carry}} enough {{lifeboats}} for everyone on board, {{and so was}} hurriedly equipped with additional, second-hand collapsible lifeboats following her return to Britain. Towards the end of April 1912, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> to sail from Southampton to New York, 284 of the ship's firemen went on strike, for fear that the ship's new collapsible lifeboats were not seaworthy. 100 non-union crew were hastily hired from Southampton as replacements, with more being hired from Liverpool.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, she {{appeared}} in the film Onegin. <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> to begin preview performances in a Broadway revival of Anouilh's Ring Round the Moon, Worth had a stroke and never appeared in the production. She continued to act, however, right up until September 2001, when one of her last appearances was with Paul Scofield at the Almeida Theatre in the two-handed play, I Take Your Hand in Mine, by Carol Rocamora based on the love letters of Anton Chekhov and Olga Knipper.|$|E

25|$|Cornwallis {{was built}} {{probably}} at Surat and around 1789. Her name was originally Britannia, {{but it was}} changed to Cornwallis shortly before her completion. She served for some years in India as a country ship, before transferring her registry to Britain in 1797. She then served in private trade between Britain and India until 1809 or so when she transferred her registry back to Bombay. Thereafter she served as a country ship, though in both 1810 and again in 1817 she performed a voyage to Britain for the British East India Company. Thereafter she apparently continued {{to serve as a}} country ship with homeport of Bombay. She burnt there in June 1841 <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> to take a cargo of cotton to China.|$|E
25|$|In 1999 Fergus {{came under}} {{suspicion}} of assaulting Minnie's boyfriend Oscar Henry (Christopher Brown) {{and he and}} Minnie reunited in the aftermath. Fergus cheated on her however and purchased the local bar in 2000 before he started to date Waverley Wilson (Claire Chitham) amongst speculation he was a drug dealer. The two got engaged and to make money for the wedding, Fergus became involved in an illegal immigration scam. On his wedding day, police came to arrest him at the altar and he fled Ferndale, leaving a devastated Waverley behind him. He returned and apologized to Waverley before fleeing police yet again. In 2002 Fergus returned when he kidnapped Waverley <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> to marry Nick Harrison (Karl Burnett). He attempted to reconcile with her but to no avail. After giving his blessing, Fergus escaped police {{with the help of}} his friends.|$|E
500|$|Although {{they later}} split from Sanger over charges of {{insufficient}} support, Goldman and Reitman distributed copies of Sanger's pamphlet Family Limitation (along {{with a similar}} essay of Reitman's). In 1915 Goldman conducted a nationwide speaking tour in part to raise awareness about contraception options. Although the nation's attitude toward the topic seemed to be liberalizing, Goldman was arrested on February 11, 1916, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> to give another public lecture. Goldman was charged with violating the Comstock Law. Refusing to pay a $100 fine, Goldman spent two weeks in a prison workhouse, which she saw as an [...] "opportunity" [...] to reconnect with those rejected by society.|$|E

500|$|In contrast, a French poet at Mary's court, Pierre de Boscosel de Chastelard, was {{apparently}} besotted by Mary. In early 1563, he was discovered during a security search hidden underneath her bed, apparently planning to surprise {{her when she}} was alone and declare his love for her. Mary was horrified and banished him from Scotland. He ignored the edict, and two days later he forced his way into her chamber <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> to disrobe. She reacted with fury and fear, and when Moray rushed into the room, in reaction to her cries for help, she shouted, [...] "Thrust your dagger into the villain!", which Moray refused to do, as Chastelard was already under restraint. Chastelard was tried for treason, and beheaded. Maitland claimed that Chastelard's ardour was feigned, and that he was part of a Huguenot plot to discredit Mary by tarnishing her reputation.|$|E
500|$|Czolgosz {{had lived}} on his parents' farm near Cleveland {{beginning}} in 1898, working little—he may {{have suffered a}} nervous breakdown. [...] He {{is known to have}} attended a speech by anarchist Emma Goldman in May 1901 in Cleveland: [...] he approached her before the speech and asked her to recommend books on anarchism; she obliged. [...] The talk, in which Goldman did not advocate violence but expressed understanding for those driven to it, was a great influence on Czolgosz; he later stated that her words burned in his head. [...] He came to see her at her Chicago home in July <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> to depart on a trip with her daughter to Buffalo to see the fair, and the two anarchists rode together to the train station. [...] Goldman expressed concern to another radical that Czolgosz (who was using the alias Fred Nieman) was following her around; soon after, he apparently departed Chicago. [...] William Arntz, a worker at a park in Canton, stated that he had seen a man resembling Czolgosz in mid-1901, when the President was staying at home and sometimes visiting the park. [...] The man was wearing two guns, and when Arntz reminded him that firearms were not permitted outside the park's shooting range, responded dismissively. [...] Arntz sought the police, but the man was never found.|$|E
500|$|Batwoman {{appears in}} the miniseries Cry for Justice, a set-up for a new ongoing Justice League title. When the Justice League of America splits up {{following}} Bruce Wayne's death and a disastrous confrontation with the Shadow Cabinet, Green Lantern Hal Jordan leads a group of superheroes to Gotham in order {{to track down the}} supervillain known as Prometheus. Kate is shown stalking the heroes from the rooftops after they encounter Clayface. Batwoman later contacts both Leagues at the JLA Watchtower, informing them she encountered and engaged supervillain Delores Winters, who mysteriously collapsed and died right <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> to be taken into custody. The heroes request that Kate bring the body up to them, but she declines, telling them that she is much too busy due to a rash of criminal uprisings going on in Gotham. Firestorm is then sent to retrieve the corpse from Kate and bring it to the team, who discover that Dolores was forced into fighting by means of a mind control device. In a text piece included in [...] #6, writer James Robinson revealed that Batwoman was initially intended to be part of his new Justice League line-up, but this plan fell apart after Cry For Justice was shortened into a miniseries rather than an ongoing title. This explains why Batwoman is present {{on the cover of the}} first issue, and why she was initially said to be a member of the team when the book was first announced.|$|E

2500|$|Also in 1989, Summer told The Advocate {{magazine}} that [...] "a {{couple of the}} people I write with are gay, {{and they have been}} ever since I met them. What people want to do with their bodies is their personal preference." [...] A couple of years later, she filed a lawsuit against New York magazine when it reprinted the rumors as fact just <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> to release her album Mistaken Identity in 1991.

2500|$|In Greek mythology, Callisto or Kallisto ( [...] ; [...] ) was a nymph, or the {{daughter}} [...] of King Lycaon; the myth varies in such details. [...] She {{was one of}} the followers of Artemis, or Diana for the Romans, who attracted Zeus (Jupiter). [...] He transformed himself into the figure of Artemis and seduced her in this disguise. [...] She fell pregnant and this was eventually discovered and expelled from [...] Artemis's group, after which a furious Hera (Juno, wife of her seducer) transformed her into a bear. [...] Later, just <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> to be killed by her son when he was hunting, she was set among the stars as Ursa Major ("the Great Bear"). [...] She was the bear-mother of the Arcadians, through her son Arcas.|$|E
2500|$|The Roman Catholic Church views Mary as {{the woman}} clothed with the sun in the Book of Revelation 12:1–3: [...] "A great and wondrous sign {{appeared}} in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head. She was pregnant and cried out in pain <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> to give birth. Then another sign appeared in heaven: an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on his heads." [...] The Church accepts Revelation 12 as a reference to Mary, Israel, and the Church as a three-fold symbolism through the Book of Isaiah and affirms Mary {{as the mother of}} Jesus as the prophetic fulfilment described in Revelation 12 (cf. Isaiah 7:14, 26:17, 54:1, 66:7).|$|E

On a restricted basement level of the company situated beneath the Thames Barrier was a secret laboratory which the Institute used to recreate ancient [...] "Huon particles". Over a period of months, H. C.

2500|$|On 1 October 1766, Sophia Magdalena {{was married}} to Gustav by proxy at Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen with her brother Frederick, Hereditary Prince of Denmark as {{representative}} of her groom. She traveled in the royal golden sloop from Kronborg in Denmark over Öresund to Hälsingborg in Sweden; when she was halfway, the Danish cannon salute ended, and the Swedish started to fire. In Helsingborg, she was welcomed by her brother-in-law Prince Charles of Hesse, who had crossed the sea shortly before her, the Danish envoy in Stockholm, Baron Schack, as well as Crown Prince Gustav. <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> to set foot on ground, Gustav was afraid that she would fall, and he therefore reached her his hand with the words: [...] "Watch out, Madame!", a reply which quickly became a topic of gossip at the Swedish court.

She met her father-in-law the King and her brothers-in-law at Stäket Manor on 27 October, and she continued to be well-treated and liked by them all during her life in Sweden. Thereafter, she met her mother-in-law the Queen and her sister-in-law at Säby Manor, and on the 28th, she was formally presented for the Swedish royal court at Drottningholm Palace. At this occasion, Countess Ebba Bonde noted that the impression about her was: [...] "By God, how beautiful she is!", but that her appearance was affected {{by the fact that}} she had a: [...] "terrible fear of the Queen".
