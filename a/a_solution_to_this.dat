By moving in 1893 to South Africa he found <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> problem and developed the central concepts of his mature philosophy.|$|E
5|$|For VTOL {{operations}} {{the aircraft}} {{was expected to}} sit pointed up, supported by long landing legs that extended out of the spine. Landing would be accomplished {{at a very high}} angle, making visibility during the approach very difficult. A number of other VTOL experiments of the era attempted various solutions to this problem, including rotating pilots seats and cockpits, but none proved very effective. Another problem with various VTOL experiments was that stability in a hover was difficult to arrange, although not entirely unexpected. <b>A</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> problem would require the thrust to be directed downward from a larger area, as it is in a helicopter, where the lift is supplied over the entire area of the rotor disk. Most designers turned to bleeding off air from the engine's compressor, and directing that through pipes arranged around the aircraft. Frost's engine design used such a large number of nozzles that such an arrangement would not be to easy to build.|$|E

5|$|Often, castles {{constructed}} {{before the}} age of gunpowder were incapable of using guns as their wall-walks were too narrow. <b>A</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> was to pull down the top of a tower and to fill the lower part with the rubble to provide a surface for the guns to fire from. Lowering the defences in this way had the effect of making them easier to scale with ladders. A more popular alternative defence, which avoided damaging the castle, was to establish bulwarks beyond the castle's defences. These could be built from earth or stone and were used to mount weapons.|$|E
5|$|The docks {{maintenance}} {{facility was}} established {{on the land}} exposed by the damming of the river to construct the harbour and remains sited at this location to the present day. William Jessop had created a weir in the dam at Underfall to allow surplus water to flow back into the New Cut, this {{was known as the}} 'Overfall'. By the 1830s, the Floating Harbour was suffering from severe silting. Isambard Kingdom Brunel was, however, able to devise <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> problem. In place of the Overfall he advised better use of three shallow sluices and one deep scouring sluice between the harbour and the New Cut, together with a dredging vessel. This drag boat would scrape the silt away from the quay walls. When the deep sluice opened at low tide, a powerful undertow sucked the silt into the river to be carried away on the next tide. The shallow sluices enabled adjustment of the dock water level according to weather conditions.|$|E

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> {{problem is}} that delayed instantiation: no {{substitution}} is applied until one that closes all branches {{at the same time}} is found. With this variant, a proof for an unsatisfiable set can always be found by a suitable policy of application of the other rules.

Although the process is only about 50% efficient, and half the original laser power is lost, the resulting ultraviolet light couples much more efficiently to the target plasma and is much more effective in collapsing the target to high density.|$|E

25|$|In general, many {{alternative}} functional forms {{can appear}} {{to follow a}} power-law form for some extent. Also, researchers usually {{have to face the}} problem of deciding whether or not a real-world probability distribution follows a power law. As <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> problem, Diaz proposed a graphical methodology based on random samples that allow visually discerning between different types of tail behavior. This methodology uses bundles of residual quantile functions, also called percentile residual life functions, which characterize many different types of distribution tails, including both heavy and non-heavy tails.|$|E

The karmic effects of the human deeds lie dormant, as seeds, until they germinate in this or a next life. Not an individual self, but these karmic seeds are the base for the generation of a following life.|$|E

25|$|They key {{appeared}} to be to use smaller vehicles, which reduced {{the size of the}} entire system; stations, tracks and switches all took up less room and cost less to build. However, smaller vehicles also have lower passenger capacities, a problem for rush hour periods. In the 1960s <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> problem was becoming practical; using automated guideway transit (AGT) technologies, the cars could be made to run much closer together to improve capacity. Their small size and lack of a driver would improve economics; payrolls amount to 60% to 70% of the operating costs of traditional transportation systems.|$|E
25|$|Smallholding farmers {{not only}} {{frequently}} lack access to markets, they lack {{access to resources}} that lead to sustainable cocoa farming practices. Lack of sustainability can be due to pests, diseases that attack cocoa trees, lack of farming supplies, and {{lack of knowledge about}} modern farming techniques. One issue pertaining to cocoa plantation sustainability is the amount of time it takes for a cocoa tree to produce pods. <b>A</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> is to change the type of cocoa tree being farmed. In Ghana, a hybrid cocoa tree yields two crops after three years rather than the typical one crop after five years.|$|E
