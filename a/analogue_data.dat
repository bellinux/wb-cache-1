50|$|Digital {{reproduction}} is {{one form of}} data reproduction {{which is based on}} the digital data model. The advantage of digital reproduction of data over analogue {{reproduction is}} its lossless quality. Reproducing <b>analogue</b> <b>data</b> is inherently lossy, because every (electronic) component involved in any analogue reproduction process can introduce noise to the final result.|$|E
50|$|Whenever an {{electronic}} device transmits digital (and sometimes <b>analogue)</b> <b>data</b> to another, {{there must be}} a certain rhythm established between the two devices, i.e., the receiving device must have some way of, {{within the context of the}} fluctuating signal that it's receiving, determining where each unit of data begins and where it ends.|$|E

Changes in position and motion are monitored and can be recorded with an optoelectronic camera and a tape recorder.|$|E
50|$|BIM can {{potentially}} offer some benefit for managing stratified cadastral spaces in urban built environments. The first benefit would be enhancing visual communication of interweaved, stacked and complex cadastral spaces for non-specialists. The rich amount of spatial and semantic information about physical structures inside models can aid comprehension of cadastral boundaries, providing an unambiguous delineation of ownership, rights, responsibilities and restrictions. Additionally, using BIM to manage cadastral information could advance current land administration systems from a 2D-based and <b>analogue</b> <b>data</b> environment into a 3D digital, intelligent, interactive and dynamic one. BIM could also unlock {{value in the}} cadastral information by forming a bridge between that information and the interactive lifecycle and management of buildings.|$|E

50|$|France {{developed}} the Flaman Speed Indicator and Recorder. In Germany, the Indusi train protection system had included recording equipment from early on using a ticker tape on paper. For I60R a generalized recorder system was installed (Datenspeicherkassette DSK / data storage cassette) that {{allowed to enter}} the train number, driver info, train weight along with the driving events. The standardized DSK black box allows for approximately 30,000 km of general recording data and 90 km of detailed recording data. Later models of the DSK are electronic especially since {{the introduction of the}} computerized PZ80/PZB90 train protection generations.Modern Train Event Recorders follow International or National Standards like IEEE Std. 1482.1-1999, FRA 49 CFR Part 229, IEC 62625-1 etc. specifying the digital and <b>analogue</b> <b>data</b> to be acquired, recorded and transmitted for further analysis. The need for event recorders to sustain an accident has led to companies like Faiveley (France), Hasler Rail (Switzerland), Bach-Simpson (USA), Saira Electronics (Italy) FAR Systems, MIOS Elettronica (Italy) to develop crash protected memory modules as a part of their event recorders. These new generation event recorders have growing demand both for rapid transit systems and mainline trains, in Europe, United States,India, etc.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, caller ID {{information}} {{is sent to}} the called party by the telephone switch as an <b>analogue</b> <b>data</b> stream (similar to data passed between two modems), using Bell 202 modulation {{between the first and second}} rings, while the telephone unit is still on hook. If the telephone call is answered too quickly after the first ring, caller ID information will not be transmitted to the recipient. There are two types of caller ID, number only and name+number. Number-only caller ID is called Single Data Message Format (SDMF), which provides the caller's telephone number, the date and time of the call. Name+number caller ID is called Multiple Data Message Format (MDMF), which in addition to the information provided by SDMF format, can also provide the directory listed name for the particular number. Caller ID readers which are compatible with MDMF can also read the simpler SDMF format, but an SDMF caller ID reader will not recognize an MDMF data stream, and will act as if there is no caller ID information present, e.g. as if the line is not equipped for caller ID.|$|E
50|$|The main {{objective}} of American {{participation in the}} Kosmos 1667 mission was to measure carotid artery pressure and blood flow during the inflight period. The United States provided all flight and ground support instrumentation for this experiment. Raw <b>analogue</b> <b>data</b> from flight and ground control experiments {{was transferred to the}} Cardiovascular Research Laboratory at the NASA Ames Research Center for analysis. Hemodynamic data was to be correlated with concurrently recorded Soviet data. A similar correlative study was performed during the Cosmos 1514 mission, where blood flow velocity was compared to total body cardiac output as determined by impedance cardiography. Two rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) named Gordyy and Oomka were flown on board the biosatellite. Each animal weighed approximately 8.8 lb. Both were instrumented for Soviet neurophysiology studies. The instruments consisted of bilaterally implanted microelectrodes in the vestibular nuclei, and electro-oculogram and electroencephalogram electrodes. Monkeys were housed in Soviet BIOS capsules, as for the Kosmos 1514 mission. U.S. hardware developed for the Kosmos 1514 cardiovascular experiment was used again on this mission. A barometric pressure recorder mounted in the primate capsule was used to correct and normalise the implanted pressure sensor to 760 mm Hg.|$|E
40|$|The present {{invention}} allows an IEEE 802. 11 {{receiver to}} operate on two alternative physical layers.

40|$|Polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) {{thin film}} {{transistor}} (TFT) technology is very suitable for driving an active matrix LCD (AMLCD) panel as the driver circuit, and the panel can be integrated on the same substrate. This allows the entire display system to be thin and makes the concepts of `TV on wall' and `sheet computer' possible.

This paper focuses on with the (DFN) modelling of natural fractures associated to strike-slip faults crosscutting tight carbonates, which are exposed along vertical walls and pavements of an inactive quarry of the Murge area, southern Italy. The studied outcrops expose the inner structure of two conjugate fault zones striking WNW-ESE and NNW-SSE, respectively. DFN models were built according to the spatial and dimensional properties computed for the natural fracture network. The results of these models show that the overall fault permeability is 3 -to- 4 orders of magnitude higher than the host rock permeability. The fault damage zones form the main fluid conduits, with the highest permeability values computed for fault-parallel fluid flow. Such a pronounced permeability anisotropy obtained for the fault damage zone is mainly related to the fracture dimension, both lengths and heights, and their aperture values...|$|R
