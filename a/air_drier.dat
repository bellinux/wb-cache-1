This is why an important part of the industry is focused on the treatment and drying of the fish, for optimal preservation of food. This final Master s Thesis is focused on performing a simulation to calculate and define the parameters that involve the drying process. The parameters in the drying process can be designed and controlled to achieve the best performance of the drying process, so that the final product achieves the desired quality within an economically suitable production. The drying process studied in this work is a combined process of a hot <b>air</b> <b>drier</b> and a hot air source heat pump, so the process can be optimized when the outdoor temperatures are not adequate for the drying. It has been observed throughout the simulations that the optimal parameters for the drying process are high temperatures and low relative humidity of the hot air and high air velocity. These parameters achieve higher drying rates. The values of such parameters are limited according to quality of the product, heat pump and energy requirements, economic aspects, etc. The results of these simulations have been compared to actual experimental work.

40|$|Abstract—Recently,the {{interest}} in purple sweet potato has increased {{due to its}} high nutrients content. In order to improve the drying quality of purple sweet potato, in this study, response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize operating conditions of the purple sweet potato in a hot <b>air</b> <b>drier</b> and quadratic polynomial regression models {{were used for the}} optimization. Optimization factors were slice thickness(2 - 6 mm), air velocity(1 - 2 m/s) and temperature(45 - 55 ℃) while investigated responses were energy consumption per unit mass, value of chromatism and loss rate of anthocyanins and comprehensive assessment. The order of strength of the factors affecting the drying process and the best value of factors when drying purple sweet potato were determined to obtain. The order was found to be air velocity first, temperature second, and then slice thickness and the best values of factors were found to be slice thickness of 5. 11 mm with air velocity of 1. 88 m/s for the temperature of 55 ℃. At this the best point, the responses were found of 0. 073 KWh/g, 12. 88, 22. 20 %, 0. 96, respectively. This study provides a theoretical basis for further study on hot-air drying equipment and technology for purple sweet potato.

40|$|International audienceA {{field survey}} {{was carried out}} in seven newly built {{energy-efficient}} houses in France. Several indoor air-quality indicators (total volatile organic compounds, volatile organic compounds, aldehydes, carbon monoxide, particulate matter less than 2. 5 micrometre in diameter (PM 2. 5) and radon) and indoor environmental parameters (carbon dioxide, temperature, relative humidity and noise) were measured before and during the houses' first year of occupancy. The air exchange per hour (ACH) and air exhaust rate were measured simultaneously, and the perceptions of the occupants were evaluated with a questionnaire. The results show that the levels of aromatic hydrocarbons, terpenes, alkanes and aldehydes were higher before occupancy than during occupancy, whereas the opposite trend was observed for PM 2. 5. During occupation, the concentrations of acetaldehyde, alpha-pinene, ethylbenzene, limonene, styrene, toluene and xylenes decrease, most likely because of the decrease in emissions sources from houses. At the same time, the levels of benzene, formaldehyde, hexaldehyde, n-decane and n-undecane temporarily increase because of human activities. The PM 2. 5 levels show seasonal variation. Compared to standard French houses, the concentrations of benzene, ethylbenzene, m- and p-xylenes, PM 2. 5 and radon were low, whereas the CO 2 and formaldehyde levels were not significantly different. In contrast, the levels of acetaldehyde, hexaldehyde, n-decane, n-undecane, oxylene and styrene were higher in these new homes, possibly because of the emissions from products and materials. Mechanical ventilation with heat-recovery systems allows for ACH levels of 0. 5 h- 1 or higher, making the <b>air</b> <b>drier.</b> Shortcomings of the system are also reported...|$|E

The MICs values of essential oils and water extract observed good antibacterial activity against {{the growth of the}} studied bacteria. This suggests that the essential oil as well as water extract of WBs have a potential effect for use in food and/or pharmaceutical industries. Several compounds have been identified from essential oil, methanol, dichloromethane and water extracts of Schinus molle L. wood branch by GC/MS analysis. Some of the identified compounds have been reported to possess various biological activities such as antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antialdosteronic, antihepatotoxic, anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive, antiophidic, antiencephalopathic, antigastritic, antiprostatitic, antipruritic, and hypocholesterolemic. The presence of various bioactive compounds justifies the use of wood branches for various ailments by traditional practitioners. The yield of the essential oils from wood branch is 0.75  mL/ 100  g fresh weight, while in our previous works, it was 0.40  mL/ 100  g leaves fresh weight [35] and, from berries, was 4.26  mL/ 100  g berries fresh weight (unpublished data) or 0.49  % v/w from dried fruits (36  °C in a forced <b>air</b> <b>drier</b> with humidity control) [54].

Two post-silanization <b>air</b> <b>drying</b> temperatures, 23 °C and 60 °C, were applied. A cylindrical plastic matrix was placed around the silanized post and filled with composite resin. Each bonded post provided 7 slices for push-out testing. Each slice was loaded to failure under compression at a cross-head speed of 0. 5 mm/min. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA and Scott-Knott tests (α= 0. 05). Dunnett's {{test was used to}} compare the mean of the control group with that of each experimental group.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} thorough <b>air</b> <b>drying</b> on the static and dynamic bonding effectiveness of a HEMA-free all-in-one adhesive bonded to Class- 1 cavity-bottom dentin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: G-Bond (GC, Japan) was applied to standard occlusal Class I cavities following either a gentle (1 bar) or strong (4 bar) air-drying technique. After restoring the cavity using a composite resin (Gradia Anterior, GC), microspecimens were prepared that were loaded until failure or inserted in a microrotary fatigue testing device. RESULTS: Strong <b>air</b> <b>drying</b> had no effect on the static (39. 1 vs. 38. 4 MPa) or the dynamic (19. 0 vs. 18. 6 MPa) strength of the interface complex. CONCLUSION: Strong <b>air</b> <b>drying</b> did not improve the static or the dynamic bonding effectiveness, although a very thorough (4 bar) and long air-drying procedure was employed.
