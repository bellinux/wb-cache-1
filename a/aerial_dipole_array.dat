40|$|This book {{focuses on}} {{determination}} of scattering of parallel-fed planar <b>dipole</b> <b>arrays</b> {{in terms of}} reflection and transmission coefficients {{at different levels of}} the array system. In aerospace vehicles, the phased arrays are often in planar configuration. The radar cross section (RCS) of the vehicle is mainly due to its structure and the antennas mounted over it. There can be situation when the signatures due to antennas dominate over the structural RCS of the platform. This necessitates the study towards the reduction and control of antenna/ array RCS. The planar <b>dipole</b> <b>array</b> is considered as a stacked linear <b>dipole</b> <b>array.</b> A systematic, step-by-step approach is used to determine the RCS pattern including the finite dimensions of dipole antenna elements. The mutual impedance between the dipole elements for planar configuration is determined. The scattering till second-level of couplers in parallel feed network is taken into account. The phase shifters are modelled as delay line. All the couplers in the feed network are assumed to be four port devices. It is shown that the array RCS can be reduced considerably for a low observable platform by an optimization of array design parameters even in the presence of mutual coupling.
