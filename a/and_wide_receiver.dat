5|$|After {{suffering}} {{an injury}} and being {{knocked out of}} Michigan's game with Nebraska (a 23–9 loss to the Cornhuskers) on October 27, Robinson returned to the lineup for the last home game of the 2012 season, a 42-17 victory over Iowa. Playing in his final game at Michigan Stadium, Robinson split his playing time between the tailback, quarterback, <b>and</b> <b>wide</b> <b>receiver</b> positions. He accounted for 122 yards, including 98 rushing yards on 13 carries and 24 receiving yards on two receptions.

5|$|Parseghian also {{recognized}} talent in quarterback John Huarte <b>and</b> <b>wide</b> <b>receiver</b> Jack Snow, {{who had been}} used only sparingly for two seasons by previous coaches. Huarte could throw far and accurately but was soft-spoken, a trait Parseghian and his staff helped change. Snow was large for a receiver of his era, but Parseghian thought his athleticism and sure hands would make him a good wideout. Still, expectations were muted for the 1964 season: Parseghian told his coaches that the team would have a 6–4 record if they were lucky. Sports Illustrated predicted a 5–5 record at best, and the team did not rank among the top 20 programs {{in the country in}} the pre-season AP Poll.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 edition was {{the first}} {{appearance}} in the bowl for both Arizona and for the Pac-12. Arizona, seventh best {{in the nation in}} total offense (521.83 ypg), was led by quarterback Matt Scott (338.45 ypg, 3,238 yards passing), All-American running back Ka'Deem Carey who led the nation in rushing (146.42 ypg) and set a school record with his 1,757 rushing yards, good for 21 touchdowns, <b>and</b> <b>wide</b> <b>receiver</b> Austin Hill who totaled 1,189 yards. 2012 {{was the first}} season in Arizona's history during which they had a 3000-yard passer, a 1000-yard rusher, and a 1000-yard receiver. Senior place kicker John Bonano was named the 2012 Pac-12 Football Scholar-Athlete of the Year (Physiology major with a 3.927 GPA).|$|E
5|$|The Bulls {{were led}} offensively by the triple threat of quarterback Drew Willy, running back James Starks, <b>and</b> <b>wide</b> <b>receiver</b> Namaan Roosevelt. The three {{combined}} to break 14single-season school records, including most points scored {{in a season}} (404). Willy, heading into his final game as a Buffalo Bull, had already surpassed the 3,000-yard mark in passing on the season, throwing for 25touchdowns against only fiveinterceptions. Starks, while not seen as the same caliber of player as UConn's Donald Brown, had run for over 1,300yards and caught 41passes for 340yards, scoring 16touchdowns on the year. Roosevelt {{was seen as the}} top playmaker, going over the 100-yard mark in each of Buffalo's last fivegames and scoring at least once in his last seven.|$|E

His first {{coaching}} job in the National Football League was with the Houston Oilers from 1993 to 1994. He later returned to Michigan State, staying there from 1995 to 1998. In 1999, {{he returned to the}} NFL as <b>wide</b> <b>receivers</b> coach of the Green Bay Packers, later holding the same position with the Minnesota Vikings and later became assistant head coach and offensive coordinator <b>and</b> <b>wide</b> <b>receivers</b> coach of the Miami Dolphins. From 2007 to 2008 he was <b>wide</b> <b>receivers</b> coach of the Washington Huskies before returning once again to the NFL in the same position with the St. Louis Rams. In 2010, he was hired as assistant head coach <b>and</b> <b>wide</b> <b>receivers</b> coach of the Tennessee Volunteers.|$|R
5|$|The two teams' quarterbacks {{benefited from}} their receivers' success in eluding the {{opposing}} defenses. Florida State quarterback Chris Rix completed 12 of his 25 pass attempts for two touchdowns, 269 yards, and one interception. Rix also ran the ball 12 {{times during the}} game. Although he lost a total of 19 yards, one of his positive rushes resulted in a rushing touchdown. Despite that score, the game {{marked the first time}} all season that Rix had been held to negative rushing yardage. For Virginia Tech, quarterback Grant Noel completed 15 of 27 pass attempts for 269 yards and a touchdown. Backup quarterback Bryan Randall threw an interception on his only pass attempt of the game, <b>and</b> <b>wide</b> <b>receiver</b> Richard Johnson's trick pass attempt fell incomplete.|$|E
5|$|Of all the draft-eligible juniors, Mark Ingram, Julio Jones and Marcell Dareus {{declared}} their {{eligibility for}} the 2011 NFL Draft on January 7. At {{the time of}} their announcement, each was projected as a first round pick. Five Alabama players, two seniors and three juniors, were invited to the NFL Scouting Combine. The invited players were offensive lineman James Carpenter, quarterback Greg McElroy, defensive end Marcell Dareus, running back Mark Ingram, <b>and</b> <b>wide</b> <b>receiver</b> Julio Jones. In the draft, Alabama set a school record with four players selected in the first round.

5|$|Delaware {{kicked off}} {{to start the}} game, <b>and</b> <b>wide</b> <b>receiver</b> Torrey Smith {{returned}} the ball 23yards to the Maryland 32-yard line. Quarterback Jordan Steffy then led a Maryland drive, but the series ended when placekicker Obi Egekeze missed a 48-yard field goal attempt. On the next Maryland possession, Egekeze missed another field goal attempt, this time of 45yards. The teams then exchanged several punts before Maryland took over on the Delaware 48-yard line. Steffy completed a 36-yard pass to Darrius Heyward-Bey, which set up a 12-yard touchdown rush also by Heyward-Bey. Delaware drove 44yards, but then missed their own 46-yard field goal attempt. With 3:33 left in the half, Steffy engineered a 47-yard drive {{to set up a}} 41-yard field goal attempt, which Egekeze missed for the third time. On the first play of the second half, Delaware quarterback Rob Schoenhoft threw an interception to cornerback Kevin Barnes, who returned it 10yards to the Delaware 46-yard line. On the next play, Steffy threw an interception to Erik Johnson, who returned it to the Maryland 49-yard line. The Terrapins' next possession ended when, fourth and 18, Steffy threw another interception at the Delaware one-yard line. Incidentally, this put the Blue Hens in worse field position than if the Terrapins had turned over on downs. Soon after, Delaware punted the ball away. Running back Da'Rel Scott then rushed for a 30-yard gain, which set up a 14-yard touchdown run by running back Davin Meggett. Chris Turner took over as Maryland's quarterback on the second series of the fourth quarter after Steffy fractured his right thumb. On Delaware's subsequent possession, Schoenhoft engineered an 80-yard drive, which culminated with a one-yard touchdown rush by running back Johnathan Smith. With 3:20 on the clock, Schoenhoft threw an interception to safety Terrell Skinner. Turner then scrambled for a first down, and Scott converted for a second first down, which allowed Maryland to run out the game clock. Maryland won, with a final score of 14–7.|$|E

5|$|The Bears {{struggled}} {{early in}} the preseason-opening game, starting with the Dolphins scoring on the opening drive with Ryan Tannehill's two-yard touchdown pass to Jarvis Landry, concluding a 14-play, 85-yard drive. On the first offensive play, tackle Jordan Mills was penalized for a false start, and after four plays, the Bears punted; Chicago would not score until {{early in the}} second quarter with Robbie Gould's 48-yard field goal. The Dolphins responded to the field goal with Caleb Sturgis' 31-yard field goal later in the quarter. With 1:02 left in the first half, backup quarterback Jimmy Clausen attempted to lead a two-minute drill, and the offense reached the Dolphins' 16-yard line, but with no timeouts <b>and</b> <b>wide</b> <b>receiver</b> Josh Bellamy being unable to get out of bounds, the clock ran out. Early in the second half, cornerback Sherrick McManis pulled the ball away from Mike Gillislee, and recovered at the Dolphins' 37, which led to Gould's 23-yard field goal; after Miami punted, Gould narrowed the margin by one point with a 21-yard kick. On the Dolphins' next play, McLeod Bethel-Thompson was intercepted by linebacker John Timu; seven plays later, runningback Ka'Deem Carey scored on a one-yard touchdown run to give the Bears the lead, followed by Clausen's two-point conversion pass to wide receiver A. J. Cruz. In the fourth quarter, Bethel-Thompson was intercepted by linebacker Sam Acho on the Miami 13, which led to Gould kicking a 27-yard field goal; later in the quarter, the Bears increased their lead with runningback Senorise Perry's 54-yard touchdown run, making the score 27–10. After the Dolphins turned the ball over on downs and the Bears punted, the game concluded with Miami's Josh Freeman being intercepted by defensive back Malcolm Bronson.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{enjoyed a}} run of success {{over the next several}} years. Led by league MVP quarterback Charlie Conerly, who passed for 1,706yards, 14 touchdowns, and four interceptions, they {{finished}} 9–3 in 1959 and faced the Colts in a championship game rematch. They lost again, this time in a far less dramatic game, 31–16. Conerly struggled with age and injuries in 1960, and was replaced by George Shaw. Gifford was concussed in a vicious hit by Chuck Bednarik during a November game versus the Philadelphia Eagles, and missed the rest of the season, and the following season, as a result. The hit was so devastating, that after being taken to the locker room, Gifford was given his last rites. The team still finished with a winning record at 6–4–2, but were led to acquire former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Y. A. Tittle in the offseason. Led by Tittle and new head coach Allie Sherman, New York won three consecutive Eastern Division titles from 1961 to 1963. In 1961, they were beaten by the Packers, 37–0 in the championship game. In 1962, they went into the championship game with a 12–2 record, and a nine-game winning streak; but lost to the Packers again, 16–7. Nonetheless, the Giants had captivated New York by this time, even though the sold out game was played in single-digit weather with 35mph winds, only 299 of the 65,000+ fans who bought tickets stayed home. Before the 1962 season, Gifford came out of his injury-forced retirement, saying he missed the game too much. He changed positions from halfback to flanker. During the season, Tittle <b>and</b> <b>wide</b> <b>receiver</b> Del Shofner set still-standing team records when Tittle threw for seven touchdowns and Shofner amassed 269 receiving yards in the same game on October 28. After the season, the team traded two-time Pro Bowl defensive lineman Roosevelt Grier to the Los Angeles Rams at his request; Grier wanted to move to LA to start his singing career.|$|E
