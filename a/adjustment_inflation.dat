40|$|The views {{expressed}} in this paper {{are those of the}} authors and do not necessarily represent those of the BOT. This paper attempts to answer two questions arising in the present environment where traditional inflation indicators show no clear sign of price pressure despite robust economic growth. Firstly, are there any price pressures at present and, if so, where do they lie? Secondly, with several changes in the global and domestic environment, has the inflation process, in particular its speed of adjustment, changed? Both the newly proposed Kalman’s inflation indicator, which has a unique feature of time-varying weights, and the finding of relatively higher increase in PPI compared to CPI indicates some upward price pressure in the economy. Meanwhile, sectoral price data reveal that prices of consumer goods have been adjusted less frequently across sectors during the post-crisis period although there has been no change in the frequency of producer price <b>adjustment.</b> <b>Inflation</b> is also found to return quickly to its initial level in response to shocks. This result renders an undemanding role of monetary policy especially under the inflation targeting regime...|$|E
40|$|Insufficient {{confounder}} {{adjustment is}} viewed as a common source of "false discoveries", especially in the epidemiology sector. However, adjustment for "confounders" that are correlated with the exposure, but which do not independently predict the outcome, may cause loss of power to detect the exposure effect. On the other hand, choosing confounders based on "stepwise" methods is subject to many hazards, which imply that the confidence interval eventually published is likely not to have the advertized coverage probability for the effect that we wanted to know. We {{would like to be able}} to find a model in the data on exposures and confounders, and then to estimate the parameters of that model from the conditional distribution of the outcome, given the exposures and confounders. The haif package, downloadable from SSC, calculates the homoskedastic <b>adjustment</b> <b>inflation</b> factors (HAIFs), by which the variances and standard errors of coeffcients for a matrix of X-variables are scaled (or inflated), if a matrix of unnecessary confounders A is also included in a regression model, assuming equal variances (homoskedasticity). These can be calculated from the A- and X-variables alone, and can be used to inform the choice of a set of models eventually fitted to the outcome data, together with the usual criteria involving causality and prior opinion. Examples are given of the use of HAIFs and their ratios. ...|$|E
40|$|We ask why, in many {{circumstances}} and many environments, decision-makers choose {{to act on}} a time-regular basis (e. g. adjust every six weeks) or on a stateregular basis (e. g. set prices ending in a 9), even though such an approach appears suboptimal. The paper attributes regular behaviour to adjustment cost heterogeneity. We show that, given the cost heterogeneity, the likelihood of adopting regular policies depends on {{the shape of the}} benefit function: the flatter it is, the more likely, ceteris paribus, is regular adjustment. We provide sufficient conditions under which, when policymakers differ with respect to the shape of the benefit function (as in Konieczny and Skrzypacz, 2006), the frequency of adjustments across markets is negatively correlated with the incidence of regular adjustments. On the other hand, if policymakers differences are due to the level of adjustment costs (as in Dotsey, King and Wolman, 1999), then the correlation is positive. To test the model we apply it to optimal pricing policies. We use a large Austrian data set, which consists of the direct price information collected by the statistical office and covers 80 % of the CPI over eight years. We run cross-sectional tests, regressing the proportion of attractive prices and, separately, the excess proportion of price changes {{at the beginning of a}} year and at the beginning of a quarter, on various conditional frequencies of <b>adjustment,</b> <b>inflation</b> and its variability, dummies for good types, and other relevant variables. We find that the lower is, in a given market, the conditional frequency of price changes, the higher is the incidence of time- and state-regular adjustment.

Using Medicaid claims from 1984 - 1991, we explored the effects of Medicaid reimbursement increases on dentists' participation. Using results from inflation adjusted analyses, we would conclude that a 23 % nominal increase in Medicaid reimbursement rates yields no {{increase in the number}} of Medicaid children seen by dentists. In contrast, estimations based on unadjusted reimbursement rates suggest that this same 23 % nominal increase in reimbursement leads to an expected 16 -person (15. 4 %) {{increase in the number of}} Medicaid patients seen per provider per year. These analyses demonstrate that results are sensitive to <b>adjustment</b> for <b>inflation.</b> While adjusting for inflation is a generally accepted practice in health services research, doing so without evidence that providers respond to adjusted reimbursement may be unjustified.
