40|$|We {{explore the}} {{relationship}} between <b>asset</b> <b>encumbrance</b> and bank funding {{in the context of}} covered bonds a form of collateralized debt. Covered bond issuance influences the incidence of bank runs by unsecured creditors and, in turn, conditions in the unsecured funding market influence the bank s choice of <b>asset</b> <b>encumbrance.</b> The more reliant is the bank on secured finance and the more it encumbers assets on its balance sheet, the more concentrated are losses on unsecured creditors and the more fragile the bank. But as more stable long-term debt is added to the funding mix, the greater is the expected value of bank equity. We solve for the optimal choice of <b>asset</b> <b>encumbrance</b> and wholesale funding. Our model sheds light on how losses of confidence in funding markets, macroeconomic shocks, and improved crisis resolution frameworks affect the extent of balance sheet collateralization...|$|E
40|$|This is {{a welcome}} {{addition}} to {{the literature on the}} interaction between bank financing choices and financial stability. The main objective of the paper is to investigate the implications of the observed increase in collateralisation of financial transactions, such as over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, and bank funding, such as repo funding and covered bond issuance. To this end, the paper presents a simple model of secured and unsecured bank funding to analyse the impact of increased <b>asset</b> <b>encumbrance</b> on liquidity risk, solvency risk and changes in collateral value. The main point is easily understood: collateralisation is not a panacea. Instead, increasing levels of collateralisation of bank funding may increase the procyclicality of credit provision and may even increase the probability of a sudden withdrawal of unsecured funding; also known as a bank run. The paper by Gai, Haldane, Kapadia and Nelson distinguishes nicely the microprudential benefits from the macroprudential concerns stemming from high levels of <b>asset</b> <b>encumbrance.</b> From the perspective of a supervisor that is most concerned about the stability of a single financial institution in isolation, increased levels of secured funding are a positive: secured funding is less likely to be withdrawn during times of crisis and it is cheaper than unsecured funding. Also, the mere diversification of funding sources provides some insurance against adverse developments i...|$|E
40|$|How does <b>asset</b> <b>encumbrance</b> {{affect the}} {{fragility}} of intermediaries subject to rollover risk? We offer a model in which a bank issues covered bonds backed by a pool of assets that is bankruptcy remote and replenished following losses. Encumbering assets allows a bank to raise cheap secured debt and expand profitable investment, but it also concentrates risk on unsecured debt and thus exacerbates fragility and raises unsecured funding costs. Deposit insurance or wholesale funding guarantees induce excessive encumbrance and fragility. To mitigate such risk shifting, we study prudential regulatory tools, including limits on encumbrance, minimum capital requirements and surcharges for encumbrance...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{tries to}} explain {{different}} nature of the dynamics during the upward and downward part of the last house price cycle in Spain. Covered bonds are introduced as an instrument which may accelerate a house price boom, while it may {{also serve as a}} source of correction to overvalued house prices in downturn, where important rigidities may be present In a serious economic stress, lack of investment opportunities motivates investors to buy covered bonds due to the strong guarantees provided, which may in turn help to revitalize the credit and housing markets. To address such regime shift, house price dynamics is modelled within a framework of mutually related house price, credit and business cycles using smooth transition vector autoregressive model, in which volume of covered bonds issued is included. Linear behaviour of such system is rejected, indicating the need to model house prices in a nonlinear framework. Also, importance of modelling house prices in the context of credit and business cycles is confirmed and causality from issuance of covered bonds to house price dynamics is found in this nonlinear structure. Finally, potential threat to financial stability resulting from rising <b>asset</b> <b>encumbrance</b> both in the upward and downward part of the house price cycle is identified. It is suggested that the collateral valuation used for the dynamic adjustment of the cover pool is done using forward looking predictions of house prices and that the rate of <b>asset</b> <b>encumbrance</b> is monitored jointly with stress testing the house prices...|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{financial}} stability implications of covered bonds. Banks issue covered bonds by encumbering assets on their balance sheet and placing them within a dynamic ring fence. As more assets are encumbered, jittery unsecured creditors may run, {{leading to a}} banking crisis. We provide conditions for such a crisis to occur. We examine how different over-the-counter market network structures influence the liquidity of secured funding markets and crisis dynamics. We draw on the framework to consider several policy measures aimed at mitigating systemic risk, including caps on <b>asset</b> <b>encumbrance,</b> global legal entity identifiers, and swaps of good for bad collateral by central banks...|$|E

40|$|Covered {{bonds are}} a {{specific}} example of senior secured debt. If the issuer of the bonds defaults {{the proceeds of}} the assets in the cover pool are used for their debt service. If in this situation the cover pool proceeds do not suffice for the debt service, the creditors of the bonds have recourse to the issuer's assets and their claims are pari passu with {{the claims of the}} creditors of senior unsecured debt. Historically, covered bonds have been very safe investments. During their more than two hundred years of existence, investors never suffered losses due to missed payments from covered bonds. From a risk management perspective, therefore modelling covered bonds losses is mainly of interest for estimating the impact that the <b>asset</b> <b>encumbrance</b> by the cover pool has on the loss characteristics of the issuer's senior unsecured debt. We explore one-period structural modelling approaches for covered bonds and senior unsecured debt losses with one and two asset value variables respectively. Obviously, two-assets models with separate values of the cover pool and the issuer's remaining portfolio allow for more realistic modelling. However, we demonstrate that exact calibration of such models may be impossible. We also investigate a one-asset model in which the riskiness of the cover pool is reflected by a risk-based adjustment of the encumbrance ratio of the issuer's assets.

40|$|Funding {{structures}} {{matter for}} financial stability. In particular, overreliance by some banks on {{certain types of}} wholesale funding—especially by U. S. and European banks—contributed to the global financial crisis. Most banks have recently made their funding structures more resilient by raising their capital adequacy ratios and reducing their dependence on short-term wholesale funding. However, some distressed banks remain vulnerable because their equity capital levels are inadequate and they are highly dependent on central bank funds. This chapter examines how bank funding structures have changed over time—especially {{in the run-up to}} the crisis—and how these structures affect financial stability. The analysis considers banks in a number of advanced and emerging market economies and includes systemically important banks. The analysis shows that healthy banks rely more on equity and less on debt (especially short-term debt) and have more diversified funding structures with lower loan-to-deposit ratios. Adequate capital buffers reduce a bank’s probability of default and support financial stability. Therefore, Basel III capital regulations that aim to raise the quantity and quality of capital should con-tinue to be a mainstay of the reform efforts. Basel III liquidity regulations will also play a role by reducing banks’ overreliance on short-term wholesale funding, which has proven detrimental to financial stability. Current reform efforts are aimed at reducing financial instability, but there can be tension among some key regulatory reforms that affect bank funding structures. As this chapter shows, such tension can arise, on the one hand, from pressures to use more secured funding (thereby raising levels of <b>asset</b> <b>encumbrance)</b> as well as deposits and, on the other hand, from bank-resolution initiatives (including the introduction of bail-in powers and th...|$|E
40|$|Mind the gap? Sources and {{implications}} of supplydemand imbalances in collateral asset markets 1 Increasing demand for collateral assets {{in the aftermath of}} the financial crisis has raised concerns about a shortage of high-quality assets (HQA). Drawing on a recent report by the Committee on the Global Financial System, we argue that such concerns seem unjustified. In aggregate, the increase in the supply of HQA appears sufficient to meet the additional demand arising from both market forces and regulatory changes. But given the uneven distribution of HQA among market participants, higher demand is likely to trigger market responses that could themselves generate risks for the financial system and thus warrant further monitoring. JEL classification: G 21, G 28. The use of collateral in financial transactions is on the rise, driven by both market forces and regulatory changes. This has triggered concerns about possible shortages of collateral assets and the associated implications for financial markets. 2 A variety of factors has lifted demand for collateral. In response to counterparty risk concerns triggered by the financial crisis, issuers and investors have shown increased appetite for secured long-term bank debt, such as covered bonds. Likewise, funding activity has shifted from short-term unsecured lending to repo markets. Many banks, especially in Europe, have become increasingly dependent on collateralised borrowing, leading to rising bank <b>asset</b> <b>encumbrance</b> levels – a sign of rising demand for certain types of collateral for funding purposes. Regulatory changes add to this increased demand. One factor is derivatives regulation, as more stringent collateralisation requirements in over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets (BCBS and IOSCO (2013)) or the requirement for central clearing of all standardised OTC derivatives come into force. Another factor is capital and liquidity regulation. New rules under Basel III will require banks to maintain larger buffers of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA; see Box). European insurance firms, in turn, are likely to add to the demand for high-quality assets (HQA), given new requirements under Solvency II (CGFS (2011 a)). 1...|$|E
