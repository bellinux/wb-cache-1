Philip first of all dashed in hurrying and stumbling. He had been unprepared by hearing Humfrey's account, and, impetuous and affectionate as he was, was entirely unrestrained, and flinging himself on his knees with the half-audible words, 'Oh! Lucy! Lucy! He is as good as dead!' hid his face between his arms on his sister's lap, and sobbed with the <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> and with all his youthful strength; so much adding to the consternation and confusion, that, finding all Lucy's gentle entreaties vain, his father at last roughly pulled up his face by main force, and said, 'Philip, hold your tongue! Are we to have you on our hands as well as my Lady? I shall send you home this moment! Let your sister go.' ...|$|E

Cases are filed primarily for child abuse or neglect; child abuse is the physical or psychological mistreatment {{of a child}} by an adult. This includes physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional maltreatment, and exposure to domestic violence. Neglect refers to situations in which a child’s caregiver fails to provide adequate clothing, food or shelter, deliberately or otherwise.

50|$|Today, <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> is {{considered}} to be a serious crime in many jurisdictions because it can be considered malum in se (wrong in itself) due to the direct harm to the child, and because of welfare concerns (in that the child often becomes a ward of the state and in turn, a burden upon the public fisc). For example, in the U.S. state of Georgia, it is a misdemeanor to willfully and voluntarily abandon a child, and a felony to abandon one's child and leave the state. In 1981, Georgia's treatment of abandonment as a felony when the defendant leaves the state was upheld as constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. 'Rehoming' is still legal in Arkansas where, in 2015, state legislator Justin Harris made national headlines by rehoming two young adopted children.|$|E

40|$|The article {{presents}} a social-psychological indicators of stress, coping mechanisms, rigidity and psychological component gestational dominant as risk factors predisposing to deviations {{in the context}} of preparedness for motherhood, marked psychological characteristics of pregnant women main group. Material and methods. The study was conducted on the basis of obstetric clinics SSMU, prenatal maternity hospital number 4 and the Centre for Medical Prevention (Cabinet crisis pregnancy). Total was attended by 52 women aged 18 to 44 years, at different stages of pregnancy – from 5 to 39 weeks. Methodological apparatus consisted of a structured interview questionnaire “Medical and social data of the pregnant woman” methodology for determining the stress and social adaptation of Holmes and Rage (1967), a questionnaire of coping R. Lazarus and S. Folkman (WCQ, 1988), Tomsk questionnaire rigidity G. V. Zalewski (TORZ, 1987), test on pregnant I. V. Dobryakova (1996). Data processing was carried out using statistical methods Spearman rank correlation coefficient, nonparametric Mann–Whitney U and Kruskal–Wallis H and φ * – Fisher's angular transformation. Results. Significant psychological factors that may influence the formation of readiness for motherhood among women of the main group can be considered an unplanned pregnancy (65 %), and also its not gelendost (35 %). Studies of stress resistance was detected in pregnant women from the main group low stress levels (88 %), and only 12 % have a high degree. Most of the women from the сomparison group reverse the situation 64 % have a high degree of stress, this suggests that the presence of previously state miscarriage is for this group of stress. On the formation of readiness for motherhood affects not only the presence of stressful situations, butalso how the woman in their lives. Using U-test Mann–Whitney, were statistically significant differences were observed among the main group and сomparison group in the following coping strategies: selfcontrol (p ≤ 0. 0014), the search for social support (p ≤ 0. 0015), accepting responsibility (p ≤ 0. 04), and planning solutions to the problems (p ≤ 0. 00016). These differences are considered as one of the risk factors for deviant motherhood main group. In contrast to the сomparison group, where 62 % of pregnant women with the optimal type PKGD, main group optimal type PKGD observed only in 38 % of the respondents, which indicates that the risk of deviations in the structure of psychological readiness. Conclusion. Risk factors such as social disadvantage, the planned <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> the tendency to rigid behavior, inefficient use of coping strategies and low level of optimal psychological component gestational dominant testify about the possible psychological unpreparedness for the upcoming event to become a mother and as a consequence to the development of deviant motherhood. </p...|$|E
