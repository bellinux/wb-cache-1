Gilkeson tendered an offer to C.H. Hill, then an instructor at the Maryland School for the Deaf, and upon Gilkeson's return to Romney he recommended Hill and resigned from his post as principal. Hill was subsequently appointed by the Board to fill the position. While the Board of Regents was pleased with Gilkeson's performance as principal and wished for him to stay on in the position, but he preferred {{to return to his}} professional law and political career in the end.|$|E

In the same study, the teachers in these elite schools showed an even lower amount of tolerance towards Ahmadis than their pupils. Ahmadis are harassed by certain schools, universities and teachers in Pakistan's Punjab province.

The Regional Director of Bantu Education (Northern Transvaal Region), J.G. Erasmus, told Circuit Inspectors <b>and</b> <b>Principals</b> of Schools that from 1 January 1975, Afrikaans had to be used for mathematics, arithmetic, and social studies from standard five (7th grade), according to the Afrikaans Medium Decree; English would be the medium of instruction for general science and practical subjects (homecraft, needlework, woodwork, metalwork, art, agricultural science).

25|$|Bermudian Springs School District did not {{volunteer}} {{to participate in}} the state's pilot project with the Pennsylvania Department of Education to develop statewide policy, tools and processes to evaluate teachers <b>and</b> <b>principals</b> in which student achievement is a significant factor affecting performance ratings. Secretary of Education Ron Tomalis announced that 104 K-12 entities, including nine career and technical centers, nine charter schools and nine intermediate units, signed-up {{to participate in the}} new teacher and principal evaluation pilot program. The initiative is funded by a Gates Momentum grant. During the 2011-12 school year, more than 120 school districts, charter schools, intermediate units, and career and technology centers participated in the second implementation phase of the new teacher evaluation tool. This included more than 650 supervisors and nearly 5,000 teachers in 366 school buildings participating in the pilot project.|$|E
25|$|The {{first step}} will be {{interactive}} Web-based portal called Learning Village {{that would be}} fully functioning by fall 2010. The Learning Village program will give DPS the ability to digitize its textbooks, curriculum and lesson plans. Teachers {{will have access to}} students' assessment results and prospective lesson plans to more quickly diagnosis struggling students. Parents can log into the system to track their students' progress, print additional worksheets and view cumulative test results for a teacher's entire class. The purpose of the Learning Village tool is to serve as a unified portal to connect students, teachers, parents <b>and</b> <b>principals,</b> and deliver real-time learning. DPS will also use $14.2 million in federal stimulus and Title I dollars for netbooks for all 36,000 students and 4,000 teachers in grades 6–12 for access to technology to support hands-on learning.

According to the National Conference of Superintendents <b>and</b> <b>Principals</b> of Institutions for Deaf Mutes in 1888, the state of Virginia considered Covell's services [...] "of more value as manager of one of her noblest public institutions than as a soldier in the field."

500|$|Zahorchak was {{a steady}} {{supporter}} of Rendell's education proposals. However, he maintained {{that he could}} still be an independent voice within the administration, and claimed, [...] "I happen {{to agree with the}} outcomes because I'm in the mix of making determinations of our policy decisions." [...] In addition to Act 72, Zahorchak supported a Rendell proposal to require superintendents <b>and</b> <b>principals</b> in struggling school districts to improve math and reading test scores in order to keep their jobs, an idea that was not embraced by the Pennsylvania Legislature. In 2006, Zahorchak said he supported requiring high-school students to pass exit exams before they could graduate, although he acknowledged implementing such a testing program would be a long and difficult effort. At the time, the state required students to demonstrate proficiency in math and reading before they could graduate, but allowed local districts to decide whether that should entail passing the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment math and reading tests or alternative tests in the subjects. Zahorchak said, [...] "I think it's a real disservice to graduate a student who's fundamentally not at the standard level." [...] However, Zahorchak also said students should be given alternative ways to demonstrate they are ready for college or the work force besides exams.|$|E
