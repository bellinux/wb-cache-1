2500|$|Her speech {{also sought}} to express the idea that really terrible things happen to good people: [...] "I would call it, in terms of writing, in terms of poetry, it's a laundry list.

25|$|Motion: Some things {{undoubtedly}} move, though cannot cause {{their own}} motion. Since {{there can be}} no infinite chain of causes of motion, there must be a First Mover not moved by anything else, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> everyone understands by God.|$|R
6000|$|Of that, he says, he {{is quite}} certain; <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> says.--Suppose there was a glacier here, where we are sailing now: it would end in an ice cliff, such as you have seen a picture of in Captain Cook's Voyages, of which you are so fond.

30|$|In the {{previous}} section, {{we saw that}} the new non-rigid registration method can improve {{the reliability of the}} integrated intensities of atomic columns.

Their own lot was pretty well out of harm's way, east of the fence, but Jo told him {{to take a look at}} yours.

50|$|By law {{a general}} {{election}} must be held at least once every five years.

50|$|Chapter 13 {{asserts that}} the child is a state of innocence <b>and</b> non-attachment, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> one must cultivate.

6000|$|And now {{the thought}} of extricating himself from his desperate peril turned him cold by its suddenness. He stood very still a moment; then looked about him as though he feared that some {{watching}} spy might read on him the ugly intention that of a sudden had leapt to life in his heart. Swiftly it spread, and took more definite shape, the reflection of it showing now upon his smooth, handsome face, and disfiguring it beyond belief. He drew away from the wall, and took a turn or two upon the ramparts, one hand behind him, the other raised to support his drooping chin. Thus he brooded for a little while. Then, with another of his furtive glances, {{he turned to the}} north-western tower, and entered the armoury. There he rummaged until he had found the pen, ink and paper that he sought, and with the door wide open--the better that he might hear the sound of approaching steps--he set himself feverishly to write. It was soon done, and he stood up, waving the sheet to dry the ink. Then he looked it over again, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had written: ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{give you}} this as an {{instance}} that Oliver felt that the Parliament that had been dismissed had been perfectly right with regard to Chancery, {{and that there was}} no doubt of the propriety of abolishing Chancery, or reforming it in some kind of way. He considered it, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did. He assembled sixty of the wisest lawyers to be found in England. Happily, there were men great in the law--men who valued the laws as much as anybody does now, I suppose. (A laugh.) Oliver said to them, [...] "Go and examine this thing, and in the name of God inform me what is necessary to be done with regard to it. You will see how we may clean out the foul things in it that render it poison to everybody." [...] Well, they sat down then, and in the course of six weeks--there was no public speaking then, no reporting of speeches, and no trouble of any kind; there was just the business in hand--they got sixty propositions fixed in their minds of the things that required to be done. And upon these sixty propositions Chancery was reconstituted and remodelled, and so it has lasted to our time. It had become a nuisance, and could not have continued much longer.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was once}} in an obelisk-ship," [...] said he, [...] "that used to trade regular between Egypt and New York, {{carrying}} obelisks. We {{had a big}} obelisk on board. The way they ship obelisks {{is to make a}} hole in the stern of the ship, and run the obelisk in, p'inted end foremost; and this obelisk filled up nearly the whole of that ship from stern to bow. We was about ten days out, and sailing afore a northeast gale with the engines at full speed, when suddenly we spied breakers ahead, and our Captain saw we was about to run on a bank. Now if we hadn't had an obelisk on board we might have sailed over that bank, but the captain knew that with an obelisk on board we drew too much water for this, and that we'd be wrecked in about fifty-five seconds if something wasn't done quick. So he had to do something quick, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did: He ordered all steam on, and drove slam-bang on that bank. Just as he expected, we stopped so suddint that that big obelisk bounced for'ard, its p'inted end foremost, and went clean through the bow and shot out into the sea. The minute it did that the vessel was so lightened that it rose in the water and we easily steamed over the bank. There was one man knocked overboard by the shock when we struck, but as soon as we missed him we went back after him and we got him all right. You see, when that obelisk went overboard, its butt-end, which was heaviest, went down first, and when it touched the bottom it just stood there, and as it was such a big obelisk there was about five and a half feet of it stuck out of the water. The man who was knocked overboard he just swum for that obelisk and he climbed up the hiryglyphics. It was a mighty fine obelisk, and the Egyptians had cut their hiryglyphics good and deep, so that the man could get hand and foot-hold; and when we got to him and took him off, he was sitting high and dry on the p'inted end of that obelisk. It was a great pity about the obelisk, for it was a good obelisk, but as I never heard the company tried to raise it, I expect it is standing there yet." ...|$|E
