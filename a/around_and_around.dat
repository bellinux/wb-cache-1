25|$|Parque Vidal is {{probably}} one of the most typical places in Cuba. During the afternoons, people (especially singles) visit the park to meet others. Although not widely practiced in recent times, the custom was to walk the park <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>around.</b> The women walk the inner part of the park, while the men walk the outer side. Another lost custom was for the locals to set up a platform and offer improvisations with their guitars on late Sunday afternoons. For that day they dressed with their Guayaberas and highly polished shoes.|$|E
500|$|For {{the opening}} scene, a [...] "special kind of blood" [...] {{was placed in}} and around the actors' eyes to {{simulate}} their brains boiling. For the scene in which the actress is pushed up against a glass door, the special effects department created a device wearing a brown wig with an explosive charge designed to imitate the actress' head exploding. Director Bill Eagles described the scene as [...] "imagin an egg in your microwave spinning <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>around</b> at high voltage. What happens? Bang! It just explodes." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Stay" [...] is a pop ballad that {{consists}} of piano and guitar instrumentation. It is written in the key of A minor, having the chord progression of C-Dm-Am-F. The song has a moderate tempo of 112 beats per minute. Rihanna's vocal range in the song ranges from the low note of A3 to the high note of E5. Greg Kot for the Chicago Tribune described the song as being [...] "stripped-bare". The lyrics revolve around [...] "failing to resist true love", according to Dan Martin for NME, as Rihanna sings [...] "Funny, you're the broken one/ But I'm {{the only one who}} needed saving." [...] According to Jocelyn Vena for MTV, Rihanna [...] "punctuates the emotions of the track" [...] on the lyric [...] "It's not much of a life you're living/ It's not just something you take [...] given." [...] Rihanna also makes a plea to her lover, singing [...] "'Round and <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>around</b> we go/ Now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know/ Not really sure how to feel about it/ Something in the way you move/ Makes me feel like I can't live without you/ it takes me all the way/ I want you to stay." [...] Lewis Corner for Digital Spy wrote that Rihanna's vocals glow over the simple yet effective piano riffs.|$|E

2500|$|After the {{announcement}} of the Oslo Accords there were many protest demonstrations in Israel objecting to the Accords. As these protests dragged on, Rabin insisted that as long as he had a majority in the Knesset he would ignore the protests and the protesters. In this context he said, [...] "they (the protesters) can spin <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>around</b> like propellers" [...] but he would continue on the path of the Oslo Accords. Rabin's parliamentary majority rested on non-coalition member Arab support. Rabin also denied the right of American Jews to object to his plan for peace, calling any such dissent [...] "chutzpah." [...] The Oslo agreement was also opposed by Hamas and other Palestinian factions, which launched suicide bombings at Israel.|$|E
