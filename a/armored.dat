5|$|In 1943, McNair took an axe to the <b>armored</b> {{division}} organization, dramatically downsizing it. For {{all but the}} 2nd and 3rd <b>Armored</b> Divisions, {{the number}} of <b>armored</b> battalions was reduced to three. Devers favored the older, larger organization. The surplus <b>armored</b> battalions were utilized as separate <b>armored</b> battalions, so {{by the end of}} 1943 there were 54 <b>armored</b> battalions in <b>armored</b> divisions and 65 non-divisional battalions. By this time, the planned number of Army Ground Force divisions had been dramatically cut to 90, and McNair considered that only ten <b>armored</b> divisions were required, and he suggested that six of the sixteen <b>armored</b> divisions already active be broken up. This proposal was not accepted, and the number of <b>armored</b> divisions was frozen at sixteen.|$|E
5|$|Finally, U.S. <b>armored</b> {{divisions}} {{under the}} March 1942 organization possessed 68 37mm anti-tank guns. Of these, 37 {{belonged to the}} <b>armored</b> infantry regiment (four in each company and one in regiment HQ); 27 to the <b>armored</b> engineer battalion; three to the divisional train and one to division HQ.|$|E
5|$|Major General Ariel Sharon's 143rd <b>Armored</b> Division {{was given}} the {{critical}} tasks of opening the corridors and laying the bridges. His division included Tuvia Raviv's 600th <b>Armored</b> Brigade, Colonel Amnon Reshef's 14th <b>Armored</b> Brigade, and the 'Haim' Brigade commanded by Colonel Haim Erez. Major General Abraham Adan's 162nd <b>Armored</b> Division was tasked with crossing the canal and achieving an encirclement with its 300 tanks. The division included Colonel Natke Nir's 217th <b>Armored</b> Brigade, Colonel Gabi Amir's 460th <b>Armored</b> Brigade and Aryeh Keren's 500th <b>Armored</b> Brigade. A paratrooper brigade would be transferred to Adan's division {{during the course of}} the battle. Kalman Magen's 252nd <b>Armored</b> Division would initially launch diversionary attacks elsewhere to draw attention from Sharon's operations at Deversoir. Thereafter the division would hold and secure the corridor and bridgehead.|$|E
5|$|The T30 HMC entered {{service in}} November 1942, seeing {{action for the}} first time in the North African Campaign. In the 1st <b>Armored</b> Division, each <b>armored</b> {{regiment}} was issued twelve T30s. Of these, three were used in each battalion headquarters platoon and three were used in each regimental reconnaissance platoon. In addition, the 6th and 41st <b>Armored</b> Infantry Regiments were each issued with nine T30 HMCs, with three of them being allocated to the headquarters platoon in each <b>armored</b> infantry battalion.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} Devers took command, the <b>Armored</b> Force had two {{operational}} <b>armored</b> divisions: the 1st <b>Armored</b> Division at Fort Polk, Louisiana, and the 2nd <b>Armored</b> Division at Fort Knox, and one independent tank battalion, the 70th Tank Battalion at Fort George G. Meade, Maryland. Both divisions {{participated in the}} large-scale war games of the Louisiana Maneuvers in August and September 1941, and the Carolina Maneuvers in November 1941. Despite some successes, the maneuvers revealed <b>armored</b> unit and equipment operational deficiencies, plus {{a general lack of}} combat readiness. Devers attributed much of the poor performance to poorly-trained junior and staff officers, but also saw doctrinal deficiencies that hampered the coordination of tanks, infantry and artillery.|$|E
5|$|By 20 March, Jordan had {{identified}} {{parts of the}} Israeli 7th <b>Armored</b> Brigade, 60th <b>Armored</b> Brigade, 35th Paratroop Brigade, 80th Infantry Brigade, a combat engineer battalion and five artillery battalions between Allenby and Damia bridges. The Jordanians assumed the Israelis were planning an attack with a drive on Amman, and the army took up positions near the bridges, with the 60th <b>Armored</b> Brigade joining the 1st Infantry Division. Jordan also added most of its <b>armored</b> car, antitank and artillery units to the 1st Infantry Division. The total firepower was 105 Patton tanks and 88 artillery pieces. The infantry divisions were deployed near the bridges, each with a tank company. The artillery was mostly deployed on the higher Jordan Valley ridges overlooking Karameh for topological advantage.|$|E
5|$|Edgar Quinet {{was laid}} down at Brest in November 1905 and {{launched}} on 21 September 1907. She {{was completed in}} January 1911 and commissioned into the French fleet. The ship was the most powerful <b>armored</b> cruiser completed by France, but she entered service {{two years after the}} British battlecruiser , which rendered the <b>armored</b> cruiser obsolescent as a warship type.|$|E
5|$|Following the German Army's {{invasion}} of Poland and {{the outbreak of}} World War II in Europe in September 1939, the U.S. military entered a period of mobilization, and Patton sought {{to build up the}} power of U.S. <b>armored</b> forces. During maneuvers the Third Army conducted in 1940, Patton served as an umpire, where he met Adna R. Chaffee Jr. and the two formulated recommendations to develop an <b>armored</b> force. Chaffee was named commander of this force, and created the 1st and 2nd <b>Armored</b> Divisions as well as the first combined arms doctrine. He named Patton commander of the 2nd <b>Armored</b> Brigade, part of the 2nd <b>Armored</b> Division. The division was one of few organized as a heavy formation with many tanks, and Patton was in charge of its training. Patton was promoted to brigadier general on October 2, made acting division commander in November, and on April 4, 1941 was promoted again to major general and made Commanding General (CG) of the 2nd <b>Armored</b> Division. As Chaffee stepped down from command of the I <b>Armored</b> Corps, Patton became the most prominent figure in U.S. armor doctrine. In December 1940, he staged a high-profile mass exercise in which 1,000 tanks and vehicles were driven from Columbus, Georgia, to Panama City, Florida, and back. He repeated the exercise with his entire division of 1,300 vehicles the next month. Patton earned a pilot's license and, during these maneuvers, observed the movements of his vehicles from the air to find ways to deploy them effectively in combat. His exploits earned him a spot on the cover of Life Magazine.|$|E
5|$|In December 1912, the Ottoman fleet was reorganized into an <b>armored</b> division, which {{included}} Barbaros Hayreddin as flagship, two destroyer divisions, {{and a fourth}} division composed of warships intended for independent operations. Over the next two months, the <b>armored</b> division attempted to break the Greek naval blockade of the Dardanelles, which resulted in two major naval engagements.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{classified}} as an <b>armored</b> corvette, Kniaz Pozharsky was redesignated as an <b>armored</b> frigate on 20 November 1866. She {{was laid out}} as a central battery ironclad with the armament concentrated amidships. The ship was fitted with a ram and her crew numbered approximately 495 officers and enlisted men.|$|E
5|$|SMS Blücher was {{the last}} <b>armored</b> cruiser built by the German Empire. She was {{designed}} to match what German intelligence incorrectly {{believed to be the}} specifications of the British s. Blücher was larger than preceding <b>armored</b> cruisers and carried more heavy guns, but was unable to match the size and armament of the battlecruisers which replaced <b>armored</b> cruisers in the British Royal Navy and German Imperial Navy (Kaiserliche Marine). The ship was named after the Prussian Field Marshal Gebhard von Blücher, the commander of Prussian forces at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.|$|E
5|$|The 15th Sustainment Brigade was a {{sustainment}} brigade of the United States Army {{based at}} Fort Bliss, Texas. It provided logistics support to other {{units of the}} United States Army, and was subordinate to the 13th Sustainment Command (Expeditionary). It previously had provided support to the 1st Cavalry Division, but now did so for the 1st <b>Armored</b> Division until 12 May 2015 when the 15th Sustainment Brigade {{became part of the}} 1st <b>Armored</b> Division and was renamed 1st <b>Armored</b> Division Sustainment Brigade.|$|E
5|$|The M5 and M6 tank mounted {{variants}} {{were used}} in several models of <b>armored</b> vehicles most notably in the Stuart Light Tank M3/M5, the Lee Medium Tank M3, and Greyhound Light <b>Armored</b> Car M8. In addition, the M3 in its original version was mated {{to a number of}} other self-propelled carriages.|$|E
5|$|The Thule Society, led by Karl Haushofer and Dietlinde Eckhart, use Envy and Edward's kidnapped father Hohenheim as {{catalysts}} to open {{a portal}} to Edward's world, believing {{it to be the}} utopia Shamballa after learning about it from Hohenheim. A number of <b>armored</b> soldiers are sent through the portal, only to emerge on the other side in the city of Liore as mutated zombie-like creatures. Alphonse, who is visiting Liore, fights off the <b>armored</b> soldiers and merges parts of his soul to three of their suits to aid him in combat. Meanwhile, Edward breaks into the Thule Society headquarters and accidentally reopens the portal, returning the dead <b>armored</b> soldiers to Earth and allowing Alphonse's <b>armored</b> form to briefly reunite with his brother before his soul returns to his body, increasing Edward's determination to return to his world.|$|E
5|$|The United States Army {{maintained}} a substantial and continuous military {{presence at the}} inner German border throughout the entire period from 1945 to {{after the end of}} the Cold War. Regular American soldiers manned the border from the end of the war until they were replaced in 1946 by the United States Constabulary, which was disbanded in 1952 after policing duties were transferred to the German authorities. It was replaced by three dedicated armoured cavalry regiments assigned to provide a permanent defence. The 3rd <b>Armored</b> Cavalry Regiment based at Bamberg, 2nd <b>Armored</b> Cavalry Regiment based at Nuremberg and the 14th <b>Armored</b> Cavalry Regiment based at Fulda– later replaced by the 11th <b>Armored</b> Cavalry Regiment– monitored the border using observation posts, ground and air patrols, countering intrusions and gathering intelligence on Warsaw Pact activities.|$|E
5|$|The United States adopted half-tracks {{in large}} numbers {{as they could be}} built more quickly and cheaply by {{civilian}} vehicle producers than vehicles from the established <b>armored</b> vehicle manufacturers. The M2 Half Track Car had first been intended as an artillery tractor, but was also used for carrying the machine gun squads of <b>armored</b> infantry regiments and for reconnaissance units until faster and better-armed M8 Greyhound <b>armored</b> cars were available.|$|E
5|$|The losses {{suffered}} {{by both the}} Egyptians and the Israelis in the battle were severe. Israeli units suffered heavy casualties in men and equipment; Reshef's <b>armored</b> losses during {{the first night of}} the battle alone were comparable to Egyptian <b>armored</b> losses on the disastrous October 14 offensive. For their part, the numbers of Egyptian <b>armored</b> forces within 16th Division's bridgehead severely dwindled. As of 18 October the 21st <b>Armored</b> Division had no more than 40 tanks remaining of an original 136 tanks available {{at the start of the}} battle (not counting 21 tanks received as reinforcements), while the 16th Infantry Division had just 20 tanks remaining in its organic tank battalion. This attrition served Egypt's war strategy of inflicting maximum casualties on the Israelis, even though, from another perspective, the initiative had passed to the Israelis during the battle.|$|E
5|$|The s were {{designed}} as improved {{versions of the}} <b>armored</b> corvette , suited for foreign deployments. Unlike their predecessor, the Alma-class ships were true central battery ironclads as they were fitted with <b>armored</b> transverse bulkheads. Like most ironclads of their era, they were equipped with a metal-reinforced ram.|$|E
5|$|The task of {{capturing}} Lang Vei was entrusted to the 24th Regiment, Vietnam People's Army 304th Division, led by Colonel Le Cong Phe. The regiment {{was to be}} supported by the 2nd Battalion (part of the 101D Regiment, 325th Division), the 2nd Artillery Battalion (part of the 675th Artillery Regiment), one tank company (part of the 198th Tank Battalion, 203rd <b>Armored</b> Regiment), two sapper companies, one anti-aircraft gun company, and one flamethrower platoon. One {{of the most important}} features of the North Vietnamese formation were the elements of the 203rd Armoured Regiment; the Route 9-Khe Sanh Campaign marked the first time the Vietnam People’s Army deployed its <b>armored</b> forces on the battlefield. In 1964, soldiers of North Vietnam’s first <b>armored</b> unit—the 202nd <b>Armored</b> Regiment—was sent into South Vietnam without their T-34 main battle tanks, because their prime mission was to learn enemy armor tactics in order to prepare for future missions. On 22 June 1965, the North Vietnamese Ministry of Defense passed Resolution 100/QD-QP, to establish the 203rd <b>Armored</b> Regiment, and Resolution 101/QD-QP to create an <b>Armored</b> Force Command.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} main design {{alternatives}} to the broadside. In one design, the guns were placed in an <b>armored</b> casemate amidships: this arrangement was called the 'box-battery' or 'centre-battery'. In the other, the guns could be placed on a rotating platform {{to give them a}} broad field of fire; when fully <b>armored,</b> this arrangement was called a turret and when partially <b>armored</b> or unarmored, a barbette.|$|E
5|$|While the paratroopers {{prepared}} to cross, Reshef {{was informed that}} Akavish had been closed again by Egyptian infantry units soon after his passing. He sent one <b>armored</b> battalion to clear the road and committed his remaining three <b>armored</b> and three mechanized battalions to push northwards and secure Tirtur and the Chinese Farm.|$|E
5|$|A lighter {{alternative}} to the turret, particularly popular with the French navy, was the barbette. These were fixed <b>armored</b> towers which held a gun on a turntable. The crew was sheltered from direct fire, but vulnerable to plunging fire, for instance from shore emplacements. The barbette was lighter than the turret, needing less machinery and no roof armor—though nevertheless some barbettes were stripped of their armor plate to reduce the top-weight of their ships. The barbette became widely adopted in the 1880s, and {{with the addition of}} an <b>armored</b> 'gun-house', transformed into the turrets of the pre-Dreadnought battleships.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{participants}} {{of the battle}} were Mohamed Hussein Tantawi and Ehud Barak, then lieutenant colonels. Tantawi commanded an infantry battalion under the 16th Infantry Brigade. He engaged Reshef's armor during October 16 and later Mordechai's paratroopers during the night of October 16/17, and was decorated for valor during the battle. Barak commanded an <b>armored</b> battalion during the battle and personally led the <b>armored</b> effort to extricate the Israeli paratroopers. Both men would later serve as Ministers of Defense in their respective nations and encounter each other again in that capacity.|$|E
5|$|An ironclad is a steam-propelled warship {{protected}} by iron or steel armor plates {{used in the}} early part of the second half of the 19th century. The ironclad was developed as a result of the vulnerability of wooden warships to explosive or incendiary shells. The first ironclad battleship, , was launched by the French Navy in November 1859. The British Admiralty had been considering <b>armored</b> warships since 1856 and prepared a draft design for an <b>armored</b> corvette in 1857; in early 1859 the Royal Navy started building two iron-hulled <b>armored</b> frigates, and by 1861 had made the decision to move to an all-armored battle fleet. After the first clashes of ironclads (both with wooden ships and with one another) took place in 1862 during the American Civil War, it became clear that the ironclad had replaced the unarmored ship of the line as the most powerful warship afloat. This type of ship would come to be very successful in the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|<b>Armored</b> and {{mechanized}} divisions normally {{made use}} of three brigades, with each brigade having up to four combat battalions; depending on the division type, these were generally a three to one mix, with either three mechanized battalions and one <b>armored</b> battalion, or vice versa. Given {{the size of the}} forces deployed across the border, it is thought that the Iraqi Army planned to continue the offensive, after the successful capture of Khafji, in order to seize the valuable oil fields at Dammam.|$|E
5|$|As {{the units}} {{moved to the}} Saudi border, many were {{attacked}} by Coalition aircraft. Around the Al-Wafrah forest, about 1,000 Iraqi <b>armored</b> fighting vehicles were attacked by Harrier aircraft with Rockeye cluster bombs. Another Iraqi convoy of <b>armored</b> vehicles was hit by A-10s, which destroyed {{the first and last}} vehicles, before systematically attacking the stranded remainders. Such air raids prevented the majority of the Iraqi troops deployed for the offensive from taking part in it.|$|E
5|$|At 9:30p.m., the Sa'iqa company {{reported}} an Israeli <b>armored</b> column advancing towards the fort. Two Egyptian tanks {{on the west}} bank opened fire, forcing the Israeli tanks and <b>armored</b> vehicles to withdraw. The company continued eastwards, eventually reaching the crossroads, facing no resistance along the way. With the reinforcing anti-tank teams, the company established defensive positions, and el-'Abassi dispatched patrols to secure the roads leading to the fort.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{the smaller}} {{warships}} faction prevailed. After Law no. 1452 was passed on 30 December 1905, which authorized £4,214,550 for new warship construction (£1,685,820 in 1906), three small battleships, three <b>armored</b> cruisers, six destroyers, twelve torpedo boats, three submarines, a collier, and a training ship were ordered. Though the Brazilian government later eliminated the <b>armored</b> cruisers for monetary reasons, the Minister of the Navy, Admiral Júlio César de Noronha, {{signed a contract}} with Armstrong Whitworth for the planned battleships on 23 July 1906.|$|E
5|$|At night, a Syrian {{expeditionary force}} {{attempted}} to infiltrate Degania Bet, but was caught and warded off, which caused the main Syrian force to attack Degania Alef first. At 06:00, the Syrians started a frontal <b>armored</b> attack, consisting of 5 tanks, {{a number of}} <b>armored</b> vehicles and an infantry company. The Syrians pierced the Israeli defense, but their infantry was at some distance behind the tanks. The Israelis knocked out four Syrian tanks and four <b>armored</b> cars with 20mm cannons, PIATs and Molotov cocktails. Meanwhile, other defenders kept small arms fire on the Syrian infantry, who stopped in citrus groves a few hundred meters from the settlements. The surviving Syrian tanks withdrew back to the Golan. At 07:45, the Syrians halted their assault and dug in, still holding most of the territory between Degania Alef's fence and Samakh's police fort. They left behind a number of lightly damaged or otherwise inoperable tanks that the Israelis managed to repair.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, the Spanish Army {{counted on}} a tank force {{composed}} of 20 Panzer IVs, 10 StuG IIIs, 116 T-26s, 93 Panzer Is (including command vehicles), 60 CV-33s and 80 <b>armored</b> cars. In 1949 the <b>armored</b> regiment was reorganized into two battalions of 60 T-26s, with two command Panzer Is, six combat versions of the Panzer I and two CV-33, which were used for reconnaissance, each. A third battalion was composed of the 20 Panzer IVs, plus six Panzer Is. The regiment numbered an estimated 1,500 personnel and 100 tanks.|$|E
5|$|At {{the onset}} of the invasion, the Syrian force {{consisted}} of a reinforced infantry brigade, supplemented by at least one <b>armored</b> battalion (including Renault R35 tanks) and a field artillery battalion. The troops moved to Kafr Harib and were spotted by Haganah reconnaissance, but because the attack was not expected, the Israeli troops did not attack the invaders. At night between 15 and 16 May, the bulk of the Syrian forces set up camp in Tel al-Qasr in the southwestern Golan. One company with <b>armored</b> reinforcements split up to the south to proceed to the Jewish water station on the Yarmouk riverbank.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian {{forces in}} the area formed the {{southern}} flank of the Second Field Army. These units were the 21st <b>Armored</b> Division, commanded by Brigadier General Ibrahim Oraby, and the 16th Infantry Division, commanded by Brigadier General Abd Rab el-Nabi Hafez. In addition to being the division commander, Hafez also commanded forces within his division's bridgehead, which included the 21st Division. Oraby's unit included the 1st <b>Armored</b> Brigade, under Colonel Sayed Saleh; the 14th <b>Armored</b> Brigade, under Colonel Othman Kamel; and the 18th Mechanized Brigade, under Colonel Talaat Muslim. Hafez's 16th Division included the 16th Infantry Brigade, commanded by Colonel Abd el-Hamid Abd el-Sami', {{as well as the}} 116th Infantry and the 3rd Mechanized Brigades.|$|E
