5|$|A virus particle, {{also known}} as a virion, {{consists}} of genes made from DNA or RNA which <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> a protective coat of protein called a capsid. The capsid is made of many smaller, identical protein molecules which are called capsomers. The arrangement of the capsomers can either be icosahedral (20-sided), helical or more complex. There is an inner shell around the DNA or RNA called the nucleocapsid, which is formed by proteins. Some viruses <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> a bubble of lipid (fat) called an envelope.|$|E
5|$|The heart wall {{is made up}} {{of three}} layers: the inner endocardium, middle {{myocardium}} and outer epicardium. These <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> a double-membraned sac called the pericardium.|$|E
5|$|The outworks <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> a ditch, a covertway and a glacis.|$|E
50|$|Mannar is the {{one among}} the {{beautiful}} place in Kerala, because the southern side <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> paddy fields and eastern side <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> the river and north and west <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> hills.|$|R
50|$|Bath {{is one of}} {{only two}} UK Parliament {{constituencies}} to <b>be</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> another constituency. Bath <b>is</b> entirely <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> the North East Somerset constituency. The other constituency, York Central, <b>is</b> entirely <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> York Outer.|$|R
50|$|As {{the germ}} of a fruit <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> the {{perisperm}} so the spirit, properly so called, <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> an envelope which, by analogy, may be {{designated as the}} perispirit.|$|R
5|$|Icosahedral: Most animal viruses are {{icosahedral}} or near-spherical with chiral icosahedral symmetry. A regular icosahedron is {{the optimum}} way of forming a closed shell from identical sub-units. The {{minimum number of}} identical capsomeres required for each triangular face is 3, which gives 60 for the icosahedron. Many viruses, such as rotavirus, have more than 60 capsomers and appear spherical but they retain this symmetry. To achieve this, the capsomeres at the apices <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> five other capsomeres and are called pentons. Capsomeres on the triangular faces <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> six others and are called hexons. Hexons are in essence flat and pentons, which form the 12 vertices, are curved. The same protein may act as the subunit of both the pentamers and hexamers {{or they may be}} composed of different proteins.|$|E
5|$|The Wawa subprovince is a {{formerly}} active volcanic island chain, {{consisting of}} metamorphosed greenstone belts which <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> and cut by granitic plutons and batholiths. These greenstone belts consist of felsic volcanics, felsic batholiths, felsic plutons and sediments aged from 2,700 to 2,670 million years old.|$|E
5|$|The civil badge is a plain gold oval, bearing three crowns on the obverse side, and a rose, a thistle and a shamrock, {{emanating from}} a sceptre {{on the reverse}} side; both emblems <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> a ring bearing the motto of the Order.|$|E
50|$|An ambulacrum is an {{architectural}} {{term for the}} atrium, courtyard, or parvise {{in front of a}} basilica that <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> arcades or colonnades, often containing a fountain, and <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> trees.|$|R
50|$|The island {{itself is}} covered with trees but it <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> a beach around which is a lagoon. Outside this, the whole <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> a coral reef and the open ocean.|$|R
2500|$|The {{virus is}} {{approximately}} 122–180 nm {{in diameter and}} is composed of a double helix of DNA which contains about 172,000 base pairs and 85 genes. The DNA <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> a protein nucleocapsid. This nucleocapsid <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> a tegument made of protein, which in turn <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> an [...] envelope containing both lipids and surface projections of glycoproteins which are essential to infection of the host cell.|$|R
5|$|Although many Anahim volcanoes <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> Chilcotin Group basalt flows, {{the exact}} nature of their {{relationship}} is unknown. It is unlikely that the Anahim volcanoes ever were a source area for the Chilcotin basalts as they have distinct transitional geochemistries. The Chilcotin Group is interpreted to be related to back-arc extension behind the Cascadia subduction zone.|$|E
5|$|At the {{floodplain}} at {{the confluence of}} Ithan Creek and Darby Creek, the main trees species include silver maple, black willow, boxelder, and red maple. In the wetlands at this site, the main tree species include scattered black willow and silver maple. There are also patches of silky dogwood and wild rose, which <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> assorted wetland plants, including herbs, grasses, sedges, and rushes. However, numerous exotic plants also inhabit the site.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} twentieth century {{scientists}} had come to believe that cells <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> a thin oil-like barrier, but the structural nature of this membrane was not known. Two experiments in 1925 laid the groundwork to fill in this gap. By measuring the capacitance of erythrocyte solutions, Hugo Fricke determined that the cell membrane was 3.3nm thick.|$|E
50|$|The {{reverse of}} the medal depicts a trident <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> a laurel wreath. The wreath <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> a blue enamel ring {{containing}} the inscription FOR DISTINGUISHED SERVICE. Like the obverse, the blue enamel {{ring on the}} reverse <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> scroll waves.|$|R
50|$|Na2Te, {{like many}} related {{compounds}} with the formula M2X, adopts the antifluorite structure. Thus, in solid Na2Te each Te2− ion <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> eight Na+ ions and each Na+ ion <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> four Te2− ions.|$|R
50|$|The last {{assumption}} {{means that}} each cation <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> a spherically symmetric cloud of other ions. The cloud has a net negative charge. Similarly each anion <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> a cloud with net positive charge.|$|R
5|$|Bynesian decay usually starts when {{specimens}} {{are stored}} or displayed for considerable {{periods of time}} in an enclosed space. The storage method itself usually causes this problem, when containers, cabinets or display cases are entirely or partially made of wood, plywood or other wood products such as Masonite, or when the specimens <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by,</b> or in contact with, various other kinds of materials that are cellulose-based and can turn water vapor acidic.|$|E
5|$|Messers Run is {{flanked by}} areas prone to {{flooding}} during a 100 year flood {{from the mouth of}} Negro Hollow upstream to its headwaters. Negro Hollow and its unnamed tributaries are also surrounded by areas prone to flooding during a 100-year flood for much of their length. Both of the unnamed tributaries of Messers Run <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> such areas for the majority of their length.|$|E
5|$|Minnis Bay is {{a popular}} family beach with attractions such as sailing, windsurfing, cafes, beach huts, public houses, restaurants, a {{paddling}} pool and coastal walking/cycling routes. The beach has gained a European Blue Flag Award for its cleanliness and safety. The village has three other smaller beaches, which <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> chalk cliffs and cliff stacks. Wildlife that {{can be observed in}} the Thames Estuary includes seals, velvet swimming crabs and the migrant turnstone.|$|E

5|$|The Parish Church of St Edmund in East Mersea {{dates from}} around the 12th or 13th century, with {{extensions}} in the late 15th or 16th. The church and hall <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> a moat that {{is thought to be}} the remains of a Danish refuge after their defeat by King Alfred at Farnham.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> a fatty capsule and lie within the renal fascia, which also {{surrounds}} the kidneys. A weak wall of connective tissue called septum separates the glands from the kidneys. The adrenal glands are directly below the diaphragm, and {{are attached to}} the crura of the diaphragm by the renal fascia.|$|E
5|$|The outworks <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> a faussebraye, {{advanced}} ditch, covertway, and glacis. In the 1720s, a gate {{known as}} Porta dei Cannoni {{was built in}} the faussebraye. The gate was enlarged by the British, and became known as Porte des Bombes. It was eventually detached from the faussebraye to facilitate the flow of traffic, and it now looks like a triumphal arch.|$|E
50|$|The Justizwache corps badge {{shows the}} Austrian coat of arms, which <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> a {{circular}} enclosure. It thus deviates only marginally from the corps badge of the Federal Police, {{in which the}} Bundeswappen <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> an oak leaf wreath.|$|R
50|$|In {{the earlier}} Geordie lamps an oil lamp <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> glass. The {{top of the}} glass has a {{perforated}} copper cap with a gauze screen above that. The glass <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> a perforated metal tube to protect it.|$|R
50|$|Haţeg Island itself <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> {{primarily}} <b>by</b> a deep marine basin, {{unlike some}} of the surrounding islands and land masses which <b>were</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> shallow seas.|$|R
5|$|As Tyrion and Bronn head towards Tywin Lannister's camp, they <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> one of {{the barbarian}} hill tribes of the Vale. Tyrion convinces them to serve as his escorts by {{promising}} them gold, weapons and an army to help them seize the Vale of Arryn. Tywin is displeased, but agrees to keep Tyrion's promises if the hill tribes join {{the fight against the}} Starks. The tribesmen agree, but want Tyrion to follow them as insurance, much to Tyrion's discomfort.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales {{have two}} {{flippers}} on the front, near the head. Like all mammals, baleen whales breathe air and must surface periodically to do so. Their nostrils, or blowholes, are {{situated at the}} top of the cranium. Baleen whales have two blowholes, as opposed to toothed whales which have one. These paired blowholes are longitudinal slits that converge anteriorly and widen posteriorly, which causes a V-shaped blow. They <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> a fleshy ridge that keeps water away while the whale breathes. The septum that separates the blowholes has two plugs attached to it, making the blowholes water-tight while the whale dives.|$|E
5|$|Chicks hatch within 24 {{hours of}} each other. Six days after hatching, the chicks' eyes have opened and after eight days they {{are covered in}} whitish down. Chicks defecate outside of the nest by raising their tail {{to the side of}} the nest, so nests with older chicks <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> faecal matter. Both parents feed and brood the chicks, taking it in turns. When one parent returns with food, it takes over {{brooding}} duties while the other leaves to hunt.|$|E
