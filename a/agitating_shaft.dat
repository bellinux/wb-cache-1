Analysis of current situations Along {{with the advancement}} of urbanization in our country, the basic construction of Zaozhuang Tengzhou city is also just in the booming development, and the concrete machinery as well immediately develops stronger. Although the production enterprises of concrete batching plant and concrete mixing building are numerous, there exists a great shortage in the mixing station because of the limitation from regional economy. Begining with the design of the host of the HZS 150 <b>agitating</b> <b>shaft,</b> the author hopes to give rise to more public discussions and get more criticism...|$|E
40|$|Mixing {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{fundamental}} operations in chemical engineering. Stirred tanks are widely used in the manufacture of such materials as chemicals, paints, inks, electronics materials, ceramics, foods, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. Suitable mixing is indispensable to the purpose achievement of a process. Eccentric mixing, in which an impeller installed at eccentric position in a vessel, {{is one of the}} traditional methods of promoting mixing. An asymmetrical flow which occurs in vessel is complicated, and it promotes mixing, distribution, and mass transfer. In this study, a new mixing method which eccentric mixing using a large type impeller which attracts attention in recent years is shown. The high performance of a large impeller can be combined with the advantages of an eccentric impeller by using the impeller at an eccentric position. The power consumption and mixing time for MAXBLEND, which is a type of large impeller, were investigated. The power consumption, P, and mixing time, θ M, were measured under various eccentric conditions. The relation between the power number (N p) and Reynolds number (Re) and that between the dimensionless mixing time (nθ M) and Re were investigated. When eccentric mixing is used industrially, we should be concerned about the horizontal load to a <b>agitating</b> <b>shaft.</b> The large oscillating horizontal load causes serious problems, such as the falling off of the impeller or the breakage of the motor, mechanical seal or gearbox. It is, therefore, important to understand the relation between these values and the impeller rotational speed when designing the mixing equipment and determining the operating conditions. In this study, the torque and horizontal load were measured in eccentric mixing under various eccentric conditions. The averages of both, the torque and the horizontal load, and their standard deviations, corresponding to the amplitude of fluctuation, were shown.

50|$|Work is {{a process}} of {{transferring}} energy to or from a system in ways that can be described by macroscopic mechanical forces exerted by factors in the surroundings, outside the system. Examples are an externally driven <b>shaft</b> <b>agitating</b> a stirrer within the system, or an externally imposed electric field that polarizes the material of the system, or a piston that compresses the system. Unless otherwise stated, it is customary to treat work as occurring without its dissipation to the surroundings. Practically speaking, in all natural process, some of the work is dissipated by internal friction or viscosity. The work done by the system can come from its overall kinetic energy, from its overall potential energy, or from its internal energy.|$|R
