5|$|After {{reading about}} the case while in college, Peirce {{conducted}} extensive research for a screenplay, which she worked on for almost five years. The film focuses {{on the relationship between}} Brandon <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>girlfriend</b> Lana Tisdel. The script took dialogue directly from archive footage in the 1998 documentary The Brandon Teena Story. Many actors sought the lead role during a three-year casting process before Swank was cast. Swank was chosen because her personality seemed similar to Teena's. Most of the film's characters were based on real-life people; others were composites.|$|E

5|$|Hardy met {{his girlfriend}} Beth Britt in 1999, {{shortly after the}} Hardy Boyz had won the WWF Tag Team Championship for the first time. Hardy and his brother Matt went to a club in Southern Pines, North Carolina, where Hardy met her. On March 15, 2008, it was {{reported}} that Hardy's house had burned to the ground in a fire. Hardy <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>girlfriend</b> were not home at the time, but his dog, Jack, was killed in the fire. It is believed that the fire was started by faulty electrical wiring. In October 2008, Hardy was building a new home in the same area, which was expected to be completed by early 2009. In August 2010, Hardy announced that Britt was pregnant with the couple's first child, a daughter named Ruby Claire Hardy, who was born on October 19, 2010.

5|$|Ifs covers {{during the}} 1960s were {{typically}} action-oriented, showing monsters and aliens; {{and several of}} the stories Pohl published were directed at a younger audience. For example, Blish's Welcome to Mars, serialized under the title The Hour Before Earthrise in July to September 1966, was about a teenage genius whose antigravity device stranded him <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>girlfriend</b> on Mars. Ashley has suggested that If was attempting to acquire readership from the many new fans of science fiction who had been introduced to the genre through television, in particular via the popular 1960s shows Doctor Who and Star Trek. If also ran a friendly letter column, with more fan-oriented discussions than the other magazines, and between 1966 and 1968 a column by Lin Carter introduced readers to various aspects of science fiction fandom. These features are also likely to have appealed to a younger audience.|$|E

5|$|In the {{following}} 1987–1988 season, Rodman steadily improved his stats, averaging 11.6points and 8.7rebounds and starting in 32 of 82 regular season games. The Pistons fought {{their way into}} the 1988 NBA Finals, and took a 3–2 lead, but lost in seven games against the Los Angeles Lakers. In Game Six, the Pistons were down by one point with eight seconds to go; Dumars missed a shot, and Rodman just fell short of an offensive rebound and a putback which could have won the title. In Game Seven, L.A. led by 15points in the fourth quarter, but Rodman's defense helped cut down the lead to six with 3:52minutes to go and to two with one minute to go. But then, he fouled Magic Johnson, who hit a free throw, missed an ill-advised shot with 39seconds to go, and the Pistons never recovered. In that year, he <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>girlfriend</b> Annie had a daughter they named Alexis.|$|E
5|$|One of Groves' early {{problems}} {{was to find}} a director for Project Y, the group that would design and build the bomb. The obvious choice was one of the three laboratory heads, Urey, Lawrence, or Compton, but they could not be spared. Compton recommended Oppenheimer, who was already intimately familiar with the bomb design concepts. However, Oppenheimer had little administrative experience, and, unlike Urey, Lawrence, and Compton, had not won a Nobel Prize, which many scientists felt that the head of such an important laboratory should have. There were also concerns about Oppenheimer's security status, as many of his associates were Communists, including his brother, Frank Oppenheimer; his wife, Kitty; <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>girlfriend,</b> Jean Tatlock. A long conversation on a train in October 1942 convinced Groves and Nichols that Oppenheimer thoroughly understood the issues involved in setting up a laboratory in a remote area and should be appointed as its director. Groves personally waived the security requirements and issued Oppenheimer a clearance on 20 July 1943.|$|E

Krackpot then shoots Amber with his laser rifle and she transforms into a horrible creature.|$|E
5|$|Many of Oppenheimer's {{associates}} in {{the years}} before World War II were Communist Party USA members. They included his wife Kitty, whose first husband Joe Dallet had been killed fighting with the Lincoln Battalion in the Spanish Civil War; his brother Frank Oppenheimer and Frank's wife Jackie; <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>girlfriend</b> Jean Tatlock. One of his Communist associates was a colleague at the University of California, an assistant professor of French literature named Haakon Chevalier. The two had met during a rally for Spanish Loyalists, and had co-founded a branch of the American Federation of Teachers at Berkeley known as Local 349. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had opened a file on Oppenheimer in March 1941, after he had attended a December 1940 meeting at Chevalier's home that was also attended by the Communist Party's California state secretary William Schneiderman and its treasurer Isaac Folkoff, both of whom were targets of FBI surveillance and wiretaps. Agents had recorded the license plate of Oppenheimer's car. The FBI noted that Oppenheimer was on the Executive Committee of the American Civil Liberties Union, which it considered a Communist front. Shortly thereafter, the FBI added Oppenheimer to its Custodial Detention Index, for arrest in case of national emergency.|$|E
