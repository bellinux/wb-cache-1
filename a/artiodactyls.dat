5|$|Baleen {{whales are}} {{cetaceans}} classified under the parvorder Mysticeti, and consist of four extant families: Balaenidae (right whales), Balaenopteridae (rorquals), Cetotheriidae (pygmy right whale), and Eschrichtiidae (gray whale). Balaenids are distinguished by their enlarged head and thick blubber, while rorquals and gray whales generally have a flat head, long throat pleats, {{and are more}} streamlined than Balaenids. Rorquals {{also tend to be}} longer than the latter. Cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) and <b>artiodactyls</b> are now classified under the order Cetartiodactyla, often still referred to as Artiodactyla (given that the cetaceans are deeply nested with the <b>artiodactyls).</b> The closest living relatives to baleen whales are toothed whales both from the infraorder Cetacea.|$|E
5|$|Cetaceans and <b>artiodactyls</b> now are {{classified}} under the order Cetartiodactyla, often still {{referred to as}} Artiodactyla, which includes both whales and hippopotamuses. The hippopotamus and pygmy hippopotamus are the whale's closest terrestrial living relatives.|$|E
5|$|Dermotherium major {{was found}} in a lignite pit known as Wai Lek in Krabi Province, southwestern Thailand. It is part of the Krabi Basin fauna, which {{contains}} at least 40 mammalian genera, mostly <b>artiodactyls</b> but also including some primates, such as Siamopithecus, Wailekia, and Muangthanhinius. This fauna has been dated to about 33 to 35 million years ago, during the Late Eocene.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, Snively and Jessica M. Theodor {{conducted}} a {{finite element analysis}} by simulating head-impacts with CT scanned skulls of S. validum (UALVP 2), Prenocephale prenes and several extant head-butting <b>artiodactyls.</b> They found that the correlations between head-striking and skull morphologies found in the living animals also existed in the studied pachycephalosaurs. Stegoceras and Prenocephale both had skull shapes similar to the bighorn sheep with cancellous bone protecting the brain. They also shared similarities {{in the distribution of}} compact and cancellous regions with the bighorn sheep, white-bellied duiker and the giraffe. The white-bellied duiker was found to be the closest morphological analogue to Stegoceras; this head-butting species has a dome which is smaller but similarly rounded. Stegoceras was better capable of dissipating force than <b>artiodactyls</b> that butt heads at high forces, but the less vascularized domes of older pachycephalosaurs, and possibly diminished ability to heal from injuries, argued against such combat in older individuals. The study also tested the effects of a keratinous covering of the dome, and found it to aid in performance. Though Stegoceras lacked the pneumatic sinuses that are found below the point of impact in the skulls of head-striking <b>artiodactyls,</b> it instead had vascular struts which could have similarly acted as braces, as well as conduits to feed the development of a keratin covering.|$|E
5|$|Today, {{the closest}} living {{relatives}} of cetaceans are the hippopotamuses; these share a semi-aquatic ancestor that branched off from other <b>artiodactyls</b> some 60 mya. Around 40 mya, a common ancestor {{between the two}} branched off into cetacea and anthracotheres; nearly all anthracotheres became extinct {{at the end of}} the Pleistocene 2.5 mya, eventually leaving only one surviving lineage– the hippopotamus.|$|E
5|$|Histological {{examination}} {{reveals that}} pachycephalosaurid domes {{are composed of}} a unique form of fibrolamellar bone which contains fibroblasts that {{play a critical role}} in wound healing, and are capable of rapidly depositing bone during remodeling. Peterson et al. (2013) concluded that taken together, the frequency of lesion distribution and the bone structure of frontoparietal domes, lends strong support to the hypothesis that pachycephalosaurids used their unique cranial structures for agonistic behavior. CT scan comparisons of the skulls of Stegoceras validum, Prenocephale prenes, and several head-striking <b>artiodactyls</b> have also supported pachycephalosaurids as being well-equipped for head-butting.|$|E

5|$|The {{hippopotamus}} is {{the type}} genus of the family Hippopotamidae. The pygmy hippopotamus belongs to a different genus in Hippopotamidae, either Choeropsis or Hexaprotodon. Hippopotamidae are sometimes known as hippopotamids. Sometimes, the subfamily Hippopotaminae is used. Further, some taxonomists group hippopotamuses and anthracotheres in the superfamily Anthracotheroidea. Hippopotamidae are classified along with other even-toed ungulates in the order Artiodactyla. Other <b>artiodactyls</b> include camels, cattle, deer and pigs, although hippopotamuses are not closely related to these groups.|$|E
5|$|Remains {{assignable}} to Paraceratherium {{have been}} found in early to late Oligocene (34–23 million years ago) formations across Eurasia, in modern-day China, Mongolia, India, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria, and the Balkans. Their distribution may be correlated with the palaeogeographic development of the Alpine-Himalayan mountain belt. The range of Paraceratherium finds implies that they inhabited a continuous landmass with a similar environment across it, but this is contradicted by palaeogeographic maps that show this area had various marine barriers, so the genus was successful in being widely distributed despite this. The fauna which coexisted with Paraceratherium included other rhinoceroses, <b>artiodactyls,</b> rodents, beardogs, weasels, hyaenodonts, nimravids and cats.|$|E
5|$|The stomach of <b>Artiodactyls</b> {{is divided}} into four sections: the rumen, the reticulum, the omasum and the abomasum (only {{ruminants}} have a rumen). After the plant material is consumed, it is mixed with saliva in the rumen and reticulum and separates into solid and liquid material. The solids lump {{together to form a}} bolus (or cud), and is regurgitated. When the bolus enters the mouth, the fluid is squeezed out with the tongue and swallowed again. Ingested food passes to the rumen and reticulum where cellulytic microbes (bacteria, protozoa and fungi) produce cellulase, which is needed to break down the cellulose in plants. Perissodactyls, in contrast to the ruminants, store digested food that has left the stomach in an enlarged cecum, where it is fermented by bacteria. Carnivora have a simple stomach adapted to digest primarily meat, as compared to the elaborate digestive systems of herbivorous animals, which are necessary to break down tough, complex plant fibers. The caecum is either absent or short and simple, and the large intestine is not sacculated or much wider than the small intestine.|$|E

25|$|A 2007 {{paleontological study}} done in greater Matjhabeng began a {{programme}} of excavation {{of an early}} Pliocene locality. With an estimated age of 4.0-3.5 Ma, the locality also represents the only well-documented, river-deposited Pliocene locality in the central interior of southern Africa. After three years of excavation, a diverse fauna that includes fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals was recovered. Mammals ranged in size from rodents to mammoths, including an array of proboscideans, perissodactyls and <b>artiodactyls,</b> alongside rare carnivores.|$|E

Black bears, jaguars and sea otters historically populated the area, but their range has been restricted by human encroachment and the jaguar and the sea otter are now rarely, if ever, observed. Aquatic mammals {{included the}} gray whale, a seasonal migratory animal, as well as the bottlenose dolphin, killer whale, and California sea lion and on rare occasion, Guadalupe fur seal. In recent times the region has seen the rebound of <b>artiodactyls</b> such as the Peninsular bighorn sheep, a distinct population segment of the desert bighorn sheep.|$|E
25|$|The camelid lineage {{has a good}} fossil record. Camel-like {{animals have}} been traced from the {{thoroughly}} differentiated, modern species back through early Miocene forms. Their characteristics became more general, and they lost those that distinguished them as camelids; hence, they were classified as ancestral <b>artiodactyls.</b> No fossils of these earlier forms {{have been found in}} the Old World, indicating that North America was the original home of camelids, and that Old World camels crossed over via the Bering Land Bridge. The formation of the Isthmus of Panama three million years ago allowed camelids to spread to South America as part of the Great American Interchange, where they evolved further. Meanwhile, North American camelids died {{out at the end of}} the Pleistocene.|$|E
