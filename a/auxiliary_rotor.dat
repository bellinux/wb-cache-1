5000|$|The task of {{orienting}} {{the rotor}} {{into the wind}} was a complicated issue already for historical windmills. The first windmills able to rotate in order to [...] "face" [...] the wind appeared in the mid-18th century. Their rotatable nacelles were mounted on the main structure of the windmill using primitive wooden gliding bearings lubricated with animal fat. The necessary yawing torque was created by means of animal power, human power or even wind power (implementation of an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>rotor</b> known as fantail).|$|E

40|$|Auxiliary {{bearings}} {{are used}} to prevent rotor/stator contact in active magnetic bearing systems. They are sacrificial components providing a physical limit on the rotor displacement. During rotor/auxiliary bearing contact significant forces normal to the contact zone may occur. Furthermore, rotor slip and rub can lead to localized frictional heating. Linear control strategies may also become ineffective or induce instability due to changes in rotordynamic characteristics during contact periods. This work considers the concept of using actively controlled auxiliary bearings in magnetic bearing systems. Auxiliary bearing controller design is focused on attenuating bearing vibration resulting from contact and reducing the contact forces. Controller optimization {{is based on the}} H-infinity norm with appropriate weighting functions applied to the error and control signals. The controller is assessed using a simulated rotor/magnetic bearing system. Comparison of the performance of an actively controlled auxiliary bearing is made with that of a resiliently mounted <b>auxiliary</b> bearing. <b>Rotor</b> drop tests, repeated contact tests, and sudden rotor unbalance resulting in trapped contact modes are considered...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The {{search for}} {{replacement}} of commutator and brushes in conventional DC motors by electronic commutator {{has resulted in}} a class of Permanent Magnet Brush Less (PMBL) motors. The operation of PMBL motor requires synchronization of coil currents with the instantaneous rotor position. The applied voltages of higher magnitudes must have same zero crossings as that of speed induced back EMF of the respective stator windings. The complexity of rotor position detection in PMBL motor is overcome by obtaining a replica of stator induced EMF using additional <b>auxiliary</b> stator and <b>rotor.</b> The <b>auxiliary</b> stator winding induced EMF is amplified using Power Operational Amplifier (P-OPAMP) and the output is connected to the main stator winding. The proposed scheme has been tested at laboratory scale and {{has been found to be}} a promising alternative scheme for operation of PMBLDC/AC motors...|$|R
50|$|Another {{historical}} innovation was the fantail. This {{device was}} actually an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>rotor</b> equipped with plurality of blades and located downwind {{of the main}} rotor, behind the nacelle in a 90° (approximately) orientation to the main rotor sweep plane. In the event of change in wind direction the fantail would rotate thus transmitting its mechanical power through a gearbox (and via a gear-rim-to-pinion mesh) to the tower of the windmill. The effect of the aforementioned transmission was {{the rotation of the}} nacelle towards the direction of the wind, where the fantail would not face the wind thus stop turning (i.e. the nacelle would stop to its new position).|$|E

We studied all the adsorbents - Absorbents available by comparing their features. With these efforts, we have developed a honeycomb rotor which impregnates synthetic zeolite in submicron particle, and subsequently invented a double-utility dehumidifying system with two rotors: a main rotor with synthetic zeolite and an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>rotor</b> with lithium chloride. Based on this invention, we made a trial model of dehumidifier for the purpose of providing performance tests. With the result of our trials that enabled us to grasp the features of the system, we have just stepped into the merchandising of our development. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with a new excitation system in which a voltage is induced by the flux density harmonics of the air-gap in an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>rotor</b> winding supplying the field winding through a rectifier. The system is brushless and self-regulated. The applicability of various harmonics for producing the excitation current is studied; {{it has been shown}} that the field current component proportional to the resulting air-gap flux can only be obtained by means of permeance variations due to irregularities of the stator air-gap face. The field current component proportional to the load current can be produced by harmonics due to the stator winding distribution. Experimental studies were made with a generator of 3  kVA size, in which the first slot harmonic was utilized to create the excitation current. The generator has characteristics similar to those of conventional compounded synchronous generators. The measurements show that the method presented for calculating the terminal voltage gives a satisfactory result in practice. reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} in the Langley V/STOL tunnel {{to determine the effect}} of the main-rotor wake on the aerodynamic characteristics of the rotor systems research aircraft. A 1 / 6 -scale model with a 4 -blade articulated rotor was used to determine the effect of the rotor wake for the compound configuration. Data were obtained over a range of angles of attack, angles of sideslip, <b>auxiliary</b> engine thrusts, <b>rotor</b> collective pitch angles, and rotor tip-path plane angles for several main-rotor advance ratios. Separate results are presented for the forces and moments on the airframe, the wing, and the tail. An analysis of the test data indicates significant changes in the aerodynamic characteristics. The rotor wake increases the longitudinal static stability, the effective dihedral, and the lateral static stability of the airframe. The rotor induces a downwash on the wing. This downwash decreases the wing lift and increases the drag. The asymmetrical rotor wake induces a differential lift across the wing and a subsequent rolling moment. These rotor induced effects on the wing become smaller with increasing forward speed...|$|R
40|$|The NDARC code {{performs}} {{design and}} analysis tasks. The design task involves sizing the rotorcraft to satisfy specified design conditions and missions. The analysis tasks can include off-design mission performance analysis, flight performance calculation for point operating conditions, and generation of subsystem or component performance maps. The principal tasks (sizing, mission analysis, flight performance analysis) {{are shown in}} the figure as boxes with heavy borders. Heavy arrows show control of subordinate tasks. The aircraft description consists of all the information, input and derived, that denes the aircraft. The aircraft consists {{of a set of}} components, including fuselage, rotors, wings, tails, and propulsion. This information can be the result of the sizing task; can come entirely from input, for a fixed model; or can come from the sizing task in a previous case or previous job. The aircraft description information is available to all tasks and all solutions. The sizing task determines the dimensions, power, and weight of a rotorcraft that can perform a specified set of design conditions and missions. The aircraft size is characterized by parameters such as design gross weight, weight empty, rotor radius, and engine power available. The relations between dimensions, power, and weight generally require an iterative solution. From the design flight conditions and missions, the task can determine the total engine power or the rotor radius (or both power and radius can be fixed), as well as the design gross weight, maximum takeoff weight, drive system torque limit, and fuel tank capacity. For each propulsion group, the engine power or the rotor radius can be sized. Missions are defined for the sizing task, and for the mission performance analysis. A mission consists of a number of mission segments, for which time, distance, and fuel burn are evaluated. For the sizing task, certain missions are designated to be used for design gross weight calculations; for transmission sizing; and for fuel tank sizing. The mission parameters include mission takeoff gross weight and useful load. For specified takeoff fuel weight with adjustable segments, the mission time or distance is adjusted so the fuel required for the mission equals the takeoff fuel weight. The mission iteration is on fuel weight or energy. Flight conditions are specified for the sizing task, and for the flight performance analysis. For the sizing task, certain flight conditions are designated to be used for design gross weight calculations; for transmission sizing; for maximum takeoff weight calculations; and for anti-torque or <b>auxiliary</b> thrust <b>rotor</b> sizing. The flight condition parameters include gross weight and useful load. For flight conditions and mission takeoff, the gross weight can be maximized, such that the power required equals the power available. A flight state is defined for each mission segment and each flight condition. The aircraft performance can be analyzed for the specified state, or a maximum effort performance can be identified. The maximum effort is specified in terms of a quantity such as best endurance or best range, and a variable such as speed, rate of climb, or altitude...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was performed to}} examine the wake characteristics and aeromechanic performance of an innovative twin-rotor wind turbine (TRWT) in comparison with those of a conventional single-rotor wind turbine (SRWT). The comparative {{study was conducted in}} a large-scale Aerodynamic/Atmospheric Boundary Layer (AABL) wind tunnel with the TRWT and SRWT model sited in simulated atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) winds under neutral stability conditions. In addition to measuring the power outputs of the TRWT and SRWT models, dynamic wind loads acting on the wind turbine models were also investigated in detail. Furthermore, a high-resolution PIV system was used for detailed wake flow field measurements (free-run and phase-locked) in order to quantify the characteristics of the turbulent turbine wake flows and to quantitatively visualize the transient behavior of the unsteady vortex structures behind the wind turbine models. The detailed flow field measurements are correlated with the dynamic wind loads and power output measurements to elucidate the underlying physics for higher total power generation and better durability of the wind turbines.
