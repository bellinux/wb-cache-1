5|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that some trees are interconnected through their root system, forming a colony. The interconnections are made by the inosculation process, a kind of natural grafting or welding of vegetal tissues. The tests to demonstrate this networking are performed by injecting chemicals, sometimes radioactive, into <b>a</b> <b>tree,</b> <b>and</b> then checking for its presence in neighbouring trees.|$|E
5|$|The Memorial Grove honors Bronxites {{who served}} in World War II and the Korean War. It is located by {{the road to the}} Van Cortlandt House, close to Broadway. Created in 1949, the grove {{contained}} <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> <b>and</b> a bronze plaque for each of the 39 soldiers who were memorialized. By the time the grove was renovated in 2011, there were only 18 plaques left. Restoration was completed in 2012.|$|E

5|$|A cryptozoologist named Lincoln Anderson, a {{biologist}} named Wendy Gardner, and a hunter named Cameron Caine visit {{the town and}} have a brief meeting with Overman to discuss capturing the shark. With six of his friends, armed with guns, Mike ventures into the forest to hunt the shark. The shark kills each person except for Mike. Following this, Chapman, Lincoln, Wendy, and Cameron {{make their way into}} the woods, armed with a miniature crossbow, a shotgun, and a motion-sensing camera. They set up the camera on <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> <b>and</b> depart. At the town bar, Professor Hoffman enters, having gone into hiding and now wearing an eyepatch. Later, he and a grieving Mike drink beers.|$|E
5|$|Andrea (Laurie Holden) and Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus) go out {{in search}} of Sophia Peletier (Madison Lintz), {{following}} her mother Carol (Melissa McBride) weeping for her loss. Daryl tells Andrea about his childhood, and expresses {{hope that they will}} successfully locate Sophia. They stumble upon an abandoned campsite, where a person had committed suicide by hanging themselves from <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> <b>and</b> now has become an undead walker. Daryl insists that they leave the walker alone, but Andrea firmly refuses. He asks her if she wants to continue living, to which she exclaims uncertainty. Daryl euthanizes the walker as they leave. Upon returning to the camp, Dale Horvath (Jeffrey DeMunn) attempts to reconcile with Andrea by returning her handgun.|$|E
5|$|As Sayid and John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) {{discuss the}} attack on Sayid, Locke {{suggests}} that Sawyer is the culprit, since he is doing well for himself on the island, hoarding other people's possessions, and also seems to dislike Sayid. Meanwhile, Shannon begins to have trouble breathing due to her lack of medication and panic resulting from this problem. Jack tries beating answers out of Sawyer by punching him, but stops when he sees others' disapproval. Then with Jack's approval, Sayid ties Sawyer to <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> <b>and</b> tortures him for answers, revealing that he has tortured people before.|$|E

5|$|Besides {{classes and}} {{vocational}} workshops, the orphanage operated its own printing press and bindery where it produced its own textbooks, Braille books, and German-language newspapers. It also operated a flour mill and bakery that produced 35,000 {{loaves of bread}} a year, a laundry and clothing-repair service, a carpentry, a pottery factory that produced all the clay utensils used in the orphanage, and <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> <b>and</b> plant nursery. At {{the beginning of the}} 20th century, a large brick and tile factory was erected on the premises, which produced one million bricks and 250,000 tiles annually.|$|E
5|$|Common {{starlings}} {{will take}} over Eurasian nuthatch nest holes, reducing their breeding success. This {{is most likely to}} occur if the nest is high in <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> <b>and</b> there is a good local breeding density of the nuthatch. Introduced ring-necked parakeets may also compete with Eurasian nuthatches for nesting holes. The parakeets tend to occur in fragmented urban woodlands, while nuthatches prefer large old oak woodlands, which reduces the level of competition. Ornithologists conducting a 2010 Belgian study suggested that the problem was not so severe as to warrant culling of the parakeets.|$|E
5|$|Hill has {{experienced}} only one major accident in her climbing career. On May 9, 1989, she fell during a climb in Buoux, France; after forgetting {{to tie a}} safety rope, she fell 85ft (25m) into <b>a</b> <b>tree,</b> <b>and</b> was knocked unconscious, dislocated her left elbow and broke a bone in her foot. She had been training hard for the World Cup and had to stop competing {{for a few months}} to recover; she was devastated to miss the first World Cup in the sport. However, only six weeks after her fall, she was back climbing.|$|E

5|$|Like other {{nuthatch}}es, the white-breasted nuthatch forages for insects on {{trunks and}} branches {{and is able}} to move head-first down trees. Seeds form a substantial part of its winter diet, as do acorns and hickory nuts that were stored by the bird in the fall. The nest is in a hole in <b>a</b> <b>tree,</b> <b>and</b> the breeding pair may smear insects around the entrance as a deterrent to squirrels. Adults and young may be killed by hawks, owls, and snakes, and forest clearance may lead to local habitat loss, but this is a common species with no major conservation concerns over most of its range.|$|E
5|$|Stan and Kyle meet Wendy at Stark's Pond, {{where she}} {{suggests}} using the machine lodged inside Cartman {{to contact the}} visitors.

The alien spaceship arrives and Ike jumps to safety. In the meantime, the visitors communicate with the cows in the area, having found them to be the most intelligent species on the planet. Cartman is again abducted by the aliens and returns to the bus stop the following day with pinkeye.|$|E

5|$|The {{species is}} found in {{southeast}} Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and southwest Western Australia in open forest and woodland, and is a common visitor to urban gardens and parks. Loud and conspicuous, the red wattlebird is generally found in trees, where it gets most of its food; occasionally it forages on the ground. It {{is one of the}} largest nectarivorous birds in the world, feeding from a wide variety of flowering plants. Insects also comprise part of its diet. It is territorial and at times aggressive to birds of other species, often defending rich sources of nectar. Breeding throughout its range, the red wattlebird builds a cup-shaped nest in <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> <b>and</b> raises one to two broods a year. Although it has declined in places from land clearing, it is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E

5|$|While Native hunters did {{not rely}} on dogs, white hunters {{utilized}} them from Colonial times; George Washington is credited with owning {{some of the first}} coon hunting dogs, French hounds given to him by the Marquis de Lafayette. Most of the early coon dogs were actually Foxhounds imported from Europe or mixed breeds with hound blood, but these dogs often had trouble finding raccoons when the latter climbed trees, and breeders began to specifically develop dogs for their treeing ability: the ability to follow the scent to the base of <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> <b>and</b> stay there until the hunter came.|$|E
5|$|A Company moved south, shaking {{out into}} an open {{formation}} across a frontage of , with 2 Platoon {{on the right and}} 3 Platoon on the left, while 1 Platoon was in depth. Already in the dense vegetation, 2 Platoon—under Second Lieutenant Graham Ackland—had only advanced 150metres when a sniper was spotted in <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> <b>and</b> was subsequently shot by the platoon sergeant. Almost simultaneously, 3 Platoon was engaged with small arms fire, while behind them the company headquarters was engaged by more snipers. 2 Platoon assaulted straight into the main Viet Cong position with grenades and machine-guns. Breaking-in they moved forward, killing a number of Viet Cong in their weapon pits but suffering six casualties in less than a minute, with a third of the lead platoon falling wounded in the initial volleys. Pinned down and in trouble, Ackland realised that he was facing a sizable and well dug-in force and he attempted to move his sections into an all-round defensive perimeter in order to defend against any counter-attack; the Viet Cong did not attack however and instead remained in their pits. In an attempt to relieve 2 Platoon, O'Brien manoeuvred 1 and 3 Platoons, while requesting B Company support his right flank as soon as they arrived at the landing zone.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with those}} trivial messages, gandingans {{were also used}} in more seriously matters when {{signaling}} to others of imminent danger. During martial law, gandingans were used to warn villagers of incoming Marcos’ soldiers. Every time the villagers received the signal, they would disappear leaving the soldiers aloof until the soldiers themselves brought in a translator who told them, the gandingan {{was responsible for the}} scurry. So they arrested the gandingan player. A similar story talks about a brother of a man who stole someone’s carabao. In order to keep his brother from getting arrested, the brother set up a gandingan up in <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> <b>and</b> would clang it every time the police arrived to warn his brother to leave their house. But like Marcos’ soldiers, the police bought a translator and so they were finally able to arrest the theft for stealing and the brother on the gandingan for obstruction of justice.|$|E
