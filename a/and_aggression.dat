5|$|A creative, hard-working, and {{technically}} gifted playmaker {{who played}} as an attacking midfielder, Gascoigne was capable both of scoring {{and setting up}} goals, due to his passing accuracy and his powerful striking ability. Gascoigne was gifted with pace, physical strength, balance, and excellent dribbling skills, which allowed him to protect the ball, beat opponents, and withstand physical challenges. Despite his talent, he was also criticised for his erratic behaviour <b>and</b> <b>aggression</b> on the pitch. His turbulent and often unhealthy lifestyle off the pitch, {{as well as his}} tendency to pick up injuries, is thought to have affected his career.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} associations between borderline personality (BP) traits and reactive <b>and</b> proactive <b>aggression,</b> <b>and</b> to compare the meditational effects of maladaptive coping in samples of older adolescents (n = 133) and young adults (n = 93), which has not hitherto been explored. This was a cross-sectional study that used self-report measures to assess BP traits on a continuum, trait-based reactive <b>and</b> proactive <b>aggression,</b> <b>and</b> coping strategies. In adults, maladaptive emotional coping significantly mediated the relationship between BP <b>and</b> reactive <b>aggression,</b> <b>and</b> maladaptive avoidant coping mediated the relationship between BP and proactive aggression; no significant mediational effects were found for adolescents. These findings highlight potential explanations for associations between BP traits and reactive <b>and</b> proactive <b>aggression</b> in young adults, and indicate that reactive aggression in adult BPs could be decreased by reducing emotional coping, <b>and</b> proactive <b>aggression</b> by reducing avoidant coping.

40|$|High {{prevalence}} rates and negative outcomes of peer-based <b>aggression</b> <b>and</b> victimization during early adolescence underscore {{the need to}} identify causes and consequences of these outcomes. Limited research has examined the impact of environmental and contextual factors, such as school climate, on peer <b>aggression</b> <b>and</b> victimization. Few studies have addressed relations between school climate and specific subtypes of physical <b>and</b> relational <b>aggression</b> <b>and</b> victimization. Although school climate has been assessed via interpersonal subsystems (i. e., student-student and student-teacher relationships), little research has incorporated the role of student awareness and reporting of violence and safety concerns. Further, studies are needed that consider the bi-directional relations between school climate <b>and</b> peer <b>aggression</b> <b>and</b> victimization over time. To address these limitations, the current longitudinal study examined associations between school climate (i. e., student-student and student-teacher relationships and awareness/reporting) <b>and</b> peer <b>aggression</b> <b>and</b> victimization over six months among a sample of 265 middle school students...|$|R

5|$|Elephants have a fission–fusion {{society in}} which {{multiple}} family groups come together to socialise. Males ("bulls") leave their family groups when they reach puberty and may live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate and enter a state of increased testosterone <b>and</b> <b>aggression</b> known as musth, which helps them gain dominance and reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers {{for as long as}} three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell, and sound; elephants use infrasound, and seismic communication over long distances. Elephant intelligence has been compared with that of primates and cetaceans. They appear to have self-awareness and show empathy for dying or dead individuals of their kind.|$|E
5|$|Lords of Shadow is a third-person action-adventure game {{in which}} the player {{controls}} the main character, Gabriel Belmont. The combat involves a retractable chain whip called the Combat Cross. The player can perform up to forty unlockable combos with it. The commands consist of direct attacks for dealing damage to single enemies, and weak area attacks when surrounded by them. It is also capable of interactions with secondary weapons, such as knives, holy water and other items which can be upgraded. In addition, the Combat Cross's melee skills can be combined with the Light and Shadow magic system, which are spells aimed at defense <b>and</b> <b>aggression,</b> respectively. The whip is upgradeable and {{can also be used}} to guard against an opponent's attack.|$|E
5|$|No {{medications}} directly {{treat the}} core symptoms of AS. Although {{research into the}} efficacy of pharmaceutical intervention for AS is limited, {{it is essential to}} diagnose and treat comorbid conditions. Deficits in self-identifying emotions or in observing effects of one's behavior on others can make it difficult for individuals with AS to see why medication may be appropriate. Medication can be effective in combination with behavioral interventions and environmental accommodations in treating comorbid symptoms such as anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, inattention <b>and</b> <b>aggression.</b> The atypical antipsychotic medications risperidone and olanzapine have been shown to reduce the associated symptoms of AS; risperidone can reduce repetitive and self-injurious behaviors, aggressive outbursts and impulsivity, and improve stereotypical patterns of behavior and social relatedness. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline have been effective in treating restricted and repetitive interests and behaviors.|$|E
40|$|Aggression {{is one of}} the {{characteristic}} traits that have been related with sport participation that leads to unsportsmanlike behavior among athletes and may contribute into violence. Meanwhile, life aggression is the athlete’s behavior while they are not participating in their competitive sport. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify the relationship between life <b>aggression</b> <b>and</b> sport <b>aggression</b> among athletes. In addition, the differences between life <b>aggression</b> <b>and</b> sport <b>aggression</b> were also explored. A total of 450 male and female SUKIPT athletes aged between 1 8 - 2 6 years old from different contact and non-contact sports were selected through purposive sampling participated in this study. Buss Durkee Hostility Inventory Subscales (BDHI) <b>and</b> Bredemeier Athletic <b>Aggression</b> Inventory - Short Form (BAAGI) was used to assess life <b>aggression</b> <b>and</b> sport <b>aggression.</b> Results show that there was no significant difference of life <b>aggression</b> between male <b>and</b> female athletes (p>. 05). However, there is a significant difference of life <b>aggression</b> between contact <b>and</b> non-contact sport (p<. 05). Results also show that there was a significant difference of sport <b>aggression</b> between male <b>and</b> female athletes (p<. 05), contact and non-contact sport (p<. 05). Pearson Correlation showed that there was a moderate and positive correlation between life <b>aggression</b> <b>and</b> sport <b>aggression</b> (r=. 46) among athletes. Subsequently, Multiple regression analysis showed that type of sport has higher influence on sport aggression compared to gender of participants (ẞ = 72, p<. 05). In conclusion, relationship between life <b>aggression</b> <b>and</b> sport <b>aggression</b> among SUKIPT athletes was at a moderate level, however, efforts to identify the <b>aggression</b> factors <b>and</b> promotion of prevention program by sport psychologist on aggression would be beneficial in reducing <b>aggression</b> <b>and</b> increased the sportsmanship values among athletes...|$|R

5|$|Inquisitive foxes will rotate and flick {{their ears}} whilst sniffing. Playful {{individuals}} will perk their ears and rise on their hind legs. Male foxes courting females, or after successfully evicting intruders, will turn their ears outwardly, {{and raise their}} tails in a horizontal position, with the tips raised upward. When afraid, red foxes grin in submission, arching their backs, curving their bodies, crouching their legs and lashing their tails {{back and forth with}} their ears pointing backwards and pressed against their skulls. When merely expressing submission to a dominant animal, the posture is similar, but without arching the back or curving the body. Submissive foxes will approach dominant animals in a low posture, so that their muzzles reach up in greeting. When two evenly matched foxes confront each other over food, they approach each other sideways and push against each other's flanks, betraying a mixture of fear <b>and</b> <b>aggression</b> through lashing tails and arched backs without crouching and pulling their ears back without flattening them against their skulls. When launching an assertive attack, red foxes approach directly rather than sideways, with their tails aloft and their ears rotated sideways. During such fights, red foxes will stand on each other's upper bodies with their forelegs, using open mouthed threats. Such fights typically only occur among juveniles or adults of the same sex.|$|E
5|$|Many insects possess very {{sensitive}} and, or specialized organs of perception. Some insects such as bees can perceive ultraviolet wavelengths, or detect polarized light, while the antennae of male moths can detect the pheromones of female moths over distances of many kilometers. The yellow paper wasp (Polistes versicolor) {{is known for}} its wagging movements as a form of communication within the colony; it can waggle with a frequency of 10.6±2.1Hz (n=190). These wagging movements can signal the arrival of new material into the nest <b>and</b> <b>aggression</b> between workers can be used to stimulate others to increase foraging expeditions. There is a pronounced tendency for there to be a trade-off between visual acuity and chemical or tactile acuity, such that most insects with well-developed eyes have reduced or simple antennae, and vice versa. There are a variety of different mechanisms by which insects perceive sound; while the patterns are not universal, insects can generally hear sound if they can produce it. Different insect species can have varying hearing, though most insects can hear only a narrow range of frequencies related to the frequency of the sounds they can produce. Mosquitoes have been found to hear up to 2kHz, and some grasshoppers can hear up to 50kHz. Certain predatory and parasitic insects can detect the characteristic sounds made by their prey or hosts, respectively. For instance, some nocturnal moths can perceive the ultrasonic emissions of bats, which helps them avoid predation. Insects that feed on blood have special sensory structures that can detect infrared emissions, and use them to home in on their hosts.|$|E

40|$|Although, {{there has}} been a surge in {{research}} examining indirect forms of aggression, many of the theoretical frameworks and models associated with aggression have predominantly focused on physical aggression. As a result, many of the conclusions drawn about aggressive behavior have been drawn from data conducted with males. This study examined the degree of similarity between physical <b>and</b> social <b>aggression</b> among young adult female perpetrators. Specifically, it determined how similar the correlational profiles between social <b>and</b> physical <b>aggression</b> were on underlying traits and processes that have historically been thought to underlie physical aggression. The secondary goal was to examine the degree of similarity between proactive and reactive forms of social <b>aggression</b> <b>and</b> physical <b>aggression</b> on the same underlying traits. One-hundred nineteen college women living in cooperative housing completed self-reports of behavior and personality (using the NEO-PI to assess the Five Factor Model), peer nominations of social <b>aggression,</b> <b>and</b> laboratory tasks (e. g., social information processing vignettes and a facial emotional expression recognition task). Inter-class correlations between the correlational profiles for social <b>aggression</b> <b>and</b> physical <b>aggression</b> revealed only a moderate degree of similarity for both self- and peer-reports. Test of dependent correlations showed that physical aggression had a stronger positive relationship to the tendency to believe that the person will act similarly in the future, has a stronger negative relationship to number of sad morphs, has a stronger positive relationship to anger errors, and a stronger positive relationship to both (lack of) premeditation <b>and</b> perseverance. Social <b>aggression</b> had a stronger positive association with sad errors and extraversion. It {{should be noted that the}} analyses exploring subtypes of social <b>aggression</b> <b>and</b> physical <b>aggression</b> were conducted with self-report data. Additionally, the proactive subscale reliabilities were low, thus the following results should be interpreted with caution. Inter-class correlations highlighted a moderate difference between proactive social <b>and</b> physical <b>aggression</b> <b>and</b> reactive social <b>and</b> physical <b>aggression.</b> Proactive physical aggression demonstrated a strong positive link to the belief that the person acted with negative intentions, the belief that the behavior was the result of negative personality characteristics, and sensation seeking behavior. Reactive physical aggression demonstrated a strong positive link to the tendency to believe that the person will act similarly in the future, a negative link to conscientiousness, and strong positive link to both (lack of) premeditation and perseverance. In addition to the above-noted problem with the reliabilities of the proactive aggression scales, inconsistent findings on the EEMT and the failure to replicate previous findings using the SIP tasks also limited the conclusions that could be drawn. Future research directions aimed at differentiating physical <b>aggression</b> <b>and</b> social <b>aggression</b> that overcome current limitations are discussed. ...|$|R
