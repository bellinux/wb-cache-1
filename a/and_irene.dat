5|$|Tropical Depression Nine {{formed from}} a {{tropical}} wave west of Cape Verde {{on the afternoon}} of August 4, the second Cape Verde-type storm of the season. The system encountered dry air and wind shear as it turned to the northwest and it broke down. Despite poor organization and shearing winds, it became Tropical Storm Irene on August 7.

5|$|Although {{no longer}} a Rangers employee, Smythe was invited to the Rangers' opening game in Madison Square Garden by Tex Rickard, an {{invitation}} he nearly turned down because he had felt the Rangers had short-changed him. Hammond paid Smythe $7,500 to settle his contract, and Smythe felt he was owed $10,000. At the insistence of his wife Irene, they traveled to New York and attended the opener in Rickard's private box. When the Rangers won the game, surprising the Montreal Maroons, Rickard offered Smythe a vice-presidency with the club. Smythe turned the Rangers down, {{partly because of the}} disputed $2,500, although Rickard ordered Hammond to pay off the rest. On the return trip to Toronto, Conn <b>and</b> <b>Irene</b> visited Montreal, where Smythe bet the $2,500 on a football game between Toronto and McGill. He then bet the $5,000 he won on the Rangers to defeat the St. Pats in Toronto, winning again, turning the $2,500 into $10,000 in three days. The Rangers won the Stanley Cup in 1928, their second year of existence, largely with the players Smythe had brought to the team.|$|E
5|$|Catherine Rottenberg {{argues that}} Larsen’s novella {{is a prime}} example of race and gender norms portrayed in the US. The main characters, Irene and Clare, and their {{struggle}} with their own identification problems in the novel, helps readers understand the difference between gender and race norms. These two central characters are able to pass as white women even though Irene does not fully pass over, and Rottenberg argues the difference between Clare <b>and</b> <b>Irene</b> by re-evaluating the idea of desire/identification. The mis-identification Clare deals with stems from her re-connection with Irene after twelve years of not speaking. Seeing Irene sparked a desire in Clare for her to get back in touch with her African-American culture. Irene's identification trouble is associated with her need to feel safe and in control in her life, the main reason Irene chooses to pass over only on occasion. Irene doesn't want to put herself into a dangerous situation.|$|E
