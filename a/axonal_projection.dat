5|$|Evidence from {{microelectrode}} recordings {{from the}} brains of animals shows that dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra are strongly activated by {{a wide variety of}} rewarding events. These reward-responsive dopamine neurons in the VTA and substantia nigra are crucial for reward-related cognition and serve as the central component of the reward system.The brain reward circuitry that is targeted by addictive drugs normally mediates the pleasure and strengthening of behaviors associated with natural reinforcers, such as food, water, and sexual contact. Dopamine neurons in the VTA are activated by food and water, and dopamine release in the NAc is stimulated by the presence of natural reinforcers, such as food, water, or a sexual partner....The NAc and VTA are central components of the circuitry underlying reward and memory of reward. As previously mentioned, the activity of dopaminergic neurons in the VTA appears to be linked to reward prediction. The NAc is involved in learning associated with reinforcement and the modulation of motoric responses to stimuli that satisfy internal homeostatic needs. The shell of the NAc appears to be particularly important to initial drug actions within reward circuitry; addictive drugs appear to have a greater effect on dopamine release in the shell than in the core of the NAc.... If motivational drive is described in terms of wanting, and hedonic evaluation in terms of liking, it appears that wanting can be dissociated from liking and that dopamine may influence these phenomena differently. Differences between wanting and liking are confirmed in reports by human addicts, who state that their desire for drugs (wanting) increases with continued use even when pleasure (liking) decreases because of tolerance.}} The function of dopamine varies in each <b>axonal</b> <b>projection</b> from the VTA and substantia nigra; for example, the VTA–nucleus accumbens shell projection assigns incentive salience ("want") to rewarding stimuli and its associated cues, the VTA–orbitofrontal cortex projection updates the value of different goals in accordance with their incentive salience, the VTA–amygdala and VTA–hippocampus projections mediate the consolidation of reward-related memories, and both the VTA–nucleus accumbens core and substantia nigra–dorsal striatum pathways are involved in learning motor responses that facilitate the acquisition of rewarding stimuli.

Here, we analyzed the dendritic geometry and electrical excitability of these interneurons. First, dendritic polarity, measured based on the insertion points of primary dendrites on the soma surface, yielded a continuous one-dimensional measure without a clustering of dendritic polarity types. Secondly, we analyzed polar and vertical distributions of dendritic length. A cluster analysis allowed the definition of 7 types of dendritic arborization. Thirdly, when dendritic polarity was related to the intrinsic electrical excitability we found that the ratio of frequency adaptation in trains of action potentials (APs) evoked by current injection was correlated with the number of primary dendrites. Numerical simulations of spiking patterns in L 2 / 3 interneurons suggested that the number of primary dendrites could account for up to 50 % of this correlation. Fourthly, dendritic arborization was not correlated with <b>axonal</b> <b>projection,</b> and <b>axonal</b> <b>projection</b> types could not be predicted by electrical excitability parameters.

We have explored the potential of transplanted immature neurons to repair a specific <b>axonal</b> <b>projection</b> in an entorhino-hippocampal slice culture model system. When slices of immature entorhinal cortex (EC) from tau-GFP transgenic mice were cultured next to slices from postnatal hippocampus, an <b>axonal</b> <b>projection</b> from the E 18 embryonic entorhinal cortex to the dentate gyrus of the postnatal hippocampus developed, which {{was similar to that}} observed in control cultures.

This projection terminated specifically in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, the normal target area of the entorhino-hippocampal projection. When embryonic tissue from the presumptive brainstem area was used, there was still a subpopulation of fibers with a specific termination in the outer molecular layer, but few specific fibers were found in cocultures with embryonic midbrain. Our results show that very immature cortical neurons are potentially able to form an entorhino-hippocampal projection that terminates in a correct lamina-specific fashion in the dentate gyrus.

40|$|The <b>axonal</b> <b>projection</b> {{pattern of}} sensory neurons {{typically}} is regulated by environmental signals, but how different sensory afferents can establish distinct projections {{in the same}} environment remains largely unknown. Drosophila class IV dendrite arborization (C 4 da) sensory neurons project subtype-specific axonal branches in the ventral nerve cord, and we show that the Tripartite motif protein, Anomalies in sensory axon patterning (Asap) is a critical determinant of the <b>axonal</b> <b>projection</b> patterns of different C 4 da neurons. Asap is highly expressed in C 4 da neurons with both ipsilateral and contralateral axonal projections, but the Asap level is low in neurons that have only ipsilateral projections. Mutations in asap cause a specific loss of contralateral projections, whereas overexpression of Asap induces ectopic contralateral projections in C 4 da neurons. We also show by biochemical and genetic analysis that Asap regulates Netrin signaling, {{at least in part}} by linking the Netrin receptor Frazzled to the downstream effector Pico. In the absence of Asap, the sensory afferent connectivity within the ventral nerve cord is disrupted, resulting in specific larval behavioral deficits.

We analyzed the <b>axonal</b> <b>projection</b> of layer 2 / 3 (L 2 / 3) interneurons with reference to geometric landmarks of cortical columns by staining neurons in acute slices of rat barrel cortex (P 20 -P 29) and a subsequent cluster analysis using morphological parameters that described the spatial distribution of axons.

Control animals had approximately symmetrical horizontal projections toward C- and E-row columns in both supra- and infragranular layers. Following DEpairing, the density of axons in supragranular layers projecting from the labeled neurons in the D 2 column was higher in E- than in C-row columns. This asymmetry resulted primarily from a reduction in projection density toward the deprived C-row columns. In contrast, no change was observed in infragranular layers. The results indicate that DE-pairing during early postnatal development results in reduced <b>axonal</b> <b>projection</b> from nondeprived into deprived columns and that cortical neurons are capable of structural rearrangements at subsets of their axonal arbors...|$|E
40|$|SummaryProper {{arrangement}} of <b>axonal</b> <b>projections</b> into topographic maps {{is crucial for}} brain function, especially in sensory systems. An important mechanism for map formation is pretarget axon sorting, in which topographic ordering of axons appears in tracts before axons reach their target, but this process remains poorly understood. Here, we show that selective axon degeneration {{is used as a}} correction mechanism to eliminate missorted axons in the optic tract during retinotectal development in zebrafish. Retinal axons are not precisely ordered during initial pathfinding but become corrected later, with missorted axons selectively fragmenting and degenerating. We further show that heparan sulfate is required non-cell-autonomously to correct missorted axons and that restoring its synthesis at late stages in a deficient mutant is sufficient to restore topographic sorting. These findings uncover a function for developmental axon degeneration in ordering <b>axonal</b> <b>projections</b> and identify heparan sulfate as a key regulator of that process...|$|R

Neurons are labeled in vivo based on their anatomical or functional properties and, using patch clamp pipettes, their RNA individually harvested in vitro for RNAseq. We validate the methodology using multiple established molecularly and anatomically distinct cell populations and explore molecular differences between uncharacterized neurons in mouse visual cortex.

In addition we quantified the dendritic geometry and electrical excitability of 3 types of the L 2 / 3 INs: "local," "lateral," and "translaminar" inhibitors (Helmstaedter et al. 2008 b). Here, we used an iterated cluster analysis (iCA) that combines <b>axonal</b> <b>projection</b> patterns with dendritic geometry and electrical excitability parameters to identify "groups" of INs, from a sample of 39 cells. The iCA defined 9 groups of INs. We propose a hierarchical scheme for identifying L 2 / 3 INs. First, L 2 / 3 INs can be classified as 4 types of axonal projections. Second, L 2 / 3 INs can be subclassified as 9 groups with a high within-group similarity of dendritic, axonal, and electrical parameters. This scheme of identifying L 2 / 3 INs may help to quantitatively describe inhibitory effects on sensory stimulus representations in L 2 / 3 of cortical columns...|$|E
