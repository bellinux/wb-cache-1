40|$|Demand {{fulfillment}} is {{a planning}} process which {{is concerned with}} the processing of customer orders. Its main objectives are providing a high customer service, especially in terms of providing real-time order confirmations and promising reliable delivery dates, as well as maximizing profits. In make-to-stock industries, such as the consumer goods industry, production quantities are usually determined mid-term, based on forecasts and not on actual customer requests. As a consequence, bottleneck situations can occur in the short-run. Furthermore, customers are usually heterogeneous regarding their profitability and their strategic importance. Consequently, the firm has to decide carefully on which orders to accept and whether to fulfill an accepted order from stock or from future production quantities, which entails either inventory holding or customer-specific backlogging costs. The setting in make-to-stock demand fulfillment is comparable to the situation in service industries: capacity is scarce in the short-run, customers are heterogeneous, and demand is uncertain. Therefore, quantity-based revenue management ideas have been transferred to the context of make-to-stock industries. However, typical revenue management assumptions like the perishability of products do not hold in the make-to-stock context. As a consequence, the <b>allocation</b> <b>planning</b> problemâ€™s complexity increases. Existing <b>allocation</b> <b>planning</b> models for make-to-stock industries show two main drawbacks: they either do not consider information about demand uncertainty appropriately or they are not scalable and, thus, not applicable to problems of practical sizes. Commercial advanced planning systems also provide the opportunity of determining allocations by means of simple rules. However, they also do not consider information about demand uncertainty (nor about customer heterogeneity) appropriately. The dissertation shows how <b>allocation</b> <b>planning</b> for demand fulfillment in make-to-stock industries can be improved by means of two-stage stochastic linear programming (SLP) with recourse. SLP formulations for both the single-period and the multi-period case are given. Moreover, the dissertation illustrates that <b>allocation</b> <b>planning</b> can be further improved if information about the consumption process, which follows the <b>allocation</b> <b>planning</b> process, is integrated into the <b>allocation</b> <b>planning</b> SLP model. In particular, information about the order arrival sequence as well as about consumption policies such as nesting or time-based policies is integrated by means of the second stage. The benefit of both performing <b>allocation</b> <b>planning</b> and considering information about demand uncertainty by using two-stage SLP depends on the input data like, e. g. the degree of customer heterogeneity, of capacity shortage as well as of demand uncertainty (or the forecast accuracy, respectively). Within a numerical study, we evaluate when <b>allocation</b> <b>planning</b> is likely to be beneficial and, in case it is, when SLP models are likely to outperform the <b>allocation</b> <b>planning</b> rules of commercial advanced planning systems or other existing <b>allocation</b> <b>planning</b> models...|$|R

This model was applied to a medium irrigation scheme in India as a case study, to obtain the land and water <b>allocation</b> <b>plans.</b> These optimal <b>allocation</b> <b>plans</b> were compared to those obtained by using the model with the existing approach (full irrigation with a fixed irrigation interval of 21 days in Rabi and 14 days in summer season).

40|$|Water {{allocation}} {{is facing}} profound challenges due {{to climate change}} uncertainties. To identify adaptive water allocation strategies that are robust to climate change uncertainties, a model framework combining many-objective robust decision making and biophysical modeling is developed for large rivers. The framework {{was applied to the}} Pearl River basin (PRB), China where sufficient flow to the delta is required to reduce saltwater intrusion in the dry season. Before identifying and assessing robust water <b>allocation</b> <b>plans</b> for the future, the performance of ten state-of-the-art MOEAs (multi-objective evolutionary algorithms) is evaluated for the water allocation problem in the PRB. The Borg multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (Borg MOEA), which is a self-adaptive optimization algorithm, has the best performance during the historical periods. Therefore it is selected to generate new water <b>allocation</b> <b>plans</b> for the future (2079 â€“ 2099). This study shows that robust decision making using carefully selected MOEAs can help limit saltwater intrusion in the Pearl River Delta. However, the framework could perform poorly due to larger than expected climate change impacts on water availability. Results also show that subjective design choices from the researchers and/or water managers could potentially affect the ability of the model framework, and cause the most robust water <b>allocation</b> <b>plans</b> to fail under future climate change. Developing robust <b>allocation</b> <b>plans</b> in a river basin suffering from increasing water shortage requires the researchers and water managers to well characterize future climate change of the study regions and vulnerabilities of their tools. </p...|$|R
40|$|Implementation of an EU-wide {{emissions}} trading system {{by means of}} National <b>Allocation</b> <b>Plans</b> {{is at the core}} of European environmental policy agenda. Member States are faced with the problem of allocating their national emission budgets under the EU Burden Sharing Agreement between energy-intensive sectors that are eligible for international {{emissions trading}} and the remaining segments of their economies that will be subject to complementary domestic emission regulation. The country-specific segmentation of national emission budgets between trading sectors and non-trading sectors will determine the cost efficiency of the EU emissions trading system and the gains for each Member State vis-?-vis domestic abatement policies. We present an interactive simulation model where users can specify the design of National <b>Allocation</b> <b>Plans</b> for each EU Member State and then evaluate the induced economic effects. Our numerical framework is based on marginal abatement cost curves for (emissions) trading and non-trading sectors of the EU- 15 economies. Illustrative simulations highlight the importance of a coordinated design of National <b>Allocation</b> <b>Plans</b> in order to avoid substantial excess costs of regulation and drastic burden shifting between nontrading and trading sectors...|$|R

Different scenarios are simulated in order to highlight the effects of the grandfathering of permits to energy-intensive installations, the use of the project-based mechanisms (CDM and JI), and the restriction imposed by the supplementarity criterion.

40|$|The {{upcoming}} European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) {{is one of}} {{the more}} controversial climate policy instruments. Predictions about its likely impact and its performance can at present only be made to a certain degree.

In this paper we identify key features and key impacts of the EU ETS by scanning the range of likely <b>allocation</b> <b>plans</b> using the simulation model DART. The analysis of the simulation results highlights a number of interesting details in terms of allowance trade flows between member countries, of allowance prices, and of the role of the accession countries in the ETS.
