The mechanical part chosen for this investigation is an <b>axle</b> <b>guard</b> of running gear elements of the Hccrrs 2 x 2 axle car-carrying wagon. The static and fatigue strength analysis procedure according to the UIC 517 standard and numerical methods have been applied. Material properties were determined experimentally and the necessary numerical calculations were performed by using the finite element method. The observed <b>axle</b> <b>guard</b> is exposed to low cycle fatigue. Îµ-N curves and material properties of the S 355 J 2 +N steel grade are obtained by combining theoretical formulae and a mathematical function. According to the obtained experimental and numerical results the number of cycles until failure for both shapes of axle guards is obtained...|$|E

The end frames have central pivots, around which they swivel freely, while the middle frame is so arranged that it can slide transversely. The three frames are connected together by articulated radiating gear, so that they act sympathetically, and, no matter how sharp the curve, each axle instantly assumes a position coincident with the radial lines of that curve, instead of remaining parallel to each other as in the ordinary construction, in which the wheels grind their way along the sides of the rails. The wear and tear of tires and rails is thus greatly reduced, because the flanges of the tires are always parallel with the rails." ...|$|R
