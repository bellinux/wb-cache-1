5|$|All whales have <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> {{layer of}} blubber. In species that {{live near the}} poles, the blubber can be as thick as 11 inches. This blubber can help with {{buoyancy}} (which is helpful for a 100-ton whale), protection to some extent as predators {{would have a hard}} time getting through <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> layer of fat, and energy for fasting when migrating to the equator; the primary usage for blubber is insulation from the harsh climate. It can constitute as much as 50% of a whale's body weight. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with thick lanugos.|$|E
5|$|Cetaceans {{includes}} whales, dolphins and porpoises. They are the mammals most fully {{adapted to}} aquatic {{life with a}} spindle-shaped nearly hairless body, protected by <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> layer of blubber, and forelimbs and tail modified to provide propulsion underwater.|$|E

5|$|Odontocetes possess {{teeth with}} {{cementum}} cells overlying dentine cells. Unlike human teeth, which are composed mostly of enamel on {{the portion of}} the tooth outside of the gum, whale teeth have cementum outside the gum. Porpoises, like other odontocetes, possess only one blowhole. Breathing involves expelling stale air from the blowhole, forming an upward, steamy spout, followed by inhaling fresh air into the lungs. All porpoises have <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> layer of blubber. This blubber can help with insulation from the harsh underwater climate, protection to some extent as predators {{would have a hard time}} getting through <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> layer of fat, and energy for leaner times. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with a covering of fine, downy hair known as lanugo.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 3, the local weather station {{reported}} clear conditions due to a malfunction, while <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> layer of fog rolled onto the highway. Dozens of vehicles including several semi-trailers quickly crashed into each other shortly after 8a.m., one following another in the dense fog, and the accumulating wreckage caught traffic travelling in the opposite direction.|$|E
5|$|River {{dolphins}} have {{a relatively}} thin layer of blubber. Blubber can help with buoyancy, protection from predators (they {{would have a hard}} time getting through <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> layer of fat), energy for leaner times, and insulation from harsh climates. The habitats of river dolphins lack these needs.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of erosion of {{sandstone}} and the erosion-resistant sills and dikes, the topography in Minnesota has repeated parallel hills and valleys. The tightly packed lakes in the narrow valleys are long and narrow, and they orient from the east to west. The cliffs in these narrow valleys are the habitat to several rare plants which prefer living in narrow cliff areas in a sub-Arctic climate. In Ontario the Rove Formation is overlain by <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> diabase cap.|$|E
5|$|Birth {{usually takes}} place in the water and {{typically}} produces a single pup weighing 1.4 to 2.3kg (3 to 5lb). Twins occur in 2% of births; however, usually only one pup survives. At birth, the eyes are open, ten teeth are visible, and the pup has <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> coat of baby fur. Mothers have been observed to lick and fluff a newborn for hours; after grooming, the pup's fur retains so much air, the pup floats like a cork and cannot dive. The fluffy baby fur is replaced by adult fur after about 13 weeks.|$|E
