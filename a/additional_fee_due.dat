50|$|Within {{one month}} after the filing of an application, a filing fee and a search <b>fee</b> are <b>due.</b> <b>Additional</b> <b>fees</b> may also be due {{depending}} on the size of the application and the number of claims. Namely, if the application comprises more than 35 pages, an <b>additional</b> <b>fee</b> is <b>due</b> (of 14 Euros, as of February 2014) for the 36th and each subsequent page. Furthermore, if the application contains more than fifteen claims at the time of filing, claim <b>fees</b> are <b>due.</b> As of February 2014, a claims fee of 225 Euros is due for the 16th and each subsequent claim up to the limit of 50, and a claims fee of 555 Euros for the 51st and each subsequent claim.|$|R
5000|$|If {{the payment}} of a renewal fee for a European patent {{application}} is not made in due time, the renewal fee may still be validly paid within 6 months of the due date, provided that the <b>additional</b> <b>fee</b> provided by [...] is paid within the 6 months as well. For the calculation of the 6-month additional period, the so-called de ultimo ad ultimo rule is applied by the EPO. According to this rule, the six-month period runs [...] "from {{the last day of}} the month to {{the last day of the}} month". For instance, if a renewal <b>fee</b> was <b>due</b> in February 2004, the <b>additional</b> <b>fee</b> fell <b>due</b> on August 31, 2004 (Tuesday), i.e. 6 months from the end of February 2004.|$|R
50|$|In the PRC, {{state schools}} are funded and {{administered}} by the education sector within the government. Although some, especially high schools, have started to charge a fair portion of parents of students an <b>additional</b> tuition <b>fee,</b> <b>due</b> to the increased places offered by the schools in recent years. Top state schools are often very selective, however. Students who miss their entrance requirement may still gain places if they meet a relatively lower requirement and their parents {{are willing to pay}} for the <b>additional</b> <b>fees.</b> Some parents appreciate the idea as they may send their children to good schools even though they may not be academically qualified, while others believe that it is not fair for someone who has a background of poverty.|$|R
5000|$|An <b>additional</b> <b>fee</b> is however <b>due</b> [...] "in {{the case}} of a divisional {{application}} filed in respect of any earlier application which is itself a divisional application". In other words, an <b>additional</b> <b>fee</b> for the filing of divisional applications of the second or any further generation was introduced. The amount of the <b>additional</b> <b>fees</b> was announced in December 2013. The purpose of the <b>additional</b> <b>fee</b> is [...] "to discourage the filing of long sequences of divisional applications", so as to also discourage [...] "the prolongation of pendency periods". The [...] "use of divisional applications as a tool for prolonging the pendency of subject-matter before the EPO" [...] has been regarded by the EPO as [...] "detrimental to legal certainty for third parties as well as to patent office workloads".|$|R

5000|$|If the {{applicant}} {{disagrees with the}} ISA’s finding of lack of unity of invention, the <b>additional</b> <b>fees</b> may be paid under protest. In the protest procedure, {{the applicant}} files a reasoned statement explaining why it considers that the requirement of unity of invention has been complied with, or {{that the number of}} <b>additional</b> <b>fees</b> required is excessive. After payment of the <b>additional</b> search <b>fees</b> and, if required, of a protest fee, the protest is examined by a review body. If the review body finds the protest justified, it orders the total or partial reimbursement of the <b>additional</b> search <b>fees,</b> and, if applicable, the protest fee, to the applicant. When, for instance, the European Patent Office acts as ISA, the review body in charge of examining the protest consists of three members: [...] "the head of a directorate, normally the head of the directorate by which the invitation to pay <b>additional</b> <b>fees</b> was issued, an examiner with special expertise in unity of invention and, normally, the examiner who issued the invitation." ...|$|R
50|$|H-1B-dependence {{itself does}} not trigger any <b>additional</b> <b>fees.</b> However, at various points {{in the history of}} H-1B law, <b>additional</b> <b>fees</b> have been levied on {{employers}} satisfying conditions similar to H-1B-dependency. These are employers who have more than 50 full-time employee equivalents and with the number of H-1B and L-1 nonimmigrants at present equal to more than 50% of their current number of FTE equivalents. The corresponding threshold for H-1B-dependency is 15%, but one way these thresholds differ is that the 50% threshold for the <b>additional</b> <b>fees</b> requires the employer to count people in H-1B as well as people in L-1 status. Also, unlike the case of additional LCA attestations, there is no exemption for people based on how much they are earning or their educational qualifications.|$|R
