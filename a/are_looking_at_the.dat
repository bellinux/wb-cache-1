5|$|In {{the wake}} of remarks against India in Western media, Jessica Valenti, writing in The Nation, argued that such rapes are also common in the United States, but US {{commentators}} exhibit a double standard in denying or minimising their systemic nature while simultaneously attacking India for an alleged rape culture. Author and activist Eve Ensler, who organised One Billion Rising, a global campaign to end violence against women and girls, said that the gang rape and murder {{was a turning point}} in India and around the world. Ensler said that she had travelled to India {{at the time of the}} rape and murder and that after having worked every day of my life for the last 15 years on sexual violence, I have never seen anything like that, where sexual violence broke through the consciousness and was on the front page, nine articles in every paper every day, in the centre of every discourse, in the centre of the college students' discussions, in the centre of any restaurant you went in. And I think what's happened in India, India is really leading the way for the world. It's really broken through. They are actually fast-tracking laws. They are looking at sexual education. They <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bases of patriarchy and masculinity and how all that leads to sexual violence.|$|E

Specifically, they {{will discuss the}} interaction (pathway) between a specific 'sphere' and the 'event' (hurricane). Working in groups, students will be assigned a specific sphere to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> more closely in relation to hurricanes. When all groups are finished, each will present their findings to the class for comparison and a closer look. If the group is assigned the Hydrosphere they will <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> oceans in the Live Access Server (LAS), if the group is assigned the Lithosphere <b>the</b> group will <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Land Surface in the LAS, if the group is assigned the Biosphere they will <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Biosphere in the LAS and the group that is assigned <b>the</b> Atmosphere will <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Atmosphere in the LAS.

25|$|In December 2012, the Canadian {{government}} decided that F-35 costs were {{much higher than}} earlier anticipated and hence <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Eurofighter as well as four other fighters to replace their ageing CF-18s. In January 2014 it seemed unlikely that a decision on a replacement would be taken before the next federal election in October 2015. This election occurred, and while Canada was leaning more towards US fighters like the F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet or back to the F-35, as of June 2017 protectionist rhetoric by the US government (and a trade complaint by Boeing against Bombardier) has caused the Canadian government to stop discussions about acquiring the Super Hornet and look at other, potentially non-US options.|$|E
25|$|Though {{companies}} were hired {{for work on}} the pilot episode—such as Entity FX for the visual effects—effects departments now work exclusively for the series. Ivan Hayden is the visual effects supervisor, and works with many levels of the production staff. During pre-production, Hayden must go through the scripts, looking for possible visual effects. He then has a concept meeting with the writers, and after settling on the effect designs to use, coordinates with the special effects and stunt departments. Hayden is also present during filming to help the director {{make sure that the}} scenes are being filmed in the best way for the visual effects, such as by ensuring that the actors <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> correct location where an effect will later be added. Afterward, he then meets with the editors. Another aspect of the visual effects department is coming up with rules and physics for each supernatural creature, though the rules are often bent if it benefits the story. In 2012, it was announced that Hayden will be working at the new Vancouver location of Encore for its VFX division.|$|E

A reference book, Doctor Who: The Visual Dictionary, describes the exhibit behind the Doctor's and Rose's heads when they <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Cyberman's helmet as the decayed head of a Sea Devil from the Jon Pertwee serial The Sea Devils.|$|E

500|$|Bewick {{sometimes}} used his fingerprint {{as a form}} of signature, (accompanied by the words [...] "Thomas Bewick his mark"), as well as engraving it in one of his tail-pieces as if it had clouded the tiny image of a rustic scene with a cottage by mistake. Uglow notes one critic's suggestion that Bewick may have meant we <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> scene through a playfully smudged window, as well as drawing our attention to Bewick, the maker. Adrian Searle, writing in The Guardian, describes the tiny work as [...] "A visual equivalent to the sorts of authorial gags Laurence Sterne played in Tristram Shandy, it is a marvellous, timeless, magical joke".|$|E
500|$|The SIII's HD Super AMOLED display {{measures}} [...] on the diagonal. With a 720×1280-pixel (720p) resolution, its 306 pixel {{per inch}} (PPI, {{a measure of}} pixel density) is a relatively high, which is accommodated by the removal {{one of the three}} subpixels—red, green and blue—in each pixel to create a PenTile matrix-display; consequently, it does not share the [...] "Plus" [...] suffix found on the SII's Super AMOLED Plus display. The glass used for the display is the damage-resistant corning Gorilla Glass 2, except for S3 Neo variant. The device's software includes a feature known as [...] "Smart Stay", which uses the device's front camera to detect whether the user's eyes <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> screen, and prevents the screen from automatically turning off while the user is still looking at it.|$|E
500|$|British critic Leslie Halliwell {{states the}} film's {{influence}} as [...] "it {{led directly to}} all the kaleidoscopic swinging London spy thrillers and comedies of the later sixties". In particular, the visuals and storyline are credited with inspiring The Monkees' television series. The [...] "Can't Buy Me Love" [...] segment borrowed stylistically from Richard Lester's earlier The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film, {{and it is this}} segment, in particular using the contemporary technique of cutting the images to the beat of the music, which has been cited as a precursor of modern music videos. Roger Ebert goes even further, crediting Lester for a more pervasive influence, even constructing [...] "a new grammar": [...] "he influenced many other films. Today when we watch TV and see quick cutting, hand-held cameras, interviews conducted on the run with moving targets, quickly intercut snatches of dialogue, music under documentary action and all the other trademarks of the modern style, we <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> children of A Hard Day's Night". In an interview for the DVD re-release of A Hard Day's Night, Lester said he had been labelled the father of MTV and had jokingly responded by asking for a paternity test.|$|E

Entering {{one of the poorest}} quarters, he receives conflicting reports and contemplates leaving, thinking the incident is a hoax. The narrator then sees a village woman chasing away children who <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> corpse of an Indian whom the elephant has trampled and killed. He sends an order to bring an elephant rifle and, followed by a group of roughly a few thousand people, heads toward the paddy field where the elephant has rested in its tracks.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike the edicts of Ashoka, {{however, the}} {{majority}} of the inscriptions from this early period in Sri Lanka are found above caves, are only a few words in length and [...] "rarely say anything more than the name of the donor (who paid for the renovation of the cave, presumably); sometimes the donor's profession and village-of-origin are added, and sometimes the reader may be unable to guess if they <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> name of a person, profession or village, but can see that it is a name in any case (and not a philosophical statement)."

2500|$|As {{early as}} 1982 when the Compact Disc was being introduced, Blyth {{researched}} {{the possibilities of}} creating a digital mixing console. He told Billboard magazine that Soundcraft would not be [...] "leaping into digital {{in the way that}} Neve has done. I think they have gone too far, too quickly.... We <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> digital control of analog functions as the first step in that direction." [...] Picking up the pace in the 2000s, Blyth, together with Product Manager Andy Brown, created the Soundcraft Vi6, a digital mixer intended for sound reinforcement applications, released mid-2006. Its interface was a development of Vistonics, a broadcast and studio mixing concept from Harman-owned Studer combined with a digital effects package from Lexicon. Regarding digital audio equipment, Blyth is of the opinion that [...] "companies that take great care over their analog stages, use the best internal digital format and write the best DSP code end up with the best sounding product." [...] He said that he has [...] "strong views on the whole subject of digital consoles, which could fill an article with mostly purple prose", but he notes that [...] "best-in-class analog product these days is truly excellent, but so is digital." [...] Blyth continues today as technical director at Soundcraft Studer's design offices at Potters Bar, [...] north of London.|$|E
