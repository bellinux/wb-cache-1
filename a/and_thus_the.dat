5|$|Further scandal {{followed}} in the 1926–27 season when title-winners Torino Football Club were stripped of their Scudetto following an FIGC investigation.

5|$|In modern Polish historiography the battle's {{outcome is}} seen as a victory, if a very costly one, for the Polish and Soviet troops.

5|$|After relegation from Scotland's top flight, East Stirlingshire was {{controversially}} {{merged with}} Clydebank Juniors in 1964.
