40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} {{the demand for}} organs for transplantation and to recommend a reorganization of transplantation services in Quebec. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Province of Quebec, 1988 to 1992. PATIENTS: All patients on waiting lists for organ transplantation and patients who received transplants registered in national data banks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The actual <b>annual</b> <b>demand</b> for organ transplantation {{and the rate of}} transplantations performed. RESULTS: The rates of heart transplantation were lower than the actual <b>annual</b> <b>demand,</b> which resulted in many patients dying while awaiting transplantation. The actual <b>annual</b> <b>demand</b> for heart transplantation decreased during the last 5 years from 10. 9 per million people in 1987 to 6. 7 in 1992. The rates of heart transplantation in Quebec were higher than the Canadian average. The actual demand for lung transplantation was only 2. 9 per million people on average in 1992. Demand for liver transplantation increased annually, reaching 8. 6 per million in 1992. The rate of transplantation increased likewise but remained insufficient. The demand for kidney transplantation reached 27. 2 per million people in 1992, and the transplantation rate was 17. 8. CONCLUSIONS: Taking into account the actual demand for and supply of organ transplantation, to insure high-quality service and to control costs associated with organ transplantation, we recommend that the present system in Quebec be reorganized so that transplantations are performed in 12 centres: 7 for kidney transplantation, 2 for hearts, 2 for livers and 1 for lungs...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the processing of}} sorghum and finger millet flour in Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda. Fifty-three companies processing these crops were interviewed in 2011 - 2012.

Most firms operated below capacity because of demand constraints, inconsistent supply of raw material, and fluctuating prices for grain. Procurement of grain was primarily through traders operating without formal contracts. Two-thirds of processors in Kenya and one-third of processors in Tanzania and Uganda had experience of sourcing directly from farmers; however, because of problems enforcing contracts and with transport, they preferred to buy from traders. The main buyers of flour from these processors were urban supermarkets and small retail shops. Most processors did not have formal contracts with buyers except in Uganda. Although 62...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to know the dynamics of suppling and demanding rice in era before and after regional autonomy in Sukoharjo Regency and to analyzed forecast of them in Sukoharjo Regency on 2011 – 2015. The basic method applied in this research is analytical descriptive method. The research object is taken purposively, that is Sukoharjo Regency. The method of analysis data in this research is (1) Box-Jenkins (ARIMA) method with fourth steps, include identification, parameter estimation, diagnostic checking, and forecasting; (2) Chow Breakpoint Test; and (3) simultaneous equation method. The result got from this research is the annual supply rice data have a fluctuation pattern with increase trend. It is not stationary and become stationary in first differencing. The result of parameter estimation judged that tentative model for the annual supply rice is ARIMA (0, 1, 1). The result of diagnostic checking judged that the best ARIMA model is ARIMA (0, 1, 1) with RMSE value is 5. 186, 376; R 2 value is 0, 850311; F-statistic value is 79, 52704; and parameter of MA is significant because probabilistic value is less than 0, 05. The <b>annual</b> <b>demand</b> rice data have an increased and linear trend. It is not stationary and become stationary in second differencing. The result of parameter estimation judged that tentative model for the <b>annual</b> <b>demand</b> rice is ARIMA (1, 2, 1). After diagnostic checking test, the best ARIMA model for the <b>annual</b> <b>demand</b> rice is ARIMA (2, 2, 1) with RMSE value is 677, 4671; R 2 value is 0, 947327; F-statistic value is 53, 95478; and parameter of MA(1) and AR(1) are significant because the value of probability is less than 0, 05. Chow Breakpoint Test showed that in 2000 was a period which affected <b>annual</b> supply and <b>demand</b> of rice, with F-statistic value is 3, 033932 and this probability is significant. In simultaneous equation model, estimation result showed that the model had value of R 2 is 0, 644626; value of F-statistic is 5, 462146; value of RMSE is 8. 823, 807; and probabilistic value of F-statistic is significant. Regional autonomy not affected in supply and demand of rice. It is because rule of regional government less than main government in capital country. The result of forecasting <b>annual</b> supply and <b>demand</b> of rice in 2011 – 2015 showed <b>annual</b> <b>demand</b> rice tended increase while annual supply decreased. The suggestion based on this research is to increase the variety of rice seed through find out the best rice seed that resistant from plant disease; to change plant system for protect the element and quality of soil; to use together and massive system for eliminate plant disease, and to increase budget allocation for agriculture communication and also assistance for rice farmer if the farmer got any problems about rice cultivation. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} {{focusing}} in implementing inventory {{models in the}} management of Eightdesigns Sdn Bhd or also known as EDZ. EDZ has been operating since 2008 but yet has never practice the inventory models in their business and management.
