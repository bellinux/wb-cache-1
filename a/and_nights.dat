5|$|To the west, in Gujarat, diverse climate {{conditions}} obtain. The winters are mild, pleasant, and dry with average daytime temperatures around 29°C (84°F) <b>and</b> <b>nights</b> around 12°C (54°F) with virtually full sun and clear nights. Summers are hot and dry with daytime temperatures around 41°C (106°F) <b>and</b> <b>nights</b> no lower than 29°C (84°F). In {{the weeks before}} the monsoon temperatures {{are similar to the}} above, but high humidity makes the air more uncomfortable. Relief comes with the monsoon. Temperatures are around 35°C (95°F) but humidity is very high; nights are around 27°C (81°F). Most of the rainfall occurs in this season, and the rain can cause severe floods. The sun is often occluded during the monsoon season.|$|E
5|$|Based upon data {{taken from}} the United States using these methods, cirrus cloud cover was found to vary diurnally and seasonally. The {{researchers}} found that in the summer, at noon, the cover is the lowest, {{with an average of}} 23% of the United States' land area covered by cirrus. Around midnight, the cloud cover increases to around 28%. In winter, the cirrus cloud cover did not vary appreciably from day to night. These percentages include clear days <b>and</b> <b>nights,</b> as well as days <b>and</b> <b>nights</b> with other cloud types, as lack of cirrus cloud cover. When these clouds are present, the typical coverage ranges from 30% to 50%. Based on satellite data, cirrus covers an average of 20% to 25% of the Earth's surface. In the tropical regions, this cloud covers around 70% of the region's surface area.|$|E
5|$|Because of Copenhagen's {{northern}} latitude, {{the number}} of daylight hours varies considerably between summer and winter. On the summer solstice, the sun rises at 04:26 and sets at 21:58, providing 17 hours 32 minutes of daylight. On the winter solstice, it rises at 08:37 and sets at 15:39 with 7 hours and 1 minute of daylight. There is therefore a difference of 10 hours and 31 minutes in the length of days <b>and</b> <b>nights</b> between the summer and winter solstices.|$|E

5|$|The Muslims found {{themselves}} in greater difficulties by day. Food was running short, <b>and</b> <b>nights</b> were colder. The lack of sleep made matters worse. So tense was the situation that, for the first time, the canonical daily prayers were neglected by the Muslim community. Only at night, when the attacks stopped due to darkness, could they resume their regular worship. According to Ibn Ishaq, the situation became serious and fear was everywhere.|$|E
5|$|According to Callisthenes, the Persians {{were using}} water clocks in 328 {{to ensure a}} just and exact {{distribution}} of water from qanats to their shareholders for agricultural irrigation. The use of water clocks in Iran, especially in Zeebad, dates back to 500. Later they were also {{used to determine the}} exact holy days of pre-Islamic religions, such as the Nowruz, Chelah, or Yaldā – the shortest, longest, and equal-length days <b>and</b> <b>nights</b> of the years. The water clocks used in Iran were one of the most practical ancient tools for timing the yearly calendar.|$|E
5|$|After {{three days}} <b>and</b> <b>nights</b> of this battle, C Company of the 35th Infantry and A Company of the 29th Infantry moved up astride the Komam-ni road {{during the morning}} of August 20 to bolster A and B Companies on Sibidang. A large {{concentration}} of North Koreans advanced to renew the attack. The US troops directed artillery fire on this force and called in an air strike. Observers estimated that the artillery fire and the air strike killed about 350 North Korean troops, half the attack group.|$|E

5|$|In June 2016 it was {{revealed}} that a five-man New IRA hit team were in Dublin's north inner city looking to murder two leading gangsters after one of their associates was shot dead in a gangland feud. Sources said the murder squad from the North spent several days <b>and</b> <b>nights</b> looking for their targets in the streets. In September 2016 a close associate of Alan Ryan, who had been arrested and imprisoned following the Stamullen raid, was sentenced to nine years' imprisonment in Belfast for possession of a sub-machine gun and ammunition, after getting off a bus from Dublin.|$|E
5|$|Ninety-seven British {{prisoners were}} killed and the Germans forced French civilians to bury the bodies in a shallow mass grave the next day. Despite the German efforts, Private William O'Callaghan had survived and pulled Private Albert Pooley alive from among the bodies in the field. The pair then hid in a pig-sty for three days <b>and</b> <b>nights,</b> {{surviving}} on raw potatoes and water from puddles before being discovered by the farm's owner, Madame Duquenne-Creton, and her son Victor. The French civilians risked their lives caring for the two men, who were later captured by the Wehrmacht's 251st Infantry Division and transferred to a military hospital.|$|E
5|$|Route 41 {{was chosen}} {{as one of the}} initial routes to be routed through the Metro Bus Tunnel in Downtown Seattle, but due to a delay in the {{production}} of special dual-mode buses for the tunnel, route 41 was not moved into the tunnel until 1991. Route 41 ran primarily during peak hours, with some limited midday service, and was supplemented by route 307, which ran from Downtown Seattle to Northgate and Bothell on weekends <b>and</b> <b>nights.</b> The northern terminus of route 41 was moved from Magnuson Park to 5th Avenue NE and NE 125th Street in 1997, eliminating service to Sand Point and Lake City.|$|E

5|$|The Celebration was {{conceived}} by Henry Davis, a horse trainer {{who along with}} several other horsemen, felt the Shelbyville area should have a festival or annual event. Although the Celebration was originally held in Wartrace, Tennessee, it moved to Shelbyville, the seat of Bedford County, a few years later. The Celebration spans 11 days <b>and</b> <b>nights</b> in late August and early September annually, and finishes with the crowning of the World Grand Champion Tennessee Walker on the Saturday night before Labor Day. The TWHNC draws an estimated 2,000 horses and 250,000 spectators to Shelbyville each year.|$|E
5|$|Murli Prasad Sharma alias Munna Bhai (Sanjay Dutt), {{a gangster}} {{who is in}} love with the voice of Janhavi (Vidya Balan), a radio jockey, devises a plan to meet her when she announces a quiz contest {{featuring}} the life and beliefs of Mahatma Gandhi, to be aired on 2 October, the birthday of Gandhi. To prepare for the contest, Munna's sidekick Circuit (Arshad Warsi) kidnaps and bribes a group of professors to provide the answers for Munna. After winning the contest, Munna is granted an interview with Janhavi wherein he presents himself as a professor of history and a Gandhi specialist. Janhavi subsequently asks Munna to present a lecture on Gandhi to a community of senior citizens who live in her home, called the 'Second Innings House.' To prepare for this event, Munna engages in intense study at a Gandhi institute. For three days <b>and</b> <b>nights</b> (and without food or sleep), Munna reads about the life and ideologies of Gandhi.|$|E
5|$|The Alamanni high kings now {{ordered a}} mass {{mobilisation}} {{of all the}} confederation's member tribes, gathering their bands at Strasbourg. In addition, they received the timely support of the Alamanni cantons near Raetia that had been pacified by Constantius in 355. Their leaders were overthrown in an anti-Roman coup by their optimates. Gundomad was slain and Wadomar forced at sword-point to break his treaty and lead his warriors to join Chnodomar. Finally, they summoned the assistance of certain non-Alamanni tribes (probably Burgundians), partly for services rendered in the past, partly for payment. At Strasbourg on the Rhine (about 32km SE of Saverne), they gathered a combined force of some 35,000 men, according to Ammianus. This figure may be an exaggeration, but the exceptional size of the levy is shown {{by the presence of}} all the Alamanni kings and the report that German bands were crossing the Rhine to Strasbourg continuously for three days <b>and</b> <b>nights.</b> Their aim was to bring Julian to battle and crush him by sheer weight of numbers. They provoked Julian by sending him an ultimatum to evacuate Alsace immediately.|$|E
50|$|A day <b>and</b> <b>night</b> {{camera is}} a {{security}} camera that {{can see the}} picture during the day hours, when there is enough sunlight, <b>and</b> during the <b>night</b> in total darkness or minimum illumination. A day <b>and</b> <b>night</b> camera has special lenses that allow infrared emission produced by infrared LEDs and reflected from objects to go through and reach a CCD or CMOS chip inside the camera. As a result, the end user can see picture in total darkness at the distance of infrared emission produced by LEDs. A day <b>and</b> <b>night</b> camera can have infrared LEDs mounted on its housing or can accept the emission, produced by an infrared turret. Day <b>and</b> <b>night</b> cameras often have modifications in their digital signal processor (DSP) that compensates for the difference in illumination between day <b>and</b> <b>night</b> modes. HDR technology may also be used in more expensive models {{to compensate for the}} difference in illumination between shaded and lighted areas of surveillance.|$|R
50|$|The 24hr races {{demonstrate}} the new dynamic day <b>and</b> <b>night</b> cycles. The transition between day <b>and</b> <b>night</b> is seamless <b>and</b> steady, {{unlike in the}} original where the race had to be paused whilst the new time of day was loaded. The day <b>and</b> <b>night</b> cycles can also be experienced by changing the speed of which {{the time of day}} passes during a race weekend. Selections here can be accelerated up to 60x.|$|R

5|$|Theoretical models {{predict that}} {{volatile}} compounds {{such as water}} and carbon dioxide, if present, might evaporate in the scorching heat of the sunward side, migrate to the cooler night side, and condense to form ice caps. Over time, the entire atmosphere might freeze into ice caps on the night side of the planet. However, it remains unknown if water and/or carbon dioxide are even present {{on the surface of}} Gliese 581c. Alternatively, an atmosphere large enough to be stable would circulate the heat more evenly, allowing for a wider habitable area on the surface. For example, although Venus has a small axial inclination, very little sunlight reaches the surface at the poles. A slow rotation rate approximately 117 times slower than Earth's produces prolonged days <b>and</b> <b>nights.</b> Despite the uneven distribution of sunlight cast on Venus at any given time, polar areas and the night side of Venus are kept almost as hot as on the day side by globally circulating winds.|$|E
5|$|Water clocks, or Fenjaan, in Persia {{reached a}} level of {{accuracy}} comparable to today's standards of timekeeping. The fenjaan was the most accurate and commonly used timekeeping device for calculating the amount or the time that a farmer must take water from a qanat or well for irrigation of the farms, until it was replaced by more accurate current clock. Persian water clocks were a practical and useful tool for the qanat's shareholders to calculate {{the length of time}} they could divert water to their farm. The qanat was the only water source for agriculture and irrigation so a just and fair water distribution was very important. Therefore, a very fair and clever old person was elected to be the manager of the water clock, and at least two full-time managers were needed to control and observe the number of fenjaans and announce the exact time during the days <b>and</b> <b>nights.</b>|$|E
5|$|William Taylor and Helen Cartwright are two {{children}} {{who live in}} the city of Bellbridge (a fictionalised version of London). Will is an aspiring football player, Helen a prodigy violinist. Over the years, both have grown apart from their respective parents; Helen has chosen to spend more time practising the violin with her friends rather than with her mother, a choice which has begun to fill her with guilt, while Will's father is transferred to another city for work and leaves his son by himself. Both children suffer nightmares and come under attack by the Nightmaren, who chase them into the world of Nightopia. There, the {{two children}} meet and free Nights, who has the ability to merge with the children, allowing them to share Nights' body and fly through the skies. Learning that Wizeman is plotting to take over the dream world and consequently enter the real world, the children <b>and</b> <b>Nights</b> resolve to stop Wizeman, but face resistance from the Nightmaren he commands, particularly Nights' sibling, Reala.|$|E
