40|$|We {{present a}} {{literature}} {{review of the}} {{diagnosis and treatment of}} <b>acquired</b> <b>lumbar</b> spinal <b>stenosis</b> (LS), with a brief description of new surgical techniques. LS is {{the most common cause of}} spinal surgery in individuals older than 65 years of age. Neurogenic claudication and radiculopathy result from compression of the cauda equina and lumbosacral nerve roots by degenerated spinal elements. Surgical decompression is a well established treatment for patients with refractory, or moderate to severe clinical symptoms. However, the variety of surgical options is vast. New techniques have been developed with the goal of increasing long term functional outcomes. In this article we review lumbar decompression and fusion as treatment options for LS but also present other recent developments. Prospective long term studies are necessary to know which procedures would result in optimal patient outcome...|$|R
30|$|Since PDPH {{is thought}} to be caused by {{continuous}} CSF leakage [7], the failure to obtain CSF in this case may have occurred despite successful dural puncture, rather than technical reasons. The failure of CSF flow before spinal drug administration (often known as a dry tap), is usually caused by a needle blockage, a needle in the wrong space, previous spinal surgery, or low CSF pressures [8, 9]. It can also be secondary to congenital or <b>acquired</b> <b>lumbar</b> canal <b>stenosis,</b> as well as adhesive arachnoiditis [10]. SEL is a pathological condition in which fat tissue is deposited in the spinal canal around the thecal sac [1 – 3]. This excessive deposition in the epidural space may obliterate the spinal subarachnoid space, which could lead to low CSF pressure and in this instance would explain the dry tap.|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} case of a 74 -year-old woman who {{presented}} with acute-onset right groin pain irradiating to the thigh anteriorly after having suffered for a few weeks from slight knee pain. As a CT scan showed multiple herniated intervertebral discs and spinal stenosis at the L 3 -L 4 level, she was referred to a neurosurgical unit with the tentative diagnosis of L 2 -L 3 radicular pain. Investigations (MR, myelography with CT scan) showed severe <b>acquired</b> <b>lumbar</b> canal <b>stenosis.</b> Decompression surgery was finally postponed because of the patient's serious cardiac medical history and she was referred to us for conservative treatment. She was found to have iliopsoas bursitis with chondrocalcinosis of the knee. Local steroid injections of the two sites abolished her symptoms. We draw attention to the possible pitfalls that the radiographic appearance and one of the multiple clinical presentations of this unrare pathology may represent. Whenever a patient comes walking with crutches, avoids putting weight on his or her leg, and radicular pain is suspected, we advise consideration of other extra-spinal causes for the pain...|$|R
40|$|Background: Degenerative <b>lumbar</b> canal <b>stenosis</b> is a {{multifaceted}} problem presenting as backache and neurological claudication. Methods: In fifteen patients of <b>acquired</b> degenerative <b>lumbar</b> canal <b>stenosis</b> multi level interlaminar fenestration with discectomy, if required, was carried out. Retrospective analysis {{was done to}} assess the out come by assessing the relief in backache and neurological claudication. Results: The mean age of patients was 50. 4 years and average duration of neurological claudication was nine months. Diagnosis of the degenerative <b>lumbar</b> canal <b>stenosis</b> was made by clinical examination and confirmed by radiological and MRI measurement of cross section area of neural canal. Interlaminar fenestration was done at four levels and three levels in six patients each while it was done at two levels in remaining three patients. None of the patients reported immediate or late onset of backache or restriction of spinal movements, indicating spinal in stability. None of the patients had neurological claudication in the postoperative period. Conclusion: Retrospective analysis suggests that multiple interlaminar fenestrations done in moderate spinal stenosis provides adequate neurological decompression besides maintaining spinal stability...|$|R
40|$|<b>Lumbar</b> <b>stenosis</b> is a {{well-defined}} pathologic condition with excellent surgical outcomes. Empiric evidence {{as well as}} randomized, prospective trials has demonstrated the superior efficacy of surgery compared to medical management for <b>lumbar</b> <b>stenosis.</b> Traditionally, <b>lumbar</b> <b>stenosis</b> is decompressed with open laminectomies. This involves removal of the spinous process, lamina, and the posterior musculoligamentous complex (posterior tension band). This approach provides excellent improvement in symptoms, but is also associated with potential postoperative spinal instability. This may result in subsequent need for spinal fusion. Advances in technology have enabled the application of minimally invasive spine surgery (MISS) as an acceptable alternative to open lumbar decompression. Recent studies have shown similar to improved perioperative outcomes when comparing MISS to open decompression for <b>lumbar</b> <b>stenosis.</b> A literature review of MISS for decompression of <b>lumbar</b> <b>stenosis</b> with tubular retractors was performed to evaluate the outcomes of this modern surgical technique.

50|$|There {{are several}} types of spinal <b>stenosis,</b> with <b>lumbar</b> <b>stenosis</b> and {{cervical}} stenosis being the most frequent.

50|$|Among {{people with}} lower {{extremity}} pain {{in combination with}} back pain, <b>lumbar</b> <b>stenosis</b> as the cause is two times more likely in those older than 70 years of age while those younger than 60 years it is 0.40 as likely. The character of the pain is also useful. When the discomfort does not occur while seated, the likelihood of LSS increases considerably around 7.4 times. Other features increasing the likelihood of <b>lumbar</b> <b>stenosis</b> are improvement in symptoms on bending forward 6.4 times, pain that occurs in both buttocks or legs 6.3 times, {{and the presence of}} neurogenic claudication 3.7 times. Alternately, the absence of neurogenic claudication makes <b>lumbar</b> <b>stenosis</b> much less likely as the explanation for the pain.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Degenerative <b>lumbar</b> <b>stenosis</b> is {{a common}} source of pain and {{disability}} in the elderly.

5000|$|A {{laminotomy}} {{is typically}} used to relieve {{pressure from the}} spinal canal. Excessive pressure in the spinal canal causes the spinal canal and spinal nerves to be compressed which can be very painful and can impair motor control and/or sensation. A common disorder that causes increased pressure in the spinal canal is <b>lumbar</b> spinal <b>stenosis.</b> <b>Lumbar</b> spinal <b>stenosis</b> is formally defined as a decline in diameter length of either the neural foramina, lateral recess, or spinal canal. Stenosis is classified as a decaying disease because it causes the canal to gradually {{become more and more}} narrow which can cause pain or loss of function. Common symptoms of <b>lumbar</b> <b>stenosis</b> are pain, fatigue, weakness of the muscle and numbness. Stenosis can be caused by old age or an injury to the vertebral column and usually requires a CT scan or MRI to diagnose.

40|$|Introduction: Degenerative <b>lumbar</b> <b>stenosis</b> {{is common}} in adults and is {{frequently}} managed by surgical intervention after non-operative measures fail to relieve pain. Limited evidence-based information regarding optimal selection of patients for surgery exists. Current reform in healthcare policy has sparked significant interest in comparative effectiveness research {{with the goal of}} optimizing treatment strategies for common conditions such as degenerative <b>lumbar</b> <b>stenosis.</b> The {{purpose of this study is}} to quantify the effectiveness of surgical treatment of <b>lumbar</b> <b>stenosis</b> and to identify patient predictors of greatest improvement using patient reported measures of pain, physical function and quality of life. Methods: A retrospective study evaluated 229 adult patients who underwent decompression with or without posterior lumbar fusion for treatment of <b>lumbar</b> <b>stenosis</b> over a two year time period. Patient reported outcomes were measured using the SF 36 health survey. 146 patients had 6 month follow-up and 106 patients had one year follow-up. Variations in scores of the SF 36 pain, mental component summary (MCS), and physical component summary (PCS) subscales were analyzed by multivariate linear regression analysis. Results: At 6 - 12 months post-surgery, patients reported an improvement of 8 points in average pain (32. 3 to 40. 4), physical function (28. 6 to 36. 9), and PCS (29. 0 to 36. 9) subscales of the SF 36. There was a 6 point average improvement in MCS scores (41. 8 to 48. 10). Greater post-operative pain was significantly associated with smoking (p In regards to improvements in quality of life, older age (p Conclusion: In general, surgical treatment for <b>lumbar</b> <b>stenosis</b> improves patient pain, quality of life, and physical function as indicated by substantial improvement in all subscales of the SF 36 health survey. Predictive factors associated with poor pain relief after surgery include smoking, diabetes, the presence of instrumentation, and re-operation within a 12 month time period. Higher MCS scores are seen in older patients and those with an increase in physical function post-operatively. Predictive factors for poor MCS scores include revision surgery and mental health diagnosis. No specific predictors of PCS score were identified, most likely due to the complicated nature of the patient population with <b>lumbar</b> spinal <b>stenosis.</b> Further work is necessary to determine the ideal surgical candidate...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the efficacy and safety of unilateral laminotomy for decompression of <b>lumbar</b> <b>stenosis</b> (LS). Although minimally invasive procedures are gaining increasing popularity in the treatment of spinal disorders, minimally invasive techniques are not standard in the surgical treatment of <b>lumbar</b> <b>stenosis</b> yet. Methods: Fifty-two consecutive patients with <b>lumbar</b> <b>stenosis</b> were randomized to two treatment groups (unilateral laminotomy for decompression-Group 1, decompressive laminectomy-Group 2). Maximum walking distance (MWD), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), spinal MRI and CT, and flexion-extension radiography were used to assess clinical outcome, adequacy of decompression and postoperative instability. Results: Excellent-good clinical outcome was obtained in 88 % of patients in Group 1 and in 69 % of patients in Group 2. Increase in MWD and dural sac area after surgery were adequate in both groups. Postoperative spinal instability occurred in five patients in Group 2, none in Group 1. There was no surgical complication in the groups. Conclusions: Unilateral laminotomy for decompression is an effective and safe technique for treatment of LS. This technique ensures adequate decompression and good clinical outcome.

Materials and Methods: In our study, TGF-βl concentrations in the ligamentum flavum samples taken from patients with lumbar disk hernia and <b>lumbar</b> spinal <b>stenosis</b> during surgical intervention. In addition, thickness of ligamentum flavum in these patients was calculated by averaging the lumbar MRI-tissue thickness, and all these results were statistically compared among the patients. Results: Ligamentum flavum thickness values in two groups were 3. 46 ± 1 mm in lumbar disk hernia and 5. 63 ± 1. 35 mm in <b>lumbar</b> spinal <b>stenosis</b> and the differences were statistically significant (p= 0. 000).
