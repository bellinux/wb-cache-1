25|$|Although Kant never {{explicitly}} states {{what the}} first proposition is, {{it is clear that}} its content is suggested by the following common-sense observation. Common sense distinguishes among: (a) the case in which a person clearly acts contrary to duty; (b) the case in which a person’s actions coincide with duty, but are not motivated by duty; and (c) the case in which a person's actions coincide with duty because she is motivated by duty. Kant illustrates the distinction between (b) and (c) with the example of a shopkeeper (4:397) who chooses not to overcharge an inexperienced customer in order to preserve his business’s reputation. Because it is not motivated by duty, the shopkeeper's action has no moral worth. Kant contrasts the shopkeeper with the case of a person who, faced with “adversity and hopeless grief” (4:398) obeys his duty to preserve his life. Because this person acts from duty, his actions have moral worth. Kant thinks our actions only have moral worth <b>and</b> <b>deserve</b> esteem when they are motivated by duty.|$|E

This is abrogated for patronal festivals (that is, the day commemorating the saint or event for which a congregation is named) provided that they do not take place in Lent, Advent, or Easter, in which case they must also be transferred to the next convenient weekday.

According to the newspaper, the bridge was scheduled to be completed by July 1875. During the course of construction, John Ridenour lost a finger while working on the bridge. The new South Branch Bridge was completed well ahead of schedule in October 1874. The October 12, 1874, edition of the South Branch Intelligencer characterized the new bridge as a [...] "complete, handsome and durable structure", and further recounted that [...] "the contractors, Messrs.

An unknown poet kept the first, third and sixth stanza as {{movements}} 1, 4 and 7 of the cantata. He derived movements 2 and 3, aria and recitative, from stanza 2, movement 5, another aria, from stanza 4, and the last recitative from stanza 5.

Commodore John Collins, who during the battle led a Royal Australian Navy task force that included the cruisers HMAS Australia and HMAS Shropshire, also paid tribute: [...] "The accuracy of these bombardments was ensured by excellent air spotting. Beauforts of 71Wing RAAF gave this spotting <b>and</b> <b>deserve</b> much credit for the efficient manner in which it was undertaken, particularly since the airmen were not trained spotters and a Beaufort is hardly a suitable plane for the work." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1598, Francis Meres, in his Palladis Tamia, {{included}} Peake {{on a list}} of {{the best}} English artists. In 1612, Henry Peacham wrote in The Gentleman's Exercise that his [...] "good friend Mr Peake", along with Marcus Gheeraerts, was outstanding [...] "for oil colours". Ellis Waterhouse suggested that the genre of elaborate costume pieces was as much a decorative as a plastic art. He notes that these works, the [...] "enamelled brilliance" [...] of which has become apparent through cleaning, are unique in European art <b>and</b> <b>deserve</b> respect. They were produced chiefly by the workshops of Peake, Gheeraerts the Younger, and De Critz. Sheeran detects the influence of Hilliard’s brightly patterned and coloured miniatures in Peake’s work and places Peake firmly in the [...] "iconic tradition of late Elizabethan painting". He employed techniques from European Mannerism and followed the artificial and decorative style characteristic of Elizabethan painting. By the time he was appointed serjeant-painter in 1607, his compelling and semi-naive style was somewhat old fashioned compared with De Critz and other contemporaries. However, Peake's portraits of Prince Henry are the first to show his subject in ‘action’ poses.|$|E
500|$|Along with Arab nationalism, anti-imperialism {{was also}} a {{defining}} feature of Gaddafi's regime during its early years. He believed in opposing Western imperialism and colonialism in the Arab world, including any Western expansionism through the form of Israel. For many years, anti-Zionism was a fundamental component of Gaddafi's ideology. He believed that the state of Israel should not exist, and that any Arab compromise with the Israeli government was a betrayal of the Arab people. In large part due to their support of Israel, Gaddafi despised the United States, considering the country to be imperialist and lambasting it as [...] "the embodiment of evil." [...] He rallied against Jews in many of his speeches, with Blundy and Lycett claiming that his anti-Semitism was [...] "almost Hitlerian". His views later shifted; in 2009, he stated that [...] "the Jews have been held captive, massacred, disadvantaged in every possible fashion... want <b>and</b> <b>deserve</b> their homeland." [...] He called for both Jews and Palestinians to [...] "move beyond old conflicts and look to a unified future based on shared culture and respect", forging a single-state that he termed [...] "Isratin".|$|E
500|$|Jones' murder made {{headline}} news across Jamaica. Jamaica's Justice Minister, Senator Mark Golding, condemned the killing {{and called for}} an end to [...] "depraved acts of violence" [...] in Jamaica. He added that [...] "all well-thinking Jamaicans" [...] should embrace [...] "the principle of respect for the basic human rights of all persons" [...] and express tolerance towards minority groups such as the LGBT community. Annie Paul, the publications officer of the Jamaican campus of the University of the West Indies (UWI), stated that on the basis of comments provided on social media, she thought that most Jamaicans believed that Jones provoked his own murder by cross-dressing within a society that did not tolerate such behaviour. NewtonD. Duncan, the UWI Professor of Paediatric Surgery, similarly noted that the [...] "overwhelming majority" [...] of Jamaicans believed that cross-dressers are homosexuals <b>and</b> <b>deserve</b> punishment. He added that this was a common misconception, because the majority of cross-dressers were heterosexual. He condemned the attack and compared it to the lynching of an African-American man in Harper Lee's novel To Kill a Mockingbird, drawing links between the anti-LGBT violence of Jamaica and the anti-black violence of the mid-20th century United States.|$|E

Mike Diver of BBC Online called it [...] "the definitive Britney album" [...] {{and added that}} [...] "these songs don't just make a mark, lingering in the memory– they are essential pieces of {{the past ten years}} of pop history, <b>and</b> <b>deserve</b> better than dismissal by so-called discerning listeners". Evan Sawdey of PopMatters called the album [...] "a high-gloss collection of tunes that selectively sums up the career of one of the biggest female pop singers of the past decade. It's a disc that's light on filler [...] and heavy on Spears' more high-energy cuts, which, without question, play to her strengths as a performer". Sputnikmusic stated [...] "This is Britney's second greatest hits, and it's incredibly strong. It focuses mainly on her more upbeat, danceable numbers, with a few slower ones thrown in to change things up without disrupting the constant stream of quality pop songs" [...] and summarized the review adding [...] "As {{one of the most successful}} artists of the decade, is it any wonder this compilation is so good?".|$|E
500|$|His other revolutionary {{activity}} {{at the time was}} {{as a member of the}} Fincastle County Committee of Safety, an outgrowth of the Virginia Committee of Correspondence. The Virginia Committee of Correspondence was formed on March 12, 1773, and requested each county to do the same. The British refused to address the issues that were of greatest concern to the colonists, and so the freeholders of Fincastle County met at the Lead Mines on January 20, 1775, forming a Committee of Safety in which Trigg was a member. They were one of the first to respond to the request of the Virginia Committee of Correspondence to form such a body. Committees of Safety basically served as provisional governments for their area. It was also at this meeting that they drew up the Fincastle Resolutions, which was a precursor to the Declaration of Independence issued by the Second Continental Congress on July 4, 1776; Trigg was one of the signatories. The resolutions, addressed to the Virginia members of the Continental Congress, contained the boldest assertion of the grievances and rights of the American colonies. In February 1775, he wrote to his brother-in-law William Christian, suggesting they call another meeting of the freeholders to elect their delegates to the second Virginia Convention. With the news that William Christian was leaving with the Fincastle militia company to Williamsburg to fight, Trigg took over as chairman of the Committee of Safety. On October 7, 1775, they met to express their appreciation of Trigg, writing that [...] "together with the most exemplary zeal and attachment to the liberties of your country, and your indefatigable industry in the service thereof, you merit <b>and</b> <b>deserve</b> our particular thanks." ...|$|E
500|$|At a Senate {{hearing on}} September 9, 2014, Acting VA Inspector General Richard J.

Griffin also reported that [...] "Since July 2005, OIG published 20 oversight reports on VA patient wait times and access to care yet VHA did not effectively address its access to care issues or stop the use of inappropriate scheduling procedures. When VHA concurred with our recommendations and submitted an action plan, VA medical facility directors {{did not take the}} necessary actions to comply with VHA’s program directives and policy changes." [...] In his spoken testimony, Griffin said that in [...] "three-fourths (of the VA facilities investigated for falsification of wait time data), we're pretty confident that it was knowingly and willingly happening, and we're pursuing those." [...] He also said he hopes to complete his office's investigations into possible criminal misconduct by the end of 2014. If his office finds criminal misconduct, it will then refer cases to U.S. attorneys for possible prosecution. Senator Richard Burr said that the [...] "culture that has developed at VA and the lack of management and accountability is simply reprehensible." [...] In his testimony, Secretary Bob McDonald apologized [...] "to all Veterans who experienced unacceptable delays in receiving care at the Phoenix facility, and across the country. We at VA are committed to fixing the problems and consistently providing the high quality care our Veterans have earned <b>and</b> <b>deserve</b> in order to improve their health and well-being." [...] He discussed actions taken at the Phoenix VA facility in response to Inspector General findings, and he discussed national initiatives to change VA's culture, measure patient satisfaction, improve access to care, and improve accountability (including a restructuring of the Office of Medical Inspector).|$|E
