And Yet It Moves was originally designed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> science project at the Vienna University of Technology in 2007.

5|$|Carpenter is from Northampton, Massachusetts. His father, Tom, worked <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> program {{analyst for}} the Department of Veterans Affairs, while his mother, Gail, served as an {{administrative}} assistant for the Massachusetts Audubon Society. In 1986, he enrolled at Rutgers University and graduated in 1990 {{with a degree in}} economics. In January 1991, he joined the Internal Revenue Service after completing government exams and tests. In November 1996, Carpenter met his future wife, Deborah, who was studying for a master's degree at Southern Connecticut State University and worked as a manager of a Fleet Bank branch in New Haven. They married in August 1998. At the time of his appearance on Millionaire, he was 31years old. When he revealed his profession as an IRS officer on Millionaire, Carpenter was playfully booed by the audience.|$|E
5|$|Hamurabi is a text-based {{strategy}} {{video game}} {{of land and}} resource management first developed by Doug Dyment in 1968. It was developed by Dyment at Digital Equipment Corporation as The Sumer Game before {{the rise of the}} commercial video game industry in the early history of video games <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> game for fellow employee Richard Merrill's newly invented FOCAL programming language. The game consists of ten rounds wherein the player, as the ancient Babylonian king Hammurabi, manages how much of their grain to spend on crops for the next round, feeding their people, and purchasing additional land, while dealing with random variations in crop yields and plagues. The Sumer Game was possibly inspired by the 1966 The Sumerian Game, a much more in-depth text-based economic simulation intended for children.|$|E

5|$|Hamurabi in {{particular}} is mostly known for its appearance in Ahl's book. The original game, a text-based strategy video game of land and resource management, was developed by Doug Dyment at DEC in 1968 as The Sumer Game. Dyment created it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> game for fellow employee Richard Merrill's newly invented FOCAL programming language. The game consists of ten rounds wherein the player, as the ancient Babylonian king Hammurabi, manages how much of their grain to spend on crops for the next round, feeding their people, and purchasing additional land, while dealing with random variations in crop yields and plagues. Multiple versions of the game were created for the FOCAL and FOCAL-69 languages, but an expanded, uncredited version of the game was included in 101 BASIC Computer Games as Hamurabi, and later versions of the game, even in FOCAL, referenced the new title over the old. Hamurabi influenced many later strategy and simulation games and is an antecedent to the city-building genre.|$|E
