500|$|Affleck {{appeared}} {{at a press}} conference with New York Senator Chuck Schumer in 2002, in support of a proposed Anti-Nuclear Terrorism Prevention Act. In 2003, he criticised the [...] "questionable and aggressive" [...] use of the Patriot Act and the resulting [...] "encroachments on civil liberties". A reporter for The Washington Post overheard Affleck denouncing the Israeli invasion of Gaza at a Washington party in 2009. Steven Clemons, a participant in the conversation, said Affleck listened [...] "to alternative takes ... What Affleck spoke <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> was reasoned, complex and made a lot of sense." [...] Later that year, in a New York Times interview, Affleck remarked that his views were closer to those of the Israeli Labor Party than Likud.|$|E
2500|$|Near {{the end of}} the book, Melinda's ex-best friend Rachel, who {{was dating}} Andy, breaks up with him on prom night after Melinda confesses to her what happened. Realizing only one other person could've told Rachel, Andy attacks her in the {{abandoned}} janitor's closet, Melinda's [...] "sanctuary". Melinda fights back against Andy and is able to get help in time. When word spreads about what happened and the truth <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> is revealed, the students no longer treat Melinda as an outcast but as a sort of hero instead. And finally, Melinda tells her story to her art teacher, Mr. Freeman, and the truth finally sets her free.|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{believe a}} word he said, Josie. They was jus' words, an' it was nat'ral he'd lie <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>night's</b> work. When I went to bed it was near mornin', but Ol' Swallertail was still sett'n' by the fire.|$|R
5|$|At <b>about</b> 11.00pm <b>that</b> <b>night</b> William Wainewright {{sat down}} in Blackburne's study at Eccles vicarage to write a brief letter to the Mayor of Liverpool.|$|R
50|$|David is dreaming <b>about</b> the <b>night</b> <b>that</b> {{he murdered}} {{his wife and}} her lover, in which he grins an insane smile, one which resembles the monster Grice's. His cellmate Harry Rivers wakes him up and David tells him <b>about</b> <b>that</b> {{particular}} <b>night</b> <b>that</b> got him locked away in the first place. He {{says that when he}} was arrested he could not tell the police a thing.|$|R
6000|$|... "An’ {{what about}} Cap’in Flower?" [...] {{suggested}} Mr. Green; [...] "she’s evident {{the young lady}} he was talking <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> and Tommy’s heard ’em speaking about him once or twice, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't tell me," [...] she begged, [...] "that {{you have}} come to ask me any {{questions}} <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>night!</b> I simply could not bear it. The police have been here twice, and I had nothing to tell them, absolutely nothing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But we did {{not make}} a start at once. We must see the last of the ship. And so the boats drifted <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> heaving and setting on the swell. The men dozed, waked, sighed, groaned. I looked at the burning ship.|$|E
60|$|She reached Paddington <b>about</b> eight <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> {{and going}} to the {{refreshment}} room, dined on some tea and bread and butter. Then she washed her hands, brushed her hair, and started.|$|R
50|$|The {{temperature}} in the harbor was <b>about</b> 40 degrees <b>that</b> <b>night</b> with a sharp wind blowing across Governor's Island.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I cannot say {{it quite}} right,' {{answered}} the boy; 'I only know {{it says that}} the Angels in Heaven rejoice and are glad over one sinner that repenteth. I thought <b>about</b> it <b>that</b> <b>night</b> after I had been naughty.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Una, dearest," [...] Aunt Emma would say, in {{her quiet}} fashion, [...] "you mustn't talk <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>night.</b> I have Dr. Wade's strict orders that nothing {{must be said}} to you about it, and above all nothing that could in any way excite or arouse you." ...|$|E
60|$|I wandered <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> {{like a man}} who has {{discovered}} his Gods are dead. I can look back now detached yet sympathetic upon that wild confusion of moods and impulses, and by it I think I can understand, oh! half the wrongdoing and blundering in the world.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Harry, [...] "I'm open {{to make a}} {{guess at}} him. Just as the {{schooner}} went <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> I had {{a look at her}} helmsman. He had his back to me, but it was moonlight, and I could see that one shoulder hunched up in a kind of curious manner." ...|$|E
60|$|And indeed, as {{it turned}} out, <b>about</b> ten <b>that</b> <b>night</b> the Colonel's loud and stentorious {{breathing}} began to fail slowly. The intervals grew longer and longer between each recurrent gasp, and life died away at last in imperceptible struggles.|$|R
60|$|She {{was sitting}} {{brooding}} over her fire <b>about</b> ten o'clock <b>that</b> <b>night</b> when a sealed and registered envelope {{was brought up}} to her.|$|R
60|$|They said of him, <b>about</b> {{the city}} <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> <b>that</b> {{it was the}} peacefullest man's face ever beheld there. Many added that he looked sublime and prophetic.|$|R
60|$|Peter Rabbit sat {{tight in}} the dear Old Briar-patch. In fact Peter did no moving <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> but {{remained}} squatting {{just inside the}} entrance to an old hole Johnny Chuck's grandfather had dug long ago {{in the middle of}} the clear Old Briar-patch. Some time before morning the snow stopped falling and then rough Brother North Wind worked as hard to blow away the clouds as he had done to bring them.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{remember}} him perfectly," [...] Sir Timothy declared. [...] "I fancied, directly I entered, that your face was familiar," [...] he added, turning to Shopland. [...] "I am rather ashamed of myself <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>night.</b> My little outburst must have sounded almost ridiculous to you two. To {{tell you the}} truth, I quite failed {{at that time to}} give Mr. Ledsam credit for gifts which I have since discovered him to possess." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Guppy retreats {{behind a}} chair. [...] "Small {{told me of}} her. She went leaping and {{bounding}} and tearing <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> like a dragon, and got out on the house-top, and roamed about up there for a fortnight, and then came tumbling down the chimney very thin. Did you ever see such a brute? Looks as if she knew all about it, don't she? Almost looks {{as if she was}} Krook. Shoohoo! Get out, you goblin!" ...|$|E
50|$|At <b>about</b> 11.00 pm <b>that</b> <b>night</b> William Wainewright {{sat down}} in Blackburne's study at Eccles vicarage to write a brief letter to the Mayor of Liverpool.|$|R
50|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 6 November 1984, Maybury {{had been sent to}} a convenience store to buy a bag of sugar. She was last seen going home, carrying a bag of sugar, and looking as if she were lost. Her body was found in the gutter of a nearby street at <b>about</b> 00:45 <b>that</b> <b>night.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1918, a young Jiro Horikoshi {{longs to}} become a pilot, but his {{nearsightedness}} prevents it. He reads about the famous Italian aircraft designer Giovanni Battista Caproni, and dreams <b>about</b> him <b>that</b> <b>night.</b> In the dream, Caproni tells him {{that he has never}} flown a plane in his life, and that building planes is better than flying them.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not necessary," [...] she answered. [...] "I {{believe that}} what you have been told is true. I believe that Russia will not {{tolerate}} Ughtred of Tyrnaus. My friend," [...] she added, in a softer tone, [...] "why do you concern yourself in these things? Leave Domiloff alone, and, believe me, your warning to the King would be wasted. Stay here, and watch for the things which may happen. Do you remember what we talked <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> at the palace? The times are coming--wait, and your opportunity may also show itself. Who knows that your own future may not become linked with the future of Theos?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think," [...] he said, [...] "that it is {{the sense}} of {{personal}} contact {{in a case like this}} which stirs the blood. I have memories <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> Colonel, which I couldn't describe to you--or any one. And now this young brother coming on the scene seems to bring the dead man to life again. He's one of the worst type of young bounders I ever came into contact with. A creature without sentiment or feeling of any sort--nothing but an almost ravenous cupidity. He's wearing his brother's clothes now--thinks nothing of it! He hasn't a single regret. I haven't heard a single decent word pass his lips. But he wants the money. Nothing else! The money!" ...|$|E
60|$|Suddenly, {{a chance}} shot fired somewhere {{made all the}} ducks fly up. A head and {{shoulders}} that Brand took for his young lord's, appeared beyond the shadow, beside Fulk's; and, at the same moment, he saw the man whom he had been watching level his gun from behind, and fire. Then came the cry, and Brand running down in horror himself, was amazed to see this person doing the same, and when {{they came up with}} the group, he recognised Perrault; and found, at the same time, that Trevor was the sufferer, and that Lord Trevorsham was safe. He then would have thought it an accident, but for Perrault's own needless wonder, whence the shot came, and that same remark, that Billy Blake, the half-witted son of a farmer, was <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>night.</b>|$|E
50|$|Dreaming This song is <b>about</b> the <b>night</b> <b>that</b> the Patient kills his wife. He suffocates {{her while}} having a nightmare.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sold him, then. Tony hadn't got a {{shilling}} in {{the world}} and he would never take a halfpenny from me. He had to have money. He told me <b>about</b> it <b>that</b> <b>night</b> before you came. Miller gave him five thousand pounds for it--secret service money from one of the branches of his party. Now you know all about it." ...|$|R
60|$|There was no word <b>about</b> Frank <b>that</b> <b>night.</b> The {{next morning}} the doctor found Sir Louis very weak, and begging for stimulants. He was worse than weak; he {{was in such a}} state of wretched misery and mental prostration; so low in heart, in such {{collapse}} of energy and spirit, that Dr Thorne thought it prudent to remove his razors from his reach.|$|R
60|$|The recollections, too, {{with which}} they made merry over that long {{protracted}} tea! The glee with which the locksmith asked Joe if he remembered that stormy night at the Maypole when he first asked after Dolly--the laugh they all had, <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> when she was {{going out to the}} party in the sedan-chair--the unmerciful manner in which they rallied Mrs Varden about putting those flowers outside that very window--the difficulty Mrs Varden found in joining the laugh against herself, at first, and the extraordinary perception she had of the joke when she overcame it--the confidential statements of Joe concerning the precise day and hour when he was first conscious of being fond of Dolly, and Dolly's blushing admissions, half volunteered and half extorted, as to the time from which she dated the discovery that she 'didn't mind' Joe--here was an exhaustless fund of mirth and conversation.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{how often}} are you so, Barry?--isn't it so with you every night? That's another thing; for my sake, {{for your own}} sake--for God's sake, give up the dhrink. It's killing you from day to day, and hour to hour. I see it in your eyes, and smell it in your breath, and hear it in your voice; it's that that makes your heart so black:--it's that that gives you over, body and soul, to the devil. I would not have said a word <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> to hurt you now; and, dear Barry, I wouldn't have said such words as these to you at all, but that I shall never speak to you again. And oh! I pray that you'll {{remember}} them. You're idle now, always:--don't continue so; earn your money, {{and it will be}} a blessing to you and to others. But in idleness, and drunkenness, and wickedness, it will only lead you quicker to the devil." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "See," [...] he cried, {{pointing}} downwards, [...] "is it {{not well}} done? See! Let {{me tell you}} about it. Quick! quick! He came! It was twilight! He was at the cabinet there. I stole out of the darkness. I flung my arms around him. He struggled. Ah, how he struggled; but it was all no use. Ha! ha! ha! I was too strong for him. I held him tighter and tighter, till I nearly strangled him, and he gasped and gurgled and moaned. Oh! it was fine to see him. Then I found a cord in the drawer there and I bound him, and while I fastened the knots I laughed and I talked to him. I talked <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> in the storm when he threw his father"--he pointed a long, quivering finger at me--"threw him into the slate quarry, and about that day {{when he came to the}} Castle gate and brought me to the plantation, and suddenly caught me by the throat till he thought he had strangled me, and beat me on the head. Ah, how my head has burned ever since, ever since, ever since! Ah, Milly, come to me! Milly, I am on fire! My head is on fire! Ah, ah!" ...|$|E
50|$|A week later, Elise {{is out of}} danger, {{the virus}} having been flushed from her system by {{multiple}} blood transfusions. Karl comes to visit, and comforts her, informing her that Baturin is facing trial and the truth behind the plane crash will be suppressed. Despite this, Elise is awoken from a dream <b>about</b> Eryka <b>that</b> <b>night.</b> She subconsciously removes the bandage from her eye.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>about</b> {{eleven o'clock}} <b>that</b> <b>night</b> {{he came back}} and ordered a bed and told them to put the horses up--said he would collect the claim in the morning. This was in January, you understand--January, 1834--the 3d of January--Wednesday.|$|R
5000|$|Greggs calls Beadie to {{tell her}} <b>about</b> the raid <b>that</b> <b>night</b> to capture {{anything}} they can. McNulty types warrants as Sergei [...] "Serge" [...] Malatov and Eton clean house and wash a large heap of powdered drugs down a shower drain.|$|R
