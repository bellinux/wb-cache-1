Kerry arrived in Moscow facing a four event schedule: he was nominated in both backstroke events and the 4200m freestyle relay and the 4100m medley relay. With the Americans and many other western swimmers absent, Australian officials were confident that their three entrants in the 100m backstroke, Kerry, Tonelli and Glenn Patching, would <b>all</b> <b>make</b> the final and win medals. Kerry came third in both his heat and semi-final, clocking 58.08s and 58.07s respectively, missing out on the final by just 0.02s. He was the ninth fastest in the closely run semifinals, with the third fastest qualifier being only 0.18s faster. Patching missed the final after slipping on the starting wall in his race, while Tonelli went on to finish seventh.

25|$|The {{nineteen}} organ praeludia (or preludes) {{form the}} core of Buxtehude's work and are ultimately considered his most important contributions to the music literature of the seventeenth century. They are sectional compositions that alternate between free improvisation and strict counterpoint.

These preludes, together with pieces by Nicolaus Bruhns, represent the highest point {{in the evolution of}} the north German organ prelude, and the so-called stylus phantasticus.

The album, which {{made a point of}} eschewing any gangsterism (in response to questions about his musical integrity), was critically acclaimed and led to a major label contract with MCA Records.

25|$|MOZ (Monocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein), Ybf2/Sas3, Sas2 and Tip60 (Tat Interacting Protein) <b>all</b> <b>make</b> up MYST, another {{well known}} family that {{exhibits}} acetylating capabilities. This family includes Sas3, essential SAS-related acetyltransferase (Esa1), Sas2, Tip60, MOF, MOZ, MORF, and HBO1. The {{members of this}} family have multiple functions, not only with activating and silencing genes, but also affect development and have implications in human diseases. Sas2 and Sas3 are involved in transcription silencing, MOZ and TIF2 are involved {{with the formation of}} leukemic transclocation products while MOF is involved in dosage compensation in Drosophila. HAT domains for this family are approximately 250 residues which include cysteine-rich, zinc binding domains as well as N-terminal chromodomains. The MYST proteins Esa1, Sas2 and Sas3 are found in yeast, MOF is found in Drosophila while Tip60, MOZ, MORF, and HBO1 are found in humans. Tip60 has roles in the regulation of gene transcription, HBO has been found to impact the DNA replication process, MORF is able to acetylate free histones (especially H3 and H4) as well as nucleosomal histones.|$|E

25|$|Nakula and Sahadeva {{are said}} to be skilled swordsmen in Mahabharata. Sword-{{fighting}} is one of the common Indian fighting arts. Varieties include the curved single-edge sword, the straight double-edge sword, the two-handed longsword, the gauntlet-sword, and the urumi or flexible sword. Techniques differ from one state to another but <b>all</b> <b>make</b> extensive use of circular movements, often circling the weapon around the user's head. The flexible nature and light weight of Indian swords allows for speed but provides little defensive ability, so that the swordsman must instead rely on body maneuvers to dodge attacks. Entire systems exist focusing on drawing the sword out of the opponent's body. Stances and forms traditionally made up the early training before students progress to free sparring with sticks to simulate swords in an exercise called gatka, although this term is more often used in English when referring to the Panjabi-Sikh fighting style. A common way to practice precision-cutting is to slice cloves or lemons, eventually doing so while blindfolded. Pairing two swords of equal length, though considered impractical {{in some parts of the}} world, is common and was considered highly advantageous in South Asia.|$|E
