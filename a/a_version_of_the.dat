5|$|Although the {{properties}} of gravity at short distances should be somewhat independent {{of the value of}} the cosmological constant, it is desirable to have <b>a</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> AdS/CFT correspondence for positive cosmological constant. In 2001, Andrew Strominger introduced <b>a</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> duality called the dS/CFT correspondence. This duality involves a model of spacetime called de Sitter space with a positive cosmological constant. Such a duality is interesting from the point of view of cosmology since many cosmologists believe that the very early universe was close to being de Sitter space. Our universe may also resemble de Sitter space in the distant future.|$|E
