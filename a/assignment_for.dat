5|$|The last <b>assignment</b> <b>for</b> Armstrong in the Gemini {{program was}} as the back-up Command Pilot for Gemini 11, {{announced}} {{two days after}} the landing of Gemini 8. Having trained for two flights, Armstrong was quite knowledgeable about the systems and was more in a teaching role for the rookie backup Pilot, William Anders. The launch was on September 12, 1966, with Pete Conrad and Dick Gordon on board, who successfully completed the mission objectives, while Armstrong served as CAPCOM.|$|E
5|$|Altgens was on <b>assignment</b> <b>for</b> the AP when he {{captured}} two historic images on November 22, 1963. The second photograph, showing First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy {{toward the rear}} of the presidential limousine and Secret Service agent Clint Hill on its bumper, was reproduced on the front pages of newspapers around the world. Within days, Altgens' preceding photograph became controversial after people began to question whether accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald was visible in the main doorway of the Texas School Book Depository as the gunshots were fired at JFK.|$|E
5|$|French {{paleontologist}} Eric Buffetaut and a Thai colleague, Varavudh Suteethorn, {{described a}} partial {{upper and lower}} jaw from the Aptian-Albian Khok Kruat Formation of Thailand in 1992, giving it the name Psittacosaurus sattayaraki. In 2000, Sereno questioned the validity of this species, citing its eroded and fragmentary nature, and noted an absence of features characteristic of the genus Psittacosaurus. However, in 2002 the original authors published new images of the fossil which seem to show teeth in the lower jaw that exhibit the bulbous vertical ridge characteristic of psittacosaurs. Other authors have also defended its validity, while some continue to regard it as dubious. Sereno (2010) proposed that the best <b>assignment</b> <b>for</b> the type material may be Ceratopsia incertae sedis.|$|E

5|$|On 6 October 1939, Morshead was {{selected}} by Blamey to command the 18th Infantry Brigade in the new 6th Division. This brigade was composed of four battalions from the smaller states, {{and would have been}} a natural <b>assignment</b> <b>for</b> a regular officer had Prime Minister Robert Menzies not restricted commands to senior posts to Militia officers, few of whom had much experience of the Army outside their home states. Morshead met with Blamey on 13 October to select officers for the new brigade. Like the other brigadiers, he was given a regular officer as brigade major, in this case Major Ragnar Garrett.|$|E
5|$|The year 1955 saw further {{changes to}} the {{division}} and more changes of <b>assignment</b> <b>for</b> subordinate elements. On 1 January 1955, the 291st Regiment was again assigned to the 75th Infantry Division from the 95th and was subsequently inactivated on 31 January 1955. On 30 January, the 377th Regiment was reassigned to the 95th from the 75th and its headquarters moved from New Orleans to Tulsa, Oklahoma. The same date saw the relocation of the 379th Regimental headquarters from Hot Springs, Arkansas {{where it had been}} since 1947, to Little Rock, Arkansas.|$|E

Naomi invites Annie to her birthday party, and they decide to go shopping together. Harry and guidance counselor Kelly Taylor (Jennie Garth) and Mr.Matthews meet with Naomi's parents, who feel that Naomi {{should not have to}} hand in her assignments on time when she is planning her party. Before she leaves, Naomi's mother, Tracy (Christina Moore), reminds Harry that they dated in high school.

5|$|Born in Ayodhya {{and raised}} in Bangalore, Sharma had her first {{modelling}} <b>assignment</b> <b>for</b> the fashion designer Wendell Rodricks in 2007 and later moved to Mumbai to pursue a full-time career as a model. Following a successful audition at Yash Raj Films, she made her screen debut opposite Shah Rukh Khan in the blockbuster romance Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008), which earned a Filmfare Award for Best Actress nomination. Sharma rose to prominence with starring roles in Yash Raj Films' romances Band Baaja Baaraat (2010) and Jab Tak Hai Jaan (2012); the latter won her a Best Supporting Actress award at Filmfare. She had her biggest commercial successes with the roles of a television reporter in the religious satire PK (2014) and a wrestler in the sports drama Sultan (2016), both of which rank among the highest-grossing Indian films. Sharma received critical praise for her performances in the 2015 crime thriller NH10, which also marked her production debut, and the 2016 romantic drama Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, both of which earned her several awards and nominations.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his return}} from Korea, Bolt was {{assigned}} to the U.S. Navy Bureau of Aeronautics in Washington, D.C. as an aircraft design engineer. In this duty, he was detailed to The Pentagon and a board which reported on aircraft performance and tactics. A press conference was held in September 1953 to welcome him to the position, and during this he recounted stories from his service in Korea {{for the first time to}} local newspapers. Bolt's experiences in World War II and the Korean War were used to help shape air combat doctrine. He worked in this <b>assignment</b> <b>for</b> around a year, until 1954 when he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and moved to the Naval Pilot Test Center at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, in St. Mary's County, Maryland. During this time, he took evening classes at the University of Maryland, eventually earning a Bachelor of Science in Military History.|$|E

5|$|Hart's duties at Sling Camp {{ended in}} July, {{when he was}} {{recalled}} to France to take over command of the 3rd New Zealand (Rifle) Brigade. He led the brigade through the Hundred Days Offensive, which included an action during the Second Battle of Bapaume that impressed his commanding officer, Russell. During the battle, Hart's headquarters was again shelled with mustard gas. After his previous experience of being gassed, Hart found the shelling 'annoying'. The brigade also participated in the capture of Le Quesnoy in November 1918. This was a difficult <b>assignment</b> <b>for</b> the presence of civilians in the walled town meant that artillery could not support the attack. Instead a small party was able to scale the walls and put flight to the Germans defending that section. This allowed {{the remainder of the}} attacking force to enter the town, which quickly surrendered. A few days later, the mayor of Le Quesnoy presented Hart with the French flag that was raised over the town on the day it was captured from the Germans.|$|E
5|$|Jones had {{previously}} codirected AJ Goes to France, a 2006 live-action independent film that also has Thompson {{as the leading}} actor. It was produced as an <b>assignment</b> <b>for</b> Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota, where Jones majored in film. Jones had moved from his hometown of Fargo, North Dakota, to Minneapolis in 2005, after he graduated from Fargo South High School. For AJ's Infinite Summer, Jones was inspired by his hometown, {{as well as the}} comics he drew that featured AJ and his other friends, Danny Davy and Morgan. Additionally, the character of Peter is based on Greg Carlson, Jones' professor from Concordia and also a film director and a critic for the High Plains Reader. Secret Cities, a Fargo-based band in which Jones' friends play, provided the score for the pilot. Jones found it excellent that both his friends and his friend's band were allowed by the network to do work for the pilot.|$|E
5|$|On July 2, 2010 Minister of Environmental Protection Viktor Boiko (Bloc Lytvyn) was {{replaced}} by Mykola Zlochevskiy and Vice Prime Minister Volodymyr Seminozhenko was fired by the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian parliament) the same day. A draft resolution proposing the dismissal of Semynozhenko was submitted by lawmaker Olha Bodnar of Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko. On July 10, 2010 Minister of Extraordinary Situations Nestor Shufrych was dismissed by Verkhovna Rada. For his dismissal voted 256 deputies. However Viktor Yanukovych found a new <b>assignment</b> <b>for</b> Shufrych and appointed him as the assistant {{to the secretary of}} the Council for National Security. Shufrych's duties were temporary assigned to Volodymyr Antonets till Mikhail Bolotskikh was appointed acting minister on July 23, 2010. Soon after the motion to overturn the 2004 Constitutional amendments was filed on July 14 by the representatives of the Azarov Government, Vasyl Tsushko, previously as an unaffiliated member of the government, was elected the leader of the Socialist Party of Ukraine (extra parliamentarian party, non-coalition) on July 24, 2010.|$|E

5|$|The next <b>assignment</b> <b>for</b> 2e DB, and the {{one that}} it had been brought from Africa for, was the liberation of Paris. Allied troops {{initially}} avoided the historic city, moving around it to minimise the danger of destruction if the Germans sought to defend it. When Parisians rose against the Germans, de Gaulle and Leclerc persuaded General Dwight D. Eisenhower to help. Leclerc's men had to fight their way into Paris, and when they got there they found German infantry and tanks still holding parts of the city. The German commander, General der Infanterie Dietrich von Choltitz, was inclined to surrender, and did so to Leclerc and Henri Rol-Tanguy of the French Forces of the Interior at the Gare Montparnasse on 25 August 1944. Leclerc arranged for Ensign Philippe de Gaulle, who was serving in the RBFM, to be in attendance, but the elder de Gaulle was annoyed that Leclerc had allowed the communist Rol to co-sign the surrender. The next day de Gaulle held a triumphal parade, accompanied by senior military figures including Leclerc, Alphonse Juin, Marie-Pierre KÅ“nig and Georges Thierry d'Argenlieu.|$|E
5|$|Voss {{was one of}} {{the test}} pilots for the F.I triplane {{prototype}} which developed into the Fokker Dr.I. He was summoned to Schwerin, and on 5 July 1917 {{was one of the}} first pilots to test fly Fokker F.I s/n 103/17. Although the Fokker had some drawbacks, such as its low speed and slowness in a dive, Voss loved the new craft. It was easy to fly with light controls, could out-manoeuvre any previous aircraft, mounted twin machine guns, and had a rapid rate of climb. The same climbing ability that put it at 1,000 meters (3,000 feet) within three minutes of takeoff lent itself to the combat tactic of zooming upwards out of combat to gain the height advantage on opponents. Voss enthusiastically recommended the Fokker's adoption while never progressing to testing the Pfalz Dr.I. He left Schwerin with an <b>assignment</b> <b>for</b> command of another jasta.|$|E
5|$|Operation Desert Storm {{began on}} 17 January 1991, {{but for the}} first two weeks 3rd Battalion only {{conducted}} sporadic engagements with its Iraqi counterparts across the border. That all changed on 29 January, when several Iraqi divisions unexpectedly crossed the border and seized the Saudi town of Khafji, less than 15kilometers north of 3rd Battalion's position. During the attack the Executive Officer along with the Battalion Sergeant Major drove into the town on a rescue mission looking for two Army soldiers who had been captured. Although they were unable to find them, the Marines from 3rd Battalion did encounter an Iraqi patrol and exchanged rounds with them before escaping. While Saudi and Qatari units ultimately retook the town, 3rd Battalion played a vital role in both coordinating the attack and blocking further Iraqi advances southward. In addition, several heavy machine guns and forward air controllers from the battalion were shifted over to the Saudis and took place in the assault. From 19â€“21 February, 3rd Battalion moved from Al Mish'ab to the forward assembly areas that it would be using to launch its attack into Kuwait. It was also during this period that 3rd Battalion was given its <b>assignment</b> <b>for</b> the ground offensive. Lacking heavy armor or motorized transport, the battalion (along with 2/3) would infiltrate Iraqi positions along the Saudi border and provide flank security {{for the rest of the}} 1st Marine Division to make its assault into Kuwait. On the night of 22 February, 3rd Battalion crossed the border into Kuwait, infiltrating past Iraqi minefields, tank traps, and other obstacles. Like many American units, 3rd Battalion encountered no Iraqi resistance and the biggest threat to the Marines came from friendly fire. Throughout the ground war, the battalion advanced steadily northwards, encountering no resistance but taking plenty of prisoners. 3rd Battalion arrived outside the Kuwait International Airport around 27 February where a SCUD missile landed near the battalion's command post. Several months later, 3rd Battalion returned to Hawaii, having suffered no combat casualties.|$|E
