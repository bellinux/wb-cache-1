40|$|Abstract Introduction Capsule {{endoscopy}} has, {{over the}} last few years, become a first-line test to visualize the mucosa of the small intestine. This technique is generally considered safe and does not cause discomfort for patients. However, although patients may have difficulty in swallowing the capsule, bronchial aspiration of <b>a</b> <b>capsule</b> <b>endoscope</b> is a very rare complication. We report the case of an 82 -year-old man who experienced prolonged bronchial aspiration of <b>a</b> <b>capsule</b> <b>endoscope</b> without relevant symptoms, followed by a spontaneous return of the capsule to the gastrointestinal tract. Case presentation An 82 -year-old Caucasian man was referred to our unit from another local hospital to undergo capsule endoscopy. He swallowed the capsule without any apparent difficulties and did not show any overt symptoms. The following day, when we reviewed the capsule endoscopy images, we realized that the capsule was in the bronchial system and remained there {{for the duration of the}} study. An urgent X-ray of the chest confirmed the presence of the capsule in the left side of the bronchopulmonary tree. Two days later a repeat chest X-ray showed the capsule in the right bronchus. After two days the capsule was retrieved in the feces. Our patient remained asymptomatic during the entire admission period. Conclusions Aspiration of <b>a</b> <b>capsule</b> <b>endoscope</b> is a rare complication; to the best of our knowledge this is the first reported case in which <b>a</b> <b>capsule</b> <b>endoscope</b> remained for six days in the bronchial system of a patient without causing airway compromise or pneumonitis and spontaneously returned to the gastrointestinal tract. </p...|$|E

Therefore, an accurate path-loss model is required for the development of accurate localization algorithms. This paper presents an in-body path-loss model for the human abdomen region at 2. 4 GHz frequency. To develop the path-loss model, electromagnetic simulations using the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method were carried out on two different anatomical human models. A mathematical expression for the path-loss model was proposed based on analysis of the measured loss at different capsule locations inside the small intestine. The proposed path-loss model is a good approximation to model in-body RF propagation, since the real measurements are quite infeasible for the capsule endoscopy subject. 4 page(s...|$|E

Nev-ertheless, <b>a</b> wireless <b>capsule</b> <b>endoscope</b> with the narrowband imaging technology has not been presented in the market up to now. The narrowband image acquisition and power dissipation reduction are the main challenges of NBI <b>capsule</b> <b>endoscope.</b> In this paper, we present the first narrowband imaging capsule endo-scope that can assist clinical doctors to effectively diagnose early gastrointestinal cancers, profited from our dedicated dual-mode complementary metal–oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensor. The dedicated dual-mode CMOS sensor can offer white-light and nar-rowband images. Implementation results show that the proposed 512 512 CMOS sensor consumes only 2 mA at a 3 -V power supply. The average current of the NBI <b>capsule</b> with <b>an</b> 8 -Mb/s RF transmitter is nearly 7 8 mA that can continuously work for 6 8 h with two 1. 5 -V 80 -mAh button batteries while the frame rate is 2 fps.

40|$|Sensitivity {{analysis}} {{plays an}} important role in a variety of statistical methodologies, design procedures and model selection. For development of in-body wireless communications, it is essential to evaluate the designed system performance prior to conducting any practical procedures. Localization of <b>a</b> <b>capsule</b> <b>endoscope</b> inside the gastrointestinal tract is one of the areas that needs to be precisely addressed in wireless body area networks. A highly accurate location estimation of <b>a</b> <b>capsule</b> <b>endoscope</b> in the range of several millimeters is a challenging task.

40|$|The {{state-of-the-art}} in enteroscopic {{surgery and}} therapeutic care continues to minimize invasiveness, cost, surgery time, and patient trauma. To this end, {{a new class}} of medical device, called the robotic <b>capsule</b> <b>endoscope,</b> is being pursued by multiple research groups. These potentially swallowable devices will radically expand the capabilities of natural orifice surgery by performing non-invasive tasks within the gastrointestinal tract that are now only possible with enteroscopic, laparoscopic, or open surgery. It is necessary for <b>a</b> robotic <b>capsule</b> <b>endoscope</b> to possess active, controlled mobility, which involves interactions between gastrointestinal tissue and engineering materials. Design challenges stem from the nonlinear and variable mechanical and physiological response of tissue and organs to the robot and from poor understanding of interfacial properties. In this work we initiate a study of the mechanical properties of the small intestine with the goal of accelerating the development of in vivo robotic <b>capsule</b> <b>endoscopes</b> for the gastrointestinal tract. To this end, four investigative devices and testing methods are presented: 1) A novel tribometer that measures the in vivo coefficient of friction between the mucosa and the robot surface; 2) An in vitro biaxial test apparatus and method for characterizing in-plane biomechanical properties of the bowel wall; 3) An in vitro test protocol to characterize the adhesive properties of mucosa; and 4) A novel manometer and force sensor array that measure the in vivo myenteric contact force against a solid bolus. Using these devices and test methods, the tribometry, passive biomechanics, mucosal adhesivity, and contractile response of the small intestinal tissue from multiple porcine models are measured.

40|$|Abstract Background Gastrointestinal (GI) {{endoscopy}} {{has been}} popularly {{applied for the}} diagnosis of diseases of the alimentary canal including Crohn's Disease, Celiac disease and other malabsorption disorders, benign and malignant tumors of the small intestine, vascular disorders and medication related small bowel injury. The wireless <b>capsule</b> <b>endoscope</b> has been successfully utilized to diagnose diseases of the small intestine and alleviate the discomfort and pain of patients. However, the resolution of demosaicked image is still low, and some interesting spots may be unintentionally omitted. Especially, the images will be severely distorted when physicians zoom images in for detailed diagnosis. Increasing resolution may cause significant power consumption in RF transmitter; hence, image compression is necessary for saving the power dissipation of RF transmitter. To overcome this drawback, we have been developing <b>a</b> new <b>capsule</b> <b>endoscope,</b> called GICam. Methods We developed an ultra-low-power image compression processor for <b>capsule</b> <b>endoscope</b> or swallowable imaging capsules. In applications of capsule endoscopy, {{it is imperative to}} consider battery life/performance trade-offs. Applying state-of-the-art video compression techniques may significantly reduce the image bit rate by their high compression ratio, but they all require intensive computation and consume much battery power. There are many fast compression algorithms for reducing computation load; however, they may result in distortion of the original image, which is not good for use in the medical care. Thus, this paper will first simplify traditional video compression algorithms and propose a scalable compression architecture. Conclusion As the result, the developed video compressor only costs 31 K gates at 2 frames per second, consumes 14. 92 mW, and reduces the video size by 75 % at least. </p...|$|R

The linear least square estimation is used to estimate the initial position of the source followed by a non-linear least square method to improve the localization accuracy. The method is applied on noise free simulated data obtained from FDTD simulations in the 403. 5 MHz MedRadio band of a simple homogeneous phantom and a more realistic heterogeneous phantom. The distance between the true position and the estimated po- sition is found to be within 1 cm for the simulated cases showing the possibility to use the proposed method for lo- calization of an RF source inside the human body, as long as the signal to noise ratio is high enough...|$|R
