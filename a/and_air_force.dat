5|$|The Army <b>and</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> Exchange Service (AAFES) is a {{specialty}} retailer that operates military retail stores on US Army <b>and</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> bases and installations across the world. Burger King {{was the first}} restaurant chain to be opened on US military facilities with a location at the US Naval base at Pearl Harbor, however naval facilities are covered by the Navy Exchange Service Command (NEXCOM). The AAFES opened its first Burger King franchise 1984 at the American military facilities in Ansbach, Germany. The location was the first restaurant opened under a five-year agreement, with a fifteen-year extension, in which the AAFES agreed it would open 185 locations globally. Since that time the AAFES has opened nearly 200 locations in all theaters of operations of the two services. Almost all of the AAFES-operated Burger King restaurants are found on army posts <b>and</b> <b>air</b> <b>force</b> bases; however some locations, {{such as the one}} located at the Baghdad International Airport, are within territories under US military jurisdiction.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech {{kicked off}} to Air Force {{to begin the}} game. The Falcons {{returned}} the kickoff to their 20-yard line, where the game began.
