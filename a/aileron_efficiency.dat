40|$|The {{present report}} {{presents}} the numerical investigation for the SPHYNX sub-scale re-entry vehicle {{performed by the}} DLR {{in order to provide}} reference solutions to the industrial team. Heat loads, flap and <b>aileron</b> <b>efficiency</b> are considered under different flow conditions derived from flight trajectory points. For the vehicle forebody the effects of grid resolution on surface temperature distribution is provided by the assumption of full and partial catalytic wall behaviour. Finally, the scaling effects are investigated by comparing the obtained CFD results with those of the X- 38 aerodynamic and aerothermodynamic databases. The present investigation indicates the possibility to use an existing aerodynamic and/or aerothermodynamic database for the design of a downsized or upsized vehicle respectively...|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{results for}} the X- 38 vehicle, shape 3. 1 and 8. 3 are {{presented}} and discussed. For shape 3. 1 the present report {{is a continuation of}} previous numerical studies carried out at DLR and therefore dedicated to explain and/or clarify specific problems found during those investigations. Flap and <b>aileron</b> <b>efficiency</b> are analyzed with respect to the geometry adopted for the flap, at several Mach numbers and under flight as well as wind tunnel flow conditions. For shape 8. 3 the goal of the present study is to demonstrate the ability of CFD to rebuild the experimental investigation carried out for this shape in the S- 3 Modane wind tunnel. Aerodynamic coefficients, flap and aileron efficiencies as well as a flow documentation are presented for M= 6 and alpha= 40 °. The results of the present investigation could not explain the differences found between data obtained from CFD and data obtained for the shape 3. 1 in the Langley wind tunnel. However, a good agreement between the numerical results and the aerodynamic data base (ADB) is found for both, flap and <b>aileron</b> <b>efficiency,</b> at the investigated flow conditions even though ADB was defined for flight Reynolds number with turbulent boundary layer. Also, the CFD results for shape 8. 3 are in good agreement with the data obtained for this shape in the Modane wind tunnel. The present investigation clearly demonstrates that for viscous dominated problems a good experimental/numerical correlation is achieved when not only the same physics but also the same degree of geometrical representation of the configuration is employed for both simulations. In most cases the numerical experimental discrepancies arising by the geometrical simplifications of the CFD configurations are larger than the discrepancies found due to CFD numerical accuracy and/or lack of physical modeling...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a comprehensive parameterization concept {{to set up}} complex structural models for aircraft wings. The approach is applicable for design tasks {{with a wide range}} of variation possibilities. This includes the outer geometry of the wing, the topology of the load carrying structure, and the sizes of structural components like for example the thickness of the wing skin. The concept is based on a parametric approach using parametric analytical functions that represent the geometrical model of the wing and the housing wing box. This model is the base for the finite element model. Furthermore the design variables, the constraints, various interface models, and a model for fuel mass configurations can also be derived by the parameterization concept. Various dimensioning processes for the wing structure are established, which can be combined arbitrarily. For the sizing optimization the wing structure, the weight is the objective function. Stress, buckling, and aeroelastic constraints can be incorporated in the optimization tasks. An application finally shows the capabilities of the concept for a parameter study showing the influence of the stringer orientation on <b>aileron</b> <b>efficiency.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Adaptive {{structures}} {{have been}} individuated as {{a topic of}} great interest for researchers working in aeronautical field. This is mainly due to the several benefits which {{can be obtained by}} implementing morphing technology in aircraft design; novel structures, in perspective fully-adaptable to different flight conditions, may in fact bring many advantage at system level: from noise emission reduction to aerodynamic efficiency enhancement and fuel-burn optimization. Such an approach, in spite of related benefits, presents a challenging problem: the same structure has to be stiff enough to withstand external aerodynamic loads without appreciable deformations while being flexible enough to dramatically change its external shape. In the framework of the CRIAQ MDO 505 project, the first joined program between Canadian and Italian research centers, academies and leading industries, the authors addressed the design assessment of a novel rib architecture enabling the camber variation of the aileron airfoil through a compliant mechanism. The architecture allows controlled aileron’s shape modification in order to improve the wing tip / <b>aileron</b> aerodynamic <b>efficiency</b> at low subsonic speed. On the base of specific target shapes and related external loads, the structural layout of the device was preliminarily defined. The reference geometry was tailored for a full scale wing of a civil regional transportation aircraft, where the conventional aileron component was substituted by the morphing device. Each aileron rib was composed of multiple, suitably shaped, rigid elements whose relative rotations were driven by means of an actuated linear spring. Advanced FE analyses were carried out in order to properly size the compliant mechanism and the actuation chain. System’s capability to reproduce target morphed shapes under the action of aerodynamic loads was successfully proved on the base of FE analyses outcomes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a semi-empirical method for the weight estimation of advanced transport aircraft concepts in early design stages. The aircraft weight is estimated according to four component groups with different sizing drivers. Emphasis {{is placed on}} the wing weight estimation considering aeroelastic effects. A physics-based wing weight estimation tool is used in a Design of Experiments and the results are applied in a least-squares regression obtaining wing Weight Estimating Relationships (WERs). Typical parameters covering a wide design space are considered so the method is applicable to business jets, regional turboprops, short-range and long-range transport aircraft. The WERs equations are presented in typical handbook form for simple application. Static aeroelastic loads, <b>aileron</b> <b>efficiency</b> and aeroelastic divergence effects on the wing weight are considered. Equations are presented for conventional transport aircraft, forward swept wing, strut-braced wing, and forward-swept strut-braced wing concepts. The WERs are applicable to aluminum or carbon-fiber reinforced plastic wings. The equations are verified for accuracy with available designs and the sensitivities are checked against the weights tool used to generate them. Application of the method in a simple design study illustrates its usefulness in quickly assessing different concepts for a set of requirements...|$|E
