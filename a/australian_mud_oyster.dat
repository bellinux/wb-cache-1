50|$|Marteilia refringens is a {{unicellular}} parasite {{affecting the}} digestive {{system of the}} flat oyster, Ostrea edulis. Other species that can be infected include the <b>Australian</b> <b>mud</b> <b>oyster</b> (O. angasi), the Argentinean oyster (O. puelchana), the Chilean flat oyster (O. chilensis), the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) and the Mediterranean mussel (M. galloprovincialis). Early stages {{of the life cycle}} occur in the epithelia of the digestive ducts and possibly the gills of the host. Later the parasite migrates to the epithelial cells of the digestive tubules. There may be no symptoms of infection. The factors triggering a pathogenic response are unclear but may be related to environmental stress. The gross signs of marteiliosis include the visceral tissues losing their pigmentation and becoming pale yellow. In some cases the mantle become translucent and shell growth may cease. Affected shellfish can become emaciated and in heavy infections tissues appear shrunken and slimy. Mortality seems {{to be related to the}} sporulation of the parasite. The parasite was first observed in France in 1979 and has since spread to other countries in Europe.|$|E

40|$|Within the Knysna Estuary Upogebia africana has an {{extensive}} distribution from north of Leisure Isle to the Red Bridge, occupying 62 % {{of the available}} intertidal zone. Six sites were surveyed within the above distributional range. U. africana was found from the high-water level (Spartina zone) to the shallow subtidal zone (to about 1. 5 m depth). The density, biomass and population structure of the mud prawns {{were found to be}} highly variable within the estuary. Only small animals (carapace length –× = 10. 9 mm) were found in the upper estuary at the Red Bridge.

40|$|Six-valent {{chromium}} (Cr 6 ＋) is {{a highly}} toxic pollutant, supplied {{in a variety of}} industrial activities such as leather tanning, cooling tower blowdown, and plating. Herein, we investigated the removal of Cr 6 ＋ from aqueous phase using low-cost adsorbents. Steel slag, montmorillonite, illite, kaolinite, red mud, and acid treated red mud with 0. 5, 1. 0, and 2. 0 M HCl were used as adsorbent for the removal of Cr 6 ＋ and the results showed that acid treated red mud with 2. 0 M HCl (ATRM- 2. 0 M) had higher adsorption capacity of Cr 6 ＋ than other adsorbents used. Accordingly, Cr 6 ＋ removal by ATRM- 2. 0 M were studied in a batch system with respect to changes in initial concentration of Cr 6 ＋, initial solution pH, adsorbent dose, adsorbent mixture, and seawater. Equilibrium sorption data were described well by Freundlich isotherm model. The influence of initial solution pH on Cr 6 ＋ adsorption was insignificant. The use of the ATRM- 2. 0 M alone was more effective than mixing it with other adsorbents including red <b>mud,</b> zeolite, <b>oyster</b> shell, lime stone, and montmorillonite for the removal of Cr 6 ＋.

40|$|Tidal creeks {{are small}} estuarine {{watersheds}} characterized by low freshwater input, marine to brackish salinity, and subtidal, intertidal, and supratidal habitats. Most people {{are familiar with}} large rivers and estuaries, but the smaller tidal watersheds comprise {{a greater percentage of}} the coastline. As the population along coasts rises there is growing concern about water quality and increased sedimentation rates. Therefore, these smaller tidal creek watersheds are at risk to pollution, decreased environmental health, and deterioration of protective salt marshes. The {{purpose of this study was}} to test methods for high spatial resolution mapping of benthic (submerged) and emergent habitats as well as the derivation of bathymetry using DigitalGlobe’s WorldView- 2 imagery. An intensive field effort was conducted to test and assess several image processing techniques. Results concluded that: (1) supervised habitat classification produced the highest map accuracy (95 %); (2) sand, water, scrub/shrub, and docks/rubble were mapped the most accurately at greater than 95 %; (3) saltmarsh habitats (high and low density cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora, and black needlerush, Juncus roemerianus), <b>mud,</b> and <b>oyster</b> beds were between 80 and 85 % accurate; (4) pan-sharpening and atmospheric correction did not improve map accuracy; (5) LiDAR (light detection and ranging) data increased habitat map accuracy; and (6) WorldView- 2 imagery was capable of deriving water depth and these data increased the map accuracy of benthic habitats. The project produced habitat maps for benthic and emergent species at high spatial resolution (4 m 2) which will be useful for studying the dynamic processes in this tidal environment.

50|$|The {{comparatively}} rich coastal country allowed permanent residence. Natural {{resources of}} land and sea were abundant and harvested according to the seasons. Winter mullet schooled from May to July. Dolphins were trained to herd the fish into waiting nets and spears. Winter was the best season for bream, followed by tailor in September and October. In summer <b>mud</b> crabs and <b>oysters</b> were plentiful and dugong were hunted. Summer whiting and flathead were speared or netted. Bungwall Fern was gathered for its starchy roots all year round. Kangaroo, eels and carpet snakes were rich in protein and fat. The dominant shellfish used as food was the oyster known today as the Sydney Rock Oyster known locally as tibir, at that time growing naturally on the seabeds. The oyster middens, many metres thick, were plundered by early settlers for lime. A significant midden site, now lost, was located not far from Bongaree jetty.

40|$|Predator-prey {{interactions}} are often highly co-evolved, with selection over time for prey with morphological and behavioral traits that minimize predation risk. Consequently, in many environments prey choose among potential habitats {{according to their}} refuge value. It is unclear, however, when presented with new habitats, if prey are able to evaluate the predation risk of these relative to familiar habitats and utilize these {{in accordance with their}} value. We tested whether, along the east coast of the USA, native mud crabs Panopeus herbstii utilize the non-native alga Gracilaria vermiculophylla according to its relative refuge value. Experiments examining predation by blue crabs Callinectes sapidus on mud crabs revealed that the non-native alga had an intermediate refuge value relative to native oysters, which were the most protective, and unvegetated sediment, which was the least. In subsequent choice experiments, <b>mud</b> crabs selected <b>oysters</b> over alga over unvegetated sediment, in accordance with habitat refuge values. Further, in field experiments, the use of Gracilaria by mud crabs was inversely related to the proximity of the alga to the preferred habitat type, oysters, and was reduced by the presence of a blue crab predator. Consequently, mud crabs are utilizing the non-native alga Gracilaria in accordance with its intermediate refuge value. The relative refuge value of non-native vs native habitat-forming species may provide a baseline expectation against which to measure the speed of learning and opportunism in the response of native prey to novel protective habitats. 7 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Reef-building species form {{discrete}} patches atop soft sediments, and reef restoration {{often involves}} depositing solid material {{as a substrate}} for larval settlement and growth. There have been few theoretical efforts to optimize the physical characteristics of a restored reef patch to achieve high recruitment rates. The delivery of competent larvae to a reef patch is influenced by larval behavior and by physical habitat characteristics such as substrate roughness, patch length, current speed, and water depth. We used a spatial model, the "hitting-distance" model, to identify habitat characteristics that will jointly maximize both the settlement probability and the density of recruits on an oyster reef (Crassostrea virginica). Modeled larval behaviors were based on laboratory observations and included turbulence-induced diving, turbulence-induced passive sinking, and neutral buoyancy. Profiles of currents and turbulence were based on velocity profiles measured in coastal Virginia over four different substrates: natural <b>oyster</b> reefs, <b>mud,</b> and deposited <b>oyster</b> and whelk shell. Settlement probabilities were higher on larger patches, whereas average settler densities were higher on smaller patches. Larvae settled most successfully and had the smallest optimal patch length when diving over rough substrates in shallow water. Water depth was the greatest source of variability, followed by larval behavior, substrate roughness, and tidal current speed. This result suggests {{that the best way}} to maximize settlement on restored reefs is to construct patches of optimal length for the water depth, whereas substrate type is less important than expected. Although physical patch characteristics are easy to measure, uncertainty about larval behavior remains an obstacle for predicting settlement patterns. The mechanistic approach presented here could be combined with a spatially explicit metapopulation model to optimize the arrangement of reef patches in an estuary or region for greater sustainability of restored habitats...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the effects}} of {{multiple}} anthropogenic changes on local ecosystems is important for understanding community interactions. Because they lie at the interface between the land and sea coastal ecosystems are often heavily impacted by anthropogenic stressors and environmental change. For example, approximately {{one third of the}} anthropogenic CO 2 released into the atmosphere is taken up by the ocean, causing reductions in pH and in the amount of bio-available carbonate ions. Simultaneously, we are experiencing increases in sea surface temperatures. These two stressors are impacting coastal ecosystems by altering biodiversity, species phenology and distribution, community composition, and biological invasions. These changes in individual species will undoubtedly affect their trophic interactions, which might be especially important for ecological communities centered around foundation species, which stabilize and provide habitat for a multitude species. Therefore, I asked if ocean acidification and increased sea surface temperatures would impact growth and survival of the foundation species, the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica), change the nature of the trophic interactions between juvenile eastern <b>oysters</b> and predatory <b>mud</b> crabs (Panopeus spp.), and alter coastal community compositions. To examine these questions I setup a 2 x 4 experimental design where oysters were grown in one of two levels of CO 2 (ambient and elevated) and one of four different temperature treatments (0, 1, 2, and 3 [degrees]C above ambient). Oysters alone showed decreased survival, shell height, and filtration with increasing temperature. In the presence of <b>mud</b> crabs, more <b>oysters</b> were consumed when grown in elevated CO 2 and increased temperature. Elevated CO 2 environments increased soft bodied organisms, such as Molgula manhattensis which can compete with oysters for food and settling space, and decreased the presence of organisms that rely on calcium ions. These results illustrate the importance of investigating trophic interactions in multiple stressor environments. These types of studies are an important step for managers attempting to understand and predict the impacts of climate change on important and in some cases economically valuable ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} has focused on the non-lethal effects of predator intimidation and fear, dubbed non-consumptive effects (NCEs), in which prey actively change their behavior and habitat use in response to predator chemical cues. Although NCEs can have large impacts on community structure, many studies have ignored differences in predator population structure and properties of the natural environment that may modify the magnitude and importance of NCEs. Here, I investigated the roles of predator size and density (i. e. biomass), as well as habitat characteristics, on predator risk assessment and the magnitude of consumptive and NCEs using blue crabs, <b>mud</b> crabs, and <b>oyster</b> prey as a model system. Predation experiments between blue crabs and mud crabs demonstrated that blue crabs consume mud crabs; however, the consumptive effects were dependent upon blue crab body size and habitat type. When mud crabs were exposed to chemical cues from differing biomasses of blue crabs in laboratory mesocosms, mud crab activity and predation on oysters was decreased in response to high biomass treatments (i. e. large and multiple small blue crabs), but not to low biomass predators (i. e single small blue crab), suggesting that risk associated with predator size is perceptible via chemical cues and is based on predator biomass. Further experiments showed that the perception of risk and the magnitude of the NCEs were affected by the sensory cues available and the diet of the blue crab predator. The NCE based on blue crab biomass was also demonstrated in the field where water flow can disperse cues necessary for propagating NCEs. Properties of water flow were measured within the experimental design and during the experiment and confirmed cage environments were representative of natural conditions and that patterns in NCEs were not associated with flow characteristics. These results affect species conservation and commercial fisheries management and demonstrate that we cannot successfully predict NCEs without considering predator size structure and the contexts under which we determine predator risk.

50|$|A {{number of}} {{habitats}} {{make up the}} bay bottom; the dominant eelgrass Benthic habitat in the cove's of Patchogue Bay which can be classified as muddy sandflat and sandflat habitats. Many species that are found in both habitats. Sandy bottom types worms, slipper shell, and blue mussel, and <b>mud</b> crab. Atlantic <b>oyster</b> dril, a predator of bivalves, is abundant in eelgrass beds in Patchogue and Bellport Bay, and rock crab. The distribution and abundance of benthic species in the bay's eelgrass community is likely controlled {{by a number of}} factors that include eelgrass stem density, water temperature and salinity, sediment type, predation, food supply, and human harvest. Much of the bay is open water, while marshes and flats have developed on the protected northern edge of the barrier beach that shelters Patchogue Bay and the mainland from the Atlantic Ocean. Extensive tidal marshes and flats have developed on the bay side of Fire Island as well. Eelgrass beds are concentrated in the shallow waters along the back side of Fire Island, Silversides, killifish, menhaden, and bay anchovy. Forage fish species are found throughout the various aquatic habitats in the bay at different times of the year. Atlantic silverside, the most dominant member through much of the year, in most of the bay. Bay anchovy is the major mid-bay water column occupant in the summer during its spawning time in late June and July. Killifishes include mummichog in the salt marsh habitats, striped killifish over sandy habitat, and sheepshead minnow in both habitats. Sticklebacks, including fourspine and threespine, are spring and summer spawners associated with submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV); although they are very abundant, their use as prey for other fish and birds is limited due to spines, body armor, and close association with vegetative cover. Northern pipefish s) is a zooplankton consumer preyed upon by both striped bass and summer flounder. American sandlance, probably the most abundant winter species, provides important forage for many species of special emphasis in the Bight. Summer flounder enter the bay in winter and spring and grow rapidly in the productive waters. The bay supports significant shellfishery for northern quahog and is a major spawning, nursery, and foraging area for blue crab. Other common aquatic species occurring in the backbarrier lagoon systems of Long Island include blue mussel, bay scallop, eastern oyster, horseshoe crab, American eel, spot, Atlantic croaker, northern kingfish, and northern puffer. There are a number of significant trout resources in streams that drain into The Bay. Nine of the twelve verified wild brook trout populations of Long Island occur in the Bay's drainage. Patchogue's Swan River, and many other local tributaries such as Mud Creek, Patchogue Creek, and Terrel Creek all contain naturally reproducing populations of brook trout.|$|R

Oysters obtained from an oyster lease from an uncontaminated area were deployed for a three month period at four sites within Spillway Creek and two external control sites. After retrieval, oysters (soft tissue) were analysed for concentrations of fluoride and nine metals. Between site comparisons included oysters from the <b>oyster</b> lease. <b>Mud</b> crabs were collected from the same sites over a two week period immediately prior to oyster retrieval and assessed {{for the presence of}} rust spot shell disease. Hepatopancreas (liver) and muscle tissues of mud crabs were also analysed for fluoride and metal concentrations and between site comparisons made. Concentrations of fluoride and metals in <b>oysters</b> and <b>mud</b> crabs were also compared to food guidelines. The mud crab results were also compared to the findings of a previous study 'Fluoride and metals in Spillway Creek Crustacea' (Andersen et al., 2001). Analyses of water metal and fluoride concentrations in Spillway Creek were also undertaken by BSL on one occasion. Despite elevated concentrations of fluoride in water samples closer to the discharge channel there were no between site differences in fluoride accumulations in oysters. Concentrations were, however, elevated in mud crab muscle from mud crabs closer to the discharge channel compared to sites near the mouth of Spillway Creek and the external reference sites, althoug. lJ. the site separation was not statistically significant. A similar trend of fluoride accumulation in mud crab muscle was evident in the previous study. Although mean concentrations in mud crab hepatopancreas tended to be more elevated in the Spillway Creek sites these were not significantly different to reference sites. Concentrations in mud crab muscle were not at such a level as to pose a human health risk from the consumption of mud crab meat. Nickel was elevated in Spillway oysters closer to the discharge suggesting exposure to bioavailable nickel, however a reverse trend of accumulation was evident for copper, zinc {{and to a lesser extent}} iron. Lilly Island oysters often had some of the highest metal concentrations, with oysters from the lease area often the lowest. Wild Cattle appeared to be a suitable control site.
