25|$|Around {{the middle}} of the 2nd century BC, a 6 × 12 columns Corinthian peripteros was built in Olba-Diokaisarea in Rugged Cilicia. Its columns, mostly still upright, stand on <b>Attic</b> <b>bases</b> without plinths, {{exceptional}} for the period. The 24 flutings of the columns are only indicated by facets in the lower third. Each of the Corinthian capitals is made of three separate parts, an exceptional form. The entablature of the temple was probably in the Doric order, as is suggested by fragments of mutuli scattered among the ruins. All of these details suggest an Alexandrian workshop, since Alexandria showed the greatest tendency to combine Doric entablatures with Corinthian capitals and to do without the plinth under <b>Attic</b> <b>bases.</b>|$|R

50|$|Part of the fluted {{shaft of}} a Roman column with an <b>Attic</b> <b>base,</b> made of white marble, 0.45 m high and 1.3 m in {{diameter}} at its lower end, {{has recently been}} unearthed {{in the area of}} the forum on a lot in Calle Antonio Quintanilla next to a section of a stone block wall. It appears to belong to a building of great magnitude near the forum; it may have been a basilica or temple. These elements relate closely to those existing since ancient times in the neighboring house. Several fragments of a shaft and a Corinthian capital decorated with acanthus leaves were found in the same street.|$|E
50|$|The current Córdoba Gate is {{the result}} of various renovations to the {{original}} Roman gate and to the still extant wall ascending the adjacent hill. It has three columns with Corinthian capitals set {{on each side of the}} entranceway and configured in the classical manner, standing on an <b>Attic</b> <b>base</b> without a plinth on a double socle; they are flanked by two semi-octagonal watchtowers. The parallel architecture dates the works to the reign of Augustus or Tiberius. The north tower was rebuilt after being destroyed in the earthquake of 1504. The current appearance of the gate is due to the intervention of the architect José Carmona of Echamorro, 1786-1800.|$|E
5000|$|The amphitheater is {{surrounded}} by a colonnade, with main entrances at the east and west axes. The capitals of the columns are Doric, but rest on an <b>Attic</b> <b>base.</b> The entablature above the columns, however, is Ionic to allow for inscriptions. These inscriptions, on the exterior of the entablature, list 44 major battles from the American Revolutionary War through the Spanish-American War. Low, backless marble benches in concentric circles face the semi-circular main stage, which has three levels. The lowest level features a klismos, a form of ancient Greek informal chair meant for rulers. The klismos chair faces the audience, much as a cathedra (or bishop's chair) does. Hastings intended the klismos chair to remind the audience of the missing heroes honored by the amphitheater. The second level of the stage has a podium. The stage and amphitheater are designed so that any speaker must look down at the klismos chair while addressing the audience, and must look at the USS Maine Mast Memorial if looking up. The third and uppermost level of the stage contains a semi-circular seating area for about 100 people and an apse in the back. The interior dome of the apse is richly carved, and the square pilasters {{on either side of the}} stage list the names of famous American generals (left, as you face the stage) and admirals (right) from the American Revolutionary War through the Spanish-American War. A quote from General George Washington's June 26, 1775, letter to the Continental Congress is inscribed inside the apse: [...] "When we assumed the soldier we did not lay aside the citizen." [...] A quote from President Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address is inscribed above the stage: [...] "We here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain." [...] Decorative 9 ft tall urns carved with eagles, rams' heads, and snakes were placed on pedestals in niches on either side of the stage.|$|E

50|$|In {{the area}} of the Convent Pasture, the {{excavations}} revealed, under a large domus of the Augustan era, the presence of an exceptional public monument, which was at the time unique in Gaul: a Roman basilica with three naves and an internal peristyle with a peripheral ambulatory, displaying four rows of eight columns or eight pilasters. It was connected on the east with a small square, 22 meters on a side, bordered to the north and south with porticos which were extensions of the walls of the annexes of the basilica. On the west it was connected to the main road of Bibracte with another square, 17 meters on the side. Some architectural elements have been found that attest the presence of limestone columns with <b>Attic</b> <b>bases</b> and Doric and Corinthian capitals. These elements formed a monumental urban project of the greatest importance. These public buildings date to the period between 50 and 40 BCE and between 35 and 25 BCE. At this date, the basilica and the square were carefully leveled and replaced by a large private residence, doubtless in connection with the move of the Aedui capital to Autun. The basilica of Bibracte confirms the exceptional importance of the site and revealed that the Romanization of the Aedui was considerably more rapid than previously believed. The basilica of Bibracte is currently the oldest representation of Roman monumental stone architecture in non-Mediterranean Europe.|$|R
6000|$|... "The Scuola di San Rocco {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{interesting}} examples of Renaissance work in Venice. Its fluted pillars are surrounded each by a wreath, one of vine, another of laurel, another of oak, not indeed arranged with the fantasticism of early Gothic; but, especially the laurel, reminding one strongly of the laurel sprays, powerful as well as beautiful, of Veronese and Tintoret. Their stems are curiously and richly interlaced--the last vestige of the Byzantine wreathed work--and the vine-leaves are ribbed on the surfaces, I think, nearly as finely as those of the Noah,[106] though more injured by time. The capitals are far the richest Renaissance in Venice, less corrupt and more masculine in plan, than any other, and truly suggestive of support, though of course showing the tendency to error in this respect; and finally, at the angles of the pure <b>Attic</b> <b>bases,</b> on the square plinth, are set couchant animals; one, an elephant four inches high, very curiously and cleverly cut, and all these details worked with a spirit, finish, fancy, and affection quite worthy of the middle ages. But they have all the marked fault of being utterly detached from the architecture. The wreaths round the columns look as if they would drop off the next moment, and the animals at the bases produce exactly the effect of mice who had got there by accident: one feels them ridiculously diminutive, and utterly useless." ...|$|R

50|$|Although the deme of Ikaria {{was most}} {{famous for its}} worship of Dionysos, it was also well known for the high quality white marble quarried there, a {{reputation}} which it maintains even today. During the 5th and 4th centuries BC, all of Attika was divided into approximately 170 demes (villages), each of which sent one or more Βουλευτες (representatives) to the Βουλη (Council) of 500 to govern on a daily basis. The demes were then grouped into τριττυες, which in turn were combined to make ten <b>Attic</b> tribes <b>based</b> solely on a man’s residence, not any social status. Ikaria was such a large deme that it sent five (5) representatives annually to the Council of 500, and it belonged to the tribe Αεγεις, named after the Attic hero Aegeus who also gave his name to the Aegean Sea.|$|R

5000|$|Another {{possibility}} is that the numerals were acrophonic, like the <b>Attic</b> numerals, and <b>based</b> on the [...] alphabet.

However, there are problems of timing and lack of records. The full set of numerals is not attested until the 1st-2nd century CE, 400 years after Ashoka.

50|$|Church E was a compact, quintuple domed {{building}} of brick and marble constructed {{directly over the}} leveled ruins of Church EA around the thirteenth-century.

5000|$|The {{three most}} {{important}} standards of the Ancient Greek monetary system were the <b>Attic</b> standard, <b>based</b> on the Athenian drachma of 4.3 grams of silver and the Corinthian standard based on the stater of 8.6 grams of silver, that was subdivided into three silver drachmas of 2.9 grams, and the Aeginetan stater or didrachm of 12.2 grams, based on a drachma of 6.1 grams. The word drachm(a) means [...] "a handful", literally [...] "a grasp". Drachmae were divided into six obols (from the Greek word for a spit), and six spits made a [...] "handful". This suggests that before coinage came {{to be used in}} Greece, spits in prehistoric times were used as measures in daily transactions. In archaic/pre-numismatic times iron was valued for making durable tools and weapons, and its casting in spit form may have actually represented a form of transportable bullion, which eventually became bulky and inconvenient after the adoption of precious metals. Because of this very aspect, Spartan legislation famously forbade issuance of Spartan coin, and enforced the continued use of iron spits so as to discourage avarice and the hoarding of wealth. In addition to its original meaning (which also gave the euphemistic diminutive [...] "obelisk", [...] "little spit"), the word obol (ὀβολός, obolós, or ὀβελός, obelós) was retained as a Greek word for coins of small value, still used as such in Modern Greek slang (όβολα, óvola, [...] "monies").|$|R
40|$|A {{transient}} heat and mass transfer model {{was developed to}} predict ceiling heat gain/loss through the attic space in residences and to accurately estimate savings in cooling and heating loads produced {{by the use of}} radiant barriers. The model accounted for transient conduction, convection and radiation and incorporated moisture and air transport across the attic. Environmental variables such as solar loads on outer attic surfaces and sky temperatures were also estimated. The model was driven by hourly weather data which included: time, outdoor air temperature, horizontal sun and sky radiation, wind speed and direction, relative humidity (dew point), and cloud cover data. The outputs of the model were ceiling heat fluxes, inner and outer heat fluxes from all surfaces, inner and outer surface temperatures and attic air temperatures. Transient conduction was modeled using response factors. Response factors were calculated for each <b>attic</b> component <b>based</b> on construction type. Convective heat transfer was modeled using ?flat plate? correlations found in the literature and radiative heat transfer was modeled using radiation enclosure theory. Moisture was incorporated via a condensation/evaporation model. A new procedure was developed to account for attic air stratification. Both forced and natural attic ventilation patterns were added to the model for three types of louver combination arrangements. An iterative technique was used to solve a set of simultaneous heat balance equations. The model predictions were compared to experimental data gathered throughout a three year experimental effort of side-by-side testing of attics retrofit with radiant barriers. The model was compared to the experimental data for a variety of situations which included: different attic insulation levels, various attic airflow rates, cooling and heating seasons, and different radiant barrier orientations. The model predicted ceiling heat flows within 10 % for most cases. The model was used to run simulations and parametric studies under a diversity of climates, insulation levels and attic airflow patterns. Model predictions and results were presented on the basis of savings produced by the use of radiant barriers. Hourly, daily, and seasonal predictions by the model were in excellent agreement with observed experimental data and with literature...|$|R
