The Eastern {{derivative}} in the Russian rock came with soundtracks from movies like Day Watch that had Tamerlan's legend of the Chalk of Destiny <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>roots.</b> Russian rock expressively used and integrated elements from culture, as well as Western and Eastern (especially countries of the USSR).|$|E
25|$|The Proto-Indo-Europeans {{may have}} {{believed}} {{in some kind}} of world tree. It is also possible that they may have believed that this tree was either guarded by or under constant attack from some kind of dragon or serpent. In Norse mythology, the world ash tree Yggdrasil is tended by the three Norns while the dragon Nidhogg gnaws <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>roots.</b> In Greek mythology, the tree of the golden apples in the Garden of the Hesperides is tended by the three Hesperides and guarded by the hundred-headed dragon Ladon. In Indo-Iranian texts, there is a mythical tree dripping with Soma, the immortal drink of the gods and, in later Pahlavi sources, an evil lizard is said to lurk at the bottom of it.|$|E

Another organization to grace its way into the Baltimore scene is [...] The latter organization's mission is to give young artists performance opportunities in and out of Baltimore. These non-profits play a greater role in the city's musical life than similar organization do in most other American cities. The organization Jazz in Cool Places also works within that genre, presenting performers in architecturally significant locations, such as in a club full of Tiffany windows. The Society for the Preservation of American Roots Music also puts on jazz and blues concerts <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>Roots</b> Cafe.|$|E
2500|$|<b>At</b> <b>its</b> <b>roots,</b> {{geometry}} {{consists of}} a notion of congruence between different objects in a space. [...] In the late 19th century, notions of congruence were typically supplied by the action of a Lie group on space. [...] Lie groups generally act quite rigidly, and so a Cartan geometry is a generalization of this notion of congruence to allow for curvature to be present. [...] The flat Cartan geometriesthose with zero curvatureare locally equivalent to homogeneous spaces, hence geometries in the sense of Klein.|$|E
2500|$|For 1964 the Thunderbird was restyled {{in favor}} of a more squared-off appearance, which was mostly evident when viewing the car from the side or rear. Hinting <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>roots</b> in the {{previous}} generation Thunderbird that it evolved from, the new model retained a similar grille design with dual headlights and a [...] wheelbase. As before, the new Thunderbird continued to be offered in hardtop, convertible, and Landau versions. The [...] FE V8 continued as the standard engine for the Thunderbird. It was paired with a 3-speed automatic transmission. For 1965, sequential turn signals were added, flashing the individual segments of the broad, horizontal tail lights in sequences from inside to outside to indicate a turn. Also new for 1965 were standard front disc brakes, and doubled sided keys.|$|E

They try to comfort her and express their affection, but she {{describes}} her unhappiness by explaining that, once a flower has withered, when cut <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>roots</b> it cannot come back to life. Then, she expresses her real feelings of frustration against Filippo: (Aria: Ma la sola, oimė! son io, / che penar per lui si veda? / [...] "Am I the only one to whom he has brought grief"? she asks) and feels her shame, to the sorrow of her ladies. In a finale, first Beatrice, then the ladies express their frustrations: (Cabaletta: Ah! la pena in lor piombò / [...] "Ah, they have been punished for the love that ruined me").|$|E
2500|$|Chapter one, [...] "The Study of Folklore and the Reclamation of Paganism", {{offers a}} {{historical}} introduction to Contemporary Paganism, looking <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>roots</b> in the Classical World of Greece and Rome, {{and then the}} successive influences of Neoplatonism, Renaissance magic, the Protestant Reformation and the Enlightenment. Magliocco then looks at the influence that 18th and 19th century folkloristics and anthropology had on the Romanticists and then Pagan movement, in particular the work of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the Brothers Grimm and Sir James Frazer. Proceeding {{to look at this}} relationship, she highlights the work of Charles Leland, Margaret Murray and Gerald Gardner, who drew from folklore in their own books, all of which heavily influenced modern Paganism. Magliocco argues that Contemporary Paganism {{can be viewed as a}} [...] "folk tradition" [...] on two levels; firstly, because it continues to work with and propagate the spiritual traditions of western esotericism, and secondly, because it acts as a form of [...] "resistance culture" [...] in opposition to dominant trends in western culture. Finally, she borrows the concept of [...] "textual poachers" [...] from the French sociologist Michel de Certeau, arguing that the Pagan community fit this model well, collating elements from a wide variety of sources and composing them into something new, in this case a religious movement.|$|E
2500|$|It was an {{all-metal}} single bay sesquiplane, fabric covered {{except for}} the fuselage ahead of the cockpit. The gap between the wings was small and the stagger marked. [...] The lower wing was conventionally mounted {{at the bottom of}} the fuselage and the upper planes, built in separate pieces, braced close to the upper fuselage on short, faired extensions. In section the wings were aerodynamically thick and strongly cambered. [...] There were ailerons only on the upper plane, the plan, structure and bracing of which was greatly altered during 1923. [...] When the H.26 made its first public appearance, at the Paris Aero Show in December 1922, the still uncovered upper wing of the unflown fighter had long, gently curved tips outboard of a straight edged, constant chord central section and had a single main spar. Sixteen months later, after the aircraft had flown, the wings had become rectangular and were built around two spars. [...] The short span lower wing retained its single spar structure throughout but it, too, had curved tips replaced with square. The wing bracing had also changed: originally a bracing wire ran from the rear undercarriage structure upwards and outwards, via the lower to the upper wing. [...] This was replaced by a single, wide chord rigid strut with an aerofoil section and widened <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>roots.</b>|$|E

25|$|Phylogeny {{as applied}} to {{historical}} linguistics involves the evolutionary descent of languages. The phylogeny problem {{is the question of}} what specific tree, in the tree model of language evolution, best explains the paths of descent of all the members of a language family from a common language, or proto-language (at the root of the tree) to the attested languages (at the leaves of the tree). The Germanic languages form a tree with Proto-Germanic <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>root</b> that is a branch of the Indo-European tree, which in turn has Proto-Indo-European <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>root.</b> Borrowing of lexical items from contact languages makes the relative position of the Germanic branch within Indo-European less clear than the positions of the other branches of Indo-European. In the course of the development of historical linguistics, various solutions have been proposed, none certain and all debatable.|$|R

60|$|Their {{own land}} was mere forest. The trees {{had grown so}} think and close that they {{shouldered}} one another out of their places, and the weakest, forced into shapes of strange distortion, languished like cripples. The best were stunted, from the pressure and the want of room; and high about the stems of all grew long rank grass, dank weeds, and frowsy underwood; not divisible into their separate kinds, but tangled all together in a heap; a jungle deep and dark, with neither earth nor water <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>roots,</b> but putrid matter, formed of the pulpy offal of the two, and of their own corruption.|$|E

She crept {{on her hands and knees}} to the opening and looked out. At first the ground seemed to be undulating between her and the opposite tree. But a second glance showed her the black and gray, bristling, tossing backs of tumbling beasts of prey, charging the carcass of the bear that lay <b>at</b> <b>its</b> <b>roots,</b> or contesting for the prize with gluttonous choked breath, sidelong snarls, arched spines, and recurved tails.
