Despite the new surroundings, Josephine continued to mourn for Eva but focused her feelings on helping others; she later wrote that she [...] "became possessed with an irresistible urge to go forth <b>and</b> <b>find</b> <b>some</b> pain keener than my own, to meet with people more unhappy than myself.... It was not difficult to find misery in Liverpool." [...] She made regular visits to the workhouse at Brownlow Hill, an institution that could hold 5,000 individuals. She would sit with the women in the cellars—many of whom were prisoners—and pick oakum with them, while discussing the Bible or praying with them.|$|E

[...] The actress shared Gamble's opinion of Bela's {{behavior}} being a façade, and incorporated into her performance the idea of Bela hiding her true self, with Cohan feeling that her character created a persona to shield her from [...] "real strong connections". This defensiveness prevented her from opening up to the Winchesters, with whom Cohan believed Bela [...] "would have loved to be able to have a normal relationship". Contrary to Kripke and Gamble's assessment of Bela as amoral and uncaring, Cohan envisioned the character as having [...] "fits of conscience" [...] offscreen throughout the third season. In the actress's opinion, Bela [...] "would have loved to go around fighting evil with those boys." ...|$|E

The crew settled down to a comfortable routine in which boredom and inactivity were the main enemies. Men began to irritate each other, and fights sometimes broke out. Nansen attempted to start a newspaper, but the project soon fizzled out through lack of interest. Small tasks were undertaken and scientific observations maintained, {{but there was no}} urgency. Nansen expressed his frustration in his journal: [...] "I feel I must break through this deadness, this inertia, <b>and</b> <b>find</b> <b>some</b> outlet for my energies." [...] And later: [...] "Can't something happen? Could not a hurricane come and tear up this ice?"

500|$|Josephine Butler (1828–1906) was an English {{feminist and}} social {{reformer}} in the Victorian era. She was especially {{concerned with the}} welfare of prostitutes although she campaigned on {{a broad range of}} women's rights. In 1864 her daughter Eva fell [...] from the top-floor bannister onto the stone floor of the hallway in her home; she died three hours later. The death led Butler to begin a career of campaigning that ran until the end of her life; she later wrote that after the death she [...] "became possessed with an irresistible urge to go forth <b>and</b> <b>find</b> <b>some</b> pain keener than my own, to meet with people more unhappy than myself.... It was not difficult to find misery in Liverpool." [...] Her targets included obtaining the vote, the right to better education and the end of coverture in British law, although she achieved her greatest success in leading the movement to repeal the Contagious Diseases Acts, legislation that attempted to control the spread of venereal diseases, particularly in the British Army and Royal Navy. She was also opposed to the forced medical examination of prostitutes—a process she described as [...] "surgical" [...] or [...] "steel rape". Her campaigning led to the suspension of the practice in April 1883, and the Acts were formally repealed in three years later.|$|E
500|$|Bryant and Bob Green were {{divorced}} in May 1979, {{in a dispute}} made public through newspapers. Bryant moved to Alabama and gave a candid interview to Ladies Home Journal in 1980 where she told {{the details of her}} marriage during the campaign. She claimed she had been [...] "married for the wrong reasons" [...] and that she and Green had fought regularly, often considering divorce. Green became her manager and she claimed exhaustion due to being booked for every event available, making $700,000 in 1976 ( [...] dollars). She had checked herself into a Christian psychiatric facility in 1973, and regularly saw psychiatrists and marriage counselors. Her anxiety manifested itself in chest pains, tremors, difficulty swallowing food, and a bout with 24-hour paralysis during a trip to Israel with the Falwell family. Bryant revealed she had received severe criticism from Christians following her divorce. One Canadian pastor expressed doubt to her that she had [...] "ever met the Lord", to her humiliation. As a result of the backlash she received from Christians, Bryant had softened her stances on gay rights: [...] "The church needs to be more loving, unconditionally, and willing to see these people as human beings, to minister to them and try to understand. If I had it to do over, I'd do it again, but not in the same way," [...] and feminism: [...] "The church needs to wake up <b>and</b> <b>find</b> <b>some</b> way to cope with divorce and women's problems that are based on Biblical principles. I believe in the long run God will vindicate me. I've about given up on the fundamentalists, who have become so legalistic and letter-bound to the Bible." ...|$|E

[...] He began by collecting unpaid customs duties in order to raise more revenue for the Sultan, and sent emissaries to Isa Bin Salih, the Imam's chief deputy. [...] Wingate's initial overtures proved unsuccessful, so he threatened to impose a [...] "punitive tax" [...] on dates, the chief export crop of Oman. [...] Because the Sultan controlled the ports and coastal areas, he had the power to collect such a tax, which would have ruined the Omani farmers. After the imposition of the tax, riots erupted in the interior, and the Imam was murdered by angry farmers. [...] A new Imam, who was more willing to negotiate, was selected and requested a meeting with Wingate.|$|E
2500|$|Some Christian {{fundamentalist}} {{audiences and}} venues shunned Bryant after her divorce. Because {{she was no}} longer invited to appear at their events, she lost another major source of income. With three of her four children, she moved from Miami to Selma, Alabama, and later to Atlanta, Georgia. In a 1980 Ladies' Home Journal article she said, [...] "The church needs to wake up <b>and</b> <b>find</b> <b>some</b> way to cope with divorce and women's problems." [...] She also expressed some sympathy for feminist aspirations, given her own experiences of emotional abuse within her previous marriage. Bryant also commented on her anti-gay views and said, [...] "I'm more inclined to say live and let live, just don't flaunt it or try to legalize it." [...] However, the biography page on her Anita Bryant Ministries website (written in 2006) continues to defend her earlier anti-gay activism and views.|$|E

2500|$|Citizens {{and governments}} have been {{concerned}} with misuse of social networking services by children and teenagers, in particular in relation to online sexual predators. For instance, there is a study which suggests the children are {{not too far from}} inappropriate content on YouTube. Overuse of social networking may also make children more susceptible to depression and anxiety. Governments are taking action to better understand the problem <b>and</b> <b>find</b> <b>some</b> solutions. A 2008 panel concluded that technological fixes such as age verification and scans are relatively ineffective means of apprehending online predators. In May 2010, a child pornography social networking site with hundreds of members was dismantled by law enforcement. It was deemed [...] "the largest crimes against children case brought anywhere by anyone". Girls in particular are also known to be at more of a risk online using social networks than boys. According to the article, High Tech or High Risks: Moral Panics About Girls Online, it suggests that young girls are more at risks because they are often represented through [...] "products of play" [...] in transgressive poses because they often manipulate other users online by making themselves look older than what they actually appear which can attract sexual predators. Many parents of teenage girls worry about their safety online because of the many manipulations there are online and on social networking sites.|$|E
2500|$|One {{headline}} in a September 1895 article by The New York Times ran [...] "Armenian Holocaust," [...] while the Catholic World declared, [...] "Not all the perfume of Arabia can wash {{the hand of}} Turkey clean enough to be suffered any longer to hold the reins of power over one inch of Christian territory." [...] The rest of the American press called for action to help the Armenians and to remove, [...] "if not by political action than by resort to the knife... the fever spot of the Turkish Empire." [...] King Leopold II of Belgium told British Prime Minister Salisbury that {{he was prepared to}} send his Congolese Force Publique to [...] "invade and occupy" [...] Armenia. The massacres were an important item on the agenda of the United States President Grover Cleveland, and in his presidential platform for 1896, Republican candidate William McKinley listed the saving of the Armenians as one of his top priorities in foreign policy. Americans in the Ottoman Empire, such as George Washburn, then-president of the Constantinople-based Robert College, pressured their government to take concrete action. In December 1900, the USS Kentucky called at the port of Smyrna, where its captain, [...] "Red Bill" [...] Kirkland, delivered the following warning, somewhat softened by his translator, to its governor: [...] "If these massacres continue I'll be swuzzled if I won't someday forget my order… <b>and</b> <b>find</b> <b>some</b> pretext to hammer a few Turkish towns… [...] I'd keel-haul every blithering mother's son of a Turk that wears hair." [...] Americans on the mainland, such as Julia Ward Howe, David Josiah Brewer, and John D. Rockefeller, donated and raised large amounts of money and organized relief aid that was channeled to the Armenians via the newly established American Red Cross. Other humanitarian groups and the Red Cross helped by sending aid to the remaining survivors who were dying of disease and hunger.|$|E
