[...] The coroner's report recommended that officials continue to investigate. Inspector Healey immediately detailed detectives {{to find out exactly}} what had happened. He told the Chicago Inter Ocean: [...] "I have forty detectives at work today on the theory that the criminals lived in the neighborhood of the Paroubek home. We are investigating every incident of the lives of the Paroubeks since they came to Chicago in order to trace a possible enemy. It will surprise me if the criminals are not arrested within a week." [...] To the Chicago Tribune he stated, [...] "We have one or two theories, but nothing specific enough to even talk about. I intend to place more men on the case tomorrow." [...] Lt. Costello returned to investigating the anonymous letters. Meanwhile, the New York Times reported Hoffman's and Paroubek's theory as fact.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was a dread moment," [...] she said, passing <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> brow; [...] "but it is past, and I am better. Mademoiselle Viefville will {{be obliged}} to you, also, for a little of this." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{took the}} note, and passing <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> eyes, {{as if to}} clear away some mist that {{obscured}} her vision, she read it. Then she considered the curt summons that gave no clue, and lastly looked at me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, you beast! Let me go!" [...] {{she screamed}} faintly. She {{was about to}} say more, but Yellow Elk clapped <b>a</b> dirty <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> mouth and silenced her.|$|R
60|$|On {{came the}} {{unconscious}} pair, until they almost trod on the prostrate men. Then, {{before they could}} imagine what had occurred, each found herself {{on the ground with}} <b>a</b> strong <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> mouth.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No. She {{has plenty}} of intelligence, and a certain sort of diligence, but does not work to a point. She wants <b>a</b> real <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her!</b> She will fail, {{and it will be}} very good for her.' ...|$|R
60|$|Again {{the only}} reply was the strangest of sounds. Almost {{it seemed as}} though a woman were trying to speak with <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> mouth. Then Bellamy {{suddenly}} stiffened into rigid attention. There were voices in the small reception room,--the voice of Henri, the butler, and another. Reluctantly he turned away from the closed door and walked swiftly down the passage. He entered the reception room and looked around him in amazement. It was still in disorder. Lassen sat in an easy-chair with a tumbler of brandy by his side. Henri was tying a bandage around his head, his collar was torn, there were marks of blood about his shirt. Bellamy's eyes sparkled. He closed the door behind him.|$|E
6000|$|A pause succeeded {{this little}} opening, {{during which the}} {{assembly}} {{was waiting for the}} arrival of Ursula Malbone, and the semi-savage guardian that [...] "set" [...] so much by her, as not to leave her out of sight for a moment. All that time Thousandacres was ruminating on his own plans; while old Andries was probably reflecting on the singular circumstances that [...] "wonters shoult pe so wonterful!" [...] At length a little bustle and movement occurred near the door, the crowd collected in it opened, and Dus walked into the centre of the room, her color heightened by excitement, but her step firm, and her air full of spirit. At first, the blazing light affected her sight, and she passed <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> eyes. Then looking around I met her gaze, and was rewarded for all my anxiety by one of those glances, into which affection knows how to infuse so much that is meaning and eloquent. I was thus favored for a moment only; those eyes still turning until they met the fond, answering look of Chainbearer. The old man had arisen, and he now received his niece in his arms, as a parent would embrace a beloved child.|$|E
5000|$|The fourth, however, {{resisted}} in the corridor. I {{heard her}} say “Pourquoi?” and I heard a voice as I recognized as the doctor who was in civilian clothes say “Pour typhus”. We then heard the noise of a struggle and the muffled cries of the woman. I assumed that someone held <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> mouth. I heard the woman being dragged away too. She was groaning louder than the others.|$|E
60|$|Mr Golding {{looked at}} her stupidly, not {{understanding}} her agitation. But they had reached the church. Miss Reed stopped in the porch to wipe her boots and pass <b>an</b> arranging <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> hair. Then, gathering herself together, {{she walked down the}} aisle to her pew.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{what does}} this mean?" [...] She swept <b>a</b> white <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> eyes and brows, as if to brush away some thing that {{obscured}} her vision. [...] "That is not mine. I never wrote it. How could you dream I should be imprudent as to bid you hither, and at such an hour How could you dream it?" ...|$|R
60|$|Licinia {{paused and}} passed <b>a</b> {{wrinkled}} <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> moist forehead. She was trembling even {{now at the}} recollection {{of what she had}} seen. The beautiful figure lying stretched out upon the couch had not moved in a single one of its graceful lines. The tiny head beneath its crown of gold was bent down upon the mirror.|$|R
5000|$|..... Just {{grab her}} arms and stop her calling out, no real rough stuff, no gangster stuff. We thought that just two guys telling her to come {{would be enough to}} make her think if she didn't come she might get hurt ... we talked about when she came into the room, one of us would be {{standing}} there and the other one would come up behind her and just quietly grab her by the arms and maybe put <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> mouth or a pillowslip over the head." ...|$|E
50|$|Two months later, Rachel and Darcy {{run into}} each other on the street. They have not spoken since the {{incident}} and Darcy says that she is happy, but doesn't sound so convincing. Darcy sees that Rachel has picked up one of Dex's shirts from the dry cleaner, Rachel is unapologetic for sleeping with Dex but is sorry for hurting Darcy. As they leave, they turn back and glance at each other, with Darcy smiling and waving. She reveals to Rachel that she is honestly happy as she puts <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> baby bump. Rachel walks around the corner to Dex sitting on a bench. They walk down the street together holding hands.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the night}} of their Mehendi ceremony, Anu spills juice on Devi's hand to ruin her bridal henna. Devi is distraught by Anu's behaviour. When Surya's family see the spoilr henna, they blame Devi for being reckless. Surya takes the blame and rectifies the mistake by drawing his namesake, the sun onto her palm with henna. Later that night, while her family are sleeping, Devi sits in her courtyard, pondering Anu's bizarre attitude. She hears a noise outside of her front door, so she goes outside to check. Someone {{abruptly}} places <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> mouth and drags her away. Devi struggles, but the man drags her to an empty grassland. Devi pulls the shawl of her kidnapper's head to reveal {{that it is only}} Surya.|$|E
60|$|Nell {{stretched}} <b>a</b> little trembling <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> uncle to Jim, who inclosed {{it in his}} own. Her {{eyes met}} his. Through her tears shone faintly a light, which, but for the agony that made it dim, would have beamed radiant.|$|R
60|$|In such sport {{the hours}} passed, till we were safely come to Tours, {{and so to}} their house in a street running off the great place, where the cathedral stands. It was a goodly dwelling, with fair carved-work on the beams, and in the doorway stood the old Scots kinswoman, smiling wide and toothless, to welcome us. Elliot kissed her quickly, and she fondled Elliot, and held <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> out <b>over</b> <b>her</b> {{shoulder}} to greet me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, that's {{the second}} class. They would be {{sure not to}} give you that," [...] said Amy, as if she thought the {{aspiration}} very high, not to say presumptuous. [...] "Perhaps Margaret Roller, the pupil-teacher, you know, may take that. Then I should have hers and you mine. They are dear little girls, some of them, only Susan Bray always wants <b>a</b> tight <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her,</b> Polly Smithers is so stupid, and Fanny Morris is so sly, one always {{has to be on}} the watch." ...|$|R
50|$|Seers' early {{fascination with}} {{photography}} {{led to a}} project of internalising the technology of the camera, in which she used her own body to produce photographs. The cavity of her mouth became the camera body and her lips became the camera aperture and shutter. This procedure entailed covering herself with a black lightproof sack, positioning {{a small piece of}} light-sensitive paper {{in the back of her}} mouth and then placing a gum-shield with a small pin-hole incision in front of it. In the moment of capture she closed her lips or placed <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> mouth to make the exposure before returning into the sack to develop the image. The resultant images from this project appear framed by her teeth, stained with saliva and tinged red by the blood within her cheeks.|$|E

5000|$|At left is Takashima Hisa, {{also called}} [...] "O-Hisa", from [...] in Ryōgoku. She was the eldest {{daughter}} of Takashima Chōbei, {{the owner of}} a roadside teahouse at his home called Senbeiya in which Hisa worked attracting customers. Tradition places her age at sixteen when the portrait was made, and there is a subtly discernible difference in maturity in the faces of the two teahouse girls. Hisa holds <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> towel <b>over</b> <b>her</b> left shoulder and an identifying three-leaved daimyo oak crest decorates her kimono.|$|R
6000|$|Presently his eye fell on {{something}} {{on which the}} light glittered as it hung from her neck. Just as he was looking <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> reached <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulder, there was a jerk, and a sudden cry from the child, then a boy dived into the crowd, {{and at the same}} moment George dashed after him. There was a cry of [...] "Stop, thief!" [...] and several <b>hands</b> made <b>a</b> grab at George as he dived through the crowd; but he slipped through them and was soon in the roadway.|$|R
50|$|Hime's {{cousin and}} {{successor}} of the Shirakami family, {{she has the}} ability to seal and control Ayakashi with <b>a</b> stamp <b>handed</b> <b>over</b> by <b>her</b> family, also she has a pair of short swords to fight Ayakashi, she believes that Ayakashi are evil and dangerous, but Yū shows her that not all Ayakashi are Evil, in the end she develops a crush on him.|$|R
60|$|They hid in {{the shadow}} {{at the side of}} the house until the girl had turned the corner and was {{approaching}} the veranda, then they ran quickly forward and as she mounted the steps she was seized from behind and dragged backward. <b>A</b> <b>hand</b> was clapped <b>over</b> <b>her</b> mouth and a whispered threat warned her to silence.|$|R
60|$|Woman can {{polarize}} her consciousness upwards. She {{can obtain}} <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> even <b>over</b> <b>her</b> sex receptivity. She can divert even the electric spasm of coition into her upper consciousness: {{it was the}} trick which the snake and the apple between them taught her. The snake, whose consciousness is only dynamic, and non-cerebral. The snake, who has no mental life, but only an intensely vivid dynamic mind, he envied the human race its mental consciousness. And he knew, this intensely wise snake, that the one way to make humanity pay more than the price of mental consciousness was to pervert woman into mentality: to stimulate her into the upper flow of consciousness.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{called out}} to {{her to come back}} to her work directly. She looked up at me, smiling in her bold impudent way, and said:--'Father has told me I may stop and learn what this gentleman is so kind as to teach me about my geraniums.' After that, I could say nothing more before the stranger: and when he was gone, and she came back triumphing, and laughing, and singing about the room, more like a mad play-actress than a decent young woman, I kept quiet and bore with her provocation. But I went down to my brother Joshua the same day, and talked to him seriously, and warned him that she ought to be kept stricter, and never let to have her own way, and offered to keep <b>a</b> strict <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> myself, if he would only support me properly. But he put me off with careless, jesting words, which he learned to repent of bitterly afterwards.|$|R
25|$|Pathologist Luca Lalli, from Perugia's {{forensic}} science institute, performed the autopsy on Kercher's body. Her injuries consisted of sixteen bruises and seven cuts. These included several bruises {{and a couple}} of insubstantial cuts on the palm of her hand. Bruises on her nose, nostrils, mouth, and underneath her jaw were compatible with <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> being clamped <b>over</b> <b>her</b> mouth and nose. Lalli's autopsy report was reviewed by three pathologists from Perugia's {{forensic science}} institute who interpreted the injuries, including some to the genital region, as indicating an attempt to immobilize Kercher during sexual violence.|$|R
6000|$|... "One {{night as}} I sailed homeward," [...] Antonio said, {{in a low}} tone, [...] "I heard strange cries from the castle. The night was still, and the breeze brought the sound to my ears. They came from up above, and when I {{strained}} my eyes I fancied that I could see a white figure--the figure of a woman--standing on the castle walls. She was crying for help, but suddenly, as though <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> were placed <b>over</b> <b>her</b> mouth, her cries ceased, and the figure vanished. It was three nights before the English lord died at the monastery!" ...|$|R
50|$|Cavanaugh (Kabanā) is a {{high-ranking}} {{member of the}} Syndicate and considered {{to be one of}} the most feared and cruel of them all. She at first appears to be an authoritative figure with the ability to hold <b>a</b> stern <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> peers, but she is sadistic, calculating, and controlling. She becomes increasingly sociopathic and violent as the story progresses, and her obsession with killing Mingchao and her companions escalates. She had found Baskerville after he'd lost his memory. After Blush took him and she discovered Baskerville could fire the Eto gun, she sought to bring him to her side. She used a concentrated form of a potent drug to convince Baskerville to do her bidding, though he defected after his memory returned. She loses her right eye in a train accident resulting from a gunfight between herself, Baskerville, and Mingchao's friends. Following the injury she swears revenge against them for scarring her face. She brands XII into her palm so she is able to use the Eto gun, though the brand later gets destroyed when her hand is scarred by a shot from the Zodiac gun. She is killed after falling from a high flight of stairs in a battle with Mingchao and her friends.|$|R
6000|$|Kezia {{was equal}} to the task. Having {{declared}} her intention of staying till the master could get about again, [...] "wage or no wage," [...] she had found a certain recompense in keeping <b>a</b> strong <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> mistress, scolding her for [...] "moithering" [...] herself, and going about all day without changing her cap, and looking {{as if she was}} [...] "mushed." [...] Altogether, this time of trouble was rather a Saturnalian time to Kezia; she could scold her betters with unreproved freedom. On this particular occasion there were drying clothes to be fetched in; she wished to know if one pair of hands could do everything in-doors and out, and observed that she should have thought {{it would be good for}} Mrs. Tulliver to put on her bonnet, and get a breath of fresh air by doing that needful piece of work. Poor Mrs. Tulliver went submissively downstairs; to be ordered about by a servant was the last remnant of her household dignities,--she would soon have no servant to scold her. Mr. Tulliver was resting in his chair a little after the fatigue of dressing, and Maggie and Tom were seated near him, when Luke entered to ask if he should help master downstairs.|$|R
60|$|It is charming then to see {{the girls}} urge one another to dance; each vows with much {{dramatic}} gesture that she cannot, calling the Blessed Virgin to witness that she has strained her ankle and has a shocking cold. But some youth springs up and volunteers, inviting a particular damsel to join him. She is pushed forward, and the couple take their places. The man carefully puts down his cigarette, jams his broad-brimmed hat on his head, buttons his short coat and arches his back! The spectators cry: 'Ole!' The girl passes <b>an</b> arranging <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> hair. The measure begins. The pair stand opposite one another, a yard or so distant, and foot it in accordance with one another's motions. It is not a thing of complicated steps, but, {{as one might expect}} from its Moorish origin, of movements of the body. With much graceful swaying from side to side the executants approach and retire, and at the middle of the dance change positions. It finishes with a great clapping of hands, the maiden sinks down among her friends and begins violently to fan herself, while her partner, with a great affectation of nonchalance, takes a seat and relights his cigarette.|$|R
6000|$|They {{seemed to}} be kind people, for they made room near their lamp for the little girl, and asked her {{where she had been}} wrecked. Then one of the women cut off a great lump of raw something--was it a walrus, with that round head and big tusks?--and held it up to her; and when Lucy shook her head and said, [...] "No, thank you," [...] as civilly as she could, the woman tore it in two, and <b>handed</b> <b>a</b> lump <b>over</b> <b>her</b> {{shoulder}} to her baby, who began to gnaw it. Then her first friend, the little boy, hoping to please her better, offered her some drink. Ah! it was oil, just like the oil that was burning in the lamp!--horrid oil from the whales! She could not help shaking her head; and so much that she woke herself up! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{shows her}} perfect faith in you, Mr. Wyatt. A {{child who has}} {{absolute}} confidence in the person in whose charge she is, is almost without fear. Her idea of danger is derived almost entirely from the conduct of those around her. If they show fear, she is terrified; while if their manner convinces her {{that they have no}} fear, she does not understand that danger can exist. She is evidently deeply attached to you, as indeed she has reason to be, and when I get tired with talking to her, and say to her, 'Now you must go, dear,' she trots off as contentedly to you as if you were indeed what she calls you, her nurse, much more so than she used to do to Claire. The poor woman was a most careful nurse and an excellent instructress, although she did start so madly, as it would seem, on this journey. But the child never really took to her, as she had not the faculty of winning affection. She was thoroughly trustworthy, and would, I believe, have given her life for the child, but she was certainly rather precise in manner, and was perhaps a little too peremptory in giving her orders. That was, I admit, a fault on the right side, for Stephanie is so accustomed to adulation {{on the part of the}} servants, that she rather needs <b>a</b> firm <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her.</b> However, the child has scarcely mentioned Claire's name since her return, while yours is incessantly on her lips." ...|$|R
6000|$|For {{the next}} few months I saw much of Le Geyt; and the more I saw of him, the more I saw that my witch's {{prognosis}} was essentially correct. They never quarrelled; but Mrs. Le Geyt, in her unobtrusive way, held <b>a</b> quiet <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> husband which became increasingly apparent. In the midst of her fancy-work (those busy fingers were never idle) she kept her eyes well fixed on him. Now and again I saw him glance at his motherless girls with what looked like a tender, protecting regret; especially when [...] "Clara" [...] had been most openly drilling them; but he dared not interfere. She was crushing their spirit, as she was crushing their father's--and all, bear in mind, for the best of motives! She had their interest at heart; she wanted to do what was right for them. Her manner to him and to them was always honey-sweet--in all externals; yet one could somehow feel it was the velvet glove that masked the iron hand; not cruel, not harsh even, but severely, irresistibly, unflinchingly crushing. [...] "Ettie, my dear, get your brown hat at once. What's that? Going to rain? I did not ask you, my child, for YOUR opinion on the weather. My own suffices. A headache? Oh, nonsense! Headaches are caused by want of exercise. Nothing so good for a touch of headache as a nice brisk walk in Kensington Gardens. Maisie, don't hold your sister's hand like that; it is imitation sympathy! You are aiding and abetting her in setting my wishes at naught. Now, no long faces! What I require is CHEERFUL obedience." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{know nothing}} of that, said I, but I am sure there never was but one spot of Ground in that World which I came from, that was divided like them, and that's that very Country I liv'd in. Here are three Kingdoms of you in one spot, said I, One has already been Conquer'd and Subdu'd, the t'other suppres'd its Native lnhabitants, and planted it with her own, and now carries it with so high <b>a</b> <b>Hand</b> <b>over</b> them of <b>her</b> own Breed, that she limits their Trade, stops their Ports, when the Inhabitants have made their Manufactures, these wont give them leave to send them abroad, impose Laws upon them, refuse to alter and amend those they would make for themselves, make them pay Customs, Excises, and Taxes, and yet pay the Garrisons and Guards that defend them, themselves; Press their Inhabitants to their Fleets, and carry away their Old Veteran Troops that should defend them, and leave them to raise more to be serv'd in the same manner, will let none of their Mony be carry'd over thither, nor let them Coin any of their own; and a great many such hardships they suffer under the Hand of this Nation as meer Slaves and Conquer'd People, tho' the {{greatest}} part of the Traders are the People of the very Nation that treats 'em thus.|$|R
60|$|The eye of Narra-mattah {{seemed in}} doubt; still it {{regarded}} Whittal with its accustomed look of kindness. The innocent, full of his imaginary glory, {{raised his hand}} in exultation, and by gestures that could not easily be misunderstood, he indicated {{the manner in which}} he intended to rob his victims of the usual trophy. While the youth was enacting the disgusting but expressive pantomime, Ruth watched the countenance of her child in nearly breathless agony. She would have been relieved by a single glance of disapprobation, by a solitary movement of a rebellious muscle, or by the smallest sign that the tender nature of one so lovely, and otherwise so gentle, revolted at so unequivocal evidence of the barbarous practices of her adopted people. But no Empress of Rome could have witnessed the dying agonies of the hapless gladiator, no consort of a more modern prince could read the bloody list of the victims of her husband's triumph, nor any betrothed fair listen to the murderous deeds of him her imagination had painted as a hero, with less indifference to human suffering, than that with which the wife of the Sachem of the Narragansetts looked on the mimic representation of those exploits which had purchased for her husband a renown so highly prized. It was but too apparent that the representation, rude and savage as it was, conveyed to her mind nothing but pictures in which the chosen companion of a warrior should rejoice. The varying features and answering eye too plainly proclaimed the sympathy of one taught to exult in the success of the combatant; and when Whittal, excited by his own exertions, broke out into an exhibition of a violence more ruthless even than common, he was openly rewarded by another laugh. The soft, exquisitely feminine tones of this involuntary burst of pleasure, sounded in the ears of Ruth like a knell over the moral beauty of her child. Still subduing her feelings, she passed <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> thoughtfully <b>over</b> <b>her</b> own pallid brow, and appeared to muse long on the desolation of a mind that had once promised to be so pure.|$|R
