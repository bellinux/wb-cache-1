5|$|The {{great number}} of Russian horses {{captured}} as matériel during wartime became {{a threat to the}} Finnhorse's purebreeding: many Russian animals were stallions, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> to ensure new owners would not crossbreed them with Finnhorses. For practical and political reasons, Soviet Russia would not accept these horses back as a part of Finland's massive war indemnity. Finnhorses however, were accepted as payment, and a total of 18000 animals were sold to Soviet Russia at low rates in 1947 and 1948. The best Finnhorses were not offered to the Soviets, however, and according to contemporary witnesses, many showy but otherwise useless horses ended up in Russia.|$|E
5|$|Homing on the enemy's {{broadcasts}} {{meant that}} there was no accurate way to calculate the range to the target; radar ranging measurements are based on timing the delay between broadcast and reception, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> to know when the enemy's signal was originally broadcast. This meant that the homing device could only be used for the initial tracking, and the final approach would have to be carried out by radar. The extra range of the Mk. VIII was not required in this role as Serrate would bring the fighter within easy tracking range, and the loss of a Mk. IV would not reveal the secret of the magnetron to the Germans. For this reason, the Mk. IV was considered superior to the newer radars for this role, in spite of any technical advantages of the newer designs.|$|E
5|$|On September 22, 2011, Dugard {{filed suit}} in US District Court for the Northern District of California accusing the United States of failing to monitor Phillip {{when he was a}} federal parolee. Dugard alleged in her lawsuit against the federal {{government}} that parole officials should have returned Garrido to prison for any number of parole violations that preceded her abduction, including testing positive for drugs and alcohol. Her lawsuit was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on March 15, 2016. The court ruled in a 2–1 decision that Dugard had not been victimized by Garrido {{at the time he was}} placed under federal parole supervision, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> to anticipate she would become his victim. As a result, federal authorities in California had no duty to protect her or other members of the general public from him. In a dissenting opinion, Chief District Court Judge William Smith said the majority had improperly analyzed Dugard's case, and said there was good reason to hold the government liable.|$|E

The plan relied on the driver from the north catching Seppala on the trail. Summers arranged for drivers along the last leg, including Seppala's colleague Gunnar Kaasen.|$|E
25|$|Outstanding {{figures of}} 10-6-10-4 from Bermuda's T Burgess kept Israel's total {{down to a}} measly 86, and Winston Reid plundered 63 not out as the Bermudians raced to their target in under 14 overs {{for the loss of}} just one wicket. Paul Prashad hit an unbeaten 164 for Canada {{as they made their way}} to 356/6, ably {{supported}} by D Singh (65). Papua New Guinea showed fight in their response, Karo Ao (67) and Taunao Vai (51) compiling an opening stand of 126, but then F Waithe (4-37) reduced them to 133/4 <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> back; Derick Etwaroo took 4-64 and PNG ended on 267/9. Future Woking F.C. FA Cup hero Tim Buzaglo made 88 for Gibraltar as they reached 185/8, but 55 from E Vakausausa made sure of victory for Fiji (187/4). And Bakker took 5-20 as the USA slid to 88 all out and a ten-wicket loss to the Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|Kormoran was stationary, and at 18:25, Detmers {{ordered the}} ship to be abandoned, as damage to the raider's engine room had knocked out the {{fire-fighting}} systems, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> to control or contain the oil fire before it reached the magazines or the mine hold. All boats and liferafts were launched by 21:00, and all but one filled: a skeleton crew manned the weapons while the officers prepared to scuttle the ship. Kormoran was abandoned at midnight; the ship sank slowly until the mine hold exploded 30 minutes later. The German survivors were in five boats and two rafts: one cutter carrying 46 men, two damaged steel liferafts with 57 and 62 aboard (the latter carrying Detmers and towing several small floats), one workboat carrying 72 people, one boat with 31 men aboard, and two rafts, each bearing 26 sailors. During the evacuation, a rubber liferaft carrying 60 people, mostly wounded, sank without warning; drowning all but three aboard. Total German casualties were six officers, 75 German sailors, and one Chinese laundryman.|$|E

A long chain was tied between Phoenix on the northern track, and the three remaining carriages of the Duke's train on the southern track. At 1.30pm Phoenix and its train were then attached to North Star and its train and the two locomotives set out at low speed towards Manchester, passing Eccles and heading into the deserted marshland of Chat Moss.|$|E

500|$|Among the {{experimental}} songs that Revolver featured was [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows", the lyrics for which Lennon drew from Timothy Leary's [...] Its creation involved eight tape decks distributed about the EMI building, each staffed by an engineer or band member, who randomly varied {{the movement of}} a tape loop while Martin created a composite recording by sampling the incoming data. McCartney's [...] "Eleanor Rigby" [...] made prominent use of a string octet; Gould describes it as [...] "a true hybrid, conforming to no recognisable style or genre of song". Harrison was developing as a songwriter, and three of his compositions earned {{a place on the}} record. In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked Revolver as the third greatest album of all time. During the US tour that followed its release, however, the band performed none of its songs. As Chris Ingham writes, they were very much [...] "studio creations... <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> a four-piece rock 'n' roll group could do them justice, particularly through the desensitising wall of the fans' screams. 'Live Beatles' and 'Studio Beatles' had become entirely different beasts." [...] The band's final concert at San Francisco's Candlestick Park on 29 August was their last commercial concert. It marked the end of a four-year period dominated by almost nonstop touring that included over 1,400 concert appearances internationally.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} stages of the album's development, it was {{promoted}} as an album of [...] "high-energy hip-hop." [...] Republic Records later described the album's musical style as [...] "aggressive rock" [...] in the stages preceding the album's release. Vanilla Ice referred to the album's musical style as [...] "skate rock." [...] The album's dark and thick sound fuses elements of heavy metal, punk rock and hip hop. Vanilla Ice stated that [...] "I wanted to express myself in a very intense way, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> it was going to happen with a drum machine. Basically, I'm bored with drum machines and samples and stuff. With a band, they can build the energy around me." [...] Many critics have noticed a similarity between the style of music present on Hard to Swallow and that of bands such as Korn and Limp Bizkit. Vanilla Ice stated that although he knew of the bands, he [...] "didn't even listen to [...] any of them" [...] before he made the album, and he was not trying to imitate the musical style of the bands. [...] "It's just we have the same producer, and some of the guitars between that and Limp Bizkit are gonna sound similar. That's what happens when you've got the same guy producing them. [...] I had heard the Deftones more than any of them." ...|$|E
500|$|The Historical Enquiries Team (HET), {{which was}} set up to {{investigate}} the more controversial Troubles-related deaths, released its report on the Miami Showband killings to the victims' families in December 2011. The findings noted in the report confirmed Mid-Ulster UVF leader Robin Jackson's involvement and identified him as an RUC Special Branch agent. According to the report, Jackson had claimed during police interrogations that after the shootings, a senior RUC officer had advised him to [...] "lie low". Although this information was passed on to RUC headquarters, nothing was done about it. In a police statement made following his arrest for possession of the silencer and Luger on 31 May 1976, Jackson maintained that a week before he was taken into custody, two RUC officers had tipped him off about the discovery of his fingerprints on the silencer; he also claimed they had forewarned him: [...] "I should clear as there was a wee job up the country that I would be done for <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> out of it for me". Although ballistic testing had linked the Luger (for which the silencer had been specifically made) to the Miami Showband attack, Jackson was never questioned about the killings after his fingerprints had been discovered on the silencer, and the Miami inquiry team were never informed about these developments.|$|E

2500|$|Along with Beatles bandmate John Lennon {{and their}} wives, George Harrison first took the hallucinogenic drug Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in April 1965, when a dentist friend {{slipped it into}} their after-dinner coffee. The {{heightened}} perception induced by the hallucinogen inspired both musicians in their subsequent work with the Beatles, notably on the albums Revolver (1966) and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), and led directly to a shared interest in Eastern philosophical concepts and meditation. Harrison later said of the profound change he felt {{as a result of}} first taking the drug: [...] "I had such an overwhelming feeling of well-being, that there was a God, and I could see him in every blade of grass. It was like gaining hundreds of years of experience within twelve hours. It changed me, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> back to what I was before." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a visit made {{sometime}} before the attack, Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), the professional {{head of the}} British Army, had told Lieutenant General Sir Evelyn Barker, the General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the British Forces in Palestine and Trans-Jordan, to emphasise to the British servicemen that they were [...] "facing a cruel, fanatical and cunning enemy, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> of knowing who was friend and who foe." [...] Since there were female terrorists as well, according to Montgomery, all fraternising with the local population would have to cease. Within {{a few minutes of}} the bombing, Barker translated this instruction into an order that [...] "all Jewish places of entertainment, cafes, restaurants, shops and private dwellings" [...] be out of bounds to all ranks. He concluded, [...] "I appreciate that these measures will inflict some hardship on the troops, but I am certain that if my reasons are fully explained to them, they will understand their propriety and they will be punishing the Jews in a way the race dislikes as much as any, by striking at their pockets and showing our contempt of them." [...] His wording was interpreted as antisemitic and caused much outrage. The order was rescinded two weeks later.|$|E
2500|$|This tournament {{was always}} going to {{struggle}} {{to live up to the}} overwhelming response that greeted the previous event in Bangladesh.
