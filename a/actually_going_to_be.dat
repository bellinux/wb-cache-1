500|$|In March 2013, {{researchers}} {{published the}} DNA {{sequence of the}} genome of a strain of HeLa cells. The Lacks family discovered this when the author Rebecca Skloot informed them. There were objections from the Lacks family about the genetic information that was available for public access. [...] Jeri Lacks Whye, a grandchild of Henrietta Lacks, said to The New York Times, [...] "the biggest concern was privacy - what information was <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> out there about our grandmother, and what information they can obtain from her sequencing that will tell them about her children and grandchildren and going down the line". [...] That same year another group working on a different HeLa cell line's genome under NIH funding submitted it for publication. In August 2013, an agreement was announced between {{the family and the}} National Institutes of Health that gave the family some control over access to the cells' DNA sequence found in the two studies along with a promise of acknowledgement in scientific papers. In addition, two family members will join the six-member committee which will regulate access to the sequence data.|$|E

5000|$|Hubert Gough breakfasted with Wilson on 23 March, {{before his}} meeting with French and Ewart at the War Office, where he demanded a written {{guarantee}} that the Army would not be used against Ulster. Wilson was also present at the 4pm meeting at which Gough, on his advice, insisted on amending a Cabinet document to clarify that the Army would not <b>be</b> used <b>to</b> enforce Home Rule on Ulster, to which French also agreed in writing. Wilson then left, telling people in the War Office that the Army had done what the Opposition had failed to do (i.e. prevent the coercion of Ulster). Wilson told French that he suspected he (French) would be sacked by the Government, in which case [...] "the Army would go solid with him". To his brother’s amusement, Johnnie Gough “hotted” (teased) Wilson by affecting {{to believe that he}} <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> resign.Wilson <b>was</b> worried that a future Dublin government might issue “lawful orders” to coerce Ulster. At the top of his diary page for 23 March he wrote: “We soldiers beat Asquith & his vile tricks”.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{the game}} was not present at Microsoft's E3 press {{briefing}} the following year. Further confusion arose later in the month with a statement by Microsoft's Aaron Greenberg stating that {{the game was}} not a product they <b>were</b> planning <b>to</b> bring <b>to</b> market, but <b>was</b> more of an internal tech demo. This was later refuted by Molyneux who stated that he would reveal a more advanced version of Milo during his TEDGlobal talk in Oxford in July 2010. Molyneux went on to hint at difficulties in getting Microsoft to see Milo as a full game. Molyneux said [...] "The biggest challenge for us is convincing people (Microsoft) what we're doing <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> work, <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> reach a new audience, <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an idea that people love." [...] At the TED conference in Oxford in July 2010, more footage was shown. Players can make crucial decisions in Milo's life, or smaller ones such as squashing a snail or not. During the conference it was shown that Milo can <b>be</b> taught how <b>to</b> skip stones. The demonstration also indicated that users <b>are</b> only able <b>to</b> talk to Milo when a red microphone image appeared on the screen.|$|R

2500|$|Parker's {{father always}} warned him about {{getting into the}} music industry. [...] "My dad always warned me not to choose music as a career. He got quite worried and said [...] "if you do music as your job, as the thing that puts food on the table, then it will {{instantly}} ruin its magic, it won't be mysterious and fun any more, {{it would just be}} like work"." [...] Parker believed what his father had told him, and went on to university for a while, studying engineering. [...] "I wanted to please my dad in a way. I had no idea what I wanted to do, because I didn't enjoy anything other than music." [...] Parker said [...] "I hated it, and one day I decided to change to astronomy. I knew that I would be poor and I just wanted to do whatever was fun." [...] It was here in an astronomy lecture that Parker saw a slide that he would later paint and turn into the artwork for the Tame Impala EP. However, Parker couldn't give up his original dream. [...] "I was at uni, and a couple of months before we got signed, I had submitted to the reality that I wasn't <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a famous musician and I should just get on with my career. So that was when I started to knuckle down and actually do stuff at uni. But at the same time, I could never passionately give my attention to anything other than music. Like, it was a disease. I {{would not be able to}} listen to a word in lectures because I'd just be thinking about my new song." ...|$|E
2500|$|At 6:28a.m., {{two minutes}} {{ahead of the}} time set as H-Hour, Schroeder's unit {{was in the first}} wave of 20LCVPs to {{disembark}} on Utah Beach. Schroeder's own assault boat, commanded by navy Lieutenant (j.g.) Abraham Condiotti of Brooklyn, New York, was the first to hit the beach. In his boat were 32men, including Brigadier General Roosevelt. He recalled to a television interviewer in 2008 that [...] "80percent of the guys on the boat were sick" [...] due to the rough seas and, as his landing craft in the first wave neared the shore, Allied forces were still shelling Company F's designated landing site on Utah Beach. [...] "They were dropping all those bombs on the place where we were going in" [...] and his company had to disembark [...] "without getting bombed by our own guys". [...] He held his [...]45-caliber pistol above the waist-high water as he waded the final [...] from his landing craft to the beach. In the lead landing craft, he covered the remaining distance as quickly as possible due to enemy fire. The soldiers encountered machine gun fire from German pillboxes and artillery shelling, underwater mines, barbed wire, and trenches. His company's mission was to break up the enemy's fortified seawall and then liberate a village five miles inland. Half of his men were casualties and Schroeder himself was shot twice in the left arm. He was hospitalized in England and later in South Carolina and almost had his arm amputated due to the severity of his wounds. [...] Asked later if {{he knew that he was}} the first soldier on the beach, he said, [...] "I knew my company was in the first wave, but I didn't know I was <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the first ashore. [...] Besides, I was too scared to think about it". Afterwards, he was hailed in a Pentagon press release as [...] "the first GI to invade Europe". The Baltimore Sun said of Schroeder afterwards, [...] "when his boot touched French soil, it was a great moment in history". He earned a Silver Star, Bronze Star, and Purple Heart during World War II, in addition to numerous other decorations.|$|E
5000|$|During the race, the UCI {{checked the}} {{bicycles}} of Van den Driessche {{and found a}} motor in a bicycle that was in her pit. Almost six years since the first allegations of [...] "mechanical doping" [...] in cycling, {{this was the first}} time in cycling history that evidence of technological fraud had been found. The UCI had been testing a new detection system. The offence carries a minimum six-month suspension and a fine of between SFr20,000 and 200,000. Van den Driessche denies she intended to cheat, and maintains that the bicycle was owned by a friend and <b>was</b> taken <b>to</b> the pit in error. In the days following the incident, the friend who was claimed by Van den Driessche, Nico Van Muylder, said to Het Nieuwsblad that the bike was his. However, UCI technical regulation 12.1.013, bars the presence of motors on the bike, regardless of intent or whether the bike <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> used, <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used or even belonged to anyone on the team. Riders are responsible under strict liability.|$|R

[...] Fry stepped down from his Board position in January 2016, to take up a new position as [...] "Norwich City Ambassador". Fry said, [...] "My five years in the role have been an honour and a privilege beyond almost anything I can remember. I wish I could take credit for ushering the club up from League One to the Premiership during that time on the Board. <b>Actually,</b> I’m <b>going</b> <b>to.</b> It <b>was</b> all me. It can’t have been a coincidence ... But now I’m so happy to relinquish my seat on the board to Thomas Smith and to engage as fully as I can in the role of ambassador for Norwich City. We have so much <b>to</b> <b>be</b> proud of, both on and off the pitch, and I hope to welcome many new fans to the greatest club of all. On the Ball, City!"

Here I am, then, the conclusion is drafted, the table of contents written, and I am just starting my acknowledgements. This time, though, it is because I viewed writing my acknowledgments as the reward for finishing the body of my dissertation. So, here goes, although it <b>is</b> difficult <b>to</b> decide where to begin. So I shall begin with my wonderful committee – Kathryn, Joanne, Paul, and Chris – who stuck with me not just through multiple iterations of each and every chapter, but a few blind fumblings in the beginning as <b>to</b> what I <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> study. I <b>am</b> a dilettante by birth, which makes for fine dinner party conversation, but does not lend itself to focused study. Particular thanks to Kathryn, who, early on, helped me even coherently realize what my research interests are, but who continued to give me the latitude to think broadly about my interests, as it is this unfocused thinking that seems <b>to</b> keep me <b>going.</b> I really cannot say enough about my advisers. Both Joanne and Kathryn pushed me to make this better, both by giving me ideas to improve but giving me leeway to make it my own. While I know this final product is not perfect, it is because of them that I can be proud of it. Besides their professional guidance, though, they have shown me you can be an excellent scholar as well as a remarkable human being. A lesson, actually, that many in my department have shown me.

60|$|He was a tall, {{fine young}} man enough, with black hair, which grew very long, and the biggest, bushiest {{pair of black}} {{whiskers}} I ever saw. Altogether he had a rakish, unsettled look, and a bounceable way of talking which made him the prominent person in company. He was poor enough himself, as I heard from his servant, but well connected--a gentleman by birth and education, though his manners were so free. What my mistress saw to like in him I don't know; but when she asked her friends {{to stay with her}} at Darrock, she included Mr. James Smith in the invitation. We had a fine, gay, noisy time of it at the Hall, the strange gentleman, in particular, making himself as much at home as if the place belonged to him. I was surprised at Mrs. Norcross putting up with him as she did, but I was fairly thunderstruck some months afterward when I heard that she and her free-and-easy visitor were <b>actually</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> married! She had refused offers by dozens abroad, from higher, and richer, and better-behaved men.
