40|$|It is well {{established}} that light carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) {{can be used to}} induce a mechanical torque causing an object to spin. We consider the complementary scenario: will an observer spinning relative to the beam <b>axis</b> <b>measure</b> a change in OAM {{as a result of their}} rotational velocity? Remarkably, although a linear Doppler shift changes the linear momentum of a photon, the angular Doppler shift induces no change in the angular momentum. Further, we examine the rotational Doppler shift in frequency imparted to the incident light due to the relative motion of the beam with respect to the observer and consider what must happen to the measured wavelength if the speed of light c is to remain constant. We show specifically that the OAM of the incident beam is not affected by the rotating observer and that the measured wavelength is shifted by a factor equal and opposite to that of the frequency shift induced by the rotational Doppler effect...|$|E

40|$|The {{number of}} steps per time period is an {{important}} ambulatory measure describing an individual's locomotor function with implications for psychological and physical health. Key applications in neurology, psychiatry, psychopharmacology, and sports, behavior or rehabilitation medicine make it desirable to improve step detecting devices. Several pedometer or wrist actigraphy monitors exist today, but are insensitive or confounded by movement style, which may vary for different diagnoses and applications. Presented is an algorithm that detects, classifies and counts steps related to walking, running and shuffling motion. Data is recorded using a novel ambulatory monitoring system (LifeShirt, VivoMetrics, Inc., Ventura, CA, USA) which captures breathing information from respiratory inductive plethysmography (RIP) sensors embedded in a light garment, and acceleration signals from a dual axis accelerometer attached close {{to the center of}} body mass. The vertical accelerometer <b>axis</b> <b>measures</b> upward acceleration generated by walking and running, while the other <b>axis</b> <b>measures</b> movement common with shuffling gait. Since these signals often contain noise and artifact due to soft tissue movement or external vibrations they are filtered and autocorrelated using unbiased estimates. The autocorrelation coefficients allow for clearer detection and classification of the cyclic motion during walking, running and shuffling movements. The algorithm is tested during various levels of exercise in healthy individuals and patients suffering from Parkinson disease, which is often characterized by shuffling gait. The results demonstrate an effective locomotor-monitoring algorithm that can produce accurate estimates of frequency and intensity of steps and shuffles and help classify daily locomotor activities...|$|R

40|$|Context: Stress is {{suggested}} {{to lead to}} metabolic dysregulations as clustered in the metabolic syndrome, but the underlying biological mechanisms are not yet well understood. Objective: We {{examined the relationship between}} two main str systems, the autonomic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal (HPA) axis, with the metabolic syndrome and its components. Design:Thedesignwasbaseline data (yr 2004 - 2007) of a prospective cohort: the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). Setting: The study comprised general community, primary care,andspecialized mental health care. Participants: This study included 1883 participants aged 18 - 65 yr. Main Outcome Measures: Autonomic nervous system measures included heart rate, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA; high RSA reflecting high parasympathetic activity), and preejection period (PEP; high PEP reflecting low sympathetic activity). HPA <b>axis</b> <b>measures</b> included the cortisol awakening response, evening cortisol, and a 0. 5 mg dexamethasone suppression test as measured in saliva. Metabolic syndrome was based on the updated Adult Treatment Panel III criteria and included high waist circumference, serum triglycerides, blood pressure, serum glucose, and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Results: RSA and PEP were both independently negatively associated with the presence of the metabolic syndrome, the number of metabolic dysregulations as well as all individual components except high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (all P < 0. 02). Heart rate was positively related to the metabolic syndrome, the number of metabolic dysregulations, and all individual components (all P < 0. 001). HPA <b>axis</b> <b>measures</b> were not related to metabolic syndrome or its components. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that increased sympathetic and decreased parasympathetic nervous system activity is associated with metabolic syndrome, whereas HPA axis activity is not.
