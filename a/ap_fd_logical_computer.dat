40|$|Test case {{prioritization}} techniques schedule {{test cases}} for regression testing in {{an order that}} increases their ability to meet some performance goal. One performance goal, rate of fault detection, measures how quickly faults are detected within the testing process. Previous work has provided a metric, <b>AP</b> <b>F</b> D, for measuring rate of fault detection, and techniques for prioritizing test cases {{in order to improve}} <b>AP</b> <b>F</b> D. This metric and these techniques, however, assume that all test case and fault costs are uniform. In practice, test case and fault costs can vary, and in such cases the previous <b>AP</b> <b>F</b> D metric and techniques designed to improve <b>AP</b> <b>F</b> D can be unsatisfactory. This paper presents a new metric for assessing the rate of fault detection of prioritized test cases, <b>AP</b> <b>F</b> DC, that incorporates varying test case and fault costs. The paper also describes adjustments to previous prioritization techniques that allow them, too, to be “cognizant ” of these varying costs. These techniques enable practitioners to perform a new type of prioritization: cost-cognizant test case prioritization. Finally, the results of a formative case study are presented. This study was designed to investigate the cost-cognizant metric and techniques and how they compare to their non-cost-cognizant counterparts. The study’s results provide insights regarding the use of cost-cognizant test case prioritization in a variety of real-world settings...|$|R

An inscription of ownership on an expensive Egyptian alabaster vase once owned by the son has survived to attest the latter's short official career, and includes an unusual triple filiation which confirms the literary evidence {{to the effect that}} Clodius' own filiation was: <b>Ap.</b> <b>f.</b> <b>Ap.</b> n.

40|$|A {{method of}} error {{detection}} is proposed for noisy <b>logical</b> <b>computer</b> elements.

40|$|A simple scanning-type binary <b>logical</b> <b>computer</b> starts by {{assigning}} the truth-value 0 {{to all the}} variables (propositions) and systematically executes a binary count until the truth value 1 is assigned to all variables. With n variables a scan of 2 n steps is then needed. At each step, all the logical constraints usually are tested simultaneously and only when all are satisfied is {{a solution to the}} problem obtained. The principle, and the machine, described here give a greatly compressed procedure; they are such that the constraints are examined individually, not simultaneously; if one or more is unsatisfied, a simple criterion is acted upon which greatly reduces the total number of steps required to find the first solution or any number of solutions. A further criterion is established when the last solution has been found, and the machine may be stopped. It is thought that this short-cut procedure may be of value to scanning-type <b>logical</b> <b>computers</b> for working with large numbers of variables...|$|R
