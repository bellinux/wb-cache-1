50|$|Woodboring beetles {{most often}} attack dying or dead trees. In forest settings, they are {{important}} in the turnover of trees by culling weak trees, thus allowing new growth to occur. They are also important as primary decomposers of trees within forest systems, allowing for the recycling of nutrients locked away in the relatively decay-resilient woody material of trees. To develop and reach maturity woodboring beetles need nutrients provided by fungi from outside of the inhabited wood. These nutrients are not only assimilated into the beetles' bodies but also are concentrated in their frass, contributing to soil nutrients cycles. Though {{the vast majority of}} woodboring beetles are ecologically important and economically benign, some species can become economic pests by attacking relatively healthy trees (e.g. <b>Asian</b> <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetle,</b> emerald ash borer) or by infesting downed trees in lumber yards. Species such as the <b>Asian</b> <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetle</b> and the emerald ash borer are examples of invasive species that threaten natural forest ecosystems.|$|E

30|$|X-ray {{computed}} tomography (CT), {{which allows for}} the non-destructive analysis of the 3 D-density distribution of an object, has been widely applied to assess the internal structures or defects of wood. X-ray CT has also been used to detect termite or beetle damage in wood [6 – 10]. For example, X-ray CT was used to visualize the gallery system of two drywood termite species, Cryptotermes secundus [6] and Incisitermes minor [7], and the oak platypodid beetle Platypus quercivorus [8] developed in wood. It was also used to image {{the bodies of the}} <b>Asian</b> <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetle</b> Anophophora glabripennis [9] and the anobiid beetle Priobium cylindricum [10] in wood.

40|$|Azadirachtins {{are natural}} triterpenoid {{compounds}} derived from Neem tree extracts with potential {{for use as}} systemic insecticides against invasive wood-boring insect pests. In this work, a sensitive and selective analytical method has been developed for the simultaneous determination of azadirachtin A and azadirachtin B (3 -tigloylazadirachtol) in foliage and twigs of various tree species. Samples were mixed with C 18 and primary-secondary amine (PSA), and extracted with acetonitrile. Then, an aliquot of the raw extract was 10 -fold diluted with water and directly analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The method was validated in foliage and twig matrices of four different tree species (London Plane Tree, Red/Freemani Maple, Norway Maple and Sugar Maple) that are known hosts of the exotic invasive insect pest – <b>Asian</b> <b>Longhorn</b> <b>Beetle</b> (ALB). Analytical results for replicate (N = 5) samples, fortified at 0. 01, 0. 1 and 1 mg kg, showed good recoveries (86 – 119 %) and precision (< 20 % RSD).

30|$|If HCN is {{produced}} during fumigation by the decomposition of EDN as hypothesised (Brash et al. 2013), then this process may either positively or negatively affect {{the efficacy of}} EDN as a fumigant. Hydrogen cyanide is also toxic and could, therefore, have insecticidal activity that may either supplement or interfere with the effectiveness of EDN. For example, the CT (concentration × time) value of HCN required to kill larvae of the <b>Asian</b> <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetle</b> (Anoplophora glabripennis) is 17.67  g h m−[*] 3 at fumigation temperatures of 23 – 24  °C (Stejskal et al. 2014), while the CT value of EDN required to kill larvae of Arhopalus ferus is 19.50  g h m−[*] 3 at 20  °C (Najar-Rodriguez et al. 2015). Thus, determining the toxicity of both these chemicals to various insects and assessing {{whether or not their}} concentrations change in the treated space over time are important factors in understanding the efficacy of EDN as a fumigant. The current study focused on the second of these factors. The concentrations of both EDN and HCN were measured during simulated fumigations to determine if a significant proportion of HCN {{is produced}} as a breakdown product of EDN when used to treat recently harvested pine logs with a high moisture content.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Asian</b> <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetle</b> Anoplophora glabripennis {{is highly}} {{polyphagous}} and widely spread over regions with different climates. Determining the key life-history traits {{is important for}} understanding how local conditions affect its successful establishment and to develop adaptive management strategies. Field and laboratory studies were conducted from 2010 to 2012 on an A. glabripennis infestation in Northern Italy, aiming to determine its seasonal phenology, adult beetle longevity, density of successful emergence, infestation age and overwintering life history. Adult beetle emerged from infested trees from 22 May to 28 June. Ninety percent of emergence was reached around 20 July. The first 1 % of emergence was accurately predicted by an accumulated degree-day model. In the laboratory, the mean longevity {{of males and females}} developed under natural conditions was 27. 8 ± 1. 7 and 24. 9 ± 1. 8 days, respectively. In northern Italy, A. glabripennis largely overwinter as mature larvae in the xylem. The mean density of exit holes was 24. 0 ± 2. 7 holes/m 2 of bark, with successful emergence from branches as small as 3. 2 cm in diameter. Although the infestation was discovered in June 2009, the oldest exit hole found in infested trees dated from 2005. © 2014 The Royal Entomological Society...|$|E

40|$|<b>Longhorn</b> <b>beetles</b> (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) {{have been}} used to {{identify}} sites of high biological diversity and conservation value in cultivated landscapes, but were rarely studied in changing landscapes of humid tropics. This study was conducted in a region of southern Yunnan, China, which was dominated by natural rainforest until 30 years ago, but is successively transformed into commercial rubber monoculture plantations since that time. The objectives were to investigate <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetle</b> species diversity and distribution in the major land use types of this landscape and to estimate the effects of an expected expansion of rubber plantations on the <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetle</b> assemblages. The results showed that tree species diversity (181 species in total) and <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetle</b> diversity (220 species in total) were closely related with {{no significant differences between the}} tree and <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetles</b> assemblages shown by similarity distance analysis. There was a highly positive relationship between the estimated species richness of <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetles</b> and the number of tree species. Individual numbers of <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetles</b> and trees were also highly positive related at the sampling sites. Non-metric multidimensional scaling revealed that the degree of canopy coverage, succession age and tree diversity explained 78. 5 % of the total variation in <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetle</b> assemblage composition. Natural forest sites had significantly higher numbers of species and individuals than any other type of habitat.

40|$|Tree {{colonization}} {{and feeding}} {{activity of the}} invasive wood-borer <b>Asian</b> <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetle</b> (Anoplophora glabripennis), an Asian pest introduced into North America and Europe, was studied in a newly invaded area in Italy. The hypothesis being tested was that the reproductive success of the insect depend on habitat type and tree suitability. Adult beetles were caged on branches of host and nonhost species, in both urban and forest habitats. Two months later, number and size of feeding patches on plant tissues, eggs laid, and surviving larvae were assessed. Bark concentration of C and N was also measured from the same trees. Results indicated that the mean area of plant tissues consumed by adult feeding was significantly larger on trees growing in forest than in urban habitat, although within the same habitat {{there were no differences}} between susceptible and nonsusceptible trees. ALB tree colonization, in terms of number of eggs laid and young larvae survival, was not affected by habitat while it was higher on susceptible trees. Although trees growing in forests had a lower nitrogen concentration, they allowed colonization rates similar to those of trees growing in the urban habitat. Hence, the amount of carbon and nitrogen did not fully explain tree suitability or habitat selection. We suggest compensatory feeding as a potential mechanism that might explain this peculiar situation, as supported by a more intensive feeding activity recorded on trees in the forest. Suitability of different trees may be due to other factors, such as secondary chemical compounds...|$|E
40|$|It is well {{recognised}} that {{pests and}} pathogens are increasingly threatening both natural woody ecosystems and plantation forestry world-wide. This threat is largely {{connected to the}} increasing movement of people and products globally, with concomitant introductions of pests and pathogens into new environments. Typically, these invasive alien organisms are accidentally transferred from areas where they are native to the same or closely related tree hosts, to elsewhere in the world. For tree pathogens, there are many well known examples such as those for the causal agents of Dutch elm disease, chestnut blight, {{white pine blister rust}} and pine wilt caused by the pine wood nematode. Equally well known examples for insect pests are the gypsy moth, the <b>Asian</b> <b>longhorn</b> <b>beetle,</b> various conifer infesting bark beetles and the emerald ash borer. In addition to these pests and diseases, the introduction of which should be easier to predict given knowledge of patterns of introduction, there is growing evidence that novel host, pest and pathogen interactions are evolving. In this situation, host shifts are apparently occurring where pests and pathogens are able to infest or infect trees that would previously have been considered as non-hosts. There are also intriguing, yet very worrying, new associations emerging between insects and pathogens that are able to cause substantially greater damage to the host trees than has been known for these organisms in the past. In general, these novel associations are poorly understood and due to their unpredictable nature, they seriously complicate quarantine efforts. There is clearly an urgent need to gain knowledge regarding patterns and processes underlying the emergence of host shifts as well as novel pest and pathogen interactions. Research regarding novel associations and host shifts, which might in the past have been considered esoteric, should clearly gain vigorous support in order to reduce an emerging new threat to global forests and forestry.
