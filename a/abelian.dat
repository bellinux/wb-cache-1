5|$|The {{study of}} finitely {{generated}} <b>abelian</b> groups is quite mature, including the fundamental theorem of finitely generated <b>abelian</b> groups; and reflecting {{this state of}} affairs, many group-related notions, such as center and commutator, describe {{the extent to which}} a given group is not <b>abelian.</b>|$|E
5|$|An <b>abelian</b> group, or {{commutative}} {{group is}} a group whose group operation is commutative.|$|E
5|$|Mathematically, QED is an <b>abelian</b> {{gauge theory}} with the {{symmetry}} group U(1). The gauge field, which mediates {{the interaction between}} the charged spin-1/2 fields, is the electromagnetic field.|$|E
5|$|The {{identity}} {{element of a}} group G is often written as 1 or 1G, a notation inherited from the multiplicative identity. If a group is <b>abelian,</b> then one may choose to denote the group operation by + and the {{identity element}} by 0; in that case, the group is called an additive group. The identity element can also be written as id.|$|E
25|$|The {{product of}} an <b>abelian</b> variety A of {{dimension}} m, and an <b>abelian</b> variety B of dimension n, over the same field, is an <b>abelian</b> variety of dimension m + n. An <b>abelian</b> variety is simple {{if it is not}} isogenous to a product of <b>abelian</b> varieties of lower dimension. Any <b>abelian</b> variety is isogenous to a product of simple <b>abelian</b> varieties.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the category}} of all <b>abelian</b> groups is an <b>abelian</b> category. The category of all finitely generated <b>abelian</b> groups is also an <b>abelian</b> category, as is {{the category of}} all finite <b>abelian</b> groups.|$|E
25|$|If X is a topological space, {{then the}} {{category}} of all sheaves of <b>abelian</b> groups on X is an <b>abelian</b> category. More generally, {{the category of}} sheaves of <b>abelian</b> groups on a Grothendieck site is an <b>abelian</b> category. In this way, <b>abelian</b> categories show up in algebraic topology and algebraic geometry.|$|E
25|$|Every {{subgroup}} of an <b>abelian</b> group is normal, so each subgroup {{gives rise to}} a quotient group. Subgroups, quotients, and direct sums of <b>abelian</b> groups are again <b>abelian.</b> The finite simple <b>abelian</b> groups are exactly the cyclic groups of prime order.|$|E
25|$|C is an <b>abelian</b> {{subcategory}} if it {{is itself}} an <b>abelian</b> category and the inclusion I is an exact functor. This occurs {{if and only if}} C is closed under taking kernels and cokernels. Note that there are examples of full subcategories of an <b>abelian</b> category which are themselves <b>abelian</b> but where the inclusion functor is not exact, so they are not <b>abelian</b> subcategories (see below).|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, an <b>abelian</b> {{category}} is a category in which morphisms and objects {{can be added}} and in which kernels and cokernels exist and have desirable properties. The motivating prototype example of an <b>abelian</b> {{category is}} the category of <b>abelian</b> groups, Ab. The theory originated in a tentative attempt to unify several cohomology theories by Alexander Grothendieck. <b>Abelian</b> categories are very stable categories, for example they are regular and they satisfy the snake lemma. The class of <b>Abelian</b> categories is closed under several categorical constructions, for example, the category of chain complexes of an <b>Abelian</b> category, or the category of functors from a small category to an <b>Abelian</b> category are <b>Abelian</b> as well. These stability properties make them inevitable in homological algebra and beyond; the theory has major applications in algebraic geometry, cohomology and pure category theory. <b>Abelian</b> categories are named after Niels Henrik Abel.|$|E

The motivating prototype example of an <b>abelian</b> {{category is}} the category of <b>abelian</b> groups, Ab.

25|$|The {{theory of}} <b>abelian</b> groups is decidable. The theory of Infinite {{divisible}} torsion-free <b>abelian</b> groups is complete, {{as is the}} theory of Infinite <b>abelian</b> groups of exponent p (for p prime).|$|E
25|$|Every ring is an <b>abelian</b> {{group with}} respect to its {{addition}} operation. In a commutative ring the invertible elements, or units, form an <b>abelian</b> multiplicative group. In particular, the real numbers are an <b>abelian</b> group under addition, and the nonzero real numbers are an <b>abelian</b> group under multiplication.|$|E
25|$|An <b>abelian</b> {{function}} is a meromorphic function on an <b>abelian</b> variety, {{which may be}} regarded therefore as a periodic function of n complex variables, having 2n independent periods; equivalently, it is a function in the function field of an <b>abelian</b> variety.|$|E
25|$|Every <b>abelian</b> {{category}} A is {{a module}} over the monoidal category of finitely generated <b>abelian</b> groups; that is, we can form a tensor {{product of a}} finitely generated <b>abelian</b> group G and any object A of A.|$|E
25|$|The {{classification}} theorems for finitely generated, divisible, countable periodic, {{and rank}} 1 torsion-free <b>abelian</b> groups explained above were all obtained before 1950 {{and form a}} foundation of the classification of more general infinite <b>abelian</b> groups. Important technical tools used in classification of infinite <b>abelian</b> groups are pure and basic subgroups. Introduction of various invariants of torsion-free <b>abelian</b> groups has been one avenue of further progress. See the books by Irving Kaplansky, László Fuchs, Phillip Griffith, and David Arnold, {{as well as the}} proceedings of the conferences on <b>Abelian</b> Group Theory published in Lecture Notes in Mathematics for more recent findings.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} an <b>abelian</b> group {{is one of the}} first {{concepts}} encountered in undergraduate abstract algebra, from which many other basic concepts, such as modules and vector spaces, are developed. The theory of <b>abelian</b> groups is generally simpler than that of their non-abelian counterparts, and finite <b>abelian</b> groups are very well understood. On the other hand, the theory of infinite <b>abelian</b> groups is an area of current research.|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} theorem of finite <b>abelian</b> groups {{states that}} every finite <b>abelian</b> group G {{can be expressed}} as the direct sum of cyclic subgroups of prime-power order; it {{is also known as}} the basis theorem for finite <b>abelian</b> groups. This is generalized by the fundamental theorem of finitely generated <b>abelian</b> groups, with finite groups being the special case when G has zero rank; this in turn admits numerous further generalizations.|$|E
25|$|A ring is an <b>abelian</b> {{group with}} a second binary {{operation}} that is associative, is distributive over the <b>abelian</b> group operation, and has an identity element. By extension from the integers, the <b>abelian</b> group operation is called addition and the second binary operation is called multiplication.|$|E
25|$|The {{collection}} of all <b>abelian</b> groups, {{together with the}} homomorphisms between them, forms the category Ab, the prototype of an <b>abelian</b> category.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} basic invariants of an {{infinite}} <b>abelian</b> group A is its rank: the cardinality of the maximal linearly independent subset of A. <b>Abelian</b> groups of rank 0 are precisely the periodic groups, while torsion-free <b>abelian</b> groups of rank 1 are necessarily subgroups of Q and can be completely described. More generally, a torsion-free <b>abelian</b> group of finite rank r is a subgroup of Qr. On the other hand, the group of p-adic integers Zp is a torsion-free <b>abelian</b> group of infinite Z-rank and the groups Z with different n are non-isomorphic, so this invariant does not even fully capture properties of some familiar groups.|$|E
25|$|For {{local class}} field theory, {{it is also}} {{possible}} to construct <b>abelian</b> extensions more explicitly using Lubin–Tate formal group laws. For global fields, the <b>abelian</b> extensions can be constructed explicitly in some cases: for example, the <b>abelian</b> extensions of the rationals can be constructed using roots of unity, and the <b>abelian</b> extensions of quadratic imaginary fields can be constructed using elliptic functions, but finding an analog of this for arbitrary global fields is an unsolved problem.|$|E
25|$|The length-function ℓX : G → Z {{is said to}} be <b>abelian</b> if it is a group {{homomorphism}} from G to Z and non-abelian otherwise. Similarly, {{the action}} of G on X {{is said to be}} <b>abelian</b> if the associated hyperbolic length function is <b>abelian</b> and is said to be non-abelian otherwise.|$|E
25|$|A {{topological group}} is called locally compact if the {{underlying}} topological space is locally compact and Hausdorff. It's called <b>abelian</b> if the underlying group is <b>abelian.</b>|$|E
25|$|Theorems about <b>abelian</b> groups (i.e. modules {{over the}} {{principal}} ideal domain Z) {{can often be}} generalized to theorems about modules over an arbitrary principal ideal domain. A typical example is the classification of finitely generated <b>abelian</b> groups which is a specialization of the structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain. In the case of finitely generated <b>abelian</b> groups, this theorem guarantees that an <b>abelian</b> group splits as a direct sum of a torsion group and a free <b>abelian</b> group. The former may be written as a direct sum of finitely many groups of the form Z/pkZ for p prime, and {{the latter is a}} direct sum of finitely many copies of Z.|$|E
25|$|In many categories, e.g. Ab or VectK, the hom-sets hom(a, b) are {{not just}} sets but {{actually}} <b>abelian</b> groups, and the composition of morphisms is compatible with these group structures; i.e. is bilinear. Such a category is called preadditive. If, furthermore, the category has all finite products and coproducts, it is called an additive category. If all morphisms have a kernel and a cokernel, and all epimorphisms are cokernels and all monomorphisms are kernels, then we speak of an <b>abelian</b> category. A typical example of an <b>abelian</b> category is the category of <b>abelian</b> groups.|$|E
25|$|Homology and cohomology groups, on {{the other}} hand, are <b>abelian</b> and in many {{important}} cases finitely generated. Finitely generated <b>abelian</b> groups are completely classified and are particularly easy to work with.|$|E
25|$|The center Z(G) {{of a group}} G is the set of {{elements}} that commute with every element of G. A group G is <b>abelian</b> {{if and only if}} it is equal to its center Z(G). The center of a group G is always a characteristic <b>abelian</b> subgroup of G. If the quotient group G/Z(G) of a group by its center is cyclic then G is <b>abelian.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{group of}} k-rational points {{for a global}} field k is finitely {{generated}} by the Mordell-Weil theorem. Hence, by the structure theorem for finitely generated <b>abelian</b> groups, it is isomorphic to {{a product of a}} free <b>abelian</b> group Zr and a finite commutative group for some non-negative integer r called the rank of the <b>abelian</b> variety. Similar results hold for some other classes of fields k.|$|E
25|$|Consider the {{following}} commutative diagram in any <b>abelian</b> category (such as {{the category of}} <b>abelian</b> groups or the category of vector spaces over a given field) or {{in the category of}} groups.|$|E
25|$|A complex <b>abelian</b> {{variety of}} {{dimension}} g {{is a complex}} torus of dimension g that is also a projective algebraic variety over the field of complex numbers. Since they are complex tori, <b>abelian</b> varieties carry {{the structure of a}} group. A morphism of <b>abelian</b> varieties is a morphism of the underlying algebraic varieties that preserves the identity element for the group structure. An isogeny is a finite-to-one morphism.|$|E
25|$|If C {{is a small}} {{category}} and A is an <b>abelian</b> category, then the category of all functors from C to A forms an <b>abelian</b> category. If C is small and preadditive, then the category of all additive functors from C to A also forms an <b>abelian</b> category. The latter is a generalization of the R-module example, since a ring {{can be understood as}} a preadditive category with a single object.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the complex}} numbers, a polarised <b>abelian</b> variety {{can also be}} defined as an <b>abelian</b> variety A {{together}} {{with a choice of}} a Riemann form H. Two Riemann forms H1 and H2 are called equivalent if there are positive integers n and m such that nH1=mH2. A choice of an equivalence class of Riemann forms on A is called a polarisation of A. A morphism of polarised <b>abelian</b> varieties is a morphism A → B of <b>abelian</b> varieties such that the pullback of the Riemann form on B to A is equivalent to the given form on A.|$|E
25|$|As we have stated, {{the dual}} group of a locally compact <b>abelian</b> {{group is a}} locally compact <b>abelian</b> group {{in its own right}} and thus has a Haar measure, or more {{precisely}} a whole family of scale-related Haar measures.|$|E
25|$|Given any pair A, B {{of objects}} in an <b>abelian</b> category, {{there is a special}} zero {{morphism}} from A to B. This can be defined as the zero element of the hom-set Hom(A,B), since this is an <b>abelian</b> group.|$|E
25|$|If A is an <b>abelian</b> {{category}} and A is {{an object of}} A, then HomA(A,) is a covariant left-exact functor from A to the category Ab of <b>abelian</b> groups. It is exact {{if and only if}} A is projective.|$|E
