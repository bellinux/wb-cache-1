5000|$|Before {{going to}} court, {{citizens}} must usually first {{object to the}} decision with the <b>administrative</b> <b>body</b> who made it. This is called [...] "bezwaar". This procedure allows for the <b>administrative</b> <b>body</b> to correct possible mistakes themselves and is used to filter cases before going to court. Sometimes, instead of bezwaar, a different system is used called [...] "administratief beroep" [...] (administrative appeal). The difference with bezwaar is that administratief beroep is filed with a different <b>administrative</b> <b>body,</b> usually a higher ranking one, than the <b>administrative</b> <b>body</b> that made the primary decision. Administratief beroep is available only if the law on which the primary decision is based specifically provides for it. An example involves objecting to a traffic ticket with the district attorney ("officier van justitie"), after which the decision can be appealed in court.|$|R
