40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to answer the following question: can the central bank of Egypt achieve the goal of price stability under the currently <b>applied</b> <b>monetary</b> targeting regime? The answer depends on whether or not the demand for money function is stable in Egypt. Using quarterly data on the period 1995 - 2007, the study estimated the long run demand for money function in Egypt. By testing its stability for structural change, the demand for money function is found instable. Thus, the study concludes that the central bank of Egypt cannot achieve price stability under the currently <b>applied</b> <b>monetary</b> targeting regime. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} comprises three empirical {{essays on}} adopting the inflation targeting regime in Egypt. It {{sets out to}} answer the following questions: (i) Can the central bank of Egypt (CBE) achieve the goal of price stability under the currently <b>applied</b> <b>monetary</b> targeting regime? (ii) Is the legal independence granted to the CBE under the latest legislation promulgated in 2005 factual? (iii) Does the CBE maintain an implicit target for the FX rate? Does the CBE follow an independent monetary policy? Which variables have priority in the reaction function of the CBE? How far can foreign economic shocks explain the behavior of real GDP and price level in the Egyptian economy compared with domestic economic shocks? And which monetary transmission mechanism channels play a dominant role in the Egyptian economy? The main conclusions of the study came as follows: (i) Neither the demand for money function nor the velocity of circulation of money is found stable in Egypt. Thus, the study concludes that the CBE cannot achieve price stability under the currently <b>applied</b> <b>monetary</b> targeting regime. (ii) The legal independence granted to the CBE under the latest legislation is not factual.

30|$|By <b>applying</b> <b>monetary</b> supply-use {{principles}} in the WIOA framework, Lenzen and Reynolds (2014) developed {{a method to}} construct waste supply-use tables. They considered that a supply-use approach has an advantage because it includes the allocation matrix from WIOA model into the accounting system, which enables the simultaneous generation of industry and commodities multipliers (Lenzen and Rueda-Cantuche 2012). In addition, a supply-use model can distinguish between multiple waste types and treatment methods. The researchers demonstrated that WIOA and WSUA multipliers were equivalents by employing Miyazawa’s partitioned inverse method. An application of WSUA was presented by Reynolds et al. (2014), in which the authors assessed the direct and indirect flows of waste generated by intermediate sectors of the Australian economy.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, I {{argue that}} <b>applied</b> <b>monetary</b> policy {{analysis}} is hard. In particular, {{all of our}} models are grossly deficient relative to the ideal, and this cannot be corrected in the medium term. This view {{has important implications for}} answering the Simsian question of whether any given change in policy analysis methods is progress or regress. As an application of these ideas, I assess the potential role of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models to policy analysis. If DSGE models are modified so they can play all the functions as old-style models, progress or regress may be unclear. If these models are used in the roles for which they are best suited, they can make a vital positive contribution...|$|R
40|$|In linear {{macroeconomic}} models, {{an active}} Taylor rule for monetary policy can guarantee a locally unique nonexplosive equilibrium. In {{a series of}} articles, Benhabib, Schmitt-Grohé, and Uribe looked beyond the local dynamics and showed that active Taylor rules could interact with the zero bound on nominal interest rates to generate multiple equilibria, including a steady-state equilibrium with inflation below target. Recently, the persistence of low inflation and low nominal interest rates has brought attention to Benhabib, Schmitt-Grohé, and Uribe's work in policy circles. We provide an introduction to this line of research. The specific model used here—Rotemberg price setting in discrete time—fits neatly into the frameworks typically used for <b>applied</b> <b>monetary</b> policy analysis. Furthermore, we provide computer programs in the open source software R to replicate the results in the paper. Inflation (Finance); Monetary policy...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a dynamic stochastic general-equilibrium {{model with a}} single friction in all markets: sticky information. In this economy, agents are inattentive because of costs of acquiring, absorbing and processing information, so that the actions of consumers, workers and firms are slow to incorporate news. This paper presents {{the details of how}} an economy with pervasive inattentiveness functions, and develops a set of algorithms that solve the model quickly. It then applies these to estimate the model using data for the United States post- 1986 and for the Euro-area post- 1993, and to conduct counterfactual policy experiments. The end result is a laboratory that is rich enough to account for the dynamics of at least five macroeconomic series (inflation, output, hours, interest rates, and wages), and which can be used to inform <b>applied</b> <b>monetary</b> policy. ...|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} cognitive reappraisal, one important kind of emotion regulation strategy, on psychological and electrophysiological responses to gains and losses, a monetary gambling task was performed in two conditions, that is, spontaneity and regulation. Event-related potentials (ERP) and self-rating emotional experiences to outcome feedback were recorded during the task. Cognitive reappraisal reduced self-rating emotional experience to both gains and losses and the amplitudes of the feedback-related negativity (FRN) and the P 3 of ERPs. According to these results, we suggest that the application of cognitive reappraisal strategy significantly modulated the motivational salience of current outcomes, thus weakening the subjective emotional experience elicited. In addition, cognitive reappraisal might have changed the allocation of cognitive resources during outcome evaluation. This study extends emotion regulation studies by <b>applying</b> <b>monetary</b> outcomes as emotional stimuli, and also implicates the significance of emotion regulation in decision-making processes...|$|R

40|$|It {{has become}} common {{practice}} in <b>applied</b> <b>monetary</b> economics to posit an interest rate rule {{as a component of}} the economic environment. Since the general equilibrium setting imposes a money demand relationship, the interest rate rule implies that the money supply is endogenous. Rarely are the properties of the money supply implied by the model compared to the data. In this paper, we take the monetary implications of a monetary model seriously in a limited participation model that permits both technology and money shocks. We model the money supply as an exogenous Markov process and calibrate the parameters of the Markov process to the data. We then examine whether the model produces an interest rate rule similar to the Taylor rule relationship observed in the data. The model is able to duplicate qualitatively the relationship between inflation and nominal interest implied by the Taylor rule, but fails dramatically to replicate the correlation between nominal interest rates and output. calibration...|$|R

We analyze the different perspectives taken on these challenges and present a number of proposals to deal with the challenges in developing ecosystem accounts. These proposals comprise several novel aspects, including (i) presenting an accounting approach that recognizes that most ecosystems are strongly influenced by people and that ecosystem services depend on natural processes as well as human ecosystem management; and, (ii) recording ecosystem services as either contributions of a private land owner or as generated by a sector ’Ecosystems’ {{depending on the type of}} ecosystem service.

40|$|This paper re-emphasizes {{the link}} from {{structural}} policies to enhanced macroeconomic stabilization {{using a small}} structural model estimated on quarterly data for Macedonia and Slovakia over 1995 - 2007. The success of macroeconomic stabilization, typically in hands of monetary policy, is not only determined by a suitable choice of the nominal anchor, which shapes the reaction function of monetary policy, but also the constraints within which the monetary policy strives to achieve its objectives. The key attributes of the constraints to macroeconomic stabilization are economic rigidities and structural shocks. By benchmarking the estimated economic rigidities and structural shocks faced by Macedonia to those faced by Slovakia, we find that Macedonia has relatively weaker transmission mechanisms of monetary policy, higher output rigidity, a lower exchange rate pass-through, and faces larger external shocks. For Macedonia, these relatively higher constraints on monetary policy together with the chosen exchange rate anchor result in higher output and inflation volatility relative to Slovakia. Hence, it appears that small open economies with stronger economic rigidities should <b>apply</b> <b>monetary</b> policy regimes that allow for more flexible adjustments in external relative prices to enhance their macroeconomic stability. ...|$|R
40|$|Using {{a dynamic}} {{infinite}} horizon optimizing model, it is {{shown that the}} empirical demand for money equation employed by a generation of <b>applied</b> <b>monetary</b> researchers is a reduced form model of the dynamic Euler equations for real money balances. The Euler equations derived in this paper focus on the finance capital for the firm and consist of real money balances (M 1) and real business loans (F 1) for selected manufacturing industries. By employing explicit structural dynamic specification and sectoral disaggregation, {{the question of how}} firms close the gap between desired real money balances and actual real money balances is examined. Model consistent ‘desired’ levels of money balances and business loans are found to depend not only upon the usual transactions variable and interest rate but also upon relative prices and a technology index. Moreover, the speed in closing the gap between desired and actual money balances (loan balances) is estimated using annual two-digit Standard Industrial Code data for durable and non-durable industries. Non-durable industries tend to close the gap faster than durable industries by as much as 25 % in a given year. ...|$|R
