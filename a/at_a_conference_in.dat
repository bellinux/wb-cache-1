5|$|In August 2011, {{extracts}} from She Has a Name were read <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>in</b> Strathmore called Justice Tapestry. A {{reading of the}} play took place during an event at Mount Royal University on February 16, 2012, which also included a speech by Yvon Dandurand {{on the subject of}} human trafficking, and a book signing by John Winterdyk for his book Human Trafficking: Exploring the International Nature, Concerns, and Complexities.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to the University, Arafat studied civil engineering and {{served as president of}} the General Union of Palestinian Students (GUPS) from 1952 to 1956. During his first year as president of the union, the University was renamed Cairo University after a coup was carried out by the Free Officers Movement overthrowing King Farouk I. By that time, Arafat had graduated with a bachelor's degree in civil engineering and was called to duty to fight with Egyptian forces during the Suez Crisis; however, he never actually fought. Later that year, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>in</b> Prague, he donned a solid white keffiyeh–different from the fishnet-patterned one he adopted later in Kuwait, which was to become his emblem.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>in</b> 2011, the two {{new leaders}} of the FN and the FPÖ, Marine Le Pen and Heinz-Christian Strache, {{announced}} deeper cooperation between their parties. Pursuing her de-demonization policy, in October 2011, Marine Le Pen, as new president of the National Front, joined the European Alliance for Freedom (EAF). The EAF is a pan-European sovereigntist platform founded late 2010 that is recognized by the European Parliament. The EAF has individual members linked to the Austrian Freedom Party of Heinz-Christian Strache, the UK Independence Party, and other movements such as the Sweden Democrats, Vlaams Belang (Belgian Flanders), Germany (Bürger in Wut), and Slovakia (Slovak National Party).|$|E

5|$|<b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>in</b> September 1906, {{many of the}} {{disagreements}} over the ship's design were resolved. The Naval Constructor, von Eickstedt, argued that since the explosive trials for the proposed protection systems for the new battlecruiser had not been completed, the construction should be postponed, to allow for any alterations to the design. He also argued that guns of 21cm(8.3in) or 24cm(9.4in) caliber would be sufficient to penetrate the armor of the new British battlecruisers. However, Admiral August von Heeringen, of the General Navy Department, stated that for the ship {{to be able to}} engage battleships, the 28cm(11in) caliber guns were necessary.|$|E
5|$|Detailed {{planning}} and orders for Operation Trio were finalised <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>in</b> Ljubljana on 28–29 March 1942. Laxa, General Mario Roatta (the {{commander of the}} Italian Second Army), and General der Artillerie Paul Bader (the commander of German forces in the NDH) negotiated a compromise permitting temporary non-political agreements to be concluded with the Herzegovinian Chetniks, led by Dobroslav Jevđević, but not {{with any of the}} Bosnian Chetnik groups, whose leaders were Petar Baćović in the area of Foča and Jezdimir Dangić, who was aligned with the Serb collaborationist Milan Nedić.|$|E
5|$|During the 1993 {{run for the}} {{national}} title, Smith used a method that was introduced to him <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>in</b> Switzerland. At the conference, Smith was presented a tape by a lecturer who used doctored images to achieve his goal of losing weight. The photos showed the lecturer what he would look like if he were thinner as motivation to reach his weight-loss goals. Smith {{took a picture of}} the scoreboard from the 1982 Championship, modified it to read 1993 and erased the name Georgetown, leaving that space blank. He proceeded to place copies of the doctored photo in all of the players' lockers.|$|E

5|$|In 1911, it was {{revealed}} that in 1910–11 Curie had conducted an affair of about a year's duration with physicist Paul Langevin, a former student of Pierre's—a married man who was estranged from his wife. This resulted in a press scandal that was exploited by her academic opponents. Curie (then in her mid-40s) was five years older than Langevin and was misrepresented in the tabloids as a foreign Jewish home-wrecker. When the scandal broke, she was away <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>in</b> Belgium; on her return, she found an angry mob in front of her house and had to seek refuge, with her daughters, in the home of her friend, Camille Marbo.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, the Madras Dravidian Association was {{established}} by C. Natesa Mudaliar. Ramarayaningar was elected as the first President of the Association. On 19 July 1917, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>in</b> Coimbatore presided over by the Ramarayaningar, the four different non-Brahmin associations got together to form the South Indian Liberal Federation, unofficially known as the Justice Party. In 1921, Ramarayaningar was sent along with Kurma Venkata Reddy Naidu and Koka Appa Rao Naidu to lobby {{on behalf of the}} Justice Party before the authorities in England.|$|E
5|$|In December 1942, Chetniks from Montenegro and Sandžak met <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>in</b> {{the village}} of Šahovići near Bijelo Polje. The conference was {{dominated}} by Montenegrin Serb Chetnik commander Major Pavle Đurišić and its resolutions expressed extremism and intolerance, {{as well as an}} agenda which focused on restoring the pre-war status quo in Yugoslavia implemented in its initial stages by a Chetnik dictatorship. It also laid claim to parts of the territory of Yugoslavia's neighbors. At this conference, Mihailović was represented by his chief of staff, Major Zaharije Ostojić, who had previously been encouraged by Mihailović to wage a campaign of terror against the Muslim population living along the borders of Montenegro and the Sandžak.|$|E

5|$|Two teams claim {{credit for}} the {{discovery}} of Haumea. Mike Brown and his team at Caltech discovered Haumea in December 2004 on images they had taken on May 6, 2004. On July 20, 2005, they published an online abstract of a report intended to announce the discovery <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>in</b> September 2005. At around this time, José Luis Ortiz Moreno and his team at the Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía at Sierra Nevada Observatory in Spain found Haumea on images taken on March 7–10, 2003. Ortiz emailed the Minor Planet Center with their discovery {{on the night of}} July 27, 2005.|$|E
5|$|While many of {{the leaders}} were of socialist or anarchist leanings, few of their {{supporters}} were revolutionaries. Nevertheless, the peasants who assembled into the Fasci were eager for social justice and convinced that a new world {{was about to be}} born. A crucifix hung beside the red flag in {{many of the}}ir meeting-places, and portraits of the King beside those of the revolutionaries Garibaldi, Mazzini and Marx. Cheers for the King were often heard in their marches that almost resembled quasi-religious processions. Many of the Fasci were part of the Italian Workers' Party (Partito dei Lavoratori Italiani, the initial name of the Italian Socialist Party) that had been founded <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>in</b> Genoa on August 14, 1892.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>in</b> 2011, Strache and the {{new leader}} of the French National Front, Marine Le Pen, {{announced}} deeper cooperation between their parties. Shortly thereafter, the FPÖ attempted {{to become a member}} of the Europe for Freedom and Democracy group, but was vetoed by some of its parties. The FPÖ's two MEPs are individual members of the establishing European Alliance for Freedom. After the 2014 European elections, the party joined the National Front, the Northern League, Vlaams Belang and the Czech Civic Conservative Party in forming the Movement for a Europe of Nations and Freedom, and participated along with these parties, the Dutch Party for Freedom, the Alternative for Germany, the Polish Congress of the New Right and a former member of the UK Independence Party in the Europe of Nations and Freedom parliamentary group.|$|E

5|$|From 1984 to 1991 the sindicatos {{embarked}} {{on a series of}} protests against the forced eradication of coca by occupying local government offices, setting up roadblocks, going on hunger strike, and organizing mass marches and demonstrations. Morales was personally involved in this direct activism and in 1984 was present at a roadblock where 3 campesinos were killed. In 1988, Morales was elected to the position of Executive Secretary of the Federation of the Tropics. In 1989 he spoke at a one-year commemoratory event of the Villa Tunari massacre in which 11 coca farmers had been killed by agents of the Rural Area Mobile Patrol Unit (Unidad Móvil Policial para Áreas Rurales – UMOPAR). The following day, UMOPAR agents beat Morales up, leaving him in the mountains to die, but he was rescued by other union members. To combat this violence, Morales concluded that an armed cocalero militia could launch a guerrilla war against the government, but he was soon persuaded on an electoral path to change instead. In 1992, he made various international trips to champion the cocalero cause, speaking <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>in</b> Cuba, and also traveling to Canada, during which he learned of his mother's death.|$|E
5|$|He {{was again}} struck by {{depression}} in 1948 when Sir Alfred Thompson Denning and Sir John Singleton were both {{appointed to the}} Court of Appeal ahead of him, despite having been appointed to the High Court after him. On 30 July 1949, Birkett went to the Lord Chancellor and discussed the possibility of his appointment to the Court of Appeal, but left dissatisfied. On 14 November, a duodenal ulcer perforated, from which he spent six months recovering. In an attempt to appease him, the Lord Chancellor offered Birkett a peerage without salary on 8 May 1950, but he refused as he lacked the means to survive without paid employment. While speaking <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>in</b> Washington, D.C. on 31 August 1950, he received a telegram from the Lord Chancellor offering him appointment to the Court of Appeal; he immediately wired back his acceptance. He was sworn in on 2 October, and heard his first case the following day.|$|E
5|$|In July 2010, Booker {{attended}} a dinner <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>in</b> Sun Valley, Idaho, {{where he was}} seated with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg, who had no known ties to Newark, announced in September 2010 that he was donating $100 million of his personal fortune to the Newark school system. According to {{an article in the}} New York Times, Booker and Zuckerberg continued their conversation about Booker's plans for Newark. The initial gift was made to start a foundation for education. The gift was formally announced when Booker, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, and Zuckerberg appeared together on The Oprah Winfrey Show. The timing of Zuckerberg's donation was questioned by some as a move for damage control to his image, as it was announced on the opening day of the movie The Social Network, a film that painted an unflattering portrait of Zuckerberg. On her show, however, Winfrey told the audience that Zuckerberg and Booker had been in talks for months and had actually planned the announcement for the previous month, and that she and Booker had to force Zuckerberg to put his name to the donation, which he had wanted to make anonymously.|$|E

5|$|Kepler-8b is {{the fifth}} of the first five exoplanets {{discovered}} by NASA's Kepler spacecraft, which aims to discover planets in a region of the sky between the constellations Lyra and Cygnus that transit (cross in front of) their host stars. The planet is the hottest of the five. Kepler-8b was the only planet discovered in Kepler-8's orbit, and is larger (though more diffuse) than Jupiter. It orbits its host star every 3.5 days. The planet also demonstrates the Rossiter–McLaughlin effect, where the planet's orbit affects the redshifting of the spectrum of the host star. Kepler-8b was announced to the public on January 4, 2010 <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>in</b> Washington, D.C. after radial velocity measurements conducted at the W.M. Keck Observatory confirmed its detection by Kepler.|$|E
5|$|Thoughts {{of a new}} way {{to improve}} the {{nighttime}} environment began in summer 2011 when the new Cedar Fair CEO, Matt Ouimet was in the park one night and thought they should add more lights and excitement. The goal was to create a new show that would energize the main midway with bright lights and music. Matt Ouimet first mentioned the show <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>in</b> January 2012. Details of Luminosity were first announced at the PointBuzz winter tour of Cedar Point on February 25, 2012. The 3,600 square foot screen used for American Portrait and Hot Summer Lights was taken down on February 28 because it was not needed for the new show. On April 13, Cedar Point officially announced Luminosity. The show debuted on June 1 for previews and its grand opening was held on June 8.|$|E
5|$|U.S. Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross {{informs the}} Avengers that the United Nations (UN) is {{preparing}} to pass the Sokovia Accords, which will establish a UN panel to oversee and control the team. The Avengers are divided: Tony Stark supports oversight because of his role in Ultron's creation and Sokovia's devastation, while Rogers has more faith in his own judgment {{than that of a}} government. Helmut Zemo tracks down and kills Barnes' old Hydra handler, stealing a book containing the trigger words that activate Barnes' brainwashing. <b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>conference</b> <b>in</b> Vienna where the Accords are to be ratified, a bomb kills King T'Chaka of Wakanda. Security footage indicates the bomber is Barnes, whom T'Chaka's son, T'Challa, vows to kill. Informed by Sharon Carter of Barnes' whereabouts and the authorities' intentions to kill him, Rogers decides to try to bring in Barnes—his childhood friend and war comrade—himself. Rogers and Wilson track Barnes to Bucharest and attempt to protect him from T'Challa and the authorities, but all four, including T'Challa, are apprehended.|$|E
