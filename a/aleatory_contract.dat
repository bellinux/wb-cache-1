5000|$|An <b>aleatory</b> <b>{{contract}}</b> is {{a contract}} contract where the exchange is uneven. The {{most common type}} of <b>aleatory</b> <b>contract</b> is an insurance policy. [...] Such an insurance contract may be a boom to one party but create a major loss for the other, as more in benefits may be paid out than actual premiums received, or vice versa.For instance: You pay up $1,000 in premiums for an insurance policy and then you have a loss and the policy pays you $100,000 in return then the benefit is uneven. The insurance company collected $1,000 from you and paid you $100,000 in return. This can also end up the other way where you pay the insurance company without making any collection at all.|$|E
5000|$|Some of {{the offices}} that Pope Sixtus V {{classified}} as vacabili were {{of minor importance}} and therefore did not require special competence were sold with a grant {{of the right of}} succession to the heirs of the purchaser. Offices that entailed grave obligations and for which only pious and learned men were eligible were sold without this right and therefore reverted to the Roman Curia on the death of the purchaser. An <b>aleatory</b> <b>contract,</b> therefore, was formed, its uncertainties being the amount of the income of the office and the length {{of the life of the}} purchaser. The prices of the offices, especially of the more desirable ones, were considerable: Lorenzo Corsini, afterwards Pope Clement XII, bought the office of Regent of the Cancellaria for 30,000 Roman scudi, a large fortune at the time. The disadvantage of these uncertainties might not be confined to the purchaser because he was free to condition the purchased office on the life of another designated person, named the [...] "intestatary". The purchaser was also permitted to substitute a different intestatary if this substitution was expressed 40 days before the death of the immediately preceding intestatary.|$|E
50|$|If {{the insured}} {{does not have}} an {{insurable}} interest in the object, the contract will be void and unenforceable, and regarded essentially as a gamble or wager. The purpose of the requirement of insurable interest is to distinguish insurance from wagering. The basic principle of insurance is to protect against loss; it is not concerned with the creation of opportunities for speculative gain. In the formative days of insurance law, things were quite different; insurance was in fact often indistinguishable from gambling. Excesses led in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries to the outright banning of life insurance, for example, in France, the Dutch Republic and Sweden. The more reasonable course, requiring an insurable interest as a prerequisite for the purchase of insurance, was pioneered in England, making insurance more than a mere game of chance, improving the repute of the insurance industry (formerly frowned upon as an <b>aleatory</b> <b>contract),</b> and gaining wider acceptance for it. As we have seen, South Africa formally imported the doctrine of insurable interest from England, but in 1977 the legislature repealed the colonial ordinances which had achieved this. The Appellate Division, in Mutual and Federal v Oudtshoorn Municipality, took their repeal to mean that the Roman-Dutch law of insurance is now the common law for insurance.|$|E
50|$|The {{term was}} a {{classification}} developed in later medieval Roman law {{to cover all}} contracts whose fulfilment depended on chance, including gambling, insurance, speculative investment and life annuities. Many modern forms of derivatives and options may in some cases also be considered <b>aleatory</b> <b>contracts.</b> For example, the French civil code contains a chapter on <b>aleatory</b> <b>contracts,</b> with specific provisions for gaming (gambling) and life annuities.|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between banking {{deposits and loans}} remains a contentious topic. While the defense of a 100 percent reserve clause to eliminate fractional reserves has commonly been asserted on economic and ethical grounds, new legal arguments found in Jesús Huerta de Soto (2006) remain largely ignored. We address Michael S. Rozeff’s (2010) recent article as {{a case in point}} of this ignorance. Contrary to supporters of fractional reserve demand deposits, we show that such a contract – one treating a loan and a deposit interchangeably – is impermissible due to both established and a priori legal principles. At best, a fractional reserve demand deposit contract may be considered an <b>aleatory</b> <b>contract.</b> Based on an uncertain future event, we find this type of contract wholly incompatible with the reason individuals hold money – the mitigation of uncertainty. Despite what defenders of fractional reserve banking claim, deposit and loan contracts are distinct, and may not be contractually melded together...|$|E
40|$|The physician-patient {{relationship}} {{has changed over}} time: {{in the nineteenth century}} it was characterised by professional dominance; in the twentieth century a unilateral <b>aleatory</b> <b>contract</b> came into being between the professional and his client; it is expected that in the future medical practice will come to be based on individual genetic predisposition, where treatment will precede early symptoms and illnesses will be treated with personalised remedies and medicines. Until now, government policies have mainly aimed at safeguarding patients’ health; today evermore attention is being paid to patients’ right to self-determination. Society’s perception of the physician has also changed: the physician is no longer seen as the custodian of an absolute knowledge, but rather as a service provider and the patient has come {{to be seen as a}} consumer. Over the last decades patients’ protection has seen the rule of informed consent and efforts to favour patients under the law. Europe now fears that this favouritism will eventually trigger a crisis similar to the one which overwhelmed the U. S. A: in the U. S. A. the consequence was the halting of the lay standard in favour of the professional one; in Europe a defensive practice has come into being. This practice is based on complex risk management procedures and strict protocols consisting of many forms and very detailed information leaflets. Today, these two aspects - the preference of patients’ right to self-determination and defensive practices - are the main reasons behind the physician-patient relationship transformation. Traditional one-way physician-patient communication is being replaced by dialogue. The move is one from information to counselling. The paternalist approach of traditional medicine has already been replaced by the principle of physician-patient cooperation, which is a prelude to modern “talking medicine”. This paper focuses on describing this medical approach change and the juridical and practical implications that come with it...|$|E
2500|$|Because {{contracts}} {{of insurance}} {{have many features}} in common with wagers, insurance contracts are often distinguished under law as agreements in which either party {{has an interest in}} the [...] "bet-upon" [...] outcome beyond the specific financial terms. e.g.: a [...] "bet" [...] with an insurer on whether one's house will burn down is not gambling, but rather insurance — as the homeowner has an obvious interest in the continued existence of his/her home independent of the purely financial aspects of the [...] "bet" [...] (i.e., the insurance policy). Nonetheless, both insurance and gambling contracts are typically considered <b>aleatory</b> <b>contracts</b> under most legal systems, though they are subject to different types of regulation.|$|R
40|$|The late Ernest Coumet devoted {{some ground}} {{breaking}} articles to {{the origins of}} a mathematics of decision, respectively published in 1965 and 1970 : Le problème des partis avant Pascal and La théorie du hasard est-elle née par hasard 3. Assuming that the so-called « points problem » had first been solved in the mid-XVIIth Century, Coumet went into great details to show the legal background of the <b>aleatory</b> <b>contracts</b> upon which Blaise Pascal built on to find a proper solution, using a set of tools that earlier writers dealing with the same problem, in the late XVth and XVIth Centuries, had not put to use. Coumet was also pointing to the sources of such a perspective, in casuistic writers of the XVIth Century such as Domingo de Soto, in whom he perceived a conceptualisation of uncertainty situations. More generally, it has been recognised that {{the growth of a}} probabilistic reasoning in the XVIIth and XVIIIth Centuries owed to the coalescence of various components, each of which had a previous history, often starting in the Middle Ages. During the last decades, the genealogies of these components have been investigated separately; these trends are now gathered in a...|$|R
40|$|As of {{the second}} half of the sixteenth century, bills of {{exchange}} gained importance in commercial finance. Consequently, the use of this legal technique also gave rise to debates in the courts of law of the Southern Low Countries. Regularly, law professors and other learned lawyers were asked for their opinion on complex legal questions regarding those bills of exchange. In their consilia, authors tried to apply the learned law (ius commune) which they studied and taught at the universities, to legal practice. Nevertheless, they also took into account statutory and customary law, and even moral theological treatises. Some of these consultations were – in most cases posthumously – published in printed volumes, thus also becoming a source of law for the debates in the seventeenth century, both in the Spanish Low Countries and in the Dutch Republic. These contemporary sources of ‘learned legal practice’ offer us an excellent insight into some of the most pressing legal issues of commercial and financial practice in the late sixteenth century. The current paper proposes a discussion of some of those consilia on the basis of three short capita selecta. (i) A first section deals with the legal status of a drawee-acceptant of a bill of exchange. It will be discussed how Johannes Wamesius (1524 - 1590), based on mercantile practice (ex more mercatorum), interpreted the acceptance by the drawee as a consent to a delegation (delegatio) with all that that entails. Once accepted, a drawee could no longer revoke his acceptance, as the Brabantian lawyer Henricus Kinschotius (1541 - 1608) argued, even if the drawer did not respect his own obligations. Interestingly, he compared the drawee to a personal surety (fideiussor). (ii) The second section analyzes debates on the alleged usurious nature of certain practices regarding bills of exchange, like the sale of a bill of exchange at a discount before its date of maturity. Particular attention will also be paid to the permissibility of an incrementum retournii or ritorno in bills of exchange drawn in Antwerp and payable at one of the Lyons fairs. (iii) Finally, the paper discusses two consilia by the famous law professor and diplomat Elbertus Leoninus (1520 - 1598) on <b>aleatory</b> <b>contracts,</b> cloaked as security agreements in order to guarantee a certain exchange rate. Those consilia particularly entailed discussions on the way of setting the rate of exchange at the Lyons fairs. status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRisk {{allocation}} in contracts is {{an important}} issue for both economics and law. It questions the theorerical, methodological, empirical foundations of economic and legal analysis. It also offers a valuable ground for comparative legal-economic inquiry. The article aims at providing some insights into that general perpective, and proceeds with an articulation of theoretical and empirical analysis. The paper first offers a critical analysis of some key economic basis hypothesis on law, contract law and legal institutions, notably the courts. It concentrates on various componants of the New Institutional Economics stream that are {{something to do with the}} notion of contractual incompletedness. The emphasis is put on two central issues : the contract-institutions relations, and the scope of incompleteness as a guide for empirical research into the economic dimensions of contract law. The second part of the article compares and evaluates the significance of the economic concept of incompletedness and theFrench legal notion of imprévision, which relates to a notion that the administrative courts have set-up to decide cases in which the occurrence of unforeseen events affects the contractual equilibria built ex ante. The analysis then moves toward the research of a legal and empirical translation of uncertainty of the future. The article argues that positive legal provisions in contract law enable co-contractors to set-up a framework in which the consequences unforeseen events can be adressed. Legal provisions such as those which relate to conditional duties, <b>aleatory</b> <b>contracts,</b> force majeure, fortious events, price revision, hardship, are examples of tools that allow a significant amount of previsibility in contractual relations, particularilly long-term contracts. We then offer an empirical analysis of a specific legal notion : the imprévision. The analysis is based on legal data, namely the French Conseil d'Etat decisions that deal with a request for compensation by the State of the economic consequences of the occurrence of unforeseen events for the suppliers. A descriptive statistical analysis is associated to a study of the doctrine that the State officials adress to contracting officers; a comparison of price determination provisions under American procurement and French law of “marchés publics” is then made. L'allocation des risques inhérents à l'exécution d'obligations dans des accords dont la temporalité est longue est une question importante, notamment pour l'économie. Or, à cet égard, il est significatif de constater que les entrées consacrées au droit administratif dans l'Encyclopedia of Law and Economics ne font pas mention des contrats administratifs, et que les entrées relatives au droit des contrats ne renvoient jamais au droit administratif. On ne peut que signaler, à ce propos, l'originalité de l'ouvrage de microéconomie des marchés publics et de la réglementation de J. -J Laffont et J. Tirole (1993). Quelles conclusions tirer de ce constat ? De notre point de vue, deux hypothèses peuvent être avancées : soit les économistes se désintéressent des contrats administratifs, soit ils les intègrent implicitement dans le même moule que les contrats de droit privé. Nous estimons que la deuxième hypothèse est la plus plausible, et nous souhaitons l'explorer ici en réfléchissant sur le fait de savoir si le droit positif des contrats privés et administratifs rend possible l'application de mêmes catégories d'analyse en matière d'allocation des risques. Cette question appelera naturellement une réflexion sur la signification et la portée empirique de la notion économique d'incomplétude des contrats...|$|R
