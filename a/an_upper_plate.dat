40|$|Metamorphic core {{complexes}} (MCC) are formations of deep basement {{metamorphic rocks}} (lower plate) exhumed through <b>an</b> <b>upper</b> <b>plate</b> of younger sedimentary and igneous supracrustal deposits. Though the mechanism for MCC formation is poorly understood, they {{are thought to}} occur in regions of broad lithospheric extension and may represent several different stages of orogenic stresses. These paleostresses, both regional and local, can be recorded by twinning of syntectonic calcite. Prior to this study, the calcite strain-gage technique has never been applied to MCCs. The Liaonan metamorphic core complex (LMCC), located on {{the southern end of}} the Liaodong Peninsula in Liaoning Province, Northeast China, is part of a suite of similar MCC structures across the North China tectonic block. It is a Cretaceous-aged Cordilleran-style complex, characterized by a WNW-dipping master detachment fault on its western side, a mylonitic detachment zone within an Archean lower plate, Cretaceous synextensional granodioritic intrusions throughout the structure, and <b>an</b> <b>upper</b> <b>plate</b> of Neoproterozoic and Paleozoic sedimentary rocks, capped by a Cretaceous supradetachment basin. Foliation orientations and kinematic indicators within the mylonitic shear zone suggest WNW-ESE extension with some local variation. Twinned calcite grains in synextensional veins and fault gouge (n = 575) of the LMCC preserve subhorizontal MCC-axis-parallel-shortening (with some variability to local detachment fault orientation) and vertical extension. Strain magnitudes tend to be greater in the detachment samples and smaller in the upper plate and syntectonic supradetachment basin samples. A lack of strain overprint is represented by small amounts of negative expected values in the dataset (NEVs). The differential stress responsible for twinning is about - 375 bars throughout the entire sample suite indicating shallow calcite deformation. Vertical extension preserved in our twin results suggests MCC emplacement was strongly influenced by diapiric magmatism. This is likely characteristic of rapid late-stage MCC exhumation, where relative regional extension is still perpendicular to a NNE-SSW shortening direction but a strong buoyancy component recorded by extensional strain ultimately drives the lower plate to its final position at the surface...|$|E

40|$|In {{subduction}} modeling, {{interactions between}} the down‐going slab and neighboring plates are often neglected. Here, we have modeled the interactions between a subducting and <b>an</b> <b>upper</b> <b>plate</b> and show that, in such a system, subducting plate advance towards the stationary margin accommodates convergence. When interactions with the lower mantle are included in this system, deeper penetration of the slab allows transient increases in subduction rates and weakening in the upper plate. However this does not last long enough to mobilize the trench away from the upper plate. The constraints imposed by the convergence of major plates are more effective in reorganizing the tectonic style, by hampering, or even locking, the subducting plate motions resulting in sustained rollback and back‐arc opening over large time periods.

40|$|We {{document}} {{a correlation}} between along-strike variation in interseismic coupling depth on subduction interfaces, and the upper plate tectonic stress state in New Zealand, Vanuatu, and southwest Japan. Deep interseismic coupling occurs where the upper plate stress regime is contractional to transpressional, whereas a shallowing of interseismic coupling occurs where there is an along-strike shift to back-arc or intra-arc extension. To explain this relationship, we draw on theoretical studies suggesting that the fluid pressure state within the upper plate and on the subduction interface has a strong control on {{the depth of the}} transition from frictional to viscous behavior. Lower fluid pressures (e. g., close to hydrostatic) are expected where the over-riding plate is undergoing tectonic extension, whereas higher fluid pressures (e. g., close to lithostatic) are expected where the over-riding plate experiences long-term (e. g., > 105 yr) tectonic shortening. Low fluid pressures within the upper plate may lead to a shallow frictional to viscous transition compared to <b>an</b> <b>upper</b> <b>plate</b> that is highly overpressured.

We use morphological structures in multibeam bathymetric data across the forearc to identify {{the extent of the}} seismogenic zone (SZ). The updip limit of the SZ is associated with a distinct slope break at the seawordmost part of the outer arc high off Java and the Lesser Sunda islands. In contrast, the slope break is rather indistinctive off large parts of Sumatra. The inner wedge shows differences along the Indonesian margin. Uniform trench-parallel ridge structures lie off Java and Lesser Sunda islands, whereas non-uniform trench-parallel outer arc high structures consisting of several broad tectonic ridges off Sumatra shape the seaward part of the inner wedge. The landward termination of the inner wedge ridge structure and <b>a</b> shallow <b>upper</b> <b>plate</b> mantle at <b>a</b> depth range of 15 - 25 km at Java and the Lesser Sunda islands coincide with the downdip limit of the seismogenic zone.

Sunda Strait marks a transition zone between the Sumatra and Java margins. We find the differences along the Sunda margin, especially the wider extent of the seismogenic zone off Sumatra, producing larger earthquakes, to result from the interaction of different age and subduction direction of the oceanic plate.

40|$|Oblique {{subduction}} {{zones are}} complex settings where the simultaneous action of trench-normal and trench-parallel components of convergence can produce heterogeneous deformational {{pattern of the}} <b>upper</b> <b>plate</b> and affect the accretional/erosional behavior of the plate margin. Here we present three-dimensional thermomechanical numerical models that highlight some processes occurring in the early history (15 – 20 Myr) of intraoceanic oblique subduction zones, which so far represent the less studied case. These models have been compared with a simulation of a slab sinking under a continental plate. We test subduction starting in oceans floored by two classes of lithosphere: layered (fast spreading oceans) and serpentinite rich (slow to ultraslow spreading oceans). Two main domains develop along the margin of both type of oceanic plates: (a) a domain with a mostly stable trench, <b>a</b> shortening <b>upper</b> <b>plate,</b> characterized by {{the formation of a}} topographic relief, and (b) a domain with retreating trench and extending <b>upper</b> <b>plate.</b> In general, we observed that varying the subduction obliquity, the margin could either (i) record an erosional to a balanced accretion/erosion regime or (ii) be characterized by a predominant balanced accretion/erosion regime. In both cases, even where the sediment amount in the trench is high, the <b>upper</b> <b>plate</b> experiences tectonic erosion. We suggest that the formation of topographic reliefs on the fore arc is possibly related to the low amount of sediment in the trench, affecting interplate friction and promoting the <b>upper</b> <b>plate</b> indentation against the slab.

Based on stratigraphic observation we characterized the fault evolution in four intervals over the last ca. 35 ka. During the first three intervals the fault had a steady slip rate of 0. 61 ± 0. 26 m/ka. The fourth interval is delineated by the last vertical fault slip and the accumulation of un-deformed hillslope deposits after ca. 3. 3 ka and has a slip rate of 0. 22 ± 0. 06 m/ka.

The results show that placing vents on the plates can be very effective for enhancing heat transfer from the heat sources. For a particular array of heat sources and vents on the plates, the Nusselt number has the highest magnitude in comparison with other geometries, and consequently, the maximum heat transfer is available...|$|E
40|$|The Sheeprock Mountains {{are part}} of a horst of Proterozoic, Paleozoic and Cenozoic {{sedimentary}} and igneous rocks located in the transitional region between the Cordilleran fold-thrust belt and the hinterland in the Basin-Range province of west-central Utah. Prominent structural elements in the Sheeprock Mountains are the Sheeprock Thrust, juxtaposing Proterozoic rocks above Paleozoic ones with a stratigraphic separation exceeding 10 km; the Pole Canyon Thrust, thought to be <b>an</b> <b>upper</b> <b>plate</b> imbrication of the Sheeprock Thrust; the Pole Canyon Anticline, a recumbent fold vergent to the northeast and cut by the Pole Canyon Thrust; the east-northeast-striking Indian Springs (tear) Fault; and two low-angle normal faults (the Harker and Lion Hill Faults) which together account for stratigraphic omission of several kilometres. The Pole Canyon Anticline is thought to have developed in the late Mesozoic during propagation of the thrusts parallel to the Indian Springs Fault, and this transport direction is corroborated by minor structures. Fault geometry suggests that the Harker and Lion Hill Faults are younger than the thrusts and probably of late Cenozoic age, although some mid-Cenozoic or even earlier displacement cannot be entirely ruled out. My [The author's] preferred interpretation of the structural history of the Sheep rock Mountains is consistent with minimal regional extension before the mid-Cenozoic and with the view that crustal shortening in the fold-thrust belt is for the most part unrelated to hinterland extension...|$|E
40|$|A reliability-based {{optimization}} (RBO) {{procedure is}} developed {{and applied to}} minimize the weight of eight fiber-reinforced polymer composite bridge deck panel configurations. The method utilizes interlinked finite element, optimization, and reliability analysis procedures to solve the weight minimization problem with a deterministic strength constraint and two probabilistic deflection constraints. Panels are composed of <b>an</b> <b>upper</b> face <b>plate,</b> lower face plate, and a grid of interior stiffeners. Different panel depths and stiffener layouts are considered. Sensitivity analyses are conducted to identify significant design and random variables. Optimization design variables are panel component ply thicknesses while random variables include load and material resistance parameters. It was found that panels were deflection-governed, with the optimization algorithm yielding little improvement for shallow panels, but significant weight savings for deeper panels. The best design resulted in deep panels with close stiffener spacing to minimize local <b>upper</b> face <b>plate</b> deformations under the imposed traffic (wheel) loads...|$|R
40|$|Strain {{accumulation}} measurements {{adjacent to}} the San Andreas fault have indicated that the strain accumulation zone extends only a few tens of kms away from the fault. While the restricted zone of cyclic accumulation and release of elastic energy adjacent to major strike-slip faults {{has been attributed to}} a viscoelastic asthenosphere's damping effect, the narrowness of the San Andreas zone implies a thickness of the lithosphere that, at 10 - 20 km, may not be consistent with the relatively low surface heat flow measurements obtained. It is presently proposed that <b>an</b> <b>upper</b> elastic <b>plate</b> extends to a depth of 15 km, and that beneath this <b>upper</b> elastic <b>plate</b> is <b>a</b> soft, intracrustal asthenosphere exhibiting a viscoelastic behavior. A second elastic layer lies under this, followed by the asthenosphere. It is shown that the damping due to the intracrustal asthenosphere can explain the observed narrow zone of cyclic strain accumulation and release...|$|R
