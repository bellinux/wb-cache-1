25|$|The Roman {{numbering}} scheme of Uranus' moons {{was in a}} state of flux for a considerable time. Sir William Herschel thought he had discovered up to six moons <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> ring. For nearly fifty years, Herschel's instrument was the only one the moons had been seen with. In the 1840s, better instruments and a more favourable position of Uranus in the sky led to sporadic indications of satellites additional to Titania and Oberon. Publications hesitated between William Herschel's designations (where Titania and Oberon are Uranus II and IV) and William Lassell's (where they are sometimes I and II). With the confirmation of Ariel and Umbriel, Lassell numbered the moons I through IV from Uranus outward, and this finally stuck.|$|E

40|$|There {{is quite}} wide-spread {{agreement}} about {{the relevance of}} pattern Prägnanz (Koffka, 1935) {{with respect to the}} human interpretation of visual patterns. There is less agreement about whether pattern Prägnanz is based solely on pattern information (static) or also {{on the history of the}} perceiver (dynamic). In Van Leeuwen and Van den Hof (1991), experimental data concerning serial patterns are presented within the framework of the dynamic-network approach initiated by Buffart (1986, 1987). These experimental data are claimed to give evidence against the static-coding approach initiated by Leeuwenberg (1969, 1971). In the present paper, however, I show first that Buffart's theoretical basis is incorrect, and that in fact Leeuwenberg's static-coding approach is the basis for the dynamic-network approach. Second, I show that those experimental data rather give evidence in favor of the static-coding approach, by using those same data for a test of the most recent static-coding model (Van der Helm & Leeuwenberg, 1991; Van der Helm, Van Lier, & Leeuwenberg, 1992). Finally, I propose a reconciliation between the two approaches, in the sense that the dynamic-network model could be shaped in such a way that it yields <b>a</b> simulation, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>even</b> <b>an</b> enrichment, of the static-coding model. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Summary The aim of {{this thesis}} is to give an insight into how hormones in general, and {{estrogen}} specifically, regulate spermatogenesis in zebrafish. First, information on the spermatogenic process, the somatic and germinal cell types involved in this process and the main hormonal substances that regulate spermatogenesis, is reviewed. This information {{can be found in}} chapters one, two and three. Then, the research that is currently carried out at the Developmental Biology group at Utrecht University is introduced in chapter four. The questions, or problems, that are still open for investigation are presented. The information and research on the topic of hormonal control of spermatogenesis is not only of fundamental interest, but also has an applied background, which will be discussed as well. Chapter five presents how this research may contribute to gain knowledge that may yield <b>a</b> healthier environment <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>even</b> <b>an</b> improved economy. In the concluding chapter six, the experiment that was carried out during my internship is described. This experiment was performed with the objective to clarify if the estrogen effects on spermatogenesis in zebrafish in vivo are direct effects on the testis or indirect effects via feedback mechanisms on the brain and pituitary level. This was done by incubating testis tissue with estrogen in vitro using a primary tissue culture system, in order to compare the results with those obtained in vivo...|$|R
