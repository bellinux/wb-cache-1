5|$|When the German Operation Nordwind {{offensive}} threatened Strasbourg, Pash {{ordered all}} captured documents to be removed. Papers indicating {{the nature of}} the <b>Alsos</b> Mission were removed or destroyed. Although Strasbourg was not abandoned by the Allies, and ultimately did not fall, the <b>Alsos</b> Mission departed the city on 8 January 1945. Pash even ordered an evacuation plan to be prepared for the <b>Alsos</b> Mission's main headquarters in Paris. The embarrassing series of intelligence failures that had led up to the Battle of the Bulge cast doubts on the <b>Alsos</b> Mission's own findings. A four-man team under Eckman was sent to investigate a suspiciously devastating V-2 explosion near Antwerp, and Fred Wardenburg had to confirm {{that it was not a}} small nuclear explosion. Rumors that Germany had an atomic bomb persisted as late as March 1945.|$|R

5|$|<b>Alsos</b> {{interviewed the}} Italian Minister for Communications, the Chief of Naval Ordnance, {{the staff of}} the Italian Naval Academy, and Italian {{scientists}} at the University of Naples, and examined what captured technical documents could be found. There was little information about developments in northern Italy and Germany. The <b>Alsos</b> Mission was attached to Colonel George Smith's S-Force. Built around a Royal Air Force ground reconnaissance squadron equipped with armored cars, this unit contained American, British, French, and Italian technical specialists of various kinds who would enter Rome {{on the heels of the}} advancing Allied forces. The expectation that Rome would soon be captured proved premature, and by March 1944 most of the <b>Alsos</b> Mission had returned to the United States. The <b>Alsos</b> Mission had gathered little of value about nuclear matters, but submitted detailed reports about German rockets and guided missiles.|$|R

Mumma became one of four naval officers assigned to the <b>Alsos</b> Mission, the others being Jacob Pieter Den Hartog, Wendell Roop and Henry A. [...] "Packy" [...] Schade. The naval section of <b>Alsos</b> would investigate German naval technologies, but the main objective of the <b>Alsos</b> Mission was to learn all it could about the German nuclear energy project. All members of the mission had ultra secret security clearances, but none had been involved with the development of the atomic bomb.|$|R
