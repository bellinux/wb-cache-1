5|$|On 6 October 1965, Brady met 17-year-old {{apprentice}} engineer Edward Evans at Manchester Central {{railway station}} and {{invited him to}} his home at 16 Wardle Brook Avenue in Hattersley, Cheshire, where Brady beat him to death with <b>an</b> <b>axe.</b>|$|E
5|$|After much deliberation, Raskolnikov sneaks into Alyona Ivanovna's apartment, {{where he}} murders her with <b>an</b> <b>axe.</b> He also kills her half-sister, Lizaveta, {{who happens to}} stumble upon {{the scene of the}} crime. Shaken by his actions, Raskolnikov manages to steal only a handful of items and a small purse, leaving much of the pawn-broker's wealth untouched. Raskolnikov then flees and, due to a series of coincidences, manages to leave unseen and undetected.|$|E
5|$|In Pittsburgh, two FBI agents, Angus Stedman (Lawrence LeJohn) and James Leeds (Kevin McClatchy), are {{observing a}} house when Leeds falls asleep. When he awakes, he discovers that {{the front door}} of the house is open. The two agents {{investigate}} and stumble upon a room filled with dead bodies. Suddenly, a man wielding <b>an</b> <b>axe</b> and possessing a third eye murders both agents with a blow to the head.|$|E

5|$|Less {{than five}} minutes later and {{apparently}} without reason, López took Reyes Moore by her hair and stabbed her. Her daughter {{ran out of the}} shop to tell her brother. When they got back, they saw López taking their severely injured mother to a tree trunk in his backyard, where he proceeded to decapitate her with <b>an</b> <b>axe.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{several other}} supernatural {{entities}} were also {{held responsible for}} bringing hail and torrential rains, when the entity is not explicitly named, it is often impossible to conclude to which the magical measures apply. There was, for example, a custom used when the approach of a thunderstorm was perceived: to bring a {{table in front of}} the house, and to put bread, salt, a knife with a black sheath, and <b>an</b> <b>axe</b> with its edge directed skywards on the table. By another custom, a fireplace trivet with its legs directed skywards, knives, forks, and the stub of the Slava candle were put on the table.|$|E
5|$|As well as food, camping equipment, and dog-care gear, mushers {{must carry}} <b>an</b> <b>axe,</b> a cold-weather {{sleeping}} bag, {{a pair of}} snowshoes, veterinary records, Quest promotional material, a cooker, and eight booties per dog. Included in the required promotional material are numerous event covers intended to reflect the Quest's ancestry as a mail route. One unusual rule requires mushers to immediately butcher any game animal killed during the race. This rule was applied in 1993, when a musher was attacked by a moose and killed it to protect himself.|$|E
50|$|The first type is <b>a</b> bearded <b>axe</b> (lower side of {{the blade}} is elongated) with a flat upper side. It resembles <b>a</b> battle <b>axe.</b> <b>A</b> knob-like {{protrusion}} is usually present on the lower {{side of the}} axe. These axes have been decorated with circles, believed to represent celestial bodies.|$|R

5|$|Before {{heading out}} of Brazil on a mid-1991 European tour, Sepultura {{performed}} one more concert in São Paulo, the country's largest city. It {{took place at}} Praça Charles Miller (in front of Estádio do Pacaembu), on May 11. Local military police expected 10,000 to attend. 30,000 showed up instead, making crowd management nearly impossible. Six people were hurt, 18 were arrested and one was murdered with <b>an</b> <b>axe.</b> A week before, a young man was stabbed to death at a Ramones concert in São Paulo, during a brawl between headbangers and skinheads. These events were followed by a huge mainstream media backlash throughout the country against rock music.|$|E
5|$|However, in 1955, in {{a similar}} case {{involving}} another woman, Mrs. Clarice B. Covert, who had killed her husband in England with <b>an</b> <b>axe,</b> Federal District Court Judge Edward A. Tamm ruled that civilians who accompany military forces overseas could not be imprisoned by military courts. The two cases, Kinsella v. Krueger and Reid v. Covert, went to the US Supreme Court, which affirmed that military trials of civilians were indeed constitutional, only to reverse itself a year later {{in a review of}} the decisions. Dorothy was released, and went to live with Krueger in San Antonio.|$|E
5|$|Juste {{primarily}} attacks {{at close}} quarters using the series' traditional whip weapon, the Vampire Killer. It can be brandished to deflect projectile attacks, reminiscent of Simon Belmont's {{usage of the}} weapon in Super Castlevania IV. A variety of ranged sub-weapons—holy water, a dagger, a holy book, a cross, a gem, <b>an</b> <b>axe,</b> and a thunder gauntlet—are available, one {{of which can be}} carried at any given time and combined with one of the five spell books—Fire Book, Ice Book, Bolt Book, Wind Book, and the Summoning Tome—hidden throughout the castle to create a magical attack. Casting a spell renders the player character invincible for a moment.|$|E

50|$|From the 14th through 17th centuries, {{shepherd}}'s axes {{were brought}} into Central Europe along the Carpathian Mountains and Dinaric Mountains by shepherd migrants called Vlachs. These sticks were mostly used by shepherds as versatile tools, providing <b>a</b> small <b>axe,</b> <b>a</b> supplemental hammer and a walking stick. Although <b>a</b> shepherd's <b>axe</b> {{could not be}} used to effectively cut down heavy trees, it was still able to cut smaller branches.|$|R
5|$|More killings take place. Tilde, a {{beautiful}} lesbian journalist, is murdered {{at her home}} along with her lover Marion. Maria, the young daughter of Neal's landlord, is later hacked {{to death with a}} axe after discovering the killer's lair. Neal notices that TV interviewer Christiano Berti has an unusually intense interest in his work. That night, Neal and his Italian assistant Gianni watch Berti's house. Gianni approaches the house alone {{to get a better view}} and sees an assailant hack Berti to death with <b>an</b> <b>axe.</b> However, Gianni is unable to see the murderer's face. He returns to Neal to find the novelist has been knocked unconscious on the lawn.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, trees produce {{wood with}} a wavy grain, greatly {{increasing}} the value for decorative veneers. The wood is a medium weight for a hardwood, weighing 630kg per cubic metre. It {{is a traditional}} wood for use in making the backs, necks and scrolls of violins. The wood is often marketed as rippled sycamore. Whistles {{can be made from}} straight twigs when the rising sap allows the bark to be separated, and these, and sycamore branches, are used in customs associated with early May in Cornwall. The wood is used for fuel, being easy to saw and to split with <b>an</b> <b>axe,</b> producing a hot flame and good embers when burnt.|$|E
5|$|The myth of Eshmun {{was related}} by {{the sixth century}} Syrian Neoplatonist philosopher Damascius and ninth century Patriarch of Constantinople, Photius. They recount that Eshmun, {{a young man from}} Beirut, was hunting in the woods when Astarte saw him and was {{stricken}} by his beauty. She harassed him with her amorous pursuit until he emasculated himself with <b>an</b> <b>axe</b> and died. The grieving goddess revived Eshmun and transported him to the heavens where she made him into a god of heaven.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> shepherd's <b>axe</b> is <b>a</b> light <b>axe</b> with <b>a</b> {{long and}} {{straight}} wooden shaft, {{often with a}} metal butt. The {{length of the shaft}} is usually slightly more than 1 metre. The shafts were usually engraved as their owners had plenty of time for crafting.|$|R

5|$|While Marge and the {{children}} are enjoying dinner, Homer begins pursuing the family with <b>an</b> <b>axe</b> and Bart uses his powers to call Willie, who immediately runs to the family's rescue, abandoning his portable television in the snow in the process. Homer kills him by striking {{him in the back}} with the axe. Homer pursues his family outside but as he is about to kill them, Lisa discovers Willie's abandoned television. Homer's insanity gradually decreases and the family freezes in the snow as they are watching.|$|E
5|$|As {{detailed}} in the De Ceremoniis, the Droungarios of the Watch always accompanied the Emperor {{and was a}} frequent participant in various imperial ceremonies, often accompanied by his principal aide, the akolouthos. His ceremonial dress is indicated as the skaramangion tunic and a red sagion cloak, while on some occasions he bore a sword, a mace and <b>an</b> <b>axe.</b> The latter weapon was highly unusual for a Byzantine officer, and the French scholar Rodolphe Guilland suggests that this was connected to his command of foreign troops via the akolouthos (who later notably became {{the commander of the}} axe-bearing Varangian Guard). In the 10th century, when several holders of the post were scions of the most prominent families of the military aristocracy, including Eustathios Argyros, John Kourkouas and Manuel Kourtikes, the droungarios occupied the 36th place in the imperial hierarchy and usually held the senior court dignities of anthypatos, patrikios or prōtospatharios.|$|E
5|$|Ellen {{attempts}} to flee but is severely beaten by the possessed Bruce, who throws {{her around the}} cabin. While being strangled, Ellen picks up Bruce's mutilated hand which is still holding the dagger found from before, and she uses it to stab Bruce. A large amount of blood is expended by Bruce, who lies motionless for a moment, only to then continue his assault on Ellen. Ellen mutilates Bruce's body even further with <b>an</b> <b>axe,</b> chopping off nearly every limb from the writhing body. Severely disturbed by the things she has witnessed, Ellen rocks back and forth muttering to herself. The corpse of Scotty suddenly springs up, before turning towards the oblivious Ellen, ready to attack. The screen then cuts to black, leaving the fate of Ellen ambiguous.|$|E

5|$|Following the 1992 race, {{controversy}} erupted {{when the}} Alaska {{board of directors}} of Yukon Quest International informed the Yukon board that they were considering dropping the Yukon half of the Quest because Yukon officials did not meet fundraising goals. Alaska officials also believed {{it would be easier to}} manage an Alaska-only race. A crisis was averted when the Yukon board of directors agreed to raise more money and the two sides formed a joint board of directors. The 1993 race was run as usual, but Jeff Mann had a more eventful race than most. When a moose attacked his dog team, he was forced to kill it with <b>an</b> <b>axe,</b> then butcher it according to Quest rules. Later, he was penalized 90minutes for borrowing a reporter's head lantern. Finally, after the conclusion of the race, he was fined half his winnings when his dogs tested positive for ibuprofen.|$|E
5|$|From the Bronze Age {{there are}} {{extensive}} examples of rock art. These include cup and ring marks, a central depression carved into stone, surrounded by rings, sometimes not completed. These are common elsewhere in Atlantic Europe {{and have been}} found on natural rocks and isolated stones across Scotland. The most elaborate sets of markings are in western Scotland, particularly in the Kilmartin district. The representations of <b>an</b> <b>axe</b> and a boat at the Ri Cruin Cairn in Kilmartin, and a boat pecked into Wemyss Cave, {{are believed to be}} the oldest known representations of real objects that survive in Scotland. Carved spirals have also been found on the cover stones of burial cists in Lanarkshire and Kincardine.|$|E
5|$|Homer buys {{a matter}} {{transporter}} from Professor Frink. That night, Bart, after experimentations involving the family pets, {{steps into the}} teleporter with a fly on his arm, thinking that he will become a mutant superhero. He comes out with his normal head, but with the fly's body whilst the fly has his body. Bart enlists the help of Lisa. However, she is chased by the fly and cornered in the kitchen. Bart tries to stop the fighting, but is quickly eaten by the fly. Lisa then sees {{this as an opportunity}} to undo the process and pushes the fly into the teleporter. Bart comes out the other end, now with his head back on his real body. Homer then pulls out <b>an</b> <b>axe</b> and angrily chases Bart for using the device.|$|E
