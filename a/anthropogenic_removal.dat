40|$|Abstract – Three plots were sampled {{along an}} altitudinal {{gradient}} {{in the upper}} Susa Valley (Piedmont, Italy) on a northeastern slope from 1800 to 2300 m a. s. l. In order to reconstruct recent dynamics at this altitudinal range various techniques were used. Dendroecological methods were used to reconstruct the age structures of tree populations. Growth dynamics were investigated both by observing Basal Area Increment (BAI) in old and dominant trees and by comparing the BAIs within a given cambial age class in different time periods. Historical documents were analyzed as an independent data source to explain changes in establishment rate. As far as the tree establishment at the forestline and at the treeline is concerned we observed three distinct periods: during the first one (1850 – 1930) larch establishment was reduced or prevented because of heavy grazing and the stone pine establishment was almost null because of the grazing and of the human <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>removal.</b> During the second one (1930 – 1960) the past heavy grazing followed by periods of moderate grazing favored the larch establishment; stone pine establishment was still prevented both by grazing and by <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>removal.</b> Finally the third period (1960 –present) has been the period of massive stone pine regeneration. The growth rates of stone pine and larch have increased in the last decades: individuals in the 100 -, 150 - and 200 -year age classes grow more rapidly in present times {{as compared to the}} previous two centuries. In the same time younger trees (1 – 50 years old) showed a decline in growth because the current stands are denser and the young and suppressed trees have worse growth conditions respect the previous open stands. An analysis of all the data taken together in the present study argues in favor {{of the fact that the}} tree establishment, and more in general the forest dynamic, has been mainly controlled by human land-use an...|$|E
40|$|The {{morphology}} of ~ 45, 000 bedforms from 13 multibeam bathymetry surveys {{was used}} as a proxy for identifying net bedload sediment transport directions and pathways throughout the San Francisco Bay estuary and adjacent outer coast. The spatially-averaged shape asymmetry of the bedforms reveals distinct pathways of ebb and flood transport. Additionally, the region-wide, ebb-oriented asymmetry of 5 % suggests net seaward-directed transport within the estuarine-coastal system, with significant seaward asymmetry at the mouth of San Francisco Bay (11 %), through the northern reaches of the Bay (7 - 8 %), and among the largest bedforms (21 % for lambda > 50 m). This general indication for the net transport of sand to the open coast strongly suggests that <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>removal</b> of sediment from the estuary, particularly along clearly defined seaward transport pathways, will limit the supply of sand to chronically eroding, open-coast beaches. The bedform asymmetry measurements significantly agree (up to ~ 76 %) with modeled annual residual transport directions derived from a hydrodynamically-calibrated numerical model, and the orientation of adjacent, flow-sculpted seafloor features such as mega-flute structures, providing a comprehensive validation of the technique. The methods described in this paper to determine well-defined, cross-validated sediment transport pathways can be applied to estuarine-coastal systems globally where bedforms are present. The results can inform and improve regional sediment management practices to more efficiently utilize often limited sediment resources and mitigate current and future sediment supply-related impacts...|$|E
40|$|Semi-arid {{ecosystems}} in the Mediterranean basin show a {{high degree}} of resilience, despite thousands of years of human disturbance. It has been suggested that this resilience is facilitated by a landscape structure that consists of woody vegetation and intershrub patches of crusted soil. We hypothesized that the woody vegetation patches have two main properties that increase the resilience of the ecosystem. The first property is the capability to accumulate water, and we hypothesized that this continues to function after anthropogenic disturbances to the shrubs. This was field-tested with a rainfall simulator by comparing the amounts of runoff and soil erosion generated by crusted intershrub patches, intact shrub patches, and disturbed shrub patches. The second property is the ability of the woody vegetation to recover after disturbances. This was tested by measuring the recovery rate of the woody vegetation, during 2 consecutive years after canopy removal. Intact and disturbed shrub patches generated similar amounts of runoff and soil erosion to one another, and much lower than crusted intershrub patches, and both kinds of shrub patches had deeper water infiltration. These results suggest that the accumulation of water under the shrub is due to surface and sub-surface soil properties, and not canopy properties. After <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>removal</b> of the woody vegetation canopy, most of the individuals regrew. These combined results suggest that the ecosystem can remain resilient to certain anthropogenic disturbances by virtue of ecosystem engineering and fast recovery by woody vegetation patches that act to conserve resources and to impede their leakage from the ecosystem.

40|$|Harbour seals {{were counted}} {{along the entire}} Norwegian coast at known {{moulting}} haulout sites in the period mid-August to early September 2003 - 2006. In 2003 - 2005, almost all known moulting areas from Finnmark to Vestfold counties were covered by aerial photo surveys flown at altitudes of approximately 800 - 900 ft (243 - 274 m), and at low tide (± 2 hours). Surveys in the Østfold County were flown in 2003 - 2006 at 300 ft (91 m), and the small tidal amplitudes permitted counts {{to be carried out}} irrespective of the tidal cycle. In some sub-areas, two or three independent surveys were conducted. Visual counts using binoculars from smaller boats and islands were carried out in some selected areas. The surveys revealed a total minimum population of 6, 705 harbour seals in Norwegian waters. Harbour seals were most abundant in the Nordland and Sør-Trøndelag counties with minimum estimates of approximately 2, 500 and 1, 500 seals, respectively. The presented minimum estimate is approximately 800 seals lower than an estimate obtained in a comparable study carried out during the moult in 1996 - 1999.

Small {{cetaceans}} (dolphins and porpoises) face serious anthropogenic threats in coastal habitats. These include bycatch in fisheries; exposure to noise, plastic and chemical pollution; disturbance from boaters; and climate change. Generating reliable abundance estimates {{is essential to}} assess sustainability of bycatch in fishing gear or {{any other form of}} <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>removals</b> and to design conservation and recovery plans for endangered species. Cetacean abundance estimates are lacking from many coastal waters of many developing countries. Lack of funding and training opportunities makes it difficult to fill in data gaps. Even if international funding were found for surveys in developing countries, building local capacity would be necessary to sustain efforts over time to detect trends and monitor biodiversity loss. Large-scale, shipboard surveys can cost tens of thousands of US dollars each day. We focus on methods to generate preliminary abundance estimates from low-cost, small-boat surveys that embrace a ‘training-while-doing’ approach to fill in data gaps while simultaneously building regional capacity for data collection. Our toolkit offers practical guidance on simple design and field data collection protocols that work with small boats and small budgets, but expect analysis to involve collaboration with a quantitative ecologist or statistician. Our audience includes independent scientists, government conservation agencies, NGOs and indigenous coastal communities, with a primary focus on fisheries bycatch. We apply our Animal Counting Toolkit to a small-boat survey in Canada’s Pacific coastal waters to illustrate the key steps in collecting line transect survey data used to estimate and monitor marine mammal abundance.

40|$|Mangrove forests, {{important}} tropical coastal habitats, are {{in decline}} worldwide {{primarily due to}} removal by humans. Changes to mangrove systems can alter ecosystem properties through direct effects on abiotic factors such as temperature, light and nutrient supply or through changes in biotic factors such as primary productivity or species composition. Despite the importance of mangroves as transitional habitats between land and sea, little research has examined changes that occur when they are cleared. We examined changes {{in a number of}} biotic and abiotic factors following the <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>removal</b> of red mangroves (Rhizophora mangle) in the Panamanian Caribbean, including algal biomass, algal diversity, algal grazing rates, light penetration, temperature, sedimentation rates and sediment organic content. In this first study examining multiple ecosystem-level effects of mangrove disturbance, we found that areas cleared of mangroves had higher algal biomass and richness than intact mangrove areas. This increase in algal biomass and richness was likely due to changes in abiotic factors (e. g. light intensity, temperature), but not biotic factors (fish herbivory). Additionally the algal and cyanobacterial genera dominating mangrove-cleared areas were rare in intact mangroves and included a number of genera that compete with coral for space on reefs. Interestingly, sedimentation rates did not differ between intact and cleared areas, but the sediments that accumulated in intact mangroves had higher organic content. These findings are the first to demonstrate that anthropogenic clearing of mangroves changes multiple biotic and abiotic processes in mangrove forests and that some of these changes may influence adjacent habitats such as coral reefs and seagrass beds. Additional research is needed to further explore the community and ecosystem-level effects of mangrove clearing and their influence on adjacent habitats, {{but it is clear that}} mangrove conservation is an important aspect of managing tropical coastal systems...|$|E
40|$|Riparian {{zones are}} {{important}} geoecosystems in fluvial topographies {{of the middle}} latitudes, because they represent the transition zones between the river plane and the river. The riparian zones are influenced by interactions of the fluvial system and the bordering landscape. However, also structure of riparian zone on their part affect processes {{as well as the}} water and nutrient balance of the neighbouring land and the streamlet. The dynamics of these interactions lie in the focus of this study. The aim of the project is to study geoecological processes as well as water and nutrient balances in riparian areas. To do so, the preferential flow paths will be analyzed. Moreover, the functions and influencing factors of riparian zones regarding water protection, such as retention and removal are scrutinized. The fieldwork for this study has been predominantly conducted in the Länenbach Valley, a small catchment on the Swiss Jura Plateau. The Rüttebach Valley in Southern Black Forest was chosen as complementary research area, since this area is characterized by different geogenic and hydrological conditions. Furthermore, comparative studies will be conducted for other rivers in the area of Basel. To study the complex processes in riparian areas different methods are used: Eight research plots are analyzed in high spatial resolution with pedological and hydrological techniques concerning their nutrient dynamics. This is monitored on a weekly basis and by single experiments. Consequently, a comparison of different riparian zones is possible. The elements of connection of the investigated catchments are first a consistent documentation of location properties and geoecological mapping of the areas. For the analysis of the surveyed data, mostly specific or even especially designed methods are used. The results of the study are manifold and extensive. For instance, to standardize geoecological mapping of riparian zones a GIS technique has been developed and tested. This technique allows documenting the spatial distribution of the structures of riparian zones more efficiently and less ambiguously. Accompanying studies concerning the meteorological and fluvial dynamics provide an insight into interactions of water input (mainly precipitation), the internal riparian dynamics, and the fluvial output of water and soluble nutrients. Based on these findings, the two investigated areas can be differentiated as follows: Vertical processes and ground water enrichment are dominant in the Länenbach Valley. By contrast, lateral discharge in the saturated zone characterizes processes in the middle reaches of Rüttebach Valley. In both areas, subterranean interactions exist between infiltration-, river- and groundwater. Soil analysis contain observations of vertical soil structures as well as small scaled lateral variation of topsoil characteristics and are performed in several smaller projects. These analyses clearly show that retention leads to enrichment, sedimentation, or intermediate storage in the outer riparian zone. Thick ground vegetation generally promotes retention. This, however, does not automatically lead to reduction respectively removal in the topsoil of riparian zones if neighbouring riparian areas are intensively used for agriculture. Besides self regulating processes auxiliary <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>removal</b> (for instance as part of mowing and pruning) is a condition for general nutrient removal out of the riparian soil. The investigation of surface processes reveals a clear picture: Small scaled wash-aquatic processes are generally decreased from the riparian area to the riparian zone. As a consequence, outer riparian zones are characterized by retention. In contrast, remobilization happens particularly at steeper bank slopes. The river bank erosion further leads to high discharge of soil sediments into the streamlet. Several investigations – such as tracer experiments, measurements of infiltration, soil moisture and soil water as well as groundwater survey – focus on subterranean flows of water and nutrients. The quintessence of these investigations is that soil infiltration and groundwater discharge are the dominant processes. If a location shows deep ground water levels the preferential lateral water movement runs “beneath the riparian zone” towards the streamlet. In that case, the riparian zone and its vegetation have a limited influence on the water quality. In the same way anthropogenic drainage limits the retention and filter function of riparian zones. The general analyses reveal considerable quantitative differences in terms of flow paths. These differences, however, do not correspond to the patterns of nutrient transport. In contrast, pronounced variations exist for different parameters: Phosphorus is predominately transported particle-bound on the surface, whereas nitrogen is mostly washed out vertically and subsequently transported laterally in the saturated zone. The dominant water flow paths are precipitation, evapotranspiration, vertical infiltration, and lateral groundwater discharge. By contrast, solid material is generally transported slowly and diffusely on the surface of riparian areas and then is predominantly discharged by bank erosion. The analysis gives strong evidence that the structures of riparian zones influence dynamics of water and nutrients. However, the influencing factors are multifarious. In addition the intensity of these factors varies over time and space. Generally, the role of geoecological functions of riparian zones is often overestimated. For example, in some cases high retention efficiency can be measured. The retention efficiency, however, may only be temporarily, as in many cases the material is subsequently remobilized laterally or washed out vertically. The environmental policy in terms of the protection of riparian zones is complex. Conflicts concerning land use in riparian areas are result of diverse interests and vague laws. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize the width of riparian zones, their structures and their care. The optimal site specific width of riparian zone can be calculated by an empirical formula which is derived from the conclusion of this study. Since the actual width of riparian zones can now be compared with the ideal width, policy makers and practitioners have an easy-to-use instrument to assess the demand concerning the size of riparian zones. Generally, the structures of riparian zones should be diverse, appropriately wide and along the river uninterrupted in order to fulfil its actual geoecological function...|$|E
40|$|Stock {{assessment}} {{models are}} {{used to determine the}} population size of fish stocks. Although stock assessment models are complex, they still make simplifying assumptions. Generally, they treat each species separately, include little, if any, spatial structure, and may not adequately quantify uncertainty. These assumptions can introduce bias and can lead to incorrect inferences. This thesis is about more realistic models and their inference. This realism may be incorporated by explicitly modelling complex processes, or by admitting our uncertainty and modelling it correctly. We develop an agent-based model that can describe fish populations as a collection of individuals which differ in their growth, maturation, migration, and mortality. The aim of this model is to better capture the richness in natural processes that determine fish abundance and subsequent population response to <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>removals.</b> However, this detail comes at considerable computational cost. A single model run can take many hours, making inference using standard methods impractical. We apply this model to New Zealand snapper (Pagurus auratus) in northern New Zealand. Next, we developed an age-structured state-space model. We suggest that this sophisticated model has the potential to better represent uncertainty in stock assessment. However, it pushes the boundaries of the current practical limits of computing and we admit that its practical application remains limited until the MCMC mixing issues that we encountered can be resolved. The processes that underpin agent-based models are complex and we may need to seek new sources of data to inform these types of models. To make a start here we derive a state-space model to estimate the path taken by individual fish from the day they are tagged to the day of their recapture. The model uses environmental information collected using pop-up satellite archival tags. We use tag recorded depth and oceanographic temperature to estimate the location at any given time. We apply this model to Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni) in the Ross Sea. Finally, to reduce the computational burden of agent-based models we use Bayesian emulation. This approach replaces the simulation model with an approximating algorithm called an emulator. The emulator is calibrated using relatively few runs of the original model. A good emulator provides a close approximation to the original model and has significant speed gains. Thus, inferences become tractable. We have made the first steps towards developing a tractable approach to fisheries modelling in complex settings through the creation of realistic models, and their emulation. With further development, Bayesian emulation could result in the increased ability to consider and evaluate innovative methods in fisheries modelling. Future avenues for application and exploration range from spatial and multi species models, to ecosystem-based models and beyond...|$|R

However, new tools {{are required for}} national and local policymakers to accurately estimate the effects of different agricultural management practices on greenhouse gas emissions and removals. The 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC, 2006), which provide methodologies for estimating national inventories of <b>anthropogenic</b> emissions and <b>removals</b> of greenhouse gases, together with the Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (IPCC, 2003), provide internationally agreed methodologies for this purpose, and include {{the possibility of using}} simulation models as higher order methods for gas inventories in the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector.

40|$|In {{spite of}} being one of the most {{relevant}} components of the biosphere, the plankton-benthos network is still poorly studied as such. This is partly due to the irregular occurrence of driving phenomena such as gelatinous plankton pulses in this realm. Gelatinous plankters rely on their life cycles and histories to exploit temporarily abundant resources with an undeniable, but often overlooked, impact on marine food webs. Dramatic increases of gelatinous filter-feeders and/or carnivores (both native and nonindigenous species) are frequently observed, and explanations of these blooms alternatively invoke ecosystem variability, climate change, unspecified <b>anthropogenic</b> perturbation or <b>removal</b> of top predators from trophic networks. Gelatinous plankters, however, are not anomalies in plankton dynamics: the recognition of the ecological importance of their pulses, based on their life cycle patterns (often involving benthic stages), is a critical breakthrough to understand the cycling diversity of plankton in space and time. The current study focuses on the many neglected aspects of the ecology and biology of gelatinous zooplankton, describes how life cycle patterns are central in marine ecology, as are the pulses of gelatinous organisms, and highlights how such a dramatic lack of knowledge can affect our understanding of the marine ecosystem as a whole...|$|R
40|$|Acidification of soil {{profiles}} from legume and N fertilized crops is {{a serious}} sustainability threat. Under tropical conditions of Northeast Thailand and Northern Australia, acidification to > 90 cm has been recorded in Stylosanthes and Leucaena based pasture systems. Acidification has also been measured in other Australian cropping systems fertilized with urea or ammonium forms of N. The major processes contributing to what could be termed <b>anthropogenic</b> acidification are <b>removal</b> of base cations in the harvested product and leaching below the root zone of nitrate from ammonium and urea N fertiliser or legumes resulting in an accumulation of protons in surfaces horizons. If prophylactic applications of lime are not undertaken, acid generation in surface horizons will progressively move down the profile inducing subsoil acidification. Subsoil acidity {{is often difficult to}} correct using conventional applications of liming products. Field experiments with pastures on Acrisols in Northeast Australia (two sites) and Northeast Thailand (one site) compared the rates of alkalisation or acidification from N applied as nitrate or as urea (Australia) or ammonium sulphate (Thailand). Soil pH increased where N was applied as nitrate and decreased where N was applied as urea or ammonium sulphate. At one of the sites in Australia, regular applications of N as nitrate at 350 kg N ha- 1 year- 1 were made to irrigated Digitaria melanjiana cv Jarra. This significantly increased soil pH (1 : 5 0. 01 M CaCl 2) by up to 0. 5 units to a depth of 0. 90 m over a period of 4 years when compared to bare soil. The alkalisation of the profile was equivalent to 2. 7 t/ha of calcium carbonate distributed evenly down the profile. Urea at the same rate of N decreased soil pH at 20 - 50 cm by 0. 2 units. Similar but smaller changes were measured at the other Australian site (Brachiaria decumbens) and the site in Thailand (Andropogon gayanus cv Carimagua (Gamba grass). Treatment effects at these sites were restricted by time (1 year) or seasonal conditions that limited the number of N applications that could be applied (290 kg N/ha over 3 years) at the Thai site. The research has clearly demonstrated that nitrate N fertilizer can rapidly correct soil acidity down the soil profile to 0. 9 m and this is attributed to the release of alkali from roots as nitrate is taken up. Such a strategy may be an effective approach to addressing subsoil acidification where surface applications of lime are ineffective and profile modification is cost prohibitive...|$|R
40|$|Particulate matter (or aerosols) are {{particles}} {{suspended in}} the atmosphere. Aerosols {{are believed to be}} the most important pollutant associated with increased human mortality and morbidity. Therefore, it is important to investigate the relationship between sources of aerosols (such as industry) and the concentration of harmful aerosols at ground level. Furthermore, aerosols influence the climate system by scattering and absorbing solar radiation and by influencing cloud properties. The total climate effect of aerosols is poorly understood compared to the climate effect of greenhouse gases. Therefore, climate studies also benefit from a better understanding of aerosols. The goal of this thesis is to investigate the spatial distribution of aerosols over Europe with focus on the Netherlands. The aerosol life cycle and effects are calculated with numerical simulations. Performing numerical simulations of aerosols is very challenging, because, in contrast to gas molecules, each individual aerosol differs in size, composition and microphysical properties. Without simplifications, a model has to track each individual particle, which would take far too much computational time, even for modern supercomputers. The challenge is to design simplifications in such a way that the life cycle of aerosols and the effects of aerosols on human health and climate are still properly represented. Many model studies are supported by measurements. Both the measurements and the models can have different purposes. Using the correct combination of different models and observations is key for studies on aerosols. A different combination of models and observations is required to accomplish the different sub goals of this thesis. These sub goals are: Investigation of the aerosol life cycle over Europe Improvement of the understanding of gas-aerosol phase transition of ammonium nitrate and aerosol optics Improvement of representation of aerosols and their effects in models The life cycle of aerosols in Europe is investigated in chapter 3. The full life cycle of aerosols has been implemented in a global transport model. It is concluded that Europe is a net source of anthropogenic (man-made) aerosols and a net sink of natural aerosols. The most important sink of <b>anthropogenic</b> aerosols is <b>removal</b> by clouds and rain, while natural aerosols are removed predominantly by dry deposition processes. By comparing model results with observations, it is concluded that the largest uncertainties are caused by the parameterisation of wet removal processes and by missing emissions. In the Netherlands, emissions of nitrogen oxides and ammonia are high because of the high population density and intensive agriculture. After oxidation of nitrogen oxides to nitric acid, ammonium nitrate aerosols can be formed. This aerosol is special, because it can evaporate under warm and dry conditions and condense back to the aerosol phase under cold and moist conditions. Like the case of clouds, the phase equilibrium changes with altitude as the atmospheric temperature decreases with altitude. The phase of ammonium nitrate is poorly detected by many measurement instruments, because the gas-aerosol partitioning can change inside the instrument. Partly due to the scarcity of reliable measurements, the phase transition of ammonium nitrate is poorly implemented in large-scale models. Because ammonium nitrate aerosol and its phase transition is important for the aerosol budget of the Netherlands, this process has further been investigated in case studies. The goal of case studies is to gain detailed insight in the aerosol processes and, ultimately, to develop better parameterisations for large-scale models. These case-studies are performed with more detailed small-scale models. In these models, not the full aerosol life cycle is simulated but only the processes that are being investigated. A large advantage, however, is that these models have a higher resolution both in the spatial and the temporal domain. As a result, the important processes can be resolved more precisely. Chapter 4 presents a case study where the interaction between ammonium nitrate phase transition and mixing in the lower atmosphere (boundary layer) is investigated for a warm day in spring. During an intensive measurement campaign near the Cabauw tower in the Netherlands, measurements of ammonium nitrate have been performed. Importantly, the gas and the aerosol phases have been separated with a special instrument so that both concentrations are measured without errors due to phase transition inside the instrument. It is shown that the observed partitioning between gas and aerosol ammonium nitrate deviates significantly from the thermodynamic equilibrium. The hypothesised explanation for this mismatch is that aerosol-rich air from higher altitudes (where the aerosol phase is preferred due to lower temperatures) is transported to the surface, increasing the aerosol-phase fraction of ammonium nitrate at the surface. This implies that the thermodynamic equilibrium is not instantaneously restored at the surface. A simulation of ammonium nitrate partitioning in the boundary layer has been performed with a simplified column model. The match between model results and observations improved drastically when applying a delay timescale up to two hours for the gas-aerosol equilibrium. The interaction between turbulence and ammonium nitrate partitioning is further investigated in a more detailed model study (chapter 5). In this model, turbulent motions are explicitly resolved. As highlighted above, downward motions are associated with higher aerosol concentrations, because the phase equilibrium of ammonium nitrate is shifted towards the aerosol phase at higher altitudes. Therefore, turbulent motions induce a fluctuating concentration of aerosol ammonium nitrate with updrafts containing lower aerosol ammonium nitrate concentrations and subsidence motions containing enhanced aerosol ammonium nitrate concentrations. It is discussed that these fluctuations in observations may provide information about the speed of gas-aerosol partitioning, which is very difficult to measure directly. Throughout chapters 3 to 5, several ideas for model improvements have been posed. These ideas originate both from knowledge gained in the studies and from further challenges that are discovered. One such improvement for models is a computationally efficient and adequate representation of the optical properties of aerosols. Implementation of aerosol optics has been quite challenging, because the physics of aerosol optics is very complicated. Chapter 6 presents a package that allows easy implementation of aerosol optics in atmospheric models that represent aerosols. Aerosol modelling is a very challenging task and can be developed much further. In this thesis, important steps have been taken to improve knowledge about aerosols. Future research should proceed by unravelling remaining aerosol mysteries, such as those presented in the final chapter (7) of this thesis...|$|R
