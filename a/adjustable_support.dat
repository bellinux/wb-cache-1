50|$|All {{support systems}} {{have to be}} height {{adjustable}} to allow the formwork to be placed at the correct height and to be removed after the concrete is cured. Normally adjustable metal props similar to (or the same as) those used by beam slab formwork are used to support these systems. Some systems combine stringers and supports into steel or aluminum trusses. Yet other systems use metal frame shoring towers, which the decks are attached to. Another common method is to attach the formwork decks to previously cast walls or columns,thus eradicating the use of vertical props altogether. In this method, <b>adjustable</b> <b>support</b> shoes are bolted through holes (sometimes tie holes) or attached to cast anchors.|$|E

30|$|The laser {{detector}} head (Fig.  1 a) was attached on an <b>adjustable</b> <b>support,</b> fixed on a stable tripod, and placed ~ 465  mm behind the CW limit switch of the SRM system. The laser beam reflector (Fig.  1 b) was {{mounted on a}} small <b>adjustable</b> <b>support</b> and firmly attached to the sample tray using double-sided tape. Laser beam generated from the laser encoder unit is transmitted through a laser fiber to the {{laser detector}} unit. It was then emitted from the laser detector passing through SRM and reflected with the laser beam reflector attached to the sample tray. The reflected laser beam was received with the detector head, which {{was used for the}} interference measurements together with the source laser beam. Approximate distance between the laser detector head and the laser beam reflector when the tray is at the home position was measured as ~ 3895  mm.|$|E

Each of the laser interferometry measurements was conducted relative to the home position at a sampling frequency of 1  kHz. Environmental corrections were conducted for all measurements with temperature of 23.5  °C, humidity of 40  %, and atmospheric pressure of 101.45  kPa. Static measurements without motion of the tray show {{a standard deviation of}} 0.7  µm, possibly due to background mechanical vibrations and variability of environmental parameters.|$|E

40|$|As an {{alternative}} to the classical waveguides, such as the H-waveguide and the rectangular waveguide, the groove waveguide has been used at millimetre wavelengths {{for the last couple of}} decades. Most of these properties are attributed to the open sides of the guide, which reduce the wall losses. This article describes a semisymmetrical groove guide resonator that is designed and analyzed analytically, numerically, and experimentally. The numerical simulations are performed via a powerful time-domain simulator based on the finite-difference, time-domain (FDTD) method.

40|$|Abstract. Tracked mobile robots with <b>adjustable</b> <b>support</b> tracks or {{flippers}} {{are popular}} promising solutions for negotiating rough terrain and 3 D obstacles. Though many according robot bases are in principle physically capable of climbing stairs, it is a non-trivial control-task for a remote tele-operator, {{especially when the}} user can not directly see the robot like in search and rescue scenarios. To limit training requirements and to ease the cognitive load on operators, respectively to enable fully autonomous rescue robots, we developed a fuzzy controller for this task, which adjusts the drive forces and the posture of the flipper. The design of the controller is guided by observing the strategies of a trained user when tele-operating a robot with unlimited visual information. In doing so, an Open Dynamics Engine (ODE) simulation of our robot is used where the full set of all physical parameters is accessible for analysis. Based on this data, it is shown in several experiments that the controller is not only capable of climbing stairs but that it does so in a more efficient manner than the human user who served as training model. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the conceptual {{design of a}} new low-cost measurement system for the determination of pollutant concentrations associated with aircraft operations. The proposed system employs Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) and passive electro-optics equipment installed in two non-collocated components. The source component consists of a tuneable small-size and low-cost/weight LIDAR emitter, which can be installed either on airborne or ground-based autonomous vehicles, or in fixed surface installations. The sensor component includes a target surface calibrated for reflectance and passive electro-optics equipment calibrated for radiance, both installed on an <b>adjustable</b> <b>support.</b> The proposed bistatic system determines the column-averaged molecular and aerosol pollutant concentrations along the LIDAR beam by measuring the cumulative absorption and scattering phenomena along the optical slant range. The molecular column densities are measured by means of Differential Absorption LIDAR (DIAL), which exploits the known molecular vibration processes for non-ambiguous species detection. Aerosol concentrations such as particulate and soot are determined by means of knowledge-based inversion with regularization. The laboratory calibration of the system components is also discussed. Previously published uncertainty analysis results highlighted the positive qualities of the proposed measurement system even in degraded meteorological conditions, making the proposed bistatic LIDAR {{a viable alternative to}} other systems currently employed...|$|E
40|$|The flukes are {{the primary}} {{locomotor}} structure in cetaceans, which produce hydrodynamic thrust as the caudal vertebrae are oscillated dorso-ventrally. Effective thrust generation {{is a function of}} the kinematics of the flukes, the angle of attack between the flukes and the incident water flow, and the shape of the flukes. We investigated the effect of bending within the caudal region of odontocete cetaceans to determine how changes in angular displacement between caudal vertebrae could effect passive shape change of the flukes. The internal and external changes of bent flukes were examined with computer tomography. Flukes and tailstock were removed from deceased Delphinus delphis, Lagenorhynchus acutus, Peponocephala electra, Phocoena phocoena and Tursiops truncatus, and bent on an <b>adjustable</b> <b>support</b> at 0, 45 and 90 ◦. At 0 ◦, cross-sections of the flukes displayed a symmetrical profile. Cross-sections of bent flukes (45 ◦, 90 ◦) were asymmetrical and showed a cambered profile. Maximum cambering occurred close to the tailstock and decreased toward the fluke tip. Maximum angular displacement occurred at the ‘ball vertebra’, which was located posterior of the anterior insertion of the flukes on the tailstock. Bending at the ‘ball vertebra ’ passively cambers the flexible flukes. Cambering could increase hydrodynamic force production during swimming, particularly during direction reversal in the oscillatory cycle. 1...|$|E
40|$|Whereas {{walking for}} {{paraplegic}} patients {{is now a}} routine clinical option, ambulation for heavily handicapped cerebral palsy patients is less well established. There are good reasons for supposing that therapeutic benefits similar to that achieved with paraplegic patients are possible for this group. However, the biomechanical problems which must be overcome are different {{and in many ways}} more difficult to address. The most important factors are identified as appropriate truncal support, control of abduction/adduction, rotation and flexion range at the hip, and of knee flexion. A means of applying these controls is described as being a combination of a walking frame and orthosis. The special walking frame provides <b>adjustable</b> <b>support</b> at thoracic, abdominal and sacral levels and incorporates castor steering and upper limb support. Controls on lower limb movements are applied through a special orthosis which has a readily available variation of specification to accommodate the wide range of conditions met in cerebral palsy.

Evaluation of the experience in applying the system has enabled the fundamental principles to permit more practical applications to be defined. All correspondence to be addressed t...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of reaching is crucially {{dependent on the}} progressive control of the trunk, yet their interrelation has not been addressed in detail. Previous studies on seated reaching evaluated infants during fully supported or unsupported conditions; however, trunk control is progressively developed, starting from the cervical/thoracic followed by the lumbar/pelvic regions for the acquisition of independent sitting. Providing external trunk support at different levels to test the effects of controlling {{the upper and lower}} regions of the trunk on reaching provides insight into the mechanisms by which trunk control impacts reaching in infants. Ten healthy infants were recruited at 2. 5 months of age and tested longitudinally, until 8 months. During the reaching test, infants were placed in an upright seated position and an <b>adjustable</b> <b>support</b> device provided trunk fixation at pelvic and thoracic levels. Kinematic and electromyographic data were collected. Results showed that prior to independent sitting, postural instability was higher when infants were provided with pelvic compared to thoracic support. Associated reaches were more circuitous, less smooth and less efficient. Associated with this instability, there was increased postural muscle activity and arm muscle co-activation. Differences between levels of support were not observed once infants acquired independent sitting. These results suggest that trunk control is acquired in a segmental sequence across the {{development of}} upright sitting, and it is tightly correlated with reaching performance...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the dynamics of}} some vibro-impacting systems with fixed or moving amplitude constraints. It is based on and includes five papers, marked A to E. Simple models of three different vibro-impacting systems with applications {{in the fields of}} impact hammers, granular flow and disk brakes in vehicles are analysed. A 2 -DOF (two-degree-of-freedom) model of a threshold-limited impact hammer is studied (Paper A). The stability of a class of periodic motions is analysed. For some parameter values these periodic motions are found to be qualitatively similar to the ones observed for a corresponding 1 -DOF system. At other parameter combinations, however, new kinds of periodic or chaotic motions can be observed. For low damping, phenomena resembling antiresonance for linear systems can also be observed. Granular shear flows show a transitional behaviour in the rapid flow regime as the shear speed or the concentration of the grains is varied. The motion can, for example, change from smooth and orderly to erratic and turbulent. Some aspects of this transitional behaviour in granular shear flow are studied numerically, analytically and experimentally (Papers B, C and D). Simple vibro-impacting models are suggested to get some analytical insight into the dynamics of shear layers. Results from a 1 -DOF model show that for high forcing frequencies, which correspond to high shear speeds, periodic as well as chaotic motions can exist, whereas, for low forcing frequencies the vibrations are completely damped out to a stationary state (Paper B). Stability of this stationary state is studied analytically (Paper C), and experimentally (Paper D), where the motions of granular particles in a transparent shear cell are followed by using video techniques. For low shear speeds a single shear layer adjacent to the bottom boundary of the shear cell is observed. As the shear speed is increased, a transition to a random like state involving many layers is found to occur. In order to understand the phenomenon of squeal in disk brakes, a 3 -DOF model is suggested to simulate the dynamics of a brake pad. The region of contact between the brake pad and the disk is described by using a coefficient of friction and distributed stiffness. The brake pad is allowed to have <b>adjustable</b> <b>support</b> locations and possibilities of impacts with its surroundings. The equilibrium state of the pad is determined by using a static analysis. The assumption is that the instability of this stationary state is a possible explanation of squeal, therefore, the stability is analysed in detail. Examples of different kinds of pad motions are presented. A rich variety of motions are found to exist including periodic, seemingly chaotic, stationary behaviour in slip, vibrations with full contact with the disk, stick-slip and impacts.
