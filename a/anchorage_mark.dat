5000|$|At {{the time}} of the election, Alaska had a Republican Governor and Lieutenant Governor (Sarah Palin and Sean Parnell, respectively) and was {{represented}} in both the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives solely by Republicans (U.S. Senator Ted Stevens, who was defeated for reelection in 2008 by the former Democratic Mayor of <b>Anchorage</b> <b>Mark</b> Begich, and U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski, and U.S. Representative Don Young). At {{the time of}} the election, Republicans held a majority in the Alaska House of Representatives whereas a coalition of Democrats and moderate Republicans controlled the Alaska Senate. Furthermore, since becoming a state in 1959, Alaska has voted for the Republican nominee in every presidential election with the exception of 1964 when the Last Frontier voted for President Lyndon B. Johnson in his 44-state landslide.|$|E
5000|$|As of February 2013, {{the ferry}} was still docked at Ward Cove in Ketchikan, {{hundreds}} of miles from Knik Arm. In 2008 then mayor of the Municipality of <b>Anchorage</b> <b>Mark</b> Begich terminated the 2002 agreement with the Matanuska-Susitna Borough, who now bears sole responsibility for the project. Several landing sites have been proposed, and each time there have been objections. One site could possibly interfere with the endangered Beluga whale population in Cook Inlet. Another was deemed too close to the oil [...] "tank farm" [...] at the Port of Anchorage and was rejected out of security concerns. A third site was objected to by commercial fishermen who feared it would interfere with their operations. Another site was rejected because the ferry required additional clearance. The borough favored a site at Ship Creek, an industrial area already used for offshore docking of tugboats, however, offloading of vehicles requires a ferry landing. No landings were ever built.|$|E

50|$|In 2013 {{he filed}} papers {{to run for}} the office of Lieutenant Governor of Alaska to succeed Mead Treadwell, who was running for the U.S. Senate seat of former <b>Anchorage</b> Mayor <b>Mark</b> Begich. Mayor Sullivan ran unopposed in the Republican primary for that party's Lieutenant Governor nomination, while Treadwell lost his Senate primary to the other Dan Sullivan seeking statewide office in the 2014 Alaskan elections.|$|R
500|$|Gruening {{lost the}} general {{election}} to Republican Frank Murkowski. Gravel was the last Democrat to represent Alaska in Congress for 28years, until <b>Anchorage</b> Mayor <b>Mark</b> Begich defeated Stevens, by now an aged, iconic figure {{who had just been}} convicted of seven felonies for taking unreported gifts, in a very close and protracted election result in mid-November 2008. (The charges against Stevens were subsequently dropped due to prosecutorial misconduct.) ...|$|R
60|$|The {{distance}} {{along the}} winding Wady, between the settlement {{and the sea}} westward, where the watercourse ends in sand-heaps, is seven to eight miles, and the coast {{shows no sign of}} harbour or of houses. About three miles, however, to the northwest is the admirable Bay of 'Aynu'nah, unknown to the charts. Defended on both sides by sandspits, and open only between the west and the north-west, where reefs and shoals allow but a narrow passage, its breadth across the mouth from east to west measures at least five thousand metres, and the length inland, useful for refuge, is at least three thousand. At the bottom of this noble Límán, the Kolpos so scandalously abused by the ancients, are three sandy buttresses metalled with water rolled stones, and showing traces of graves. Possibly here may have been the site of an ancient settlement. The Arabs call the southern <b>anchorage,</b> <b>marked</b> by a post and a pit of brackish water, El-Musaybah or Musaybat Sharmá. Its only present use seems to be embarking bundles of rushes for mat-making in Egypt. The north-eastern end of the little gulf is the Gád (Jád), or Mersá of El-Khuraybah, before described as the port of 'Aynu'nah.|$|R
50|$|The FBI {{investigation}} and subsequent seven count indictment of Ted Stevens, {{as well as}} investigation of the state's only Representative, Don Young (R), generated some negative feelings in Alaska towards Republicans, even among Republican primary voters. <b>Anchorage</b> Mayor <b>Mark</b> Begich (son of the last Democratic Rep. from Alaska, Nick Begich) was courted by both the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. In February 2008, he announced {{the formation of an}} exploratory committee for the Senate seat. The possible Democratic field also included former Governor Tony Knowles, State Rep. Eric Croft and State Senators Hollis French and Johnny Ellis. Former Minority Leader of the Alaska House of Representatives Ethan Berkowitz was considered a possible candidate, but he decided to challenge Don Young instead. Sensing discontentment within the GOP, conservative Republican Dave Cuddy announced his candidacy for U.S. Senate in December 2007.|$|R
5000|$|During the {{business}} planning process, Weatherholt was {{in contact with}} Arena Football's af2 league headquartered in Chicago about joining that league. The original goal was to join the af2, and on April 25, 2006, Weatherholt paid the application fee for admission to the league. The {{next step was to}} secure funding and form the team. The goal was to incorporate APS, which took place on May 4, 2006, and to raise equity capital by selling common stock in the newly formed corporation.On Friday May 5, 2006, Weatherholt made his plan public when a press release was sent to the Alaska media outlets announcing his plans for bringing a professional indoor football team to Alaska. The Alaska Wild team name was selected as part of a [...] "Name the Team" [...] contest hosted by APS. Over 1,500 names were submitted online by football fans across the United States and Canada. United States Air Force TSgt Deryl Morse submitted the winning team name. Morse was on hand to accept a family four-pack season pass to inaugural season from <b>Anchorage</b> Mayor <b>Mark</b> Begich and Weatherholt.|$|R
50|$|On October 27, 2008, U.S. Senator Ted Stevens was {{successfully}} prosecuted in the District of Columbia. He {{was found guilty}} by a jury of all seven felonies against him. The case had been prosecuted by Principal Deputy Chief Brenda K. Morris, Trial Attorneys Nicholas A. Marsh and Edward P. Sullivan of the Criminal Division's Public Integrity Section, headed by Chief William M. Welch II, and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Joseph W. Bottini and James A. Goeke from the District of Alaska. Eight days after the verdict, Stevens narrowly lost re-election to <b>Anchorage's</b> Democratic then-Mayor <b>Mark</b> Begich. http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/11/18/alaska.senate.race/?iref=mpstoryview He had held his seat since December 24, 1968.|$|R
50|$|Fair Haven {{is located}} around Little Sodus Bay, a bay {{on the south}} shore of Lake Ontario. The bay is bounded on the west, east and south by drumlins and on the north by Lake Ontario. The lake level is 245 ft above sea level, and the bay averages 30 ft in depth with several {{protected}} coves and <b>anchorages.</b> One well <b>marked</b> reef hazard ("Grass Island"), approximately 800 ft long (N-S) and 100 ft wide (E-W) with a depth of only 2 ft, {{is located in the}} northwest corner of the bay out of the main channel. There are two active marinas on the bay, Fair Point at the north end and Chinook Harbor at the south end.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the days}} passed, the atoll began to change; the ship rode {{higher in the}} water as {{equipment}} was unloaded. Temperatures on deck averaged 122 degrees Fahrenheit (50 degrees Celsius) between 10:00 and 15:00 hours each day; [...] "tropical" [...] duty hours of 0400 to 1400 soon commenced aboard the ship. The men of Underwater Demolition Team 12 and a platoon of Seabees removed underwater obstacles, installed buoys, <b>marked</b> <b>anchorages,</b> cleared land, set up a tent city, and began laying down an airfield. By the time dock landing ship [...] and amphibious cargo ship [...] arrived, the base camp was fully ready, as was a harbor. Later, having established a self-sustaining shore party, Vernon County made two additional voyages to and from Diego Garcia, picking up more men and supplies at Singapore, Cocos Island, and Mauritius.|$|R
25|$|While a few {{offshore}} <b>anchorage</b> {{spots are}} <b>marked</b> on maps, Jarvis island has no ports or harbors, and swift currents are a hazard. There is a boat landing {{area in the}} middle of the western shoreline near a crumbling day beacon, and another near the southwest corner of the island. The center of Jarvis island is a dried lagoon where deep guano deposits accumulated, which were mined for about 20 years during the nineteenth century. The island has a tropical desert climate, with high daytime temperatures, constant wind, and strong sun. Nights, however, are quite cool. The ground is mostly sandy and reaches 23 feet (7 meters) at its highest point. Because of the island's distance from other large landmasses, the Jarvis Island high point is the 36th most isolated peak in the world. The low-lying coral island has long been noted as hard to sight from small ships and is surrounded by a narrow fringing reef.|$|R
40|$|We {{attempted}} to infect primary gastric epithelia (PGE) with recombinant Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) carrying a selectable marker {{that made it}} possible to select EBV-infected cells. Cells dually positive for EBV-determined nuclear antigen (EBNA) and cytokeratin were detected in 3 of 21 primary cultures after 3 days of EBV inoculation. From one culture, EBV-infected cell clones were repeatedly obtained at a frequency of 3 to 5 cell clones per 106 cells. EBV-infected clones had enhanced population doubling and grew to attain a highly increased saturation density, together with acquisition of <b>marked</b> <b>anchorage</b> independence. The infected clones retained the ultrastructural morphology characteristic of gastric mucosal epithelium and have been growing stably for more than 18 months (corresponding to at least 300 generations) so far, in clear contrast to the parental PGE cells, which ceased growth after 60 generations. The p 53 gene of the parental PGE cells was found to be overexpressed, perhaps thereby conferring the basal potential for long-term survival in vitro. Moreover, EBV infection accelerated, to a significant extent, the growth rate and agar clonability of NU-GC- 3 cells, an established EBV-negative but EBV-susceptible human gastric carcinoma cell line. Both EBV-converted PGE and NU-GC- 3 clones, like EBV-positive gastric carcinoma biopsy specimens, expressed a restricted set of EBV latent infection genes characterized by the absence of EBNA 2 and latent membrane protein 1 (LMP 1) expression. These results indicate that EBV infection causes a transformed phenotype on PGE in the setting of possible unregulated cell cycling and renders even established gastric carcinoma cells more malignant via a limited spectrum of viral latent-gene expression. This study may reflect an in vivo scenario illustrating multiphasic involvement of EBV in carcinogenesis of gastric or other epithelial cancers...|$|R
