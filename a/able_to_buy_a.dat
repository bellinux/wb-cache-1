25|$|Critics {{assert that}} naked CDSs should be banned, {{comparing}} them to buying fire insurance on your neighbor’s house, which creates a huge incentive for arson. Analogizing {{to the concept}} of insurable interest, critics say you should not be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> CDS—insurance against default—when you do not own the bond. Short selling is also viewed as gambling and the CDS market as a casino.|$|E

25|$|The nobility had greatly {{expanded}} under Louis XIV, who liberally awarded or sold titles {{to men who}} had served the royal government. By 1726, two-thirds {{of the members of}} the Estates-General, who largely lived in Paris, had acquired or were in the process of acquiring noble status. The playwright Beaumarchais, the son of a watchmaker, was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> title. Wealthy merchants and financiers were often able to obtain noble status for their families by marrying daughters to members of the old nobility.|$|E

Gambier Parry, the son of Richard and Mary Parry, had been orphaned {{at the age of}} five and brought up by his maternal family, adopting their name, Gambier, as part of his surname. Having inherited enormous wealth from his grandfather, Thomas Parry (a director of the East India Company who died in 1816), Gambier Parry was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> country seat at Highnam Court, a seventeenth-century house near the River Severn and two miles west from Gloucester.|$|E
25|$|Prisoners were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> small {{range of}} {{provisions}} from their captors at Japanese prices, which escalated {{as the war}} went on. Black marketeering was sometimes tolerated by the guards, as they themselves {{were involved in the}} buying or exchanging of goods, and at other times punished severely. Although {{contact with the outside world}} was forbidden, there were plenty of opportunities to communicate with the locals. Firewood-gathering gangs in the jungle were able to make contact and arrange purchases when the guards were not paying attention; at other times these transactions were permitted with the permission of and in the presence of a lenient Japanese guard. Gold, in the form of rings and jewellery, and British pounds were in demand by the Japanese guards. Such was the desperation of the prisoners towards the end of their internment that two soldiers disinterred a recently buried body in order to retrieve the dead man's wedding ring.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, Thomas Douglas, 5th Earl of Selkirk attempted to resettle his fellow Scotsmen and women in North America. By 1808, Selkirk had founded two colonies, one on Prince Edward Island, another at Baldoon in Western Ontario, and was looking to establish a third. The eastern coastline of Canada was already settled and no longer had any tracts of land large enough to support a colony, so Selkirk looked for a location with good soil and a temperate climate far in the interior. He quickly discovered the region best fitting his needs fell within the territory of the Hudson’s Bay Company (HBC). Selkirk began in 1808 buying shares of the HBC in order to acquire the land he needed. Because of the crippling competition with the North West Company (NWC), the HBC’s stock at this time was down from 250% to 50%, and he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> majority share equalling £100,000 (in comparison the whole of the HBC stock was worth about £150,000).|$|E

He and his three sons were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> work it as tenant farmers, and by 1752 Konradt had built his house near his brothers George and Johannis, using stone rather than the brick more popular with the Palatinate settlers. The family kept the farm, and in 1846 Philip Lasher was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>an</b> 85 acre parcel and build the frame farmhouse across the road.|$|R

500|$|On 5 March 1495, Lisa married Francesco di Bartolomeo di Zanobi del Giocondo, a {{modestly}} successful {{cloth and}} silk merchant, becoming {{his third wife}} at age15. Lisa's dowry was 170florins and the San Silvestro farm near her family's country home, {{a sign that the}} Gherardini family was not wealthy at the time and reason to think she and her husband loved each other. The property lies between Castellina and San Donato in Poggio, near two farms later owned by Michelangelo. Neither poor nor among the most well-to-do in Florence, the couple lived a middle-class life. Lisa's marriage may have increased her social status because her husband's family may have been richer than her own. Francesco is thought to have benefited because Gherardini is an [...] "old name". They lived in shared accommodation until 5March 1503, when Francesco was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> house next door to his family's old home in the Via della Stufa. Leonardo is thought to have begun painting Lisa's portrait the same year.|$|E
500|$|As Homer and Bart are {{watching}} The Itchy & Scratchy Show, Marge tells {{them that the}} telephone company has charged the family hundreds of dollars for making phone calls to Brazil. Homer and Marge decide to visit the company, thinking {{there has been a}} mistake. They meet with customer service representative Lindsey Naegle, who cuts off the family's phone service after Homer tells her that he refuses to pay the bill. Homer attempts to connect illegally to the phone lines, but only succeeds in getting electrocuted at least 5 times and, when he regains consciousness on the couch, is told that he was found [...] "smoldering in the bushes". When Lisa finds out the reason the family no longer has phone service, she confesses that she has actually made calls to Brazil. She has been sponsoring an orphan named Ronaldo in the country and she used to receive a letter from him once every month until recently. Lisa called Ronaldo's orphanage to find out what had happened and she was told he is missing. She shows her family a tape recorded by Ronaldo that she received after her first donation, in which Ronaldo thanks Lisa and tells her that with her money he has purchased a pair of dancing shoes for himself and the orphanage has been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> door. Touched by the tape, the Simpsons decide to travel to Brazil to solve the mystery behind Ronaldo's disappearance, leaving Maggie with Patty and Selma.|$|E
2500|$|Jonathan David Good {{was born}} on December 7, 1985 in Cincinnati, Ohio. Much of his wrestling persona is based on his own real-life {{upbringing}} in Cincinnati's East End, where {{he spent much of}} his childhood in public housing. His father, who worked in Indianapolis 70 miles away, was largely absent in Good's life and Good has gone on to say that his biggest accomplishment since joining WWE was being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> house for his mother away from the rough neighborhoods in Cincinnati. An avid wrestling fan who idolized Bret Hart as a child, Good used wrestling as an escape from his rough upbringing by immersing himself in wrestling videotapes and reading stories about wrestling's earlier days. A year after beginning to train as a wrestler, he dropped out of high school, which he later compared to Peter Gibbons from the movie Office Space coming to work and [...] "checking out".|$|E

2500|$|In 2000, the Over Canal Basin (adjacent to the River Severn at Over on the {{outskirts}} of Gloucester, where the Canal links with the inland waterways network) was reconstructed entirely by volunteers from the Canal Trust and the national volunteer body the Waterway Recovery Group. The estimated commercial cost of the work was some £500,000, but it was completed against a 10-month deadline, with a budget of just £60,000. The basin was originally filled in when the Over Isolation Hospital was built in 1903. The site was sold for housing development to Swan Homes, and agreement was reached to excavate the basin to enhance the project, under which Wharf House was rebuilt to provide a new canal centre. In late 2011, the Trust were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> short section of the canal above the basin site. This had been purchased by residents in 2004 to protect their communal interests, and was passed to the Trust for a nominal sum. Like the basin, there was a deadline on development, which had to be completed by September 2012, but a major effort by the Waterway Recovery Group and members of the Trust resulted in most of the work being completed in April 2012. It was re-watered by 18 April, four months before its scheduled completion date. [...] It was formally re-opened by Timothy West and Prunella Scales at the 2012 Over Canal Festival.|$|E
