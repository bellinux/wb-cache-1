Sally Brown's school building, that expressed {{thoughts and feelings}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> (and the general business of being a brick building), is another. Linus' famous [...] "security blanket" [...] also displayed occasional signs of anthropomorphism. Another example is Charlie Brown's pitching mound, which at times would express thoughts and opinions ("Why don't {{you learn how to}} pitch, you stupid kid?").|$|E

2500|$|With {{the growing}} number of {{international}} business, military placements, and immigration there has been a growing number of TCKs. Third culture kids are being educated in a culture that is not their own. Schools and teachers {{need to be aware of}} the culture differences these students face. Studies have found that educators and counselors should be culturally competent and possess the knowledge to properly educate these type of students. This would create an effective and optimal environment for their learning and adjusting abilities. Research conducted on TCKs have [...] been found to need special attention during their transition phase. The stress and grief students feel during transitional phases can distort their psycho-social development which can affect their grades and school work. Therefore, Third Culture Kid students need a comfortable and inviting school setting to offset the effect of their transition. The best way for counselors to work with TCKs is to have sound knowledge <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> and their unique characteristics.|$|E
60|$|We {{have now}} reached the {{difficult}} {{portion of our}} task. Mr. Tatler, for all that we care, may have been as virulent as he liked <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> of a former day; but for the iron to touch our sacred selves, for a brother of the Guild to betray its most privy infirmities, let such a Judas look {{to himself as he}} passes {{on his way to the}} Scots Law or the Diagnostic, below the solitary lamp at the corner of the dark quadrangle. We confess that this idea alarms us. We enter a protest. We bind ourselves over verbally to keep the peace. We hope, moreover, that having thus made you secret to our misgivings, you will excuse us if we be dull, and set that down to caution which you might before have charged to the account of stupidity.|$|E

Thus, this model exhibits <b>the</b> <b>student</b> performance in three grades as poor, fair, and good. The final part of visualization is generated through ECHAID algorithm. In this paper, we present the model and its performance on our private student dataset collected by us. Our model shows interesting insights <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> {{and can be used}} to identify their performance grade...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the benefits of}} providing an Interactive Learning Environment with an interface which allows explicit planning and instantiation. In addition to providing information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>student's</b> beliefs to <b>the</b> <b>student</b> model, it facilitates <b>the</b> <b>student's</b> learning and metacognition by proving a supportive problem solving environment. Features from a system for teaching logic proofs have been extended and generalised by developing a system for supporting problem solving {{in the domain of}} accounting and finance. Some features of instantiators, their use in problem solving and the issues and trade-offs they raise in interface design are described. Introduction The interface to an Interactive Learning Environment (ILE) is crucial to its effectiveness. Not only is it vital for explaining domain issues to <b>the</b> <b>student</b> but {{it is the only way}} the system can obtain information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>student's</b> beliefs. <b>The</b> techniques of explicit instantiation and planning offer the dual benefits of [...] ...|$|R
