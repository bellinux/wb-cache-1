Æthelwig was one of <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>small</b> <b>number</b> of native Englishmen trusted by the king, which group included Ealdred and Wulfstan. Probably in 1069, Æthelwig was given authority in the former lands of the Mercian kingdom. After the deposition of Godric, the abbot of Winchcombe Abbey in 1070, Æthelwig served as his jailor. In 1072, Æthelwig was acting as a royal judge {{in the western part}} of England. During the rebellion of 1075, Æthelwig kept Roger de Breteuil, the Earl of Hereford, one of the rebels, from joining up with the other rebels. In this action, Æthelwig was assisted by Wulfstan, as well as the sheriff of Worcestershire, Urse d'Abetot. Æthelwig also took the opportunity after the Norman Conquest to acquire more lands, obtaining 36 estates by redeeming loans. Æthelwig used his knowledge of English law not only on his own account, but to aid the new Norman ecclesiasitcs, such as Lanfranc, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Serlo, the Abbot of Gloucester. A number of English landowners commended themselves into Æthelwig's care after the Conquest, and this led to conflicts over who owned the lands after Æthelwig's death.|$|E

Results demonstrate that the algorithm goes through <b>a</b> relatively <b>very</b> <b>small</b> <b>number</b> of iterations to converge to the antenna specifications and consequently outperforms the genetic-based searches...|$|R

40|$|Background: Because of the {{importance}} of voltage-activated K + channels during embryonic development and in cell proliferation, we present here the first description of these channels in E 15 rat embryonic neural progenitor cells derived from the subventricular zone (SVZ). Activation, inactivation, and single-channel conductance properties of recorded progenitor cells were compared with those obtained by others when these Kv gene products were expressed in oocytes. Methodology/Principal Findings: Neural progenitor cells derived from the subventricular zone of E 15 embryonic rats were cultured under conditions that did not promote differentiation. Immunocytochemical and Western blot assays for nestin expression indicated that almost all of the cells available for recording expressed this intermediate filament protein, which is generally accepted as a marker for uncommitted embryonic neural progenitor cells. However, <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>small</b> <b>numbers</b> of the cells expressed GFAP, a marker for astrocytes, O 4, a marker for immature oligodendrocytes, and bIII-tubulin, a marker for neurons. Using immunocytochemistry and Western blots, we detected consistently the expression of Kv 2. 1, and 4. 3. In whole-cell mode, we recorded two outward currents, a delayed rectifier and an A-type current. Conclusions/Significance: We conclude that Kv 2. 1, and 4. 3 are expressed in E 15 SVZ neural progenitor cells, and we propose that they may be associated with the delayed-rectifier and the A-type currents, respectively, that we recorded. These results demonstrate the early expression of delayed rectifier and A-type K + currents and channels in embryonic neura...|$|R
