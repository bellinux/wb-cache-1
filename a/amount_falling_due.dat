The Sri Lankan authorities request {{an extension}} of repurchase expectations arising {{in the remainder of}} 2005, in the amount of SDR 74, 162, 500. The extension would have the effect of moving the repurchase expectations to an obligations basis, with each <b>amount</b> <b>falling</b> <b>due</b> exactly one year after the expectation date. The authorities have also expressed their desire to resume discussions on the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) /EFF-supported program.

5000|$|... • Conditionality: The Paris Club only negotiates debt restructurings with debtor {{countries}} that: 1) need debt relief. Debtor {{countries are}} expected to provide a precise description of their economic and financial situation, 2) have implemented and are committed to implementing reforms to restore their economic and financial situation, and 3) have a demonstrated track record of implementing reforms under an IMF program. This means in practice that the country must have a current program supported by an appropriate arrangement with the IMF (Stand-By, Extended Fund Facility, Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility, Policy Support Instrument). The level of the debt treatment {{is based on the}} financing gap identified in the IMF program. In the case of a flow treatment, the consolidation period coincides with the period when the IMF arrangement shows a need for debt relief. When the flow treatment extends {{over a long period of}} time (generally more than one year), the Paris Club agreement is divided into phases. The <b>amounts</b> <b>falling</b> <b>due</b> during the first phase are treated as soon as the agreement enters into force. Subsequent phases are implemented following completion of conditions mentioned in the Agreed Minutes, including non-accumulation of arrears and approval of the reviews of the IMF program.|$|R
40|$|Falls {{within the}} Older Adult {{community}} lead to roughly 734, 000 hospital admissions annually with 87 % attributed to walker use. In {{order to reduce}} the <b>amount</b> of <b>falls</b> <b>due</b> to walker use our objective was to create a system that detects an increased likelihood of a fall occurring, notifies the user of improper positioning, and can intervene by application of an automatic braking system to stabilize the walker; effectively training the user to have a more proper walking form and posture reducing the risk of a fall. In order to accomplish this goal, final deliverables included a working prototype and validation test results demonstrating proper specifications for notification of position, reduction of acceleration, and low light visibility. The final design incorporated an ultrasonic sensor, accelerometer, and ambient light sensor to detect user activity, position, and brightness. Then, communicated through an Arduino microcontroller to determine if safe thresholds had been breached, resulting in the activation of two solenoids and arrest of the walker’s movement. LEDs illuminate in low light environments to ease the burden of finding the walker in the dark, as well as illuminate the path of motion when the walker was in use. The prototype utilized the best selling walker available on the market, and was assessed by team members for efficacy. Final results demonstrate proper notification of position, increased visual acuity in response to environmental stimuli, and a reduced acceleration due to the braking system. [URL]...|$|R

Following a set of definitions, we describe the salient clinical features of disorders leading to such falls.

With respect to falls caused by an apparent loss of consciousness, we discuss the presentation of cataplexy, drop attacks, and psychogenic falls. Particular emphasis will be laid upon crucial features obtained by history taking for distinguishing between the various conditions that cause or mimic a transient loss of consciousness...|$|R
