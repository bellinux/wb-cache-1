50|$|The Zakouma National Park is an {{important}} habitat with {{the highest number of}} large mammals. Scimitar horned oryx are seen in the reserves of Chad in significant numbers, mostly in the Ouadi Rime Ouadi Achin Faunal Reserve. Also reported to survive in this reserve are the large population of <b>addax</b> (<b>nasomaculatus)</b> and dama gazelle Gazelle dama.|$|R
50|$|The {{reserve is}} rich in fauna and flora. Home to a dwindling {{population}} of ostriches, the Sahara conservation efforts are {{put in place to}} increase the number of this species in the reserve. It encloses the Addax Sanctuary Strict Nature Reserve, established in 1988, as a core area, specifically to protect the <b>Addax</b> (<b>Addax</b> <b>nasomaculatus).</b> It is also identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area.|$|R
50|$|Water from {{mountain}} streams {{makes the}} area an important habitat for wildlife {{such as a}} numbered of threatened antelope species such as <b>addax</b> (<b>Addax</b> <b>nasomaculatus),</b> Dama gazelle (Gazella dama), Dorcas gazelle (Gazella dorcas) and Red-fronted gazelle (Gazella rufifrons). Endemic species include the Arid Thicket Rat (Grammomys aridulus) from Jebel Marra. The mountains are home to birds of both Eurasia and Africa, species include Nubian bustard (Neotis nuba) and Cinereous Vulture (Aegypius monachus).|$|R
50|$|Faunal species noted are Gazella dama (EN), Gazella dorcas (VU), Gazella rufifrons (VU), Acinonyx jubatus soemmeringii (VU) and <b>Addax</b> <b>nasomaculatus</b> (VU) but the {{presence}} of the last two species is now in doubt. The scimitar oryx had its last stronghold in this reserve before going eventually going extinct in the wild.Subsequently, a reintroduction program for the species selected Ouadi Rimé-Ouadi Achim to reintroduce it in the wild; as a result, since 2016 a small herd is living within the reserve limits.|$|R

The survival rate of the <b>Addax</b> antelope (<b>Addax</b> <b>nasomaculatus)</b> increased by 9...|$|R
5000|$|The {{ecoregion}} supports, or supported, {{populations of}} several important Saharan large mammals. One, the scimitar-horned oryx Oryx dammah is now {{believed to be}} extinct in the wild, while the <b>addax</b> <b>Addax</b> <b>nasomaculatus</b> is critically endangered. Other species include dorcas gazelle Gazella dorcas which is assessed as vulnerable, dama gazelle Nanger dama which is endangered, Barbary sheep Ammotragus lervia which is vulnerable and cheetah Acinonyx jubatus which is vulnerable. In 2000 Barbary sheep and dama gaxelle were recorded in the Jebel Uweinat portion of the ecoregion.|$|R
5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} <b>addax</b> is <b>Addax</b> <b>nasomaculatus.</b> This antelope was first described by French zoologist and anatomist Henri Blainville in 1816. It {{is placed in the}} monotypic genus Addax and family Bovidae. Henri Blainville observed syntypes in Bullock's Pantherion and the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons. English naturalist Richard Lydekker stated their type locality to be probably Senegambia, though he did not have anything to support the claim. Finally, from a discussion in 1898, it became more probable that British hunters or collectors obtained the addax from the part of Sahara in Tunisia.|$|R
500|$|The <b>addax</b> (<b>Addax</b> <b>nasomaculatus),</b> {{also known}} as the white {{antelope}} and the screwhorn antelope, is an antelope of the genus Addax, that lives in the Sahara desert.

Males stand from [...] at the shoulder, with females at [...] They are sexually dimorphic, as the females are smaller than males. The colour of the coat depends on the season - in the winter, it is greyish-brown with white hindquarters and legs, and long, brown hair on the head, neck, and shoulders; in the summer, the coat turns almost completely white or sandy blonde.|$|R
40|$|The Aïr Mountains of north-central Niger are {{relatively}} unspoilt and contain {{some of the}} last remaining populations of <b>addax</b> <b>Addax</b> <b>nasomaculatus,</b> ostrich Struthio camelus and dama gazella Gazella dama in in West Africa. The Aïr Mountain are also home for some 5000 Twaregs, half of whom are cultivators {{and the other half}} herders. The Aïr and Tùnùrù National Nature Reserve, which was gazetted in 1988, covers more than 77, 000 sq km. It was inspired by concern for the region's unique and increasingly threatened wildlife, wcology.

40|$|In this study, the rumen {{metabolism}} of four ruminant species – blackbuck (Antilope cervicapra), {{barbary sheep}} (Ammotragus lervia), sika deer (Cervus nippon dybowskii) and <b>addax</b> antelope (<b>Addax</b> <b>nasomaculatus)</b> – from the Nuremberg Zoo {{was investigated in}} relation to their feeding management. Parameters of microbial fermentation in the rumen as well as rumen tissue samples were examined. Additionally, the offered and refused food was weighed, analysed and a dietary intake calculation for these ruminant species was performed. Three of the four ruminant species – blackbuck, barbary sheep and addax antelope – all grazers, showed severe characteristics of subacute ruminal acidosis due to a diet high in fermentable carbohydrates (NfE ≥ 55 % of DM basis) and low in fibre (XF ≤ 18 % of DM basis). This was indicated by numerous microabscesses within the rumen mucosa. These results demonstrate that subacute ruminal acidosis is still a severe problem in captive wild ruminants, which are often fed inappropriate diets with a high concentration of easily digestible carbohydrates...|$|R
25|$|The {{large mammals}} {{present in the}} {{ecoregion}} are the <b>addax</b> (<b>Addax</b> <b>nasomaculatus),</b> Barbary sheep (Ammotragus lervia), dorcas gazelle (Gazella dorcas), and rhim gazelle (Gazella leptoceros). However, rodents are the most represented order of mammals in the Tibesti, and include the Agag gerbil (Gerbillus agag), Balochistan gerbil (Gerbillus nanus), Cairo spiny mouse (Acomys cahirinus), lesser Egyptian jerboa (Jaculus jaculus), Libyan jird (Meriones libycus), Mzab gundi (Massoutiera Mzabi) and the North African gerbil (Gerbillus campestris). Also present are cats such as the African wildcat (Felis silvestris lybica) and, more rarely, the caracal (Caracal caracal) and the Sudan cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus soemmeringii), {{as well as several}} canine species including the Egyptian wolf (Canis anthus lupaster), fennec fox (Vulpes zerda) and Rüppell's fox (Vulpes rueppellii). The striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena) may also occupy the range. There may be as many as 50 endangered painted hunting dogs (Lycaon pictus) in the Tibesti, although some regard these relict populations as extirpated, partially due to the Darfur refugee turmoil and other Sudan generated conflicts. Bats are heavily represented in the Tibesti, including the desert long-eared bat (Otonycteris hemprichii), greater mouse-tailed bat (Rhinopoma microphyllum), Hamilton's tomb bat (Taphozous hamiltoni), Mauritian tomb bat (Taphozous mauritianus) and the trident bat (Asellia tridens). The Cape hare (Lepus capensis), desert hedgehog (Paraechinus aethiopicus), olive baboon (Papio anubis), rock hyrax (Procavia capensis) and the Saharan striped polecat (Ictonyx libyca) also populate the area.|$|R
40|$|Echinococcus granulosus {{sensu lato}} (s. l.) is a {{zoonotic}} disease highly endemic in Tunisia. Canids including stray and semi-stray dogs, jackals and foxes {{are known as}} definitive hosts and {{a wide range of}} ungulates have been shown to harbour the metacestode hydatid stage and may serve as intermediate hosts. Fertile hydatid cysts of Echinococcus equinus and E. granulosus sensu stricto (s. s.) were recently molecularly identified for the first time from Tunisian donkeys. E. granulosus (s. s.) was also identified from wild boars in Tunisia. Here we report the confirmation of hydatid cysts caused by E. granulosus (s. s.) in the critically endangered antelope, <b>Addax</b> <b>nasomaculatus</b> in Tunisia. DNA-based molecular analysis revealed that A. nasomaculatus was infected with E. granulosus (s. s.) which had a 100 % identity with the main globally distributed E. granulosus (s. s.) (EgTu 01) haplotype. Cysts of Taenia hydatigena (n = 33) were also observed on the liver and in the body cavity. Due to their endangered status and their relatively small numbers, it is unlikely that hydatid infection of A. nasomaculatus will form a major contribution to the epidemiology and transmission of E. granulosus in Tunisia, but infection may result in pathology, morbidity and early mortality, and may still {{play a role in the}} perpetuation of the parasite in wildlife cycles...|$|R

40|$|Differences in {{macroscopic}} {{measurements of}} the gastrointestinal tract have been hypothesized to correlate with the browser–grazer continuum in the natural diet of ruminants. However, to what extent these characteristics represent species-specific traits, or respond to the actually ingested diet, remains to be investigated. Twelve surplus <b>addax</b> antelope (<b>Addax</b> <b>nasomaculatus)</b> {{were divided into two}} groups and fed, for 3 months, either their usual diet, consisting of a concentrate feed with a limited amount of hay, or a diet of unlimited hay only. After culling, macroscopic measurements were compared between groups. The macroscopic anatomy of the addax showed many characteristics considered typical for grazing or ‘cattle-type’ ruminants. While both diet groups had mesenteric, pericardial and perirenal adipose tissue, these depots were subjectively more pronounced in concentrate-fed animals. Hay-fed animals had significantly heavier filled forestomach compartments, with corresponding significantly longer linear measurements. Masseter muscles and the surface of first-order omasal leaves were significantly more prominent in hay-fed animals, reflecting possible adaptations to overcome resistance of grass forage and to reabsorb fluid from increased rumination, but differences were not as distinct as reported between ‘cattle-type’ and ‘moose-type’ ruminants. Some measurements such as reticular crests and empty foregut mass remained stable between groups, indicating possibly genetically pre-defined characteristics less prone to change in adult life. The results emphasize the adaptability of ruminant digestive tract anatomy in adult animals even after a short period of time, but also suggest limits to this adaptability that reveals a species-specific anatomy regardless of the diet actually consumed...|$|R
40|$|Retention time {{of food in}} the {{digestive}} tract is a major aspect describing {{the digestive}} physiology of herbivores. Differences in feed retention times have been described for different ruminant feeding types. In this study, a dominantly grazing desert ruminant, the <b>addax</b> (<b>Addax</b> <b>nasomaculatus),</b> was investigated in this respect. Eight animals with a body weight (BW) of 87 +/- 5. 3 kg on an ad libitum grass hay (Chloris gayana) diet were available. Co-EDTA and Cr-mordanted fibers (< 2 mm) were used as pulse-dose markers. Mean retention time (MRT) in the digestive tract was calculated from faecal marker excretion. Average daily intake of the addax {{was found to be}} 1. 7 kg dry matter (DM) or 60 +/- 8. 3 g DM/kg BW(0. 75). The MRT of fluid and particles in the reticulo-rumen (MRT(fluid) RR and MRT(particle) RR) were quantified to be 20 +/- 5. 8 and 42 +/- 7. 0 h respectively. When compared to literature data, MRT(fluid) RR was significantly longer than in cattle species, and MRT(particle) RR was significantly longer than in 11 taxa of all feeding types. The ratio of MRT(particle) RR/MRT(fluid) RR (2. 3 +/- 0. 5) was found to be within the range described for grazing ruminants. The long retention times found in the addax can be interpreted as an adaptation to a diet including a high proportion of slow fermenting grasses, while the long retention time of the fluid phase can be interpreted as a consequence of water saving mechanisms of the desert-adapted addax with a potentially low water turnover and capacious water storing rumen...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} was aimed {{to compare the}} inference of antelope phylogenies resulting from the 16 S rRNA, cytochrome-b (cyt-b) and d-loop segments of mitochondrial DNA using three different computational models including Bayesian (BA), maximum parsimony (MP) and unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA). The respective nucleotide sequences of three Oryx species (Oryx leucoryx, Oryx dammah and Oryx gazella) and an out-group (<b>Addax</b> <b>nasomaculatus)</b> were aligned and subjected to BA, MP and UPGMA models for comparing the topologies of respective phylogenetic trees. The 16 S rRNA region possessed the highest frequency of conserved sequences (97. 65 %) followed by cyt-b (94. 22 %) and d-loop (87. 29 %). There were few transitions (2. 35 %) and none transversions in 16 S rRNA as compared to cyt-b (5. 61 % transitions and 0. 17 % transversions) and d-loop (11. 57 % transitions and 1. 14 % transversions) while com- paring the four taxa. All the three mitochondrial segments clearly differentiated the genus Addax from Oryx using the BA or UPGMA models. The topologies of all the gamma-corrected Bayesian trees were identical irrespective of the marker type. The UPGMA trees resulting from 16 S rRNA and d-loop sequences were also identical (Oryx dammah grouped with Oryx leucoryx) to Bayesian trees except that the UPGMA tree based on cyt-b showed a slightly different phylogeny (Oryx dammah grouped with Oryx gazella) with a low bootstrap support. However, the MP model failed to differentiate the genus Addax from Oryx. These findings demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of BA and UPGMA methods for phylogenetic analysis of antelopes using mitochondrial markers...|$|R
