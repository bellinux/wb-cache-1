Naturally, one may desire to expand the application domain of these machines to problems with general discrete variables. In this paper, we explore the possibility of employing quantum <b>annealers</b> to solve unconstrained quadratic programming problems over a bounded integer domain. We present an approach for encoding integer variables into binary ones, thereby representing unconstrained integer quadratic programming problems as unconstrained binary quadratic programming problems. To respect some of the limitations of the currently developed quantum <b>annealers,</b> we propose an integer encoding, named bounded- coefficient encoding, in which we limit the size of the coefficients that appear in the encoding. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm for finding the upper bound on the coefficients of the encoding using the precision of the machine and the coefficients of the original integer problem.

Using a method to reliably calculate the degeneracies of the energy levels of large-scale spin-glass instances, we are able to estimate the instance-dependent effective temperature from the output of annealing runs. Our results show that the output distributions of the <b>annealers</b> do not in general correspond to classical Boltzmann distributions. For the small fraction of the instances for which classical thermalization takes place, we find that the effective temperatures are significantly higher than the physical temperatures. Our results in this regime provide further evidence for the `freeze-out' picture in which the output is sampled from equilibrium distributions determined at a point in time earlier in the quantum annealing process. We also find that the effective temperatures at different programming cycles fluctuate greatly, with the effect worsening with problem size.
