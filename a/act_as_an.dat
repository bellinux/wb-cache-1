5|$|A fourth reason {{concerns}} students {{rather than}} researchers: Gonzalez Galli argues that since people naturally imagine that evolution has a purpose or direction, then {{the use of}} teleological language by scientists may <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> obstacle to students when learning about natural selection. Such language, he argues, should be removed to make teaching more effective.|$|E
5|$|Because no ammonia was {{initially}} {{found in the}} vented material by INMS or UVIS, which could <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> antifreeze, it was thought such a heated, pressurized chamber would consist of nearly pure liquid water with a temperature of at least , because pure water requires more energy to melt.|$|E

5|$|Often, once an {{antibody}} and antigen bind, {{they become}} an immune complex, which {{functions as a}} unitary object and can <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> antigen in its own right, being countered by other antibodies. Similarly, haptens are small molecules that provoke no immune response by themselves, but once they bind to proteins, the resulting complex or hapten-carrier adduct is antigenic.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{rock pipit}} may be hunted by birds of prey, infested by parasites such as fleas, or <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> {{involuntary}} {{host to the}} common cuckoo, but overall its population is large and stable, and it is therefore evaluated as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E

50|$|Nicotine <b>acts</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{receptor}} agonist at most nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), except at two nicotinic receptor subunits (nAChRα9 and nAChRα10) where it <b>acts</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> receptor antagonist.|$|R
5|$|Due to the {{physical}} similarities which they share, the group 12 elements {{can be found in}} many common situations. Zinc and cadmium are commonly used as anti-corrosion (galvanization) agents as they will attract all local oxidation until they completely corrode. These protective coatings can be applied to other metals through by hot-dip galvanizing a substance into the molten form of the metal, or through the process of electroplating which may be passivated by the use of chromate salts. Group 12 elements are also used in electrochemistry as they may <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> alternative to the standard hydrogen electrode {{in addition to being a}} secondary reference electrode.|$|E
5|$|Feathers require {{maintenance}} and birds preen or groom them daily, spending {{an average of}} around 9% of their daily time on this. The bill is used to brush away foreign particles and to apply waxy secretions from the uropygial gland; these secretions protect the feathers' flexibility and <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> antimicrobial agent, inhibiting the growth of feather-degrading bacteria. This may be supplemented with the secretions of formic acid from ants, which birds receive through a behaviour known as anting, to remove feather parasites.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his service}} as governor, Morehead resumed his legal {{practice}} in Frankfort, Kentucky. In March 1837, he {{was commissioned by}} Governor James Clark to <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> agent for the state, selling bonds to fund internal improvements. He returned to the state House from 1837 to 1838, representing Franklin County. He {{was president of the}} Kentucky Board of Internal Improvements from 1838 to 1841, and in 1839, he and John Speed Smith were chosen as commissioners to the state of Ohio to secure the return of Kentucky-owned slaves as property of their masters. They were successful in this endeavor.|$|E

5|$|Fossils {{from the}} Pleistocene {{suggest that this}} species bred further south in Europe in the cool periods between glaciations than it does now. Its {{sensitivity}} to changing climate {{as well as to}} water table levels and the speed of vegetation growth has led to suggestions that its range is affected by global warming, and the ruff might <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> indicator species for monitoring climate change. Potential threats to this species may also include outbreaks of diseases to which it is susceptible such as influenza, botulism and avian malaria.|$|E
5|$|In England {{the brigade}} trained for {{operations}} in North-West Europe {{under the supervision}} of the I Airborne Corps. Although they were not scheduled to take part in the Normandy landings, under Operation Tuxedo the brigade would be parachuted in to support operations if any of the five invasion beaches experienced difficulties. Tuxedo was the only operation planned where the brigade would <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> independent formation whereas 13 other operations were prepared which would have deployed the entire 1st Airborne Division. However, the speed of the Allied advance towards the River Seine and then onwards from Paris northwards, was accomplished without airborne assistance and the plans were cancelled.|$|E
5|$|In many organisms, inhibitors may act {{as part of}} a {{feedback}} mechanism. If {{an enzyme}} produces too much of one substance in the organism, that substance may <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> inhibitor for the enzyme {{at the beginning of the}} pathway that produces it, causing production of the substance to slow down or stop when there is sufficient amount. This is a form of negative feedback. Major metabolic pathways such as the citric acid cycle make use of this mechanism.|$|E

5|$|Molluscs' circulatory {{systems are}} mainly open. Although {{molluscs}} are coelomates, their coeloms {{are reduced to}} fairly small spaces enclosing the heart and gonads. The main body cavity is a hemocoel through which blood and coelomic fluid circulate and which encloses {{most of the other}} internal organs. These hemocoelic spaces <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> efficient hydrostatic skeleton. The blood contains the respiratory pigment hemocyanin as an oxygen-carrier. The heart consists of one or more pairs of atria (auricles), which receive oxygenated blood from the gills and pump it to the ventricle, which pumps it into the aorta (main artery), which is fairly short and opens into the hemocoel.|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{with the}} {{implementation}} of the Dnestr space surveillance units, {{a modified version of the}} original Dnestr units, Dnestr-M radar, was being developed to <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> early warning radar to identify attacks by ballistic missiles. The first two were built at Murmansk in northern Russia (Olenegorsk – RO-1) and near Riga in the then Latvian SSR (Skrunda – RO-2). They constituted the beginning of the Soviet SPRN network, the equivalent of the NATO BMEWS.|$|E
5|$|The Victor was a futuristic-looking, {{streamlined}} aircraft, {{with four}} turbojet (later turbofan) engines {{buried in the}} thick wing roots. Distinguishing features of the Victor were its highly swept T-tail with considerable dihedral on the tail planes, and a prominent chin bulge that contained the targeting radar, cockpit, nose landing gear unit and an auxiliary bomb aimer's position. It was originally required by the specification that the whole nose section could be detached at high altitudes to <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> escape pod, but the Air Ministry abandoned this demand in 1950.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} {{suggestions}} that leaf shedding {{may be a}} response that provides protection against diseases and certain kinds of pests such as leaf miners and gall forming insects. Other responses such as the change of leaf colors prior to fall have also been suggested as adaptations that may help undermine the camouflage of herbivores. Autumn leaf color has also been suggested to <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> honest warning signal of defensive commitment towards insect pests that migrate to the trees in autumn.|$|E
5|$|Vanadinite {{is in the}} apatite {{group of}} phosphates, and forms a {{chemical}} series with the minerals pyromorphite (Pb5(PO4)3Cl) and mimetite (Pb5(AsO4)3Cl), with both of which it may form solid solutions. Whereas most chemical series involve the substitution of metallic ions, this series substitutes its anion groups; phosphate (PO4), arsenate (AsO4) and vanadate (VO4). Common impurities of vanadinite include phosphorus, arsenic and calcium, where these may <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> isomorphic substitute for vanadium. Vanadinite when containing a high amount of the arsenic impurity is known as endlichite.|$|E
5|$|With {{the first}} set of laws, the people created a three-person Executive Committee to <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> executive. The Second Executive Committee was elected on May 14, 1844, and served until June 12, 1845. A December 1844 {{amendment}} of the Organic Laws eliminated the Executive Committee in favor of a single governor, taking effect in June 1845. At that time George Abernethy was elected as the first governor. Abernethy would be the only governor under the Provisional Government. He was reelected in 1847, and served until 1849.|$|E
