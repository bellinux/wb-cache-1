5|$|All {{but two of}} the {{handcart}} companies {{successfully completed}} the rugged journey, with relatively few problems and only a few deaths. However, the fourth and fifth companies, known as the Willie and Martin Companies, respectively, had serious problems. The companies left Iowa City, Iowa, in July 1856, very late to begin the trip <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>plains.</b> They met severe winter weather west of present-day Casper, Wyoming, and continued to cope with deep snow and storms {{for the remainder of the}} journey. Food supplies were soon exhausted. Young organized a rescue effort that brought the companies in, but more than 210 of the 980 emigrants in the two parties died.|$|E
5|$|Exploration of salt domes <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>plains</b> of the Texas Gulf Coast {{took off}} with major oil fields opening at Sour Lake in 1902, Batson in 1903, Humble in 1905, and Goose Creek (modern Baytown) in 1908. Pipelines and {{refineries}} were built throughout much of Southeast Texas, leading to substantial industrialization, particularly around Houston and the Galveston Bay. The first offshore oilfield in the state opened in 1917 at Black Duck Bay on the Goose Creek field, although serious offshore exploration did not begin until the 1930s.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 13 September, Wolfe's army formed a line first with {{their backs to the}} river, then spread out <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>Plains</b> with its right {{anchored}} by the bluff along the St. Lawrence and its left by a bluff and thick wood above the St. Charles River. While the regular French forces were approaching from Beauport and Quebec, the Canadian militia and native sharpshooters engaged the British left flank, sheltering in the trees and scrub; the militia held these positions throughout the battle and fell back on this line during the general retreat, eventually holding the bridge over the St. Charles River.|$|E
5|$|The low {{gradually}} weakened {{and became}} less conducive for severe weather development on May 6. Nonetheless, the SPC issued a moderate risk for severe storms over parts of central Kansas and northern Oklahoma as the trough remained in place. The activity {{was far less}} than on the two previous days, however there were still several additional tornadoes <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>Plains</b> (all of them weak, mostly EF0). The system finally left the area on May 7 and did not produce any more significant severe weather.|$|E
5|$|The {{time period}} in the Plains where {{thunderstorm}} areas are most prevalent ranges between May and September. Mesoscale convective systems develop over the region during this time frame, with a bulk of the activity occurring between 6 and 9 p.m. local time. Mesoscale convective systems bring 30 to 70 percent of the annual warm season rainfall to the Plains. A subset of these systems known as mesoscale convective complexes lead to up to 10% of the annual rainfall <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>Plains</b> and Midwest. Squall lines account for 30% of the large thunderstorm complexes which move through the region.|$|E

5|$|In June 1847, Brannan {{traveled}} overland to Green River, Wyoming, to {{meet with}} Brigham Young, {{the head of the}} Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who was leading the first contingent of Mormon pioneers <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>plains</b> to the Great Basin region. Brannan urged Young to bring the Mormon pioneers to California as was previously planned, but Young rejected the proposal in favor of settling in what is present-day Utah. Brannan returned to northern California frustrated with how the meeting had gone. Being the only church leader of that region, Brannan continued to receive tithes of the church members, but no records have been found showing that those tithes were forwarded to the leaders of the church in Utah. Many members stopped paying him and began making their way eastward toward Salt Lake valley known to the Mormons as Zion.|$|E
5|$|The {{park and}} the Athi-Kapiti Plains are linked by the migrations of wild {{herbivore}} populations. The plains {{to the south of}} the park are important feeding areas during the wet season. Before the city was established, herds of animals followed the rains and moved <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>plains</b> from Mount Kilimanjaro to Mount Kenya, a migration as great as the migration that takes place on the Serengeti. However, as the city grew the park became the northernmost limit of the animal's migration. Migrating animals can reach their southern pastures by travelling through the part of the Athi plains called the Kitengela. This land is very important to their migration routes, but growth in the human population and the accompanying need for land threaten to cut off this traditional migration route from the park to land further south. The park's migratory species are also threatened by changing settlement patterns, fencing, and their closeness to Nairobi and other industrial towns. These activities fragment their ecosystems and occupy their habitat.|$|E

25|$|A {{moderate}} risk {{of severe}} thunderstorms was {{issued by the}} Storm Prediction Center for portions of eastern Iowa during the late afternoon of June 21. 7 tornadoes were reported <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>Plains</b> as a large cluster of storms moved eastward. Several reports of large hail exceeding golf ball size was reported. The strongest tornado took place in Norwalk, Iowa, it was an EF2 which heavily damaged homes.|$|E
25|$|After {{capturing}} the Ruhr, General Eisenhower {{planned to have}} the 21st Army Group continue its drive east <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>plains</b> of northern Germany to Berlin. The 12th and 6th Army Groups were to mount a subsidiary offensive to keep the Germans off balance and diminish their ability to stop the northern thrust. This secondary drive would also give Eisenhower a degree of flexibility in case the northern attack ran into difficulties.|$|E

25|$|In the end, Sam {{drove off}} both Gollum and Shelob, but Frodo had been stung by Shelob and {{appeared}} to have died from her venom. The Orcs found Frodo's body and stripped him of his gear, but Sam (thinking his friend dead) had already secured the Ring. Frodo regained consciousness and was freed from the orcs by Sam, and the two started the grueling journey <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>plains</b> of Mordor towards Mount Doom.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1805, a Crow camp traded at the Hidatsa villages on Knife River in present North Dakota. Chiefs Red Calf and Spotted Crow allowed the fur trader Francois-Antoine Larocque to join it on its way <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>plains</b> to the Yellowstone area. He {{travelled}} with it to a point west of the place where Billings, Montana, is today. The camp crossed Little Missouri River and Bighorn River on the way.|$|E
25|$|The Mormon Pioneer Overland Travel gathers {{information}} from journals, church history records, {{and other materials}} to locate the company in which an ancestor traveled <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>plains</b> to get to Utah. This covers known and unknown wagon trains from 1847-1868. It contains lists of passengers in companies as well as genealogical information about ancestors. It is the most comprehensive list of Mormon immigrants and the wagon trains that brought them to Utah.|$|E

25|$|Into western Arkansas, {{the river}} path works between the {{encroaching}} Boston and Ouachita Mountains, including many isolated, flat-topped mesas, buttes, or monadnocks such as Mount Nebo, Petit Jean Mountain, and Mount Magazine, {{the highest point}} in the state. The river valley then expands as it encounters much flatter land beginning just west of Little Rock, Arkansas. It continues eastward <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>plains</b> and forests of eastern Arkansas until it flows into the Mississippi River.|$|E
25|$|The Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851 {{with the}} United States {{confirmed}} as Crow lands {{a large area}} centered on the Big Horn Mountains: the area ran from the Big Horn Basin on the west, to the Musselshell River on the north, and east to the Powder River; it included the Tongue River basin. But for two centuries the Cheyenne and many bands of Lakota Sioux had been steadily migrating westward <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>plains,</b> and were still pressing hard on the Crows.|$|E
25|$|The goal of full {{employment}} was of most importance to Petty, having recognised that labour {{was one of}} the major sources of wealth for individuals and 'the greatest Wealth and Strength of the Kingdom'. In this vein, he extended the cloth-wine argument above, arguing that it is better to employ men and burn their product or to engage in extravagant public works projects, than to have indolent 'supernumeraries' in an economy â hence his famous example of relocating Stonehenge <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>plains</b> of Salisbury.|$|E
