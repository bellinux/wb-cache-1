5|$|A {{large number}} of {{decompression}} experiments were done using goats, which were compressed for three hours to assumed saturation, rapidly decompressed to surface pressure, and examined for symptoms of decompression sickness. Goats which had been compressed to 2.25 bar absolute or less {{showed no signs of}} DCS after rapid decompression to the surface. Goats compressed to 6 bar and rapidly decompressed to 2.6 bar (pressure ratio 2.3 to 1) also showed no signs of DCS. Haldane <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>co-workers</b> concluded that a decompression from saturation with a pressure ratio of 2 to 1 was unlikely to produce symptoms.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{travel to}} New York City to party with Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak). Ryan starts acting erratically, {{and it is}} {{revealed}} that he is {{under the influence of}} drugs. Meanwhile, the remaining employees are going to be forced to work on a Saturday. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) proposes that they work late on Friday, so {{they do not have to}} come in the next day. Once Jim <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>co-workers</b> finish working, they find that they are locked in, and everyone quickly places the blame on Jim.|$|E
5|$|The Australian {{zoologist}} John Veron <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>co-workers</b> analyzed ribosomal RNA in 1996 {{to obtain}} similar results to Romano and Palumbi, again {{concluding that the}} traditional families were plausible but that the suborders were incorrect. They also established that stony corals are monophyletic, including all the descendants of a common ancestor, but that they are divided into two groups, the robust and complex clades. Veron suggested that both morphological and molecular systems be used in future classification schemes.|$|E

5|$|The missionary {{churches are}} the true {{architectural}} highlights of the area. Hans Roth initiated an important restoration project in these missionary churches in 1972. In San Xavier, San Rafael de Velasco, San José de Chiquitos, Concepción, San Miguel de Velasco and Santa Ana de Velasco, these churches have undergone meticulous restoration. In the 1960s, the San Ignacio de Velasco church was replaced with modern construction; in the 1990s, Hans Roth <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>co-workers</b> brought the restoration {{as close as possible}} to the original edifices. In addition to the churches, Roth constructed more than a hundred new buildings, including schools and houses. He also founded museums and archives.|$|E

25|$|Interest in {{the notion}} of a snowball Earth {{increased}} dramatically after Paul F. Hoffman <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>co-workers</b> applied Kirschvink's ideas to a succession of Neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks in Namibia and elaborated upon the hypothesis in the journal Science in 1998 by incorporating such observations as the occurrence of cap carbonates.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, Smith <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>co-workers</b> has {{reported}} the second total synthesis of (-)-discodermolide. Smith adapted the triply convergent {{strategy of the}} Schreiber synthesis. In Smith’s strategy, all three fragments shared a common precursor, which {{was the product of}} a highly efficient 50g scale five-step conversion from 3-hydroxy-2-methylpropionate with 59% yield. An Evans syn aldol reaction was utilized to obtain the desired stereochemical outcome.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Paterson <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>co-workers</b> {{disclosed}} the third-generation total {{synthesis of}} (+)-discodermolide. The stepwise method used in previous generations {{to incorporate the}} C(1)–C(8) subunit {{was replaced by a}} late-stage Still-Gennari olefination, which leads to a notable improvement in convergence. The Paterson third-generation synthesis of (+)-discodermolide has an overall yield of 11.1% (highest reported to date) with a longest linear sequence of 21 steps and 37 total steps.|$|E

25|$|Paterson <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>co-workers</b> at the University of Cambridge have {{developed}} a strategy which utilizes novel chelation-controlled and reagent-controlled aldol reactions with high selectivity for subunit connections. Another feature of this synthesis was the induction of C(8)-C(9) olefin with cis geometry via Still-Gennari Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction. The Paterson first-generation synthesis of (+)-discodermolide has an overall yield of 10.3% with a longest linear sequence of 23 steps and 42 total steps.|$|E
25|$|With the new {{insights}} {{generated by the}} DNA-DNA hybridisation studies of Sibley <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>co-workers</b> {{toward the end of}} the 20th century, however, it became clear that these apparently unrelated birds were all descended from a common ancestor: the same crow-like ancestor that gave rise to the drongos. On that basis they were previously included as a subfamily of the Dicruridae, along with the fantails, although it is now treated at familial rank as Monarchidae.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, Smith <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>co-workers</b> have {{reported}} the first gram-scale synthesis of (+)-discodermolide, which make {{the development of}} (+)-discodermolide as a potential chemotherapeutic agent possible. This synthetic route was licensed to Novartis Pharmaceuticals. One of the major improvements was that no purification was required {{in the first four}} steps of the five-step sequence towards the common precursor as the intermiedate, aldol adduct, is a crystalline solid. A chelation-controlled Mukaiyama-aldol reaction was used to set the stereogenicity at C(5) of the lactone fragment.|$|E

25|$|Marshall <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>co-workers</b> {{used their}} {{asymmetric}} allenylmetal-homoaldol tactic to construct polypropionate frameworks of (+)-discodermolide. The novelty of the Marshall {{approach is that}} the three stereotriad subunits are assembled through addition of non-racemic allenylmetal reagents to (S)-3-silyloxy-2-methylpropanal to generate both syn/syn and syn/anti adducts. The central feature for the synthesis of the alkyl iodide fragment was the treatment of aldehyde to allenyltributylstannane {{in the presence of}} BF3-etherate to get the syn/syn isomer. Syn/anti methyl-hydroxyl-methyl stereotriads were obtained through the reaction between aldehyde and homochiral allenylzinc reagent.|$|E
25|$|The Visby lenses provide {{evidence}} that sophisticated lens-making techniques were being used by craftsmen over 1,000 years ago, {{at a time when}} researchers had only just begun to explore the laws of refraction. According to Schmidt <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>co-workers,</b> {{it is clear that the}} craftsmen worked by trial and error, since the mathematics to calculate the best form for a lens were not discovered until several hundred years later. It has been suggested that the knowledge required to make such lenses was restricted to only a few craftsmen, and perhaps a single person.|$|E
25|$|Eysenck's {{theory of}} {{personality}} is closely {{linked with the}} psychometric scales that he <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>co-workers</b> constructed. These included the Maudsley Personality Inventory (MPI), the Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI), the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ), {{as well as the}} revised version (EPQ-R) and its corresponding short-form (EPQ-R-S). The Eysenck Personality Profiler (EPP) breaks down different facets of each trait considered in the model. There has been some debate about whether these facets should include impulsivity as a facet of extraversion as Eysenck declared in his early work, or of psychoticism, as he declared in his later work.|$|E

25|$|Polymorphism {{was crucial}} to {{research}} in ecological genetics by E. B. Ford <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>co-workers</b> from the mid-1920s to the 1970s (similar work continues today, especially on mimicry). The results had a considerable effect on the mid-century evolutionary synthesis, and on present evolutionary theory. The work started {{at a time when}} natural selection was largely discounted as the leading mechanism for evolution, continued through the middle period when Sewall Wright's ideas on drift were prominent, to {{the last quarter of the}} 20th century when ideas such as Kimura's neutral theory of molecular evolution was given much attention. The significance of the work on ecological genetics is that it has shown how important selection is in the evolution of natural populations, and that selection is a much stronger force than was envisaged even by those population geneticists who believed in its importance, such as Haldane and Fisher.|$|E
25|$|Hiroshi Hiraoka, {{who was in}} the United States {{studying}} engineering, {{introduced the}} game to his co-workers at Japan’s national railways in 1878. He <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>co-workers</b> created the first baseball team, the Shimbashi Athletic Club, and dominated other teams which popped up in Japan. However, it wasn't until 1896 when a team from Ichikō, the elite University of Tokyo preparatory school, defeated a team from the Yokohama Country & Athletic Club 29 to 4 that the sport took a dominant hold in Japanese popular culture. The match was the first recorded international baseball game in Asia. After that victory, several other universities in Japan adopted the sport, and it quickly spread throughout Japan. Since then, teams from Japan have traveled to learn from their American counterparts. Waseda University {{was one of the first}} teams to cross the ocean to improve their skills. In 1905, the team traveled to the United States, where it played college teams from around the country. Other universities in Japan made similar trips, and U.S. teams traveled to Japan to play.|$|E
25|$|In 1836, after {{abolishing the}} {{division}} into voivodeships in the Congress Poland, they {{were replaced by}} the guberniyas. During that time, the Royal Castle became the residence of the Tsar's governor Ivan Paskievich. Paskievich charged Ludvik Corio – a Russian Colonel and architect – with designing new elevations and facades (the west, south and east parts). However, Russian authorities were {{not satisfied with the}} new designs and Corio was told to prepare another design – one that would refer to Kubicki's solutions (<b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>co-workers</b> Lelewel and Thomas). Finally, Corio rebuilt all the elevations and facades in the neoclassical style, but the Saxon Elevation was left the same. After the death of Paskievich in 1856, all the next governors resided in the Royal Castle's Chamberlain's Room. The Russian officials occupied rooms on both floors of the west and north wings of the castle. The governors were heavily guarded by the Russian army. Unfortunately, the living space that was assigned to these soldiers was the Parliamentary Hall, Library and barracks under the Castle. As a result, these were left devastated.|$|E
