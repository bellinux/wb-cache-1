30|$|Density {{anomalies}} vary significantly {{between the}} two sides of the north–north-east-trending Tancheng–Lujiang fault zone in the eastern NCC. The <b>anomalous</b> <b>body</b> A 2 on the west side of the fault zone exhibits notable characteristics, whereas the block on the east side of the fault zone exhibits no significant density anomalies. At the depths of 10 – 42  km (Fig.  12 a–c), the <b>anomalous</b> <b>body</b> A 2 on the west side exhibits significant low-density anomalies. At larger depths of 42 – 60  km, the maximum amplitude of the density anomalies in the <b>anomalous</b> <b>body</b> A 2 on the west side decreases, while the body A 3 exhibits no density variations. At the depth of 60  km, the density change of the <b>anomalous</b> <b>body</b> A 2 and A 3 is relatively gentle, and both the <b>anomalous</b> <b>body</b> A 2 on the west side and the <b>anomalous</b> <b>body</b> A 3 on the east side exhibit low-density anomalies, but the density characteristic of the body A 3 is not evident as the A 2 obviously. At depths of 80 – 120  km, the <b>anomalous</b> <b>body</b> A 2 on the west side transitions from a low-density <b>anomalous</b> <b>body</b> to a high-density <b>anomalous</b> <b>body,</b> whereas the A 3 still exhibits no obvious density variations. These results show that there is always a significant difference in the density distribution between the blocks on {{the two sides of the}} Tancheng–Lujiang fault zone and that the Tancheng–Lujiang fault zone has already penetrated the lithosphere.|$|E
30|$|There is {{a notable}} {{high-density}} <b>anomalous</b> <b>body</b> A 1 in the North China Basin {{at a depth}} of 10  km (Fig.  12 a) in the eastern NCC. The amplitude of the anomalies is significantly smaller {{at the top of the}} lower crust and the upper mantle (at depths of 25  km and 42  km, respectively). This <b>anomalous</b> <b>body</b> (Fig.  12 b, c) is mainly distributed along the Beijing–Baoding line. This finding matches the Tangshan–Xingtai seismic zone and is in good agreement with the results concerning the P-wave velocity derived from a study conducted by Huang and Zhao (2004).|$|E

Periodogram (PM), Multi Taper (MTM) and Maximum Entropy (MEM) methods, are proposed to derive {{the depth of the}} <b>anomalous</b> <b>bodies.</b> An extensive numerical analysis at varying the source parameters outlines that MEM is successful in determining the source depth with a percent error less than 5 %.

40|$|For {{the last}} twenty years {{magnetic}} surveys have frequently been applied in archaeological prospection. Among the different processing techniques that {{can be applied to the}} magnetic data, we studied the possibility for delineating the position and the spatial orientation of shallow depth magnetic <b>anomalous</b> <b>bodies.</b> The approach namely cross-correlation filter (or matched filter) has been adopted. At first, theoretical magnetic anomalies of total magnetic field, of its components and the vertical gradient of these, due to three-dimensional bodies, oriented S-N, E-W and NW-SE, were calculated. These synthetic bodies were considered a sum of many elementary prisms. Field measurements were simulated adding a noise component with different signal-to-noise ratio on the theoretical anomalies. In order to improve signal-to-noise ratio and to locate and delineate the orientation of the <b>anomalous</b> <b>bodies</b> a bidimensional cross-correlation technique was applied. Different synthetic anomalies, due to bodies with different dimensions, depths, susceptibility contrasts and geomagnetic parameters were used, as operators, to apply the cross-correlation technique. The efficiency of the method was improved using a normalised cross-correlation of the field data...|$|R

The <b>anomalous</b> <b>bodies</b> in this area exhibit significant segment-wise characteristics. The whole central NCC block is located in an orogenic belt, where the mantle temperature is relatively high; {{the results show that}} this area is significantly affected by both temperature and composition. A high heat-flow environment exists in this area, causing the upwelling of hot material in the deep asthenosphere, which modifies the lithospheric mantle.|$|R
40|$|The Culture of Sensibility {{permeates}} both Burney’s and Austen’s novels. Burney and Austen both use anomalous {{bodies and}} minds {{as a vehicle}} to explore the performative requirements of the Culture of Sensibility. The performance of disability, including bodily manifestations of nervous disorders, melancholy, and hypochondria, allows sensibility to become visible on the body. This dissertation examines the similarities between Burney’s and Austen’s portrayals of disability in order to understand how Austen’s texts engage and reflect Burney’s influence. Despite the frequency with which disability is necessary for the production of Sensibility, the connection between disability and Sensibility remains unexplored. This dissertation investigates the connection between various performances of disability with the Culture of Sensibility and exposes the narrative reliance on the <b>anomalous</b> <b>body</b> in both Burney’s and Austen’s novels. Through a combination of disability theory and performance theory, this dissertation examines the Culture of Sensibility’s reliance on the non-normative body for the performance of sentimental behaviour. Disability theory allows for the examination of the <b>anomalous</b> <b>body</b> beyond that of a strictly medical definition. Mansfield Park’s Fanny Price illustrates the difference between the medical and social construction of disability. Using only the medical model, Fanny’s debility represents her poor health; however, the social construction of disability connects Fanny’s debility to the fetishization of the <b>anomalous</b> <b>body</b> by the Culture of Sensibility. Disability features in Burney’s and Austen’s courtship narratives, as temporary physical and mental impairment provide opportunities for physical proofs of Sensibility, somatic communication of desire, and narrative resolution. Both Burney’s and Austen’s illness narratives of characters with permanent disabilities reveal concerns of the appropriation of the ii invalid’s favourable position within the Culture of Sensibility through an affected performance of disability. Male characters with temporary or permanent physical impairment suffer effeminization and exclusion from courtship narratives, whereas instances of female invalidism contribute to successful resolution of courtship narratives. I conclude that Burney’s and Austen’s reliance on the <b>anomalous</b> <b>body</b> to prove sensibility indicates that the late-eighteenth century sentimental novel normalizes the <b>anomalous</b> <b>body...</b>|$|E

The amplitude of the analytical signal of the data was observed to mimic the conventional Fraser-filtered operation and was used to locate the exact location of the <b>anomalous</b> <b>body.</b> The in-phase component with the Hilbert transform yields an approximate depth to the top of the conductor which agree with the result of the vertical electrical sounding conducted at the vicinity of the <b>anomalous</b> <b>body...</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} method for 3 -D gravity {{inversion}} designed to obtain density contrast models described by subhorizontal layers limited by irregular discontinuity interfaces and models constituted by shallow basins with light infill. It {{is based on a}} previously published inversion method that provides, in a nearly automatic approach, the 3 -D geometry of isolated <b>anomalous</b> <b>bodies.</b> The basic adjustment constraints are model fitness (fitting the anomaly data) and model smoothness (minimizing the total anomalous mass). For models corresponding to subhorizontal layers, we consider an additional minimization condition: the proximity to prescribed horizontal interfaces. This condition is arranged by including an additional weighting (inverse proportional to the distance to the interface) in the covariance matrix for model parameters. The approach works, according a growth process that increases, step by step, the volume of the adjusted <b>anomalous</b> <b>bodies.</b> Some advantages of the method are simultaneous adjustment of a (linear) regional gravity trend, possibility of including simultaneously positive and negative anomalous structures in the model, and unified inversion approach for isolated bodies, basins, and subhorizontal interface structures. We include several simulation examples and an application case (layered model for the volcanic island of Tenerife). Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|A {{computational}} {{tool for}} {{the development and implementation}} of a recently published method of 3 -D (three dimensional) inversion for gravity data is presented. This method seeks to determine the geometry of an indefinite number of <b>anomalous</b> <b>bodies</b> with prescribed (fixed or variable) density contrasts. Positive and negative values being indiscriminately accepted in the model. The approach is based on a prismatic partition of the subsurface and attempts to determine the <b>anomalous</b> <b>bodies</b> by means of a "growth" sequence, analysing (systematically or randomly) the several model possibilities and from that choosing the best for the growth progress. Moreover, a regional trend for the gravity data can be simultaneously adjusted. The non-uniqueness of the gravity inversion is avoided by means of a mixed condition about the residuals and the whole <b>body</b> <b>anomalous</b> mass. This imersion method has been applied with good results to simulation tests and to several real examples. Here, we present a main program that realises, the inversion according to several possibilities for general application (scale of the survey, fixed or variable density contrasts, optional smoothing, optional trend adjustment, systematic or random exploration, optional a priori information, weighting, etc.). This program is presented along with a previous program for selection of unknowns and parameters and another program for visual presentation of the results. All three programs are written in Fortran 77 and completes the Inversion tool. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. ...|$|R
30|$|Before {{applying}} the method to real data examples, {{it has been}} successfully verified on noise-free numerical examples; it has recovered the actual model parameters. After that, the approach was assessed on noisy numerical data, and it is found stable and can estimate {{the parameters of the}} buried deposit with acceptable accuracy. However, some of the inverse parameters encountered some inaccuracy when the method was applied to residual data distorted, in terms of both magnitude and shape, by some significant neighboring gravity effects generated by nearby <b>anomalous</b> <b>bodies.</b>|$|R
30|$|The lower-velocity {{anomalies}} beneath Africa {{are suggested}} {{even by the}} early tomography models (e.g., Dziewonski, 1984). Their detailed structures have been studied extensively using regional array data (e.g., Ritsema et al., 1998; Ni et al., 2002, 2005; Ni and Helmberger, 2003). The results suggested that the volume of this <b>anomalous</b> <b>body</b> is large (about 1300 km high, 1200 km across, and 7000 km long), and that the velocity anomalies inside the body are strong (about a 3 % velocity reduction throughout this body).|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} is presented which determines bounds on velocity structure from travel-time residuals. The problem is first linearized and then discretized using a series expansion method. The solutions derived are extremal {{in that they}} minimize or maximize a property of the model. For a given data set, the solutions are unique to the linearized problem. Examples are presented in which bounds are placed on the total velocity anomaly and {{on the extent of}} the <b>anomalous</b> <b>body.</b> The method also provides a mapping from bounds on the data to bounds on the velocity distribution. Furthermore, the {{technique is}} applicable to one-, two-, or three-dimensional velocity distributions. As an example, the technique is applied to a set of teleseismic relative residuals recorded at Long Valley caldera, California. Two methods are proposed to deal with negative travel-time residuals. Upper bounds and lower bounds are placed on velocity perturbations at depth. The upper bounds indicate that teleseismic residuals cannot adequately constrain the velocity structure in Long Valley caldera. Lower bounds indicate where velocity perturbations must occur. The presence of a region of low velocity in the northwest portion of the Long Valley caldere, at a depth of 15 to 20 kin, is supported. Also a minimum width of 18 km is derived for any <b>anomalous</b> <b>body</b> which could give rise to the observations...|$|E

Third, the algorithm uses the exact forward modeling formula and evaluates the Jacobian (Fréchet) matrix (sensitivity matrix) of the scheme analytically and accurately. Fourth, the developed scheme (referred here as the logarithmic-space algorithm) employs the Tikhonov regularization (Tikhonov and Arsenin 1977) and the steepest descent (SD) and Gauss-Newton (GN) methods (e.g., Zhdanov 2002) {{in the space of}} logarithms of the model parameters (log(z), log(θ), log(L), log(Y), and log(|A|)) rather than in the space of the parameters themselves (z,θ,L,Y, and A). The use of the logarithmed parameters is essential in order to impose the positivity property of these parameters and hence to maintain the convergence and stability of the inversion scheme.

Secondly, we calculated the gravity anomaly, caused by the Moho discontinuity and the sedimentary layer discontinuity, by the Parker formula. Thirdly, the gravity anomaly of the spherical harmonics with 2 – 40 order for the <b>anomalous</b> <b>body</b> below the lithosphere is calculated based on the model of EGM 96.

40|$|It {{has been}} argued that {{hallucinations}} which appear to involve shifts in egocentric perspective (e. g., the out-of-body experience, OBE) reflect specific biases in exocentric perspective-taking processes. Via a newly devised perspective-taking task, we examined whether such biases in perspective-taking were present in relation to specific dissociative <b>anomalous</b> <b>body</b> experiences (ABE) - namely the OBE. Participants also completed the Cambridge Depersonalization Scale (CDS; Sierra and Berrios, 2000) which provided measures of additional embodied ABE (unreality of self) and measures of derealization (unreality of surroundings). There were no reliable differences in the level of ABE, emotional numbing, and anomalies in sensory recall reported between the OBE and control group as measured by the corresponding CDS subscales. In contrast, the OBE group did provide significantly elevated measures of derealization ("alienation from surroundings" CDS subscale) relative to the control group. At the same time we also found that the OBE group was significantly more efficient at completing all aspects of the perspective-taking task relative to controls. Collectively, the current findings support fractionating the typically unitary notion of dissociation by proposing a distinction between embodied dissociative experiences and disembodied dissociative experiences - with only the latter being associated with exocentric perspective-taking mechanisms. Our findings - obtained with an ecologically valid task and a homogeneous OBE group - also call for a re-evaluation of the relationship between OBEs and perspective-taking in terms of facilitated disembodied experiences...|$|E

Heat-flow data indicate that the thinner and more active crust of the Pannonian Basin has a value nearly three times that of the Finnish Svecofennian Province. An ovoid positive CHAMP gravity anomaly (- 4 mGal) is quasi-coincidental with the CHAMP magnetic anomaly traverses the Pannonian Basin while ground based gravity mapping in Hungary shows that the free-air gravity anomalies across the Pannonian Basin are near 0 to + 20 mGal with shorter wavelength anomalies from + 40 to less than + 60 mGal and some 0 to greater than - 20 mGal. Larger anomalies are detected in the mountainous areas. The minor value anomalies can indicate the isostatic equilibrium for Hungary (the central part of the Pannonian Basin).

By defining the anomaly value at {{the origin and}} the anomaly value at different points on the profile, the problem of depth estimation {{is transformed into a}} problem of solving a nonlinear equation of the form () = 0. Knowing the depth, the shape factor can be estimated and finally the amplitude coefficient can be estimated. This technique is applicable for a class of geometrically simple <b>anomalous</b> <b>bodies,</b> including the semiinfinite vertical cylinder, the infinitely long horizontal cylinder, and the sphere. The efficiency of this technique is demonstrated with gravity anomaly due to a theoretical model, in each case with and without random errors. Finally, the applicability is illustrated using the residual gravity anomaly of Mobrun ore body, situated near Noranda, QC, Canada. The interpreted depth and the other model parameters are in good agreement with the known actual values...|$|R
40|$|A recent gravity survey {{composed}} of 317 bench marks {{all over the}} island of La Palma (Canary Islands) is used, in combination with satellite data for regional aspects, to obtain results about structural properties of the island connected with the tectonic environment and local volcanism. To that end, a nonlinear three-dimensional gravity inversion approach is considered. The inversion scheme provides, in a nonsubjective form, the geometry of the <b>anomalous</b> <b>bodies</b> constructed in a random growth process. Results from the inversion can be interpreted {{in the framework of}} the geologic evolution of this ocean island volcano as a complex composite volcano with a large central body with high-density corresponding to the older intrusive part of the basalt complex. New unexpected features are enlightened, such as large thermal anomalies in the upper mantle southward of La Palma, as well as fracture en echelon zones associable to a slow active process of dislocation related to the recent volcanism in the southern half of the island. The results obtained for La Palma as a test site testify to the usefulness of the developed gravity inversion methodology for structural studies on islands in general. Peer reviewe...|$|R
