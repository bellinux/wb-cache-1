In the Biomimetic Microsystems platform at the Wyss, microfabrication techniques from the computer industry are used to build functional circuits with living cells as components. The Ingber Laboratory at Children's Hospital addresses the fundamental problem of how cells decide whether to move, grow, contract, differentiate, or die during tissue development. The major focus is on angiogenesis—the growth of blood capillaries—a process that is critical for the growth of cancer and many other debilitating diseases. The group is also developing novel cancer reversal therapies.|$|R

40|$|As Brazil’s {{economic}} and political structures have stabilized over the past quarter century, the country has assumed an increasingly important role in global affairs. The dominant trends towards neo-liberalism in the global political-economy are being reproduced {{within the context of}} a state structure that has traditionally occupied a central role in the national economy. While transitions to neo-liberalism at the national scale occur more slowly I argue that it is within urban contexts that coalitions of political and economic interests transform space and social relations. In this sense, sports mega-events function as mechanisms for the implementation of neo-liberal modes of governance within urban contexts. This paper will examine the processes through which mega-events in Rio de Janeiro are staging the city as an <b>active</b> <b>laboratory</b> for new models of neo-liberal governance that are accelerating the transformation of Brazilian society...|$|E
40|$|To monitor {{risk factors}} for illness, we {{conducted}} a case-control study of sporadic Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O 157 (STEC O 157) infections in 1999 – 2000.

40|$|The authors {{describe}} {{a pilot project}} to standardize local laboratory data at five Indian Health Service (IHS) medical facilities by mapping laboratory test names to Logical Observation Identifier Names and Codes (LOINC).

Eleven percent to 27 % of the tests were mapped manually. They could not assign LOINC codes to 6 % to 19 % of the laboratory tests due to incomplete or incorrect information about these tests. The results achieved approximate other similar efforts. Mapping of laboratory test names to LOINC codes will allow IHS to aggregate laboratory data more easily for disease surveillance and clinical and administrative reporting efforts. This project may provide a model for standardization efforts in other health systems...|$|E
40|$|Background: Campylobacter is an {{important}} cause of foodborne illness in infants (younger than 1 year of age), but {{little is known about}} the sources of infection in this age group. Methods: Eight sites in the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) participated in a 24 -month population-based case-control study conducted in 2002 – 2004. Cases were infants with laboratory-confirmed Campylobacter infection ascertained through <b>active</b> <b>laboratory</b> surveillance, and controls were infants in the community.

40|$|ZFX, an X chromosome-linked gene {{encoding}} a zinc-finger protein, {{has previously}} been shown to escape X inactivation in humans. Here we report studies of the inactivation status of the homolog, Zfx, on the mouse X chromosome. We took advantage of both the preferential inactivation of the normal X chromosome in females carrying the T(X; 16) 16 H translocation and {{the high degree of}} nucleotide sequence variation between the laboratory strain of mouse [corrected] and Mus spretus genomes. An EcoRV restriction fragment difference between laboratory strain of mouse [corrected] and M. spretus was detected after amplification of Zfx transcripts using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Using this allelic variation, we assessed expression of the two Zfx genes in females carrying the T(X; 16) 16 H translocation (from laboratory strain of mouse [corrected]) and an intact X chromosome (from M. spretus). Such females exhibit Zfx transcription from the <b>active</b> <b>laboratory</b> strain of mouse [corrected] chromosome but not from the inactive M. spretus chromosome. These results indicate that the mouse Zfx gene is subject to X inactivation...|$|E

40|$|The {{area of the}} Aegean can be {{described}} as one of nature’s most <b>active</b> <b>laboratories.</b> The contemporary geomorphology of the Aegean is a result of diverse and still ongoing geological events, which coupled with climate changes, have created mountains and thousands of islands. The Aegean bridges three continents, where human activity has been recorded for at least 10, 000 years. Herpetofauna diversity offered early researchers the possibility of describing patterns in the Aegean, especially as the distributional limit for several species and faunal elements. The patterns initially described at a rather coarse scale formed the frame on which the application of new techniques opened new views and permitted finer analyses. Here, we assess recent works on the Aegean’s herpetofauna, outlining the role of sea barriers, especially the Mid Aegean Trench (MAT). We propose four basic patterns (pre-MAT, post-MAT, newcomers, and that of an outlier) and discuss exceptions to these patterns, to interpret the diversity recorded. The interdisciplinary study of taxonomy helps explaining the observed diversity and provides powerful arguments for how exploring diversity can be used to explain more than biological processes...|$|R
