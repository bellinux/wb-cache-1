5|$|In Goddess-oriented worship, Vimala (Bimala) is {{regarded}} as the presiding goddess of the Purushottama (Puri) Shakti Pitha. Jagannath, <b>a</b> <b>form</b> of the god Vishnu/Krishna (Krishna is generally regarded as an avatar of Vishnu), is worshipped as the Pitha's Bhairava. This is a departure from the usual tradition of Bhairava as <b>a</b> <b>form</b> of Shiva. So, in this temple complex, Vishnu–one of the Hindu trinity–is equated with Shiva, another of the trinity; this is interpreted to convey the oneness of God. In this regard, Vimala - generally associated with Shiva's consort - is also considered as Lakshmi, the consort of Vishnu. Conversely, Tantrics consider Jagannath as Shiva-Bhairava, rather than <b>a</b> <b>form</b> of Vishnu.|$|E

40|$|A new {{approach}} to the <b>forming</b> control using <b>a</b> <b>forming</b> process model of rheological food dough is pre-sented. Manipulative operations of rheological objects {{can be found in}} many industrial fields such as food industry and medical product industry. For example, automatic operations of rheological objects such as food dough are eagerly required in food industry. Since food dough deforms during operation processes, it is neces-sary to estimate their deformation for the automatic operations. We will propose <b>a</b> <b>forming</b> control of rheological food dough using <b>a</b> <b>forming</b> process model. First, <b>an</b> extensional <b>forming</b> system of food dough is develope-d. Second, we will examine the deformations of actual food dough. Third, we will propose <b>a</b> <b>forming</b> process model consisting of the expansion part and the residu-al part. Finally, we will propose forming control using forming process model and will demonstrate the valid-ity of the proposed forming control experimentally. ...|$|R
