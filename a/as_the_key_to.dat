5|$|Domnall mac Causantín's {{nickname}} was dásachtach. This simply meant a madman, or, {{in early}} Irish law, a man {{not in control}} of his functions and hence without legal culpability. The following long reign (900–942/3) of his successor Causantín is more often regarded <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> formation of the Kingdom of Alba.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Vietnam War, Lê Duẩn took an {{aggressive}} posture. He saw attack <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> victory. When the North finally {{won the war}} in 1975, Lê Duẩn and his associates were overly optimistic about the future. The Second Five-Year Plan (1976–1980) was a failure and left the Vietnamese economy in crisis. Vietnam was then headed by a gerontocracy (in which the rulers are much older than the average adult). Vietnam became internationally isolated during Lê Duẩn's rule. In 1979 the country had invaded Kampuchea and ousted Pol Pot, fought a war with China and became dependent on Soviet economic aid. Lê Duẩn died in July 1986 and was succeeded by Trường Chinh.|$|E
5|$|Ukraine {{submitted}} {{an application}} {{to participate in}} the Eurasian Economic Union as an observer in August 2013. Viktor Yanukovych's decision to abandon an association agreement with the European Union and exclusively pursue integration with the EEU was a key factor in the Euromaidan protests that ended his term as president of Ukraine and led to the Crimean Crisis. The country's membership in the EEU was seen by some analysts <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> the success of the union as Ukraine has the second largest economy of any of the 15 former republics of the Soviet Union. With high tensions between Russia and Ukraine {{in the wake of the}} crisis, Ukraine decided to pursue integration with the EU.|$|E

5|$|White Northern Republicans, {{and some}} Democrats, became excited about an {{abolition}} amendment, holding meetings and issuing resolutions. Many blacks, {{particularly in the}} South, focused more on landownership and education <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> liberation. As slavery began to seem politically untenable, an array of Northern Democrats successively announced {{their support for the}} amendment, including Representative James Brooks, Senator Reverdy Johnson, and Tammany Hall, a powerful New York political machine.|$|E
5|$|Christy is {{the oldest}} of Carl and Helen Jenkins's two daughters. Both of her parents are mortal, and her powers were {{inherited}} from her maternal grandmother, making her a carrier of the genes determining magical ability. As a witch, Christy possesses the basic ability to cast spells, perform rituals, brew potions, scry for lost people or objects {{through the use of}} a crystal pendant, and communicate with the dead. She also possesses an advanced form of telepathy, enabling her to hear and project her thoughts, as well as channeling other magical creatures' powers. Carl and Helen Jenkins (David Starzyk and Barbara Niven) said Christy heard voices prior to her kidnapping, implying that this power was already active. As a firestarter, Christy had the power of pyrokinesis; this power could be augmented by Billie's projection powers to vanquish demons previously believed to be invincible. Christy was identified <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Key</b> <b>to</b> the Ultimate Power due to her relationship with Billie. Demain of Television Without Pity compared Christy to Buffy the Vampire Slayer character Dawn Summers as they were both referenced as the Key.|$|E
5|$|In April 1944, {{tests on}} the first sample of {{plutonium}} that had been produced with neutrons in a nuclear reactor revealed that reactor-bred plutonium contained five times more plutonium-240 than that hitherto produced in a cyclotrons. This unwanted isotope that spontaneously decayed and produced neutrons promised to cause a predetonation without sufficiently quick critical mass assembly. It now became apparent that only implosion would work for practical plutonium bombs; a powerful enough gun could not be constructed small enough to be carried in an aircraft, and plutonium-240 was {{even more difficult to}} separate from plutonium-239 than the isotopes of uranium that were giving the rest of the Manhattan Project such difficulties. Plutonium was unusable unless implosion worked, but only plutonium could be produced in quantities that would allow regular production of atomic bombs. Thus, the implosion technique now suddenly stood <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> production of nuclear weapons.|$|E

Freedmen strongly supported literacy and education <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>keys</b> <b>to</b> their future. When graduates returned to their largely impoverished rural southern communities, they still found few schools and educational resources, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> white-dominated state legislatures consistently underfunded black schools in their segregated system.|$|R
5|$|Leopold viewed {{a strong}} {{military}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> maintaining Belgian independence against France and, after the Franco-Prussian War, an expansionist Germany. After cutting {{the defense budget}} in the 1860s, the government was advised by a military commission to {{increase the size of}} the army and to abolish the system of Remplacement, whereby rich Belgians selected for military service by lot could pay for a substitute to take their place. Leopold II personally lobbied successive governments to implement the findings of the report and institute a fundamental reform of the army. Reform was opposed by both the Liberal and Catholic Parties, which viewed the army with suspicion and Remplacement as a key civil right. In a move supported only by the socialists, Remplacement was abolished in 1909. This was the last legal document signed before Leopold's death. Under the new system, one son per family would be liable for military service regardless of social class but the total size of the military remained the same.|$|E
5|$|Nixon's advisors denied he had {{abandoned}} {{a desire to}} bring the American people together. However, they were divided between those who sought national unity, and those, such as campaign manager and Attorney General John N. Mitchell, who felt Nixon should concentrate on keeping the voters who had cast their ballots for him, and should seek {{to win over the}} voters who had favored third-party candidate Alabama Governor George Wallace, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> reelection in 1972. According to Safire, after taking office, Nixon and his advisors decided he need not bring the country together, but need only work to secure his reelection by appealing to voters who were not hostile to Nixon and his policies—they became known as the Silent Majority. Historian Stanley Kutler suggested in his book on the Nixon administration that Nixon's policies widened divisions in America, but that the nation finally came together late in his presidency—to reject Nixon and demand his removal.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} Bartolomé Mitre {{stated that}} Manuel Belgrano held a deep admiration for George Washington, {{leader of the}} American Revolution and first President of the United States. Because of this, he worked on a translation of George Washington's Farewell Address into the Spanish language. He started working on it during the Paraguay Campaign, but before the battle of Tacuarí he destroyed all his papers, including the unfinished translation, {{to prevent them from}} falling into enemy hands. Belgrano resumed work on it afterwards and finished it before the Battle of Salta. He sent it to Buenos Aires for publication. George Washington's Farewell Address is considered, along with Gettysburg Address, {{one of the most important}} texts in the history of the United States. It talks about the importance of keeping national unity <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> maintain independence, prosperity, and freedom—ideas that were shared by Belgrano regarding the population of Hispanic America.|$|E

5|$|The long reign (900–942/3) of Causantín (Constantine II) {{is often}} {{regarded}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> {{formation of the}} Kingdom of Alba. He was later credited with bringing Scottish Christianity into conformity with the Catholic Church. After fighting many battles, his defeat at Brunanburh was followed by his retirement as a Culdee monk at St. Andrews. The period between the accession of his successor Máel Coluim I (Malcolm I) and Máel Coluim mac Cináeda (Malcolm II) was marked by {{good relations with the}} Wessex rulers of England, intense internal dynastic disunity and relatively successful expansionary policies. In 945, Máel Coluim I annexed Strathclyde, where the kings of Alba had probably exercised some authority since the later ninth century, as part of an agreement with King Edmund of England. This event was offset by loss of control in Moray. The reign of King Donnchad I (Duncan I) from 1034 was marred by failed military adventures, and he was defeated and killed by MacBeth, the Mormaer of Moray, who became king in 1040. MacBeth ruled for 17 years before he was overthrown by Máel Coluim, the son of Donnchad, who some months later defeated MacBeth's step-son and successor Lulach to become king Máel Coluim III (Malcolm III).|$|E
5|$|To {{promote the}} game, Valve has {{produced}} three machinima trailers depicting {{the game in}} play. The trailers are themed around wartime propaganda news reports for both Germany and the United States. To convey this effect, the trailers make extensive usage of the Source engine's capabilities for film grain, color correction, motion blur and depth of field, as well as sepia toning. The first trailer was released {{as part of the}} game's post-release marketing on December 20, 2005. Entitled Prelude to Victory, the trailer depicted a large firefight in the game as a report from the German perspective, complete with a commentator speaking in the German language. Two further trailers were released to promote the major update to Day of Defeat: Source {{in the second quarter of}} 2006. The trailers, both from the American viewpoint, displayed how the new detonation gameplay worked, emphasising teamwork <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> success, as well as introducing the viewer to the two new maps added by the update. To further create interest in the game, Valve has opened Day of Defeat: Source to three free weekends, the first taking place on February 10, 2006, the second on July 8, 2006 and the third on July 4, 2008, where anyone with a Steam account could download and play the game for a maximum of 48 hours free of charge.|$|E
5|$|With the Halliwells' help, Billie {{attempts}} to help Christy reintegrate back into {{everyday life and}} to gain control over her powers. Billie and the Halliwells are unaware of Christy's collaboration with the Triad. The Triad identifies Billie as the Ultimate Power, which was foreshadowed in earlier episodes as the season's big bad, and refers to Christy <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> unlocking Billie's power. The Triad arranges for Christy's parents to be killed {{by a pair of}} Noxon demons (John Rosenfeld and David S. Lee), believing prolonged contact with them could sway her morality to the side of good. Billie becomes angry by the Halliwell sisters when they decide to interrogate the demons to gather more information about the Ultimate Power rather than killing them to avenge her parents' deaths. Christy uses Billie's feeling of betrayal to turn her against the Charmed Ones. Billie and Christy vanquish the Noxon demons, who were previously believed to be invincible, and the Halliwell sisters realize that Billie is the Ultimate Power.|$|E
