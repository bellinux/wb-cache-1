DeLee said that midwives stunted the progress of the obsetrical profession and said that he refused {{to take part in the}} education of a provider that lowered the standards of the profession. If obstetrics were seen as dignified work that could draw more than the menial fees charged by midwives, DeLee said, many young physicians would be willing to deliver the patients that were then under the care of midwives.|$|E

Drawing data {{from a variety of}} sources that looked at prison and general populations, the researchers found that the boom in prison population is hiding lowered rates of fertility and increased rates of involuntary migration to rural areas and morbidity that is marked by a greater exposure to and risk of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV or AIDS.|$|E

25|$|The {{first attempt}} to legalise {{euthanasia}} {{took place in the}} United States, when Henry Hunt introduced legislation into the General Assembly of Ohio in 1906. Hunt did so at the behest of Anna Hall, a wealthy heiress who was a major figure in the euthanasia movement during the early 20th century in the United States. Hall had watched her mother die after an extended battle with liver cancer, and had dedicated herself to ensuring that others would not have to endure the same suffering. Towards this end she engaged in an extensive letter writing campaign, recruited Lurana Sheldon and Maud Ballington Booth, and organised a debate on euthanasia at the <b>annual</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Humane Association in 1905 – described by Jacob Appel as the first significant public debate on the topic in the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|In August 2002, the General Assembly of the WPA {{was held}} during the WPA World Congress in Yokohama.

The visit was projected for the spring of 2003, in order to assure that a representative of the WPA could present a report during the <b>Annual</b> <b>Meeting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Psychiatric Association in May 2003, {{as well as at the}} annual meeting of the British Royal College of Psychiatrists in June and July of that year. The 2003 investigative mission never took place, and when the WPA did organize a visit to China, it was more a scientific exchange. In the meantime, the political abuse of psychiatry persists unabated.|$|E
