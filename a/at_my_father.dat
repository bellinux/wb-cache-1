So much had {{happened}} within such a few hours that I had lost all sense of time. When had we left our houses? And the ghetto? And the train? Was it only a week?

6000|$|... “Oh, rest easy, my dear coz,” {{said the}} young lady; “I {{took a look}} in <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> who is likely to sleep an hour; and by using due {{vigilance}} you will secure all the honors of the season.” ...|$|E

60|$|CANDIDA (touched). Do you know, {{you are a}} {{very nice}} boy, Eugene, with all your queerness. If you had laughed <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> I shouldn't have minded; but I like you ever so much better for being nice to him.|$|E
6000|$|It was the {{shortest}} reply {{that he could}} choose. Having flung it at me, he still persisted in looking <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and speaking to my father: [...] "Do you think of trying change of air, Mr. Gracedieu, when you feel strong enough to travel?" ...|$|E
6000|$|THE GRAND DUCHESS. My poor Strammfest: {{you were}} not often enough at court to tire of it.

60|$|Clara was {{measuring}} {{one of my}} over-crowded book-shelves, with a {{piece of}} string; and was apparently just about to compare the length of it with a vacant space on the wall close by, when I came in. Seeing me, she stopped; and looked round significantly <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> who was standing near her, with a file of papers in his hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nigher forty, it seems," [...] he muttered. [...] "Why, when I look <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> sir, {{and come}} to think of it," [...] {{addressing}} Redlaw, with an impatience and irritation that were quite new, [...] "I'm whipped if I can see anything in him but a calendar of ever so many years of eating and drinking, and making himself comfortable, over and over again." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{looked at}} it and fell back with a deadly shriek of horror. It was an {{instantaneous}} photograph. It represented a scene just before the one the Inspector gave me. And there, in its midst, I saw myself as a girl, with a pistol in my hand. The muzzle flashed and smoked. I knew the whole truth. It was I myself who held the pistol and fired <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>father!</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{have met}} Mr Berrington <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> several times," [...] said Aileen, {{resuming}} her seat, and bestowing a minute examination {{on the corner}} of her handkerchief.|$|R

6000|$|... "Why, of course, Captain Griffiths," [...] she said. [...] "Mr. Lessingham was <b>at</b> {{college with}} <b>my</b> brother, {{and one of}} his best friends. He has shot down <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> place in Cheshire." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dere is a way, Evans, {{as you and}} I know py experience," [...] resumed the Colonel, winking again <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> [...] "to go rount the Hudson altoget'er. To pe sure, {{it is a long}} way, and a pit in the woots; but petter to untertake dat, than to haf the poy {{lose his}} l'arnin'.

6000|$|Thrice I looked <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> before I could speak, for I feared {{lest the}} blow should kill him. But speak I must at last, though I chose {{that it should}} be to Geoffrey my brother. 'Our mother lies murdered yonder on the Vineyard Hill. A Spanish man has done the deed, Juan de Garcia by name.' When my father heard these words his face became livid as though with pain of the heart, his jaw fell and a low moan issued from his open mouth. Presently he rested his hand upon the pommel of the saddle, and lifting his ghastly face he said: ...|$|E
60|$|Five {{minutes later}} {{my father came}} back panting, {{followed}} by the doctor. This was a big, black-bearded man; added {{to which he had}} the knack of looking bigger than even he really was. He came down the kitchen stairs two at a time, shaking the whole house. He brushed my mother aside, and bent over the unconscious Susan, who was on her back with her mouth wide open. Then he rose and looked <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and mother, who were watching him with troubled faces; and then he opened his mouth, and there came from it a roar of laughter, the like of which sound I had never heard.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir. I {{have played}} a little <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's,</b> {{but it will be}} a long time before I shall be good enough to play. I have heard <b>my</b> <b>father</b> say that there is better whist at St. Petersburg than in any place in the world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} that; but I have come {{altogether}} <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> instance, and I think, indeed, that, in fairness, I ought {{to tell you}} the truth as to what took place between me and your nephew." ...|$|R

6000|$|At length when I {{was eight}} or nine an aunt said to me, [...] "you are going to London. Here you are somebody. There you will be nobody at all." [...] I {{knew at the time}} that her words were a blow <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> not at me, but it was some years before I knew her reason. She thought so able a man as my father could have found out some way of {{painting}} more popular pictures if he had set his mind to it and that it was wrong of him [...] "to spend every evening at his club." [...] She had mistaken, for what she would have considered a place of wantonness, Heatherley's Art School.|$|E
60|$|Another who {{followed}} with sympathetic interest the domestic comedy was Susan, our maid-of-all-work, {{the first of}} a long and varied series, extending unto the advent of Amy, to whom the blessing of Heaven. Susan was a stout and elderly female, liable to sudden fits of sleepiness, the result, we were given to understand, of trouble; but her heart, it was her own proud boast, was always in the right place. She could never look <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and mother sitting anywhere near each other but she must flop down and weep awhile; the sight of connubial bliss always reminding her, so she would explain, of the past glories of her own married state.|$|E
6000|$|... "On {{our arrival}} at Harrow, {{we set out}} in search of Hargreaves and [...] Byron, but the latter was not at his tutor's. Three or four lads, [...] hearing my father's inquiries, set off at full speed to find him. They [...] soon {{discovered}} him, and, laughing most heartily, called out, 'Hallo, [...] Byron! here's a gentleman wants you.' And what do you think? He had [...] got on Drury's hat. I can still remember the arch cock of Byron's eye [...] at the hat and then <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> and the fun and merriment it caused [...] him {{and all of us}} whilst, during the day, he was perambulating the [...] highways and byeways of Ida with the hat on. 'Harrow Speech Day and [...] the Governor's Hat' was one of the standing rallying-points for Lord [...] Byron ever after." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{the summer}} vacation; and my two pupils had gone home. Thanks to a {{neighboring}} clergyman, who kindly undertook to perform my duties for me, I too obtained a fortnight's holiday, which I spent <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> house in London.|$|R

6000|$|Mr. Grey {{began by}} expressing {{surprise}} at seeing Captain Scarborough in town. [...] "Oh yes, I have come up. It {{does not matter}} why, because, as usual, I have put my foot in it. It was <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> bidding; {{but that does not}} matter." ...|$|R
