50|$|The reactor was now {{producing}} 5 {{percent of}} the minimum initial power level established as safe for the test. Control-room personnel decided to restore power by disabling the <b>automatic</b> system <b>governing</b> the control rods and manually extracting {{the majority of the}} reactor control rods to their upper limits. Several minutes elapsed between their extraction and the point that the power output began to increase and subsequently stabilize at 160-200 MW (thermal), a much smaller value than the planned 700 MW. The rapid reduction in the power during the initial shutdown, and the subsequent operation at a level of less than 200 MW led to increased poisoning of the reactor core by the accumulation of xenon-135. This restricted any further rise of reactor power, and made it necessary to extract additional control rods from the reactor core in order to counteract the poisoning.|$|R

40|$|Background: Optimization theory {{applied to}} <b>automatic</b> control allows <b>governing</b> actions {{reaching}} desired conditions but minimizing a given performance index. Such optimization tasks imply to solve complicated mathematical expressions. The inverse optimal control appears as alternative {{to find the}} optimal control law without the explicit solution for the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. Objective: To show {{the potential of the}} inverse optimal control for solving complex optimization problems in control theory. Methods: A general description of the optimal control problem is performed, followed by the justification of an inverse optimal approach. Examples for illustration are properly selected. Results: Mathematical formulations given are applied to solve analytically the cases of a linear optimal quadratic regulator (LQR) and a nonlinear inverse optimal Lyapunov-based control problem (CLF). Conclusion: It is possible to solve optimal control problems for nonlinear systems, without explicitly facing the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, by means of the inverse optimal control approach...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} a stand-alone excitation synchronous wind power generator (SESWPG) with power flow management strategy (PFMS). The rotor {{speed of the}} excitation synchronous generator tracks the utility grid frequency by using servo motor tracking technologies. The <b>automatic</b> voltage regulator <b>governs</b> the exciting current of generator to achieve the control goals of stable voltage. When wind power {{is less than the}} needs of the consumptive loading, the proposed PFMS increases motor torque to provide a positive power output for the loads, while keeping the generator speed constant. Conversely, during the periods of wind power greater than output loads, the redundant power of generator production is charged to the battery pack and the motor speed remains constant with very low power consumption. The advantage of the proposed SESWPG is that the generator can directly output stable alternating current (AC) electricity without using additional DC–AC converters. The operation principles with software simulation for the system are described in detail. Experimental results of a laboratory prototype are shown to verify the feasibility of the system...|$|R

40|$|Watching a real {{teacher in}} a real {{environment}} from a good distance and with a clear viewing angle has a signiﬁcant effect on learning physical tasks. This applies to physical-task learning in a mixed-reality environment as well. Observing and imitating body motion is important for learning some physical tasks. including spatial collaborative work. When people learn a task with physical objects. they {{want to try and}} practice the task with the actual objects. They also want to keep the referential behavior model close to them at all times. Showing the virtual teacher by using mixed-reality technology can create such an environment. and thus has been researched in this study. It is known that a virtual teacher-model’s position and orientation inﬂuence (a) the number of errors. and (b) the accomplishment time in physical-task learning using mixed-reality environments. This paper proposes an <b>automatic</b> adjustment method <b>governing</b> the virtual teacher‘s horizontal rotation angle. so that the learner can easily observe important body motions. The method divides the whole task motion into ﬁxed duration segments. and seeks the most important moving part of the body in each segment. and then rotates the virtual teacher to show the most important part to the learner accordingly. To evaluate the method. a generic physical-task learning experiment was conducted. The method was revealed to be effective for motions that gradually reposition the most important moving part. such as in some manufacturing and cooking tasks. This study is therefore considered likely to enhance the transference of physical-task skills...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} two decades we {{witnessed}} a rapid increase of the computational power governed by Moore's Law. As a side effect, the affordability of cheaper and faster CPUs increased as well. Therefore, many new “smart” devices flooded the market and made informational systems widely spread. The number of users of information systems has also increased many folds, and the user's characteristics have changed to include not {{only a small number of}} initiates but also a majority of non technical people. To make this transition possible systems' developers had to change the computer user interfaces in order to make it simpler and more intuitive. However, the interaction was still based on rather artificial devices such as mouse and keyboard. Since the Moore's Law continues to work over and over again we came to a critical moment when the current systems can easily cope with other input streams such as video and audio, to name the most important, and others. We can, therefore, envision systems with which we can communicate through speech and body movements and that can automatically and transparently adapt to the environment and user. This can be done for instance by recognizing the user affective state, by understanding the task of the user and recognizing the context of the interaction. Automatic speech recognition by capturing and processing the audio signal is one development in this direction. Even though in controlled settings automatic speech recognition has achieved spectacular results, its performance is still dependent on the context (for instance on the level of the background noise). Automatic lip reading has appeared in this context as a way to enhance automatic speech recognition in noisy environments. Even though it is still a relatively novel research domain, other applications were found which employ lip reading as stand alone: interfaces for hearing impaired persons, security applications, speech recovery from mute of deteriorated films, silence interfaces. With the advances in visual signal processing the research in lip reading was also revitalized. However, at the moment of writing of this thesis lip reading was still waiting for its great leap. This thesis investigates several techniques for directing lip reading towards more robust performances. The thesis starts by introducing the relevant methodologies that <b>govern</b> <b>automatic</b> lip reading. Next it introduces all the concepts needed to understand the technologies, experiments, results and discussions presented later on. It is, therefore, one of the most important parts of the thesis. The presentation of the state of the art in lip reading is setting the starting point of the research presented. Before, continuing to follow the lip reading process the thesis introduces the mathematical foundations that give the theoretical support for the analysis. All our systems are based on the Hidden Markov Models approach. This paradigm has proved to be very useful in similar problems and we successfully employed it for lip reading. The main idea behind it is the Bayesian rule which says that starting from some a-priori knowledge we can always improve our understanding of a system through observation. Observation translates into processing the video stream in a set of features that describe what is being said by the speaker. However, in order to appropriately train lip reading systems, a large amount of data is needed. The first important contribution of our research is a large data corpus for the Dutch language. This corpus, named “New Delft University of Technology Audio Visual Speech Corpus”, is at the date of writing this thesis one of the largest corpora for lip reading in Dutch. The corpus contains dual view high speed recordings (i. e. 100 Hz) of continuous speech in Dutch. During the building of the corpus, we also produced an incipient set of guidelines for building a data corpus for lip reading which we hope to be useful for other researchers. However, the core of this thesis consists in the data parametrization. Data parametrization is the process that transforms the input video data in a set of features that are used later on for training and testing the resulting recognizer. The parametrization should reduce the size of the input data while preserving the most important information related with what the speaker says. We investigated three data parametrization techniques each coming from a different category of algorithms. We used Active Appearance Models which generate a combined geometric and appearance based set of features, we used optical flow analysis which is an appearance based approach that directly accounts for the apparent movement on the speaker's face and we used a statistical approach which generates the geometry of lips without starting from an a-priori fixed model. During the research presented in this thesis we investigated the performances of these data parametrization techniques and we pointed out their strengths and weaknesses. We also analysed the performance of lip reading starting from other points of view. We analysed the influence of the sampling rate of the video data, the performance of the lip readers as a function of the recognition task but also the performance as a function of the size of the corpus used. Answering to all these questions improved our understanding of the limitations and the possible improvements of lip reading.
