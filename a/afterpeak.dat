She had cellular construction of double bottom which was 207 feet long and capacity of 850 tons. Its forpeak was of 85 tons while <b>afterpeak</b> was of 30 tons. Her register tonnage were , , 3345 tons under deck. Her triple expansion steam engine with single shaft and one screw had 3 cylinders with 24" [...] and 40" [...] diameter and had stroke of 65" [...] and 45" [...] generating 398 nominal horsepower. These engines were built by J. G. Kincaid & Co. Ltd., Greenock. She was owned by the Scindia Steam Navigation Company Ltd., Bombay and was registered in port of Bombay. She was 304.9 feet long, 49.0 feet broad and 24.3 feet deep.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{formation}} of ions following {{the termination of}} power in a pulsed glow discharge ion source is investigated. The populations of ionized species containing sputtered atoms M+, M+ 2, and MAr+ are observed to maximize after the termination of discharge power. Collisions involving sputtered atoms and metastable argon atoms, Penning and associative ionization, {{are considered to be}} responsible for the {{formation of}} ions in the discharge <b>afterpeak</b> time regime. The domination of these ion formation processes during the <b>afterpeak</b> time regime is supported by the results from investigations of discharge operating parameters, metastable argon atom quenching, and ion kinetic energy distributions...|$|E
40|$|The {{emission}} {{characteristics of}} afterglow in a microsecond pulsed glow discharge atomic source are studied to obtain {{insight into the}} excitation and recombination processes of analytes and fill gases. Each emission line features an initial intense peak {{at the beginning of}} the discharge pulse. The afterglow, which has been observed in the temporal behavior for some emission temporal profiles of analytes and discharge gases, exhibits an intense post-pulse signal maximized at 25 - 35 mu s after plasma termination, with a broader profile than their initial peaks. The afterglow of Ar I and Cu I spectra last approximately 100 mu s and 300 mu s, respectively, after the argon discharge pulse at 2. 0 torr pressure. The intensity of the <b>afterpeak</b> increases with the pulse width between 2 mu s to 200 mu s. A study of fourteen Ar I and twenty-seven Cu I lines show that transitions from high energy levels (5 p[14. 5 - 14. 7 eV] for Ar and above 6 eV for Cu) are relatively stronger in the afterglow. The highly excited argon and copper atoms are thought to be generated via the recombination of ions and electrons. The results are explained primarily in terms of an electron-electron-ion three-body recombination process.

40|$|AbstractThe {{internal}} energy distributions, P(ε), of a millisecond pulsed radio frequency glow discharge plasma were investigated using tungsten hexcarbonyl W(CO) 6 as a “thermometer molecule”. Vapor of the probe molecule, W(CO) 6, was {{introduced into the}} plasma and subjected to various ionization and excitation processes therein. The resultant molecular and fragment ions were monitored using a Time-of-Flight mass spectrometer. Ion abundance data were utilized {{in combination with the}} known energetics of W(CO) 6 to construct the P(ε) plots. The P(ε) of W(CO) 6 exhibited strong temporal dependence over the pulse cycle: Distinct {{internal energy}} distributions were found at the discharge breakdown period (prepeak), the steady state period (plateau), and the post-pulse period (<b>afterpeak).</b> Spatial variation in P(ε) was also observed, especially during the plateau regime. The observations suggest that this pulsed glow discharge affords excellent energy tunability {{that can be used to}} perform selective ionization and fragmentation for molecular, structural, and elemental information. Parametric studies were performed to evaluate the effects of discharge pressure and operating power on P(ε). These studies also provided insight into the correlation of the observed P(ε) s with the fundamental ionization and excitation mechanisms in the plasma. The temporal and spatial variations in P(ε) were hence attributed to changes in the dominant energy transfer processes at specific times in specific regions of the plasma. These data will be useful in future efforts to optimize the analytical performance of this source for chemical speciation...|$|E
