5|$|Bayliss's counsel, Rufus Isaacs, called Starling <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>first</b> witness. Starling {{admitted}} that he had broken the law by using the dog twice, but said that he had done so to avoid sacrificing two dogs. Bayliss testified that the dog had been given one-and-a-half grains of morphia earlier in the day, then six ounces of alcohol, chloroform and ether, delivered from an ante room to a tube connected to the dog's trachea. Bayliss said the tubes were fragile, and that had the dog been struggling they would have broken.|$|E

5|$|George III (George William Frederick; 4 June 1738 – 29 January 1820) was King of Great Britain and King of Ireland from 25 October 1760 {{until the}} union of the two {{countries}} on 1 January 1801, after which he was King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland until his death. He was concurrently Duke and prince-elector of Brunswick-Lüneburg ("Hanover") in the Holy Roman Empire before becoming King of Hanover on 12 October 1814. He was the third British monarch of the House of Hanover, but unlike his two predecessors, he was born in Britain, spoke English <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>first</b> language, and never visited Hanover.|$|E

5|$|Grove {{began his}} career with the Dallas Steers of the Texas League {{at the start of the}} 1938 season.

At the end of the season, the St. Paul Saints purchased Grove's contract to replenish their pitching staff.|$|E
5|$|However he {{struggled}} with poor form during the 1950–51 season <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>first</b> marriage {{was coming to an}} end and he came into increasing conflict with his teammates. He was angered when the club sold Jackie Sewell to Sheffield Wednesday in March 1951 – breaking Lawton's own transfer record in the process – as he felt the move showed a lack of ambition from the club's directors. He also found that the well paid job he was promised outside of football did not transpire. His tally of nine goals in 31 games in 1950–51 and 13 goals in 31 games in 1951–52 was disappointing, and he was made available for transfer.|$|E

As of October 2012, 31 temples announced by Monson were either under construction or in planning.|$|E

5|$|The purely orchestral works {{fall into}} two categories. The best-known ones in the West, and perhaps the finest in overall quality, are mainly {{programmatic}} in nature—in other words, the musical content {{and how it is}} handled in the piece is determined by the plot or characters in a story, the action in a painting or events reported through another non-musical source. The second category of works are more academic, such <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>First</b> and Third Symphonies and his Sinfonietta. In these, Rimsky-Korsakov still employed folk themes but subjected them to abstract rules of musical composition.|$|E

5|$|W. Somerset Maugham (1874– 1965) was a British playwright, {{novelist and}} short story writer. Born in the British Embassy in Paris, {{where his father}} worked, Maugham was an orphan {{by the age of}} ten. He was raised by an uncle, who tried to persuade the youngster to become an {{accountant}} or parson; Maugham instead trained as a doctor, although he never practised professionally, <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>first</b> novel, Liza of Lambeth, was published the same year he qualified.|$|E
5|$|Alboin was {{probably}} {{born in the}} 530s in Pannonia, the son of Audoin and his wife, Rodelinda. She {{may have been the}} niece of King Theodoric and betrothed to Audoin through the mediation of Emperor Justinian. Like his father, Alboin was raised a pagan, although Audoin had at one point attempted to gain Byzantine support against his neighbours by professing himself a Christian. Alboin took <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>first</b> wife the Christian Chlothsind, daughter of the Frankish King Chlothar. This marriage, which took place soon after the death of the Frankish ruler Theudebald in 555, is thought to reflect Audoin's decision to distance himself from the Byzantines, traditional allies of the Lombards, who had been lukewarm when it came to supporting Audoin against the Gepids. The new Frankish alliance was important because of the Franks' known hostility to the Byzantine empire, providing the Lombards with more than one option. However, the Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire interprets events and sources differently, believing that Alboin married Chlothsind when already a king in or shortly before 561, the year of Chlothar's death.|$|E
5|$|Altgens {{tried to}} find a good camera angle on the bridge, but uniformed police said it was private {{property}} and turned him away, and he moved to a location within the plaza. He began photographing the motorcade on Main Street as the vehicles approached Houston Street, and got a close-up of the presidential limousine as it turned right onto Houston. He then picked up his equipment bag and ran on the grass toward the south curb along Elm Street, stopping across from the Plaza's north colonnade. Altgens heard a loud noise {{at about the same time}} <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>first</b> photograph from that spot (simultaneous to Zapruder film frame 255), but he did not recall having any reaction since he thought the noise came from a firecracker.|$|E
