50|$|When making buko pie {{a double}} baking method is followed. The pie crust and the pie filling {{need to be}} {{prepared}} separately before combining the two together. First the pie crust is made by mixing flour, salt <b>and</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bowl. Afterwards, the mixture is made into dough by adding and mixing in ice water and egg yolks. The dough mixture is then refrigerated and thinly rolled out by using a rolling pin. To finish the crust component of the buko pie, the dough is baked and set aside to cool. Next, the pie filling is prepared. The pie filling ingredients listed above are mixed and cooked on low heat. Once the pie crust and the pie filling are finished, they are combined together by pouring the filling into the pie crust. A second crust is used to cover the filling and seal the pie from all sides. It is then baked a second time until the crust is lightly browned.|$|E

50|$|The Cordeliers cloister has {{a network}} of cellars and {{underground}} tunnels stretching for three kilometres beneath the village of Saint-Emilion. The constant temperature of 12 °C and total darkness they provide ensure perfect conditions for fermenting wines. LES CORDELIERS sparkling wines are produced and stored in these cellars using the traditional ‘champenoise’ method. The grapes are picked by hand using small, open trays and then lightly pressed (yielding 100l of wine per 150 kg of grapes) using pneumatic presses. This is followed by alcoholic fermentation and wine blending, using unique processes for each particular cuvée produced by LES CORDELIERS. The wines are transferred directly into bottles and yeast and sugar are added, prompting a natural fermentation process within the bottle which releases carbon dioxide into the wine to produce the sparkle. Following a period of aging the lees lasting for at least 12 months, the bottles undergo daily riddling to help settle out the yeast deposit ready for disgorging. After this the bottles are topped up with ‘liqueur d’expédition’ (a mixture of the base wine <b>and</b> <b>sugar)</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> process known as dosage, before the final corking and fitting of wire caps.|$|E
5000|$|The {{official}} {{investigation was}} concluded in 2002. According to the Russian State Prosecutor office, all apartment bombings were executed under command of ethnic Karachay Achemez Gochiyayev. The operations were planned by Ibn al-Khattab and Abu Omar al-Saif, Arab militants fighting in Chechnya {{on the side}} of Chechen insurgents. Both Russia and USA accuse Al-Khattab of having direct links with Al-Qaeda, though Khattab himself has always denied this. Al-Khattab and al-Saif were later killed during the Second Chechen War. The planning was carried out in Khattab's guerilla camps in Chechnya, [...] "Caucasus" [...] in Shatoy and [...] "Taliban" [...] in Avtury, according to the prosecution. Gochiyaev's group was trained at Chechen rebel bases in the towns of Serzhen-Yurt and Urus-Martan. The group's [...] "technical instructors" [...] were two Arab field commanders, Abu Umar and Abu Djafar, Al-Khattab was the bombings' brainchild. The explosives were prepared at a fertiliser factory in Urus-Martan Chechnya, by [...] "mixing aluminium powder, nitre <b>and</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> concrete mixer", or by also putting their RDX and TNT. From there they were sent to a food storage facility in Kislovodsk, which was managed by an uncle of one of the terrorists, Yusuf Krymshakhalov. Another conspirator, Ruslan Magayayev, leased a KamAZ truck in which the sacks were stored for two months. After everything was planned, the participants were organised into several groups which then transported the explosives to different cities.|$|E
40|$|The primary aim of {{this study}} is to assess the actual impact of {{healthcare}} public financing on population health status, while controlling for other non-financial health determinants. There are plenty of heterogeneous studies dealing with the negative or positive effects of different products consumption (e. g. sugar, alcohol, tobacco, fruits, vegetables, etc.) on people’s health. Starting from the relevant ones, we kept for our models those non-financial variables with public available data, used as control variables. After performing variable selection, we ranked the actual impact of different public expenditures categories on health status change, using simple and multiple regression fixed-effects techniques on a panel dataset regarding the European members of OECD (ranging from 1970 to 2014).   Our results show that financing preventive care has the strongest positive impact on the health status, followed by auxiliary (ancillary) services. Administrative expenditures for the healthcare system do not have a significant influence, suggesting there is available room to enhance the effectiveness and performance of sanitary institutions management. Our results also show that life expectancy is negatively affected by the consumption of alcohol <b>and</b> <b>sugar,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> decreasing order. These results were then connected with Romanian realities regarding health care financing and people’s consumption habits. In strong connection with our findings and these realities, this study provides, as a final part, a set of policy recommendations useful for Romanian public authorities in designing their policies, as well as for other interested non-governmental actors. </p...|$|E

40|$|Nonstructural {{carbohydrate}} reserves support tree {{metabolism and}} growth when current photosynthates are insufficient, offering resilience {{in times of}} stress. We monitored stemwood nonstructural carbohydrate (starch <b>and</b> <b>sugars)</b> concentrations of the dominant tree species at three sites in the northeastern United States. We estimated {{the mean age of}} the starch <b>and</b> <b>sugars</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> subset of trees using the radiocarbon ((14) C) bomb spike. With these data, we then tested different carbon (C) allocation schemes <b>in</b> <b>a</b> process-based model of forest C cycling. We found that the nonstructural carbohydrates are both highly dynamic and about a decade old. Seasonal dynamics in starch (two to four times higher in the growing season, lower in the dormant season) mirrored those of sugars. Radiocarbon-based estimates indicated that {{the mean age of the}} starch <b>and</b> <b>sugars</b> <b>in</b> red maple (Acer rubrum) was 7 - 14 yr. A two-pool (fast and slow cycling reserves) model structure gave reasonable estimates of the size and mean residence time of the total NSC pool, and greatly improved model predictions of interannual variability in woody biomass increment, compared with zero- or one-pool structures used in the majority of existing models. This highlights the importance of nonstructural carbohydrates in the context of forest ecosystem carbon cycling...|$|R
40|$|There is some {{evidence}} that plasma insulin and postload plasma glucose may be associated with risk of pancreatic cancer. Glycemic index and glycemic load are measures, which allow the carbohydrate content of individual foods to be classified according to their postprandial glycemic effects and hence their effects on circulating insulin levels. Therefore, we examined pancreatic cancer risk in association with glycemic index (GI), glycemic load (GL), and intake of dietary carbohydrate <b>and</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> prospective cohort of 49, 613 Canadian women enrolled in the National Breast Screening Study (NBSS) who completed a self-administered food frequency questionnaire between 1980 and 1985. Linkages to national cancer and mortality databases yielded data on cancer incidence and deaths, with follow-up ending between 1998 and 2000. During a mean 16. 5 years of follow-up, we observed 112 incident pancreatic cancer cases. There was no association between overall glycemic index, glycemic load, total carbohydrate and total sugar intake and pancreatic cancer risk. In multivariate adjusted models, the hazard ratio (HR) for the highest versus lowest quartile levels of overall GI and GL were 1. 43 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 56 – 3. 65, Ptrend 0. 58) and 0. 80 (95 % CI 0. 45 – 1. 41, Ptrend 0. 41), respectively. Our data suggest that overall glycemic index and glycemic load, as well as total sugar and total carbohydrate intake, are not associated with pancreatic cancer risk. However, given the limited literature regarding the role of diet in the etiology of pancreatic cancer, particularly with respect to glycemic index/load, further investigation is warranted...|$|E
