This iron-bearing rock extends under Lake Superior from the Mesabi and Vermilion Iron Ranges, to the Gogebic Iron Range from northern Wisconsin into the Marquette Range of the upper peninsula of Michigan, and west to the manganese-rich ore of the Cuyuna Iron Range.

25|$|Although theoretically, any living cell {{might be}} used as the {{background}} to a two-hybrid analysis, there <b>are</b> <b>practical</b> considerations that dictate which is chosen. The chosen cell line should be relatively cheap and easy to culture and sufficiently robust to withstand application of the investigative methods and reagents. The latter is especially important for doing high-throughput studies. Therefore the yeast S. cerevisiae has been the main host organism for two-hybrid studies. However it is not always the ideal system to study interacting proteins from other organisms. Yeast cells often {{do not have the same}} post translational modifications, have a different codon use or lack certain proteins that are important for the correct expression of the proteins. To cope with these problems several novel two-hybrid systems have been developed. Depending on the system used agar plates or specific growth medium is used to grow the cells and allow selection for interaction. The most common used method is the agar plating one where cells are plated on selective medium to see of interaction takes place. Cells that have no interaction proteins should not survive on this selective medium.|$|E

Although these algorithms theoretically classify the approximate protein structure alignment problem as [...] "tractable", they are still computationally too expensive for large-scale protein structure analysis.

This average does not seem to vary greatly across the medieval period. Horses appear to have been selectively bred for increased size from the 9th and 10th centuries, and by the 11th century the average warhorse was probably , a size verified by studies of Norman horseshoes as well as the depictions of horses on the Bayeux Tapestry.

2500|$|Dimension {{stone is}} one of the most {{sustainable}} of the industrial minerals since it is created by separating it from the natural bedrock underlying all land on every continent. [...] Dimension stone rates very well in terms of the criteria on the ASTM checklist for sustainability of building products: there are no toxic materials used in its processing, there are no direct greenhouse gas emissions during processing, the dust created is controlled, the water used is almost completely recycled (per OSHA/MSHA regulation), and it is a perpetual resource (virtually inexhaustible in a human time scale). [...] Dimension stone in use can last many generations, even centuries, so the dimension stone manufacturers have not needed a product recycling program. [...] However, there <b>are</b> <b>practical</b> qualifications to and constraints on that sustainability. [...] The dimension stone color and pattern can be changed by weathering when it is very near the surface. [...] The color and pattern can also be changed by proximity to an igneous rock body or by the presence of circulating groundwater charged with carbon dioxide (i.e., limestone, travertine, marble). [...] On the other hand, changes in color and/or pattern can be positive. [...] For example, there are at least 14 separately trade-named varieties of Carrara Marble with many patterns (or no patterns) ranging in shade from white to gray. [...] The presence of faults or closely spaced joints can render the stone unusable. [...] These faults and joints do not have to be at odd angles in the stone mass. [...] Closely spaced, wrongly spaced, or nonparallel bedding planes can make the stone unusable, particularly if the bedding planes are planes of weakness. [...] If part of the stone in one area is unusable, there will be another usable part of the stone elsewhere in the formation. [...] A quarry is not a short-term project unless it encounters one of these constraints. [...] Examples of big, old quarries operating for more than a century include the Barre (VT) granite quarry, the Georgia Marble quarry at Tate, several of the Carrara (Italy) marble quarries, and the Penrhyn (Wales) slate quarry. [...] A quarry will produce dust, noise, and some water pollution, but these can be remedied without too much trouble. [...] The landscape may also have to be restored if quarry waste is temporarily or permanently placed on adjacent land.|$|E
