25|$|Methods that {{evaluate}} only function values: If <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> continuously differentiable, then gradients can be approximated using finite differences, {{in which}} case a gradient-based method can be used.|$|E
25|$|Distributed {{computing}} also {{refers to}} the use of distributed systems to solve computational problems. In distributed computing, <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> divided into many tasks, each of which is solved by one or more computers, which communicate with each other by message passing.|$|E

25|$|Sufficient {{investment}} {{should be}} given to continue monitoring over the long term. When <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> found, action should be taken to correct it. Waterborne outbreaks in the United States decreased with the introduction of more stringent monitoring (and treatment) requirements in the early 90s.|$|E
25|$|In physics or {{engineering}} education, a Fermi problem, Fermi quiz, Fermi question, Fermi estimate, {{or order}} estimation is an estimation problem {{designed to teach}} dimensional analysis, approximation, and such <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> usually a back-of-the-envelope calculation. The estimation technique is named after physicist Enrico Fermi as he {{was known for his}} ability to make good approximate calculations with little or no actual data. Fermi problems typically involve making justified guesses about quantities and their variance or lower and upper bounds.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> {{that from}} 931 to 935, two ealdormen {{with the name}} Uhtred witness royal {{charters}}. The charters labelled Sawyer numbers 412, 413, 416, 417, 418, 407, and 434 are all subscribed by two Uhtreds. Historian Cyril Hart argued in 1975 that this second Uhtred was an ealdorman of Essex, but by 1987 thought his jurisdiction fell over the shires of North-Western Mercia. Hart believed that this Uhtred's successor in North-Western Mercia was Æthelmund, ruling between 940 and 965.|$|E

50|$|Many {{techniques}} and tools employed for creating effective solutions to <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>are</b> described in creativity {{techniques and}} problem-solving articles.|$|R
30|$|In {{the above}} example, <b>a</b> small-sized <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> {{designed}} and solved for several {{states and the}} analysis of the <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> showed model accuracy and performance. <b>A</b> large-sized <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> developed as follows.|$|R
25|$|Numerical {{stability}} {{is an important}} notion in numerical analysis. An algorithm is called numerically stable if an error, whatever its cause, does not grow to be much larger during the calculation. This happens if the problem is well-conditioned, meaning that the solution changes by {{only a small amount}} if the problem data are changed by a small amount. To the contrary, if <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> ill-conditioned, then any small error in the data will grow to be a large error.|$|E
25|$|To see why exponential-time {{algorithms}} {{are generally}} unusable in practice, consider {{a program that}} makes 2n operations before halting. For small n, say 100, and assuming {{for the sake of}} example that the computer does 1012 operations each second, the program would run for about 4×1010 years, which is the same order of magnitude as the age of the universe. Even with a much faster computer, the program would only be useful for very small instances and in that sense the intractability of <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> somewhat independent of technological progress. However, an exponential-time algorithm that takes 1.0001n operations is practical until n gets relatively large.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> {{regarded}} as inherently difficult if its solution requires significant resources, whatever the algorithm used. The theory formalizes this intuition, by introducing mathematical models of computation to study {{these problems and}} quantifying the amount of resources needed to solve them, such as time and storage. Other complexity measures are also used, such {{as the amount of}} communication (used in communication complexity), the number of gates in a circuit (used in circuit complexity) and the number of processors (used in parallel computing). One of the roles of computational complexity theory is to determine the practical limits on what computers can and cannot do.|$|E
3000|$|<b>A</b> {{decision}} <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> whose output <b>is</b> <b>a</b> single Boolean value: YES or NO. There {{are three}} classes of decision problems: [...]...|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>problem</b> frame <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{description}} of a recognizable class of problems, where the class of <b>problems</b> has <b>a</b> known solution. In <b>a</b> sense, <b>problem</b> frames <b>are</b> <b>problem</b> patterns.|$|R
50|$|Weakland {{has often}} {{been quoted as saying}} When you have <b>a</b> <b>problem,</b> life <b>is</b> the same damn thing over and over. When you no longer have <b>a</b> <b>problem,</b> life <b>is</b> one damn thing after another.|$|R
25|$|A simple {{example of}} such <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> to find the curve of {{shortest}} length connecting two points. If there are no constraints, the solution is obviously a straight line between the points. However, if the curve is constrained to lie on a surface in space, then the solution is less obvious, and possibly many solutions may exist. Such solutions are known as geodesics. A related problem is posed by Fermat's principle: light follows the path of shortest optical length connecting two points, where the optical length depends upon the material of the medium. One corresponding concept in mechanics is the principle of least action.|$|E
25|$|Aerodynamic {{problems}} {{can also be}} classified according to whether the flow speed is below, near or above the speed of sound. <b>A</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> called subsonic if all the speeds in the problem are less {{than the speed of}} sound, transonic if speeds both below and above the speed of sound are present (normally when the characteristic speed is approximately the speed of sound), supersonic when the characteristic flow speed is greater than the speed of sound, and hypersonic when the flow speed is much greater than the speed of sound. Aerodynamicists disagree over the precise definition of hypersonic flow; a rough definition considers flows with Mach numbers above 5 to be hypersonic.|$|E
25|$|In economics, many {{problems}} involve multiple objectives along with constraints on what combinations of those objectives are attainable. For example, consumer's demand for various goods {{is determined by}} the process of maximization of the utilities derived from those goods, subject to a constraint based on how much income is available to spend on those goods and on the prices of those goods. This constraint allows more of one good to be purchased only at the sacrifice of consuming less of another good; therefore, the various objectives (more consumption of each good is preferred) are in conflict with each other. A common method for analyzing such <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> to use a graph of indifference curves, representing preferences, and a budget constraint, representing the trade-offs that the consumer is faced with.|$|E

25|$|The {{constitution}} also vows {{to respect}} the human rights, defining the latter by its endorsement of the Charter of the United Nations, the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The constitutional endorsement of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is an aspect Chad has in common with many national constitutions: among African countries, it is endorsed by Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Comoros, Congo-Brazzaville, Côte d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal and Tanzania. <b>A</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> represented by {{the implementation of the}} human rights norms, as there is a legal vacuum {{due to the lack of}} the necessary provisions in the Criminal Code, which has to be amended so that national legislation is put into line with the international human rights instruments.|$|E
25|$|However, this {{identification}} is inexact: a polynomial-time solution with large exponent or large constant term grows quickly, {{and may be}} impractical for practical size problems; conversely, an exponential-time solution that grows slowly may be practical on realistic input, or a solution that {{takes a long time}} in the worst case may take a short time in most cases or the average case, and thus still be practical. Saying that <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> not in P does not imply that all large cases of the problem are hard or even that most of them are. For example, the decision problem in Presburger arithmetic has been shown not to be in P, yet algorithms have been written that solve the problem in reasonable times in most cases. Similarly, algorithms can solve the NP-complete knapsack problem over a wide range of sizes in less than quadratic time and SAT solvers routinely handle large instances of the NP-complete Boolean satisfiability problem.|$|E
500|$|Parameterized {{complexity}} is the complexity-theoretic {{study of}} problems that are naturally equipped with a small integer parameter [...] and for which the problem becomes more difficult as [...] increases, such as finding -cliques in graphs. <b>A</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> said to be fixed-parameter tractable {{if there is an}} algorithm for solving it on inputs of size , and a function , such that the algorithm runs in time [...] That is, it is fixed-parameter tractable if it can be solved in polynomial time for any fixed value of [...] and moreover if the exponent of the polynomial does not depend on [...]|$|E
5000|$|To {{show that}} <b>a</b> {{decision}} <b>problem</b> P <b>is</b> undecidable {{we must find}} a reduction from <b>a</b> decision <b>problem</b> which <b>is</b> already known to be undecidable to P. That reduction function must be a computable function. In particular, we often show that <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> P <b>is</b> undecidable by showing that the halting problem reduces to P.|$|R
40|$|Several interrelated {{problems}} {{in the area of}} neural network computations are described. First <b>an</b> interpolation <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> considered, then <b>a</b> control <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> reduced to <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> of interpolation by a neural network via Lyapunov function approach, and finally a new, faster method of learning as compared with the gradient descent method, was introduced...|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> {{mathematical}} <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> that <b>is</b> {{amenable to}} being represented, analyzed, and possibly solved, with {{the methods of}} mathematics. This can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> real-world <b>problem,</b> such as computing the orbits of the planets in the solar system, or <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> of <b>a</b> more abstract nature, such as Hilbert's problems.It can also <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> referring {{to the nature of}} mathematics itself, such as Russell's Paradox.|$|R
2500|$|<b>A</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> {{said to be}} sub-exponential time {{solvable}} if it can {{be solved}} in running times whose logarithms grow smaller than any given polynomial. More precisely, <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> in sub-exponential time if for every ε>0 there exists an algorithm which solves the problem in time O(2nε). [...] The set of all such problems is the complexity class SUBEXP which can be defined in terms of DTIME as follows.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fundamental}} {{understanding of}} the communication between {{the heart and the}} brain via the nervous system has led scientists into understanding its elaborate circuitry. [...] The brain emits neurological signals of oscillating frequencies. [...] The neural rhythms provide information on steady state conditions of healthy individuals. [...] Variations in the neural rhythms provide evidence that <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> present regarding physiologic regulation and help physicians determine the underlying condition quicker based on the given symptoms.|$|E
2500|$|... "I have {{no doubt}} that global—that a trend of global warming exists. I am not sure that {{it is fair to say}} that it is a problem we must wrestle with. To assume that it is <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> to assume that the state of Earth's climate today is the optimal climate, the best climate that we could have or ever have had and that we need to take steps to make sure that it doesn't change.|$|E
30|$|According to the {{contiguity}} principle [21], using {{examples and}} <b>problems</b> simultaneously should <b>be</b> {{more effective than}} using examples and problems separately, particularly when learners have to imitate worked-examples in order to solve current <b>problems.</b> When <b>an</b> example and <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>are</b> separated from one another by time, people must use their limited cognitive resources to search their past experiences {{and come up with}} a satisfying match to the current problem. This generates extraneous cognitive load that is unrelated to the instructional goal. In contrast, when an example and <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>are</b> presented simultaneously, the learner can hold both together in working memory and therefore make meaningful connections between them.|$|R

5000|$|<b>A</b> {{computational}} <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> generally {{defined in}} terms of its action on any valid input. Examples of <b>problems</b> might <b>be</b> [...] "given an integer n, determine whether n is prime", or [...] "given two numbers x and y, calculate the product x*y". As the inputs get bigger, the amount of computational resources needed to solve <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> will increase. Thus, the resources needed to solve <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>are</b> described in terms of asymptotic analysis, by identifying the resources {{as a function of the}} length or size of the input. Resource usage is often partially quantified using Big O notation.|$|R
