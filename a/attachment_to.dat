Through exploring the emotional <b>attachments</b> <b>to</b> place(s) of first and second generation Zimbabwean, Somali, Sudanese and Kenyan migrants, the paper interprets the emotions associated with senses of belonging through ideas of plurilocal homes and simultaneity of <b>attachments</b> <b>to</b> different places...|$|R

25|$|In Tenafly Eruv Association v. Borough of Tenafly (309 F.3d 144), Judge Ambro, {{writing for}} the United States Third Circuit Court of Appeals, held that Eruv Association members had no {{intrinsic}} right <b>to</b> add <b>attachments</b> <b>to</b> telephone poles on Borough property and that the borough, if it wished, could enact a general, neutral ordinance against all <b>attachments</b> <b>to</b> utility poles that could be enforced against the eruv. However, Judge Ambro held that in this case, the Borough had not enacted a genuinely general or neutral ordinance because it permitted {{a wide variety of}} <b>attachments</b> <b>to</b> utility poles for non-religious purposes, including posting signs and other items. Because it permitted <b>attachments</b> <b>to</b> utility poles for secular purposes, the court held, it could not selectively exclude attachments for religious purposes. The United States Supreme Court declined to hear the case. It was subsequently cited as precedent by a number of other federal courts deciding disputes between an eruv association and a local government.|$|R

This would significantly extend the definition beyond the ICD-10 and DSM-IV-TR definitions because those definitions are limited to situations where the child has no attachment or no <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> a specified attachment figure.|$|E

5|$|Glycocalyx is {{produced}} by many bacteria to surround their cells, and varies in structural complexity: ranging from a disorganised slime layer of extracellular polymeric substances to a highly structured capsule.

5|$|Verdi had {{intended}} to return to Italy in early 1848, but was prevented by work and illness, as well as, most probably, by his increasing <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> Strepponi. Verdi and Strepponi left Paris in July 1849, the immediate cause being an outbreak of cholera, and Verdi went directly to Busseto to continue work on completing his latest opera, Luisa Miller, for a production in Naples later in the year.|$|E
5|$|According to Christian theologian Gordon J. Wenham, {{the purpose}} of kashrut was to help Jews {{maintain}} a distinct and separate existence from other peoples; {{he says that the}} effect of the laws was to prevent socialization and intermarriage with non-Jews, preventing Jewish identity from being diluted. Wenham argued that since the impact of the food laws was a public affair, this would have enhanced Jewish <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> them as a reminder of their distinct status as Jews.|$|E

5|$|Alkan's <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> his Jewish origins is {{displayed}} both {{in his life}} and his work. He was the first composer to incorporate Jewish melodies in art music. Fluent in Hebrew and Greek, he devoted much time to a complete new translation of the Bible into French. This work, like many of his musical compositions, is now lost. Alkan never married, but his presumed son Élie-Miriam Delaborde was, like Alkan, a virtuoso performer on both the piano and the pedal piano, and edited a number of the elder composer's works.|$|E
5|$|Alkan's <b>attachment</b> <b>to</b> {{the music}} of his {{predecessors}} is demonstrated throughout his career, from his arrangements for keyboard of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony (1838), and of the minuet of Mozart's 40th Symphony (1844), through the sets Souvenirs des concerts du Conservatoire (1847 and 1861) and the set Souvenirs de musique de chambre (1862), which include transcriptions of music by Mozart, Beethoven, J. S. Bach, Haydn, Gluck, and others. In this context should be mentioned Alkan's extensive cadenza for Beethoven's 3rd Piano Concerto (1860), which includes quotes from the finale of Beethoven's 5th Symphony. Alkan's transcriptions, together with original music of Bach, Beethoven, Handel, Mendelssohn, Couperin and Rameau, were frequently played during the series of Petits Concerts given by Alkan at Erard.|$|E

Also, at this time the Grosvenor Gallery was generally more receptive than the Royal Academy to experimentation.
