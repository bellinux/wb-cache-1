40|$|<b>Autotuning</b> is an {{established}} technique for optimizing {{the performance of}} parallel applications. However, programmers must prepare applications for <b>autotuning,</b> which is tedious and error prone coding work. We demonstrate how applications become ready for <b>autotuning</b> with few or no modifications by extending Threading Building Blocks (TBB), a library for parallel programming, with <b>autotuning.</b> The extended TBB library optimizes all application-independent tuning parameters fully automatically. We compare manual effort, <b>autotuning</b> overhead and performance gains on 17 examples. While some examples benefit only slightly, others speed up by 28 % over standard TBB.

This paper proposes {{a model of the}} relation between power and temperature, a Bayesian inference formula to estimate the power consumption with estimates of estimation errors, and an experimental design (i. e. algorithm of choosing variants) for online <b>autotuning.</b> The proposed methods are evaluated by simulation, and applied to online power and energy optimizations...|$|E

The profiling has been carried out with the tools HPCtookit and Tuning and Analysis Utilities (TAU) with the target of finding compute kernels suitable for <b>autotuning.</b> <b>Autotuning</b> is regarded as a necessary step in achieving sustainable performance at an Exascale level as Exascale systems most likely will have a heterogeneous runtime environment. A heterogeneous runtime environment imposes a parameter space for the applications run time behavior which cannot be explored by a traditional compiler. Neither can the run time behavior be explored manually by the developer/code owner as this will be too time consuming. The tool Orio has been used for <b>autotuning</b> idenitified compute kernels. Orio has been used on traditional Intel processors, Intel Xeon Phi and NVIDIA GPUs. The compute kernels have a small contribution to the overall execution time for Code Saturne. By <b>autotuning</b> with Orio these kernels have been improved by 3 - 5 %. ...|$|E
