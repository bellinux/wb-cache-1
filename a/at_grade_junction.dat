50|$|Allerton Junction is an <b>at</b> <b>grade</b> <b>junction</b> {{just east}} of Liverpool South Parkway, Allerton, Merseyside. It {{takes its name from}} the former Allerton that South Parkway replaced.|$|E
2500|$|... 1970: Kilcroney dual {{carriageway}} (with <b>at</b> <b>grade</b> <b>junctions)</b> from Fasseroe to Kilmacanogue, west of Bray. 3km.|$|R
2500|$|... 1972: Kilpedder bypass; dual {{carriageway}} (with <b>at</b> <b>grade</b> <b>junctions)</b> but including one road underpass, the first [...] "flyover" [...] in Ireland. 2km.|$|R
50|$|The Vlorë Bypass {{consists}} of a 29 km long route composed of a new single carriageway highway, numerous new bridges and 8 <b>at</b> <b>grade</b> <b>junctions.</b> The project starts from the Roundabout {{at the end of}} the Double Carriageway Levan Vlora.|$|R
2500|$|Standard dual {{carriageway}} {{of the traditional}} type was mainly used for schemes on the N11 road, the N18 road and the N25 road. Plans {{for this type of}} {{dual carriageway}} on the N20 road have been superseded by newer plans to build a motorway, the M20, to replace most of this route. Traditionally this type of dual-carriageway had a mixture of <b>at</b> <b>grade</b> <b>junctions</b> (including roundabouts), <b>grade</b> separated <b>junctions,</b> and median crossings. Nowadays they are similar to HQDCs, but minor <b>at</b> <b>grade</b> exits—generally left turn only—are allowed and the design speed (by Irish standards) is only 100km/h. Median crossings and roundabouts are no longer generally found on these schemes. An example of a standard dual carriageway scheme, opened in 2006, [...] is the Ennis bypass although this road has <b>grade</b> separated <b>junctions</b> and no median crossings. This route was upgraded to motorway status in 2009.|$|R
50|$|The A160 starts <b>at</b> a <b>grade</b> {{separated}} <b>junction</b> <b>at</b> Rye Hill on the A180 at TA136144. No other road shares this junction.|$|R
5000|$|In Rochfortbridge it {{joins the}} R446, (the former N6), then leaves it southwards {{crossing}} over the M6 motorway <b>at</b> a <b>grade</b> separated <b>junction.</b>|$|R
50|$|The A4 {{motorway}} in Cyprus is a road which {{links the}} centre of Larnaca with the original terminal of Larnaca International Airport. Although it has an A designation, {{it is not a}} motorway, and contains all <b>at</b> <b>grade</b> separation <b>junctions</b> and a number of traffic lights. It follows the route of Artmedios Avenue.|$|R
50|$|There is no Junction 8, the {{junction}} number having been reserved {{for a potential}} extension of the M7 motorway from Lucan/Clondalkin to Naas. This {{is unlikely to be}} built given that the N7 Naas Road has been upgraded to dual three lane with <b>at</b> <b>grade</b> <b>junctions</b> converted to grade-separated interchanges or left-in, left-out (LILOs) junctions. However, it is an objective of South Dublin County Council to construct a new junction and use to it provide local access to the Cloverhill area of Palmerstown. This is also very unlikely to happen as the NRA have stated they are against the provision of new interchanges on the existing M50 as they are seen to contribute to traffic congestion on the route and undermine its function as a motorway.|$|R
5000|$|It {{crosses the}} R134 at a double {{roundabout}} junction and follows the Fonthill Road North for 5 km before terminating <b>at</b> a <b>grade</b> separated <b>junction</b> (junction 2) with the N4 at Quarryvale/Liffey Valley Shopping Centre.|$|R
50|$|Some {{sections}} {{of the rest of}} the route are of lower standard than that of those further east. Some traffic leaves for major holiday destinations such as Caernarfon or the Llŷn Peninsula, though much continues on to the port of Holyhead. As such part of the route is not classed as clearway and has two <b>at</b> <b>grade</b> <b>junctions</b> (roundabouts), Penmaenmawr (Junction 16) and Llanfairfechan (Junction 15). The Bangor bypass, in which the road previously terminated and became the A5 regains high standards and is such through the Anglesey section, bar the Britannia Bridge, which is a single carriageway deck above the North Wales Coast railway over the Menai Strait. In 2007 the Welsh Assembly Government undertook a consultation to determine which of four options would be preferred for a second crossing. This section intersects with the A487 towards Caernarfon, and the west coast of North Wales.|$|R
50|$|Right {{after the}} bridge the road intersects with the highway 21 <b>at</b> a <b>grade</b> {{separated}} <b>junction.</b> After the junction with the highway 21 the road continues as a four lane road with at-grade intersections for about 2 kilometers to the roundabout junction with regional route 922.|$|R
5000|$|The R323 road is a {{regional}} road in County Mayo, Ireland. Going from west to east, the route connects {{the towns of}} Kiltimagh, Knock, and Ballyhaunis. En route it crosses over the N17 national primary road <b>at</b> a <b>grade</b> separated <b>junction</b> {{in the village of}} Knock.|$|R
50|$|The east-west A47 Birmingham to Great Yarmouth road now {{avoids the}} town, using a northerly bypass opened in 1981. The A1065 Mildenhall to Fakenham road still {{passes through the}} centre of the town on its north-south route, {{intersecting}} with the A47 <b>at</b> a <b>grade</b> separated <b>junction</b> north of the town.|$|R
50|$|G21 {{begins as}} Capitol Expressway Auto Mall {{in the west}} <b>at</b> its {{separated}} <b>grade</b> <b>junction</b> with Almaden Expressway as a continuation of Hillsdale Avenue. It travels east along Capitol Expressway Auto Mall as an unsigned city maintained street until the road reaches State Route 87. Along this section Capitol Expressway is lined with many car dealerships with multiple driveways and turnoffs in addition to <b>at</b> <b>grade</b> crossings with smaller roads. At the interchange with SR 87 the road becomes Capitol Expressway and takes on a more traditional expressway appearance with limited turnoffs and most entrances being solely at large intersections.|$|R
50|$|Rugby {{station is}} located between two {{important}} junctions of the West Coast Main Line (WCML). To {{the east of}} the station, the original London and Birmingham Railway (L&BR) line (opened 1838) which runs directly to London, is joined <b>at</b> a <b>grade</b> separated <b>junction</b> by the Northampton loop line (opened 1881) which runs to Northampton before rejoining the line to London.|$|R
50|$|Before {{reaching}} Poole, {{the road}} joins the A35 <b>at</b> a <b>grade</b> separated <b>junction</b> before separating again at a roundabout {{at the north}} east end of Holes Bay. This section is a dual carriageway as far as Poole Railway Station. The final section crosses the Black Water Channel by the Poole Bridge before terminating at the roundabout on New Harbour Road where the Ferry Port is located.|$|R
50|$|The A1 {{is located}} {{just to the}} west of Peterborough. The road does not play a major part in Peterborough's road network itself {{although}} it is a major route. The road goes past RAF Wittering before meeting the A47 at Wansford on a <b>grade</b> separated <b>junction.</b> The A1 then moves south passing very close to the Nene Valley Railway line before reaching the city section of the A605 <b>at</b> another <b>grade</b> separated <b>junction</b> before reaching the A1139/A605 Oundle Section <b>grade</b> separated <b>junction.</b> This is also where the A1(M) starts and as a motorway the road quickly moves southward to reach the A15 at Norman Cross where the motorway moves out of the Peterborough area.|$|R
50|$|The section from Killingwoldgraves {{roundabout}} to {{the northern}} outskirts of Hull {{is known as the}} Beverley Bypass; it passes around the southern side of Beverley, with a short dual carriageway section. The road crosses over the A164 (Beverley to Humber bridge) <b>at</b> a <b>grade</b> separated <b>junction.</b> It also bridges the Cottingham to Hull section of the Hull to Bridlington line, as well as the Cottingham to Dunwell road (Dunswell lane, underpassed). A new roundabout junction was constructed on the A1079 around 2011 for the Swift Leisure group caravan factory north of Cottingham, East Riding of Yorkshire.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in Honiton off the A30 road, the A35 {{travels in}} a roughly south-easterly {{direction}} past Axminster, Charmouth and Bridport. After Bridport, {{there is a}} 2 mi section of dual carriageway, before it reaches its bypass around Dorchester. After Dorchester, there are approximately 8 mi of dual carriageway, including the Puddletown bypass, until it reaches its roundabout with the A31 road at Bere Regis. Continuing roughly south-easterly still, it becomes dual carriageway again near Upton, before returning to a single carriageway through Poole and Bournemouth, apart from a small section of dual carriageway on Wessex Way. On reaching Christchurch, there is a dual-carriageway bypass. It then heads in a north-easterly direction through the New Forest, passing through Lyndhurst where it meets the A337 road (to Lymington). It continues through Ashurst and Totton, meeting the A36 road and M271 motorway <b>at</b> <b>grade</b> separated <b>junctions.</b> It then turns north-east, acting as {{the western part of}} Southampton's ring road, with the A27 road making up the eastern part. It terminates at Swaythling, on the northern outskirts of Southampton.|$|R
50|$|The South Circular Road starts {{just south}} of the ferry {{terminal}} where the A2204 Ferry Approach meets the main east-west road through Woolwich, the A206. It heads south, climbing up John Wilson Street, a section of dual carriageway, until it meets Grand Depot Road and becomes single carriageway through Woolwich Common and Academy Road past the former Royal Military Academy. The route continues south to the A2 <b>at</b> a <b>grade</b> separated <b>junction</b> - one of only two on the route - and continues southwesterly as a dual carriageway, crossing Eltham Road (A210) and Sidcup Road (A20). At the junction with Burnt Ash Hill the road becomes urban single carriageway again, which it remains the case for most of the remainder of the route.|$|R
5000|$|The road {{is mainly}} single {{carriageway}} two-lane throughout. It has some upgraded sections, but generally the standard is poor or very poor. It starts (from the southwest) <b>at</b> a <b>grade</b> separated <b>junction</b> with the M7 motorway and by-passes Nenagh on its western side as single carriageway. Past Nenagh {{it is generally}} a single carriageway with no shoulders {{all the way to}} Birr. Many sections of this part of the route are very poor through County Tipperary with sharp bends. The route from Birr to Tullamore was upgraded in recent years and has good alignment, hard shoulders and a good surface as has the section from Tullamore to Kilbeggan which was upgraded in the 1970s. At Tullamore the route forms a bypass of Mucklagh and Tullamore.|$|R
25|$|The {{final section}} of the M1 was opened to Junction 1 at Staples Corner in 1977. There the {{motorway}} meets the North Circular Road (A406) <b>at</b> a <b>grade</b> separated <b>junction</b> and roundabout. Unrealised plans made in the 1960s {{would have seen the}} motorway continue through the junction on an elevated roadway to end at West Hampstead where it would have met the North Cross Route, the northern {{section of the}} London Motorway Box, a proposed ring of urban motorway around the central area. The layout of the Staples Corner junction was originally built in accordance with these plans although most of the London Ringways Plan had been cancelled by 1973. Around the same time the section between the M10 and Junction 5 was widened from the original two lanes to three.|$|R
50|$|Majura Road {{is a major}} {{arterial}} road in the eastern rural area of Canberra, {{the capital city of}} Australia. The road runs north to south, beginning <b>at</b> a <b>grade</b> separated <b>junction</b> with the Federal Highway 1 km inside the border of the Australian Capital Territory. The route followed by the road passes to the east of Mount Majura and mostly rural and industrial properties including the Majura Military Training Area, Mount Majura Winery and a training facility for the Australian Federal Police towards the Majura Park development at Canberra Airport where it ends at Fairbairn Avenue. The road provides a convenient bypass of the city's Inner North from the Gungahlin district to Queanbeyan. Canberra Airport and the Monaro Highway. The route is signposted as an alternative to National Highway 23, the main route between Sydney and the Snowy Mountains and carries considerable volumes of heavy vehicle and tourist traffic.|$|R
40|$|The {{relation}} between gold related levels in silicon is studied with deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) using linearly <b>graded</b> <b>junctions.</b> Since the depletion layer extends equally {{on both sides}} in the linearly <b>graded</b> <b>junction,</b> both the acceptor level in the upper half and the donor level in {{the lower half of the}} band gap are simultaneously monitored as majority-carrier traps. It is observed that the concentration of the acceptor level is about four times more than the donor level. The defect concentrations have been calculated using modified DLTS theory for linearly <b>graded</b> <b>junctions</b> where the influence of free-carrier tail has been properly considered for both the traps. The difference in concentrations indicates that the two deep levels originate from different configurations of the gold impurity in silicon...|$|R
40|$|A <b>graded</b> <b>junction</b> {{termination}} extension in a {{silicon carbide}} (SiC) semiconductor device and method of its fabrication using ion implementation techniques is provided for high power devices. The properties of silicon carbide (SiC) make this wide band gap semiconductor a promising material for high power devices. This potential is demonstrated in various {{devices such as}} p-n diodes, Schottky diodes, bipolar junction transistors, thyristors, etc. These devices require adequate and affordable termination techniques to reduce leakage current and increase breakdown voltage {{in order to maximize}} power handling capabilities. The <b>graded</b> <b>junction</b> termination extension disclosed is effective, self-aligned, and simplifies the implementation process...|$|R
50|$|It ends at Glasgow Cross, a <b>grade</b> <b>junction</b> {{with the}} A8 road (High Street/Saltmarket), as Trongate (which was {{historically}} {{part of the}} A82 road) continues {{into the heart of}} the City Centre unclassified.|$|R
50|$|It {{crosses the}} A5111 Derby ring road before a {{separated}} <b>grade</b> <b>junction</b> with the dual-carriageway A50 road. A little further south, the A5132 runs {{off to the}} west, just before the A514 crosses the River Trent over the narrow and historic Swarkestone Bridge.|$|R
50|$|The road has a <b>graded</b> <b>junction</b> {{with the}} main Dublin-Belfast A1 dual {{carriageway}} to the southeast of Banbridge. The section between Portadown and Katesbridge vaguely follows {{the course of the}} River Bann from its source in the Mourne Mountains, against the current.|$|R

50|$|The {{northern}} section resumes {{at the end}} of {{the slip}} roads of junction 35A of the M1 at Tankersley, at a roundabout for Warren and a business park. To the north is Tankersley Hall, which featured in the film Kes. At this point it is the boundary between the boroughs of Sheffield (to the south), and Barnsley (to the north), with the road in the borough of Barnsley. To the right is a turn off for Tankersley Park golf club. It skirts the north of New Biggin Plantation and Westwood Country Park, and is crossed by the Barnsley Boundary Walk, and the Trans Pennine Trail. At Upper Tankersley there is a busy roundabout with Westwood New Road (A61) at the Shell Wentworth Park Service Station, and to the north is the Wentworth Industrial Park. There is a Premier Inn on the right, next door to one of Britain's seven Taybarns pubs. From here the Sheffield-Barnsley boundary follows the A61 southwards to the A629 junction. It crosses the Storrs Dike near Bromley. It skirts the south of Copley Wood, and at Wortley meets the A629 <b>at</b> a <b>grade</b> separated <b>junction</b> - one of two junctions of this type along the road. Woodhead Road, for Wadsley Bridge, also joins from the south. Near Gosling Moor Farm, it is crossed by the Trans Pennine Trail and a former railway.|$|R
50|$|The route {{begins at}} Munich East station and runs {{from there to}} the east. On the heights of the S-Bahn Steinhausen {{workshop}} the line turns north and meets the connecting curve to München Trudering station. From there the line shares the tracks with the North Ring. In this section are the stations of Daglfing, Englschalking and Johanneskirchen. On the heights of the Heizkraftwerk Nord ("combined heat and power station north") the North Ring branches off to the west <b>at</b> a <b>grade</b> separated <b>junction</b> and the line reaches Unterföhring station, which is located in a tunnel. After crossing the Central Isar Canal (Mittlere-Isar-Kanal) and tunnelling under the Munich Ring Road, the line crosses fields to Ismaning before entering a tunnel. After Ismaning station the line returns to the surface. After passing under federal highway 471, it runs parallel to federal highway 388 to Fischerhäuser. Near Erching and the former Erching transmitter, the line passes Hallbergmoos station. This is far outside of Hallbergmoos town. Before the airport, the line reaches München Flughafen (Munich Airport) West junction, connecting with the link from Neufahrn. Both lines run via Flughafen Besucherpark ("airport visitor parking") station and then into a tunnel under the west apron and Terminal 1 {{to the end of the}} line at Munich Airport Terminal station, which is located below the central area of the airport.|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{the use of}} a quantum transport model to study heavily <b>graded</b> graphene p-n <b>junctions</b> in the quantum Hall regime. A combination of p-n interface roughness and delta function disorder potential allows us to compare experimental results on different devices from the literature. We find that wide p-n junctions suppress mixing of n ≠ 0 Landau levels. Our simulations spatially resolve carrier transport in the device, for the first time, revealing separation of higher order Landau levels in strongly <b>graded</b> <b>junctions,</b> which suppresses mixing...|$|R
