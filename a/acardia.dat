40|$|<b>Acardia</b> is a severe, complex {{malformation}} of monozygotic twinning, {{but beyond}} clinical case series, very few epidemiologic data are available. The goals {{of this study}} were to assess the epidemiologic characteristics of <b>acardia</b> from birth defect registries in the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Surveillance and Research (Clearinghouse), and compare these findings to current literature. The study included 17 surveillance programs of the Clearinghouse representing 23 countries from North and South America, Europe, China, and Australia. Anonymized individual records with clinical and demographic data were reviewed centrally by clinical geneticists. A literature search was performed. A total of 164 cases of <b>acardia</b> were reported from an underlying cohort of 21. 2 million births. Of these, 23 % were elective pregnancy terminations. Rates did not vary significantly by maternal age. For many cases, information on pregnancy exposures and genetic testing was missing. However, these limited data did not suggest high rates of chronic illnesses (diabetes, seizure disorders) or lifestyle factors such as smoking. One case had trisomy 13. Major malformations were reported in 2. 4 % of co-twins. With some basic assumptions, the total prevalence of <b>acardia</b> was estimated at 1 in 50, 000 - 70, 000 births, and 1 in 200 - 280 monozygotic twins. In summary, <b>acardia</b> is a dramatic, probably underreported, and incompletely understood malformation. Studies on its epidemiology and etiology are challenging and still rare. An international collaboration of epidemiologists, clinicians, and geneticists is necessary to understand the etiology, pathogenesis, and occurrence of this severe malformation complex.

In our previous model of <b>acardia,</b> pulmonary artery (PA) was clamped and did not receive any anterograde blood flow. A model of anterograde PA perfusion might be necessary to avoid ischemic pulmonary damage in prolonged ECMO in <b>acardia.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} describe the surgical technique and to determine the feasibility of an anterograde lung perfusion in <b>acardia</b> through the anastomosis of the right internal mammary artery (RIMA) to the PA. A venoarterial cardiopulmonary bypass was established in three pigs (72 [*]±[*] 2. 6 [*]kg) by the transjugular insertion to the caval axis of a double-staged cannula with carotid artery return. Heart was excised and ECMO was established as previously reported. Right internal mammary artery was harvested and after measurement of its output (93. 3 [*]±[*] 5. 8 [*]ml/min, representing 2. 17 % ± 0. 15 % of total pump flow), it was anastomosed to PA.

40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} tested {{whether the}} cardiac activity of {{two species of}} limpets (Cellana spp.), co-occurring on the rocky shores of Hong Kong but having different zonal distributions, was differently affected by variations in physical environmental characteristics. Experiments reproduced exposure of limpets to dehydration, high water temperature and reduced salinity, all conditions that can occasionally be faced by animals during low tides. Cardiographic traces were obtained using a non-invasive method based on infrared light sensors glued onto the limpet shell in a position directly over the heart. The signals were filtered and amplified, viewed on portable oscilloscopes and automatically transferred to computer. When tested under acclimation temperatures, the lower shore C. toreuma had faster heart rates than the upper shore C. grata, both in air and when submerged in seawater. Regular alternation of heartbeating and <b>acardia</b> were observed in C. grata exposed to both dry and saturated air, whilst C. toreuma showed transient <b>acardia</b> only during exposure to dry air. Both species showed a similar increase in heart rate with increasing temperature (Q 10 ∼ 1. 8 in the range 25 - 34 °C). When submerged in freshwater, C. grata regularly alternated <b>acardia</b> with beating at a rate slightly lower than in seawater, whilst C. toreuma showed strong bradycardia with reduction of beat amplitude, followed by steady <b>acardia.</b> Recovery of heart-beating after return to initial salinity was faster in C. grata, whilst C. toreuma, initially bradycardic, showed a consistent return to tachycardia. Overall, this study shows that the two congeneric species exhibit different cardiac responses to variations in environmental characteristics, which {{may be related to}} their differing vertical distribution. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|<b>Acardia</b> (Twin Reversed Arterial Perfusion Sequence) is a {{rare and}} one of the most bizarre {{congenital}} malformations occurring in multiple pregnancies. It affects 1 in 35, 000 pregnancies. Usually one twin shows absence of heart and other is structurally normal. The acardiac twin presents with many bizarre anomalies such as lack of head, thorax and upper extremities. We report a case of autopsy study of acardiac twin with severe malformations.

40|$|In 1990 Depledge and Andresen {{developed}} a #eld/laboratory, non-invasive technique {{to monitor the}} immediate response of cardiac activity in bivalves. Since then, several researchers have experienced and tested the variability of heart beat rate (HBR) and of associated metabolic rates under dierent conditions in intertidal molluscs. Review of HBR immediate response in acute exposure and acclimation to changes of salinity, thermal stressors and air exposure were examined to test dierent hypothesis. In intertidal Mediterranean and tropical limpets, the decrease in metabolic rate with a decrease in salinity was dierent in animals experiencing dierent degrees of salinity !uctuation in their respective microhabitats. Intertidal limpets respond to temperature increases, increasing HBR and metabolic rate. Furthermore, when reaching the highest temperature experienced in #eld, HBR shows extreme responses as secondary bradicardia. Finally, when exposed to dry/saturated air cycles, lower shore intertidal limpets show regular alternation of normal HBR and <b>acardia,</b> whilst the upper shore limpet showed transient <b>acardia</b> only during exposure to dry air. In conclusion, it was demonstrated that dierent patterns of immediate HBR responses couple dierent !uctuations of the physical environment experienced by individuals inhabiting dierent levels of the shore...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: In extreme situations, such as hyperacute {{rejection}} of heart transplant or major bleeding per-operating complications, an urgent heart explantation {{might be the}} only means of survival. The aim of this experimental study was to improve the surgical technique and the hemodynamics of an Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) support through a peripheral vascular access in an <b>acardia</b> model. Methods: An ECMO support was established in 7 bovine experiments (59 ± 6. 1 kg) by the transjugular insertion to the caval axis of a self-expanded cannula, with return through a carotid artery. After baseline measurements of pump flow and arterial and central venous pressure, ventricular fibrillation was induced (B), the great arteries were clamped, the heart was excised and right and left atria remnants, containing the pulmonary veins, were sutured together leaving an atrial septal defect (ASD) over the cannula in the caval axis. Measurements were taken with the pulmonary artery (PA) clamped (C) and anastomosed with the caval axis (D). Regular arterial and central venous blood gases tests were performed. The ANOVA test for repeated measures was used to test the null hypothesis and a Bonferroni t method for assessing the significance in the between groups pairwise comparison of mean pump flow. Results: Initial pump flow (A) was 4. 3 ± 0. 6 L/min dropping to 2. 8 ± 0. 7 L/min (P B-A= 0. 003) 10 minutes after induction of ventricular fibrillation (B). After cardiectomy, with the pulmonary artery clamped (C) it augmented not significantly to 3. 5 ± 0. 8 L/min (P C-B= 0. 33, P C-A= 0. 029). Finally, PA anastomosis to the caval axis was followed by an almost to baseline pump flow augmentation (4. 1 ± 0. 7 L/min, P D-B= 0. 009, P D-C= 0. 006, P D-A= 0. 597), permitting a full ECMO support in <b>acardia</b> by a peripheral vascular access. Conclusions: ECMO support in <b>acardia</b> is feasible, providing new opportunities in situations where heart must urgently be explanted, as in {{hyperacute rejection}} of heart transplant. Adequate drainage of pulmonary circulation is pivotal in order to avoid pulmonary congestion and loss of volume from the normal right to left shunt of bronchial vessels. Furthermore, the PA anastomosis to the caval axis not only improves pump flow but it also permits an ECMO support by a peripheral vascular access and the closure of the chest...|$|E

Our experimental team works on a project of peripheral extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support in <b>acardia</b> as a bridge to heart transplantation or artificial heart implantation. An ECMO support was established in five calves (58. 6 ± 6. 9 kg) by the transjugular insertion to the caval axis of a self-expanded cannula, with carotid artery return.

40|$|With {{the use of}} {{ultrasound}} examination during the first trimester of pregnancy becoming more widespread, the diagnosis of twin gestations is being made more frequently and earlier in the pregnancy. Similarly, the diagnosis of the first trimester demise of one fetus is also being made earlier and with greater frequency. This phenomenon {{is referred to as}} the "vanishing twin. " 1 The usual complication associated with the disappearing embryo is vaginal bleeding. Serial sonographic exam-inations of a pregnancy involving this phenomenon will show a distortion of one gestational sac in early pregnancy and disruption of the organization of the embryo, with a decrease in the echogenicity and definition of embryo shape. Over time, sonographic examination will show a separate, fluid-filled space adjacent to the normally progressing pregnancy and, finally, no evidence of the previous gestation. 1, 2 We report a case where a vanishing twin was diagnosed at a gestational age of 8 weeks, but upon serial scanning was noted to be an acardiac twin.

40|$|Acephalus <b>acardia</b> {{is among}} the most severe malformations {{described}} in fetuses, with an incidence of about 1 in 35, 000 births and is due to twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, frequently occurring in monochorionic twin pregnancies. The severity of the syndrome depends upon the type of the anastomoses arising between the vascular networks of the two fetuses, usually configuring the 'twin reverse arterial perfusion syndrome'. No clear and univocal etiological explanation is known, though few cases with chromosomal abnormalities have been reported so far. In some cases the fusion of two or more separate placentae of dizygotic fetuses occurs, leading to monochorionic twinning. Few cases of acardius amorphous with complete autoptical examination have been described so far. We report a case of acephalus acardius amorphus fetus, showing features of extremely severe sistemic immaturity with very few structured organs. Defined external and autoptic examinations have been performed on the dismorphic twin, along with the histological examination of tissue samples. Kariotype analysis showed sex discrepancy between the twins, as a normal female kariotype had been detected in the acephalus acardius while the living co-twin was a normal healthy male. The analysis of the placenta showed the vascular anomalies leading to the twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES In extreme scenarios, such as hyperacute {{rejection}} of heart transplant, an urgent heart explantation might be necessary. The {{aim of this}} experimental {{study was to determine}} the feasibility and to improve the haemodynamics of a venoarterial cardiopulmonary bypass after cardiectomy. METHODS A venoarterial cardiopulmonary bypass was established in seven calves (56. 4 ± 7 kg) by the transjugular insertion to the caval axis of a self-expanding cannula, with a carotid artery return. After baseline measurements (A), ventricular fibrillation was induced (B), great arteries were clamped (C), the heart was excised and the right and left atria remnants, containing the pulmonary veins, were sutured together leaving an atrial septal defect over the cannula in the caval axis (D). Measurements were taken with the pulmonary artery clamped and declamped. RESULTS Initial pump flow was 4. 16 ± 0. 75 l/min dropping to 2. 9 ± 0. 63 l/min (P(AB) < 0. 001) 10 min after induction of ventricular fibrillation. After cardiectomy with the pulmonary artery clamped, the pump flow increased non-significantly to 3. 20 ± 0. 78 l/min. After declamping, the flow significantly increased close to baseline levels (3. 61 ± 0. 73 l/min, P(DB) = 0. 009, P(DC) = 0. 017), supporting the notion that full cardiopulmonary bypass in <b>acardia</b> is feasible only if adequate drainage of pulmonary circulation is assured to avoid pulmonary congestion and loss of volume from the left-to-right shunt of bronchial vessels...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Twin {{reversed}} arterial perfusion syndrome (TRAP) or acardiac anomaly {{presents a}} rare and severe complication affecting monochorionic multiple pregnancies occurring in 1 per 35, 000 pregnancies or 1 per 100 of monozygotic twins. We report four cases of multiple pregnancies with TRAP diagnosed over the last 2 years, which were under check-up and treatment during the entire pregnancy course finalized by delivery. Outline of Cases. In two cases pregnancies were trigeminal, and other two geminal, with <b>acardia</b> of one foetus, by anceps type in three and acephalus in one. Expectant management was initially done in all cases. The relation of acardiac and donor abdominal circumference was below 50 % and negative signs of the donor’s cardiac failure were detected in two cases, so that expectative management was continued until delivery. Due to obstetric indications, a cesarean section {{was performed on the}} 33 rd and 34 th gestational week, and healthy newborns were delivered. Another two acardiac twins had abdominal circumference ratio between the acardiac fetus and the donor of over 50 %, and signs of congestive heart failure in the donor, which indicated invasive therapeutic procedure with absolute alcohol chemisclerosis; it was done by alcohol injection into the acardiac abdominal aorta which interrupted the retrograde blood-flow into the acardiac umbilicus. In the first case a successful intervention was performed at 29 th gestational week, but after 12 hours distress signs were registered. The delivery was finalized by a cesarean section, and a live donor was delivered. In the second case the intervention was successfully done at the 20 th gestational week, and after 96 hours from the intervention lethal ending of the donor was registered. Conclusion. Bearing in mind that the occurrence of TRAP is rare, it is necessary to sum-up experiences from a larger number of centres to determine efficient therapeutic procedure...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{present study}} was done to know and compare the {{incidence}} of congenital malformations in singleton and multiple births in our hospital & compare with other studies. Methods: A retrospective study done by collecting the data from parturition register from Jan 2008 to Dec 2011 (4 yrs) from Cheluvamba Hospital attached to Mysore Medical College and Research Institute. Total number of the live births, still births, and abortions> 20 wks were collected. Details of multiple births such as maternal age, gestational age, sex & birth weight of the babies, U/S reports and congenital anomalies (CA) were noted. Results: The total number of singleton births were 48700 and number of babies who had congenital malformations were 235 (48. 25 / 10, 000 births). Total number of multiple births were 579 including 10 triplets and number of babies who had CA were 11 (189. 98 / 10, 000 births, P< 0. 0001). In the present study sex of the babies were noted in all multiple births and zygosity could not be recorded. Among 579 multiple births 404 were of the Same Sex (SS) and 165 were of Opposite Sex (OS) in twins and 6 were {{of the same sex}} and 4 were of opposite sex in triplets. According to Weinberg formula 50 % of same sex (SS) twins are monozygotic and 50 % are dizygotic twins. Among the 11 babies with CA, 4 monozygotic twins had anomalies related to twinning such as <b>Acardia</b> with TRAP sequence (3 twins), and Thoracophagus (1 twin). 5 babies had CNS anomalies, 1 with cystic hygroma, 1 baby with multiple system affected. Conclusion: The incidence of birth defects is more in multiple births and especially in monozygotic twins. In the present days increase in twinning rate due to advanced maternal age, hereditary factors and use of ovulation inducing drugs, which results in premature and low birth wt babies associated with poor lung maturity.
