40|$|For the {{purposes}} of this article, I shall assume that the sole aim of any system of accident law is the minimization of the sum of (a) accident costs and (b) the cost of avoiding accident costs. I include in the latter the 2 ̆ 2 cost 2 ̆ 2 in pleasure forgone of undertaking a relatively less desirable but less <b>accident-prone</b> <b>activity,</b> or—what is really the same thing—the cost of engaging in an activity in a safer but more expensive or less pleasurable way. I make this assumption for analytical purposes only. I do not for a moment believe this to be the only aim of accident law. The aim that a system of accident law be 2 ̆ 2 just 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 fair 2 ̆ 2 could only through a rather unhappy twisting of words—and valuation of things which cannot be valued—be made to come within my 2 ̆ 2 cost 2 ̆ 2 formulation. Yet fairness is ultimately a goal which any system of accident law must meet. Everything cannot be discussed at once, however, and, although I believe that the fault system can be shown to be quite 2 ̆ 2 unfair 2 ̆ 2 both relatively and absolutely, I will leave that demonstration to another piece...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Workloads on {{caregivers}} {{in nursing}} home are increasing as the imbalance {{between the number}} of elderly people and that of caregivers becomes larger. Excessive workloads on caregivers must be reduced not only because they become burdens for caregivers but also because they deteriorate the quality of nursing care. One of such workloads is routine patrol for monitoring the status of the elderly and for detecting accidents on the elderly as soon as possible. If the number of unnecessary patrols is minimized, caregivers will be able to spend their time on high touch care and humane communication. The authors have been developing an ultrasonic 3 D tag system which locate ultrasonic tags in real time, and employed the system in a nursing home to monitor positions of the elderly people. If the system locates the elderly people continuously and robustly, and if it can notify caregivers about the occurrence of <b>accident-prone</b> <b>activities</b> promptly, caregivers will be releaved from their unnecessary workloads. This paper describes the research background, system overview, system implementations, and experimental results. ...|$|R
