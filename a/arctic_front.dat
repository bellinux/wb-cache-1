25|$|Climate, {{especially}} temperature, {{is obviously}} a factor in determining distributions of northern flora. Halliday and Brown (1943) suggested that white spruce’s northern limit corresponds “very closely” with the July mean monthly isotherm of 10°C in Ungava, but that the northern limit west of Hudson Bay was south of that isotherm. Other climatic factors that have been suggested as affecting the northern limit of white spruce include: cumulative summer degree days, position of the <b>Arctic</b> <b>front</b> in July, mean net radiation especially during the growing season, and low light intensities (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990). Topography, soil conditions, and glaciation may also be important in controlling northern limits of spruce (Drew and Shanks 1965).|$|E

500|$|In {{the case}} of Hurricane Sandy, two major factors {{contributing}} to the size and strength of the storm were unusually warm ocean surface temperatures {{and an increase in}} blocking patterns, both of which are expected to occur more frequently due to global warming. As they drift north, Atlantic hurricanes are typically moved to the east and out to sea by the jet stream's prevailing winds. This typical pattern was blocked by a ridge of high pressure over Greenland, resulting in a negative Arctic oscillation, forming a kink in the jet stream and causing it to double back on itself off the East Coast; Sandy was caught up in this northwesterly flow. The blocking pattern over Greenland also stalled an <b>arctic</b> <b>front,</b> which combined with the cyclone. Mark Fischetti of Scientific American argued that the jet stream's unusual shape was caused by the melting of Arctic ice. Noting that these blocking patterns are unusual in the fall but have been increasing, meteorologist Jeff Masters said that three studies in 2011 found [...] "that the recent record decline in Arctic sea ice could be responsible, since this heats up the pole, altering the Equator-to-pole temperature difference, forcing the jet stream to slow down, meander, and get stuck in large loops." [...] Trenberth said that while a negative Arctic Oscillation and a blocking anticyclone were in place, the null hypothesis remained that this was just the natural variability of weather.|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} baroclinicity on frontal interleaving, we contrast the interleaving characteristics of two fronts, one in the Arctic Ocean and the other surrounding a Mediterranean salt lens (Meddy). The Meddy is broken into two parts based on the vertical temperature and salinity structure, so our comparison involves three sets of interleaving observations. The cross-front slopes of intrusions relative to horizontal and isopycnal surfaces are taken to be key diagnostics of the interleaving dynamics. Assuming the observed slopes match those that were present during the initial growth of interleaving, we use an instability theory to infer the dominant form of double diffusion that was active during the growth stage. Then, to {{investigate the}} observed interleaving, we use a steady-state model to infer the dominant form of double diffusion {{at the time of}} observation. In the <b>Arctic</b> Ocean <b>front,</b> it appears that different forms of double diffusion dominated the two stages of interleaving (salt fingering during the growth stage and diffusive convection at steady state).
