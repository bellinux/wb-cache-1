5|$|According to Herodotus, an Athenian runner named Pheidippides {{was sent}} to run from Athens to Sparta to ask for {{assistance}} before the battle. He ran a distance of over 225 kilometers (140 miles), arriving in Sparta {{the day after he}} left. Then, following the battle, the Athenian army marched the 40 kilometers (25 miles) or so back to Athens at a very high pace (considering the quantity of armour, and the fatigue after the battle), in order to head off the Persian force sailing around Cape Sounion. They arrived back in the late <b>afternoon,</b> <b>in</b> time to see the Persian ships turn away from Athens, thus completing the Athenian victory.|$|E

On one page the first two lines of 'Trees' appear, with the date, February 2, 1913, and on another page, further on in the book, is the full text of the poem. It was dedicated to his wife's mother, Mrs. Henry Mills Alden, who was endeared to all her family.|$|E

5|$|Primarily a nocturnal grazer, the bohor reedbuck {{may also}} feed at daytime. A {{study showed that}} feeding peaked at dawn and late <b>afternoon.</b> <b>In</b> the night, two feeding peaks were {{observed}} once again: at dusk and midnight.

Seasonal differences in {{the amount of time spent}} while grazing in a particular area is possibly related to the availability and quality of grasses there. The bohor reedbuck often grazes in association with other grazers such as hartebeest, topi, puku and kob. In Kenyan farmlands, the reedbuck may feed on growing wheat and cereals.|$|E

The famous exterior of the structure was buttressed and retained while the extensive renovations proceeded inside. The work lasted from December 1949 until March 1952.|$|E
5|$|The word afternoon, which {{derives from}} after and noon, has been attested from {{about the year}} 1300; Middle English {{contained}} both afternoon and the synonym aftermete. The standard locative marking for the word was at <b>afternoon</b> <b>in</b> the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries but has shifted to in the afternoon since then. In Southern U.S. and Midland American English, the word evening is sometimes used to encompass all times between noon and night. The Irish language contains four different words to mark time intervals from late afternoon to nightfall, this period being considered mystical. Metaphorically, the word afternoon refers to a relatively late period in the expanse of time or in one's life.|$|E
5|$|Time is also {{connected}} {{to the theme of}} light and dark. In Shakespeare's day, plays were most often performed at noon or in the <b>afternoon</b> <b>in</b> broad daylight. This forced the playwright to use words to create the illusion of day and night in his plays. Shakespeare uses references to the night and day, the stars, the moon, and the sun to create this illusion. He also has characters frequently refer to days of the week and specific hours to help the audience understand that time has passed in the story. All in all, no fewer than 103 references to time are found in the play, adding to the illusion of its passage.|$|E

5|$|Antonio Ezequiel {{was killed}} by the Mexican Navy at around 6:00p.m. in {{downtown}} Matamoros on 5 November 2010, but the roadblocks set by organized crime continued {{throughout the rest of}} the day. The drug lord had reportedly called for backup when he was surrounded by the Navy, but when he was killed, his reinforcements from Reynosa, Tamaulipas (which consisted of over 80 SUVs filled with gunmen) dispersed. The international bridges in Matamoros were reopened by 7:00p.m. after crowds of people had waited all <b>afternoon.</b> <b>In</b> Reynosa at around 9:15p.m., a grenade exploded inside a vehicle parked outside Plaza Real, the busiest shopping center in the city and just four miles away from the Hidalgo–Reynosa International Bridge. Reynosa also reported several shootings between the Mexican Army and organized crime on the highway that connects the city with the border town of Matamoros. In the municipalities of San Fernando, Río Bravo, Jaumave, Díaz Ordaz, Nuevo Laredo, Ciudad Mier, Guerrero, Miguel Alemán, Valle Hermoso, and Ciudad Victoria, most of the daily city activities were cancelled throughout the whole day. Organized crime gunmen and risk situations were reported in these areas, too.|$|E
5|$|Darabont looked {{initially}} {{at some of}} {{his favorite}} actors like Gene Hackman and Robert Duvall {{for the role of}} Andy Dufresne, but they were unavailable; Clint Eastwood and Paul Newman were also considered. Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks, and Kevin Costner were offered, and passed on the role —Hanks due to his starring role in Forrest Gump, and Costner because he had the lead in Waterworld. Johnny Depp, Nicolas Cage, and Charlie Sheen were also considered for the role at different stages. Cruise attended table readings of the script, but refused to work for the inexperienced Darabont. Darabont said he cast Robbins after seeing his performance in the 1990 psychological horror Jacob's Ladder. When Robbins was cast he insisted that Darabont use experienced cinematographer Roger Deakins, who had worked with him on The Hudsucker Proxy. To prepare for the role, Robbins observed caged animals at a zoo, spent an <b>afternoon</b> <b>in</b> solitary confinement, spoke with prisoners and guards, and had his arms and legs shackled for a few hours.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, Ray {{directed}} Kanchenjungha. Based on {{his first}} original screenplay, {{it was his first}} film in colour. The film tells of an upper-class family spending an <b>afternoon</b> <b>in</b> Darjeeling, a picturesque hill town in West Bengal. They try to arrange the engagement of their youngest daughter to a highly paid engineer educated in London. He had first conceived shooting the film in a large mansion, but later decided to film it in the famous hill town. He used the many shades of light and mist to reflect the tension in the drama. Ray noted that while his script allowed shooting to be possible under any lighting conditions, a commercial film contingent present {{at the same time in}} Darjeeling failed to shoot a single scene, as they only wanted to do so in sunshine.|$|E

5|$|Near {{midnight on}} 20 May, Eichmann was sedated by an Israeli doctor on the Mossad team and {{dressed as a}} flight attendant. He was smuggled out of Argentina aboard the same El Al Bristol Britannia {{aircraft}} that had {{a few days earlier}} carried Israel's delegation to the official 150th anniversary celebration of Argentina's independence from Spain. After a tense delay at the airport getting the flight plan approved, the plane took off for Israel, stopping over in Dakar, Senegal, to refuel. They arrived in Israel on 22 May, and Ben-Gurion announced Eichmann's capture to the Knesset—Israel's parliament—the following <b>afternoon.</b> <b>In</b> Argentina, the abduction was met with a violent wave of antisemitism carried out by far-right elements, including the Tacuara Nationalist Movement.|$|E
5|$|Norman Stewart Mitchell-Innes {{was born}} in Calcutta on 7 September 1914, where {{his father was a}} {{businessman}} of Scottish descent. Both his father, also named Norman, and his grandfather, Gilbert, were keen golfers. The former was the All India Amateur Golf Champion in 1893 and 1894, while the latter captained Prestwick Golf Club. He moved to England with his family at the age of five to live in Minehead, Somerset, and gained a scholarship to Sedbergh School based in Cumbria. At Sedbergh he developed quickly as a cricketer, first playing for the school's first team aged 15. The subsequent year, he scored 302 not out in a house match in one <b>afternoon.</b> <b>In</b> the summer of 1931, after scoring two half-centuries for Sedbergh against Durham School and Stonyhurst College, Mitchell-Innes was called up to play for Somerset County Cricket Club in a County Championship match against Warwickshire. He had to travel down from Scotland by overnight train for the fixture at the County Ground, Taunton. He took two wickets, and scored 23 runs in the match, which was drawn.|$|E

Race details for the São Paulo Indy 300 were announced on 25 January 2010. It was the first American open-wheel race in the country since the Rio 200 at Jacarepaguá in 2000. Despite a lengthy distance to travel from most team bases, the event promoters offered each team a six-figure sum of money, as well as paying for all expenses. A total of seven Brazilian drivers would compete in the race, including Ana Beatriz, Hélio Castroneves, Tony Kanaan, Raphael Matos, Vitor Meira, Mario Moraes and Mario Romancini. Of those seven, four drivers—Beatriz, Castroneves, Moraes and Romancini—are natives of São Paulo. The race weekend was scheduled to have two practice sessions on Saturday morning, qualifications on Saturday afternoon with the race on Sunday <b>afternoon.</b> <b>In</b> preparation for the race weekend, the public roads that made up areas of the track were closed off just before midnight on Friday evening.|$|E
