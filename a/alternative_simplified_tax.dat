5000|$|The Taxpayer Choice Act (/) was a {{proposed}} {{bill in the}} United States Congress which, if enacted, would have amended the Internal Revenue Code to eliminate {{the alternative minimum tax}} on individual taxpayers. The bill was reproposed in 2009. The bill was not voted upon in either session. The legislation would create an <b>alternative,</b> <b>simplified</b> <b>tax</b> that individuals may choose over the current personal income tax. The new system would have two tax rates (up to $100K at 10% and 25% for everything above), a large standard deduction with no special deductions, and is argued to greatly reduce the damage and complexity caused by the current income tax. [...] The bill would also make permanent the capital gains and dividends rate reductions enacted by the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act. In the House, the bill was introduced by Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), ranking member on the House Budget Committee, and had 83 cosponsors in 2007 and 22 fellow Republicans in 2009. [...] The bill was introduced in the Senate by Jim Demint. The plan has been supported by FreedomWorks, former House Majority Leader Dick Armey, and former 2008 presidential candidate Fred Thompson.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{suggests}} a consumption-based direct tax, referred to {{here as a}} <b>simplified</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>tax</b> or SAT, {{as an alternative to}} the standard income tax for reforming socialist economies (RSEs). The paper consists of seven sections. Section I serves as an introduction. Section II outlines some of the objectives of tax policy in RSEs and some of the constraints on the achievement of those objectives. Section III provides examples of the overwhelming complexity of the income tax. Section IV explains the basic mechanics of the SAT and contrasts the simplicity of the SAT with the complexity of the income tax. Section V describes the economic advantages of the SAT and section VI discusses some potential problems of the SAT. The final section concludes by stating that the SAT encourages saving and investment in a way that is economically neutral and avoids many of the administrative problems of an income tax.

40|$|Final {{published}} versionThis paper {{examines the}} role of tax simplification {{in the operation of}} a tax system as a whole and then uses that framework to analyse initiatives in Australia, NZ and the UK. We begin with the subject of simplification itself and what it can mean, and follow this with a discussion concerning how to <b>simplify</b> <b>tax</b> systems. The paper then focusses on three key steps with <b>simplifying</b> <b>tax</b> systems, namely: <b>simplifying</b> <b>tax</b> law, <b>simplifying</b> taxpayer communications and <b>simplifying</b> <b>tax</b> administration. The paper then examines several long term approaches to simplification, such as the Office for Tax Simplification in the UK and the TWG in NZ. The paper observes the contrasting approach of Australia, such as pre-filling tax returns, which has not simplifed its tax system. Prior to the concluding observations, the paper suggests that the establishment of some form of independent authority may enable effective simplification of the tax systems in the three jurisdictions reviewed...|$|R
