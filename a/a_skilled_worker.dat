5|$|Following the bird's extinction, {{remains of}} the great auk {{increased}} dramatically in value, and auctions of specimens created intense interest in Victorian Britain, where 15 specimens are now located, {{the largest number of}} any country. A specimen was bought in 1971 by the Icelandic Museum of National History for £9000, which placed it in the Guinness Book of Records as the most expensive stuffed bird ever sold. The price of its eggs sometimes reached up to 11 times the amount earned by <b>a</b> <b>skilled</b> <b>worker</b> in a year. The present whereabouts of six of the eggs are unknown. Several other eggs have been destroyed accidentally. Two mounted skins were destroyed in the twentieth century, one in the Mainz Museum during the Second World War, and one in the Museu Bocage, Lisbon that was destroyed by a fire in 1978.|$|E
25|$|Barden's {{friend and}} his {{colleague}} in tournaments across Europe, Bert Harris, was the first English sprint champion. In one meeting in Australia he won £800 at a time <b>a</b> <b>skilled</b> <b>worker</b> in England earned £85 a year. Three years after his national championship, and with his career starting to fade, he rode at a meeting on the track at Aston, Birmingham on Easter Monday, 1897. He crashed in the 10-mile race, hit {{his head on the}} cement track and died on 21 April after not regaining consciousness.|$|E
25|$|It is {{difficult}} to estimate comparative exchange rates with modern currency because the range of products produced by economies of centuries gone by were different from today, which makes purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations very difficult; however, some historians and economists have estimated that in the 5th century BC a drachma had a rough value of 25 U.S. dollars (in the year 1990 – equivalent to 46.50 USD in 2015), whereas classical historians regularly {{say that in the}} heyday of ancient Greece (the fifth and fourth centuries) the daily wage for <b>a</b> <b>skilled</b> <b>worker</b> or a hoplite was one drachma, and for a heliast (juror) half a drachma since 425BC.|$|E
25|$|A modern {{person might}} think of one drachma as the rough {{equivalent}} of <b>a</b> <b>skilled</b> <b>worker's</b> daily pay {{in the place where}} they live, which could be as low as $1 USD, or as high as $100 USD, depending on the country.|$|R
30|$|The {{revenue of}} the job {{increases}} with worker skills. For the employer, <b>a</b> more <b>skilled</b> <b>worker</b> is more valuable than <b>a</b> less <b>skilled</b> <b>worker</b> who needs additional job training. The amount of training costs required for the job and, in turn, the employer’s revenue, decreases with worker skills (Helsley and Strange 1990). For simplicity, we further assume that workers and employers face the same location costs.|$|R
30|$|In consequence, we {{confirm the}} {{relationships}} among the variables as formulated in our four hypotheses: First, the lower a firm’s overage costs, the higher is c.p. its investment in <b>an</b> inventory of <b>skilled</b> <b>workers,</b> i.e., the more apprentices it trains. Second, the lower a firm’s underage costs, the lower is c.p. its investment in <b>an</b> inventory of <b>skilled</b> <b>workers,</b> i.e., the less apprentices it trains. Third, given an identical cost structure, the higher a firm’s expected future demand for <b>skilled</b> <b>workers,</b> the higher is its investment in <b>an</b> inventory of <b>skilled</b> <b>workers,</b> i.e., the more apprentices it trains. And fourth, the relation between a high expected demand and the investment in <b>an</b> inventory of <b>skilled</b> <b>workers</b> is even larger for a high critical ratio, i.e., for high underage costs compared to overage costs.|$|R
25|$|In 1807, <b>a</b> <b>skilled</b> <b>worker,</b> {{such as a}} jeweler, perfumer, tailor or {{furniture}} maker, {{could earn}} 4-6 francs a day; a baker earned 8-12 francs a week; a stonemason earned 2-4 francs a day; an unskilled worker, such as construction laborer, earned 1.50 to 2.5 francs a day. Much of the work was seasonal; most construction work stopped during the winter. Women's salaries were lower; a worker in a tobacco factory earned one franc a day, while women making embroidery or seamstresses earned 50-60 centimes a day, government salaries in 1800 were fixed {{on a scale of}} 8000 francs a year for a chief of a division of a Ministry down to 2500 francs a year for a messenger.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, workers started {{organizing}} {{to improve}} labor conditions. This proved difficult. Charles Piaget, {{the son of}} a clockwork artisan, who began working at the factory in 1946 as <b>a</b> <b>skilled</b> <b>worker,</b> became a representative of the Confédération Française des Travailleurs Chrétiens (CFTC, French Confederation of Christian Workers) trade union. He later recalled that during national strikes, only 30 or 40 workers at LIP {{out of a total of}} 1200 would go on strike. Those who did strike were listed by the management and called in to explain themselves. Semi-skilled workers on the assembly line were not allowed to talk or move more than 25 centimeters (less than ten inches) during their shifts.|$|E
25|$|The {{influence}} of social class on educational achievement {{is much greater}} in western Germany {{than it is in}} eastern Germany (former GDR). An analysis of PISA data on Gymnasium pupils for the year 2000 showed that, while in western Germany the child of an academic was 7.26 times as likely as that of <b>a</b> <b>skilled</b> <b>worker</b> to attend, in eastern Germany a child from an academic family was only 2.78 times as likely as a working class child to attend. The reasons for this were unclear. Some people believed that immigrants were responsible, because more uneducated immigrant families lived in western than in eastern Germany. This assumption however could not be confirmed. The difference between east and west was even stronger when only ethnic German children were studied.|$|E

500|$|Much of the {{expenditure}} {{was on the}} construction teams, called [...] "crews", who built the forts. The numbers of workers varied {{during the course of}} the project, driven in part by seasonal variation, but the teams were substantial: Sandgate Castle, for example, saw an average of 640 men on the site daily during June 1540, and the work at Hull required a team of 420. <b>A</b> <b>skilled</b> <b>worker</b> was paid between 7 and 8 pence a day, a labourer between 5 and 6 pence, with trades including stonemasons, carpenters, carters, lime burners, sawyers, plumbers, scavelmen, dikers and bricklayers. Finding enough workers proved difficult, and in some cases men had to be pressed into service unwillingly. Labour disputes broke out, with strikes over low pay at Deal in 1539 and at Guisnes in 1541; both were quickly suppressed by royal officials.|$|E

50|$|Generally, however, {{individual}} <b>skilled</b> <b>workers</b> {{are more}} valued {{to a given}} company than individual non-skilled <b>workers,</b> as <b>skilled</b> <b>workers</b> {{tend to be more}} difficult to replace. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, <b>skilled</b> <b>workers</b> tend to demand more in the way of financial compensation because of their efforts. According to Greenspan, corporate managers are willing to bid up pay packages to acquire <b>skilled</b> <b>workers</b> as they identify the lack of skilled labor as one of today's greatest problems.|$|R
2500|$|H.B. Higgins {{declared}} that [...] "fair and reasonable" [...] wages for an unskilled male worker required {{a living wage}} that was sufficient for [...] "a human being in a civilised community" [...] to support a {{wife and three children}} in [...] "frugal comfort", while <b>a</b> <b>skilled</b> <b>worker</b> should receive an additional margin for their skills, regardless of the employer's capacity to pay.|$|E
2500|$|Mancus (sometimes spelt mancosus or similar) was a {{term used}} in early medieval Europe to denote either a gold coin, a weight of gold of 4.25g (equivalent to the Islamic dinar, and thus {{lighter than the}} Byzantine solidus), or a unit of account of thirty silver pence. This made it worth about a month's wages for <b>a</b> <b>skilled</b> <b>worker,</b> such as a {{craftsman}} or a soldier. Distinguishing between these uses can be extremely difficult: [...] of the Anglo-Saxon king Eadred, who died in 955, illustrates the problem well with its request that [...] "two thousand mancuses of gold be taken and minted into mancuses" [...] (nime man twentig hund mancusa goldes and gemynetige to mancusan).|$|E
2500|$|Even for {{the richest}} Athenians, the liturgy {{represented}} a significant expense. Assuming a yield of 8% from [...] {{the land they}} held, the poorest liturgists, who had a net worth of ten talents (as Demosthenes did in 360 /59), were forced to devote {{the greater part of}} a year's revenue to the trierarchy. [...] Therefore, they were often forced to borrow, [...] to pay for liturgies. In a speech of Lysias, a litigant says, [...] "my father in the whole course of his life, has spent more on the city than for himself and his family - twice what we have now". By comparison, the liturgy that was the least expensive, the choregia of the Panathenaia, represents almost a year's salary of <b>a</b> <b>skilled</b> <b>worker</b> in the 5th century B.C. The most expensive cost more than three times [...] the income of the hoplite class, that is to say the wealth threshold at which one was required to serve as an Athenian soldier.|$|E

30|$|Given an {{identical}} cost structure, {{the higher the}} probability that a firm has a high expected demand for <b>skilled</b> <b>workers,</b> the higher is its investment in <b>an</b> inventory of <b>skilled</b> <b>workers,</b> i.e., the more apprentices it trains.|$|R
2500|$|Hephaestion {{was given}} a {{magnificent}} funeral. Its cost is variously given in the sources as 10,000 talents or 12,000 talents. It is difficult to give a modern equivalent for such a huge amount {{but we know that}} in Hephaestion’s time, the daily wage of <b>a</b> <b>skilled</b> <b>worker</b> was two or three drachmas. In western Europe, 2008, that would be between £50 and £100, so the lowest possible value for 1 drachma in modern terms is £25. We know there were 6,000 drachmas in a talent, so even at the most conservative estimate, Hephaestion’s funeral would have cost £1,500,000,000. Alexander himself drove the funeral carriage part of the way back to Babylon with some of the driving entrusted to Hephaestion's friend Perdiccas. At Babylon funeral games were held in Hephaestion's honour. The contests ranged from literature to athletics and 3,000 competitors took part, the festival eclipsing anything that had gone before both in cost and in numbers taking part. Plutarch says that Alexander planned to spend ten thousand talents on the funeral and the tomb. He employed Stasicrates, [...] "...as this artist was famous for his innovations, which combined an exceptional degree of magnificence, audacity and ostentation...", to design the pyre for Hephaestion.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>skilled</b> <b>worker</b> is any {{worker who}} has special skill, training, knowledge, and (usually acquired) ability in their work. <b>A</b> <b>skilled</b> <b>worker</b> may have {{attended}} a college, university or technical school. Or, <b>a</b> <b>skilled</b> <b>worker</b> may have learned their skills on the job. Examples of skilled labor include software development, paramedics, police officers, soldiers, physicians, crane operators, drafters, painters, plumbers, craftsmen, cooks and accountants. These workers {{can be either}} blue-collar or white-collar workers, with varied levels of training or education.|$|E

50|$|The applicant's action space {{consists}} of two actions: either obtain a university education or abstain from university. Obtaining an education is less costly for <b>a</b> <b>skilled</b> <b>worker</b> than for an unskilled worker, as <b>a</b> <b>skilled</b> <b>worker</b> may receive scholarships, find classes less taxing, and so on. University education therefore serves as a signal, a means with which the applicant may communicate to the employer {{that he or she}} is, in fact, skilled. Thus, it may be rational for an employer to prefer to employ university graduates, even if their studies are not related at all to the work they will do at the company.|$|E
