500|$|Tyler's {{presidency}} {{has provoked}} highly divided responses among political commentators. It is generally held in low esteem by historians; Edward P. Crapol began his biography John Tyler, the Accidental President (2006) by noting: [...] "Other biographers and historians {{have argued that}} John Tyler was a hapless and inept chief executive whose presidency was seriously flawed." [...] In The Republican Vision of John Tyler (2003), Dan Monroe observed that the Tyler presidency [...] "is generally ranked {{as one of the}} least successful". Seager wrote that Tyler [...] "was neither <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>president</b> nor a great intellectual," [...] adding that despite a few achievements, [...] "his administration has been and must be counted an unsuccessful one by any modern measure of accomplishment". A survey of historians conducted by C-SPAN in 2017 ranked Tyler as 39th of 43 men to hold the office.|$|E
500|$|The {{motorcade}} {{arrived at}} the Cathedral and Reagan's casket was removed. The bearers carrying it paused on the Cathedral steps, and an opening prayer was given by Bishop John Bryson Chane, Dean of the Washington National Cathedral. The casket was then carried down the aisle; the Reagan family followed and Nancy Reagan was escorted to her seat by President Bush. Rabbi Harold Kushner and Supreme Court Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor (the first female Supreme Court justice, whom Reagan appointed), then each gave a reading, which preceded the eulogies. The choir then sang hymns—"Faire is the Heaven"; [...] "Bring Us, O Lord"; [...] "And I saw a New Heaven"—before Thatcher delivered the first eulogy. In view of her failing mental faculties following several small strokes, the message had been pre-recorded several months earlier and was broadcast throughout the Cathedral on plasma television screens. During the speech, Thatcher said, [...] "We have lost <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>president,</b> a great American and a great man, and I have lost a dear friend." ...|$|E

In 1948, Wood asked to be released as temple president due to ill health. Shortly thereafter, he was ordained the patriarch of the Alberta Stake, a position he held until his death at age 89.

500|$|On October 7, Trump {{announced}} on Larry King Live that he formed an exploratory committee {{to explore a}} Reform Party presidential bid. Trump planned to use the committee, not to raise money—he would personally fund his campaign—but to advise him on political matters {{in preparation for a}} run. In the interview with Larry King, Trump was optimistic about his chances indicating a [...] "very strong possibility" [...] of victory. He referenced a non-scientific National Enquirer poll of 100 individuals, showing him in first place against his Democratic and Republican counterparts. [...] When pressed, Trump identified Oprah Winfrey as his ideal choice for a running mate, describing her as [...] "somebody that is very special," [...] and that if she agreed to run, [...] "she'd be fantastic [...] [...] [...] she's popular, she's brilliant, she's a wonderful woman." [...] Oprah's spokesperson later responded [...] "at this point in time [...] [...] [...] Oprah is not running." [...] Trump labeled Rudy Giuliani the greatest Mayor of New York and spoke admirably of Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan, saying that Reagan had a demeanor that contributed to a phenomenal spirit in the nation. [...] Trump argued that President Bill Clinton could have been <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>president,</b> but destroyed his legacy with the Lewinsky scandal. [...] As for the Reform Party, Trump offered praise for both Perot and Ventura, and attacked potential primary opponent Buchanan as someone [...] "enamored" [...] with Adolf Hitler, based on Buchanan's thesis that Hitler presented no military threat to the United States ahead of World War II.|$|E
500|$|On October 3, 1969, the House Banking Committee passed {{legislation}} for a silverless Eisenhower dollar, with Patman stating {{that he hoped}} to have it approved by the full House {{in time for the}} late president's birthday on October 14. On October 6, the bill's sponsors lost a procedural vote which would have allowed for no amendments. While some representatives spoke against {{the manner in which the}} legislation was to be considered, Iowa Congressman H. R. Gross objected to the base-metal composition of the proposed coin: [...] "You would be doing the memory of President Eisenhower no favor to mint a dollar made perhaps of scrap metal." [...] Both houses voted on October 14, Eisenhower's birthday. Although the House passed the administration-backed bill for a base metal dollar, the Senate passed the bill as amended by Colorado Senator Peter Dominick, calling for the piece to be minted in 40% silver. Instrumental in the passage of the Senate amendment was a letter from Mamie Eisenhower, recalling that her husband had liked to give silver dollars as mementoes, and had gone to some effort to obtain coins struck in the year of his birth, 1890. Idaho Senator James McClure stated, [...] "It is somehow beneath the dignity of <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>president</b> like General Eisenhower to withhold silver from the coin." [...] On October 29, 1969, Texas Representative Robert R. Casey introduced legislation to honor both Eisenhower and the recent Apollo 11 Moon landing. These provisions would become part of the enacted bill authorizing the Eisenhower dollar. Casey originally wanted the mission theme of Apollo 11, [...] "We came in peace for all mankind", to appear on the coin; when the Mint informed him that there was not room for that inscription, he settled for requiring that the reverse design be emblematic of that theme.|$|E

His endorsement of Mondale was lukewarm (telling reporters that [...] "if you go around saying that Mondale would be <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>president,</b> you would be a liar and a hypocrite"), but he supported Jackson enthusiastically.

60|$|That {{afternoon}} Cynthia and {{her father}} walked through the green park to make their {{first visit to the}} State House.

Wetherell seemed to feel again the thrill he felt when he saw the blue-clad men of this state crowded in the train at Boston: and to hear again the cheers, and the sobs, and the prayers as he looked upon the blood that stained stars and stripes alike with a holy stain. With that blood the country had been consecrated, and the state--yes, and the building where they stood. So they went on up the stairs, reverently, nor heeded the noise of those in groups about them, and through a door into the great hall of the representatives of the state.|$|E
