50|$|The Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS) is a military, <b>all-weather</b> <b>landing</b> {{system based}} on {{real-time}} differential correction of the Global Positioning System (GPS) signal, augmented with a local area correction message, and transmitted to the user via secure means. The onboard receiver compares the current GPS-derived position with the local correction signal, deriving a highly accurate three-dimensional position capable of being used for all-weather approaches via an Instrument Landing System-style display.

5000|$|Aviation in the Kirksville area began {{within a}} few years of the Wright {{brothers}} historic flight. Local resident Nick Sparling is credited as being Adair County's first aviator, in 1909. In 1924, Roy B. [...] "Cap" [...] Dodson started the first airport in the area, located on the north edge of Kirksville. However, an airfield at the present location of Kirksville Regional Airport wasn't created until 1930 when the Federal Aviation Administration built a series of emergency landing strips across the nation. With America's entry into World War II, the Kirksville Municipal Airport, as it had been declared in the late 1930s, received a major upgrade from the Civilian Pilots Training Program and the US Army Air Corps War Training Service. In 1942 a paved <b>all-weather</b> <b>landing</b> strip, hangars, a control tower and small restaurant were built; the paved runway was 3870 ft until 1968.|$|R

50|$|Most {{currently}} operational {{vectored thrust}} aircraft use turbofans with rotating nozzles or vanes to deflect the exhaust stream. This method can successfully deflect thrust through {{as much as}} 90 degrees, relative to the aircraft centerline. However, the engine must be sized for vertical lift, rather than normal flight, which results in a weight penalty. Afterburning (or Plenum Chamber Burning, PCB, in the bypass stream) is difficult to incorporate and is impractical for take-off and <b>landing</b> <b>thrust</b> vectoring, because the very hot exhaust can damage runway surfaces. Without afterburning {{it is hard to}} reach supersonic flight speeds. A PCB engine, the Bristol Siddeley BS100, was cancelled in 1965.|$|R
40|$|To fully {{appreciate}} {{the development of the}} specific operational capabilities weather-modification could deliver to the war fighter, we must examine and understand their relationship to associated core competencies and the development of their requisite technologies. Figure 5 - 1 combines the specific operational capabilities of Table 1 into six core capabilities and depicts their relative importance over time. For example, fog and cloud modification are currently important and will remain so {{for some time to come}} to conceal our assets from surveillance or improve landing visibility at airfields. However, as surveillance assets become less optically dependent and aircraft achieve a truly global <b>all-weather</b> <b>landing</b> capability, fog and cloud modification applications become less important. In contrast, artificial weather technologies do not currently exist. But as they are developed, the importance of their potential applications rises rapidly. For example, the anticipated proliferation of surveillance technologies in the future will make the ability to deny surveillance increasingly valuable. In such an environment, clouds made of smart particles such as described in chapter 4 could provide a premium capability...|$|R

40|$|CNAS 1 (Collaborative Network for Atmospheric Sensing) is an agent-based, {{power-aware}} {{sensor network}} for ground-level atmospheric monitoring. In many multi-agent applications, reducing message transmission {{is a primary}} objective. In CNAS, however, it’s not the cost of sending messages, but when messages can be sent that is the driving communication constraint. CNAS agents must have their radios turned off most of the time, as even listening consumes significant power. Working in such collaborative isolation changes the character of agent interaction, as agents must have their radios turned on when others are sending messages to them. CNAS requires agent policies that can intelligently meet operational requirements while communicating only during intermittent, mutually established, communication windows. In this paper, we describe the CNAS agents and their hardware and blackboard-system software architectures. We also relate experiences and lessons learned from a field deployment of CNAS at the 2006 PATRIOT Exercise held last July at Fort McCoy, Wisconsin, and we discuss the upcoming CNAS deployment {{in conjunction with the}} Talisman Saber Combined Exercise to be conducted May–July 2007 in Australia. We conclude with an overview of current CNAS research that is exploring the addition of a rollable solar panel to each sensor agent that allows its battery reserves to grow (up to full capacity) when sunlight is available. Replenishable power reserves can support unlimited operational lifetimes, but activity decisions become more complex as each agent now must consider how much additional power may become available and when. 1.

5000|$|The Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS) is an <b>all-weather</b> {{aircraft}} <b>landing</b> {{system based}} on real-time differential correction of the GPS signal.

The FAA has stopped using the term LAAS and has transitioned to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) terminology of Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS).

60|$|Geographically and {{strategically}} considered, it is {{a curious}} place. It stands almost four-square, screened east and north by hills, {{and it may be}} said to face south upon the inner of two harbours by which it is normally approached. The entrance to the outer harbour, which is in reality a lagoon some three miles across, lies through a neck known as the Boca Chica--or Little Mouth--and defended by a fort. A long strip of densely wooded land to westward acts here as a natural breakwater, and as the inner harbour is approached, another strip of <b>land</b> <b>thrusts</b> across at right angles from the first, towards the mainland on the east. Just short of this it ceases, leaving a deep but very narrow channel, a veritable gateway, into the secure and sheltered inner harbour. Another fort defends this second passage. East and north of Cartagena lies the mainland, which may be left out of account. But to the west and northwest this city, so well guarded on every other side, lies directly open to the sea. It stands back beyond a half-mile of beach, and besides this and the stout Walls which fortify it, would appear to have no other defences. But those appearances are deceptive, and they had utterly deceived M. de Rivarol, when he devised his plan.|$|R
