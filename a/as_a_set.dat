5|$|A {{significant}} {{transition in}} her posthumous reputation occurred in 1833, when her novels were republished in Richard Bentley's Standard Novels series, illustrated by Ferdinand Pickering, and sold <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>set.</b> They gradually gained wider acclaim and popular readership. In 1869, fifty-two {{years after her}} death, her nephew's publication of A Memoir of Jane Austen introduced a compelling version of her writing career and supposedly uneventful life to an eager audience.|$|E
5|$|Both {{videos were}} shot <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> and cost £500,000 to make. The videos took {{four months of}} {{production}} before release.

5|$|French Sudan {{originally}} formed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> {{of military}} outposts {{as an extension}} of the French colony in Senegal. Though the area offered France little economic or strategic gain, the military effectively advocated greater conquest in the region. This was partly due to a fascination with the great empires, such as the Mali Empire and the Songhay Empire that rose to prominence in the area, and partly due to the promotional opportunities that military conquest offered for French military personnel.|$|E
5|$|Given a {{set with}} an {{addition}} operation, one cannot always define a corresponding subtraction operation on that set; {{the set of}} natural numbers is a simple example. On the other hand, a subtraction operation uniquely determines an addition operation, an additive inverse operation, and an additive identity; for this reason, an additive group can be described <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> that is closed under subtraction.|$|E
5|$|Graphs and {{directed}} graphs {{can be viewed}} as a special case of the far more general notion called relational structures (defined <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> with a tuple of relations on it). Directed graphs are structures with a single binary relation (adjacency) on the domain (the vertex set). Under this view, homomorphisms of such structures are exactly graph homomorphisms.|$|E

5|$|In 1756, French {{astronomer}} Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille {{introduced the}} constellation of Circinus with the French name le Compas, representing a pair of dividing compasses, on a chart of the southern sky. On that chart, Lacaille portrayed the constellations of Norma, Circinus, and Triangulum Australe, respectively, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> square and ruler, a compass, and a surveyor's level {{in a set of}} draughtsman's instruments. Circinus was given its current name in 1763, when Lacaille published an updated sky map with Latin names for the constellations he introduced.|$|E
5|$|In a {{broadcast}} system, the central high-powered broadcast tower transmits a high-frequency electromagnetic wave to numerous low-powered receivers. The high-frequency wave {{sent by the}} tower is modulated with a signal containing visual or audio information. The receiver is then tuned so as {{to pick up the}} high-frequency wave and a demodulator is used to retrieve the signal containing the visual or audio information. The broadcast signal can be either analog (signal is varied continuously with respect to the information) or digital (information is encoded <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> of discrete values).|$|E
5|$|In practice, the MSE is a {{blend of}} empathic {{descriptive}} phenomenology and empirical clinical observation. It has been argued that the term phenomenology has become corrupted in clinical psychiatry: current usage, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> of supposedly objective descriptions of a psychiatric patient (a synonym for signs and symptoms), is incompatible with the original meaning which was concerned with comprehending a patient's subjective experience.|$|E

Also depicting it as a surveyor's level, German Johann Bode gave it the alternate name of Libella in his Uranographia.|$|E
5|$|On December 13, the {{commission}} assembled {{to review the}} submitted designs, as well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> produced by Mint Chief Engraver Morgan at Baker's request, and a set, unrequested, from a Mr. Folio of New York City. It is not known how the designs were displayed for the Commission. After considerable discussion among Fraser, Moore, and Herbert Adams (a sculptor and {{former member of the}} Commission), a design by Anthony de Francisci was unanimously selected.|$|E
5|$|The Dry Salvages is {{the third}} poem of T. S. Eliot's Four Quartets and marks the {{beginning}} of when the series was consciously being formed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> of four poems. It was written and published in 1941 during the air-raids on Great Britain, an event that threatened him while giving lectures in the area. The title comes from the name of a rock formation near a town he spent time at as a child, which reflects Eliot's references to his own past throughout the poem.|$|E

5|$|The Maktab Khana ("Clerk's Quarters") {{originally}} {{known as}} Dawlat Khana-e-Jahangir, {{was constructed in}} 1617 {{under the supervision of}} Mamur Khan during the reign of Jahangir <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> of cloisters near the Moti Masjid. Designed by Khawaja Jahan Muhammad Dost, it was used as passage to the Audience Hall from the palace buildings to the north. Clerks in the Maktab Khana would also record the entry of guests into the fort. It features iwans in the Persian-Timurid style in each of its four sides. Each iwan is flanked by arches.|$|E
5|$|The biblical view of {{the late}} Iron Age {{political}} and cultural map describes it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> of branching genealogies. Biblical figures three generations forward from Terah are invariably described as the eponymous founders of different tribes and polities that interacted with the Kingdom of Judah between the 8th and 6th centuries BCE. Such {{is the case of}} the Qedarite Arabs, who according to biblical tradition, are the offspring of the Abraham-Ishmael-Kedar genealogical line.|$|E

5|$|Wang tiles are squares {{coloured}} on each edge, {{and placed}} so that abutting edges of adjacent tiles {{have the same}} colour; hence they are sometimes called Wang dominoes. A suitable set of Wang dominoes can tile the plane, but only aperiodically. This is known because any Turing machine can be represented <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> of Wang dominoes that tile the plane {{if and only if}} the Turing machine does not halt. Since the halting problem is undecidable, the problem of deciding whether a Wang domino set can tile the plane is also undecidable.|$|E
5|$|Because of this {{beginning}} of the incursion of Europeans into the area, {{the members of the}} Confederacy helped shape the development of North America throughout the 18th century, becoming a centre of trade and culture. Great Britain supported this strengthening of the tribes in the area <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> of allies against the French and the Iroqouis. The people of the Three Fires Confederacy, however, sided with the French during the Seven Years' War and only made peace with Great Britain after the Treaty of Fort Niagara in 1764. It also fought {{on the side of the}} British during the War of 1812. The Three Fires Confederacy also broke several treaties with the United States prior to 1815, but finally signed the Treaty of Springwells in September of that year and ceased all hostilities directed at the United States. The Grand Council survived intact until the middle to late 19th century, when more modern political systems began to evolve.|$|E
5|$|Closely related matrilines form loose aggregations called pods, usually {{consisting}} {{of one to}} four matrilines. Unlike matrilines, pods may separate for weeks or months at a time. DNA testing indicates resident males nearly always mate with females from other pods. Clans, {{the next level of}} resident social structure, are composed of pods with similar dialects, and common but older maternal heritage. Clan ranges overlap, mingling pods from different clans. The final association layer, perhaps more arbitrarily defined than the familial groupings, is called the community, and is defined <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> of clans that regularly commingle. Clans within a community do not share vocal patterns.|$|E
