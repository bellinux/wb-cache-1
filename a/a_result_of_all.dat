5|$|As <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> these processes, {{large numbers}} of memorials, more than for any other conflict, were built across the world during the inter-war period. It is {{estimated}} that France built around 176,000 war memorials, including around 36,000 in the local communes. Most of the local commune memorials were built by 1922, but those in the towns and cities typically required more protracted negotiations, and their construction stretched into the 1930s. The 1920s were particularly busy for construction of memorials in Britain, although the trend tailed off in 1930s, with the last inter-war memorial unveiled at the town of Mumbles in 1939. The commissioning of Australian war memorials similarly reduced after the mid-1920s. Over 3,500 Romanian memorials were erected. Many German memorials were built during the 1930s. Russia was unusual in building very few war memorials {{to the events of}} World War I, mainly {{as a result of the}} devastation of the Civil War and the political views of the subsequent Bolshevik government.|$|E

25|$|As <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the Tudor I's delays, BOAC – {{with the}} support of the Ministry of Civil Aviation – sought {{permission}} to purchase tried and tested aircraft such as the Lockheed Constellation and the Boeing Stratocruiser for its Atlantic routes instead of the Tudor. Despite BOAC's reluctance to purchase Tudors, the Ministry of Supply continued to subsidize the aircraft.|$|E
25|$|As <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> this, {{movable type}} was {{initially}} used by government offices which {{needed to produce}} large number of copies and by itinerant printers producing family registers who would carry perhaps 20,000 pieces of wooden type with them and cut any other characters needed locally. But small local printers often found that wooden blocks suited their needs better.|$|E
25|$|The Planxty sextet {{continued}} to tour, but began to drift apart. In 1980, O’Flynn recorded The Brendan Voyage with Shaun Davey. Moore and Lunny, eager {{to experiment with}} a rhythm section and a different, more political song set, formed Moving Hearts in 1981. Lunny also kept busy producing albums by other artists. As <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> these parallel projects, the original quartet would end up playing their last show together on 24 August 1982, at the National Stadium in Dublin.|$|E

25|$|Females tend to live {{five years}} longer; i.e. their funds need to {{last five years}} longer than men's funds. In addition, women face gender {{specific}} challenges resulting from how they are socialized. For example, they must follow rules of negotiating for a higher salary from a mutually-beneficial framework to avoid suffering from a negative employer backlash. As <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> of the above-mentioned inequities, women face a more complex money management situation than men in which they earn less but will be living longer and incurring higher expenses.|$|E
25|$|The energy {{needed to}} break a {{specific}} bond (generally covalent) between two atoms known as bond energy is <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the relative attractions and repulsions between the atoms of the molecule, however the most relevant are the bond's atoms and the immediate neighbors. As an approximation the most important parameters that influence the bonding between two atoms in a molecule are the mutual energy match and overlap of covalent orbitals and the repulsion between nonbonding orbitals. Likewise, radicals requiring more energy to form are less stable than those requiring less energy. An additional barrier can be the selection rule. Propagation, however, is very exothermic.|$|E
25|$|The feud {{between the}} ECW Originals and the New Breed continued, with the New Breed {{defeating}} the Originals in an Extreme Rules match {{on the next}} edition of ECW. Sabu {{was released from the}} company shortly after WrestleMania, and The Sandman was drafted to Raw a few months later in the 2007 WWE Draft. Kevin Thorn left the New Breed shortly after WrestleMania and Marcus Cor Von was also released shortly thereafter. By this point, Elijah Burke and Matt Striker had ceased associating with one another, with Striker eventually being relegated to a manager role for Big Daddy V. In addition, Rob Van Dam left the company when his contract expired shortly after One Night Stand. As <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> of this, the feud eventually puttered out and was rarely mentioned again.|$|E

25|$|Rowntree had {{struggled}} to make a milk chocolate product of comparable quality or value to Cadbury's Dairy Milk. Joseph Rowntree even described the growing market for milk chocolate as a fad. Rowntree's poor performance in the category became a major problem from 1914 onwards, as British public preference continued to move towards milk chocolate, {{and away from the}} more bitter cocoa essence products. Rowntree's two major rivals, Cadbury and Fry, merged in 1918, and although Rowntree was invited to partake in the merger, the company declined to do so. Meanwhile, the Rowntree board was torn as to whether it should become a low-turnover, high-quality product company or a mass producer of cheaper lines. Seebohm Rowntree inherited a struggling company when he succeeded his father as chairman in 1923. By 1930, as <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> its problems, Rowntree was approaching bankruptcy.|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of Stalin and {{appointment}} of Khrushchev, who had spent his early working years in Ukraine, as party secretary, the industrialisation of Dnipropetrovsk became even more profound, with the Southern (Yuzhne) Missile and Rocket factory being {{set up in the}} city. However, this was not the only development and many other factories, especially metallurgical and heavy-manufacturing plants, were set up in the city. At this point Dnipropetrovsk {{became one of the most}} important manufacturing cities in the Soviet Union, producing many goods from small articles like screws and vacuum cleaners to aircraft engine pieces and ballistic missiles. As <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> this industrialisation the city's inner suburbs became increasingly polluted and were gradually given over to large, unsightly industrial enterprises. At the same time the extensive development of the city's left bank and western suburbs as new residential areas began. The low-rise tenant houses of the Khrushchev era (Khrushchyovkas) gave way to the construction of high-rise prefabricated apartment blocks (similar to German Plattenbaus). In 1976 in line with the city's 1926 renaming a large monumental statue of Grigoriy Petrovsky was placed on the square in front of the city's station. This statue was destroyed by an angry mob early 2016.|$|E
500|$|During {{the course}} of these expeditions the {{geographical}} and magnetic poles were both reached. [...] The achievement of being first to the geographical South Pole was a primary object in some expeditions, and was the sole rationale for Roald Amundsen's venture. However, {{this was not the}} only aspect of polar exploration during this time; other expeditions worked with defined objectives in different areas of the continent. As <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> this activity, much of the continent's coastline was discovered and mapped, and significant areas of its interior were explored. The expeditions also generated large quantities of scientific data and specimens across a wide range of scientific disciplines, the examination and analysis of which would keep the world's scientific communities busy for decades.|$|E

500|$|As <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> {{of these}} design {{modifications}} from previous battleships, Nevada {{was the first}} of the US Navy's [...] "Standard" [...] type battleships. [...] "Standards" [...] were characterized by the use of oil fuel, the [...] "all or nothing" [...] armor scheme, and the arrangement of the main armament in four triple or twin turrets without any turrets located in the middle of the ship. The Navy was to create a fleet of modern battleships similar in long-range gunnery, speed, turning radius, and protection. Nevada was followed by 11 other battleships of this type, although significant improvements were made in subsequent designs as naval technology rapidly progressed. An additional seven standard type battleships ( [...] and the six of the [...] ) were never completed due to the Washington Naval Treaty.|$|E
500|$|Harrison and his adherents were unimpressed by McKinley's conduct, {{recalling that}} he had cut off talk of a {{candidacy}} in 1888, but had not done so in 1892.
