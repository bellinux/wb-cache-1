Mother will {{not have to worry about}} me making my grades, and Daddy will not have to put out more money on me, which would do no more good than it did in high school.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary with Hume, but {{critical}} of Hume's scepticism, a so-called Scottish school of Common Sense formed, whose basic principle was enunciated by its founder and greatest figure, Thomas Reid:If {{there are certain}} principles, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> there are, which the constitution of our nature leads us to believe, and which we are under a necessity {{to take for granted}} in the common concerns of life, without being able to give a reason for them — these are what we call the principles of common sense; and what is manifestly contrary to them, is what we call absurd.|$|E

5000|$|I {{would say}} {{there is a kind of}} mix. It goes through several worlds. It's most {{definitely}} a classic action-adventure but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it merges into the Edwardian children's story and there's a sort of Tim Burton-esque magic about it <b>as</b> well. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> there's a magic throughout the episode, but there is an underlying suspense and tension and darkness to it <b>as</b> well. So <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it merges those three things with an awful lot of Christmas about it.|$|R
500|$|Craig {{was again}} {{the centre of}} media speculation, with some media likening his arrival to Bradman's first tour of England in 1930. Bradman had scored a world Test series record of 974runs in 1930, a mark that remains unsurpassed. At a {{reception}} {{at the start of}} the tour, British judge and cricket enthusiast Lord Birkett said [...] "If I know the English <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I do, every Mother in the land will pray for him." [...] During the tour he was presented with a birthday cake on television. However, the trip was unsuccessful in terms of batting.|$|E
500|$|Cooper {{described}} himself as [...] "a truly terrible public speaker" [...] and rarely made addresses from the Senate floor. He was known as an independent Republican during {{his career in the}} Senate. In the first roll-call vote of his career, he opposed transferring investigatory powers to Republican Owen Brewster's special War Investigating Committee. His second vote, directing that proceeds from the sale of war surplus materiel be used to pay off war debts, also went against the majority of the Republican caucus, prompting Ohio Republican Robert A. Taft to ask him [...] "Are you a Republican or a Democrat? When are you going to start voting with us?" [...] Cooper responded, [...] "If you'll pardon me, I was sent here to represent my constituents, and I intend to vote <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> best." ...|$|E
500|$|When the Earl of Mar {{returned}} with James' instructions that Anne {{join him in}} the Kingdom of England, she informed James by letter that she refused to do so unless allowed custody of Henry. This [...] "forceful maternal action", as historian Pauline Croft describes it, obliged James to climb down at last, though he reproved Anne for [...] " [...] womanly apprehensions" [...] and described her behaviour {{in a letter to}} Mar as [...] "wilfulness". After a brief convalescence from the miscarriage, Anne duly travelled south with Prince Henry, their progress causing a sensation in England. Lady Anne Clifford recorded that she and her mother killed three horses in their haste to see the Queen, and that when James met Anne near Windsor, [...] "there was such an infinite number of lords and ladies and so great a Court <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I shall never see the like again." ...|$|E

500|$|Davis {{was happy}} to have an episode of his own, but was puzzled {{at some of the}} contradictions in the script, such as having him assassinate John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., but being {{concerned}} with something as minor as keeping the Buffalo Bills from winning the Super Bowl. Chris Carter said [...] "I had to speak with Bill several times; I spent hours with him on the telephone talking about the character, because the actor felt that the episode really made the character something that it wasn't. I tried to explain to him, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> Jim and Glen were trying to express, that even if your mission in life is a destroyer, that you still have some hope {{in the back of your}} mind that you can be a creator— and that this all of a sudden, this vanity, is his vanity. And we see that so clearly here and it makes him sort of a silly person".|$|E
500|$|The episode also {{explores the}} idea that Reyes made a deal that {{involved}} becoming the Ghost Rider, {{and now he has}} [...] "this thing in" [...] him that wants to murder people which Reyes is [...] "ambivalent" [...] about. Bell said that this is the main aspect of their version that grounds him in [...] "a sadness ... and a weight", particularly when interacting with his brother Gabe. In terms of the season's overarching plot, Bell said it was important to tell Reyes' origin story in the episode, rather than earlier or later, because it also reveals the [...] "truth about Eli, and they're very connected." [...] He also drew comparison to the Marvel Netflix television series which often wait to tell the origin story of their heroes later in the season, using flashbacks, saying, [...] "It kind of helps {{to know more about the}} character, and be emotionally invested in the character, before you then go back and show what turned them into this person. And so part of it was that if you just began with a guy and showed the origin right away, I don't know if it would have been as compelling, I don't know if it would have been as emotional <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it is. Bell noted that the series always shows Reyes' transformations into Ghost Rider as painful, but when that is shown happening for the first time in this episode [...] "he screams in pain like a lunatic".|$|E

2500|$|Accepting the Award, Mr Eastwood said: [...] "Any kind of {{association}} with John Ford is most directors' dream, {{as he was}} certainly a pioneer of American filmmaking and I grew up on his films.

2500|$|Anthony Eden {{summarised}} {{the raising}} and equipping of the British Home Guard during {{a debate in}} the House of Commons in November 1940, when he was Secretary of State for War; [...] "No one will claim for the Home Guard {{that it is a}} miracle of organisation... but many would claim that it is a miracle of improvisation, and in that way it does express the particular genius of our people. If it has succeeded, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it has, it has been due to the spirit of the land and {{of the men in the}} Home Guard." ...|$|E

What then happens when CEOs go into the boardroom, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> most of my colleagues around the table know, is that they tend to generate some excitement by directors themselves. Directors are really starting, in some regard, to go back to basics. One CEO said to me about a week ago, 'Being a board member is starting to be fun again,' and that is not something this particular CEO, who is on a lot of large-cap boards, would have said a year ago." ...|$|E
