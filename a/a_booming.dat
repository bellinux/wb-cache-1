5|$|Monsoon rains {{impact the}} health of the Indian economy; as Indian {{agriculture}} employs 600 million people and comprises 20% of the national GDP, good monsoons correlate with <b>a</b> <b>booming</b> economy. Weak or failed monsoons (droughts) result in widespread agricultural losses and substantially hinder overall economic growth. Yet such rains reduce temperatures and can replenish groundwater tables, rivers.|$|E
5|$|After the Revolution, Boone resettled in Limestone (renamed Maysville, Kentucky in 1786), then <b>a</b> <b>booming</b> Ohio River port. In 1787, he {{was elected}} to the Virginia state {{assembly}} as a representative from Bourbon County. In Maysville, he kept a tavern and worked as a surveyor, horse trader, and land speculator. He was initially prosperous, owning seven slaves by 1787, a relatively large number for Kentucky at the time. Boone became a celebrity while living in Maysville. In 1784, on his 50th birthday, historian John Filson published The Discovery, Settlement And present State of Kentucke, a book which included a chronicle of Boone's adventures.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{the city}} of Galveston was <b>a</b> <b>booming</b> {{metropolis}} with a population of 37,000. Its position on the natural harbor of Galveston Bay along the Gulf of Mexico made it the center of trade in Texas, and one of the largest cotton ports in the nation, in competition with New Orleans. Between 1838 and 1842, 18 newspapers were started to serve the island's rapidly growing population (The Galveston County Daily News is the sole survivor). A causeway linking the island with the mainland was finished in 1860, which paved the way for railroad expansion.|$|E

5|$|Requisitioning disincentivised peasants from {{producing}} more grain {{than they could}} personally consume, and thus production slumped. <b>A</b> <b>booming</b> black market supplemented the official state-sanctioned economy, and Lenin called on speculators, black marketeers and looters to be shot. Both the Socialist Revolutionaries and Left Socialist Revolutionaries condemned the armed appropriations of grain at the Fifth All-Russian Congress of Soviets in July 1918. Realising that the Committees of the Poor Peasants were also persecuting peasants who were not kulaks and thus contributing to anti-government feeling among the peasantry, in December 1918 Lenin abolished them.|$|E
5|$|The Rock Island Railroad {{built the}} first {{railroad}} bridge across the Mississippi River in 1856. It connected Davenport to Rock Island, Illinois. This railway connection resulted in significant improvements to transportation and commerce with Chicago, <b>a</b> <b>booming</b> 19th-century city. The addition of new railroad lines to Muscatine and Iowa City, and the acquisition of other lines by the Rock Island Railroad, resulted in Davenport becoming a commercial railroad hub.|$|E
5|$|The {{first few}} years of the {{federation}} were characterised by a relatively peaceful political atmosphere and <b>a</b> <b>booming</b> economy. The government's coffers were kept full through revenue from Northern Rhodesia's copper mines, and overseas investment saw the rapid expansion of the cities of Salisbury, Bulawayo and Lusaka. High-standard tar roads replaced dirt tracks and the railway system was expanded. Welensky credited the high rate of development to the astute management of the federal Minister of Finance, Donald Macintyre.|$|E

As well as connecting the style to the later Age of Discovery, the role of Antwerp as <b>a</b> <b>booming</b> centre both of world trade and cartography, and the wealthy town-dweller's view of the countryside, art historians have explored the paintings as religious metaphors for the pilgrimage of life.|$|E
5|$|Tiku {{was born}} near Rantepao in the {{highlands}} of Sulawesi (now part of North Toraja Regency, South Sulawesi) in 1846. At the time, southern Sulawesi was home to <b>a</b> <b>booming</b> coffee trade and controlled by numerous warlords. Tiku {{was the last of}} six children born one of these warlords; he was born to Siambo' Karaeng, lord of Pangala', and his wife Leb'ok. An athletic youth, Tiku was friendly with coffee traders who visited his village.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{physical}} examination, {{breath sounds}} (heard with a stethoscope) may be diminished on the affected side, partly because {{air in the}} pleural space dampens the transmission of sound. Measures of the conduction of vocal vibrations {{to the surface of}} the chest may be altered. Percussion of the chest may be perceived as hyperresonant (like <b>a</b> <b>booming</b> drum), and vocal resonance and tactile fremitus can both be noticeably decreased. Importantly, the volume of the pneumothorax can show limited correlation with the intensity of the symptoms experienced by the victim, and physical signs may not be apparent if the pneumothorax is relatively small.|$|E

These party-goers contribute £125 million a year to the economy and support 4,000 jobs. In 2010 the town was awarded a Purple Flag for providing a wide variety of night-time activities while maintaining the safety of both residents and visitors. An independent report published in 2012 indicates there has been a rise in antisocial behaviour which it attributes to the increase in nightlife.|$|E
5|$|After his brother's death, Poe began more earnest {{attempts}} {{to start his}} career as a writer. He chose a difficult time in American publishing to do so. He was the first well-known American to try to live by writing alone and was hampered by the lack of an international copyright law. Publishers often produced unauthorized copies of British works rather than paying for new work by Americans. The industry was also particularly hurt by the Panic of 1837. There was <b>a</b> <b>booming</b> growth in American periodicals around this time period, fueled in part by new technology, but many did not last beyond a few issues and publishers often refused to pay their writers, or paid them much later than they promised. Throughout his {{attempts to}} live as a writer, Poe repeatedly had to resort to humiliating pleas for money and other assistance.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the States Reorganisation Act (1956), Mangalore (part of the Madras Presidency until this time) was {{incorporated}} into the dominion of the newly created Mysore State (now called Karnataka). Mangalore is the fourth largest city of Karnataka in terms of population, and eighth largest port of India, providing Karnataka with access to the Arabian Sea coastline. Mangalore experienced significant growth in the decades 1970–80, with the opening of New Mangalore Port in 1974 and commissioning of Mangalore Chemicals & Fertilizers Limited in 1976. Today, the Mangalore region is a nationally known higher education hub with a flourishing service sector, particularly in medical services, a small but growing IT regional hub, and <b>a</b> <b>booming</b> real estate and banking industry.|$|E

5|$|By the 1930s, Kraków had 120 officially {{registered}} synagogues {{and prayer}} houses that spanned across the old city. Much of Jewish intellectual life {{had moved to}} new centres like Podgórze. This in turn, led to the redevelopment and renovation of much of Kazimierz {{and the development of}} new districts in Kraków. Most historic buildings in central Kazimierz today are preserved in their original form. Some old buildings however, were not repaired after the devastation brought by the Second World War, and have remained empty. Most recent efforts at restoring the historic neighborhoods gained new impetus around 1993. Kazimierz is now a well-visited area, seeing <b>a</b> <b>booming</b> growth in Jewish-themed restaurants, bars, bookstores and souvenir shops.|$|E
5|$|Cage diving is {{most common}} at sites where great whites are {{frequent}} including {{the coast of}} South Africa, the Neptune Islands in South Australia, and Guadalupe Island in Baja California. The popularity of cage diving and swimming with sharks is at the focus of <b>a</b> <b>booming</b> tourist industry. A common practice is to chum the water with pieces of fish to attract the sharks. These practices may make sharks more accustomed to people in their environment and to associate human activity with food; a potentially dangerous situation. By drawing bait on a wire towards the cage, tour operators lure the shark to the cage, possibly striking it, exacerbating this problem. Other operators draw the bait away from the cage, causing the shark to swim past the divers.|$|E
5|$|The company {{worked on}} tight profit margins {{immediately}} post-war. A {{combination of a}} shortage of skilled labour, outdated batch production methods and increasing costs in materials and payroll were matched by rising overhead, a shortage of materials and issues of absenteeism. The result was that despite <b>a</b> <b>booming</b> order book Redman was struggling to fulfil its commitments to customers, and gross margins on lathes were as low as 2.16%. The company {{was by no means}} unique in facing these difficulties but there was much urging, agonising and recriminating, by Gabriel and A K McKay, the Redman managing director since at least 1936, regarding {{how to deal with the}} issues. Some of this, perhaps inevitably as the war-time command economy reverted, was aimed at the government.|$|E

5|$|The picture {{painted by}} the few and {{scattered}} {{references to the}} Cretan emirate from the Muslim world, on the other hand, is of an ordered state with a regular monetary economy and extensive trade links, and {{there is evidence that}} Chandax was a cultural centre of some importance. The survival of numerous gold, silver, and copper coins, of almost constant weight and composition, testifies to a strong economy and a high living standard among the population. The economy was strengthened by extensive trade {{with the rest of the}} Muslim world, especially with Egypt, and by <b>a</b> <b>booming</b> agriculture: the need to sustain an independent state, as well as access to the markets of the Muslim world, led to an intensification of cultivation. It is also possible that sugar cane was introduced to Crete at the time.|$|E
5|$|Downtown Bakersfield {{was heavily}} {{impacted}} by the earthquakes, and many damaged buildings were bulldozed {{to make room for}} buildings that were eventually constructed with newer architectural styles. After World War II, and with <b>a</b> <b>booming</b> economy, the region was experiencing a period of urban renewal. The Kern County Courthouse, St. Francis Church, and the original Beale Memorial Clock Tower were all damaged and were leveled or rebuilt. In what may have been an overambitious push for renewal, some historic buildings that may have been able to be salvaged also were brought down, though some stood for many years after the earthquakes. Some of Bakersfield's unreinforced masonry buildings survived the shocks and were still in use years later, but the cost of retrofitting these buildings was often prohibitive for their owners, and the Bakersfield City Council was given the authority to seize or demolish them in 1993. The city changed its approach in the late 1990s after building owners complained that the upgrade process was too expensive, and the possibility that the city may be left in possession of properties that were left needing the costly renovations.|$|E
5|$|In 1945 Deir al-Balah had a {{population}} of 2,560, all Arabs, with 14,735 dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey. Of this, 327 dunams were for citrus and bananas, 472 plantations and irrigable land, 14,438 used for cereals, while 39 dunams were built-up land. In the lead-up to the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, residents of Deir al-Balah participated in a local attack against the nearby kibbutz of Kfar Darom, despite being discouraged by Egyptian Army officers, but they were repelled and suffered casualties. During the war, Egypt captured the town along with other towns {{in an area that}} became known as the Gaza Strip. The Egyptians later established a sharia court system that held jurisdiction over personal affairs. Egyptian rule introduced relative prosperity to Deir al-Balah. The town witnessed <b>a</b> <b>booming</b> citrus industry made possible by the discovery of a substantial reservoir of ground water in the vicinity.|$|E
