5|$|Author Camilla Fojas later criticized Max Havoc: Curse of the Dragon for its {{shortcoming}} as {{a promotional}} vehicle for Guam and its film industry, noting the colonialistic portrayal of Guam, {{especially in the}} parting scene where U.S. mainland-based characters bid farewell to Chamorro people in <b>a</b> <b>cliché</b> fashion.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{dissolution}} of the court in 1597, the musical style which was inspired by the concerto delle donne spread throughout Europe, and remained prominent for almost fifty years. The concerto delle donne was so influential and often imitated that it became <b>a</b> <b>cliché</b> of northern Italian courts. The concerto brought Alfonso and his court international prestige, as the ladies' reputation spread throughout Italy and southern Germany. It functioned as a powerful tool of propaganda, projecting an image of strength and affluence.|$|E
5|$|Regarded {{as one of}} the series' strongest Pokémon, {{it changed}} the way players {{approached}} the games by forcing them to find ways to counteract those using Mewtwo. Studies found the character popular with older male children, which contrasted with its counterpart and genetic source material, Mew. Reactions to Mewtwo's first anime portrayal have been divided; reviewers such as Daily Record cited it as <b>a</b> <b>cliché</b> villain, while others such as Animerica and Sight & Sound praised the character's depth.|$|E

5|$|The player's {{discovery}} of the Flood in Halo: Combat Evolved is a major plot twist, {{and was one of}} the surprises reviewers noted positively upon release. The Flood's return in Halo2 and Halo3 was less enthusiastically praised. Reaction to the Flood has varied over the years; while some found the Flood too derivative and <b>a</b> <b>cliché</b> element of science fiction, some others ranked them among the greatest villains of all time.|$|E
5|$|Musidora was {{extremely}} well received when first exhibited, and {{considered one of}} the finest works by an English artist. Etty died in 1849 and his work rapidly went out of fashion. At the same time, the topic of Musidora itself became <b>a</b> <b>cliche,</b> and from the 1870s Thomson's writings faded into obscurity. Etty's Musidora is likely to have influenced The Knight Errant by John Everett Millais, but other than that has had little influence on subsequent works. The Tate's version of the painting was exhibited in major exhibitions in 2001–02 in London and in 2011–12 in York.|$|E
5|$|The low-key {{lighting}} schemes of many classic film noirs {{are associated with}} stark light/dark contrasts and dramatic shadow patterning—a style known as chiaroscuro (a term adopted from Renaissance painting). The shadows of Venetian blinds or banister rods, cast upon an actor, a wall, or an entire set, are an iconic visual in noir and had already become <b>a</b> <b>cliché</b> well before the neo-noir era. Characters' faces may be partially or wholly obscured by darkness—a relative rarity in conventional Hollywood filmmaking. While black-and-white cinematography {{is considered by many}} to be one of the essential attributes of classic noir, the color films Leave Her to Heaven (1945) and Niagara (1953) are routinely included in noir filmographies, while Slightly Scarlet (1956), Party Girl (1958), and Vertigo (1958) are classified as noir by varying numbers of critics.|$|E

25|$|It is a {{pastiche}} of Hitler's {{own life}} filtered through a fantasy lens, ending not in defeat but in global, indeed galactic, dominion: the Dominators represent the Jews, Heldon represents Germany, Feric Jaggar represents <b>a</b> <b>cliché,</b> wish-fulfillment, almost Mary Sue-ish self-portrait of Hitler himself, and Jaggar's initial return from Borgravia mirrors Hitler's own birth in Austria.|$|E
25|$|As {{communication}} was difficult due to geographical reasons, a private carrier service {{was established in}} 1868. This first Colombian private carrier provided a weekly mail service of El Dorado, which transported mail from the Siecha lagoon to Bogota, which lasted to 1870. Adhesives were created, <b>a</b> <b>cliché</b> was cut, the value of postage stamps was set to 1 real (10 centavos de peso) and printed on various available papers. The paper varies from plain white stationery, blue-striped paper, paper with watermarks, and a bluish and greenish paper up to squared notebook paper. The sheet size is not known, but there are blocks of four, some with tete-beche pairs, horizontal and vertical pairs and single stamps. Ten postally used covers are recorded between March and November 16, 1870, all related to {{the work on the}} site of the lagoon.|$|E

25|$|In 2001, Strachan {{wrote that}} it is <b>a</b> <b>cliché</b> that the armies marched in 1914 expecting a short war, because many {{professional}} soldiers anticipated a long war. Optimism is a requirement of command and expressing a belief that wars can be quick and lead to a triumphant victory, can be an essential aspect of {{a career as a}} peacetime soldier. Moltke (the Younger) was realistic about the nature of a great European war but this conformed to professional wisdom. Moltke (the Elder) was proved right in his 1890 prognostication to the Reichstag, that European alliances made a repeat of the successes of 1866 and 1871 impossible and anticipated a war of seven or thirty years' duration. Universal military service enabled a state to exploit its human and productive resources to the full but also limited the causes for which a war could be fought and Social Darwinist rhetoric made the likelihood of surrender remote. Having mobilised and motivated the nation, states would fight until they had exhausted their means to continue.|$|E
500|$|... "Think of the children" [...] (also [...] "What {{about the}} children?") is <b>a</b> <b>cliché</b> that {{evolved into a}} rhetorical tactic. Literally it refers to children's rights (as in discussions of child labor). In debate, however, as a plea for pity, used as an appeal to emotion, it is a logical fallacy.|$|E
500|$|The Observer Rachel Cooke {{reviewed}} {{the first episode}} negatively, criticising the acting and unoriginal characterisation. Cooke predicted that HolbyBlue would be a ratings success, but found the series' lack of originality inexcusable given that the BBC is funded by the television licence fee. The Times Andrew Billen commented that John Keenan was [...] "such <b>a</b> <b>cliché</b> that his new deputy Luke French {{told him that he}} was <b>a</b> <b>cliché</b> while admitting that, as a graduate recruit, he was <b>a</b> <b>cliché</b> himself". Billen added that the most that could be said for the show was that it had a healthy pace, and occasionally well-written dialogue. David Chater from the same newspaper also commented on the unoriginality of the characterisation, but praised the [...] "high energy level" [...] and casting. He found it [...] "watchable enough", and suggested that it would prove strong competition to The Bill. Andre Pettie of The Daily Telegraph disliked the pacing, observing that the script moved so fast it was hard to judge the quality of the series, concluding that it was overall unsatisfactory. In contrast, The Guardian Nancy Banks-Smith {{reviewed the}} episode positively, calling it [...] "fast and funny and punctuated with poignancy", and Jod Mitchell of The Daily Telegraph praised the intelligent writing and fast direction, writing that despite its familiarity, the series injected [...] "pace and verve" [...] into the BBC One schedule.|$|E

5000|$|<b>As</b> <b>clichés</b> go, {{the success}} of Junichiro Koizumi showed that Japan may have just been in waiting for a charismatic, media-savvy politician. In the 2005 House of Representatives election, the {{personal}} voter relationship concept was challenged for the first time. So called [...] "assassin candidates", with a pro-postal privatization agenda, were set against the [...] "postal rebels", critics of postal reform, who were cast out of the LDP but still had local ties in their voting districts. Results were mixed, with some districts taken by the [...] "rebels" [...] and some by the [...] "assassins".|$|R
500|$|The President of the United States is {{tolerant}} of mutants, but {{fearful of the}} Brotherhood's threats. While creating the role, the producers felt that [...] a [...] "different" [...] president, like an African American or a woman, had become <b>a</b> <b>cliché</b> in itself and went for a traditional route with an elder caucasian man. Sommer was invited by Ratner following their collaboration in The Family Man.|$|E
500|$|In 1908 Alfred Adler, a psychologist, cited Napoleon to {{describe}} an inferiority complex in which short people adopt an over-aggressive behaviour {{to compensate for}} lack of height; this inspired the term Napoleon complex. The stock character of Napoleon is a comically short [...] "petty tyrant" [...] and this has become <b>a</b> <b>cliché</b> in popular culture. He is often portrayed wearing a large bicorne hat with a hand-in-waistcoat gesture—a reference to the painting produced in 1812 by Jacques-Louis David.|$|E
500|$|Gallagher {{has also}} been very vocal about knife crime. In 2008 he was quoted: [...] "The scumbags are taking over the streets.

500|$|Richard Voorhees, Wodehouse's biographer, {{believes}} that the author used clichés in a deliberate and ironic manner.

500|$|... "Glitter in the Air" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{recording}} artist Pink from her fifth studio album, Funhouse. In 2010, it was released as the sixth single in North America, the only place of its release. Written by Pink and Billy Mann and Michele Mears, the song is a pop ballad with a soft piano accompaniment. Its lyrics talk {{about the power of}} love and taking a leap in faith, while using various metaphors. [...] "Glitter in the Air" [...] received mixed reviews from contemporary critics: some named it the best vocal performance of Funhouse, while others criticized it for being <b>a</b> <b>cliché</b> ballad.|$|E
500|$|The working titles {{for this}} story {{included}} [...] "The Crippingwell Horror" [...] and [...] "The Angels of Crippingwell". The original draft was grimmer, including details about the previous death of Gwyneth's younger brother, but in subsequent drafts the story became more of a [...] "romp". Gatiss stated that the name [...] "Gelth" [...] simply popped into his head. Gatiss was encouraged to personify the Gelth, which he originally questioned because he felt that monsters whispering [...] "Doctor" [...] was a cliché; producer Phil Collinson remarked that perhaps it was <b>a</b> <b>cliché</b> because it worked well. The Rift was added into the plot to simplify the Gelth's origins.|$|E
5000|$|The {{dance at}} the end of the film, choreographed by Giorgos Provias, {{formerly}} known as [...] "Zorba's dance" [...] and later called Sirtaki, has become <b>a</b> popular <b>cliché</b> of Greek dance.|$|R
