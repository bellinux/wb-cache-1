5|$|On June 6, the {{two major}} party campaigns crossed paths in Woodstock, Ontario. Speaking in the afternoon, St. Laurent drew a crowd of 200. To the shock of St. Laurent staffers, who {{remained}} for the Diefenbaker appearance, the PC leader drew an overflow crowd of over a thousand that evening, {{even though he was}} <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>late,</b> with announcements made to the excited crowd that he was slowed by voters who wanted only to see him or shake his hand.|$|E
5|$|Widespread {{blizzard}} conditions wrought {{havoc on}} transportation; streets and highways throughout the hardest-hit areas were clogged with stalled and abandoned vehicles, and multiple major airports {{were forced to}} close. Many schools and businesses were closed, some for days after the storm departed. The New York Stock Exchange opened <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>late</b> on December 12, marking its first delayed opening in over 25years. Extensive drifting of snow left communities isolated and unable to receive deliveries of food and heating fuel. Overall, the storm and subsequent cold snap were blamed for at least 286deaths across a wide area, but primarily in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and the New England states. The fatalities resulted from a multitude of tragedies, including automobile and maritime accidents, storm-related fires, carbon monoxide poisoning, over-exertion, and exposure to cold.|$|E
5|$|At 3:00 AM on October 15, the {{reinforced}} company (less one platoon) {{began moving}} out of Port Said in preparation for its landing. At 3:30, the fire preparation began against the fort. It {{was carried out by}} the 135th Brigade's artillery and an additional artillery battalion. At 4:00, the attack began. The secondary attack force approaching from the west opened fire to draw the garrison's attention. The main force advanced towards the fort, spearheaded by the Sa'iqa company. The Egyptians managed to reach the fort and surprise its garrison. Soon the company {{was on the verge of}} entering the fort. The naval force however, due to bad sea conditions (sea state 4) arrived at 4:30, half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>late,</b> and then was forced to land one kilometer west of the fort. It joined the secondary attack group in its advance against the fortification. The mixed force came under heavy fire, and the battalion commander, Ali al-Mezahi was killed. The Sa'iqa company east of the fort finally succeeded in breaching the fort's defenses under heavy fire; the company commander was hit several times but continued to lead his men. The secondary force also managed to reach the fort's northern sand embankment. The fighting became intense, and the Egyptians picked up a radio signal sent by the garrison commander in which he detailed his men's precarious position and requested immediate assistance, especially air support. Despite the initial success achieved, Salah did not have his reserves on either side of the fort join the attack. With sunrise, Israeli aircraft began attacking Egyptian troops. Two F-4 Phantoms strafed the secondary force and made several bombing runs against it, while helicopters attacked the main force.|$|E

25|$|Beginning {{to think}} he was {{indispensable}} at Radio 1, the first big falling-out with management came in December 1995 after taking his crew out on a 17-hour pub-crawl which ended two hours before they were due on air: Evans was fined one day's pay, £7,000. In 1996, broadcasting watchdogs investigated a continual trail of complaints against the show: Radio 1 refused to comment, Evans never said sorry. Evans also made increasing public demands of the Radio 1 management: after taking an extra week of unplanned holiday, Evans chose to turn up half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>late</b> for his 06:30 show and then demanded that his hours were changed so that it was a permanent fixture – this request was accepted.|$|E
25|$|Just as {{the fighter}} jets {{were about to}} take off, Minneapolis air traffic control {{reestablished}} radio contact with the plane at 8:14 p.m. CDT, by which time the flight was over Eau Claire, Wisconsin, roughly 100 miles east of Minneapolis. The pilots weren't aware of their location until a flight attendant asked them what time they were due to land. The overshoot concerned air traffic controllers enough {{that they had the}} pilots perform a series of maneuvers to confirm the pilots were in control of the plane, as well as to verify that the transponder target they were receiving on their radar was indeed flight 188. The aircraft finally landed, over <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>late,</b> at 9:04 p.m. CDT.|$|E
25|$|On {{the day of}} the duel, Zaretsky gets {{several more}} chances to prevent the duel from happening. Because dueling was {{forbidden}} in the Russian Empire, duels were always held at dawn. Zaretsky urges Lensky to get ready shortly after 6o'clock in the morning (chapter 6, stanza XXIII), while the sun only rises at 20 past 8, because he expects Onegin to be on time. However, Onegin oversleeps (chapter 6, stanza XXIV), and arrives on the scene more than <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>late.</b> According to the dueling codex, if a duelist arrives more than 15 minutes late, he automatically forfeits the duel. Lensky and Zaretsky have been waiting all that time (chapter 6, stanza XXVI), even though it was Zaretsky's duty to proclaim Lensky as winner and take him home.|$|E

25|$|Lakhajirajsinhji was {{invested}} {{with the full}} powers of the gadi in October 1907, at a ceremony in Rajkot conducted by the British resident, Percy Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald had also conducted the installation of Jam Sahib Ranjitsinhji on the gadi of Nawanagar earlier in the year, Ranjitsinhji being another keen cricketer. A conflict arose between Fitzgerald and Lakhajirajsinhji as {{to the time of}} the investiture ceremony. Fitzgerald wished to hold the ceremony at 8:30 a.m., so as to beat the heat, but Lakhajirajsinhji had been informed by his astrologers that the optimum time for the ceremony was at 9 o'clock. Fitzgerald appeared to have won out, but {{on the morning of the}} ceremony, according to an anecdote, Ranjitsinhji, who had been staying with Fitzgerald at the Thakore Saheb's official residence and was to travel in the same carriage, deliberately delayed his morning ablutions so that their carriage arrived half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>late.</b>|$|E
25|$|While the 7th Armoured Division's {{operations}} {{never got}} beyond harassment raids, the New Zealand division's attack was more serious. It involved the experienced 5th New Zealand Brigade {{and the green}} 132nd Brigade (under command from 44th Infantry Division), with armoured support, to attack southward across the supply lines of the Afrika Korps and isolate them east of the Allied lines. The attack, dubbed Operation Beresford, commenced at 22:30 on 3 September. The assault by the 5th New Zealand Brigade on {{the left of the}} attack inflicted heavy losses on the Italian defenders, and the New Zealanders beat off Axis counter-attacks the next morning. However, the attack by the 132nd Brigade was a failure, sustaining heavy losses. They were <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>late</b> arriving at their start line by which time their enemy had been thoroughly roused by diversionary raids by the 6th New Zealand Brigade on their right flank. The brigade commander—Brigadier Robertson—was wounded and the 6th New Zealand Brigade commander, Brigadier Clifton, captured by a patrol of the Italian X battalion Folgore.|$|E
25|$|On 13 June de Gaulle {{attended}} another Anglo-French {{conference at}} Tours with Churchill, Lord Halifax, Lord Beaverbrook, Spears, Ismay and Alexander Cadogan. This time few other major French figures were present apart from Reynaud and Baudoin. He was <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>late,</b> and his account is not reliable. Reynaud demanded that France {{be released from}} the agreement which he had made with Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain in March 1940, so that France could seek an armistice. De Gaulle wrote that Churchill was sympathetic to France seeking an armistice, provided that an agreement was reached about what was {{to happen to the}} French fleet. This claim was later made by apologists for the Vichy Regime, e.g. General Georges, who claimed that Churchill had supported the armistice as a means of keeping the Germans out of French North Africa. However, is not supported by other eyewitnesses (Churchill himself, Roland de Margerie, Spears) who agree that Churchill said that he “understood” the French action but that he did not agree with it. He murmured at de Gaulle that he was “l’homme du destin (the man of destiny)”, although it is unclear whether de Gaulle actually heard him. At the Cabinet meeting that evening Pétain strongly supported Weygand’s demand for an armistice, and said that he himself would remain in France to share the suffering of the French people and to begin the national rebirth. De Gaulle was dissuaded from resigning by the Interior Minister Georges Mandel, who argued that the war was only just beginning, and that de Gaulle needed to keep his reputation unsullied.|$|E

[...] The minority report attracted the opposite reaction.|$|E
