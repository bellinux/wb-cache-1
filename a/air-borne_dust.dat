Sampling of inhalable endotoxin, bacteria, moulds and viruses was performed on one occasion using personal samplers. Noroviruses (NoVs) and endotoxin were detected at concentrations that could pose an occupational health risk and possibly contribute to the increased frequency of gastrointestinal illness among the workers and should therefore be investigated further. In addition, positive correlations between exposure to endo-toxin, bacteria, moulds and NoVs were found and indicate that the exposure to bioaerosols may be related to work tasks.

40|$|The {{environment}} {{is a very}} significant factor in our everyday lives from the aspect of impact on health. It affects us at work and in the home. From the aspect of atmospheric quality {{the condition of the}} environment in the Czech Republic is not very good and represents a serious problem in the Moravian-Silesian Region. <b>Air-borne</b> <b>dust</b> in particular is a very significant pollutant in the city of Ostrava. This work is concerned with atmospheric quality, particularly dust particles, in Ostrava. The work is divided into a theoretical and empirical section. The theoretical section begins with a brief presentation of the history of Ostrava City. I subsequently discuss the quality of the atmosphere throughout the whole Moravian-Silesian Region. The next chapter is specifically about the solid pollutants, which {{can be found in the}} atmosphere. This chapter also specifies the health risks, what causes the harmful effect, describes classification of dust particles depending on harmful component content, division of dust fractions into PM 10 and PM 2, 5 and describes the main sources of PM 10 and PM 2, 5 dust fractions. The next chapter is titled: Toxicologically significant substances bound to solid particles. One sub-chapter covers the group of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which includes the significant atmospheric pollutant called benzo(a) pyrene. The second sub-chapter covers the group of heavy metals and their characteristics with a description of their key harmful effects on human health. The next chapter, called measuring methods for PM 10 fractions, covers classification of measuring methods for automated and manual metering stations. The following chapter discusses legislation concerning <b>air-borne</b> <b>dust.</b> The legislation is divided into two key Czech laws concerning protection of the atmosphere and additional European guidelines. After this chapter we mention the specific stations examining the quality of the atmosphere in Ostrava. The following stations were selected: Station Fifedy, Station Mariánské Hory, Station Zábřeh, Station Přívoz and Station Bartovice ? Radvanice. These metering stations are distributed throughout the territory of the city of Ostrava, thus providing results on concentrations of <b>air-borne</b> <b>dust,</b> which occurred during the period from 2006 to 2011 throughout the territory of Ostrava. Further chapters were devoted to emission limits for protection of human health and the maximum amounts by which these could be exceeded. The emission limits for specific pollutants over 24 hours and 1 calendar year are given in this chapter. The last chapter in the theoretical section is concerned with the smog situation and the conditions for announcing and ending a smog situation. The research or empirical section assesses the results of research, which focused on individuals living within Ostrava City and their awareness of the harmful dust. The results of the questionnaire survey are graphically portrayed in the results chapter. The results of measurements taken by the Czech Hydro-meteorology Office of PM 10 dust fractions for the period between 2007 and 2011 are also processed here. These results are processed into tables for individual years with added with graphic portrayal. I used the questionnaire method for my quantitative research. This contained 19 questions and was distributed to 200 respondents, of which 106 were men and 94 were women. I used secondary data analysis for my additional research, which concerned dust particles. I believe that this work will be useful for offices in the field of communication with citizens, or it can be provided to citizens to read and to inform them of the problems concerning the atmosphere in Ostrava. I also believe that it may be recommended for reading by other towns and cities, which have problems with increased dust pollution...|$|E

An apparatus is described which will automatically maintain a dust-laden atmosphere for long periods at a reason-ably steady level. A simple method for varying the dust level is provided and there are adequate safeguards against failure. ASBESTOS dust has been administered to animals by inhalation with rather crude apparatus. For example, GARDNER used an inhalation chamber in which wooden paddles revolved in a hopper containing asbestos (VORWALD et al., 1951). Wire brushes attached to the blades of the paddles prevented the formation of balls of fibre. Early tests indicated that any attempt to create <b>air-borne</b> <b>dust</b> simply by blowing air through preformed dust would fail because the fibres tend to cling {{to one another and}} to form fluffballs; and slow-running apparatus of the type designed by WRIGHT (1950) jams when a mat of fibres forms.

In the present thesis microbial volatile organic compounds (MVOCs) and cellular markers were studied by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC/MS). By using solid phase microextraction (SPME) combined with GC/MS {{it was found that}} house dust particles may adsorb MVOCs in mold–affected indoor environments and that spontaneous desorption of these volatiles can be delayed by freezing the samples before analysis. SPME/GC–MS can be used to detect MVOC as markers of molds in house dust samples and also in mold–affected building materials. Cellular markers were also studied including 3 –hydroxy fatty acids (endotoxin markers), muramic acid (bacterial biomass marker), and ergosterol (fungal biomass marker). The marker compositions between dust collected in schools in Jordan, Sweden, Poland, and China differed significantly indicating that the school children in different geographical regions may be exposed to highly different microbial flora. Finally, in a school study in Shanghai, China, cellular marker composition of indoor dust was found to relate to health symptoms where fungal components (ergosterol) were related to adverse respiratory symptoms whereas bacterial components, especially as revealed by endotoxin markers, were negatively associated with such symptoms suggesting a protective effect. The presented chemical–analytical approaches are useful in characterizing microbial exposure in indoor environments...|$|E
40|$|The Mars Exploration Rovers each carry {{a set of}} Magnetic Properties Experiments {{designed}} to investigate {{the properties of the}} <b>air-borne</b> <b>dust</b> in the Martian atmosphere. It is a preferred interpretation of previous experiments (Viking 1 & 2, 1976 and Mars Pathfinder, 1997) that the airborne dust in the Martian atmosphere is primarily composed by composite silicate particles containing one or more highly magnetic minerals as a minor constituent, this minor constituent probably being dominated by the mineral maghemite (gamma-Fe 2 O 3). The ultimate goal of the magnetic properties experiments on the Mars Exploration Rover mission is to provide some information/constraints on whether the dust is formed by volcanic, meteoritic, aqueous, or other processes. In detail, the objectives are: a) To identify the magnetic mineral(s) in the dust, soil and rocks on Mars. b) To establish if the magnetic material is present in the form of nanosized (d < 10 nm) superparamagnetic crystallites embedded in the micrometer sized airborne dust part icles. c) To establish if the magnets are culling a subset of strongly magnetic particles or if essentially all particles of the airborne dust are sufficiently magnetic to be attracted by the magnets. d) Detect compositional differences between the airborne dust and the soil and rock sites which are investigated at two landing sites.

Sunlight {{on the surface of}} Mars is altered by <b>air-borne</b> <b>dust</b> that fluctuates in density from day to day. The dust affects both the intensity and spectral content of the sunlight. The MATE flight experiment was designed for this purpose and will fly on the Mars 2001 Surveyor Lander as part of the Mars In-Situ Propellant Production Precursor (MIP) package. MATE will measure the performance of several solar cell technologies and characterize the Martian environment in terms of solar power. This will be done by measuring full IV curves on solar cells, direct and global insolation, temperature, and spectral content. The Lander is is scheduled to launch in April 2001 and arrive on Mars in January of 2002. The site location has not been identified but will be near the equator and last from 100 to 300 days. The intent of this {{of this paper is to}} describe and update the progress on MATE. MATE has four main objectives for its mission to Mars. First is to measure the performance of solar cells daily on the surface of Mars, this will determine the day to day fluctuations in sunlight and temperature and provide a nominal power output. Second, in addition to measuring solar cell performance, it will allow for an intercomparison of different solar cell technologies. Third, It will study the long term effects of dust on the solar cells. Fourth and last, it will characterize the mars environment as viewed by the solar cell, measuring spectrum, insolation, and temperature.

40|$|In {{assessing}} {{human health}} risk of potentially toxic elements (PTEs), {{it is not}} the concentration of PTEs in the environmental matrices that is of greatest concern but the fraction that is absorbed into the body via the exposure pathways. The determination of this fraction (i. e. the bioaccessible fraction) through the application of bioaccessibility protocols is the focus of this work. The study investigated human health risk of PTEs (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Mn, Ni and Zn) from oral ingestion of soil / dust, inhalation of urban street dust and <b>air-borne</b> <b>dust</b> (PM 10). To assess health risk via oral ingestion of soil and dust, total PTEs were determined in twenty nine soil samples collected from children’s playing fields and ninety urban street dusts collected from six cities. Analysis of total PTE content in these samples via ICP-MS revealed high Pb concentrations (> 450 mg/kg) in 3 playground soils and 32 urban street dusts. Detailed quantitative risk assessment (DQRA) carried out in the playgrounds showed that no significant possibility of significant harm exist in the playgrounds. The concentration of Pb from a particular dust sample based on 50 mg/day ingestion rate that a child might possibly ingest to reach the estimated tolerable daily intake was calculated and it exceeded the tolerable daily intake for oral ingestion in 4 cities. The bioaccessible PTEs were determined both in the soil and dust samples using the Unified BARGE method and the result showed that in all the samples, the PTEs solubilised more in the gastric phase than in the intestinal phase.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{chemically}} characterise emissions and ambient concentrations of superficial aerosols in an industrial region using a methodologically broad approach. Temporal and spatial variabilities were quantified for scales ranging from 1 to 1000 kilometres and from time of day to time of year, respectively. The degree of accumulation of aerosol constituents in air masses passing over metropolitan areas was quantified on the basis of two episodes near Berlin, i. e. for an industrial and an agricultural region subject to strong anthropogenic influences. Heavy metal concentrations in <b>air-borne</b> <b>dust</b> were found to be at least as high at rural locations in this region as they were at urban locations, and all heavy metals found were predominantly of anthropogenic origin. The data analysis entailed pioneer work, involving amongst other things an improved use of backward trajectories and of the partly mutually independent variables observable trace substance concentration (mueg/m- 3) and trace substance ratio in the particle phase (mg/g). Major new insights were gained with regard to the occurrence of dicarbonic acids, which are quantitatively probably the most significant component of the organic fraction of the particulate material. For this purpose a simple fluid chromatographic method was developed. However, the formation pathways of dicarbonic acids, and of secondary organic particulate material in general, still remain to be clarified. Information gathered on animal husbandry as a potential aerosol source, incidentally another pioneer accomplishment of this study, revealed insights that merit a closer study of this emission source. In einem methodisch breiten Ansatz wurde das bodennahe Aerosol in der Industrieregion in Immission und Emission chemisch charakterisiert. Die raeumlichen und zeitlichen Variabilitaeten wurden in den Skalenbereichen 1 - 1000 km bzw. Tageszeiten-Jahreszeiten quantifiziert. In welchem Masse Luftmassen beim Transport ueber Ballungsgebieten mit Aerosolinhaltsstoffen angereichert werden, konnte anhand zweier Episoden bei Berlin quantifiziert werden. Der Luftstaub war an laendlichen Orten der stark anthropogen gepraegten Industrie- und Agrarregion mindestens gleich stark wie an den urbanen durch Schwermetalle vornehmlich anthropogenen Ursprungs angereichert. Bei der Datenanalyse wurden u. a. durch verbesserte Nutzung von Rueckwaertstrajektorien und der beiden z. T. voneinander unabhaengigen Observablen Spurenstoffkonzentration (#mu#g/m" 3) und -mischungsverhaeltnis in der Partikelphase (#mu#g) neue Wege beschritten. Hinsichtlich des Vorkommens von Dicarbonsaeuren, die mengemaessig wohl bedeutendste Stoffgruppe des organischen Anteils des Partikelmaterials, wurden erhebliche Erkenntnisse gewonnen. Hierfuer wurde eine einfache fluessigchromatographische Methode entwickelt. Die Bildungswege, wie die von sekundaerem organischen Partikelmaterial generell, sind jedoch noch unklar.

40|$|International audienceCurrent {{and future}} climate-related drivers of risk for small islands during the 21 st century include sea level rise (SLR), {{tropical}} and extratropical cyclones, increasing air and sea surface temperatures, and changing rainfall patterns (high confidence; robust evidence, high agreement). {WGI AR 5 Chapter 14; Table 29 - 1 } Current impacts {{associated with these}} changes confirm findings reported on small islands from the Fourth Assessment Report (AR 4) and previous IPCC assessments. The future risks associated with these drivers include loss of adaptive capacity { 29. 6. 2. 1, 29. 6. 2. 3 } and ecosystem services critical to lives and livelihoods in small islands. { 29. 3. 1 - 3 }SLR poses {{one of the most}} widely recognized climate change threats to low-lying coastal areas on islands and atolls (high confidence; robust evidence, high agreement). { 29. 3. 1 } It is virtually certain that global mean SLR rates are accelerating. {WGI AR 5 13. 2. 2. 1 } Projected increases to the year 2100 (RCP 4. 5 : 0. 35 m to 0. 70 m) {WGI AR 5 13. 5. 1; Table 29 - 1 } superimposed on extreme sea level events (e. g., swell waves, storm surges, El Niño-Southern Oscillation) present severe sea flood and erosion risks for low-lying coastal areas and atoll islands (high confidence). Likewise, there is high confidence that wave over-wash of seawater will degrade fresh groundwater resources { 29. 3. 2 } and that sea surface temperature rise will result in increased coral bleaching and reef degradation. { 29. 3. 1. 2 } Given the dependence of island communities on coral reef ecosystems for a range of services including coastal protection, subsistence fisheries, and tourism, there is high confidence that coral reef ecosystem degradation will negatively impact island communities and livelihoods. Given the inherent physical characteristics of small islands, the AR 5 reconfirms the high level of vulnerability of small islands to multiple stressors, both climate and non-climate (high confidence; robust evidence, high agreement). However, the distinction between observed and projected impacts of climate change is often not clear in the literature on small islands (high agreement). { 29. 3 } There is evidence that this challenge can be partly overcome through improvements in baseline monitoring of island systems and downscaling of climate- model projections, which would heighten confidence in assessing recent and projected impacts. {WGI AR 5 9. 6; 29. 3 - 4, 29. 9 }Small islands do not have uniform climate change risk profiles (high confidence). Rather, their high diversity in both physical and human attributes and their response to climate-related drivers means that climate change impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation will be variable from one island region to another and between countries in the same region. {Figure 29 - 1; Table 29 - 3 } In the past, this diversity in potential response has not always been adequately integrated in adaptation planning. There is increasing recognition of the risks to small islands from climate-related processes originating well beyond the borders of an individual nation or island. Such transboundary processes already have a negative impact on small islands (high confidence; robust evidence, medium agreement). These include <b>air-borne</b> <b>dust</b> from the Sahara and Asia, distant-source ocean swells from mid to high latitudes, invasive plant and animal species, and the spread of aquatic pathogens. For island communities the risks associated with existing and future invasive species and human health challenges are projected to increase in a changing climate. { 29. 5. 4 }Adaptation to climate change generates larger benefit to small islands when delivered in conjunction with other development activities, such as disaster risk reduction and community-based approaches to development (medium confidence). { 29. 6. 4 } Addressing the critical social, economic, and environmental issues of the day, raising awareness, and communicating future risks to local communities { 29. 6. 3 } will likely increase human and environmental resilience to the longer term impacts of climate change. { 29. 6. 1, 29. 6. 2. 3; Figure 29 - 5 }Adaptation and mitigation on small islands are not always trade-offs, but can be regarded as complementary components in the response to climate change (medium confidence). Examples of adaptation-mitigation interlinkages in small islands include energy supply and use, tourism infrastructure and activities, and functions and services associated with coastal wetlands. The alignment of these sectors for potential emission reductions, together with adaptation, offer co-benefits and opportunities in some small islands. { 29. 7. 2, 29. 8 } Lessons learned from adaptation and mitigation experiences in one island may offer some guidance to other small island states, though there is low confidence in the success of wholesale transfer of adaptation and mitigation options when the local lenses through which they are viewed differ from one island state to the next, given the diverse cultural, socioeconomic, ecological, and political values. { 29. 6. 2, 29. 8 }The ability of small islands to undertake adaptation and mitigation programs, and their effectiveness, can be substantially strengthened through appropriate assistance from the international community (medium confidence). However, caution is needed to ensure such assistance is not driving the climate change agenda in small islands, as there is a risk that critical challenges confronting island governments and communities may not be addressed. Opportunities for effective adaptation can be found by, for example, empowering communities and optimizing the benefits of local practices that have proven to be efficacious through time, and working synergistically to progress development agendas. { 29. 6. 2. 3, 29. 6. 3, 29. 8...|$|E
