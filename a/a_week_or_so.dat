5|$|The {{canonical}} five murders were perpetrated at night, on {{or close}} to a weekend, either {{at the end of}} a month or <b>a</b> <b>week</b> (<b>or</b> <b>so)</b> after. The mutilations became increasingly severe as the series of murders proceeded, except for that of Stride, whose attacker may have been interrupted. Nichols was not missing any organs; Chapman's uterus was taken; Eddowes had her uterus and a kidney removed and her face mutilated; and Kelly's body was eviscerated and her face hacked away, though only her heart was missing from the crime scene.|$|E
5|$|The fly Ormia ochracea {{has very}} acute hearing and targets calling male crickets. It locates its prey by ear and then lays its eggs nearby. The {{developing}} larvae burrow inside any crickets {{with which they}} come in contact {{and in the course}} of <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> devour what remains of the host before pupating. In Florida, the parasitic flies were only present in the autumn, and at that time of year, the males sang less but for longer periods. A trade-off exists for the male between attracting females and being parasitized.|$|E

5000|$|However omniscient {{they may}} sound, {{one of the}} most {{important}} features of these automatons is their ability to make mistakes and develop false models. Blue may decide that a military battle would be their best option, although it might have delayed or incomplete intelligence of Red. Another scenario might involve the two sides computing a battle victory using different standards. Red may decide to battle Blue, even if it knows they will not ‘’win’’ the battle. Its goal may just be to weaken Blue’s forces enough to set them back <b>a</b> few <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> months. <b>So</b> Blue would calculate a victory, but so would Red. The different victory calculations and the ability to make realistic mistakes just add to the fidelity of this simulation.|$|R
25|$|After Cornell, Harris {{traveled}} back to Logan {{to become}} a professor of agronomy and an agronomist at Utah State Agricultural College.

25|$|After G. E. Moore {{resigned}} {{the chair}} in philosophy in 1939, Wittgenstein was elected, and acquired British citizenship soon afterwards. In July 1939 he travelled to Vienna to assist Gretl and his other sisters, visiting Berlin for one day to meet {{an official of the}} Reichsbank. After this, he travelled to New York to persuade Paul, whose agreement was required, to back the scheme. The required Befreiung was granted in August 1939. The unknown amount signed over to the Nazis by the Wittgenstein family, <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> before the outbreak of war, included amongst many other assets, 1700kg of gold.

25|$|Goldfish, {{like all}} cyprinids, are egg-layers. They usually start {{breeding}} after a significant temperature change, often in spring. Males chase females, prompting them to release their eggs by bumping and nudging them. As the female goldfish spawns her eggs, the male goldfish stays close behind fertilizing them. Their eggs are adhesive and attach to aquatic vegetation. The eggs hatch within 48 to 72 hours. Within <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> the fry begins to assume its final shape, although a year may pass before they develop a mature goldfish colour; until {{then they are}} a metallic brown like their wild ancestors. In their first weeks of life, the fry grow quickly—an adaptation born of the high risk of getting devoured by the adult goldfish.|$|E

500|$|Spawning is {{preceded by}} {{significant}} upstream migrations if high spring flows or floods allow. Radio-tracked Murray cod in the Murray River have migrated up to [...] upstream to spawn, {{before returning to}} exactly the same snag from where they departed, an unusual homing behaviour in a freshwater fish. Decades of observations by recreational and commercial fishermen suggest such spring spawning migrations are common across the Murray cod's geographical range. Spawning is initiated by pairing up and courtship rituals. During the courtship ritual a spawning site is selected and cleaned — hard surfaces such as rocks in upland rivers and impoundments, and logs and occasionally clay banks in lowland rivers, {{at a depth of}} , are selected. The female lays the large adhesive eggs as a mat on the spawning surface, which the male fertilises. The female then leaves the spawning site. The male remains to guard the eggs during incubation, which takes six to 10 days (depending on water temperature), and to guard the hatched larvae for <b>a</b> further <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> until they disperse. Larvae disperse from the nest site by drifting in river currents at night, and continue this behaviour around four to seven days. During this dispersal process, larvae simultaneously absorb the remainder of their yolk sac and begin to feed on pelagic zooplankton, small, early life-stage macroinvertebrates and epibenthic/epiphytic (bottom dwelling/edge clinging) microinvertebrates.|$|R
60|$|Once {{more the}} Capataz stepped back. He {{wondered}} who it was--some Monterist? But he dreaded to show himself. To discover his presence on shore, unless after many days, would, he believed, endanger the treasure. With his own knowledge possessing his whole soul, it seemed impossible that anybody in Sulaco should fail to {{jump at the}} right surmise. After <b>a</b> couple of <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> it would be different. Who could tell he had not returned overland from some port {{beyond the limits of}} the Republic? The existence of the treasure confused his thoughts with a peculiar sort of anxiety, as though his life had become bound up with it. It rendered him timorous for a moment before that enigmatic, lighted door. Devil take the fellow! He {{did not want to see}} him. There would be nothing to learn from his face, known or unknown. He was a fool to waste his time there in waiting.|$|R
25|$|Pregnant females {{give birth}} soon after {{arriving}} on a rookery, and copulation generally occurs {{one to two}} weeks after giving birth, but the fertilized egg does not become implanted in the uterus until the fall. Twins are rare. After <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of nursing without leaving the rookery, females begin to take progressively longer and more frequent foraging trips, leaving their pups behind, until {{at some point in}} late summer the mother and pup both leave the rookery. Reproductive males fast throughout the reproductive season, often without entering the water once from mid-May until August, when the structure of the reproductive rookeries begins to fall apart and most animals leave for the open seas and disperse throughout their range.|$|E
25|$|When {{questioned}} {{as to why}} {{the heads}} found at Cranley Gardens had been subjected to moist heat, Nilsen stated that he had frequently boiled the heads of his victims in a large cooking pot on his stove in order that the internal contents would evaporate, thus removing the need to dispose of the brain and flesh. The torsos and limbs of the three victims killed at this address would be dissected within <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of their murder before being wrapped in plastic bags and stowed in the three locations he had indicated to police; the internal organs and smaller bones he would flush down the toilet. This practice — which had led to his arrest — had been the only method he could consider to dispose of the internal organs and soft tissue as, unlike at Melrose Avenue, he had no exclusive usage of the garden of the property.|$|E
25|$|British Intelligence did {{not predict}} {{the scale of}} Georgette, {{although}} in fairness the Germans were changing their plans frequently and only finalised their intentions <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> beforehand. The Germans enjoyed significant artillery superiority (although less {{than they would have}} preferred after the intense fighting in the Somme sector) and some of the BEF line was held by poor-quality Portuguese divisions. Foch visited Haig at 1pm on 9 April, and again refused Haig’s demand that the French take over more BEF line so as to free up a British reserve. Haig felt that Foch’s proposal to deploy 4 French divisions west of Amiens would simply increase Rawlinson’s logistical troubles without doing much to help. On 10 April Georgette was extended northwards, as von Arnim’s Fourth Army also attacked, forcing the evacuation of Armentieres by Du Cane’s XV Corps. Haig yet again demanded that the French take over “some portion” of the British line and give French assistance “in order … to continue the battle”.|$|E
50|$|This {{backwater}} {{is called}} Wallabout Bay on charts; {{the men on}} the dredges call it Potter's Field. The eddy sweeps driftwood into the backwater. Also, it sweeps drownded bodies into there. As a rule, people that drown in the harbor in winter stay down until spring. When the water begins to get warm, gas forms in them and that makes them buoyant and they rise to the surface. Every year, without fail, on or about the fifteenth of April, bodies start showing up, and more of them show up in Potter's Field than any other place. In <b>a</b> couple of <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> the Harbor Police always finds ten to two dozen over there - suicides, bastard babies, old barge captains that lost their balance out on a sleety night attending to towropes, now and then some gangster or other.

60|$|In {{the month}} of September there are {{generally}} <b>a</b> couple of <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of extremely fine weather, which is called the Indian summer; after which winter, with frost, cold, and snow, sets in with rapidity. For <b>a</b> few <b>weeks</b> in October there is sometimes a little warm weather (or rather, I should say, a little thawy, weather); but after that, until the following April, the thermometer seldom rises to the freezing-point. In the depth of winter it falls from 30 to 40, 45, and even 50 degrees below zero of Fahrenheit. This intense cold, however, {{is not so much}} felt as one might suppose, as during its continuance the air is perfectly calm. Were the slightest breath of wind to arise when the thermometer stands so low, no man could show his face to it for a moment. Forty degrees below zero, and quite calm, is infinitely preferable to fifteen degrees below, or thereabouts, with a strong breeze of wind. Spirit of wine is, of course, the only liquid {{that can be used in}} the thermometers, as mercury, were it exposed to such cold, would remain frozen nearly half the winter. Spirit never froze in any cold ever experienced at York Factory, unless when very much adulterated with water; and even then the spirit would remain liquid in the centre of the mass [see note 1].|$|R
