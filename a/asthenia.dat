25|$|<b>Asthenia</b> (Greek: ἀσθένεια, lit lack of {{strength}} but also disease) {{is a medical}} term referring to {{a condition in which}} the body lacks or has lost strength either as a whole or in any of its parts. It denotes symptoms of physical weakness and loss {{of strength}}. General <b>asthenia</b> occurs in many chronic wasting diseases (such as tuberculosis and cancer), sleep disorders or chronic disorders of the heart, lungs or kidneys, and is probably most marked in diseases of the adrenal gland. <b>Asthenia</b> may be limited to certain organs or systems of organs, as in asthenopia, characterized by ready fatiguability. <b>Asthenia</b> is also a side effect of some medications and treatments, such as Ritonavir (a protease inhibitor used in HIV treatment), vaccines such as the HPV vaccine Gardasil and fentanyl patches (an opioid used to treat pain).|$|E
25|$|Gastro-intestinal (GI) {{effects and}} <b>asthenia</b> {{are the most}} common adverse events.|$|E
25|$|The {{pathological}} well-being (euphoria) or hyperactivity {{may produce}} {{a state of}} exhaustion, and profound fatigue or <b>asthenia</b> chiefly characterizes the picture.|$|E
25|$|A marked {{increase}} in fatigability, or <b>asthenia,</b> is often prominent. This increased weariness {{may be combined}} with hyperactivity; patients remark that they are impelled to incessant activity, which, however, causes great fatigue.|$|E
25|$|Weakness or <b>asthenia</b> is {{a symptom}} of a number of {{different}} conditions. The causes are many and can be divided into conditions that have true or perceived muscle weakness. True muscle weakness is a primary symptom of a variety of skeletal muscle diseases, including muscular dystrophy and inflammatory myopathy. It occurs in neuromuscular junction disorders, such as myasthenia gravis.|$|E
25|$|Common (1–10% of patients): blurred vision, diplopia, {{increased}} {{appetite and}} subsequent weight gain, euphoria, confusion, vivid dreams, changes in libido (increase or decrease), irritability, ataxia, attention changes, feeling high, abnormal coordination, memory impairment, tremors, dysarthria, parasthesia, vertigo, dry mouth and constipation, vomiting and flatulence, erectile dysfunction, fatigue, peripheral edema, feeling {{the effects of}} drunkenness, abnormal walking, <b>asthenia,</b> nasopharyngitis, increased creatine kinase level.|$|E
25|$|Fentanyl's {{most common}} side effects (more than 10% of patients) include diarrhoea, nausea, constipation, dry mouth, somnolence, confusion, <b>asthenia</b> (weakness), sweating, and less {{frequently}} (3 to 10 % of patients) abdominal pain, headache, fatigue, anorexia and weight loss, dizziness, nervousness, hallucinations, anxiety, depression, flu-like symptoms, dyspepsia (indigestion), dyspnoea (shortness of breath), hypoventilation, apnoea, and urinary retention. Fentanyl use {{has also been}} associated with aphasia.|$|E
25|$|Although its {{clinical}} efficacy is uncertain, it is {{the only}} compound used to treat <b>asthenia</b> that is known to selectively target the areas that are involved in the condition. In addition to its use as a treatment for chronic fatigue, sulbutiamine may improve memory, reduce psycho-behavioural inhibition, and improve erectile dysfunction. At therapeutic dosages, it has few reported adverse effects. It is available for over-the-counter sale as a nutritional supplement.|$|E
25|$|Paroxetine shares many of {{the common}} adverse effects of SSRIs, {{including}} (with the corresponding rates seen in people treated with placebo in parentheses): nausea 26% (9%), diarrhea 12% (8%), constipation 14% (9%), dry mouth 18% (12%), somnolence 23% (9%), insomnia 13% (6%), headache 18% (17%), hypomania 1% (0.3%), blurred vision 4%(1%), loss of appetite 6% (2%), nervousness 5% (3%), paraesthesia 4% (2%), dizziness 13% (6%), <b>asthenia</b> (weakness; 15% (6%)), tremor 8% (2%), sweating 11% (2%), and sexual dysfunction (≥10% incidence). Most of these adverse effects are transient and go away with continued treatment. Central and peripheral 5-HT3 receptor stimulation is believed to result in the gastrointestinal effects observed with SSRI treatment. Compared to other SSRIs, it has a lower incidence of diarrhea, {{a higher incidence of}} anticholinergic effects (e.g., dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, etc.), sedation/somnolence/drowsiness, sexual side effects, and weight gain.|$|E
2500|$|The Zhouhou beiji fang 肘后备急方 [...] "Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergencies", {{attributed}} to the Daoist scholar Ge Hong (263-420), uses the name of shizhu 尸疰 [...] "corpse disease; tuberculosis" [...] and describes the symptoms and contagion: [...] "This disease has many changing symptoms varying from thirty-six to ninety-nine different kinds. Generally it {{gives rise to a}} high fever, sweating, <b>asthenia,</b> unlocalised pains, making all positions difficult. Gradually, after months and years of suffering, this lingering disease brings about death to the sufferer. Afterwards it is transferred to others until the whole family is wiped out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Side effects {{observed}} in fluoxetine-treated persons in clinical trial with an incidence >5% {{and at least}} twice as common in fluoxetine-treated persons compared to those who received a placebo pill include abnormal [...] dreams, abnormal ejaculation, anorexia, anxiety, <b>asthenia,</b> diarrhea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, flu syndrome, impotence, insomnia, decreased libido, nausea, nervousness, pharyngitis, rash, sinusitis, somnolence, sweating, tremor, vasodilatation, and yawning. Fluoxetine is considered the most stimulating of the SSRIs (that is, it is most prone to causing insomnia and agitation). It also appears to be the most prone of the SSRIs for producing dermatologic reactions (e.g. urticaria (hives), rash, itchiness, etc.).|$|E
2500|$|Luke is {{the gospel}} writer {{who was a}} physician, and while his {{profession}} may have motivated his interest, nothing suggests a medical diagnosis. <b>Asthenia</b> throughout the New Testament means [...] "weakness" [...] or [...] "powerlessness" [...] of any kind, including sickness. Some have seen the affliction as ankylosing spondylitis, but an alternative interpretation is that hard labor over the years had bent the woman's back. The incident has been examined at length {{from the perspective of}} feminist theology by Francis Taylor Gench, who views it as both healing and liberating; Jesus {{goes on to say that}} the woman has been freed from a kind of bondage to Satan. The breaking of bonds or chains is often associated with freedom from an unclean spirit; in the case of the Gerasene demon (above), the demoniac had the physical power to break chains as a result of possession.|$|E
2500|$|Hereditary Equine Regional Dermal <b>Asthenia</b> (HERDA), {{also known}} as hyperelastosis cutis (HC). [...] This is caused by an {{autosomal}} recessive gene, and thus, unlike HYPP, HERDA can only be transmitted if both parents carry the gene. [...] When a horse has this disease, there is a collagen defect that results in the layers of skin not being held firmly together. Thus, when the horse is ridden under saddle or suffers trauma to the skin, the outer layer often splits or separates from the deeper layer, or it can tear off completely. It rarely heals without disfiguring scars. Sunburn {{can also be a}} concern. In dramatic cases, the skin can split along the back and even roll down the sides, with the horse literally being skinned alive. [...] Most horses with HERDA are euthanized for humane reasons between the age of two and four years. [...] The very hotly debated and controversial theory, put forth by researchers at Cornell University and Mississippi State University is that the sire line of the great foundation stallion Poco Bueno is implicated as the origin of the disease. [...] As of May 9, 2007, Researchers working independently at Cornell University and at the University of California, Davis announced that a DNA test for HERDA has been developed. Over 1,500 horses were tested during the development phase of the test, which is now available to the general public through both institutions.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are many}} {{names for the}} syndrome, which has {{variously}} been called cardiac neurosis, chronic <b>asthenia,</b> effort syndrome, functional cardiovascular disease, neurocirculatory <b>asthenia,</b> primary neurasthenia, and subacute <b>asthenia.</b> Da Costa himself called it irritable heart and the term soldier's heart was in common use {{both before and after}} his paper. Most authors use these terms interchangeably, but some authors draw a distinction between the different manifestations of this condition, preferring to use different labels to highlight the predominance of psychiatric or non-psychiatric complaints. For example, Oglesby Paul writes that [...] "Not all patients with neurocirculatory <b>asthenia</b> have a cardiac neurosis, and not all patients with cardiac neurosis have neurocirculatory asthenia." [...] None of these terms have widespread use.|$|E
