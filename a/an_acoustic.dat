5|$|The {{speed of}} sound varies with {{temperature}}. Since temperature and sound velocity normally decrease with increasing altitude, sound is refracted upward, away from listeners on the ground, creating <b>an</b> <b>acoustic</b> shadow at {{some distance from the}} source. In the 1862, during the American Civil War Battle of Iuka, <b>an</b> <b>acoustic</b> shadow, believed to have been enhanced by a northeast wind, kept two divisions of Union soldiers out of the battle, because they could not hear the sounds of battle only six miles downwind.|$|E
5|$|According to Bieber, {{he wanted}} to release the album for the naysayers who critiqued his actual singing ability. The singer said that {{he wanted to}} have <b>an</b> <b>acoustic</b> album, to reflect the effect of {{production}} on his vocals. Although labeled as <b>an</b> <b>acoustic</b> album, the songs still include subtle usages of electronic sounds such as synthesizers. The album received generally favorable reviews from critics, however most critics were not satisfied that the album was not genuinely acoustic. In Canada, the song debuted at number five, and later peaked at number four on the Canadian Albums Chart and certified Platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association. My Worlds Acoustic debuted at number seven on the US Billboard 200, selling 115,000 copies in its first week, becoming Bieber's third consecutive top ten album.|$|E

40|$|DE 10233636 A UPAB: 20040331 NOVELTY - The {{information}} extraction device has a device for reception of a reflected signal with a first carrier signal frequency and a reflected signal {{with a second}} carrier signal frequency, upon application of 2 different carrier signal frequencies to the surface acoustic wave sensor, with determination of the phase variations for both carrier signal frequencies, for calculation of distance information from the corresponding signal propagation time. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following: (1) a device for matching an evaluation circuit to <b>a</b> surface <b>acoustic</b> wave sensor; (2) a device for determining the non-ideality of a modulation device coupled to <b>a</b> surface <b>acoustic</b> wave sensor; (3) a device for calibration of a modulation device coupled to <b>a</b> surface <b>acoustic</b> wave sensor; (4) a method for extraction of distance information from <b>a</b> surface <b>acoustic</b> wave sensor; (5) a method for matching an evaluation circuit to <b>a</b> surface <b>acoustic</b> wave sensor; (6) a method for determining the non-ideality of a modulation device coupled to <b>a</b> surface <b>acoustic</b> wave sensor; (7) a method for calibration of a modulation device coupled to <b>a</b> surface <b>acoustic</b> wave sensor; and (8) a computer program with computer codes for extracting distance information from <b>a</b> surface <b>acoustic</b> wave sensor, for matching an evaluation circuit to <b>a</b> surface <b>acoustic</b> wave sensor, for determining the non-ideality of a modulation device coupled to <b>a</b> surface <b>acoustic</b> wave sensor and/or for calibration of a modulation device coupled to <b>a</b> surface <b>acoustic</b> wave sensor USE - The device is used for extraction of distance information from <b>a</b> surface <b>acoustic</b> wave sensor, e. g. for an absolute distance measurement. ADVANTAGE - Use of 2 carrier frequency signals provides increased accuracy without increased manufacturing complexity...|$|R
