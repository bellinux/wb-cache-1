5|$|The meat of Highland cattle {{tends to}} be leaner than most beef because Highlands are largely {{insulated}} by their thick, shaggy hair rather than by subcutaneous fat. Highland cattle can produce beef <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> profit from land that would otherwise normally be unsuitable for agriculture. The most profitable way to produce Highland beef is on poor pasture in their native land, the Highlands of Scotland. The meat is also gaining popularity in North America as the beef is low in cholesterol.|$|E

5|$|In February 1953, Lympne {{was again}} {{waterlogged}} and Silver City Airways operated out of Southend and Blackbushe. The company {{stated that they}} were willing to purchase Lympne, but the decision of Folkestone Town Council was still awaited for. By May, Folkestone Town Council had decided not to purchase Lympne and Silver City Airways again expressed an interest in purchasing the airport <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> price. In November, it was announced that Air Kruise had been given permission to operate a scheduled service from Lympne and/or Ramsgate to Birmingham. The service was to be seasonal between April and September, with permission to run the service lasting until 1960. Air Kruise moved its operations to Ramsgate Airport in 1953.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} over, Compton greatly troubled Bradman, who edged two balls and was dropped once. At the other end, Morris {{continued}} {{to take advantage}} of Hutton's inaccurate leg breaks, and Australia reached lunch at 1/121, with the opener on 63 and his captain on 35. Hutton had conceded 30 runs in four overs, and in the half-hour preceding the interval, Australia had added 64 runs. Although Australia had scored <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> rate, they had also been troubled by many of the deliveries and were expected to face further difficulty if they were to avoid defeat.|$|E
5|$|Land {{is defined}} as the surface, subsoil, {{airspace}} and anything permanently attached to the land, such as houses. The rights of landowners over airspace are not unlimited; in Bernstein of Leigh v Skyviews & General Ltd, the action for trespass failed because the violation of airspace took place several hundred metres above the land. This was backed up by the Civil Aviation Act 1982, which provides that it is not trespass if the aircraft is flying <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> height. An overhanging crane can constitute trespass, as in Woolerton v Costain, as can an advertising sign, as in Kelsen v Imperial Tobacco Co. Possession does not necessarily mean the ownership of land, but the right to eject or exclude others from it.|$|E

5|$|In {{the next}} over, Compton bowled a googly to deceive Bradman, who {{expected}} {{the ball to}} turn in. However, it went the other way, took the outside edge and ran away past slip for four. Bradman leg glanced the next ball for another boundary, before again failing to read a googly on the third ball of the over. This time the edge went to Crapp, who failed {{to hold on to}} the catch. The sixth ball of Compton's over beat Bradman and hit him on the pads. Compton had control of Bradman for the over, but went unrewarded. At the other end, Morris continued to plunder Hutton's inaccurate leg breaks, and Australia reached lunch at 121/1, with Morris on 63 and Bradman on 35. Hutton had conceded 30 runs in four overs, and in the half hour preceding the interval, Australia had added 64 runs. Both Morris and Bradman had been given lives. Although Australia had scored <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> rate, they had also been troubled by many of the deliveries and were expected to face further difficulty if they were to avoid defeat.|$|E

25|$|HI is {{preferred}} over other hydrogen halides because the iodide ion {{is a much}} better nucleophile than bromide or chloride, so the reaction can take place <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> rate without much heating.

25|$|In June 1999, in {{an attempt}} to become an {{integrated}} generating and retail company, British Energy bought the retail electricity and gas supplier SWALEC based in Wales, providing 6% of the England and Wales electricity supply market.

25|$|It {{was from}} around 1770 that Arnold {{developed}} the portable precision timekeeper, {{almost from the}} point where John Harrison ended his work in this field. But, compared to Harrison's complicated and expensive watch, Arnold's basic design was simple whilst consistently accurate and mechanically reliable. Importantly, the relatively simple and conventional design of his movement facilitated its production in quantity <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> price whilst also enabling easier maintenance and adjustment.|$|E
40|$|The gedanken {{experiment}} of Elitzur and Vaidman showing {{wave-particle duality}} was realized as <b>a</b> demonstration <b>at</b> <b>a</b> scientific exposition.

25|$|These early mines had a steep {{learning}} curve {{to deal with}} before their bitumen mining techniques became efficient. In the intervening years, more effective in-situ production techniques were developed, particularly steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD). In-situ methods became increasingly important because only about 20% of the Athabasca oil sands were shallow enough to recover by surface mining, and the SAGD method in particular was very efficient at recovering large amounts of bitumen <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> cost.|$|E
25|$|If the {{foreground}} lensing star has a planet, then that planet's own gravitational field {{can make a}} detectable contribution to the lensing effect. Since that requires a highly improbable alignment, {{a very large number}} of distant stars must be continuously monitored in order to detect planetary microlensing contributions <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> rate. This method is most fruitful for planets between Earth and the center of the galaxy, as the galactic center provides a large number of background stars.|$|E
25|$|Next {{came the}} 1984 Fiero. This {{was a major}} {{departure}} from anything Pontiac had produced in the past. A two-seat, mid-engined coupe, the Fiero was targeted straight at the same market that Semon Knudsen had been aiming for in the late 1950s: the young, affluent buyer who wanted sporting performance <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> price. The Fiero was also an instant success and was partially responsible for Pontiac seeing its first increase in sales in four years.|$|E
