40|$|This article {{reports on}} {{educational}} design research concerning a learning <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>strategy</b> for cell biology in upper-secondary education introducing systems modelling {{as a key}} competence. The strategy consists of four modelling phases in which students subsequently develop models of freeliving cells, a general two-dimensional model of cells, a three-dimensional model of plant cells, and finally they are engaged in formal thinking by modelling life phenomena to a hierarchical systems model. The strategy was thought out, elaborated, and tested in classrooms in several research cycles. Throughout the field-tests, research data were collected by means of classroom observations, interviews, audio-taped discussions, completed worksheets, written tests, and questionnaires. Reflection on the research findings eventuated in reshaping and formalizing the learning <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>strategy,</b> which is presented here. The results show that although acquiring systems thinking competence at the metacognitive level needs more effort, our strategy contributed to improving learning outcomes; that is, acquisition of a coherent conceptual understanding of cell biology and acquisition of initial systems thinking competence, with modelling being the key activity...|$|R

50|$|Many {{classroom}} <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>strategies</b> draw {{on principles}} of social learning to enhance students' knowledge acquisition and retention. For example, using {{the technique of}} guided participation, a teacher says a phrase and asks the class to repeat the phrase. Thus, students both imitate and reproduce the teacher's action, aiding retention. An extension of guided participation is reciprocal learning, in which both student and teacher share responsibility in leading discussions. Additionally, teachers can shape the classroom behavior of students by modelling appropriate behavior and visibly rewarding students for good behavior. By emphasizing the teacher's role as model and encouraging the students to adopt the position of observer, the teacher can make knowledge and practices explicit to students, enhancing their learning outcomes.|$|E

50|$|The {{main feature}} that differentiates this {{approach}} from other learning <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>strategies</b> {{is that it}} recognises {{the value of the}} existing knowledge of the learner. Thus, through key questioning, the pupils are encouraged to construct their own models of what is being studied, their hypotheses, before testing them with real evidence and research. The key questions are used in a sequence that generally creates a context within the framework of a story. Together, learner and teacher create a scenario through visualisation; the making of collages, three-dimensional models and pictures employing a variety of art and craft techniques. These provide a visual stimulus for the skill-practice planned by the teacher. Even though the teacher is planning a sequence of activities through the designing of key questions, he or she does not know the details of the content, because these are created by the students.|$|E

Honors courses are designed to prepare students for AP exams in areas such as AP Statistics, AP Calculus and AP English Literature and Composition. These courses are only taught by AP-trained instructors. Textbook changes have recently gone into effect as the school has changed from the A Beka Book curriculum in all subject areas to a variety of both Christian and secular resources. High School English uses Purposeful Design textbooks from TextWord Press, and the middle school science curriculum is also from a Christian publisher. In Middle School English, Holt, Rinehart and Winston books are used in the classroom. Elementary recently changed to the Scott Foresman language arts textbooks. All levels use the [...] "History Alive" [...] textbook series in their history classrooms. Math textbooks are also from Holt, Rinehart and Winston. Religious instruction is taught in weekly chapel sessions with the students and in separate Bible credits that students are required to take.

Students of all backgrounds can benefit from being exposed to Indigenous education, as it can contribute to reducing racism in the classroom and increase the sense of community in a diverse group of students. [...] There are a number of sensitive issues about what can be taught (and by whom) that require responsible consideration by non-Indigenous teachers who appreciate the importance of interjecting Indigenous perspectives into standard mainstream schools. Concerns about misappropriation of Indigenous ways of knowing without recognizing the plight of Indigenous Peoples and [...] "giving back" [...] to them are legitimate. Since most educators are non-Indigenous, and because Indigenous perspectives may offer solutions for current and future social and ecological problems, it is important to refer to Indigenous educators and agencies to develop curriculum <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>strategies</b> {{while at the same time}} encouraging activism on behalf of Indigenous Peoples. One way to bring authentic Indigenous experiences into the classroom is to work with community elders. They can help facilitate the incorporation of authentic knowledge and experiences into the classroom. Teachers must not shy away from bringing controversial subjects into the classroom. The history of Indigenous people should be delved into and developed fully. [...] There are many age appropriate ways to do this, including the use of children's literature, media, and discussion. Individuals are recommended to reflect regularly on their teaching practice to become aware of areas of instruction in need of Indigenous perspectives.|$|E
