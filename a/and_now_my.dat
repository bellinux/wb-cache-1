500|$|In October 2009, {{the track}} was {{released}} as the album's buzz single, {{not intended to}} be the first release of Raymond v. Raymond, but to generate reception and feedback. In March 2010, Usher continued to support Garrett's original claims, stating the song was recorded before his marriage ended. Usher said in an interview for MTV News for promoting Raymond v. Raymond: [...] "I think people would have immediately alluded to the fact I was talking about my wife when I made that record — <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>my</b> ex-wife," [...] he said. [...] "When the song was recorded, I wasn't divorced. It was some reality in the contrast of trying to make it all work, having to balance a career and having a normal life. Coming in at 6 in the morning and arguing was a reality when you have those type of relationships. I felt that in a way, the story did touch on certain things at the time. I didn't know how realistic it would become. I didn't know I would become divorced. I did know it spoke on the contrast between trying to balance this world of being married and having this responsibility that's like a marriage at the same time. The song spoke to that place. Unfortunately, it did become a reality." ...|$|E

2500|$|Needing {{additional}} {{sources of}} finance to fund Birmingham's bid for immediate promotion {{back to the}} Football League First Division, the board approached Clifford Coombs, founder of home credit company S, for a loan. He agreed to put money into the club, but only if he could run it himself. He duly bought out the Morris family, promised to [...] "find all the money I can afford. My heart is in Birmingham City <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>my</b> pocket will be as well", became chairman in January 1966, and lured Stan Cullis, manager of Wolverhampton Wanderers in their glory days, out of retirement. Cullis's team played attractive football, and average attendance doubled between 1965–66 and 1967–68. Cullis led Birmingham to the semi-final of the League Cup in 1967, and in the 1967–68 FA Cup, they beat Arsenal and Chelsea in front of crowds in excess of 50,000 at St Andrew's before losing to West Bromwich Albion in the semi-final. Cup success was not restricted to the first team: the youth team reached {{the final of the}} FA Youth Cup in 1967, losing to what was described as an experienced Sunderland team. Fourth place in the division in 1967–68 and seventh in 1968–69 preceded a slump towards the bottom of the table, and Coombs decided {{it was time for a}} change. He persuaded Cullis back into retirement in March 1970, and approached top-class managers, including Brian Clough and Peter Taylor and Don Revie, without success, before appointing Freddie Goodwin of Brighton & Hove Albion manager.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the age of}} 20, Heshan Unamboowe was the {{youngest}} male athlete to compete on Sri Lanka's behalf at the London Games. He had not participated in any previous Summer Olympics. Unamboowe qualified for the games by using a universality place from the sport's governing body FINA because his fastest time of 57.47 seconds was 0.97 seconds slower than the [...] "B" [...] (FINA/Olympic Invitation Times) qualifying standard for his event, the men's 100 metre backstroke. The swimmer trained at Nunawading Swimming Club in Melbourne {{to prepare for the}} Olympics. Before the Games he said he was feeling [...] "excited" [...] but [...] "nervous" [...] and wanted to record a new personal best time: [...] "As a kid I used to watch all these world class swimmers at past Olympics games and I knew I could do something special, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>my</b> dream has come true." [...] Unamboowe was drawn in first heat on 29 July, finishing second out of three swimmers, with a time of 57.94 seconds. He finished ahead of Zane Jordan of Zambia (58.77 seconds) but behind heat winner Barbados's Bradley Ally (56.27 seconds). Unamboowe finished 42nd out of 43 competitors overall, and did not advance into the semi-final after finishing 3.42 seconds behind the slowest swimmer who made the later stages. After his participation ended, he spoke of an pre-existing shoulder injury that was aggravated and underwent physiotherapy upon finding this in his right shoulder: [...] "All I wanted initially was to better the Sri Lanka record. But that did not come my way as I could not keep the pace in the second half. I swam the first 50m well but could not accelerate in the last 50m." ...|$|E
