5|$|In the episode, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) meets {{one of her}} boss's, Jack Donaghy's (Alec Baldwin), friends, Gavin Volure (Martin), {{when the}} pair attend a dinner party. Gavin, after {{offering}} Jack a secret business opportunity, becomes enamored of Liz. Jack encourages the relationship until he discovers Gavin is not as successful as he claimed. Also, NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) invests his money in Gavin's business. Meanwhile, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) fears that his sons <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> kill him.|$|E
5|$|Later, when Rosier has an {{accident}} outside the village, he is rescued by the Romani, who treat the mayor with their traditional healing practices.

Walter's voice is heard on the tape, as is William Bell's. Both <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> calm little Olivia while she sits, huddled amidst a debris-strewn room of equipment. It becomes clear Olivia has caused this chaos in Walter and Bell's lab, presumably with her Cortexiphan-induced abilities.|$|E
5|$|While {{the global}} {{financial}} system is edging toward greater stability, governments must deal with differing regional or national needs. Some nations <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> orderly discontinue unconventional monetary policies installed to cultivate recovery, while others are expanding their scope and scale. Emerging market policymakers face a challenge of precision as they must carefully institute sustainable macroeconomic policies during extraordinary market sensitivity without provoking investors to retreat their capital to stronger markets. Nations' inability to align interests and achieve international consensus on matters such as banking regulation has perpetuated the risk of future global financial catastrophes.|$|E

5|$|Alphonse {{is one of}} {{the protagonists}} from the series {{alongside}} his older brother Edward. Alphonse loses his entire body while he and Edward <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> revive his mother Trisha using alchemy. Edward sacrifices his right arm to seal Alphonse's soul into a suit of armor. Edward later becomes an alchemist from the state military of Amestris, and starts traveling with Alphonse to search for a method to recover Alphonse's body. They seek the Philosopher's Stone, which would allow them to restore their physical forms. Besides being a powerful alchemist, Alphonse is a skilled hand-to-hand fighter; having been trained by Izumi Curtis. While Alphonse cannot feel anything because he has no body, he is nearly invincible as long as the blood mark made by Edward on his armor to contain his soul is not defaced.|$|E
5|$|At the FBI, Krycek confesses that Billy Miles {{is one of}} a {{new type}} of aliens that <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> wipe out humanity's ability to survive the invasion—including Scully's baby, which Krycek states is a special child that the aliens fear. Mulder tells Doggett to send for help. Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) arrives as Miles shows up at the J. Edgar Hoover Building. Scully is able to sneak out of the {{building}} with the help of Krycek, Doggett and Reyes. Mulder and Skinner, meanwhile, lead Miles to the roof, where Mulder pushes him off into a waiting garbage truck, which then compacts him. Scully and Reyes pull away. The episode ends with Agent Crane pointing them to safety, then turning around, revealing to the camera that he is a Super Soldier.|$|E

With his new partner, Emma Hollis, he finds himself struggling against the group's influence. Black is framed for the death of a fellow agent, prompting his resignation from the FBI and flight with Jordan to Washington D.C., and Hollis abandons him to work with the group. Several years later, Black works with FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) to foil a last-ditch effort by the group to orchestrate the end of the world; vindicated, he reunites with Jordan after the case.|$|E

5|$|In 2012 Syngenta bought Belgian RNAi firm Devgen for $522 {{million and}} Monsanto paid $29.2 {{million for the}} {{exclusive}} rights to intellectual property from Alnylam Pharmaceuticals. The International Potato Center in Lima, Peru is looking for genes to target in the sweet potato weevil, a beetle whose larvae ravage sweet potatoes globally. Other researchers <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> silence genes in ants, caterpillars and pollen beetles. Monsanto will likely be first to market, with a transgenic corn seed that expresses dsRNA based on gene Snf7 from the western corn rootworm, a beetle whose larvae annually cause one billion dollars in damage in the United States alone. A 2012 paper showed that silencing Snf7 stunts larval growth, killing them within days. In 2013 the same team showed that the RNA affects very few other species.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} during the preparations (May) for the Olympiad, Israel Gelfer (the Chairman of FIDE's Anti-cheating Committee) {{said that the}} issue of anti-cheating became important {{in the last couple of}} years, with the development of telecommunication technologies (mobile phones, watches and even glasses) that have caused a problem which cannot be ignored. Gelfer explained that they <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> balance between their will to fight against cheaters and at the same time not to create an unhealthy atmosphere in the chess world. The usual electronic scans before and after the game were of course prescribed, while novel procedures included: having a special anti-cheating arbiter (Klaus Deventer) with approximately 15 arbiters under his authority, one of whose charges was to carry out 30–40 checks during the round; and that players MUST inform their Match Arbiter when leaving the playing area.|$|E
5|$|Soldiers of {{the species}} Globitermes sulphureus commit suicide by autothysis– rupturing a large gland {{just beneath the surface}} of their cuticles. The thick, yellow fluid in the gland becomes very sticky on contact with the air, {{entangling}} ants or other insects which <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> invade the nest. Another termite, Neocapriterme taracua, also engages in suicidal defence. Workers physically unable to use their mandibles while in a fight form a pouch full of chemicals, then deliberately rupture themselves, releasing toxic chemicals that paralyse and kill their enemies. The soldiers of the neotropical termite family Serritermitidae have a defence strategy which involves front gland autothysis, with the body rupturing between the head and abdomen. When soldiers guarding nest entrances are attacked by intruders, they engage in autothysis, creating a block that denies entry to any attacker.|$|E

5|$|The San Diego {{chapter of}} JC's Girls {{is based at}} the Rock Church, a 10,000-member church with a {{majority}} of members {{under the age of}} 30. In the first year, several strippers left the sex industry and began volunteering with the chapter. Many of the chapter's members do not personally visit strip clubs but help in other ways. Scher said the former strippers were the most effective JC's Girls volunteers because they understand from personal experience the situations of the women they <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> help. By 2011, members of the San Diego chapter of JC's Girls were visiting strip clubs twice each month. They pray before, during, and after each visit and a team of other members pray for them from another location.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jon Vitti and {{directed}} by Rich Moore. Barney's apartment, which Homer spends the night in when he is kicked out by Marge, is partly based on an apartment Jim Reardon, Moore, {{and a few other}} animators of The Simpsons shared in college. One of the strip clubs Homer and Bart visit when they <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> find Princess Kashmir is based on the Seventh Veil Strip Club in Los Angeles, California. The staff went around Hollywood taking pictures of strip clubs so that they could get inspiration for the interior design of the strip club buildings in Springfield. The character designer designed over fifty different international showgirl costumes for the showgirls in the burlesque show sequence. Carl Carlson made his first appearance on The Simpsons in this episode.|$|E
5|$|The {{plants and}} animals which live on Solsbury Hill reflect the habitat {{provided}} by grassland overlying the limestone rock beneath. Specialist {{plants and animals}}, {{some of which are}} rare species, have adapted to the calcareous grassland. Most of the landscape is largely unaffected by agriculture as shown by the yellow meadow ant. Examples of plant species found include bird's foot trefoil, vetches, greater knapweed, harebells, yarrow (Achillea millefolium), and scabious. It is {{one of a series of}} flower-rich habitats, which Avon Wildlife Trust <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> link together. The plants attract a range of insects including: the six-spotted burnet moth, hummingbird hawk-moth and a number of butterflies including chalkhill blues. A small population of common buzzard (Buteo buteo) nest in the area. Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), badger and red fox are also seen. The skylark also nests on the hill.|$|E
