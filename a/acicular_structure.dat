An assessment of the free energy change involved in the austenite to bainite transformation assuming a plate-like nucleation shape for bainite gave an average characteristic length close to the observed from statistical length distributions. The kinetics of the transformation was modelled in the Avrami framework; both the diffusion controlled and the diffusionless growth hypothesis were considered in order to elucidate the mechanism underlying the austempering phase transformation. Results indicated that diffusion of C is the responsible of the nucleation process of the bainite sheaves, that appear as a consequence of a localized displacive transformation when the C concentration is adequate, but further growth of the bainite plates is almost suppressed.

Joints displaying similar quasi-static mechanical performance to conventional bolted joints were selected for detailed characterization. The mechanical performance was assessed on lap shear specimens, whereby the friction-riveted joints were connected with AA 2198 gussets. Two levels of energy input were used, resulting in process temperatures varying from 460 ± 130 °C to 758 ± 56 °C and fast cooling rates (178 ± 15 °C/s, 59 ± 15 °C/s).

Dynamic strain-aging phenomena were observed in Zircaloy at 200, 400, and 700 degrees C, and super-plastic deformation occurred at 850 and 1000 degrees C. An increase in the oxygen concentration in homogeneous Zircaloy-oxygen alloys increased the ultimate tensile strength and decreased the total strain, particularly below approximately 900 /sup 0 /C. In composite specimens with the ZrO 2 /alpha/beta structure, the total oxygen content {{had little effect on}} the ultimate tensile strength below approximately 1000 degrees C, but the strength increased with oxygen content at higher temperatures. Information on the effects of grain size, oxygen content, texture, and strain rate on the stress-strain behavior suggests that the dominant mechanism of super-plastic deformation in Zircaloy near approximately 850 /sup 0 /C is grain-boundary sliding at the alpha-beta interface with accommodation by diffusional creep, dislocation slip, and grain-boundary migration.

Mean Flow Stress was graphically represented against the inverse of temperature to characterize the evolution of austenite microstructure during rolling, which was also studied by optical microscopy and SEM on samples quenched from several temperatures. On the other hand, particles precipitated at different temperatures during rolling were analyzed by means of TEM using the carbon extraction replica technique and their size distribution and mean size were determined, {{as well as their}} morphology, nature and chemical composition. The effect of rolling temperature and austenite strengthening obtained at the end of thermomechanicalprocessing on final microstructure and precipitationstate was studied. Austenite strengthening was characterized by means of the parameter known as accumulated stress (Δσ). It was found that ferrite grains are finer and more equiaxed when the austenite is more severely deformed during finishing (higher values of Δσ) but lower values of Δσ generate a higher density of <b>acicular</b> <b>structures</b> after cooling, which should improve the balance of mechanical properties. The increase in strength associated to acicular ferrite compared to polygonal ferrite is revealed by the higher values of Vickers microhardness measured on samples corresponding to low Δσ.

40|$|A {{significant}} {{body of work}} exists around coke dissolution into liquid iron, however {{there are}} key aspects of this important reaction that are not well described. This study was focused on gaining {{the answers to the}} questions “How does the coke mineral matter behave during coke dissolution?” and “Can the effects of sulphur and oxide layer formation on the dissolution rate be separated and quantified?”. Issues that must be addressed if the understanding of the kinetics of this reaction is to be advanced and coke 2 ̆ 7 s use in the blast furnace further optimised. To this end, a detailed investigation was conducted examining the influence of coke mineral matter on coke (carbon) dissolution into liquid iron. This project was focused on the mineral matter layer that forms at the coke/iron interface and how the presence of this layer affects the kinetics of carbon dissolution from the coke into the liquid iron. A range of experimental techniques were used to identify and characterise the mineral layer as it formed at the coke/iron interface and to assess the layers influence on the carbon dissolution kinetics. Carbon dissolution experiments, utilising a carburiser cover technique, were carried out where carbon and sulphur transfer to an iron-carbon melt was measured over time at temperatures of 1450 °C, 1500 °C and 1550 °C. This technique allowed fundamental data on the dissolution rate constant to be calculated, and the effects of temperature, melt sulphur and different carbonaceous materials to be explored. Development of the mineral layer at the coke/iron interface as a function of both time and temperature was studied utilising a quenched carbon dissolution technique that was developed during the project. This technique had the additional benefit of allowing the composition of the melt to be determined for a larger range of elements than the dissolution experiments. The quenched carbon dissolution experiments complemented the carbon dissolution experiments and allowed direct comparisons between the dissolution behaviour measured in the dissolution experiments and the composition and morphology of the mineral layer observed in the quenched samples. The dissolution studies were further complemented by sessile drop measurements of the wetting behaviour of iron on the mineral phases that were identified in the mineral layer present at the coke/iron interface, thermodynamic modelling utilising the MTDATA software package and a conceptual model of the interfacial mineral layer. A mineral layer was observed to have formed at the coke/iron interface during coke dissolution into liquid iron at experimental temperatures ranging from 1450 °C to 1550 °C. The mineral layer was solid at these temperatures and persistent at the interface. The amount of mineral matter present in the mineral layer was observed to be increasing with increased reaction time. The composition and structure of the mineral layer changed with both experimental time and temperature. The composition of the mineral layer was principally composed of oxides of aluminium and calcium, present as various calcium aluminates and calcium sulphides. Initially the mineral layer was a loose agglomeration of particles of which a majority were alumina particles. As the dissolution reaction proceeded, the loose agglomeration of particles was replaced by an open acicular layer that was predominantly the calcium aluminate CaO. 6 Al 2 O 3 (CA 6). As the dissolution reaction continued further, the calcium aluminates became increasingly richer in calcium oxide, with the predominate phase present in the mineral layer progressing through the calcium aluminates phases CA 6 to CaO. 2 Al 2 O 3 (CA 2) and onto CaO. Al 2 O 3 (CA). The apparent calcium enrichment of the mineral layer was observed to occur more rapidly as the experimental temperature increased. Accompanying the compositional changes in the mineral layer, the morphology of the mineral layer was also observed to change. The mineral layer was formed as an initial loose agglomeration of alumina particles, changing to an open <b>acicular</b> <b>structure</b> consisting of CA 6 /CA 2 before being converted to a dense layer as the dissolution reaction proceeded and the composition of the mineral layer changed to CA and calcium sulphide (CaS) appeared at the interface. It was found that the formation of the calcium sulphide layer was preceded by the formation of the calcium aluminate layer. Only after the calcium aluminate layer had experienced progressive calcium enrichment and the CA and CA 2 phases had formed did the CaS phase appear at the iron interface. Thermodynamic analysis of the experimental results confirmed that the formation of the calcium enriched calcium aluminates, CA 2 and CA, were a necessary requirement to stabilise the calcium sulphide layer for the coke composition studied. The kinetics of carbon dissolution from the coke to the liquid iron were observed to be dependent on the structure of the interfacial mineral layer. This dependence was manifest as two stage behaviour in the first order mass transfer plots. The initial stage, characterised by rapid carbon dissolution, was observed while the mineral layer was developing or had the open <b>acicular</b> <b>structure</b> of the CA 6 /CA 2 layer. The second stage was characterised by a significant reduction in the rate of carbon dissolution. The onset of the second stage was coincident with the change in the composition of the mineral layer from CA 6 /CA 2 to CA 2 /CA and the associated densification of the mineral layer. In stating that the nature of the mineral layer affects the dissolution kinetics, a change in the reaction control mechanism is implied. This represents a change in the coke dissolution kinetics from simple mass transfer control to a mixed control regime where both mass transfer and the mineral (product) layer are active. In an attempt to overcome the problems associated with the heterogeneity of coke a coke analogue was developed. In the coke analogue the composition and dispersion of the carbonaceous and mineral matter (oxides) are controlled and the porosity is fixed. When single phase calcium aluminates were introduced into the coke analogues, calcium enrichment of the resulting calcium aluminate mineral layer was observed. The observed carbon dissolution kinetics were dependant on the structure of the interfacial calcium aluminate layer. Consistent with the coke dissolution studies, the calcium aluminate layer formed at the coke analogue iron interface during carbon dissolution was at least in part rate controlling the carbon dissolution reaction for the coke analogues studied. Utilising the sessile drop experimental technique the wettability with liquid ironcarbon-sulphur alloys of the predominate phases that were observed in the mineral layer were measured. It was observed that the contact angle decreased as the proportion of lime (CaO) in the calcium aluminate increased. Further it was observed that while the presence of sulphur in the melt increased the contact angle for the alumina and CA 6 substrates, on the CA 2 and CA substrates the contact angle was decreased. The improvement in the wetting of the CA 2 and CA substrates with sulphur was attributed to the formation of CaS at the substrate/droplet interface. This study has produced new fundamental data on the growth and development of the mineral layer and the wettability of the predominate calcium aluminates observed in the mineral layer. These detailed studies have illuminated the changing nature of the layer in terms of both composition and morphology and found that the kinetics of carbon dissolution from the coke to the liquid iron were dependant on the structure of the interfacial mineral layer...|$|E
40|$|The microstructure, phase {{composition}} and microhardness of rapidly solidified {{grey cast iron}} BS 1452 Grade 250 are compared against the conventionally solidified alloy. Powder samples were prepared using containerless processing via the drop-tube technique. The rapidly cooled droplets were collected and sieved into size range from ≥ 850 μm to ≤ 53 μm diameters corresponding to estimated rates of 200 - 23, 000 Ks- 1. Microstructure evaluations were made by optical and scanning electron microscopy, while XRD was used for identification and analysis of evolved phases. The control sample showed extensive graphite flake formation which was absent in virtually all the droplets samples. With decreasing particle size (increasing cooling rate) we observed {{an increase in the}} proportion of Fe 3 C present and the retention of γ-Fe in preference to α-Fe, with the proportion of retained austenite increasing with increasing cooling rate. At the highest cooling rates utilised a Martensitic or <b>acicular</b> ferrite <b>structure</b> was observed. Cooling rates of 200 Ks- 1 resulted in a doubling of the measured microhardness relative to the as-received (slowly cooled) material.

40|$|Three {{different}} microstructures, Widmanstatten <b>structure,</b> <b>acicular</b> martensite, and alpha-plates, {{have been}} produced through suitable heat treatments for alloy Ti- 6 Al- 2 Sn- 4 Zr- 2 Mo (0. 1 Si). The influence of these microstructures on pitting corrosion in 1 M NaBr solution has been studied using polarization technique. It is found that the parameters, pitting potential (E(pit)) and protection potential (E(pp)), are significantly influenced by the heat treatment conditions. E(pit) increases in the order alpha-plate < Widmanstatten <b>structure</b> < <b>acicular</b> martensite, while {{in the case of}} E(pp), the value increases in the order Widmanstatten structure < alpha-plates < acicular martensite. The poor E(pp) value in the case of Widmanstatten structure is attributed to the inherent variations in Mo and Al content between the plates accompanied by the formation of this phase...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work the {{influence}} of the nitrogen concentration of the gas atmosphere in the range of 0 - 25 % on the microstructure, hardness and cavitation erosion behavior of laser nitrided cp-Ti and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V has been investigated. The following conclusions are drawn. 1. The nature, volume fraction and distribution of the phases formed during laser nitriding are determined by the chemical composition of the alloy and by the nitrogen concentration of the gas atmosphere. Laser nitrided cp-Ti exhibits massive martensite <b>structure</b> and <b>acicular</b> martensite <b>structure</b> for nitrogen concentrations below and above 7 %, respectively. In contrast, the microstructure of laser nitrided Ti- 6 A 1 - 4 V changes from acicular martensite to a fine mixture of alpha-Ti and beta-Ti grains if the nitrogen concentration exceeds 5 %. For higher nitrogen concentrations in both Ti alloys the formation of globular and plate-shaped TiN 3 phase is observed. 2. The increase in hardness in the laser nitrided layers of both Ti alloys is mainly attributed to solid solution hardening of nitrogen dissolved in the Ti lattice. 3. The cavitation erosion resistance of both Ti alloys can be distinctly improved by laser nitriding. Optimal cavitation erosion resistance is already achieved by laser nitriding under gas atmospheres containing relatively little nitrogen (9 - 13 %) ...|$|R
40|$|Ti 6 Al 4 V {{titanium}} alloy is applied {{extensively in the}} aviation, aerospace, jet engine, and marine industries owing to its strength-to-weight ratio, excellent high-temperature properties and corrosion resistance. In order to extend the application range, investigations on welding characteristics of Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy using more welding methods are required. In the present study, Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy sheets were joined using resistance spot welding, and the weld nugget formation, mechanical properties (including tensile strength and hardness), and microstructure features of the resistance spot-welded joints were analyzed and evaluated. The visible indentations on the weld nugget surfaces caused by the electrode force and the surface expulsion were severe due to the high welding current. The weld nugget width at the sheets’ faying surface was mainly affected by the welding current and welding time, and the welded joint height at weld nugget center was chiefly associated with electrode force. The maximum tensile load of welded joint was up to 14. 3 kN in the pullout failure mode. The hardness of the weld nugget was the highest because of the coarse <b>acicular</b> α′ <b>structure,</b> and the hardness of the heat-affected zone increased {{in comparison to the}} base metal due to the transformation of the β phase to some fine acicular α′ phase...|$|R
40|$|Currently, the {{development}} of biomaterials has focused on having a low Young’s modulus, biocompatibility, corrosion resistance, and antibacterial properties. Ti–Nb alloys have higher research value due to their excellent corrosion resistance and low Young’s modulus. In recent years, the antibacterial properties of materials have been enhanced {{by the addition of}} Ag and Cu. Therefore, the corrosion resistance and antibacterial properties of the Ti– 12 Nb– 1 Ag alloy formulated in the current study were investigated and compared to those of commonly used Ti alloys, G 2 pure Ti (ASTM B 348 CP Grade 2), and Ti– 6 Al– 4 V, via electrochemical and E. coli antibacterial tests. Meanwhile, we also carried out a microstructural analysis to investigate the composition of the alloy. The results were as follows: (1) The electrochemical test demonstrated that Ti– 12 Nb– 1 Ag had a higher corrosion resistance than Ti– 6 Al– 4 V, which is similar to the properties of pure Ti. (2) The E. coli antibacterial test demonstrated that the sterilization rate of Ti– 12 Nb– 1 Ag was higher than that of the Ti– 6 Al– 4 V alloy and pure Ti. (3) The microstructural analysis revealed that Ti– 12 Nb– 1 Ag had an <b>acicular</b> martensite <b>structure,</b> with nano-Ag precipitates observed. Based on the results of the E. coli antibacterial test and the principles of sterilization of nano-precipitates and Ag, we inferred that the nano-Ag precipitates of Ti– 12 Nb– 1 Ag enhanced the antibacterial properties of the newly developed biomaterial, which is, namely, the Ti– 12 Nb– 1 Ag alloy...|$|R
