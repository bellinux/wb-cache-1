He {{also noted that the}} meat fruit was a favourite of Pierre Koffmann. Marina O'Loughlin visited the restaurant twice for the Metro newspaper, once just after opening and again several months later to compare how it had settled in. She thought it was a well-oiled operation, but <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> so, and questioned the originality of it as a version of the meat fruit had previously been available at the restaurant Amber in another Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Hong Kong and little touches as the years of origin which appear next to the menu items have been used before by Marco Pierre White. Jan Moir for The Daily Mail thought that the ice cream trolley was a sensation, along with the meat fruit, but could not understand the reason behind recreating the salamagundy dish.|$|E

500|$|While {{the game}} {{received}} high praise overall, certain publications voiced complaints. Hatfield {{noted that the}} cutscenes had low production values, stating that [...] "they don't have the polish {{of the rest of}} the game". The reviewer for PC Gamer mentioned [...] "a few minor, yet-to-be-patched bugs". Eduardo Reboucas of Game Revolution said that [...] "a lot of the levels in Super Meat Boy depend <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> on twitch reflexes and trial-and-error memorization". He also stated that [...] "there are some bits of toilet humor here and there that are duds", and that the game's high level of difficulty [...] "will make most casual players shy away". Mitchell Dyer of GamePro agreed, saying that certain [...] "absurdly difficult" [...] levels broke the flow of the game, especially in the boss levels and the later chapters.|$|E
500|$|Television Without Pity ranked [...] "Our Town" [...] {{the fifth}} most nightmare-inducing {{episode of the}} show. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five. The two wrote {{positively}} of Spotnitz juxtapositions, praising the idea to frame the themes around cannibalism. However, they wrote that [...] "Spotnitz pushes the metaphor too far", citing the ending scene as evidence. Shearman and Pearson also criticized both Bowman's directing, noting it lacked the flourishes to make [...] "Spotnitz' strange black comedy work", and Mark Snow's score. They noted that Snow was on [...] "autopilot" [...] and that his soundtrack was [...] "the same horn anthem he gives any character who's taken <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> from a tribal culture." [...] The two further criticized the series' use of the capture of Scully as a mechanism for Mulder to spring into action.|$|E
500|$|Gary Arnold of The Washington Times {{wrote that}} a number of factors [...] "fail to prevent the {{finished}} product from jamming and misfiring with disillusioning frequency". Arnold opined that [...] "demanding that he [...] play Bond's wrathfulness in a transparently seething and hotheaded manner" [...] means that Dalton [...] "seems to waste away on this second outing as Bond." [...] Overall Arnold sees that there is a [...] "failure to recognize that Bond productions are simply too extravagant to permit an uncompromised return to first principles." [...] The critic for The New York Times, Caryn James, thought Dalton was [...] "the first James Bond with angst, a moody spy for the fin de siecle", and that Licence to Kill [...] "retains its familiar, effective mix of despicably powerful villains, suspiciously tantalizing women and ever-wilder special effects", but was impressed that [...] "Dalton's glowering presence adds a darker tone". James concluded that [...] "for all its clever updatings, stylish action and witty escapism, Licence to Kill... is still <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> by the book." ...|$|E

Club graded {{the episode}} a B, stating [...] "I've been down on Family Guy {{recently}} for experimenting <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit <b>too</b> <b>much</b> with morality and form, but tonight's episode {{was the kind}} that I think it still does well. It's {{not as good as}} it was pre-cancellation, but there's a pleasant weirdness to it that makes me think {{that this is the way}} Family Guy should be.

500|$|Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{wrote that}} the episode [...] "was {{overflowing}} with manna from post-strike heaven: lots of action, lots of intrigue [...] the odd answer or three"; however, he criticized {{the deaths of the}} three 815 survivors played by extras and survival of main characters, saying that [...] "that sequence with Sawyer dodging bullets was supposed to be tense and frightening; instead, it was funny". [...] Kristin Dos Santos of E! agreed with Sepinwall's latter assessment. [...] Jamie Poniewozik of Time worried about the show's direction in which Widmore is suddenly the antagonist and Ben travels the globe to seek revenge. [...] He said that it [...] "looks <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> like Alias"; Poniewozik enjoyed the island drama. [...] Daniel of TMZ called [...] "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] "another solid episode of Lost", grading it as a [...] "B" [...] and claiming that [...] "I enjoyed it the whole way through, even if it never gave me that 'OH MY GOD!!!!' moment, though I loved the Alex execution scene." ...|$|E
500|$|Although the minigames and {{co-operative}} mode {{were considered}} interesting, the deathmatch mode was criticised for being [...] "slow and clunky". AllGame's McCall {{felt that it}} simply did not work due to the game's unusual manual targeting. Publications also claimed that the controls were complex and confusing. In a negative review, James Bottorff of The Cincinnati Enquirer explained that the control scheme is frustrating because players are required to change from using the analog stick to the C buttons of the Nintendo 64 controller when switching to combat mode. GameSpot said that the controls remain responsive at all times, but acknowledged that the alternation between the two control styles [...] "might prove distasteful to some". In a retrospective review, Andy Green of Nintendo Life stated that Jet Force Gemini is [...] "a really enjoyable game" [...] with [...] "its fair share of flaws that tend to hinder the experience <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> <b>much.</b> That being said, it's certainly an incredibly fun title, at its best, that will definitely raise a few smiles".|$|E
500|$|Maureen Ryan {{described}} the chemistry between Black and Michael Shanks as [...] "sparky" [...] and [...] "one {{of the most}} diverting parts of the latter seasons of the show". According to Ultimate DVD, the scenes between Vala and Daniel {{as the object of}} her affection resulted in [...] "some of the freshest and funniest scenes in the show for some time". In reviewing [...] "Unending", Anthony Brown called Vala [...] "a character who's always had <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of comic relief [...] torn apart by the nice guy of the team." [...] SyFy Portal attributed Stargate SG-1 not going stale after ten years to Black, as she [...] "quite literally steals the show from the existing cast of heroes". For her portrayal of Vala, Claudia Black was nominated for a Saturn Award in the category [...] "Best Supporting Actress on Television" [...] in 2006, and won a Constellation Award in the category [...] "Best Female Performance in a 2006 Science Fiction Television" [...] for the episode [...] "Memento Mori" [...] in 2007.|$|E
5000|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic said: [...] "Although {{it may be}} <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit <b>too</b> <b>much</b> {{for casual}} fans, Hits is an {{excellent}} set that contains all of Jimmy Barnes' hit singles, several album tracks, his hit duet with INXS, several B-sides {{and a handful of}} outtakes. For collectors, all of the rarities are worthwhile, even if they reveal no hidden gems. For less dedicated listeners, the rarities bog down the set slightly, but this remains the definitive overview of this blue-collar Australian rocker." ...|$|R

500|$|After this, Holst tackled {{his final}} attempt at opera in a cheerful vein, with The Wandering Scholar (1929–30), to a text by Clifford Bax. Imogen {{refers to the}} music as [...] "Holst at his best in a scherzando (playful) frame of mind"; Vaughan Williams commented on the lively, folksy rhythms: [...] "Do you think there's <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit <b>too</b> <b>much</b> 6/8 in the opera?" [...] Short observes that the opening motif makes several reappearances without being {{identified}} with a particular character, but imposes musical unity on the work.|$|R
500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly {{gave it a}} [...] "B–" [...] and {{concluded}} that, [...] "I did jump a few times, and I liked Haley's dour malevolence, but overall, the new Nightmare on Elm Street is a by-the-numbers bad dream that plays <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> like a corporately ordered rerun. One, two, Freddy's coming for you. Three, four, we've been there before". Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter criticized the acting calling it [...] "lethargically lifeless" [...] and criticized Haley's portrayal of Krueger, saying, [...] "Even with his electronically deepened voice and a pointless amount of backstory, there's just no replacing Englund". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 1 star out of 4, writing in his review, [...] "I stared at A Nightmare on Elm Street with weary resignation. The movie consists {{of a series of}} teenagers who are introduced, haunted by nightmares and then slashed to death by Freddy. So what? Are we supposed to be scared? Is the sudden clanging chord supposed to evoke a fearful Pavlovian response?".|$|E
500|$|J. Randy Taraborrelli, {{author of}} , commented that [...] "the steamrolling 'Hanky Panky' simply {{sounds like a}} silly {{innocent}} romp until you realize what she's {{going on and on}} is about ('Warren's favorite pastime')... being spanked!". The author also felt Madonna sang with [...] "just <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> authority". Academic Georges Claude Guilbert, author of Madonna As Postmodern Myth, called it [...] "a comic hymn to spanking". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic described it as a [...] "double entendre-laden hit". Music critic Robert Christgau highlighted [...] "Hanky Panky" [...] {{as one of the best}} tracks on I'm Breathless; calling it a [...] "fake period piece" [...] but praising its [...] "risqué s" [...] sound as [...] "all her". Rolling Stones Mark Coleman wrote that the song, alongside [...] "Cry Baby" [...] and [...] "I'm Going Bananas", was one of the [...] "more-legitimate sounding and confidently sung show tunes without a trace of disco" [...] on the album. He also noted that [...] "its titles alone are enough to conjure up visions of the elaborate production numbers on Madonna's summer tour." [...] People magazine called it a [...] "paean to kink". Billboards Keith Caulfield called it [...] "goofy (but catchy!)".|$|E
500|$|... "Candy Shop" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from music critics. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised it for capturing [...] "Pharrell Williams' flair for slim, sleek grooves" [...] and labelled it a highlight from Hard Candy. Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone, {{noted that the}} [...] "creative tension between Madonna and the Neptunes' Pharrell Williams crackles on the innuendo-laden opener 'Candy Shop'". Writing for Idolator, Bradley Stern criticized the lyrics but praised its catchiness, [...] "set to a nice, punchy beat, Madonna weaves her voice around a hypnotic groove that practically dares you not to sing along. [...] is all about letting loose {{and having a good}} time". He also opined that while it wouldn't work as a single [...] "it more than serves its purpose as an introduction to Hard Candy". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine wrote, [...] "Pharrell makes his presence known <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> [...] he manages to get Madonna to stretch vocally in ways she hasn't since Evita. That is, when she's not doing cheeky drag queen impersonations, with trannie-fierce moments sprinkled liberally throughout 'Candy Shop' (“My sugar is raw”) [...] The song is neither sexy nor campy, and somewhere, Dita is throwing her head back, laughing hysterically, and cracking her whip in disapproval", the last part being a reference to the alter ego Madonna incorporated for her fifth studio album, Erotica (1992).|$|E
5000|$|Of the {{creative}} process for his character, Josef, Duplass explained [...] "We {{were interested in the}} psychological profile of this very, very strange person. We were very interested in how you meet people and don’t quite understand what’s up, but you start to get signs. For us that was intense eye contact, lack of personal space, oversharing, maybe <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit <b>too</b> <b>much</b> love here and there. But, for me, there’s something wrong with both of these guys. Deeply. This concept of, 'who is the creep in this scenario?'" ...|$|R

60|$|Bessie cursed {{under her}} breath. She had pitied the man sincerely, had kissed him with almost equal sincerity, {{for he was}} not unhandsome; it pleased her {{to be in a}} way and for a time his protector, and above all there were four {{thousand}} pounds to be handled by some one. Now through a slip of the tongue and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> feminine desire to give <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> not <b>too</b> <b>much,</b> pain she had lost the money, the blessed idleness and the pretty things, the companionship, and the chance of looking outwardly as respectable as a real lady.|$|R

He was running pretty {{comfortable}} there, but not like he used to." [...] Baffert was proud of the horse's fighting effort, stating [...] "It was just guts." [...] Though Zayat talked of retiring the horse, Baffert said, [...] "We knew we were doing the impossible, shipping him back and forth." [...] The following day, Baffert said that American Pharoah was healthy and {{came out of the}} race in good shape. He said he had no regrets, stating, [...] "I'm glad I brought him. Racing needed something like this. He almost pulled it off." [...] Regarding Zayat's talk of retiring the horse, Baffert said, [...] "Mr. Zayat is a very emotional man. We were all pretty disappointed... I know (Zayat) will be going back and forth... He's a sportsman for bringing him up here." [...] Five days later, Zayat announced that the horse would be kept in training with the goal to run in the Breeders' Cup Classic, stating, [...] "I believe there were a combination of factors that prevented American Pharoah from running his absolute best... I have every confidence that he can run to his best again, and he deserves the chance to do so." ...|$|E
500|$|While Michael Cerveris has {{appeared}} as the Observer {{in the three}} previous episodes—and {{has appeared}} in every episode to date—his previous appearances had been brief background cameos. When initially cast for Fringe, Cerveris assumed he was a mere guest star, and that his character was [...] "one of several nuggets dropped in" [...] by J.J. Abrams {{in a manner similar}} to his other science fiction series, Lost. Cerveris soon discovered that his character was [...] "this sort of Where's Waldo thing (as) the linchpin in an overarching story of the series". He continued: Executive producer Jeff Pinkner commented, [...] "Our goal was to take a character who is by definition unknowable and make him someone you can connect to emotionally. He's more specifically connected with the overall character mythology of the show than we ever expected." [...] The decision to remove his eyebrows was made an hour before he first appeared, which caused stress in the make-up department because Cerveris would not shave his eyebrows; he commented about the affair, [...] "I've got <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> else going on, and who knows if they would ever grow back. I have little enough hair as it is." [...] "The Arrival" [...] was the first episode in which the Observer had dialogue, and the first in which he was treated as a focal character. In addition to Cerveris, actor Michael Kelly made a guest appearance in the episode.|$|E
500|$|According to Q magazine, Like a Virgin was {{the album}} that [...] "propelled [...] into the {{stratosphere}} – and rightly so. The songs are smart, funny, sexy and irresistible." [...] Taraborrelli said, [...] "It was Like a Virgin which reflected Madonna as a more versatile and artistic performer and vocals on this album being reflectively sharper in contrast to her early works in the music industry." [...] Michael Paoletta from Billboard commented that the songs on the album sustain a [...] "fevered dance-rock momentum". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic commented, [...] "Overall, the album adds up to less {{than the sum of}} its parts—partially because the singles are so good, but also because on the first album, she stunned with style and a certain joy. Here, the calculation is apparent, and while that's part of Madonna's essence—even something that makes her fun—it throws the record's balance off <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for it to be consistent, even if it justifiably made her a star." [...] Debby Miller from Rolling Stone preferred Madonna's debut album over Like a Virgin. In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau was also lukewarm towards the record, writing [...] " [...] so sure of herself she's asking men and women both to get the hots for the calculating bitch who sells the fantasy even while she bids for the sincerity market where long-term superstars ply their trade. And to make the music less mechanical, she's hired Nile Rodgers, who I won't blame for making it less catchy." ...|$|E
