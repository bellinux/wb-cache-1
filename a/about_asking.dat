Cap'n Andy has {{a chance}} meeting with Ravenal and {{arranges}} his reunion with Magnolia. Andy knows that Magnolia is retiring and returning to the Cotton Blossom with Kim, who has become a Broadway star. Kim gives her admirers a taste of her performing abilities by singing an updated, Charleston version of [...] "Why Do I Love You?" [...] Ravenal sings a reprise of [...] "You Are Love" [...] to the offstage Magnolia. Although he is uncertain <b>about</b> <b>asking</b> her to take him back, Magnolia, who has never stopped loving him, greets him warmly and does. As the happy couple walks up the boat's gangplank, Joe and the cast sing the last verse of [...] "Ol' Man River".|$|E
500|$|... "Pon de Replay" [...] is a dance-pop, dancehall and R {{song that}} infuses a reggae style. According to the digital music sheet {{published}} at musicnotes.com, {{the song is}} written in the key of F-sharp minor and is set in common time with a moderated dance groove, with a metronome of 100 beats per minute. Rihanna's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of F♯3 to the high note of C♯5. Lyrically, the song is <b>about</b> <b>asking</b> the DJ to play the protagonist's favorite song, {{as well as the}} fulfillment of dancing in a club. Doug Rule of Metro Weekly commented on the lyric [...] "Hey Mr. DJ, won't you turn the music up?" [...] and that it follows in the footsteps of recent songs which also incorporated [...] "Hey Mr. DJ", including Madonnas [...] "Music" [...] and Jennifer Lopezs [...] "Play".|$|E
500|$|On April 5, 2011, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi tweeted that The Path to Prosperity was [...] "a path {{to poverty}} for America's seniors and children". On April 13, 2011, {{speaking}} of Ryan's budget proposal, Obama said: [...] "I don't think there's anything courageous <b>about</b> <b>asking</b> for sacrifice {{from those who}} can least afford it. There's nothing serious about a plan that claims {{to reduce the deficit}} by spending a trillion dollars on tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires." [...] The House passed the Ryan plan on April 15, 2011, by a vote of 235–193. Four Republicans joined all House Democrats in voting against it. On an April 27, 2011, conference call with reporters Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said that passage of the Ryan plan [...] "would be {{one of the worst things}} to happen to this country". On May 25, 2011, the Ryan budget plan was defeated in the Senate.|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} {{produced}} by Falk and Yacoub, co-produced by Tuinfort and Ilya, with vocal production being done by Ilya, Kotecha and Yacoub. [...] "One Last Time" [...] is a dance-pop and EDM-light song, with a total length of three minutes and seventeen seconds (3:17). Its instrumentations consist in [...] "pummeling drums and a three-note synth line". [...] "One Last Time" [...] is written in the key of A-flat major, with a moderately fast tempo of 125 beats per minute. Grande's vocals range from F#3 to C6. Lyrically, the song is <b>about</b> <b>asking</b> a former lover to spend one last time with you, although he has already moved on and is with someone new. As noted by Jason Lipshut of Billboard, [...] "the downbeat admission of 'I know/that you got everything/But I got nothing here without you' is the pained sound of a narrator racked with guilt, the chorus sets aside that humiliation and scoops up a sense of hope," [...] with the singer pleading, [...] "One last time/I need {{to be the one}} who takes you home/One more time/I promise after that, I'll let you go". Rob Copsey of The Official Charts Company noted that the song [...] " [...] reminded him of Swedish's recording artist, Loreen's 2012 Eurovision winning song [...] "Euphoria".|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} develop Whitney's sexual abuse storyline, by March 2008 EastEnders {{researchers}} Libby Duplock and Cleo Bicat were {{in contact with the}} NSPCC's Tom Narducci, Jude Toasland, who deals with abused children, and Yvonne Traynor, CEO of the Rape and Sexual Abuse Support Centre. Duplock has stated that: [...] "One thing that was quite difficult for me to get right was the idea that she didn't want sex. It's Whitney's way of keeping Tony happy. If she lets him do it, then he's nicer to her and he makes her feel special." [...] Research highlighted the fact that 12% of abused children go on to become abusers in turn, however Duplock explained: [...] "We felt that to imply on TV that someone who has been abused {{is going to go on}} to abuse other people is not a message you want to give out. Those people have been through enough." [...] Narducci for the NSPCC stated that importance was placed on making children viewing the show [...] "feel comfortable <b>about</b> <b>asking</b> for help if they felt they needed it [...] for the wider community - to recognise the signs and let them know that they can do something about it. [...] We're not trying to cause a national panic. This is a responsible effort to try to get over an important story." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The story I am {{interested}} in is <b>about</b> <b>asking</b> what drives a powerful person—what makes them tick? How do they make and then remake themselves? I thought to myself, wouldn't it be great if—as this piece would be principally composed of clubby dance music—one could experience it in a club setting? Could one bring a 'story' {{and a kind of}} theatre to the disco? Was that possible? If so, wouldn’t that be amazing!" ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{week after}} Daytona, Waltrip interviewed NASCAR President Mike Helton for a pre-race segment during the {{broadcast}} at North Carolina Speedway (Rockingham). Waltrip believed that four {{deaths in the}} previous ten months, all caused by basilar skull fractures incurred in accidents, were too many, and was not shy <b>about</b> <b>asking</b> Helton for an explanation. Helton's responses irritated Waltrip, who was referred to by one magazine as [...] "acting a lot more like the next Mike Wallace (of 60 Minutes) than the next John Madden." ...|$|E
2500|$|Their {{second album}} The Reason was {{released}} in December 2003. The single Out of Control was made available for download on the band's website. Doug Robb said on the band's website: [...] "A {{lot of it is}} <b>about</b> <b>asking</b> questions or questioning all that people see. It's not all about religion. 'Out of Control' is about that and about opening your eyes after being blinded by being devoted to anything." [...] "Same Direction" [...] would reach No.9 on the US Modern Rock chart, No.16 on the Mainstream Rock chart and No.16 on a composite World Modern Rock chart (based on the US, Germany, Sweden, Finland, Canada, and Australia). A year later, the Let It Out DVD collected the band's videos. [...] "The Reason" [...] was put to a popular music video on Tangle.|$|E
2500|$|Willem Dafoe as [...] "He": Dafoe, who had {{previously}} worked with Lars von Trier in Manderlay from 2005, was cast after contacting Trier and asking what {{he was working on}} at the moment. He received the script for Antichrist, although he was told that Trier's wife was skeptical <b>about</b> <b>asking</b> a renowned actor like Dafoe to do such an extreme role. Dafoe accepted the part, later explaining its appeal to him: [...] "I think the dark stuff, the unspoken stuff is more potent for an actor. It's the stuff we don't talk about, so if you have the opportunity to apply yourself to that stuff in a playful, creative way, yes I'm attracted to it." [...] The voice of the talking fox was also supplied by Dafoe, although the recording was heavily manipulated.|$|E

2500|$|Within {{their first}} year at Columbia, the Stooges became very popular. Realizing this, Columbia Pictures {{president}} Harry Cohn used the Stooges as leverage, as the demand for their films {{was so great that}} he eventually refused to supply exhibitors with the trio's shorts unless they also agreed to book some of the studio's mediocre B movies. Cohn also saw to it that the Stooges remained ignorant of their popularity. During their 23 years at Columbia, the Stooges were never completely aware of their amazing drawing power at the box office. Their contracts with the studio included an open option that had to be renewed yearly, and Cohn would tell the boys that the short subjects were in decline, which was not a complete fabrication (Cohn's yearly mantra was [...] "the market for comedy shorts is dying out, fellas"). The Stooges thought that their days were numbered and would cruelly sweat it out each year, with Cohn renewing their contract at the eleventh hour. This deception kept the insecure Stooges unaware of their true value, resulting in them having second thoughts <b>about</b> <b>asking</b> for a better contract without a yearly option. Cohn's scare tactics worked for all 23 years that the Stooges were at Columbia; the team never once asked for a salary increasenor were they ever given one. It was not until after they stopped making the shorts in December 1957 that Moe learned of Cohn's underhanded tactics, what a valuable commodity the Stooges had been for the studio and how many millions more the act could have earned. Columbia offered theater owners an entire program of two-reel comedies (15-25 titles annually) featuring such stars as Buster Keaton, Andy Clyde, Charley Chase and Hugh Herbert, but the Stooge shorts were the most popular of all.|$|E
