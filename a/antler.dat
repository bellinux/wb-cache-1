5|$|Elk {{range in}} forest and forest-edge habitat, feeding on grasses, plants, leaves, and bark. Male elk have large antlers which are shed each year. Males also engage in ritualized mating {{behaviors}} during the rut, including posturing, <b>antler</b> wrestling (sparring), and bugling, a loud series of vocalizations that establishes dominance over other males and attracts females.|$|E
5|$|Other less {{satisfactory}} materials than horn {{have been}} used for the belly of the bow (the part facing the archer when shooting), including bone, <b>antler,</b> or compression-resistant woods such as osage orange, hornbeam, or yew. Materials that are strong under tension, such as silk, or tough wood, like hickory, {{have been used}} {{on the back of the}} bow (the part facing away from the archer when shooting).|$|E

50|$|When Island Company was started, <b>Antle</b> and {{his girlfriend}} drove from store to store selling the line of 13 bikinis from their car. When <b>Antle</b> {{and his girlfriend}} {{subsequently}} separated, <b>Antle</b> kept Island Company and added a men’s line and other new products. The line was soon picked up by destination resort shops in the Ritz Carlton and Four Seasons Hotels, starting a transition for Island Company to become a full lifestyle resort brand, beyond just a bikini line.|$|R
5000|$|In March, 2013 <b>Antle</b> {{launched}} Island Company's first concept store; Escape Travel Live at Atlantis Paradise Island, Bahamas. That {{same month}} <b>Antle</b> won the 2012-2013 [...] "Best Of Broadcast" [...] ADDY Awards for his film {{direction of the}} Island Company commercial; [...] "Never Return".|$|R
5|$|The {{details of}} {{manufacture}} {{varied between the}} various cultures that used them. Initially {{the tips of the}} limbs were made to bend when the bow was drawn. Later, the tips were stiffened with bone or <b>antler</b> laths; post-classical bows usually have stiff tips, known as siyahs, which are made {{as an integral part of}} the wooden core of the bow.|$|E
5|$|Throughout their range, {{they live}} in forest and in forest edge habitat, similar to other deer species. In mountainous regions, they often dwell at higher {{elevations}} in summer, migrating down slope for winter. The highly adaptable elk also inhabit semi-deserts in North America, such as the Great Basin. Manchurian and Alashan wapiti are primarily forest dwellers and their smaller <b>antler</b> size is a likely adaptation to a forest environment.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{their native}} habitat, elk and other deer species, {{especially}} white tails, {{were introduced in}} areas that previously had few if any large native ungulates. Brought to these countries for hunting and ranching for meat, hides and <b>antler</b> velvet, they have proven highly adaptable and have often had an adverse impact on local ecosystems. Elk and red deer were introduced to Argentina in the early 20th century. There they are now considered an invasive species, encroaching on Argentinian ecosystems where they compete for food with the indigenous Chilean huemul and other herbivores. This negative impact on native animal species has led the IUCN to identify the elk {{as one of the}} world's 100 worst invaders.|$|E

5|$|Pendants, ear-rings, bangles, discs and combs {{from the}} Neolithic period were found. 400 bone tools, mostly used for hunting, made from <b>antler</b> and long bones of deer and cattle {{were found in}} Chirand and at Burzahom from Period II and Period III. Terracotta figurines {{included}} humped bulls, birds, snakes, and human female figurines. The snake figures are indicative of existence of Naga cult among the Neolithic people. The human female figurines possibly relate to either a mother goddess, a goddess of fertility, or both. Ornaments made from tortoise and ivory were also found. A painted motif of the sacred peepal leaf (Ficus religiosa) was found. A foot stand of large sarcophagus indicates mortuary rites of the Neolithic people.|$|E
5|$|The Arctic {{small tool}} {{tradition}} {{is a broad}} cultural entity that developed along the Alaska Peninsula, around Bristol Bay, and on the eastern shores of the Bering Strait around 2,500BCE (4,500years ago). These Paleo-Arctic peoples had a highly distinctive toolkit of small blades (microblades) that were pointed at both ends and used as side- or end-barbs on arrows or spears made of other materials, such as bone or <b>antler.</b> Scrapers, engraving tools and adze blades were also included in their toolkits. The Arctic small tool tradition branches off into two cultural variants, including the Pre-Dorset, and the Independence traditions. These two groups, ancestors of Thule people, were displaced by the Inuit by 1000Common Era (CE).|$|E
5|$|The {{allometric}} exponent for sail {{height is}} similar in magnitude to the scaling of interspecific <b>antler</b> length to shoulder height in cervids. Furthermore, as Bakker (1970) observed {{in the context of}} Dimetrodon, many lizard species raise a dorsal ridge of skin during threat and courtship displays, and positively allometric, sexually dimorphic frills and dewlaps are present in extant lizards (Echelle et al. 1978; Christian et al. 1995). There is also evidence of sexual dimorphism both in the robustness of the skeleton and in the relative height of the spines of D. limbatus (Romer and Price 1940).|$|E

5|$|A re-think was required. Cook had the unenviable task of {{explaining}} {{the failure to}} the government. Henceforth, he would take a tighter grip on the hydrogen bomb programme, gradually superseding Penney. The scientists and politicians considered abandoning Green Granite. The Minister of Defence, Duncan Sandys, queried Cook on the imperative to persist with thermonuclear designs, given that Orange Herald satisfied most military requirements, and the tests were very expensive. Cook replied that megaton-range fission bombs represented an uneconomical use of expensive fissile material; {{that they could not}} be built to produce yields of more than a megaton; and that they could not be made small enough to be carried by aircraft smaller than the V-bombers, or on missiles. Sandys was not convinced, but he authorised further tests, as did the Prime Minister, now Harold Macmillan following Eden's resignation {{in the wake of the}} Suez crisis. The earliest possible date was November 1957 unless the Operation <b>Antler</b> tests were cancelled; but the Foreign Office warned that a moratorium on nuclear testing might come into effect in late October.|$|E
5|$|Adult elk usually stay in single-sex {{groups for}} most of the year. During the mating period known as the rut, mature bulls compete for the attentions of the cow elk and will try to defend females in their harem. Rival bulls {{challenge}} opponents by bellowing and by paralleling each other, walking back and forth. This allows potential combatants to assess the other's antlers, body size and fighting prowess. If neither bull backs down, they engage in <b>antler</b> wrestling, and bulls sometimes sustain serious injuries. Bulls also dig holes in the ground, in which they urinate and roll their body. A male elk's urethra points upward so that urine is sprayed almost at a right angle to the penis. The urine soaks into their hair and gives them a distinct smell which attracts cows.|$|E
5|$|Chronic wasting disease, {{transmitted}} by a misfolded protein {{known as a}} prion, affects the brain tissue in elk, and has been detected throughout their range in North America. First documented in the late 1960s in mule deer, the disease has affected elk on game farms and in the wild {{in a number of}} regions. Elk that have contracted the disease begin to show weight loss, increased watering needs, disorientation and listlessness, and at an advanced stage the disease leads to death. The disease is similar to but not the same as mad cow disease, and no risks to humans have been documented, nor has the disease been demonstrated to pose a threat to domesticated cattle. In 2002, South Korea banned the importation of elk <b>antler</b> velvet due to concerns about chronic wasting disease.|$|E

5|$|The {{morning of}} the {{evacuation}} promised a perfect day. The sun rose out of a calm and sparkling sea and warmed the impassive cliffs of Oiseval. The sky was hopelessly blue {{and the sight of}} Hirta, green and pleasant as the island of so many careless dreams, made parting all the more difficult. Observing tradition the islanders left an open Bible and a small pile of oats in each house, locked all the doors and at 7am boarded the Harebell. Although exhausted by the strain and hard work of the last few days, they were reported to have stayed cheerful throughout the operation. But as the long <b>antler</b> of Dun fell back onto the horizon and the familiar outline of the island grew faint, the severing of an ancient tie became a reality and the St Kildans gave way to tears.|$|E
