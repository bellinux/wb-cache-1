40|$|Anaesthetic eye drops for {{children}} in casualty departments across south east England It is a common practice to use topical <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>drops</b> to provide temporary relief and aid in {{the examination of the}} eyes when strong blepharospasm precludes thorough examination. Ophthalmology departments usually have several types of these—for example, amethocaine, oxybuprocaine (benoxinate), and proxymetacaine. The dura-tion and degree of discomfort caused by amethocaine is significantly higher than proxymetacaine, 1 2 whilst the difference in the discomfort between amethocaine and oxybuprocaine is minimal. 2 When dealing with children, therefore, it is recommended to use proxymetacaine drops. 1 It was my experience that Accident & Emergency (A&E) departments tend to have less choice of these drops. This survey was done to find out the availability of different <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>drops,</b> and the preference for paediatric use given a choice of the above three. Questionnaires were sent to 40 A&E departments across south east England. Thirty nine replied back, of which one department did not see any eye casualties. None of the 38 departments had proxymeta-caine. Twenty units had amethocaine alone and 10 units had oxybuprocaine alone. For paediatric use, these units were happy to use whatever drops were available within the unit. Eight units stocked amethocaine and oxybuprocaine, four of these were happy to use either of them on children and four used only oxybuprocaine. One of the latter pre-ferred proxymetacaine but had to contend with oxybuprocaine due to cost issues. Children are apprehensive about the instillation of any eye drops. Hence, it is desirable to use the least discomforting drops like proxymetacaine. For eye casualties, in majority of District General Hospitals, A&E departments are the first port of call. Hence, A&E units {{need to be aware of}} the benefit of proxymetacaine and stock them for paedia-tric use...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Screening {{examinations}} for {{retinopathy of prematurity}} (ROP) {{are performed}} routinely in the neonatal intensive care unit and are a recognised cause of pain in the newborn. OBJECTIVES: To {{determine the effect of}} instillation of topical <b>anaesthetic</b> eye <b>drops</b> compared with placebo or no treatment on pain in infants undergoing ROP screening. SEARCH STRATEGY: We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. This included a search of the Cochrane Neonatal Group register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 10, 2010). We identified relevant studies by searching the following: (1) computerised bibliographic databases: MEDLINE (1966 to October 2010), EMBASE (1988 to October 2010) and Web of Science (1975 to March 2010; (2) the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials. We searched electronically abstracts from PAS from 2000 to 2010 and handsearched abstracts from ESPR from 2000 to 2009. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised, or quasi-randomised controlled trials, or randomised cross-over trials. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. MAIN RESULTS: We identified two studies for inclusion. Both studies were randomised cross-over trials performed in single centres. Both studies used the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) score as a measure of pain response. Different methods of evaluating PIPP scores are presented including the absolute PIPP score, a PIPP score > 10 or > 12 and an increase in PIPP >/= 4 from the baseline value. There is a nonsignificant reduction in pain scores at one minute and a nonsignificant increase at five minutes post insertion of the speculum. PIPP score > 12 at one minute resulted in a statistically significant {{reduction in the number of}} patients who experienced pain (typical risk ratio (RR) 0. 56, 95 % CI 0. 36 to 0. 89; typical risk difference (RD) - 0. 23, 95 % CI - 0. 39 to - 0. 86; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 4). When pain was defined as an increase in PIPP > 4 there was a statistically significant reduction in the absolute number of patients who experienced pain at one minute (typical RR 0. 70, 95 % CI 0. 52 to 0. 94; typical RD - 0. 19, 95 % CI - 0. 34 to - 0. 04; NNTB 5. 3). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The administration of topical proparacaine 30 seconds prior to the ophthalmological evaluation was associated with a reduction in pain scores especially at the time of speculum insertion. However, despite treatment, screening remains a painful procedure and the role of nonpharmacological and pharmacological intervention including different local anaesthetic agents should be ascertained in future randomised trials...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction. By {{now it is}} a {{well-established}} fact that topical anaesthetics have an influence on IntraOcular pressure. The topical anaesthetic will give a lower intraocular pressure reading. As a follow-up to this, the aim of this study, is {{to find out if the}} topical anaesthetic will give a change in the mapping of the corneal topography. Material and methods. 26 eyes from 13 patients were measured in the study. The topographer used was the BON topographer and tonometry was performed with Icare. The topical anaesthetic used was Alcaine by Alcon. The following measurements were taken on each eye: 1. Corneal Topography immediately after blink, hereafter wet state c. t. 2. Corneal topography after 15 seconds without blink, hereafter dry state c. t. 3. IOP without topical anaesthetic, called IOP 1. 4. An interval of 5 to 10 minutes in order for the cornea to “stabilize” after tonometry. This was done to ensure that corneal biodynamics is not playing a role for the sequential measurements. 5. Topical <b>anaesthetics</b> administered, one <b>drop</b> in each eye and an interval of 1 minute was allowed before measurements were resumed. 6. Corneal topography immediately after blink, hereafter wet state an. c. t. 7. Corneal topography after 15 seconds without blink, hereafter dry state an. c. t. 8. IOP with topical anaesthetic, called IOP 2. Results. The statement in the introduction was confirmed when measuring IOP without and with topical anaesthetic. The IOP is lowered with 2 to 4 mm Hg with an anaesthetic. The change of corneal topography comparing topographies with and without anaesthetic in both wet and dry state was very small and will not have an influence on surgical outcome in refractive surgery. Conclusion. Refractive surgery as well as cataract surgery final outcomes will not be affected when using a topical anaesthetic. The change in corneal curvature is negligible...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} 20 {{years it has}} been {{realised}} that neonates, infants and children experience pain and considerable stress responses to surgical and medical procedures which are harmful and cause fear, anxiety and distress(Walker, 2008). This thesis will describe {{a body of work}} published since 1992 whose aim has been to improve several aspects of pain management for children in terms of both efficacy and safety. The studies encompass research into the four main classes of analgesics used in paediatric clinical practice, namely local anaesthetics, opioids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and paracetamol. In addition, control of the stress responses to tracheal intubation and to surgery has been studied with the availability of newer potent short-acting opioid agents and the anaesthetic agent propofol. The total body of work described covers 41 peer reviewed publications with 14 index papers selected for more detailed consideration. Local anaesthetics Several studies included in this thesis demonstrate the efficacy and safety of local anaesthetics in children. The optimum dose of the amide local anaesthetic, lignocaine, was determined for preventing pain on intravenous injection of propofol in children(Cameron et al., 1992) and this resulted in the widespread adoption of propofol as an induction agent. Several studies of propofol in children were conducted and this {{led to the development of}} more accurate computer-controlled delivery for maintenance of anaesthesia in children down to age 1 year(Morton et al., 1988, Marsh et al., 1990, Morton, 1990 a, Marsh et al., 1991, Doyle et al., 1993 c, Runcie et al., 1993, Morton, 1998 b, Varveris and Morton, 2002). Topical amethocaine (as a gel and as a phase-change patch) was evaluated in children(Doyle et al., 1993 a, Lawson et al., 1995, Lawson and Morton, 1998) and found to have a significantly more rapid onset of action than EMLA cream. This gel is now widely used in the UK. For nerve block, the efficacy and safety of fascia iliaca compartment block in children was demonstrated(Doyle et al., 1997) and the additional safety margin provided by adding the vasoconstrictor adrenaline to the local anaesthetic solution was proved by very low peak plasma concentrations of local anaesthetic. This was also demonstrated for caudal epidural blockade in infants(Hansen et al., 2001). New amide local anaesthetics were introduced in the last decade and ropivacaine was shown to be safe and effective for caudal epidural blockade in children(Ivani et al., 1998 a). A collaboration with Strathclyde University led to the development of a new micro-assay method for measurement of local anaesthetics in small volumes of plasma with applicability to neonatal age groups of patients where ethically allowable blood sampling volumes are very small(Stumpe et al., 2000). Opioids The technique of patient-controlled analgesia was studied in children with an open feasibility trial in 1990 (Lawrie et al., 1990) using conventional electronic syringe pumps and a further innovative study of a disposable elastomeric reservoir device in 1992 (Irwin et al., 1992). The optimum regimen for PCA in children was determined by a series of studies(Doyle et al., 1994 a, Doyle et al., 1993 d, Doyle et al., 1994 c, Munro et al., 2002) and a subsequent trial demonstrated that PCA could be delivered by the subcutaneous route(Doyle et al., 1994 b). A further collaboration with Strathclyde produced a microassay method for morphine and metabolites(Watson et al., 1995). These studies showed that PCA is very efficacious and safe for perioperative pain conrol in children from age 5 years upwards and this technique is now in routine use worldwide(Walker, 2008, APAGBI, 2008, Morton, 2007, Lonnqvist and Morton, 2005 b). NSAIDs and Paracetamol Following the demonstration of the utility of PCA in children, the technique was used to assess the analgesic efficacy of the NSAID diclofenac and paracetamol in children(Morton and O'Brien, 1999). This showed diclofenac to be particularly efficacious in producing a 40 % morphine-sparing effect in children. An innovative study of NSAID eye drops showed them to be as effective as local <b>anaesthetic</b> eye <b>drops</b> for providing analgesia after strabismus surgery in children(Morton et al., 1997). Dosing regimens for paracetamol have evolved in the last decade based on better information on developmental pharmacokinetics and elucidation of the mechanism of action(Arana et al., 2001, Ottani et al., 2006, Pickering et al., 2006, Anderson and Palmer, 2006). There is renewed interest in this decade with the availability of new IV formulations of this old drug. In 1999 (Hansen et al., 1999) we contributed to the PK data for paracetamol in neonates and infants which was subsequently used by authors from New Zealand to determine the population PK parameters in this young age group(Anderson and Palmer, 2006). We collated the knowledge on dosing regimens in 2001 in a review(Arana et al., 2001) which has informed the current recommendations in the BNFC. A further collaboration with Strathclyde University led to the development of a microassay for paracetamol and its metabolites from blood spots which has been taken up by Medecins Sans Frontieres as a possible method to use in the field in developing countries(Oliveira et al., 2002). The morphine-sparing efficacy of paracetamol was shown to be less than that due to diclofenac in the study mentioned above under NSAIDs(Morton and O'Brien, 1999). Controlling the stress response Noxious stimuli produce a stress response. A series of studies has shown that using short acting opioids, tracheal intubation could be safely performed without the aid of muscle relaxant drugs in children(Steyn et al., 1994, O'Brien et al., 1998, Robinson et al., 1998). This technique is now widely practiced. Two studies explored methods to reduce the stress response to open heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, one of the most potent surgical stressors. Propofol anaesthesia was shown to significantly ameliorate this response(Laycock et al., 1992) and the newer opioid remifentanil was shown to be as efficacious as the older drug fentanyl for this purpose(Bell et al., 2004). Audit, guidelines and protocols Two major analgesic techniques have been audited in large national projects looking at the risk of epidural infusions in children(Llewellyn and Moriarty, 2007) and opioid infusion techniques in children (Morton, 2008 c) and the results show these techniques to be of comparable safety. The evidence from the past 20 years has recently been synthesised into a clinical guideline for management of postoperative and procedural pain in children which has highlighted good practice based on high quality evidence but also revealed a paucity of evidence in some fields(APAGBI, 2008). Guidelines for safer paediatric procedural sedation practice is also described(SIGN, 2004, Playfor et al., 2006). The implementation of guidelines relies on the development of a local protocol and the evolution of the acute pain relief service protocol in Glasgow is described.
