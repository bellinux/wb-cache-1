5|$|In 1071, {{the year}} before his grandfather's death, Domnall and an Uí Chennselaig kinsman, Donnchad mac Domnaill Remair, battled for control of Leinster. Although Domnall is accorded the title King of Leinster in one mediaeval king-list, Donnchad was evidently <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> claimant, and Domnall appears to have held the Leinster kingship in name only.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, a {{modernization}} program was announced. Israeli defense contractor Elbit Systems {{was chosen to}} provide 3-axis gyro-stabilization, and most probably the L7A2 105 mm cannon will be replaced with <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> 120mm cannon, like the L44 120 mm Cannon. The first TAM unit upgraded by Elbit Systems was delivered in March 2013.|$|E
5|$|The Admiralty's 1905 draft {{building}} plan envisioned four battleships in the 1906–1907 Naval Programme, {{but the new}} Liberal government cut one of these ships in mid-1906. The Bellerophon-class design was a slightly larger and improved version of the revolutionary preceding , with better underwater protection and <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> secondary armament.|$|E

5|$|The Beckman team {{eventually}} developed additional models, {{as well as}} {{a number}} of accessories or attachments which could be used to modify the DU for different types of work. One of the first accessories was a flame attachment with <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> photo multiplier to enable the user to examine flames such as potassium, sodium and cesium (1947).|$|E
5|$|A {{day after}} the Australian range reveal and in the lead up to the Daytona 500 weekend, <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> and better {{equipped}} export version of the VF Commodore SS also made its debut in Daytona, Florida, as the MY14 Chevrolet SS. To maximise the SS's profile in the United States, GM also replaced in NASCAR the Chevrolet Impala with the SS, which races in Nascar's premier series through 2017..|$|E
5|$|Another {{feature of}} the ball is its rubber layer; it was {{designed}} to allow a better response while retaining the impact energy and releases it in the coup. Its support material of cross-linked nitrogen-expanded foam improves its retention and durability of its shape. Polyester support fabric enhances structure and stability. The asymmetrical high-contrast graphic around the ball creates an optimal flicker as the ball rotates for <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> visual signal, allowing the player to more easily identify and track the ball.|$|E

5|$|Construction of the Murrays' second mill, Decker Mill, {{had begun}} by 1801 {{to the east}} of Old Mill. It was the same height as Old Mill and doubled the size of the complex. Decker Mill was {{completed}} in time to exploit the economic boom in the cotton trade that followed the brief peace in the war with France from 1802–1803. During its construction, the steam engine was replaced <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> 40hp Boulton and Watt engine.|$|E
5|$|Elite Force {{includes}} {{an arsenal of}} Star Trek–themed weapons, such as phasers and disruptors. The weapons vary in power, ammunition consumption and effectiveness in given situations. Usually, the player {{is equipped with a}} hand phaser, a low-damage weapon that automatically recharges ammunition, and a phaser compression rifle, <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> weapon with an optional sniper mode for long distance kills. Other weapons, acquired as the game progresses, include grenade launchers, stasis weaponry and pulse energy weapons. The player can restock on ammunition by using wall-mounted terminals that dispense weapon energy, or by picking up certain items in the game environment.|$|E
5|$|Fear {{response}} in women during two {{different points in}} the menstrual cycle has been examined. When estrogen is highest in the preovulatory stage, women are significantly better at identifying expressions of fear than women who were menstruating, which is when estrogen levels are lowest. The women were equally able to identify happy faces, demonstrating that the fear response was <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> response. To summarize, menstrual cycle phase and the estrogen levels correlates with women’s fear processing.|$|E

5|$|For 1968, Austrian Jochen Rindt {{replaced}} Hulme, who {{had left}} to join McLaren. Repco produced <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> version of their V8 to maintain competitiveness against Ford's new Cosworth DFV, but it proved very unreliable. Slow communications between the UK and Australia had always made identifying and correcting problems very difficult. The car was fast—Rindt set pole position twice during the season—but Brabham and Rindt finished only three races between them, and ended the year with only ten points.|$|E
5|$|In the 1890s, the Austro-Hungarian Navy {{began to}} build armored cruisers to support the battle fleet and to perform some of the roles then {{reserved}} only for battleships. The first vessel, , was built as an enlarged version of the protected cruiser , with <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> armament and heavier armor. She was followed by an improved cruiser, , which {{provided the basis for}} an even larger ship, which was named Sankt Georg. Each iteration carried a heavier armament and had a higher top speed than the preceding design.|$|E
5|$|Like {{others of}} the Ealing comedies, Whisky Galore! explores {{the actions of a}} small insular group facing and {{overcoming}} <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> opponent. It was filmed on the island of Barra; the weather was so poor that the production over-ran its 10-week schedule by five weeks, and the film went £20,000 over budget. The initial cut of the film was considered poor by Michael Balcon, the head of the studio, so one of Ealing's directors, Charles Crichton, added additional footage and re-edited the film prior to its release.|$|E
40|$|For {{hypotheses}} concerning linear inequalities and k normal means, Berger (J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 84 (1989) 192 – 199) {{showed that}} the likelihood ratio test (LRT) is not very <b>powerful,</b> and uniformly <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> tests which reject in some extra regions can be constructed under some conditions. In this article, we study whether uniformly <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> tests of the form considered by Berger (1989) exist in some situations that {{are not covered by}} the results of Berger (1989). First, when the covariance matrix has a special structure which usually arises from the problem of comparing several treatments with a control, we show that there exists no such uniformly <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> test for k = 2, and there always exists such <b>a</b> uniformly <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> test for k ? 3. Secondly, when the common variance of the k independent normal populations is unknown, we again show the nonexistence of such <b>a</b> uniformly <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> test for k = 2, and the existence of such <b>a</b> uniformly <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> test for k ? 3. The method of proof can be applied to other situations, though it does not tell how to construct such <b>a</b> uniformly <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> test...|$|R

5|$|Pharmacologically active plant {{extracts}} {{can interact}} with conventional drugs, both {{because they may}} provide an increased dose of similar compounds, and because some phytochemicals interfere with the body's systems that metabolise drugs in the liver including the cytochrome P450 system, making the drugs last longer {{in the body and}} have <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> cumulative effect. Plant medicines can be dangerous during pregnancy. Since plants may contain many different substances, plant extracts may have complex effects on the human body.|$|E
5|$|Some {{teams had}} made {{modifications}} to their cars {{in preparation for}} the event. Honda introduced <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> version of its V10 engine for Saturday's qualifying session and the race. Sauber brought lighter components to reduce the weight of their cars and the Williams team arrived with a revised rear wing. Williams engine suppliers BMW confirmed that they would be running the same specification of engine introduced in Belgium.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{official}} {{tropical cyclone}} {{of the year}} was also previously unknown until contemporary reassessments. It exhibited some hybrid characteristics, and may have qualified for subtropical cyclone status according to the modern classification scheme. On September 15, the storm formed over the central Atlantic and initially moved westward. It gradually intensified as it turned northwestward, and on September 19 it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone southeast of New England. The system was subsequently absorbed by <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> frontal boundary approaching from the northwest.|$|E

5|$|Bruce is {{kept under}} {{observation}} at a secret desert base, while Talbot intends to weaponize the Hulk's powers. David tries to recreate Bruce's failed experiment, {{but instead of}} turning into another Hulk he finds himself able to absorb any material he touches or energy to which he is exposed. He hands himself over to the military after telling Betty that he had murdered his wife {{in front of the}} child Bruce. Bruce has a nightmare about the event, leading to <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> transformation of the Hulk. Talbot is killed in an explosion created when he attempted to use a special syringe to gain a sample of the creature. The Hulk escapes the base and rampages across the desert to San Francisco, battling Army forces sent after him. When Betty calms Bruce into his human form, General Ross realizes the Hulk is uncontrollable and that Bruce should be executed.|$|E
5|$|Each unit {{is governed}} by a {{character}} class system, with their class affecting what weapons they can use. After each action in battle gains experience points (EXP). Upon reaching 100 EXP, a unit levels up and its statistics such as attack power and defense are randomly raised, while weapon ranks increase naturally when using their respective weapons. Upon reaching Level 10, and using a special item, a unit's class can be upgraded to <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> version with access to new items and weapons. If a unit is defeated in battle, {{they are subject to}} permanent death, being removed from all future encounters and the overall storyline with a few exceptions for story-related characters. If characters crucial to the storyline like Lyn, Eliwood or Hector fall, the game ends and the player must restart the level.|$|E
5|$|Her uncle Ásmundr {{probably}} {{died in the}} Battle of Fýrisvellir, in the 980s, and it {{was probably}} {{at the side of}} king Eric the Victorious. Özurr had entered into the service of <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> liege and died for the Byzantine Emperor. Halfdan may have died either on Bornholm or in a holmgang, whereas where Kári died remains uncertain. The most likely interpretation may be that he died on Od, the old name for the north-western cape of Zealand, but {{it is also possible that}} it was at Dundee in Scotland. Búi's location of death is not given, but Larsson (2002) comments that it was probably in a way that was not considered as glorious as those of his brothers.|$|E
