5|$|When Tomoyo After was ported to the PlayStation 2 (PS2), {{improvements}} to the game were included. This edition's scenario was expanded by the original staff after {{the removal of the}} adult content consisting of sex scenes. Yūto Tonokawa wrote some of the additional story for Takafumi and Kanako. With the added scenario and visuals combined, the PS2 edition is 1.5 times longer than the Windows edition. In the original version, the entire cast excluding Tomoya Okazaki, had full voice acting; this was not changed for the PlayStation 2 version. Added support was included so as to make the visuals on the television sharper than in the past with visual novels played on a consumer console rather than on <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>screen.</b> The PS2 version also reduced flickering of the picture, reducing eyestrain.|$|E
25|$|The {{album cover}} was {{designed}} by Johnson/Panas (Trevor Johnson) with two separate photographs superimposed with <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>screen</b> effect. The hand-rendered lettering was based on typographer Wim Crouwel's Stedelijk Museum alphabet; the 1994 remaster used the design from a 1991 promotional poster with the typeface (Avenir) from the sleevenotes.|$|E
25|$|The {{story is}} {{primarily}} {{presented to the}} player via the voiceover of the game's narrator, who explains that the protagonist Stanley works in an office building, tasked to monitor data coming on <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>screen</b> and press buttons appropriately without question. One day that screen goes blank. Stanley, unsure what to do, starts to explore the building and finds it devoid of people.|$|E

25|$|Two PDF {{files that}} look similar on <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>screen</b> {{may be of}} very {{different}} sizes. For example, a high resolution raster image takes more space than a low resolution one. Typically higher resolution is needed for printing documents than for displaying them on screen. Other things that may {{increase the size of}} a file is embedding full fonts, especially for Asiatic scripts, and storing text as graphics.|$|E
25|$|The diffuse-light flash {{stimulus}} {{is rarely}} used nowadays {{due to the}} high variability within and across subjects. However, it is beneficial to use this type of stimulus when testing infants, animals or individuals with poor visual acuity. The checkerboard and grating patterns use light and dark squares and stripes, respectively. These squares and stripes are equal in size and are presented, one image at a time, via <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>screen.</b>|$|E

Schwartz's group created a BCI for three-dimensional tracking in virtual reality and also reproduced BCI control in a robotic arm. The same group also created headlines when they demonstrated that a monkey could feed itself pieces of fruit and marshmallows using a robotic arm controlled by the animal's own brain signals.|$|E
25|$|Online magic tricks were {{designed}} to function on <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>screen.</b> The computer essentially replaces the magician. Some online magic tricks recreate traditional card tricks and require user participation, while others, like Plato's Cursed Triangle, are based on mathematical, geometrical and/or optical illusions. One such online magic trick, called Esmeralda's Crystal Ball, became a viral phenomenon that fooled so many computer users into believing that their computer had supernatural powers, that Snopes dedicated a page to debunking the trick.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{models and}} {{computer}} models have partially complementary strengths and weaknesses. Physical models {{can be used}} by those without access to a computer and now can be made cheaply out of plastic materials. Their tactile and visual aspects cannot be easily reproduced by computers (although haptic devices have occasionally been built). On <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>screen,</b> the flexibility of molecules is also difficult to appreciate; illustrating the pseudorotation of cyclohexane {{is a good example of}} the value of mechanical models.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA tablet {{computer}} is {{considered as a}} useful tool for elderly people to improve their everyday life and even to have training to enhance their cognitive ability. In this study, the authors conducted a preliminary experiment to see how different background colors of <b>a</b> tablet <b>computer</b> <b>screen</b> can affect the attention of elderly people while they are performing a task on the {{tablet computer}}. Ten Japanese subjects over sixty-five years old performed circle-counting tasks on <b>a</b> tablet <b>computer</b> <b>screen</b> with white, blue and light blue backgrounds. For these three background colors, three different symbols including circles were presented in black, and the subjects were directed to count the number of circles {{in a short period of}} time. The average percentages of correct answers for the circle-counting tasks that the subjects performed were higher with the blue and light blue backgrounds than with the white background. These results suggest that white color may not be the best choice for a background color of <b>a</b> tablet <b>computer</b> <b>screen</b> for elderly people...|$|R
25|$|Graphics are visual presentations on a surface, such as <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>screen.</b> Examples are photographs, drawing, {{graphics}} designs, maps, engineering drawings, {{or other}} images. Graphics often combine text and illustration. Graphic design may consist of the deliberate selection, creation, or arrangement of typography alone, as in a brochure, flier, poster, web site, or book without any other element. Clarity or effective communication {{may be the}} objective, association with other cultural elements may be sought, or merely, {{the creation of a}} distinctive style.|$|E
25|$|A 30-year {{study at}} Kyoto University's Primate Research Institute {{has shown that}} chimps are able to learn to {{recognise}} the numbers 1 through 9 and their values. The chimps further show an aptitude for photographic memory, demonstrated in experiments in which the jumbled digits are flashed onto <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>screen</b> {{for less than a}} quarter of a second. One chimp, Ayumu, was able to correctly and quickly point to the positions where they appeared in ascending order. The same experiment was failed by human world memory champion Ben Pridmore on most attempts.|$|E
25|$|A {{controlled}} size comparison task can {{be employed}} to evaluate objectively whether a person is experiencing hemimicropsia. For each trial, a pair of horizontally aligned circles is presented on <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>screen,</b> and the person being tested is asked to decide which circle is larger. After a set of trials, the overall pattern of responses should display a normal distance effect where the more similar the two circles, the higher the number of errors. This test is able to effectively diagnose micropsia and confirm which hemisphere is being distorted.|$|E

25|$|In another, single-stimulus rehabilitatory approach, {{the patient}} is shown <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>screen</b> with a box in each corner and a {{fixation}} cross at the center. When a stimulus appears {{in any of the}} boxes, {{the patient is}} instructed to indicate seeing it as quickly as possible. This task is eased somewhat by an indicating icon before the stimulus – either an arrow that points to the box the stimulus is most likely (but not guaranteed) to be in, or a cross to indicate that the stimulus could appear in any box. Following thirty hour-long sessions, patients demonstrated a significant decrease in both extinction and hemispatial neglect.|$|E
25|$|Optical {{or light}} {{microscopy}} involves passing visible light transmitted through or reflected {{from the sample}} through a single lens or multiple lenses to allow a magnified view of the sample. The resulting image can be detected directly by the eye, imaged on a photographic plate, or captured digitally. The single lens with its attachments, or the system of lenses and imaging equipment, along with the appropriate lighting equipment, sample stage, and support, makes up the basic light microscope. The most recent development is the digital microscope, which uses a CCD camera {{to focus on the}} exhibit of interest. The image is shown on <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>screen,</b> so eye-pieces are unnecessary.|$|E
25|$|The {{examination}} is of 3 hours duration, {{and contains}} {{a total of}} 65 questions worth a maximum of 100 marks. From 2014 onward, the examination for all the papers is carried out in an online Computer Based Test (CBT) mode where the candidates are shown the questions in a random sequence on <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>screen.</b> The questions consist of both multiple choice questions (four answer options out of which the correct {{one has to be}} chosen) and numerical answer type questions (answer is a real number, to be entered via an on-screen keypad and computer mouse). Candidates are provided with scribble pads for rough work and these have to be returned after the examination. At the end of the 3-hour window, the computer automatically closes the screen from further actions.|$|E

25|$|The first beam was {{circulated}} {{through the}} collider {{on the morning}} of 10 September 2008. CERN successfully fired the protons around the tunnel in stages, three kilometres at a time. The particles were fired in a clockwise direction into the accelerator and successfully steered around it at 10:28 local time. The LHC successfully completed its major test: after a series of trial runs, two white dots flashed on <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>screen</b> showing the protons travelled the full length of the collider. It took less than one hour to guide the stream of particles around its inaugural circuit. CERN next successfully sent a beam of protons in an anticlockwise direction, taking slightly longer at one and a half hours due to a problem with the cryogenics, with the full circuit being completed at 14:59.|$|E
25|$|Until his sixties Tal {{appeared}} as a pianist and conductor with various orchestras, but his major contribution to the music world lies in his challenging compositions and his novel use of sonority. In the 1990s Tal conducted, together with Dr Shlomo Markel, a research project (Talmark) aimed at {{the development of a}} novel musical notation system in cooperation with the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, and VolkswagenStiftung. During these years his eyesight deteriorated due to macular degeneration and it became increasingly difficult for him to continue composing. Using <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>screen</b> to enlarge the music score, he managed to compose short musical works for few instruments, write his third autobiography, and complete his visionary analysis of future music. The complete cycle of his symphonies conducted by Israel Yinon was released on the German label CPO.|$|E
25|$|In film-screen radiography, an X-ray tube {{generates a}} beam of X-rays, which is aimed at the patient. The X-rays that pass through the patient are {{filtered}} through a device called an grid or X-ray filter, to reduce scatter, and strike an undeveloped film, which is held tightly to a screen of light-emitting phosphors in a light-tight cassette. The film is then developed chemically and an image appears on the film. Film-screen radiography is being replaced by phosphor plate radiography but more recently by digital radiography (DR) and the EOS imaging. In the two latest systems, the X-rays strike sensors that converts the signals generated into digital information, which is transmitted and converted into an image displayed on <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>screen.</b> In digital radiography the sensors shape a plate, but in the EOS system, which is a slot-scanning system, a linear sensor vertically scans the patient.|$|E
