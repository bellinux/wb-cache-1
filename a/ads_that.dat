5|$|His final {{re-election}} campaign came in 1990 against businessman Harry Lonsdale. Lonsdale aggressively went after Hatfield with television attack <b>ads</b> <b>that</b> attacked Hatfield {{as out of}} touch {{on issues such as}} abortion and timber management and accused the incumbent of being too closely allied with special interest groups in Washington. Lonsdale's tactics moved him even with, and then ahead of Hatfield in some polls. Hatfield, who had typically stayed above the fray of negative campaigning, was forced to respond in kind with attack ads of his own. He raised $1million in a single month after trailing Lonsdale in the polls before the November election. He defeated the Democrat with 590,095 (53.7percent) votes to 507,743 (46.2percent) votes.|$|E

25|$|Perception {{surrounding}} smoking has varied {{over time}} and {{from one place to}} another: holy and sinful, sophisticated and vulgar, a panacea and deadly health hazard. In the 20th century, smoking came to be viewed in a decidedly negative light, especially in Western countries. This is due to smoking tobacco being among the leading causes of many diseases such as lung cancer, heart attack, COPD, erectile dysfunction, and birth defects. The health hazards of smoking have caused many countries to institute high taxes on tobacco products, run ads to discourage use, limit <b>ads</b> <b>that</b> promote use, and provide help with quitting for those who do smoke.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, even though two-sided pricing {{strategies}} generally increase total platform profits compared to traditional one-sided strategies, the actual end {{value of the}} two-sided pricing strategy is contingent on market characteristics and may not offset the costs of implementation. For example, profits of an application provider increase {{with the implementation of}} a two-sided pricing strategy of the platform provider only if the application is subsidized by the provider. Platform providers should also be more cautious when the giveaway product has appreciable unit costs, as with tangible goods. Free-PC incurred $80M in losses in 1999 when it decided to give away computers and Internet access at no cost to consumers who agreed to view Internet-delivered <b>ads</b> <b>that</b> could not be minimized or hidden.

Other ads highlighted support for Democrat Hillary Clinton among Muslim women. The ads suggest that Russian operatives worked off of evolving lists of racial, religious, political and economic themes. They used these to create pages, write posts and craft <b>ads</b> <b>that</b> would appear in user’s news feeds—with the apparent goal of appealing to one audience and alienating another.

25|$|Several {{cases have}} {{wrestled}} {{with the concept of}} initial interest confusion. In Brookfield Commc'ns v. West Coast Ent'mt the court found initial interest confusion could occur when a competitor's trademarked terms were used in the HTML metatags of a website, resulting in that site appearing in the search results when a user searches on the trademarked term. In Playboy v. Netscape, the court found initial interest confusion when users typed in Playboy's trademarks into a search engine, resulting in the display of search results alongside unlabeled banner ads, triggered by keywords that included Playboy's marks, that would take users to Playboy's competitors. Though users might ultimately realize upon clicking on the banner <b>ads</b> <b>that</b> they were not Playboy-affiliated, the court found that the competitor advertisers could have gained customers by appropriating Playboy's goodwill since users may be perfectly happy to browse the competitor's site instead of returning to the search results to find the Playboy sites.|$|E
25|$|Davis was re-elected in the November 2002 general {{election}} following {{a long and}} bitter campaign against Simon, marked by accusations of ethical lapses {{on both sides and}} widespread voter apathy. Simon was also hurt by a financial fraud scandal that tarnished Simon's reputation. Davis' campaign touted California's improving test scores, environmental protection, health insurance coverage for children and lower prescription drug costs for seniors. Davis' campaign featured several negative <b>ads</b> <b>that</b> highlighted Simon's financial fraud scandal. The 2002 gubernatorial race was the most expensive in California state history with over $100 million spent. Davis' campaign was better financed; Davis had over $26 million in campaign reserves more than Simon in August 2002. Davis gained re-election with 47.4% of the vote to Simon's 42.4%. However, the Simon-Davis race led in the lowest turnout percentage in modern gubernatorial history, allowing a lower than normal amount of signatures required for a recall. Davis won the election, but the majority of voters disliked Davis and did not approve of his job performance.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} 2014 Lexus IS sports sedan {{launch in}} the US, Lexus partnered with NBCUniversal for the 'It's Your Move After Dark' campaign. The ads took {{advantage}} of real-time marketing by allowing viewers to contribute ad concepts via social networks to influence the creative for the Lexus advertisements. The campaign featured a series of live, improvisational short comedy <b>ads</b> <b>that</b> will run in the commercial pods during NBC's Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. The ads were based on real-time viewer social media submissions each Thursday and performed by New York's comedy troupes including Fun Young Guys, Magnet Theater Touring Company, MB's Dream and Stone Cold Fox. Every Thursday night for four weeks beginning 19 September, {{as part of an}} early commercial break on NBC's Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, improv comedians asked viewers to suggest ad concepts with the #LexusIS hashtag via social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr and Twitter. Submissions would influence the content of the ad and a live, on-air improve performance based on the viewer's ad suggestion will follow at the final commercial break. East and west coast live broadcasts of the commercials will be completely different each time based on their respective social media suggestions. Each Thursday's advertisement would be broadcast live from under the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City. In anticipation of the campaign launch, a 15-second promotional teaser was premiered on 18 September in NBC's late night programming commercial pods. Additionally, the selected comedic concepts and submissions were made be available for viewing and sharing on a custom page at NBC.com the day after each live broadcast. Fans can continue to engage in exclusive, behind-the-scenes content from the campaign on NBC.com.|$|E
