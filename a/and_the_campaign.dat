5|$|An {{extremely}} shy man, Etty rarely socialised {{and never}} married. From 1824 {{until his death}} {{he lived with his}} niece Betsy (Elizabeth Etty). Even in London he retained a keen interest in his native York, and was instrumental in the establishment of the town's first art school <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> to preserve York city walls. While he never formally converted from his Methodist faith, he was deeply attached to the Roman Catholic Church {{and was one of the}} few non-Catholics to attend the 1838 opening of Augustus Pugin's chapel for St Mary's College, Oscott.|$|E

5|$|Garnering a {{great degree}} of {{attention}} from the Mighty Ducks' fanbase, Kariya's first public practice at Arrowhead Pond drew an attendance of 9,000, while 16,000 fans watched his first exhibition game. Due to the NHL lockout, resulting from a dispute between players and owners, his regular season debut was delayed until January 1995 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> was shortened to 48 games. During the suspension, Kariya participated in a charity tournament held in Hamilton, Ontario, sponsored by the National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA).|$|E
5|$|Jackson reluctantly {{supported}} Al Gore when {{he became}} the Democratic presidential nominee, saying Gore and his running mate Joe Lieberman were not liberal enough but that he supported Gore as the only alternative to George W.

Jackson was still considered a likely appointee for United States Secretary of Education if Gore was elected.|$|E
5|$|Nagar was {{defeated}} by Mari in year seven of the Eblaite vizier Ibrium's term, causing the blockage of trade routes between Ebla and southern Mesopotamia via upper Mesopotamia. Later, Ebla's king Isar-Damu concluded an alliance with Nagar and Kish against Mari, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> was headed by the Eblaite vizier Ibbi-Sipish, who led the combined armies to victory in a battle near Terqa. Afterwards, the alliance attacked the rebellious Eblaite vassal city of Armi. Ebla was destroyed approximately three years after Terqa's battle, and soon after, Nagar followed in c. 2300 BC. Large {{parts of the city}} were burned, an act attributed either to Mari, or Sargon of Akkad.|$|E

5|$|Part of {{the reason}} for the inefficacy of the 1914 session was that McCreary was engaged in a {{three-way}} primary race for the Democratic nomination to the U.S. Senate. The other major candidates were former Governor Beckham and Augustus O. Stanley; a fourth candidate, David H. Smith, withdrew early from the race. McCreary ran a mostly positive campaign, touting his own accomplishments and speaking cordially about his opponents. Beckham and Stanley, however, were bitter political and personal enemies, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> reflected their animosity. Without the support of Beckham's political machine that had helped him in the gubernatorial contest, McCreary never had a realistic chance to win the nomination. Beckham secured the nomination with 72,677 votes to Stanley's 65,871 and McCreary's 20,257.|$|E
5|$|The Echo has won {{numerous}} accolades, as well {{as government}} praise, for its campaigning journalism, specialist writing, community work, photographic images and appeals for good causes over the decades. Examples of notable writing include a 2006 campaign highlighting {{the threat posed by}} bogus callers to the elderly and a 2005 campaign to protect 999 crews from being attacked on duty, which both received official praise in Parliament. A 1996 drug education campaign, which included the creation of a telephone service for tip-offs about suspected local drug dealers, was also highly praised. The Newspaper Society named the Echo as its Campaigning Newspaper of the Year for the Drug Busters drive, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> also won an award from the International Newspaper Marketing Association.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, a clear {{majority of}} the House of Representatives were pledged to Crittenden for the open Senate seat. However, Clay allies pressured Crittenden to step aside and allow Clay to be the Whig nominee. Crittenden obliged, and Clay was elected {{by a margin of}} nine votes over Richard M. Johnson. Crittenden went on to manage both the unsuccessful gubernatorial campaign of Richard Aylett Buckner <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> to help Clay win Kentucky in the 1832 presidential election. After Clay's defeat in 1832, he offered to resign his Senate seat and allow Crittenden to succeed him, but Crittenden refused the offer.

5|$|The game is set during World War II <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> mode is {{experienced}} through {{the perspectives of}} four soldiers: one in the Red Army, one in the United States Army, and two in the British Army. It contains four individual campaigns, split into three stories, {{with a total of}} twenty-seven missions. Activision officially announced the game on April 7, 2005 in a press release. Many features were added and changed from the original Call of Duty. The most notable change is the regenerating health. Additions include an icon that indicates a nearby grenade about to explode.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} three patches {{distributed}} since the game's initial release. The first patch for the game was released on October 21, 2010, while the second came out on October 28, and the third appeared on December 31, bringing the game to version 1.0.5. These updates improved such elements as gameplay, graphics, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> map. The developers also intended to expand ProtoGalaxy with new features and levels. A party celebrating the game's launch was held on October 15, 2010 at Memorial University. On February 25, 2011, Source Studio released Proto Defense, which enhanced the level editor and provided gamers with a new tower-defense-style level as downloadable content. On April 28, 2011, ProtoGalaxy was released on Impulse, another digital distribution platform.|$|E
5|$|From May 1945 {{aircraft}} of the USAAF's Fifth Air Force and Seventh Air Force, {{which were}} grouped under the Far East Air Force (FEAF), also attacked targets in Kyushu and western Honshu from bases in Okinawa and other {{locations in the}} Ryukyu Islands. These raids formed part of the preparation for the invasion of Japan. From 17May, P-47 Thunderbolt fighters flying from the Ryukyus made frequent day and night patrols over Kyushu to disrupt the Japanese air units there. On 21June an additional fighter group joined this effort, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> was reinforced by bombers and another fighter group from 1July. While these American operations were initially fiercely contested, from early July onwards they encountered little opposition as the Japanese aircraft were withdrawn {{so that they could}} be preserved for later operations. Between 1 and 13July, the Americans flew 286 medium and heavy bomber sorties over Kyushu without loss. As the fighters met few Japanese aircraft, they were mainly used to attack transportation infrastructure and targets of opportunity; these included at least two strafing attacks on groups of civilians.|$|E

Although not large, this group benefited from Shabib's tactical skill and inflicted {{a number of}} defeats on Umayyad forces. Advised by the general al-Jazl Uthman ibn Sa'id, Ibn al-Ash'ath pursued the Kharijites but displayed great caution {{in order to avoid}} falling into a trap. As a result, the governor of al-Mada'in, Uthman ibn Qatan, wrote to al-Hajjaj criticizing Ibn al-Ash'ath's leadership. Al-Hajjaj responded by giving command to Uthman, but when the latter attacked Shabib, the Umayyad army suffered a heavy defeat, losing around 900 men and fleeing to Kufa; Uthman himself was killed, while Ibn al-Ash'ath, who lost his horse, managed to escape {{with the help of a}} friend and reached Kufa after an eventful journey. There he remained in hiding until al-Hajjaj granted him pardon.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to external pressure, domestic policies {{implemented by the}} Vietnamese Government since 1975 had proven to be largely ineffective in stimulating the country’s economic growth. By building on the Soviet model of central economic planning, Vietnam placed most emphasis {{on the development of}} heavy industries, while production in agriculture and light manufacturing sectors stagnated. Furthermore, attempts to nationalise the economy of southern Vietnam after reunification only resulted in chaos, as economic output were driven down by dislocation of the general population. In {{addition to}} those failed economic policies, Vietnam maintained the fifth largest armed forces in the world, with 1.26 million regular soldiers under arms, 180,000 of whom were stationed in Cambodia in 1984. Consequently, the Vietnamese Government had to spend one-third of its budget on the military <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> in Kampuchea, despite receiving $1.2 billion in military aid annually from the Soviet Union, thus further hampering Vietnam’s economic rebuilding efforts.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} days of August 1995, NATO {{launched}} Operation Deliberate Force—an air campaign targeting the VRS. This campaign was launched in response to the second Markale massacre of 28 August, which came {{on the heels of the}} Srebrenica massacre. Airstrikes began on 30 August, initially targeting VRS air defences, and striking targets near Sarajevo. The campaign was briefly suspended on 1 September and its scope was expanded to target artillery and storage facilities around the city. The bombing resumed on 5 September, and its scope extended to VRS air defences near Banja Luka by 9 September as NATO had nearly exhausted its list of targets near Sarajevo. On 13 September, the Bosnian Serbs accepted NATO's demand for the establishment of an exclusion zone around Sarajevo <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> ceased.|$|E
