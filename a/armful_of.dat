500|$|A fireman named O. H. Bush {{and several}} other men crawled through a broken window of the {{farmhouse}} in search of survivors. When they determined {{that no one was}} in the house, they salvaged what furniture they could before the fire spread into the living room. Bush discovered dynamite in the corner; he picked up an <b>armful</b> <b>of</b> explosives and handed it to one of the men. As Kehoe left his burning farm and house in his Ford truck, he stopped to tell those fighting the fire, [...] "Boys, you're my friends. You better get out of here. You better head down to the school", and drove off.|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{after the}} badnjak {{has been brought}} in, or {{immediately}} before in some places, an <b>armful</b> <b>of</b> straw is spread over the floor. The straw is usually brought in with the same greetings and throwing of grain as the badnjak. The person spreading it may imitate a hen clucking to call her chicks, [...] "Kvo, kvo, kvo", with the family's children imitating chicks, [...] "Piju, piju, piju", while they pick at the straw. In Čečava, northern Bosnia, the children then {{lie down on the}} straw, before closing their eyes and picking a stalk with their lips: the child that picked the longest stalk will supposedly be the luckiest in the following year. In the Bay of Kotor, the ceremony is accompanied by the words [...] "Kuda slama, tuda slava"—"Whither straw, thither celebration." [...] A common custom is to scatter a handful of walnuts over the straw. It will be collected and taken out of the house {{on the morning of the}} second day after Christmas. Some of the straw may be set aside and used in apotropaic practices in the coming year.|$|E

2500|$|The Pigeon Detectives's {{performance}} was also memorable as frontman Matt Bowman informed {{the crowd that}} he was too clean and then asked if anyone in the audience had any mud or muddy trainers that they could throw at him. This request was readily carried out by the crowd. Bowman himself then proceeded to pick up an <b>armful</b> <b>of</b> mud from the stage and rubbed it over his head. Later he ran down to the crowd, inviting fans to rub his hair, whilst {{at the end of their}} popular single [...] "I'm Not Sorry", he jumped off the stage into the crowd. This performance left Stage 2/NME noticeably caked in mud for the rest of the festival.|$|E

60|$|Suddenly a very wave of {{fish was}} sent upon the shore, where, of course, {{they began to}} leap about wildly. Not less wildly did the Indians leap among them, {{throttling}} the big ones and hurling <b>armfuls</b> <b>of</b> the lesser ones {{high up on the}} sward.|$|R
60|$|Sewell smiled, {{and waited}} until Ingleby came back with an <b>armful</b> <b>of</b> wood.|$|E

60|$|He paddled {{them off}} to the boat. Coming back with some blankets, he cut a few <b>armfuls</b> <b>of</b> spruce twigs in a ravine and spread them out beside the fire. Then sitting down just clear of the scented smoke he lighted his pipe and asked an abrupt question.|$|R
50|$|Greenisland Primary School {{replaced}} {{a school}} in Trooperslane in 1938, when it was realised that children had to walk two miles to Trooperslane and back every day.

60|$|She {{went down}} to Ciccio where he was weeding <b>armfuls</b> <b>of</b> rose-red {{gladioli}} from the half-grown wheat, and cutting the lushness of the first weedy herbage. He threw down his sheaves of gladioli, and with his sickle began to cut the forest of bright yellow corn-marigolds. He looked intent, he seemed to work feverishly.|$|R
60|$|Here Randal was {{interrupted}} by Saul himself, who came in with an <b>armful</b> <b>of</b> wood for the fire.|$|E

60|$|Agatha {{held her}} hands up with one foot upon a spoke of the wheel as the man leaned down, and next moment she was {{strongly}} lifted and felt his supporting hand upon her waist.

50|$|It {{started in}} December 1984 with two locals, Murray Hardinge and Bob Thornhill, {{who had a}} passion for radio communication. A one-week {{broadcasting}} licence was going begging after an event planned for Healesville's contribution to Victoria's 150th Anniversary celebrations was abandoned. A hastily assembled crew stepped in, clutching <b>armfuls</b> <b>of</b> records, {{to take to the}} airwaves on equally hastily assembled home equipment - and Healesville Co-operative Broadcasters was born.|$|R
60|$|Next {{night the}} Woman cut great green <b>armfuls</b> <b>of</b> fresh grass from the water-meadows, and dried {{it before the}} fire, so that it smelt like new-mown hay, and {{she sat at the}} mouth of the Cave and plaited a halter out of horse-hide, and she looked at the {{shoulder}} of mutton-bone--at the big broad blade-bone--and she made a Magic. She made the Second Singing Magic in the world.|$|R

She lifted the wicker cover over the center stake and weighted it down with a few dry clods from the baked earth [...] ...|$|R
60|$|Aunt Hitty soon {{appeared}} {{in the kitchen with}} an <b>armful</b> <b>of</b> stockings, which, kneeling on the floor, she began counting and laying out.|$|E

60|$|From {{that point}} my {{memory of the}} action of that abominable fungus becomes confused. I {{remember}} vaguely that we declared our intention of standing no nonsense from any confounded insects, that we decided it ill became men to hide shamefully upon a mere satellite, that we equipped ourselves with huge <b>armfuls</b> <b>of</b> the fungus--whether for missile purposes or not I do not know--and, heedless of the stabs of the bayonet scrub, we started forth into the sunshine.|$|R
60|$|The girl {{noticed the}} swift orderliness {{of all he}} did as she watched him take out the horses and tether them, tear down <b>armfuls</b> <b>of</b> cedar-twigs, and then pack them between some flour-bag's and {{the side of the}} wagon, over which he {{stretched}} a strip of waterproof sheeting. Then he made a fire, disappeared into the mist, and coming back with the kettle, strode into the bush again. In the meanwhile Deringham, looking into the wagon, pointed to the twigs.|$|R
60|$|Seven trips she made, {{carrying}} <b>armfuls</b> <b>of</b> {{twigs and}} solemnly dragging large boughs behind her. She patted {{them down in}} front of all four wheels. Her crisp hands looked like the paws of a three-year-old boy making a mud fort. Her nails hurt from the mud wedged beneath them. Her mud-caked shoes were heavy to lift. It was with exquisite self-approval that she sat on the running-board, scraped a car-load of lignite off her soles, climbed back into the car, punched the starter.|$|R
