40|$|A {{comparative}} study in eight healthy normotensive males {{of the effects}} on blood pressure, heart rate and beta-adrenoceptor function following single oral doses of <b>adimolol</b> (600 mg), propranolol (240 mg) and placebo. Both active treatments produced small but significant reductions in blood pressure and heart rate, supine and erect. These effects persisted for up to 7 days after <b>adimolol.</b> The heart rate increases following both dynamic exercise and intravenous isoprenaline were attenuated by both propranolol and <b>adimolol.</b> With <b>adimolol</b> evidence of functional beta-adrenoceptor antagonism was sustained for up to 7 days. Lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptor binding studies showed that both <b>adimolol</b> and propranolol significantly reduced affinity for beta-adrenoceptors. In addition, <b>adimolol</b> significantly reduced receptor number and even by 3 days after dosing Bmax had only returned to half the control value. In a small sub-group of subjects {{there was no evidence}} to suggest that <b>adimolol</b> had additional alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist properties. <b>Adimolol</b> was detected in plasma for up to 3 days after dosing. The mean terminal elimination half-life was 14 h, compared to 3 h for propranolol. This study confirms that <b>adimolol</b> has prolonged beta-adrenoceptor antagonist activity with effects persisting for up to 7 days after a single dose. The reduction in beta-adrenoceptor number following <b>adimolol</b> suggests that this prolonged effect may not be solely due to competitive antagonism but may additionally depend upon non-competitive antagonism at beta-adrenoceptors...|$|E
40|$|The {{cardiovascular}} {{effects of}} <b>adimolol,</b> a new, potent, long acting beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug were investigated in three studies. In {{the first study}} blood pressure and heart rate were measured in five male volunteers before and at 2, 4, 6, 8, 24, 32, 48, 72 and 96 h after single oral doses of <b>adimolol.</b> All doses of <b>adimolol</b> reduced supine, standing and exercise heart rates in a dose dependent manner. The maximum effect ranged from 18 % following 25 mg to 29 % following 600 mg and all doses showed an effect at 96 h (range 3. 5 - 17. 2 %). In the second {{study the effects of}} <b>adimolol,</b> 25 and 400 mg, labetalol, 200 and 800 mg, propranolol 40 mg and placebo were compared on supine and standing heart rate and blood pressure and on exercise heart rate before and at 2, 4, 6 and 8 h after single oral doses. The exercise heart rate was significantly reduced at all times following <b>adimolol</b> 25 and 400 mg, labetalol 800 mg and propranolol 40 mg. At 2 h all the drugs significantly reduced standing systolic blood pressure. In the third study, 4 h after single oral doses of <b>adimolol</b> 400 mg, labetalol 400 mg and propranolol 40 mg six subjects received serial 4 min infusions of phenylephrine. The blood pressure was measured after each infusion. Labetalol 400 mg significantly shifted the blood pressure dose-response curve to the right. There was no difference between propranolol 40 mg and <b>adimolol</b> 400 mg. These studies show that <b>adimolol</b> is a potent, long acting beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug without evidence of alpha-adrenoceptor blockade in man...|$|E
