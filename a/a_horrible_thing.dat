His interviews are notable for their contribution to understanding the mind of serial killers, with FBI profiler John E. Douglas describing Kemper as [...] "among the brightest prison inmates" [...] he ever interviewed and capable of [...] "rare insight for a violent criminal." [...] Kemper is also forthcoming about the nature of his crimes and has said that he participated in the interviews to save others like himself from killing; stating {{at the end of his}} Murder: No Apparent Motive interview: [...] "There's somebody out there that is watching this and hasn't done that – hasn't killed people, and wants to, and rages inside and struggles with that feeling, or is so sure they have it under control. They need to talk to somebody about it. Trust somebody enough to sit down and talk about something that isn't a crime; thinking that way isn't a crime. Doing it isn't just a crime, it's <b>a</b> <b>horrible</b> <b>thing,</b> it doesn't know when to quit and it can't be stopped easily once it starts."

[...] In response to criticism of the remarks, Giuliani said, [...] "Some people thought it was racist—I thought that was a joke, since he was brought up by a white mother... This isn't racism. This is socialism or possibly anti-colonialism." [...] White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz said he agreed with Giuliani [...] "that it was <b>a</b> <b>horrible</b> <b>thing</b> to say", but said he would leave it up to the people who heard Giuliani directly to assess if the remarks were appropriate for the event.

2500|$|As one of {{the highest-ranking}} Catholics in the country, Catherine was an obvious target for Protestant extremists, and it was hardly {{surprising}} that the Popish Plot of 1678 would directly threaten her position. However, Catherine was completely secure in her husband's favour ("she could never do anything wicked, {{and it would be}} <b>a</b> <b>horrible</b> <b>thing</b> to abandon her" [...] he told Gilbert Burnet), and the House of Lords, most of whom knew her and liked her, refused by an overwhelming majority to impeach her.
