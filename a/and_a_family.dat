5|$|Until the {{discovery}} of a genetic test, statistics could only include clinical diagnosis based on physical symptoms <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> history of HD, excluding those who died of other causes before diagnosis. These cases can now be included in statistics; and, as the test becomes more widely available, estimates of the prevalence and incidence of the disorder are likely to increase.|$|E

5|$|About 99% of HD diagnoses {{based on}} the typical {{symptoms}} <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> history of the disease are confirmed by genetic testing to have the expanded trinucleotide repeat that causes HD. Most of the remaining are called HD-like (HDL) syndromes. The cause of most HDL diseases is unknown, but those with known causes are due to mutations in the prion protein gene (HDL1), the junctophilin 3 gene (HDL2), a recessively inherited unknown gene (HDL3—only found in two families and poorly understood), and the gene encoding the TATA box-binding protein (SCA17, sometimes called HDL4). Other autosomal dominant diseases that can be misdiagnosed as HD are dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy and neuroferritinopathy. There are also autosomal recessive disorders that resemble sporadic cases of HD. These include chorea acanthocytosis and pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. One X-linked disorder of this type is McLeod syndrome.|$|E
5|$|After Singora {{had been}} destroyed, Sultan Sulaiman's sons were pardoned and {{assigned}} to new positions in Siam. Later generations of Sultan Sulaiman's family were closely connected with Siamese royalty: two of Sulaiman's descendants commanded armed forces led by Prince Surasi in the 1786 conquest of Pattani; Princess Sri Sulalai, a consort of King Rama II {{and mother of}} King Rama III, was also descended from Sultan Sulaiman. Present-day descendants include Admiral Niphon Sirithorn, a former Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Thai Navy General Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, the 22nd Prime Minister of Thailand; <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> of silk weavers at the Muslim village of Phumriang in Surat Thani.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{researchers}} from Switzerland and the United States published a paper identifying the genetic cause of dominant white spotting in horses from the Franches Montagnes horse, Camarillo White Horse, Arabian horse and Thoroughbred breeds. Each of these dominant white conditions had occurred separately and spontaneously {{in the past}} 75 years, and each represents a different allele (variation or form) of the same gene. These same researchers identified a further seven unique causes of dominant white in 2009: three in distinct families of Thoroughbreds, one Icelandic horse, one Holsteiner, a large family of American Quarter Horses <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> of South German Draft horses.|$|E

A new movie theater <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> entertainment outlet, Z-Factor, also opened, Fowler said he was preparing new announcements including the opening of new restaurants on top of other established draws including a state-of-art gun range.|$|E
5|$|In April 2007, the leaking {{roof was}} repaired. In December 2007, the House {{received}} a $28,500 {{grant from the}} Dr. Scholl Foundation. The grant was used to complete lead-paint abatement, which would make conducting other restoration work safer. By 2010, the Dr. Scholl Foundation granted another $50,000 <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> foundation provided another $50,000 for the restoration. It was reported that other college grants totaling $15,500 were given for preservation planning, {{in part by the}} Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation. It was reported in May 2010 that a matching grant of $101,500 was given to Connecticut College from the Connecticut Commission on Culture and Tourism, which provided the funding for the next phase of renovations for restoring the House.|$|E
5|$|In October 1961, Nasser {{embarked}} on a major nationalization program for Egypt, believing the total adoption of socialism was the answer to his country's problems and would have prevented Syria's secession. In order to organize and solidify his popular base with Egypt's citizens and counter the army's influence, Nasser introduced the National Charter in 1962 and a new constitution. The charter called for universal health care, affordable housing, vocational schools, greater women's rights <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> planning program, as well as widening the Suez Canal.|$|E

5|$|MFP Baseball, which {{purchased}} the Sounds in early 2009, invested over $2million to make repairs and upgrades to the aging stadium's playing field, restrooms, concession stands, scoreboard, sound system, and seating. The infield was re-sodded and leveled, protective railing was installed {{along the edge}} of the field, and the backstop netting was replaced. The entire concourse and guitar scoreboard were repainted, broken seats were replaced, and Sluggers Sports Bar & Grill was remodeled. A permanent concert stage <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> fun zone were constructed by the concourse entrance.|$|E
5|$|People {{who have}} been charged with {{offences}} are tried either in the ACT Magistrates Court or for more severe offences, the ACT Supreme Court. Prior to its closure in 2009, prisoners were held in remand at the Belconnen Remand Centre in the ACT but usually gaoled in New South Wales. The Alexander Maconochie Centre was officially opened on 11 September 2008 by then Chief Minister Jon Stanhope. The total cost for construction was $130million. Courts such as a Small Claims Tribunal <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>Family</b> Court exist for civil law actions and other non-criminal legal matters.|$|E
5|$|Spontaneous pneumothoraces {{are divided}} into two types: primary, which occurs {{in the absence of}} known lung disease, and secondary, which occurs in someone with {{underlying}} lung disease. The cause of primary spontaneous pneumothorax is unknown, but established risk factors include male sex, smoking, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> history of pneumothorax. Smoking either cannabis or tobacco increases the risk. The various suspected underlying mechanisms are discussed below.|$|E

5|$|The {{tone of the}} Seattle {{campaign}} against Initiative Thirteen was different from those in Miami and St. Paul; it focused consistently on privacy and civil rights. Instead of educating the public about different subcultures in the gay community, they printed effective posters showing an eye peeping through a keyhole <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> living in a fishbowl. High-profile liberal figures, labor unions, and other large organizations including the Church Council of Greater Seattle opposed Initiative Thirteen. David Estes {{did not have the}} enthusiasm and momentum modeled by Bryant and other communities though his campaign used many of their tactics. On election day, Initiative Thirteen was rejected by 63%.|$|E
5|$|At one point, Nathan {{asks for}} Jodie's {{help with the}} condenser, which has broken open. After braving hostile {{entities}} from the Infraworld, Jodie manages {{to shut down the}} condenser and warns Nathan not to build another. This gets the attention of the CIA, who send agent Ryan Clayton (Eric Winter) to forcibly recruit Jodie. After training, the now-adult Jodie goes on multiple missions as a field agent, often with Ryan, to whom she slowly becomes attracted. On one such mission in Somalia, Jodie learns that the target she killed was not a warlord, but the country's benign president. An enraged Jodie flees in disgust, despite Ryan's pleas. Branded a traitor, Jodie becomes a fugitive, evading pursuing CIA forces. Along the way, she befriends a group of homeless people, one of whom she helps give birth, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> of Native Americans whom she saves from a malevolent entity. The CIA eventually recaptures Jodie after she attempts to reconnect with her catatonic biological mother, who has been held and forcibly drugged for decades in a military hospital.|$|E

5|$|The city {{is built}} on the slope {{surrounding}} the citadel, located on a dominating plateau. Although the city's walls {{were built in the}} third century and the city itself was first mentioned in the 12th century, the majority of the existing buildings date from 17th and 18th centuries. Typical houses consist of a tall stone block structure which can be up to five stories high. There are external and internal staircases that surround the house. It is thought that such design stems from fortified country houses typical in southern Albania. The lower storey of the building contains a cistern and the stable. The upper storey is composed of a guest room <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> room containing a fireplace. Further upper stories are to accommodate extended families and are connected by internal stairs. Since Gjirokastër's membership to UNESCO, a number of houses have been restored, though others continue to degrade.|$|E
5|$|The plot {{revolves}} around the lives of three close friends: Keong (Jack Neo), a spendthrift white-collar worker, Ong (Mark Lee), a general contractor, and Hui (Henry Thia), a kopi tiam waiter. After an argument with his boss (Chen Zhao Jin), Keong quits his job and is unable to get another due to his poor command of English, lack of academic qualifications and computer illiteracy. With bills (especially instalments) to pay <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> to support, he goes heavily into debt whereupon his wife leaves him, taking their daughter with her. Ong borrows S$40,000 from loan sharks, and plans to repay them after collecting a debt owed him by a friend who subsequently runs away. The loan sharks beat up Ong for not repaying the loan within the two-week deadline, so he flees to Johor Bahru. Hui, who is single and lives with his elderly mother, wastes his meagre salary on 4D and pursuing an insurance agent who he has a crush on.|$|E
5|$|The risk of VTE is {{increased}} in pregnancy by {{about five times}} because of a more hypercoagulable state, a likely adaptation against fatal postpartum hemorrhage. Additionally, pregnant women with genetic risk factors are subject to a roughly three to 30 times increased risk for VTE. Preventative treatments for pregnancy-related VTE in hypercoagulable women were suggested by the ACCP. Homozygous carriers of factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A with {{a family history of}} VTE were suggested for antepartum LMWH and either LMWH or a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) for the six weeks following childbirth. Those with another thrombophilia <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> history but no previous VTE were suggested for watchful waiting during pregnancy and LMWH or—for those without protein C or S deficiency—a VKA. Homozygous carriers of factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A with no personal or family history of VTE were suggested for watchful waiting during pregnancy and LMWH or a VKA for six weeks after childbirth. Those with another thrombophilia but no family or personal history of VTE were suggested for watchful waiting only. Warfarin, a common VKA, can cause harm to the fetus and is not used for VTE prevention during pregnancy.|$|E
