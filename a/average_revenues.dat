[...] These costs {{have continued to}} decline relative to revenues since 2004. The 2007 study indicated that, for 168 companies with <b>average</b> <b>revenues</b> of $4.7 billion, the average compliance costs were $1.7 million (0.036% of revenue). The 2006 study indicated that, for 200 companies with <b>average</b> <b>revenues</b> of $6.8 billion, the average compliance costs were $2.9 million (0.043% of revenue), down 23% from 2005. [...] Cost for decentralized companies (i.e., those with multiple segments or divisions) were considerably more than centralized companies. [...] Survey scores related to {{the positive effect of}} SOX on investor confidence, reliability of financial statements, and fraud prevention continue to rise. [...] However, when asked in 2006 whether the benefits of compliance with Section 404 have exceeded costs in 2006, only 22 percent agreed.|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{engages in}} impact of budgetary allocation amendment, effective from 1 st January 2013, on revenues of municipalities.

Supposing that the revenues of these municipalities have risen, I want to further verify the effect on <b>average</b> <b>revenues</b> of small and large municipalities.

40|$|An {{increase}} in fuel taxes is often {{connected with the}} hypothesis of a triple dividend: Apart from the modal-shift-effect, which relieves the environment {{as well as the}} infrastructure, and the fiscal effect, which should increase the public revenue, the movement of passengers to public transport systems should decrease its deficit. However, this calculation fails because higher fuel prices increase peak-hour transit use but not leisure or off-peak transit. But the typical attribute of peak traffic is above-average marginal costs and below <b>average</b> <b>revenues.</b> Therefore, higher fuel taxes will increase public transport's deficit rather than decrease it. The fiscal lucrativeness of higher fuel taxes will be significantly lower than is often expected. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{establishment}} of a flat rate for the taxicab service that serves routes between the city and the airport in Seville. First, {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} a flat rate are explained and why it may be an advisable measure for tourist cities with a conflictive taxicab industry. In addition, by using a methodology based on the estimation of average treatment effects, an evaluation is made of the impact of the taxi flat rate on the probability of passengers choosing a taxi for their city-airport transport needs. The main conclusion is that the increased market transparency fostered by this urban transport policy has led to an increase of almost 7 per cent in both the probability of selection and the <b>average</b> <b>revenues</b> of taxi-drivers. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} profit-maximizing nonlinear pricing by a {{firm that}} is subject to price cap regulation. Two forms of regulatory constraint are considered: (1) a cap on the firm's <b>average</b> <b>revenue,</b> and (2) a constraint that the firm must continue to offer each consumer the option of buying at the uniform price. Optimal nonlinear price schedules in these regimes are shown to have simple characterizations {{that are related to}} the nonlinear tariffs that an unregulated monopolist would charge. Of the regulatory regimes, the firm prefers the <b>average</b> <b>revenue</b> constraint to the option constraint and likes uniform pricing least. Consumers in aggregate prefer the option regime to uniform pricing and like the <b>average</b> <b>revenue</b> constraint least, but there are also distributional effects between consumers. Although the optional tariff regime Pareto dominates uniform pricing, it is ambiguous whether welfare is higher under uniform pricing or under the <b>average</b> <b>revenue</b> regime. An example is used to illustrate the nature of the ambiguity...|$|R

However, this approach incurs a very high time complexity and also suffers from poor performance. Cheng et al. [10] leveraged Markov random walk theory and proposed NodeRank, similar to PageRank which serves as the core algorithm of Google’s web searching. The benefit of this algorithm lies in that it incorporates the topology attribute into the VN embedding algorithm.|$|E

Organizations have used various strategies to link farmers to markets. These approaches have mainly been evaluated for their potential to increase participation in markets and household incomes. The evaluations have assumed a unitary household where income and resources are pooled and allocated according to a joint utility function. In most households, however, income is rarely pooled and neither are resources jointly allocated. This article uses data from Malawi and Uganda to analyze what influences income distribution between men and women, focusing on the type of commodity, type of market and approaches used.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} impact of {{intermittent}} wind generation on hourly equilibrium prices and output, using data on expected wind generation capacity and demand for 2020. Hourly wind data for the period 1993 - 2005 are used to obtain wind output generation profiles for thirty regions (onshore and offshore) across Great Britain. Matching the wind profiles for each month to the actual hourly demand (scaled to possible 2020 values), {{we find that the}} volatility of prices will increase, and that there is significant year-to-year variation in generators ’ profits. Above-average wind speeds lead to below-average prices, but annual revenues for British wind generators (producing more in the winter) are almost as great as for base load generators. In the presence of significant market power (the equivalent of two symmetric firms 2 owning fossil-fuelled capacity, rather than six), the level of prices more than doubled, and their volatility increased.
