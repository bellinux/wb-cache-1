50|$|Uromyces viciae-fabae var. viciae-fabae is a plant {{pathogen}} {{commonly known as}} Faba-bean rust. The rust is distinguished by the typical rust- like marks on the stem and leaves, causing defoliation and loss of photosynthetic surface along with reduction in yield. The disease is fungal and is <b>autoecious</b> meaning it has one plant host. The rust of faba beans is macrocyclic, or contains 5 spores during its life cycle.|$|E
50|$|Rust fungi {{can also}} be {{categorized}} by their life cycle. Three basic types of life cycles are recognized {{based on the number}} of spore states as macrocyclic, demicyclic, and microcyclic. The macrocyclic life cycle has all spore states, the demicyclic lacks the uredinial state, and the microcyclic cycle lacks the basidial, pycnial, and the aecial states, thus possess only uredinial and telia. Spermagonia may be absent from each type but especially the microcyclic life cycle. In macrocyclic and demicyclic life cycles, the rust may be either host alternating (heteroecious), i.e., the aecial state is on one kind of plant but the telial state on a different and unrelated plant, or non-host alternating (<b>autoecious),</b> i.e., the aecial and telial states on the same kind of plant.Heteroecious rust fungi require two unrelated hosts to complete their life cycle, with the primary host being infected by aeciospores and the alternate host being infected with basidiospores. This can be contrasted with an <b>autoecious</b> fungus which can complete its life cycle on a single host species.|$|E
50|$|Rust fungi can be {{categorized}} by how many types of spores are produced during the life cycle. Fungi that produce all five spores (sometimes excluding pycniospores) are termed macrocyclic. Fungi that lack pycniospores and aeciospores in their life cycle are termed microcyclic and always have an <b>autoecious</b> life cycle. Demicyclic fungi delete the uredial (repeating) stage from the life cycle. Understanding the life cycles of rust fungi allows for proper disease management.|$|E
50|$|A {{heteroecious}} parasite is {{one that}} requires at least two hosts. The primary host is the host in which the parasite spends its adult life; {{the other is the}} secondary host.

5000|$|While the {{predominant}} {{hypothesis is that}} H. vastatrix is heteroecious, completing its life cycle on an alternate host plant which {{has not yet been}} found, an alternative hypothesis is that H. vastatrix actually represents an early-diverging <b>autoecious</b> rust, in which the teliospores are non-functional and vestigial, and the sexual life cycle is completed by the urediniospores. Hidden meiosis and sexual reproduction (cryptosexuality) has been found within the generally asexual urediniospores.

50|$|Pine-pine gall rust, {{also known}} as western gall rust, is a fungal disease of pine trees. This plant disease is caused by Endocronartium harknessii (asexual name is Peridermium harknessii), an <b>autoecious,</b> endocyclic, rust fungus that grows in the {{vascular}} cambium of the host. Pine-pine gall rust is found on pine trees (Pinus spp.) {{with two or three}} needles such as ponderosa pine, jack pine, and scots pine. The disease is very similar to pine-oak gall rust, but its second host is another Pinus species. The fungal infection results in gall formation on branches or trunks of infected hosts. Gall formation is typically not detrimental to old trees but has been known to kill younger less stable saplings. Galls can vary from small growths on branch extremities to grapefruit sized galls on trunks.|$|E
5000|$|Chrysomyxa weirii, {{commonly}} known as Weir’s cushion rust, is a disease of spruce trees. It is mostly a cosmetic problem, causing yellowish spotting and banding on spruce needles, {{but in some cases}} can cause severe premature defoliation. [...] Weir’s cushion rust can also disfigure and reduce growth of spruce trees by targeting the tender needles of newly emerging shoots. [...] This disease is spread by wind and water splash and can further infect the spruce it currently resides on, or a neighboring spruce. [...] Unlike other rust diseases, C. weirii is <b>autoecious,</b> only infecting spruce trees. [...] C. weirii is also microcyclic, producing only two of the five possible spore stages common in rust fungi. [...] Trees affected by Weir’s cushion rust usually have obvious symptoms, but if treated correctly, the disease can be managed.|$|E
50|$|The {{hosts of}} the aecial {{stage of the}} fungus {{includes}} two and three needled Pinus spp. The most important aecial hosts include jack pine (P. banksiana), lodgepole pine (P. contorta), western yellow pine (P. ponderosa), and the European Scots pine (P. sylvestris). A variety of other pines, such as Pinus nigra, P. mugo, P. palustris, P. banksiana, P. muricata, and P. radiata have also been reported as hosts to pine-pine gall rust (E. harknessii), but these pine species are considered less valuable. Because E. harknessii is an <b>autoecious</b> short-cycle rust lacking telial a host, {{there is no alternative}} hosts. The pathogen can infect actively growing shoots of any age very quickly without infecting an alternative host, making the disease cycle more destructive that typical rust species that switch between hosts. This also prevents control of the fungus by management of the alternative host species.|$|E
50|$|Pine-pine gall rust has {{characteristically}} brown to yellow-orange sori {{visible on}} large globular galls on pines. Gall formation on trunks occurs over 2-4 {{years and is}} stimulated by the pathogen, which causes cells to grow and divide quickly {{at the site of}} initial infection. When mature, the gall splits open and the yellow-orange aeciospores are dispersed and carried to new hosts by wind. Because P. harknessii does not require an alternate host, the aeciospores can infect another pine directly. This typically occurs during moist conditions and rarely infects older shoots. Infection continues on the host shoots and needles until they have reached 90% of their elongation. Gall mortality is associated with squirrel feeding or invasion and inactivation by secondary organisms. The life cycle of E. Harknessii is different from other pine stem rust in that it is <b>autoecious,</b> making large stands of pines ideal hosts for survival and reproduction of the fungus.|$|E
5000|$|Rusts (Pucciniales, {{previously}} {{known as}} Uredinales) at their greatest complexity, produce five {{different types of}} spores on two different host plants in two unrelated host families. Such rusts are heteroecious (requiring two hosts) and macrocyclic (producing all five spores types). Wheat stem rust is an example. By convention, the stages and spore states are numbered by Roman numerals. Typically, basidiospores infect host one, {{also known as the}} alternate or sexual host, the mycelium forms pycnidia, which are miniature, flask-shaped, hollow, submicroscopic bodies embedded in host tissue (such as a leaf). This stage, numbered [...] "0", produces single-celled spores that ooze out in a sweet liquid and that act as nonmotile spermatia, and also protruding receptive hyphae. Insects and probably other vectors such as rain carry the spermatia from spermagonium to spermagonium, cross inoculating the mating types. Neither thallus is male or female. Once crossed, the dikaryons are established and a second spore stage is formed, numbered [...] "I" [...] and called aecia, which form dikaryotic aeciospores in dry chains in inverted cup-shaped bodies embedded in host tissue. These aeciospores then infect the second host, known as the primary or asexual host (in macrocyclic rusts). On the primary host a repeating spore stage is formed, numbered [...] "II", the urediospores in dry pustules called uredinia. Urediospores are dikaryotic and can infect the same host that produced them. They repeatedly infect this host over the growing season. At the end of the season, a fourth spore type, the teliospore, is formed. It is thicker-walled and serves to overwinter or to survive other harsh conditions. It does not continue the infection process, rather it remains dormant for a period and then germinates to form basidia (stage [...] "IV"), sometimes called a promycelium. In the Pucciniales, the basidia are cylindrical and become 3-septate after meiosis, with each of the 4 cells bearing one basidiospore each. The basidiospores disperse and start the infection process on host 1 again. <b>Autoecious</b> rusts complete their life-cycles on one host instead of two, and microcyclic rusts cut out one or more stages.|$|E

The detailed description and taxonomic studies (using light and scanning electron microscopy) show that such an obligate parasite fungus (Puccinia pimpinellae) is <b>autoecious</b> microcyclic (uredinial-telial stage only). Among tested Apiaceae plants, the host range test proved the specificity of the rust fungus to anise. To the researcher’s knowledge, this is the first investigated record of a rust fungus on Pimpinella anisum plants in Egypt. The effectiveness of some plant resistance elicitors and two active chitinase producers; Bacillus subtilis Bio 4 and isolated Trichoderma harizianum CH 4 (both of them recorded the highest clear zone/colony size ratio on chitin agar plates) in controlling anise rust disease and on growth and yield of anise were evaluated in two successive growing seasons. Spraying chitosan at 1000 ppm was the most potent in reducing Disease Severity (DS) and Incidence (DI) as well as improving plant height, chlorophyll content, inflorescence No. plant - 1 (74. 2 and 76), 1000 -fruit weight (2. 94 and 2. 83 g) and anise yield (646. 8 and 670. 0 kg fed - 1), during both seasons.

40|$|Common ragweed, Ambrosia artemisiifolia, is {{a highly}} {{allergenic}} North American plant that has become invasive {{in some parts of}} Europe, Asia and Australia following its introduction to many places in the world. Some earlier works suggested that a microcyclic <b>autoecious</b> rust fungus, Puccinia xanthii, known to infect A. artemisiifolia in the USA only, can be considered as a potential classical biocontrol agent (BCA) of this noxious weed in Europe and elsewhere. However, an extensive field survey did not reveal the presence of either P xanthii or any other rusts on common ragweed in 14 US states and two Canadian provinces in 2002 and 2003. Moreover, P xanthii infecting A. artemisiifolia has never been recorded in Canada, although it is known to occur on A. trifida and Xanthium spp. there. Nevertheless, herbarium specimens collected between 1855 and 1963 in five states of the USA confirmed the presence of P xanthii on A. artemisiifolia. It is concluded that currently P xanthii cannot be regarded as a promising BCA of A. artemisiifolia, although it did occur on common ragweed at least a few decades ago in the USA and some forms of this rust species have already been evaluated as effective BCAs of Xanthium in Australia...|$|E
40|$|Endophyllum osteospermi is an <b>autoecious,</b> endocyclic rust fungus, {{which has}} only been {{recorded}} on Chrysanthemoides monilifera ssp. monilifera (Asteraceae, Calendulae), a perennial woody shrub. Both organisms are indigenous to South Africa. Because E. osteospermi is being considered for release in Australia as a biocontrol agent against C. monilifera ssp. monilifera, {{it was necessary to}} determine its host range and natural distribution in South Africa. To address this, natural stands of Chrysanthemoides species, as well as other South African asteraceous plants, were monitored for E. osteospermi between 1992 and 2003. A morphological and molecular comparison of specimens referable to Endophyllum was undertaken. Based on these results, E. osteospermi was recorded on C. monilifera sspp. monilifera, pisifera, rotundata, canescens, and subcanescens, C. incana, and an undescribed taxon. E. osteospermi was also recorded on Osteospermum ciliatum, O. pollgaloides, and O. potbergense. Furthermore, a closely related but previously undescribed species, E. dimorphothecae sp. nov. is described on Dimorphotheca cuneata. Aecidium elytropappi is transferred to Endophyllum as E. elytropappi comb. nov., being recorded on Elytropappus rhinocerostis and Stoebe plumosa. This study shows that in South Africa E. osteospermi is restricted to a small group of related plant species in the Calenduleae. This rust is therefore considered suitable as a candidate agent for the biocontrol of C. monilifera ssp. monilifera, and pending the results of host specificity testing, would most likely be safe to introduce into Australia...|$|E
40|$|Puccinia horiana is {{the causal}} agent of {{chrysanthemum}} white rust or Japanese rust. This microcyclic <b>autoecious</b> rust has a quarantine status {{and can cause}} major damage in the commercial production of Chrysanthemum x morifolium. Given the international and often trans-continental production of planting material and cut flowers of chrysanthemum and the decreasing availability of registered fungicides in specific regions, breeding for resistance against P. horiana will gain importance and will need to involve the appropriate resistance genes for the pathotypes that may be present. As pathotypes have not been well characterized in this system, the main objective was to build an international collection of isolates and screen these on a large collection of cultivars to identify different pathotypes. Using a robust and high throughput bioassay, we tested 36 selected cultivars with 22 individual single-pustule isolates of P. horiana. The isolates originated from three different continents over 4 different collection years and included some isolates from cultivars previously reported as resistant. In most cases the bioassays resulted in a clear scoring of interaction phenotypes as susceptible or resistant, while in several cases consistent intermediate phenotypes were found, often on specific cultivars. Twenty-four of the cultivars gave a differential interaction phenotype profile. All isolates produced a unique profile, infecting a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 19 differential cultivars. Based on the Person analysis of these profiles, this pathosystem contains at least seven resistance genes (and seven avirulence genes), demonstrating the highly complex race structure in this pathosyste...|$|E
40|$|Puccinia helianthi, {{causal agent}} of {{sunflower}} rust, is a macrocyclic and <b>autoecious</b> pathogen. Widespread sexual reproduction of P. helianthi was documented in North Dakota and Nebraska {{for the first}} time in 2008 and has since frequently occurred. Concurrently, an increase in sunflower rust incidence, severity, and subsequent yield loss on sunflower has occurred since 2008. Rust can be managed with resistance genes but determination of virulence phenotypes is important for effective gene deployment and hybrid selection. However, the only P. helianthi virulence data available in the United States was generated prior to 2009 and consisted of aggregate virulence phenotypes determined on bulk field collections. The objective of this study was to determine the phenotypic diversity of P. helianthi in the United States. P. helianthi collections were made from cultivated, volunteer, and wild Helianthus spp. at 104 locations across seven U. S. states and one Canadian province in 2011 and 2012. Virulence phenotypes of 238 single-pustule isolates were determined on the internationally accepted differential set. In total, 29 races were identified, with races 300 and 304 occurring most frequently in 2011 and races 304 and 324 occurring most frequently in 2012. Differences in race prevalence occurred between survey years and across geography but were similar among host types. Four isolates virulent to all genes in the differential set (race 777) were identified. The resistance genes found in differential lines HA-R 3 (R 4 b), MC 29 (R 2 and R 10), and HA-R 2 (R 5) conferred resistance to 96. 6, 83. 6, and 78. 6 % of the isolates tested, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Models {{developed}} in continuous-time {{have been used}} to study the epidemiology and population dynamics of plant hosts, usually in cultivated systems. Here discrete-time SIR–type models are developed which contain parameters representing characteristics of an uncultivated, biennial host plant – systemic, castrating pathogen system. This thesis presents 4 epidemiological model forms representing a generic SIR model, a constant pathogen-induced mortality model, a variable pathogen-induced mortality model, and a model which has an additional phase representing a seedbank. Using a range of parameter values it is possible to produce simulation outcomes with population crashes, cycles and steady-state populations. For each of the models a pathogen epidemic criterion is derived as is a term describing population steady-state values. For the pathogen-induced mortality models, the invasion criteria include a pathogenicity term indicating that the pathogen in part regulates the host population dynamics. The biennial host plant Tragopogon pratensis has been recorded in the Park Grass Experiment and has been described as an outbreak species regulated by the <b>autoecious,</b> demicyclic rust fungus, Puccinia hysterium (Silvertown et al., 2006). The rust is shown to castrate the host plant by reducing the numbers of seed set and the viability of seeds produced by infected individuals. Further characteristics of this host – pathogen system are identified by using the developed models. This is justified as the recurrencerelationships derived from the models fit the observed data, and that the accuracy of the fit is increased with larger values of pathogen-induced mortality. These models produce simulation outcomes that are similar to the host population dynamics. The models also show that the system is governed by density-dependent factors.
