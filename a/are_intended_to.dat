5|$|Death {{has always}} been a {{critical}} moment for those bereaved, and consequently death is surrounded by taboo-like rules. Family life has to be reorganized and in order to master such transitions, people use rites. The ceremonies are transitional rites that <b>are</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> give the deceased peace in his or her new situation {{at the same time as}} they provide strength for the bereaved to carry on with their lives.|$|E
5|$|Horrible Histories {{is based}} on the British children's historical-comedy book series by Terry Deary, first {{published}} by Scholastic UK in 1993 and since expanded into a multimedia franchise. The books and subsequent spin-off materials <b>are</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> pique young children's interest in history via short, factually based but humorously told anecdotes highlighting aspects of the subject not usually covered in more traditional educational sources.|$|E

5|$|Amman is the 4th most visited Arab {{city and}} the ninth highest {{recipient}} of international visitor spending. Roughly 1.8 million tourists visited Amman in 2011 and spent over $1.3 billion in the city.

5|$|At present, some 192 spells are known, {{though no}} single {{manuscript}} contains them all. They served {{a range of}} purposes. Some <b>are</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> give the deceased mystical knowledge in the afterlife, or perhaps to identify them with the gods: for instance, Spell 17 is an obscure and lengthy description of the god Atum. Others are incantations to ensure the different elements of the dead person's being were preserved and reunited, and to give the deceased control over the world around him. Still others protect the deceased from various hostile forces or guide him through the underworld past various obstacles. Famously, two spells also deal with the judgement of the deceased in the Weighing of the Heart ritual.|$|E
50|$|The Model 187 was a {{proposed}} light aircraft by United States manufacturer Cessna in the 1970s. As the newer Model 177 had <b>been</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> replace the 172, so the 187 <b>was</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> replace the 182.|$|R

5|$|Both {{entrance}}s {{will feature}} the glass canopy design, {{the first of}} their kind in the subway system. They <b>are</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> stand out aesthetically. The entrances are interweaved with the Hudson Yards developments, with the main entrance wedged between 50 Hudson Yards {{to the east and}} 55 Hudson Yards to the west. The rest of the Hudson Yards development is located very close to the south of the station. Both entrances are based on a design by architect Toshiko Mori, which itself is based on the design of smaller station entrances in the Paris Métro.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to local}} {{conditions}} it was sometimes {{necessary for the}} Commission to deviate from its standard design. In places prone to extreme weather or earthquakes, such as Thailand and Turkey, stone-faced pedestal markers are used instead of the normal headstones. These measures <b>are</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> prevent masonry being damaged during earthquakes or sinking into sodden ground. In Italy, headstones were carved from Chiampo Perla limestone {{because it was in}} more plentiful supply. In Struma Military Cemetery, in Greece, to avoid risk of earthquake damage, small headstones are laid flush to the ground. Due to their smaller size, the markers often lack unit insignia.|$|E
5|$|During 2005–2006 Bristol Water started {{restoring}} two artificial islands. These <b>are</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> provide safe nesting and roosting {{sites for}} a range of wildfowl.

They can be obtained from Woodford Lodge and include conditions of use imposed by the owners.|$|E

50|$|This {{designation}} <b>is</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> {{result in}} special consideration for these animals by the Department, land managers, consulting biologists, and others, and <b>is</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> {{focus attention on}} the species to help avert the need for costly listing under federal and State endangered species laws and cumbersome recovery efforts that might ultimately be required. This designation also <b>is</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> stimulate collection of additional information on the biology, distribution, and status of poorly known at-risk species, and focus research and management attention on them.|$|R
5|$|Hi-5 {{were formed}} in 1998 in Sydney, Australia as a children's musical group. Television {{producer}} Helena Harris, {{who had worked}} on Bananas in Pyjamas, co-created Hi-5 as a concept for a new television show. She and co-producer Posie Graeme-Evans (The Miraculous Mellops, Mirror, Mirror) developed the series as preschool entertainment, incorporating educational trends with a pop music appeal, using music and movement to capture the attention of children. Featuring five performers, the cast <b>are</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> act as older siblings of viewers, rather than adults teaching children. The name of the group {{was derived from the}} high five gesture.|$|E
5|$|In July 2009, {{the policy}} of {{time-based}} development freezes on a two-year cycle was announced. Time-based freezes <b>are</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> blend the predictability of time based releases with Debian's policy of feature based releases, and to reduce overall freeze time. The Squeeze cycle {{was going to be}} especially short; however, this initial schedule was abandoned. In September 2010, the backports service became official, providing more recent versions of some software for the stable release.|$|E
5|$|Like {{previous}} missions, {{the astronauts}} took many photos of Earth from the station, over 700 in total, {{which have been}} made freely available. These Crew Earth Observations, <b>are</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> record dynamic events on the Earth's surface such as storms, fires, or volcanoes. For example, a photo from 1 January 2001 shows Mount Cleveland, Alaska, with a plume of smoke, prior to its eruption the following month. On 23 January 2001, the crew observed a unique perspective of a plume of volcanic ash coming from Popocatépetl, an active volcano 70 kilometres southeast of Mexico City.|$|E

5|$|Many of the Quest's rules <b>are</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> {{ensure the}} health of dogs in {{hazardous}} conditions. This process begins before the race, when all dogs must be examined by race veterinarians, who certify that the animals are suited and healthy enough to participate. Before the race, dog equipment also must be checked by race officials. Padded harnesses are required, each musher must carry an appropriate amount of food, and additional food supplies must be in position at checkpoints.|$|E
5|$|Nine royal tombs {{were located}} in the {{north-eastern}} quadrant of the Rova grounds. These included the two large tombs of King RadamaI (d.1828) and Queen Rasoherina (d.1868), as well as seven ancient wooden tombs known collectively as the Fitomiandalana. These older tombs, {{the first of which}} was built in 1630 for King Andrianjaka, were a series of seven tomb pits topped with individual wooden trano masina (tomb houses) built close together in a row with their gable peaks aligned, followed by one tomb pit without a tomb house. Tomb houses are particular to highland tombs and <b>are</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> indicate the noble rank of the deceased and house his or her spirit after death.|$|E
5|$|NuScale's design {{does not}} rely on powered water pumps or circulatory equipment. The company claims it can shut down and {{continue}} cooling itself indefinitely {{in the event of}} a catastrophe. The devices <b>are</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> be kept in a below-ground pool, to absorb the shock of earthquakes, with a concrete lid over the pool. In the event that AC power is lost for normal cooling systems, the pool water begins to absorb heat and boil.|$|E
