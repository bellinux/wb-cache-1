500|$|Following {{the radio}} {{success of the}} band's cover of George Michael's [...] "Faith", the band was {{determined}} to record the follow-up to their first album {{in order to show}} that they weren't a [...] "Korn ripoff" [...] or a cover band; the band began writing an album which dealt with issues deriving from their newfound fame. Producer Terry Date, known for working with Pantera, White Zombie and Deftones, was chosen by Limp Bizkit to produce Significant Other. Guitarist Wes Borland stated of Date's production, [...] "he doesn't get overly involved at the 'music' end of things. He's a producer who fools with sound and sonically makes everything perfect. He gets sounds that translate really well on tape <b>and</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> completely captures what we do, perfectly." [...] The band immediately began recording after the conclusion of the Family Values Tour, despite the insistence of Interscope Records that the band take a break after it.|$|E
500|$|According to actress Marley Shelton, [...] "Rodriguez and Tarantino really co-directed, {{at least}} Planet Terror. Quentin was on set a lot. He had notes and {{adjustments}} to our performances and he changed lines {{every once in}} a while. Of course, he always deferred to Robert on Planet Terror and vice versa for Death Proof. So it's really both of their brainchild." [...] Tarantino has stated, [...] "I can't imagine doing Grindhouse with any other director in the way me and Robert did it because I just had complete faith and trust in him. So much so that we didn't actually see each other's movie completed until three weeks before the film opened. It was as if we worked in little vacuums and cut our movies down, and then put them together and watched it all play, and then made a couple of little changes after that, <b>and</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> that was it." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{nature of}} PewDiePie's video content has been {{described}} by various outlets as goofy, energetic, obnoxious and filled with profanity. However, many of the same outlets concede that PewDiePie's content is genuine and unfiltered. Sarah Begley of Time said his clips contained [...] "charismatic narration". Chris Reed of The Wall St. Cheat Sheet said it contained [...] "off-the-cuff running commentary that's characterised by goofy jokes, profanity and loud outbursts." [...] Walker wrote PewDiePie's [...] "chosen mode of sharing his critique happens to be ribald entertainment, an unmediated stream of blurted jokes, startled yelps, goofy voices, politically incorrect comments <b>and</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> nonstop profanity." [...] Reed adds that these aspects of PewDiePie's videos are what critics find most abrasive, but what fans love the most. PewDiePie resorts occasionally to gameplay, resulting in silent or emotional commentary; his playthrough of The Last of Us, it was detailed, left the usually vocal gamer speechless at the ending.|$|E
500|$|Starbucks founder Howard Schultz {{reached out}} to Turlington to support her {{foundation}} Every Mother Counts, which seeks to make pregnancy and childbirth safe for mothers. David Legry, who served as Starbucks' editorial manager, helped shape the compilation after reading about Turlington's humanitarian work, and later worked with artists to select suitable songs. Turlington then recruited several artists, including: Carla Bruni, Sheryl Crow, Jennifer Lopez, Madonna, her friend Gwyneth Paltrow, and Martha Wainwright, {{to contribute to the}} project. She contacted all participating artists, and recalled: We already had our soundtrack, and I already had Martha Wainwright singing [...] "No Woman, No Cry," [...] which was great, but it got us all thinking that a compilation CD would be a great way to target women who are artists and also mothers and see what they're willing to contribute. So I wrote some letters and spoke to a few of the women that are on the CD, and threw the idea out <b>and</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> everybody that we went to is on this list and said yes and was really excited.|$|E
500|$|Ironsword: Wizards & Warriors II was {{developed}} by UK-based computer game company Zippo Games, headed by Ste and John Pickford; {{this was the first}} game Zippo developed for fellow UK-based video game company Rare. At the time, Zippo Games had just completed a previous game titled Cosmic Pirate - a game that was published by Palace Software and released for the Commodore64, AtariST, and Amiga in 1988. New to the technical capabilities of the Nintendo Entertainment System, the Pickford brothers visited Rare and were pleased with their NES library, though they thought they were backtracking by deciding to develop games for the console. According to Ste Pickford: [...] "The NES seemed primitive by comparison, sub-Commodore64. But the games were ten times better than everything being released for home computers, which we appreciated, and we wanted to try to make games as good as that." [...] Rare decided to hire Zippo Games to develop this Wizards & Warriors sequel; Pickford remarked: [...] "Rare showed us Wizards & Warriors and asked us to develop the sequel, <b>and</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> left us to it." [...] Rare felt that Zippo Games was trustworthy enough to develop the sequel without much help from them.|$|E

500|$|Slay Tracks was {{recorded}} during a four-hour session on January 17, 1989, at Young's studio. Kannberg, describing {{the studio and}} the recording process, said, [...] "You go into his house and it's stuff everywhere, old dogs lying around, big pot plants everywhere, and Gary tells us that he got all his equipment by selling pot! It was us going in <b>and</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> just laying down the songs with a glide guitar and a detuned guitar through a bass amp and then we'd play drums over the top." [...] Young, though bewildered by the band's sound, contributed by playing drums. He recalled, [...] " [...] {{come in and they}} play this weird guitar noise and it just sounds like noise, with no background. My drums were in there so I said, 'Should I drum?' and they said 'Okay.'" [...] Kannberg said, [...] "We did it really fast. We probably spent one day tracking and one day mixing it." [...] The title of the EP had been decided prior to its recording, and the pseudonyms S.M. and Spiral Stairs were used to credit Malkmus and Kannberg respectively.|$|E
500|$|For the PlayStation version, IGN's David Zdyrko cited that [...] "Many of {{the games}} are quite enjoyable, {{but the truth of}} the matter is that it never quite matches the thrill of the real thing" [...] and criticized on how [...] "the visuals are very bland on the whole. It has low-resolution backgrounds, <b>and</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> nothing at all to get excited about". He also called the music [...] "boring and {{completely}} uninspiring". Allgame editor Matt Grandstaff commended the card games, as they [...] "require a fair amount of strategy, and thus remain entertaining" [...] and that [...] "the look and feel of Caesars Palace 2000 recaptures the feel of one of the most successful casinos of all-time". He stated that the game [...] "is definitely not about the looks" [...] but [...] "does an admirable job recreating the casino experience". Grandstaff felt that the game [...] "has the sound of a real casino. From background clatter to the voices of the dealer, this is Caesar's Palace". He noted that players [...] "will enjoy sitting through hours of card games" [...] but to [...] "Avoid the slots". Grandstaff also commented that the strategy book that comes with the game [...] "should be packed on any trip to Vegas".|$|E
500|$|The Face {{garnered}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music journalists upon its release, later landing at number two and nine on the year-end lists of publications Beats per Minute <b>and</b> <b>Pretty</b> <b>Much</b> Amazing, respectively. Edmunds said that [...] "releasing music of this quality {{at such an}} early age and so early into their career only makes one excited {{as to what the}} future holds for them", concluding his review that [...] "The Face acts as a reminder to other producers to stay {{at the top of their}} game, because the kids are coming up from behind". Will Ryan, writing for Beats per Minute, called the record's four songs to be the some of the best club tracks of all time, labeling it a [...] "complete statement that overloads all possible cylinders, as vital as the ages of the producers behind it might suggest, delivered by a duo whose rise can only just qualify as meteoric". Sherburne, when interviewing Disclosure for Spin magazine, honored the EP as the duo's [...] "best and most varied" [...] release, noting its production to be [...] "yielding a high-end that’s filigreed with crystal and compression so pneumatic that it seems to suck the air from your lungs".|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} to [...] "Hollywood A.D." [...] {{was mostly}} positive. The Montreal Gazette named the episode the sixth best stand-alone X-Files episode, writing that [...] "Despite taxing our stomach for self-reflexive comedy, this David Duchovny scripted and directed episode manages to deliver {{some of the}} greatest laughs of the series." [...] Rob Bricken from Topless Robot named [...] "Hollywood A.D." [...] the seventh funniest X-Files episode. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity gave the episode a B, slightly criticizing the dancing zombies {{at the end of the}} episode. Sarah Kendzior from 11th Hour Magazine wrote that, [...] "My favorite [...] this year may well be 'Hollywood A.D.', an ambitious, often ingenious and occasionally flawed sophomore effort concerning the entertainment industry, religion, <b>and</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> everything in between." [...] Rich Rosell from DigitallyObsessed.com awarded the episode 5 out of 5 stars and wrote that [...] " [...] scene from the 'movie' where Shandling/Mulder faces off against The Cigarette Smoking Pontiff, and his army of sniper zombies, is classic stuff, and earns 'Hollywood A.D.' high marks." [...] Kenneth Silber from Space.com, while criticizing the episode for reveling in parody, noted that the episode was entertaining, writing, [...] "'Hollywood A.D.' is a parody and, as such, will be unsatisfying to the many X-Files viewers, including this long-suffering reviewer, who'd like to see the series culminate in a dramatic, multi-episode denouement of its 'mythology arc'. Nonetheless, this episode has merit as a witty and imaginative parody." ...|$|E
500|$|When [...] "Better than Today" [...] {{became a}} single, reviews {{for the song}} itself were mixed. McAlpine of BBC said [...] "the {{relentless}} swaggering momentum" [...] of the track [...] "gets a little wearing". He continued, [...] "At some point, something ELSE needs to happen, y'see [...] No {{matter how many times}} Kylie's voice swoops up high and skips back down again, no matter how firmly she pushes herself into those demanding choruses; it begins like Tigger and ends like a route march around an aerobics class." [...] He gave the single three out of five stars. Popjustice, while stating the song is [...] "rather enjoyable", added that it is a [...] "no-harm-intended album track" [...] instead of [...] "the big balls-out I'm-bloody-Kylie comeback single". They remarked at a later date, saying that they were [...] "slightly alarmed" [...] when the song became a single. Nima Baniamer of Contact Music described the song as [...] "a fun electro number", but it [...] "sadly doesn't seem to pack a punch enough to stand firm as a lead-out track". Originally in an album review, Levine of Digital Spy called the tune [...] "as uplifting a dance-pop ditty as we're likely to hear all year". In a single review, Levine re-evaluated the song, stating that it is not [...] "the freshest confection you'll sample this party season" [...] but he continued, calling it [...] "sweet, seductive <b>and</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> impossible not to succumb to over and over again". He gave the single four out of five stars.|$|E

2500|$|Electronic {{music is}} another influence. Parker has used rock {{instrumentation}} in an electronic manner, saying [...] "The {{way we do}} music, it's organic, but it's meant to be quite repetitive and hypnotic, almost {{in a kind of}} electronic nature. Using our playing as though it was a living sample." [...] A heavy feature on Innerspeaker is a pitch-shifted guitar tone that many mistook for a synth. Parker mentioned this by saying [...] "I had a few obsessions when recording Innerspeaker. One was to make the guitars sound like synths and drums sound like drum samples <b>and</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> anything except guitars and drums.

2500|$|Roger Ebert, {{film critic}} of the Chicago Sun-Times, praised Wonder Boys as [...] "the most {{accurate}} movie about campus life that I can remember. It is accurate, not because it captures intellectual debate or campus politics, but because it knows two things: (1) Students come and go, but the faculty actually lives there, and (2) many faculty members stay stuck in graduate-student mode for decades". Emanuel Levy of Variety wrote, [...] "The movie's frivolous touches and eccentric details emphasize its dry, measured wit {{and the power of}} comedy to underscore serious ideas. Massively inventive, Wonder Boys is spiked with fresh, perverse humor that flows naturally from the straight-faced playing". A.O. Scott from The New York Times wrote, [...] "The problem is that everyone involved seems to have agreed that it was a great idea for a movie <b>and</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> left it at that".|$|E

He was heavily {{critical of the}} deception and evasion minigames, and although he thought the Alethiometer gameplay was interesting, he felt its almost wholly optional nature in the game undermined it. He was most critical, however, of the plot; [...] "The story is a mess standing on its own [...] The game makes little attempt to portray Pullman's world, instead opting to magpie scenes from the film and career through the story with little concession for the player." [...] Ryan Clements rated the PC version 3.5 out of 10 arguing [...] "the game {{is all over the}} place <b>and</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> does nothing well."
