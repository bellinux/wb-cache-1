25|$|The gene has 97% {{sequence}} homology with the glycophorin A gene from the 5' UTR approximately 1 kilobase upstream from the exon encoding the transmembrane regions to {{the portion of}} the coding sequence encoding the first 45 amino acids. There is a signal sequence of 19 amino acid residues. The leader peptide differs by one amino acid and the next 26 amino acids are identical. Amino acids 27-55 of glycophorin A are absent from glycophorin B. This section includes an N-glycosylation site. Only O-glycosylation sites are found on glycoprotein B and these are linked via serine or threonine. Residues 80-100 of glycophorin A and 51-71 of glycophorin B are very similar. The intervening residues in contrast differ significantly. The <b>antigenic</b> <b>determinant</b> for the blood group Ss is located at residue 29 where S has a methionine and s a threonine. This is due to a mutation at nucleotide 143 (C->T). The S antigen is also known as MSN3 and the s antigen as MNS4.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} methods to {{investigate}} protein-protein interactions existing with differences in immobilization of each reactant in 2D or 3D orientation. The measured affinities {{are stored in}} public databases, such as the Ki Database and BindingDB. As an example, affinity is the binding strength between the complex structures of the epitope of <b>antigenic</b> <b>determinant</b> and paratope of antigen-binding site of an antibody.

50|$|An epitope, {{also known}} as <b>antigenic</b> <b>determinant,</b> {{is the part of}} an antigen that is {{recognized}} by the immune system, specifically by antibodies, B cells, or T cells. For example, the epitope is the specific piece of the antigen to which an antibody binds. The part of an antibody that binds to the epitope is called a paratope. Although epitopes are usually non-self proteins, sequences derived from the host that can be recognized (as in the case of autoimmune diseases) are also epitopes.|$|E

40|$|Three {{different}} types of <b>antigenic</b> <b>determinants</b> were demonstrated in soluble collagen {{with the aid of}} rat, rabbit and chicken antisera to native collagen. Helical <b>antigenic</b> <b>determinants</b> which require an intact triple-helical structure of the molecule are mainly recognized by rat antisera. Renaturation of the serologically inactive unfolded polypeptide chains (denatured collagen) is accompanied by a significant recovery of serological activity. Central <b>antigenic</b> <b>determinants</b> which are probably located in the same regions of amino acid sequence are less accessible in the native antigen and become exposed upon denaturation. Equal titres for both types of determinants are found in chicken antisera. Immunization with denatured collagen, however, revealed a response restricted to the central type. Isolated antibodies specific for terminal non-helical <b>antigenic</b> <b>determinants,</b> as yet only known to occur in rabbit antisera, reacted equally well with native collagen, the unfolded polypeptide chains and with small cyanogen bromide peptides.

50|$|There {{are several}} types of {{antibodies}} and antigens, and each antibody is capable of binding only to a specific antigen.

The variable region in turn has hyper-variable regions which are unique amino acid sequences in each antibody.

50|$|Alfred Nisonoff was {{introduced}} to the subject of antibodies while studying at the Roswell Park Memorial Institute in Buffalo with a man named David Pressman. David Pressman was working in one of Linus Pauling’s groups exploring the antigenic specificity of antibodies against haptenic determinants. This research took advantage of the technique of quantitative hapten inhibition, originally developed by Karl Landsteiner. While conducting these experiments in Pressman’s lab, Nisonoff contributed to an important paper explaining an idea that eventually led to important conclusions about the structure of the antibody molecule. In this early paper he demonstrated that the antibody molecule has two combining sites with the same specificity for an <b>antigenic</b> <b>determinant.</b> This helped to disprove the “instructional theories” of antibody formation.|$|E

Competition curves were used to quantify the concentrations of competitors needed to cause 30 % inhibition of the precipitation of 125 I-labelled alpha-L-fucosidase. The isoelectric forms of alpha-L-fucosidase, which are related by sialic acid residues, were separated preparatively and used as competitors in the radioimmunoassay.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo confirm {{genotype}} diversities {{of clinical}} isolates of Bordetella pertussis and {{to evaluate the}} risk of pertussis outbreak in Korea. MethodsSeven housekeeping genes and 10 <b>antigenic</b> <b>determinant</b> genes from clinical B. pertussis isolates were analyzed by Multilocus sequence typing (MLST). ResultsMore variant pattern was observed in <b>antigenic</b> <b>determinant</b> genes. Especially, PtxS 1 gene was the most variant gene; five genotypes were observed from eight global genotypes. In the bacterial type, the number of observed sequence types in the isolates was seven and the most frequent form was type 1 (79. 6 %). This major sequence type also showed a time-dependent transition pattern. Older isolates (1968 and 1975) showed type 1 and 6 in housekeeping genes and <b>antigenic</b> <b>determinant</b> genes, respectively. However, these were changed to type 2 and 1 in isolates 1999 – 2008. This transition was mainly attributed to genotype change of PtxS 1 and Fim 3 gene; the tendency of genotype change was to avoid vaccine-derived genotype. In addition, there was second transition in 2009. In this period, only the sequence type of <b>antigenic</b> <b>determinant</b> genes was changed to type 2. Based Upon Related Sequence Types (BURST) analysis confirmed {{that there were two}} clonal complexes (ACCI and ACCII) in the Korean isolates. Moreover, the recently increased sequence type was revealed as AST 2 derived from AST 3 in ACCI. ConclusionsGenotype changes in Korean distributing strains are still progressing and there was a specific driving force in <b>antigenic</b> <b>determinant</b> genes. Therefore continuous surveillance of genotype change of the distributing strains should be performed to confirm interrelationship of genotype change with vaccine immunity...|$|E

Less intense staining was seen on the basolateral membranes of parotid acinar cells, but no staining was seen on the acinar cells of submandibular or sublingual glands. These sites of staining have been shown, by other methods, to posses substantial Na+, K+-ATPase, indicating that the antibody recognizes <b>antigenic</b> <b>determinants</b> of the sodium pump highly conserved in the course of evolution. In addition, staining with this antibody was observed at the apical region of cells of the proximal straight tubule and of the papillary collecting duct in the kidney.
