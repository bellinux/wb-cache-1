Colin Murray Parkes in the 1960s and 1970s in England noted increased doctor visits, with symptoms such as <b>abdominal</b> pain, <b>breathing</b> difficulties, and so forth {{in the first six months}} following a death. Others have noted increased mortality rates (Ward, A.W. 1976) and Bunch et al. found a five times greater risk of suicide in teens following the death of a parent.|$|R
50|$|As to {{the first}} {{function}} breathing, essential to life, Dr. Hashimoto advised <b>abdominal</b> <b>breathing.</b> Breathing is the most vital function in our life, which cannot be interrupted {{for more than a}} few minutes. It follows that the healthier one is, the deeper one’s breathing. To this end, Dr. Hashimoto advocated abdominal massage and <b>abdominal</b> <b>breathing</b> every night before going to sleep. About the second function of eating/drinking, or diet, Dr. Hashimoto advocated a simple macrobiotic diet. Nevertheless, he cautioned against being too strict about one’s diet. He suggested learning which foods were most nourishing and what was best for one’s own health. The most important thing in diet, Dr. Hashimo maintained, was not what or how much food was eaten, but how well the food that was eaten was chewed and digested.|$|E
50|$|Breathing {{techniques}} {{is one of}} {{the easiest}} ways to reduce stress. It requires little effort and can be done anywhere at any time. Proper breathing techniques that incorporate deep <b>abdominal</b> <b>breathing</b> have been shown to reduce the physical symptoms of depression, anxiety and hypertension as well as everyday emotional symptoms of anger and nervousness.|$|E

2500|$|Diagnostic {{techniques}} include X-ray, computed tomography, {{and surgical}} {{techniques such as}} laparotomy. [...] Diagnosis is often difficult because signs may not show up on X-ray, or signs that do show up appear similar to other conditions. Signs and symptoms included chest and <b>abdominal</b> pain, difficulty <b>breathing,</b> and decreased lung sounds. [...] When a tear is discovered, surgery is needed to repair it.|$|R

50|$|Apart {{from the}} greater time to onset of {{inactivity}} and <b>abdominal</b> <b>breathing</b> at lethal doses (25-40 minutes), {{and the time}} to death (approximately 1.3 hours), the symptoms after pinnatoxin E, F or G admission by gavage do not differ much from admission by intraperitoneal injection. In contrast, the time to death after admission of pinnatoxin H by intraperitoneal injection or gavage did not differ.|$|E
50|$|Respiratory arrest, {{which results}} in a lack of an oxygen supply to the brain, is the most evident and lethal effect of anatoxin-a. Injections of mice, rats, birds, dogs, and calves with lethal doses of anatoxin-a have {{demonstrated}} that death is preceded by a sequence of muscle fasciculations, decreased movement, collapse, exaggerated <b>abdominal</b> <b>breathing,</b> cyanosis and convulsions. In mice, anatoxin-a also seriously impacted blood pressure and heart rate, and caused severe acidosis.|$|E
50|$|Some adult insects which spend {{considerable}} time underwater have an <b>abdominal</b> <b>breathing</b> tube. For example adult water scorpions have the caudal process {{which consists of}} a pair of half-tubes capable of being locked together to form a siphon by means of which air is conducted to the tracheae at the apex of the abdomen when the tip of the tube is thrust above the surface of the water. In immature forms the siphon is undeveloped and breathing takes place through six pairs of abdominal sperms.|$|E

2500|$|The {{reliance}} on untreated well {{water in the}} rural regions of the Marcellus shale play leaves communities at a strong disadvantage if aquifer contamination would occur. [...] It {{has been found that}} methane concentrations in well water within one kilometer from an active gas well were 17 times higher than in those outside of active gas production area. Produced water includes naturally occurring radioactive materials, as wells as high levels of brine, barium, strontium, and radium. At high exposure levels, these contaminants have been shown to cause skin rashes, nausea, <b>abdominal</b> pain, <b>breathing</b> difficulties, headaches, dizziness, eye irritations, throat irritations, and nosebleeds. Residents are also exposed to a myriad of air pollutants through mechanisms such well venting and flaring. Volatile organic compounds, diesel particulate matter, and methane are found in elevated levels around producing wells, often in concentrations that exceed EPA guidelines for carcinogenic health risks. Unfortunately, there have been no studies to try and quantify the cumulative impacts of multiple low dose exposures.|$|R
40|$|Of a {{population}} of 9856 children followed up from birth, 9251 of whom underwent 24 hour tape recordings of electrocardiograms and <b>abdominal</b> wall <b>breathing</b> movements during early infancy, five died suddenly and unexpectedly at home at ages ranging from 16 months to 4 years. Postmortem examination, including full histological and microbiological investigations. failed to identify abnormalities ordinarily associated with death in all five cases. Two {{of the children were}} known to have had frequent cyanotic episodes and died during these events. In the three remaining cases there was no previous history of cyanotic or apnoeic episodes. The death of one of these three children was seen by his parents and the clinical features suggested that apnoea rather than a cardiac arrhythmia was the primary mechanism for his death. As in infancy, sudden and unexpected death for which no adequate cause is found at necropsy seems to constitute a major component of mortality between 1 and 5 years...|$|R

No [...] "gold standard" [...] exists for the content of stress-reduction programs for medical trainees. Some propose a scheme of directed and non-directed support groups, relaxation training (including meditation and hypnosis), time-management and coping skills, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and mentoring programs. Good intervention includes relaxation basics like <b>abdominal</b> <b>breathing,</b> learning to identify and counter negative thoughts, use of the imagery in relaxation, practical ways to increase healthy eating, building positive coping, applying relaxing or activating words appropriately, and redirecting time and energy to different tasks based on the level of importance.|$|E
5000|$|The method {{itself is}} {{first of all}} an {{application}} of what Dr. Bradley termed [...] "the six needs of the laboring woman", most notably deep and complete relaxation and <b>abdominal</b> <b>breathing,</b> but also including quiet, darkness and solitude, physical comfort, and closed eyes {{and the appearance of}} sleep. Secondly, the Bradley Method relies heavily on training fathers to be labor [...] "coaches", or partners. Bradley Method teachers usually supplement these primary techniques with training in different labor positions and comfort measures. In order to master the ability to relax completely as a pain relief tool, couples are taught several different relaxation techniques and encouraged to practice relaxation daily, so that the mother can rely on a conditioned relaxation response to her partner's voice and touch.|$|E

40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{factors associated}} with severe cases of dengue {{in children and adolescents}} hospitalized during the 2007 / 2008 epidemic in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This is a retrospective case-control study that covers 88 cases of severe dengue in patients admitted to four tertiary care children's hospitals. Controls consisted of 22 children with non-severe dengue living in the same neighborhood as the patients with severe dengue. Differences in prevalence of the clinical signs - <b>abdominal</b> pain, <b>breathing</b> difficulty, drowsiness or irritability - emerged on the third day after the onset of symptoms, in the febrile stage. Cases and controls received first medical care at the same clinical stage of disease. However, hospital admission of severe cases occurred later, on average between the third and fourth day after the onset of the disease. Early discharge of patients with fever whose condition could have progressed to severe dengue may have been a consequence of the type of medical assistance provided by primary care units, suggesting deficiencies both {{in the use of the}} risk classification protocol and patient triage...|$|R
40|$|The {{diaphragm}} is a flat muscle {{that separates}} the abdominal cavity from the chest cavity. It is shaped like a double domed vault, arched high in the chest. In addition to the best-known function as the main breathing muscle, the diaphragm {{has an effect on}} blood circulation in the body for proper function of the <b>abdominal</b> organs, <b>breathing,</b> complicit excretory processes and also helps in childbirth. It is therefore not neglect its function mainly visceral and postural function, which is recently very popular, exploration and is the main topic of this thesis. The diaphragm is one of the components of the deep spinal stabilizing system, whose activation is very effective in removing unwanted functional changes in the musculoskeletal system.

50|$|The {{symptoms}} of intoxication in mice after lethal dose admission of pinnatoxin by intraperitoneal injection {{are very similar}} between pinnatoxin E, F, G and H. The symptoms start off with a period of hyperactivity until 10-20 minutes after injection, when an abrupt decrease in activity occurs. In the case of pinnatoxin H injection, mice become immobile instead of hyperactive. During this decrease in activity/occurrence of immobility, <b>abdominal</b> <b>breathing</b> and extension of the hind legs are observed. In some cases, mice suffer from slight exophthalmia. After this period, during which the respiration rate remains normal, the respiration rate declines rapidly within a 2 to 3-minute time interval. Death is preceded by {{a brief period of}} running movements, the occurrence of cyanosis and severe exophthalmos. The time between dosing and death varies between 14 and 50 minutes.|$|E
5000|$|Breathing in Yijin Jing is a {{controversial}} point. Many modern sources {{insist on a}} deep, forced, reverse breathing {{in order to develop}} power and more thoroughly energize the body. Other sources suggest that this may often create excessive strain and pressure on the body. Robert W. Smith, in his article on the J.A.M.A. in 1996, suggests that there are differences between the northern and the southern way of breath. The southern variants seem not to have a developed system of regulating breathing or working on Qi. In his work on [...] "Breathing in Taiji and other fighting arts", Smith analyses not only Taiji veterans and classics, but also known fighters out of his personal experience, and concludes that the kind of breathing which is most effective, be it for martial or for health purposes, is located between classic <b>abdominal</b> <b>breathing</b> and a slow, unconscious breathing, with scope for explosive exhalations of the kind typically used to accompany strikes in many martial arts styles.|$|E
