The solution uses a pulse modulation scheme known as uniform sampled pulse width modulation (UPWM). Eight times interpolation and noise shaping are used to reduce the PWM resolution from 2. 89 GHz to 90. 8 MHz. A noise shaper provides a minimal reduction of the signal quality within the audioband. A pre-compensation method called WPWM is added to reduce the harmonics occurring when UPWM is used.

40|$|Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is an {{important}} diagnostic tool for imaging soft tissue {{without the use of}} ionizing radiation. Moreover, through advanced signal processing, MRI can provide more than just anatomical information, such as estimates of tissue-specific physical properties. Signal processing lies at the very core of the MRI process, which involves input design, information encoding, image reconstruction, and advanced filtering. Based on signal modeling and estimation, it is possible to further improve the images, reduce artifacts, mitigate noise, and obtain quantitative tissue information. In quantitative MRI, different physical quantities are estimated from a set of collected images. The optimization problems solved are typically nonlinear, and require intelligent and application-specific algorithms to avoid suboptimal local minima. This thesis presents several methods for efficiently solving different parameter estimation problems in MRI, such as multi-component T 2 relaxometry, temporal phase correction of complex-valued data, and minimizing banding artifacts due to field inhomogeneity. The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated using both simulation and in-vivo data.

We aim at {{maximizing the}} network energy efficiency by {{taking into account}} {{the fact that some of}} the radio frequency chains can be switched off in order to save power. We consider the antenna specific maximum power constraints to avoid non-linear distortion in power <b>amplifiers</b> and user-specific <b>quality</b> of service (QoS) constraints to guarantee a certain QoS levels. We first introduce binary antenna selection variables and use the perspective formulation to model the relation between them and the beamformers. Subsequently, we propose a new formulation which reduces the feasible set of the continuous relaxation, resulting in better performance compared to the original perspective formulation based problem. However, the resulting optimization problem is a mixed-Boolean non-convex fractional program, which is difficult to solve. We follow the standard continuous relaxation of the binary antenna selection variables, and then reformulate the problem such that it is amendable to successive convex approximation. Thereby, solving the continuous relaxation mostly results in near-binary solution. To recover the binary variables from the continuous relaxation, we switch off all the antennas for which the continuous values are smaller than a small threshold. Numerical results illustrate the superior convergence result and significant achievable gains in terms of energy efficiency with the proposed algorithm.

The cable transmission of data from a scintilla tion camera to a digital computer over long distances presents problems. The major one is the induction of noise {{along the length of}} the cable, thereby causing data errors (1). Dowsett and Roberts (2) have suc ceeded in transmitting analog signals over 1, 450 ft.

Hence, the bias voltage of an HVHF amplifier must be stabilized to ensure stable echo-signal amplitudes. We propose a bias-voltage stabilizer circuit to maintain stable DC voltages {{over a wide}} input range, thus reducing the harmonic-distortion components of the echo signals in VHF pulse-echo measurement systems. To confirm the feasibility of the bias-voltage stabilizer, we measured and compared the deviations in the gain of the HVHF amplifier with and without a bias-voltage stabilizer. Between − 13 and 26 dBm, the measured gain deviations of a HVHF amplifier with a bias-voltage stabilizer are {{less than that of}} an amplifier without a bias-voltage stabilizer. In order to confirm the feasibility of the bias-voltage stabilizer, we compared the pulse-echo responses of the amplifiers, which are typically used for the evaluation of transducers or electronic components used in pulse-echo measurement systems. From the responses, we observed that the amplitudes of the echo signals of a VHF transducer triggered by the HVHF amplifier with a bias-voltage stabilizer were higher than those of the transducer triggered by the HVHF amplifier alone. The second, third, and fourth harmonic-distortion components of the HVHF amplifier with the bias-voltage stabilizer were also lower than those of the HVHF amplifier alone. Hence, the proposed scheme is a promising method for stabilizing the bias voltage of an HVHF amplifier, and improving the echo-signal quality of VHF transducers...|$|R

However, experiments demonstrated lower energy around 90 nJ and slightly shorter pulse duration down to 1 ps. We concentrated this thesis on {{the understanding of}} the mismatch between expected and measured energies for solid targets with the goal to find a way for producing seeded plasma-based soft x-ray laser emitting tens of microjoules per pulse as required by many applications. This work has been done with the code ARWEN. This code had already been used in this field but it has been improved in the frame of this thesis, adding new computational capabilities. The work presented in this thesis is: - Theoretical study of coherent X-ray sources, emphasizing the plasma-based sources. The state of the art and the physics of these amplifiers are described more thoroughly. - Description of the ARWEN code, the fundamental tool of this work, and the improvements introduced in it (ray tracing, parallelization of thermal conduction subroutines, standard HDF output, etc [...] .). In addition to this, the codes used for prostprocessing the data are also described. - Optimization of plasma amplifiers by means of numerical models. These studies start from previous works, continuing the work and explaining the effects that lead to the differences between the predicted energy and the energy experimentally observed. Some ways to avoid these effects are proposed. An study of the amplification of the injected seed in these plasmas is also presented, concluding that pre-amplifier stages are essential. Thus, nowadays a code with new simulation capabilities (ARWEN) is available and it can be applied to several fields (not only plasma-based soft X-ray lasers). It has been used to study plasma-based amplifiers, gaining an insight into the physics of these systems, explaining the differences between experimental results and theoretical predictions. In addition to this, it has been proposed a new scheme to optimize these amplifiers. ...|$|R
