5|$|Intuitively, {{this means}} that every {{algorithmic}} technique or complexity result that <b>applies</b> to H-coloring problems for directed graphs H <b>applies</b> just as well to general CSPs. In particular, one can ask whether the Hell–Nešetřil theorem can be extended to directed graphs. By the above theorem, this {{is equivalent to the}} Feder–Vardi conjecture on CSP dichotomy, which states that for every constraint language Γ, CSP(Γ) is NP-complete or in P.|$|E
