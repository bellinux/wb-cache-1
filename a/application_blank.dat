40|$|Orientation: The recruitment, {{selection}} {{and development of}} suitable candidates are crucial strategic functions to ensure the competitiveness of corporate and public sector organisations. Research purpose: The {{purpose of the study}} was to determine whether targeted organisations have a clear recruitment and selection policy by means of a preliminary exploratory study. In addition to this, the objective was the need to establish the various techniques or methods in use to recruit and select candidates for vacant posts. Motivation for the study: To develop a better understanding of the trends in the application of recruitment and selection methods within the Eastern Cape. Research design, approach and method: This study has a non-experimental design. Methodological processes followed a qualitative and quantitative mixed approach. Structured interviews were used to collect data followed by a descriptive statistical analysis, summary and interpretation of results. Main findings: Whereas newspaper advertising and recruitment agencies are the most popular recruitment methods, the <b>application</b> <b>blank</b> and interviews were mostly preferred for selection purposes. Although assessment centres and psychological assessments were also regarded as popular selection methods, assessment centres were; however, the most prominent selection method to follow of the above two mentioned selection methods. Practical/managerial implications: The research findings could provide corporate leaders and their human resource functionaries with a theoretical pointer relative to recruitment and selection trends within the Province which could guide more effective skills attraction and selection decisions. Contribution/value-add: The study provided valuable strategic information to improve on organisational competiveness via effective recruitment and selection processes. In addition, training and educational programmes could eventually fill the needs and gaps identified in organisational functioning and professional service delivery...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a review and {{critique of the}} background data literature. As a life history measure, the effective application of background data items {{is based on a}} developmental strategy in which a pattern of prior behavior and experiences is related to certain forms of criterion performance. This principle pro-vides a framework for discussing the various issues in-volved in generating an adequate pool of background data items. The four principal methods for scaling background data items are examined: rational scaling, factorial scaling, empirical keying, and subgrouping. The relative strengths and weaknesses of these four techniques are considered along with current research needs in each area. This review indicates that substan-tial {{progress has been made in}} the development and application of background data measures, but that al-ternatives to the traditional empirical keying strategy should receive more attention. From the earliest days of psychological mea-surement, past behavior has been found to be an effective predictor of future behavior. Thus, psy-chologists have long displayed an interest in the potential applications of life history information (Dailey, 1960; Galton, 1883). Descriptions of an individual’s life history may be cast in many forms, ranging from diaries and narrative biographies to quantified demographic data. While all these mea-sures have substantial value, psychometricians have come to rely on a particular form of life history information, referred to as scored autobiographical data or background data, to address a variety of pragmatic problems arising in the areas of selec-tion, placement, and differential diagnosis. The following discussion will review the available evi-dence pertaining to the development and scaling of background data items. Historic Considerations The modem background data form represents an outgrowth of the job <b>application</b> <b>blank.</b> Ferguson (1962) reported that the first mention of standard-ized questions concerning an individual’s life his...|$|E

40|$|This {{study found}} mixed {{support for the}} {{hypothesis}} that the difference in criterion-related validity between unstructured and structured employment interviews is due solely to the greater reliability of structured interviews. Using data from prior meta-analyses, this hypothesis was tested in 4 data sets by using standard psychometric procedures to remove the effects of measurement error in interview scores from correlations with rated job performance and training performance. In the 1 st data set, support was found for this hypothesis. However, in a 2 nd data set structured interviews had higher true score correlations with performance ratings, and in 2 other data sets unstructured interviews had higher true score correlations. We also found that averaging across 3 to 4 independent unstructured interviews provides the same level of validity for predicting job performance as a structured interview administered by a single interviewer. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed. Employment interviews are part of the hiring process for virtu-ally all jobs. Only reviews of resumes and <b>application</b> <b>blanks</b> are used more frequently in selection (Ash, 1982; Dipboye, 1994, 1997; Dipboye & Jackson, 1999). As a result, industrial/organiza-tional psychologists have devoted much research to the validity of employment interviews. It is now well established that structured employment interviews have higher criterion-related validity for predicting job perfor-mance than do unstructured interviews. This finding has been consistent across three major meta-analyses (Huffcutt & Arthur...|$|R
