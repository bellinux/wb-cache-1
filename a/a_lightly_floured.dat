50|$|The dough for kesme usually {{consists}} of flour, water, salt, and an egg. The dough is rolled {{out into a}} large thin circle, and left to dry for a while. It is then <b>lightly</b> <b>floured,</b> folded over several times accordion-style, and sliced into strips, which are then separated. The process has been illustrated, step by step. The kesme may be boiled immediately in a broth often containing ingredients such as potatoes, meat, carrots, peppers, and tomatoes, or left to harden and stored. Kesme is often made in a kazan.|$|R
5000|$|Elena Molokhovets's classic Russian {{cookbook}} A Gift to Young Housewives {{gives the}} first known recipe for Govjadina po-strogonovski, s gorchitseju, [...] "Beef à la Stroganov, with mustard", in its 1871 edition. The recipe involves <b>lightly</b> <b>floured</b> beef cubes (not strips) sautéed, sauced with prepared mustard and bouillon, and finished {{with a small amount}} of sour cream: no onions, no mushrooms. A competition purported to have taken place in 1890 is sometimes mentioned in the dish's history, but both the recipe and the name existed before then. Another recipe, this one from 1909, adds onions and tomato sauce, and serves it with crisp potato straws, which are considered the traditional side dish for Beef Stroganoff in Russia. [...] The version given in the 1938 Larousse Gastronomique includes beef strips, and onions, with either mustard or tomato paste optional.|$|R
