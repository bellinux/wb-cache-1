25|$|Complex {{social network}} {{analysis}} is used to study the dynamics of large, complex social networks. Dynamic network analysis brings together traditional {{social network analysis}}, link analysis and multi-agent systems within network science and network theory. Through the use of key concepts and methods in social network analysis, agent-based modeling, theoretical physics, and modern mathematics (particularly graph theory and fractal geometry), this method of inquiry brought insights into the dynamics and structure of social systems. New computational methods of localized social network analysis <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> {{of the work of}} Duncan Watts, Albert-László Barabási, Nicholas A. Christakis, Kathleen Carley and others.|$|E
25|$|Alexander Parks {{and others}} have {{identified}} libraries as potentially important safe places for LGBTQ youth and teens, especially {{in the face of}} bullying. He suggests the inclusion of LGBTQ titles in library displays or book talks to promote greater visibility. However, according to an 2005 study by Ann Curry, though many LGBTQ teens have the very similar concerns to their adult counterparts, librarians often do not answer their questions related to LGBTQ topics in a sensitive or welcoming manner. Studies by Carmichael and Greenblatt have emphasized that the library is an important place for teens who <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> to find information because of the potential anonymity it provides. In his examination of public libraries in areas with large concentrations of same-sex families, Naidoo finds that many children's librarians are unaware of the LGBTQ families in their community and provide a mixed-bag of services, collections, and programs.|$|E
25|$|Villeneuve led {{the rest}} of his fleet into Cadiz on 21 August 1805, and the Sirius was sent to form part of the British fleet blockading them there. With Nelson's arrival to take command of the fleet, the main body was moved out to sea, with a chain of four frigates and four ships of the line {{established}} to observe the fleet in Cadiz and transmit signals about their movements to the British fleet. Sirius was the closest to the port and at first light on 19 October it was observed that the enemy were preparing to put to sea. Sirius immediately signalled the next frigate in the line, Henry Blackwood's , 'Enemy have their topsails hoisted'. Thus Prowse began the process that would lead to the interception of the combined fleet two days later. An hour later at 7 a.m. Sirius ran up three flags to signal code number 370, 'Enemy ships <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> of port or getting under sail'. The signal was repeated down the line, reaching Nelson 48 miles away aboard HMS Victory at 9.30 a.m.|$|E

500|$|Attendance at Gay Pride marches {{during the}} summer of 1978 in Los Angeles and San Francisco swelled. An {{estimated}} 250,000 to 375,000 attended San Francisco's Gay Freedom Day Parade; newspapers claimed the higher numbers were due to John Briggs. Organizers asked participants to carry signs indicating their hometowns for the cameras, to show how far people came to live in the Castro District. Milk rode in an open car carrying a sign saying [...] "I'm from Woodmere, N.Y." [...] He gave a version of what became his most famous speech, the [...] "Hope Speech", that The San Francisco Examiner said [...] "ignited the crowd":On this anniversary of Stonewall, I ask my gay sisters and brothers to make the commitment to fight. For themselves, for their freedom, for their country... We will not win our rights by staying quietly in our closets... We <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> to fight the lies, the myths, the distortions.

500|$|Parks and Recreation {{was rushed}} into {{production}} {{for the pilot}} to meet the April 9 premiere date. As a result, when the series was paneled at a January 2009 television critics press tour, NBC {{did not have a}} finished episode to air, and only had a copy of the pilot episode script available for critics to review. Some of the parts were not yet cast, and without a finalized title, the series was known only as The Untitled Amy Poehler Project or TUAPP. Alan Sepinwall, television writer for The Star-Ledger, said he found the script very funny even though he normally hates reading comedy scripts [...] "because they're rarely as funny on the page as they <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> of an actor's mouth".|$|E

500|$|Who TISM are {{beneath the}} masks {{has been the}} cause of much {{speculation}} by fans, with one theory contending that TISM is composed of members of other bands {{who do not want}} their fans to find out: popular targets of this theory include Painters and Dockers, Machine Gun Fellatio and even The Wiggles. A theory based on the band's tour schedule's roughly coinciding with school holidays, {{and the fact that the}} Ringwood Secondary College Choir and Orchestra feature in the filmclip to Thunderbirds <b>Are</b> <b>Coming</b> <b>Out,</b> proposes that TISM are school teachers. Another common theory, based on the high incidence of football references in their lyrics, is that they are Australian rules football players in the AFL, however Humphrey B. Flaubert has stated that [...] "We're actually not AFL, we're more violent and crappy... so you're looking at the VFL there." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{cover story}} for Entertainment Weekly, Mars stated that the song [...] "Nothin' on You" [...] was {{rejected}} by a [...] "music industry decision-maker" [...] (a person he won't name) because of his race. That experience made him feel like a [...] "mutant", {{and he says that}} was his lowest point. [...] "Even with that song in my back pocket to seal the deal, things like that <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> of people's mouths. It made me feel like I wasn't even in the room." [...] In April 2013, in {{a cover story}} for GQ magazine, Mars confessed that he changed his surname because people in the music industry took him as another Latino artist, and even tried to convince him to sing in Spanish saying: [...] "Your last name's Hernandez, maybe you should do the Latin music, this Spanish music... Enrique [...] is so hot right now”. Nevertheless, Mars used his childhood nickname Bruno and changed his surname to Mars, in an effort to [...] "avoid being stereotyped".|$|E
500|$|When [...] "Nothin' on You" [...] {{was being}} showed to {{different}} [...] "music industry decision-makers", {{one of those}} individuals tried to give the song to a [...] "blue-eyed blonde" [...] artist instead of Mars, due to his race.

Mars concluded, [...] "Even with that song in my back pocket to seal the deal, things like that <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> of people's mouths. It {{made me feel like}} I wasn't even in the room." [...] According to American record producer Jim Jonsin, Atlantic Records' chairman, Craig Kallman, wanted him to work on the track for Lupe Fiasco. However, Jonsin pressured Kallman to give the song to B.o.B. Lupe stated that Kallman told him his lyrics and performance on the record were [...] "wack". Lupe claimed that this repeated denigration from the label drove him to a breaking point, and to feel [...] "suicidal". Afterwards, his verses were removed and new ones were written by Mars and B.o.B. An unmixed version of the song with Fiasco's verses and Mars' vocals leaked later in the same year.|$|E

500|$|The {{story was}} {{supposed}} {{to continue with the}} English plot of the first Blaster Master game. The Plutonium Boss originally intended to inject Jason and Fred with microbots that, even if Jason managed to defeat him, would kill both Jason and Fred, but he could only inject Fred. Jason and SOPHIA the 3rd are then shrunken and injected inside Fred to do battle with the microbots and their contraptions – something which Ireland described as [...] "a pretty clear video game spin on Fantastic Voyage kind of adventure". It was planned to be released for the Virtual Console on [...] for 500Wii points. IGN's Daemon Hatfield, after discovering nothing about Blaster Master: Destination Fred in any video game archives, suspected that this was an April Fools' Day hoax; he said, however, that after the release of Dark Void Zero it was possible for Sunsoft to release a new 8-bit title. Destructoid's Conrad Zimmerman strongly suspected that this was also a hoax; he said that there was no proof of the game's existence except for it temporarily being mentioned on Wikipedia and that [...] "Nintendo never lets anybody say when their games <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> on Virtual Console". Sunsoft later confirmed on their website that the sequel was an April Fools' Day hoax.|$|E
500|$|Karen Foss, a {{communications}} {{professor at the}} University of New Mexico, attributes Milk's impact on San Francisco politics {{to the fact that}} he was unlike anyone else who had held public office in the city. She writes, [...] "Milk happened to be a highly energetic, charismatic figure with a love of theatrics and nothing to lose... Using laughter, reversal, transcendence, and his insider/outsider status, Milk helped create a climate in which dialogue on issues became possible. He also provided a means to integrate the disparate voices of his various constituencies." [...] Milk had been a rousing speaker since he began campaigning in 1973, and his oratory skills only improved after he became City Supervisor. His most famous talking points became known as the [...] "Hope Speech", which became a staple throughout his political career. It opened with a play on the accusation that gay people recruit impressionable youth into their numbers: [...] "My name is Harvey Milk—and I want to recruit you." [...] A version of the Hope Speech that he gave near the end of his life was considered by his friends and aides to be the best, and the closing the most effective: And the young gay people in the Altoona, Pennsylvanias and the Richmond, Minnesotas who <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> and hear Anita Bryant in television and her story. The only thing they have to look forward to is hope. And you have to give them hope. Hope for a better world, hope for a better tomorrow, hope for a better place to come to if the pressures at home are too great. Hope that all will be all right. Without hope, not only gays, but the blacks, the seniors, the handicapped, the us'es, the us'es will give up. And if you help elect to the central committee and other offices, more gay people, that gives a green light to all who feel disenfranchised, a green light to move forward. It means hope to a nation that has given up, because if a gay person makes it, the doors are open to everyone.|$|E

[...] The polymer is only used on the lower frame and joined to a metal alloy upper frame, barrel, and cylinder. Polymer technology {{is considered one of}} the major advancements in revolver history because the frame has always been metal alloy and mostly one piece frame design.|$|E

2500|$|Every {{coming out}} {{story is the}} person {{trying to come to}} terms with who they are and their sexual orientation. Several models have been created to {{describe}} coming out as a process for gay and lesbian identity development, e.g. Dank, 1971; Cass, 1984; Coleman, 1989; Troiden, 1989. Of these models, the most widely accepted is the Cass identity model established by Vivienne Cass. This model outlines six discrete stages transited by individuals who successfully come out: identity confusion, identity comparison, identity tolerance, identity acceptance, identity pride, and identity synthesis. However, not every LGBT person follows such a model. For example, some LGBT youth become aware of and accept their same-sex desires or gender identity at puberty in a way similar to which heterosexual teens become aware of their sexuality, i.e. free of any notion of difference, stigma or shame in terms of the gender of the people to whom they are attracted. [...] Regardless of whether LGBT youth develop their identity based on a model, the typical age at which youth in the United States come out has been dropping. High school students and even middle school students <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
