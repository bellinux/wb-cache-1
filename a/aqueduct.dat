5|$|An <b>aqueduct</b> {{carrying}} the West Branch Canal once crossed Muncy Creek.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on April 15, 1978, during racing season one train {{ran from}} 57th Street on the IND Sixth Avenue Line to <b>Aqueduct</b> Racetrack, leaving 57th Street at 11 A.M. and {{arriving}} at <b>Aqueduct</b> at 11:35 AM. The train {{left for the}} return trip after the final race.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{proceeded}} quickly, but disaster almost struck {{when the}} <b>aqueduct</b> was first {{filled with water}} {{and one of its}} three arches began to buckle under the weight. Remedial work took several months, but the <b>aqueduct</b> was still opened to traffic only 15 months after the enabling Act of Parliament had been passed, on 17 July 1761. It remained in use for more than 100 years, until the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal necessitated its demolition in 1893, replaced by the Barton Swing <b>Aqueduct.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>aqueducts</b> of the C&O, {{unlike the}} Roman <b>aqueducts,</b> were built with {{inferior}} materials and cement, {{and did not}} have a long life expectancy. Usually the trash from the floods did the most harm to the <b>aqueducts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Cantalloc <b>aqueducts</b> {{are located}} 4 km {{north of the}} city of Nasca. They were built by the Nasca culture. More than 40 <b>aqueducts</b> were built, which were used all year round. There are other <b>aqueducts</b> in {{different}} parts of the city.|$|R
50|$|The ancient {{people of}} Peru built water-moving and {{preserving}} technologies like the <b>aqueducts</b> of Cumbe Mayo (c. 1500 BCE) or the Nazca's underground <b>aqueducts</b> called Puquios (date uncertain), or the terraced gardens of the Huari. <b>Aqueducts</b> were also utilized by the Moche.|$|R
5|$|In 1907, {{there was}} a {{proposal}} to construct buildings {{on top of the}} <b>aqueduct,</b> with its arches effectively serving as an arcade. The Office of the Public Works drew up plans for these buildings, but eventually nothing materialized. The <b>aqueduct</b> remained in use until the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, the New York Racing Association {{chose to}} upgrade <b>Aqueduct</b> Racetrack in South Ozone Park {{in part because}} of its {{proximity}} to the Rockaway Beach Branch. As part of the modernization of the racetrack, the Racing Association built a station with ramps leading directly to the track and facilities that could handle racetrack crowds. Once the work was finished, it was handed over to the city. The new station was for northbound trains to Brooklyn and Manhattan, and it was built north of the existing <b>Aqueduct</b> station. In order to allow for the switching maneuvers required for southbound trains to stop at the station, major signal changes were made on the line. The single-platform station was built by <b>Aqueduct</b> Racetrack owners at the cost of $1 million. The <b>Aqueduct</b> Racetrack station opened on September 14, 1959, on the same date as the renovated <b>Aqueduct</b> Racetrack.|$|E
5|$|On 9 January 1610, {{works on}} the <b>aqueduct</b> {{continued}} {{under the direction of}} another Jesuit called Padre Natale Tomasucci. By this time, Garzez had died and was succeeded as Grand Master by Alof de Wignacourt. In July 1612, the Bolognese hydraulic expert Bontadino de Bontadini took over the project, probably on the recommendation of Inquisitor Evangelista Carbonesi. Bontadini designed a new watercourse with water being carried through underwater pipes, and over stone arches when there were depressions in the ground. Bontadini was assisted by a Maltese capomastro Giovanni Attard and several other engineers. 600 local workers were employed {{in the construction of the}} <b>aqueduct,</b> which was completed in 1614 and inaugurated on 21 April 1615. The <b>aqueduct</b> cost a total of 434,605 scudi, most of which were paid by Grand Master Wignacourt. The <b>aqueduct</b> was therefore named in his honour.|$|E
2500|$|The Canal du Midi is 240km {{long with}} a total of [...] 328 {{structures}} including 63 locks, 126 bridges, 55 <b>aqueducts,</b> 7 <b>aqueducts,</b> 6 dams, 1 spillway, and 1 tunnel.|$|R
50|$|Although {{particularly}} {{associated with}} the Romans, <b>aqueducts</b> were likely first used by the Minoans around 2000 BCE. The Minoans had developed what was then an extremely advanced irrigation system, including several <b>aqueducts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Aqueducts,</b> {{which were}} built during the Hasmonean period, enabled the {{construction}} of the winter palaces and the farm. Two <b>aqueducts</b> brought water to the site from the following springs that flow year-round: ...|$|R
5|$|The 400th {{anniversary of}} the <b>aqueduct</b> was commemorated on 21 April 2015. A {{ceremony}} was held in Valletta, with schoolchildren carrying water from City Gate to St. George's Square, where a re-enactment of the inauguration of the <b>aqueduct</b> was held.|$|E
5|$|The Pont du Gard is {{an ancient}} Roman <b>aqueduct</b> that crosses the Gardon River {{near the town of}} Vers-Pont-du-Gard in {{southern}} France. The Pont du Gard is the highest of all elevated Roman aqueducts, and, along with the <b>Aqueduct</b> of Segovia, one of the best preserved. It was added to UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites in 1985 because of its historical importance.|$|E
5|$|The <b>aqueduct</b> {{remained}} in use until the 20th century. Most of its arches still survive today, and {{can still be}} seen in the localities of Attard, Balzan, Birkirkara, Fleur-de-Lys and Santa Venera. Other remains of the <b>aqueduct</b> include water towers at Santa Venera, Ħamrun and Floriana, and several fountains in Floriana and Valletta.|$|E
50|$|Another use for <b>aqueducts</b> is {{to supply}} large cities with {{drinking}} water. It also help drought prone areas with water supplies. Some of the Roman <b>aqueducts</b> still supply water to Rome today. In California, United States, three large <b>aqueducts</b> supply water {{over hundreds of}} miles to the Los Angeles area. Two are from the Owens River area, and a third is from the Colorado River.|$|R
5000|$|Sextus Julius Frontinus is {{appointed}} {{superintendent of}} the <b>aqueducts</b> (curator aquarum) in Rome. At least 10 <b>aqueducts</b> supply the city with [...] of water per day, the public baths used half the supply.|$|R
50|$|The {{latter two}} <b>aqueducts</b> provide 90% of New York City's {{drinking}} water. Water from both <b>aqueducts</b> is stored {{first in the}} large Kensico Reservoir and subsequently in the much smaller Hillview Reservoir closer to the city.|$|R
5|$|The <b>aqueduct</b> {{was built}} of local limestone. Stones were {{attached}} {{with the use}} of pozzolana. It was this successful feature that gave most praise to Bontadini. The <b>aqueduct</b> supplied water to cisterns in private and public buildings, to ships in Marsamxett Harbour and Grand Harbour, and to fountains which generally included a water trough.|$|E
5|$|The <b>aqueduct</b> was {{improved}} by Grand Master Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc in 1780. On 4 September 1798, {{in the early}} stages of the Maltese uprising against the French, insurgents ambushed French soldiers near the <b>aqueduct</b> at Mrieħel, in the limits of Birkirkara.|$|E
5|$|The {{city was}} {{supplied}} with water by an <b>aqueduct</b> that ran from a {{spring in the}} hills behind the city. The <b>aqueduct</b> may have been constructed around 60–80AD and was subsequently reconstructed on several occasions. An elaborate network of channels fed houses and the public baths from the municipal supply {{and a series of}} drains carried sewage and waste away to the river to be flushed. The <b>aqueduct</b> ran under the Decumanus Secundus, a street that ran parallel with the Decumanus Maximus, and terminated at a large fountain in the city centre near the Arch of Caracalla.|$|E
50|$|The Romans {{constructed}} numerous <b>aqueducts</b> {{to supply}} water to cities and industrial sites and {{to aid in}} their agriculture. The city of Rome was supplied by 11 <b>aqueducts</b> with a combined length of 350 km. Most <b>aqueducts</b> were constructed below the surface, with only small portions above ground supported by arches. Sometimes, where valleys deeper than 500 m had to be crossed, inverted siphons were used to convey water across a valley.|$|R
5000|$|In the 2nd century, Lugdunum prospered {{and grew}} to a {{population}} of 40,000 to 200,000 persons. Four <b>aqueducts</b> brought water to the city's fountains, public baths, and wealthy homes. The <b>aqueducts</b> were well engineered and included several siphons.|$|R
50|$|The Romans {{constructed}} numerous <b>aqueducts</b> {{throughout the}} Empire to bring water into cities and towns—often from distant sources. The water supplied public baths, latrines, fountains, and private households. <b>Aqueducts</b> also provided water for mining operations, milling, farms, and gardens.|$|R
5|$|The {{construction}} of the Manchester Ship Canal provided many local residents with jobs; 1,888people were employed on {{the section of the}} new canal at Barton. A stone <b>aqueduct</b> over the River Iwell dating from 1761 and designed by James Brindley was demolished and replaced by a new moveable aqueduct: the Barton Swing <b>Aqueduct.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the <b>aqueduct</b> has long been credited to the Roman emperor Augustus' son-in-law and aide, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, around the year 19 BC. At the time, he was serving as aedile, the senior magistrate responsible for managing the water supply of Rome and its colonies. Espérandieu, writing in 1926, linked the {{construction of}} the <b>aqueduct</b> with Agrippa's visit to Narbonensis in that year. Newer excavations suggest the construction may have taken place between 40 and 60 AD. Tunnels dating from the time of Augustus had to be bypassed by the builders of the Nîmes <b>aqueduct,</b> and coins discovered in the outflow in Nîmes are no older than the reign of the emperor Claudius (41–54 AD). On this basis, a team led by Guilhem Fabre has argued that the <b>aqueduct</b> must have been completed around the middle of the 1st century AD. It is believed to have taken about fifteen years to build, employing between 800 and 1,000 workers.|$|E
5|$|The {{main problem}} with {{upgrading}} the Wakefield branch was {{the dimensions of}} George Leather's cast iron <b>aqueduct</b> over the River Calder at Stanley Ferry. Structural analysis showed that parts of the ironwork were overloaded, and so in 1981 a new concrete <b>aqueduct</b> was cast by John Laing Construction Ltd, on a site a little further upstream. The complete structure was then pushed into position by hydraulic jacks in a six-day operation, after which the navigation was diverted over it, although the old <b>aqueduct</b> was left in place and can still be used.|$|E
40|$|Drop {{structures}} and stepped cascades {{have been used}} for over 3, 000 years. In particular, Roman engineers designed stepped spillways successfully in Tunisia, Syria, Spain and Iraq. There is however little information available on the hydraulics of supercritical flows in Roman <b>aqueducts.</b> Some believe that these <b>aqueducts</b> were designed and operated with subcritical flows, and that no energy dissipation device was required. The writer shows that Roman <b>aqueducts</b> included some very-steep sections (i. e. bed slope up to 78...|$|R
50|$|This bridge {{proves the}} high level of stone bridge {{technology}} {{at the time it was}} built. Yasunosuke Futa (1801-1873), who was the head of the then Yabe village, planned and after funding, with the help of the group of 41 stone technicians and many farmers, succeeded in building the bridge in 1854. Its purpose was to let water flow into a higher area (Shiroito Plateau) for farming. After placing wooden frames, stones were placed on the frames, and three stone <b>aqueducts</b> were made. After that, the wooden frames were removed. Because the <b>aqueducts</b> were lower than the upper part of the waterway by 6 meters, a reversed siphon mechanism works when man lets water flow through the <b>aqueducts.</b> The stone <b>aqueducts</b> were made watertight with mortar. The bridge was completed in 1854. In order to keep the <b>aqueducts</b> in a perfect condition, water is poured into the river once in a while.|$|R
50|$|The {{complex of}} Domitian's Villa is {{supplied}} by four <b>aqueducts</b> all {{coming from the}} southeast from sources located between the towns of Palazzolo and Malafitto. In many places, ancient <b>aqueducts</b> still feed modern ones or have been in use until a few decades ago.|$|R
5|$|A {{roundabout}} with {{a fountain}} was later {{built on the}} site of the arch. Some arches of the <b>aqueduct</b> were demolished in order to widen the road and make way for this roundabout.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Greene {{served on}} court-martial duty {{for a year}} and then {{returned}} to civil engineering in New York and Washington, D.C. From 1867 to 1871 he was the chief engineer commissioner of the Croton <b>Aqueduct</b> Department in New York. At the age of 86, he inspected the entire 30-mile Croton <b>Aqueduct</b> structure on foot. He {{served as president of the}} American Society of Civil Engineers from 1875 to 1877 and president of the New York Genealogical and Biographical Society. He was appointed to West Point's Board of Visitors in 1881.|$|E
5|$|Between 2004 and 2005, the aqueduct's {{surviving}} arches were {{restored and}} a lighting system was installed, {{at a total}} cost of Lm 140,000. Some of the arches {{are in need of}} restoration once again, mainly because of pollution since a major road now runs alongside the <b>aqueduct.</b> A section of the <b>aqueduct</b> was extensively damaged in December 2013 due to a car crash, but the damage has since been repaired.|$|E
50|$|The Indian subcontinent is {{believed}} to have some of the earliest <b>aqueducts.</b> Evidence {{can be found at the}} sites of present-day Hampi, Karnataka. The massive <b>aqueducts</b> near river Tungabhadra supplying irrigation water were once 15 mi long. The waterways supplied water to royal bath tubs.|$|R
40|$|Underground <b>aqueducts</b> {{represent}} a valuable {{documentation of the}} skill and engineering techniques of the ancient communities; {{at the same time}} they are among the main works that testify the efforts by man to manage the territory, and to develop urban civilizations. Since 2003 the Italian Speleological Society has started a nationwide project entirely dedicated to ancient underground aqueducts: “The Map of Ancient <b>Aqueducts</b> of Italy” has allowed so far to collect information on more than 140 <b>aqueducts.</b> In many cases, due to the mostly underground development, these works have been preserved intact for millennia. Following such an activity, a bibliographic analysis was started about underground <b>aqueducts</b> in the world, also aimed at attracting the interest of other scholars in different parts of the world about this topic...|$|R
