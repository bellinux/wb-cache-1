5|$|Despite its title, {{the novel}} does {{not so much}} deal with the crime and its formal punishment, as with Raskolnikov's {{internal}} struggle (the book shows that his punishment results more from his conscience than from the law). Believing society {{would be better for}} it, Raskolnikov commits murder with the idea that he possessed enough intellectual and emotional fortitude to deal with the ramifications, , but his sense of guilt soon overwhelms him to the point of psychological <b>and</b> <b>somatic</b> illness. It is only in the epilogue that he realizes his formal punishment, having decided to confess and end his alienation from society.|$|E
5|$|In 1958 Gustav Nossal and Lederberg {{showed that}} one B cell always {{produces}} only one antibody, {{which was the}} first evidence for clonal selection theory. Burnet wrote further about the theory in his 1959 book The Clonal Selection Theory of Acquired Immunity. His theory predicted almost all of the key features of the immune system as we understand it today, including autoimmune disease, immune tolerance <b>and</b> <b>somatic</b> hypermutation as a mechanism in antibody production. The clonal selection theory became one of the central concepts of immunology, and Burnet regarded his contributions to the theoretical understanding of the immune system as his greatest contribution to science, writing that he and Jerne should have received the Nobel for this work. Jerne was recognised for his contributions to the conceptualisation of the immune system when he was a co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in 1984.|$|E

25|$|In some animals, in {{addition}} to expelling waste material, urination can mark territory or express submissiveness. Physiologically, urination involves coordination between the central, autonomic, <b>and</b> <b>somatic</b> nervous systems. Brain centers that regulate urination include the pontine micturition center, periaqueductal gray, and the cerebral cortex. In placental mammals, urine is drained through the urinary meatus, a urethral opening in the male penis or female vulval vestibule.|$|E
25|$|The {{distinction}} between germline <b>and</b> <b>somatic</b> mutations {{is important in}} animals that have a dedicated germline to produce reproductive cells. However, it is of little value in understanding the effects of mutations in plants, which lack dedicated germline.

Methods: In this cohort study with 2 -year follow-up of 1381 nurses, baseline SF- 12 scores were analyzed against registered mental, musculoskeletal, <b>and</b> other <b>somatic</b> LTSA during follow-up by logistic regression models. Results: The SF- 12 dimensions, general health, vitality, emotional role limitations, mental health, and social functioning, predicted mental LTSA. Physical functioning, bodily pain, and vitality predicted musculoskeletal LTSA, and physical role limitations, bodily pain, general health, and social functioning predicted other somatic LTSA. Positive predictive values were low, and negative predictive values were high. Conclusions: Different SF- 12 dimensions predicted mental, musculoskeletal, <b>and</b> other <b>somatic</b> LTSA but did not identify nurses {{at high risk of}} mental, musculoskeletal, <b>and</b> other <b>somatic</b> LTSA...|$|R
25|$|Human {{trafficking}} victims {{may experience}} complex trauma {{as a result}} of repeated cases of intimate relationship trauma {{over long periods of time}} including, but not limited to, sexual abuse, domestic violence, forced prostitution, or gang rape. Complex trauma involves multifaceted conditions of depression, anxiety, self-hatred, dissociation, substance abuse, self-destructive behaviors, medical <b>and</b> <b>somatic</b> concerns, despair, and revictimization. Psychology researchers report that, although similar to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), Complex trauma is more expansive in diagnosis because of the effects of prolonged trauma.|$|E
25|$|The {{individual}} agent develops these dispositions {{in response}} to the objective conditions it encounters. In this way Bourdieu theorizes the inculcation of objective social structures into the subjective, mental experience of agents. For the objective social field places requirements on its participants for membership, so to speak, within the field. Having thereby absorbed objective social structure into a personal set of cognitive <b>and</b> <b>somatic</b> dispositions, and the subjective structures of action of the agent then being commensurate with the objective structures and extant exigencies of the social field, a doxic relationship emerges.|$|E
25|$|Next, the {{significance}} of this newly identified relay system was evaluated by placing lesions in the medial and lateral portions of the front of the midbrain. Cats with mesancephalic interruptions to the ARAS entered into a deep sleep and displayed corresponding brain waves. In alternative fashion, cats with similarly placed interruptions to ascending auditory <b>and</b> <b>somatic</b> pathways exhibited normal sleeping and wakefulness, and could be awakened with somatic stimuli. Because these external stimuli would be blocked by the interruptions, this indicated that the ascending transmission must travel through the newly discovered ARAS.|$|E

25|$|REM sleep {{physiology}} <b>and</b> <b>somatic</b> symptoms {{coupled with}} the awareness that one is paralyzed, can generate a variety of psychological symptoms during sleep paralysis, including fear and worry that are aggravated by catastrophic cognitions about the attack. This can activate a fight-flight reaction and panic-like arousal. Consequently, when the person attempts to escape the paralysis, somatic symptoms and arousal are exacerbated, as execution of motor programs {{in the absence of}} dampening proprioceptive feedback can lead to heightened sensations of bodily tightness and pressure, and even pain and spasms in limbs.|$|E
25|$|Harvey Irwin (1985) {{presented}} {{a theory of}} the OBE involving attentional cognitive processes <b>and</b> <b>somatic</b> sensory activity. His theory involved a cognitive personality construct known as psychological absorption and gave instances of the classification of an OBE as examples of autoscopy, depersonalization and mental dissociation. The psychophysiologist Stephen Laberge (1985) has written that the explanation for OBEs {{can be found in}} lucid dreaming. David Hufford (1989) linked the OBE experience with a phenomenon he described as a nightmare waking experience, a type of sleep paralysis. Other scientists have also linked OBEs to cases of hypnagogia and sleep paralysis (cataplexy).|$|E
25|$|ADPKD is genetically {{heterogeneous}} {{with two}} genes identified: PKD1 (chromosome region 16p13.3; around 85% cases) and PKD2 (4q21; around 15% cases). Several genetic mechanisms probably {{contribute to the}} phenotypic expression of the disease. Although there is evidence for a two-hit mechanism (germline <b>and</b> <b>somatic</b> inactivation of two PKD alleles) explaining the focal development of renal and hepatic cysts, haploinsufficiency {{is more likely to}} account for the vascular manifestations of the disease. Additionally, new mouse models homozygous for Pkd1 hypomorphic alleles 22 and 23 and the demonstration of increased renal epithelial cell proliferation in Pkd2+/− mice suggest that mechanisms other than the two-hit hypothesis also contribute to the cystic phenotype.|$|E

25|$|Chromothripsis is the {{phenomenon}} by which up {{to thousands of}} clustered chromosomal rearrangements occur in a single event in localised and confined genomic regions in {{one or a few}} chromosomes, and is known to be involved in both cancer and congenital diseases. It occurs through one massive genomic rearrangement during a single catastrophic event in the cell's history. It is believed that for the cell to be able to withstand such a destructive event, the occurrence of such an event must be the upper limit of what a cell can tolerate and survive.

25|$|Early Dzogchen was {{completely}} transformed in the 11th century, with the renaissance of Tibetan culture occurring {{from the late}} 10th century to the early 12th century,known as the later dissemination of Buddhism. New techniques and doctrines were introduced from India, resulting in new schools of Tibetan Buddhism, and radical new developments in Dzogchen doctrine and practice, with a growing emphasis on meditative practice. The older Bon and Nyingma traditions incorporated these new influences {{through the process of}} Treasure revelation. Especially the yogini tantras were influential, involving horrific imagery and violent rituals, erotic imagery, and sexual <b>and</b> <b>somatic</b> practices.

25|$|In {{spite of}} the {{historically}} few researchers studying limb regeneration, remarkable {{progress has been made}} recently in establishing the neotenous amphibian the axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) as a model genetic organism. This progress has been facilitated by advances in genomics, bioinformatics, <b>and</b> <b>somatic</b> cell transgenesis in other fields, that have created the opportunity to investigate the mechanisms of important biological properties, such as limb regeneration, in the axolotl. The Ambystoma Genetic Stock Center (AGSC) is a self-sustaining, breeding colony of the axolotl supported by the National Science Foundation as a Living Stock Collection. Located at the University of Kentucky, the AGSC is dedicated to supplying genetically well-characterized axolotl embryos, larvae, and adults to laboratories throughout the United States and abroad.

25|$|In healthy individuals, {{the lower}} urinary tract has two {{discrete}} phases of activity: the storage (or guarding) phase, when urine {{is stored in}} the bladder; and the voiding phase, when urine is released through the urethra. The state of the reflex system is dependent on both a conscious signal from the brain and the firing rate of sensory fibers from the bladder and urethra. At low bladder volumes, afferent firing is low, resulting in excitation of the outlet (the sphincter and urethra), and relaxation of the bladder. At high bladder volumes, afferent firing increases, causing a conscious sensation of urinary urge. When the individual is ready to urinate, he or she consciously initiates voiding, causing the bladder to contract and the outlet to relax. Voiding continues until the bladder empties completely, {{at which point the}} bladder relaxes and the outlet contracts to re-initiate storage. The muscles controlling micturition are controlled by the autonomic <b>and</b> <b>somatic</b> nervous systems. During the storage phase the internal urethral sphincter remains tense and the detrusor muscle relaxed by sympathetic stimulation. During micturition, parasympathetic stimulation causes the detrusor muscle to contract and the internal urethral sphincter to relax. The external urethral sphincter (sphincter urethrae) is under somatic control and is consciously relaxed during micturition.|$|E
25|$|The {{maintenance}} and {{improvement of quality}} of life during the menopausal period {{is at the core}} of estrogen and progestin-based hormone therapy. Both HRT and estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) have been shown to enhance sexual desire in a significant percent of women; however, as with all pharmacological treatments, not all women have been responsive, especially those with preexisting sexual difficulties. ERT restores vaginal cells, pH levels, and blood flow to the vagina, all of which deterioration are associated with the onset of menopause. Dyspareunia (due to vaginal dryness) appears to be the most responsive component of menopausal women’s sexuality to ERT. It also has been shown to have positive effects on the urinary tract and atrophy and may initially improve libido or sexual sensitivity. Other improvements in areas such as sexual desire, arousal, fantasies, and frequency of coitus and orgasm have also been noted. However, the effectiveness of ERT has been shown to decline in some women after long-term use. A number of studies have found that the combined effects of estrogen/androgen replacement therapy can increase a woman’s motivational aspects of sexual behaviour over and above what can be achieved with estrogen therapy alone. Findings on a relatively new form of HRT called tibolone— a synthetic steroid with estrogenic, androgenic, and progestogenic properties— suggest that it has the ability to improve mood, libido, <b>and</b> <b>somatic</b> symptoms of surgically menopausal women to a greater degree than ERT. In various placebo-controlled studies, improvements in vasomotor symptoms, emotional reactions, sleep disturbances, somatic symptoms, and sexual desire have been observed. However, while this is and has been available in Europe for almost two decades, this has not been approved for use in North America at this point.|$|E
