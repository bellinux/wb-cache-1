50|$|Creep is the {{permanent}} movement or deformation of a material {{in order to}} relieve stresses within the material. Concrete that is subjected to long-duration forces is prone to creep. Short-duration forces (such as wind or earthquakes) do not cause creep.

This review focuses on the significant developments of laboratory tools in the measurement <b>of</b> polymerization <b>shrinkage</b> and stresses <b>of</b> dental resin-based materials during polymerization. An electronic search of publications from January 1977 to July 2016 was made using ScienceDirect, PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar databases. The search included only English-language articles. Only studies that performed laboratory methods to evaluate the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> the polymerization <b>shrinkage</b> and/or stresses <b>of</b> dental resin-based materials during polymerization were selected.

40|$|A new {{patterning}} {{technique for}} the deposition of sol-gels and chemical solution precursors {{was developed to}} address some of the limitations of soft lithography approaches. When using micromolding in capillaries to pattern precursors that exhibit large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>shrinkage</b> during drying, topographical distortions develop. In place of patterning the elastomeric mold, the network of capillary channels was patterned directly into the substrate surface and an elastomer membrane is used to complete the channels. When the wetting properties of the substrate surfaces were carefully controlled using self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), lead zirconate titanate thin films with nearly rectangular cross-sections were successfully patterned. This technique, called microchannel molding (CM), also provided a method for aligning multiple layers such as bottom electrodes for device fabrication. I...|$|R
40|$|We propose {{and test}} a new {{approach}} for modeling consumer heterogeneity in conjoint estimation based on convex optimization and statistical machine learning. We develop methods both for metric and choice data. Like hierarchical Bayes (HB), our methods shrink individual-level partworth estimates towards a population mean.

As a result, the <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>shrinkage</b> differ between the two approaches, leading to different estimation accuracies. In our comparisons based on simulations as well as empirical data sets, the new approach overall outperforms standard HB (i. e., with relatively diffuse second-stage priors) both with metric and choice data...|$|R

By doing so, adaptive <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>shrinkage</b> {{can be applied to}} different loading coefficients according to their estimated relative importance, which naturally improves the efficiency of the estimation and selection results. Secondly, a BIC-type tuning parameter selector is developed for a consistent selection of the tuning parameters. We refer to our approach as the adaptive sparse principal component analysis (ASPCA). Asymptotic theory is established to support such a proposal and numerical studies are conducted to further demonstrate its usefulness...|$|R

40|$|Powder {{injection}} molded (PIM) parts usually show large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>shrinkage</b> after sintering {{due to the}} low powder loading, {{resulting in}} poor dimensional stability.

The results show that when an abrupt volume change occurs, as happens during the ! phase transformation of iron, the dimensional stability deteriorates. This problem gets worse when the density of the part is low. By slowing down the heating rate in the region where the high shrinkage rate occurs, avoiding the phase changes, and adding alloying elements to broaden the temperature range of the phase transformation, the dimensional control of ferrous PIM compacts can be improved...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate the castability, alloy solidification shrinkage and the riser design in particular, of low thermal expansion (LTE) cast irons with relatively low C and Si content (< 2. 0 %). The solidification temperatures as well as the solidification shrinkage and solid contraction were analyzed, and also the riser design was performed in this work. Thermal analyses results indicate that the alloy liquidus temperatures are closely related with the CE value. In addition, the <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> solidification <b>shrinkage</b> were measured to be around 5 % for 1 %C- 1 %Si- 35 %Ni FG irons, and around 6. 5 % for SG irons of similar compositions, with a difference of some 1. 5 %. Furthermore, the percent solidification shrinkage decreases as the Co content increases from nil to 6 % at a constant NiE, with a 0. 35 % reduction for each 1 % Co substitution for an equivalent <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> Ni.
