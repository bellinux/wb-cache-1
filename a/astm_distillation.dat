Using a sensitive balance with scale of 0. 001 g and <b>ASTM</b> <b>distillation</b> glassware, several petroleum and petroleum-derived samples have been analyzed by the thermogravimetric distillation method. When the <b>ASTM</b> <b>distillation</b> glassware {{is replaced by a}} micro-scale unit, sample size could be reduced from 100 g to 5 - 10 g. A computer program has been developed to transfer the data into a distillation plot, e. g. Weight Percent Distilled vs. Boiling Point. It also generates a report on the characteristic distillation parameters, such as, IBP (Initial Boiling Point), FBP (Final Boiling Point), and boiling point at 50 wt% distilled. Comparison of the boiling point distributions determined by TG (thermogravimetry) with those by SimDis GC (Simulated-Distillation Gas Chromatography) on two liquid fuel samples (i. e. a decanted oil and a filtered crude oil) are also discussed in this paper...|$|E

In this point, we have sought to identify and characterize the effect of the increase in the temperature of vacuum distillation on the separation and the modification of the constituents of atmospheric residue of crude oil whose origin is Arabian Light. This study has been carried out by several techniques of analysis such as the density (<b>ASTM</b> D 4052), <b>distillation</b> (<b>ASTM</b> D 1160), determination of heavy metals nickel and vanadium (IFP 9422), dosing of Conradson Carbon (ASTM D 189), dosing of asphaltenes (ASTM D 2549) and dosage of PCI (polycyclic aromatics) (ASTM D 5186).

40|$|Long run cycle {{experiments}} {{ranging from}} 30 - 300 hours {{were made to}} determine the effects of temperature and space velocity on the upgrading of SRC-II Light Ends Column Feed (LECF) produced at Pittsburg and Midway Coal Mining Company's SRC-II pilot plant. MSU's most promising catalyst C- 49 with a metal loading of 4 % CoO, 8 % MoO 3, 1 % NiO, and 8 % WO 3 was used in all the experiments. The liquid products were analyzed for their nitrogen and sulfur contents. The <b>ASTM</b> <b>distillation</b> yields were also obtained. Higher temperature and lower space velocities gave better denitrogenation, while desulfurization was not affected by the temperatures and space velocity in the range of study. A minimum temperature of 425 °C is needed to reduce the nitrogen content below the 0. 3 Wt % requirement. Higher temperatures also allowed the use of higher space velocities at the expense of greater coke formation. The best conditions for denitrogenation are an operating temperature of 500 °C and a liquid hourly space velocity of 1. 25 hr^- 1. STATEMENT OF PERMISSION to cop...|$|E
40|$|The fast {{depletion}} of petroleum {{crude oil reserves}} and the serious consideration of environmental issues make the implementation of sustainable energy sources a crucial issue worldwide. Biofuel derived from vegetable oils is receiving a great attention {{as one of the}} most suitable and logical alternatives of fossil fuels. Therefore, the production of petroleum-like fractions from nonedible oil extracted from jojoba seeds is the main objective of this study. Hydrocracking technique has been applied here, using a fixed bed high pressure flow reactor system and using zeolite as a catalyst. A series of experiments were carried out in the temperature ranges from 350 - 425 oC at the pressure of 1. 0 - 5. 0 MPa, liquid hour space velocity (LHSV) of 1 - 5 hr- 1, and H 2 to oil feed ratio of 1600 l/l in order to elucidate the influence of operating conditions on the quantity and quality of the biofuel attained. The major products obtained from hydrocracking of jojoba oil feedstock were organic liquid products contaminated with some water and gases. The yield and conversion were estimated. The cracked products were analyzed and compared with that of the feed via FTIR, GC, <b>ASTM</b> <b>distillation,</b> and some routine testes. The organic liquid layers were fractionated to gasoline, kerosene, and gas oil. The results reveal that the main constituent lies in the gasoline range, which was favored at high temperature and pressure and low LHSV...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{method has}} been {{developed}} to determine experimental equilibrium distillation curves using a modified <b>ASTM</b> D 86 <b>distillation</b> apparatus. The method determines accurate equilibrium initial boiling points and accounts for the dynamic holdup inherent in distillation curves measured {{in accordance with the}} ASTM D 86 standard. In this work, the <b>ASTM</b> D 86 <b>distillation</b> setup has been modified to simultaneously measure liquid and vapor temperature using two resistance temperature detectors (RTDs) and a data acquisition system has been employed to record temperature data at one-second time intervals for the duration of each distillation. Additionally, the time for each volume recovery point is recorded. The method presented here uses the time-resolved liquid temperature data to identify the true initial boiling point (IBP) of four fuel mixtures of known composition; the IBPs are within 2 °C of the calculated equilibrium values. The time-resolved volume recovery information and the identified initial boiling point time are used to construct a volume evaporated versus time curve. The measured temperatures determined at the corresponding volume evaporated increments provide an experimental equilibrium distillation curve (EEDC). The EEDCs for the four fuel mixtures of known composition match the calculated equilibrium curves within a few degrees Celsius; a maximum mean absolute error of 2. 2 ± 1. 4 °C was observed. The dynamic holdup (volume difference between volume evaporated and volume recovered) associated with a distillation is found to correlate with the initial boiling point of the fuel being distilled and the temperature of the condenser bath used in the experiment. The method was also applied to measure EEDCs for a gasoline fuel and a diesel fuel, where the compositions were unknown, to investigate the differences between the EEDCs and the <b>ASTM</b> D 86 <b>distillation</b> curves. The results highlight the large errors incurred when using ASTM D 86 results to approximate equilibrium distillation curves...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reports a}} model to predict the {{auto-ignition}} time of single droplets of n-paraffin fuel mixtures using the method of continuous thermodynamics. The model uses experimental data for pure fuels to fit rate parameters for a single-step global chemical reaction equation; from this, correlations for rate parameters {{as a function of}} species molecular mass are derived, which are integrated to produce a continuous thermodynamics expression for mixture reaction rate. Experiments were carried out using the suspended droplet-moving furnace technique. The model was then tested and compared to experimental data for three continuous mixtures with known compositions: one ranging from ¬n-octane to n-hexadecane, the second ranging from n-dodecane to n-eicosane, and the third being a combination of the first two mixtures to produce a “dumbbell” mixture. Discrete and continuous mixture models of the <b>ASTM</b> standard <b>distillation</b> test were compared to design the experimental mixtures and provide the distribution parameters of the continuous mixtures intended to simulate them. The results of calculations were found to agree very well with measured ignition times for the mixtures...|$|R
40|$|A simple {{criterion}} {{for the evaluation}} of the performance of refinery strippers has been developed. The criterion is based on the gradient of the distillation curve of the stripped product under examination. The methodology can also be applied to process simulators to evaluate the effect of operating condition changes on the strippers' performance. The criterion is simple and its parameters, the <b>ASTM</b> D- 86 <b>distillation</b> curve gradients between the 0 - 5 % or 5 - 10 % points, can easily be calculated from lab data and compared with historical data. The criterion can also be applied to other standard types of <b>distillation,</b> such as <b>ASTM</b> D- 1160 or TBP. It can be used in distillation column simulations in order to evaluate the performance of the strippers under changing process conditions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{potential}} of ricebran oil as a feedstock {{for the production}} of a fuel for diesel engines alternative to regular diesel fuel has been assessed. Esterification rate of crude ricebran oil with methyl alcohol was studied using different volumetric ratios of alcohol to oil, different catalyst loads and catalyst types. Catalysts used were sulfuric acid at a concentration of 2 % of the oil/alcohol mixture in addition to hydrochloric acid and Amberlite IR- 120 cation exchange resin at the same molar concentration of H+ as in case of sulfuric acid. The reaction was fastest using sulfuric acid which has been then used to prepare esters of ricebran oil with methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl alcohols. The four products have been evaluated as a fuel for diesel engines according to their fuel properties compared to regular diesel fuel. These properties include the calorific value, flash point, viscosity, pour point, cetane number, sulfur content and <b>ASTM</b> <b>distillation</b> characteristics. The results have shown that the methyl as well as the ethyl esters have the closest properties to those of regular diesel fuel. Diesel engine performance using blends of regular diesel fuel with methyl and ethyl esters of ricebran oil have been tested and compared to that using regular diesel fuel. The results have shown that the engine performance using a blend of 50 % regular diesel fuel and 50 % methyl esters of ricebran oil is better than that using regular diesel fuel. The brake thermal efficiency at full load was 30. 2 % using the fuel blend compared to 27. 5 % in case of regular fuel...|$|E
40|$|Achieving robust {{combustion}} {{while also}} yielding low hydrocarbon (HC) emissions {{is difficult for}} the first cycle of cranking during the cold start of a Port Fuel Injected (PFI) Spark Ignition (SI) engine. Cold intake port wall and valve temperatures, near-atmospheric manifold pressure, and low port air velocity combine to create an adverse environment for fuel delivery - the process of injecting and vaporizing liquid fuel to create a combustible air-fuel mixture. As a result, {{only a small fraction}} of the injected fuel mass contributes to the combustible mixture; the fraction is less than 10 % at cold ambient temperatures. With fast light off catalysts, the first cycle produces a significant portion of the total trip emissions. The low fuel delivery fraction results in high residual liquid fuel in both the port and cylinder; this fuel contributes significantly to the exhaust HC emissions. Since the first cycle engine control is open-loop, the Engine Control Unit (ECU) must determine how much fuel to inject under given conditions - temperature, pressure, and for a given fuel. Fuel properties play a significant role in first cycle fuel delivery, since the energy available for vaporization is a limiting factor in fuel delivery. The effect of fuel properties on fuel delivery for the first cycle was quantified at a wide range of cold start temperatures by using a skip-firing strategy to simulate the first cycle of cranking on a production PFI engine. Four fuels between 1083 and 1257 Driveability Index (DI) were tested, and the fuel delivery results have been correlated to properties of the <b>ASTM</b> <b>distillation</b> curve. The fractional distillation point that correlates to fuel delivery is a function of temperature - at colder temperatures, the results(cont.) correlate with the more volatile end of the distillation curve. Fuel delivery results for the fuels were also simulated with a thermodynamics-based fuel delivery model based on partial equilibrium with the charge air. by Kevin R. Lang. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|AbstractIn this study, {{low cost}} waste chicken fat (WCF) {{feedstock}} {{was used for}} fuel-like hydrocarbon production. The effects of varying reaction parameters on the hydrocracking of waste chicken fat using NiW/SiO 2 –Al 2 O 3 catalyst were investigated. The reactions were carried out in a fixed bed down flow reactor at reaction temperatures of 400 – 450 °C, {{liquid hourly space velocity}} (LHSV) of 1, 2, 4 h− 1, H 2 /oil molar ratio of 450 v/v and hydrogen pressures of 6. 0 MPa. The effects on hydrocracking conversion and distribution of products were investigated. The liquid product was analyzed using gas chromatography (GC) to quantify n-alkanes. Hydrocracking conversion and organic liquid products (OLPs) were evaluated by <b>ASTM</b> D- 2887 <b>distillation.</b> The results showed that the catalytic hydrocracking of WCF generates fuels that have chemical and physical properties comparable to those specified for petroleum-based fuels. The amount of kerosene/diesel fractional product decreased with an increase in the temperature and a decrease in the LHSV; while gasoline like petroleum fuel increased. A considerable elimination of O 2 from chicken waste fat molecules has been indicated by FTIR analysis. The oxygen removal pathway of WCF over NiW/SiO 2 –Al 2 O 3 catalyst is primarily carried out by hydro-deoxygenation. The reaction was found to follow the second order mechanism, and the estimated activation energy Ea was 96 kJmol− 1. The exploited catalyst was employed in another run where the results showed the catalyst stability and can be used for several times...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} a Non Linear Programming (NLP) model developed to optimize simultaneously a {{crude oil distillation}} unit (CDU) system and several cases of application run in a refinery as well. This model optimizes feedstock composition and operational conditions for a CDU System (ECOPETROL S. A.). The NLP Model uses a Metamodeling approach so as to represent Atmospheric Distillation Towers (ADT). The Vacuum Distillation Towers (VDT) are implemented assuming perfect separation (assay cuttings). The defined objective function is given by an economic profit. The CDU system consists basically of five industrial units and fourteen Colombian Crude Oils. Each Metamodel uses as independent variables: crude oil flow rates, operational conditions, Jet EBP, and Diesel T 95 % from <b>ASTM</b> D- 86 <b>distillation</b> curve. The output variables of the Metamodels are product flows, temperatures, and qualities. The developed NLP model was implemented in GAMS. The time needed for its solution is around 60 s while using the CONOPT solver. The NLP model results were successfully applied to a Colombian refinery for 3 consecutive weeks. The model {{was able to find}} the best use of installed equipments in CDUs through the preparation of a crude oil charge quasi-constant quality without matter the time period of the optimization. In each week, optimal crude oil flow rates towards each CDU (like new scenarios implemented in the refinery) were evaluated in a refinery global simulator with all downstream refining schemes in order to calculate the Refinery Gross Margin (RGM). In each analyzed case, the obtained RGM for new crude oil feeds was however better than that case without optimization with a economic benefit of up to 0. 043 US$/bl equivalent to US$ 3. 870. 000 per year. This shows the effectiveness of a CDU NLP model within short term planning in the petroleum industry...|$|R
