40|$|The <b>lay</b> judge system, <b>a</b> quasi-jury system, was {{introduced}} in Japan from May 2009. This paper attempts to analyze Japanese people’s attitude about the lay judge system by examining whether they show a willingness to serve as <b>a</b> <b>lay</b> judge. The major findings from regression analysis are: (1) In general, people with a spouse inclined to adopt a negative attitude about serving as <b>a</b> <b>lay</b> judge. This tendency is, however, not observed in large cities. (2) Long-time residents and homeowners {{are more likely to}} have a negative attitude about serving as <b>a</b> <b>lay</b> judge. These results show that a tightly knitted interpersonal social network discourages people from serving as <b>a</b> <b>lay</b> judge. Because of the life time secrecy obligation and the penalty provisions for those who break this obligation, people with closer interpersonal ties are under greater pressure and strains, leading to larger psychological cost. The obligation and its penalty should be eased to improve people’s attitudes about serving as <b>a</b> <b>lay</b> judge. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>A</b> <b>lay</b> {{state is}} <b>a</b> {{relatively}} recent form of state, predominantly {{characteristic of the}} Western legal and political culture. <b>A</b> <b>lay</b> state had its origins in the United States of America {{at the end of}} the 18 th century. However, the principle of the lay state was formulated for the first time in the Constitution of the Fourth French Republic in 1946. The content of that principle in the contemporary world has been largely influenced by the experiences of totalitarian communist systems which, under the cover o f building <b>a</b> <b>lay</b> state and society, propagated the idea of atheism. Currently there is no full agreement as to which attributes decide about the <b>lay</b> character of <b>a</b> state. While at the beginning of the 20 th century the idea of <b>a</b> <b>lay</b> state served mainly to eliminate religion and church from the public sphere, today, in democratic systems it is interpreted as a neutral outlook adopted by the state, guaranteeing the freedom of conscience and religion. As such, it has also been approved by the Catholic Church. However, after the fall of communism, in many states that formally declare their lay character, there are attempts to use religion and various religious unions as political instruments. Therefore the future of <b>a</b> <b>lay</b> state, and in particular propagation of <b>a</b> <b>lay</b> state as <b>an</b> option, is not a very obvious...|$|R

Hence he says to those under afflictions, [...] "Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer" [...] (Rev 2:10). There are things to be suffered, as well as places to suffer in; and there are things to be let into the soul for its emboldening, as well as things to be showed to it (Rom 5:5).|$|E

60|$|For that matter, {{the bill}} {{even as it}} first stood was in direct {{contravention}} to all such high doctrine as this, inasmuch as it clothed a court with power to vary solemn contracts by fixing a composition for outstanding debt, and spreading the payment of it over such a time as the judge might think fit. That, however, was the least part of what finally overtook the haughty language of the month of April. In May the government accepted a proposal that the court should not only settle the sum due by an applicant for relief for outstanding debt, but should fix a reasonable rent {{for the rest of}} the term. This was the very power of variation that ministers had, as it were only the day before, so roundly denounced. But then the tenants in Ulster were beginning to growl. In June ministers withdrew the power of variation, for now it was the landlords who were growling. Then at last in July the prime minister called his party together, and told them that if the bill were not altered, Ulster would be lost to the unionist cause, and that after all he must put into the bill a general revision of judicial rents for three years. So finally, as it was put by a speaker of that time, (M134) you have the prime minister rejecting in April the policy which in May he accepts; rejecting in June the policy which he had accepted in May; and then in July accepting the policy which he had rejected in June, and which had been within a few weeks declared by himself and his colleagues to be inexpedient and dishonest, to be madness and folly, and to be <b>a</b> <b>laying</b> of the axe to the very root of the fabric of civilised society.
