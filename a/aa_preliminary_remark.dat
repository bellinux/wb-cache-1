40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effect of <b>preliminary</b> <b>remarks</b> prior to open {{question}} upon the contents of speaker's responses. It was hypothesized that there should be variances in the contents of responses to open questions which have different <b>preliminary</b> <b>remarks</b> prior to them. The remarks which stress explanation lead to explanatory responses to the open question, whereas the remarks which stress evaluation lead to evaluative responses to the same open question, as compared with the responses to the same open question which has no <b>preliminary</b> <b>remarks.</b> Sixty one undergraduates served as the participants were assigned to one of the three groups: the explanatory <b>preliminary</b> <b>remarks</b> group (EXP gr.), the evaluative <b>preliminary</b> <b>remarks</b> group (EVA gr.), and the no <b>preliminary</b> <b>remarks</b> group (NO gr.). The participant assigned to the EXP group was asked as follows: "Please remember someone who is particularly intimate with vou. I would like to ask you how you explain your friendship if you do so. Could you tell me about your friendship as you like?" The participant assigned to the EVA group was asked as follows: "Please remember someone who is particularly intimate with you. I would like to ask you how you evaluate your friendship if you do so. Could you tell me about your friendship as you like?" The participant assigned to the NO group was asked only as follows: "Could you tell me about your friendship as you like?" About half of the participants were asked about their friendship, whereas the other half were asked about their career. Every verbal response was audiotaped and was transcribed in wordprocessor. The results were analyzed qualitatively as well as quantitatively. The results showed that in the quantitative measures there were no statistical differences among the groups, whereas in the quantitative measure there were statistically significant differences in line with our predictions. It was stressed that the clarity of intention of the listener when the listener asks an open question is important because the suitability of speaker's answer seems vary depending on the clarity of intention of the open question...|$|R

There won’t be much signal phenomenology except in a few illustrative cases.
