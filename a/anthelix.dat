40|$|Abstract There {{are more}} {{important}} outcome variables than the aesthetic {{when it comes to}} a successful result in reconstruction of the ear for microtia. The protective sensitivity, for example, is important to avoid damage to the skin covering the cartilaginous framework. We studied 39 patients with unilateral microtia and recorded their skin sensitivity more than six months after the last operation. The Semmes-Weinstein Monofilament Test (SWMT) was used to assess the threshold of protective sensitivity in three particular areas: the helix, the <b>anthelix,</b> and the lobule. The opposite ear served as control. A monofilament of 4. 31 or less was regarded as acceptable protective sensitivity. Thirty-two patients had acceptable sensitivity in the whole ear, but the helix gave a poor result in seven patients and in one of them so did the <b>anthelix...</b>|$|E
40|$|Cystic swellings of the choncha {{of the ear}} without serious {{inflammation}} are routine {{findings for}} otolaryngologists. They are frequently diagnosed as othematoma or otoseroma and {{may be caused by}} traceable traumas or microtraumas. "Pseudocyst of the auricle" is defined as intracartilaginous cavity lacking epithelial lining. Thus, according to previous reports "pseudocysts" are supposed to occur due to chondromalacia within the cartilage. We recently observed four cases of "pseudocyst of the auricle" characterized by non-inflammatory, merely painless swellings on the <b>anthelix</b> part of the ears without history of any previous trauma. Incisional biopsies were taken from the dorsal side of the concha and freed 2 to 2. 5 mi of viscous serous fluid...|$|E
40|$|In 1960, 5 {{patients}} were reported with a condition termed 'degenerative collagenous plaques of the hands'. Ultraviolet light and chronic pressure {{seem to be}} the inciting factors. Clinically, it is characterized by keratotic, translucent papules, in linear array, on the radial border of the hands. Histology shows hyperkeratosis and dermal elastosis. The current study documented the histopathological, histochemical and ultrastructural features of 20 patients with this condition and considered the differential diagnoses. The findings were in accordance with those of previous studies, bu peculiar, basophilic elastotic masses (BEMs), were a prominent finding. Ultrastructurally, elastic tissue appeared in the form of degenerated non-fragmented and fragmented elastic fibres, degenerated fibres showing foci of increased density, with or without a fibrillar component and as amorphous, structureless material. BEMs arose almost exclusively from degenerated elastic tissue and contained calcium. Disintegrated collagen may be incorporated in the amorphous material and, subsequently, form a minor part of BEMs. Solar elastosis, and its variants, show some similarity to degenerative collagenous plaques of the hands, but lack the constant presence of these calcified angular elastotic masses. BEMs show resemblance to elastic globes, and elastotic bodies found in elastotic nodules of the <b>anthelix</b> and cartilage-hair hypoplasia. In the clinical setting of 'degenerative collagenous plaques of the hands', BEMs seem to be unique and due to their extensive presence serve as a non-specific marker for this condition. Digital papular calcific elastosis therefore seems to be more appropriate nomenclature. Articl...|$|E
