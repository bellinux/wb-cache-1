5|$|One {{possible}} lingering {{effect of}} the Winfield Scotts wreck was the introduction of black rats to the ecosystem of the Channel Islands. While the wreck is one possible source {{for the arrival of}} rats on Anacapa, <b>another</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> later construction of a lighthouse. The first mention of rats on the island is in 1907.|$|E
5|$|The {{manuscript}} is {{dated to}} {{the first half of}} the 4th century and is likely slightly older than Codex Sinaiticus, which was also transcribed in the 4th century. One argument to support this, is that Sinaiticus already has the, at that time, very new Eusebian Canon tables, but Vaticanus does not. <b>Another</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> slightly more archaic style of Vaticanus, and the complete absence of ornamentation.|$|E
5|$|The myth {{influenced}} popular {{religion as}} well. One {{example is the}} magical healing spells based on Horus's childhood. <b>Another</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> use of the Eye of Horus as a protective emblem in personal apotropaic amulets. Its mythological restoration made it appropriate for this purpose, as a general symbol of well-being.|$|E
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Virginian Railway, whose Class AA 2-6-6-0 is depicted.|$|R
50|$|Bodemeister <b>was</b> <b>the</b> 8/5 morning-line {{favorite}} and I'll Have <b>Another</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> 5/2 second choice.|$|R
50|$|A segment was Wolf Rock News and <b>another</b> <b>was</b> <b>The</b> Rock N' Roll Museum with live-action interviews.|$|R
5|$|There are {{a number}} of dams on Spring Brook. One of these is the Spring Brook Intake Dam, which was {{determined}} in 1980 to be in good condition. <b>Another</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Nesbitt Dam and a third is the Watres Dam.|$|E
5|$|Max Tegmark {{developed}} a four-part classification scheme {{for the different}} types of multiverses that scientists have suggested in various problem domains. An example of such a model is the chaotic inflation model of the early universe. <b>Another</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. Parallel worlds are generated {{in a manner similar to}} quantum superposition and decoherence, with all states of the wave function being realized in separate worlds. Effectively, the multiverse evolves as a universal wavefunction. If the Big Bang that created our multiverse created an ensemble of multiverses, the wave function of the ensemble would be entangled in this sense.|$|E
5|$|Several annual events—many of them {{centered}} on performing and visual arts—draw visitors to Ann Arbor. One such event is the Ann Arbor Art Fairs, {{a set of}} four concurrent juried fairs held on downtown streets. Scheduled on Thursday through Sunday of {{the third week of}} July, the fairs draw upward of half a million visitors. <b>Another</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Ann Arbor Film Festival, held during the third week of March, which receives more than 2,500 submissions annually from more than 40 countries and serves as {{one of a handful of}} Academy Award–qualifying festivals in the United States.|$|E
50|$|One of his {{brothers}} was Thomas Baillie, Lieutenant-Governor of Greenwich Hospital; <b>another</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> archdeacon of Cashel.|$|R
5000|$|Numbers {{prime to}} one <b>another</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> least {{of those that}} have the same ratio with them.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> 1932 {{rebellion}} against the Spanish Republic by José Sanjurjo (known as the sanjurjada), which failed.|$|R
5|$|The Andriyivskyy Descent {{also has}} a number of {{monument}}s. One of them is the monument to Yaroslav the Wise, the Grand Prince of Novgorod and Kiev, which depicts him holding a model of the Saint Sophia Cathedral. <b>Another</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> monument to Pronya Prokopovna and Svirid Golohvastov, which was unveiled in 1989, depicting two characters, Pronya Prokopovna and Svirid Golohvastov, from the play Chasing Two Rabbits, which was written by Mykhailo Starytskyi. Another main monument on the street is dedicated to the famous Ukrainian poet and artist Taras Shevchenko, located {{to the right of the}} monument to Yaroslav the Wise. Most recently, a monument to Mikhail Bulgakov was opened on the Andriyivskyy Descent, the first dedicated to the writer in the former Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|This list {{of birds}} of Ontario {{includes}} all the bird species {{recorded in the}} Canadian province of Ontario {{as determined by the}} Ontario Bird Records Committee (OBRC). There are, as of April 2017, 495 species on this list, 291 of which are known to breed in the province. Ontario has a considerable variety of bird species. One of the factors in this diversity is the size and range of environments in Ontario. <b>Another</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Great Lakes; many birds use the shores as a stopping point during migration.|$|E
25|$|While {{the pink}} ribbon culture is dominant, there are alternatives. The {{environmental}} breast cancer movement is {{one type of}} dissent. <b>Another</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> rejection of compliant optimism, aesthetic normalization, and social pleasingness that the pink ribbon culture promotes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> 1963 Volkswagen Beetle {{belonging}} to Albert Klein of Pasadena, California that had accumulated 1,442,044 miles on 25 Jan 1993.|$|R
5000|$|Baxter Building and Four Freedoms Plaza - fictional {{buildings}} that have, {{at one time}} or <b>another,</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> home of the Fantastic Four.|$|R
25|$|The temple {{structure}} {{resembles the}} human body with all its subtleties. The five walls encircling one <b>another</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> koshas (sheaths) of human existence.|$|R
25|$|An {{example of}} such a {{simulation}} is the boids program created by Craig Reynolds in 1986. <b>Another</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> self-propelled particle model introduced by Vicsek et al. in 1995 Many current models use variations on these rules. For instance, many models implement these three rules through layered zones around each fish.|$|E
25|$|The Desarrollo Industrial Emiliano Zapata is {{the newest}} park, located just outside Cuernavaca in the {{municipality}} of Emiliano Zapata. It has an extension of 23.5 hectares. One of its principal occupants is the Nu Start clothing manufacturer. <b>Another</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Emiliano Zapata Central de Abastos wholesale food market.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> lab's cloning of FRS2, {{which is}} {{critical}} for signaling by the Fibroblast growth factor receptor. In 2001, he was ranked by the ISI Highly Cited {{as one of the}} world's top 30 most cited scientists (across all fields) in the 1990s. According to ISI, his papers have been cited a total of 76,699 times.|$|E
50|$|The couple {{entered into}} a bohemian circle of friends. One of these fellow bohemians was Ricardo Gómez Robelo. <b>Another</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> photographer, Edward Weston.|$|R
50|$|A {{highlight}} of <b>the</b> year <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{visit to the}} campus of the Vienna Boys Choir. <b>Another</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> 1963 Senior Class Trip to Washington, DC.|$|R
50|$|Nuclear mines {{have also}} been developed, both land and naval varieties. An example <b>is</b> <b>the</b> British Blue Peacock project, while <b>another</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Medium Atomic Demolition Munition.|$|R
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Hopi language's {{words for}} water, one {{indicating}} drinking {{water in a}} container and another indicating a natural body of water. These examples of polysemy served the double purpose of showing that indigenous languages sometimes made more fine grained semantic distinctions than European languages and that direct translation between two languages, even of seemingly basic concepts such as snow or water, is not always possible.|$|E
25|$|It is because, {{a nation}} which shared blood and history is clear, {{and just like}} my body can't be another's, the reason that a certain nation can't become <b>another</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> same as {{brothers}} {{living in the same}} house. If two gather and become one, one would be higher and the other lower, so it becomes a basic problem that one orders from above, and the other obeys from below.|$|E
25|$|The film makes {{repeated}} use of distinctive cinematic techniques. One {{of these}} is dreams and how they reflect the fears and desires of the characters. <b>Another</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> use of music, in conjunction with dialogues and editing, both as background music and as performed on camera. The film starts with a monologue which ends up being sung to Dixieland jazz music being played by lone musicians, each in a different room in {{a different part of}} the city.|$|E
50|$|Of notable people born in Sorn, one <b>was</b> <b>the</b> natural historian, author, and {{educator}} James Rennie. <b>Another</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> famous preacher Alexander Peden; Sorn has a Covenanter history.|$|R
25|$|He was one {{of seven}} {{brothers}}. One of his brothers <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Pakistan Test cricketer of the 1950s Waqar Hasan, and <b>another</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> film director and producer Iqbal Shehzad.|$|R
50|$|There {{were also}} Hepburns of Waughton, thought {{by some to}} have {{branched}} off from the Hailes line, thought by others to predate it. <b>Another</b> line <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Hepburns of Beanston, and yet <b>another</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Hepburns of Athelstaneford. All of these families were prominent in various ways at various junctures of Scottish history, but all were primarily located around the East Lothian area.|$|R
25|$|By 1977, the {{administration}} had formally moved from the Wilson campus. The historic buildings from the early century of Minnesota State were sold or donated to private businesses and non-profit organizations. One such former university building is the current Blue Earth County Government Center, <b>another</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> site of Blue Earth County History Center and Museum shared with a VINE senior center, and a third {{is the site of}} the Southern Minnesota Children's Science Center.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{distinctly}} Chicago sandwiches, {{among them the}} Italian beef sandwich, which is thinly sliced beef simmered in au jus and served on an Italian roll with sweet peppers or spicy giardiniera. A popular modification is the Combo—an Italian beef sandwich {{with the addition of}} an Italian sausage. <b>Another</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Maxwell Street Polish, a grilled or deep-fried kielbasa— on a hot dog roll, topped with grilled onions, yellow mustard, and hot sport peppers.|$|E
25|$|One modern {{national}} alphabet {{that has}} not been graphically traced back to the Canaanite alphabet is the Maldivian script, which is unique in that, although it is clearly modeled after Arabic and perhaps other existing alphabets, it derives its letter forms from numerals. <b>Another</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Korean Hangul, which was created independently in 1443. The Osmanya alphabet was devised for Somali in the 1920s by Osman Yusuf Kenadid, and the forms of its consonants appear to be complete innovations.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Another</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{design a}} [...] "Commemorative Diploma" [...] for the Royal Naval Exhibition of 1891 in Chelsea, England. The {{exhibition}} featured displays and artifacts from famous ships and sea battles.|$|R
50|$|Theatres and playhouses <b>were</b> {{allowed in}} <b>the</b> Clink, <b>the</b> most famous <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Globe Theatre where William Shakespeare {{performed}} his plays. <b>Another</b> <b>was</b> <b>The</b> Rose, where Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe both premiered plays.|$|R
25|$|Only five Favorits were built, flying {{competitively}} in the DDR until 1980. One set {{a national}} record of 107km/h(67mph) over a 100k(62mi) triangle; <b>another</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first {{to fly a}} German 50km(310mi) triangle.|$|R
