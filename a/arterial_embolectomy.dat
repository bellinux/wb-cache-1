5000|$|Fogarty <b>arterial</b> <b>embolectomy</b> {{catheter}} is {{a device}} developed in 1961 by Dr. Thomas J. Fogarty to remove fresh emboli in the arterial system.It {{consists of a}} hollow tube with an inflatable balloon attached to its tip. The catheter is inserted into the blood vessel through a clot. The balloon is then inflated to extract it from the vessel. [...] It is available in different lengths and sizes, and is often colour coded by size. [...] Because it is less invasive than ordinary surgery, it reduces the chance of postoperative complications.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The jejunostomy tube is an {{important}} means of access for enteral feeding in the surgical and medical patient. A common complication of this technique is tube occlusion. Once a mature tract has formed the tube can be removed and replaced, following by contrast radiologic documentation of its intraluminal position. With an immature tract, this option is not available. We report a safe, simple, and cost-effective method of unblocking a clogged jejunostomy using an <b>arterial</b> <b>embolectomy</b> catheter. (Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nu-trition 12 : 417 - 418, 1988) The feeding jejunostomy tube has an established role in early postoperative alimentation and the long-term nutritional support of patients with proximal gastroin-testinal lesions, neurologic dysfunction, or malignancy. 1, 2 Complications of feeding jejunostomy include hemor-rhage, infection, tube dislodgement, persistent fistulas, and small bowel obstruction. ’ Additional complications include aspiration pneumonia, abdominal distention, diarrhea, and tube occlusion. ’ Occlusion of the feeding jejunostomy which is resistant to flushing with various agents in the immediate postoperative period can be troublesome since a mature tract does not exist. This makes simple bedside removal and replacement of the tube difficult and dangerous. We offer a simple, cost effective, and convenient method of restoring patency to the occluded feeding jejunostomy tube by use of an <b>arterial</b> <b>embolectomy</b> (Fogarty) catheter...|$|E

40|$|Atherosclerosis {{complicated}} by thromboembolism {{is the main}} cause of obstructive arterial disease in the legs. Two studies from West Germany suggest that antiplatelet drugs may slow the progress of atherosclerosis in leg arteries and prevent occlusive thrombosis under some circumstances. The same agents may also reduce the risk of rethrombosis after successful vascular repair in the femoropopliteal region; in one trial, aspirin decreased the incidence of reocclusion after thromboendarterectomy and, in another, the combination of aspirin and dipyridamole was effective after bypass with synthetic material. Antithrombotic drugs are used in most centers after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, but there is no definite evidence for their need. Thus, it appears that in contrast to cardiac and cerebrovascular disease, few efforts have been made to determine the true value of antithrombotic therapy in peripheral arterial disease. The management of acute thromboembolism in the legs requires a multidisciplinary approach. Depending on the type (embolic or thrombotic), length and localization of the <b>arterial</b> occlusion, surgical (<b>embolectomy,</b> thromboendarterectomy, peripheral bypass surgery) or nonsurgical (systemic fibrinolysis or local thrombolytic therapy with or without balloon angioplasty) treatment is preferred. The importance of nonsurgical therapeutic approaches may become even greater in elderly patients with a poor operative risk. This review discusses the available therapeutic modalities in acute and chronic peripheral thromboembolic arterial disease. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) is {{routinely}} used in patients after <b>arterial</b> <b>embolectomy.</b> Achieving and maintaining therapeutic levels requires a co-ordinated approach {{which may be}} difficult for busy junior doctors and laboratories. There is no current evidence regarding the use of subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) as an alternative. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study retrospectively examined all patients who had undergone any form of embolectomy during 2006 and 2007 by review of their medical records, an electronic laboratory database, and the patients' drug charts. RESULTS: Overall, 45 patients were studied. A total of 389 activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) tests were performed of which 146 (37. 6 %) were in the therapeutic range (50 - 90 s), 40. 4 % were 90 s. Five patients (11. 1 %) had further surgical procedures. Significant bleeding occurred in two patients. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that many patients are not appropriately anticoagulated. Whilst a new UFH protocol is being developed by our hospital trust, the authors believe the use of LMWH could provide a more effective and user-friendly alternative to UFH...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the use of a Fogarty <b>arterial</b> <b>embolectomy</b> catheter (Fogarty catheter) in intraoperative balloon angioplasty of the cephalic vein, in order to determine its effect on the patency of arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) created for hemodialysis access. Methods: A total of 156 patients who underwent creation of an AVF were divided into two groups, based whether a Fogarty catheter was used during AVF creation. Group A (89 patients) comprised the patients who underwent balloon angioplasty with a Fogarty catheter during the operation. Group B (67 patients) included the patients in whom a Fogarty catheter was not used during the operation. Patient records were reviewed retrospectively and documented. The patency rate was determined by the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: The records of 156 patients who underwent the creation of an AVF from January 2007 to October 2011 were included. The mean follow-up duration was 40. 2 ± 19. 4 months (range, 1 to 97 months). The patency rates in group A at 12, 36, and 72 months were 83. 9...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Smooth {{muscle cell}} {{proliferation}} {{is a major}} pathophysiologic factor in injury-induced neointimal hyperplasia and recurrent stenosis. We have demonstrated that recombinant human thrombomodulin (rTM) inhibits thrombin-induced arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation in vitro. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the effect of rTM on neointimal hyperplasia in vivo. METHODS: A rabbit femoral artery balloon injury model was used. Bilateral superficial femoral arteries were deendothelialized with a 2 F <b>arterial</b> <b>embolectomy</b> catheter. rTM (145 microg/kg; 2. 0 microg/mL in circulation) or Tris-hydrochloride vehicle control was administered intravenously during the procedure, then either discontinued (group A) or administered twice daily for an additional 48 hours (group B). Rabbits were euthanized at 4 days and at 1, 2, and 4 weeks, and femoral artery specimens were prepared with in situ perfusion fixation and paraffin embedding. Luminal, intima, media, and whole artery areas were quantitated with digital imaging computerized planimetry. Intima-media and lumen-whole artery ratios were calculated. The injury-induced inflammatory reaction was also evaluated with light microscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and immunohistochemical and immunohistofluorescence staining. RESULTS: In the buffer control group, neointimal hyperplasia after femoral artery balloon injury was evident at 2 weeks, and was pronounced at 4 weeks (PCONCLUSIONS: Systemic intravenous administration of rTM significantly decreases neointimal hyperplasia and improves patency in the rabbit femoral artery after balloon injury. In addition to exhibiting antithrombotic and antiproliferative effects, rTM may also invoke an anti-inflammatory mechanism, and may alter vascular remodeling in a multidimensional role to inhibit recurrent stenosis after arterial injury...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundProtruding {{aortic arch}} {{thrombus}} is associated clinically with life-threatening emboli. Definitive treatment for aortic arch thrombus removal has demanded complicated vascular surgical procedures, with high morbidity and mortality. Methods and resultsTransesophageal echocardiography (TEE) enabled {{diagnosis of a}} protruding thrombus at the aortic arch in 5 patients, and a simultaneous lesion in the descending aorta in 1 patient. Four patients had visceral emboli, coinciding with peripheral emboli in 2 patients, and the fifth patient had peripheral and cerebral emboli. One patient had had ischemic stroke and femoral emboli a few months previously. Mean patient age was 51 years. None had clinical evidence of coronary or peripheral atherosclerotic occlusive disease. Risk factors included hypertension (n = 2), smoking (n = 4), and preexisting thrombophilia (n = 4). Five patients underwent TEE-guided aortic balloon thrombectomy from the arch with a 34 -mm occluding balloon catheter. One patient also underwent balloon thrombectomy from the descending aorta with a 14 F Foley catheter. Access into the aorta was obtained through the iliac artery (n = 4) during laparotomy because of visceral ischemia or through the transfemoral approach (n = 2). Previous procedures included superior mesenteric embolectomy (n = 3), segmental bowel resection (n = 1), splenectomy (n = 1), and peripheral <b>arterial</b> <b>embolectomy</b> n = 3). Real-time intraoperative TEE enabled visualization of the protruding thrombus and assisted with maneuvering of the balloon catheter. At completion peripheral thrombectomy thrombus material was retrieved in 4 patients. Postoperatively there were no clinically proved new procedure-related visceral emboli, and all patients received anticoagulant therapy thereafter. Follow-up TEE within 2 weeks and up to 7 years revealed no recurrent aortic arch thrombus. ConclusionsTEE-guided aortic balloon thrombectomy used in 6 procedures was effectively completed without visceral or peripheral ischemic complications. It enabled removal of the life-threatening source of emboli from the proximal aorta, thereby averting the need of major aortic surgery...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to investigate the influence of balloon injury and subsequent neointima formation in the rat carotid artery on the beta-adrenoceptor function. Rat left common carotid artery was subjected to balloon injury with an <b>arterial</b> <b>embolectomy</b> catheter; the contralateral artery was sham-operated. Immediately, and at 2, 8 and 16 weeks post-injury, both the injured and the sham-operated carotid arteries were isolated and mounted in an isometric wire-myograph set-up. Subsequently, concentration-response curves (CRCs) were constructed for the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline after precontraction with the thromboxane A 2 (TP) -receptor agonist U 46619 (30 nM) of the injured and sham-operated artery preparations. To evaluate the involvement of the beta 1 - and the beta 2 -adrenoceptor subtypes, CRCs were constructed in the presence of CGP 20712 A (0. 1 nM, a beta 1 -adrenoceptor-selective antagonist) and ICI 118, 551 (10 nM, a beta 2 -adrenoceptor-selective antagonist). L-NAME (100 microM) and indomethacine (10 microM) were used to evaluate the influence of nitric oxide (NO) or prostanoids, respectively. Immediately post-injury, isoprenaline-induced vasorelaxation was impaired in the injured carotid artery preparations: Emax= 19. 6 +/- 2. 2 % vs. 64. 0 +/- 4. 6 %, injured vs. sham, n= 8, P < 0. 05. However, from 2 weeks post-injury onwards, this response appeared enhanced in the injured preparations: Emax, 2 weeks= 86. 4 +/- 2. 2 % vs. 49. 7 +/- 5. 7 %, injured vs. sham, n= 5, P < 0. 05. In addition, the sensitivity for isoprenaline was increased in these preparations: pD 2, 2 weeks= 7. 48 +/- 0. 08 vs. 6. 88 +/- 0. 10, injured vs. sham, n= 5, P < 0. 05. The beta-adrenoceptor population in both types of preparations consisted mainly of the beta 2 -adrenoceptor subtype, although at 8 and 16 weeks post-injury, the beta 1 -adrenoceptor subtype appeared to be present as well in the injured artery preparations. Inhibition of NO synthesis led to significant decreases of beta-adrenoceptor-mediated vasorelaxation both in injured and in sham-operated artery preparations for all time points, except at 16 weeks. Cyclo-oxygenase inhibition had no influence on isoprenaline-induced vasorelaxation in injured and sham-operated preparations. From this, it is concluded that beta-adrenoceptor-mediated vasorelaxation in rat carotid artery is partially NO-dependent and occurs mainly via activation of the beta 2 -adrenoceptor subtype. Balloon injury and subsequent neointima formation in the rat carotid artery lead initially to an impairment, but subsequently to an enhancement of the beta-adrenoceptor-mediated vasorelaxation. The impairment is attributable to the removal of endothelium, whereas the enhanced beta-adrenoceptor-mediated function may be related to the occurrence of an NO system in the neointimal smooth muscle cell...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Interleukin 18 (IL 18) is an {{interferon}} (IFN) -gamma-inducing {{factor and}} a proinflammatory and proatherogenic cytokine. IL 18 binding protein (IL 18 -BP) functions as an IL 18 inhibitor. This {{study was designed}} to investigate whether systemic administration of IL 18 -BP could inhibit neointimal hyperplasia and arterial lipid deposition. METHODS: New Zealand white, male rabbits were fed with a 21 % fat, 0. 15 % cholesterol diet. The left superficial femoral artery (SFA) was de-endotheliazed with a 2 F <b>arterial</b> <b>embolectomy</b> catheter. IL 18 -BP (5 microg, 10 microg, or 25 microg), or 0. 9 % saline (control) was administered by i. v. bolus during surgery. Rabbits were followed-up at 2 and 4 weeks. Intima-media (I/M) and lumen-whole artery (L/A) area ratios, and luminal areas were measured. Serum lipid levels, liver enzymes, and kidney function were evaluated. Inflammatory cells were quantified and further verified with immunohistofluorescence staining. The extent of lipid deposition in the artery wall was quantified with Oil Red O (ORO) staining employing Zeiss AxioVision 4. 6. 3. Image analysis software. Lipid laden cells including macrophages were evaluated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). RESULTS: Intravenous IL 18 -BP 5 microg, 10 microg, and 25 microg significantly reduced I/M ratios compared with the control group at both 2 and 4 weeks. There {{was no significant difference between}} the 5 microg and 10 microg dose groups. However, at 10 microg, IL 18 -BP significantly increased L/A ratio more than either the 5 microg IL 18 -BP or control groups. The high fat diet caused significant elevation of serum lipids at 4 and 6 weeks. IL 18 -BP had no effect on blood lipid levels. Lipid deposit in the thoracic aorta of the control group at 6 weeks was more than at 4 weeks (P =. 025). Administration of IL 18 -BP inhibited the lipid deposition at 4 weeks (not significant) and 6 weeks (P =. 012 to. 008) compared with its control group. Lipid laden macrophages (foam cells), as well as endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells were seen in the descending thoracic aorta after 6 weeks of a high fat diet by ORO, immunohistofluorescence staining, and TEM. The lipid laden cells were not seen in either of IL 18 -BP groups. IL 18 -BP 10 microg significantly inhibited mono/macro adherence and infiltration in the SFA after balloon-injury at 2 weeks after surgery. CONCLUSION: A single intravenous dose of IL 18 -BP significantly decreased arterial neointimal hyperplasia, improved lumen to artery ratio after balloon-injury and also prevented arteriosclerosis progression. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A single intravenous dose of IL 18 BP decreased neointimal hyperplasia and improved arterial L/A ratios in an atherosclerotic balloon-injury animal model. These preliminary results suggest that IL 18 BP may be a promising molecular approach to inhibit neointimal hyperplasia and arteriosclerosis progression following coronary and peripheral angioplasty...|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{mechanism}} underlying ischemic preconditioning (IPC) {{protection against}} spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is unclear. We investigated {{the role of}} spinal cord autoregulation in tolerance to spinal cord I/R injury induced by IPC in a rat model. MethodsSprague-Dawley rats {{were randomly assigned to}} four groups. IPC (P) group animals received IPC by temporary thoracic aortic occlusion (AO) with a 2 F Fogarty <b>arterial</b> <b>embolectomy</b> catheter (Baxter Healthcare, Irvine, Calif) for 3 minutes. The I/R injury (I/R) group animals were treated with blood withdrawal and temporary AO for 12 minutes, and shed blood reinfusion {{at the end of the}} procedures. The P+I/R animals received IPC, followed by 5 minutes reperfusion, and then I/R procedures for 12 minutes. Sham (S) group animals received anesthesia and underwent surgical preparation, but without preconditioning or I/R injury. Neurologic function on postprocedure days 1, 3, 5, and 7 was evaluated by Tarlov scoring. Lumbar segments were harvested for histopathologic examination on day 7. To evaluate the role of autoregulation in IPC, spinal cord blood flow and tissue oxygenation were continuously monitored throughout the procedure duration. ResultsThe Tarlov scores in the I/R group were significantly lower than those in the S, P, and P+I/R groups on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 (P <. 001). No significant differences were noted between the S, P, and P+I/R groups. The numbers of surviving motor neurons in the S, P, and P+I/R groups were significantly higher than those in the I/R group (P <. 001); however, the number of surviving motor neurons did not differ between the S, P, and P+I/R groups. The P group exhibited higher spinal cord blood flow (P =. 001 -. 043) and tissue oxygenation (P =. 032 -. 043) within the first 60 minutes after reperfusion than the S group. The P+I/R group exhibited higher spinal cord blood flow (P =. 016 -. 045) and tissue oxygenation (P =. 001 -. 038) within the first 60 minutes after reperfusion than the I/R group. ConclusionsIPC ameliorates spinal cord I/R injury in rats, probably mediated by triggering spinal cord autoregulation and improving local spinal cord blood flow and tissue oxygenation. This concept may be the new therapeutic targets in patients requiring aortic surgery. Clinical RelevanceSpinal cord ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a potentially devastating and unpredictable complication of thoracoabdominal aorta surgery. Several protective strategies have been developed that attempt to preserve blood supply or increase spinal cord ischemic tolerance. This study shows that ischemic preconditioning triggers spinal cord autoregulation, improves local blood flow and tissue oxygenation, and ameliorates I/R injury. This concept may have clinical utility in patients requiring aortic surgery, and triggering and maintenance of spinal cord autoregulation may be new therapeutic targets to eliminate the catastrophic complication...|$|E

The injury-induced inflammatory reaction was also evaluated with light microscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and immunohistochemical and immunohistofluorescence staining. ResultsIn the buffer control group, neointimal hyperplasia after femoral artery balloon injury was evident at 2 weeks, and was pronounced at 4 weeks (P <. 0001). Infusion of rTM significantly inhibited intimal hyperplasia at both 2 and 4 weeks (P <. 0001). In group A, rTM reduced the intima-media ratio by 27 % and 39 % at 2 and 4 weeks, respectively. Extended administration of rTM (group B) resulted in inhibition of hyperplasia by 57 % and 30 % at 2 and 4 weeks, respectively, but failed to reach significance compared with the shorter exposure. rTM infusion significantly inhibited thrombosis (8. 1 -fold) compared with the buffer control group (P =. 012). rTM had no significant effect on lumen area or lumen–whole artery ratio, but treated arteries demonstrated significantly less compensatory dilatation (P =. 045), as measured by whole artery area in response to less intimal hyperplasia. rTM administration inhibited platelet adhesion and inhibition of neutrophil infiltration to a degree that approached statistical significance (P =. 0675). ConclusionsSystemic intravenous administration of rTM significantly decreases neointimal hyperplasia and improves patency in the rabbit femoral artery after balloon injury. In addition to exhibiting antithrombotic and antiproliferative effects, rTM may also invoke an anti-inflammatory mechanism, and may alter vascular remodeling in a multidimensional role to inhibit recurrent stenosis after arterial injury. AbstractClinical relevanceResults of angioplasty/stenting and surgical bypass remain hindered by restenosis and thrombosis. Intravenous administration of thrombomodulin (TM) demonstrated a multifactorial effect resulting in significant inhibition of neointimal hyperplasia and thrombus formation following balloon injury in a small-caliber artery model. This, along with TM being an endogenous glycoprotein expressed on the luminal surface of the normal vessel wall, makes it an attractive target to exploit in modulating the pathologic arterial response to injury with less risk of toxicity. Administration of rTM intravenously has direct clinical applicability with additional efforts toward local delivery and modification of synthetic bioprostheses...|$|E
