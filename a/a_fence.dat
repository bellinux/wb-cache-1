5|$|As {{mentioned}} above, the keeper's {{house was}} gutted by vandal fire in September 1991. In early 1992 <b>a</b> <b>fence</b> was installed and the chimneys and gables were stabilised by new brickwork.|$|E
5|$|Following excavation, several {{stones were}} placed in the {{original}} sockets {{in order to create a}} reconstruction of the original circle. <b>A</b> <b>fence</b> was then erected around the circle to discourage further interference.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, {{his body}} was {{discovered}} next to a rifle, near <b>a</b> <b>fence</b> on the property; he had tripped as he climbed through the fence, and he accidentally shot himself. O'Halloran never married. The 50m pool at Kojonup was named the Kevin O'Halloran Memorial Pool in his honour, and he was posthumously inducted into the Western Australian Hall of Champions.|$|E

5|$|On <b>a</b> <b>fence</b> {{in front}} of the wall, there were {{memorial}} crosses with the names and date of death on them. However, since the government moved to Berlin, the white crosses had to be relocated in 1995 from {{the eastern side of the}} Reichstag. The new location is on the west side of the building at <b>a</b> <b>fence</b> of the Tiergarten. 2003, Wolfgang Thierse inaugurated a new memorial designed by Jan Wehberg with the same name as the one on Reichstagufer. On seven both-sided inscribed crosses are the names of the 13 deaths. Another memorial of the Civil Association was in Bernauer Straße. Other victims are remembered through commemorative plates embedded in sidewalks and other installations which are nearby their death spot. On October 2004, the Working Group 13 August built the Freedom Memorial at Checkpoint Charlie. It reminds people of the victims of the Berlin Wall and the inner German border with 1067 crosses. The memorial had to be removed after about half a year because the landowners terminated the lease with the working group.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} panning view of <b>a</b> <b>fence</b> and people with {{umbrellas}} on the left, eventually zooming out on an audience looking through it in the rain. Both Volkova and Katina are then shown singing to the track in Catholic school uniforms. Throughout {{the majority of the}} visual, the girls are featured performing erratic behaviour, which includes them banging against <b>a</b> <b>fence,</b> yelling for help towards the audience, and occasionally laughing at them. While continuing to sing to each other during the second chorus, they subsequently start to kiss, and the audience slightly stares at their actions. Following this, several members of the public start to talk to each other, whilst a shot with the camera looking up Volkova's skirt and exposing her underwear is shown during the process.|$|E
5|$|Trees {{much older}} than 10,000 years would be {{practically}} impossible in Sweden, because until around 11,000 years ago the area was {{in the grip of}} a world-wide ice age.

5|$|Using <b>a</b> <b>fence,</b> branch or {{telegraph}} pole as a perch or {{vantage point}} to hunt from, the southern boobook pounces on prey then retreats {{to a tree}} or elevated place to eat it. It often hunts in open areas near trees, and also where prey are likely to congregate, such as mice near haystacks or barns, or flying insects near street- or house-lights.|$|E
5|$|After the {{war ended}} with the defeat of Japan in 1945, the ban on nonessential {{construction}} was lifted, and the state restarted construction and restoration activities in Constitution Square in 1948. These activities included restoring and re-roofing the buildings, adding furniture to the buildings, constructing walkways, erecting signs, and adding landscaping to the park. The restorations were completed in 1955. From 1960 to 1968, the state added <b>a</b> <b>fence</b> around the site, installed a new lighting and diorama system, constructed {{a replica of the}} square's original pillory, and renovated several buildings, including an early 19th-century brick schoolhouse which became the caretaker's residence.|$|E
5|$|As, {{according}} to Bulgarian mythology {{and some other}} traditions, tortoises were the only beings who knew {{the appearance of the}} herb and the location where it grows, such people would try to obtain the raskovnik by deceiving a tortoise. They would find a tortoise nesting site and hem it in with <b>a</b> <b>fence</b> while the tortoise is away. When it returns, the tortoise would be unable to access its eggs, so it would return with a raskovnik in order to breach the fence. Thus, the tortoise would reveal the herb and people would acquire it from the tortoise, which does not need it anymore.|$|E

5|$|Brooker {{originally}} {{wrote the}} episode in an apocalyptic setting, {{but when the}} script {{was about to be}} filmed at a former U.S. Air Force base, he changed it because of <b>a</b> <b>fence</b> he saw there. He rewrote the story in two days, removing some details he considered useful for a sequel story. The main change was the addition of a plot twist {{at the end of the}} script, which was noted as the most impressive aspect of the episode by several reviewers.|$|E
5|$|December 18, 1990: A Greyhound bus left Salt Lake City for Chicago {{and became}} entrenched in a driving {{snowstorm}} on I-80. Just {{short of the}} Wyoming border, the bus {{was hit by a}} semi-tractor trailer that had crossed the median heading the opposite direction. The force of the collision tipped the bus onto its right side and steered it down a steep embankment. The bus slid for 150 feet and came to rest against <b>a</b> <b>fence,</b> about 35 feet below the eastbound lanes of I-80. 7 passengers were killed and more than 40 injured.|$|E
5|$|Historical data {{prior to}} 1700 is sparse {{due to lack}} of {{significant}} European settlements along the coastline; the few storms listed are largely records from Roanoke Colony and later the Province of Carolina. Modern meteorologists believe early storms were tropical cyclones, though due to the time period confirmation is impossible. One theory explaining the disappearance of Roanoke Colony suggests a hurricane destroyed the village, though {{there is no evidence to}} prove the theory. It is considered unlikely {{due to lack of}} damage to <b>a</b> <b>fence</b> around the village, on which the villagers left an inscription.|$|E

5|$|Liverpool won {{a trophy}} treble during Fagan's {{first season as}} manager, winning the League title for the third {{straight}} year, the Football League Cup for the fourth straight year and a fourth European Cup. The following season, the club was involved in one of the worst football stadium disasters. Before the start of the 1985 European Cup Final versus Juventus, Liverpool fans breached <b>a</b> <b>fence</b> separating the two groups of supporters, and charged the Juventus fans. The resulting weight of people caused a retaining wall to collapse, killing 39 mostly Italians fans. This tragedy, the Heysel Stadium disaster, caused a five year UEFA competition expulsion of English clubs.|$|E
5|$|Several of the {{locations}} either were real, or were filmed {{with the use}} of stand-ins. The gate for the Area 51 set was filmed at <b>a</b> <b>fence</b> on the San Bernardino county line, one hundred and twenty miles away from Los Angeles. The restaurant that the characters visit, the Little A'Le'Inn, is an actual cafe off Highway 375 in Rachel, Nevada. The inside, however, was an elaborate set, as the original is much too small.|$|E
5|$|The 1985 European Cup Final was Liverpool's fifth such final. Before {{the match}} at the Heysel Stadium began, Liverpool fans {{breached}} <b>a</b> <b>fence</b> separating opposing fans. As Juventus fans fled to safety, {{the accumulation of}} people against a perimeter wall caused it to collapse, killing 39 mostly Italians fans. The wall collapse was followed by Juventus fans rioting at the stadium's other end. The match was delayed two hours before starting with fear abandonment would cause further violence. Michel Platini's penalty won the final 1–0 for the Italians.|$|E

The security forces soon set up a guard post and <b>a</b> <b>fence</b> around the grove. They then obtain an order to uproot the lemon trees.|$|E
5|$|The game {{contains}} {{two types of}} bonus stages accessed by passing a checkpoint with at least 20 rings. The first type has Sonic or Knuckles orbit floating, glowing spheres, jetting off each one when a button is pressed, while <b>a</b> <b>fence</b> of light approaches from the bottom and will remove the player from the stage if touched. Collecting 50 rings in this stage earns the player a continue.
