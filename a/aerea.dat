5|$|The Portuguese had {{excellent}} {{coordination between}} light bombers, helicopters and reinforced ground patrols. They utilised American tactics of quick airborne (helibourne) assaults supported by heavy aerial bombardments of FRELIMO camps by the Portuguese Air Force (Força <b>Aérea</b> Portuguesa or FAP) to surround {{and eliminate the}} guerrillas. These bombardments were accompanied {{by the use of}} heavy artillery. The Portuguese also used cavalry units to cover the flanks of patrols and where the terrain was too difficult to motor transport, and units of captured or deserted guerrillas to penetrate their former bases.|$|E
5|$|The FMA IAe 33 Pulqui II (in the {{indigenous}} language Mapuche, Pulqúi: Arrow) was a jet fighter aircraft designed by Kurt Tank {{in the late}} 1940s in Argentina, under the Perón government, and built by the Fábrica Militar de Aviones (FMA). Embodying many of the design elements of the wartime Focke-Wulf Ta 183, an unrealized fighter project, the FMA envisioned the IAe 33 Pulqui II as a successor to the postwar Gloster Meteor F4 in service with the Fuerza <b>Aérea</b> Argentina. The Pulqui II's development was comparatively problematic and lengthy, {{with two of the}} four prototypes being lost in fatal crashes. Despite one of the prototypes being successfully tested in combat during the Revolución Libertadora, the political, economic and technical challenges faced by the project meant that the IAe 33 was unable to reach its full potential, and the Argentine government ultimately chose to purchase F-86 Sabres from the United States in lieu of continuing development of {{the indigenous}} fighter to production status.|$|E

25|$|In 1952, Hiller UH-12 {{helicopters}} {{arrived to}} the country, initially acquired for the Ministerio de Obras Públicas, but later {{assigned to the}} Air Force. In consequence, in 1954, the first helicopter base was created in Melgar, Tolima. Nowadays this base is known as Base <b>Aérea</b> “Capitán Luis F. Gómez Niño”, home of the Comando Aéreo de Combate No. 4 and the Joint Helicopter School of the Armed Forces. In 1959, with the inauguration of the El Dorado International Airport, the Base <b>Aérea</b> de Transporte Militar was created, later renamed as Base <b>Aérea</b> “Brigadier General Camilo Daza”, home today of the Comando Aéreo de Transporte Militar (CATAM). In 1962 in order to integrate economically and socially the furthest {{regions of the country}} the Servicio Aéreo a Territorios Nacionales Satena was created.|$|E

25|$|The Re.2000 were {{assigned}} to Squadriglia di Riserva <b>Aerea</b> delle FF.NN.BB. (air reserve squadron for naval battleships), led by Captain Donato Tondi. This was initially based at Grottaglie, then at Capodichino and finally at La Spezia, as air defence for naval bases. The squadron disbanded on April 1943 {{and was replaced by}} the 1° Gr. Riserva <b>Aerea</b> delle FF.NN.BB, led by now Maj. Tondi, with three flights. It had all the eight Re.2000s and several old fighters. Many of them were aboard the battleships: two for Vittorio Veneto and Roma, one for Littorio (summer 1943).|$|E
25|$|In 1959 {{during the}} Cuban Revolution, the Fuerza <b>Aérea</b> del Ejercito de Cuba (FAEC) {{purchased}} {{a total of}} 17 refurbished (ex-Fleet Air Arm) Sea Furies from Hawker. The aircraft were briefly flown by FAEC prior to the ousting of President Fulgencio Batista and the assumption of power by Fidel Castro. Following the change in government, the Sea Furies were retained by the Fuerza <b>Aérea</b> Revolucionaria ("Revolutionary Air Force"; FAR); the Sea Fury proved difficult to keep operational, partially because the new military lacked personnel experienced with the type.|$|E
25|$|In 1934, {{the airline}} merged with Aero Espresso Italiana, Società Italiana Servizi Aerei (SISA) and Società <b>Aerea</b> Mediterranea (SAM), to form Ala Littoria, the pre-war {{national}} airline of Italy.|$|E

25|$|On 28 March 1941, he was {{promoted}} to the rank of Generale di Brigata <b>Aerea.</b> August 1941 saw him appointed as Chief of Staff of the Italian transport command, the Servizi Aerei Speciale. When the Regia Nauticas loyalties were split by the 8 September 1943 Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces, General Marziale Cerutti plumped for Benito Mussolini's faction and joined the Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana. As a result of this decision, the end of World War II saw Cerutti removed from duty by the victorious Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force faction of the Regia Aeronautica. While awaiting a review of his military status, Generale di Brigata <b>Aerea</b> Marziale Cerutti went for a ride on his home-built motorcycle on 26 May 1946. He was killed in a traffic accident.|$|E
25|$|The Fuerza <b>Aérea</b> del Peru (FAP) flew many sorties with A-37B, Mirage 5P and Su-22 {{to support}} these operations.

25|$|Portugal {{was officially}} neutral during World War II, {{although}} the Allies {{were allowed to}} use or establish ports and airfields on various Portuguese territories.

The Cuban air force armed inventory included Douglas B-26 Invader light bombers, Hawker Sea Fury fighters, and Lockheed T-33 jets, all remaining from the Fuerza <b>Aérea</b> del Ejército de Cuba (FAEC), the Cuban air {{force of the}} Batista government.|$|E
25|$|In 1965, President Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco outlawed the {{operation}} of fixed-wing aircraft by the MB; this remained {{the responsibility of the}} Força <b>Aérea</b> Brasileira (FAB, Brazilian Air Force). As a result, Minas Gerais was required to embark two air groups: the Navy operated helicopters while the Air Force operated S-2 Tracker aircraft. Consequently, the ship spent most of her Brazilian career operating as an anti-submarine warfare carrier.|$|E
25|$|The airline, {{founded on}} 14 March 1945 as Transportes Aéreos Portugueses, SGPS, S.A. (Portuguese Air Transportations), began {{commercial}} services on 19 September 1946, with {{a flight from}} Lisbon to Madrid using a Douglas DC-3. On 31 December, TAP Air Portugal began its Linha <b>Aérea</b> Imperial, a twelve-stop colonial service including Luanda, Angola and Lourenço Marques (now Maputo), Mozambique. It covered 24.450km with in 15 days (both ways), making it was the longest air service operated with twin-engine airliners.|$|E

25|$|The Argentine Air Force (Fuerza <b>Aérea</b> Argentina; FAA) {{had never}} {{considered}} the possibility of waging a long-range naval air campaign against a major NATO power. It was not trained or equipped for such a mission. The FAA had only two tanker aircraft to serve the whole air force and navy, and its fighter-bomber Mirage IIIs and IAI Daggers were not equipped for aerial refuelling. The FAA's training, tactics and equipment were focused on a possible war against Chile, resulting from disputes such as the Beagle conflict.|$|E
25|$|On 15 April 1961, crewed by Cuban exiles, eight B-26s of the FAL (Fuerza <b>Aérea</b> de Liberación) {{attacked}} three Cuban airfields, in {{an attempt}} to destroy FAR combat aircraft on the ground. On 17 April 1961, FAL B-26s supported the seaborne Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba. The conflict ended on 19 April, after the loss of nine FAL B-26s, 10 Cuban exiles and 4 American aircrew in combat. The FAR flew B-26Cs in the conflict, one of which was shot down by a CIA 'command ship' with the loss of 4 Cuban aircrew.|$|E
25|$|In early 1961, about 20 B-26Bs, most {{converted}} from B-26C configuration, were 'sanitized' at Duke Field (also known as Auxiliary Field Three at Eglin AFB), Florida. They had defensive armament removed, and were fitted with the eight-gun nose, underwing drop tanks, and rocket racks. They were flown to a CIA-run base in Guatemala where training {{was under way}} of B-26, C-46 and C-54 Cuban exile air crews by personnel from the Alabama Air National Guard. After transfer to Nicaragua in early April 1961, they were painted in the markings of the FAR (Fuerza <b>Aérea</b> Revolucionaria), the air force of the Cuban government.|$|E
