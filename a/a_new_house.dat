5|$|Upon being {{signed by}} the Rangers, Näslund and {{his family moved to}} Tarrytown, New York. Following his {{retirement}} from the NHL in 2009, they returned to Sweden, where Näslund began coaching his son's minor-league hockey team before he became the general manager of Modo. He participated in the construction of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>house</b> in Örnsköldsvik that his family moved into.|$|E
5|$|A notable {{cultural}} {{trait of}} Chiprovtsi shared {{with much of}} the region is the veneration of a family patron saint, named svetets ("saint") and akin to Serbian slava. The practice exists since time immemorial and the family saint is thought to have been chosen by the taking of a random candle by an unaware person. The svetets is associated to the family house: when a daughter-in-law comes to live there, she accepts the family saint of the home, and when a family member or a foreign settler moves out or builds <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>house,</b> they adopt a new svetets.|$|E

5|$|After the {{restoration}} of the monarchy in 1660, the Bankes family regained their properties. Rather than rebuild Corfe Castle, the eldest son Ralph Bankes built a house on their other Dorset estate near Wimborne Minster. In 1663, he commissioned Sir Roger Pratt to design <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>house</b> to be known as Kingston Hall on the current site, based on Clarendon House which he had visited several times. Construction started the same year, and was completed by 1665.|$|E
5|$|As the two grew older, {{the letters}} became fewer and farther between. There {{was also a}} great deal that they kept to themselves. Jefferson said nothing about his {{construction}} of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>house,</b> domestic turmoil, slave ownership, or poor financial situation, while Adams {{did not mention the}} troublesome behavior of his son Thomas, who had failed as a lawyer and become an alcoholic, resorting afterwards to living primarily as a caretaker at Peacefield.|$|E

Carla has decided to take one year parental leave, and Laverne, Ted, and The Worthless Peons wonder how they can go on at the hospital without Carla's help ("Gonna Miss You, Carla"). Carla begins {{to realize that she}} does not want to separate herself from her work for so long.|$|E

5|$|During the English Civil War of the 1640s, Henry, {{a younger}} {{son in the}} Hastings family, became a Royalist {{commander}} in the Midlands. He based {{himself out of the}} castle until he was forced to surrender it after a long siege. A fresh rebellion occurred in 1648, leading Parliament to slight the castle in order to prevent it being used militarily: the two towers were badly damaged with gunpowder and undermining. Parts of the remaining castle were turned into <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>house</b> and continued to be used by members of the Hastings family for many years, although they moved their main residence to Donington Hall.|$|E
5|$|In 1819, Sir Walter Scott's novel Ivanhoe {{featured}} a scene involving a tournament at Ashby de la Zouch Castle; the novel was immensely popular {{and made the}} location famous. Edward Mammatt, Francis Rawdon's agent, repaired the castle ruins and opened them to visitors, whom Rawdon hoped to attract to the Ivanhoe Baths which he opened nearby. Ashby Place, which had become used as a House of Industry, was pulled down in 1830 and <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>house,</b> Ashby Manor, was built in its place. Work continued throughout the 19th century to repair the castle ruins, although they remained mostly covered in ivy.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, Chekhov's {{father was}} {{declared}} bankrupt after overextending his finances building <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>house,</b> having been cheated by a contractor called Mironov. To avoid debtor's prison he fled to Moscow, where his two eldest sons, Alexander and Nikolay, were attending university. The {{family lived in}} poverty in Moscow, Chekhov's mother physically and emotionally broken by the experience. Chekhov was left behind to sell the family's possessions and finish his education.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, the Fugees {{split to}} work on solo projects, which Jean later blamed on his tumultuous {{relationship}} with Hill and the fact he married his wife Claudinette while still involved with Hill. Meanwhile, {{in the summer of}} 1996 Hill had met Rohan Marley, a son of Bob Marley and a former University of Miami football player. Hill subsequently began a relationship with him, while still also involved with Jean. Hill became pregnant, and in August 1997, Marley and Hill's first child, Zion David, was born. The couple lived in Hill's childhood house in South Orange after she bought her parents <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>house</b> down the street.|$|E
5|$|Kristin Cavallari {{caught the}} bouquet at the wedding, and assumed the series' lead {{beginning}} {{in the second half}} of the season. She began a casual relationship with Brescia, at which point Patridge severed ties with him. Afterwards, the women developed a feud that continued through the remainder of the season. Meanwhile, Montag and Pratt purchased <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>house</b> and clashed over the decision to begin a family; Montag wished to have children, while Pratt opposed the thought.|$|E
5|$|Luscombe Castle is {{a country}} house {{situated}} near the resort town of Dawlish, in the county of Devon in England. Upon purchasing the land at Luscombe in 1797, Charles Hoare demolished the existing house and commissioned architects John Nash and Humphrey Repton to design <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>house</b> and gardens at the site. Nash and Repton {{came up with an}} asymmetrical designed building made from Portland stone, with castellated parapets, turrets and pinnacles to create the feel of a picturesque castle.|$|E

In November 1987, Robinson met his partner, Mark Andrew, while on vacation in St. Croix. Andrew was on vacation and worked in Washington, D.C., at the national office of the Peace Corps. On July 2, 1988, Robinson and Andrew moved into <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>house</b> and had it blessed by Bishop Douglas Theuner, an event which they {{considered to be the}} formal recognition of their life together. Andrew currently works in the New Hampshire state government.|$|E
5|$|The Campbells {{continued}} {{to add to}} the castle, building <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>house</b> over the old west range in 1725. However, the rest of the castle was already decaying. In 1810 an accidental fire gutted the castle, and the Captains ceased to live here, moving to Dunstaffnage House, some 2km to the south-east, until this too burned down in 1940. Tenants lived in the 1725 house within the castle until 1888.|$|E
5|$|By 1799, the {{original}} house at Luscombe had been demolished, and work began on <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>house</b> for Hoare in 1800. The house {{was designed by}} John Nash, who was a pioneer for the Gothic Revival style. In his early drawings for the house, Repton suggested two sketches to Hoare; one of a more standard house, {{and the other with}} the more natural design which would settle into the landscape. The latter was chosen and the final design of the house was based upon Downton Castle, but with an asymmetrical plan to experience the panoramic views around the house. It was Nash's first attempt at a Gothic castle design and he would subsequently create several further houses in the same style.|$|E

5|$|By {{early summer}} 1871, Morris began {{to search for}} a house outside London where his {{children}} could spend time away from the city's pollution. He settled on Kelmscott Manor in the village of Kelmscott, Oxfordshire, obtaining a joint tenancy on the building with Rossetti in June. Morris adored the building, which was constructed circa 1570, and would spend much time in the local countryside. Conversely, Rossetti would be unhappy at Kelmscott, and eventually suffered a mental breakdown. Morris divided his time between London and Kelmscott, however when Rossetti was there he would not spend more than three days at a time at the latter. He was also fed up with his family home in Queen Square, deciding to obtain <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>house</b> in London. Although retaining a personal bedroom and study at Queen Square, he relocated his family to Horrington House in Turnham Green Road, West London, in January 1873. This allowed him to be far closer to the home of Burne-Jones, with the duo meeting on almost every Sunday morning for the rest of Morris' life.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} George Luttrell {{inherited}} the castle in 1571, it was dilapidated, {{with the family}} preferring to live in their house, now known as Court House, at East Quantoxhead. In 1617 George employed the architect William Arnold, to create <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>house</b> in the Lower Ward of the castle. Arnold was an important architect in the south-west of England, and had managed the building of nearby Montacute and Cranborne House. The redesign expanded {{on some of the}} existing buildings and walls to create a 16th-century Jacobean mansion with a symmetrical front and square towers, set within the older castle walls and overlooked by the keep above. The building was decorated in the latest styles, including ornamental plaster ceilings. The project ran almost three times over budget, costing Luttrell more than £1,200.|$|E
5|$|Deshastha Rigvedi Brahmins still {{recite the}} Rig Veda at {{religious}} ceremonies, prayers and other occasions. These ceremonies include birth, wedding, initiation ceremonies, {{as well as}} death rituals. Other ceremonies for different occasions in Hindu life include Vastushanti which is performed before a family formally establishes residence in <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>house,</b> Satyanarayana Puja, originating in Bengal in the 19th century, is a ceremony performed before commencing any new endeavour or for no particular reason. Invoking {{the name of the}} family's gotra and the kula daivat are important aspects of these ceremonies. Like most other Hindu communities, Deshasthas have a shrine called a devaghar in their house with idols, symbols, and pictures of various deities. Ritual reading of religious texts called pothi is also popular.|$|E
