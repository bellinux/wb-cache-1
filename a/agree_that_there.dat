5|$|Scholars <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are no {{completely}} reliable {{methods of}} determining the exact chronology of musical instruments across cultures. Comparing and organizing instruments based on their complexity is misleading, since advancements in musical instruments have sometimes reduced complexity. For example, construction of early slit drums involved felling and hollowing out large trees; later slit drums were made by opening bamboo stalks, a much simpler task.|$|E
5|$|Around 877, Æthelred {{wrote to}} Pope John VIII to {{complain}} about King Alfred's conduct towards Canterbury. The exact nature of the dispute is not clear, but the reply from the pope to the archbishop still exists. The pope told the archbishop that Canterbury had papal support and that the pope had written to the king urging the king to respect {{the rights of the}} archbishop. The writer Justin Pollard sees this letter as evidence of papal support for the deposition of Alfred, which Pollard alleges occurred at Christmas 878 and that the deposition was supported by Æthelred. Other historians, however, do not <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a deposition of the king supported by the archbishop at this time.|$|E

25|$|A {{contract}} {{arises when}} the parties <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is an agreement. Formation {{of a contract}} generally requires an offer, acceptance, consideration, and a mutual intent to be bound. Each {{party to a contract}} must have capacity to enter the agreement. Minors, intoxicated persons, and those under a mental affliction may have insufficient capacity to enter a contract. Some types of contracts may require formalities, such as a memorialization in writing.|$|E
25|$|Rectal {{prolapse}} {{often used}} to mean complete rectal prolapse (external rectal prolapse), where the rectal walls have prolapsed to a degree where they protrude out the anus and are visible outside the body. However, most researchers <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are 3 to 5 different types of rectal prolapse, depending on if the prolapsed section is visible externally, and if the full or only partial thickness of the rectal wall is involved.|$|E

25|$|Genetic {{studies have}} been {{utilised}} {{in the study of}} pre-historic population movements. On the whole, scientists <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is evidence for a migration during the Neolithic. However, they cannot agree on the extent of this movement. The conclusions of studies appear to be 'operator dependent'. That is, results vary depending on what underlying mutation rates are assumed, and conclusions are drawn from how the authors 'envisage' their results fit with known archaeological and historic processes. Consequently, such studies must be interpreted with caution.|$|E

Philo reported that the Therapeutae's central meal was intended to emulate the holy table set forth in the sacred hall of the temple, but though the Qumran community are portrayed in the Dead Sea Scrolls as viewing the Jerusalem service as having failed to achieve priestly holiness, Philo describes the Therapeutae as deliberately introducing slight differences in their practices from those at the Temple, as a mark of respect for the Temple's shewbread.|$|E

25|$|The {{roots of}} the {{communal}} disharmony and violence between Hindus and Muslims {{goes back to the}} history of several centuries. Historical analysis of Hindu-Muslim conflict has been highly contentious. Contemporary historians of India do not even <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were Hindu or Muslim communal identities before the nineteenth century. Historians like Sarkar view Hindu-Muslim conflict as essentially modern phenomena as communal riots do seem to have been significantly rare down to the 1880s. However, on the other side are historians who argue that Hindu-Muslim conflict has a longer history and, according some arguments, extends into the early period of Mughal rule. According to this view, inter-religious strife and riots which resemble contemporary Hindu-Muslim conflict were present, even endemic, in pre-modern times.|$|E
25|$|Charles Carroll {{was portrayed}} by actor Terrence Currier in the 2004 film National Treasure with Nicolas Cage. He is {{accurately}} {{described as the}} last living signatory of the Declaration of Independence. Although the film does not explicitly state it, it is implied that Carroll died in Washington, D.C. It is inaccurately stated that Carroll was a Mason; historians of freemasonry <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{is no evidence that}} he was, though his son (also named Charles Carroll) is known to have been a member. A scene which did not make the final cut of the film (but appears as a deleted scene on the DVD) shows then-President Jackson rushing out of the White House to find Carroll's body in a carriage. Carroll is mentioned in the movie Gone with the Wind.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} {{semester}} of 2015, University Officials stated that they are seeking options to renovate or replace Beaver Stadium in the next 10 years. Officials state {{that there is a}} recognized need in an upgrade in the facilities. The stadium remains antiquated, despite multiple expansions and the additions of luxury boxes and high-definition scoreboards. Outdated plumbing requires complete winterization each November. Elevators are small and sluggish while concourses are narrow. The stadium lacks concession options and still uses bleachers. The limitations prevent wider use of the venue; the university would like to expand the number of events held at Beaver Stadium, such as major concerts and a long-discussed potential hosting of the NHL Winter Classic. Many fans are opposed to replacing Beaver Stadium due to the history and tradition but many <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a need for renovation.|$|E

25|$|On {{the night}} of 28 March sappers from the Viet Cong (VC) 409th Sapper Battalion {{approached}} the wire of FSB Mary Ann and took up positions to launch an attack. The exact number of sappers involved is uncertain, but most sources <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were at least 50. As was common practice for such units, the sappers wore khaki shorts and soot camouflage and were armed with either an AK-47 or RPG-7 and satchel charges and grenades to attack bunkers. Sappers relied on stealth, shock and surprise {{to give them an}} advantage, and rarely carried heavy weapons or equipment. The 409th was known to the intelligence section of the 196th LIB, but had previously operated against ARVN targets north of Quang Tin Province. It was assumed by the 196th LIB's intelligence personnel that both the 409th and the 402nd Sapper Battalions were east of FSB Mary Ann, preparing to attack ARVN targets in that region. None of them predicted an attack on the US base.|$|E
500|$|While many, if not all, <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is {{at least}} some sense in which the book {{can be said to}} be a [...] "dream", few agree on who the {{possible}} dreamer of such a dream might be. Edmund Wilson's early analysis of the book, The Dream of H. C. Earwicker, made the assumption that Earwicker himself is the dreamer of the dream, an assumption which continued to carry weight with Wakean scholars Harry Levin, Hugh Kenner, and William Troy. Joseph Campbell, in A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake, also believed Earwicker to be the dreamer, but considered the narrative to be the observances of, and a running commentary by, an anonymous pedant on Earwicker's dream in progress, who would interrupt the flow with his own digressions.|$|E
500|$|Until the 19th century AD, European-written music {{histories}} {{began with}} mythological accounts of how musical instruments were invented. Such accounts included Jubal, descendant of Cain and [...] "father of all such as handle the harp and the organ", Pan, {{inventor of the}} pan pipes, and Mercury, {{who is said to}} have made a dried tortoise shell into the first lyre. Modern histories have replaced such mythology with anthropological speculation, occasionally informed by archeological evidence. Scholars <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was no definitive [...] "invention" [...] of the musical instrument since the definition of the term [...] "musical instrument" [...] is completely subjective to both the scholar and the would-be inventor. For example, a Homo habilis slapping his body could be the makings of a musical instrument regardless of the being's intent.|$|E

500|$|Throughout society, {{circumcision}} {{is often}} considered for {{reasons other than}} medical need. Public health advocates of circumcision consider it to have a net benefit, and therefore feel that increasing the circumcision rate is an ethical imperative. They recommend performing the procedure during the neonatal period when it is less expensive and has a lower risk of complications. While studies show there is a modest epidemiological benefit to circumcision, critics argue that the number of circumcisions {{that would have to be}} performed would yield an overall negative public health outcome due to the resulting number of complications or other negative effects (such as pain). Pinto (2012) writes [...] "sober proponents and detractors of circumcision <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is no overwhelming medical evidence to support either side." [...] This type of cost-benefit analysis is highly dependent on the kinds and frequencies of health problems in the population under discussion and how circumcision affects those health problems.|$|E
500|$|Many dog writers {{after the}} early 19th century seem to <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were two {{varieties}} of terrier existing in Britain at the time—a rough-haired so-called Scotch Terrier and a smooth-haired English Terrier. Thomas Brown, in his Biological Sketches and Authentic Anecdotes of Dogs (1829), states that [...] "the Scotch terrier {{is certainly the}} purest in point of breed and the (smooth) English {{seems to have been}} produced by a cross from him". [...] Brown went on to describe the Scotch Terrier as [...] "low in stature, with a strong muscular body, short stout legs, a head large in proportion to the body" [...] and was [...] "generally of a sandy colour or black" [...] with a [...] "long, matted and hard" [...] coat. [...] Although the Scotch Terrier described here is more generic than specific to a breed, it asserts the existence of a small, hard, rough-coated terrier developed for hunting small game in the Scottish Highlands in the early 19th century; a description that shares characteristics with what was once known as the Aberdeen Terrier and is today known as the Scottish Terrier. In addition, the paintings of Sir Edwin Landseer and an 1835 lithograph entitled [...] "Scottish Terriers at Work on a Cairn in the West Highlands" [...] both depict Scottie type terriers very similar to those described in the first Scottish Terrier Standard.|$|E
500|$|All {{acknowledged}} subject {{experts and}} authorities <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{is no evidence}} of cricket having evolved from another bat-and-ball sport and, equally, no evidence that any other bat-and-ball sport evolved from cricket. The authorities include writers Harry Altham, John Arlott, Derek Birley, Arthur Haygarth, David Underdown, Roy Webber and Peter Wynne-Thomas. Their consensus view is that {{the only thing that can}} definitely be said about the origin of cricket is that its earliest record is in a late 16th-century court case in Surrey which proves it was played by children in southeast England in the middle of that century. There have been alternative theories of origin but these have been dismissed or ignored by authorities. For example, the writer Andrew Lang claimed in 1912 that cricket evolved from a bat-and-ball game which may have been played in Dál Riata as early as the 6th century and this claim has been dismissed, by Anthony Bateman among others, in terms of [...] "Lang's idiosyncratic belief in the Celtic origin of cricket". It is true that cricket is one of many bat-and-ball sports existing worldwide which have no known origin. Others are the definitely Celtic sports of hurling and shinty. Golf and hockey are other British ball games involving a club or stick while croquet was apparently imported from France and globally there are games such as Sweden's brännboll, Italy's , India's gilli-danda, Finland's pesäpallo and Samoa's kilikiti. However, it is generally believed that cricket essentially belongs to the same family of bat-and-ball games as stoolball, rounders and baseball but whether it evolved from any of these, or vice versa, cannot be determined. There is a 1523 reference to stoolball at a designated field in Oxfordshire; this may then have been a generic term for any game in which a ball is somehow hit with a bat or stick. 18th century references to stoolball in conjunction with cricket clearly indicate that it was a separate activity.|$|E
