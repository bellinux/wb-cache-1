5|$|<b>Anticonvulsants</b> {{suppress}} epileptic seizures, {{but they}} neither cure nor prevent {{the development of}} seizure susceptibility. The development of epilepsy (epileptogenesis) {{is a process that}} is poorly understood. A few <b>anticonvulsants</b> (valproate, levetiracetam and benzodiazepines) have shown antiepileptogenic properties in animal models of epileptogenesis. However, no anticonvulsant has ever achieved this in a clinical trial in humans. The ketogenic diet has been found to have antiepileptogenic properties in rats.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{medications}} {{may cause}} weight gain or changes in body composition; these include insulin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, atypical antipsychotics, antidepressants, steroids, certain <b>anticonvulsants</b> (phenytoin and valproate), pizotifen, and {{some forms of}} hormonal contraception.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy {{occurs in}} a number of other animals {{including}} dogs and cats and is the most common brain disorder in dogs. It is typically treated with <b>anticonvulsants</b> such as phenobarbital or bromide in dogs and phenobarbital in cats. Imepitoin is also used in dogs. While generalized seizures in horses are fairly easy to diagnose, it may be more difficult in non-generalized seizures and EEGs may be useful.|$|E
30|$|<b>Anticonvulsant</b> {{activity}} was studied by [40] in extracts from {{leaves of the}} Ukrainian flora shrubs showing that Corylus avellana dry aqueous extract can be a promising substance with <b>anticonvulsant</b> properties. Avocado leaf extract also was reported having <b>anticonvulsant</b> activity [17]. Olives were also reported having <b>anticonvulsant</b> properties [35].|$|R
40|$|<b>Anticonvulsant</b> Hypersensitivity Syndrome has a triad of fever, rash and visceral {{involvement}} occuring 1 to 8 {{weeks after}} an exposure to an aromatic <b>anticonvulsant</b> drug, such as phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine or primidone. The timely recognition of <b>Anticonvulsant</b> Hypersensitivity Syndrome is important, because accurate diagnosis avoids potentially fatal reexposure and affects subsequent <b>anticonvulsant</b> treatment options...|$|R
40|$|Children with {{epilepsy}} {{are at risk}} {{of having}} their <b>anticonvulsant</b> regimens disrupted during the home-to-hospital transition. We sought to estimate the frequency of <b>anticonvulsant</b> medication errors during transition into the hospital in children with epilepsy hospitalized for reasons other than seizures, and to examine factors associated with the occurrence of such errors. We examined the medical records to identify errors related to <b>anticonvulsant</b> administration during the transition into the hospital and we examined potential risk factors for error occurrence. Errors were classified as relating to dosing quantity or missing a dose. Among 120 children, 29 (24 %) experienced an <b>anticonvulsant</b> medication error. In a multivariable model, the risk factors of changes in responsibility for <b>anticonvulsant</b> administration and frequency of <b>anticonvulsant</b> administration were strongly asso-ciated with increased odds of errors. <b>Anticonvulsant</b> medication errors during the home-to-hospital transition may be unaccep-tably common in children with epilepsy hospitalized for reasons other than seizures...|$|R
5|$|Potassium bromide {{and sodium}} bromide {{were used as}} <b>anticonvulsants</b> and {{sedatives}} in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but were gradually superseded by chloral hydrate {{and then by the}} barbiturates. In {{the early years of the}} First World War, bromine compounds such as xylyl bromide were used as poison gas.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is usually}} initiated {{in combination with}} the patient's existing anticonvulsant regimen, though patients may be weaned off <b>anticonvulsants</b> if the diet is successful. There is some evidence of synergistic benefits when the diet is combined with the vagus nerve stimulator or with the drug zonisamide, and that the diet may be less successful in children receiving phenobarbital.|$|E
5|$|Bromide compounds, {{especially}} potassium bromide, {{were frequently}} used as general sedatives in the 19th and early 20th century. Bromides {{in the form}} of simple salts are still used as <b>anticonvulsants</b> in both veterinary and human medicine, although the latter use varies from country to country. For example, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not approve bromide for the treatment of any disease, and it was removed from over-the-counter sedative products like Bromo-Seltzer, in 1975.|$|E
40|$|Literature on the <b>anticonvulsant</b> {{effects of}} the {{ketogenic}} diet (KD) in mouse seizure models is summarized. Recent data show that a KD balanced in vitamin, mineral, and antioxidant content is <b>anticonvulsant</b> in mice, confirming that the KD 2 ̆ 7 s effect in mice {{can be attributed to}} the composition of the diet and not other dietary factors. Given that the <b>anticonvulsant</b> mechanism of the KD is still unknown, the <b>anticonvulsant</b> profile of the diet in different seizure models may help to decipher this mechanism. The implications of the findings that the KD is <b>anticonvulsant</b> in electrical seizure models are indicated. Further, the potential involvement of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the KD 2 ̆ 7 s <b>anticonvulsant</b> mechanism is discussed...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} new N-(substituted) - 1 -methyl- 2, 4 -dioxo- 1, 2 -dihydroquinazoline- 3 (4 H) -carboxamides were designed, synthesized, and {{evaluated}} for their <b>anticonvulsant</b> activity. Most of the synthesized compounds exhibited potent <b>anticonvulsant</b> {{activities in the}} maximal electroshock (MES) and pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) test. The most promising compound 4 c showed significant <b>anticonvulsant</b> activity with a protective index value of 3. 58. The compounds 4 a–c were also found to have encouraging <b>anticonvulsant</b> activity in the MES and PTZ screen {{when compared with the}} standard drugs, valproate and methaqualone. The same compounds were found to exhibit advanced <b>anticonvulsant</b> activity as well as lower neurotoxicity than the reference drugs...|$|R
40|$|Preparations of Carissa edulis (Vahl) {{have been}} used in the Nigerian {{traditional}} medicine for the management of fever, sickle cell disease, epilepsy, pain cancer and inflammatory conditions for many years and their efficacy is widely acclaimed among the Hausa communities of Northern Nigeria. The possible mechanism(s) involved in the <b>anticonvulsant</b> action of residual aqueous fraction of ethanol root bark extract of Carissa edulis (RAF) were determined using flumazenil, naloxone, cyproheptadine, bisindolylmaleimide (BIM), ibuprofen and misoprostol. Flumazenil antagonized the <b>anticonvulsant</b> effect of both RAF and diazepam, while BIM promoted their <b>anticonvulsant</b> effect. However, naloxone and cyproheptadine did not affect the RAF <b>anticonvulsant</b> effect. Ketoprofen increased the RAF and valproate <b>anticonvulsant</b> activity while misoprostol did not alter their effects. The interaction studies revealed that GABAergic, glycine, serotonergic and opioid neurotransmission were found {{to be involved in the}} RAF <b>anticonvulsant</b> effects...|$|R
5|$|Prolonged convulsive epileptic {{seizures}} are {{a medical}} emergency that {{can usually be}} dealt with effectively by administering fast-acting benzodiazepines, which are potent <b>anticonvulsants.</b> In a hospital environment, intravenous clonazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam are first-line choices, clonazepam due to its stronger and more potent anticonvulsant action, diazepam due to its faster onset and lorazepam for its longer duration of action. In the community, intravenous administration is not practical and so rectal diazepam or (more recently) buccal midazolam are used, with a preference for midazolam as its administration is easier and more socially acceptable.|$|E
5|$|Raised {{intracranial}} pressure, if severe or threatening vision, {{may require}} therapeutic lumbar puncture (removal of excessive cerebrospinal fluid), medication (acetazolamide), or neurosurgical treatment (optic nerve sheath fenestration or shunting). In certain situations, <b>anticonvulsants</b> {{may be used}} to try to prevent seizures. These situations include focal neurological problems (e.g. inability to move a limb) and focal changes of the brain tissue on CT or MRI scan. Evidence to support or refute the use of antiepileptic drugs as a preventive measure, however, is lacking.|$|E
5|$|Many drugs, {{including}} oral contraceptives, some antibiotics, antidepressants, and antifungal agents, inhibit cytochrome enzymes in the liver. They {{reduce the}} rate of elimination of the benzodiazepines that are metabolized by CYP450, leading to possibly excessive drug accumulation and increased side-effects. In contrast, drugs that induce cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as St John's wort, the antibiotic rifampicin, and the <b>anticonvulsants</b> carbamazepine and phenytoin, accelerate elimination of many benzodiazepines and decrease their action. Taking benzodiazepines with alcohol, opioids and other central nervous system depressants potentiates their action. This often results in increased sedation, impaired motor coordination, suppressed breathing, and other adverse effects that have potential to be lethal. Antacids can slow down absorption of some benzodiazepines; however, this effect is marginal and inconsistent.|$|E
50|$|Incorrect dosage amount: A {{patient may}} be {{receiving}} a sub-therapeutic {{level of the}} <b>anticonvulsant.</b> Switching medicines: This may include withdrawal of <b>anticonvulsant</b> medication without replacement, replaced with a less effective medication, or changed too rapidly to another <b>anticonvulsant.</b> In some cases, switching from brand to a generic {{version of the same}} medicine may induce a breakthrough seizure.|$|R
50|$|Kindling {{models in}} rats has shown {{vinpocetine}} to exhibit <b>anticonvulsant</b> properties. The most pronounced <b>anticonvulsant</b> effects {{were observed in}} Pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-kindled rats although {{there was also an}} effect on amygdala-kindled and neocortically-kindled rats. Vinpocetine has also been shown to abolish 3HGlu release after in vivo exposure to 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) which suggests an important mechanism for vinpocetine <b>anticonvulsant</b> activity.|$|R

5|$|There are {{theoretically}} {{no restrictions}} {{on where the}} ketogenic diet might be used, and it can cost less than modern <b>anticonvulsants.</b> However, fasting and dietary changes are affected by religious and cultural issues. A culture where food is often prepared by grandparents or hired help means more people must be educated about the diet. When families dine together, sharing the same meal, {{it can be difficult}} to separate the child's meal. In many countries, food labelling is not mandatory so calculating the proportions of fat, protein and carbohydrate is difficult. In some countries, it may be hard to find sugar-free forms of medicines and supplements, to purchase an accurate electronic scale, or to afford MCT oils.|$|E
5|$|Children who {{discontinue}} {{the diet}} after achieving seizure freedom {{have about a}} 20% risk of seizures returning. The length of time until recurrence is highly variable but averages two years. This risk of recurrence compares with 10% for resective surgery (where {{part of the brain}} is removed) and 30–50% for anticonvulsant therapy. Of those that have a recurrence, just over half can regain freedom from seizures either with <b>anticonvulsants</b> or by returning to the ketogenic diet. Recurrence is more likely if, despite seizure freedom, an electroencephalogram (EEG) shows epileptiform spikes, which indicate epileptic activity in the brain but are below the level that will cause a seizure. Recurrence is also likely if an MRI scan shows focal abnormalities (for example, as in children with tuberous sclerosis). Such children may remain on the diet longer than average, and {{it has been suggested that}} children with tuberous sclerosis who achieve seizure freedom could remain on the ketogenic diet indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|Pain: {{acute pain}} is mainly due to optic {{neuritis}} (with corticosteroids {{being the best}} treatment available), as well as trigeminal neuralgia, Lhermitte's sign, or dysesthesias. Subacute pain is usually secondary to the disease and can be a consequence of spending too long in the same position, urinary retention, and infected skin ulcers, amongst others. Treatment will depend on cause. Chronic pain is very common and harder to treat as its most common cause is dysesthesias. Acute pain due to trigeminal neuralgia is usually successfully treated with <b>anticonvulsants</b> such as carbamazepine or phenytoin. Both Lhermitte's sign and painful dysesthesias usually respond to treatment with carbamazepine, clonazepam, or amitriptyline. Sativex is approved for treatment of pain in MS in different countries, but due to its derivation from cannabis, it is currently not available in others, such as the USA. This medication is also being investigated {{for the management of}} other MS symptoms, such as spasticity, and has shown long-term safety and efficacy.|$|E
25|$|Tolerance to the <b>anticonvulsant</b> {{effects of}} {{clonazepam}} occurs in both animals and humans. In humans, tolerance to the <b>anticonvulsant</b> effects of clonazepam occurs frequently. Chronic use of benzodiazepines {{can lead to}} the development of tolerance with a decrease of benzodiazepine binding sites. The degree of tolerance is more pronounced with clonazepam than with chlordiazepoxide. In general, short-term therapy is more effective than long-term therapy with clonazepam for the treatment of epilepsy. Many studies have found that tolerance develops to the <b>anticonvulsant</b> properties of clonazepam with chronic use, which limits its long-term effectiveness as an <b>anticonvulsant.</b>|$|R

5|$|The mainstays of {{treatment}} are removal {{from the source}} of lead and, {{for people who have}} significantly high blood lead levels or who have symptoms of poisoning, chelation therapy. Treatment of iron, calcium, and zinc deficiencies, which are associated with increased lead absorption, is another part {{of treatment}} for lead poisoning. When lead-containing materials are present in the gastrointestinal tract (as evidenced by abdominal X-rays), whole bowel irrigation, cathartics, endoscopy, or even surgical removal may be used to eliminate it from the gut and prevent further exposure. Lead-containing bullets and shrapnel may also present a threat of further exposure and may need to be surgically removed if they are in or near fluid-filled or synovial spaces. If lead encephalopathy is present, <b>anticonvulsants</b> may be given to control seizures, and treatments to control swelling of the brain include corticosteroids and mannitol. Treatment of organic lead poisoning involves removing the lead compound from the skin, preventing further exposure, treating seizures, and possibly chelation therapy for people with high blood lead concentrations.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anticonvulsants</b> {{affect the}} bones in many ways. They cause hypophosphatemia, hypocalcemia, low Vitamin D levels, and {{increased}} parathyroid hormone. <b>Anticonvulsants</b> {{also contribute to the}} increased rate of fractures by causing somnolence, ataxia, and tremor which would cause gait disturbance, further increasing the risk of fractures on top of the increase due to seizures and the restrictions on activity placed on epileptic people.Increased fracture rate has also been reported for carbamazepine, valproate and clonazepam. The risk of fractures is higher for people taking enzyme-inducing <b>anticonvulsants</b> than for people taking non-enzyme-inducing <b>anticonvulsants.</b> In addition to all of the above, primidone can cause arthralgia.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the good}} <b>anticonvulsant</b> {{activity}} of various 1, 2, 4 -triazoles, several new N 4 -substituted triazolylthiazoles were prepared by the general method for 1, 2, 4 -triazole ring closure. <b>Anticonvulsant</b> activity of compounds was measured against pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures in mice by intraperitoneal injections of different doses of the test compounds. Pretreatment of animals with flumazenil (10 mg/kg, i. p.) as a benzodiazepine receptors antagonist {{did not have any}} significant effect on <b>anticonvulsant</b> activity of the test compounds.

40|$|The plasma {{concentrations}} of <b>anticonvulsant</b> drugs, and of certain of their biologically active metabolites, {{tend to be}} proportionate to the antiepileptic effects of these drugs. Consequently, <b>anticonvulsant</b> drug levels in plasma are monitored to help guide the clinician in managing his patients’ epilepsies. In making use of the measurements, the clinician needs to know the relation between plasma level and biological effect for the various drugs. He also needs to have some awareness of simple pharmacokinetic principles. These are important in deciding when plasma levels should be monitored {{in relation to the}} patients’ clinical state, to the dosage interval, and to change in the dosage of <b>anticonvulsant</b> or other drug. The clinician also requires pharmacokinetic knowledge in altering <b>anticonvulsant</b> drug dosage in his patients, and in interpreting plasma <b>anticonvulsant</b> level data, particularly when the patient is concurrently suffering from non-neurological disease. The ability to monitor plasma <b>anticonvulsant</b> levels has appreciably improved the treatment of epilepsy, but to obtain maximum benefits from the method, both pharmacokinetic insight and clinical wisdom are required...|$|R
40|$|Attention-deficit {{hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) is a developmental disorder of childhood {{that is increasingly}} diagnosed in adults. Optimal pharmacological treatment for the disorder {{has not yet been}} established. Stimulant medication has remained the mainstay of treatment, but recent research suggests that <b>anticonvulsant</b> medication may also be useful in the treatment of ADHD symptoms in adults. The present retrospective study examined the effectiveness of a combined regime of stimulant and low dose <b>anticonvulsant</b> medication for the treatment of ADHD symptoms in an outpatient population of 28 adults. Measures used to assess improvements in symptoms included the Conners’ Adults ADHD Rating Scale(CAARS), the Developmental Eye Movement (DEM) test, and a visual analogue scale (VAS) used to measure the participants self-reported improvements in overall functioning. It was hypothesised that the addition of <b>anticonvulsant</b> medication would lead to improvements in self and observer rated symptoms on the CAARS scale, beyond those observed when stimulant medication was administered alone. Another hypothesis stated that participants would rate themselves as having improved in overall functioning since commencing <b>anticonvulsant</b> medication, and that the degree of improvement would be similar to that experienced when they first commenced stimulant treatment. Finally, there was an expectation that participants’ performance on the DEM test would improve following the introduction of <b>anticonvulsant</b> medication, providing evidence for enhanced cognitive functioning. Results showed that participants rated their symptoms as significantly less severe following the introduction of <b>anticonvulsant</b> medication to their treatment regime. However, the participant’s relatives or significant others did not note a significant change in ADHD symptoms when <b>anticonvulsant</b> medication was used in conjunction with stimulant medication. As expected, participants rated themselves as having improved in overall functioning following the introduction of <b>anticonvulsant</b> medication to their stimulant treatment regime and the level of improvement was comparable to that experienced after they were first treated with stimulant medication. Following the introduction of <b>anticonvulsant</b> medication, the time it took participants to complete the horizontal subtest of the DEM test significantly improved. No significant results were found for the vertical and ratio scores on the DEM test. These findings provide evidence that low dose <b>anticonvulsant</b> medication may be safely used in conjunction with stimulant medication to improve ADHD symptoms in adults. There is also evidence to suggest that the addition of <b>anticonvulsant</b> medication leads to an improvement in perception of overall functioning. Low dose <b>anticonvulsant</b> treatment may improve some cognitive functions,specifically oculomotor eye movements in adults diagnosed with ADHD. The results of this investigation provide preliminary support for the use of <b>anticonvulsant</b> medication in conjunction with stimulant medication for the treatment of ADHD symptoms. However, several methodological limitations restrict the generalisability of the results, and placebo-controlled randomised trials are needed to further investigate the use to <b>anticonvulsant</b> medication in this population...|$|R
40|$|The <b>anticonvulsant</b> {{activity}} of several 1, 2, 4 -triazole- 3 -thione derivatives on mouse maximal electroshock-induced seizures was tested in this study.

Structure-activity observations showed that the probability of obtaining compounds exerting <b>anticonvulsant</b> activity was much higher when {{at least one of}} the phenyl rings attached to 1, 2, 4 -triazole nucleus had a substituent at the para position. The obtained results, moreover, permit us to conclude that despite the structural similarity of loreclezole (second-generation <b>anticonvulsant</b> drug) and the titled compounds, their <b>anticonvulsant</b> activity is achieved via completely different molecular mechanisms...|$|R
