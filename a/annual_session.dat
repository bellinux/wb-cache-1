5|$|The state {{legislature}} {{is made up}} of two bodies, the Senate, which has 35 members, and the House of Representatives, with 70 members. South Dakota is divided into 35 legislative districts, with voters electing two representatives and one senator per district. The legislature meets for an <b>annual</b> <b>session</b> which begins on the second Tuesday in January and lasts for 30 days; it also meets if a special session is called by the governor.|$|E
5|$|During its 2002 <b>annual</b> <b>session,</b> the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) added 14 {{amendments}} to the Constitution of Indonesia. Included in these amendments were measures to reorganize the legislature. Beginning in 2004, the MPR was composed of the existing People's Representative Council (DPR) and a new Regional Representative Council (DPD). Because all {{the seats in the}} MPR were directly elected, this called for removal of the military from the legislature, whose 38 seats in the Assembly were appointed. This change and an amendment for direct election of the President and Vice President were major steps for Indonesia on the road towards a full democracy.|$|E
50|$|The {{legislative}} session in 2010 that referred Measure 71 to voters {{was a special}} session approved during the 2009 session {{by a majority of}} legislators, who were hoping to eventually win approval of a change to regular <b>annual</b> <b>sessions.</b> The push for <b>annual</b> <b>sessions</b> dates back to at least 1981, when a poll of legislators found that two-thirds favored a shift to <b>annual</b> <b>sessions.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{body that}} sets broad {{strategic}} goals for NATO is the NATO Parliamentary Assembly (NATO-PA) which meets at the <b>Annual</b> <b>Session,</b> {{and one other}} time during the year, and is the organ that directly interacts with the parliamentary structures of the national governments of the member states which appoint Permanent Members, or ambassadors to NATO. The NATO Parliamentary Assembly {{is made up of}} legislators from the member countries of the North Atlantic Alliance as well as thirteen associate members. Karl A. Lamers, German Deputy Chairman of the Defence Committee of the Bundestag {{and a member of the}} Christian Democratic Union, became president of the assembly in 2010. It is however officially a different structure from NATO, and has as aim to join together deputies of NATO countries in order to discuss security policies on the NATO Council.|$|E
5|$|The {{partition}} of Bengal (1905) {{resulted in the}} introduction of a new flag representing the Indian independence movement that sought to unite the multitude of castes and races within the country. The Vande Mataram flag, part of the Swadeshi movement against the British, comprised Indian religious symbols represented in western heraldic fashion. The tricolour flag included eight white lotuses on the upper green band representing the eight provinces, a sun and a crescent on the bottom red band, and the Vande Mataram slogan in Hindi on the central yellow band. The flag was launched in Calcutta bereft of any ceremony and the launch was only briefly covered by newspapers. The flag was not covered in contemporary governmental or political reports either, but was used at the <b>annual</b> <b>session</b> of the Indian National Congress. A slightly modified version was subsequently used by Madam Bhikaji Cama at the second International Socialist Congress in Stuttgart in 1907. Despite the multiple uses of the flag, it failed to generate enthusiasm amongst Indian nationalists.|$|E
5|$|Although Fillmore {{had retired}} from the {{legislature}} after the 1831 session, he did not remain absent from politics for long. In 1832, {{he ran for the}} House of Representatives, and was elected. The Anti-Masonic presidential candidate, former Attorney General William Wirt, won only Vermont as President Jackson easily gained re-election. At the time, Congress convened its <b>annual</b> <b>session</b> in December, and so Fillmore had to wait {{more than a year after}} his election to take his seat. Fillmore, Weed, and others had realized that opposition to Masonry was too narrow a foundation on which to build a national party, and assembled the broad-based Whig Party from National Republicans, Anti-Masons, and disaffected Democrats. The Whigs were initially united by their opposition to Jackson, but became a major party by expanding their platform to include support for economic growth through rechartering the Second Bank of the United States and federally funded internal improvements including roads, bridges, and canals. Weed joined the Whigs before Fillmore, and became a power within the party; his anti-slavery views were stronger than Fillmore's (who, though he disliked slavery, deemed the federal government without power over it), and closer to those of another prominent New York Whig, William H. Seward of Auburn, who was also seen as a Weed protégé.|$|E

5|$|During its <b>annual</b> <b>session</b> in 2000, the WMO/ESCAP Panel on North Indian Tropical Cyclones {{agreed in}} {{principle}} to start assigning names to cyclonic storms that developed within the North Indian Ocean. As a result of this, the panel requested that each member country submit a list of ten names to a rapporteur {{by the end of}} 2000. At the 2001 session, the rapporteur reported that of the eight countries involved, only India had refused to submit a list of names, as it had some reservations about assigning names to tropical cyclones. The panel then studied the names and felt that some of the names would not be appealing to the public or the media and thus requested that members submit new lists of names. During 2002 the rapporteur reported {{that there had been a}} poor response by member countries in resubmitting their lists of names. Over the next year, each country except India submitted a fresh list. By the 2004 session, India had still not submitted its list despite promising to do so. However, the rapporteur presented the lists of names that would be used with a gap left for India's names. The rapporteur also recommended that the naming lists be used on an experimental basis during the season, starting in May or June 2004. The naming lists were then completed in May 2004, after India submitted their names. However, the lists were not used until September 2004, when the first tropical cyclone was named Onil by the India Meteorological Department (IMD).|$|E
