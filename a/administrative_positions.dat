5|$|In 326, Constantine {{reversed}} this pro-equestrian trend, raising many <b>administrative</b> <b>positions</b> to senatorial {{rank and}} thus opening these offices {{to the old}} aristocracy, {{and at the same}} time elevating the rank of already existing equestrian office-holders to senator, degrading the equestrian order —at least as a bureaucratic rank —in the process, so that by the end of the 4th century the title of perfectissimus was granted only to mid-low officials.|$|E

Class mottos typically have verbiage that rhymes or is phonetically similar with their class year.|$|E
5|$|Five leading {{families}} or factions contended for power during this period—the Shahs, Thapas, Basnyats, Pandes, and the Chautariyas, who were of Shah dynasty but acted as counselors for the King. Working for these {{families and their}} factions were hill Brahmans, who acted as religious preceptors or astrologers, and Newars, who occupied secondary <b>administrative</b> <b>positions.</b> No {{one else in the}} country had any influence on the central government. When a family or faction achieved power, it killed, exiled, or demoted members of opposing alliances. Under these circumstances, there was little opportunity for either public political life or coordinated economic development.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the members}} of the 149th WAAC Post Headquarters Company was Tech4 Carmen Contreras-Bozak, who served in Algiers within General Dwight D. Eisenhower's theatre headquarters. Contreras joined the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC) in 1942 and was sent to Fort Lee, Virginia for training. Contreras volunteered to be part of the 149th WAAC Post Headquarters Company, thus {{becoming}} the first Hispanic to serve as an interpreter and in numerous <b>administrative</b> <b>positions.</b> The unit was the first WAAC unit to go overseas, setting sail from New York Harbor for Europe on January 1943.|$|E

5|$|Royal {{officials}} {{were divided into}} three categories; officials attached to the palace, officials of central administration and officials of provincial administration. One {{of the most important}} positions was the purohita, the advisor of the king. The king also had a board of ministers called amati paheja. In central administration, senapati (Commander-in-Chief of the Army) was a position second only to the king, and held by a member of nobility. This position, and also the positions of yuvaraja (sub king), <b>administrative</b> <b>positions</b> in the country's provinces and major ports and provinces, were often held by relatives of the king.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Davis {{served in}} a number of <b>administrative</b> <b>positions</b> in the United States. On August 10, 1945, he was {{assigned}} to the 556th Air Base Unit at Long Beach, California. On August 24, 1946, he was offered a commission as a first lieutenant in the active duty Army Air Corps, demoting him from his temporary rank but effectively allowing him to stay in the military in spite of the demobilization and downsizing of the US military. Several weeks later on September 7, Davis was ordered to the 554th Air Base Unit in Memphis, Tennessee, where he served on one of the Army Air Corps aerobatic demonstration teams, the predecessors to the United States Air Force Thunderbirds.|$|E

5|$|Booker's mayoralty and {{personal}} celebrity drew much media attention to Newark. While he enjoyed high ratings from city residents, his legacy has received mixed reviews. During his tenure, {{millions of dollars}} were invested in downtown development, but underemployment and high murder rates continue to characterize many of the city's neighborhoods. Despite legal challenges initiated during his term, Newark Public Schools has remained under {{control of the state}} for nearly twenty years. Newark received $32 million in emergency state aid in 2011 and 2012, requiring a memorandum of understanding between Newark and the state that obligates the city to request and the state to approve appointments to city hall <b>administrative</b> <b>positions.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1918 Whitehead's {{academic}} responsibilities {{began to}} seriously expand as he accepted {{a number of}} high <b>administrative</b> <b>positions</b> within the University of London system, of which Imperial College London was a member at the time. He was elected dean of the Faculty of Science at the University of London in late 1918 (a post he held for four years), {{a member of the}} University of London's Senate in 1919, and chairman of the Senate's Academic (leadership) Council in 1920, a post which he held until he departed for America in 1924. Whitehead was able to exert his newfound influence to successfully lobby for a new history of science department, help establish a Bachelor of Science degree (previously only Bachelor of Arts degrees had been offered), and make the school more accessible to less wealthy students.|$|E
5|$|Major General Charles Edward Maurice Lloyd, CBE (2 February 1899 – 31 May 1956) was {{a senior}} officer in the Australian Army.

5|$|By {{the evening}} of 28 February, a curfew was imposed in 27 towns and cities {{of the state in}} an attempt to curb the violence. Over the next two days, Bharuch, Rajkot and later Surat were hit. Approximately 151 towns and 993 villages in 16 of the state's 25 districts were {{affected}} by the post-Godhra violence, which was particularly severe in six districts. The violence raged heavily between 28 February and 3 March 2002, slowed briefly, then restarted on 15 March and continued until mid-June. Northern and central Gujarat and the north-eastern tribal beltwhich are closer to Godhra Citywere the worst affected while Saurashtra and Kutch remained relatively peaceful. 1,000 army troops were flown in by {{the evening of}} 1 March to restore order. Intelligence officials alleged that the state government deliberately delayed the deployment. On 3 May, former Punjab police chief Kanwar Pal Singh Gill was appointed as security adviser to Modi. The Gujarat government transferred several senior police officers, who had taken steps to contain and investigate violent attacks, to <b>administrative</b> <b>positions.</b>|$|E
5|$|In December 1964, Kenya {{was officially}} proclaimed a republic. Kenyatta became its {{executive}} President, a role combining {{the head of}} state and head of government. Over the course of 1965 and 1966, various constitutional amendments were made that enhanced the President's power. For instance, a May 1966 amendment gave the president the ability to order the detention of individuals without trial if the security of the state was regarded as threatened. Kenyatta sought to attain the support of Kenya's second largest tribal group, the Luo, thus appointing the Luo activist Odinga as his Vice President. However, the Kikuyu—who made up around 20 percent of the Kenyan population—still held most of the important government and <b>administrative</b> <b>positions</b> in the country. This contributed to a perception among many in the country that independence had simply seen the dominance of a European elite replaced by the dominance of a Kikuyu elite.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to his duties as a professional herald, Brooke-Little held three <b>administrative</b> <b>positions</b> at the College of Arms. From 1974 until 1982, he served as Registrar, with responsibility to enter all new grants and confirmations of arms into the College records. Brooke-Little's signature {{can be found on}} the reverse of the letters patent for every grant made during this period. In addition, he served as the College's librarian from 1974 until 1994 and the treasurer of the College of Arms from 1978 until 1995. He was also the director of the Heralds' Museum at the Tower of London from 1991 to 1997; this museum is no longer operating. Although Brooke-Little enjoyed prominence as a professional officer of arms and as an author on heraldic subjects, his role in founding the Heraldry Society, and in guiding the society and editing its journal for many years, was perhaps his greatest contribution to the science of heraldry.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s {{a period of}} {{financial}} and leadership disputes occurred within the church hierarchy, with church treasurer, Stanley Rader, {{at the center of}} many of the disputes. The gravest incident was the church bwing placed in financial receivership by the Attorney General of California, George Deukmejian, an action that was later disallowed in court. Tkach took {{an active role in the}} defense of Armstrong, Rader, and the church headquarters' operations. He rallied the WCG membership to take action against the court proceedings. Armstrong recognized his effectiveness and subsequently ordained him to the rank of evangelist on September 27, 1979. See Evangelists of the Worldwide Church of God. In March 1981 Armstrong appointed him to the WCG's advisory council of elders, and eventually, Armstrong named him Director of Church Administration, one of the most prominent <b>administrative</b> <b>positions</b> other than Armstrong himself.|$|E
5|$|Included {{were nine}} Australians—three {{officers}} and six sergeants—who {{had been selected}} by AIF Headquarters in April 1918. All were experienced soldiers, with three having served at Gallipoli {{as well as in}} France. Sailing on the SS City of Marseilles on 17 June 1918 the Australians arrived in Murmansk and most were immediately sent out on patrol. Later they were switched to the Archangel section. The men were then broken into small advisory groups and attached to White Russian and White Finnish units, being engaged in a range of administrative, instructional and advisory tasks. Due to their isolation, it is difficult to make generalisations about the nature of service experienced by the Australians at this time. Captain P.F. Lohan served in a variety of <b>administrative</b> <b>positions</b> both in Murmansk and Archangel, whilst Sergeant R.L. Graham was commissioned in the field and became railway transport officer on the Archangel-Vologda railway. Several other sergeants were involved in the various training roles, while Captain Allan Brown was attached to the North Russian Rifles based at Onega—a White Russian battalion.|$|E
