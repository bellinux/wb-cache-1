5000|$|The {{effect of}} hops on the {{finished}} beer varies by type and use, {{though there are}} two main hop types: bittering and aroma. Bittering hops have higher concentrations of <b>alpha</b> <b>acids,</b> and are responsible for the large majority of the bitter flavor of a beer. European (so-called [...] "noble") hops typically average 5-9% <b>alpha</b> <b>acids</b> by weight (AABW), and the newer American cultivars typically range from 8-19% AABW. Aroma hops usually have a lower concentration of <b>alpha</b> <b>acids</b> (~5%) and are the primary contributors of hop aroma and (nonbitter) flavor. Bittering hops are boiled {{for a longer period of}} time, typically 60-90 minutes, to maximize the isomerization of the <b>alpha</b> <b>acids.</b> They often have inferior aromatic properties, as the aromatic compounds evaporate off during the boil.|$|R
50|$|<b>Alpha</b> <b>acids</b> (α acids) are a {{class of}} {{chemical}} compounds primarily of importance {{to the production of}} beer. They are found in the resin glands of the flowers of the hop plant and are the source of hop bitterness. <b>Alpha</b> <b>acids</b> may be isomerized to form iso-alpha acids by the application of heat in solution. Iso-alpha acids (iso-α-acids) are typically produced in beer from the addition of hops to the boiling wort. The degree of isomerization and the amount of bitter flavor produced by the addition of hops is highly dependent on the length of time the hops are boiled. Longer boil times will result in isomerization of more <b>alpha</b> <b>acids</b> and thus increased bitterness.|$|R

50|$|Since the {{quantities}} of alpha and beta acids range among hops, {{the variety of}} hop should be considered when targeting a specific amount of bitterness in the beer. To maximize bitterness, hops with large <b>alpha</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations should be used. Such varieties include Chinook, Galena, Horizon, Tomahawk, and Warrior hops, and these contain <b>alpha</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations up to 16% by mass. Since the bitterness is not influenced by beta acids, beta acids are not considered when selecting the variety of hop. Also, {{the amount of time}} that the hops are boiled impacts the bitterness of the beer. Since heat is needed to isomerize alpha acids, applying heat for longer amounts of time increases the conversion to the isomerized form.|$|E
50|$|Common <b>alpha</b> <b>acids</b> include humulone, adhumulone, cohumulone, posthumulone, and prehumulone. The {{most common}} iso-alpha acids are cis- and trans-isohumulone.|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the properties of human <b>acid</b> (<b>alpha)</b> -glucosidase with respect to: (i) the molecular heterogeneity of the enzyme and (ii) the synthesis, post-translational modification, and transport of <b>acid</b> (<b>alpha)</b> -glucosidase in human fibroblasts. ^ The initial phase of these investigations involved the purification of <b>acid</b> (<b>alpha)</b> -glucosidase from the human liver. Human hepatic <b>acid</b> (<b>alpha)</b> -glucosidase was characterized by isoelectric focusing and native and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Four distinct charge forms of hepatic <b>acid</b> (<b>alpha)</b> -glucosidase were separated by chromatofocusing and characterized individually. Charge heterogeneity was demonstrated to result from differences in the polypeptide components of each charge form. ^ The second aspect of this research focused on the biosynthesis and the intracellular processing and transport of <b>acid</b> (<b>alpha)</b> -glucosidase in human fibroblasts. These experiments were accomplished by immune precipitation of the biosynthetic intermediates of <b>acid</b> (<b>alpha)</b> -glucosidase from radioactively labeled fibroblasts with polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies raised against human hepatic <b>acid</b> (<b>alpha)</b> -glucosidase. The immune precipitated biosynthetic forms of <b>acid</b> (<b>alpha)</b> -glucosidase were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The pulse-chase experiments demonstrated the existence of several transient, high molecular weight precursors of <b>acid</b> (<b>alpha)</b> -glucosidase. These precursors were demonstrated to be intermediates of <b>acid</b> (<b>alpha)</b> -glucosidase at different stages of transport and processing in the Golgi apparatus. Other experiments were performed to examine the role of co-translational glycosylation of <b>acid</b> (<b>alpha)</b> -glucosidase in the transport and processing of precursors of this enzyme. ^ A specific immunological assay for detecting <b>acid</b> (<b>alpha)</b> -glucosidase was developed using the monoclonal antibodies described above. This method was modified to increase the sensitivity of the assay by utilization of the biotin-avidin amplification system. This method was demonstrated to be more sensitive for detecting human <b>acid</b> (<b>alpha)</b> -glucosidase than the currently used biochemical assay for <b>acid</b> (<b>alpha)</b> -glucosidase activity. It was also demonstrated that the biotin-avidin immunoassay could discriminate between normal and <b>acid</b> (<b>alpha)</b> -glucosidase deficient fibroblasts, thus providing an alternative approach to detecting this inborn error in metabolism.

50|$|Saaz {{has a very}} {{distinctive}} flavour. When used in beer, {{the resultant}} aroma is very mild, earthy, herbal and spicy. Despite its popularity and noble pedigree, Saaz generally has a very low <b>Alpha</b> <b>Acid</b> level and is not very effective as a bittering hop.

50|$|Brewers may use {{software}} tools {{to control the}} bittering levels in the boil and adjust recipes to account {{for a change in}} the hop bill or seasonal variations in the crop that may lead to the need to compensate for a difference in <b>alpha</b> <b>acid</b> contribution.

50|$|Bitterness scales {{attempt to}} rate the {{perceived}} relative bitterness of beer. The bitterness of beer is provided by compounds such as humulones, or alpha acids from hops used during brewing. During the brewing process, humulone undergoes isomerization to form both cis- and trans- isohumulone which {{are responsible for the}} bitter taste of the beer. Likewise, hops contain lupulones, or beta acids. These beta acids are not considered in the initial bittering of the wort as much as their <b>alpha</b> <b>acid</b> counterparts since they do not isomerize through boiling, and therefore do not dissolve in the wort. However, beta acids can undergo oxidation and slowly contribute to the bitterness of the beer. This bitterness is harsher than the bitterness of the alpha acids and this flavor can be undesirable. The oxidation occurs over time through fermentation, storage, and aging. At the same time, isomerized alpha acids undergo degradation and reduce the bitterness of the beer.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Haloperidol is an {{antipsychotic}} drug that exerts its' antipsychotic effects by inhibiting dopaminergic neurons. Although the exact pathophysiology of haloperidol extrapyramidal symptoms are not known, {{the role of}} reactive oxygen species in inducing oxidative stress has been proposed {{as one of the}} mechanisms of prolonged haloperidol-induced neurotoxicity. In the present study, we evaluate the protective effect of <b>alpha</b> lipoic <b>acid</b> against haloperidol-induced oxidative stress in the rat brain. Sprague Dawley rats were divided into control, <b>alpha</b> lipoic <b>acid</b> alone (100 mg/kg p. o for 21 days), haloperidol alone (2 mg/kg i. p for 21 days), and haloperidol with <b>alpha</b> lipoic <b>acid</b> groups (for 21 days). Haloperidol treatment significantly decreased levels of the brain antioxidant enzymes super oxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase and concurrent treatment with <b>alpha</b> lipoic <b>acid</b> significantly reversed the oxidative effects of haloperidol.

40|$|In this thesis, "The Evaluation of the Quality of Hops from Traditional and Non-traditional Growing Areas", {{the quality}} of three {{varieties}} of hop seed cones (Saaz, Sladek and Kazbek) from a non-traditional hop-growing region was analyzed and the data used for comparison. The primary aim {{of the study was}} to determine if there is a possibility of growing quality hops in a region that is not considered a hop-growing region. The hops that were tested were harvested in 2015 from a private hopfield located in Obora near Tábor. This hopfield is owned and managed by Ing. Martin Novák. Mechanical and chemical analysis was carried out on samples from Obora. The main goal of the analysis was to determine the alpha and beta acid content of the hop seed cones harvested there.

Despite its clinical importance, the identity of tumor-borne signals {{and their impact on}} specific peripheral organ systems, particularly the heart, remain mostly unknown. Methods and results: By combining differential colon cancer cell secretome profiling with large-scale cardiomyocyte phenotyping, we identified a signature panel of seven “cachexokines”, including Bridging integrator 1, Syntaxin 7, Multiple inositol-polyphosphate phosphatase 1, Glucosidase <b>alpha</b> <b>acid,</b> Chemokine ligand 2, Adamts like 4, and Ataxin- 10, which were both sufficient and necessary to trigger cardiac atrophy and aberrant fatty acid metabolism in cardiomyocytes. As a prototypical example, engineered secretion of Ataxin- 10 from non-cachexia-inducing cells was sufficient to induce cachexia phenotypes in cardiomyocytes, correlating with elevated Ataxin- 10 serum levels in murine and human cancer cachexia models. Conclusions: As Ataxin- 10 serum levels were also found to be elevated in human cachectic cancer patients, the identification of Ataxin- 10 as part of a cachexokine cocktail now provides a rational approach towards personalized predictive, diagnostic and therapeutic measures in cancer cachexia...|$|E
40|$|The {{administration}} of protein-based pharmaceuticals {{can cause the}} in vivo formation of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) which may reduce {{the efficacy of the}} therapy by binding to the protein drug. An accurate determination of the total and ADA-bound concentrations of the drug gives information on the extent of this immune response and its consequences and may help develop improved therapeutic regimens. We present an absolute quantitative method to differentiate between total, free and ADA-bound drug for recombinant human <b>alpha</b> <b>acid</b> glucosidase (rhGAA) in plasma from patients suffering from Pompe's disease. LC-MS/MS quantification of a signature peptide after trypsin digestion of plasma samples before and after an extraction of the total IgG content of plasma with Protein-G coated beads was used to determine the total and the ADA-bound fractions of rhGAA in samples from Pompe patients after enzyme infusion. The methods for total and ADA-bound rhGAA allow quantitation of the drug in the range of 0. 5 to 500 µg/mL using 20 µL of plasma and met the regular bioanalytical validation requirements, both in the absence and presence of high levels of anti-rhGAA antibodies. This demonstrates that the ADA-bound rhGAA fraction can be accurately and precisely determined and is not influenced by sample dilution, repeated freezing and thawing or extended bench-top or frozen storage. In samples from a patient with a reduced response to therapy due to ADAs high ADA-bound concentrations of rhGAA were found, while in the samples from a patient lacking ADAs, no significant ADA-bound concentrations were found. Since Protein G captures the complete IgG content of plasma, including all anti-drug antibodies, the described extraction approach is universally applicable for the quantification of ADA-bound concentrations of all non-IgG-based biopharmaceuticals...|$|E
