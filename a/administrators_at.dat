500|$|Physical play in hockey, {{consisting}} of allowed {{techniques such as}} checking and prohibited techniques such as elbowing, high-sticking, and cross-checking, is inextricably linked to fighting.

Those who defend fighting in hockey say that it helps deter other types of rough play, allows teams to protect their star players, and creates a sense of solidarity among teammates. The debate over allowing fighting in ice hockey games is ongoing. Despite its potentially negative consequences, such as heavier enforcers (or [...] "heavyweights") knocking each other out, <b>administrators</b> <b>at</b> the professional level are not considering eliminating fighting from the game, as most players consider it essential.
