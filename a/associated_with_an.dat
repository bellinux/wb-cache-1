30|$|After {{the user}} association, <b>a</b> user <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> macro-cell is {{assigned}} non-ABS (i.e., macro-cell user). Further, a user that is <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> small cell and receives the strongest signal from it is assigned non-ABS (i.e., non-victim user). Besides, <b>a</b> user forcibly <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> small cell satisfying (7) is assigned only ABS because it experiences strong cross-tier interference (i.e., victim user).|$|R
50|$|Expressionist Head by pop artist Roy Lichtenstein is {{the name}} <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> several 1980s works of art. It is widely <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> set of six {{identical}} sculptures but is also <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> series of paintings.|$|R
5|$|Severe {{childhood}} {{trauma is}} {{also associated with}} a general increase {{in the risk of}} drug dependency. Lack of peer and family support is <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> increased risk of alcoholism developing. Genetics and adolescence are <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> increased sensitivity to the neurotoxic effects of chronic alcohol abuse. Cortical degeneration due to the neurotoxic effects increases impulsive behaviour, which may contribute to the development, persistence and severity of alcohol use disorders. There is evidence that with abstinence, there is a reversal of {{at least some of the}} alcohol induced central nervous system damage. The use of cannabis was associated with later problems with alcohol use. Alcohol use was <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> increased probability of later use of tobacco, cannabis, and other illegal drugs.|$|E

5|$|Commercial {{sex workers}} (including those in pornography) have an {{increased}} rate of HIV. Rough sex can be a factor <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> increased risk of transmission. Sexual assault is also believed to carry {{an increased risk of}} HIV transmission as condoms are rarely worn, physical trauma to the vagina or rectum is likely, and there may be a greater risk of concurrent sexually transmitted infections.|$|E

50|$|A similar {{association}} {{exists between}} time-global variables and time elements. Therefore, <b>a</b> displacement is <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> time interval (T), whereas a position vector is <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> time instant (I). In this association the measuring process {{must be taken}} into account, because temperature is referred to an instant but its measurement involves a time interval - the one needed to reach thermal equilibrium. Therefore, the temperature is said to be <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> time interval (T). Similarly, the measurement of a force requires a mechanical equilibrium to be reached, hence it is <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> time interval (T).|$|R
50|$|This is {{the only}} breast cancer <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> loss of {{function}} mutation in BRCA1, and thus the only form <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hereditary mutation. It is typically triple-negative and exhibits upregulation of p53.|$|R
5|$|Conditions {{and risk}} factors that {{predispose}} to pneumonia include smoking, immunodeficiency, alcoholism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, chronic kidney disease, and liver disease. The use of acid-suppressing medications—such as proton-pump inhibitors or H2 blockers—is <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{increased risk of}} pneumonia. The risk is also increased in old age.|$|E

5|$|Medroxyprogesterone acetate, a progestin, {{has been}} shown to improve the {{ventilatory}} response, but this has been poorly studied and is <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> increased risk of thrombosis. Similarly, the drug acetazolamide can reduce bicarbonate levels, and thereby augment to normal ventilatory response, but this has been researched insufficiently to recommend wide application.|$|E

5|$|On October 8, a {{circulation}} <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> area of disturbed weather acquired convection and was designated Tropical Depression Nineteen-E. Upon formation, the depression was forecast to dissipate because of strong wind shear. Moving little, its development was constantly hindered by wind shear. The depression had difficulty organizing, and on October 9, it became so disorganized that advisories were discontinued.|$|E
5|$|Protein C {{deficiency}} {{may cause}} purpura fulminans, a severe clotting disorder in the newborn {{that leads to}} both tissue death and bleeding into the skin and other organs. The condition has also been described in adults.

5|$|Studies in {{the early}} 2000s found that other dietary factors are not relevant. Specifically, {{moderate}} consumption of purine-rich vegetables (e.g., beans, peas, lentils and spinach) are not associated with gout. Neither is total consumption of protein. Alcohol consumption is strongly <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> increased risk, with wine presenting somewhat less of a risk than beer and spirits.|$|E

5|$|Users are {{no longer}} able to {{synchronize}} Start menu layouts across all devices associated with a Microsoft account. A Microsoft developer justified the change by explaining that a user may have different applications they want to emphasize on each device that they use, rather than use the same configuration across each device.

5|$|A {{number of}} events {{had taken place in}} and around Jena in the months before the Barker assault, which the media have <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> alleged {{escalation}} of local racial tensions. These events included the hanging of rope nooses from a tree in the high school courtyard, two violent confrontations between white and black youths, and the destruction by fire of the main building of Jena High School. Extensive news coverage related to the Jena Six often reported these events as linked. Federal and parish attorneys concluded from their investigations that assessment was inaccurate for some of the events; for instance, the burning of the high school was an attempt to destroy grade records.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 24–45% {{of people}} with SCI suffer disorders of depression, and the suicide rate is as much as six {{times that of the}} rest of the population. The risk of suicide is worst in the first five years after injury. In young people with SCI, suicide is the leading cause of death. Depression is <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> increased risk of other complications such as UTI and pressure ulcers that occur more when self-care is neglected.|$|E
5|$|As Ironside was a {{marginal}} operation, {{and they were}} worried about exposing agents as false, the Twenty Committee for the most part utilised less important agents and added words of caution to the messages they sent, reducing the impact of the story. Allied landings around Bordeaux may also have seemed implausible because it was beyond air cover from the UK and lacked the normal physical elements (such as naval activities and dummy landing craft) <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> invasion.|$|E
