40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} and feasibility of teleaudiometry {{with that of}} sweep audiometry in elementary school children, using pure-tone audiometry as the gold standard. METHODS: A total of 243 students {{with a mean age}} of 8. 3 years participated in the study. Of these, 118 were boys, and 125 were girls. The following procedures were performed: teleaudiometry screening with software that evaluates hearing at frequencies of 1, 000, 2000 and 4000 Hz at 25 dBHL; sweep audiometry screening in an <b>acoustic</b> <b>booth</b> (20 dBHL at the same frequencies); pure-tone audiometry thresholds in an <b>acoustic</b> <b>booth</b> (frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz); and acoustic immittance measurements. RESULTS: The diagnostic capacities of the teleaudiometry/sweep audiometry screening methods were as follows: sensitivity &# 8202;&# 989;&# 8202; 58 %/ 65 %; specificity &# 8202;&# 989;&# 8202; 86 %/ 99 %; positive predictive value &# 8202;&# 989;&# 8202; 51 %/ 91 %; negative predictive value &# 8202;&# 989;&# 8202; 89 %/ 92 %; and accuracy &# 8202;&# 989;&# 8202; 81 %/ 92 %. Teleaudiometry and sweep audiometry showed moderate agreement. Furthermore, the use of these methods in series with immittance testing improved the specificity, whereas parallel testing improved the sensitivity. CONCLUSION: Teleaudiometry was found to be reliable and feasible for screening hearing in school children. Moreover, teleaudiometry is the preferred method for remote areas where specialized personnel and specific equipment are not available, and its use may reduce the costs of hearing screening programs...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} to {{determine}} a relationship between cerumen accumulation (excessive ear wax) and auditory thresholds amongst students and if there was any effect on learning. The study was also meant to elicit the degree of ear care i. e. auditory hygiene amongst students. A total of twenty volunteer students participated in the study with an age range of 21 - 25 years (mean of 19). Participants were categorized into two based on otologic findings and self-reported evaluation of possible symptoms of cerumen accumulation Audiometric test was conducted on volunteers in a sound-proof <b>acoustic</b> <b>booth</b> using GSI 67 diagnostic audiometer calibrated to American National Standards Institutes (ANSI) for clinical Audiometers. Statistical result using a paired 't' test showed a no significant relationship between the paired groups. Audiological implications of study was discusse...|$|E

50|$|The studio's 2,000 sq ft Big Room houses an SSL XL 9000 K mixing console, with {{additional}} outboard equipment surrounding the room. The Big Room is, unusually for a recording studio, {{designed to be}} one big collaborative recording space, without dividing walls and also houses two isolation booths. Adjoining the Big Room and within the old mill building is the Wood Room. This room features a more lively <b>acoustic</b> and a <b>booth,</b> mezzanine floor and movable acoustic screens. The rooms can be booked together for a larger recording space, or independently for smaller or more budget-friendly projects.|$|R
50|$|In some {{applications}} {{where the}} performance area has high ceilings that reflect {{a large percentage}} of the sound, acrylic sheet is sometimes used to almost completely surround the loud instrument on all sides and above to create what is commonly known as an isolation booth. While this technique will aid in isolating the loud sound source, the interior <b>acoustics</b> of any <b>booth</b> with such {{a large percentage of}} highly reflective surfaces will be difficult or impossible to control. It is therefore recommended that at least 60% or more of the reflective surfaces inside this type of isolation booth be treated with acoustic absorption products. It is also wise to use additional carpet padding and carpet under the entire setup to reduce reflections off the floor and absorb additional sound energy.|$|R

40|$|Background and purpose: There {{are many}} factors {{affecting}} {{the risk of}} hearing loss. Smoking {{is one of these}} factors. Many studies show a link between smoking and hearing loss. However, the increase in hearing theresholds of smokers and non-smokers is less reported. This study was aimed comparing the hearingthres holds at low frequencies among smokers and non-smokers. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study of medicine which was performed in 2012, in the health department of mahshahr city 40 male smokers and 40 non-smoking males with age range between 20 and 40 years were selected and studied by the researcher questionnaire based vestigation. The assessment of hearing loss was performed by using <b>acoustic</b> <b>booth</b> and audiometer with earphone amplivox DA 260 Telephonic TDH- 39 P model. Data analysis were performed by using the software SPSS 16 and P< 0. 05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: The mean age of smokers and nonsmokers, were 4. 44 ± 28. 75 and 5. 72 ± 29. 02 years, respectively. The results showed that the threshold levels among smokers compared to non-smokers were significantly higher. (P< 0. 001). Conclusion: The findings showed that smoking as an effective factor of hearing loss can be discussed. As it was shown that there is a correlation between hearing thresholds at low frequencies among smokers and non-smokers of the subjected population...|$|E

40|$|OBJETIVO: Determinar e comparar os limiares de reconhecimento de sentenças no ruído, em campo livre, na presença de ruído incidente de diferentes ângulos e verificar qual a condição de escuta mais desfavorável, em indivíduos normo-ouvintes. MÉTODOS: Aplicou-se o teste Listas de Sentenças em Português em 38 adultos jovens, avaliados em cabine acústica. As sentenças foram apresentadas a 0 °- 0 º azimute e o ruído competitivo a 0 °- 0 °, 0 º- 90 º, 0 º - 180 ° e 0 º - 270 º azimute, em intensidade fixa de 65 dB NPS (A). RESULTADOS: As relações sinal-ruído nas quais foram obtidos os limiares de reconhecimento de sentenças no ruído para estes ângulos de incidência foram, respectivamente: - 7, 56, - 11, 11, - 9, 75 e - 10, 43 dB. Houve diferença entre os resultados nas condições: 0 º- 0 º e 0 º - 90 º; 0 º - 0 º e 0 º - 180 º; - 0 º - 0 º e 0 º - 270 º. CONCLUSÃO: Os seguintes limiares de reconhecimento de sentenças no ruído, em campo livre, foram obtidos nessas relações sinal/ruído: 0 ° - 0 ° = - 7, 56 dB; - 0 º - 90 º = - 11, 11 dB; - 0 º - 180 ° = - 9, 75 dB; 0 º - 270 º = - 10, 43 dB. Os melhores limiares no ruído foram obtidos com os ângulos de incidência de 0 º - 90 º e 0 º - 270 º, seguidos pela condição de 0 º - 180 º e, por último, 0 º - 0 º. A condição de escuta no ruído mais desfavorável foi aquela na qual o ruído encontra-se no mesmo ângulo de incidência da fala, na posição frontal do indivíduo avaliado. PURPOSE: To {{determine}} {{and compare}} the sentence recognition thresholds in the noise, in sound field, {{in the presence of}} incident noise from different angles, and to verify the most unfavorable hearing condition, in normal-hearing individuals. METHODS: The Portuguese Sentences Lists test was carried out in 38 young adults, evaluated in <b>acoustic</b> <b>booth.</b> The sentences were presented at 0 º - 0 º azimuth, and the competitive noise at 0 º - 0 °, 0 ° - 90 °, 0 ° - 180 °, and 0 ° - 270 ° azimuth, in a fixed loudness of 65 dB NPS (A). RESULTS: The signal-to-noise ratios in which the sentence recognition thresholds were obtained for these incidence angles were, respectively: - 7. 56, - 11. 11, - 9. 45, and - 10. 43 dB. Differences were found between the results in the conditions: 0 º - 0 º and 0 º - 90 º; 0 º - 0 º and 0 º - 180 º; - 0 º - 0 º and 0 º - 270 º. CONCLUSION: The following sentence recognition thresholds in the noise, in sound field, were obtained for these signal-to-noise ratios: 0 ° - 0 ° = - 7. 56 dB; - 0 º - 90 º = - 11. 11 dB; - 0 º - 180 ° = - 9. 75 dB; 0 º - 270 º = - 10. 43 dB. The better thresholds were obtained with the incidence angles of 0 º - 90 º and 0 º - 270 º, followed by the 0 º - 180 º condition, and, finally, by the 0 º - 0 º condition. The most unfavorable hearing condition was that in which the noise was in the same incidence angle of the speech, in front of the evaluated subject...|$|E
