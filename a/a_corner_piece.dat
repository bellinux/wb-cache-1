Sometimes synonymous with story pole. The Old French escantillon, mod. échantillon, is usually taken to be related to Italian scandaglio, sounding-line (Latin scandere, to climb; cf. scansio, the metrical scansion). It was probably influenced by cantel, cantle, a small piece, <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>piece.</b>|$|E

In Lewin’s change model he called the first stage unfreezing involving overcoming inertia and dismantling an existing mind-set. He saw this mind-set as a defense mechanism that needed to be circumvented. Change occurs at the second stage — this is a period wrought with confusion as the individual transitions from a previous mind-set to a new way of looking at and thinking of things. Their frame of reference is being challenged and clarity as to what is replacing it has yet to materialize.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{it is also}} {{possible}} to twist an edge by ~71°, such that the base of two groups of <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>piece</b> and a face center piece each is aligned with the rotational plane of a different edge. The second edge can then be rotated, thus intermixing the corner pieces and the face center pieces and leaving the puzzle in a non-cubical shape. This kind of intermixing is known as a jumbling move. Due to the differing shapes of the intermixed pieces, some rotations possible in the cubical shape may no longer be possible in the jumbled shape. By using a combination of such [...] "jumbling" [...] moves, it is possible to return to cubical shape but with some face center pieces in the wrong orientation, thus jutting outwards like spikes rather than lie flat {{on the face of the}} cube. More subtle changes may also be introduced, which are described later.|$|E

6000|$|I {{was rather}} {{struck by the}} prompt dexterity with which this young man pitched his fur cap at the bell, and rang it himself.

The other bells were inscribed according to {{the names of the}} rooms to which their wires were conducted: as [...] "Picture Room," [...] "Double Room," [...] "Clock Room," [...] and the like. Following Master B.'s bell to its source I found that young gentleman to have had but indifferent third-class accommodation in a triangular cabin under the cock-loft, with <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> fireplace which Master B. must have been exceedingly small if he were ever able to warm himself at, and <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> chimney- <b>piece</b> like <b>a</b> pyramidal staircase to the ceiling for Tom Thumb.

50|$|April 13, 1939, a {{group of}} 45 persons {{representing}} agriculture, livestock breeders, and business, met to discuss the possibility of holding a fair in Yakima. The State Fairgrounds were available as they had had little use since 1936 and this group of people tentatively decided to hold a fair that year. One week later the group met again and voted to hold a fair on September 28, 29, and 30 {{to be held in}} conjunction with the State 4-H Fair which owned <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>piece</b> of property on the State Fairgrounds. This group of people had no funds. They chose the name Central Washington Fair Association. Eight men contributed $5.00 each to pay for the incorporation papers. The fair was organized and incorporated for the purpose of promoting livestock and agricultural industry in Washington. It was agreed that seven persons should be elected {{to the board of directors}} to operate the fair and that stock should be sold at $5.00 per share to raise funds. Regardless of how many shares any corporation or individual bought, no one person or group of persons would be allowed more than one vote at the annual stockholders' meeting nor could they be assessed or receive dividends from their stock.|$|E
5000|$|In Rin-chen Lha-mo's work We Tibetans (1926), {{she states}} that [...] "The longer the {{sequence}} you can capture [...] [...] [...] the better and the sequence is not broken by going around a corner, thus:". [...] This {{has been interpreted}} to mean {{that it may be}} possible to capture <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>piece,</b> or a line(s) of pieces that occupy a portion of two adjacent sides of the board (hence at most one corner piece) by flanking them on two opposite ends provided there is no vacant space between any of the pieces, and Rin-cen Lha-mo actually provides an illustration showing just that. This rule is useful because it's generally difficult to perform these types of captures using the regular custodian method. However, some critics have debated whether this rule can be applied to any position on the board, or just with corner pieces. Rin-chen Lha-mo does however specifically state [...] "...going around a corner...", and provides an illustrative example of pieces strictly going around a corner of the board. Lastly, Rin-chen Lha-mo does not specify whether or not the two pieces used to flank the captured pieces must occupy the same two adjacent sides that the captured pieces are occupying, although based upon the illustrative example she gave, she may have been attempting to suggest that. For example, in the beginning of the game, can one player attempt to capture the other player's 14 pieces as it is initially laid out using this modified custodian method? She also does not specify if (any of) the two pieces can be corner pieces (but opposite one another on the board if both are corner pieces) since these two corner pieces would not only occupy the same adjacent sides of the captured pieces, but also the remaining two other sides.|$|E
5000|$|The {{remains of}} the folding chair consist of four bronze knobs with diameters of 36 to(-) 40 mm with 15 mm long spouts and a total length of 23 mm. The end caps are ribbed and their faces {{decorated}} with a pattern of four concentric circles. A cast loop with a diameter of 29 mm supports a ring of 28 mm diameter with four rattle 73 mm long plates. These components were attached to {{the frame of the}} seat. Two small knobs with diameters 27 to(-) 29 mm and lengths of 18 mm were found among the baseboards of the stool. Most likely the stool had originally four of these knobs, the other two being presumed lost. There were also four bronze studs with gold plated heads. The nail heads are 18 mm in diameter and have a pin length of 27 mm. Three figure-eight shaped bronze fittings of 41 mm length, 15 mm width and thicknesses of 2 mm with line ornaments wearing a gold metal insert at the waist. The gold plate was fixed by two fine incisions in the bronze fitting and then folded on the reverse. Two rectangular bronze plates of 38 mm in length, 7 mm in width and about 1.8 mm thickness are entirely covered with gold foil and bent around the edges for fixation. Furthermore, there are five rectangular fitting plates whose broken edges were put together. It is most likely that some of their fragments are still missing. Only a few organic components were preserved, one is a piece of leather, and there were seven or eight pieces of wood, one of ash, the other of maple. Among the pieces of wood, there is <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>piece</b> and one with the mounting of the seat's leather.

5000|$|A Malaysian variant called Apit-sodok {{is closely}} related. [...] The game is {{documented}} in R.J. Wilkinson's work Papers on Malay Subjects (1910), and Raja Samusah's article The Malay Game of Apit (1932), and both {{refer to the}} game as Apit. Samusah also refers to the game as Sodok Apit. Both authors describe custodian and intervention capture, but only Samusah describes orthogonal movement of pieces as in the rook in chess. Samusah specifically describes that a line of enemy pieces can be captured through custodian whereas in Mak-yek only a single enemy piece may be captured. But Captain James Low's description of Maak yék does include custodian capture for a line of enemy pieces. Samusah describes that <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>piece</b> cannot be captured by surrounding it on its two orthogonally adjacent squares and the diagonally adjacent square. He also describes that a piece can move safely next to a friendly piece(s) (on a row or column) despite being flanked as a linear group on two opposite ends by opposing pieces provided there are no spaces between any of them (friendly and opposing pieces). Both Wilkinson and Samusah agree that {{the game is played}} on a draughts board, and Samusah specifically illustrates an 8 x 8 uncheckered board similar to most versions of Mak-yek. Samusah describes that [...] "There are 16 pieces, all of equal value; and these are arranged in two rows as in chess", but does not specifically reference the chess variant. Malaysia's chess variant is called Main Chator, and the pieces are set up on the first two rows nearest each player similar to Western chess. [...] This is a contrast as to how Mak-yek's pieces are initially set up which are on the first and third row nearest each player. As an English translation from the Malay language, apit means squeezed, and this is associated with custodian capture. [...] Sodok means a shovel or spade or a duck's bill, or the process of shoveling up, and this is associated with intervention capture.|$|E
