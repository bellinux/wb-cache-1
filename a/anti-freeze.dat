40|$|In {{cold winter}} weather, the {{air-cooled}} condensers (ACCs) face serious freezing risks, especially with part load {{of the power}} generating unit. Therefore, it is of benefit to investigate the heat transfer process between the turbine exhaust steam and cooling air, by which the freezing mechanism of the finned tube bundles can be revealed. In this work, the flow and heat transfer models of the cooling air coupling with the circulating water, are developed and numerically simulated for the <b>anti-freezing</b> analysis on basis of the finned tube bundles of the condenser cell. The local air-side heat transfer coefficient, condensate film development, and non-condensable gas development are obtained and analyzed in detail. The results show that, the most freezing risk happens at the fin base due to the highest air-side cooling capacity, besides the windward velocity, ambient temperature and turbine back pressure all determine the freezing risk with the constant inlet flow rate of the non-condensable gas. Furthermore, increasing fin thickness and decreasing fan rotating speed are the most effective <b>anti-freezing</b> measures. Additionally, increasing turbine back pressure can also be adopted to avoid ACC freezing, however the adjustment of outlet steam-air flow is not recommended...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of these effect factors on durability of high performance concrete containing nano-particles and find out the main factors. Applying grey relational analysis method, the relational grades between the effect factors and diffusion coefficient of Cl -, and the relational grades between the effect factors and <b>anti-freezing</b> durability coefficient of high performance concrete containing nano-particles were calculated. Besides, the sequence results of influencing degree of the factors to affect the anti-permeability and freezing-thawing resistance were obtained. The results indicate that water-binder ratio, dosage of cement and dosage of nano- particles have the greatest influence on chloride permeability and freeze-thaw resistance of high performance concrete containing nano- particles among the 7 selected parameters of design of mix proportion. In order to improve anti-permeability of Cl - and freeze-thaw resistance of high performance concrete containing nano-particles, water-binder ratio, the dosage of cement and nano-materials must be controlled strictly. It had better decrease water-binder ratio and the dosage of cement, besides increase the dosage of nano-materials. </p...|$|R
40|$|This study {{proposes to}} {{determine}} the thermal conductivity of SK One Component Polyurethane (SKOCP) developed by China Institute of Water Resources & Hydropower Research Beijing IWHR-KHL Co. Ltd. SKOCP provides excellent proof of aging and chemical resistance of this material. It is non-toxic, acts as a good anti-seepage, offers anti-abrasion and good <b>anti-freezing</b> performance. In addition, it has high strength, high elongation and good bonding with base materials (i. e. concrete, metal surfaces, etc.). With all these robust properties, the one component polyurethane seems the most favourable material for construction in cold regions as it acts as <b>anti-freezing</b> and protects against freeze-thaw fractures. The research aims to study SKOCP in depth and to determine its thermal conductivity using experimentations and multiphysics based numerical simulations.
