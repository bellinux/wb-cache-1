In the case, the Minister of State for Administrative Services, acting on behalf of the Minister of State for Industry and Commerce, imposed <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duties</b> on the applicant. The applicant brought legal proceedings claiming that the authorities had denied it natural justice by failing to comply with a promise to provide an opportunity for a hearing towards the close of the investigation on whether the duties should be levied, and by departing from certain procedures. Applying Ng Yuen Shiu and the GCHQ case, the Court agreed that the applicant's legitimate expectation had been frustrated by the failure to conduct a hearing, and that it had been unfair for the authorities not to follow the procedures.|$|E

40|$|On the 26 th of November 2013 the European Commission {{concluded}} that solar glass origi- nating from the People’s Republic of China had been {{dumped into the}} European market. The Commission imposed a provisional <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duty</b> on subsequent imports. This thesis eval- uates the expected and actual welfare implications for consumers in the German market after the <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duty</b> was introduced. As Europe’s largest solar energy producer, German data on solar energy production, sampled between 2011 and 2014, as well as price levels and installation rates for solar energy provides a robust framework of analysis. By way of a mul- tiple regression analysis, {{it is found that}} the introduction of the Commission’s <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duty</b> had a statistically insignificant effect on the production of solar electricity in the German market. Through the continued growth in solar energy production, it is found that German consumers are inelastic to changes in the price of solar energy. Prior literature underlines the prevalence of consumption preferences for consumers who exhibit the ’warm-glow’ effect and derive utility out of altruism towards the environment. The heightened consumption of solar energy in spite of rising prices underlines this effect. These conclusions enable further consider- ation for the duty’s implications for market welfare in the country, and also its implications for the wider European community. It is concluded, in contrast with classical theory on industrial organisation, that European consumers were made no worse off {{as a result of the}} <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duty,</b> and that producers benefited...|$|R

40|$|We examine {{an export}} game where two firms (home and foreign), located in two {{different}} countries, produce vertically differentiated products.

This equilibrium is characterized by unilateral dumping by the foreign firm into the domestic economy.

40|$|China {{increasingly}} {{integrates into}} the international system, but has the social capitalist China been effectively contained by the Western-led liberal order? Most current literatures assume China’s ratification of international treaties as the signal to its full adoption of international norms, and scholars such as John Ikenberry thus argue that China is getting contained by the Western liberal order. However, {{a new wave of}} norm diffusion scholars suggests that even the ratified norms may not have the expected domestic impacts; the implementation process is decisive to the real changes ‘on the ground’. Following this vein, this thesis studies China’s implementation of international liberal norms in order to understand how the liberal world contains China in its order. This thesis compares the implementation of two WTO trading norms namely <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duty</b> and countervailing duty in China as the representative case studies. The analysis suggests that these two norms have made important changes to China’s legal system, institution-building, field-level practices and its domestic discourse. By employing political comparative methods, it proves the WTO implementing instruments as effective in promoting the progresses of this implementation process. However, the analysis further suggests that the cultural match of these two international liberal norms with China’s social capitalist traditions also contributes to strong domestic resistances to the implementation process. The consequences of this dis-match are largely reflected in China’s field-level practices of and its domestic discourses over these two norms. This thesis provides a complex answer to the question raised at the beginning. As the case studies illustrate, although <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>duty</b> and countervailing duty conflict with China’s social capitalist traditions, China chooses {{to play by the rules}} because of its ‘problem-solving’ concerns and because of the pressure from the WTO and its members. China, both the state sectors and non-state actors, values its identity as a member of the international society, and is willing to act as the defender of the current international order. Even though, China is not a passive receiver of the liberal normative structure. The dis-match between the liberal norms and China’s social capitalist tradition inevitably results in the internal resistance to the tendency of China being fully contained by the international liberal order. This resistance will not be eliminated by any external pressure...|$|R
