The strong evolutionary pressure for these small non-catalytic protein domains suggested their importance. Findings beginning in 1999 and later revealed a previously unrecognized layer of biology: these proteins control gene expression within the cell of origin, and when released exert homeostatic and developmental control in specific human cell types, {{tissues and organs}} during adult or fetal development or both, including pathways associated with angiogenesis, inflammation, the immune response, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling, apoptosis, tumorigenesis, and interferon gamma (IFN-) and p53 signalling.|$|E

2500|$|During {{his time}} in Paris, Guillén had come under the {{influence}} of Paul Valéry. [...] Valéry was closely associated with the ideal of pure poetry and Guillén later recalled him saying that “Pure poetry is what is left after the elimination of everything that is not poetry.” [...] He was also inspired by Valéry’s belief that a poet should only write one book – Un, qui est le bon et le seul de son être - a remark that makes sense of Guillén’s career, both of the <b>accretive</b> process that led ultimately to the finished Cántico, and also of the impulse that led him to combine all his published poetry into one collection Aire nuestro in 1968. [...] He also translated four of Valéry’s poems, including the celebrated [...] "Le Cimetière marin," [...] into Spanish. [...] However, in Language and Poetry, he also recorded a debt to the poetic rigour of Góngora, showing that he could trace this concern for stylistic purity back much further than Valéry.|$|E
