25|$|On August 5, 2015, Adams {{announced}} via Instagram that he {{was going}} to cover and release his version of Taylor Swift's 2014 album 1989. He released multiple clips via Twitter and Instagram showcasing his takes on Swift's songs. Adams' 1989 was released on September 21, 2015. It debuted at No. 7 on the US Billboard 200 chart, one position ahead of Swift's 1989, which was in its 48th week on the chart. <b>Adams</b> <b>said</b> in October 2016 that he would never cover another full album again after receiving 1000 jabs following the recording of 1989.|$|E
25|$|The next morning, at 8.30, Adams {{called the}} coroner {{to make an}} {{appointment}} for a private post-mortem. The coroner asked when the patient had died and <b>Adams</b> <b>said</b> she had not yet. Harris visited again that day and Adams still made no mention of potential barbiturate poisoning. When Harris had left, Adams gave a single injection of 10cc of the Megimide. Hullett developed broncho-pneumonia and on the 23rd at 6.00 a.m. Adams gave Hullett oxygen. She died at 7.23 a.m. on 23 July. The results of a urine sample taken on 21 July were received after Hullett's death, on the 24th. It showed she had 115grains of sodium barbitone in her body – twice the fatal dose.|$|E

25|$|The {{series was}} also notable {{for its use}} of sound, being the first comedy series to be {{produced}} in stereo. <b>Adams</b> <b>said</b> that he wanted the programme's production to be {{comparable to that of}} a modern rock album. Much of the programme's budget was spent on sound effects, which were largely the work of Paddy Kingsland (for the pilot episode and the complete second series) at the BBC Radiophonic Workshop and Dick Mills and Harry Parker (for the remaining episodes (2–6) of the first series). The fact that they were at the forefront of modern radio production in 1978 and 1980 was reflected when the three new series of Hitchhiker's became some of the first radio shows to be mixed into four-channel Dolby Surround. This mix was also featured on DVD releases of the third radio series.|$|E

500|$|On the game's community, <b>Adams</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "They are {{the reason}} I've {{been able to make}} the step from {{hobbyist}} to full-time developer. I'm lucky to be able to run with whatever ideas we have and try new things." [...] On players sending him forum posts or emails detailing their stories or events that happened during the game, <b>Adams</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "It's really gratifying, because it's {{one of the things we}} set out to do is to get people to write these narratives about their game." [...] Adams has admitted that some feats of the community surprised even him. Adams stated that the most impressive thing he had ever seen done with the game was when a player managed to create a Turing-complete 8-bit computer powered by dwarves.|$|E
500|$|The theme tune {{used for}} the radio series (and all {{subsequent}} adaptations) is [...] "Journey of the Sorcerer", an instrumental piece composed by Bernie Leadon and recorded by The Eagles on their album One of These Nights. Adams chose this song for its futuristic-sounding nature, {{but also for the}} fact that it had a banjo in it, which, as Geoffrey Perkins recalls, <b>Adams</b> <b>said</b> would give it an [...] "on the road, hitch-hiking feel".|$|E
500|$|Twelve {{months after}} he joined Port Vale as player-assistant manager in July 2009, Horsfield was offered a {{contract}} at the club as full-time assistant manager. <b>Adams</b> <b>said</b> that Horsfield would have a heavier workload over the 2010–11 season, which would include many hours of scouting in order to [...] "formulate a catalogue of players [...] get to know all the leagues at all levels", and he would retain his playing registration for emergencies.|$|E

500|$|In a {{keynote speech}} at the party's Ard Fheis on 10 September Gerry <b>Adams</b> <b>said</b> that he felt that Sinn Féin should support the {{nomination}} of [...] "a candidate who is capable of winning the support of progressive and nationalist opinion... who will reflect the broad republican spirit of the Irish people at this time". He went on to state that the party's Ard Comhairle would consider the matter on 17 September.|$|E
500|$|Adams finger billiards and {{exhibition}} work had its germination {{in his early}} bowling interest. By {{the time he was}} 17, Adams was an adept bowler; he often gave informal exhibitions of bowling tricks such as [...] "cocked hat", [...] "back frame", and letting the head pin remain standing. In a 1913 interview, <b>Adams</b> <b>said</b> that, [...] "n those days we rolled what was termed 'skew ball', similar to the [...] put on a cue ball in Billiards." ...|$|E
500|$|As with Junebug and Enchanted, Adams' {{roles in}} her three 2008 {{releases}} {{were those of}} the ingénueinnocent women with a cheerful personality. When asked about her being typecast in such roles, <b>Adams</b> <b>said</b> that she responds to characters who are joyful and identified with their sense of hope. She believed that despite certain similarities in their disposition, these characters were vastly different from one another; she said, [...] "Naïveté is not stupidity, and innocent people are often very complex." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Not if {{you love}} me, Dinah--not {{if you love}} me," [...] <b>Adam</b> <b>said</b> passionately. [...] "Tell me--tell {{me if you can}} love me better than a brother?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Go, Gyp; go, lad!" [...] <b>Adam</b> <b>said,</b> {{in a tone}} of {{encouraging}} command; and Gyp, apparently satisfied that duty and pleasure were one, followed Lisbeth into the house-place.|$|R
500|$|On his {{reliance}} on PayPal donations, Adams {{says he is}} content since he feels that people really like his work or they would not pay. <b>Adams</b> <b>said</b> that donations remain stable except during a new version update, {{where there is a}} sudden increase. Their expenses being low, he has maintained that he is happy as long as the game is self-sustaining and will not charge for it. In 2011, Adams refused a job offer from an unspecified major game developer and a $300,000 deal to license the name Dwarf Fortress from another company. Adams felt that this amount would not equate to long-term donations and that he prefers working on his own—not being part of the gaming industry. <b>Adams</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Barely in the black one month, a little in the red another month. ... It's a risk I'm willing to take, and really I couldn't have it any other way." [...] He has spent no money on advertising and was happy when bloggers, reviewers like former game journalist Kieron Gillen from PC Gamer and Games for Windows, wrote about his game. In 2015, Bay 12 Games set up a Patreon account to help fund it.|$|E
500|$|Douglas Adams {{had contributed}} comedy {{sketches}} for BBC radio programmes produced by Simon Brett (including The Burkiss Way and Week Ending), and {{was asked to}} pitch a radio sitcom in February 1977. Adams initially pitched a [...] "bedsit comedy" [...] because that [...] "seemed to be what most situation comedies tended to be about." [...] <b>Adams</b> <b>said</b> {{in an interview that}} when Brett proposed a radio science fiction comedy series, he [...] "fell off his chair...because it was what I'd been fighting for all these years". Adams wrote his first outlines in February 1977.|$|E
500|$|Adams hadn't worked {{together}} on an album with Vallance since the late-1980s. They teamed up after, as <b>Adams</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "throwing ideas back and forth" [...] from 2003 until the album was released. Vallance would send MP3 audio files by e-mail to Adams during the recording seasons. Adams would then add some elements to them and send them back. They continued doing this until a song was completed; Vallance claimed it took longer for them to write songs than during their previous collaborations, but felt the end product was just as good.|$|E

500|$|During the game, Bob Sudyk, a {{reporter}} for the Cleveland Press, interviewed Adams and asked {{if he was going to}} drum again at the following game. <b>Adams</b> <b>said</b> no, but Sudyk wrote in his article that he would. According to Adams, [...] "not to make a liar out of Bob, I showed up with my drum, and then I came to the next game and the next game and the next game." [...] The Indians' promotions director at the time, Jackie York, also approached Adams and asked him to play at every game. Adams formally declined but continued to attend games with his drum.|$|E
500|$|Erik Adams of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B–". He {{noted that it}} [...] "represents a tipping point for The Office" [...] because it {{eliminates}} the fact that—while the characters have known they were on camera—many {{of the people that}} the documentary is following have not realized {{the extent to which the}} camera people have been following and recording them." [...] <b>Adams</b> <b>said</b> that strong plots such as Pam's realization about her relationship with Jim were rushed, and that other plots, like Dwight's, were made to [...] " [...] out the clock". M. Giant of Television Without Pity awarded the episode a [...] "B–".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} on Canada AM, <b>Adams</b> <b>said</b> the title 11 was picked because it was his 11th studio album, when soundtrack album [...] is included. In addition, Adams mentioned there was no hidden meaning behind the title, it was his eleventh studio release and contained eleven tracks, [...] "there are no secondary meanings" [...] as Adams later mentioned in {{an interview}} with the BBC. The album's cover was taken during a photo shoot in a hotel in Switzerland, while Adams was doing a self-photo story for an Italian men's magazine. Adams ended up liking the photo so much that he ended up using it as the album's cover ...|$|E
