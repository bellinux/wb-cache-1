This phase information is then used to filter the vibration information to determine the amount of movement, or force, in one rotation of the part. Also, the time difference between the phase and the vibration peak gives the angle at which the unbalance exists.

50|$|Dynamic balance {{describes}} the forces generated by asymmetric mass distribution when the tire is rotated, usually {{at a high}} speed. In the tire factory, the tire and wheel are mounted on a balancing machine test wheel, the assembly is accelerated up to a speed of 100 RPM (10 to 15 mph with recent high sensitivity sensors) or higher, 300 RPM (55 to 60 mph with typical low sensitivity sensors), and forces of unbalance are measured by sensors as the tire rotates. These forces are resolved into static and couple values for {{the inner and outer}} planes of the wheel, and compared to the unbalance tolerance (the maximum allowable manufacturing limits). If the tire is not checked, {{it has the potential to}} wobble and perform poorly. In tire retail shops, tire/wheel assemblies are checked on a spin-balancer, which determines the amount and <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>unbalance.</b> Balance weights are then fitted to the outer and inner flanges of the wheel. Dynamic balance is better (it is more comprehensive) than static balance alone, because both couple and static forces are measured and corrected.|$|E

40|$|Phase-locked loops (PLLs) are {{necessary}} in applications which require grid synchronization. Presence <b>of</b> <b>unbalance</b> or harmonics in the grid voltage creates {{errors in the}} estimated frequency and <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> a PLL. The error in estimated angle {{has the effect of}} distorting the unit vectors generated by the PLL. In this paper, analytical expressions are derived which determine the error in the phase angle estimated by a PLL when there is unbalance and harmonics in the grid voltage. By using the derived expressions, the total harmonic distortion (THD) and the fundamental phase error of the unit vectors can be determined for a given PLL topology and a given level <b>of</b> <b>unbalance</b> and distortion in the grid voltage. The accuracy of the results obtained from the analytical expressions is validated with the simulation and experimental results for synchronous reference frame PLL (SRF-PLL). Based on these expressions, a new tuning method for the SRF-PLL is proposed which quantifies the tradeoff between the unit vector THD and the bandwidth of the SRF-PLL.
