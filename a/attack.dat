40|$|In the {{multimedia}} applications over the mobile ad hoc networks, the goodput and delay performance of UDP packets is {{very sensitive to}} the congestion targeted DDoS <b>attacking.</b> In this paper, we analyze this type of <b>attacking</b> in details {{for the first time}} to our knowledge. We figure out the principles of the <b>attacking</b> from the analysis of network capacity and classify the <b>attacking</b> into four categories: Pulsing <b>attacking,</b> Round Robin <b>attacking,</b> Self-whisper <b>attacking</b> and Flooding <b>attacking.</b> The defense schemes are also proposed, which includes the detection of RTS/CTS packets, signal interference frequency and retransmission time and response stage with ECN marking mechanism. Through the ns 2 simulation, the basic <b>attacking</b> scenario is discussed and the results show that the <b>attacking</b> leads to the great jitter of the goodput and delay in pulsing <b>attacking</b> mode. The delay increasing (up to 110 times in five <b>attacking</b> flows) and goodput decreasing (to 77. 42 % in 5 <b>attacking</b> flows) is obvious with the addition of <b>attacking</b> flows. © 2005 IEEE...|$|R

5|$|As the {{bombardment}} {{of the city}} proved to be unsuccessful, Montgomery then began to plan for an assault. Montgomery was to assault the Lower Town district, {{the part of the}} city near the river shore, while Arnold was to <b>attack</b> and take the Cape Diamond Bastion, a strong part of the city walls on the highest point of the rocky promontory. Montgomery believed that they should <b>attack</b> during a stormy night, therefore the British {{would not be able to}} see them. On December 27, the weather became stormy, and Montgomery ordered that the men prepare to <b>attack.</b> However, the storm soon subsided and Montgomery called off the <b>attack.</b> As Montgomery waited for a storm, he was forced to revise his plans, because a deserter communicated the original plan to the defenders. In the new plan, Montgomery would <b>attack</b> the Lower Town from the south and Arnold would <b>attack</b> the Lower Town from the north. After breaking through the walls, Montgomery and Arnold would meet up in the city and then <b>attack</b> and take the Upper Town, causing resistance to collapse. To increase their chance of surprise, Montgomery planned two feints. One detachment of troops (the 1st Canadian Regiment under James Livingston) would set fire to one of the gates while another (under the command of Jacob Brown) would engage the guard at Cape Diamond Bastion and fire rockets to signal the start of the <b>attack.</b> While the feints were conducted, artillery would fire into the city. Although Montgomery was reluctant to <b>attack,</b> enlistments for Arnold's men were expiring on January 1, and he was concerned about losing their services.|$|E
5|$|At 07:53, {{minutes before}} the Israeli <b>attack</b> was to commence, Israeli forces near El-Qantarah became heavily engaged with a brigade {{composing}} the 18th Division's right flank, as Egyptian troops sought to secure the town and its vicinity. Fuad, the division commander supported the brigade with two companies of T-62 tanks. To prevent Israeli forces in the area from being outflanked, Gonen ordered Nir to remain near El-Qantarah to help contain the Egyptian <b>attack.</b> This left Adan with only 50 tanks under Amir's command {{to carry out the}} <b>attack.</b>|$|E

5|$|At 22:00, {{troops of}} the Chinese 39th Army began a frontal assault on Hill 205, {{signaled}} by drums and whistles. An estimated platoon-sized force of Chinese made the first <b>attack.</b> The Rangers fought back with heavy small arms fire and several pre-sighted artillery concentrations, repulsing this first <b>attack</b> at 22:50. A number of Rangers were wounded in this <b>attack,</b> including Puckett, who refused evacuation. At 23:00 the Chinese launched a second <b>attack</b> which was quickly repelled, as was a third <b>attack</b> several minutes later. Both of these attacks were an estimated company in strength. The Rangers inflicted heavy casualties each time {{as a result of}} a well-established defensive perimeter, though the platoon of tanks at the foot of the hill opposite the Chinese <b>attack</b> were unable to assist the Rangers, as the crews had no experience in night operations. By 23:50 the Chinese began attacking in greater numbers, with an estimated two companies advancing at a time, moving to within hand grenade range. The Rangers began to run low on ammunition while their casualties continued to mount, and Puckett was wounded again. Over the course of several hours the Chinese launched a fourth and a fifth <b>attack,</b> each of which was narrowly pushed back by the Rangers. The Rangers were then ordered to fix bayonets in preparation for the next <b>attack.</b>|$|E

5|$|At {{this stage}} of the war, the 2nd New Zealand Division was {{fighting}} in Italy as part of the British Eighth Army with the 5th Brigade poised to <b>attack</b> across the Sangro River in central Italy.

The reorganised <b>attack</b> was successfully executed on the evening of 28 November with light casualties. The 2nd Division then attempted three times to capture the town of Orsogna. The second <b>attack</b> on the town of 7 December was the first to involve the 5th Brigade. Despite Kippenberger's brigade achieving all its objectives on the flank of the town, the <b>attack</b> was not successful. The failure of another brigade, tasked with capture of Orsogna itself, to achieve its goals left elements of the 5th Brigade exposed, and it had to partially withdraw.|$|E

5|$|Between 1 October and 17 October, the Japanese {{delivered}} 15,000 {{troops to}} Guadalcanal, giving Hyakutake 20,000 total troops to employ for his planned offensive. Because {{of the loss}} of their positions {{on the east side of}} the Matanikau, the Japanese decided that an <b>attack</b> on the U.S. defenses along the coast would be prohibitively difficult. Therefore, Hyakutake decided that the main thrust of his planned <b>attack</b> would be from south of Henderson Field. His 2nd Division (augmented by troops from the 38th Infantry Division), under Lieutenant General Masao Maruyama and comprising 7,000 soldiers in three infantry regiments of three battalions each was ordered to march through the jungle and <b>attack</b> the American defences from the south near the east bank of the Lunga River. To distract the Americans from the planned <b>attack</b> from the south, Hyakutake's heavy artillery plus five battalions of infantry (about 2,900 men) from the 4th and 124th Infantry Regiments under the overall command of Major General Tadashi Sumiyoshi were to <b>attack</b> the American defenses from the west along the coastal corridor.|$|E
5|$|Byron's <b>attack</b> on Skippon's musketeers in {{the centre}} also went poorly. Pushing three regiments of foot forward, the force {{suffered}} similarly high casualties {{in an attempt}} to take Round Hill; after the <b>attack</b> stalled, the cavalry had to be called in to force it forward. Despite heavy losses due to the only avenue of advance being a narrow lane lined with Parliamentarian musketeers, this move succeeded in allowing Byron to take Round Hill, forcing the Parliamentarian infantry back to a hedge on the far side. The <b>attack</b> eventually lost momentum, and although Round Hill was taken, Byron was unable to advance any further. On the right flank, William Vavasour attempted to overwhelm the Parliamentary flank with a substantial brigade of foot, which included a small amount of cavalry support. His initial <b>attack</b> was repulsed thanks to the Parliamentarian artillery opening fire, but a subsequent head-on <b>attack</b> forced Skippon's beleaguered force in the centre to send several regiments over to assist, with the fight turning into a bloody melee. Vavasour's force was eventually forced to retire, with the Parliamentarians failing to give ground.|$|E
30|$|We propose an {{extended}} secure localization scheme, called mobility-aided TSCD (M-TSCD), which allows a sensor to utilize its historical data {{to detect the}} current <b>attacked</b> locators. For the sensor, if it detects some <b>attacked</b> locators based on the temporal and spatial properties, it knows that it is currently in an <b>attacked</b> state. Then, it checks its historical data and treats all those detected <b>attacked</b> locators in the previous state as the <b>attacked</b> locators in the current state. It also records the current detected <b>attacked</b> locators as the historical data for the next state. Otherwise, if it detects no <b>attacked</b> locator, it empties the historical data. Since the <b>attacked</b> locators recorded in the historical data for the previous state are also considered <b>attacked</b> on the current state, it increases {{the probability that a}} sensor detects at least two <b>attacked</b> locators. If the detected <b>attacked</b> locators are more than two, the sensor can use the detection scheme D 4 to detect other <b>attacked</b> locators; otherwise, it uses the detection scheme D 3 to detect other <b>attacked</b> locators. Finally, it conducts the MLE localization based on the remaining locators. The procedure of M-TSCD is shown in Algorithm 3.|$|R
40|$|Side-channel <b>attacks</b> {{have become}} an {{interesting}} topic of cryptographic research. Besides the well known Differential Power Analysis (DPA) <b>attacks,</b> other approaches have been introduced, for example template <b>attacks</b> and algebraic side-channel <b>attacks.</b> All of these <b>attacks</b> exploit side-channel information in different ways. To protect implementations against these kind of analyses, numerous countermeasures have been proposed which however can be <b>attacked</b> again. Not all <b>attacks</b> are feasible in the real-world because many of them require substantial computational power and hardware costs. In this thesis, two types of side-channel <b>attacks</b> are considered, namely algebraic side-channel <b>attacks</b> and second order DPA <b>attacks.</b> First, a detailed introduction to the theoretical background of the different <b>attacks</b> is given. Cipher-specific details are ex-plained by the example of AES since {{it is one of}} the most used block cipher. The implementation of the different <b>attacks</b> is described based on source code snippets. Ad-ditionally, two AES implementations are protected with a boolean masking scheme in the first case and a combination of the masking scheme and shuffling in the second case...|$|R
40|$|Wireless {{networks}} {{are more vulnerable}} to interference <b>attacks</b> as theyare open in nature. These <b>attacks</b> are also known as Denial-of-Service <b>attacks</b> that cause some sort of jamming in the network. Jamming problem has been around in wireless networks. Many existing solutions to prevent jamming <b>attacks</b> employed external threat model. However,there is possibility of internal <b>attacks.</b> Adversaries with good knowledge of network details including protocol specifications and other secret can make jamming <b>attacks</b> that {{are not easy to}} handle. Such <b>attacks</b> are named as selective jamming <b>attacks</b> as they are active for very short span of time that focus on messages with highestsignificance. Recently Proano and Lazos proposed an internal threat model to handle selective jamming <b>attacks.</b> They also provided three schemes for preventing selective jamming <b>attacks.</b> In this built a prototype application in Java platform to implement the schemes for preventing selective jamming <b>attacks.</b> Experimental results revealed that the prototype can be used in real world wireless network...|$|R
5|$|Catalytic triads perform {{covalent}} catalysis via an acyl-enzyme intermediate. If this intermediate {{is resolved}} by water, {{the result is}} hydrolysis of the substrate. However, if the intermediate is resolved by <b>attack</b> by a second substrate, then the enzyme acts as a transferase. For example, <b>attack</b> by an acyl group results in an acyltransferase reaction. Several families of transferase enzymes have evolved from hydrolases by adaptation to exclude water and favour <b>attack</b> of a second substrate.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, we {{presented}} a classification of malware <b>attacks</b> in IaaS cloud environments. We defined the cloud {{scenario in which}} external entities, the VMs and the cloud provider can be both source and target of <b>attacks.</b> Our approach takes into consideration the origin and target of <b>attacks</b> to distinguish three different classes: <b>attacks</b> that take place outside a VM, <b>attacks</b> targeting VMs and <b>attacks</b> originating from VMs. A common characteristic of <b>attacks</b> {{in the second and}} third class is that they can be addressed using adequately deployed VMI-based techniques. Therefore, we added a focus on <b>attacks</b> that directly involve VMs as both source and target of <b>attacks.</b> Our classification supports practitioners at early stage of the design of VMI-based mitigation mechanisms by identifying relevant <b>attacks</b> which threaten their VM or by which it can harm co-located VMs.|$|R
30|$|The {{vulnerability}} of sensor nodes makes them potential victims of cyber/physical <b>attacks</b> driven by intelligent adversaries. <b>Attacks</b> to information networks are usually categorized into outsider <b>attacks</b> and insider <b>attacks.</b> Outsider <b>attacks</b> include (distributed) {{denial of service}} (DoS) <b>attacks,</b> which use the broadcasting nature for wireless communications to disrupt the communications capabilities [10]. In contrast, in insider <b>attacks</b> the adversary “recruits” sensor nodes by malware through cyber/wireless means, or directly by physical substitution [13]. Following the classical Byzantine generals problem [14], these “Byzantine nodes” are authenticated, and recognized as valid members of the network. Byzantine nodes can hence generate false data, exhibit arbitrary behaviour, and collude with others to create network malfunctions. In general, insider <b>attacks</b> {{are considered to be}} more potentially harmful to information networks than outside <b>attacks.</b>|$|R
