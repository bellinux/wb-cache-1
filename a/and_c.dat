40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the capacity of Cynodon nlemfuensis (star grass) to accumulate lead (Pb) <b>and</b> cadmium (<b>Cd)</b> <b>and</b> develop metal uptake models for sandy soils receiving treated sewage from domestic and industrial sources. The study area comprised a non-polluted area and an adjacent area that received treated sewage from Harare’s Firle Wastewater Treatment Plant for over 30 years. Measured soil properties, total Pb <b>and</b> <b>Cd</b> in soils <b>and</b> grass and past records of Pb <b>and</b> <b>Cd</b> in treated sewage were analysed. Growing grass in a greenhouse in pots with previously non-polluted soils amended by single and mixed Pb <b>and</b> <b>Cd</b> salts <b>and</b> irrigated with treated sewage tested the uptake capacity of star grass. Yields, soil bio-available and grass Pb <b>and</b> <b>Cd</b> levels were measured and used to develop models for estimating critical soil and grass concentrations at which productivity declines. In the field, star grass grown in 10 m x 10 m plots in the non-irrigated and irrigated areas, received varying amounts of treated sewage over 11 months. Soil bio-available and grass metal contents were measured and used to develop field-based models to predict Pb <b>and</b> <b>Cd</b> content in star grass. Star grass had a high Pb <b>and</b> <b>Cd</b> extraction capacity, making it unsuitable for pasture if grown on polluted soils. Correlation between total Pb <b>and</b> <b>Cd</b> in soils <b>and</b> grass was insignificant (p< 0. 05). Logarithm-based models of log 10 bio-available soil levels and log 10 grass metal levels provided the best-fit regression models for Pb <b>and</b> <b>Cd</b> predictions in grass. Toxicity levels of Pb <b>and</b> <b>Cd</b> that were derived for star grass from pot-based models were higher than levels recommended for pasture. Toxicity occurred without visible signs on grass, making it difficult to recognise toxicity without testing. The field-based uptake models predicted safe bio-available limits for pasture on sandy soils. The co-presence of Pb <b>and</b> <b>Cd</b> resulted in increased Cd uptake but did not significantly affect Pb uptake. Star grass can accumulate more than 1 mg/kg of Cd at total soil Cd levels of less than 1 mg/kg, suggesting that the soil limit may be too high for a sandy soil.

40|$|Background Lead (Pb) <b>and</b> cadmium (<b>Cd)</b> {{are two of}} the {{hazardous}} metals in the environment due to their acute and chronic effects on human health. Zero-valent iron nanoparticles (ZVINPs) are one of the adsorbents proposed as an efficient adsorbent for Pb <b>and</b> <b>Cd.</b> Objectives This study evaluated the quantitative removal efficiency of Pb <b>and</b> <b>Cd</b> ions from contaminated water by ZVINPs. In addition, the capability of ZVINPs as a solid phase extractor for preconcentration and determination of Pb <b>and</b> <b>Cd</b> was investigated. Materials and Methods Four samples, each from different water sources like Well water (Shushtar, Iran), Karoon River (Ahvaz, Iran), Caspian Sea (northern Iran) and Persian Gulf (southern Iran) were collected. Results The elapsed time for quantitative removal of both Pb <b>and</b> <b>Cd</b> ions was two minutes. This method is applicable in a widespread range of pH and relatively high concentrations of electrolyte (NaCl) for the efficient removal (> 99 %) of Pb <b>and</b> <b>Cd</b> ions in water samples. The adsorption of Pb <b>and</b> <b>Cd</b> ions on ZVINPs was well followed by the Langmuir model. The maximum adsorption amounts of Pb <b>and</b> <b>Cd</b> ions on ZVINPs were 96. 5 and 58. 3 mg/g, respectively. Limits of detection (LODs) of the method for lead and cadmium ions were 0. 015 and 0. 002 mg/L, respectively. The relative standard deviations for ten replicate determinations (Pb 2 + 0. 3 mg/L, Cd 2 + 0. 03 mg/L) were below 5 %. The enrichment factors were more than 16 and 14 for Pb 2 + <b>and</b> <b>Cd</b> 2 +, respectively. Conclusions The proposed method is simple, fast, cost-effective and safe for the environment...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: Heavy metals, such us Pb <b>and</b> <b>Cd</b> {{are common}} {{pollutants}} in urban soils mainly due to traffic emissions. In order {{to investigate the}} spatial distribution of Pb <b>and</b> <b>Cd</b> in urban soils of Chania city, the soil samples were collected from the roadside of the major squares, parks and traffic islands at three depths (0 - 5 cm, 5 - 15 cm and 15 - 30 cm). The total and bioavailable forms of Pb <b>and</b> <b>Cd</b> were determined by using flame Atomic Absorption Spectrometry, after their extraction with boiling Aqua Regia and DTPA respectively. Total concentration data in the three depths, according to Polish contamination standards (environmental guideline for metal pollution in soils) indicated that the studied soils can be considered medium polluted of Pb <b>and</b> <b>Cd.</b> In all sampling sites, the total contents of Pb <b>and</b> <b>Cd</b> decreased with depth suggesting undisturbed conditions and airborne deposition. The bioavailable concentrations of the studied metals were low maybe due to basic soil pH and to high content of free calcium carbonate and decreased slightly with soil depth. The relative availability of Pb was about four times higher than Cd. The highest total and bioavailable concentrations of Pb <b>and</b> <b>Cd</b> {{were found in the}} centre of the city (Agora square) mainly due to heavy traffic load.
