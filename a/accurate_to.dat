Its three Fine Guidance Sensors (FGS) are primarily used to keep the telescope accurately pointed during an observation, but {{can also be used}} to carry out extremely accurate astrometry; measurements <b>accurate</b> <b>to</b> within 0.0003arcseconds have been achieved.|$|E
5|$|In 1627, Johannes Kepler {{became the}} first person to predict a transit of Venus, by {{predicting}} the 1631 event. His methods were not sufficiently <b>accurate</b> <b>to</b> predict that the transit would not be visible in most of Europe, and as a consequence, nobody was able to use his prediction to observe the phenomenon.|$|E

Modern party politics did not really begin to coalesce in Great Britain until at least 1784.|$|E
5|$|The International System of Units {{standardized}} its unit of time, the second, on {{the properties}} of cesium in 1967. SI defines the second as 9,192,631,770 cycles of the radiation which corresponds to the transition between two electron spin energy levels of the ground state of the 133Cs atom. The cesium atomic clock, maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, is <b>accurate</b> <b>to</b> 30billionths of a second per year. Atomic clocks have employed other elements, such as hydrogen and rubidium vapor, offering greater stability—in the case of hydrogen clocks—and smaller size, lower power consumption, and thus lower cost (in the case of rubidium clocks).|$|E
5|$|The {{telescope}} {{was involved in}} the discovery of millisecond pulsars, and also discovered the first pulsar in a globular cluster in 1986—a millisecond pulsar in the Messier 28 globular cluster. In September 2006, the results of three years of observing a double pulsar, PSR J0737-3039, with the Lovell telescope, {{as well as with the}} Parkes and Green Bank Telescopes, were announced— confirming that the general theory of relativity is <b>accurate</b> <b>to</b> 99.5%.|$|E

5|$|There {{are three}} modes {{that can be}} played with teams from either the American League or the National League: regular season games, All-star games or the World Series (interleague). The World Series rounds, however, are only one match each, which is not <b>accurate</b> <b>to</b> the real World Series. Due to the licensing, the teams even appear {{complete}} in their official uniforms and colours and also have all the options that a real baseball player would have, including bunting, pitching out, base stealing and throwing errors.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{cutaway model}} of Viribus Unitis in the Museum of Military History in Vienna. The model is at {{a scale of}} 1:25 and has a total length of 6 metres. It was built between 1913 and 1917 by eight {{craftsmen}} of the shipyard Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino. The model is true to the original in structure, layout, and engine system. It is <b>accurate</b> <b>to</b> the point that, for instance, the painting in the wardroom of the model exactly replicates the original not only in subject {{but also in the}} painting technique (oil on canvas).|$|E
5|$|A {{computer}} program such as KetoCalculator {{may be used}} to help generate recipes. The meals often have four components: heavy whipping cream, a protein-rich food (typically meat), a fruit or vegetable and a fat such as butter, vegetable oil or mayonnaise. Only low-carbohydrate fruits and vegetables are allowed, which excludes bananas, potatoes, peas and corn. Suitable fruits are divided into two groups based on the amount of carbohydrate they contain, and vegetables are similarly divided into two groups. Foods within each of these four groups may be freely substituted to allow for variation without needing to recalculate portion sizes. For example, cooked broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower and green beans are all equivalent. Fresh, canned or frozen foods are equivalent, but raw and cooked vegetables differ, and processed foods are an additional complication. Parents are required to be precise when measuring food quantities on an electronic scale <b>accurate</b> <b>to</b> 1g. The child must eat the whole meal and cannot have extra portions; any snacks must be incorporated into the meal plan. A small amount of MCT oil {{may be used to}} help with constipation or to increase ketosis.|$|E

5|$|At {{the behest}} of the Paris Observatory under le Verrier, Marie Alfred Cornu {{repeated}} Fizeau's 1848 toothed wheel measurement in a series of experiments in 1872–76. The goal was to obtain a value for the speed of light <b>accurate</b> <b>to</b> one part in a thousand. Cornu's equipment allowed him to monitor high orders of extinction, up to the 21st order. Instead of estimating the intensity minimum of the light being blocked by the adjacent teeth, a relatively inaccurate procedure, Cornu made pairs of observations {{on either side of the}} intensity minima, averaging the values obtained with the wheel spun clockwise and counterclockwise. An electric circuit recorded the wheel rotations on a chronograph chart which enabled precise rate comparisons against the observatory clock, and a telegraph key arrangement allowed Cornu to mark on this same chart the precise moments when he judged that an extinction had been entered or exited. His final experiment was run over a path nearly three times as long as that used by Fizeau, and yielded a figure of 300400km/s that is within 0.2% of the modern value.|$|E
5|$|During the Yayoi {{period from}} about 300BC to 300AD, iron tools and weapons such as knives, axes, swords or spears, were {{introduced}} to Japan from China via the Korean peninsula. Shortly after this event, Chinese, Korean, and eventually Japanese swordsmiths produced ironwork locally. Swords were forged to imitate Chinese blades: generally straight chokutō with faulty tempering. Worn slung from the waist, they were likely used as stabbing and slashing weapons. Although functionally it would generally be more <b>accurate</b> <b>to</b> define them as hacking rather than slashing weapons. Swordmaking centers developed in Yamato, San'in and Mutsu where various types of blades such as tsurugi, tōsu and tachi were produced. Flat double-edged (hira-zukuri) blades originated in the Kofun period, and around the mid-Kofun period swords evolved from thrusting to cutting weapons. Ancient swords were also religious objects according to the 8th century chronicles Nihon Shoki and Kojiki. In fact, one of the Imperial Regalia of Japan is a sword, and swords have been discovered in ancient tumuli or handed down as treasures of Shinto shrines or Buddhist temples. Few ancient blades (jokotō) exist because the iron has been corroded by humidity.|$|E
5|$|Eighty {{percent of}} self-harm {{involves}} stabbing or cutting the skin {{with a sharp}} object. However, the number of self-harm methods are only limited by an individual's inventiveness and their determination to harm themselves; this includes burning, self-poisoning, alcohol abuse, self-embedding of objects, hair pulling, bruising/hitting one's self, scratching to hurt one's self, knowingly abusing over the counter or prescription drugs, and forms of self-harm related to anorexia and bulimia. The locations of self-harm are often areas {{of the body that}} are easily hidden and concealed from the detection of others. As well as defining self-harm in terms of the act of damaging the body, it may be more <b>accurate</b> <b>to</b> define self-harm in terms of the intent, and the emotional distress that the person is attempting to deal with. Neither the DSM-IV-TR nor the ICD-10 provide diagnostic criteria for self-harm. It is often seen as only a symptom of an underlying disorder, though many people who self-harm would like this to be addressed.|$|E

5|$|In 1936, Romanian {{physicist}} Horia Hulubei and his French colleague Yvette Cauchois also analyzed pollucite, {{this time}} using their high-resolution X-ray apparatus. They observed several weak emission lines, which they {{presumed to be}} those of element 87. Hulubei and Cauchois reported their discovery and proposed the name moldavium, along with the symbol Ml, after Moldavia, the Romanian province where Hulubei was born. In 1937, Hulubei's work was criticized by American physicist F. H. Hirsh Jr., who rejected Hulubei's research methods. Hirsh was certain that eka-caesium would not be found in nature, and that Hulubei had instead observed mercury or bismuth X-ray lines. Hulubei insisted that his X-ray apparatus and methods were too <b>accurate</b> <b>to</b> make such a mistake. Because of this, Jean Baptiste Perrin, Nobel Prize winner and Hulubei's mentor, endorsed moldavium as the true eka-caesium over Marguerite Perey's recently discovered francium. Perey took pains to be accurate and detailed in her criticism of Hulubei's work, and finally she was credited as the sole discoverer of element 87. All other previous purported discoveries of element 87 were ruled out due to francium's very limited half-life.|$|E
5|$|Paleontology {{seeks to}} map out how living things have changed through time. A {{substantial}} hurdle to this aim is the difficulty of working out how old fossils are. Beds that preserve fossils typically lack the radioactive elements needed for radiometric dating. This technique is our only means of giving rocks greater than about 50 million years old an absolute age, and can be <b>accurate</b> <b>to</b> within 0.5% or better. Although radiometric dating requires very careful laboratory work, its basic principle is simple: the rates at which various radioactive elements decay are known, and so {{the ratio of the}} radioactive element to the element into which it decays shows how long ago the radioactive element was incorporated into the rock. Radioactive elements are common only in rocks with a volcanic origin, and so the only fossil-bearing rocks that can be dated radiometrically are a few volcanic ash layers.|$|E
5|$|The National Hurricane Center {{forecasts}} {{storm surge}} using the SLOSH model, {{which is an}} abbreviation for Sea, Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes. The model is <b>accurate</b> <b>to</b> within 20percent. SLOSH inputs include the central pressure of a tropical cyclone, storm size, the cyclone's forward motion, its track, and maximum sustained winds. Local topography, bay and river orientation, depth of the sea bottom, astronomical tides, {{as well as other}} physical features, are taken into account in a predefined grid referred to as a SLOSH basin. Overlapping SLOSH basins are defined for the southern and eastern coastline of the continental U.S. Some storm simulations use more than one SLOSH basin; for instance, Hurricane Katrina SLOSH model runs used both the Lake Ponchartrain / New Orleans basin, and the Mississippi Sound basin, for the northern Gulf of Mexico landfall. The final output from the model run will display the maximum envelope of water, or MEOW, that occurred at each location.|$|E
