5|$|Rainforests <b>are</b> <b>areas</b> of {{the world}} with very high rainfall. Both {{tropical}} and temperate rainforests exist. Tropical rainforests occupy a large band of the planet mostly along the equator. Most temperate rainforests are located on mountainous west coasts between 45 and 55 degrees latitude, but they are often found in other areas.|$|E
5|$|Elk {{handling}} facilities <b>are</b> <b>areas</b> of pens with {{loading and unloading}} ramps where water and food are provided to the elk. They were created to help reduce herd numbers by increasing wariness and encouraging migratory behaviour, deterring the elk {{from the town of}} Banff. These measures allowed more predator–prey interactions thanks to the creation of corridors. They also increased elk migration, restored the willow and aspen communities and highlighted the primary role of wolves in elk population management.|$|E

5|$|Located on the Atlantic {{coast of}} the Sahara Desert, it lies {{on the west coast}} of Africa. With the {{exception}} of Friendship Port and a small fishing port, the coastal strip is mostly left empty and allowed to flood. The coastline includes shifting sandbanks and sandy beaches. There <b>are</b> <b>areas</b> of quicksand close to the harbour. Nouakchott is largely flat and only a few meters above sea level. It is threatened by the sand dunes advancing from its eastern side which pose a daily problem. There have been efforts to save particular areas, including work by Jean Meunier. Owing to the rapid build-up, the city is quite spread out, with few tall buildings. Most buildings are one-story.|$|E
5|$|Microbial mats <b>are</b> <b>areas</b> of {{sediment}} stabilised {{by the presence}} of colonies of microbes that secrete sticky fluids or otherwise bind the sediment particles. They appear to migrate upwards when covered by a thin layer {{of sediment}} but this is an illusion caused by the colony's growth; individuals do not, themselves, move. If too thick a layer of sediment is deposited before they can grow or reproduce through it, parts of the colony will die leaving behind fossils with a characteristically wrinkled ("elephant skin") and tubercular texture.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the area}} is now Green Belt, placing {{restrictions}} on the kinds of developments that can take place. There <b>are</b> <b>areas</b> of commercial peat extraction, but Salford City Council is seeking to return at least some back to wet mossland. Planning permission for peat extraction expired {{at the end of}} 2010. At a meeting held on 30 June 2011 Salford Council decided not to renew the permission, and on 1 August obtained a court order prohibiting any further extraction pending an appeal by the companies involved. A public inquiry concluded in 2012 supported the council's decision, and commercial peat extraction on Chat Moss ceased.|$|E

5|$|Motor systems <b>are</b> <b>areas</b> of {{the brain}} that are {{involved}} in initiating body movements, that is, in activating muscles. Except for the muscles that control the eye, which are driven by nuclei in the midbrain, all the voluntary muscles in the body are directly innervated by motor neurons in the spinal cord and hindbrain. Spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to the spinal cord, and by inputs that descend from the brain. The intrinsic spinal circuits implement many reflex responses, and contain pattern generators for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming. The descending connections from the brain allow for more sophisticated control.|$|E
5|$|Parts of Juniata County {{are fairly}} flat, but there <b>are</b> <b>areas</b> {{in the county}} with slopes of 25% or greater. However, most {{development}} in the county is confined to areas with slopes of 15% or less. Many of the county's steepest slopes, with grades of 25% of more, are located {{on the edges of}} the county. These slopes are generally found on mountainous ridges. However, there are some similarly steep slopes {{in the middle of the}} county. All four boroughs in the county have slopes with a grade of 25% or more near them. Slopes of 15% to 25% can be found throughout the county.|$|E

5|$|As of 2017, {{there are}} 39 National Parks and eight National Park Reserves (Kluane {{is the name}} for two areas–a {{national}} park and an adjacent proposed national park (a National Park Reserve)). National Park Reserves <b>are</b> <b>areas</b> intended to become national parks pending settlement of native land claims. Until then, they are managed under the National Parks Act as quasi-parks, but are included here in the main list. This page also includes the country's three National Marine Conservation Areas (NMCAs), a single NMCA Reserve, the lone National Landmark, and proposed parks. National parks currently cover an area of 303,571km², or about 3.0% of the total land area of Canada. Rounding out the national park system {{is a collection of}} National Historic Sites, listed separately.|$|E
5|$|Nightlife in Birmingham {{is mainly}} {{concentrated}} along Broad Street and into Brindleyplace. Although {{in more recent}} years Broad St has lost its popularity due to the closing of several clubs, the Arcadian now has more popularity in terms of nightlife. Outside the Broad Street area are many stylish and underground venues. The Medicine Bar in the Custard Factory, hmv Institute, Rainbow Pub and Air are large clubs and bars in Digbeth. Around the Chinese Quarter <b>are</b> <b>areas</b> such as the Arcadian and Hurst Street Gay Village, that abound with bars and clubs. Summer Row, The Mailbox, O2 Academy in Bristol Street, Snobs Nightclub, St Philips/Colmore Row, St Paul's Square and the Jewellery Quarter all have a vibrant night life.

5|$|Physical sexual {{stimulation}} of the clitoris {{is the most common}} way for women to achieve orgasm; general statistics indicate that 70–80 percent of women require direct clitoral stimulation (consistent manual, oral or other concentrated friction against the external parts of the clitoris) to reach orgasm, though indirect clitoral stimulation (for example, via vaginal penetration) may also be sufficient for female orgasm. The area near the entrance of the vagina (the lower third) contains nearly 90percent of the vaginal nerve endings, and there <b>are</b> <b>areas</b> in the anterior vaginal wall and between the top junction of the labia minora and the urethra that are especially sensitive, but intense sexual pleasure, including orgasm, solely from vaginal stimulation is occasional or otherwise absent because the vagina has significantly fewer nerve endings than the clitoris.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{findings}} have confirmed important examples of heritable changes that cannot {{be explained by}} changes to the sequence of nucleotides in the DNA. These phenomena are classed as epigenetic inheritance systems. DNA methylation marking chromatin, self-sustaining metabolic loops, gene silencing by RNA interference and the three-dimensional conformation of proteins (such as prions) <b>are</b> <b>areas</b> where epigenetic inheritance systems have been discovered at the organismic level. Developmental biologists suggest that complex interactions in genetic networks and communication among cells can lead to heritable variations that may underlay some of the mechanics in developmental plasticity and canalisation. Heritability may also occur at even larger scales. For example, ecological inheritance {{through the process of}} niche construction is defined by the regular and repeated activities of organisms in their environment. This generates a legacy of effects that modify and feed back into the selection regime of subsequent generations. Descendants inherit genes plus environmental characteristics generated by the ecological actions of ancestors. Other examples of heritability in evolution that are not under the direct control of genes include the inheritance of cultural traits and symbiogenesis.|$|E
5|$|Silviculture is the {{practice}} of controlling the establishment, growth, composition, health, and quality of forests, which <b>are</b> <b>areas</b> that have a high density of trees. Cultivated trees are planted and tended by humans, usually because they provide food (fruits or nuts), ornamental beauty, or some type of wood product that benefits people. An area of land planted with fruit or nut trees is an orchard. A small wooded area, usually with no undergrowth, is called a grove and a small wood or thicket of trees and bushes is called a coppice or copse. A large area of land covered with trees and undergrowth is called woodland or forest. An area of woodland composed primarily of trees established by planting or artificial seeding {{is known as a}} plantation.|$|E

5|$|The brain {{contains}} several motor {{areas that}} project {{directly to the}} spinal cord. At the lowest level are motor areas in the medulla and pons, which control stereotyped movements such as walking, breathing, or swallowing. At a higher level <b>are</b> <b>areas</b> in the midbrain, such as the red nucleus, {{which is responsible for}} coordinating movements of the arms and legs. At a higher level yet is the primary motor cortex, a strip of tissue located at the posterior edge of the frontal lobe. The primary motor cortex sends projections to the subcortical motor areas, but also sends a massive projection directly to the spinal cord, through the pyramidal tract. This direct corticospinal projection allows for precise voluntary control of the fine details of movements. Other motor-related brain areas exert secondary effects by projecting to the primary motor areas. Among the most important secondary areas are the premotor cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum.|$|E
5|$|The park's {{predominant}} {{environment is}} open grass plain with scattered Acacia bushes. The western uplands {{of the park}} have highland dry forest with stands of Olea africana, Croton dichogamus, Brachylaena hutchinsii, and Calodendrum. The lower slopes of these areas are grassland. Themeda, cypress, Digitaria, and Cynodon species are found in these grassland areas. There are also scattered yellow-barked Acacia xanthophloea. There is a riverine forest along the permanent river {{in the south of}} the park. There <b>are</b> <b>areas</b> of broken bush and deep rocky valleys and gorges within the park. The species in the valleys are predominantly Acacia and Euphorbia candelabrum. Other tree species include Apodytes dimidiata, Canthium schimperiana, Elaeodendron buchananii, Ficus eriocarpa, Aspilia mossambicensis, Rhus natalensis, and Newtonia species. Several plants that grow on the rocky hillsides are unique to the Nairobi area. These species include Euphorbia brevitorta, Drimia calcarata, and Murdannia clarkeana.|$|E
5|$|Wear facets <b>are</b> <b>areas</b> of a tooth {{that show}} {{evidence}} {{of contact with}} a tooth in the opposing jaw when the teeth are brought together (known as occlusion). Flynn and colleagues identified two wear facets at {{the front and back}} margins of the talonid basin; they argue that these wear facets suggest the presence of a protocone (another cusp on the outer side of the tooth) on the upper molars. In a 2005 paper on Asfaltomylos, a related primitive mammal from Argentina, Thomas Martin and Oliver Rauhut disputed the presence of these wear facets within the talonid basin in Ambondro and instead identified wear facets on the cusps and crests surrounding the basin. They proposed that wear in the australosphenidan talonid occurs mainly on the rims, not in the talonid basin itself, and that australosphenidans may not have had a functional protocone.|$|E
40|$|The {{currently}} recommended regimen for focal radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of Barrett's esophagus (BE) comprises 2 {{applications of}} energy, cleaning {{of the device}} and ablation zone, and 2 additional applications of energy. A simplified regimen may be of clinical utility if it is faster, easier, and equally safe and effective. To compare the efficacy of 2 focal RFA regimens. Three tertiary referral centers. Consecutive patients scheduled for focal RFA of BE with flat type BE with at least 2 BE islands or mosaic groups of islands <b>were</b> enrolled. <b>BE</b> <b>areas</b> <b>were</b> paired: 1 <b>area</b> <b>was</b> randomized to the "standard" regimen (2 × 15 J/cm(2) -clean- 2 × 15 J/cm(2)) or to the "simplified" regimen (3 × 15 J/cm(2) -no clean), allocating the second area automatically to the other regimen. The percentage of surface area regression of each <b>area</b> <b>was</b> scored at 2 months by the endoscopist (blinded). Proportion of completely removed <b>BE</b> <b>areas</b> at 2 months. Calculated sample size was 46 pairs of <b>BE</b> <b>areas</b> using a noninferiority design. Noninferiority was defined as < 20 % difference in the paired proportions. Forty-five equivalent pairs of <b>BE</b> <b>areas</b> <b>were</b> included in 41 patients. The proportion of completely removed <b>BE</b> <b>areas</b> at 2 months after focal RFA was 30 (67 %) for standard and 33 (73 %) for simplified. Noninferiority was demonstrated by a 7 % difference (95 % CI, - 10. 6 to + 20. 9). Tertiary referral centers. The results of this multicenter randomized trial suggest that a simplified 3 × 15 J/cm(2) focal ablation regimen is not inferior to the standard regimen, regarding the endoscopic removal of residual Barrett island...|$|R
