5|$|The North American species once {{described}} by Alexander H. Smith, P.kauffmaniana, {{is closely related}} to P.flammans, but differs in having a more distinctly viscid cap. Smith was later to revise his opinion on the existence of P.kauffmaniana <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>unique</b> species—he believed that environmental variations in humidity were the cause of differences in the cap cuticle gelatinization observed in Pholiotas collected from different North American locales. P.kauffmaniana is now considered synonymous with P.flammans.|$|E

40|$|Marie Nováčková Bachelor thesis Charles University in Prague, Faculty of Education, Department of Art Education Camera obscura <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>Unique</b> Tool of Recording Reality. Possibilities of its Application in Contemporary Art Education. The thesis follows camera obscura <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>unique</b> {{medium for}} artistic work. Forms of camera obscura are {{described}} through {{the cultural and}} historical context, focusing on contemporary visual culture and pinhole photography. The pinhole camera is seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> tool for artistic work, which can {{be subject to the}} author, can cooperate with him or can be artistically autonomus. These theoretical findings are reflected in the conception of an educational program connecting learning about the development of photographic images with the individual perception of their stories. A pinhole photography and the related story from the practical part is a comic strip created by using photographies made by pinhole camera, which storyline supported by a drawing. The comic strip is called The Ravens Player and its format is structured as Bach's composition Toccata a fuga in d-moll.

5|$|When released, Raptor Red was {{generally}} praised: Bakker's anthropomorphism was seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>unique</b> and positive {{aspect of the}} book, and his writing was described as folksy and heartfelt. Criticisms of the novel included a perceived lack of characterization and average writing. Some scientists, such as paleontologist David B. Norman, took issue with the scientific theories portrayed in the novel, fearing that the public would accept them as fact, while Discovery Channel host Jay Ingram defended Bakker's creative decisions in an editorial.|$|E
5|$|Within botany {{there are}} a number of sub-disciplines that focus on {{particular}} plant groups, each with their own range of related studies (anatomy, morphology etc.). Included here are: phycology (algae), pteridology (ferns), bryology (mosses and liverworts) and palaeobotany (fossil plants) and their histories are treated elsewhere (see side bar). To this list can be added mycology, the study of fungi, which were once treated as plants, but are now ranked <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>unique</b> kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Admiralty {{law is the}} {{particular}} body of national laws applied to maritime questions and offenses, as the uncertainty of sea voyages has caused the sea to be viewed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>unique</b> jurisdiction since antiquity. Rhodian, Roman, Byzantine, Trani, and Amalfian laws were important influences on the French, Genovese, and Hanseatic codes which established the first English courts of admiralty. Unlike the usual English common law system, the courts of admiralty hewed closer to Continental practice, leaving it open for abuse {{that contributed to the}} American Revolution. The adoption of the present constitution reintroduced admiralty law to the United States, but with a relatively larger sphere for trials by jury.|$|E

5|$|By {{the second}} {{decade of the}} 21st century, the overall {{consensus}} supported the position {{that there was only}} a single author who was writing either {{at the end of the}} 4th century or the beginning of the 5th century, and who was interested in blending contemporary issues (political, religious and social) into the lives of the 3rd century emperors. Further, that the author used the fictitious elements in the work to highlight references to other published works, such as to Cicero and Ammianus Marcellinus in a complex allegorical game. Despite these conundrums, it is the only continuous account in Latin for much of its period and is thus continually being re-evaluated, since modern historians are unwilling to abandon it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>unique</b> source of possible information, despite its obvious untrustworthiness on many levels.|$|E
5|$|In {{the view}} of Mary Beagon, writing in The Classical Tradition in 2010:the Historia naturalis has regained its status {{to a greater extent}} than at any time since the advent of Humanism.

5|$|New Thought and Christian Science {{differed}} in that Eddy saw her views <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>unique</b> and final revelation. Eddy's idea of malicious animal magnetism marked another distinction (that {{people can be}} harmed by the bad thoughts of others), introducing an element of fear that was absent from the New Thought literature. Most significantly, she dismissed the material world as an illusion, rather than as merely subordinate to Mind, leading her to reject the use of medicine, or materia medica, and making Christian Science the most controversial of the metaphysical groups. Reality for Eddy was purely spiritual.|$|E

5|$|Strandzha Nature Park is {{situated}} entirely in Burgas Province within {{the territory of}} two municipalities, Malko Tarnovo and Tsarevo, in the extreme south-eastern corner of Bulgaria.

5|$|While the {{contemporary}} Western ideal sees marriage <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>unique</b> bond {{between two people}} who are in love, families in which heredity is central to power or inheritance (such as royal families) have often seen marriage in a different light.

Marriage for political, economic, or diplomatic reasons, the marriage of state, was a pattern seen for centuries among European rulers.|$|E

5|$|One {{definition}} sees language {{primarily as}} the mental faculty that allows humans to undertake linguistic behaviour: to learn languages and {{to produce and}} understand utterances. This definition stresses the universality of language to all humans, and it emphasizes the biological basis for the human capacity for language <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>unique</b> development of the human brain. Proponents of {{the view that the}} drive to language acquisition is innate in humans argue that this is supported by the fact that all cognitively normal children raised in an environment where language is accessible will acquire language without formal instruction. Languages may even develop spontaneously in environments where people live or grow up together without a common language; for example, creole languages and spontaneously developed sign languages such as Nicaraguan Sign Language. This view, which {{can be traced back to}} the philosophers Kant and Descartes, understands language to be largely innate, for example, in Chomsky's theory of Universal Grammar, or American philosopher Jerry Fodor's extreme innatist theory. These kinds of definitions are often applied in studies of language within a cognitive science framework and in neurolinguistics.|$|E
