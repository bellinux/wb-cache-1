5|$|As an {{industrial}} process, {{the cost of}} welding {{plays a crucial role}} in manufacturing decisions. Many different variables affect the total cost, including equipment cost, labor cost, material cost, and energy cost. Depending on the process, equipment cost can vary, from inexpensive for methods like shielded metal arc welding and oxyfuel welding, to extremely expensive for methods like laser beam welding and electron beam welding. Because of their high cost, they are only used in high production operations. Similarly, because automation and robots increase equipment costs, they are only implemented when high production is necessary. Labor cost depends on the deposition rate (the rate of welding), the hourly wage, and the total operation time, including time spent fitting, welding, and handling the part. The cost of materials includes the cost of the base and filler material, and the cost of shielding gases. Finally, energy cost depends on <b>arc</b> <b>time</b> and welding power demand.|$|E
5|$|The {{trend of}} {{accelerating}} {{the speed at}} which welds are performed in the steel erection industry comes at a risk to the integrity of the connection. Without proper fusion to the base materials provided by sufficient <b>arc</b> <b>time</b> on the weld, a project inspector cannot ensure the effective diameter of the puddle weld therefore he or she cannot guarantee the published load capacities unless they witness the actual installation. This method of puddle welding is common in the United States and Canada for attaching steel sheets to bar joist and structural steel members. Regional agencies are responsible for ensuring the proper installation of puddle welding on steel construction sites. Currently there is no standard or weld procedure which can ensure the published holding capacity of any unwitnessed connection, but this is under review by the American Welding Society.|$|E

40|$|While hand {{grinding}} can be tolerated in some circumstances, producing welds for safety-critical applications and where weld properties must meet stringent inspection criteria needs a more con-trolled approach. Following {{are some tips}} for optimizing electrode preparation, {{which can lead to}} a significant increase in electrode life. 1. Choose the right diameter. Table 1 can be used to determine the electrode diameter best suited to the welding current you are using. This guide to the optimum diameter is based on decades of welding practice. 2. Choose a reputable supplier. Superficially, electrodes from differ-ent companies look much the same, but do consider that, in general, cost means quality. The better electrodes have been manufactured to ensure a small grain structure that allows for better migration of oxides to the tip, easier arc starting, improved <b>arc</b> <b>time,</b> and better weld quali-ty with minimized contamination. 3. Choose the best electrode compo-sition. For many years, manufacturers have been adding residual compounds to offer improved performance. Additions of sta-ble oxides such as thoria, ceria, and lan-thana provide the same level of emission as pure tungsten at lower temperatures, while improving <b>arc</b> <b>time</b> and stability. Pure tungsten has a high work func-tion, i. e., it takes a great deal of energy to operate. This makes it difficult to start and maintain a stable arc. It also has a high burn-off rate and thus a shorter serv-ice life. Thoria stablized. It is now clear that thoria, although promoting better weld-ing, is low-level radioactive and many manufacturers and welders have stopped using it because of the health concerns (Refs. 1, 2).

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we present and {{investigate}} two algebras, {{one based on}} term re-writing {{and the other on}} Petri nets, aimed at the specification and analysis of concurrent systems with timing information. The former is based on process expressions (at-expressions) and employs a set of SOS rules providing their operational semantics. The latter is based on a class of Petri nets with time restrictions associated with their arcs, called at-boxes, and the corresponding transition firing rule. We relate the two algebras through a compositionally defined mapping which for a given at-expression returns an at-box with behaviourally equivalent transition system. The resulting model, called the <b>Arc</b> <b>Time</b> Petri Box Calculus (atPBC), extends the existing approach of the Petri Box Calculus (PBC).

For handling convenience, the model was then transformed into its deterministic crisp equivalent. Additionally, the bi-objective model was simplified into a single objective model by converting one objective function into a new constraint with the given threshold. Finally, {{the results of the}} numerical experiments deriving from the LINGO software demonstrated the performance of the proposed approaches. Actually, multi-modal shortest path problems have been widely solved by the label-setting algorithm [35], label-correcting algorithm [25], and genetic algorithm [36, 37], which can also be considered in our further studies.|$|E

The approximation formulation is a finite dimensional system of equations which is solved as an optimization problem.

40|$|A paper {{describes}} a computationally efficient method of optimizing trajectories of spacecraft driven by propulsion systems that generate low thrusts and, hence, must be operated for long times. A common goal in trajectory-optimization problems {{is to find}} minimum-time, minimum-fuel, or Pareto-optimal trajectories (here, Pareto-optimality signifies that no other solutions are superior with respect to both flight time and fuel consumption). The present method utilizes genetic and simulated-annealing algorithms to search for globally Pareto-optimal solutions. These algorithms are implemented in parallel form to reduce computation time. These algorithms are coupled with either of two traditional trajectory- design approaches called "direct" and "indirect.
