5|$|Liver {{disease may}} present itself as tiredness, {{increased}} bleeding tendency or confusion (due to hepatic encephalopathy) and portal hypertension. The latter, {{a condition in}} which the pressure in the portal vein is markedly increased, leads to esophageal varices, blood vessels in the esophagus that may bleed in a life-threatening fashion, as well as enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) and accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity (<b>ascites).</b> On examination, signs of chronic liver disease such as spider angiomata (small distended blood vessels, usually on the chest) may be observed. Chronic active hepatitis has caused cirrhosis of the liver in most by the time they develop symptoms. While most people with cirrhosis have an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), this risk is relatively very low in Wilson's disease.|$|E
5|$|In {{those with}} cirrhosis, {{the risk of}} {{developing}} hepatic encephalopathy is 20% per year, and at any time about 30–45% of people with cirrhosis exhibit evidence of overt encephalopathy. The prevalence of minimal hepatic encephalopathy detectable on formal neuropsychological testing is 60–80%; this increases the likelihood of developing overt encephalopathy in the future. Once hepatic encephalopathy has developed, the prognosis is determined largely by other markers of liver failure, such as the levels of albumin (a protein produced by the liver), the prothrombin time (a test of coagulation, which relies on proteins produced in the liver), the presence of <b>ascites</b> and the level of bilirubin (a breakdown product of hemoglobin which is conjugated and excreted by the liver). Together with the severity of encephalopathy, these markers have been incorporated into the Child-Pugh score; this score determines the one- and two-year survival and may assist in a decision to offer liver transplantation.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} change detectable on laboratory investigations {{is a low}} {{white blood}} cell count, which may then be followed by low platelets and metabolic acidosis. A moderately elevated level of aminotransferase (AST and ALT) from the liver is commonly associated with low platelets and white blood cells. In severe disease, plasma leakage results in hemoconcentration (as indicated by a rising hematocrit) and hypoalbuminemia. Pleural effusions or <b>ascites</b> can be detected by physical examination when large, but the demonstration of fluid on ultrasound may assist in the early identification of dengue shock syndrome. The use of ultrasound is limited by lack of availability in many settings. Dengue shock syndrome is present if pulse pressure drops to ≤20mmHg along with peripheral vascular collapse. Peripheral vascular collapse is determined in children via delayed capillary refill, rapid heart rate, or cold extremities. While warning signs are an important aspect for early detection of potential serious disease, the evidence for any specific clinical or laboratory marker is weak.|$|E

Materials and methods:To evaluateCS extract effect on female mice inoculated with Eherlich carcinoma either intraperitoneally (<b>ascite</b> form) or subcutaneously back in the neck region (solid form). Camellia sinensist (CS) extract administrated daily for 2 weeks before tumor inoculation and then till the end of the experiment. Female mice bearing Eherlich <b>ascite</b> carcinoma (<b>ascite</b> form) sacrificed on 6 th and 12 th day after tumor inoculation and the other inoculated with the solid form sacrificed after 2 and 4 weeks of the tumor inoculation. Histopathological examination of Eherlich tumor, liver and kidney tissues was carried out and many of biochemical parameters (total protein, albumin, glucose, GPT, GOT, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, creatinine and urea) were analyzed. Results:The results reveled that tumor inoculation and the progressive formation of the Eherlich tumor leads to alterations in the structure of liver and kidney tissues as response to the tumor spread. Biochemical analysis represents decrease in total protein and albumin and increase in the other investigated parameters. CS extract administrations showed destructive effect on tumor tissue and significantly decreased the sever damage in tissue structures due to tumor spread. Amelioration in the different biochemical analysis was also recorded.

Eleven {{cases of}} tuberculous {{peritonitis}} (TBP) in hemodialysis (HD) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) {{patients at the}} Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital in Kaohsiung, Taiwan between 1991 and 2000 were studied retrospectively (six cases in the HD group and five cases in the CAPD group) The diagnosis of TBP was established by either positive <b>ascite</b> tuberculosis (TB) culture or biopsy-proven chronic granulomatous inflammation. Fever and abdominal pain were the most common symptoms, while leukocytosis and unexplained hypercalcemia were the most common laboratory findings. <b>Ascite</b> analysis showed a lymphocyte predominance in all HD patients, but in only 40 % of the CAPD patients. The mean duration of a diagnosis by <b>ascite</b> TB cultures was six weeks, while a diagnosis confirmed by laparascopic biopsy took one week. All four fatal cases were diagnosed by TB cultures.

5|$|The low oxygen level {{leads to}} {{physiologic}} constriction of the pulmonary arteries to correct ventilation-perfusion mismatching, which puts excessive {{strain on the}} right side of the heart. When this leads to right sided heart failure, it is known as cor pulmonale. Symptoms of this disorder occur because the heart has difficulty pumping blood from the body through the lungs. Fluid may, therefore, accumulate in the skin of the legs in the form of edema (swelling), and in the abdominal cavity in the form of ascites; decreased exercise tolerance and exertional chest pain may occur. On physical examination, characteristic findings are the presence of a raised jugular venous pressure, a palpable parasternal heave, a heart murmur due to blood leaking through the tricuspid valve, hepatomegaly (an enlarged liver), <b>ascites</b> and leg edema. Cor pulmonale occurs in about a third of all people with OHS.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptoms}} {{produced by}} AVMs {{in the liver}} depend {{on the type of}} abnormal connection that they form between blood vessels. If the connection is between arteries and veins, a large amount of blood bypasses the body's organs, for which the heart compensates by increasing the cardiac output. Eventually congestive cardiac failure develops ("high-output cardiac failure"), with breathlessness and leg swelling among other problems. If the AVM creates a connection between the portal vein and the blood vessels of the liver, the result may be portal hypertension (increased portal vein pressure), in which collateral blood vessels form in the esophagus (esophageal varices), which may bleed violently; furthermore, the increased pressure may give rise to fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity (<b>ascites).</b> If the flow in the AVM is in the other direction, portal venous blood flows directly into the veins rather than running through the liver; this may lead to hepatic encephalopathy (confusion due to portal waste products irritating the brain). Rarely, the bile ducts are deprived of blood, leading to severe cholangitis (inflammation of the bile ducts). Liver AVMs are detectable in over 70% of people with HHT, but only 10% experience problems as a result.|$|E

Aims - This study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of an experimental model of hepatic cirrhosis induced by carbon tetrachloride inhalation as well as the importance of lipid peroxidation and the characteristics of the ascitic fluid in this model. Methods - At first the hepatic histologic findings were assessed using the hematoxilin-eosin technique in different moments of carbon tetrachloride inhalation (5 th, 7 th, 9 th, 12 nd weeks). Later, at the end of 15 weeks of the study the rats were divided in three groups (control; control + phenobarbital; and carbon tetrachloride + phenobarbital) for lipid peroxidation, ascitic fluid and hystologic characteristics evaluation. For the lipid peroxidation analysis, thiobarbituric acid and QL techniques were used. Citologic and bacteriologic parameters were analysed in the ascitic fluid. Results - Cirrhosis was established in 100 % of carbon tetrachloride rats between the 12 nd and 15 th weeks with an elevation in the lipid peroxidation carbon tetrachloride rats' livers. Ascitic fluid infection was observed in one of seven rats who has developed ascitis.
