5|$|The {{first use}} of these tactics by the Tangmere Wing was used on 6 May 1941. The Wing engaged Bf 109Fs from Jagdgeschwader 51 (Fighter Wing 51), led by Werner Mölders. Noticing the {{approaching}} Germans below and behind them, the Spitfires feigned ignorance. Waiting for the optimum moment to turn the tables, Bader called for them to break, and whip <b>around</b> <b>behind</b> the Bf 109s. Unfortunately, while the tactic had been successful in avoiding a surprise attack, the break was mistimed. It left some Bf 109s still behind the Spitfires. In the battle that followed the Wing shot down one Bf 109 and damaged another, although Dundas was shot down {{for the second time}} in his career—and once again by Mölders, who had remained behind the British. Dundas was able to nurse his crippled fighter back to base and crash-land.|$|E

25|$|The Tabriz loom, {{named after}} the city of Tabriz, is used in Northwestern Iran. The warps are {{continuous}} and pass <b>around</b> <b>behind</b> the loom. Warp tension is obtained with wedges. The weavers sit on a fixed seat and when {{a portion of the}} carpet has been completed, the tension is released and the carpet is pulled down and rolled {{around the back of the}} loom. This process continues until the rug is completed, when the warps are severed and the carpet is taken off the loom.|$|E
25|$|Johnson’s poke check {{could also}} be used to force {{turnovers}} and generate offensive rushes. Combining good breakaway speed with positional awareness, Johnson would charge an oncoming attacker, use his poke check to strip the player of the puck, bank it off the sideboards and race after it. While on the attack himself, he would often deliberately make as if he were dumping the puck in. Instead, when thirty feet from the opposing net, he would deliberately fire the puck along the boards so that it rimmed <b>around</b> <b>behind</b> the opponent’s goalie; however, rather than chase after it, he would subsequently cut across the slot and pick up the puck as it came out the other side.|$|E
25|$|Mating occurs from May through June. Copulation is {{preceded by}} {{numerous}} head-bobs {{on the part}} of the male, who then circles <b>around</b> <b>behind</b> the female and grasps the nape of her neck. He then attempts to restrain the female in order to maneuver his tail under hers to position himself for intromission. Copulation generally lasts from 30 to 90 seconds, and a pair is rarely observed mating more than once or twice a day. Anywhere from two to eighteen eggs are usually laid in June or July depending on the size and age of the female, in nests excavated in pockets of earth exposed to the sun. The eggs go through a 90- to 100-day incubation period hatching in September and October. It has been noted that Cyclura eggs are some of the largest eggs laid by any lizard.|$|E

25|$|The {{stage is}} set with two large risers; {{the first in}} the shape of a square, the second, {{slightly}} more raised than the first one, is curved <b>around</b> <b>behind</b> it like a half-moon. On the square riser, from left to right, sit singers Viji Shankar, Lakshmi Shankar and Kamala Chakravarty, with percussionist Harihar Rao and bansuri player Hariprasad Chaurasia just behind them. Spread out along the crescent-shaped platform (from left to right) are three bowed string players, L. Subramaniam, Satyadev Pawar and Sultan Khan; Anant Lal, on shehnai; then the four drummers, T.V. Gopalkrishnan, Alla Rakha, Rijram Desad and Kamalesh Maitra, the last two partly surrounded by their tarangs (circles) of hand drums. Completing the ring of musicians along this curved riser is sitarist Kartick Kumar; Gopal Krishan, behind a raised vichitra veena; and finally Shivkumar Sharma, behind the large, harpsichord-like santoor. Shankar conducts the orchestra from just in front of the first riser, his back to the audience.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of 10 February 1964, the two ships were {{performing}} manoeuvres off Jervis Bay. Melbournes aircraft were performing flying exercises, and Voyager was tasked as plane guard, positioned behind and to port (left) of the carrier in order to rescue the crew of any ditching or crashing aircraft. After a series of turns effected to reverse the courses of the two ships, Voyager ended up ahead and to starboard (right) of the carrier. The destroyer was ordered to resume plane guard position, which would involve turning to starboard, away from the carrier, then looping <b>around</b> <b>behind.</b> Instead, Voyager began a starboard turn, but then came around to port. The bridge crew on Melbourne assumed that Voyager was zig-zagging to let the carrier overtake her, and would then assume her correct position. Senior personnel on Voyager were {{not paying attention to}} the manoeuvre. At 20:55, officers on both ships began desperate avoiding manoeuvres, but by then a collision was inevitable.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the command}} of the judge, the handler will stand the dog and leave from heel position. The handler will go a {{distance}} of approximately 6 feet and the judge will perform a cursory exam, touching the head, shoulders and hips, and when completed the judge will instruct the handler to return. The handler {{will return to the}} dog, going <b>around</b> <b>behind</b> it, and return to heel position. A variation on this exercise is used in advanced classes called the stand for examination. At the end of the heeling pattern instead of ordering the team to halt the judge will order the handler to stand their dog. While moving the handler will give the command and the dog must immediately stop while the handler continues moving to a point about 10 feet away. The judge will then approach and perform a more thorough exam of the dog and at the completion of the exam the dog is instructed to return directly to heel position WITHOUT coming to a front.|$|E

500|$|Throughout late July a {{situation}} of stalemate developed on Mount Tambu, which held up the Australian advance. As a result, Moten decided to bypass it in early August, sending the 2/6th Battalion north-west towards Komiatum. A path was eventually found and after securing Laver's Knoll, the Australians began working <b>around</b> <b>behind</b> Mount Tambu, towards {{the northern end of}} Bobdubi Ridge. The 2/7th was heavily involved with the 15th Brigade at this time, fighting to take a position known as [...] "The Coconuts". Finally, as the noose around Mount Tambu tightened, the Japanese abandoned it on 19 August.|$|E
500|$|Jaws: The Revenge was {{the first}} film of the series to be {{released}} on DVD. It was released on Region 1 as a 'vanilla' disc by Goodtimes, featuring Spanish and French subtitles. The feature is presented in a non-anamorphic 2.35:1 widescreen transfer. The soundtrack was presented in Dolby Digital 4.1, with one reviewer saying that the [...] "stereo separation is great with ocean waves swirling around you, the bubbles going by during the scuba scenes, and Hoagie's airplane flying <b>around</b> <b>behind</b> you." [...] The same reviewer praised the image transfer of McPherson's [...] "extremely well photographed" [...] cinematography. The film was re-released on DVD by Universal on June 3, 2003 in an anamorphic transfer. In 2015, Jaws: The Revenge was re-released on DVD {{as part of a}} three movie multi-pack, along with Jaws 2 and Jaws 3-D.|$|E
500|$|Throughout 21 November, {{there was}} a lull in the battle as the Australians paused for resupply. However, {{by the end of}} the day Whitehead had made good his supply {{situation}} and the advance resumed the following day. In an effort to find the best possible route, the Australians sent out small reconnaissance patrols and based on the intelligence they gained Whitehead produced a new set of orders prior to stepping off on 22 November. The 2/48th continued to advance along the road; the 2/23rd were to break track beyond Steeple Tree Hill at a location dubbed [...] "Turn-Off Corner" [...] and advance <b>around</b> <b>behind</b> the mission, to attack the 3,200 feature, while the 2/24th Battalion were to advance west, attempting to bypass the main Japanese positions in front of the 2,200 feature via an adjacent saddle to assist in the capture of Sattelberg, while also sending a detachment further north to secure Palanko.|$|E

500|$|The Australian commander, Kelly, ordered 'B' Company {{to move up}} {{and take}} the ridge and {{over the course of}} a week between 21–28 January they made several {{attempts}} against various parts of the ridge, approaching from the south, southeast and the north. These proved fruitless, although one platoon managed to encircle the position from the north before being engaged with heavy machine gun fire. On 23 January, the Australians established fire support in the form of guns from the 2nd Mountain Battery. Another three unsuccessful attempts were made on 24 January, and on 25 January 'C' Company carried out a movement to the flank in an attempt to get <b>around</b> <b>behind</b> the ridge and attack from the north. Crossing the crocodile-infested waters of the Genga about [...] from the ridge, the Australians established a bridgehead across the river with a line of communications back to the Pimple, which they kept open by constantly patrolling along it.|$|E
500|$|By {{the start}} of December Japan's Central China Area Army had swollen in {{strength}} to over 160,000 men, though only about 50,000 of these would ultimately participate in the fighting. The plan of attack against Nanking was a pincer movement which the Japanese called [...] "encirclement and annihilation". The two prongs of the Central China Area Army's pincer were the Shanghai Expeditionary Army (SEA) advancing on Nanking from its eastern side and the 10th Army advancing from its southern side. To {{the north and west}} of Nanking lay the Yangtze River, but the Japanese planned to plug this possible escape route as well both by dispatching a squadron of ships up the river and by deploying two special detachments to circle <b>around</b> <b>behind</b> the city. The Kunisaki Detachment was to cross the Yangtze in the south with the ultimate aim of occupying Pukou on the river bank west of Nanking while the Yamada Detachment was to be sent on the far north route with the ultimate aim of taking Mufushan just north of Nanking.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, to {{the west}} three battalions of Viet Cong 9th Division were massing for a decisive blow, {{preparing}} a regimental attack on the American and Australian positions. Units included J10 Battalion of the 761st Regiment, 707 Battalion of the 763rd Regiment and D800 Independent Battalion; in total around 2,000 men. By 20:00 they had completed a [...] approach march and were in assembly areas {{near the village of}} Ap Bo, using local women and youths as porters to carry ammunition, equipment and supplies. Small reconnaissance parties moved forward as pathfinders, easily locating the American headquarters due to the large amount of noise and light it gave off. The Viet Cong regimental commander determined to attack on three separate axes from the east, and to then send a force <b>around</b> <b>behind</b> the Brigade Headquarters and assault from the west, thereby surrounding the defenders and preventing them from concentrating their forces in defence. Fire support was provided from two separate locations: with [...] mortars deployed {{to the west}}, in between the Australians and the US 1st Brigade's headquarters, while [...] mortars would fire from a position in Ap Bo to the south-east.|$|E

500|$|Recording of {{the tracks}} that were to appear on Echo & the Bunnymen began at Conny Plank's studio in Cologne. Both Echo & the Bunnymen and their label, WEA Records, were unhappy {{with the results of}} the Norton {{sessions}} with Palmer playing drums. Keen to record again with de Freitas, the band decided to scrap the Norton sessions and to start recording a new album with Latham who had previously worked with the band on their 1985 single [...] "Bring on the Dancing Horses". The sessions moved from Cologne to ICP Studios in Brussels before returning to Cologne and finishing off at The Workhouse in London and Amazon Studios in Liverpool. The band hoped that the album would be a collection of simple songs; however, Latham was very specific and exacting, and he would work on one song for as long as a month. Recording was also complicated by the star treatment received by McCulloch. This, along with his heavy drinking, alienated him {{from the rest of the}} band. In a 1995 interview, band guitarist Will Sergeant said of McCulloch's treatment, [...] "We just found it all ridiculous. He had people running <b>around</b> <b>behind</b> him, basically wiping his arse." [...] McCulloch later said in a 1997 interview: [...] "I knew I was losing it. I was on another planet but then I didn't want to be on the one [...] were on." ...|$|E
