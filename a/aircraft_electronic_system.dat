50|$|One major {{obstacle}} in creating an {{in-flight entertainment system}} is system safety. With the sometimes miles of wiring involved, voltage leaks and arcing become a problem.

To contain any possible issues, the in-flight entertainment system is typically isolated from the main systems of the aircraft.

40|$|Abstract—The {{increasing}} use {{of mobile}} electronic devices by passengers and equipment on large aircraft may increase the like-lihood of interference with the <b>aircraft’s</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>systems.</b> Thus, the “interference path loss ” from a transmitting device inside the cabin of such aircraft to the antenna terminals of a victim system of the aircraft is of interest. Full-wave modeling and other deter-ministic techniques are impractical or undesirable for this purpose due to the potentially large electrical dimensions of the aircraft, {{as well as the}} variability of the cabin configuration. An alternative hy-brid analysis technique applicable to frequencies above very high frequency is proposed in which one first estimates the power that escapes the cabin using a simple method based on microwave cavity theory. Next, the radiating windows are modeled as magnetic cur-rents on a cylinder modeling the fuselage, and the resulting electric field at the location of the victim antenna is determined using the uniform geometrical theory of diffraction. Finally, the power deliv-ered to the victim antenna is estimated as the coherent sum of fields incident from the windows. This technique yields results consistent with measured results and yields additional physical insight that would be difficult to obtain through measurements or full-wave methods.

Enemy radars can be targeted by the missile independently or with targeting data from the launch <b>aircraft's</b> <b>electronic</b> warfare <b>systems,</b> such as the radar warning receiver. The missile has full ECCM capability, and uses passive guidance in self-defense (reactive) mode, or pre-programmed target mode, used primarily for area suppression or attacking expected targets. In order to improve survivability, the missile's airframe is built with composite materials that reduce its radar cross-section.|$|R
30|$|A {{major concern}} {{in the use of}} {{wireless}} passenger-carried electronic devices (PEDs) aboard aircraft is their electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) with <b>aircraft</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>systems.</b> Intentional PED emitters are protected by frequency separation regulated by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). Therefore, any intentional emission from an arbitrary PED is out of band for any aircraft NAV/COM system today [1]. Due to frequency separation WLAN 802.11 b should not be a candidate to interfere with sensitive aircraft navigation and communication systems. WLAN is out of band to any current aircraft navigation or communication system. Consequently, Bluetooth, for example, currently is exempt from restrictions on wireless emitters inside the cabin [12]. Intentional emitters can be allowed aboard aircraft according to RTCA/DO 233 recommendations if their safe use is demonstrated [13]. For A 340 - 600 the safe use and compatibility of WLAN has been demonstrated in the aircraft environment at a power level artificially increased 250 times. Bluetooth has been investigated by Intel [14]. Lufthansa already provides a certified wireless service in the cabin in combination with portable electronic devices. During tests conducted thus far, even nonessential systems such as in-flight entertainment that are qualified to low susceptibility levels have not been observed to be disturbed [1]. From a technical point of view there is no general objection to the use of these services.|$|R

Class sizes have been uniformly quite small, with recent classes having about twenty students. The school is a component of the 412th Test Wing of the Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC).|$|R
40|$|The {{aviation}} industry needs {{to assure the}} reliable operation of aircrafts. While this reliability has many aspects, this talk focused on the aspect of information technology for the electronic on- and off-board equipment. Modern architectures of avionics, the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>systems,</b> are driven by denser integration into embedded platforms and the interconnection of these systems to each other. In addition, the aircraft's ecosystem demands new connectivity solutions for several stakeholders, e. g. passengers, airlines or air traffic management. This trend of transferring the previously closed, federated systems into interconnected Integrated Modular Avionics offering additional services introduces the potential risk of threads and increased attack surfaces allowing intruders to harm {{the operation of the}} aircraft. To counter these threats is challenge for the {{aviation industry}} that needs new system design approaches. The concept of Multiple Independent Levels of Security (MILS) can provide such a system design for equipment operating in high-assurance environments. Due to its properties of separation and controlled information flow, MILS is a promising design approach for the secure integration of several systems into one hardware platform. While this idea has been part of research for the last decades, MILS can also be used as software design concept for one embedded system. This approach divides the system under development into several sub-functions that can be implemented and executed inside isolated runtime compartments. Information flows between these compartments are mediated by the MILS platform. This divide-and-conquer approach decouples critical code from less critical code, limits the perimeters of the internal software dependencies and allows a localized verification of sub-functions. This paper presents the general security environment to develop and operate avionics, explains the introduced MILS software design approach in more detail, provides the identified advantages and disadvantages using this concept, and discusses the results of a feasibility study using a common avionic high-assurance system to control the information exchange on security domain borders...|$|R
