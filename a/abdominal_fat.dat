25|$|Recent {{findings}} suggest that PLSCR3 and, to a lesser degree, PLSCR1 are critical to the normal regulation of fat accumulation in mice. In addition to blood cells, PLSCR3 is expressed to a significantly higher level in fat and muscle cells, which are actively involved in fat metabolism. PLSCR3 knockout mice showed an aberrant <b>abdominal</b> <b>fat</b> accumulation, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and dyslipidema as compared to controlled mice. Cultured fat cells from PLSCR3 knockout mice were engorged with neutral lipids. Blood plasma of these mice showed elevated levels of non-high-density lipoproteins, cholesterol, triglycerides, non-esterified fatty acids, and leptin, but low adiponectin content. <b>Abdominal</b> <b>fat</b> accumulation {{with the formation of}} enlarged lipid engorged adipocytes has emerged as the key risk factor for the onset of type 2 diabetes, which is often a manifestation of a broader underlying metabolic disorder termed as metabolic syndrome. Further studies on the regulation of lipid metabolism by PLSCRs are required to understand the risk for development of similar diseases in humans when PLSCR genes are mutated, leading to a defective expression and/or function of PLSCR proteins.|$|E

25|$|The EPIC-PANACEA study, {{published}} in 2010 in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition closely tracked 373,803 people {{over a period}} of 8 years across 10 countries. It concluded that meat consumption is positively associated with weight gain in men and women. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association countered by stating that meat consumption may not be associated with fat gain. In response, the authors of the original study controlled for just <b>abdominal</b> <b>fat</b> across a sample of 91,214 people and found that even when controlling for calories and lifestyle factors, meat consumption is linked with obesity. Additional studies and reviews have confirmed the finding that greater meat consumption is positively linked with greater weight gain even when controlling for calories, and lifestyle factors.|$|E
25|$|Fat {{cells have}} an {{important}} physiological role in maintaining triglyceride and free fatty acid levels, as well as determining insulin resistance. <b>Abdominal</b> <b>fat</b> has a different metabolic profile—being more prone to induce insulin resistance. This explains {{to a large degree}} why central obesity is a marker of impaired glucose tolerance and is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (even in the absence of diabetes mellitus and hypertension). Studies of female monkeys at Wake Forest University (2009) discovered that individuals suffering from higher stress have higher levels of visceral fat in their bodies. This suggests a possible cause-and-effect link between the two, wherein stress promotes the accumulation of visceral fat, which in turn causes hormonal and metabolic changes that contribute to heart disease and other health problems.|$|E
25|$|Post-test probability, as {{estimated}} {{from the}} pre-test probability with likelihood ratio, should be handled with caution in individuals with other determinants (such as risk factors) {{than the general}} population, {{as well as in}} individuals that have undergone previous tests, because such determinants or tests may also influence the test itself in unpredictive ways, still causing inaccurate results. An example with the risk factor of obesity is that additional <b>abdominal</b> <b>fat</b> can make it difficult to palpate abdominal organs and decrease the resolution of abdominal ultrasonography, and similarly, remnant barium contrast from a previous radiography can interfere with subsequent abdominal examinations, in effect decreasing the sensitivities and specificities of such subsequent tests. On the other hand, the effect of interference can potentially improve the efficacy of subsequent tests as compared to usage in the reference group, such as some abdominal examinations being easier when performed on underweight people.|$|E
40|$|Leptin is an adipocytokine {{that has}} an {{important}} role in energy homeostasis and therefore in the pathophysiology of obesity. Leptin levels are influenced by many factors such as gender, race, energy intake, fat mass, etc. The aim of our study is to investigate the relationship of circulating leptin levels to anthropometric parameters and to the subcutaneous and visceral fat tissue determined by ultrasonography in healthy overweight and obese women. The study included 50 healthy women, with body mass index (BMI) above 25 kg/m 2. Measurements of anthropometric parameters were performed with a standardized technique. The subcutaneous and visceral fat tissue was measured with ultrasound 1 cm above the umbilicus. Leptin was determined by radioimmunoassay. The serum leptin levels presented a positive correlation between the levels of leptin and BMI (r- 0. 73, p < 0. 05) waist circumference (r- 0. 73, p < 0. 05) hip circumference (r- 0. 74, p < 0. 05), thigh circumference (r- 0. 56, p < 0. 05) and <b>abdominal</b> subcutaneous <b>fat</b> tissue (r- 0. 46, p < 0. 05). There was no correlation between leptin and visceral fat tissue, waist to hip and waist to thigh ratio. The results of our study confirmed the correlation between leptin and BMI. The correlation between leptin and all measured circumferences cannot be attributed to a particular fat depot, but rather reflect the correlation between this adipocytokine and the total body fat. The subcutaneous fat depot determined by ultrasound showed a correlation with leptin, while this kind of connection was not established for the visceral fat tissue.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{evaluate}} {{the association between}} visceral fat and cardiovascular risk factors and to compare the ultrasonographic measurements of <b>abdominal</b> visceral <b>fat</b> with <b>abdominal</b> circumference (AC). MethodsThis observational cross-sectional study categorized pubertal and postpubertal adolescents into a control group (n = 49) and an obese group (n = 46). Weight, height, AC, blood pressure, biochemical tests (lipid profile, triacylglycerols, fasting glucose for insulinemia, and serum uric acid), and ultrasound to measure visceral fat were assessed. ResultsWe found {{significant differences in the}} vascular risk variables between the groups, except for total cholesterol and fasting blood glucose level. We also observed that 31 subjects in the control group presented abnormalities in cardiovascular risk factors. The correlations between <b>abdominal</b> visceral <b>fat</b> (measured by ultrasound or the AC) and cardiovascular risk factors were significant. In the entire sample, AC presented better sensitivity and specificity than the ultrasound-measured <b>abdominal</b> visceral <b>fat</b> for identifying the presence of a cluster of at least three cardiovascular risk factors (areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve 0. 87 and 0. 73, respectively).

2500|$|An {{excess of}} visceral fat {{is known as}} central obesity, or [...] "belly fat", in which the abdomen {{protrudes}} excessively.

2500|$|Visceral fat or <b>{{abdominal}}</b> <b>fat</b> (also {{known as}} organ fat or intra-abdominal fat) is located inside the abdominal cavity, packed between the organs (stomach, liver, intestines, kidneys, etc.).

Fat in the lower body, as in thighs and buttocks, is subcutaneous and is not consistently spaced tissue, whereas fat in the abdomen is mostly visceral and semi-fluid. Visceral fat is composed of several adipose depots, including mesenteric, epididymal white adipose tissue (EWAT), and perirenal depots.
