5|$|After the war, the British and French {{intervened in}} the Russian Civil War; this {{included}} a major naval deployment to the Baltic Sea, which included Waldeck-Rousseau. Shortly after arriving, her crew mutinied due to poor living conditions <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> {{to return to}} France. The unrest was quickly suppressed, and Waldeck-Rousseau joined the effort to support the Whites against the Red Bolsheviks. In May 1929, the ship was sent to French Indochina {{to serve as the}} flagship of the Far East squadron. She remained there until May 1932, when she returned to France, where she was decommissioned and hulked. Waldeck-Rousseau was ultimately scrapped in 194144.|$|E

5|$|Grunge fuses {{elements}} of punk rock and heavy metal, {{such as the}} distorted electric guitar used in both genres, although some bands performed with more emphasis on one or the other. Like these genres, grunge typically uses electric guitar, bass guitar, a drummer and a singer. Grunge also incorporates influences from indie rock bands such as Sonic Youth. Lyrics are typically angst-filled and introspective, often addressing themes such as social alienation, apathy, concerns about confinement, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> for freedom.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{based on}} {{software}} reliability growth models with generalized logistic testing-effort function, we study three optimal resource allocation problems in modular software systems during testing phase: 1) minimization {{of the remaining}} faults when a fixed amount of testing-effort <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>desired</b> reliability objective are given, 2) minimization of the required amount of testing-effort when a specific number of remaining faults <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>desired</b> reliability objective are given, and 3) minimization of the cost {{when the number of}} remaining faults <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>desired</b> reliability objective are given. Several useful optimization algorithms based on the Lagrange multiplier method are proposed and numerical examples are illustrated. Our methodologies provide practical approaches to the optimization of testing-resource allocation with a reliability objective. In addition, we also introduce the testing-resource control problem and compare different resource allocation methods. Finally, we demonstrate how these analytical approaches can be employed in the integration testing. Using the proposed algorithms, project managers can allocate limited testing-resource easily and efficiently and thus achieve the highest reliability objective during software module and integration testing. 1...|$|R

Rare Replay released worldwide as an Xbox One exclusive on August 4, 2015.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the Fusō-class battleships was shaped both by the ongoing {{international}} naval arms race <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> among Japanese naval planners to maintain a fleet of capital ships powerful enough to defeat the United States Navy in an encounter in Japanese territorial waters. The IJN's fleet of battleships had proven highly successful in 1905, {{the last year of}} the Russo-Japanese War, which culminated in the destruction of the Russian Second and Third Pacific Squadrons at the Battle of Tsushima.|$|E
5|$|Thus, {{the route}} chosen {{was a direct}} line between Saugus and Gorman, {{over the top of}} the ridge for many miles. Due to cost and {{drainage}} concerns, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> to reduce altering the terrain, the road was built with 697curves, high in the mountains. Construction on the Ridge Route, officially considered to run from Castaic Junction (west of Saugus on the road to Ventura) to the bottom of the grade at Grapevine, began in 1914. The highway was one of the earliest projects completed by the California Highway Commission. To construct the road, horse-drawn scrapers were used.|$|E

5|$|When fit, Gibbs {{had been}} Watford's first choice right-back since 1985, with the {{exception}} of 1994–95, where Gerard Lavin's form kept a recovering Gibbs in the reserves. A combination of Gibbs' age, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> to acquire more strength in depth for the Premier League, prompted Taylor to sign right-backs Des Lyttle and Neil Cox in 1999. Despite the competition, Gibbs managed to make 20 appearances in 1999–2000, and his Premier League experience included victories over Chelsea, Coventry City and Southampton, although these were not enough to prevent relegation back to the First Division.|$|E
5|$|While {{the route}} to the falls from Eagle on the Hill was on public land, the {{alternative}} route along the gully was through private properties.

5|$|After touring Who's Next, and needing time {{to write}} a follow-up, Townshend insisted that the Who take a lengthy break, as they had not stopped touring since the band started. There was no group {{activity}} until May 1972, when they started working on a proposed new album, Rock Is Dead—Long Live Rock!, but, unhappy with the recordings, abandoned the sessions. Tensions began to emerge as Townshend believed Daltrey just wanted a money-making band and Daltrey thought Townshend's projects were getting pretentious. Moon's behaviour was becoming increasingly destructive and problematic through excessive drinking and drugs use, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> to party and tour. Daltrey performed an audit of the group's finances and discovered that Lambert and Stamp had not kept sufficient records. He believed them to be no longer effective managers, which Townshend and Moon disputed. The painful dissolution of the managerial and personal relationships are recounted in James D. Cooper's 2014 retrospective documentary, Lambert & Stamp. Following a short European tour, the remainder of 1972 was spent working on an orchestral version of Tommy with Lou Reizner.|$|E

5|$|During {{his time}} at Cambridge Vaughan Williams {{continued}} his weekly lessons with Parry, and studied composition with Charles Wood and organ with Alan Gray. He graduated as Bachelor of Music in 1894 and Bachelor of Arts the following year. After leaving the university he returned to complete his training at the RCM. Parry had by then succeeded Sir George Grove {{as director of the}} college, and Vaughan Williams's new professor of composition was Charles Villiers Stanford. Relations between teacher and student were stormy. Stanford, who had been adventurous in his younger days, had grown deeply conservative; he clashed vigorously with his modern-minded pupil. Vaughan Williams had no wish to follow in the traditions of Stanford's idols, Brahms and Wagner, and he stood up to his teacher as few students dared to do. Beneath Stanford's bluster lay a recognition of Vaughan Williams's talent <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> to help the young man correct his opaque orchestration and extreme predilection for modal music.|$|E

He lived in a modest house in Munich. Although Hess had less influence than other top NSDAP officials, he was popular with the masses. After the Invasion of Poland {{and the start of}} World War II in September 1939, Hitler made Hess second in line to succeed him, after Hermann Göring. Around the same time, Hitler appointed Hess's chief of staff, Martin Bormann, as his personal secretary, a post formerly held by Hess.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Himmler {{founded the}} first SS {{business}} venture, Nordland-Verlag, a publishing house that released propaganda material and SS training manuals. Thereafter, he purchased Allach Porcelain, which {{then began to}} produce SS memorabilia. Because of the labor shortage <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> for financial gain, the SS started exploiting concentration camp inmates as slave labor. Most of the SS businesses lost money until Himmler placed them under the administration of Pohl's Verwaltung und Wirtschaftshauptamt Hauptamt (Administration and Business office; VuWHA) in 1939. Even then, most of the enterprises were poorly run and did not fare well, as SS men were not selected for their business experience, and the workers were starving. In July 1940 Pohl established the Deutsche Wirtschaftsbetriebe GmbH (German Businesses Ltd; DWB), an umbrella corporation under which he took over administration of all SS business concerns. Eventually the SS founded nearly 200 holding companies for their businesses.|$|E
