Alterations of scattered light intensity, correlated with an operator's in-tention, can exceed by factors of 10 to 1000 the statistical variances observed before or <b>after</b> <b>operator</b> interaction. Such effects have been demonstrated by several operators, and appear to be operator-specific, although enhanceable by training...|$|E

40|$|Performance, {{dependability}} {{and quality}} of service (QoS) are prime aspects of the UML modeling domain. To capture these aspects effectively in a modeling language requires easy-to-use support for the specification and analysis of randomly varying behaviors. This paper introduces an extension of UML statecharts with randomly varying durations, by enriching a specific syntactic construct: The <b>after</b> <b>operator</b> is equipped with (discrete or continuous) probability distributions, determining {{the duration of the}} delay caused by this operator. The semantics of this extension is given in terms of a variant of stochastic automata. It is shown how existing model-checking tools can be used to calculate model-inherent QoS characteristics automatically. We study a UML model of an automatic teller machine scenario using this approach...|$|E
40|$|Operational {{prediction}} {{of the marine}} environment is recognised as a fundamental research issue for Europe. We present a pre-operational implementation of a biogeochemical model for pelagic waters of the Mediterranean Sea, as developed {{within the framework of}} the MERSEA-IP European project. The OPATM-BFM coupled model is the core of a fully automatic system that weekly delivers analysis and forecast maps for the Mediterranean Sea biogeochemistry. The system in the present configuration has been working since April 2007 with successful execution of the fully automatic operational chain in the 87 % of the cases, and in the remaining cases the runs were successfully accomplished <b>after</b> <b>operator</b> intervention. A description of the system developed and a comparison of the model results with satellite data are also presented, with Spearman correlation on surface chlorophyll temporal evolution equal to 0. 71. Future studies will be addressed to the implementations of a data assimilation scheme for the biogeochemical compartment in order to increase the skill of the model performances...|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss the}} mass-deformed N = 4 SU(N) supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (also {{known as the}} N = 1 ∗ theory). We analyze how the {{correlation}} functions of this theory transform under S-duality, and which correlation functions depend holomorphically on the complexified gauge coupling τ. We provide exact modular-covariant expressions for the vacuum expectation values of chiral operators in the massive vacua of the N = 1 ∗ theory. We exhibit a novel modular symmetry of the chiral sector of the theory in each vacuum, which acts on the coupling ˜τ = (pτ + k) /q, where p, k and q are integers which label the different vacua. In the strong coupling limit, we compare our results {{to the results of}} Polchinski and Strassler in the string theory dual of this theory, and find non-trivial agreement <b>after</b> <b>operator</b> mixings are taken into account. In particular we find that their results are consistent with the predicted modular symmetry in ˜τ. Our results imply that certain singularities found in solutions to five dimensional gauged supergravity should not be resolvable in string theory, since there are no field theory vacua with corresponding vacuum expectation values in the large N limit...|$|E

50|$|Spark gap {{transmitters}} generate fairly broad-band signals. As {{the more}} efficient transmission mode of continuous waves (CW) became easier {{to produce and}} band crowding and interference worsened, spark-gap transmitters and damped waves were legislated off the new shorter wavelengths by international treaty, and replaced by Poulsen arc converters and high frequency alternators, which developed a sharply defined transmitter frequency. These approaches later yielded to vacuum tube technology and the 'electric age' of radio ended. Long <b>after</b> <b>operators</b> no longer used spark gap transmitters for communications, the military used them for radio jamming. As late as 1955, a Japanese radio-controlled toy bus used a spark transmitter and coherer receiver; the spark was visible behind a sheet of blue transparent plastic.|$|R

In response, a cenotaph gravestone was erected at a nearby empty grave, to deter disrespectful visitors, leaving his actual final resting place without a marker. Another John Belushi cenotaph gravestone was erected by his family in a Chicago area cemetery, at the Belushi family plot, where his parents are now buried. Similarly, when H. P. Lovecraft's headstone in Providence, Rhode Island was stolen, a replacement marker was erected in a different location.|$|R
