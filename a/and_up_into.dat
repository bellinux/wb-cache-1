He broke the Vietminh blockade around Saigon, then drove through the Mekong delta <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>into</b> the highlands. This was possible because Ho feared Chinese domination far more than French colonialism, which he perceived to be in decline. Ho's first priority was {{getting rid of the}} Chinese, and for this he needed French help. Leclerc quickly perceived the necessity for a political solution to the conflict.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{range of}} any species {{is that of}} the rock dove. This species had a large natural {{distribution}} from Britain and Ireland to northern Africa, across Europe, Arabia, Central Asia, India, the Himalayas <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>into</b> China and Mongolia. The range of the species increased dramatically upon domestication, as the species went feral in cities around the world. The species is currently resident across most of North America, and has established itself in cities and urban areas in South America, sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. The species is not the only pigeon to have increased its range due to the actions of man; several other species have become established outside of their natural range after escaping captivity, and other species have increased their natural ranges due to habitat changes caused by human activity.|$|E

25|$|Rotting {{food and}} other {{decaying}} organic waste allows methane and carbon dioxide to seep {{out of the ground}} <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>into</b> the air. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and can itself be a danger because it is flammable and potentially explosive. In properly managed landfills, gas is collected and utilized. This could range from simple flaring to landfill gas utilization. Carbon dioxide is the most widely produced greenhouse gas. It traps heat in the atmosphere, contributing to climate change.|$|E

The southern Muisca settlements and their treasures quickly fell to the conquistadors in 1537 and 1538. On the Bogotá savanna, the Spanish received reports about El Dorado from captured natives, and of the initiation rite of the new zipa, which used {{to take place in}} Lake Guatavita. The Spanish captured large amounts of gold from the Muisca, which led them to spread the word that El Dorado was near.|$|E

In Belgium, Having qualified 16th <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>into</b> 11th by the fifth lap, he collided with Justin Wilson's Astromega car going into Eau Rouge. Yoong lost control and hurtled left side first into the tyre barrier at 260kph with an impact of around 6.5G. He was knocked unconscious for 20 minutes. He was treated by Sid Watkins and the FIA medical team on the scene. They discovered that Yoong's helmet was badly damaged but was still intact. After 10 minutes, he was freed and taken to the track medical centre before he was taken by helicopter to the Leige hospital to for a compete body and brain scan. Yoong was cleared by doctors of any neurological or spinal injuries but was kept for observation. Yoong managed to attend the race at Misano but needing crutches to walk and declared himself 80% fit and qualified ninth and finished in the same place.|$|E
500|$|The tunnel {{was about}} 3feet (1m) high by 3feet (1m) wide. Lighting {{in the tunnel}} was {{provided}} by makeshift candles. The prisoners used improvised digging tools and shovels that were constructed from British biscuit cans and their handles made from the wooden slats of their beds. The tins were also {{used to create a}} pipe for fresh air to funnel through the tunnel with the assistance of a hand-cranked fan at the entrance of the tunnel. A sled, made of wooden slats with a tine base to make it slide easily over the earthen tunnel floor, was used to haul the sandbags. Juskalian described the method that was used to dispose the sand: [...] "The method used to conceal the sand was ingenious. The sand was poured into burlap bags made surreptitiously from Red Cross parcel wrappings then passed rapidly along a makeshift fire brigade line through the building <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>into</b> the attic. There it was dumped between the outer and inner walls where there was a wide space for insulation. Literally tons of sand could be disposed of there before the space would be filled." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ceratopsians, or [...] "horn-faced dinosaurs", {{differ from}} pachycephalosaurs in the {{presence}} of a rostral bone, or beak. They are also known for having a jugal horn and a thin parietal-squamosal shelf that extends back <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>into</b> a frill. This frill could have been used for anchoring jaw muscles, as well as for display or protective purposes. The horns were likely used for establishing dominance or defending territories. One of the earliest members of this group is Psittacosaurus, which is one of the most species-rich dinosaur genera from Asia. Ceratopsians later evolved into very large quadrupeds with elaborate facial horns such as Triceratops and Centrosaurus. There was no change in richness of species throughout the Cretaceous before the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction.|$|E
2500|$|The {{smallmouth bass}} (Micropterus dolomieu) is {{a species of}} {{freshwater}} fish in the sunfish family (Centrarchidae) of the order Perciformes. [...] It is the type species of its genus. [...] One of the black basses, it is a popular game fish sought by anglers throughout the temperate zones of North America, and has been spread by stocking—as well as illegal introductions—to many cool-water tributaries and lakes in Canada and more so introduced in the United States. The maximum recorded size is approximately 27 inches and 12 pounds. [...] The smallmouth bass is native to the upper and middle Mississippi River basin, the Saint Lawrence RiverGreat Lakes system, <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>into</b> the Hudson Bay basin. Its common names include smallmouth, bronzeback, brown bass, brownie, smallie, bronze bass, and bareback bass.|$|E

Other warlords could be found in the British Isles during the Middle Ages <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>into</b> the Early Modern period; such examples include Brian Boru of Ireland and Guthrum of the Danelaw, who was the commander of the Great Heathen Army and nearly conquered all of England, Alfred of Anglo-Saxon England, first man to unify the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Europe, although it would not be completed until Edward the Elder's reign, in which he conquered the last remnants of the Danelaw. William the Conqueror could also classify as a warlord, because he forged an empire out of nothing, conquering England.|$|E

2500|$|At 12:20 Evstafi, with a {{clear view}} of the Ottomans, opened fire on Yavuz, {{striking}} and disabling the third starboard [...] casemated gun with its first salvo. The Russian battleships were using a new form of fire control that had been devised in the aftermath of the Russo-Japanese War, with Ioann Zlatoust directing for all other ships except Rostislav, which had a different main armament. The 12-inch shell had passed through the casemate armour and barely penetrated a 150mm plate before detonating. Splinters badly damaged the ship's torpedo net. It also detonated three [...] high explosive shells and set 16 cartridges on fire. The resulting explosion tore a square meter-sized hole in the side of the ship and killed the gun's crew. The flash fire traveled down the munitions elevator <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>into</b> the fourth starboard casemate, which was temporarily abandoned.|$|E
2500|$|Low-frequency {{conductive}} {{hearing loss}} is present in many patients with SCDS and is explained by the dehiscence acting as a [...] "third window." [...] Vibrations entering the ear canal and middle ear are then abnormally diverted through the superior semicircular canal <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>into</b> the intracranial space where they become absorbed instead of being registered as sound in the hearing center, the cochlea. Due to the difference in resistance between the normal round window and the pathological dehiscence window this hearing loss is more serious in the lower frequencies and may initially be mistaken for otosclerosis. [...] In some patients there is true enhancement of low frequency hearing via bone conducted sound. [...] A clinical sign of this phenomenon {{is the ability of}} the patient to hear (not feel) a tuning fork placed upon the ankle bone.|$|E

2500|$|The {{particular}} {{characteristics of}} the Chinese writing system {{played an important role}} in Chinese poetry. In fact, a continuous poetic tradition in China was enabled in part by the fact that Chinese words can be represented by their corresponding Chinese characters semi-independently of their pronunciation (which extends even to their use in classical versions of Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese). The pronunciations of spoken Chinese changed quite a bit over the course of time from the oldest surviving written Chinese poetry (in Old Chinese), through the Middle Chinese period (which included the Tang Dynasty), <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>into</b> the Modern Chinese period. During this course of development, Classical Chinese evolved as a distinct literary language, distinct from the spoken vernacular. The tension between a spoken vernacular and a literary form of the language worked both ways, the poetry of literature can be seen to have [...] "various degrees of vernacular overlay" [...] and also the oral folk poetry sometimes were [...] "filled with literary phrases and constructions", perhaps due to the prestigious nature of the written language.|$|E
2500|$|On April 15 President Lincoln issued {{his first}} proclamation, calling out 75,000 troops in {{response}} to the Confederate bombardment of Fort Sumter. On April 17 Davis issued a proclamation, offering a letter of marque to anyone who would offer their ship {{in the service of the}} Confederacy. [...] To this end British investors were the most prolific in offering such aid. The North refused to recognize the sovereignty of the Confederacy along with its right to issue letters of marque and two days later, on April 19, Lincoln issued a second proclamation, threatening the Confederacy with a blockade along its coastlines as part of Scott's Anaconda plan extending along the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico coastlines <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>into</b> the lower Mississippi River. Lincoln's proclamation also contained a threat that any actions against the Union by crews of ships acting under a Confederate letter of marque would be treated as piracy subject to prosecution, which usually called for the death penalty.
