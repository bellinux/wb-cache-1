25|$|Throughout the years, several {{attempts}} have been made to reduce traffic congestion on Jakarta's main arteries. Implemented solutions include a 'three-in-one' rush-hour law, during which cars with fewer than three passengers are prohibited from driving on the main avenues. Another example is the ban on trucks passing main avenues during the day. In 2016, 'odd-even' policy was introduced which designated cars with either odd or even-numbered registration plates on a particular day. This aims to function <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>transitional</b> <b>measure</b> to alleviate traffic congestion until the future introduction of Electronic Road Pricing which would be more effective.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>transitional</b> <b>measure,</b> for {{the first}} three years after the {{election}} of the first President of Ireland a bill to amend the Constitution could be passed by the Oireachtas as an ordinary act. An amendment bill before the election of the first President (on 25 June 1938) would have required a referendum. To prevent the Oireachtas abusing this provision, the President had the power to refer such a bill to the people. The First and Second Amendments were adopted in this way; President Douglas Hyde chose to sign each into law without referendum. The three-year limit was entrenched to prevent it being extended without referendum. Since 25 June 1941, the third anniversary of President Hyde's election, every amendment has had to follow the pattern of passage through the Oireachtas followed by a referendum.|$|E
500|$|The {{ninth and}} last {{section of the}} Constitution was added {{following}} passage of the 1996 revision of Constitution and addresses laws passed before 1996. If the laws that were passed before {{the adoption of the}} Constitution are not in conflict with the Constitution, they are still enforced. All changes to the Constitution come into effect when formally issued by the president, unless specified otherwise. With the passage of the 1996 revision of the Constitution, the 1994 law [...] "On the Procedure Governing the Entry into Force of the Constitution of the Republic of Belarus" [...] ceased to be enforced. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>transitional</b> <b>measure,</b> Section Nine states that the present (as of November 1996) leadership of Belarus can continue to serve until their term of service has been completed. When the Constitution is enforced, the national government is allowed to exercise their assigned duties. Unless otherwise stated in Article 143, Part 3, the national leadership must form state governmental bodies two months after the Constitution goes into effect.|$|E
25|$|Brussels {{was limited}} to the current 19 municipalities. Many French-speakers complained that this did not {{correspond}} to the social reality, since the language border was {{based on the results of}} the 1947 language census and not that of 1960. French-speaking sources claim that in that year, French-speaking minorities had surpassed the 30% threshold in Alsemberg, Beersel, Sint-Pieters-Leeuw, Dilbeek, Strombeek-Bever, Sterrebeek, and Sint-Stevens-Woluwe, in which case French-language facilities should have been established under previous legislation. A political rift developed because French-speakers considered the language facilities <b>as</b> <b>an</b> essential right, while the Flemings saw the facilities <b>as</b> <b>a</b> temporary, <b>transitional</b> <b>measure</b> to allow the French-speaking minorities time to adapt to their Flemish surroundings.|$|R
5000|$|The {{magazine}} [...] "Вестник работников искусств" [...] ("Herald of Art Workers") {{played an}} important role in the preparations for the Third All-Russian Congress of Vserabis. The Congress convened between 2 and 8 October 1921. It completed the first phase of the institutional development of the union; 665 departments of Vserabis already worked actively in the country, 183 delegates came to the Third Congress with casting votes, and 83 delegates had advisory votes. The Congress made a number of changes in the Statute of the Union. If the Statute of 1918 fixed the section <b>as</b> <b>a</b> temporary <b>transitional</b> <b>measure,</b> the Statute of 1920 secured their existence completely, significantly expanding rights. In order to fully perform and better serve the specific interests and peculiarities of everyday life of certain categories of workers, the Statute of 1920 established the existence of the following sections: artists (drama, opera, operetta, ballet, circus, music), musicians, workers of visual arts, workers of cinema and photo, workers of literature, workers and servants of the theater.|$|R
