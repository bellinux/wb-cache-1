25|$|Since Green {{narrowly}} {{lost the}} election citywide, Staten Island provided {{the margin of}} Bloomberg's victory. The main political divide in the borough is demarcated by the Staten Island Expressway; areas north of the Expressway {{tend to be more}} liberal while the south tends to be more conservative. Local party platforms center on affordable housing, education and law and order. Two out of Staten Island's three New York City Council members <b>are</b> <b>Republicans,</b> including conservative commentator Joe Borelli.|$|E

25|$|The Democratic Party {{holds the}} {{majority}} of public offices. As of April 2016, 69% of registered voters in the city are Democrats and 10% <b>are</b> <b>Republicans.</b> New York City has not been carried by a Republican in a statewide or presidential election since President Calvin Coolidge won the five boroughs in 1924. In 2012, Democrat Barack Obama became the first presidential candidate of any party to receive more than 80% of the overall vote in New York City, sweeping all five boroughs. Party platforms center on affordable housing, education, and economic development, and labor politics are of importance in the city.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the Obama sweep in 2008, many Democratic {{candidates}} in contests for lower-level offices also benefited, and many Republican incumbents were replaced by Democrats in the Harris County courthouse. Some of the defeated Republican district court judges were later re-appointed to vacant District Court benches by Governor Rick Perry. Republicans continue to hold all statewide offices after the 2014 elections, including all nine slots on each of the two high courts, but Harris County still has a mix of Democratic and Republican district court judges. All members of the two courts of appeals in the old Harris County Courthouse, by contrast, <b>are</b> <b>Republicans.</b> They are elected from an appellate district that includes Harris County, but also includes nine other counties that are more conservative and vote more Republican. Any generalizations about political leanings and voting patterns of the local electorate must take into consideration the geographic area/jurisdiction, and the same goes for public-opinion polls. Whether elections for local offices coincide with presidential elections or midterm elections also matters because turnout and composition of the voting segment of the electorate differ. The City of Houston, which overlaps with Harris County in part, but represents a smaller and more urban area and electorate, is even more liberal. That is why the city can elect a mayor who is not only a Democrat, but openly gay. (Mayoral elections are nominally nonpartisan).|$|E

2500|$|Although Democrats {{have made}} inroads in the {{northern}} end of the county since the mid-1980s, Orange County politics are still dominated by Republicans.

2500|$|With {{immigrant}} Catholics increasingly {{allied with}} the Democratic Party, most anti-Catholicism {{was found in the}} Republican Party typified by the statement of Rev. Samuel D.

[...] House NPP Leader Jenniffer González and Senate Minority Leader Larry Seilhamer <b>are</b> <b>Republicans.</b>|$|E
2500|$|New Hampshire's {{status as}} {{the first in the}} nation is {{somewhat}} controversial among Democrats because the ethnic makeup of the state is not diverse and not representative of the country's voters. This is shown in the 2010 Census data, with the percentage of minority residents being nearly five times smaller than the national average (New Hampshire is 92% non-Hispanic white, versus 64% nationally). Politically however, the state does offer a wide sampling of different types of voters. Although it is a New England state, it is not as liberal as some of its neighbors. For example, according to one exit poll, of those who participated in the 2004 Democratic primary, 4-in-10 voters were independents, and just over 50% said they considered themselves [...] "liberal". Additionally, as of 2002, 25.6% of New Hampshire residents are registered Democrats and 36.7% <b>are</b> <b>Republicans,</b> with 37.7% of New Hampshire voters registered as [...] "undeclared" [...] independents. Also, New Hampshire was the only state in the Northeast to vote for George W. Bush in 2000. This plurality of independents is a major reason why New Hampshire is considered a swing state in general U.S. presidential elections.|$|E
2500|$|A {{relatively}} new element of conservatism is the Tea Party movement of 2009–present, a populist grassroots movement comprising over 600 local units who communally express {{dissatisfaction with the}} government and both major parties. Many units have promoted activism and protests. The stated purpose of the movement is to stop what it views as wasteful government spending, excessive taxation, and strangulation of the economy through regulatory bureaucracies. The Tea Party attracted national attention when it propelled Republican Scott Brown to a victory in the Senate election for the Massachusetts seat held by the Kennedy brothers for nearly 60 years. In 2010 Tea Party candidates upset establishment Republicans in several primaries, such as Alaska, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Nevada, New York, South Carolina, and Utah, giving a new momentum to the conservative cause in the 2010 elections, and boosting Sarah Palin's visibility. Rasmussen and Schoen (2010) conclude that [...] "She is the symbolic leader of the movement, and more than anyone else has helped to shape it." [...] In the fall 2010 elections, the New York Times identified 129 House candidates with significant Tea Party support, as well as 9 running for the Senate; all <b>are</b> <b>Republicans,</b> as the Tea Party has not been active among Democrats.|$|E
