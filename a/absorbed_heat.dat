5|$|The {{standard}} {{method of cooling}} is passing a coolant (usually water) {{through a series of}} holes drilled through the mould plates and connected by hoses to form a continuous pathway. The coolant absorbs heat from the mould (which has <b>absorbed</b> <b>heat</b> from the hot plastic) and keeps the mould at a proper temperature to solidify the plastic at the most efficient rate.|$|E
25|$|Southern Ontario, in {{particular}} Toronto, receives as much summer solar radiation {{as the city}} of Miami, Florida, indicating that Ontario has sufficient solar energy that can be harnessed to generate electricity or heat. Unlike solar energy, geothermal heat pumps (GHP) produce heat energy that is mainly used for space and hot water heating. GHPs operate like refrigerators to transfer <b>absorbed</b> <b>heat</b> energy from below the frost line (about 1.2m soil depth for Southern Ontario) to connected buildings.|$|E
25|$|A few {{suspension}} refinements {{were made}} for 1964. The front coil springs were changed from constant-rate to progressive or variable-rate and were more tightly wound at the top, while leaf thickness of the rear transverse spring was also altered thus providing a more comfortable ride with no sacrifice in handling. Shock absorbers were reworked toward the same end. The 1964 Corvette arrived with a new standard shock containing within its fluid reservoir a small bag of Freon gas that <b>absorbed</b> <b>heat.</b> Chevy added more sound insulation and revised body and transmission mounts for the 1964 Corvette. It also fitted additional bushings to quiet the shift linkage and placed a new boot around the lever. The result was a more livable car for everyday transportation.|$|E

50|$|The Lorena Stove was {{designed}} with the mistaken belief that rammed earth {{would act as}} insulation; there was a basic misunderstanding {{of the difference between}} mass and insulation. Good insulation resists the passage of heat; thermal mass does the opposite, it <b>absorbs</b> <b>heat.</b> Testing has shown that the rammed earth used in the Lorena stove <b>absorbs</b> <b>heat</b> that should be directed toward cooking.|$|R

25|$|An {{electric}} {{underfloor heating}} system has heating cables {{embedded in the}} floor. Current flows through a conductive heating material, supplied either directly from the line voltage (120 or 240 volts) or at low voltage from a transformer. The heated cables warm the flooring by direct conduction and will switch off once it reaches the temperature set by the floor thermostat. A warmer floor surface radiates heat to colder surrounding surfaces (ceiling, walls, furniture.) which absorb heat and reflects all non <b>absorbed</b> <b>heat</b> to yet other still cooler surfaces. The cycle of radiation, absorption and reflection starts slowly and slows down slowly nearing set point temperatures and ceases to take place once equilibrium is reached all-round. A floor thermostat or a room thermostat or combination controls the floor on/off. In the process of radiant heating {{a thin layer of}} air which is in touch with the warmed surfaces also absorbs some heat and this creates a little convection (air circulation). Contrary to believe people are not heated by this warmed circulating air or convection (convection has a cooling effect) but are heated by the direct radiation of the source and reflection of its surrounds.|$|E

2500|$|Wages {{and working}} {{conditions}} for agricultural workers in Hardin County were poor even {{before the onset of}} the Great Depression. [...] A plentiful supply of Caucasian migrant farm workers kept wages far below those of other counties and states. Working conditions were harsh. Laborers worked on their hands and knees weeding and picking onions. The work day was 10 hours long, with a 15-minute break for lunch and no overtime. There were no toilet facilities or restroom breaks, and water and first aid for injuries or heat exhaustion were not provided. The black earth <b>absorbed</b> <b>heat,</b> and temperatures near the ground could reach 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49°C). Many workers lived in employer-provided housing, and were given an employer-owned milk cow (on loan) to prevent starvation.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{adjacent}} diagram, water pumped {{from the tower}} basin is the cooling water routed through the process coolers and condensers in an industrial facility. [...] The cool water absorbs heat from the hot process streams which need to be cooled or condensed, and the <b>absorbed</b> <b>heat</b> warms the circulating water (C). The warm water returns {{to the top of}} the cooling tower and trickles downward over the fill material inside the tower. [...] As it trickles down, it contacts ambient air rising up through the tower either by natural draft or by forced draft using large fans in the tower. That contact causes a small amount of the water to be lost as windage/drift (W) and some of the water (E) to evaporate. The heat required to evaporate the water is derived from the water itself, which cools the water back to the original basin water temperature and the water is then ready to recirculate. The evaporated water leaves its dissolved salts behind in the bulk of the water which has not been evaporated, thus raising the salt concentration in the circulating cooling water. To prevent the salt concentration of the water from becoming too high, a portion of the water is drawn off/blown down (D) for disposal. Fresh water make-up (M) is supplied to the tower basin to compensate for the loss of evaporated water, the windage loss water and the draw-off water.|$|E

50|$|Expander cycle: Cryogenic fuel (hydrogen, or methane) {{is used to}} {{cool the}} walls of the {{combustion}} chamber and nozzle. <b>Absorbed</b> <b>heat</b> vaporizes and expands the fuel which is then used to drive the turbopumps before it enters the combustion chamber, allowing for high efficiency, or is bled overboard, allowing for higher power turbopumps. The limited heat available to vaporize the fuel constrains engine power. Examples: RL-10 for Atlas V and Delta IV second stages (closed cycle), H-II's LE-5 (bleed cycle).|$|E
50|$|The valve is {{controlled}} by four metal rods enclosed in a glass tube. The central rod that is blackened is surrounded by the three polished rods.

After sunset, the central rod cools down, becoming the same length as the polished rods and opening the gas supply. The gas is lit by the small, always-burning pilot light.|$|E
