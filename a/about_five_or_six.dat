5|$|According {{to current}} knowledge, B.sessilis as an {{extremely}} hardy plant that {{grows in a}} range of soils and aspects, so long as it is given good drainage, and tolerates both drought and moderate frost. Unlike many dryandras, it grows well on limestone (alkaline) soils. It flowers very heavily and is an excellent producer of honey. It attracts birds, and is also popular with beekeepers. However, its size makes it unsuitable for smaller gardens, and if given an ideal situation it may produce a great many seedlings. It is propagated only from seed, as propagating it from cuttings has proven virtually impossible. Germination takes <b>about</b> <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> weeks, and plants may take two years to flower.|$|E
5|$|Wragg {{agreed to}} Teach's demands, and a Mr. Marks and two pirates were given {{two days to}} collect the drugs. Teach moved his fleet, and the {{captured}} ships, to within <b>about</b> <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> leagues from land. Three days later a messenger, sent by Marks, returned to the fleet; Marks's boat had capsized and delayed their arrival in Charles Town. Teach granted a reprieve of two days, but still the party did not return. He then called a meeting of his fellow sailors and moved eight ships into the harbour, causing panic within the town. When Marks finally returned to the fleet, he explained what had happened. On his arrival he had presented the pirates' demands to the Governor and the drugs had been quickly gathered, but the two pirates sent to escort him had proved difficult to find; they had been busy drinking with friends and were finally discovered, drunk.|$|E
5|$|According to the saga, {{sometime}} after Haraldr Gille's victory over Magnús Sigurðarson, Earl Rögnvaldr's father, Kolr, sent messengers to Earl Páll, demanding that Earl Páll {{hand over the}} lands which the Norwegian king had granted to Earl Rögnvaldr. When Earl Páll refused this, Kolr's messengers proceeded to Caithness, where Frakökk lived. The messengers related to Frakökk of Kolr's proposal—that if she and Ölvir were to defeat Earl Páll, half of the earldom would be theirs. Frakökk agreed to the plan, saying that she would attack in mid-summer; she promised that during upcoming winter she would gather forces from her kinsmen, friends, and connections in Scotland and the Suðreyjar for the task. The next winter Earl Rögnvaldr {{and two of his}} chiefs, Sölmundr and Jón, gathered a force of men and <b>about</b> <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> ships for their expedition. The following summer their forces sailed from Norway to Shetland, where they were well received by the local bondsmen. Meanwhile, Frakökk and Ölvir assembled a small fleet of twelve ships in the Suðreyjar—although the saga describes the ships as small and poorly manned. At the middle of summer, Frakökk and Ölvir sailed for Orkney to fulfil their pledge of wresting the earldom from Earl Páll.|$|E

60|$|These {{roads were}} for the coaches. Young folks, who never saw {{anything}} nearer approaching to a stage coach than the drags some gentlemen keep, can hardly fancy what these stage coaches were--tall vehicles, holding four inside passengers and at least twelve outside and quantities of luggage. They were drawn by four of the strongest and quickest horses that could be procured, and these were changed <b>about</b> every <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> miles, so as to keep up full speed. The coachman, generally a big, burly man, with a face reddened by exposure to the weather, and often by a glass of ale at every stage, sat on the box in a drab coat, with many capes one over the other. The {{seat next to him}} was the favourite one with the passengers, and gentlemen would sometimes bribe coachmen to let them drive; nay, some gentlemen actually took to the trade themselves. There was also a guard, who in mail coaches took care of the post bags, and dropped them at the places where they were intended for. In the days when highwaymen infested the roads the guard had carried pistols, and still the guard of the mail wore a red coat, and blew a horn on entering any place to warn the people to bring out their post bags and exchange them for others.|$|R

25|$|For {{about four}} months after the {{opposition}} of Jupiter (from L to K in the diagram below), it is possible to view emergences of Io from its eclipses, while for {{about four months}} before the opposition (from F to G), it is possible to view immersions of Io into Jupiter's shadow. For <b>about</b> <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> months of the year, around the point of conjunction, it is impossible to observe the eclipses of Io at all because Jupiter is too close (in the sky) to the sun. Even during the periods before and after opposition, not all of the eclipses of Io can be observed from a given location on the Earth's surface: some eclipses will occur during the daytime for a given location, while other eclipses will occur while Jupiter is below the horizon (hidden by the Earth itself).|$|E
25|$|The area {{includes}} {{a variety of}} landscape formations. Districts close to the Volcanic Plateau are higher and more rugged, often subject to harsh temperatures in winter. The Manawatu District has a much gentler topography, consisting mainly of the flat, tree-studded Manawatu Plains that run between the ranges and the sea. The land was under the sea till about 500,000 years ago and still has a very thick layer of marine sediment, which is <b>about</b> <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> million years old. A block faulting system underneath the thick sediment has raised a series of domes and gentle depressions. These structures can provide natural storage areas for oil {{and some of the}} Manawatu domes have been drilled. The domes have shaped the course of the Manawatu River, giving it a meandering path which, uniquely among New Zealand rivers, begins close to the east coast and exits on the west coast. The Manawatu River begins just inside the Hawke's Bay region, then flows through a deep gorge to the Manawatu Plains before exiting in the Tasman Sea. The river is also unique in New Zealand (and rare worldwide) in that this gorge (the Manawatu Gorge) is a water gap through recently uplifted rock, causing the river to flow from relatively low-lying land along an eroded course through higher terrain. The Whanganui District is more rugged, with canyon-like valleys and gorges carved out of the soft rock by rivers and ocean waves.|$|E
30|$|Tracheary element {{differentiation}} in Pseudostuga menziesii {{was reported}} by Pillai et al. ([2011]). Callus cells were initiated on cambial strips obtained from 4 to 8 year-old trees and cultured on solidified Murashige and Skoog medium (Murashige and Skoog [1962]) supplemented with 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) and benzylaminopurine. Tracheary element formation was induced when calli were subcultured several times on maintenance medium and subsequently transferred to solidified Murashige and Skoog medium (Murashige and Skoog [1962]) supplemented with 4 g L− 1 activated charcoal. The percentage of TEs differentiating after 6 - 7 weeks on solid medium was not reported. Remarkably, approximately 65 % of the callus cells differentiated into TE-like cells provided they were cultured on a liquid {{version of the same}} initiation medium excluding benzylaminopurine for 6 - 7 weeks without subculture. 2, 4 -Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid was the only phytohormone was essential for in vitro TE differentiation of P. menziesii suspension cultured cells.

40|$|Although {{the exact}} {{incidence}} of flatfoot in children is unknown, {{it is very}} common and is, in fact, {{one of the most}} common conditions seen in pediatric orthopedic practices. All children are born with flat feet, and more than 30 % of neonates have a calcaneovalgus deformity of both feet. This condition is not painful and generally resolves without treatment; very rarely is corrective casting necessary. For the pediatrician evaluating flatfoot, it is important to differentiate between flexible and nonflexible (rigid) flatfoot, and to classify the condition as painful or painless. Most children who present to a pediatrician for evaluation of flatfoot will have a flexible flatfoot that does not require treatment. On the other hand, other conditions that do require treatment, such as congenital vertical talus, tarsal coalition, and skew-foot often present as nonflexible flatfoot. Surgical management is rarely indicated for a true flexible flatfoot. The longitudinal arch of the foot is not present at birth and slowly develops during childhood, usually by <b>about</b> age <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six.</b> It is a process that occurs throughout growth and is not affected by the presence or absence of external arch support. Sometimes the arch takes even longer to take shape, but this still usually does not cause any problems. A variety of tendon transfers and reconstructive procedures have been advocated, but none has proved uniformly successful. Nor have any of the various types of supports ever been shown to change the arch architecture. It should be borne in mind that painful flexible flat foot requires treatment, often with several types of shoe inserts and supports and as a last resort by operative procedures. Although parents are often concerned about pediatric flatfoot, the child is usually found to be asymptomatic, and no treatment is indicated. In most instances, the best treatment is simply taking enough time to convince the family that no treatment is necessary...|$|R
40|$|Background: Knowledge of {{the number}} of deaths caused by risk factors is needed for health policy and {{priority}} setting. Our aim was to estimate the mortality effects of the following 12 modifiable dietary, lifestyle, and metabolic risk factors in the United States (US) using consistent and comparable methods: high blood glucose, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and blood pressure; overweight–obesity; high dietary trans fatty acids and salt; low dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids, omega- 3 fatty acids (seafood), and fruits and vegetables; physical inactivity; alcohol use; and tobacco smoking. Methods and Findings: We used data on risk factor exposures in the US population from nationally representative health surveys and disease-specific mortality statistics from the National Center for Health Statistics. We obtained the etiological effects of risk factors on disease-specific mortality, by age, from systematic reviews and meta-analyses of epidemiological studies that had adjusted (i) for major potential confounders, and (ii) where possible for regression dilution bias. We estimated the number of disease-specific deaths attributable to all non-optimal levels of each risk factor exposure, by age and sex. In 2005, tobacco smoking and high blood pressure were responsible for an estimated 467, 000 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 436, 000 – 500, 000) and 395, 000 (372, 000 – 414, 000) deaths, accounting for <b>about</b> one in <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> deaths in US adults.

60|$|Of {{the private}} hotels and private gardens of Paris, a {{stranger}} can scarcely give a just account. Although {{it is now}} six years since I have been acquainted with the place, they occasion surprise daily, by their number, beauty, and magnificence. Relatively, Rome, and Florence, and Venice, and Genoa, may surpass it, in the richness and vastness {{of some of their}} private residences; but, Rome excepted, none of them enjoy such gardens, nor does Rome even, in absolute connection with the town abodes of her nobles. The Roman villas[15] are almost always detached from the palaces, and half of them are without the walls, as I have already described to you. The private gardens of Paris certainly cannot compare with these villas, nor, indeed, can those which belong to the public; but then there is a luxury, and a quiet, and a beauty, <b>about</b> the <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>six</b> acres that are so often enclosed and planted {{in the rear of the}} hotels here, that I do not think any other Christian city can show in equal affluence. The mode of living, which places the house between court and garden, as it is termed here, is justly esteemed the perfection of a town residence; for while it offers security, by means of the gate, and withdraws the building from the street--a desideratum with all above the vulgar--it gives space and room for exercise and beauty, by means of the verdure, shrubbery, trees, and walks. It is no unusual thing for the French to take their repasts, in summer, within the retirement of their gardens, and this in the heart of one of the most populous and crowded towns of Europe. The miserable and minute subdivisions of our own towns preclude the possibility of our ever enjoying a luxury as great, and yet as reasonable as this; and if, by chance, some lucky individual should find the means to embellish his own abode and his neighbourhood, in this way, some speculation, half a league off, would compel him to admit an avenue through his laurels and roses, in order to fill the pockets of a club of projectors. In America, everybody sympathises with him who makes money, for it is a common pursuit, and touches a chord that vibrates through the whole community; but few, indeed, are they who can enter into the pleasures of him who would spend it elegantly, rationally, and with good taste. If this were the result of simplicity, it would, at least, be respectable; but every one knows that the passion at home is for display--finery, at the expense of comfort and fitness, being a prevalent evil.|$|R
50|$|Surviving sources give differing {{accounts}} of the rebellion. Arnulf's principal contribution {{appears to have been}} his participation in a predatory strike into Staffordshire. According to the twelfth-century Historia regum Anglorum and Chronicon ex chronicis, Robert de Bellême and Arnulf, supported by Welsh allies, ravaged a part of the county, before carrying off livestock and men to Wales. The detailed account of the general uprising preserved by Historia ecclesiastica appears to be the most reliable record of events. This source reveals that, following Robert de Bellême's flight from the king's summons, Henry appears to have raised a feudal host consisting of his tenants-in-chief (who owed him knight-service) and the old English fyrd (a levy of one armed man from <b>about</b> every <b>five</b> hides <b>or</b> <b>six</b> carucates). Historia ecclesiastica states that Henry's host besieged the castle of Arundel for three months before it's capitulation, after which the king led his forces to the castle of Tickhill which immediately surrendered. After temporarily standing down his army, Henry resumed operations in the autumn, he is recorded to have seized the castle of Bridgnorth after a three-week siege. At about this point, William Pantulf (died 1112?), a former vassal of the Montgomerys, is stated to have offered his services to Robert de Bellême. Upon being rebuffed by the latter, William Pantulf is recorded to have gone over to Henry's side, and was apparently instrumental in convincing Robert de Bellême's Welsh allies desert him and support the king instead. Brut y Tywysogyon specifically states that Iorwerth ap Bleddyn (died 1111), a leading Welshman, was bought off by the king and began to harry his former ally's lands. After Henry's forces marched to Shrewsbury itself, Historia ecclesiastica records that Robert de Bellême's submitted to the king in person. Defeated, the three surviving sons of Roger de Montgomery were banished from the kingdom, with their lands and titles declared forfeit.|$|R
