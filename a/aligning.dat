40|$|Available online 23 March 2015 [Background]Kinematically <b>aligned</b> total knee {{arthroplasty}} (TKA) is {{of increasing}} interest because this method might improve postoperative patient satisfaction. In kinematic alignment the femoral component is implanted {{in a slightly}} more valgus and internally rotated position, and the tibial component is implanted in a slightly more varus and internally rotated position, than in mechanical alignment. However, the biomechanics of kinematically <b>aligned</b> TKA remain largely unknown. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the kinematics and contact stresses of mechanically and kinematically <b>aligned</b> TKAs. [Methods]A musculoskeletal computer simulation was used to determine the effects of mechanically or kinematically <b>aligned</b> TKA. Knee kinematics were examined for mechanically <b>aligned,</b> kinematically <b>aligned,</b> and kinematically <b>aligned</b> outlier models. Patellofemoral and tibiofemoral contact forces were measured using finite element analysis. [Results]Greater femoral rollback and more external rotation of the femoral component were observed with kinematically <b>aligned</b> TKA than mechanically <b>aligned</b> TKA. However, patellofemoral and tibiofemoral contact stresses were increased in kinematically <b>aligned</b> TKA. [Conclusions]These findings suggest that kinematically <b>aligned</b> TKA produces near-normal knee kinematics, but that concerns for long-term outcome might arise because of high contact stresse...|$|R

5|$|Moving {{south of}} the Gulf of Tehuantepec on October18, the system {{consolidated}} and developed a small, defined circulation. Associated convection became more concentrated around its center. Another gap wind event soon impacted the system, temporarily delaying development of the disturbance into a tropical depression. The low soon relocated to the northeast, <b>aligning</b> itself east of the gap wind event which aided in development. A small, well-defined circulation formed by early on October20 within a broader cyclonic circulation. With increasing deep convection, the system is estimated to have become a tropical depression, assigned the identifier Twenty-E, by 06:00UTC. Upon its designation, the depression was situated roughly 205mi (335km) south-southeast of Salina Cruz, Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Multiple {{sequence}} alignment also {{refers to}} the process of <b>aligning</b> such a sequence set. Because three or more sequences of biologically relevant length can be difficult and are almost always time-consuming to align by hand, computational algorithms are used to produce and analyze the alignments. MSAs require more sophisticated methodologies than pairwise alignment because they are more computationally complex. Most multiple sequence alignment programs use heuristic methods rather than global optimization because identifying the optimal alignment between more than a few sequences of moderate length is prohibitively computationally expensive.|$|E
5|$|One torque {{generated}} by a tire, called the self <b>aligning</b> torque, is caused by asymmetries in the side-slip {{along the length of}} the contact patch. The resultant force of this side-slip occurs behind the geometric center of the contact patch, a distance described as the pneumatic trail, and so creates a torque on the tire. Since the direction of the side-slip is towards the outside of the turn, the force on the tire is towards the center of the turn. Therefore, this torque tends to turn the front wheel in the direction of the side-slip, away from the direction of the turn, and therefore tends to increase the radius of the turn.|$|E
