50|$|Prior to World War II {{a number}} of European {{countries}} adopted the practice of forwarding letters to distant destinations {{at no extra cost}} to the sender (such as British mail sent to most parts of the British Empire). The consistently high costs of air mail curtailed this trend after the war. During the mid-1960s in response to the continuing increase of aircraft capacity, the UPU adopted the policy of maximizing <b>air</b> <b>conveyance</b> of mail and in the mid-1970s the concept of “surface air lifted” mail was developed in conjunction with the International Air Transport Association (IATA).|$|E
50|$|A53 pipe {{comes in}} three types and two grades, A53 Type F, which is {{longitudinally}} furnace butt welded or continuous welded (Grade A only), A53 Type E, which is longitudinally electric resistance welded (Grades A and B), and A53 Type S, which is seamless pipe, produced by hot working, and possibly cold finishing, the steel (Grades A and B). ASTM A53 pipe is sized {{according to the}} nominal pipe size (NPS) system. It is commonly available with national pipe thread ends or with plain cut ends. It {{can be used for}} steam, water, and <b>air</b> <b>conveyance.</b> It is also weldable and can be used in structural applications, although ASTM A500 tube, which is available in the same NPS sizes, is sometime preferred.|$|E
40|$|Some {{regression}} {{models for the}} forecasting of <b>air</b> passengers <b>conveyances</b> from EU countries are considered. Two different approaches for the mentioned above task of forecasting are shown. The first one is the classical method of linear regression and the second one is its generalized approach. The considered {{regression models}} contain many explanatory factors and their combinations. The advantage of using the generalized linear model (GLM) {{in comparison with the}} classical linear regression model is shown...|$|R
40|$|Pricing {{is often}} viewed as a high “leverage ” element of the {{marketing}} mix. That is, small improvements in pricing can lead to substantial improvements in profitability. In addition, surveys frequently report pricing as being managers’ biggest headache. It’s where they feel the most pressure to perform and the least certain {{that they are doing}} a good job (Dolan 1995). The first edition of “Retail Pricing Strategies and Market Power ” by Gordon Mills provides a thorough and insightful view into this important element of the marketing mix. Very broadly, the book divides into three sections. The first section examines the conceptual underpinnings of good pricing strategy. The second section examines pricing practices in six sectors – pharmaceuticals, retail foreign exchange, banking, <b>air</b> travel, <b>conveyancing,</b> an...|$|R
40|$|A {{critical}} {{issue for the}} grain farming industry is the continuous development of new and improved varieties. This often requires field experiments in small plots. Due to {{the small size of}} the plots and the large number of them, harvesting these trials often becomes very inefficient and expensive. Contamination and Occupational Health and Safety issues may also be involved. This paper describes the design and development of a prototype small-plot research harvesting system. The system features a beater type thrashing system which combines the dual functions of removing the grain from the crop and the thrashing system. The material then falls under gravity and is inducted into the <b>conveyance</b> <b>air</b> stream by means of a venturi. The grain and the trash are finally separated in a vertical air aspirator. Due to the self-cleaning nature of this design, the possible contamination between different plots has been avoided. The system is also compact and light. The potential improvements for the commercial production are identified...|$|R

This system consists of the EMMA robotic manipulator (by GreyPilgrim LLC) and the lightweight Scarifier (by Waterjet Technology, Inc.) powered by a 36 -kpsi Jet-Edge diesel powered high pressure pumping system. For demonstration and testing purposes, an <b>air</b> <b>conveyance</b> system was utilized to remove the waste from the simulated tank floor. The EMMA long reach manipulator utilized for this demonstration was 33 feet long. It consisted of 4 hydraulically controlled stages of varying lengths and coupling configurations. ...|$|E
40|$|Potential of {{competitiveness}} of the airport, {{as any other}} enterprise of the service sphere, {{is determined by the}} corporate power of the producer of these values. The issue of development of the infrastructure development strategy of leading international airports, which sets the goal of solution of the problem of complete, timely, uninterrupted and high quality satisfaction of the fast growing demand of services consumers with minimal costs, becomes extremely urgent under conditions of dynamic development of the world aviation. However, the airport infrastructure is rather wasteful and requires permanent investments into renovation of the infrastructure objects and technological systems. The airport infrastructure is a set of objects, which are divided, by their functional purpose, into objects that directly service the technological process of <b>air</b> <b>conveyance</b> (sphere of aviation activity) and objects that create additional services. Increase {{of competitiveness}} of the airport in the world economic environment envisages timely modernisation and harmonious development of its objects in accordance with requirements of the airport services market on the basis of rational resource provision and efficient management of the property complex at all stages of functioning and development. The author studies aspects of formation of the competitive strategy of the airport, identifies strategic priorities of development of the airport infrastructure, including through the mechanism of state-private partnership, use of transit potential, strengthening of the logistical component, increase of quality of servicing, and diversification of activity by means of strengthening its non-aviation component with consideration of goals of efficient integration in the national and global environment...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{previous}} radon migration {{experimental research}} object {{is for the}} most of radon gas in underground migration or the migration of air interface. By using the method of active carbon accumulated measuring radon, this thesis adjusts air pressure to study the migration regularity of radon. The paper measures the concentration distributions of radon in airtight vertical glass tube under the same temperature, humidity, different cumulative times and different pressure in vacuum (respectively for - 0. 06 MPa, - 0. 05 MPa, - 0. 04 MPa, atmospheric conditions). Basing on the migration equations of radon gas {{in the air and}} the concentration distribution of radon under different gas pressure, the paper estimates the average speed of radon gas under different pressures. Through series experiments, following conclusions can be obtained: the migration velocity of radon in the air is related with the air pressure: with greater <b>air</b> pressure, the <b>conveyance</b> speed is faster. Especially at low-pressure state the downward migration is more apparent. The average speed of radon in different pressures cases are estimated that compliance of the calculation results and the actual measurement was good results...|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) have taken steps to implement all seven of the recommendations GAO made in 2006 to improve the Agriculture Quarantine Inspection (AQI) program, but they face challenges in fully implementing four of them. Specifically, DHS and USDA have implemented GAO's recommendations to improve information sharing, review DHS's financial management system for the AQI program, and remove barriers to timely and accurate transfers of AQI user fees [...] collected for AQI services provided {{in connection with the}} arrival of international <b>air</b> passengers and <b>conveyances</b> at U. S. ports. However, DHS and USDA face challenges in fully implementing GAO's recommendations to adopt meaningful performance measures, establish a national risk-based staffing model, improve the agriculture canine program, and revise user fees to cover program costs. For example, in 2006, GAO recommended that DHS and USDA adopt meaningful performance measures for assessing the AQI program's effectiveness at intercepting foreign pests and disease. DHS and USDA have expanded the use of one type of performance measure but have not developed measures for all aspects of the AQI program that are important for its management. In addition, the AQI program does not have a strategic plan [...] a leading practice that would provide DHS and USDA with a framework for defining the mission of what the program seeks to accomplish, setting goals to achieve desired results, and identifying performance measures for gauging progress toward those goals. Furthermore, DHS has undertaken efforts to respond to GAO's recommendation to develop a national, risk-based staffing model but does not yet have one, and DHS anticipates that the model will recommend significant staffing increases. DHS officials told GAO {{they do not have the}} resources to increase staff, but the agency has not developed a plan that assesses the risk of potential fiscal constraints on its ability to implement the staffing model. Without a plan or strategy to address potential resource constraints on staffing by considering the fiscal resources that may realistically be available, DHS risks increasing the vulnerability of the agriculture sector to foreign pests and disease. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the Integrated Computerized Deployment System (ICODES) from both an architectural and evolutionary vantage point. First, ICODES is a logistic software application of ship load-planning tools that utilizes intelligent software agents in a human-computer collaborative mode. As {{an example of}} a new generation of intelligent military decision-support systems, ICODES includes expert agents with automatic reasoning and analysis capabilities. This is made possible by an internal virtual representation of the load-planning environment, in terms of conveyance and cargo characteristics and the complex relationships that constitute the context within which load-planning operations are performed. ICODES agents monitor the principal determinants of cargo stowage, including: the placement and segregation requirements for hazardous cargo items; the trim, list, stress, and bending moments of the conveyance structure; the accessibility of stow areas through ramps, cranes, elevators, hatches, and doors; the correct placement of cargo items in respect to fire lanes, no-stow areas, reserved stow areas, and inter-cargo spacing tolerances; and, the accuracy of cargo characteristics (e. g., dimensions, weight, type, and identification codes) relative to standard cargo libraries and associated reference tables. Second, ICODES is a system that has evolved over the past 10 years and is continuing to evolve from a stand-alone application focused on the load-planning of ships to a distributed environment capable of addressing the assembly and planning for any kind of surface or <b>air</b> <b>conveyance.</b> This transition from single domain to multiple domains and from stand-alone to distributed has been made possible by a scalable service-oriented architecture that emphasizes a multi-layered, multi-tiered design approach...|$|E
