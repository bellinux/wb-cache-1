5|$|Juveniles {{begin to}} court at <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>early</b> age, {{but may not}} bond for another two or three years. Aerial acrobatics, demonstrations of intelligence, and ability to provide food are key {{behaviors}} of courting. Once paired, they tend to nest together for life, usually in the same location. Instances of non-monogamy have been observed in common ravens, by males visiting a female's nest when her mate is away.|$|E
5|$|Lemuriform origins {{are unclear}} and debated. American {{paleontologist}} Philip Gingerich proposed that lemuriform primates evolved {{from one of}} several genera of European adapids based on similarities between the front lower teeth of adapids and the toothcomb of extant lemuriforms; however, this view is not strongly supported {{due to a lack}} of clear transitional fossils. Instead, lemuriforms may be descended from <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>early</b> branch of Asian cercamoniines or sivaladapids that migrated to northern Africa.|$|E

5|$|Broke drilled {{his crew}} to an {{extremely}} {{high standard of}} naval gunnery; he regularly had them fire at targets, such as floating barrels. Often these drills would be made into competitions to see which gun crew could hit the target and how fast they could do so. He even had his gun crews fire at targets 'blindfold' to good effect; they were only given the bearing to lay their gun on without being allowed to sight the gun on the target themselves. This constituted <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>early</b> example of 'director firing'.|$|E
5|$|During the Middle Ages, the small, {{scattered}} {{community in}} and around Milnrow was primarily agrarian, with the growing and milling of grain and cereal being the main labour of the people. Dry ironstone smelting was introduced into Milnrow at <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>early</b> time as evidenced from ancient kilns found at Tunshill. A chantry was constructed in the year 1400 by the Byrons—the then Lords of the Manor—and a chapel for the wider community in 1496; A document dated 20 March 1496, {{during the reign of}} Henry VII, proclaims that open land by the River Beal would be the site of the new chapel.|$|E
5|$|Early filters {{utilised}} {{the phenomenon}} of resonance to filter signals. Although electrical resonance had been investigated by researchers from <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>early</b> stage, it was at first not widely understood by electrical engineers. Consequently, the much more familiar concept of acoustic resonance (which in turn, can be {{explained in terms of}} the even more familiar mechanical resonance) found its way into filter design ahead of electrical resonance. Resonance can be used to achieve a filtering effect because the resonant device will respond to frequencies at, or near, to the resonant frequency but will not respond to frequencies far from resonance. Hence frequencies far from resonance are filtered out from the output of the device.|$|E

He was the third of three children, with two older brothers, Wilhelm Wilhelm (1904–1981) and Josef Wilhelm (1909–1981). His father fought in and survived World War I as an {{artillery}} soldier, being awarded the Iron Cross. Postwar, the Weimar Inflation crisis of 1923 wiped out virtually all the family savings, and as a result, from <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>early</b> age, Graf had to work.|$|E

5|$|On {{the issue}} of {{geographic}} origin, linguists during the 20th century agreed that the Uto-Aztecan language family originated in the southwestern United States. Evidence from archaeology and ethnohistory supports a southward diffusion across the American continent thesis, specifically that speakers of early Nahuan languages migrated from Aridoamerica into central Mexico in several waves. But recently, the traditional assessment has been challenged by Jane H. Hill, who proposes instead that the Uto-Aztecan language family originated in central Mexico and spread northwards at <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>early</b> date. This hypothesis and the analyses of data that it rests upon have received serious criticism.|$|E

It depicts a hunting ritual involving dancers holding their bows; one figure has a bow in each hand, two perform artistic leaps and another holds a horn-shaped stick and is striking a frame drum.|$|E
5|$|The BT46 was an {{aluminium}} alloy monocoque featuring the trapezoidal cross section common {{to many of}} Gordon Murray’s 1970s designs. It featured inbuilt pneumatic jacks fed from an external supply of compressed air to lift it off the ground for tyre changes during practice. It employed <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>early</b> version of the carbon brakes that were in universal use by the mid-1980s—a concept taken from the aircraft industry. The system, which Brabham had been developing since 1976, combined carbon composite brake pads with a steel disc faced with carbon composite 'pucks'.|$|E
5|$|The initial accretional heating {{together}} with continued decay of radioactive elements {{may have led}} to melting of the ice if an antifreeze like ammonia (in the form of ammonia hydrate) or some salt was present. The melting {{may have led to}} the separation of ice from rocks and formation of a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle. A layer of liquid water (ocean) rich in dissolved ammonia may have formed at the core–mantle boundary. The eutectic temperature of this mixture is 176K. The ocean, however, is likely to have frozen long ago.

5|$|The {{number of}} {{possible}} elements is not known. <b>A</b> <b>very</b> <b>early</b> suggestion made by Elliot Adams in 1911, {{and based on the}} arrangement of elements in each horizontal periodic table row, was that elements of atomic weight greater than 256± (which would equate to between elements 99 and 100 in modern-day terms) did not exist. A higher—more recent—estimate is that the periodic table may end soon after the island of stability, which is expected to centre around element 126, as the extension of the periodic and nuclides tables is restricted by proton and neutron drip lines. Other predictions of an end to the periodic table include at element 128 by John Emsley, at element 137 by Richard Feynman, and at element 155 by Albert Khazan.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} study of dinosaurs began in the 1820s of England. In 1842, Richard Owen coined the term dinosaur, which under his vision were elephantine reptiles. An ambitious scientist who used dinosaurs and other fossils to promote his beliefs, Owen was the driving force for the Crystal Palace dinosaur sculptures, the first large-scale dinosaur reconstructions that were accessible to the public (1854). These sculptures, which can still be seen today, immortalized <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>early</b> stage {{in the perception of}} dinosaurs.|$|E
