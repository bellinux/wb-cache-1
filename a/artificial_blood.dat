5|$|Liquid {{fluorocarbons}} {{can hold}} {{large volumes of}} oxygen or carbon dioxide, more so than blood, and have attracted attention for their possible uses in <b>artificial</b> <b>blood</b> and in liquid breathing. Because fluorocarbons do not normally mix with water, they must be mixed into emulsions (small droplets of perfluorocarbon suspended in water) {{to be used as}} blood. One such product, Oxycyte, has been through initial clinical trials. These substances can aid endurance athletes and are banned from sports; one cyclist's near death in 1998 prompted an investigation into their abuse. Applications of pure perfluorocarbon liquid breathing (which uses pure perfluorocarbon liquid, not a water emulsion) include assisting burn victims and premature babies with deficient lungs. Partial and complete lung filling have been considered, though only the former has had any significant tests in humans. An Alliance Pharmaceuticals effort reached clinical trials but was abandoned because the results were not better than normal therapies.|$|E

500|$|Perpetuating {{the family}} cult with many {{descendants}} was {{coupled with the}} notion that producing more children offered the family a layer of protection, reinforcing its power in the community. More children meant better odds of extending a family's power through marriage alliance with other prominent families, as well as better odds of having a child occupying a prestigious administrative post in government. Hymes notes that [...] "elite families used such standards as official standing or wealth, prospects for office, length of pedigree, scholarly renown, and local reputation in choosing both sons-in-law and daughters-in-law." [...] Since official promotion was considered by examination degree as well as recommendation to office by a superior, a family that acquired a significant amount of sons-in-law of high rank in the bureaucracy ensured kinship protection and prestigious career options for its members. Those who came from noteworthy families were treated with dignity, and a wider family influence meant a better chance for an individual to secure his own fortunes. No one was better prepared for society than one who gained plenty of experience in dealing with the members of his extended family, as it was common for upper-class families to have several generations living in the same household. However, one did not even have to share the same bloodline with others in order to build more social ties in their community. This could be done by accepting any number of <b>artificial</b> <b>blood</b> brothers in a ceremony assuring mutual obligations and shared loyalty.|$|E

More than 3,711 patients were tested in sixteen studies using five types of <b>artificial</b> <b>blood.</b> Public Citizen sued the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to obtain information on the duration of these studies which were found to have been conducted from 1998 until 2007.

5000|$|Research {{interest}} {{in the use of}} <b>artificial</b> cells for <b>blood</b> arose after the AIDS scare of the 1980s. Besides bypassing the potential for disease transmission, <b>artificial</b> red <b>blood</b> cells are desired because they eliminate drawbacks associated with allogenic blood transfusions such as blood typing, immune reactions and its short storage life of 42 days. A hemoglobin substitute may be stored at room temperature and not under refrigeration for more than a year. Attempts have been made to develop a complete working red blood cell which comprises carbonic not only an oxygen carrier but also the enzymes associated with the cell. The first attempt was made in 1957 by replacing the red blood cell membrane by an ultrathin polymeric membrane which was followed by encapsulation through a lipid membrane [...] and more recently a biodegradable polymeric membrane.An biological red blood cell membrane including lipids and associated proteins {{can also be used to}} encapsulate nanoparticles and increase residence time in vivo by bypassing macrophage uptake and systemic clearance.|$|R
