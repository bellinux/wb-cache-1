5|$|Diagnosis of a {{pneumothorax}} {{by physical}} examination alone {{can be difficult}} (particularly in smaller pneumothoraces). <b>A</b> <b>chest</b> X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan, or ultrasound is usually used to confirm its presence. Other conditions that can result in similar symptoms include a hemothorax (buildup {{of blood in the}} pleural space), pulmonary embolism, and heart attack. A large bullae may look similar on <b>a</b> <b>chest</b> X-ray.|$|E
5|$|Before {{treatment}} is begun, several other investigations are recommended. These include <b>a</b> <b>chest</b> x-ray, liver function tests, kidney function tests, and {{a test for}} levels of CA-125, a tumor marker that can be elevated in endometrial cancer.|$|E

30|$|Approximate {{effective}} dose from <b>a</b> single-view <b>chest</b> X-ray is 0.02 mSv and from <b>a</b> two-view <b>chest</b> X-ray is {{five times the}} single-view chest X-ray. Correct answer for single-view chest X-ray was given by 51  % (n[*]=[*] 47), for <b>a</b> two-view <b>chest</b> X-ray by 35  % (n[*]=[*] 32) and for both by only 23  % (n[*]=[*] 21) of participants. No statistical difference found among different groups of participants.|$|R
30|$|The quoted {{radiation}} dose for <b>a</b> standard <b>chest</b> radiograph is 0.02  mSv (Public Health England 2014). The average extra {{radiation dose}} received by a patient having an AP/Lateral film was calculated to be 0.0107  mSv, approximately {{half that of}} <b>a</b> standard <b>chest</b> radiograph.|$|R
5|$|It is {{possible}} for a patient with <b>a</b> <b>chest</b> tube to be managed in an ambulatory care setting by using a Heimlich valve, although research to demonstrate the equivalence to hospitalization has been of limited quality.|$|E
5|$|Lung cancer often {{appears as}} a solitary {{pulmonary}} nodule on <b>a</b> <b>chest</b> radiograph. However, the differential diagnosis is wide. Many other diseases can also give this appearance, including metastatic cancer, hamartomas, and infectious granulomas such as tuberculosis, histoplasmosis and coccidioidomycosis. Lung cancer can also be an incidental finding, as a solitary pulmonary nodule on <b>a</b> <b>chest</b> radiograph or CT scan done for an unrelated reason. The definitive diagnosis of lung cancer is based on histological examination of the suspicious tissue {{in the context of}} the clinical and radiological features.|$|E
5|$|Pneumonia is {{typically}} diagnosed {{based on a}} combination of physical signs and <b>a</b> <b>chest</b> X-ray. However, the underlying cause can be difficult to confirm, as there is no definitive test able to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial origin.|$|E
50|$|In sewing and patternmaking, ease is {{the amount}} of room a garment allows the wearer beyond the {{measurements}} of their body. For example, if a man has <b>a</b> 40-inch <b>chest</b> measurement, <b>a</b> jacket with <b>a</b> 40-inch <b>chest</b> would be very tight and would constrict movement. An ease of 3 or 4 inches might be added to the pattern (making <b>a</b> 43-44 inch <b>chest),</b> or more to enhance comfort or style. Ease is not generally included in sizing measurements. To use the example again, a man with <b>a</b> 40-inch <b>chest</b> will likely buy a jacket advertised as size 40, but the actual measurements of the garment will almost always be somewhat larger.|$|R
50|$|About 10 m {{south of}} the chancel is <b>a</b> 15th-century <b>chest</b> tomb {{decorated}} with quatrefoil panels. It is a Grade II* listed structure. Also notable is <b>an</b> 18th-century <b>chest</b> tomb about 15 m east of the chancel. It was built for a Thomas Dalby, who died in 1734.|$|R

5|$|Aspiration {{may also}} be {{considered}} in secondary pneumothorax of moderate size (air rim 1–2cm) without breathlessness, with the difference that ongoing observation in hospital is required even after a successful procedure. American professional guidelines state that all large pneumothoraces – even those due to PSP – should be treated with <b>a</b> <b>chest</b> tube. Moderately sized iatrogenic traumatic pneumothoraces (due to medical procedures) may initially be treated with aspiration.|$|E
5|$|Daenerys voices {{her fear}} of the barbarian lord, but her brother tells her to marry him. During the wedding ceremony, Daenerys is given two wedding gifts. The first is a {{collection}} of books from the Seven Kingdoms, given by Ser Jorah Mormont, an exiled knight loyal to the Targaryens. The second gift is <b>a</b> <b>chest</b> containing three petrified dragon eggs, given by Magister Illyrio Mopatis, the man who helped arrange the marriage.|$|E
5|$|If <b>a</b> <b>chest</b> tube {{is already}} in place, various agents may be instilled through the tube to achieve {{chemical}} pleurodesis, such as talc, tetracycline, minocycline or doxycycline. Results of chemical pleurodesis tend to be worse than when using surgical approaches, but talc pleurodesis {{has been found to}} have few negative long-term consequences in younger people.|$|E

5|$|Lucas is {{an admirer}} of English poet and painter William Blake; Elizabeta reveals that Lucas' admiration of Blake is based on their common {{distrust}} of systems. Lucas decorates his flat with some of Blake's paintings, and has <b>a</b> <b>chest</b> tattoo resembling The Ancient of Days, one of Blake's watercolour paintings. Though no longer married to Elizabeta, he maintains strong feelings towards her throughout {{the first half of}} series seven.|$|E
5|$|Performing <b>a</b> <b>chest</b> {{radiograph}} {{is one of}} {{the first}} investigative steps if a person reports symptoms that may suggest lung cancer. This may reveal an obvious mass, widening of the mediastinum (suggestive of spread to lymph nodes there), atelectasis (collapse), consolidation (pneumonia) or pleural effusion. CT imaging is typically used to provide more information about the type and extent of disease. Bronchoscopy or CT-guided biopsy is often used to sample the tumor for histopathology.|$|E
5|$|Some {{fragments}} of the priory travelled further afield. At Hardwick Hall near Sedgefield, a mock ruin was built incorporating sculptured stones brought from the priory. The priory's wealth became the stuff of local legends, one of which claimed an underground passage led from the priory to a cave under the hills in which a raven stood guard over <b>a</b> <b>chest</b> of gold.|$|E

5|$|Tension {{pneumothorax}} {{is usually}} treated with urgent needle decompression. This {{may be required}} before transport to the hospital, and can be performed by an emergency medical technician or other trained professional. The needle or cannula is left in place until <b>a</b> <b>chest</b> tube can be inserted. If tension pneumothorax leads to cardiac arrest, needle decompression is performed as part of resuscitation as it may restore cardiac output.|$|E
5|$|The {{function}} of the lungs can also be affected by compression from fluid in the pleural cavity pleural effusion, or other substances such as air (pneumothorax), blood (hemothorax), or rarer causes. These may be investigated using <b>a</b> <b>chest</b> X-ray or CT scan, and may require the insertion of a surgical drain until the underlying cause is identified and treated.|$|E
5|$|The {{treatment}} of pneumothorax {{depends on a}} number of factors, and may vary from discharge with early follow-up to immediate needle decompression or insertion of <b>a</b> <b>chest</b> tube. Treatment is determined by the severity of symptoms and indicators of acute illness, the presence of underlying lung disease, the estimated size of the pneumothorax on X-ray, and – in some instances – on the personal preference of the person involved.|$|E

5|$|To {{distinguish}} between OHS {{and various other}} lung diseases that can cause similar symptoms, medical imaging of the lungs (such as <b>a</b> <b>chest</b> X-ray or CT/CAT scan), spirometry, electrocardiography and echocardiography may be performed. Echo- and electrocardiography may also show strain {{on the right side}} of the heart caused by OHS, and spirometry may show a restrictive pattern related to obesity.|$|E
5|$|A human {{going into}} an ala’s house, which is {{frequently}} {{deep in a}} forest, but may also be in the clouds, in a lake, spring, cave, gigantic tree, or other hidden remote place, or on an inhospitable mountain, can have varied consequences. If he approaches the ala with an appeal, and does not mention the differences between her and humans, he will be rewarded. Otherwise, he will be cruelly punished. According to one story, a stepdaughter, driven away from home by her stepmother, comes to an ala’s house; addresses her with the word mother; picks lice from the ala’s hair full of worms; and feeds the ala’s “livestock” of owls, wolves, badgers, and other wild animals; behaving and talking as if these things are quite normal to her, and is rewarded by the ala with <b>a</b> <b>chest</b> filled with gold. When the stepmother’s daughter comes to the ala’s house, she does the opposite, and the ala punishes her and her mother by sending them <b>a</b> <b>chest</b> of snakes, which blind them. In another example, when a prince asks an ala for her daughter’s hand, she saves him from other ale, and helps him get married. But when a girl to whom an ala is the godmother visits the ala with her mother, the ala eats them both because the mother talked about the strange things in her house.|$|E
5|$|A small {{spontaneous}} pneumothorax will typically resolve without treatment and requires only monitoring. This approach {{may be most}} appropriate in {{people who have no}} underlying lung disease. In a larger pneumothorax, or if there is shortness of breath, the air may be removed with a syringe or <b>a</b> <b>chest</b> tube connected to a one-way valve system. Occasionally, surgery may be required if tube drainage is unsuccessful, or as a preventive measure, if there have been repeated episodes. The surgical treatments usually involve pleurodesis (in which the layers of pleura are induced to stick together) or pleurectomy (the surgical removal of pleural membranes). About 17–23 cases of pneumothorax occur per 100,000 people per year. They are more common in men than women.|$|E
