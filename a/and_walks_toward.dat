25|$|Kate and Sawyer {{travel to}} Hydra Island via Desmond's boat Elizabeth, {{to the site}} of the Ajira Airlines plane where Lapidus, Richard and Miles have been quickly trying to make it air-worthy. Kate convinces Claire she can help her raise Aaron and they head for the plane. After Kate, Sawyer and Claire board the plane, Lapidus {{successfully}} gets it off the island. Jack leads Hurley and Ben back to the heart of the Island, where Jack convinces an emotional Hurley to take over as the protector of the island, stating Hurley was always meant to be the leader. Hurley and Ben lower Jack to the dry pool where he rescues a barely conscious Desmond. Jack manages to restore the light by replacing the stone plug, and is enveloped in the light that surrounds him. Hurley, in his role as the new protector of the island, does not know what to do. Ben tells him he should help Desmond get home and suggests there may be a better way of protecting the island than how Jacob did. Hurley asks him for help, and Ben is honored. Jack reawakens outside by a river <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> <b>toward</b> the bamboo forest. After Jack collapses to the ground, Vincent approaches him and lies next to him. Jack gazes happily at the sky while watching the Ajira plane fly overhead away from the island. Jack slowly closes his eyes as he dies.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Honey" [...] was {{directed}} by Roman Coppola. It opens with a wooden box falling from the sky – upon hitting the ground, three clones of Moby dressed in suits emerge and make their way towards a city. One spots a car <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> <b>toward</b> it, but accidentally drops a map in his possession. Crawling underneath the car to retrieve it, the Moby clone soon finds himself in a bathing woman's apartment room – he manages to obtain the map and exit the room before the woman discovers his presence. He enters another room, followed by his duplicates, and jumps out the window.|$|E
500|$|In the Fortress of Regrets, The Nameless One {{encounters}} {{three of}} his past incarnations: one practical, one good, and one paranoid. The Nameless One learns that the [...] "good" [...] incarnation is the original, who was made immortal by Ravel. The Nameless One had committed immeasurably terrible deeds in his lifetime, and when he realized there would be retribution on his soul when he died, he sought to postpone death {{as long as possible}} in order to atone. After meeting his past incarnations, The Nameless One confronts his mortality, which is embodied as a powerful being called The Transcendent One. The Transcendent One reveals that since being separated from The Nameless One, he has enjoyed his freedom and has been attempting to erase clues that might lead The Nameless One to discover the truth. Depending on the player's choice, The Nameless One either slays his mortality or convinces it to rejoin with him; either option finally ends his immortality and allows him to die. In the game's final scene, The Nameless One awakens near a battleground of the eternal Blood War between demons and devils; he picks up a mace <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> <b>toward</b> the conflict.|$|E

5000|$|The story {{takes place}} over the span of a few hours during one night. The unnamed protagonist, a {{scientist}} working on extra-sensory perception, leaves work <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> <b>toward</b> home. He is haunted by perceptions of another world, and creatures in it, who appear to be malevolent. Through flashbacks, it is revealed that he has accidentally uncovered evidence of a different and superior class of beings, which he calls [...] "Superiors", who co-exist with humans but had previously gone almost undetected.

50|$|Cheval Robert is {{the smaller}} of Datura's servants, {{but is still}} quite strong. He shows far more emotion than Andre (which still isn't much). When Odd meets Datura for the first time, Andre stands next {{to her at the}} window and observes the storm. Robert instead chooses to watch the candles with a childlike intrigue. When Andre and Robert are given the job of {{guarding}} the lanterns for Odd and Datura in the casino, Andre stands firm and silent, while Robert appears to be a bit nervous. Odd encounters Robert in a hotel suite while hiding from Datura. Robert is immediately aware of Odd, but chooses to ignore him, choosing to watch the storm at the window first. Robert then turns to Odd <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> <b>toward</b> him, never bothering to raise his revolver. At this moment, Robert makes the only noise heard from either he or Andre. It is a low pitched groan that sounds exasperated. Robert then begins to raise his revolver hand. Odd shoots Robert four times with a shotgun, causing him to fall off the hotel balcony. His body disappears. Robert and Andre are perhaps zombies, animated by Datura's stolen ti bon ange (Good Little Angel). They appear to have a hunger for flesh and they never speak.|$|E

5000|$|The narrator [...] "Smith" [...] {{tells his}} {{story in the}} first person. A {{traveler}} and amateur naturalist, he regains consciousness [...] "under a heap of earth and stones" [...] and believes {{that he had been}} knocked unconscious in a fall - though his thoughts and recollections are confused. He is astounded to discover that he is entwined in the roots of plants, as though they have been growing around him. Extricating himself and surveying the scene, he sees a great house in the distance, <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> <b>toward</b> it to seek help and information. On his way, he encounters a funeral: a group of strangely yet strikingly dressed people, led by a majestic white-bearded old man, are interring a corpse in a grave. The narrator is especially struck by a beautiful girl who is overcome by grief. She appears to be about 14 years old; though, he soon learns that this world, and everyone in it are far older than they appear. He becomes enchanted by her, and falls in love. The funeral party see him, and express surprise at his presence and his odd uncouth clothes and boots; but they allow him to accompany them to the enormous mansion where they live.|$|E
5000|$|Nathan {{arranges}} for Peter's release, {{but when}} they leave the police station, Peter begins coughing and collapses, unconscious. As he hits the ground, his surroundings change. Peter has {{what appears to be}} a vision of New York City, which is empty save many cars - most with their doors open. Peter looks around and the other major characters start appearing out of various places. Mohinder climbs out of a cab and runs from Peter. Matt stops Peter and leads D.L., Niki, and Micah away from him. Hiro and Ando watch sadly from a distance. Simone begins to run to Peter but is held back by Isaac. Claire approaches Peter and tearfully mouths [...] "I'm sorry" [...] before running in the opposite direction. Nathan finally steps out of a building <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> <b>toward</b> Peter with a forlorn expression on his face. Peter looks at his hands which have begun to glow bright orange. After Nathan approaches close enough to be seen in the same shot, Peter screams as his whole body turns orange and explodes, similar to the flaming man Isaac had painted. At this point Peter wakes up, whispering [...] "It's all my fault. The explosion...it's me", then faints again as the episode ends.|$|E
50|$|Tara {{realizes that}} A History of Witchcraft {{is missing from}} their shelf and after {{concluding}} that Dawn took it, she and Willow (who is sheepishly feigning surprise) decide to call Buffy. Buffy hears about Dawn's spell just as she is finishing it upstairs in her room. When Buffy confronts her, the two girls get into a vicious argument about their different {{ways of dealing with}} their mother's death. Dawn accuses Buffy of being so busy arranging everything that she doesn't care that their mother is dead, earning herself a slap across the face from her sister. Buffy immediately regrets her action and admits that she's keeping busy so she doesn't {{have to deal with the}} situation, because when she stops then her mother is really gone. During their argument, a figure emerges from Joyce's grave <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> <b>toward</b> the house. A shadow passes by the front window followed by a knocking on the door, and Buffy, hoping it's Joyce, rushes to answer the door. Dawn immediately realizes the inherent dangers of the spell and rips up the photo, and when Buffy answers the door all she finds is an empty step. This is too much for Buffy and she starts to cry, finally facing the reality of her mother's death. A sobbing Dawn hugs her, and they collapse to the floor united in grief.|$|E

40|$|Two {{triangulation}} {{methods for}} measuring perceived egocentric distance were examined. In the triangulation-by-pointing procedure, the observer views a target at some distance and, with eyes closed, attempts to point continuously {{at the target}} while traversing a path that passes by it. In the triangulation-by-walking procedure, the observer views a target and, with eyes closed, traverses a path that is oblique to the target; on command from the experimenter, the observer turns <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> <b>toward</b> the target. Two experiments using pointing and 3 using walking showed that perceived distance, averaged over observers, was accurate out to 15 m under full-cue conditions. For target distances between 15 and 25 m, the evidence indicates slight perceptual underestimation. Results also show that observers, on average, were accu-rate in imaginally updating the locations of previously viewed targets. The term visual space (or visually perceived space) refers to a perceptual representation of the immediate physical environment that exists independently {{of any of the}} partic-ular spatial behaviors it helps to control. Much vision re-search has been devoted to establishing the functional prop-erties of visual space and the mechanisms that underlie it. A major goal of such research has been to characterize the mapping from physical to visual space under different con-ditions of information availability, but ultimately the goal must be to predict visual space solely in terms of its sensory inputs and internal determinants (e. g., intrinsic noise, ob-server assumptions, etc.). Because visual direction is perceived accurately, most space perception research has examined the perception of egocentric distance (i-e., the distance from the object to the observer) and the perception of exocentric distance (i. e., the distance between two targets lying in the same visual direc-tion or, more generally, the distance between any two loca-tions). Because we believe that the perception of egocentri...|$|E
