However, she stressed that it is good to be different and not predictable.|$|E

The third to twelfth carriages carried councillors and their wives; the twelfth included Council surveyor JWS Palmer and his wife.

500|$|Star Trek: The Next Generation's creator, Gene Roddenberry, {{wanted to}} include an episode {{revealing}} the characters' motivations to the audience {{early on in the}} series. As a basis, he turned to the [...] episode [...] "The Naked Time." [...] Executive producer Rick Berman described [...] "The Naked Now" [...] as [...] "a homage, not a copy" [...] of [...] "The Naked Time," [...] while director Paul Lynch described it as [...] "slightly more adult <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> comic than the original".|$|E

[...] Of course, they wouldn't let me do that." [...] He described the disappointing result as a [...] "typical 1967 limited-animation theatrical". Animation historian Michael Barrier called the film [...] "an offensively bad picture, the kind that makes people who love animation get up and leave the theater in disgust". Production of Mighty Heroes ended when Bakshi left Terrytoons.|$|E

500|$|As with Instant Vintage, Ray Ray {{features}} Saadiq's characteristic {{fusion of}} programmed beats, strings, neo soul melodies, and live guitars. The songs are mostly mid-tempo and groove-based, and also feature rubbery bass lines and horns. AllMusic's Andy Kellman views that the album's music is [...] "a little funkier <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> energetic than 2002's Instant Vintage, yet just {{as full of}} Saadiq's stylish flourishes." [...] He writes of the album's subject matter, [...] "for every song that's charmingly simple and full of lighthearted romantic sentiments, there's something message-oriented". Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe characterizes the album's mood as [...] "playful" [...] and writes that it is composed as [...] "a bouncy song cycle that's a throwback to '70s funk." ...|$|E
500|$|Owen Gleiberman {{gave the}} film a C– rating, praising Petty's {{performance}} {{which he said}} was the only good part of an otherwise [...] "amateurish" [...] film. Jonathan Rosenbaum and Janet Maslin gave moderately positive reviews, with Rosenbaum concluding: [...] "unless you're a preteen boy who hates girls, it's funnier <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> fun than Batman Forever." [...] Maslin wrote: [...] "Chief among its strong points is Lori Petty, a buzz-cut fashion plate in a Prozac necklace, who brings the necessary gusto to Tank Girl's flippancy." [...] Leonard Klady from Variety gave a mixed review, saying: [...] "What's missing from the mix is an engaging story to bind together its intriguing bits. And Lori Petty as 'Tank Girl'... has the spunk but, sadly, not {{the heart of the}} post-apocalyptic heroine." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin" [...] has {{received}} generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics. Christopher Connelly, {{a writer for}} Rolling Stone, described [...] "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin" [...] as being Thrillers [...] "most combative track". Connelly noted that in the [...] "hyperactive" [...] song, Jackson's [...] "emotions are so raw that the song nearly goes out of control". He further commented that the song has a [...] "tune that's almost as exciting as seeing Jackson motivate himself across a concert stage – <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> unpredictable". Remarking that while the song's lyrics [...] "won't keep Elvis Costello awake nights [...] ", they [...] "do show that Jackson has progressed past the hey-let's-hustle sentiments that dominated Off the Wall". He added that Jackson's [...] "raw ability and conviction make material like", citing [...] "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin", {{as well as other}} of Thrillers songs, [...] "into first-class cuts".|$|E

[...] "As Daylight Dies" [...] proved {{to be one of}} their biggest albums yet. It also entered the Australian Albums Chart at number 29. Mixed by Dutkiewicz, the album received mostly positive reviews—Thom Jurek of Allmusic called it [...] "a Top Five metal candidate for 2006 for sure". Decibel Magazine contributor Nick Terry said [...] "To call As Daylight Dies addictive would be an understatement. That it outdoes its already impressive enough predecessor could almost go without saying". Cosmo Lee of Stylus Magazine commented [...] "the album is astonishingly badly sequenced", though he praised the album as being [...] "less emotionally heavy-handed, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> fun". As of November 27, 2007, As Daylight Dies has sold more than 500,000 units in the US.|$|E
500|$|A {{pneumatic}} value {{failure in}} the preceding race, the United States Grand Prix, had forced Häkkinen to retire from the Grand Prix. With two races of the season remaining and an eight-point deficit after losing {{the lead in the}} Drivers' Championship, Häkkinen remained confident about his title chances: [...] "I know that what happened to me in the last Grand Prix, when I had to retire, can happen to anyone, It could happen to Michael. So I am very optimistic. I have come here prepared and thinking about these two races together. Not one, two." [...] Michael Schumacher emphasised the pressure of leading the championship going into Japan: [...] "It hasn't been a relaxing time at all and I still haven't completely got over the jetlag from the States. But I'm prepared to sacrifice this <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> to bring the title back to Maranello. And {{the same can be said}} of the entire team." [...] Ferrari team principal Jean Todt and former World Champion Jody Scheckter called for Barrichello and Coulthard to race fairly as both drivers were ordered by their teams to assist their teammates in the Championship battle.|$|E
500|$|The {{proprietary}} Rockstar Advanced Game Engine (RAGE) was overhauled for {{the game}} to improve its draw distance rendering capabilities, and the Euphoria and Bullet engines handle further animation and environment rendering tasks. The team found they could render the game world with greater detail than in Grand Theft Auto IV because they had {{become familiar with the}} PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360's hardware. Art director Aaron Garbut said that while the consoles' ageing hardware were tiring to work with, the team could still render detailed lighting and shadows and [...] "maintain a consistent look". Vice president Dan Houser agreed and felt that working on Grand Theft Auto IV with relatively new hardware was a challenge, but added [...] "now we know what the hardware's capable of, so it's become a lot easier to move things along <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> fun, too". The PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions fit onto one Blu-Ray Disc; Xbox 360 copies are distributed on two DVD discs and require an 8 GB installation on the HDD or external storage device; while the Microsoft Windows (PC) version takes up seven DVD disks. The team asserted that any differences between the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions would be negligible.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{commented on}} the {{differences}} between Free and Office of Strategic Influence. Rosenberg described Free as [...] "heavier, darker, more experimental <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> consistent" [...] than the first album. Stewart Mason of Allmusic described the album as [...] "downright commercial {{in a way that}} none of the duo's previous projects have been". He regarded the album as less like the [...] "standard-issue epic metal" [...] of the first album and more like [...] "Evanescence's gothy metal-pop crossed with late-era Radiohead's fondness for electronic interference". He considered the songwriting as [...] "catchy enough that it's not unthinkable that unadventurous rock radio programmers could take a shine to the title track or 'Go'", although noted that [...] "Fates Warning and Dream Theater fans might be less impressed". Rosenberg considers Free as musically [...] "a more progressive version of Nine Inch Nails. Instead of creating their darkness with angst and depression, OSI creates their darkness with sheer indifference." [...] Begrand compared the album to Head Control System, [...] "in that it tends to stray from the typical metal template in an attempt at something a little more electronic influenced". Although not considering Free to be as [...] "enthralling" [...] as Head Control System, he noted that the album [...] "still has its moments".|$|E
500|$|When {{producers}} realised that Paul's behaviour {{had gone}} too far, they considered killing him off. Dennis commented [...] "As an actor, I had the best time because this character just got more evil and more sneaky, more of a cad and a womaniser and it just escalated where {{it got to the}} point where it just got silly. It was ridiculous for the supposed reality of the show." [...] The actor also said that he accepted the producers decision to kill his character off when they explained that they did not know where to take him. However, the show's then executive producer Ric Pellizzeri decided to save the character and redeem him by giving him a brain tumour. Following the removal of the brain tumour, Paul mellowed in his evil ways. Of Paul's dramatic change to his personality, post brain tumour, Dennis compared the differences stating: [...] "He's changed back to where he was 18 odd years ago. What he has become is the same Paul he was back then when he was a very ambitious young entrepreneur with Lassiters and Robinson Corporation. But the difference now is that he is older and wiser and therefore a lot more shrewd <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> careful. Post brain tumor, he is no longer evil, more ruthless than evil. Ruthless with a conscience and emotion." ...|$|E

Determined to reform her high school students, Gruwell takes on two part-time jobs to pay for <b>more</b> books <b>and</b> spends <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> time at school, much to the disappointment of her husband (Patrick Dempsey).

2500|$|Many {{scholars}} {{argue that}} the Union held an insurmountable long-term advantage over the Confederacy in industrial strength and population.

2500|$|One of {{the main}} criticisms of the game {{was that it was}} a lot less [...] "serious" [...] <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> [...] "cartoony" [...] than The First Encounter and The Second Encounter. An over-emphasis on {{reflective}} surfaces and oddly out of place pixel shading were perceived as being more about showing off the capabilities of the engine than about defining the atmosphere of the game. Lighter colors and a more upbeat soundtrack made the game feel less grounded in reality, contrary to the realistic Egyptian tombs and Mayan pyramids of the earlier games, and players complained that while the weapons of the previous games seemed to be massive and powerful, those in Serious Sam 2 were less so.|$|E
