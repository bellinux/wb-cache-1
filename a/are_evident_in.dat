5|$|Products of volcano-ice {{interactions}} {{stand as}} various structures, whose shape {{is dependent on}} complex eruptive and environmental interactions. Glacial volcanism is a good indicator of past ice distribution, making it an important climatic marker. Since they are imbedded in ice, as ice retracts worldwide there are concerns that tuyas and other structures may destabalize, resulting in mass landslides. Evidence of volcanic-glacial interactions <b>are</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> Iceland and parts of British Columbia, and it is even possible that they {{play a role in}} deglaciation.|$|E
5|$|The main {{geological}} feature {{south of}} Hallatrow consists of Supra-Pennant Measures {{which include the}} upper coal measures and outcrops of sandstone. Relics of its industrial past <b>are</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> the area, including the highly visible and distinct conical shaped Old Mills Batch with its generally unvegetated surface. The three disused colliery sites {{have been developed for}} light industry, a depot and a superstore.|$|E

5|$|Both The Pleasure Garden and The Mountain Eagle were {{produced}} in co-operation with Emelka Film Studios in Munich, Germany. The film was mostly shot at Emelka in Munich {{in the fall}} of 1925, and the film exteriors were shot on location in Obergurgl, in what is now the municipality of Sölden in the State of Tyrol in southwestern Austria, the Ötztal Alps standing in for the mountains and hollows of Kentucky. Due to producing the film in Germany, Hitchcock had more directorial freedom than he would have had in England, and influences in the technique and style of German cinema <b>are</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> his early works.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{effects of}} light only {{last for a}} few minutes, thus the canvases documenting such ephemera {{received}} attention {{for no more than}} a few minutes a day. Further complicating matters, the light of subsequent sunrises, for example, could alter substantially and would require separate canvases within the series. Subsequently, different hues <b>are</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> each painting, and in each work, color is used to describe not only direct but reflected light. At differing times of day and in various seasons stacks absorb the light from diverse parts of the color spectrum. As a result, the residual light that is reflected off of the stacks is seen as ever-changing, and manifests in distinctive coloring.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began on}} May 5, 1931, under Brother Theophorus Kleemann, SVD, who became ill and died on September 12, 1931; Arthur Bialucha, a German {{architect}} living in Qingdao {{who had already}} completed several projects for the SVD, took over as construction superintendent. Construction was frustrated in 1933, when Adolf Hitler {{came to power in}} Germany and prohibited the transfer of money overseas. The diocese independently shouldered the cost of finishing the cathedral. This required a number of design changes to reduce costs. The changes <b>are</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> drawings published before completion of construction, which show the roofs of the towers as bell-shaped. However, the roofs of the completed structure were changed to spires. Construction was finished in 1934, and the cathedral was consecrated on October 28 that year.|$|E

5|$|Following the Stonewall riots, lesbian {{themes in}} {{literature}} {{became much more}} diverse and complex, and shifted the focus of lesbianism from erotica for heterosexual men to works written by and for lesbians. Feminist magazines such as The Furies, and Sinister Wisdom replaced The Ladder. Serious writers who used lesbian characters and plots included Rita Mae Brown's Rubyfruit Jungle (1973), which presents a feminist heroine who chooses to be a lesbian. Poet Audre Lorde confronts homophobia and racism in her works, and Cherríe Moraga is credited with being primarily responsible for bringing Latina perspectives to lesbian literature. Further changing values <b>are</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> the writings of Dorothy Allison, who focuses on child sexual abuse and deliberately provocative lesbian sadomasochism themes.|$|E
5|$|Much of the Leslie's unique tone {{is due to}} {{the fact}} that the system is at least {{partially}} enclosed, whereby linear louvres along the sides and front of the unit can vent the sound from within the box after the sound has bounced around inside, mellowing it. The crossover is deliberately set to 800Hz to give the optimum balance between the horn and the drum, and is considered an integral part of the speaker. The tone is also affected by the wood used. Tone differences, due to cost cutting using particle board for speaker and rotor shelves instead of the previous plywood, <b>are</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> the Leslie's sound. The thinner ply of the top of the cabinet adds a certain resonance as well. Like an acoustic instrument, a Leslie's tone is uniquely defined by its cabinet design and construction, the amplifier, crossover and speakers used, and the motors — not merely by the spinning of rotors.|$|E
5|$|The abdomen is {{composed}} of five somites, all of which lack appendages except the last. The back-facing margins of these somites bear small spines and four or more larger spines. The last abdominal somite forks {{into a pair of}} flattened spatulate appendages (the uropods) that function as a tail fan (caudal rami). In addition to stabilising the body while swimming, a quick flick of the tail fan can rapidly propel the animal backwards, which may have functioned as a means of escaping predators like in modern shrimp. Traces of four fused segments <b>are</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> the three faint lines dividing each lobe of the tail fan. A long telson is present {{at the end of the}} body. Traces of a rounded stomach, small digestive glands, and an intestine that terminates into a tiny anal opening on the telson can also be observed in some specimens.|$|E

5|$|The diverse {{origins of}} Malagasy culture <b>are</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> its {{tangible}} expressions. The most emblematic instrument of Madagascar, the valiha, is a bamboo tube zither carried to Madagascar by early settlers from southern Borneo, {{and is very}} similar in form {{to those found in}} Indonesia and the Philippines today. Traditional houses in Madagascar are likewise similar to those of southern Borneo in terms of symbolism and construction, featuring a rectangular layout with a peaked roof and central support pillar. Reflecting a widespread veneration of the ancestors, tombs are culturally significant in many regions and tend to be built of more durable material, typically stone, and display more elaborate decoration than the houses of the living. The production and weaving of silk {{can be traced back to}} the island's earliest settlers, and Madagascar's national dress, the woven lamba, has evolved into a varied and refined art.|$|E
