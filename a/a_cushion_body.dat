40|$|Skweezees {{are soft}} objects filled with {{conductive}} padding, which {{are capable of}} detecting different squeeze gestures using electrodes dispersed all over the object. This paper presents a case-study on the design and development of a tangible product based on the Skweezee system, namely <b>a</b> <b>cushion</b> remote. Squeeze-based gestures for soft user interfaces have rarely been explored. Therefore, we have worked on establishing squeeze-based gestures for <b>a</b> soft <b>cushion</b> interface for controlling a television, {{by means of a}} user-centered approach. The user study has brought out appropriate gestures for controlling <b>a</b> <b>cushion</b> remote. <b>A</b> prototype was designed using these gestures. The end result is <b>a</b> <b>cushion</b> remote that uses the Skweezee system and a gesture set for <b>a</b> Skweezee-based <b>cushion</b> remote control. status: accepte...|$|R

40|$|Placing <b>a</b> <b>cushion</b> {{between the}} {{expansive}} soil and {{the foundation is}} an attractive proposal for overcoming {{the problems associated with}} construction of structures over expansive soils such as Indian black cotton soil. Extensive studies on cohesive non-swelling soil as <b>a</b> <b>cushion</b> have shown that it is ineffective over cycles of swelling and shrinkage of soil. The present paper explores the possibility of using rice husk ash (RHA) as <b>a</b> <b>cushion.</b> It was found that RHA stabilised with 3 – 9 % of lime (LSR) or 10 % of cement (CSR) and cured for about a week develops the properties required for <b>an</b> effective <b>cushion</b> material. Stabilised RHA reduces the bandwidth of vertical movements in expansive soil not only during the first cycle of swelling but also during subsequent cycles of swelling and shrinkage. The reduction increases with the thickness of the cushion. However, it is found that the middle level between the equilibrium swollen and equilibrium shrunken levels, called the operating level, decreases with the use of LSR/CSR as <b>a</b> <b>cushion.</b> LSR is more effective than CSR...|$|R

5000|$|To avoid {{running out}} of money because {{expenses}} occur before the money actually arrives (known as a cash flow problem in business jargon) a [...] "safety cushion" [...] of excess cash (to cover those months when actual income is below estimations) should be established. There is no easy way to develop <b>a</b> safety <b>cushion,</b> so families frequently have to spend less than they earn until they have accumulated <b>a</b> <b>cushion.</b> This can be a challenging task particularly when starting during a low spot in the earning cycle, although this is how most budgets begin. In general, households that start out with expenses that are 5% or 10% below their average income should slowly develop <b>a</b> <b>cushion</b> of savings that can be accessed when earnings are below average. Whether this rate of building <b>a</b> <b>cushion</b> is fast enough for a given financial situation depends on how variable income is, and whether the budgeting process starts at a high or low point during the earnings cycles.|$|R
