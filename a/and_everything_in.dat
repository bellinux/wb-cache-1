Durand de Huesca, responding to a Cathar tract c.1220 indicates that they regarded the physical world as the creation of Satan.

25|$|In Book 2, {{electricity}} and gravity {{are described as}} fundamental forces of the will.

The fundamental nature of the universe <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> it is seen as this will. Schopenhauer presents a pessimistic picture on which unfulfilled desires are painful, and pleasure is merely the sensation experienced at the instant one such pain is removed. However, most desires are never fulfilled, and those that are fulfilled are instantly replaced by more unfulfilled ones.|$|E

In the Changsega, Mireuk makes the world <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> it, while in the Chogamje, Dosu Munjang makes only the world, the suns, and the moons. Throughout Korea, myths tell of Mireuk (Northern Korea), the Humun brothers (Central Korea), or Daebyeol (Southern Korea), who destroyed {{each of the two}} suns and moons.

25|$|In the beginning, {{the great}} God Zurvan existed alone. Desiring {{offspring}} {{that would create}} “heaven and hell <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> between”, Zurvan sacrificed for a thousand years. Towards {{the end of this}} period, androgyne Zurvan began to doubt the efficacy of sacrifice and in the moment of this doubt Ohrmuzd and Ahriman were conceived: Ohrmuzd for the sacrifice and Ahriman for the doubt. Upon realizing that twins were to be born, Zurvan resolved to grant the first-born sovereignty over creation. Ohrmuzd perceived Zurvan’s decision, which He then communicated to His brother. Ahriman then preempted Ohrmuzd by ripping open the womb to emerge first. Reminded of the resolution to grant Ahriman sovereignty, Zurvan conceded, but limited kingship to a period of 9000years, after which Ohrmuzd would rule for all eternity (Zaehner, 1955:419-428).|$|E
25|$|The {{classical}} Advaita Vedanta explains all reality <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> {{the experienced}} {{world to be}} same as the Brahman. To Advaitins, there is a unity in multiplicity, {{and there is no}} dual hierarchy of a Creator and the created universe. All objects, all experiences, all matter, all consciousness, all awareness, in Advaita philosophy is not the property but the very nature of this one fundamental reality Brahman. With this premise, the Advaita school states that any ontological effort must presuppose a knowing self, and this effort needs to explain all empirical experiences such as the projected reality while one dreams during sleep, and the observed multiplicity of living beings. This Advaita does by positing its theory of three levels of reality, the theory of two truths, and by developing and integrating these ideas with its theory of errors (anirvacaniya khyati).|$|E
