It is an extremely simple device consisting of a sacrificial graphite composite rod, approximately the diameter of a pencil with a length of about five inches. The sacrificial rod is constructed with the graphite fibers running axially within the rod {{in a manner that}} best provides a path of conduction axially from the trailing edge of an aircraft to the trailing end of the rod. The sacrificial rod is inserted into an <b>attachment</b> <b>hole</b> machined into trailing edges of aircraft flight surfaces, such as a vertical fin cap and attached with adhesive in a manner not prohibiting the conduction path between the rod and the aircraft.

40|$|This is {{the final}} report for the {{actuator}} bracket/lug fracture mechanics qualification test. The test plan (CTP- 0071) outlined a two-phase test program designed {{to answer questions about}} the fracture criticality of the redesigned solid rocket motor (RSRM) nozzle actuator bracket. An analysis conducted using the NASA/FLAGRO fracture mechanics computer program indicated that the actuator bracket might be a fracture critical component. In the NASA/FLAGRO analysis, a simple lug model was used to represent the actuator bracket. It was calculated that the bracket would fracture if subjected to an actuator stall load {{in the presence of a}} 0. 10 in. corner crack at the actuator <b>attachment</b> <b>hole.</b> The 0. 10 in. crack size corresponds to the nondestructive inspection detectability limit for the actuator bracket. The inspection method used is the dye penetrant method. The actuator stall load (103, 424 lb) is the maximum load which the actuator bracket is required to withstand during motor operation. This testing was designed to establish the accuracy of the analytical model and to directly determine whether the actuator bracket is capable of meeting fracture mechanics safe-life requirements...|$|R

50|$|The Schela Cladovei {{culture is}} known through the nine open air {{settlements}} in {{the proximity of the}} Danube.

A plasmonic metallic core is employed for light capture and local electro-magnetic field enhancement.

40|$|The paper {{delivers}} {{a critical review}} of the research data on the crack initiation and crack growth patterns characteristic {{of the components of}} the spline-bolted joints between the propeller shaft and reducer shaft at An- 24, An- 26, and Il- 18 aircrafts. Cracks in the shafts nucleated because of reduced bolt-fastening force. Actually, the bolt (bolts) failed first (also by fatigue) and then fatigue cracks nucleated and grew in the shafts, the spline surface fretting zones and/or sharp edges of the <b>attachment</b> (bolt-conducting) <b>holes</b> making the crack origin sites. The crack growth history shows itself through the regular Macro-Beach Marks, each mark sequentially pointing to the next loading event of the propeller shaft, i. e., to each next flight. The cracks cease growing for some while in the airscrews and their shafts just replaced to another aircraft. For the airscrew shafts, the critically assessed data show the crack growth period Np ranging as five to ten percent of a total running period Nf. We recommend performing nondestructive inspection of the airscrew shafts on every 250 - hour running period to ensure the safety flights...|$|R

Schliemann, Orchomenos, Leipzig 1881) {{revealed the}} tholos tomb {{he called the}} [...] "Tomb of Minyas", a Mycenaean monument that equalled the [...] "Tomb of Atreus" [...] at Mycenae itself. In 1893, A. de Ridder excavated the temple of Asklepios and some burials in the Roman necropolis. In 1903-05, a Bavarian archaeological mission under Heinrich Bulle and Adolf Furtwängler conducted successful excavations at the site. Research continued in 1970-73 by the Archaeological Service under Theodore Spyropoulos, uncovering the Mycenaean palace, a prehistoric cemetery, the theatre and other structures.The Tomb of Minyas {{is one of the}} greatest burial monuments of the Mycenaean period. The tomb was probably built for the members of the royal family of Orchomenos in 1250 BC and was plundered in antiquity. The monument was visible for many centuries after its original use and even became a place of worship in the Hellenistic period. It was probably a famous landmark until at least the second century AD, when Pausanias visited Orchomenos and described the tholos in detail. It had a dromos thirty metres long. Its entrance was built of dark grey Levadhia marble and had a wooden door. The lintel, still in place today, is six metres long and weighs several tons. The entrance and the chamber were decorated with bronze rosettes as shown by the <b>attachment</b> <b>holes</b> on the walls and the ceiling of the side chamber is decorated with spirals and floral motifs in relief. In the centre of the Tholos, a rectangular burial monument dates to the Ηellenistic period (323-30 B.C.). It was partially restored by the architect-archaeologist A. Orlandos. In 1994, the Hellenic Ministry of Culture undertook restoration work consisting mainly of drainage and strengthening of the walls of the side chamber.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} on film cooling holes with plasma actuators are performed for circular hole, expansion-shaped hole and fan-shaped {{hole on the}} surface of flat plate. The results are compared with those obtained from the same combination of varied shaped holes without plasma actuator. Computational results suggest that plasma-induced body force mitigates the intensity of the counter rotating vortex pair by creating a new pair of vortexes, thereby providing greater coolant-surface <b>attachment</b> for each <b>hole</b> shape, resulting in the improvement of film cooling effectiveness. As for the holes of varied shapes with plasma actuator, the expansion-shaped hole shows superior laterally averaged film cooling effectiveness to that of the circular hole. Comparing with the abovementioned two shaped holes, the fan-shaped one performs worse in terms of laterally averaged film cooling effectiveness at low blow ratios, and better at high blow ratios. The fan-shaped hole also provides the best uniformity of film cooling effectiveness among all cases...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{simplified}} density functional theory (DFT) method to com- pute vertical electron and <b>hole</b> <b>attachment</b> energies to frontier orbitals of molecules absorbed on insulating films {{supported by a}} metal substrate. The adsorbate and the film is treated fully within DFT, whereas the metal is treated implicitly by a perfect conductor model. As illustrated for a pentacene molecule adsorbed on NaCl films sup- ported by a Cu substrate, {{we find that the}} computed energy gap between the highest and lowest occupied molecular orbitals - HOMO and LUMO -from the vertical attach- ment energies increases with the thickness of the insulating film, in agreement with experiments. This increase of the gap can be rationalized in a simple dielectric model with parameters determined from DFT calculations and is found to be dominated by the image interaction with the metal. However, this model overestimates the down- ward shift of the energy gap in the limit of an infinitely thick film. This work provides a new and efficient strategy to extend the use of density functional theory to the study of charging and discharging of large molecular absorbates on insulating films supported by a metal substrate...|$|R
40|$|Residual {{stresses}} have {{a significant}} impact on fatigue and fracture of engineering components and structures, with an effect that is largely dependent on the sign of the residual stress relative to that of the applied stress, i. e. on whether they add to, or subtract from, the applied stress. The present paper will emphasise the importance of detailed knowledge of residual stresses to applications in thermal power generation. The context of the examples is condition monitoring and repair procedures where assessment of the influence of residual stress fields is important to both fatigue and fracture performance, and to certification of the repair procedure itself. The main conclusion in the paper is that the innovative use of solid-state friction taper hydro-pillar processes can offer additional capability in condition monitoring of through-thickness creep damage in thermal power plant, as well as provide cost-effective local repair of creep or fatigue damage in, for example, thick-walled steam pipe and blade-disc <b>attachment</b> <b>holes...</b>|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIn the E- 2 C Hawkeye's wing center section, stress fractures {{have been identified}} in the main beam web section. The cracks occurred in several web section <b>attachment</b> <b>holes.</b> Previous work, concerned with fatigue data, used a finite element code to design a specimen which modeled the actual section of the beam at one particular fastener hole near wing station 49. Acoustic emission testing was used to determine if crack initiation could be identified. In this work, acoustic emission techniques were applied to the monitoring of multiple cracks. The E- 2 C fatigue spectrum was used to load the specimens but fatigue testing was not an objective. Specimens were modified by drilling holes and attaching angles that represented the structural shapes used to attach the section to the wing skin. The original one-hole configuration and the new multiple hole specimen configuration were tested. The cap angles were found to create a great deal of noise containing frequency components below 400 kHz. Special high pass filters were fabricated which eliminated most of this noise. It was shown that linear location could be used to discriminate between crack growth signals and the filtered noise signals. [URL] United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|The {{acoustic}} liner system {{designed for use}} in the High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) was tested in a thermal-acoustic environment. Five ceramic matrix composite (CMC) acoustic tile configurations, five bulk acoustic absorbers, and one thermal protection system design were tested. The CMC acoustic tiles were subjected to two 2 3 / 4 hr ambient temperature acoustic exposures to measure their dynamic response. One exposure was conducted on the tiles alone and the second exposure included the tiles and the T-foam bulk absorber. The measured tile RMS strains were small. With or without the T-foam absorber, the dynamic strains were below strain levels that would cause damage during fatigue loading. After the ambient exposure, a 75 -hr durability test of the entire {{acoustic liner}} system was conducted using a thermal-acoustic cycle that approximated the anticipated service cycle. Acoustic loads up to 139 dB/Hz and temperatures up to 1670 F (910 C) were employed during this 60 cycle test. During the durability test, the CMC tiles were exposed to temperatures up to 1780 F and a transient through thickness gradient up to 490 F. The TPS peak temperatures on the hot side of the panels ranged from 750 to 1000 F during the 60 cycles. The through thickness delta T ranged from 450 to 650 F, varying with TPS location and cycle number. No damage, such as cracks or chipping, was observed in the CMC tiles after completion of the testing. However, on tile warped during the durability test and was replaced after 43 or 60 cycles. No externally observed damage was found in this tile. No failure of the CMC fasteners occurred, but damage was observed. Cracks and missing material occurred, only in the fastener head region. No indication of damage was observed in the T-foam acoustic absorbers. The SiC foam acoustic absorber experienced damage after about 43 cycles. Cracking in the TPS occurred around the <b>attachment</b> <b>holes</b> and under a vent. In spite of the development of damage, the TPS maintained its insulative capability throughout the durability test. The durability test results demonstrate damage-tolerant CMC tile, CMC fastener, TPS, and T-foam absorber designs for the combined thermal and acoustic engine nozzle environment...|$|E
5000|$|William Friedman, {{director}} of the US Army's Signals Intelligence Service, devised a system to correct for this attack by truly randomizing {{the motion of the}} rotors. His modification consisted of a paper tape reader from a teletype machine attached to a small device with metal [...] "feelers" [...] positioned to pass electricity through the holes. When a letter was pressed on the keyboard the signal would be sent through the rotors {{as it was in the}} Enigma, producing an encrypted version. In addition, the current would also flow through the paper tape <b>attachment,</b> and any <b>holes</b> in the tape at its current location would cause the corresponding rotor to turn, and then advance the paper tape one position. In comparison, the Enigma rotated its rotors one position with each key press, a much less random movement. The resulting design went into limited production as the M-134, and its message settings included the position of the tape and the settings of a plugboard that indicated which line of holes on the tape controlled which rotors. However, there were problems using fragile paper tapes under field conditions.|$|R
