40|$|Background: Haplotyping is an {{important}} technique in molecular diagnostics because haplotypes are often more predictive for individual phenotypes than are the underlying single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Until recently, methods for haplotyping SNPs separated by kilobase distances were laborious and not applicable to high-throughput screening. In the case of thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT), differentiating among TPMT* 3 A, * 3 B, and * 3 C alleles is sometimes necessary for predictive genotyping. Methods: The genomic region including the two SNPs that define TPMT* 3 A, * 3 B, and * 3 C alleles was amplified by long-range PCR. The resulting PCR product was circularized by ligation and haplotyped by <b>allele-specific</b> <b>amplification</b> PCR followed by product identification with hybridization probes. Results: Critical points were the long-range PCR conditions, including choice of buffer and primers, optimization of the ligation reaction, and selection of primers that allowed for strict <b>allele-specific</b> <b>amplification</b> in the second-round PCR. Different underlying TPMT haplotypes could then be differentiated. Results from the haplotyping method were in full agreement with those from our standard real-time PCR method: TPMT* 1 /* 3 A (n � 20); TPMT* 1 /* 3 C (n � 4); TPMT* 1 /* 1 (n � 6); and TPMT* 3 A/* 3 A (n � 6). One TPMT* 1 /* 3 A sample failed to amplify, and no whole blood was available for repeat DNA isolation. Conclusions: This method for rapid cycle real-time, <b>allele-specific</b> <b>amplification</b> PCR-assisted long-range haplotyping has general application for the haplotyping of distant SNPs. The procedure is simpler and mor...|$|E
40|$|Although {{prenatal}} diagnosis {{has reduced the}} number of beta-thalassaemia births, pregnancy termination is still unacceptable for many couples. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis carried out on the third day after in-vitro fertilization offers an alternative. Here we describe the detection of selected beta-thalassaemia mutations in intron I at the single cell level by the application of nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and silver stained single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. A total of 294 single somatic cells of different types was amplified with 96 % success and all tested mutations in homozygous and heterozygous form were identified correctly. None of the heterozygous or compound heterozygous samples showed any <b>allele-specific</b> <b>amplification</b> failure after the beta-globin gene amplification from single cells. To assess the efficiency of nested PCR on single blastomeres prior to clinical application, 10 single blastomeres were amplified and gave the expected normal pattern when analysed by SSCP. The main advantage of SSCP, particularly for preimplantation diagnosis, is that it allows the direct visualization of each allele and provides a simple means of assessing <b>allele-specific</b> <b>amplification</b> failure. Our results show that the combination of nested PCR and automated silver stained SSCP analysis offers exceptional resolution, accuracy and speed which are essential for preimplantation diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|An <b>allele-specific</b> <b>amplification</b> method {{based on}} two genetic polymorphisms to {{differentiate}} Mycobacterium tuberculosis from Mycobacterium bovis was tested. Based on the differences found at position 169 in the pncA genes from M. tuberculosis and M. bovis, a PCR system which was able to differentiate most of the 237 M. tuberculosis complex isolates tested {{in one of the}} two species was developed. All 121 M. tuberculosis strains showed the expected base (cytosine) at position 169. Most of the M. bovis isolates had a guanine at the cited position. Nevertheless, 18 of the 116 M. bovis isolates, all of them goat isolates, showed the pncA polymorphism specific to M. tuberculosis. These results suggest that goat M. bovis may be the nicotinamidase-missing link at the origin of the M. tuberculosis species. Based on the polymorphism found at position 285 in the oxyR gene, the same system was used to differentiate M. tuberculosis from M. bovis. In this case, DNAs from all 121 M. tuberculosis isolates had the expected base (guanine) at this position. In addition, all 116 M. bovis isolates, including those from goats, showed the identical polymorphism (adenine). The oxyR <b>allele-specific</b> <b>amplification</b> method can differentiate M. bovis from M. tuberculosis, is rapid (results can be obtained in less than 3 h), and is easy to perform...|$|E

40|$|Chromosomal {{gains and}} losses {{comprise}} an important type of genetic change in tumors, and can now be assayed using microarray hybridization-based experiments. Most current statistical models for DNA copy number estimate total copy number, which do not distinguish between the underlying quantities of the two inherited chromosomes.

40|$|Casework samples {{collected}} for forensic DNA analysis can produce genomic mixtures {{in which the}} DNA of the alleged offender is masked by high quantities of DNA coming from the victim. DIP-STRs are novel genetic markers specifically developed to enable the target analysis of a DNA {{of interest in the}} presence of exceeding quantities of a second DNA (up to 1000 -fold). The genotyping system, which is based on <b>allele-specific</b> <b>amplifications</b> of haplotypes formed by a deletion/insertion polymorphism (DIP) and a short tandem repeat (STR), combines the capacity of targeting the DNA of an individual with a strong identification power. Finally, DIP-STRs are autosomal markers therefore they can be applied to any combination of major and minor DNA. In this study we aimed to assess the ability of DIP-STRs to detect the minor contributor on challenging "touch" DNA samples simulated with representative crime-associated substrates and to compare their performance to commonly used male-specific markers (Y-STRs). As part of a comprehensive study on the relative DNA contribution of two persons handling the same object, we selected 71 unbalanced contact traces of which 14 comprised a male minor DNA contributor mixed to a female major DNA contributor. Using a set of six DIP-STRs, one to four markers were found to be informative for the minor DNA detection across traces. When compared to Y-STRs (14 traces), the DIP-STRs showed similar sensitivity in detecting the minor DNA across substrate materials with a similar occurrence of allele drop-out. Conversely, because of the sex combination of the two users of the object, 57 remaining traces could only be investigated by DIP-STRs. Of these, 30 minor DNA contributors could be detected by all informative markers while 12 traces showed events of allele drop-out. Finally, 15 traces showed no amplification of the minor DNA. These last 15 samples were mostly characterized by a combination of short handling time of the object, low DNA recovery and/or one single informative DIP-STR. In conclusion, the DIP-STRs represent alternative markers to help solving unbalanced two-source DNA mixtures, and also those produced from contact stains. These markers, in addition to a novel set of 10 DIP-STRs specifically developed according to forensic technical standards, will offer a valuable tool complementary to Y-STR markers...|$|R

If part of the thrombus breaks off, it becomes an embolism, which can travel through the heart and block the arteries to the lungs. Factor V Leiden (FVL) is a common genetic risk factor for hereditary hypercoagulability disorder in several populations. The present study investigates the association of FVL mutation with DVT among Egyptian cases. Patients & methods: The study included 44 cases (16 males and 28 females) with an age range of 20 to 80 years in addition to 211 healthy unrelated controls of matched age and sex. A multiplex <b>allele-specific</b> PCR <b>amplification</b> was conducted for assignment of FVL gene mutation (G 1691 A). Results: Cases having the mutant allele A (AA and AG genotypes) {{were significantly higher than}} controls (38. 6 % vs. 18. 5 %; P < 0. 05, OR= 2. 78 and CI 95 %, 1. 380 ­ 5. 589). Conclusion: These results concluded that FVL mutation has a high frequency and positive association with the occurrence of deep {{vein thrombosis}} among Egyptian case...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background A {{significant}} {{genetic component}} {{has been described}} for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The R 131 H (rs 1801274) polymorphism of the IgG receptor FcγRIIa determines receptor affinity for IgG subclasses and is associated with several chronic inflammatory diseases. We investigated whether this polymorphism is associated with IPF susceptibility or progression. Methods In a case-control study, we compared the distribution of FcγRIIa R 131 H genotypes in 142 patients with IPF and in 218 controls using <b>allele-specific</b> PCR <b>amplification.</b> Results No differences {{in the frequency of}} FcγRIIa genotypes were evident between IPF patients and control subjects. However, significantly impaired pulmonary function at diagnosis was observed in HH compared to RR homozygotes, with evidence of more severe restriction (reduced forced vital capacity (FVC)) and lower diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (D L CO). Similarly, increased frequency of the H 131 allele was observed in patients with severe disease (D L CO 10 % drop in FVC and/or > 15 % fall in D L CO at 12 months after baseline (0. 48 vs. 0. 33; p = 0. 023). Conclusions These findings support an association between the FcγRIIa R 131 H polymorphism and IPF severity and progression, supporting the involvement of immunological mechanisms in IPF pathogenesis. </p...|$|R
40|$|Using the {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} followed by single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis and direct nucleotide sequence determination, the p 53 gene was analyzed in six fresh leukemia samples from which cell lines with p 53 mutations were established. Mutations of the p 53 gene which were identical {{to those in the}} cell lines were observed in three of the fresh samples. In the other three samples, p 53 gene mutations were not detected by the conventional PCR-SSCP method. However, when analyzed using <b>allele-specific</b> gene <b>amplification,</b> less than 10 % of the leukemic cell population of the three samples, which were below the detection threshold of PCR-SSCP, were shown to have p 53 gene mutations. Two samples taken at the initial presentation of two patients, whose relapse samples were shown to contain p 53 mutant clones, were also available for analysis. A small population of clonal cells, comprising less than 1 % of the population, was shown to have p 53 gene mutations in both of these initial samples. These observations provide a potential biologic basis for the frequent findings of p 53 mutations in leukemia cell lines and also suggest a potential role for p 53 mutations in the clonal overgrowth of cells responsible for relapse of the disease. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
