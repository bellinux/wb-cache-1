In some individuals they induce dramatic behavioural changes such as increased aggression, anxiety and depression. The mechanisms behind these behavioural changes are still poorly understood. In order to obtain information on the brain regions affected by <b>anabolic</b> <b>androgenic</b> <b>steroids,</b> the distribution of neurons containing c-Fos, the protein product of the immediate early gene c-fos, and Fos-related antigens was studied following chronic treatment of guinea-pigs with a high dose of nandrolone decanoate (15 mg/kg i. m. daily for 14 days). The behaviour of the guinea-pigs was monitored for 1 h each day. Animals treated with nandrolone exhibited a significantly greater incidence of biting behaviour during the 14 day treatment period than vehicletreated animals. A significantly greater density of c-Fos and Fos-related antigen-positive neurons was found in the central nucleus of the amygdala, and of Fos-related antigen-positive neurons in the frontal cortex, the shell of the nucleus accumbens and the supraoptic nucleus in nandrolone-treated animals than in vehicle controls. Therefore, nandrolone induced Fos in brain regions involved in stress, behavioural responses and reward.

40|$|Data {{in animal}} models and surveys in humans have {{revealed}} psychiatric complications of long-term <b>anabolic</b> <b>androgenic</b> <b>steroid</b> abuse. However, the neurobiochemical mechanisms behind the observed behavioral changes are poorly understood. The {{aim of the}} present study was to investigate the effects of nandrolone decanoate on emotional behavior and neurochemical brain alterations in gonadally intact male rats. The behavioral reactivity to the elevated plus maze and the social interaction test was used to assess anxiety-related symptoms, and the sucrose preference test was used to evaluate anhedonia. Dopaminergic, serotonergic and noradrenergic transmissions were also evaluated in selected brain areas. The chronic administration of nandrolone, at 5 mg kg(- 1) injected daily for 4 weeks, induced the loss of sweet taste preference, a sign of anhedonia and dysfunction of the reward pathway. The behavioral outcomes were accompanied by reductions in the dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline contents in the nucleus accumbens. Alterations in the time spent in the open arms and in the social interaction test were not found, suggesting that nandrolone did not induce an anxiogenic profile. No differences were revealed between the experimental groups in the amygdala in terms of the neurotransmitters measured. Our data suggest that nandrolone-treated rats have a depressive, but not anxiogenic-like, profile, accompanied by brain region-dependent changes in dopaminergic, serotonergic and noradrenergic neurotransmission.

40|$|Introduction: A {{variety of}} {{clinical}} conditions are complicated by loss of weight and skeletal muscle which {{may contribute to}} morbidity and mortality. <b>Anabolic</b> <b>androgenic</b> <b>steroids</b> have been demonstrated to increase fat-free mass, muscle mass and strength in healthy men and women without major adverse events and therefore could be beneficial in these conditions. Areas covered: This review {{provides an overview of}} clinical trials with <b>anabolic</b> <b>androgenic</b> <b>steroids</b> in the treatment of chronic diseases including HIV-wasting, chronic renal failure, chronic obstructive lung disease, muscular disease, alcoholic liver disease, burn injuries and post operative recovery. Relevant studies were identified in PubMed (years 1950 - 2010), bibliographies of the identified studies and the Cochrane database. Expert opinion: Although the beneficial effects of AAS in chronic disorders are promising, clinically relevant endpoints such as quality of life, improved physical functioning and survival were mainly missing or not significant, except for burn injuries. Therefore, more studies are needed to confirm their long term safety and efficacy. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Background and objective: <b>Anabolic</b> <b>androgenic</b> <b>steroids</b> are {{synthetic}} compounds {{based on}} the structure of testosterone, and are used to treat various conditions such as reproductive system dysfunction. High doses of <b>anabolic</b> <b>androgenic</b> <b>steroids</b> and exercise influence the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis, which can, in turn, affect testicular apoptosis. This study aimed to investigate the influence of <b>anabolic</b> <b>androgenic</b> <b>steroids</b> on semen parameters in bodybuilders (heavy exercise) in Erbil city. Methods: Semen specimens and serum were collected from 150 which divided into three groups; each consists of 50 men. The control group (A) didn't practice exercise so didn't receive nandrolone. The exercise group (B) who practice daily without taking nandrolone. The exercise and treated group (C) who practice exercise and had been using nandrolone (200 mg- wk- 1, intramuscularly) for at least three months. Smear prepared by methyline blue stain and assessment of semen volume, sperm morphology, sperm concentration,motility were carried out. Serum levels of follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and testosterone were also carried out. Results: There was no difference in the semen volume within three groups. Sperm concentration and the percentage of sperm motility in the group C was significantly lower (P < 0. 001) than that in the other groups. A significantly increased percentage of sperm with the tapered head was found in the group C.

40|$|<b>Anabolic</b> <b>{{androgen}}ic</b> <b>steroids,</b> a {{class of}} steroid hormones related to testosterone, are natural ligands of androgen receptor (AR), {{a member of the}} nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors.

The effects of androgens can differ depending on the target cells and/or tissues.

Experimental design: Twenty-five healthy male volunteers aged 27 – 43 years were given 500 mg, 250 mg, and 125 mg of testosterone enanthate as single intramuscular doses of Testoviron® Depot. Luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), blood lipid profile (total cholesterol, plasma [p-] low-density lipoprotein, p-high-density lipoprotein [HDL], p-apolipoprotein A 1 [ApoA 1], p-apolipoprotein B, p-triglycerides, p-lipoprotein(a), serum [s-] testosterone, and 25 -hydroxyvitamin D 3) were analyzed prior to, and 4 and 14 days after dosing. Testosterone and epitestosterone in urine (testosterone/epitestosterone ratio) were analyzed prior to each dose after a washout period of 6 – 8 weeks. Results and discussion: All doses investigated suppressed the LH and FSH concentrations in serum. LH remained suppressed 6 weeks after the 500 mg dose. These results indicate that testosterone has a more profound endocrine effect on the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis than was previously thought. There was no alteration in 25 -hydroxyvitamin D 3 levels after testosterone administration compared to baseline levels. The 250 and 500 mg doses induced decreased concentrations of ApoA 1 and HDL, whereas the lowest dose (125 mg) {{did not have any}} effect on the lipid profile. Conclusion: The single doses of testosterone produced a dose-dependent increase in serum testosterone concentrations together with suppression of s-LH and s-FSH. Alterations in ApoA 1 and HDL were observed after the two highest single doses.

For collection of data interviews were made. The six respondents al had experience of use of AAS. The interviews illustrated how users of AAS speak about AAS, and create there identity, in relation to AAS. In the interpretation of data we used two different tools, used by discursive psychologists, interpretative repertoires and subject positions. Though the interpretative repertoires we were able to separate the ways the respondents construct there statements. Subject positions made it possible for us to interpret where the respondents did place themselves in there speech. Other perspectives, derived from literature on the subject AAS, was brought into the analysis. Other perspectives provide us with assumptions and make it possible to separate themes and discourses from the data. Two discourses where separated from data, restrictive discourse and legal discourse. The discourses contain three teams, use/abuse, physical risks and social risks. In the speech, respondents, relate to these teams in order to construct there identities. The respondents construct the speech in order to make use of AAS reasonable to them selves. The respondents construct the speech in the direction towards a liberal discourse. They construct the use of AAS as reasonable to them selves. The respondents make mostly difference between use and abuse of AAS and don’t position them selves as abusers of AAS without reservations.
