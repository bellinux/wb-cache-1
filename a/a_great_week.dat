However, he was {{defeated}} in the second round by Damir Dzumhur 46 36 64 26. Baghdatis' grass court campaign began in Stuttgart, where despite losing, he showed encouraging signs in his loss to superstar Rafael Nadal, by 67(5) 76(4) 26. This promise was fulfilled in an incredible week of ball striking at Nottingham. Baghdatis stunned world number 7 David Ferrer 62 76(4), young gun Alexander Zverev and Simone Bolleli to his way to the semi-finals. However, Baghdatis, with an early break ahead against Denis Istomin, was forced to retire hurt after feeling a 'pop' in his calf muscle.

5000|$|Take Charge Brandi {{was then}} sent to California to contest the thirty-first running of the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies over one and one sixteenth of a mile at Santa Anita Park on November 1.

The Chandelier Stakes winner Angela Renee started as the favorite ahead of Conquest Eclipse, Puca, Cristina's Journey and Top Decile. Espinoza sent his mount into the lead soon after the start and set the pace from By The Moon, Feathered and Hennythelovepenny. She maintained her advantage into the straight with Feathered, Wonder Gal and Danette as her closest pursuers and many of the more fancied fillies beginning to struggle. Espinoza never had to resort to using his whip as Take Charge Brandi kept on in the closing stages to win by half a length from the fast-finishing Top Decile, with Wonder Gal, Feathered and Danette close behind in third, fourth and fifth. After the race Espinoza said [...] "Wayne just told me to let her run and I did that. I hit her once and she didn't seem to like it, so I didn't hit her anymore and I just let her do her thing."

Preschoolers ’ Desire Understanding and its Relation to Prosocial Behavior 3 Theory of mind in humans allows for communication, interaction and socialization. Through the development of a theory of mind children understand first that others have desires, and after this an understanding of belief develops, resulting in a complete theory of mind. The present study investigates the desire portion of theory of mind and its relationship to the amount and quality of prosocial behaviors preschool children engage in, as measured by teachers and parents. Prosocial behavior and desire understanding were significantly correlated, when prosocial actions were rated by teachers, while parent ratings of prosocial behavior were not related to levels of desire understanding. The effects of age, gender and classroom designation on prosocial behavior and desire understanding are examined and implications for future research are discussed...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} occupational therapy (OT) practitioners’ and OT students’ {{perceptions of the}} importance of 12 specific OT-related entry-level competency skills and the number of weeks required to consistently demonstrate skills for entry-level competency. The results indicated that, on average, practitioners (n = 39) and students (n = 38) agreed that all of the items were important. However, the students had significantly higher ratings regarding the importance of communication, occupation and client-centered goals, time management, interventions, and use of theory and evidence. They also rated a higher number of minimum weeks required to consistently demonstrate entry-level competency. The students who rated use of theory and evidence higher also rated <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> number of <b>weeks</b> to consistently demonstrate entry-level competency (Pearson r =. 38; p=. 02). The practitioners who rated psychosocial factors higher also rated <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> number of <b>weeks</b> to consistently demonstrate entry-level competency (Pearson r =. 33, p =. 04).

40|$|The University of Notre Dame Australia, Fremantle Campus’ mixed Netball team {{recently}} won their competition at this year’s Australian University Games (AUGs) on the Gold Coast in Queensland. Another two Notre Dame teams, the formidable Rugby 7 s from Fremantle {{and a new}} mixed Netball team from the Sydney Campus, also competed. The Fremantle Netball team, competing in division two, remained undefeated to win the final, 51 - 26, over Deakin University. The win earns the side a promotion into division one next year. Captain, Fiona Paige, said the AUGs were a huge success for the mixed Netball team {{both on and off}} the field. “Going through the competition undefeated and bringing home the gold medals after beating Deakin University felt great. All game, every game, the team worked tirelessly and put in 100 % no matter what the score. “We had a great bunch of students on and off the court. The Gold Coast was the perfect place to hold the Games and everyone got into the spirit of the event. We got to know students from the Sydney Campus and overall it was <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>week</b> of sport and fun,” said Ms Paige. The Sydney Netball team were equally impressive with a win - loss record of 5 - 3 and finishing 13 th in the same division. This was the fifth consecutive appearance of a Notre Dame Rugby 7 s team at the AUGs. They put in a brave performance finishing 4 th over all after losing a ‘tight battle’ against Macquarie University in the bronze medal match. Manager of the Student Life Office, Dave McLean, said all the students participating in the games really enjoyed playing sport for Notre Dame and getting to know students from different campuses. “One of the highlights of the week was the unity displayed between students from the Sydney and Fremantle campuses. Despite studying on opposite sides of the country, the camaraderie shown between the students made it seem as though they were from the same classroom. “It was a fantastic week and all students are to be congratulated for their superb performances on the field and the sportsmanship displayed throughout,” said Mr McLean.

Materials and Methods: Patients with urinary frequency (8 micturitions or greater per 24 hours), urge incontinence (5 episodes or <b>greater</b> <b>a</b> <b>week)</b> and symptoms of overactive bladder for 6 months or greater were randomized to treatment with 4 mg tolterodine ER once daily or placebo for 12 weeks.

40|$|There is a {{need for}} {{materials}} that are well suited for cartilage tissue engineering. Hydrogels have emerged as promising biomaterials for cartilage repair, since, like cartilage, they have high water content, and they allow cells to be encapsulated within the material in a genuinely three-dimensional microenvironment. In this study, we investigated the mechanical properties of tissue-engineered cartilage constructs using in vitro culture models incorporating human chondrocytes from osteoarthritis patients. We evaluated hydrogels formed from mixtures of photocrosslinkable gelatin-methacrylamide (Gel-MA) and varying concentrations (0 – 2 %) of hyaluronic acid methacrylate (HA-MA).
