As {{a nationally recognized}} figure - in 1906 he received invitation to the Academy - he was an asset the party could not have <b>afforded</b> <b>to</b> <b>ignore,</b> though the claimant remained suspicious and the new party leader, Matías Barrio y Mier, was determined to impose total loyalty. De Mella developed particular dislike towards him, in private sparing his jefe little insult. Apart from personal enmity, the two clashed in terms of political strategy, as de Mella first demonstrated what would later become a trademark of Mellismo: a penchant for maximalist extreme-Right coalitions. Following death of Barrio in early 1909 de Mella campaigned to have Cerralbo restored as leader and was furious to see Bartolomé Feliú appointed instead; some considered also himself a possible candidate.Following 1909 death of Carlos VII his son as the new Carlist king found himself pressed to dismiss Feliú; he opted for a compromise, confirming the nomination but appointing de Mella his own personal secretary. He was called to Frohsdorf to prepare something like a new Acta de Loredan, but relations did not go smoothly, the two developing suspicions versus each other. After a joint trip to Rome in May 1910 de Mella was replaced with Artero Samaniego, disillusioned - rather mutually - with his new monarch. During the next 2 years the group, already dubbed Mellistas, sabotaged Jefe Delegado, in 1910 openly promoting non-dynastic ultra-conservative coalitions against Feliú-approved accords strictly conditioned by dynastic claims. Constantly dubbing Feliú as incompetent leader, in 1912 Mella decided to launch a full-scale onslaught; he accused jefe delegado of illegitimately holding the jefatura and demanded his deposition, in private threatening the claimant with rejecting his rule as deprived of [...] "legitimacy of execution". Don Jaime gave in {{and by the end}} of 1912 he re-appointed de Cerralbo as president of Junta Superior.|$|R

40|$|The {{longest and}} most mysterious New Testament {{interpolation}} is without doubt the Pericope Adulterae (PA) in the Gospel of John 7, 53 - 8, 11. Although scholars have puzzled {{about it for}} centuries, many questions concerning the origins, textual history and canonisation still remain unanswered. At first glance, Tertullian does not appear as being very helpful in this matter: not even with a single syllable did he refer to the PA. It {{is not surprising that}} his entire work has only been little involved in the discussion because he never addressed the story of the woman caught in adultery. But why? After all, towards the end of his earthly career he devoted a complete “treatise” to the topic of adultery and fornication! It is widely recognized that the De pudicitia is composed as a forensic oratory (genus iudiciale) but its implications are only rudimentarily taken into account. A rhetorical analysis shows that if he knew the passage, he could not have <b>afforded</b> <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> it. Consequently, Tertullian did not remain silent about the PA {{because of a lack of}} interest or reluctance to discuss it. Rather, he omitted it because neither the “Bible” on his desk, the one of the community of the New Prophets, nor the one of the “Catholics” accommodated the PA. In other words, the PA was simply unknown in Carthage and highly likely also in the western part of North Africa at the time of 220 AD! In this talk, I will not only reconsider the reason for the abstinence of the PA in the works of Tertullian, particularly in De pudicita, but also emphasize the importance of the PA`s “Sitz im Leben” at the beginning of the 3 rd century AD: The escalated controversy on unforgiveable sins, particularly that of adultery and fornication in Carthage as well as in Rome, plays a key role for the wider recognition and promotion of the story of the woman caught in adultery. status: publishe...|$|R

In close cooperation with each other, they managed to prevent a new revolt by the Mukhranian supporters fomented by Ebrahim Khan, brother of Adel Shah, in 1748. They concluded an anti-Persian alliance with the khans of Azerbaijan who were particularly vulnerable to the aggression from Persian warlords and agreed to recognize Heraclius's supremacy in eastern Transcaucasia. In 1749, he occupied Yerevan, and in June 1751, Heraclius defeated a large army commanded by a pretender to the Persian throne and his former ally, Azat-Khan in the Battle of Kirkhbulakh. After these particular events, Heraclius could largely <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>ignore</b> the changing situation to the south of the Aras River.

The findings were in line with what Danesi (1992) has averred: L 2 learners do not necessarily develop CF and MC after several years of study. Then, the juniors partook in the study for a six-month period in which they were exposed to and taught about the metaphorical language of English.

The first reaction was that of yearning coupled with lament: this is usually the feeling of many Lebanese, especially, Ras Beirut Protestants, who lament the total loss of the religious, specifically Protestant, character of AUB, and who yearn for the good old days when AUB was a Protestant institution. The second reaction was one of worry and apprehension. This came from people who are relieved that AUB no longer {{has anything to do with}} the Christian religion; and they are worried about any attempt to revive a Christian missionary character or role because it is simply either outdated or dangerous or wrong, or all of the above together. Let me begin by assuring you that this lecture is motivated neither by a lament over a lost Protestant institution nor by the desire to revive AUB’s original missionary role. My concern is, first, to tell the story of AUB and religion and to interpret it, then to raise some questions about its ending.

All twenty of the children are of school going age between the ages of 10 - 18 years. The researcher used interviews and questionnaires as the data collection tools.

40|$|As the {{popularity}} of continued involvement in Afghanistan begins to decline and talk of a coordinated exit becomes more prevalent, international efforts to contain Afghanistan's health crisis develop {{a new sense of}} urgency. Despite struggles to improve health, there has been significant progress in certain areas. Programs that target specific diseases have boosted immunization rates. Tremendous strides have also been made in expanding access to care in rural areas. But serious challenges remain, in particular maternal health. If not properly addressed, Afghanistan will remain {{at the bottom of the}} rankings on maternal mortality. Given the conditions for women in Afghanistan, a health issue in such urgent need cannot <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> be <b>ignored.</b> In this paper, I argue that comprehensive delivery of health services must include a stronger commitment to lowering mortality rates through innovative and targeted methods. Efforts to improve the health sector must take a "diagonal" approach, using low-skilled health workers as community-level representatives while working to continue the sector-wide improvements currently underway. While the sector-wide approach has expanded access to care and improved oversight of services delivered, it has not produced improvements in key health indicators such as maternal health. Health experts must work to bridge the divide between vertical approaches that target particular indicators and horizontal approaches that focus on the health system as a whole. Mortality rates will remain high and improvements in the health sector will go unnoticed if further efforts are not made to promote the utilization of health services, especially by pregnant women. Working to further incorporate pregnant women into the health sector will result in declining mortality rates and will further legitimize the efforts of the central government by demonstrating its capacity to provide essential public services. Keeping in mind Afghanistan's immense health crisis and the need to improve its deficient managerial capacity, the most sensible approach to improving the health system should be neither exclusively vertical nor horizontal but rather a combination of both, with a focus on vertical efforts to educate pregnant women about the need to utilize health services and promote healthy lifestyle choices relating to breastfeeding and nutrition...|$|R
