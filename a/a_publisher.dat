5|$|Valve {{struggled}} to find <b>a</b> <b>publisher,</b> as many believed the game was too ambitious for a first-time developer.

5|$|An {{enthusiastic}} {{reader and}} independent thinker as a child, Balzac had trouble {{adapting to the}} teaching style of his grammar school. His willful nature caused trouble throughout his life and frustrated his ambitions {{to succeed in the}} world of business. When he finished school, Balzac was apprenticed in a law office, but he turned his back on the study of law after wearying of its inhumanity and banal routine. Before and during his career as a writer, he attempted to be <b>a</b> <b>publisher,</b> printer, businessman, critic, and politician; he failed in all of these efforts. La Comédie Humaine reflects his real-life difficulties, and includes scenes from his own experience.|$|E

5|$|Browning, Gyles' attorney, cited a case {{which had}} also {{appeared}} before Hardwicke, that of Read v Hodges. In that case, <b>a</b> <b>publisher</b> attempted {{to circumvent the}} rights of the author of Czar Peter the Great by including all three volumes in one and cutting several pages. Hardwicke rejected the argument, however, declaring that the former case had been decided merely on a motion, and that he had given his decision and statements without the thought he would have given a normal hearing. Hardwicke further took contention with the Attorney General for England and Wales' assertion that the Statute of Anne provided a publishing monopoly, instead interpreting the act as one meant to promote public education and the public good.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1770s, Johnson {{had become}} an {{established}} publisher. Writers—particularly Dissenters—sought him out, and his home started to become the centre of a radical and stimulating intellectual milieu. Because he was willing to publish multiple opinions on issues, he was respected as <b>a</b> <b>publisher</b> by writers from across the political spectrum. Johnson published many Unitarian works, but he also issued works criticizing them; although he was an abolitionist, he also published works arguing in favour of the slave trade; he supported inoculation, but he also published works critical of the practice.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{his army}} service in 1919, Marquis was restless and unsure of his future path.

He then decided to move to Whitehall, where he spent more and more of his time writing, at first on his wartime experiences, and then short articles on diverse subjects collected into volumes. He also wrote short stories during this period. However, he could not find <b>a</b> <b>publisher.</b>|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war Clarke {{spent some}} time writing war histories. Until his {{retirement}} from the army in 1947, with the rank of brigadier, he recorded the history of 'A' Force. The document was never published and remained classified till the 1970s. His first complete book was published in 1948. Seven Assignments recorded Clarke's activities during the early wartime period of 1939 and 1940 (before the Middle East posting). It was not his first attempt at a book. In 1925 Clarke had found <b>a</b> <b>publisher</b> for his coverage for the Rif rebellion, but the work was never finished.|$|E
5|$|Founding {{publisher}} Alexander {{was born}} about 1830 {{and came to}} Oregon from Illinois as a pioneer in 1852. Alexander initially worked as a farmer, supplementing his income as a surveyor and local {{justice of the peace}} before learning the printing trade working for the town's earlier pro-Southern newspapers. Although his own venture as <b>a</b> <b>publisher</b> was short and unprofitable, Alexander unwittingly was the scion of a local newspaper dynasty in Oregon, with two of his sons later themselves publishing The Guard (following the tenure of several intermediate owners), while a grandson, George L. Alexander, would one day edit another Oregon paper, the Lebanon Express.|$|E
5|$|If <b>a</b> <b>publisher</b> {{does not}} agree with the rating that they were assigned, they may edit the game and submit the revised version for a new rating; for example, an initial cut of The Punisher was given an AO rating due to the {{extremely}} violent nature of certain scenes contained within the game. To lessen their impact, the developer changed these scenes to be rendered in black and white: the revised cut of the game was re-submitted, and received the M rating. There is also an appeals process, but it has never been used.|$|E
