5|$|Grant won the {{election}} by 300,000 votes out of 5,716,082 votes cast, receiving an electoral college landslide, of 214 votes to Seymour's 80. Grant, {{at the age of}} 46 became the youngest president on record. His election was a triumph of principles that included sound money, efficient government, and the restoration of Southern reconstructed states. Grant was the first president to be elected after the nation had outlawed slavery and granted citizenship to former slaves. Implementation of these new rights was slow to come; in the 1868 election, the black vote counted in only 16 of the 37 states, nearly all in the South. Grant lost Louisiana and Georgia primarily due to Ku Klux Klan violence against African <b>American</b> <b>voters.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The <b>American</b> <b>Voter</b> {{established}} a baseline {{for most of}} the scholarly debate that has followed in the decades since. Criticism has followed along several different lines. Some argue that Campbell and his colleagues set the bar too high, expecting voters to be far more sophisticated and rational than is reasonable. Some scholars, most notably V. O. Key, Jr., in The Responsible Electorate, have argued, in part based on reinterpretation of the same data, that voters are more rational than The <b>American</b> <b>Voter</b> gives them credit for. His famous line [...] "Voters are not fools" [...] summarizes this view. Successors in the Michigan school have argued that in relying heavily on data from the 1956 presidential election, The <b>American</b> <b>Voter</b> drew conclusions that were not accurate over time; in particular, partisan identification has weakened in the years since 1956, a phenomenon sometimes known as dealignment (see realigning election).|$|R

25|$|Dinkins {{was elected}} {{in the wake of}} a {{corruption}} scandal that involved several New York City Democratic leaders. Mayor Koch, the presumptive Democratic nominee, was politically damaged by the corruption in his administration and his handling of racial issues, and among the candidates Dinkins was his greatest challenger. Additionally, the fact that Dinkins is African American helped him to avoid criticism that he was ignoring the black vote by campaigning to whites. While a large turnout of African <b>American</b> <b>voters</b> was important to his election, Dinkins campaigned throughout the city. Dinkins' campaign manager was political consultant William Lynch, Jr., who became one of his First Deputy Mayors.|$|E
25|$|South Carolina {{blacks had}} {{problems}} with the Southern version of states' rights; by 1940, the voter registration provisions written into the 1895 constitution effectively still limited African <b>American</b> <b>voters</b> to 3,000—only 0.8 percent of those of voting age in the state. African Americans {{had not been able}} to elect a representative since the 19th century. Hundreds of thousands left the state for industrial cities in the Great Migration of the 20th century. By 1960, during the Civil Rights Movement, South Carolina had a population of 2,382,594, of whom nearly 35%, or 829,291 were African Americans, who had been without representation for 60 years. In addition, the state enforced legal racial segregation in public facilities.|$|E

40|$|One useful way {{to employ}} survey data to {{understand}} presidential election outcomes is to decompose the electoral decision into {{a set of}} “components ” measuring {{different aspects of the}} election. The <b>American</b> <b>Voter</b> (Campbell, Converse, Miller, and Stokes 1960) utilized a decomposition into six components, analyzing how attitudes toward the Republican and Democratic candidates, domestic and foreign issues, social groups, and parties as managers of government moved the vote decision in the 1952 and 1956 elections (see also Stokes, Campbell, and Miller 1958). This paper analyzes how these components have changed in importance over the past half-century. Additionally, this paper augments the components model by developing summary measures of the short-term forces affecting election results. Neither The <b>American</b> <b>Voter</b> nor The <b>American</b> <b>Voter</b> Revisited deals sufficiently with the implications of party identification for how the six components affect the electoral decision. After analyzing the impact of the six components on the vote, they do an additional analysis of the impact of those components controlling for party identification, but that treats the effects of party identification as linear rather tha...|$|R
25|$|In recent decades, Republicans {{have been}} {{moderately}} successful in gaining support from Hispanic and Asian <b>American</b> <b>voters.</b> George W. Bush, who campaigned energetically for Hispanic votes, received 35% of their vote in 2000 and 44% in 2004. The party's strong anti-communist stance {{has made it}} popular among some minority groups from current and former Communist states, in particular Cuban Americans, Korean Americans, Chinese Americans, and Vietnamese Americans. The election of Bobby Jindal as Governor of Louisiana has been hailed as pathbreaking. He is the first elected minority governor in Louisiana and the first state governor of Indian descent. According to John Avlon in 2013, the Republican party is more diverse at the statewide elected official level than the Democratic Party, including Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval and South Carolina Senator Tim Scott.|$|E
25|$|The {{election}} saw increased participation from African Americans, {{who made}} up 11.1% of the electorate in 2004, versus 13.0% in 2008. According to exit polls, over 95% of African Americans voted for Obama. This {{played a critical role}} in Southern states such as North Carolina. 74% of North Carolina's registered African <b>American</b> <b>voters</b> turned out, as opposed to 69% of North Carolinians in general, with Obama carrying 100% (with rounding) of African-American females and African Americans age 18 to 29, according to exit polling. This was also the case in Virginia, where much higher turnout among African Americans propelled Obama to victory in the former Republican stronghold. Even in southern states in which Obama was unsuccessful, such as Georgia and Mississippi, due to large African American turnout he was much more competitive than John Kerry in 2004.|$|E
25|$|George W. Bush {{had become}} {{increasingly}} unpopular by 2006. Polls consistently showed that his approval ratings among <b>American</b> <b>voters</b> had averaged around 30 percent. In March 2008, Bush endorsed McCain at the White House, but Bush {{did not make}} a single appearance for McCain during the campaign. Bush appeared at the 2008 GOP convention only through a live video broadcast. He chose not to appear in person due to disaster events in the Gulf of Mexico in the aftermath of Hurricane Gustav. Although he supported the war in Iraq, McCain made an effort to show that he had disagreed with Bush on many other key issues such as climate change. During the entire general election campaign, Obama countered by pointing out in ads and at numerous campaign rallies that McCain had claimed {{in an interview that he}} voted with Bush 90% of the time, and congressional voting records supported this for the years Bush was in office.|$|E

25|$|A NY1-Marist Poll {{released}} show of November 1ed 44 {{percent of}} New York voters supported the Occupy Wall Street movement, while only 21 percent supported the Tea Party. A survey of roughly 1,000 adults conducted from November 10 to 14 found that majorities of nearly identical size felt that Occupy Wall Street, and the Tea Party, respectively, {{did not share}} their values. A November 3 poll done by the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute found that 30 percent of <b>American</b> <b>voters</b> have a favorable view of the protests, while 39 percent do not. The same poll found that among independent voters, 29 percent have a favorable view opposed to 42 percent who have an unfavorable view, while 45% of Democrats have a favorable view opposed to 19% who have an unfavorable view. A Pew Research Center poll, released December 15, 2011, found that nearly {{three months after the}} start of OWS, 44% support the Occupy Wall Street movement and 35% oppose it.

25|$|Edison/Mitofsky {{conducted}} an exit poll {{on behalf of}} the National Election Pool which is the only source of data on voter demographics in California in the 2008 election. The statistical trends from the exit poll of 2,240 voters suggested that an array of voters came out both in opposition to and in support of Proposition 8, with no single demographic group making up most of either the Yes or No vote. The National Election Pool poll showed that support for Proposition 8 was strong amongst African <b>American</b> <b>voters,</b> interviewed in the exit poll with 70% in favor, more than any other racial group. Their support was considered crucial to the proposition's passing, since African Americans made up an unusually larger percentage of voters that year, due to the presence of Barack Obama on the ballot. Polls by both the Associated Press and CNN mirrored this data, reporting support among black voters to be at 70% and 75%, respectively. A later study by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force (NGLTF), examining the black vote only from five counties within the state, suggested that black support was closer to 58%.|$|E
25|$|Timothy had again {{been elected}} to the {{legislature}} in 1762, but was not reelected the following year due to an election rigged by Elijah Williams. In November 1762, the Susquehanna Company voted {{him to be a}} part of a committee to meet with the Native American chiefs at Albany to discuss the purchase they had made, which was still disputed. This meeting was set for late March, and Elijah and his supporters took advantage of his absence. At this time, the number of English settlers had increased drastically, and some of them were in favor of splitting the town between the English and Native Americans. Williams called for a town meeting while Timothy was in Albany, and while many of the Native <b>American</b> <b>voters</b> were away on their winter syrup harvest. Timothy heard about this, but was apparently convinced his supporters would reelect him. Williams, however, brought in outsiders to vote for him and used a written ballot, as opposed to the past policy of translating everything into Mahican so that the Mahicans would understand. Even using these extreme tactics, Williams still only won by a three-vote margin. Timothy and his supporters were outraged and demanded an investigation. A petition was sent to Governor Bernard in May with 23 signatures, and Timothy sent another letter in December with 16 signatures. The investigation was delayed until October, and confirmed many of their charges, however the results were allowed to stand.|$|E
