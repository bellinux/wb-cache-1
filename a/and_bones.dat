40|$|Purpose. The {{association}} between serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D values <b>and</b> cortical/trabecular <b>bone</b> parameters in older adults has been incompletely explored. This {{study was designed}} to investigate the relationship between serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D levels <b>and</b> <b>bone</b> parameters for the tibia and radius using peripheral quantitative computed tomog-raphy in free-living healthy older adults. Methods. The study involved 134 older adults attending a twice-weekly low-intensity fitness program. In addition to clinical history and serum parameters, we assessed fat-free mass using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, total <b>bone</b> <b>and</b> cortical <b>bone</b> cross-sectional areas, <b>and</b> trabecular <b>and</b> cortical <b>bone</b> mineral density for the tibia and radius by peripheral quantitative computed tomography.

5|$|Plutonium, when {{entering}} the body through air, food or blood (e.g. a wound), mostly settles in the lungs, liver <b>and</b> <b>bones</b> with only about 10% going to other organs, and remains there for decades. The long residence time of plutonium {{in the body}} is partly explained by its poor solubility in water. Some isotopes of plutonium emit ionizing α-radiation, which damages the surrounding cells. The median lethal dose (LD50) for 30 days in dogs after intravenous injection of plutonium is 0.32 milligram per kg of body mass, and thus the lethal dose for humans is approximately 22mg for a person weighing 70kg; the amount for respiratory exposure should be approximately four times greater. Another estimate assumes that plutonium is 50 times less toxic than radium, and thus permissible content of plutonium in the body should be 5µg or 0.3 µCi. Such amount is nearly invisible in under microscope. After trials on animals, this maximum permissible dose was reduced to 0.65µg or 0.04 µCi. Studies on animals also revealed that the most dangerous plutonium exposure route is through inhalation, after which 5–25% of inhaled substances is retained in the body. Depending on the particle size and solubility of the plutonium compounds, plutonium is localized either in the lungs or in the lymphatic system, or is absorbed in the blood and then transported to the liver <b>and</b> <b>bones.</b> Contamination via food is the least likely way. In this case, only about 0.05% of soluble 0.01% insoluble compounds of plutonium absorbs into blood, {{and the rest is}} excreted. Exposure of damaged skin to plutonium would retain nearly 100% of it.|$|E
5|$|Several {{minerals}} {{used for}} paint pigments were excavated from Chetro Ketl, including charcoal, shale, malachite, iron oxides, hematite, limonite, gypsum, and azurite.

The relative lack of exotic material uncovered at Chetro Ketl, such as shells, copper bells, and macaw feathers, may indicate its lesser importance compared to Pueblo Bonito, where those items {{have been found in}} abundance. Because Chetro Ketl has only been partially excavated definitive conclusions remain elusive. In 1937, W. W.
