40|$|An arthroscope is a {{diagnostic}} instrument for visualisation {{of the interior}} of a joint. By adding a laser to an arthroscope and feeding the images to a computer, one gets an method to measure the structure of the cartilage covering the joint. This gives an added diagnostic value. The laser will create laser speckles and this report covers the basic theories behind this. The anatomy of the joints, the properties of cartilage and the background on the disease arthritis are also covered, as well as the field of surface topography and image processing. Experiments were performed on three different materials - metals of different definite surface roughness, polymerised collagen and bovine articular cartilage. The conclusion is that the technique would work, providing that some obstacles could be overcome. The technique itself is very precise and detects nanometric differences in the surface structure, making it extremely interesting for research purposes, such <b>as</b> <b>follow-ups</b> on treatments and studies of arthritis and cartilage repair...|$|E

40|$|We {{compared}} real-time LightCycler and TaqMan assays and the GP 5 / 6 PCR/enzyme immunoassay (EIA) {{to assess}} the human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV 16) load in cervical scrape specimens. Both real-time PCR assays determined the HPV 16 load in scrape specimens similarly. The level of agreement between these assays and the GP 5 / 6 PCR/EIA was low (P 0. 004), suggesting that the latter method is not suited for quantifying HPV 16 DNA. It is now well established that a persistent infection with a high-risk human papillomavirus (hr-HPV) type is a necessary cause of cervical cancer (1, 7, 14). In addition, several {{studies have shown that}} an increased human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA load within a cervical smear specimen is associated with an increased risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN 3) and cervical carcinomas (3, 6, 11, 13).

40|$|Purpose – This paper explores {{whether the}} {{potential}} application of Standardised Water Accounting (SWA), {{reflected in the}} Exposure Draft of Australian Water Accounting Standard 1 (ED AWAS 1), to report on groundwater resources will enhance the practice and accountability of groundwater managers. Effective and efficient water management is an essential element in alleviating water crises caused by misuse of water resources, and groundwater management poses many unique challenges. Groundwater accounting and accountability {{was one of the}} key issues identified {{during the course of the}} ‘Water Accounting Project’ that the researcher undertook from 2008 to 2009. Design/methodology/approach – The paper develops theoretical framework of accountability in three main components: clarity of relationship, transparency and power, drawing on the work of Gray et al. (1996), Roberts (2009), Joannides (2012), Shaoul et al. (2012) and Smyth (2012) (among others). This framework is used to analyse groundwater accounting at two Australian government departments with responsibility for groundwater management and accounting, namely the Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources of South Australia (former Department of Water) and the New South Wales Office of Water. Data was gathered mainly from interviews, also from informal conversations with personnel from both locations and from public documents. Five people were interviewed once and three people were interviewed twice (the latter is described in Section 5 <b>as</b> <b>follow-ups).</b> Findings – In analysing whether or not future groundwater reports prepared under SWA will discharge the accountability of water managers, it was found a priori that they will not. This assumption was made after analysing all data from the case studies based on the integrated accountability model discussed by the researcher. 1 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aim: Public-private {{partnership}} {{is a type}} of privatization in which the public sector continues to participate in the provision of services. Based on an agreement between the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Cooperatives, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences started the process of creating health cooperatives in the Eastern Azerbaijan Province. In this study we compare the function of various health service processes between public health centers and health cooperatives. Material and Methods: This study looks at coverage, quality and continuity of primary health care in 9 health centers handed over to cooperatives as compared to 18 current public health centers. Data were collected over a period of three months and analyzed by the SPSS- 10 statistical package. Chi-Square and t tests were used for data analysis. Results: Family planning coverage rates, infant health care, 1 - to 6 -year-old health care, prenatal care and the number of households covered by volunteers were all higher in cooperatives compared to public health centers. The mean care delivery volume was smaller in health cooperatives. The mean numbers of screening visits, outpatient visits, control visits, consultations, injections and dressings as well <b>as</b> <b>follow-ups</b> were higher in health cooperatives. Despite the greater numbers of family planning visits, vaccinations, health certificates issued and water chlorimetry tests in the public sector, the differences were not statistically significant. Concordance of data between forms and registers was higher in health cooperatives in the case of child health care, periodic visits and vaccination forms. Conclusion: Compared to the public sector, health service delivery through cooperatives not only functions well but also yields better indices in many health domains. This is an example that a private institutions functioning {{under the supervision of the}} public sector can implement nationwide health care programs better than the public sector itself...|$|E
