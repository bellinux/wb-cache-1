5|$|Like {{most other}} Proteaceae, B.sessilis has {{compound}} cluster roots, roots with dense clusters of short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} just below the leaf litter. These exude a range of carboxylates, including citrate, malonate and trans-aconitate, that act as acid phosphatase, allowing the <b>absorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>nutrients</b> from nutrient-poor soils, such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia.|$|E
5|$|However, {{vegetables}} often {{also contain}} toxins and antinutrients which {{interfere with the}} <b>absorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>nutrients.</b> These include α-solanine, α-chaconine, enzyme inhibitors (of cholinesterase, protease, amylase, etc.), cyanide and cyanide precursors, oxalic acid, and others. These toxins are natural defenses, used {{to ward off the}} insects, predators and fungi that might attack the plant. Some beans contain phytohaemagglutinin, and cassava roots contain cyanogenic glycoside as do bamboo shoots. These toxins can be deactivated by adequate cooking. Green potatoes contain glycoalkaloids and should be avoided.|$|E
5|$|The broader {{definition}} differs {{mainly in}} including plants {{that do not}} produce their own digestive enzymes but rely on internal food webs or microbes to digest prey, such as Darlingtonia and some species of Heliamphora. The original definition of botanical carnivory, set out in Givnish et. al. (1984), required a plant to exhibit an adaptation of some trait specifically for the attraction, capture, or digestion of prey while gaining a fitness advantage through the <b>absorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>nutrients</b> derived from said prey. Upon further analysis of genera currently considered carnivorous, botanists widened the original definition to include species that use mutualistic interactions for digestion.|$|E

5|$|Homozygous FH {{is harder}} to treat. The LDL receptors are {{minimally}} functional, if at all. Only high doses of statins, often {{in combination with other}} medications, are modestly effective in improving lipid levels. If medical therapy is not successful at reducing cholesterol levels, LDL apheresis may be used; this filters LDL from the bloodstream in a process reminiscent of dialysis. Very severe cases may be considered for a liver transplant; this provides a liver with normally functional LDL receptors, and leads to rapid improvement of the cholesterol levels, but at the risk of complications from any solid organ transplant (such as rejection, infections, or side-effects of the medication required to suppress rejection). Other surgical techniques include partial ileal bypass surgery, in which part of the small bowel is bypassed to decrease the <b>absorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>nutrients</b> and hence cholesterol, and portacaval shunt surgery, in which the portal vein is connected to the vena cava to allow blood with nutrients from the intestine to bypass the liver.|$|E

40|$|Effect {{of various}} light and {{temperature}} regimes in the root zone on the light stage of photosynthesis, gas exchange, growth processes and <b>absorption</b> <b>of</b> mineral <b>nutrients</b> by tomato plants were studied.

25|$|Frequently alcoholics have {{disrupted}} social {{links in}} their lives and have an irregular lifestyle. This may cause an alcoholic to change their eating habits including more missed meals and a poor dietary balance. Alcoholism may also result in loss of appetite, alcoholic gastritis, and vomiting, which decrease food intake. Alcohol abuse damages the lining of the gastrointestinal system and reduces <b>absorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>nutrients</b> that are taken in. The combination of all of them may result in a nutritional deficiency that is linked to the development of alcoholic polyneuropathy.|$|E
25|$|Helminthiasis {{may cause}} chronic illness through {{malnutrition}} including vitamin deficiencies, stunted growth, anemia, and protein-energy malnutrition. Worms compete directly with their hosts for nutrients, but {{the magnitude of}} this effect is likely minimal as the nutritional requirements of worms is relatively small. In pigs and humans, Ascaris has been linked to lactose intolerance and vitamin A, amino acid, and fat malabsorption. Impaired nutrient uptake may result from direct damage to the intestinal mucosal wall or from more subtle changes such as chemical imbalances and changes in gut flora. Alternatively, the worms’ release of protease inhibitors to defend against the body’s digestive processes may impair the breakdown of other nutrients. In addition, worm induced diarrhoea may shorten gut transit time, thus reducing <b>absorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>nutrients.</b>|$|E
500|$|Capsella bursa-pastoris, shepherd's purse, {{is another}} plant where {{the claim of}} carnivory is contested. This unique protocarnivorous plant is only capable of {{capturing}} prey during one stage of its life cycle. The seeds of the plant, when moistened, secrete a viscous fluid that actively attracts and kills prey. There is also evidence of [...] protease activity and <b>absorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>nutrients.</b> The only carnivory criterion not explored is how much the plant benefits from the carnivorous adaptation.|$|E
40|$|The most {{apparent}} symptom of boron deficiency in higher plants is a cessation of growth.

2500|$|Some organisms, {{including}} {{nearly all}} spiders, simply secrete biotoxins and digestive chemicals (e.g., enzymes) into the extracellular environment prior to ingestion of the consequent [...] "soup".

2500|$|The abomasum is {{the fourth}} and final stomach {{compartment}} in ruminants. It is a close equivalent of a monogastric stomach (e.g., those in humans or pigs), and digesta is processed here {{in much the same}} way. It serves primarily as a site for acid hydrolysis of microbial and dietary protein, preparing these protein sources for further digestion and absorption in the small intestine. [...] Digesta is finally moved into the small intestine, where the digestion and <b>absorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>nutrients</b> occurs. Microbes produced in the reticulo-rumen are also digested in the small intestine.|$|E
2500|$|The {{pancreas}} [...] is a glandular organ in {{the digestive}} system and endocrine system of vertebrates. In humans, {{it is located}} in the abdominal cavity behind the stomach. [...] It is an endocrine gland producing several important hormones, including insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide, all of which circulate in the blood. The pancreas is also a digestive organ, secreting pancreatic juice containing bicarbonate to neutralize acidity of chyme moving in from the stomach, as well as digestive enzymes that assist digestion and <b>absorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>nutrients</b> in the small intestine. These enzymes help to further break down the carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids in the chyme. The pancreas is known as a mixed gland.|$|E

50|$|Cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase is the {{rate-limiting enzyme}} in the {{synthesis}} of bile acid from cholesterol via the classic pathway, catalyzing the formation of 7α-hydroxycholesterol.

2500|$|The {{digestive}} gland {{itself is}} rather short. It has four elements, with food {{passing through the}} crop, stomach and caecum before entering the intestine. Most digestion, {{as well as the}} <b>absorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>nutrients,</b> occurs in the digestive gland, sometimes called the liver. [...] Nutrients and waste materials are exchanged between the gut and the digestive gland through a pair of connections linking the gland to the junction of the stomach and caecum. Cells in the digestive gland directly release pigmented excretory chemicals into the lumen of the gut, which are then bound with mucus passed through the anus as long dark strings, ejected with the aid of exhaled water from the funnel. Cephalopods tend to concentrate ingested heavy metals in their body tissue.|$|E
2500|$|After {{some time}} (typically 1–2 hours in humans, 4–6 hours in dogs, 3–4 hours in house cats), the {{resulting}} thick liquid is called chyme. [...] When the pyloric sphincter valve opens, chyme enters the duodenum where it mixes with digestive enzymes from the pancreas and bile juice from {{the liver and}} then passes through the small intestine, in which digestion continues. When the chyme is fully digested, it is absorbed into the blood. 95% of <b>absorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>nutrients</b> occurs in the small intestine. [...] Water and minerals are reabsorbed back into the blood in the colon (large intestine) where the pH is slightly acidic about 5.6 ~ 6.9. [...] Some vitamins, such as biotin and vitamin K (K2MK7) produced by bacteria in the colon are also absorbed into the blood in the colon. Waste material is eliminated from the rectum during defecation.|$|E
2500|$|... 2. Mesenteron (midgut): Digestive enzymes in {{this region}} are {{produced}} and secreted into the lumen and here nutrients are absorbed into the insect’s body. Food is enveloped by {{this part of the}} gut as it arrives from the foregut by the peritrophic membrane which is a mucopolysaccharide layer secreted from the midgut’s epithelial cells. It is thought that this membrane prevents food pathogens from contacting the epithelium and attacking the insects’ body. It also acts as a filter allowing small molecules through, but preventing large molecules and particles of food from reaching the midgut cells. After the large substances are broken down into smaller ones, digestion and consequent nutrient absorption takes place at the surface of the epithelium. Microscopic projections from the mid-gut wall, called microvilli, increase surface area and allow for maximum <b>absorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>nutrients.</b>|$|E
50|$|Another {{particularly}} widespread form of antinutrients are the flavonoids, {{which are}} a group of polyphenolic compounds that include tannins.

2500|$|Digestion {{begins in}} the mouth with the {{secretion}} of saliva and its digestive enzymes. Food is formed into a bolus by the mechanical mastication and swallowed into the esophagus from where it enters the stomach through the action of peristalsis. Gastric juice contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin which would damage {{the walls of the}} stomach and mucus is secreted for protection. In the stomach further release of enzymes break down the food further and this is combined with the churning action of the stomach. The partially digested food enters the duodenum as a thick semi-liquid chyme. In the small intestine, the larger part of digestion takes place and this is helped by the secretions of bile, pancreatic juice and intestinal juice. [...] The intestinal walls are lined with villi, and their epithelial cells is covered with numerous microvilli to improve the <b>absorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>nutrients</b> by increasing the surface area of the intestine.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of cystic fibrosis are salty-tasting skin, poor growth, and poor weight gain despite normal food intake, accumulation of thick, sticky mucus, frequent chest infections, and coughing or shortness of breath. Males can be infertile due to congenital absence of the vas deferens. Symptoms often appear in infancy and childhood, such as bowel obstruction due to meconium ileus in newborn babies. As the children grow, they [...] exercise to release mucus in the alveoli. Ciliated epithelial cells in the person have a mutated protein that leads to abnormally viscous mucus production. The poor growth in children typically presents as an inability to gain weight or height {{at the same rate as}} their peers, and is occasionally not diagnosed until investigation is initiated for poor growth. The causes of growth failure are multifactorial and include chronic lung infection, poor <b>absorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>nutrients</b> through the gastrointestinal tract, and increased metabolic demand due to chronic illness.|$|E
2500|$|Ponds and Lakes are {{artificial}} {{bodies of}} open water {{that are usually}} created by constructing a dam wall with a weir outlet structure. Similar to constructed wetlands, {{they can be used}} to treat runoff by providing extended detention and allowing sedimentation, <b>absorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>nutrients</b> and UV disinfection to occur. In addition, they provide an aesthetic quality for recreation, wildlife habitat, and valuable storage of water that can potentially be reused for e.g. irrigation. Often, artificial ponds and lakes also form part of a flood detention system. Aquatic vegetation plays an important role for the water quality in artificial lakes and ponds in respect of maintaining and regulating the oxygen and nutrient levels. [...] Due to a water depth greater than 1.5m, emergent macrophytes are usually restricted to the margins but submergent plants may occur in the open water zone.
