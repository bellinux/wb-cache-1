25|$|Magnesium is {{necessary}} for the function of many metabolic enzymes and also serves as a key regulator of calcium channels involved in neurotransmission (e.g. NMDA receptor). Magnesium supplementation facilitates nerve regeneration after injury. Although unpolished grains contain magnesium, phytic acid in grains can inhibit its absorption. Leafy greens <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> source of magnesium.|$|E
25|$|The Morganucodontidae first {{appeared}} in the late Triassic, about 205M years ago. They <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> example of transitional fossils, since they have both the dentary-squamosal and articular-quadrate jaw joints. They were also one of the first discovered and most thoroughly studied of the mammaliaforms outside of the crown-group mammals, since an unusually large number of morganucodont fossils have been found.|$|E

25|$|Oats are {{generally}} considered healthy {{due to their}} rich content of several essential nutrients (table). In a 100 gram serving, oats provide 389 calories and <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> source (20% {{or more of the}} Daily Value, DV) of protein (34% DV), dietary fiber (44% DV), several B vitamins and numerous dietary minerals, especially manganese (233% DV) (table).

25|$|Although auditory–motor {{interactions}} can {{be observed}} in people without formal musical training, musicians <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> population to study because of their long-established and rich associations between auditory and motor systems. Musicians have been shown to have anatomical adaptations that correlate with their training. Some neuroimaging studies have observed that musicians show lower levels of activity in motor regions than non-musicians during the performance of simple motor tasks, which may suggest a more efficient pattern of neural recruitment.|$|E

25|$|Play {{will take}} care of a lot of their {{exercise}} needs; however, as with all breeds, play is not sufficient for all exercise. Daily walks or runs <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> way to exercise a Papillon. They will also enjoy a good romp in a safe open area off leash, such as a large fenced-in yard. Papillons are a very active breed of dog and enjoy having a job to perform. Papillon Breeders recommend dog agility, Rally obedience, Obedience for Papillons because of their intelligence and energy level.|$|E
25|$|Frogs <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> {{example of}} all three trends: frog legs can be nearly twice the body length, leg muscles may account for up to twenty percent of body weight, {{and they have not}} only {{lengthened}} the foot, shin and thigh, but extended the ankle bones into another limb joint and similarly extended the hip bones and gained mobility at the sacrum for a second 'extra joint'. As a result, frogs are the undisputed champion jumpers of vertebrates, leaping over fifty body lengths, a distance of more than eight feet.|$|E
25|$|An {{expression}} {{system is a}} system specifically designed {{for the production of}} a gene product of choice. This is normally a protein although may also be RNA, such as tRNA or a ribozyme. An {{expression system}} consists of a gene, normally encoded by DNA, and the molecular machinery required to transcribe the DNA into mRNA and translate the mRNA into protein using the reagents provided. In the broadest sense this includes every living cell but the term is more normally used to refer to expression as a laboratory tool. An expression system is therefore often artificial in some manner. Expression systems are, however, a fundamentally natural process. Viruses <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> example where they replicate by using the host cell as an expression system for the viral proteins and genome.|$|E

500|$|Continuous, short-arc, high {{pressure}} xenon arc lamps have a color temperature closely approximating noon sunlight {{and are used}} in solar simulators. That is, the chromaticity of these lamps closely approximates a heated black body radiator at {{the temperature of the}} Sun. First introduced in the 1940s, these lamps replaced the shorter-lived carbon arc lamps in movie projectors. They are also employed in typical 35mm, IMAX, and digital film projection systems. They <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> source of short wavelength ultraviolet radiation and have intense emissions in the near infrared used in some night vision systems.

500|$|The show's {{eleventh}} series saw musical montage or [...] "songtage" [...] segments become {{standard in}} each episode, introduced by McHale {{as a means}} of modernising the show. Although McHale initially considered commissioning original pieces, budgetary constraints limited choices to pre-existing tracks. The use of songtages was first popularised by the US medical drama Grey's Anatomy, however McHale stated he was unaware of this until Holby City had already adopted the technique. Music was generally selected by each episode's scriptwriter. If the writer was not specific about which songs should be used, the producers and director would select the music in post-production. Actors also have some input: Hugh Quarshie personally selected the music he believed his character Ric Griffin would listen to in theatre. Asked in June 2010 whether she felt songtages were appropriate for a serious drama show, Kyle responded: [...] "Yes – sometimes. On a multi-strand series such as Holby, they <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> way of telling stories visually – a moment from each – to open or close an episode or create the passing of time in a concise way for the audience." [...] Kris Green of entertainment and media website Digital Spy suggested that the number of songs used per episode could be [...] "very jarring", to which Kyle replied: [...] "We plan to use music carefully in the future – maybe 'songtages', as above – and sourced music within a scene, that is music actually playing in the scene itself, for example on a radio – but less incidental." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bragg {{diffraction}} (also {{referred to}} as the Bragg formulation of X-ray diffraction) was first proposed by William Lawrence Bragg and his father William Henry Bragg in 1913 in response to their discovery that crystalline solids produced surprising patterns of reflected X-rays (in contrast to that of, say, a liquid). [...] They found that these crystals, at certain specific wavelengths and incident angles, produced intense peaks of reflected radiation. The concept of Bragg diffraction applies equally to neutron diffraction and electron diffraction processes. Both neutron and X-ray wavelengths are comparable with inter-atomic distances (~150pm) and thus <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> probe for this length scale.|$|E

Ultimately, according to McMillen, Humble Bundles neither hurt nor help in the long run and now seem more of a tradition than anything else.|$|E

2500|$|Electric {{radiant heating}} [...] uses heating {{elements}} that reach a high temperature. The element is usually packaged inside a glass envelope resembling {{a light bulb}} and with a reflector to direct the energy output {{away from the body}} of the heater. The element emits infrared radiation that travels through air or space until it hits an absorbing surface, where it is partially converted to heat and partially reflected. This heat directly warms people and objects in the room, rather than warming the air. This style of heater is particularly useful in areas through which unheated air flows. They are also ideal for basements and garages where spot heating is desired. More generally, they <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> choice for task-specific heating.|$|E
2500|$|Brainwash - A weekend {{programming}} {{block that}} aired on Saturday and Sunday mornings. It was hosted by Carrie (musician and puppeteer Ali Eisner) and Ed (Shaun Majumder) from a colourful set featuring pipes and video screens. Majumder left {{the show in}} 1997 {{and was replaced by}} Peter Oldering. The concept was created and originally produced by Kim J. Saltarski and Atul N. Rao, later produced by Karen Young. Brainwash had many slogans such as [...] "Put a spin on your reality", [...] "Headaches <b>are</b> <b>an</b> <b>excellent</b> source of iron", and [...] "YTV's laundromat of choice". The theme was a play on the name using bubbles, washing machines, and brain visuals. Brainwash was similar to [...] "The Zone", but was much longer. It featured programs such as Bump in the Night, Astro Boy, Sailor Moon, and The Pink Panther. Brainwash was eventually replaced with Snit Station.|$|E
