50|$|Similar {{to other}} aminoglycosides, {{neomycin}} has excellent activity against Gram-negative bacteria, and has partial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. It is relatively toxic to humans, {{and many people}} have allergic reactions to it. See: Hypersensitivity. Physicians sometimes recommend using <b>antibiotic</b> <b>ointments</b> without neomycin, such as Polysporin. The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant Gram-negative bacteria.|$|R
2500|$|The FDA is {{not trying}} to {{regulate}} all antimicrobials at this time - only those antibiotics which are considered “medically important.” [...] For example, bacitracin, a common antibiotic found in over the counter <b>antibiotic</b> <b>ointments,</b> is not classified as “medically important.” [...] Also, ionophores, which are not a part of human medicine but given for improving the health of livestock, are also not included in this regulation.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of clean {{surgical}} wounds, {{there is no evidence}} that the use of topical antibiotics reduces infection rates in comparison with non-antibiotic ointment or no <b>ointment</b> at all. <b>Antibiotic</b> <b>ointments</b> can irritate the skin, slow healing, and greatly increase the risk of developing contact dermatitis and antibiotic resistance. Because of this, they should only be used when a person shows signs of infection and not as a preventative.|$|R
2500|$|Initial {{treatment}} involves addressing any existing {{infections that}} may have occurred due to the broken state of the skin. Existing wounds are treated with warm compresses, non-adherent (non-stick) dressing, and topical <b>antibiotic</b> <b>ointment.</b> Immunosuppressive agents are administered in attempt to decrease blistering; this is not often effective. The first medication given aiming to heal the wounds are high dose corticosteroids. This is followed by steroid sparing agents [...] which may reduce steroid intake and therefore lessen the side effects. Skin lesions {{are more likely to}} respond to this line of treatment than mucosal lesions. However, a high level of caution is advised in patients with a confirmed malignancy, where immunosuppression is vital and dictates treatment options. If the initial therapy fails to control the symptoms of PNP, and the condition of the patient deteriorates, a more aggressive approach may be necessary.|$|E

40|$|Tissue lesions {{similar to}} those in human myospherulosis were {{reproduced}} in experimental animals and studied by light and electron microscopy. The lesions were produced by the use of petrolatum-based <b>antibiotic</b> <b>ointments.</b> These ointments, which are marketed as nonsterile products, are {{similar to those}} used for hemostatic packing in otolaryngologic surgery. To date, use of these ointments has been reported to precede the finding of human paranasal sinus myospherulosis. The exact nature of the structures of myospherulosis remains unknown. The experimental evidence strongly suggests that they can be iatrogenically produced by the use of these nonsterile ointments...|$|R
40|$|A 1992 {{meta-analysis}} did {{not find}} enough evidence to recommend one method of umbilical cord care as the ‘best’.

40|$|Intravascular {{catheters}} {{have become}} essential tools {{for the management}} of patients in modern medical practice, but there are complications. In particular, catheter-related infection remains a major cause of nosocomial infection and primary septicemia. The development of preventive strategies to reduce the incidence of catheter-related infection is an important goal for all health providers. Over recent years, significant advances in prophylactic measures for the prevention of catheter-related infection have been made. This paper reviews strategies based on antibiotic prophylaxis such as systemic administration of antibiotics, application of <b>antibiotic</b> <b>ointments</b> to the skin insertion site as well as catheter flushing with antibiotics, the antibiotic-lock technique and the use of antimicrobial impregnated catheters...|$|R
50|$|For home treatment, the American Academy of Dermatology {{recommends}} {{washing the}} hands, clipping the loose piece of skin {{with a clean}} nail clipper or nail scissors, and applying over-the-counter <b>antibiotic</b> <b>ointment</b> if the area appears inflamed.

40|$|Backgraund. Officinal {{basis for}} the <b>antibiotic</b> <b>ointments</b> {{according}} to the 4 th Yugoslav Pharmacopoeia is a hydrophobic base containing only aliphatic hydrocarbons. The fact that antibiotics are predominantly not lipophylic raises {{the question about the}} suitability of that particular type of the base for the manufacturing of <b>antibiotic</b> <b>ointments.</b> Recent studies of the lipid analysis of the skin corneal layer indicated that lipids had shown the bilamellar organization in the skin intercorneal space. Such structural organization could be seen in the ambiphylic bases whose structure was based on carefully selected emulsifier couple, consisting of the lyotropic and thermotropic liquid crystals. The aim {{of this study was to}} test the velocity of antibiotics (klindamycin hydrochloride, erythromycin base and chloramphenicol) release from the hydrophobic ointment-type bases, and from ambiphylic bases of anionic and non-ionic types. Methods. Membrane-free agar diffusion test as the basic method for testing the release velocity in vitro and Staphylococcus aureus as the strain highly susceptible to the chosen antibiotics were used. All the analyzed samples were manufactured as the suspension-type ointments. Results. The highest growth inhibition zone of the Staphylococcus aureus strain for all three analyzed antibiotics was achieved from the non-ionogenic ambiphylic base; the clear growth inhibition zone area for Staphylococcus aureus strain in the preparations containing anionic ambiphylic base was smaller by 10 - 31. 28 %, and in the preparations containing aliphatic hydrocarbon-type base, the decrease was 11. 46 - 31. 28 %, compared to the results achieved with the non-ionogenic ambiphylic base. Conclusion. The optimal release velocity for the analyzed antibiotics was achieved from the non-ionic ambiphylic base...|$|R
25|$|The use of topical {{antibiotics}} on surgical {{wounds to}} reduce infection rates has been questioned. <b>Antibiotic</b> <b>ointments</b> {{are likely to}} irritate the skin, slow healing, and could increase risk of developing contact dermatitis and antibiotic resistance. It has been also been suggested that topical antibiotics should only be used when a person shows signs of infection {{and not as a}} preventative. A systematic review published by Cochrane (organisation) in 2016, though, concluded that topical antibiotics applied over certain types of surgical wounds reduce the risk of surgical site infections, when compared to no treatment or use of Antiseptics. The review also did not find conclusive evidence to suggest that topical antibiotics increased the risk of local skin reactions or antibiotic resistance.|$|R
50|$|Neosporin is {{the brand}} name for a product {{produced}} by Johnson & Johnson that contains neomycin sulfate, polymyxin B, and bacitracin.

50|$|Conch piercings are {{cared for}} just like other piercings {{in the ear}} cartilage. Sea salt soaks are {{recommended}} twice daily at a minimum to clean the piercing and jewelry, soften dried lymph, partially sterilize the area (via the salt), alleviate soreness and swelling, and promote {{blood flow to the}} area with the warm water in order to aid the healing process. Over-washing, the use of things such as alcohol and peroxide, and the use of <b>antibiotic</b> <b>ointments</b> should be avoided, as the former two will cause the wound to dry out, and the latter will cut off the air supply, both of which will inhibit healing. A competent piercer will recommend the best jewelry to wear while healing, and jewelry should not be removed or changed for at least eight weeks.|$|R

25|$|Topical {{steroids and}} <b>antibiotic</b> <b>ointments</b> such as Neosporin {{have not only}} shown to be {{ineffective}} in treating dermatophytosis caused by Aphanoascus fulvescens, but have {{also been shown to}} enhance its fungal growth. Ringworm infections caused by A.fulvescens in animals have been successfully treated with anti-fungal drugs such as Tinactin, which contains tolnaftate as its active ingredient, and Grisactin, which contains griseofulvin as its active ingredient. However, topical treatment of human A.fulvescens infections with tolnaftate-containing drugs has been shown to worsen the lesions, causing further inflammation and increased sensitivity. Treatment with griseofulvin has proven somewhat effective in reducing lesion sizes and appears to have a dose-dependent effect. It should be noted however that while lesions continue to heal after increased griseofulvin administration, there is some residual scarring of the infected area. Currently, there is no documentation providing evidence of an anti-fungal treatment that is completely effective against human dermatophytosis caused by A.fulvescens.|$|R
