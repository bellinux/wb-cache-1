60|$|Out of the {{commercial}} treaty grew {{the whole of the}} great financial scheme of 1860. By his first budget Mr. Gladstone had marked out this year for a notable epoch in finance. Happily it found him at the exchequer. The expiry of certain annuities payable to the public creditor removed a charge of some two millions, and Mr. Gladstone was vehemently resolved that this amount should not “pass into the great gulf of expenditure there to be swallowed up.” If the year, in such circumstances, is to pass, he said to Cobden, “without anything done for trade and the masses, it will be a great discredit and a great calamity.” The <b>alterations</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> required for the French treaty were made possible by the lapse of the annuities, and laid the foundation of a plan that averted the discredit and calamity of doing nothing for trade, and nothing for the masses of the population. France engaged to reduce duties and remove prohibitions on a long list of articles of British production and export, iron the most important,—“the daily bread of all industries,” as Cobden called it. England engaged immediately to abolish all duties upon all manufactured articles at her ports, and to reduce the duties on wine and brandy. The English reductions and abolitions extended beyond France to the commodities of all countries alike. Mr. Gladstone called 1860 the last of the cardinal and organic years of emancipatory fiscal legislation; it ended a series of which the four earlier terms had been reached in 1842, in 1845, in 1846, and 1853. With the French treaty, he used to say, the movement in favour of free trade reached its zenith.|$|R
60|$|The {{increase}} <b>of</b> the <b>duties</b> on beer {{has been}} regularly progressive, or nearly so, {{to a very}} large amount.[43] It {{is a good deal}} above a million, and is more than equal to one eighth of the whole produce. Under this general head some other liquors are included,--cider, perry, and mead, as well as vinegar and verjuice; but these are of very trifling consideration. The excise duties on wine, having sunk a little during {{the first two years of}} the war, were rapidly recovering their level again. In 1795 a heavy additional duty was imposed upon them, and a second in the following year; yet, being compared with four years of peace to 1790, they actually exhibit a small gain to the revenue. And low as the importation may seem in 1796, when contrasted with any year since the French treaty in 1787, it is still more than 3000 tuns above the average importation for three years previous to that period. I have added sweets, from which our factitious wines are made; and I would have added spirits, but that the total <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>duties</b> in 1789, and the recent interruption of our distilleries, rendered any comparison impracticable.|$|R
5000|$|The {{formation}} of a “political union” {{for the purpose of}} organizing petitions was the primary form of political activity of the era, and had resulted in the “Great Reform Act” of 1832 in Britain. [...] The new Association was intended to politically represent the “mechanical interest” only - that is, masters and their journeymen - “either by petition to the Legislature, or to any other branch of Government, for any <b>alteration</b> or extension <b>of</b> <b>duties,</b> by inforcing the law against such as may violate it to their injury, by addresses to the public or its own members.” [...] As such it is similar to the National Union of the Working Classes (founded in 1831) in London, which was to instigate the Chartist movement in 1838, or the American Workingmen’s party in New York.|$|R
40|$|The {{establishment}} of a permanently manned Space Station represents a substantial challenge {{in the design of}} a life support system, specifically in the need to supply a large crew for missions of extended duration. The Space Station will evolve by time phased modular increments delivered and supplied by the Space Shuttle and other advanced launch systems. With the addition of each subsequent phase or <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> mission <b>duties,</b> the requirements <b>of</b> the Station may differ from previous phases of development. With the addition of future crews and pressurized volume throughout the lifetime of the Space Station, change-out of individual subsystems may be necessary {{in order to meet the}} performance, safety, and reliability levels required from the Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS). The analysis of this system growth demands the capability for advanced, integrated assessment techniques so that the unique mission drivers during each phase and mission scenario may be identified and evaluated. In order to determine the impacts of the interdependency between the ECLSS, the crew, the various user experiments, and the other distributed systems, consideration must be given to all Space Station resources and requirements during the initial and subsequent evolution phase. Therefore, it is necessary for analysis efforts to study the long term effects of established designs. These studies must quantify the optimal degree of loop closure within the capabilities of existing and future technologies including any resulting maintenance and logistics requirements. In addition, the necessity for subsystem retrofit during the lifetime of the Station must be examined. The source of system requirements due to long term exposure to the microgravity environment is illustrated, the criticality of the ECLSS functions is reviewed, and a method is described to develop an optimal design during each configuration based on the cross-consumption of Station resources. A comparison utilizing this procedure is discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{reliance on}} information technology to support business processes has emphasised {{the need for}} information security mechanisms. This, however, has resulted in an ever-increasing workload in terms of security administration. Policy-based approaches have been proposed, promising to lighten the workload of security administrators. Separation <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> is one <b>of</b> the principles cited as a requirement when setting up these policy-based mechanisms. Different types <b>of</b> separation <b>of</b> <b>duty</b> policies exist.

However, {{it is not}} clear effect of oxidative stress on pharmacokinetics. Organic anion transporting polypeptides (human: OATPs, rodent: Oatps) are important for uptake of endogenous and exogenous compounds into hepatocytes. Thus, <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> OATPs/Oatps expression level may affect pharmacokinetics of various drugs. In this study, we investigated the <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> OATPs/Oatps expression levels and function by oxidative stress, and the effect <b>of</b> <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> those on pharmacokinetics of a typical OATPs/Oatps substrate pravastatin. OATPs/Oatps expression levels and function were altered by H 2 O 2 -induced oxidative stress in in vitro experiments. The <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> Oatps expression by oxidative stress also occurred in in vivo experiments. Oatp 1 a 1, Oatp 1 a 4 and Oatp 1 b 2 expression in the liver were decreased in rats fed powdery diet containing 2 % inosine, which induces oxidative stress through activation of xanthine oxidase, for 1 day. The decrease in Oatps expression levels by oxidative stress caused the suppression of pravastatin uptake to the liver, and resulted in high plasma concentration of pravastatin and low biliary excretion. In conclusion, oxidative stress induces <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> OATPs/Oatps expression and function in hepatocytes, resulting in <b>alteration</b> <b>of</b> pharmacokinetics of their substrates.
