5|$|Around noon, as {{a result}} of poor {{coordination}} and signaling, the Swedish line unexpectedly turned toward the allied fleet. When the flagship Kronan came <b>about</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> maneuver it suddenly heeled over and began to take in water. According to master gunner Anders Gyllenspak, the sails were not reefed and the ship leaned over so hard that water flooded in through the lower gunports. As the ship was leaning over, a gust of wind pushed the ship on her side, bringing her masts and sails down in line with the surface of the sea. Shortly afterwards, the gunpowder store exploded and ripped the forward section of the starboard side apart. Kronan quickly lost buoyancy and sank, taking most of her 850-man crew with her.|$|E
5|$|Comfort, however, {{asserts that}} McClintock was well {{regarded}} by her professional peers, {{even in the}} early years of her career. Although Comfort argues that McClintock was not a victim of gender discrimination, she has been widely written <b>about</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of women's studies. Most recent biographical works on women in science feature accounts of her experience. She is held up as a role model for girls in such works of children's literature as Edith Hope Fine's Barbara McClintock, Nobel Prize Geneticist, Deborah Heiligman's Barbara McClintock: Alone in Her Field and Mary Kittredge's Barbara McClintock. A recent biography for young adults by Naomi Pasachoff, Barbara McClintock, Genius of Genetics, provides a new perspective, based on the current literature.|$|E
5|$|Frederick's army became {{bogged down}} in the Reppen Forest. The day was already hot and sultry, and the men were already tired. The trees were thick and the ground was {{unstable}} and oozy in some parts, which made {{the movement of the}} heavy guns difficult. Delay after delay slowed them down. The carriages pulling the biggest guns, traveling with the bulk of the army, were too wide to cross the narrow forest bridges and the columns had to be reshuffled in the woods. The Russians could hear them, but thought they were scouting parties, albeit noisy ones; they calculated Finck's column was the primary force. Between 5:00 am. and 6:00 am., only Finck's demonstrating corps, to the north by Trettin, were visible to the Russians. Finck's right wing moved out of the hills toward the mill on Hühner Fleiss; more Prussians from Finck's left and center prepared to attack the Walkberge. Finck's artillery awaited Frederick's signal, but the bulk of Frederick's army still crashed <b>about</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> woods.|$|E

5|$|Leaves of Ficus obliqua {{serve as}} a food source for the larvae of the {{butterfly}} species the common crow (Euploea core), the no-brand crow (Euploea alcathoe), and the Geometer moth species Scopula epigypsa. The thrips species Gynaikothrips australis feeds {{on the underside of}} new leaves of F. obliqua, as well as F. rubiginosa and F. macrophylla. As plant cells die, nearby cells are induced into forming meristem tissue. A gall results and the leaves become distorted and curl over. The thrips remain in the galls at night and wander <b>about</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> daytime before returning in the evening, possibly to different galls about the tree. The thrips begin feeding when the tree has flushes of new growth, and the life cycle is around six weeks. At other times, thrips reside on old leaves without feeding or pupate sheltered in the bark.|$|E
5|$|The United States trade dollar was {{a dollar}} coin minted by the United States Mint {{to compete with}} other large silver trade coins that were already popular in East Asia. The idea first came <b>about</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1860s, {{when the price of}} silver began to decline due to {{increased}} mining efforts in the western United States. A bill providing in part for the issuance of the trade dollar was eventually put before Congress, where it was approved and later signed into law as the Coinage Act of 1873. The act made trade dollars legal tender up to five dollars. A number of designs were considered for the trade dollar, and an obverse and reverse created by William Barber were selected.|$|E

Towards {{the end of the}} video, groups of schoolchildren are shown dancing in the corridor as the boy she liked, now an adult, is following Carey around the school and trying to flirt with her, but Carey brushes him off.

Portions of the work contain Greek, Latin and Hebrew inscriptions. The original gilt frames contain Biblical passages in Latin drawn from the books of Isaiah, Deuteronomy and Revelation. According to a date written in Russian on their reverse, the panels were transferred to canvas supports in 1867.|$|E
