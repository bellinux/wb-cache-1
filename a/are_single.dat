5|$|At the 2001 UK census, the Middlewich wards of Cledford and Kinderton {{had a total}} {{population}} of 13,101. Middlewich's population is relatively young; the proportion of children (aged 0–15) is 3% {{higher than the national}} average. Households are larger than average, consistent with a younger population, with an average of 2.51 people per household, compared to the national average of 2.36. Approximately 25% <b>are</b> <b>single</b> person households, compared to 30% nationally; the majority (almost 85%) of Middlewich's housing stock is owner-occupied.|$|E

5|$|Mysore {{railway station}} has three lines, {{connecting}} it to Bengaluru, Mangalore and Chamarajanagar. The first railway line {{established in the}} city was the Bengaluru–Mysuru Junction metre gauge line, which was commissioned in 1882. All railway lines that serve the city <b>are</b> <b>single</b> track at some points {{and the rest of}} the stretch is double track, impeding faster connections to the city. All trains that connect to Mysuru are operated by South Western Railway Zone, Hubli of Indian Railways. The fastest train to serve the city is the Shatabdi Express.|$|E

50|$|By the 1960s more {{passenger}} closures took place, and the rationalisation of some over-provision {{of infrastructure}} was also implemented. The Aberdare branch {{was closed to}} passengers on 16 March 1964, and the line <b>was</b> <b>singled</b> in 1968. The Maerdy branch (Rhondda Fach) passenger service was withdrawn on 15 June 1964, and the branch <b>was</b> <b>singled</b> later that year. The Blaenrhondda branch was closed in 1966, and in June 1966 the Bute Road branch <b>was</b> <b>singled.</b> The Penarth branch <b>was</b> <b>singled</b> in February 1967, and the west-to-north curve at Pontypridd was closed on 5 August 1968.|$|R
5|$|The jaguar (Panthera onca) {{is a big}} cat, a feline in the Panthera genus, and is {{the only}} extant Panthera species native to the Americas. The jaguar is the third-largest feline species after the tiger and the lion, and the largest in the Americas. The jaguar's present range extends from Southwestern United States and Mexico across much of Central America and south to Paraguay and {{northern}} Argentina. Though there <b>are</b> <b>single</b> cats now living within the western United States, the species has largely been extirpated from the United States since the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|For {{those who}} <b>are</b> <b>single</b> when injured or who become single, SCI causes {{difficulties}} and insecurities {{with respect to}} one's ability to meet new partners and start relationships. In some settings, beauty standards cause people to view disabled bodies as less attractive, limiting the options for sexual and romantic partners {{of people with disabilities}} like SCI. Furthermore, physical disabilities are stigmatized, causing people to avoid contact with disabled people, particularly those with highly visible conditions like SCI. The stigma may cause people with SCI to experience self-consciousness and embarrassment in public. They can increase their social success by using impression management techniques to change how they are perceived and create a more positive image of themselves in others' eyes. Physical limitations create difficulties; with lowered independence comes reduced social interaction and fewer opportunities to find partners. Difficulties with mobility and the lack of disabled accessibility of social spaces (e.g. lack of wheelchair ramps) create a further barrier to social activity and limit the ability to meet partners. Isolation and its associated risk of depression can be limited by participating in physical activities, social gatherings, clubs, and online chat and dating.|$|E
5|$|Lafayette College {{guarantees}} campus {{housing to}} all enrolled students. The school {{requires students to}} live in campus housing unless approved for residing in private off-campus housing or home as a commuter. The College offers on-campus housing options including traditional halls, Greek chapter houses, suite-style halls, and group living units; where some halls <b>are</b> <b>single</b> gender while others may be co-ed by floor, wing, room, or suite. In addition, Lafayette College provides specialty housings that ties to specific academic departments, student organizations, or religious affiliations. Other residences include the McKelvy House, the Arts Houses, the French/German House, Hispanic Society of Lafayette, and the Hillel House.|$|E

5|$|The pigeye shark {{is a very}} robust-bodied {{species with}} a short, broad, and rounded snout. The small and {{circular}} eyes are equipped with nictitating membranes. The anterior rims of the nostrils bear medium-sized flaps of skin. The mouth forms a wide arch and has barely noticeable furrows at the corners. There are 11–13 (usually 12) upper and 10–12 (usually 11) lower tooth rows on each side; in addition, there <b>are</b> <b>single</b> rows of tiny teeth at {{the upper and lower}} symphyses (jaw midpoints). The teeth are broad and triangular with serrated edges; those in the lower jaw are slightly narrower, more upright, and more finely serrated than those in the upper. The five pairs of gill slits are of moderate length.|$|E
5|$|The {{roots of}} a tree serve to anchor {{it to the ground}} and gather water and {{nutrients}} to transfer to all parts of the tree. They are also used for reproduction, defence, survival, energy storage and many other purposes. The radicle or embryonic root is the first part of a seedling to emerge from the seed during the process of germination. This develops into a taproot which goes straight downwards. Within a few weeks lateral roots branch {{out of the side of}} this and grow horizontally through the upper layers of the soil. In most trees, the taproot eventually withers away and the wide-spreading laterals remain. Near the tip of the finer roots <b>are</b> <b>single</b> cell root hairs. These are in immediate contact with the soil particles and can absorb water and nutrients such as potassium in solution. The roots require oxygen to respire and only a few species such as the mangrove and the pond cypress (Taxodium ascendens) can live in permanently waterlogged soil.|$|E
5|$|Tower C is {{different}} from Towers A and B in several ways, but primarily {{in the fact that}} its rooms <b>are</b> <b>single</b> occupancy. The rooms are 2/3 the size of rooms in Towers A and B, and like Tower A and Tower B, every third floor has a lounge containing a television, couches, and tables for extra study. In addition, each floor has 30 rooms, except floors containing a lounge, which have 27. No official specialized student communities are housed in Tower C, but designated male and female floors are 24-hour Quiet Living Communities. Up until 2010-11, Tower C was open to students of any year, however it now houses primarily first-year students.|$|E

5|$|The Book of Kells {{contains}} the four Gospels of the Christian scriptures written in black, red, purple, and yellow ink in an insular majuscule script, preceded by prefaces, summaries, and concordances of Gospel passages. Today, {{it consists of}} 340 vellum leaves, or folios. The majority of the folios are part of larger sheets, called bifolios, which are folded in half to form two folios. The bifolios are nested inside {{of each other and}} sewn together to form gatherings called quires. On occasion, a folio is not part of a bifolio but is instead a single sheet inserted within a quire. The extant folios are gathered into 38 quires. There are between four and twelve folios (two to six bifolios) per quire; the folios are commonly, but not invariably, bound in groups of ten. Some folios <b>are</b> <b>single</b> sheets, as is frequently the case with the important decorated pages. The folios had lines drawn for the text, sometimes on both sides, after the bifolios were folded. Prick marks and guide lines can still be seen on some pages. The vellum is of high quality, although the folios have an uneven thickness, with some being close to leather while others are so thin as to be almost translucent.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} {{one and two}} player modes, both {{of which}} <b>are</b> <b>single</b> screen. In the first mode, {{the objective is to}} enter math answers in order to receive points. These questions include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. In the two player mode, two players control two characters as they race to create a math formula to reach the number shown by Donkey Kong, incorporating platform gameplay. The mechanics are similar to Donkey Kong Jr.; players climb vines to reach higher areas in order to collect numbers scattered around the area. In order to complete mathematics problems, players must collect at least three things: the first number, the symbol necessary to reach the number shown by Donkey Kong, and the second number. When the game features a high number, such as 66, players must collect multiple numbers and mathematics symbols in order to reach this. For example, players could choose a nine, a multiplication symbol, and a seven, followed by an addition symbol and a three to reach the number 66. The two player game have two different levels, Calculate A and Calculate B. Calculate B is more challenging: Donkey Kong can ask for negative numbers, and the absolute values of the target numbers are in the hundreds instead of the tens.|$|E
5|$|The lichen has a {{distinct}} prothallus—fibers of whitish fungal hyphae at the edge that lack photobiont, and which project beyond the thallus onto the growing surface. The prothallus is red to whitish in the inner part, red the in outer part. The surface of the thallus {{does not have a}} well-defined cortex, an outer layer of well-packed hyphae. The medulla (a loosely arranged layer of hyphae below the cortex and photobiont zone) is whitish but the lower part is red. It has few to many calcium oxalate crystals that are 3–8μm diameter. The hyphae of the medulla have many such crystals on the walls, that are 1–2μm in diameter. The algal photobiont (technically a phycobiont, as it is a green algal photosynthetic partner) is from the genus Trentepohlia. Normally, the algae is long and filamentous; when in the lichen state, it is divided into shorter filaments. The alga has a large chloroplast that contains droplets of beta-carotene. The lichen is heteromerous, meaning that the mycobiont and photobiont components are in well-defined layers, with the photobiont in a more or less distinct zone between the upper cortex and the medulla. Cells <b>are</b> <b>single</b> or a few cells aggregated, with dimensions of about 8–15 by 5–11μm.|$|E
