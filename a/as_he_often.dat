5|$|Cynesige died on 22 December 1060 and {{was buried}} at Peterborough, {{in what is}} now Peterborough Cathedral. After his death, he was honoured as a saint by the monks at Peterborough, {{although}} the cult {{does not seem to have}} spread far. His bones, along with those of his predecessor Ælfric Puttoc, were found in 1643. His reputation for sanctity and poverty was based on his actions, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>often</b> traveled on foot, and spent much time preaching and giving alms. The Northumbrian Priests' Law which is usually attributed to Wulfstan II, Archbishop of York, might have been authored instead by Cynesige, or possibly Cynesige's predecessor Ælfric Puttoc. He gave gifts to Peterborough in his will, but the gifts were taken by Queen Edith instead.|$|E
5|$|Harald's reign {{was marked}} by his {{background}} as a military commander, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>often</b> solved disputes with harsh force. One of his skalds even boasted about how Harald broke settlements he had made, in his battles in the Mediterranean. While the sagas largely focus on Harald's war with Sweyn and the invasion of England, little is said about his domestic policies. Modern historians have taken this as a sign that, despite his absolutism, his reign was one of peace and progress for Norway. Harald is considered to have instituted good economic policies, as he developed a Norwegian currency and a viable coin economy, which in turn allowed Norway to participate in international trade. He initiated trade with Kievan Rus' and the Byzantine Empire through his connections, {{as well as with}} Scotland and Ireland. According to the later sagas, Harald founded Oslo, where he spent much time.|$|E
5|$|House {{was filmed}} {{on one of}} Toho's largest sets, where Obayashi shot the film without a {{storyboard}} {{over a period of}} about two months. Obayashi described the attitude on the set as very upbeat <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>often</b> skipped, sang and played quiz games with the younger actresses on the set. Despite having fun on the set, members of the Toho crew felt the film was nonsense. Obayashi found the acting of the seven girls to be poor while trying to direct them verbally. He began playing the film's soundtrack on set, which changed the way the girls were acting in the film as they got into the spirit of the music. Actress Kimiko Ikegami was uncomfortable about a nude scene in the film. To make her more comfortable, Yoko Minamida also took off her clothes. After Obayashi saw Minamida nude, he included a nude scene for her in the film which was not in the original script.|$|E

5|$|In 844, {{according}} to Byzantine sources, Theoktistos learned of an Arab invasion of Byzantine Asia Minor, {{led by a}} certain 'Amr, probably the semi-autonomous emir of Malatya, Umar al-Aqta. The Arab sources do not make explicit mention of this campaign. The Russian scholar Alexander Vasiliev, however, identified it with an expedition recorded in the poems of Abu Tammam and Buhturi, which was led by general Abu Sa'id and {{took place during the}} regency of Theodora. Umar al-Aqta's participation is likely, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>often</b> aided the Abbasids in their raids against the Byzantines. According to Arab accounts, the troops led by Abu Sa'id comprised men from the border emirates of Qaliqala (Erzurum) and Tarsus. The Arab forces united at Ardandun (possibly the border fort of Rhodandos) before raiding through the Byzantine themes of Cappadocia, Anatolikon, Boukellarion, and Opsikion. Sa'id's troops sacked Dorylaion and even reached the shore of the Bosporus.|$|E
5|$|In December 2003, Kesler was {{released}} by the Vancouver Canucks {{to play in the}} 2004 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, Kesler's second World Junior tournament. Kesler scored two goals as the Americans went a perfect 4–0 to win Pool A and advance to the semifinals. There they defeated Finland 2–1, the team that had defeated them in the previous year's bronze medal game, to advance to the gold medal game versus Canada. In the gold medal game, Kesler scored the game-tying goal 6:58 into the third period to even the score at 3–3. After Canadian goaltender Marc-André Fleury cleared the puck off of teammate Braydon Coburn and into his own net, the Americans took the lead 4–3 and went on to win their first IIHF World U20 Championship in the tournament's history. Kesler's play in the tournament was praised <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>often</b> took critical faceoffs and played on the Americans' most offensive line despite suffering a facial injury early in the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Located in St John's Lodge in the Inner Circle of Regent's Park, the IOA {{was founded}} in 1937, largely by {{archaeologist}} Mortimer Wheeler, but until 1946 relied primarily upon volunteer lecturers. Childe's relationship with the conservative Wheeler was strained, the latter being intolerant of the shortcomings of others, something Childe made an effort never to be. He was popular among students, who saw him as a kindly eccentric; they commissioned a bust of Childe from Marjorie Maitland Howard. His lecturing was nevertheless considered poor, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>often</b> mumbled and walked into an adjacent room to find something while continuing to talk. He consistently referred to the socialist states of eastern Europe by their full official titles, and called towns by their Slavonic rather than Germanic names, further confusing his students. He was deemed better at giving tutorials and seminars, where he devoted more time to interacting with his students. As Director, Childe was not obliged to excavate, though he did undertake projects at the Orkney Neolithic burial tombs of Quoyness (1951) and Maes Howe (1954–55).|$|E

5|$|Valbuena {{began his}} {{football}} career at hometown club ES Blanquefort. He developed {{an interest in}} the sport of football through his paternal heritage <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>often</b> attended matches at the Camp Nou in Barcelona during school holidays as a youth. At the age of nine, his football career was put on hold after he received over 50 stitches in one of his legs following a swimming accident. After the injury healed, Valbuena returned to football and quickly impressed club coaches. In 1998, he was given a Best Player award at a local youth tournament played at the Camp des Loges, the training center of professional club Paris Saint-Germain. In 2001, Valbuena was recruited by professional club FC Girondins de Bordeaux.|$|E

25|$|Multitudes of sweets are {{referred}} to in the stories; many have a violent or bizarre side effect, especially those created by Fred and George Weasley.

25|$|Justice Black {{wrote for}} the majority. It was {{delivered}} exactly {{three weeks after the}} oral hearing on June 2nd.

25|$|Liang Mao {{was born}} in Changyi County (昌邑縣), Shanyang Commandery (山陽郡), which is located {{northwest}} of present-day Jinxiang County, Shandong sometime in the late Eastern Han dynasty. Studious since childhood, he was known for being well-versed in Confucian classics <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>often</b> quoted lines from the classics to support his points during debates.|$|E
25|$|The humour of Hay's films {{has been}} {{described}} as subversive and similar to that of fellow English comedian Frank Randle. His films are often characterised as exhibiting traits of Anti-authoritarianism and having a satirical approach towards how authority figures are portrayed, this is notable with Hay himself, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>often</b> played an incompetent authority figure who struggled not to be found out, but whose idiocy was discovered by those around him.|$|E

In his first appearance, when played by Norton, <b>he</b> introduces himself <b>as</b> Ferdinand Ian Gilmour Newton. All later appearances were by Mills, and in these appearances Rumpole refers to him as Ferdinand Isaac Gerald Newton.|$|R
5000|$|<b>He</b> is <b>often</b> {{considered}} a [...] "replacement" [...] coach, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was <b>often</b> appointed {{in his career}} to replace fired managers from Serie A teams fighting to avoid relegation, or Serie B teams which managed to promote.|$|R
25|$|During production, {{the cast}} {{attempted}} to make Lucas laugh or smile, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>often</b> appeared depressed. At one point, the project became so demanding that Lucas was diagnosed with hypertension and exhaustion and was warned to reduce his stress level. Post-production was equally stressful due to increasing pressure from 20th Century Fox. Moreover, Mark Hamill's car accident left his face visibly scarred, which restricted re-shoots.|$|E
25|$|Another {{theme in}} the show is Sam's {{confusion}} about police work in 1973, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>often</b> mistakenly mentions techniques and technologies that were not used in 1973, such as two-way mirrors. One such theme is that Sam continually gives criminals the updated version {{of the right to}} silence warning, which was changed in 1994. When he does so, someone around him usually points out that he is giving the warning incorrectly.|$|E
25|$|His {{victims were}} usually young, petite, brunette women. One {{of his victims}} was a man but he is {{believed}} to have mistaken the man for a woman <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>often</b> wore a ponytail. All of the stores attacked were speciality stores and were usually only robbed of a few hundred dollars. He is also suspected of shooting three more store clerks in Texas during 1993 and 1994, one of whom survived.|$|E

25|$|On July 11, 2007, Florida Marlins team {{president}} David Samson was {{featured on the}} show <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>often</b> is. When told by Dan about the report of Seattle Mariners player Ichiro Suzuki signing a 5-year, $100 million contract, Samson {{was in a state}} of disbelief. He went on to say that no player in baseball was worthy of that amount and that this deal would surely return the league to the days of ridiculous contracts, surely ruining the sport.|$|E
25|$|Wright {{responded to}} the {{transformation}} of domestic life that occurred {{at the turn of}} the 20th century, when servants became less prominent or completely absent from most American households, by developing homes with progressively more open plans. This allowed the woman of the house to work in her 'workspace', <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>often</b> called the kitchen, yet keep track of and be available for the children and/or guests in the dining room. Much of modern architecture, including the early work of Mies van der Rohe, can be traced back to Wright's innovative work.|$|E
25|$|Rhodes {{used his}} wealth {{and that of}} his {{business}} partner Alfred Beit and other investors to pursue his dream of creating a British Empire in new territories to the north by obtaining mineral concessions from the most powerful indigenous chiefs. Rhodes' competitive advantage over other mineral prospecting companies was his combination of wealth and astute political instincts, also called the 'imperial factor', <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>often</b> collaborated with the British Government. He befriended its local representatives, the British Commissioners, and through them organised British protectorates over the mineral concession areas via separate but related treaties. In this way he obtained both legality and security for mining operations. He could then attract more investors. Imperial expansion and capital investment went hand in hand.|$|E
