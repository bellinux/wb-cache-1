5000|$|Each antenna in a DVOR uses an {{omnidirectional}} antenna. These {{are usually}} <b>Alford</b> <b>Loop</b> antennas (see Andrew Alford). Unfortunately, the sideband antennas {{are very close}} together, so that approximately 55% of the energy radiated is absorbed by the adjacent antennas. Half of that is re-radiated, and half is sent back along the antenna feeds of the adjacent antennas. The result is an antenna pattern {{that is no longer}} omnidirectional. This causes the effective sideband signal to be amplitude modulated at 60 Hz as far as the aircraft's receiver is concerned. The phase of this modulation can affect the detected phase of the sub-carrier. This effect is called [...] "coupling".|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{modified}} <b>Alford</b> <b>loop</b> antenna for on-body communication system is proposed. The proposed antenna {{operating in the}} ISM band is designed with consideration of human body effect. One of advantages of the <b>Alford</b> <b>loop</b> antenna structure is low-profile, however the <b>Alford</b> <b>loop</b> antenna is not suitable for on-body devices since {{it does not have}} a ground plane for other electronic part of on-body system and requires balanced feeding structure. To be embedded on on-body devices, the proposed antenna is design with the unbalanced feed structure and ground. The performance of the proposed antenna is simulated and measured when it is placed on the human body phantom to consider the effect of the human body. The proposed antenna a 10 dB return loss bandwidth over the ISM band and monopole-like radiation pattern with low-profile. The antenna has the surface of appropriate for on-body commu...|$|E

40|$|A triband {{omnidirectional}} {{circularly polarized}} dielectric resonator antenna with a top-loaded modified <b>Alford</b> <b>loop</b> for GSM, WLAN, and WiMAX applications is proposed. Fed by an axial probe, the DRA (dielectric resonator antenna) radiates like a vertically polarized electric monopole. The top-loaded modified <b>Alford</b> <b>loop</b> provides an equivalent horizontally polarized magnetic dipole mode at triband. Omnidirectional CP (circular polarized) fields {{can be obtained}} when the two orthogonally polarized fields are equal in amplitude with phase quadrature. The antenna has been successfully simulated, fabricated, and measured. The experimental and numerical results exhibit that the antenna can obtain usable CP bandwidths of 1. 925 – 1. 955 [*]GHz, 2. 36 – 2. 48 [*]GHz, and 3. 502 – 3. 53 [*]GHz with return loss larger than 10 [*]dB and axial ratio less than 3 [*]dB. In addition, over the three bands, the antenna obtains very good omnidirectional CP radiation patterns in the azimuth plane. Moreover, an average CP gain in the azimuth plane of 1. 2, 1. 6, and − 1. 5 [*]dBic for the lower, middle, and upper bands has been obtained...|$|E
40|$|When {{performing}} {{measurements of}} polarization diversity, {{it is common}} to use two dipole antennas, there one of the dipoles is rotated 90 degrees to measure horizontal polarization. A better approach would be to use a dual polarized antenna. In this thesis a dual polarized omnidirectional antenna, with a resonance frequency of 1800 MHz, is presented. It consist of a special kind of loop antenna, the <b>Alford</b> <b>loop,</b> and a discone antenna. These two parts provides two perpendicular polarizations, vertical and horizontal, and an omnidirectional radiation pattern. The antenna is first simulated using a computer model, and in order to verify the results a prototype antenna is built and measured. The results show good similarities between simulations and actual measurements for the return loss parameter S 11 at the desired frequency. i Acknowledgement...|$|E
