2500|$|The lumbosacral joint, {{between the}} sacrum {{and the last}} lumbar vertebra, has, like all vertebal joints, an {{intervertebral}} disc, anterior and posterior ligaments, ligamenta flava, interspinous and supraspinous ligaments, and synovial joints between the articular processes of the two bones. [...] In addition to these ligaments the joint is strengthened by the iliolumbar and lateral lumbosacral ligaments. [...] The iliolumbar ligament passes between {{the tip of the}} transverse process of the fifth lumbar vertebra and the posterior part of the iliac crest. [...] The lateral lumbosacral ligament, partly continuous with the iliolumbar ligament, passes down from the lower border of the transverse process of the fifth vertebra to the ala of the sacrum. [...] The movements possible in the lumbosacral joint are flexion and extension, a small amount of lateral flexion (from 7 degrees in childhood to 1 degree in adults), but no <b>axial</b> <b>rotation.</b> [...] Between ages 2–13 the joint is responsible for as much as 75% (about 18 degrees) of flexion and extension in the lumbar spine. From age 35 the ligaments considerably limit the range of motions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{notional}} tidal bulges {{are carried}} {{ahead of the}} Earth–Moon axis by the continents {{as a result of}} Earth's rotation. The eccentric mass of each bulge exerts a small amount of gravitational attraction on the Moon, with the bulge on the side of Earth closest to the Moon pulling in a direction slightly forward along the Moon's orbit (because Earth's rotation has carried the bulge forward). The bulge on the side furthest from the Moon has the opposite effect, but because the gravitational attraction varies inversely with the square of distance, the effect is stronger for the near-side bulge. As a result, some of Earth's angular (or rotational) momentum is gradually being transferred to the rotation of the Earth–Moon pair around their mutual centre of mass, called the barycentre. This slightly faster rotation causes the Earth–Moon distance to increase at approximately 38 millimetres per year. Conservation of angular momentum means that Earth's <b>axial</b> <b>rotation</b> is gradually slowing, and because of this its day lengthens by approximately 23 microseconds every year (excluding glacial rebound). Both figures are valid only for the current configuration of the continents. Tidal rhythmites from 620 million years ago show that, over hundreds of millions of years, the Moon receded at an average rate of [...] per year and the day lengthened at an average rate of 12 microseconds per year, both about half of their current values. See tidal acceleration for a more detailed description and references.|$|E

However, routine quantitative {{evaluation of}} <b>axial</b> vertebral <b>rotation</b> is difficult and error-prone due to the limitations of the observer, characteristics of the observed vertebral anatomy and specific imaging properties. The scope {{of this paper is to}} review the existing methods for quantitative evaluation of <b>axial</b> vertebral <b>rotation</b> from medical images along with all relevant publications, which may provide a valuable resource for studying the existing methods or developing new methods and evaluation strategies.

50|$|In {{terms of}} locomotion, Dilkes {{mentions}} that compared to Cacops, Dissorphus likely {{had a more}} flexible in terms of lateral flexion and <b>axial</b> <b>rotation.</b> Limitation to locomotion is solely based on anatomy of the osteoderms. As Dilkes explains, coupling between lateral flexion and <b>axial</b> <b>rotation</b> throughout the vertebrae, translates to limited locomotion. In the case of Cacops, Dilkes’s interpretation on the 20 degree angle of inclination of the zygapophyses indicate that coupling between lateral flexion and <b>axial</b> <b>rotation</b> is highly limited. In addition, there is extensive overlap between internal series and external series contributes to limitation of lateral flexion.In the case of Dissorophus, Dilkes gives more detail that there is larger angle of inclinations of zygapophyses indicating that there is greater coupling between the <b>axial</b> <b>rotation</b> and lateral flexion despite of insertion of the flanges in the neural spine.|$|E

50|$|The {{cause of}} gimbal lock is {{representing}} an orientation as three <b>axial</b> <b>rotations</b> with Euler angles. A potential solution therefore is {{to represent the}} orientation in some other way. This could be as a rotation matrix, a quaternion (see quaternions and spatial rotation), or a similar orientation representation that treats the orientation as a value rather than three separate and related values. Given such a representation, the user stores the orientation as a value. To apply angular changes, the orientation is modified by a delta angle/axis rotation. The resulting orientation must be re-normalized to prevent floating-point error from successive transformations from accumulating. For matrices, re-normalizing the result requires converting the matrix into its nearest orthonormal representation. For quaternions, re-normalization requires performing quaternion normalization.|$|R
