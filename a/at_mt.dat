5|$|Constantin von Tischendorf, {{who worked}} with {{numerous}} Bible manuscripts, was known as somewhat flamboyant, and had ambitiously sought money from several royal families for his ventures, who had indeed funded his trips. Simonides, whose name may be a synonym mocking Tischendorf, had a somewhat obscure history, as he claimed he was <b>at</b> <b>Mt.</b> Athos in the years preceding Tischendorf's contact, making the claim at least plausible. Simonides also claimed his father had died and the invitation to Mt. Athos came from his uncle, a monk there, but subsequent letters to his father were found among his possessions at his death. While the word 'forgery' has been bandied about among scholars regarding the claims on the Sinaiticus by Tischendorf, perhaps a more accurate rendering would be recollation and 'adjusted' restoration as Simonides, an expert on hieroglyphics which are represented throughout the Sinaiticus. Simonides claimed the false nature of the document in The Guardian in an exchange of letters among scholars and others, at the time. Henry Bradshaw, a British librarian known to both men, defended the Tischendorf find of the Sinaiticus, casting aside the accusations of Simonides. Since Bradshaw was a social 'hub' among many diverse scholars of the day, his aiding of Tischendorf was given much weight. Simonides died shortly after, and the issue lay dormant for many years.|$|E

Olinger said that the difference between Doyle's salaries <b>at</b> <b>Mt.</b> Healthy and Miami Trace was too small to reach the $10,000 threshold. Pressed by one of the justices, he admitted that he was not taking into account the difference it might have made {{over the course of several}} years of employment; however he said it was entirely possible that Doyle's potential top salary step at his new school would be higher than it might be <b>at</b> <b>Mt.</b> Healthy.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this work, we {{examined}} mechanisms of heat production by whole intact {{cells of the}} magnetotactic bacterium Magnetospirillum magneticum strain AMB- 1, {{as well as by}} their extracted chains of magnetosomes or extracted individual magnetosomes when exposed to an oscillating magnetic field of frequency 108 kHz and field amplitudes 23 and 88 mT. In this study, magnetosomes did not contain magnetite as the magnetite oxidized to maghemite. For intact bacterial cells that contain chains of magnetosomes, heat is generated through hysteresis losses, yielding specific absorption rates (SARs) of 115 ± 12 W/g Fe <b>at</b> 23 <b>mT</b> and 864 ± 9 W/g Fe <b>at</b> 88 <b>mT.</b> When the chains of magnetosomes are extracted from the bacterial cells and exposed to the same magnetic field, the heat-producing mechanism includes an additional contribution that is due to their rotation in the magnetic field. This contribution appeared to result in higher observed SARs of 864 ± 13 W/g Fe <b>at</b> 23 <b>mT</b> and 1242 ± 24 W/g Fe <b>at</b> 88 <b>mT.</b> SAR values of 529 ± 14 W/g Fe <b>at</b> 23 <b>mT</b> and 950 ± 18 W/g Fe <b>at</b> 88 <b>mT</b> were obtained with individual magnetosomes whose membranes had been removed...|$|R
