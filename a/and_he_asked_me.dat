2500|$|I {{remember}} in 1915 when I was {{deeply involved in}} cubist sculpture but was still in many ways not certain of what I was doing, I had {{a visit from the}} writer Jules Romains, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> what I was trying to do. I answered, [...] "I would like to make an art as pure as a crystal." [...] And he answered in a slightly mocking way, [...] "What do you know about crystals?" [...] At first I was upset by this remark and his attitude, but then, as I began to think about it, I realized that I knew nothing about crystals except that they were a form of inorganic life and that this was not what I wanted to make.|$|E
2500|$|Smith {{relocated}} to Hiram, Ohio, in September 1831. Smith and Rigdon were tarred and feathered at the John Johnson Farm on March 24, 1832. Smith recorded: [...] "The next morning I {{went to see}} elder Rigdon, and found him crazy, and his head highly inflamed, for they had dragged him by his heels, and those too, so high from the earth he could not raise his head from the rough frozen surface, which lascerated it exceedingly; {{and when he saw}} me he called to his wife to bring him his razor. She asked him what he wanted of it? and he replied to kill me. Sister Rigdon left the room, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> to bring his razor. I asked him what he wanted of it, and he replied he wanted to kill his wife, and he continued delirious some days." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{was first}} rumoured that Walsh {{was about to}} make a record deal with her band's record label, Fascination Records, {{although}} nothing has been confirmed. Soon after the rumour, Walsh confirmed on Suck My Pop, a programme that she co-hosts on the digital TV station Viva, that she will feature on English rapper Aggro Santos' upcoming single, [...] "Like U Like". The track will be her first step away from Girls Aloud as a singer. Walsh was asked for OK! Magazine: [...] "Kimberley, there are rumours, that you will be releasing a solo album..." [...] and Walsh said: [...] "Gosh! I haven't got any plan to do that. Gary Barlow signed Aggro Santos <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> to sing Like U Like, and I've done a song for the Horrid Henry film that I'm in titled [...] "Everybody Dance". I'm not sure about doing anything big on my own just yet." [...] In 2012 she made her West End theatre debut, playing Princess Fiona in the London production of Shrek the Musical. The announcement came after Amanda Holden announced her pregnancy in August 2011. Walsh teamed up with Alfie Boe to record a version of Queen's [...] "One Vision" [...] as the Official Olympic Team Great Britain Single. Walsh has also performed with several artists including Neyo with [...] "Hate That I Love You", Ronan Keating's [...] "No Matter What" [...] and James Cullum with [...] "Rainy Days and Mondays". In August 2012 it was announced that Walsh is in discussions with Gary Barlow to release a solo album for a 2013 release.|$|E

2500|$|Tendulkar's {{allegations}} {{were supported by}} former teammates such as Zaheer Khan, Harbhajan Singh and V. V. S. Laxman. Zaheer called Chappell a [...] "control freak" [...] and said, [...] "After he was appointed {{the coach of the}} Indian team, he once came upto me and told [...] "Zaheer, you will not be playing for India till I remain the coach". He also added that the two-year term under Chappell was [...] "easily the worst and darkest phase" [...] that he could remember. Harbhajan said, [...] "Chappell destroyed Indian cricket {{to such an extent that}} it required at least 3 years to again get back on track. The worst part was some players in that team, who sucked upto the coach and would supply selective misinformation creating bigger rifts". He also talked about the email leak, [...] "Sourav was batting out there in the middle and this man was typing a critical e-mail against Sourav, sitting right there in that dressing room. He had no interest in the proceedings of the match. There were seven guys that he wanted to get rid of. Sourav was his primary target followed by myself, Virender Sehwag, Ashish Nehra, Zaheer Khan and Yuvraj Singh". Laxman was also critical of Chappell in saying that Chappell took Indian cricket [...] "backwards" [...] during his coaching tenure. Laxman also recalled an incident from 2006, [...] "This happened in 2006 at the Wankhede Stadium when India played versus England. Yuvraj Singh was picked ahead of me. We were going to the West Indies for a four-Test series after that <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> if I would open. I mentioned in 2000 I had decided I would not open anymore after it didn't work for me in the first four years. I was consistent in the middle order since 2000. Chappell asked me my age and said - Don't you think 31 is too young an age to sit at home? I was astonished to hear this. I had a very good run under him. I was the second highest run scorer under him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't come in," [...] he said. [...] "I met Nasmyth {{down at the}} settlement. He'd {{just come}} back from Victoria, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> to bring this along." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{happened}} to meet Bobbie in Piccadilly, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> {{to come back}} to dinner at the flat. And, like a fool, instead of bolting and putting myself under police protection, I went.|$|E

6000|$|Old Bouvet {{was waiting}} in the passage when I entered, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> whether we might not crack a bottle of wine together. 'My faith, we must not be long,' said he. 'There are ten {{thousand}} of Theilmann's Prussians in the woods up yonder.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{good will}} you accomplish?" [...] said Mr. Washington; [...] "Lord Baltimore is notorious, {{and will not}} remove him.

60|$|He {{left at the}} end of {{the terms}} and I did not see him again until we were both young men. Then one day I ran against him in Oxford Street, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> to come and spend a few days with his people in Surrey.|$|E

40|$|I {{have been}} {{requested}} by a Fellow of this Society, whom circumstances prevent from himself representing the subject {{dealt with in}} these notes, {{to call attention to}} an error in the designation of a track which appeared in a paper on " The Highlands of Lake St. Clair," read at the November meeting by Colonel Legge, The member to whom I refer, Mr. T.

6000|$|... "Got a {{commission}} in the Turkish army. Queer thing I heard {{the other day}} from a man I used to know very well once. He's secretary at the Embassy now at Constantinople, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> whether I ever came across him. Seems he isn't particularly popular out there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yesterday. We {{went down}} town together, you remember, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> {{to step into}} his office. Well, we talked it over, and I left on the one o'clock for Newport to see Mr. Wing. Wonderful old man! I sat up with him till midnight--it wasn't any picnic"...|$|E
6000|$|... "You were {{standing}} with him, {{in front of}} the little house, when I save you yesterday. His name was Redbrook.

6000|$|... "I {{know that}} he came through Braster, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> for <b>me.</b> <b>He</b> looked {{in through the window}} of my cottage when Colonel Ray was with me. I saw him no more after that until I found him dead." ...|$|R
6000|$|We sang {{some of his}} old Adventist hymns {{together}} <b>and</b> then <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> what I {{was planning}} to do. [...] "I haven't any definite plans," [...] I answered, [...] "except to travel. I want to travel. I {{want to see the}} world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pshaw! I wasn't a bit embarrassed. I {{was just}} as much at my ease! <b>And</b> then <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> to let him hold the shaving down with his foot, while I went on with my poking. And I said yes he might----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “‘Can I do {{anything}} for you, John?’ I asked, and he replied, ‘No, Jack, I am dying; good-bye,’ <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> to grasp his hand. ‘Go help the rest,’ he whispered, gazing with fixed eyes toward where Captain Bernadou was still firing the forward gun.

6000|$|... "It {{is quite}} true," [...] he answered. [...] "He asked me where to go, and I {{say to the}} Folies Bergères.

6000|$|... "And now, {{will you}} {{let me know what}} you are {{thinking}} of doing?

6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} what I told him when he married me? I said, 'Adolf, it is a pity you are born in Germany.' <b>And</b> when <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> why, I told him that some day {{he might have been}} President of the United States." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{explanation}} satisfied {{him on that}} point, <b>and</b> being satisfied, <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> when I {{had left}} Pesaro. A moment I hesitated.|$|R
6000|$|... "Only {{to please}} Mr. Northcott, <b>and</b> because <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me.</b> <b>He</b> knew, I suppose, {{as well as}} I did myself, that it makes no difference, but I could not do less than go when he wished it, when {{he is the only}} person here who treats me unlike a Christian." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{appeared}} he {{had been}} in a seminary with six young Irishmen, all priests long since, who had received newspapers and kept him informed of the state of ecclesiastical affairs in England. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> eagerly after Dr. Pusey, for whose conversion the good man had continued ever since to pray night and morning.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. The {{confession}} (as {{you call}} it) which you make in your pretty note, {{is the very}} thing that Sir Patrick spoke to me about in the dining-room before I went away.

6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} wish to shield them, but it will do little good, Powell.

6000|$|... "Of course," [...] replies Dolly, sweetly; [...] "but never {{with a real}} man. Boys {{like you}} and Will and the Lloyds do not count.

6000|$|... "John {{has told}} me, Jabez, {{that he has}} several times met young Davenant, and that the boy is {{disposed}} to be friendly with him; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> has <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> to speak with you, to know whether you have any objection to his making a friend of him." ...|$|R
