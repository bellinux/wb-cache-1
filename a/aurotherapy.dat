Egzacerbacija reumatskog procesa u foku primjene zlata smatra se »reakcijom na auroterapiju«. Ona se obično javlja u početku liječenja, ali može nastati i kasnije. »Popratne pojave« u pravom smislu očituju se na koži, sluznicama, bubregu, živčanom sistemu i krvi. Te popratne pojave katkad zahtijevaju prekid auroterapije 62, 5 % bolesnika je završilo auroterapiju, a 32, 5 % moralo je prekinuti liječenje zbog popratnih pojava. Veliko značenje pridaje se profilaksi popratnih pojava. U tu svrhu potrebna je redovna kontrola kože i sluznica, te laboratorijski pregledi krvi i mokraće. Doze zlata treba povisivati postepeno i oprezno. Važno je, da se rani znaci intolerancije pravovremeno uoče i odmah primijene odgovarajuće mjere, jer se tako može izbjeći opasnost po bolesnika. In {{our series}} of 80 {{patients}} suffering from rheumatoid arthritis and treated with gold-salts the side-effects have been observed and analyzed. The results obtained are compared with data from literature. The symptoms of the basic disease growing worse {{in the sense of}} the exacerbation of the rheumatic process, which usually occurs at the beginning of the treatment but may appear also later, arc regarded as »the reaction to aurotherapy«. In one case they manifested themselves in a serious general clinical picture. Side-effects manifest themselves on the skin, on the mucous membranes, on the kidneys, on the nervous system and in the blood, and should always be met with caution; it is often necessary to discontinue <b>aurotherapy</b> or lo apply a special treatment. But there are several gradations and all side-effects are not equally heavy. In pruritus, a light itching, appearing gradually and usually ceasing when the dose of gold is reduced, is to be distinguished from a sudden, intense itching which is often an alarm for an: imminent dermatitis. Dermatitis was observed in four patients. Relatively frequent is a bitter metallic taste in the mouth, which usually ceases spontaneously; gingivitis was observed only in two patients. Temporary aches in the stomach or heart-burning do not indicate a serious danger, except for gastroduodenal ulcus in which case <b>aurotherapy</b> is not indicated. Side-effects on the kidney are not frequent but may be serious: in one case it came to a transitory slight albuminuria and cilindruria. The most serious side-effects may occur in the blood. Three heavy leucopenias, seven thrombopenias (in two cases they were combined) and two slight purpuras were recorded. In such cases the treatment must be discontinued immediately. Eosinophilia is a frequet sign of an approaching danger. All side-effects recorded passed and there were no permanent injuries. In 62. 5 % of the patients <b>aurotherapy</b> was fully applied, while in 32. 5 % it was discontinued on account of side-effects due to gold. Heavier side-effects require a special treatment: application of calcium and Vitamin C, corticosteroids, ACTH and BAL, which was applied in three patients with good results. Great importance is attached to the prevention of side-effects. For this purpose a regular control of the skin and mucous membranes is necessary, as well as regular laboratory examinations of the blood and urine. In addition, all patients were given vitamin C per is in doses of 2 g a day. The dose of gold should be increased gradually and cautiously. A small number of more serious side-effects shows that gold, under the precautions set forth, can successfully be applied in the therapy of rheumatoid arthritis. It is essential that the early signs of intolerance should be discovered in time and treated immediately, by which any danger for the patient is avoided...|$|E
40|$|Objective. To {{investigate}} {{effect of}} different disease modifying drugs (DMARDs) on X-ray progression, functional disability {{and quality of}} life in RA patients with disease duration of at least 10 years. Methods. 238 pts with RA (according to ARA 1987 criteria) with the beginning of disease at 1992 or later (30 male and 208 female) were included. Mean follow up duration was I 5, 5 ± 6, 4 years. X-ray changes were evaluated by Larsen method. Functional disability was assessed by HAQ {{and quality of life}} - by RAQol scale. Information about antirheumatic therapy was obtained by questioning of patients and from medical documentation. Results. There was no significant positive effect of DMARDs therapy on X-ray progression. Patients receiving gold salts (tauredon or chrisanol) for a long time had lower HAQ functional index (1, 34 ± 0, 76 in comparison with 1, 74 ± 0, 83 in patients without <b>aurotherapy,</b> p< 0, 0 l) and less prominent quality of life decrease according to RAQoL scale (19, 2 ± 6, 3 in comparison with 22, 11 : 5. 8. p< 0, 05). Other DMARDs had no significant independent positive effect on functional disability and quality of life at the end of long-term follow up. Conclusion. Retrospective evaluation of the results of long-term follow up showed that gold salts remained the drugs of choice in RA...|$|E
