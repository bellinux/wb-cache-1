5|$|<b>A</b> <b>key</b> <b>question</b> {{surrounding}} the FairTax {{is whether the}} tax {{has the ability to}} be revenue-neutral; that is, whether the tax would result in an increase or reduction in overall federal tax revenues. Economists, advisory groups, and political advocacy groups disagree about the tax rate required for the FairTax to be truly revenue-neutral. Various analysts use different assumptions, time-frames, and methods resulting in dramatically different tax rates making direct comparison among the studies difficult. The choice between static or dynamic scoring further complicates any estimate of revenue-neutral rates.|$|E
5|$|In biology, a hybrid, or crossbreed, is {{the result}} of {{combining}} the qualities of two organisms of different breeds, varieties, species or genera through sexual reproduction. Hybrids are not always intermediates between their parents (such as in blending inheritance), but can show hybrid vigour, often growing larger or taller than either parent. The concept of a hybrid is interpreted differently in animal and plant breeding, where there is interest in the individual parentage. In genetics, attention is focused on the numbers of chromosomes. In taxonomy, <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>question</b> is how closely related the parent species are.|$|E

25|$|Human {{missions}} to Mars will include several transitions between different gravitational environments.

Determination of the dual-adaptive capabilities of reflex eye movements in such circumstances is vitally important {{so that it can}} be determined to what extent the Sensory-motor coupling skills acquired in one-g environment will transfer to others.|$|E
25|$|Ethologists and sociobiologists have {{characteristically}} analysed animal {{communication in}} terms of more or less automatic responses to stimuli, without raising {{the question of whether}} the animals concerned understand the meaning of the signals they emit and receive. That is <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>question</b> in animal cognition. There are some signalling systems that seem to demand a more advanced understanding. A much discussed example is the use of alarm calls by vervet monkeys. Robert Seyfarth and Dorothy Cheney showed that these animals emit different alarm calls in the presence of different predators (leopards, eagles, and snakes), and the monkeys that hear the calls respond appropriately—but that this ability develops over time, and also takes into account the experience of the individual emitting the call. Metacommunication, discussed above, also seems to require a more sophisticated cognitive process.|$|E

500|$|Since then <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>question</b> {{has been}} whether Linnaeus's {{original}} type was a South African plant (now Amaryllis) or a South American plant (now Hippeastrum). If the latter, the correct {{name for the}} genus Hippeastrum would then be Amaryllis and a new name {{would need to be}} found for the South African genus. In 1938 JCT Uphof claimed, with some evidence, that the plant was in fact the South American Hippeastrum equestre (Linn. fil.) Herb. (syn. Amaryllis equestris (Linn. fil.) ex Aiton, accepted name H. puniceum) a plant which Carl Linnaeus' son, Linnaeus the Younger (Linn. fil.) had described c. 1781-3 (unpublished) but soon after appearing in the Hortus Kewensis of 1789. [...] This paper sparked a debate over the next half century, that delayed the official transfer of species from Amaryllis to Hippeastrum. This debate involved botanists {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic and the final outcome was a decision by the 14th International Botanical Congress in 1987 that Amaryllis L. should be a nomen conservandum (conserved name, i.e. correct regardless of priority) and ultimately based on a specimen of the South African Amaryllis belladonna from the Clifford Herbarium. Thus Amaryllis L. is the correct name for the South African genus, not the South American genus (Hippeastrum).|$|E

[...] "When the government {{was asked by the}} court what the words 'substantially supported' mean, it was unable to provide a definition; the same was true for 'directly supported,'" [...] she wrote in her order, which makes the preliminary injunction permanent. [...] "There can be no doubt, then, these terms are vague." [...] That vagueness does not put citizens on notice, in violation of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, she ruled. <b>A</b> <b>key</b> <b>question</b> throughout these proceedings has been..precisely what the statute means—what and whose activities it is meant to cover. That is no small question bandied about amongst lawyers and a judge steeped in arcane questions of constitutional law; {{it is a question of}} defining an individual's core liberties. The due process rights {{guaranteed by the}} Fifth Amendment require that an individual understand what conduct might subject him or her to criminal or civil penalties. Here, the stakes get no higher: indefinite military detention—potential detention during a war on terrorism that is not expected to end in the foreseeable future, if ever. The Constitution requires specificity—and that specificity is absent from Section 1021(b)(2). Understanding the scope of Section 1021(b)(2) requires defining key terms.|$|E

40|$|The {{fundamental}} bootstrap {{assumption is}} that the bootstrap approximates reality; that the sampling distribution of a statistic under the empirical distribution ˆ F approximates the sampling distribution under the true (unknown) distribution. A natural way to test this is to investigate how the bootstrap distribution varies when ˆ F is replaced by other distributions. Iterated bootstrapping, jackknife-after-bootstrap (JAB), and bootstrap tilting diagnostics all do this, but tilting lets one focus on <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>questions</b> – how the sampling distribution depends on a parameter of interest – without {{the noise of the}} other procedures. Both tilting and iterated bootstrapping may be used for calibration, and in some cases giving confidence intervals or hypothesis tests that are an order of magnitude more accurate than the uncalibrated versions. But whereas iterated bootstrapping is computationally much more expensive than ordinary bootstrapping, bootstrap tilting is less expensive– 17 to 37 timeslessexpensivethancommon bootstrap confidence intervals. Key words: bootstrap tilting, calibration. Acknowledgements This work was partially supported by grants NIH 2 R 44 CA 67734 – 02 an...|$|R
