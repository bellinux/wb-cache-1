25|$|Other {{scientists}} have argued against Edelman's theory, instead suggesting that primary consciousness might have emerged {{with the basic}} vegetative systems of the brain. That is, the evolutionary origin might have come from sensations and primal emotions arising from sensors and receptors, both internal and surface, signaling that {{the well-being of the}} creature was immediately threatened—for example, hunger for air, thirst, hunger, pain, and extreme temperature change. This is based on neurological data showing the thalamic, hippocampal, orbitofrontal, insula, and midbrain sites <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> consciousness of thirst. These scientists also point out that the cortex might not be as important to primary consciousness as some neuro{{scientists have}} believed. Evidence of this {{lies in the fact that}} studies show that systematically disabling parts of the cortex in animals does not remove consciousness. Another study found that children born without a cortex are conscious. Instead of cortical mechanisms, these scientists emphasize brainstem mechanisms as essential to consciousness. Still, these scientists concede that higher order consciousness does involve the cortex and complex communication between different areas of the brain.|$|E

25|$|On {{the mythical}} island of Okoto, the Mask Maker {{brothers}} - Ekimu and Makuta - forged masks of elemental {{power for the}} island's villagers. However, jealous of his brother's higher-rated craftsmanship, Makuta broke an ancient vow by forging a mask {{with more than one}} element; the Mask of Ultimate Power. Putting it on, the mask took control over him and began to destroy the island, forcing Ekimu to confront him. Knocking the mask off Makuta's face, a shock wave from the battle rolled across Okoto and sent both brothers into an endless sleep, while their masks - the Mask of Creation and the Mask of Control, as well as the Mask of Ultimate Power - were scattered across the island. After the leaders of the villages, the Protectors, buried Ekimu, Okoto was overran with Skull Spiders searching for the powerful masks. On the brink of giving up hope, the Protectors send a prayer they heard from whispers from Ekimu's lifeless body to the skies during a celestial alignment, resulting in six powerful heroes, the Toa, to crash-land on the island. Each masters of a sacred element, the Toa - Tahu, Kopaka, Pohatu, Gali, Onua and Lewa - are quickly enlisted by the Protectors in their battle against the Skull Spiders as well as embarking on a quest to find their golden Masks of Power that <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> unlocking their full elemental abilities. Once claimed, the Toa meet for the first time outside the ancient city of the Mask Makers. Defeating the Lord of Skull Spiders upon arrival, they venture inside in search of the resting place of Ekimu. Battling an army of skeleton warriors under the control of Makuta's surviving spirit, the Toa overcome their ranks before finding Ekimu's tomb and awakening him. However, the leader of the skeleton warriors, the Skull Grinder, has obtained Ekimu's Mask of Creation. Donning it, he defeats the Toa with ease and damages their masks, but their efforts give Ekimu the time to recreate his Hammer of Power and defeat the Skull Grinder by knocking the mask off his face. Donning his sacred mask once again, Ekimu recreates the Toa's golden masks, while they all agree that Makuta is still out there; readying for his next attack.|$|E

500|$|Possessing a {{mezzo-soprano}} vocal range, Madonna {{has always}} been self-conscious about her voice, especially in comparison to her vocal idols such as Ella Fitzgerald, Prince, and Chaka Khan. Mark Bego, author of Madonna: Blonde Ambition, called her [...] "the perfect vocalist for lighter-than-air songs", despite not being a [...] "heavyweight talent." [...] According to MSNBC critic Tony Sclafani, [...] "Madonna's vocals <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> her rock roots.

[...] Madonna used a bright, girlish vocal timbre in her early albums which became passé in her later works. The change was deliberate since she was constantly reminded of how the critics had once labelled her as [...] "Minnie Mouse on helium". During the filming of Evita, Madonna had to take vocal lessons, which increased her range further. Of this experience she commented, [...] "I studied with a vocal coach for Evita and I realized there was a whole piece of my voice I wasn't using.

500|$|Orban {{told the}} Committee that the {{multilingual}} {{dimension of the}} EU must be made mainstream in all relevant EU policies and programmes {{and should not be}} seen as a separate, isolated policy. He stated that, [...] "Politically, I will steer the Commission's work on bringing an active multilingualism policy into a variety of policies which <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>to</b> the functioning of the EU and the internal market: culture, education and competitiveness." [...] In addition, he claimed that multilingualism would be commercially advantageous as, [...] "At first sight, one single language might appear easier to manage [...] multilingualism can also give any industry a competitive advantage if it helps them to tap local markets and create new products which also cater for multilingualism." [...] According to Orban, multilingualism promotes labour mobility, tolerance and a sense of European citizenship and, as an integral aspect of the legitimacy, transparency and democracy of the European integration, it contributes to a successful EU communication policy. Within the Lisbon strategy, the target for foreign language learning is “mother tongue plus two,” which means that English language skills on their own are not sufficient. To address this, Orban aims to improve language teaching and to make the media and new communication technologies more language-friendly. He underlined that, [...] "our efforts to support multilingualism are not limited to EU languages; we are also encouraging training in Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Turkish and Russian." [...] He added that, [...] "The promotion of language learning and linguistic diversity is a general objective of the new programme for lifelong learning launched in 2007. For the first time, it will be open to all languages spoken in the European Union {{as well as to the}} languages of the EU's main trading partners." [...] Orban claims that respect for linguistic diversity and the fight against discrimination on the basis of language are cornerstones for a social Europe; he states that, [...] "Europe's linguistic and cultural diversity is a source of richness which also needs to be nurtured and promoted," [...] which presumably includes all languages, national, regional, minority and migrant. However, Orban agreed that the protection of language rights was a matter for individual member states and his view is that, [...] "When it comes to language rights, I am not in favour of adopting legislation at European level to be imposed on Member States." ...|$|E

Each wing has {{a central}} axis, {{composed}} of three limb bones, the humerus, ulna and radius. The hand, or manus, which ancestrally {{was composed of}} five digits, is reduced to three digits (digit II, III and IV or I, II, III depending on the scheme followed), which serves as an anchor for the , one of two groups of flight feathers responsible for the wing's airfoil shape. The other set of flight feathers, behind the carpal joint on the ulna, are called the [...] The remaining feathers on the wing are known as , {{of which there are}} three sets. The wing sometimes has vestigial claws. In most species these are lost by the time the bird is adult (such as the highly visible ones used for active climbing by hoatzin chicks), but claws are retained into adulthood by the secretarybird, screamers, finfoots, ostriches, several swifts and numerous others, as a local trait, in a few specimens. Most kinds of bird wings can be grouped into four types, with some falling between two of these types: i) elliptical wings—short and rounded, having a low aspect ratio, allowing for tight maneuvering in confined spaces such as might be found in dense vegetation, which are common in forest raptors and many migratory species of passerines, and species that use a rapid take off to evade predators, such as pheasants and partridges; ii) high speed wings—short, pointed wings that when combined with a heavy wing loading and rapid wingbeats provide an energetically expensive high speed, used by the bird with the fastest wing speed, the peregrine falcon, as well as by most of the ducks and the auks who uses the shape for a different purpose, to [...] "fly" [...] underwater; iii) high aspect ratio wings—typified by low wing loading and which are far longer than they are wide, they are used for slower flight which may take the form of almost hovering (as used by kestrels, terns and nightjars) or in soaring and gliding flight, particularly the dynamic soaring used by seabirds, which takes advantage of wind speed variation at different altitudes (wind shear) above ocean waves to provide lift; and iv) soaring wings with deep slots—common in larger species of inland birds, such as eagles, vultures, pelicans, and storks, the slots {{at the end of the}} wings, between the primaries, reduce the induced drag and wingtip vortices, whilst the shorter size of the wings aids in takeoff (high aspect ratio wings require a long taxi to get airborne).|$|E

There was much that was feminine in him; and he is most understandable when surprised in those little solitary poems which speak of emotions mellowed, of sunset and a quiet end. Henley hurled himself into the new fashion of praising Colonial adventure at the expense both of the Christian and the republican traditions; but the sentiment did not spread widely until the note was struck outside England in one of the conquered countries; and a writer of Anglo-Indian short stories showed the stamp of the thing called genius; that indefinable, dangerous and often temporary thing.|$|E

And burdens which men or women accept for themselves without complaint seem all wrong, and are wrong, when laid upon a child's innocent shoulders. Again, Dickens sought to show us our error in thinking, as most grown-ups do, that childish troubles are of small account. So they are, to us; but to the child they are desperately real. Later in life we learn that troubles are not permanent, and so give them their proper place; but in childhood a trouble is the whole world; and a very hopeless world it is while it lasts.
