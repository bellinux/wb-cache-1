40|$|Imagine {{a wooden}} {{plate with a}} set of {{non-overlapping}} geometric objects painted on it. How many of them can a carpenter cut out using <b>a</b> <b>panel</b> <b>saw</b> making guillotine cuts, i. e., only moving forward through the material along a straight line until it is split into two pieces? Already fifteen years ago, Pach and Tardos investigated whether one can always cut out a constant fraction if all objects are axis-parallel rectangles. However, even for the case of axis-parallel squares this question is still open. In this paper, we answer the latter affirmatively. Our result is constructive and holds even in a more general setting where the squares have weights and the goal is to save as much weight as possible. We further show that when solving the more general question for rectangles affirmatively with only axis-parallel cuts, this would yield a combinatorial O(1) -approximation algorithm for the Maximum Independent Set of Rectangles problem, and would thus solve a long-standing open problem. In practical applications, like the mentioned carpentry and many other settings, we can usually place the items freely that we want to cut out, which gives rise to the two-dimensional guillotine knapsack problem: Given a collection of axis-parallel rectangles without presumed coordinates, our goal is to place as many of them as possible i...|$|E
5000|$|<b>A</b> sliding <b>panel</b> <b>saw</b> {{was invented}} by Wilhelm Altendorf in 1906 in Germany. Its {{invention}} set a new standard in woodworking, with dramatic differences from traditional machines. Up to that time, a conventional table saw had no mechanism for edging. Meaning {{that for the first}} and second longitudinal cut on untreated massive wood, the lumber always had to be fed manually through the saw blade. The new system accomplished the task more elegantly by allowing the work piece to be fed through the saw blade while lying on a sliding table. Thus cutting becomes faster, accurate and effortless.|$|R

50|$|<b>Panel</b> <b>saws</b> {{are used}} by cabinet shops to easily cut panels, profiles, solid-wood, plywood, MDF, laminates, plastic sheets and {{melamine}} sheets into sizes or cabinet components. They are also used by sign shops to cut sheets of aluminum, plastic and wood for their sign blanks. Some higher end <b>panel</b> <b>saws</b> feature computer controls that move the blade and fence systems to preset values. Other lower end machines offer simplicity and ease of use, including full scale hobbyist level <b>panel</b> <b>saws</b> at <b>a</b> mere fraction of the cost. While the entry level machines are designed for light duty usage, they offer home DIYers a cheap alternative for infrequent cutting when accuracy and clean cuts are not required.|$|R

40|$|Workers in wood {{industry}} {{are exposed to}} vibration and its damages. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate exposure to hand-arm and whole body vibration in the {{wood industry}}. In this study, the parameters of whole body and hand-arm vibrations such as effective acceleration, overall equivalent acceleration, Vibration Dose Value and crest factor were studied on two Thicknessing planes, two sliding <b>panel</b> <b>saw</b> machines, two orbital sander, and three operators of perforate procedure. Assessments were done by the use of an oscillator and an analyzer of Svantak Co. Evaluating Hand-arm and whole body vibrations were conducted based on ISO 5349 - 1, ISO 5349 - 2 and ISO 2631 - 1 standards, respectively, and the findings/ the evaluated data were analyzed. The mean amount of daily exposure to hand-arm vibration (RMS) in Thicknessing plane, Orbital Sander and Sliding <b>panel</b> <b>saw</b> machine operators are respectively 5. 56, 5. 49 and 3. 37 m/s 2. In addition, the average crest factor of the 3 jobs is higher than 6. Mean of daily Exposure to whole body vibration in 3 machine operators of Thicknessing plane, perforate procedure and Sliding <b>panel</b> <b>saw</b> is respectively, 0. 28, 0. 24 and 0. 17 meters per square second. The crest factor for all the exposures was to be less than 6 and the mean of the calculated daily vibration dose equaled 5. 83 with the standard deviation of 0. 87 (m) ⁄s^ 1. 75. In further measured situations, exposure to hand-arm vibration is more than the standard level, so engineering and management measures are required to reduce the amount of exposure and support the health of the operators and the equipment...|$|R

The document contains {{an excerpt from}} the report of the CGIAR meeting in May 1998, a transmittal letter from the TAC Chairman and CGIAR Executive Secretary, TAC comments, IRRI's response, and a transmittal from the panel chair. The panel found that IRRI was recovering from an upheaval that saw the departure of some senior staff, the director general and the board chair. It approved IRRI's strong emphasis on biotechnology and rice genomics, and increased collaboration with the private sector. Recommendations included the merger of the three rainfed rice programs, and modification of intellectual property rights and biotechnology policies to match changing circumstances. IRRI was urged to focus on soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics, in connection with the observed decline in rice productivity. The panel suggested that the board make more systematic annual assessments of its own performance, and that of the director general. It also urged a review of management methods and performance rewards. The <b>panel</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> need for a capital plan, and ensuring that the internal audit function become fully effective. TAC and the CGIAR generally endorsed the panel recommendations.

40|$|The {{proper use}} of {{protective}} hoods on <b>panel</b> <b>saws</b> should reliably prevent severe injuries from (hand) contact with the blade or material kickbacks. It also should minimize long-term lung damages from fine-particle pollution. To achieve both purposes the hood must be adjusted properly by the operator for each workpiece to fit its height. After a work process is finished, the hood must be lowered down completely to the bench. Unfortunately, in practice the protective hood is fixed at a high position {{for most of the}} work time and herein loses its safety features. A system for an automatic height adjustment of the hood would increase comfort and safety. If the system can distinguish between workpieces and skin reliably, it furthermore will reduce occupational hazards for <b>panel</b> <b>saw</b> users. <b>A</b> functional demonstrator of such a system has been designed and implemented to show the feasibility of this approach. A specific optical sensor system is used to observe a point on the extended cut axis in front of the blade. The sensor determines the surface material reliably and measures the distance to the workpiece surface simultaneously. If the distance changes because of a workpiece fed to the machine, the control unit will set the motor-adjusted hood to the correct height. If the sensor detects skin, the hood will not be moved. In addition a camera observes the area under the hood. If there are no workpieces or offcuts left under the hood, it will be lowered back to the default position...|$|R
