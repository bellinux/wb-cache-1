Results: Research of the observed swimmers with unilateral above-knee amputation showed that: when swimming the front crawl, the swimmers unequally balance the intense kick of right and left leg mainly using the abdominal muscles and subsequently also in the electric potential of different sizes in other observed muscles; when swimming the backstroke, the upper body muscles {{on the side of}} amputated limb do not show <b>any</b> <b>different</b> activity <b>than</b> the muscles of the opposite side; when swimming the breaststroke, the main propulsion muscle for locomotion through the shoulder girdle - m. latissimus dorsi is activated {{for a longer period of}} time on the side of amputated limb; thereby, electrical activity of the selected muscles is not symmetrical in the timeline.

Five royal cities (Prešov, Bardejov, Sabinov, Levoča a Kežmarok) were affected by re-catholicization after 1670. The first re-catholicization interventions relating especially the confiscation of evanjelical temples were broken by the Kurutz uprising in summer and autumn 1672. After their pushing up, the Monarch and his offices could start the massive re-catholicization. During this “tragic decade“ of Hungarian Protestantism, evanjelical temples, schools and the whole property were confiscated, clergymen were expelled and evanjelical townsmen were excluded from self-goverment and political life. The next stage of re-catholicization of the Upper-Hungarian free royal cities followed the defeat of Imrich Thököly uprising (1686). The last breakdown of the re-catholicization process was caused by the František II. Rákóczi uprising and the religious freedom was installed. After its defeat, the Protestants had to leave into suburbs of the towns up to the period of the Patent of Tolerance issue in 1781...|$|R

40|$|Mixing in neighbourhoods is a {{goal that}} has been stated by {{national}} government for many years. One {{of the ways to}} reach the desired mix is by selling homes owned by social landlords or housing associations. Since the new millennium “for dwell” (also known as Clients’ Choice Programme) has gained popularity and a growing market share. However, the results in terms of the established mix and in terms of related and desired effects, are subject of discussion. This paper gives an overview of the desired goals of the sale of social rental housing in the Netherlands. The desired mix and the related effects are pulled to the foreground. Based on both literature study as well as drawing up on findings from previous studies into the effects of the sale of social housing, the effects of the sale of social housing will be discussed in the light of “mixing”. The literature used is solely focused on Dutch empirical findings. The previous studies that are used, focused on the effects of sale and the option to buy amongst tenants of social housing. The findings in this paper point at minor possibilities to reach <b>any</b> <b>different</b> mix <b>than</b> the existing one through the sale of social housing. Two main factors are used to explain the little effects: time and accessibility. The discussion draws attention to new (EU based) legislation limiting the influx of different tenants in social housing and thereby limiting the possibilities for mixing by sale of social housing even further in the future.
