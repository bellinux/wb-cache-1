The mallets, called balu, are wrapped tightly with strips of rubber <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>and</b> are considered lighter and smaller than those balu used for the agung. The rubber ends of the balu are held between the opposing knobs of the gandingan and the player would use them to strike the knobs to achieve a sound.|$|E
5|$|A delayed or {{deployable}} surface {{marker buoy}} (DSMB) is a soft inflatable tube which {{is attached to}} a reel or spool line <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>end,</b> <b>and</b> is inflated by the diver under water and released to float to the surface, deploying the line as it ascends. This provides information to the surface that the diver is about to ascend, and where he is. This equipment is commonly used by recreational and technical divers, and requires a certain level of skill to operate safely. Once deployed, it can be used for the same purposes as the standard surface marker and reel, and in the same way, but they are mostly used to signal the boat that the diver has started ascent or to indicate a problem in technical diving.|$|E

5|$|In {{the third}} quarter, a team {{turnover}} {{and a series}} of missed shots by Hill, Kean and Crispin allowed Mexico to outscore Australia by one point, leaving the score at 50–27 {{at the end of the}} quarter. The final quarter saw Australia's Del Toso miss a shot <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>end,</b> <b>and</b> Mexico's Floralia Estrada Bernal miss one at the other. Stewart also missed, before a Mexican turnover led to the first score of the quarter, by Stewart. Mexico's Rocio Torres Lopez scored in response. Another shot by Stewart missed, but Carter took an offensive rebound, and scored. Turnovers by Kean and Del Toso allowed Mexico to put four points on the board, but successive fouls sent Kean to the free-throw line to score three points in response.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon III, {{who had a}} great {{admiration for}} all things Roman, visited the Pont du Gard in 1850 and took a close {{interest}} in it. He approved plans by the architect Charles Laisné to repair the bridge in a project which was carried out between 1855–58, with funding provided by the Ministry of State. The work involved substantial renovations that included replacing the eroded stone, infilling some of the piers with concrete to aid stability and improving drainage by separating the bridge from the aqueduct. Stairs were installed <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>and</b> the conduit walls were repaired, allowing visitors to walk along the conduit itself in reasonable safety.|$|E

5|$|Deliveries of 1972 stock enabled 1938 {{stock to}} be withdrawn, and several cars were {{converted}} {{for use as}} ballast motor cars. The task was more complicated than for earlier stock, as 1938 units had compressors mounted on the trailer cars. The motor cars therefore had to be fitted with compressors, and the couplings were changed from Wedgelock to Ward type. The first four were numbered L140 to L143, and the conversion was carried out at Acton Works in 1972. Another six were converted, two in 1975, two in 1976, and the final two in 1977, which were numbered L144 to L149. L151 and L152 were converted in 1978, and were additionally fitted with weed killing equipment. Another four were added in the same year, numbered L153 to L156. Although the ballast motor cars were normally worked in pairs, some engineering trains had a ballast motor car <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>and</b> a battery locomotive at the other. One advantage of the ballast motor cars over battery locomotives was that the interiors {{could be used by}} personnel and for storing small tools, although they were less powerful, and could only work when the traction current was switched on. By 2002, all except the weed killing pair had been withdrawn.|$|E

5|$|Play {{finally began}} after the tea, and the pitch played very slowly {{because of the}} excess moisture. As Australia had no {{intention}} of chasing the runs, England captain Norman Yardley often installed seven men in close catching positions. In the first half-hour, the tourists showed little attacking intent and scored only six runs. Johnson then fell for six to leave Australia at 1/10. Bradman came to the crease and played 11 balls without scoring while Morris scored two streaky fours from Bedser. Yardley used his spinners for an hour, while Morris and Bradman made little effort to score. For 105 minutes, Morris stayed <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>and</b> Bradman at the other; neither looked to rotate the strike by taking singles. The Australian skipper faced only eight balls from Morris's main end, and at one point was so startled when his partner wanted a single that he sent him back. Thereafter, the tourists batted steadily and defensively to ensure a draw. They ended at 1/92 from 61 overs, a run rate of 1.50, with 35 maidens; this was the slowest innings run rate for the series to date. Morris finished unbeaten on 54, his fourth consecutive half-century during the Test series. The match finally ended after a series of periodic rain interruptions.|$|E

5|$|The frogs {{may move}} up to 100m during amplexus before the female lays her eggs. During the laying of the eggs, the pair of frogs remain in amplexus and the male is assumed to {{fertilise}} the eggs with his sperm. Males are also seen to paddle their rear legs during this time, which is speculated to accelerate fertilisation. The egg-laying and fertilisation process takes around five minutes. An average of 5,000 eggs are deposited amongst aquatic vegetation in a gelatinous mass; however, a clump of 11,682 has been recorded. The female moves around while depositing, {{leaving a trail of}} eggs that sometimes entangles upon itself. Initially, the mass floats, but sinks up to 12 hours after laying, or when disturbed. The eggs are distinct from those of other frog species; they are 2–2.5mm wide upon deposition and are bicoloured, black <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>and</b> white at the other. They immediately begin to expand, quickly reaching around 4mm across, before sinking. When first laid, they float with the black pointing up, but after sinking, the orientation becomes disordered. Two to five days later, the tadpoles hatch out, but the process can take only a few hours on occasions. The hatching rate varies between 46 and 77%, and peaks at 22°C. Hatching is less likely in acidic waters, although alkaline conditions do not lead to a lower rate compared to neutral conditions. Given the large number of eggs that hatch per female and given the scarcity of mature frogs, tadpole survival rates are believed to be very low.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Microcantilevers {{are one of}} {{the basic}} micromechanical structures. They are fixed <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>ends</b> <b>and</b> the other <b>ends</b> can move freely like a diving board. Their sizes are in the {{micrometer}} and nanometer ranges. Microcantilevers are called microcantilever sensors when their surfaces are functionalized to detect specific molecules. Since these sensors have offered remarkable possibilities in detection, they have been used in many fields such as clinical diagnosis, drug screening and pathogen detection. In the microcantilever sensors, various detection methods are available such as piezoresistive, optical, capacitive and piezoelectric. Each sensing method holds own advantages and disadvantages. By the advantage of allowing integration of the read-out electronics on the same chip, piezoresistive detection becomes prominent. So piezoresistive detection is chosen in this work and a basic piezoresistive microcantilever biosensor design is introduced. Furthermore, by making geometrical alterations on microcantilever and piezoresistive layer, effects of these variations upon sensitivity, vertical displacement and change in resistance are investigated. Additionally, effects of different shaped holes upon sensor are studied...|$|R
