40|$|The {{objective}} of {{research was to}} know the effect of learning models on mathematics learning achievement viewed from the student learning style. The learning models compared were TAPPS, TAI and classical with scientific approach. This research used the quasi experimental method. The population was the students of junior high school in Surakarta regency on academic year 2014 / 2015. The tecnique of taking sample was stratified cluster random sampling. The {{size of the sample}} was 291 students. The instruments used were examination test and learning styles test. The proposed hypothesis were analyzed using the unbalanced two-way analysis of variance. The conclusions were as follows. 1) TAPPS with scientific <b>approach</b> <b>have</b> better mathematics achievement than TAI and classical with scientific approach, TAI and classical with scientific <b>approach</b> <b>have</b> the same achievement. 2) auditory students have better mathematics achievement than visual and kinesthetic students, visual and kinesthetic students have the same achievement. 3) In TAPPS with scientific <b>approach,</b> auditory students <b>have</b> better achievement than visual students, kinesthetic studentshave the same achievement as visual and auditory students. In TAI with scientific <b>approach,</b> auditory students <b>have</b> better achievement than visual and kinesthetic students, visual and kinesthetic students have the same achievement. In classical with scientific <b>approach,</b> auditory students <b>have</b> the same achievement as visual and kinesthetic students, visual students have better achievement than kinesthetic students. 4) In visual students, TAPPS with scientific <b>approach</b> <b>have</b> the same achievement as TAI and classical with scientific approach, classical with scientific <b>approach</b> <b>have</b> better achievement than TAI with scientific approach. In auditorial students, TAPPS and TAI with scientific <b>approach</b> <b>have</b> the same achievement, TAPPS and TAI with scientific <b>approach</b> <b>have</b> better achievement than classical with scientific approach.

5|$|Conventional {{real estate}} {{development}} and urban planning activities are subject to conflicting interests and positional bargaining. The integrative negotiation approach emphasises mutual gains. The <b>approach</b> <b>has</b> been applied in land use planning and environmental management, but has not {{been used as a}} coordinated approach to {{real estate development}}, city design, and urban planning. Urban design management involves reordering the chain of events in the production of the built environment according to the principles of integrative negotiation. Such negotiation can be used in urban development and planning activities to reach more efficient agreements. This leads to integrative developments and more sustainable ways to produce the built environment.|$|E

5|$|Various {{research}} methods {{are used to}} calculate price elasticities in real life, including analysis of historic sales data, both public and private, and use of present-day surveys of customers' preferences to build up test markets capable of modelling such changes. Alternatively, conjoint analysis (a ranking of users' preferences which can then be statistically analysed) may be used. Approximate estimates of price elasticity can be calculated from the income elasticity of demand, under conditions of preference independence. This <b>approach</b> <b>has</b> been emprirically validated using bundles of goods (e.g. food, healthcare, education, recreation, etc.).|$|E
5|$|In a large PSP (>50%), or in a PSP {{associated}} with breathlessness, some guidelines recommend that reducing the size by aspiration is equally effective as {{the insertion of}} a chest tube. This involves the administration of local anesthetic and inserting a needle connected to a three-way tap; up to 2.5liters of air (in adults) are removed. If there has been significant reduction {{in the size of}} the pneumothorax on subsequent X-ray, the remainder of the treatment can be conservative. This <b>approach</b> <b>has</b> been shown to be effective in over 50% of cases. Compared to tube drainage, first-line aspiration in PSP reduces the number of people requiring hospital admission, without increasing the risk of complications.|$|E

5|$|More recently, an {{alternative}} <b>approach</b> <b>has</b> been applied: rational drug design uses the three-dimensional structure of an enzyme's active site to predict which molecules might be inhibitors.

This new inhibitor is then {{used to try to}} obtain a structure of the enzyme in an inhibitor/enzyme complex to show how the molecule is binding to the active site, allowing changes to be made to the inhibitor to try to optimise binding. This test and improve cycle is then repeated until a sufficiently potent inhibitor is produced. Computer-based methods of predicting the affinity of an inhibitor for an enzyme are also being developed, such as molecular docking and molecular mechanics.|$|E
