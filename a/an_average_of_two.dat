An all-time high rate of 2.27 was reported in 1993 (four homicides). This figure is far {{below the national average}} and ranks amongst the lowest rates for any metropolitan area in Canada.|$|E

5|$|Lions {{spend much}} of their time resting and are {{inactive}} for about 20hours per day. Although lions can be active at any time, their activity generally peaks after dusk with a period of socialising, grooming, and defecating. Intermittent bursts of activity follow through the night hours until dawn, when hunting most often takes place. They spend <b>an</b> <b>average</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> hours a day walking and 50minutes eating.|$|E

5|$|When a male detects a female, it chases {{the female}} and begins courtship. Females are larger and slower than males, and many males will escort and intertwine around a single female. The males then align their bodies {{with the female}} and rhythmically contract; the {{resulting}} mass of snakes can remain nearly motionless for several days. After courtship, the snakes copulate for about <b>an</b> <b>average</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> hours.|$|E
5|$|In August 2012, the 9th Expeditionary Bomb Squadron {{returned}} from a six-month tour in Afghanistan. Its 9 B-1Bs flew 770 sorties, {{the most of any}} B-1B squadron on a single deployment. The squadron spent 9,500 hours airborne, keeping one of its bombers in the air at all times. They accounted for a quarter of all combat aircraft sorties over the country during that time and fulfilled <b>an</b> <b>average</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> to three air support requests per day. On 4 September 2013, a B-1B participated in a maritime evaluation exercise, deploying munitions such as laser-guided 500lb GBU-54 bombs, 500lb and 2,000lb Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM), and Long Range Anti-Ship Missiles (LRASM). The aim was to detect and engage several small craft using existing weapons and tactics developed from conventional warfare against ground targets; the B-1 is seen as a useful asset for maritime duties such as patrolling shipping lanes.|$|E
5|$|Mercy Point {{was placed}} on hiatus after only three episodes were aired, and was {{replaced}} by the reality television seriesAmerica's Greatest Petsand the sitcomReunited. The show suffered from low ratings,with <b>an</b> <b>average</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> million viewers. The final four episodes of the series were broadcast in two 2-hour blocks on Thursday nights in July 1999. It has never been released on DVD or Blu-ray, or made available on online-streaming services. Critical response to Mercy Pointwas mixed; some commentators praised its characterization and use of science-fiction elements, while others found it to be uninteresting and unoriginal. Callaway stated that he had the potential story arcs for the full first season already planned before the show's cancellation.|$|E

5|$|The {{end of the}} Pleistocene ice {{ages and}} the start of the Holocene began to change the area's climate from a cool, wet pluvial one to dryer {{semi-arid}} conditions similar to that of today. With less water to cut, the erosive ability of the Colorado was greatly reduced. Mass wasting processes thus began to become relatively more important than they were before. Steeper cliffs and further widening the Grand Canyon and its tributary canyon system occurred. <b>An</b> <b>average</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> debris flows per year reach the Colorado River from tributary canyons to form or expand rapids. This type of mass wasting is the main way the smaller and steeper side canyons transport sediment but it also {{plays a major role in}} excavating the larger canyons.|$|E
5|$|Details {{of giant}} otter {{reproduction}} and life cycle are scarce, and captive animals have provided {{much of the}} information. Females appear to give birth year round, although in the wild, births may peak during the dry season. The estrous cycle is 21 days, with females receptive to sexual advances between three and 10 days. Study of captive specimens has found only males initiate copulation. At Tierpark Hagenbeck in Germany, long-term pair bonding and individualized mate selection were seen, with copulation most frequently taking place in water. Females have a gestation period of 65 to 70 days, giving birth to one to five pups, with <b>an</b> <b>average</b> <b>of</b> <b>two.</b> Research over five years on a breeding pair at the Cali Zoo in Colombia found the average interval between litters was six to seven months, but as short as 77 days when the previous litter did not survive. Other sources have found greater intervals, with as long as 21 to 33 months suggested for otters in the wild.|$|E
