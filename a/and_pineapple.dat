5|$|In the Andes {{region of}} South America, with civilizations {{including}} the Inca, the major crop was the potato, domesticated approximately 7,000–10,000 years ago. Coca, still a major crop to this day, was domesticated in the Andes, {{as were the}} peanut, tomato, tobacco, <b>and</b> <b>pineapple.</b> Cotton was domesticated in Peru by 3,600 BC. Animals were also domesticated, including llamas, alpacas, and guinea pigs.|$|E
5|$|When Iowan began sailing for American-Hawaiian, {{the company}} shipped cargo from East Coast ports via the Straits of Magellan to West Coast ports and Hawaii, and vice versa. Eastbound {{shipments}} were primarily sugar <b>and</b> <b>pineapple</b> from Hawaii, while westbound cargoes were more general in nature. With {{the opening of}} the Panama Canal on 15 August 1914, American-Hawaiian ships switched to taking that route.|$|E
5|$|In May 1905, {{after two}} years of negotiations, American-Hawaiian signed a {{contract}} with the Tehuantepec National Railway of Mexico, abandoning the Straits of Magellan route in favor of the Tehuantepec Route. Shipments on the Tehuantepec Route would arrive at Mexican ports—Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, for eastbound cargo, and Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, for westbound cargo—and would traverse the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Mexico's narrowest point, on the railroad. Eastbound shipments were primarily sugar <b>and</b> <b>pineapple</b> from Hawaii, while westbound cargoes were more general in nature.|$|E

5|$|The International Chicken Sandwiches {{line was}} {{introduced}} in 1988 and {{is a group of}} three sandwiches with different toppings that are associated with cuisine from various international regions. The Italian Chicken Sandwich is a chicken parmigiana sandwich with marinara sauce and mozzarella, the French Chicken Sandwich is a Chicken Cordon Bleu sandwich with ham and Swiss cheese, and the American Chicken Sandwich has mayonnaise, lettuce, tomato and American cheese. Similar regional inspired sandwiches included the Philly Chicken Sandwich, which was a chicken version of a Philly cheesesteak sandwich made with red and green bell peppers, onions and cheese, and the Hawaiian BK Chicken with mayonnaise, lettuce, bacon, American cheese <b>and</b> <b>pineapple</b> sold in New Zealand.|$|E

5|$|The area {{occupied}} by Kent Ridge Park and the National University of Singapore was {{formerly known as}} Pasir Panjang Ridge, and was originally a lowland evergreen rainforest. The park's natural vegetation now consists of groves of Tembusu, Acacias and Dillenias. When the first settlers arrived in Singapore in the early 19th century, they grew crops such as rubber, pepper, gambier <b>and</b> <b>pineapple</b> on the ridge. During World War II, it {{was used as a}} fortress by the British in the defence of Singapore. Many of these plantations were either abandoned or destroyed during the Japanese Occupation (1942–1945), which allowed such crops to grow wild.|$|E
5|$|Tripura is an agrarian {{state with}} {{more than half of the}} {{population}} dependent on agriculture and allied activities. However, due to hilly terrain and forest cover, only 27 per cent of the land is available for cultivation. Rice, the major crop of the state, is cultivated in 91 per cent of the cropped area. According to the Directorate of Economics & Statistics, Government of Tripura, in 2009–10, potato, sugarcane, mesta, pulses and jute were the other major crops cultivated in the state. Jackfruit <b>and</b> <b>pineapple</b> top the list of horticultural products. Traditionally, most of the indigenous population practised jhum method (a type of slash-and-burn) of cultivation. The number of people dependent on jhum has declined over the years.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine gas, {{also known}} as bertholite, was first used as a weapon in World War I by Germany on April 22, 1915 in the Second Battle of Ypres. As {{described}} by the soldiers, it had the distinctive smell of a mixture of pepper <b>and</b> <b>pineapple.</b> It also tasted metallic and stung {{the back of the}} throat and chest. Chlorine reacts with water in the mucosa of the lungs to form hydrochloric acid, destructive to living tissue and potentially lethal. Human respiratory systems can be protected from chlorine gas by gas masks with activated charcoal or other filters, which makes chlorine gas much less lethal than other chemical weapons. It was pioneered by a German scientist later to be a Nobel laureate, Fritz Haber of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin, in collaboration with the German chemical conglomerate IG Farben, which developed methods for discharging chlorine gas against an entrenched enemy. After its first use, both sides in the conflict used chlorine as a chemical weapon, but it was soon replaced by the more deadly phosgene and mustard gas.|$|E

5|$|The cyclone caused $50million {{in damage}} to the banana crop and $3million to papaws between Ingham to Cairns alone. Agricultural {{impairment}} {{was not limited to}} Babinda; throughout northern Queensland, the storm devastated banana and papaw crops. Avocado farms at Atherton <b>and</b> <b>pineapple</b> farms in Rollingstone and Mutarnee experienced considerable losses; in addition, $35million in sugar cane crops near Innisfail were destroyed, with 60–70percent of the entire year's harvest ruined. Within the vicinity of Tully, the storm ruined 30percent of the crop, causing $10million in losses. In general, the sugar industry, already economically weak, bore the brunt of the system's impact. Overall, Winifred caused $86.4million in agricultural losses; the cyclone ruined 1.5million tones of sugar, costing $40million, 3.7million cases of bananas, costing $34.6million, and 15percent of the maize crop, costing $500,000. Winifred also damaged $4.9million in papaws, and $3.8million in avocados, lychees, custard apples, flowers, and chokos, as well. Effects to dairy and poultry industries were less severe, with losses reported at $2million and $600,000, respectively. Winds uprooted large swaths of forest, with $1million in damage at government-owned forests alone.|$|E

25|$|The {{heterotrophic}} {{processing of}} carbohydrates involves isomerization of triose phosphates and interconversion between fructose-6-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate. These cellular processes promote the exchange between organic H and H2O within the plant tissues leading to around 158‰ of D-enrichment of those exchanged sites. The δD of C3 {{plants such as}} Sugar beet, orange and grape ranges from -132‰ to -117‰, and that of C4 plants such as sugar cane and maize ranges from -91‰ to -75‰. The δD of CAM such as pineapple {{is estimated to be}} around -75‰. Sugar beet and sugar cane contain sucrose, and maize contain glucose. Orange <b>and</b> <b>pineapple</b> are the sources of glucose and fructose.|$|E
