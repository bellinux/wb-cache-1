Melanne Verveer, United States Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues, gave a speech, saying, [...] "Each <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> {{is called to}} act. I hope that tonight each of us will make their own commitment." [...] Additional screenings were held in Los Angeles and Chicago later that month. That October, Not My Life had its international premiere in London. CNN International aired the film in two parts {{a few days later}} as part of the CNN Freedom Project. The Swedish premiere was attended by Crown Princess Victoria. Bilheimer recognized that people combatting human trafficking are in need of resources, so he considered various options with respect to the intellectual property of Not My Life, ultimately deciding to release the film at charge in addition to selling licenses for unlimited private screenings. On November 1, an 83-minute version of the film was released on DVD by Worldwide Documentaries, which also began digitally distributing the film and selling the unlimited licenses. LexisNexis, the governments of Arizona and Minnesota, and the U.S. Fund for UNICEF all purchased licenses. The latter organization planned to use the film as part of an anti-human-trafficking campaign.|$|E
500|$|Alex Hawgood from The New York Times {{wrote that}} at first listen the song came across as another generic dance hit. Hawgood however praised the song for its hidden subtext {{intended}} to be a response to gay suicides. Hawgood compared the song to the likes of Taylor Swift, Pink, Katy Perry and Lady Gaga, all of which [...] "represent a new wave of young (and mostly straight) women who are providing the soundtrack for a generation of gay fans coming to terms with their identity in a time of turbulent and confusing cultural messages." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called the track [...] "infectious" [...] and praised her honesty and sincerity on the track. [...] Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine chose [...] "We R Who We R" [...] as a highlight on Cannibal. The Phoenix Daniel Brockman felt that the song had a [...] "lifting anthemic heft" [...] while Spins Barry Walters said that with the song, [...] "she sends out pride vibes to bullied gays." [...] Rolling Stones Will Hermes called the song [...] "awesome." [...] Steven Hyden from The A.V. Club, in the album review of Cannibal, wrote that her [...] "let’s get fucking fucked-up" [...] attitude on the track was a positive calling her [...] "a complete and utter genius." [...] Hyden reviewed the song alongside fellow editor Genevieve Koski in a separate publication, giving the song a B and a D+, respectively. Hyden reiterated his comments from the album review in his review of the song, but added that the song was sonically similar to her previous singles [...] "Tik Tok" [...] and [...] "Take It Off", adding that on the song she [...] "seems a little more self-aware, imploring each <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> to start 'dancing like we’re dumb.'". On the opposite end up the spectrum, Koski was critical of the song, criticizing her vocals with his consensus being that [...] "I want to give every Kesha song an 'F' on principle, but objectively speaking, I know there are far worse songs out there, so let’s average out a subjective F and an objective C+ to a D+." ...|$|E

2500|$|Regarding the Mau Mau Uprising, {{the records}} {{included}} confirmation of [...] "the {{extent of the}} violence inflicted on suspected Mau Mau rebels" [...] in British detention camps documented in Caroline Elkins' study. Numerous allegations of murder and rape by British military personnel are recorded in the files, including an incident where an African baby was [...] "burnt to death", the [...] "defilement of a young girl", and a soldier in Royal Irish Fusiliers who killed [...] "in cold blood two {{people who had been}} his captives for over 12 hours". Baring himself was aware of the [...] "extreme brutality" [...] of the sometimes-lethal torture meted out—which included [...] "most drastic" [...] beatings, solitary confinement, starvation, castration, whipping, burning, rape, sodomy, and forceful insertion of objects into orifices—but took no action. Baring's inaction was despite the urging of people like Arthur Young, Commissioner of Police for Kenya for less than eight months of 1954 before he resigned in protest, that [...] "the horror of some of the [...] should be investigated without delay". In February 1956, a provincial commissioner in Kenya, [...] "Monkey" [...] Johnson, wrote to Attorney General Reginald Manningham-Buller urging him to block any enquiry into the methods used against Mau Mau: [...] "It would now appear that each <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> from the Governor downwards, may be in danger of removal from public service by a commission of enquiry as a result of enquiries made by the CID." [...] The April 2012 release also included detailed accounts of the policy of seizing livestock from Kenyans suspected of supporting Mau Mau rebels.|$|E
