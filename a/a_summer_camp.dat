5|$|In July 1945, Lawton handed in a {{transfer}} request at Everton {{as he wanted}} a move to a Southern club so as {{to see more of}} his increasingly estranged wife. In November 1945, he was sold to Chelsea for a fee of £14,000. Chelsea continued to play regional wartime fixtures as national league football had not resumed for the 1945–46 season, and Lawton also continued his uncapped appearances for the England national team. In the summer of 1946, following his demobilisation, he coached for the FA in <b>a</b> <b>summer</b> <b>camp</b> in Switzerland. He scored a club record 26 goals in 34 league games in the 1946–47 season. However he struggled to settle at Stamford Bridge and came into conflict with manager Billy Birrell after refusing to go on a pre-season tour of Sweden in 1947, which resulted in him requesting {{a transfer}}. He favoured a move to Arsenal, but this was ruled out by the Chelsea hierarchy. Lawton turned down an approach by Sunderland manager Bill Murray as he held out hope that Chelsea would relent and allow him a move to Arsenal.|$|E
5|$|Richard John Bingham {{was born}} on 18December 1934 at 19Bentinck Street, Marylebone, London, the second child and elder son of George Bingham, 6th Earl of Lucan, an Anglo-Irish peer, and his wife Kaitlin Elizabeth Anne Dawson.

Aged three years, he attended a pre-prep school in Tite Street with his elder sister Jane, but in 1939, with war approaching, the two {{were taken to the}} relative safety of Wales.

5|$|The first area {{affected}} by Diane was North Carolina, which suffered coastal flooding but little {{wind and rain}} damage. After the storm weakened in Virginia, it maintained an area of moisture that resulted in heavy rainfall after interacting with the Blue Ridge Mountains, {{a process known as}} orographic lift. Flooding affected roads and low-lying areas along the Potomac River. The northernmost portion of Delaware also saw freshwater flooding, although to a much lesser extent than adjacent states. Diane produced heavy rainfall in eastern Pennsylvania, causing the worst floods on record there, largely in the Poconos and along the Delaware River. Rushing waters demolished about 150road and rail bridges and breached or destroyed 30dams. The swollen Brodhead Creek virtually submerged <b>a</b> <b>summer</b> <b>camp,</b> killing 37people. Throughout Pennsylvania, the disaster killed 101people and caused an estimated $70million in damage (1955USD). Additional flooding spread through the northwest portion of neighboring New Jersey, forcing hundreds of people to evacuate and destroying several bridges, including one built in 1831. Storm damage was evident but less significant in southeastern New York.|$|E
