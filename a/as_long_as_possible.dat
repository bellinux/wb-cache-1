5|$|Despite his pessimism {{expressed}} to the Dutch {{government and the}} mandate {{he had been given}} to surrender the Army, General Winkelman awaited the outcome of events, avoiding actually capitulating until it was absolutely necessary. In this he was perhaps motivated by a desire to engage the opposing German troops for <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible,</b> to assist the Allied war effort. In the early morning of 14 May, though the situation remained critical, a certain calm was evident in the Dutch Headquarters.|$|E

Model was well aware of Speidel's political leanings, as were his predecessors at Army Group B, Erwin Rommel and Günther von Kluge.

In 1588 the newly elected King Sigismund III Vasa established the new post of court preacher, and Skarga became the first priest to hold it. Skarga became a valued adviser to the King, and Sigismund became so fond of him that when the priest considered retirement, Sigismund rejected this, requesting that he remain at court for <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b>|$|E

5|$|Model was {{the master}} of the type of defense which can be called 'defense limited in time'; in which you defend <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> but then retreat to avoid {{breakthrough}} and destruction. He was always at the critical points and took away battlegroups or even single battalions from less threatened sectors. With these units holes were plugged at other locations or short counterattacks were executed and so opportunities were created for bigger solutions. Thus, a closed front was guaranteed while the mixing and tearing apart of units was viewed as the smaller evil.|$|E

5|$|Devil Daggers is a first-person shooter {{video game}} {{developed}} {{and published by}} indie development team Sorath. Players are tasked with surviving for <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> against swarms of demonic enemies on an arena shrouded in darkness. The player character can fire daggers from their fingers to eliminate foes and move about to avoid contact with them. The player dies upon touching an enemy, and as time passes, more threatening creatures begin to appear. Survival times are recorded on a global leaderboard where replays of playthroughs can be accessed and viewed. The deliberate use of unfiltered textures and effects like polygon jitter and texture warping make its visual style reminiscent of early 3D games released in the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Devil Daggers is {{a shooter}} video game with {{gameplay}} experienced from a first-person perspective. The {{goal of the}} game is to kill demonic enemies and survive for <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b> Devil Daggers opens with the player character standing in a shadowy room; in front of them is a floating dagger illuminated by a spotlight. Upon retrieving the dagger, the player is transported to a flat, floating platform arena cloaked in darkness. In the arena, demonic enemies begin spawning. Initially, a series of tentacled, towering creatures spawn and start releasing swarms of flying skulls that pursue the player. As time progresses, more exotic creatures that pose a greater threat and exhibit different behaviour begin to appear. Each enemy makes a unique and continuous noise, so that the player is able to recognise what type of enemy is approaching them.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the impact}} was {{far greater than}} anyone on the Allied side realised, and the ramifications went far beyond New Guinea. Imperial General Headquarters had {{regarded}} the defeats in the Guadalcanal Campaign and Battle of Buna–Gona as setbacks only, and had continued to plan offensives in the South West Pacific. Now it concluded that the Japanese position was over-extended. A new defensive line was drawn running through Western New Guinea, the Caroline Islands and the Mariana Islands. Henceforth, positions beyond that line would be held as an outpost line. General Imamura was now charged not with winning a decisive victory, but only with holding on <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> so as to delay the Allied advance.|$|E

While in England attending Ross' second wedding, to Emily (Helen Baxendale), Monica sleeps with Chandler. Initially supposed to have been a casual, one-time thing which grew more recurrent, Monica and Chandler eventually develop feelings for each other, but attempt to conceal it from their friends for <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b> After finally revealing their relationship to their friends, who are delighted by the news, Monica proposes to Chandler, and they marry.|$|E

5|$|Shooting in Venice {{took place}} on August 8. For scenes such as Indiana and Brody {{greeting}} Elsa, shots of the boat chase, and Kazim telling Indiana where his father is, Robert Watts gained control of the Grand Canal from 7 am to 1 pm, sealing off tourists for <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b> Cinematographer Douglas Slocombe positioned the camera to ensure no satellite dishes would be visible. San Barnaba di Venezia served as the library's exterior. The next day, filming moved to the ancient city of Petra, Jordan, where Al Khazneh (The Treasury) stood in for the temple housing the Grail. The cast and crew became guests of King Hussein and Queen Noor. The Treasury had previously appeared in Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger. The main cast completed their scenes that week, after 63 days of filming.|$|E
5|$|The gunge game The Leakiest Sink {{continued}} until May 2001 {{and the last}} edition saw host Cawood gunged {{under the guise of}} her character Anne Rim Basin. It was replaced the following week by a new feature Stop The Snot. The rules of the new game involved a celebrity speaking for <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> without saying 'yes' or 'no'. The player then won a prize for every 10 seconds passed. If the celebrity did say 'yes' or 'no', the player would be gunged. In later weeks, the celebrities took the place of the player in the gunge tank. For the last episode, host Suttie found herself in the gunge tank and was subsequently gunged after she said 'yes' two seconds into the game.|$|E
5|$|The other {{possibility}} for Black {{is to keep}} his Bb4 <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible,</b> exchanging it against the white knight only in favourable circumstances. A couple of attempts have been done with this in mind, with subtle variations along the moves a7–a5, b7–b6 and d7–d6. Against the mundane 10...d6 White can continue with 11.Nb3 (see diagram at right) {{to play on the}} queenside against the exposed Bb4, or 11.Nb1 to recycle the knight on the ideal d5-square. Another idea is the immediate 10...a5, to have the d6-square for the bishop, inhibit the b2–b4 push and have the possible a5–a4 pawn advance if the white knight moves to b3. In the game Mikhalevski–Chabanon (Bad Endbach 1995) Black kept the bishop with 11.Nb3 a4 12.a3Bd6 13.Nd4 Bc5 14.Nb5 d6 15.Nc3 Ng6 16.Bg3 f5 and had dynamic play.|$|E
