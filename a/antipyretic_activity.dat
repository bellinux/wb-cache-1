As it is structurally related to aminophenazone it has been associated with severe blood dyscrasias. However, it cannot be transformed into potentially carcinogenic nitrosamines and has therefore been widely used as a replacement drug for aminophenazone. In certain countries, products containing propyphenazone have now been restricted in their indications, whereas in others they are still available, sometimes as over-the-counter preparations.” ...|$|E

In the present investigation, the methanolic extract of the dried ground seeds of Swietenia mahagoni (SMSE) has been evaluated for anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and <b>antipyretic</b> <b>activities.</b> The anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated using acute, sub-chronic, and chronic models of inflammation in rodents. The <b>antipyretic</b> and analgesic <b>activities</b> were evaluated in mice models. Acute toxicity studies revealed that the extract up to a dose of 1. 2 g/kg intraperitoneally was nontoxic. SMSE at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg, i. p. was found to possess anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and <b>antipyretic</b> <b>activities</b> and the effect was comparable with that produced by the standard drug, ibuprofen. The results of the experiment on arachidonic acid-induced paw edema in rat revealed that the extract produces anti-inflammatory activity through dual inhibition of the cyclo-oxygenase and lipo-oxygenase pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism. SMSE also enhanced peritoneal cell exudates along with macrophage significantly. The triterpenoids present in SMSE may be responsible for these activities.

50|$|NSAIDS have <b>antipyretic</b> <b>activity</b> {{and can be}} used {{to treat}} fever. Fever is caused by {{elevated}} levels of prostaglandin E2, which alters the firing rate of neurons within the hypothalamus that control thermoregulation. Antipyretics work by inhibiting the enzyme COX, which causes the general inhibition of prostanoid biosynthesis (PGE2) within the hypothalamus. PGE2 signals to the hypothalamus to increase the body's thermal set point. Ibuprofen has been shown more effective as an antipyretic than paracetamol (acetaminophen).Arachidonic acid is the precursor substrate for cyclooxygenase leading to the production of prostaglandins F, D & E.|$|E
