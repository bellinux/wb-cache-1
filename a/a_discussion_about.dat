5|$|In 2009, the ACLU {{filed an}} amicus brief in Citizens United v. FEC, {{arguing that the}} Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 {{violated}} the First Amendment {{right to free speech}} by curtailing political speech. This stance on the landmark Citizens United case caused considerable disagreement within the organization, resulting in <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>about</b> its future stance during a quarterly board meeting in 2010. On March 27, 2012, the ACLU reaffirmed its stance in support of the Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling, at the same time voicing support for expanded public financing of election campaigns and stating the organization would firmly oppose any future constitutional amendment limiting free speech.|$|E
5|$|On {{his way to}} the gallows, Beauchamp {{asked to}} see Patrick Darby, who was among the {{assembled}} spectators. Beauchamp smiled and offered his hand, but Darby declined the gesture. Beauchamp publicly denied that Darby had any involvement with the murder, but accused Darby of having lied about the 1824 meeting. Darby denied this accusation of perjury and tried to engage Beauchamp in <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>about</b> it, hoping he would retract the charge, but the prisoner ordered the cart driver to continue to the gallows.|$|E
5|$|The end of The Dry Salvages {{starts with}} <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>about</b> how people attempt {{to see the}} future through various superstitious means. Then the narrator tries to {{convince}} the reader that resignation about death is necessary. However, such resignation {{should be viewed as}} pushing the self towards redemption and the eternal life in the next world. By acting properly, one would be able to overcome life and move towards the next world.|$|E

5|$|After Guy and Joanna have sex, Martin arrives to {{tell them}} that Joanna is Guy's mother. She met Guy's father whilst she was an {{exchange}} student in Switzerland. Guy then stabs a syringe full of Botox into Martin's legs as an act of revenge. Martin is taken into an ambulance, and Caroline helps Joanna, but Guy punches Mac in a drunken rage and steals the ambulance. Mac tries to stop him and gets on the ambulance, which drives away. Guy drives the ambulance to Wales, with Mac and the paralysed Martin with him. Whilst Mac tries to phone the police, Guy drives into a field and almost goes over a cliff. The first series ends with Guy, Mac and Martin teetering on the edge – a literal cliffhanger – while ending up in <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>about</b> which of The Three Musketeers they are most like.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to the use of}} visual effects, the closing sequence required ADR due to the sound of rain on the original filming. The visual effects were the director Dan Zeff's idea, and the writers were pleased that they were within budget. They also serve to tie the final shot to the opening shot of the episode, as both feature a raven. Scenes that were cut down in the editing process included the initial meeting between the witchfinders—Warren and Clarke—and Sir Andrew Pike, and a private discussion between Warren and Clarke after {{the first day of the}} trial. The extended versions of the scenes featured an explanation about the Devil being found in everyday objects and <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>about</b> the stages of torture respectively. Shearsmith expressed frustration that these extra scenes could not be included on the DVD release.|$|E
5|$|In the afternoon, PT-41 and PT-32 {{made their}} way to Tagauayan, where they found PT-34. There was <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>about</b> whether to proceed to Mindanao, or wait for Permit. Bulkeley warned that the seas might even be higher. But, since there was no {{assurance}} that the submarine would make it, MacArthur decided to continue, departing in daylight at 18:00 so as to be sure to meet their air transport there. Since PT-32 had no fuel to make Mindanao, its passengers were divided between PT-41 and PT-34. Soon after they had departed, PT-35 belatedly arrived at rendezvous point. Akers found the crew of PT-32 there, and discovered that the other two boats had been and gone. He therefore set out for Cagayan de Oro as well.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the opening}} of Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget, Braathens SAFE applied for a {{concession}} to fly to it along the West Coast, as well as the direct route from Oslo. SAS applied to fly the Oslo-service. The ministry wanted Braathens SAFE to fly the route with a concession granted to SAS, but Braathens SAFE rejected this. Instead, they were granted both the routes on temporary basis. The new airport received three daily flights to Oslo, of which two went via Ålesund, and four services on the West Coast route. At the same time, there was <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>about</b> who was to operate the new STOL-airports on the West Coast. Braathens SAFE stated that they wanted a local airline to do the flying, and chose not to apply. The concession was granted to Widerøe, and Braathens SAFE subsequently bought part of the airline.|$|E
5|$|On 3 November 2006, Litvinenko (under {{the name}} of Edwin Carter) was {{admitted}} for further investigation at Barnet General Hospital, London. After being moved from his local hospital in north London to University College Hospital in central London for intensive care, his blood and urine samples {{were sent to the}} UK's Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) for testing. Scientists at AWE tested for radioactive poison using gamma spectroscopy. No gamma rays were detected; however, a small spike was noticed at an energy of 803 kilo-electron volts (keV). The BBC reported that by coincidence another scientist, who had worked on Britain's early atomic bomb programme decades before, happened to overhear <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>about</b> the small spike and recognised it as the gamma ray signal from polonium-210, which was a critical component of early nuclear bombs. On the evening of 22 November, shortly before his death, his doctors were informed the poison was likely to be polonium-210. Further tests on a larger urine sample using spectroscopy designed to detect alpha radiation confirmed the result the following day.|$|E
