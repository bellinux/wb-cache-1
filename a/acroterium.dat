5000|$|An acroterion or <b>acroterium</b> or akroteria is an {{architectural}} ornament {{placed on a}} flat base called the acroter or plinth, and mounted {{at the apex of}} the pediment of a building in the classical style. It may also be placed at the outer angles of the pediment; such acroteria are referred to as acroteria angularia ( [...] means ‘at the corners’).|$|E
50|$|In the Museo Archeologico Nazionale of Crotone {{there is}} a section housing the {{findings}} from the sanctuary of Apollo Aleus at Cirò Punto Alice: some Doric capitals of the temple, an antefix with a disc portraying a Gorgon from the <b>acroterium,</b> votive tablets, a matrix of an antefix, and fragments of an archaic statuette of a young man in limestone. There is no lack of captions illustrating the site and photos of the famous acrolith.|$|E
50|$|In 1993, {{the roof}} was ornamented with seven large, painted {{aluminum}} acroteria designed by Kent Bloomer with owl figures by Raymond Kaskey. The <b>acroterium</b> on the State Street side depicts an owl, a symbol of knowledge due to its association with the Greek goddess Athena. The acroteria on the Congress Parkway and on the Van Buren sides contain seed pods, which represent the natural bounty of the Midwest. The acroteria angularia each contain an owl perched in foliage.|$|E
50|$|The church {{falls under}} the Baroque architecture. It is made of lime, bricks, and stone. Across the three story facade is four pairs of columns and lantern-like finials with two <b>acroterium</b> on top of angular piers on the column's end. Its {{pediment}} ends {{up in a small}} scroll. A separate bell tower is found adjacent to the church. On the ceiling of the main altar is the murals of the Four Evangelists. On {{the right side of the}} main altar is the altar for the Our Lady of Namacpacan and on the left side is the altar for Saint Nicholas of Tolentino.|$|E
50|$|The arch has {{a single}} opening, and uses the Corinthian order. Much of the {{intended}} exterior ornamentation was omitted as a cost-saving exercise necessitated by the King's overspending on the refurbishment of Buckingham Palace, which was underway at the same time. A contemporary account, written in anticipation of its completion to its original plan, describes what was intended. The entabulature is loft and elegant with a richly sculptured frieze, and a row of boldly projecting lions' heads on the cymatium, marking the centres of columns and other sub-divisions of the order. Above the entablature, on a lofty blocking course, is raised an attic, the body of which is embellished with a sculptural representation of an ancient triumph. On each of the columns is a statue of a warrior, and on {{the summit of the}} <b>acroterium</b> which surmounts the attic is a figure in a quadriga or ancient four horse chariot.|$|E
5000|$|The World Food Prize Hall of Laureates honours {{the dreams}} of Norman Borlaug, {{recipient}} of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 {{and founder of the}} World Food Prize, and those of John Ruan, a Des Moines businessman. John Ruan had envisioned Des Moines as the [...] "food capital of the world", and advocated for a World Trade Center to be built in the city in the 1980s. Such a center was never built, but Ruan's endowment of the World Food Prize in 1990 set in motion a goal to secure a home for such an organization. John Ruan III began the fundraising efforts with a donation of $5 million from his family in 2001. Ten years and $30 million later, the renovation was finished in time for the 25th anniversary of the World Food Prize. The original staircase to the east entrance had been removed in 1955 but was restored during the renovation. Also restored was the <b>acroterium</b> which had been destroyed in the mid-1930s.|$|E

It was built in 1937 in the Stripped Classical architectural style and designed by Daniell and Beutell. This replaced an 1884 building that was destroyed by a tornado in 1936. It is on the National Register of Historic Places (NRIS # 95000717). The current courthouse was built in 2002. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|The {{motif of}} Icarus is richly {{represented}} in small objects, such as gems and cameos, {{as well as}} in wall paintings, but appears only rarely in stone sculpture. As pointed out by Arnold Schober, it has achieved its greatest popularity in Noricum and especially in Pannonia: outside these provinces, a larger number is represented only in Regio X Venetia et Histria. Icarus is accompanied by Daedalus or one of the Parcae, who is attaching wings to his arms. The majority of the statuettes shows Icarus standing, naked or draped only in a chlamys, with large wings attached to his shoulders. Since the Roman Empire has so few representations of the young hero just before or during the fight, Schober has labelled this motif as a special feature of Norico-Pannonian sepulchral monuments. Most of the statuettes were found in the territory of a Roman necropolis, and they apparently belonged to the decoration of the sepulchral monuments. They usually served as the acroteria of the tympanums of the aedicule tomb, which is confirmed by their more or less rudimentary workmanship and in some cases by a pair of holes in the plinth. Icarus {{was also one of the}} rare mythological motifs depicted on the sepulchral monuments of the eastern part of Gallia Cisalpina, where it doubtlessly decorated the <b>acroterium.</b> Statues were found in the necropolises of Aquileia and Altinum. All date to the Julio-Claudian era and resemble those from Noricum and Pannonia. The theme probably came to the Danubian provinces with a time delay through well-established merchant connections. The high-quality fragment from Flavia Solva shows sitting on Icarus’ left side a naked woman, usually interpreted as one of the Parcae, who is securing his wings. In this position she replaces Daedalus, who is sculpted beside Icarus especially from the 5 th  century BC onward. She might be an allusion to Icarus’ premature death. An almost identical composition is found in a wall painting from Echzell (Germania Superior), where the Parca is replaced with Daedalus, and on a sarcophagus from Asia Minor depicting Icarus’ life. Based on the narrative cycle of Icarus’ life on that sarcophagus, Salvatore Calderone has pointed out a Neoplatonic explanation of the myth: that the fight and fall could symbolise the soul which goes into the sky, from where it falls to Earth again. As Icarus in the Danubian provinces is never shown falling but rather flying or about to take wing (the only exception being the relief from Carnuntum), the image may express a Neoplatonic thesis and the apotheosis of the deceased. The provinces display at least three elementary types: Icarus standing alone with outstretched winged arms – this type probably derives from Aquileia; Icarus in relief, together with the Parca or Daedalus; and the bust of Icarus in the tympanum of the stele or <b>acroterium.</b> The fragment in Joanneum has most probably arrived from one of the Attic sarcophagi, where the Parca often appears by the side of the protagonists who die prematurely...|$|E
