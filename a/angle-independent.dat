5000|$|In {{the fields}} of {{cardiology}} and medical imaging, Speckle Tracking Echocardiography (STE) is an echocardiographic imaging technique that analyzes the motion of tissues in the heart by using the naturally occurring speckle pattern in the myocardium or blood when imaged by ultrasonic. This novel method of documentation of myocardial motion represents a noninvasive method of definition of vectors and velocity. When compared to other technologies seeking noninvasive definition of ischemia, speckle tracking seems a valuable endeavor. This speckle pattern {{is a mixture of}} interference patterns and natural acoustic reflections. These reflections are also described as ‘‘speckles’’ or ‘‘markers’’. The pattern being random, each region of the myocardium has a unique speckle pattern (also called ‘‘patterns’’, ‘‘features’’, or ‘‘fingerprints’’) that allows the region to be traced from one frame to the next, and this speckle pattern is relatively stable, at least from one frame to the next. In post processing this can be tracked consecutively frame to frame and ultimately resolved into <b>angle-independent</b> two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional strain-based sequences (3D) [...] These sequences provide both quantitative and qualitative information regarding tissue deformation and motion.|$|E

In ME, in-plane, 2 D (lateral and axial) incremental displacements were iteratively estimated using one-dimensional (1 D) cross-correlation and recorrelation techniques in a 2 D search with a 1 D matching kernel. In tMRI, cardiac motion was estimated by a template-matching algorithm on a 2 D grid-shaped mesh. In both ME and tMRI, cumulative 2 D displacements were obtained and then used to estimate 2 D Lagrangian finite systolic strains, from which polar (i. e., radial and circumferential) strains, namely <b>angle-independent</b> measures, were further obtained through coordinate transformation.

Specifically, the purpose was to determine the reproducibility of velocity measurements obtained with EF and to compare these measurements with the velocity measurements obtained with duplex ultrasound scan. Methods: Velocity measurements of the common, internal, and external carotid arteries were performed by the operative surgeon with EF in 65 consecutive patients after carotid endarterectomy (36 female, 29 male; mean age, 71 years). Three velocity measurements were obtained from each of the arteries with EF and compared with the velocity measurements obtained with duplex ultrasound scan performed by a radiologist. Results: Velocity measurements obtained with the EF device were reproducible in the common, internal, and external carotid arteries (intrapatient correlation coefficients, 0. 95, 0. 96, and 0. 95, respectively). Seventy-five percent of common, 88 % of internal, and 78 % of external carotid velocity measurements obtained with the <b>angle-independent</b> ultrasound scan device were within 25 cm/s of the velocities measured with duplex ultrasound scan. The mean differences in velocity measurements between EF and duplex scan were − 12 cm/s in the common, − 8 cm/s in the internal, and − 11 cm/s in the external carotid arteries. Differences between the EF device and duplex scan velocity measurements correlated with increasing arterial velocities in each of the three arteries measured (P <. 05). Conclusion: Reproducible measurements of carotid artery velocity may be obtained with a new <b>angle-independent</b> Doppler system after endarterectomy. Most measurements obtained with the EF system are clinically comparable with those obtained with standard duplex ultrasound scan.

40|$|Abstract. Starting {{from the}} Feshbach S-matrix pole {{expansion}} we modify the standard statistical model for compound reactions by introducing correlations between fluctuating S-matrix elements with different J (total spin) and π (parity) values. The S-matrix (J, π) -correlations are obtained {{at the expense}} of introducing infinitesimally small entrance-exit channel off-diagonal (J, π) -correlations between the random variables of the statistical model. Although later on these correlations are switched off by means of a properly applied limiting procedure, the S-matrix (J, π) -correlations do not vanish and can be strong. The physical origin of the S-matrix (J, π) -correlations resembles the effect of spontaneous symmetry breaking while S-matrix (J, π) -decoherence is due to quantum chaos.

BackgroundTissue Doppler imaging allows non-invasive measurement of myocardial strain in the left ventricle (LV), but is limited by angle dependency. MethodsStrain measurements with STE were obtained by a custom-made program that allowed tracking of two-dimensional motion of speckle patterns in a B-mode image. In anesthetized dogs, we compared LV long- and short-axis measurements by STE to sonomicrometry during preload changes and regional myocardial ischemia. Measurements in the two orthogonal axes were obtained simultaneously in a single imaging plane. In human subjects, long-axis strain by STE and MRI tagging were compared in multiple segments of the LV. ResultsIn the experimental study there was good correlation and agreement between STE and sonomicrometry for systolic strain in the long axis (r = 0. 90, p < 0. 001; 95 % limits of agreement − 4. 4 % to 5. 0 %) and systolic shortening in the short axis (r = 0. 79, p < 0. 001; − 5. 6 % to 5. 1 %).

40|$|Several {{methods have}} been {{introduced}} {{in the past few}} years to quantify left-ventricular strain in order to detect myocardial ischemia and infarction. Myocardial Elastography is one of these methods, which is based on ultrasound Radio-Frequency (RF) signal processing at high frame rates for the highest precision and resolution of strain estimation. Myocardial elastography estimates displacement and strain during the natural contraction of the myocardium using cross-correlation techniques. We have previously shown that imaging of the myocardial strain at high precision allows the correct assessment of the contractility of the cardiac muscle and thus measurement of the extent of ischemia or infarct. In this paper, for the first time in echocardiography, we show how <b>angle-independent</b> techniques can be used to estimate and image the mechanics of normal and pathological myocardia, both in simulations and in vivo. First, the fundamental limits of 2 D normal and principal strain component estimation are determined using an ultrasound image formation model and a 2 D short-axis view of a 3 D left-ventricular, finite-element model, in normal and ischemic configurations. Two-dimensional (i. e., lateral and axial) cumulative displacement and strain components were iteratively estimated and imaged using ID cross-correlation and recorrelation techniques in a 2 D search. Validation of these elastographic findings in one normal human subject was performed. Principal strains were also imaged for the characterization of normal myocardium. In conclusion, the feasibility of <b>angle-independent,</b> 2 D myocardial elastography technique was shown through the calculation of the in-plane principal strains, which was proven essential in the reliable depiction of strains independent of the beam-tissue angle or the type of sonographic view used. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

ME has previously been evaluated in a theoretical framework and a clinical setting. In this study, ME was validated in canine hearts (n= 5) in vivo against direct measurements of sonomicrometry (SM), regarding its capability of depicting the onset, extent and progression of myocardial ischemia caused by graded reductions in blood flow of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery, from 0 % (baseline blood flow) to 100 % (zero blood flow) at 20 % increments. ME estimates and maps: 1) 2 D transmural displacements using RF cross-correlation and recorrelation; and 2) 2 D polar (radial and circumferential) transmural strains at high accuracy. A Sonix RP system was used to acquire RF frames in a full, standard short-axis view at the frame rate of 211 fps, higher than in standard ultrasound imaging, using an automated composite technique developed by our group. Not only were abnormal myocardial regions detected and localized on the ME strain images, but the ME strains were also in good agreement (0. 22 % strain bias, 95 % limits of agreement) with SM using the Bland-Altman analysis.
