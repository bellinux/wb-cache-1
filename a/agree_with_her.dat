5|$|The {{second story}} focuses on Shiva marrying Dhatchayini against {{the will of}} her father Dhatchan. Dhatchan {{performs}} a Mahayajna without inviting his son-in-law. Dhatchayini asks Shiva's permission {{to go to the}} ceremony, but Shiva refuses to let her go as he feels no good will come from it. Dhatchayini disobeys him and goes only to be insulted by Dhatchan. Dhatchayini curses her father and returns to Shiva who is angry with her. Dhatchayini asserts that they are one and without her, there is no Shiva. He refuses to <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> and burns her to ashes. He then performs his Tandava, which is noticed by the Devas, who pacify him. Shiva then restores Dhatchayini to life and accepts that they are one.|$|E

25|$|Anthony's {{commitment}} to the movement, her spartan lifestyle, {{and the fact that}} she did not seek personal financial gain, made her an effective fund-raiser and won her the admiration of many who did not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> goals. As her reputation grew, her working and travel conditions improved. She sometimes had the use of the private railroad car of Jane Stanford, a sympathizer whose husband owned a major railroad. While lobbying and preparing for the annual suffrage conventions in Washington, she was provided with a free suite of rooms in the Riggs Hotel, whose owners supported her work.|$|E
25|$|Fisher {{made her}} film debut at age 18 as the precociously seductive {{character}} Lorna Karpf in the Columbia Pictures comedy Shampoo (1975). Lee Grant and Jack Warden {{play the role}} of her parents in the film. Warren Beatty, Julie Christie and Goldie Hawn also star in the film. In 1977, Fisher starred as Princess Leia in George Lucas' science-fiction film Star Wars (later retitled Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope) opposite Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford. At the time, she believed the script for Star Wars was fantastic, but did not expect many people to <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>her.</b> Though her fellow actors were not close at the time, they bonded after the commercial success of the film.|$|E

25|$|A {{few weeks}} later, Tebbit gave an {{interview}} to John Mortimer for The Spectator where he said of Thatcher: It's a question of her leadership when our aims aren't clearly defined. When people understand what she's doing there's {{a good deal of}} admiration for her energy and resolution and persistence, even from those people who don't <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>her.</b> Now there's a perception that we don't know where we're going so those same qualities don't seem so attractive. Thatcher disagreed and her biographer claims she was suspicious of Tebbit's motives. Furthermore, Thatcher commissioned the firm Young and Rubicam to carry out their own polling, which concluded that Thatcher's leadership was not the problem. Throughout the rest of 1986 and into the 1987 election, Thatcher continued to use Young and Rubicam, which eventually caused tensions with Tebbit during the election campaign.|$|E
25|$|In February 2008, during Sebelius's {{second term}} in office, {{there was a}} report in the Wichita Eagle that the State of Kansas was {{suspending}} tax refunds and that, {{because of a lack of}} tax revenue, may not have been able to meet payroll for state employees. Sebelius called for issuing certificates of indebtedness, moving funds from various state agency accounts into the general fund to alleviate the crisis. However, Republican leaders in the legislature did not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> certificate of indebtedness plan, saying the state would be unable to repay the certificates unless Sebelius issued allotments or signed a budget rescission bill that had been passed by the legislature but had not yet been delivered to her desk. The standoff ended when the budget arrived, and Sebelius agreed to sign it, although she line-item vetoed several cuts she felt were too large. The rescission bill reduced the budget by about $300 million. $7 million of the cuts came in the form of reduced educational funding.|$|E
25|$|Bedouin girls face {{additional}} {{obstacles to}} their education. Among {{the biggest problems}} {{is the nature of}} the schools. Most Bedouin schools are co-ed, meaning that boys and girls study together. For many families (especially the more traditional ones), this is unacceptable, particularly because of the presence of boys from other tribes. The drop out rate for Bedouin girls is much higher than that of Bedouin boys (85% vs. 71%, respectively). The fact that boys and girls study together is arguably a driving force behind this incredibly high rate. A study conducted by Abu-Rabia-Queder found that the most important factor in whether girls remained in schools was the decision of her father. In other words, if the girl’s father did not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> education, there was little chance of her remaining in school. Generally, men who were themselves educated and/or employed were much more likely to support their daughters' educations. However, of the fathers surveyed by the study, none approved of coeducation. Those who disapproved most strongly were more likely to pull their daughters out of school, even if they recognized the benefits education could bring for their daughters.|$|E

He wanted viewers to reach the point where Leeloo states [...] "What's the use of saving life when you see {{what you do with}} it?", and <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>her.</b> Jay P. Telotte, writing in the book Science Fiction Film, credited the film with exploring the theme of political corruption.|$|E
500|$|When her son {{became a}} member of The Beatles, Mona {{repeatedly}} tried to get the group a lunchtime residency at The Cavern Club by talking to the owner, Ray McFall, but was turned down, as The Cavern had a jazz-only policy at the time. Brian Epstein later wanted to manage the group, and Mona was asked for her advice, and although she had her own plans for the group, she concluded that Epstein would be good for them over time. After The Beatles signed a management contract with Epstein, Mona did not relinquish her control over them, as they had been using her telephone to call agents, and frequently slept over in her living room between concerts. She constantly harassed Epstein about the quality of their bookings, and his management of them, which led to Epstein never referring to her by name, but always calling her [...] "that woman". One musician commented that if Mona said it was a Sunday when it was Tuesday, one would be forced to <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
500|$|The poem is {{traditionally}} ascribed to Faltonia Betitia Proba {{largely on the}} assertion of Isidore, who noted {{that it was the}} product of a woman named Proba who was the wife of a man named Adelphus (Proba, uxor Adelphi, centonem ex Vergilio ... expressit). However, the classicist and medievalist Danuta Shanzer has argued that the poem was written by Anicia Faltonia Proba, a late-fourth- and early-fifth-century noblewoman and the granddaughter of Faltonia Betitia Proba. Shanzer and those who <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> have developed the following arguments to support their claims: They argue that lines 13–17 of De laudibus Christi resemble lines 20–24 of the later poem Carmen contra paganos, reportedly written after Faltonia Betitia Proba's death. They assert that the poem must have been written after 387, because it alludes to a debate about the date of Easter which took place that year. They see Jerome's allusion to the poem as a reference to a living individual (Anicia Proba) and contend that Faltonia Betitia Proba died during the war between Magnentius and Constantius, which occured in AD 351 and is alluded to in the invocation of De laudibus Christi. Finally, they argue that Anicia Proba must have written the poem, since the author is referred to as [...] "mother of the Anicians" [...] in a later manuscript and the [...] "eminent Roman Mistress" [...] in another (titles only Anicia Proba would have received).|$|E

500|$|Although Godwin admired Wollstonecraft's writings, {{he did not}} <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> {{that women}} should receive the same {{education}} as men. Therefore, he occasionally read to Fanny and Mary from Sarah Trimmer's Fabulous Histories (1786) and Anna Laetitia Barbauld's Lessons for Children (1778–79), but, according to Todd, {{he did not take}} great pains with their educations and disregarded the books Wollstonecraft had written for Fanny. [...] William St Clair, in his biography of the Godwins and the Shelleys, argues that Godwin and Wollstonecraft spoke extensively about the education they wanted for their children and that Godwin's writings in The Enquirer reflect these discussions. He contends that after Wollstonecraft's death Godwin wrote to a former pupil to whom she had been close, now Lady Mountcashell, asking her advice on how to raise and educate his daughters. In her biography of Mary Shelley, Miranda Seymour agrees with St Clair, arguing that [...] "everything we know about his daughter's [...] early years suggests that she was being taught in a way of which her mother would have approved", pointing out that she had a governess, a tutor, a French-speaking stepmother, and a father who wrote children's books whose drafts he read to his own first. It was the new Mrs Godwin who was primarily responsible for the education given to the girls, but she taught her own daughter more, including French. Fanny received no formal education after her stepfather's marriage. Yet, the adult Imlay is described by C. Kegan Paul, one of Godwin's earliest biographers, as [...] "well educated, sprightly, clever, a good letter-writer, and an excellent domestic manager". Fanny excelled in drawing and was taught music. Despite Godwin's atheism, all of the children were taken to an Anglican church.|$|E

2500|$|King was {{starting}} to think about being an artist, though this was really a second choice. But art was something she could do with minimal resources, so {{long as she could}} support herself. King was influenced both by mediaeval sculpture and by Expressionist sculpture, an important part of German avant-garde art, and particularly by the work of the wood-carver, Ernst Barlach (1870–1938). The Nazis considered such art to be decadent (Entartete Kunst) and later attempted to suppress it. King went to see the artist Käthe Kollwitz (1867–1945), whose work she admired. Kollwitz’ advice to King about a career in art was “Don’t do it if you can help it. It is so difficult”. Nevertheless, King did go on. She said: “I haven’t regretted it. I <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>her,</b> it’s difficult.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Camille Paglia {{states that}} {{there is nothing in the}} poem that would provide a clue as to whether the poem is {{directed}} towards a man or a woman, but assumes, as many do, that Sonnet 29 was written about the young man. Both Paglia and Frank agree that the first octave is about the Speaker's current depression caused by his social ostracism in his [...] "outcast state" [...] (line 2) and personal misfortune that has [...] "curse my fate" [...] (line 4). The Speaker proclaims his jealousy of those that are [...] "rich in hope" [...] (line 5) and [...] "with friends possess'd" [...] (line 6), once again referring to his hopelessness and low social status. Paglia refers to this section of the poem as a [...] "list of half-imaginary grievances." [...] Frank seems to <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> statement of [...] "half imaginary" [...] since he believes the Speaker wills his own misery.|$|E
2500|$|In 1994, she {{was invited}} to speak at a United Nations conference on AIDS. She was asked {{whether it would be}} {{appropriate}} to promote masturbation as a means of preventing young people from engaging in riskier forms of sexual activity, and she replied, [...] "I think that it is part of human sexuality, and perhaps it should be taught." [...] This remark caused great controversy and resulted in Elders losing the support of the White House. [...] White House chief of staff Leon Panetta remarked, [...] "There have been too many areas where the President does not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> views. This is just one too many." [...] In December 1994, Elders was forced to resign by President Clinton. This historic incident is explored further in a documentary on masturbation called , in which Elders talks about her experience being asked to resign in an on camera interview conducted by writer/director/producer Nicholas Tana and was referenced in a Newsweek article.|$|E
2500|$|After {{growing up}} in Stamford, Connecticut, she {{attended}} Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, for her senior year {{and was a member}} of the school's first co-educational class, which included jazz composer Bill Cunliffe, software executive Peter Currie, artist Julian Hatton, poet Karl Kirchwey, writer Nate Lee, editor Sara Nelson, restaurateur Priscilla Martel and sculptor Gar Waterman. [...] "Andover was the best time of my life," [...] she recalled. She played the lead role of Nellie Forbush in the school's spring musical production of South Pacific opposite Peter Kapetan as Emile. She commented: [...] "It was just a little awkward to be Nellie at first because she hesitates to marry Emile since he had once lived with a Polynesian woman – I don't <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> reasoning so that made things a bit hard at the beginning." [...] She appeared in a student video directed by classmate Jonathan Meath in a film class taught by Steve Marx. She graduated in 1974 with the academic honor of [...] "cum laude" [...] which was awarded to 80 out of 378 graduating seniors. She majored in theater at Wesleyan University, worked in summer stock productions during vacations, and graduated in 1978. Later, in an interview, she reported that she sometimes had eating disorders during this time of her life. She said: [...] "I binged... I starved ...
