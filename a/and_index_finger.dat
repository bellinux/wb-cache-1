5|$|Invalided out {{of service}} in June 1941, Bradman spent months recuperating, unable even to shave himself or comb his hair due {{to the extent of}} the muscular pain he suffered. He resumed {{stockbroking}} during 1942. In his biography of Bradman, Charles Williams expounded the theory that the physical problems were psychosomatic, induced by stress and possibly depression; Bradman read the book's manuscript and did not disagree. Had any cricket been played at this time, he would not have been available. Although he found some relief in 1945 when referred to the Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders, Bradman permanently lost the feeling in the thumb <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> of his (dominant) right hand.|$|E
5|$|The claw {{of a bird}} of prey; {{its primary}} hunting tool. The talons are very important; without them, most birds of prey {{would not be able}} to catch their food. Some birds also use claws for {{defensive}} purposes. Cassowaries use claws on their inner toe (digit II) for defence, and have been known to disembowel people. All birds however have claws, which are used as general holdfasts and protection for the tip of the digits. The hoatzin and turaco are unique among extant birds in having functional claws on the thumb <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> (digit I and II) on the forelimbs as chicks, allowing them to climb trees until the adult plumage with flight feathers develop. However, several birds have a claw- or nail-like structure hidden under the feathers at the end of the hand digits, notably ostriches, emus, ducks, geese and kiwis.|$|E
25|$|The pad-to-pad pinch {{between the}} thumb <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> is made {{possible}} because of the human ability to passively hyperextend the distal phalanx of the index finger. Most non-human primates have to flex their long fingers {{in order for the}} small thumb to reach them.|$|E
50|$|The {{technique}} used {{to tie the}} hair into a Kudumi is as follows: The lengthy hair can be tied {{with the help of}} left thumb <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>fingers.</b> You roll up the lock of hair over the left thumb <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>fingers</b> put together by your right hand till you reach the tail end. Then hold the tail end of hair by the left thumb <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> pull out the fingers with {{the tail end of the}} hair. You get the knot. After some little practice you will get a tight and neat knot.|$|R

25|$|The typical {{method of}} {{muffling}} {{is to place}} the pads of the fingers against the head while holding onto the timpani stick with the thumb <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger.</b> Timpanists are required to develop techniques to stop all vibration without making any sound from the contact of their fingers.|$|E
25|$|The {{thumb is}} not opposable in all primates— some primates, {{such as the}} spider monkey and colobus, are {{virtually}} thumbless. The spider monkey compensates for this by using the hairless part of its long, prehensile tail for grabbing objects. In apes and Old World monkeys, the thumbs can be rotated around its axis, but the extensive area of contact between the pulps of the thumb <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> is a human characteristic.|$|E
25|$|The {{most popular}} four-mallet grip for vibraphone is the Burton grip, named for Gary Burton. One mallet is held between the thumb <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> {{and the other}} is held between the index and middle fingers. The shafts cross {{in the middle of the}} palm and extend past the heel of the hand. For wide intervals, the thumb often moves in between the two mallets and the inside mallet is held in the crook of the fingers.|$|E

50|$|The Polish Armed Forces are {{the only}} {{military}} entity {{in the world to}} use a two-finger salute which is only used while wearing a hat (it refers {{to the fact that the}} salute is given to the emblem itself) with the emblem of the Polish eagle, such as military hat rogatywka. The salute is performed with the middle <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>fingers</b> extended <b>and</b> touching each other, while the ring and little fingers are bent and touched by the thumb. The tips of the middle <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>fingers</b> touch the peak of the cap, two fingers supposedly meaning honour and fatherland (Honor i Ojczyzna).|$|R
25|$|A soft contact lens may {{be removed}} by {{pinching}} the edge between the thumb <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger.</b> Moving the lens off the cornea first can improve comfort during removal and reduce risk of scratching the cornea with a fingernail. It {{is also possible}} to push or pull a soft lens far enough to the side or bottom of the eyeball {{to get it to}} fold then fall out, without pinching and thereby damaging it. If these techniques are used with a rigid lens, it may scratch the cornea.|$|E
25|$|Interval {{changes are}} {{accomplished}} {{by moving the}} inside and outside mallets independently of one another, as described in Stevens' book, Method of Movement for Marimba. As the interval widens, the inside mallet rolls between the thumb <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger,</b> such that the index finger moves from underneath {{to the side of}} the shaft, and the middle finger becomes the fulcrum of the cantilever. The outside mallet is moved principally with the little and ring fingers, although the first section of the middle finger follows along and remains in light contact. When properly used, this grip causes no tension on the hand muscles.|$|E
25|$|Following {{his release}} in 1936 after serving two years, Nikolai took {{his family to}} live in Berezniki in Perm Krai, where his brother Ivan, a blacksmith, had been exiled the year before for failing to deliver his grain quota. Nikolai {{remained}} unemployed {{for a period of}} time and then worked again in construction. His mother, Klavdiya Vasilyevna Yeltsina, worked as a seamstress. Boris studied at Pushkin High School in Berezniki. He was fond of sports (in particular skiing, gymnastics, volleyball, track and field, boxing and wrestling) despite losing the thumb <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> of his left hand when he and some friends furtively entered a Red Army supply depot, stole several grenades, and tried to disassemble them.|$|E

2500|$|Fans of North Dakota State University Bison {{athletics}} {{also use}} a similar hand gesture, known as [...] "Go Bison!" [...] The pinky <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>fingers</b> are usually slightly bent, however, to mimic {{the shape of a}} bison's horns.|$|R
2500|$|Fans of Northwestern State University Demon {{athletics}} {{also use}} a similar hand gesture, known as [...] "Fork 'em!" [...] The pinky <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>fingers</b> are extended but a little more {{parallel to each other}} resembling the horns on a demon.|$|R
500|$|Type 1 is [...] "partial or {{total removal}} of the {{clitoris}} and/or the prepuce". Type Ia (circumcision) involves {{removal of the}} clitoral hood only. This is rarely performed alone. The more common procedure is Type Ib (clitoridectomy), the complete or partial removal of the clitoral glans (the visible tip of the clitoris) and clitoral hood. The circumciser pulls the clitoral glans with her thumb <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> and cuts it off.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} of the third plate, Tom Nero has progressed from the mistreatment of animals to theft and murder. Having {{encouraged}} his pregnant lover, Ann Gill, to rob and leave her mistress, he murders the girl when she meets him. The murder is shown to be particularly brutal: her neck, wrist, <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> are almost severed. Her trinket box and the goods she had stolen lie on the ground beside her, and the index finger of her partially severed hand points to the words [...] "God's Revenge against Murder" [...] written on a book that, along with the Book of Common Prayer, has fallen from the box. A woman searching Nero's pockets uncovers pistols, a number of pocket watches—evidence of his having turned to highway robbery (as Tom Idle did in Industry and Idleness), [...] and a letter from Ann Gill which reads: ...|$|E
500|$|Hoffman {{explained}} {{the key to}} his changeup was how he pinched the seam of the ball with his thumb <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> as he released it. He threw the changeup with the arm speed used to throw a fastball, and the spin and movement of the ball looked the same to the batter. His changeup ranged from 73–76mph. Bruce Bochy, who managed Hoffman for over a decade with the Padres, said of Hoffman's changeup: [...] "He pitched so well off his fastball [...] couldn't just sit on it every pitch." [...] "You could be sitting on [...] and still not be successful with it", says former player Mark Sweeney. It was the arm action on the change up and the late sink just before it reached the plate that allowed Hoffman to stay successful over the years. With opponents flailing to slow down their swings, teammates nicknamed Hoffman's changeup The Bugs Bunny Pitch after a famous Bugs Bunny cartoon episode. [...] "Some [...] fool you. Some guys overpower you. Hoffman embarrasses you", said former rival and later teammate Mike Piazza. After striking out on a changeup to end the game against Hoffman, Dodger catcher Paul Lo Duca said, [...] "It's like it has a parachute on it." [...] As Hoffman lost velocity on his fastball throughout his career, he compensated by maintaining a notable speed differential between that pitch and his changeup. He initially kept the grip of his changeup a secret. [...] "I was a little weird about it", Hoffman said. [...] "I didn't like talking about how I threw the change. I didn't want people to see how I gripped the ball. I thought I'd be giving away something to the hitters." [...] Later in his career, he posed for pictures of his grip, figuring everyone had seen it.|$|E
50|$|Its origin {{stems from}} the {{traditional}} way of holding a Japanese sword. The bottom three fingers of each hand are used to grip the sword tightly, with the thumb <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>fingers</b> slightly loose. The removal of digits starting with the little finger moving up the hand to the <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> progressively weakens a person's sword grip.|$|R
50|$|The two-finger salute is {{a salute}} given using only the middle <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>fingers,</b> while bending the other fingers {{at the second}} knuckle, and with the palm facing the signer. This salute is used by Cub Scouts, the Polish military, and uniformed services.|$|R
50|$|In the Commonwealth of Nations {{countries}} (except Canada), the V sign as {{an insult}} (the middle <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>fingers</b> raised, <b>and</b> given with {{back of the}} hand towards the recipient) serves a similar purpose to The finger. The V sign with palm faced outwards {{is a sign of}} peace.|$|R
500|$|The {{paintings}} show Obrenović {{standing before}} the Serb leaders and clan elders at Takovo and inciting them to revolt. According to legend, he appeared before the crowd and proclaimed: [...] "Here I am, and here you are. War to the Turks!". Obrenović is depicted standing atop a large stone, wearing a turban and a red, Oriental-style costume covered in golden embroidery, surrounded by a semi-circle of followers. A sword hangs from his waist, and two pistols protrude from his belt. His right arm points up at the sky, with the thumb, middle <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> extended. With his left hand outstretched, Obrenović waves a large revolutionary flag depicting a red cross centered against a white background. The flag is a variant of that used by the Petrović-Njegoš dynasty, which ruled Montenegro {{at the time of}} the uprising, and is reminiscent of the Christian flag flown at the Battle of Kosovo, which according to popular belief, marked the beginning of the Ottoman occupation of the Balkans. The flag provokes an enthusiastic response from the crowd, members of which raise their swords in salute. Others gesture with their muskets. To the far left, a woman places her child on top of a headstone, and both raise their hands in salute. Beside Obrenović is a priest who gives him his blessing. The priest is bearded, and wears a typical, long black robe and Eastern Orthodox religious headdress. Behind the priest is a large group of Obrenović's followers, most with their swords sheathed and hands emulating Obrenović's three-fingered gesture. To Obrenović's right, a man wearing Turkish clothes (red fez, dolman and shalvar pants) places his hand on the flagpole the rebel leader is holding. It is unclear if the man wishes to take the flag away from Obrenović or help bear it. Behind him, a large group of mustachioed men wearing similar clothes raise their arms and salute Obrenović.|$|E
2500|$|Two-mallet players use several {{different}} grips, {{with the most}} common being a palms-down grip that is basically {{the same as the}} matched grip used by drummers. [...] The mallets are held between the thumb <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> of each hand, with the remaining three fingers of each hand pressing the shafts into the down-facing palms. [...] Strokes use a combination of wrist movement and fingertip control of the shaft.|$|E
2500|$|A {{hand signal}} called [...] "Rip'em 'Eaters" [...] {{was created by}} Blake Sasaki and Dennis Wisco in 2001. When attacked, an {{anteater}} sits in a tripodal position with its hind feet and tail and tears and [...] "rips" [...] at its predator. The hand signal is done by touching {{the tips of the}} two middle fingers with the thumb, and sliding the thumb back, making the pinky <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> the ears and the fingers in the middle the snout of the anteater.|$|E
50|$|Another popular grip {{is similar}} to the timpani grip. The mallets are again held between the thumb <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> {{controlled}} with the remaining three fingers, but the palms are held vertically, facing inward towards each other. Most of the stroke action comes from the finger-tip control of the shafts.|$|R
40|$|A Variant of acrokerato elastoidosis {{characterized}} by linear, scaly, hyperkeratotic, fissured and transluscent papules on sides of thumbs <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>fingers,</b> {{was seen in}} 55 male patients, above the age, of fifty years. Actinic damage and repeated trauma were not evident. The term acrokerato - elastodosis linearis manus is suggested for this variant...|$|R
50|$|In Murghasana, the Yogi has to bend down, Pass arms between {{legs and}} hold her ear lobes with thumb <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>fingers,</b> in easy words, holding ears lobes while in uttanasana. This asana {{is very good}} for blood {{circulation}} on brain and face. It removes untimely wrinkles, sharps memory and brings glow to your face.|$|R
2500|$|Other notable putting styles include [...] "the claw", a {{style that}} has the grip {{directly}} in between the thumb <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> of the dominant hand while the palm faces the target. The weak hand placed normally on the putter. Anchored putting, {{a style that}} requires a longer putter shaft that can be anchored into the players stomach or below the chin; {{the idea is to}} stabilize one end of the putter thus creating a more consistent pendulum stroke. This style will be banned in 2016 on the profession circuits.|$|E
2500|$|His films {{frequently}} contained [...] "thrill sequences" [...] {{of extended}} chase scenes and daredevil physical feats, {{for which he}} is best remembered today. Lloyd hanging from the hands of a clock high above the street (in reality a trick shot) in Safety Last! (1923) {{is one of the most}} enduring images in all of cinema. Lloyd did many dangerous stunts himself, despite having injured himself in August 1919 while doing publicity pictures for the Roach studio. An accident with a bomb mistaken as a prop resulted in the loss of the thumb <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> of his right hand (the injury was disguised on future films with the use of a special prosthetic glove, though the glove often did not go unnoticed).|$|E
2500|$|Still, {{people came}} to EDSA until it swelled to {{hundreds}} of thousands of unarmed civilians. The mood in the street was actually very festive, with many bringing whole families. Performers entertained the crowds, nuns and priests led prayer vigils, and people set up barricades and makeshift sandbags, trees, and vehicles in several places along EDSA and intersecting streets such as Santolan and Ortigas Avenue. Everywhere, people listened to Radio Veritas on their radios. Several groups sang Bayan Ko (My Homeland), which, since 1980, had become a patriotic anthem of the opposition. People frequently flashed the 'LABAN' sign, which is an [...] "L" [...] formed with their thumb <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger.</b> 'Laban' is the Tagalog word for 'fight', but also the abbreviation of Lakas ng Bayan, Ninoy Aquino's party.|$|E
40|$|Postoperative {{infection}} after elective arthrodesis of the interphalangeal joint is {{an uncommon}} complication often necessitating urgent debridement. We present the rare {{case of a}} female patient {{with a history of}} oral herpetic lesions, who underwent elective arthrodesis of the middle <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>fingers</b> for treatment of erosive osteoarthritis and subsequently developed a postoperative herpetic infection at the surgical site...|$|R
50|$|An Around is a {{trick in}} which the pen rotates around one or more body parts and is named after the body part(s) the pen rotates around. For example, in a Middle Index Around, the pen goes around the middle <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>fingers.</b> The Thumb Around, as a fundamental, is usually the first Around a pen spinner learns.|$|R
5000|$|Fans {{from the}} heavy metal culture often make the [...] "Corna" [...] hand-signal formed by a fist with the [...] "pinkie" [...] <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>fingers</b> extended, known {{variously}} as the “devil’s horns”, the [...] "metal fist" [...] {{and other similar}} descriptors. This gesture was popularised by Black Sabbath and Dio's vocalist Ronnie James Dio, who died in 2010.|$|R
