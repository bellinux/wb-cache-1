Identification of the interior acoustical sources in the low frequency range is vitally important for the sound quality design inside the elastic cavity. By transformation of the sound pressure level into the specific loudness, a multipoint panel acoustic contribution method based on Moore-Glasberg loudness model is proposed to identify the acoustic contribution of local structural panels of an elastic cavity. The finite element (FE) equation of vibro-acoustic coupling structure with the visco-elastic damping is formulated to evaluate the <b>acoustic</b> <b>panel</b> contribution. Two parameters of acoustic contribution sum and total sound field contribution are derived to measure the acoustic contribution of each panel at the important peak frequencies for the multiple evaluation points. A carriage of high-speed train is modeled as the elastic cavity to demonstrate the application of the developed algorithm. The bottom panel of the carriage is identified to make the most significant contribution to the loudness of evaluation points. The reduction effect of the various design parameters of visco-elastic damping layer on the bottom panel is investigated. The proposed method can efficiently arrange the visco-elastic damping layer on the bottom panel to reduce the interior loudness. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|Grooved {{acoustic}} {{panels are}} rigid plates consisting of an interconnected network of periodically arranged slits and circular holes. These devices are traditionally used as resonant absorbers in building acoustics. This paper presents {{a model to}} predict the acoustic properties of such absorbers. For this purpose, the classical Johnson-Champoux-Allard (JCA) model and the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) are used together to describe the acoustic wave propagation through these systems. The proposed model was validated against Finite Element (FE) simulations in terms of sound absorption coefficient under normal incidence, for different configurations with good agreement. Additionally, a parametric study was found very useful to investigate {{the influence of the}} geometrical characteristics of the panel on the absorption performance of the absorber and in understanding its acoustic behaviour.

This is translated into the wise use of material, transportation, easy assembly and maintenance. At the same time, the target group is every single person that is called to participate in the assembly procedure, with no expertise knowledge, which adds extra challenge in the design procedure. Less is more, as Mies van der Rohe stated. This research taking a step back and revaluates the product design principle for acoustic panels. Having as starting point the HELIX panel designed by Panayiotis Hadjisergis and Ioanna Christia, during Bucky Lab course of 2015 fall, the target is to keep the advantages of this panel while improving the acoustic performance and keeping the manufacturing process as simple as possible. The target of Helix panel was to provide a flexible solution regarding acoustics and assembly. The advantages of this project were further developed into the STRAWS project.

Therefore, {{the aim of this}} research is to study the potential of turning the agricultural waste and waste paper into a sound absorption panel. For the purpose of this study, combination of two materials was under studied; coconut coir fibre from agriculture waste and shredded waste paper from the office. There were two main objective of the research; first is to develop absorption panels from coconut coir powder that available locally with a combination of shredded paper at different percentage of mixture. Second objective is to identify the absorption rate of the panels. The study encompasses the fabrication of the particle board using the coconut husk powder mix with shredded waste paper and using the gypsum powder as the binder for the two materials. Four acoustic panels of size 0. 5 m x 0. 5 m and 0. 012 m thick were fabricated with different mix ratio; 25 % of coconut coir powder mixed with 75 % of shredded waste papers for sample 1, 50 % both of the material for sample 2, 75 % of coconut coir powder mixed with 25 % of shredded waste paper for sample 3, and lastly 100 % of coconut coir powder for sample 4. The absorption coefficient of the panels was tested in a reverberation chamber and in accordance with ISO 354 : 1985 standards. Based on the results, sample 1 gave the highest absorption coefficient compared to sample 2, 3 and 4. It can be concluded that the <b>acoustic</b> <b>panel</b> made from a mixture of 25 % coconut coir powder with 75 % shredded waste paper provided higher absorption coefficient compared to the performance of the other samples. This might be caused {{by the size of the}} coir powder which is very small, creating less void space in between the panel and thus causing it to absorb less sound. Since sound absorption is very much affected by the availability of void space of the panel, further studies on other potential materials from waste should be conducted...|$|E
