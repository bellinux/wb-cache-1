25|$|Furthermore, the {{insurance}} bet {{is susceptible to}} advantage play. It is advantageous to make an insurance bet whenever the hole card {{has more than a}} chance of one in three of being a ten. Advantage play techniques can sometimes identify such situations. In a multi-hand, face-up, single deck game, it is possible to establish whether insurance is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>bet</b> simply by observing the other cards on the table after the deal; even if there are just 2 player hands exposed, and neither of their two initial cards is a ten, then 16 in 47 of the remaining cards are tens, which is larger than 1 in 3, so insurance is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>bet.</b> This is an elementary example of the family of advantage play techniques known as card counting.|$|E
25|$|After {{surrendering}} their titles {{the following}} year, Cork {{had to wait}} until 1969 for further success. A 3–12 to 1–14 defeat of Wexford in the decider gave McCarthy his first National Hurling League medal. The subsequent provincial decider pitted Cork against reigning champions Tipperary. A 4–6 to 0–9 victory gave Cork a first defeat of Tipp since 1957 while it also gave McCarthy a second Munster medal. Once again this victory paved the way for an All-Ireland showdown with Kilkenny, however, the team suffered a setback before the game when midfielder Justin McCarthy broke his leg in a motorcycle accident. In spite of this Cork led at the interval and looked <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>bet</b> for the victory, particularly after Kilkenny forward Pat Delaney left the field on a stretcher. The Rebels were still to the good coming into the last quarter, however, Kilkenny scored five unanswered points in the last seven minutes to win by 2–15 to 2–9.|$|E

6000|$|Fred {{had been}} {{rewarding}} resolution {{by a little}} laxity of late. He had been working heartily for six months at all outdoor occupations under Mr. Garth, and by dint of severe practice had nearly mastered the defects of his handwriting, this practice being, perhaps, a little the less severe that it was often carried on in the evening at Mr. Garth's under the eyes of Mary. But the last fortnight Mary had been staying at Lowick Parsonage with the ladies there, during Mr. Farebrother's residence in Middlemarch, where he was carrying out some parochial plans; and Fred, not seeing anything more agreeable to do, had turned into the Green Dragon, partly to play at billiards, partly to taste the old flavor of discourse about horses, sport, and things in general, considered from {{a point of view}} which was not strenuously correct. He had not been out hunting once this season, had had no horse of his own to ride, and had gone from place to place chiefly with Mr. Garth in his gig, or on the sober cob which Mr. Garth could lend him. It was a little too bad, Fred began to think, that he should be kept in the traces with more severity than if he had been a clergyman. [...] "I will tell you what, Mistress Mary--it will be rather harder work to learn surveying and drawing plans {{than it would have been}} to write sermons," [...] he had said, wishing her to appreciate what he went through for her sake; [...] "and as to Hercules and Theseus, they were nothing to me. They had sport, and never learned to write a bookkeeping hand." [...] And now, Mary being out of the way for a little while, Fred, like any other strong dog who cannot slip his collar, had pulled up the staple of his chain and made a small escape, not of course meaning to go fast or far. There could be no reason why he should not play at billiards, but he was determined not to bet. As to money just now, Fred had in his mind the heroic project of saving almost all of the eighty pounds that Mr. Garth offered him, and returning it, which he could easily do by giving up all futile money-spending, since he had a superfluous stock of clothes, and no expense in his board. In that way he could, in one year, go a good way towards repaying the ninety pounds of which he had deprived Mrs. Garth, unhappily at a time when she needed that sum more than she did now. Nevertheless, it must be acknowledged that on this evening, which was the fifth of his recent visits to the billiard-room, Fred had, not in his pocket, but in his mind, the ten pounds which he meant to reserve for himself from his half-year's salary (having before him the pleasure of carrying thirty to Mrs. Garth when Mary was likely to be come home again)--he had those ten pounds in his mind as a fund from which he might risk something, if there were a chance of <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>bet.</b> Why? Well, when sovereigns were flying about, why shouldn't he catch a few? He would never go far along that road again; but a man likes to assure himself, and men of pleasure generally, what he could do in the way of mischief if he chose, and that if he abstains from making himself ill, or beggaring himself, or talking with the utmost looseness which the narrow limits of human capacity will allow, it is not because he is a spooney. Fred did not enter into formal reasons, which are a very artificial, inexact way of representing the tingling returns of old habit, and the caprices of young blood: but there was lurking in him a prophetic sense that evening, that when he began to play he should also begin to bet--that he should enjoy some punch-drinking, and in general prepare himself for feeling [...] "rather seedy" [...] in the morning. It is in such indefinable movements that action often begins.|$|E

40|$|International Relations {{scholars}} have produced {{books on the}} scientific status of the discipline like Khrushchev claimed the Soviets produced missiles: like sausages. One enticing element of Jackson’s The Conduct of Inquiry in International Relations is the orthogonal perspective he brings to this growing debate.

Jackson compares these debates about science to “bringing out the big guns” and “playing with fire. ” The success or failure of Jackson’s project hinges on his ability to give an account of the logic of inquiry that does not define away important approaches to IR as unscientific. This is a difficult task because the disciplinary stakes are high: debates within the IR community over the meaning of science have major implications for the type of research valued and the standards used to assess work in our community...|$|R
