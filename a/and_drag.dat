5|$|For certain {{physical}} scenarios, it {{is impossible}} to model forces as being due to gradient of potentials. This is often due to macrophysical considerations that yield forces as arising from a macroscopic statistical average of microstates. For example, friction is caused by the gradients of numerous electrostatic potentials between the atoms, but manifests as a force model that is independent of any macroscale position vector. Nonconservative forces other than friction include other contact forces, tension, compression, <b>and</b> <b>drag.</b> However, for any sufficiently detailed description, all these forces are the results of conservative ones since each of these macroscopic forces are the net results of the gradients of microscopic potentials.|$|E

Eventually, the townspeople drug him <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> him out of their town. Out of loneliness, Bunyan carves a block of stone from the {{mountains}} into a blue ox that he calls Babe, who is rendered alive by an electric shock. In his travels with Babe, Homer creates several landmarks. Bunyan later meets a young woman, (played by Marge) and though she is initially frightened of him, the two fall in love. When a meteor is soon to hit the town, the townspeople call Paul back to help them. Paul obliges and throws the meteor towards Chicago, starting the Great Fire there, but not before it hits him in the backside.|$|E
5|$|In September 1969, Cheyenne {{prototype}} #10 (s/n 66-8835) underwent {{wind tunnel}} testing at NASA Ames Research Center, {{to research the}} half-P hop <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> issues. The engineers {{did not realize that}} the fixed mounts used to secure the aircraft in the wind tunnel would not allow the helicopter to move relative to the rotor, as it did in flight. As a result, there was no natural damping of the rotor pitching motion. The remote controllers' lack of sensory feedback from helicopter compounded the situation. During high speed testing to replicate the half-P hop vibration, the rotor oscillations quickly accelerated out of control and struck the tail boom, resulting in the destructive breakup of the helicopter.|$|E

5|$|The {{level of}} wing sweep, {{the angle of}} the wings in {{relation}} to the fuselage, can be altered in flight at the pilot's control. The variable wing can adopt any sweep angle between 25 degrees and 67 degrees, with a corresponding speed range for each angle; some Tornado ADVs were outfitted with an automatic wing-sweep system to reduce pilot workload. When the wings are swept back, the exposed wing area is lowered <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> is significantly decreased, which is conducive to performing high-speed low-level flight. The weapons pylons pivot with {{the angle of the}} variable-sweep wings so that the stores point in the direction of flight and do not hinder any wing positions.|$|E

A pipe falls onto Abi, knocking her unconscious, but Max and Steven soon find her <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> her out. She is taken to hospital with Lauren by her side in the ambulance. At the hospital Abi tells Steven {{he is going to}} be a father. Steven declares his love for her and makes a promise that he will make their relationship work. Steven then goes into cardiac arrest and dies after being injured in the fire leaving Abi devastated. In an attempt to console Lauren but also partly out of jealousy that Lauren is getting all the attention, Abi tries to tell Lauren about her pregnancy, but Lauren angrily mistakes this as gloating about her own abortion. Upset at the accusation, Abi says that she wishes Lauren died instead and that she never deserved Steven. Abi attends Steven's funeral as sole mourner and declares her love. Unable to cope with Steven's death, Abi decides to leave Walford to visit Tanya in Devon, taking Steven's ashes with her. When Lauren finds out that Abi is leaving, she asks if she and Louie can come with her. Abi agrees and they leave Walford together.|$|E
5|$|During {{a couple}} of the Svea flights, Andrée tested and tried out the drag-rope {{steering}} technique which he had developed and wanted to use on his projected North Pole expedition. Drag ropes, which hang from the balloon basket <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> part of their length on the ground, are designed to counteract the tendency of lighter-than-air craft to travel at the same speed as the wind, a situation that makes steering by sails impossible. The friction of the ropes was intended to slow the balloon {{to the point where the}} sails would have an effect (beyond that of making the balloon rotate on its axis). Andrée reported, and presumably believed, that with drag rope/sails steering he had succeeded in deviating about ten degrees either way from the wind direction. This notion is rejected by modern balloonists; the Swedish Ballooning Association maintains that Andrée's belief that he had deviated from the wind was mistaken, being misled by inexpertise and a surfeit of enthusiasm in an environment of variable winds and poor visibility. Use of drag ropes (prone to snapping, falling off, or becoming entangled with each other or the ground, in addition to being ineffective) is not considered by any modern expert to be a useful steering technique.|$|E

5|$|The MiG-1 was {{designed}} {{in response to}} a requirement for a high-altitude fighter with an inline engine issued by the VVS in January 1939. Initially the aircraft, designated I-200, {{was designed}} in the Polikarpov construction bureau. Work started in June 1939, under the direction of Nikolai Polikarpov and his assistant M. Tetivikin. Polikarpov himself preferred radial engines and promoted his I-180 design at that time, but when the powerful Mikulin AM-37 inline engine became available, he decided to use it in a fighter. The approach that he selected was to build the smallest possible aircraft around the intended powerplant, thereby minimizing weight <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> — the philosophy of the light fighter. As specified, the aircraft was to be capable of reaching 670km/h (417mph). In August 1939, Polikarpov fell out of favor with Joseph Stalin and as a result, when Polikarpov went in November 1939 to tour Germany's aviation works, the Soviet authorities decided to scatter his construction team and create a new Experimental Construction Section (OKO), headed by Artem Mikoyan and Mikhail Gurevich, which remained formally subordinated to the Polikarpov bureau until June 1940. Further work upon the I-200 design was assigned to Mikoyan and Gurevich, who later became recognized — not with full justice — as its designers.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its range, the short-tail {{stingray}} {{is caught}} incidentally by various commercial fisheries using trawls, Danish and purse seines, longlines and set lines, <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> and set nets. It is also caught by recreational fishers using hook-and-line (from boats or the shore), spears, and harpoons. Most individuals caught are released alive; often fishers cut off their tails beforehand for safety, though this practice {{does not seem}} to have a significant impact on the rays' long-term survival. Sport fishers occasionally keep captured rays for meat or angling competitions; a small number are also kept for display in public aquariums, and it has reproduced in captivity. As it survives fishing activities well and remains common throughout its range, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the short-tail stingray as Least Concern. Within most of this species' range off New Zealand, targeting it commercially is prohibited.|$|E
5|$|Green-head ant {{males are}} {{produced}} irregularly {{throughout the year}} and are low-flying ants. Recorded nuptial flights begin between September to November at temperatures of 20–25°C (68–77°F), when a number of males begin to emerge from their nest. Sometimes, however, the males may return to their nest after briefly appearing outside. The green-head ant is a gamergate species, which means that males can successfully mate with the workers. These workers remain outside their nest with their head and thorax appressed and gaster elevated into the air. Observation has shown the workers first attacking the males when the two first encounter each other, followed by the male mounting the worker by grasping it in the cervical region with its mandibles, successfully attaching itself. Both ants usually rest when they mate, but sometimes the workers may groom themselves or move about several moments after, thereby disengaging with the male. On a few occasions, workers have been seen to move as soon as copulation begins <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> the male, eventually dislodging it. Copulation usually occurs at 8 to 9 in the morning, with pairs lasting for 30 seconds to almost one minute. Most pairs mate once, but others may copulate with each other twice. In some cases, males will successfully mate with two workers, and some pairs may return to their nest while mating.|$|E
