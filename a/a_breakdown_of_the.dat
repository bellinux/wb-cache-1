A total of 54% believe the definition of the family unit in the Irish Constitution should be changed to include same-sex families.|$|E
5|$|Off-Road Velociraptor Safari {{is a free}} {{downloadable}} vehicle combat {{video game}} released on January 29, 2008 by Flashbang Studios. The game requires the Unity plug-in to run, and can be downloaded from the developers' website. Players {{assume the role of}} a Velociraptor wearing a pith helmet and monocle, driving a jeep with a spiked flail attached, and must accrue as many points as possible in a four-minute period by performing stunts and running down other Velociraptor. Each time a Velociraptor is struck, the game's speed is reduced to slow motion and its catapulted body becomes the focus of the in-game camera. The game operates a global highscore, after each game the player is given a rank for that day and a separate rank compared to the highest ever scores, along with <b>a</b> <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bonuses they were awarded during play.|$|E

5|$|Pyrrhus' {{defeat in}} the Peloponnese led to the {{diminution}} of Epirus' power {{and the loss of}} its Macedonian and Thessalian conquests. Antigonus capitalised on his Peloponnesian victory to wrest back control of Macedonia and become the preeminent power in Greece. The establishment of Macedonian dominance led to <b>a</b> <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spartan-Macedonian alliance. In a bid to further his own royal ambitions, Areus had Sparta join a coalition of Greek poleis and fought Macedon in the Chremonidean War. The war ended in a crushing Spartan defeat with Antigonus defeating and killing his former ally Areus in a battle on the Isthmus of Corinth in 265 BC. The defeat was so disastrous for Sparta that they would not rise to be a regional power until the reign of Cleomenes III thirty years later.|$|E
5|$|Still {{friends with}} Martello, Buczynski {{initiated}} him up till the third degree of the Welsh Traditionalist tradition, in return receiving third degree initiation into the Strega tradition. At the same time, {{he was facing}} problems within his own tradition as one couple running their own Welsh outer coven, Claudia and Gerard Nero, had decided to abandon Buczynski's tradition and receive initiation into Gardnerianism from the Kneitals; they had ultimately decided to do so after becoming increasingly sceptical of his historical claims to Palaeolithic roots. They took their initiates, including Margot Adler, with them, much to Buczynski and Slater's annoyance, leading to <b>a</b> <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> friendship that they had had with the Kneitals. His tradition nevertheless continued to grow and spread, and in January 1973, the tradition joined the Council of Earth Religions (COER), a pan-Pagan umbrella organisation founded the previous year {{to work for the}} common defence of the movement. His primary inner coven grew to a size that it had to divide into two at Midsummer 1973. His high priestess, Kay Smith, decided to take lead of one of them, while Eddie remained in the other, being joined by a new ritual consort named Judith. By August, there were two outer court covens of the Welsh tradition in New York City, and one each in Philadelphia and in Hopewell, Virginia.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to damaging effects on brain cells, ischemia and infarction {{can result in}} loss of structural integrity of brain tissue and blood vessels, partly through the release of matrix metalloproteases, which are zinc- and calcium-dependent enzymes that break down collagen, hyaluronic acid, and other elements of connective tissue. Other proteases also contribute to this process. The loss of vascular structural integrity results in <b>a</b> <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> protective blood brain barrier that contributes to cerebral edema, which can cause secondary progression of the brain injury.|$|E
25|$|A low {{fertility}} rate, without supplement from immigration, {{also suggests}} a declining overall EU population, which further suggests economic contraction {{or even a}} possible economic crisis. Some media have noted the 'baby crisis' in the EU, some governments have noted the problem, and the UN and other multinational authorities continue to warn of a possible crisis. At this point however such {{a decrease in the}} population of the EU is not observed as the overall natural growth remains positive and the EU continues to attract large numbers of immigrants.

Khrushchev feared that Castro's hurt pride and widespread Cuban indignation over the concessions {{he had made}} to Kennedy might lead to <b>a</b> <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> agreement between the Soviet Union and the US. To prevent that, Khrushchev decided to offer to give Cuba more than 100 tactical nuclear weapons that had been shipped to Cuba along with the long-range missiles but, crucially, had escaped the notice of U.S. intelligence. Khrushchev determined that because the Americans had not listed the missiles on their list of demands, keeping them in Cuba {{would be in the}} Soviet Union's interests.|$|E

25|$|In {{the course}} of further testing, {{it was found that}} the Hurricane had poor spin {{recovery}} characteristics, in which all rudder authority could be lost due to shielding of the rudder. Hawker's response to the issue was to request that spinning tests be waived, but the Air Ministry refused the request; the situation was resolved by the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE), who established that the aerodynamic problem had been caused by <b>a</b> <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> airflow over the lower fuselage, and could be cured by the addition of a small ventral fairing and extension of the bottom of the rudder. This discovery had come too late for the changes to be incorporated in the first production aircraft, but were introduced upon the 61st built and all subsequent aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Consumer-generated {{advertising}} {{is a relatively}} new and controversial development, and it has created a new model of marketing communication from businesses to consumers. Among the various forms of advertising on blog, the most controversial are the sponsored posts. These are blog entries or posts and may be in the form of feedback, reviews, opinion, videos, etc. and usually contain a link back to the desired site using a keyword or several keywords. Blogs have led to some disintermediation and <b>a</b> <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> traditional advertising model, where companies can skip over the advertising agencies (previously the only interface with the customer) and contact the customers directly via social media websites. On the other hand, new companies specialised in blog advertising have been established, {{to take advantage of this}} new development as well. However, there are many people who look negatively on this new development. Some believe that any form of commercial activity on blogs will destroy the blogosphere’s credibility.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect on}} beaver stocks of {{competition}} between the English and the French was disastrous. The status of beavers changed dramatically as it {{went from being a}} source of food and clothing for the Aboriginals to a vital good for exchange with the Europeans. The French were constantly in search of cheaper fur and trying to cut off the Aboriginal middleman which led them to explore the interior all the way to Lake Winnipeg and the Central Plains. While some historians dispute the claims that the competition was predominantly responsible for over-exploitation of stocks, others have used empirical analysis to emphasize the changing economic incentives for Aboriginals and role of the Europeans in the matter. Innis holds that the population of beavers decreased dramatically even before the rivalry in the 1700s and stocks in far-flung western areas were increasingly being tapped before there was any serious {{competition between the}} English and the French. However, there is widespread agreement on the matter in ethnohistory literature that Aboriginals depleted the resource. Calvin Martin holds that there was <b>a</b> <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relationship between man and animal in the values of the Aboriginals which made them drastically accelerate the exploitation of reserves.|$|E
