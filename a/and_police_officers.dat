5|$|A 2009 report, {{authored}} by Justice Manmohan Singh Liberhan, found that 68 people {{were responsible for}} the demolition, mostly leaders from the BJP. Among those named were Vajpayee, Advani, and Murli Manohar Joshi. The report also criticised Kalyan Singh, Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh during the demolition. He was accused of posting bureaucrats <b>and</b> <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> who would stay silent during the demolition. Anju Gupta, an Indian Police Service officer in charge of Advani's security, appeared as a prominent witness before the commission. She said that Advani and Joshi made provocative speeches that were {{a major factor in the}} mob's behaviour.|$|E

5|$|Local officials, the Selbstschutz, and the Hilfspolizei (Auxiliary Police) {{played a}} key role in {{rounding}} up and massacring Jewish Lithuanians, Latvians, and Estonians. These groups helped the Einsatzgruppen and other killing units to quickly identify Jews. The Hilfspolizei, consisting of auxiliary police organised by the Germans and recruited from former Latvian Army <b>and</b> <b>police</b> <b>officers,</b> ex-Aizsargi, members of the Pērkonkrusts, and university students, assisted in the murder of Latvia's Jewish citizens. Similar units were created elsewhere, and provided much of the manpower for the Holocaust in Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Even {{in modern}} democracies, Freemasonry is {{sometimes}} viewed with distrust. In the UK, Masons {{working in the}} justice system, such as judges <b>and</b> <b>police</b> <b>officers,</b> were from 1999 to 2009 required to disclose their membership. While a parliamentary inquiry found {{that there has been}} no evidence of wrongdoing, it was felt that any potential loyalties Masons might have, based on their vows to support fellow Masons, should be transparent to the public. The policy of requiring a declaration of masonic membership of applicants for judicial office (judges and magistrates) was ended in 2009 by Justice Secretary Jack Straw (who had initiated the requirement in the 1990s). Straw stated that the rule was considered disproportionate, since no impropriety or malpractice had been shown as a result of judges being Freemasons.|$|E
5|$|However, Soeprapto {{also came}} into {{conflict}} with Minister of Justice Moeljatno {{over the role of}} the prosecution. Moeljatno took the traditional view that the prosecutor general's office, {{under the control of the}} Ministry of Justice during the Dutch colonial period, was in a similar station after independence; on the other hand, Soeprapto believed that the function of the prosecutor general was half executive and half judicial and as such demanded to be accountable only to the cabinet. This conflict climaxed with Moeljatno drafting a bill to explicitly make the prosecutor general subservient to the Minister of Justice, which passed in October 1956 over heavy opposition from prosecutors <b>and</b> <b>police</b> <b>officers.</b> However, the bill fell through when the reigning cabinet collapsed in March 1957.|$|E

5|$|Human {{rights in}} Madagascar are {{protected}} {{under the constitution}} and the state is a signatory to numerous international agreements including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Religious, ethnic and sexual minorities are protected under the law. Freedom of association and assembly are also guaranteed under the law, although in practice the denial of permits for public assembly has occasionally been used to impede political demonstrations. Torture by security forces is rare and state repression is low relative to other countries with comparably few legal safeguards, although arbitrary arrests and the corruption of military <b>and</b> <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> remain problems. Ravalomanana's 2004 creation of BIANCO, an anti-corruption bureau, resulted in reduced corruption among Antananarivo's lower-level bureaucrats in particular, although high-level officials have not been prosecuted by the bureau.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} shootings, the {{soldiers}} donned berets to identify themselves. Gibraltar Police officers, including Inspector Revagliatte and his men, began {{to arrive at}} the scene almost immediately. At 16:05, only 25 minutes after assuming control, the SAS commander handed control of the operation back to the Gibraltar Police in a document stating:A military assault force completed the military option in respect of the terrorist ASU in Gibraltar and returns control to the civil power. Shortly after the shootings, soldiers <b>and</b> <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> evacuated buildings {{in the vicinity of the}} Convent, while bomb-disposal experts got to work; four hours later, the authorities announced that a car bomb had been defused, after which Savage's white Renault was towed from the car park by an army truck. The SAS personnel, meanwhile, left Gibraltar on a Royal Air Force aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In February 2014, Chief of Staff Brigadier General Dahir Adan Elmi {{announced}} that Somalia's Ministry of Defence began holding military training {{inside the country}} for the first time, with Somali instructors now teaching courses to units that joined the armed forces. He also indicated that SNA leaders had created new numbered units for the army, and that the soldiers were slated to have their respective name and unit placed on their uniform. Additionally, Elmi stated that the military had implemented a new biometric registration system, wherein each recently trained and armed soldier is photographed and fingerprinted. By the end of 2014, 17,000 national army soldiers <b>and</b> <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> had registered for the new biometric remuneration system. 13,829 SNA soldiers and 5,134 Somali Police Force officials were biometrically registered in the system as of May 2015.|$|E

5|$|In October 1998, Milošević and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke {{reached an}} {{agreement}} to temporarily end the fighting, whereby Yugoslavia would halve the amount of troops and police personnel stationed in Kosovo. The agreement came after Holbrooke convinced the KLA to consider negotiations with Belgrade, while making it clear to Milošević that failing to find a peaceful solution to the conflict {{would lead to a}} NATO bombing campaign against Serbia. The agreement required Yugoslavia to let Kosovo Verification Mission (KVM) observers enter Kosovo to ensure that the Yugoslavs were abiding by their commitment to withdraw thousands of soldier <b>and</b> <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> from the province. Small-scale clashes continued, and by December, over 1,000 people had been killed and more than 300,000 displaced in the fighting.|$|E
5|$|With about 10seconds left in {{the tenth}} round, Judah hit Mayweather with a low blow and {{followed}} it with a right hand {{to the back of}} Mayweather's head. As Mayweather hopped around the ring in pain, Steele called time to give Mayweather a rest period. Mayweather's uncle and trainer, Roger Mayweather, climbed into the ring and approached Judah. Yoel Judah entered the ring and threw a punch at Roger. At that point, members of both fighters' camps entered the ring and an all-out melee ensued. More than a dozen security officers <b>and</b> <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> rushed into the ring and managed to control the situation. After the ring was cleared, Roger Mayweather was ejected from the fight. Mayweather cruised through the last two rounds {{on his way to a}} unanimous decision victory by scores of 116–112, 117–111 and 119–109.|$|E
5|$|Alan and Tequila {{discover}} a hidden {{passage in the}} hospital leading to Wong's arsenal. They are confronted by Mad Dog, who engages them. Wong arrives {{at the hospital and}} has all the patients, police officers and staff taken hostage. After fighting their way to the main lobby, Alan and Tequila liberate the kidnapped patients <b>and</b> <b>police</b> <b>officers.</b> Pang evacuates the lobby while police detective Teresa Chang (Teresa Mo) goes to the maternity ward to organize evacuating the babies. Alan and Tequila continue fighting gangsters until they find Mad Dog. While Tequila goes to assist Chang with the babies, Alan and Mad Dog find themselves in a standoff with a group of patients caught in the middle. They slowly put their guns down and offer the patients safe passage, until Wong appears and shoots them all. An enraged Mad Dog shoots Wong's gun out of his hand. Wong shoots and kills Mad Dog while Alan escapes.|$|E

5|$|Huang Na {{went missing}} on 10 October 2004; she {{was last seen}} at a food court near the {{wholesale}} centre, barefoot and wearing a blue denim jacket and bermuda shorts. From 7 a.m. to past midnight every day for three weeks, Shuying looked across the island for her daughter. The police, including a Criminal Investigation Department team, conducted an intensive search for the girl, <b>and</b> <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> carried photographs of her while on their daily rounds. Volunteers formed search parties and Crime Library, a voluntary group dedicated to finding missing persons, distributed over 70,000 leaflets appealing for information. Two Singaporeans offered rewards of S$10,000 and S$5,000 for finding Huang Na, while the manager of an online design company set up a website to raise awareness and gather tip-offs. The search even extended to Malaysia, with volunteers putting up posters in the nearby cities of Johor Bahru and Kuala Lumpur.|$|E
