5|$|By 3 May 1975, North Vietnamese forces {{controlled}} all of South Vietnam, just 55 {{days after}} opening their attack on Buôn Ma Thuột. During that time period, {{an army of}} approximately three-quarters of a million men was defeated by a force one-fourth its size. Since {{the end of the}} war, there has been much historical recrimination and discussion as to how and why such <b>a</b> <b>lopsided</b> victory had occurred. Four main lines of thought have remained particularly viable, all of which possess some validity, but all are also open to argument.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>a</b> <b>lopsided</b> {{start in}} the early 20th century, the Terps and Midshipmen were evenly matched {{for most of the}} history of the series. Between 1931 and 1965, Navy won six and Maryland five games. In the 2005 season opener, Navy was coming off one of its best seasons in history with a 10–2 record the {{previous}} year. Maryland struggled later in 2005, but proved a competitive match for Navy and achieved a last-minute win, 23–20.|$|E
5|$|Heisman {{challenged}} Pop Warner's undefeated Pittsburgh team to {{a decisive}} national championship game, but he declined. In the next season of 1918, Tech lost <b>a</b> <b>lopsided</b> game to Pitt 320. Center Bum Day became the first player from the south selected for Walter Camp's first team. In 1919, Auburn upset Tech for the SIAA crown. By 1919, Heisman had divorced his wife and felt that he would embarrass his wife socially if he remained in Atlanta. Heisman moved to Pennsylvania, leaving Tech {{in the hands of}} William Alexander.|$|E
25|$|In 1969, Texas was off {{and running}} with its new {{offensive}} formation, the Wishbone. After dismantling all opponents of the 1968 season, Texas won the SWC crown again and this time faced the Tennessee Volunteers, in what was <b>a</b> <b>lopside</b> win for Texas with almost 400 rushing yards. Texas won 36–13.|$|R

5|$|Although the {{two sides}} were about even in number, Brant had won <b>a</b> <b>lopsided</b> victory. All of the Americans were killed or captured; none of Brant's men were injured. According to a {{detailed}} list prepared by Brant and sent to Detroit, 37 Americans were killed and 64 were captured. Some of the American dead—some sources say most—had been executed after surrendering. This included Lochry, who {{was sitting on a}} log after the battle when a Shawnee warrior killed him with a tomahawk blow to the head. According to some accounts, Brant prevented the Indians from killing even more of the prisoners. The dead were scalped and left unburied.|$|E
5|$|Games between FBS and FCS teams {{typically}} {{result in}} lopsided victories for the FBS team, and the Appalachian State–Michigan game {{was not expected}} to be an exception. The predicted outcome was <b>a</b> <b>lopsided</b> victory for Michigan. Las Vegas sportsbooks did not give a betting line. The game was also the first to be broadcast on the then-new Big Ten Network. It began with a strong first half for Appalachian State, who held a 28–17 lead {{at the end of the}} half. Michigan regained the lead at 32–31 in the fourth quarter, but Appalachian State took the lead for a second time on a short field goal with 26seconds left. The Mountaineers blocked a game-winning field goal attempt from Michigan at the end of regulation to secure a 34–32 win.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, the Mets won the National League Championship Series {{for their}} fifth pennant while the Phillies entered a rebuild phase. The Mets beat the Phillies 14 times and lost 5 for <b>a</b> <b>lopsided</b> season series. The season still {{provided}} contentious moments such as, Mets pitcher Matt Harvey drilling Phillies 2nd baseman Chase Utley {{in retaliation for}} Mets players getting hit by Phillies pitchers, a benches clearing argument between Phillies coach Larry Bowa in regards to a quick pitch by Hansel Robles and a bat flip by Daniel Murphy. Phillies star Chase Utley while, traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers mid-season, injured Mets shortstop Rubén Tejada on a legal slide during Game 2 of the National League Division Series.|$|E

50|$|In the semi-final round, Brookins faced team-mate Kyle Watson. In <b>a</b> {{somewhat}} <b>lopsided</b> bout, Brookins controlled Watson on {{the ground}} to take a 30-27 judges decision. The win moved Brookins into the finals against Michael Johnson.|$|R
5|$|In {{the general}} election, Patton faced Republican Eugene Goss. Goss criticized Patton for announcing that, if elected, he would seek the governor's {{office at the}} {{expiration}} of his term. Goss insisted {{that he would not}} seek the governorship if elected, and maintained that using the lieutenant governor's post as a stepping stone to the governor's office was a betrayal of the office and its authority. Goss ran an unorthodox campaign, limiting individual contributions to his campaign to $300 and refusing to run television commercials. Patton went on to <b>a</b> <b>lopsided</b> victory in the general election, winning 514,023votes to Goss's 250,857.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} contest of the {{primaries}} season, Clinton only very narrowly won the Iowa Democratic caucuses, held February 1, over an increasingly popular Sanders, making {{her the first}} woman to win the Iowa caucuses. In the first primary, held in New Hampshire on February 9, she lost to Sanders by a wide margin. Sanders was an increasing threat in the next contest, the Nevada caucuses on February 20, but Clinton managed a five-percentage-point win, aided by final-days campaigning among casino workers. Clinton followed that with <b>a</b> <b>lopsided</b> victory in the South Carolina primary on February 27. These two victories stabilized her campaign and showed an avoidance of the management turmoil that harmed her 2008 effort.|$|E
5|$|Lleyton Hewitt and Roger Federer played {{each other}} on 27 occasions. Early in their careers, Hewitt {{dominated}} Federer, winning seven of their first nine meetings, including a victory from two sets down in the 2003 Davis Cup semifinal which allowed Australia to defeat Switzerland. However, from 2004 onward, Federer dominated the rivalry, winning 16 of the last 18 meetings to finish with an 18–9 overall head-to-head record. This is Hewitt's longest rivalry as these two first played each other as juniors in 1996. They met in one Grand Slam tournament final, the 2004 US Open final, where Federer won his first US Open title in <b>a</b> <b>lopsided</b> encounter in which Federer scored a bagel {{on both sides of}} a second-set tiebreak. Federer met Hewitt at six of the Grand Slam tournaments in which he lifted the trophy, including all five of his triumphs between 2004 and 2005. Their last meeting was at the 2014 Brisbane International, where Hewitt triumphed over Federer in three sets for his first title since 2010, when he also beat Federer to the Halle title.|$|E
5000|$|Strother's first {{campaign}} management {{role was}} {{on behalf of}} the Democrat Mary Evelyn Parker, who was elected {{for the first time on}} February 6, 1968, as the Louisiana state treasurer in <b>a</b> <b>lopside</b> race against the Republican candidate Allison Kolb. In time, Strother became a consultant to U.S. Senators Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, Russell B. Long, John Breaux and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, John Stennis of Mississippi, Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, Gary Hart of Colorado, Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas, [...] Al Gore of Tennessee, and many others.

In the quarter-finals, West Germany beat highly regarded Yugoslavia - the Olympic silver medalists of 1952 - with 2-0.

5|$|On July 21, 1832, the militiamen {{caught up}} with the British Band near present-day Sauk City, Wisconsin. To buy time for the noncombatants to cross the Wisconsin River, Black Hawk and Neapope confronted the Americans in a rear guard action that became known as the Battle of Wisconsin Heights. Black Hawk was desperately outnumbered, leading about 50 Sauks and 60 to 70 Kickapoos against 750 militiamen. The battle was <b>a</b> <b>lopsided</b> victory for the militiamen, who lost only one man while killing as many as 68 of Black Hawk's warriors. Despite the high casualties, the battle allowed much of the British Band, {{including}} many women and children, to escape across the river. Black Hawk had managed to hold off a much larger force while allowing most of his people to escape, a difficult military operation that impressed some U.S. Army officers when they learned of it.|$|E
5|$|The {{vertebral}} column {{was composed of}} nine cervical (neck) vertebrae, 13 dorsal (back) vertebrae, three sacral (hip) vertebrae, and at least 40 caudal (tail) vertebrae. The pubis faced forward, as with most saurischians. It had a slighter build than that of Plateosaurus, an otherwise similar dinosaur. The neck was proportionally longer than in most other plateosaurids, with the foremost cervicals being four times {{the length of the}}ir width. The forelimbs were only half the length of the hindlimbs but quite powerful, as indicated by the broad upper end of the humerus that provided attachment areas for a large arm musculature. Like Plateosaurus, it had five digits on each hand and foot. The hand was short and wide, with a large sickle shaped thumb claw used for feeding or defense against predators. The thumb was the longest finger in the hand, while the fourth and fifth digits were tiny, giving the forepaws <b>a</b> <b>lopsided</b> look.|$|E

25|$|The {{game was}} {{dominated}} by both defenses, despite <b>a</b> <b>lopsided</b> finish. Troy State's ninth-ranked defense held Arkansas under 150 total yards and six first downs. Arkansas shut out their first opponent since blanking Southwest Missouri State 38–0 in 2000. Special teams stepped up for the Hogs, and two blocked punts, one recovered in the end zone, helped out a struggling offense.|$|E

25|$|When the University of Michigan and Ohio State met for {{the first}} time in 1897, the Toledo War was within the {{memories}} of some still living, and the short-lived border war may have fueled the rivalry between the two opposing teams.
