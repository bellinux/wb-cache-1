30|$|I provide {{equations}} to re- and de-lever betas {{under different}} assumptions regarding the riskiness of debt and the taxation of a COD. When a COD is not taxed, {{the distribution of}} losses on interest and principal payments becomes important. I look at five cases: the risk-free case, the risky case with <b>a</b> <b>taxed</b> COD, the risky case without <b>a</b> <b>taxed</b> COD and pro rata distributed losses, the risky case without <b>a</b> <b>taxed</b> COD and interest prioritization, and the risky case without <b>a</b> <b>taxed</b> COD and principal prioritization. I find that equations differ substantially so that {{the application of the}} incorrect procedure potentially leads to big errors in determining the discount rate. Additionally, the same equations for de- and re-levering betas for a single-period setting hold for a simple i.i.d. infinite horizon setting with constant leverage.|$|R
40|$|The {{contribution}} {{of this paper}} is to derive an optimal redistribution scheme for trade gains in the case of a government's objective function that explicitly accounts for the equity-efficiency trade-off. The government pays unemployment benefits (UB) either financed by <b>a</b> wage <b>tax,</b> <b>a</b> payroll <b>tax</b> or <b>a</b> profit <b>tax</b> paid by exporters only. Using a Melitz-type framework with unionized labor markets and heterogeneous workers we show that there is a clear-cut ranking of the redistribution schemes in terms of welfare level: 1.

In contrast, a marginal increase of <b>a</b> profit <b>tax</b> reduces the incentive to produce information and increases the probability of trade.
