5|$|A {{cervical}} mucus plug, called the operculum, forms inside the cervical canal during pregnancy. This provides a protective seal for the uterus against {{the entry of}} pathogens and against leakage of uterine fluids. The mucus plug is also known to have <b>antibacterial</b> <b>properties.</b> This plug is released as the cervix dilates, either during {{the first stage of}} childbirth or shortly before. It is visible as a blood-tinged mucous discharge.|$|E
5|$|Reflecting {{the basic}} {{properties}} of ZnO, fine particles of the oxide have deodorizing and <b>antibacterial</b> <b>properties</b> {{and for that}} reason are added into materials including cotton fabric, rubber, oral care products, and food packaging. Enhanced antibacterial action of fine particles compared to bulk material is not exclusive to ZnO and is observed for other materials, such as silver. This property results from the increased surface area of the fine particles.|$|E

The college has also created two grass variants, Shadow Turf, a drought-tolerant turf grass that thrives in shade, and Tech Turf (marketed as Turffalo), a turf grass with the rich color and texture of Bermuda and the resilience of buffalo grass.|$|E
5|$|The major use {{of silver}} besides coinage {{throughout}} most of history was {{in the manufacture of}} jewellery and other general-use items, and this continues to be a major use today. Examples include table silver for cutlery, for which silver is highly suited due to its <b>antibacterial</b> <b>properties.</b> Western concert flutes are usually plated with or made out of sterling silver; in fact, most silverware is only silver-plated rather than made out of pure silver; the silver is normally put in place by electroplating. Silver-plated glass (as opposed to metal) is used for mirrors, vacuum flasks, and Christmas tree decorations.|$|E
5|$|Photochromic lenses include silver halides, so that {{ultraviolet}} light in natural daylight liberates metallic silver, darkening the lenses. The silver halides are reformed in lower light intensities. Colourless silver chloride films {{are used in}} radiation detectors. Zeolite sieves incorporating Ag+ ions are used to desalinate seawater during rescues, using silver ions to precipitate chloride as silver chloride. Silver is also used for its <b>antibacterial</b> <b>properties</b> for water sanitisation, but the application of this is limited by limits on silver consumption. Colloidal silver is similarly used to disinfect closed swimming pools; while it {{has the advantage of}} not giving off a smell like hypochlorite treatments do, colloidal silver is not effective enough for more contaminated open swimming pools. Small silver iodide crystals are used in cloud seeding to cause rain.|$|E
30|$|Studies {{showed that}} ZnO {{nanoparticles}} have an effective <b>antibacterial</b> <b>property</b> against different bacteria {{and have a}} good compatibility with human cells and have no toxic effect on mammalians’ cells [7]. Moreover, ZnO nanoparticles modification with some transition metals causes an enhancement in efficacy and antibacterial action of these nanoparticles. Among different metals, copper due to its advantages like low cost, accessibility, and proper <b>antibacterial</b> <b>property</b> has gained much attention [8]. Antibacterial mechanism of action of copper could be originated from creating active oxygen species and disrupting bacterial cells’ membrane processes [9, 10]. Modification of ZnO nanoparticles by Cu ions can improve the <b>antibacterial</b> <b>property</b> of resultant nanohybrids [11]. Moreover, the presence of ZnO nanoparticles in polymer coatings matrix could noticeably increase the produced coatings mechanical properties [12, 13].|$|R
30|$|Moreover, the biomolecules {{present on}} AgNPs enhances the {{antibacterial}} efficacy {{due to the}} <b>antibacterial</b> <b>property</b> of these molecules. Antibacterial activity of B. sensitivum on both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria was already reported (Natarajan et al. 2010; Sakthivel and Guruvayoorappan 2012). Based on the results obtained from the disc diffusion technique, {{it was clear that}} the synthesized AgNPs can successfully inhibit bacterial proliferation and hence it can be used for the development of materials where <b>antibacterial</b> <b>property</b> is essential.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the <b>antibacterial</b> <b>property</b> of the Cayratia trifolia L. alcoholic leaves extract (CALE) to boils caused primarily by Staphylococcus aureus. Microbiological tests like culture, Gram's stain and coagulase test were employed to isolate and identify the bacteria. CALE at concentrations of 25 %, 50 %, 75 % and 100 % were utilized {{to determine whether they}} could produce significant inhibition of the growth of the boil-causing bacteria. Results of the susceptibility test showed that the CALE concentrations exhibited <b>antibacterial</b> <b>property</b> with 25 %, 50 %, 75 % and 100 % recorded a mean zone of inhibition of 18. 33 mm, 20. 67 mm, 23. 67 mm and 25. 67 mm, respectively against a control drug. In conclusion, 75 % and 100 % CALE treatments possess a comparable <b>antibacterial</b> <b>property</b> as an alternative remedy for boils...|$|R
5|$|Volvariella bombycina, {{commonly}} known as the silky sheath, silky rosegill, silver-silk straw mushroom, or tree mushroom, is a species of edible mushroom in the family Pluteaceae. It is an uncommon but widespread species, having been reported from Asia, Australia, the Caribbean, Europe, and North America. The fruit body (mushroom) begins developing in a thin, egg-like sac. This ruptures and the stem expands quickly, leaving the sac {{at the base of the}} stem as a volva. The cap, which can attain a diameter of up to , is white to slightly yellowish and covered with silky hairs. On the underside of the cap are closely spaced gills, free from attachment to the stem, and initially white before turning pink as the spores mature. The mushroom grows singly or in clusters, often appearing in old knotholes and wounds in elms and maples. V.bombycina contains compounds with <b>antibacterial</b> <b>properties.</b>|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of grey jays live {{where there is a}} strong presence of black spruce (Picea mariana), white spruce (P. glauca), Engelmann spruce (P. engelmanni), jack pine (Pinus banksiana), or lodgepole pine (P. contorta). Grey jays do not inhabit the snowy, coniferous, and therefore seemingly appropriate Sierra Nevada of California where no spruce occur. Nor do grey jays live in lower elevations of coastal Alaska or British Columbia dominated by Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis). The key habitat requirements may be sufficiently cold temperatures to ensure successful storage of perishable food and tree bark with sufficiently pliable scales arranged in a shingle-like configuration that allows grey jays to wedge food items easily up into dry, concealed storage locations. Storage may also be assisted by the <b>antibacterial</b> <b>properties</b> of the bark and foliage of boreal tree species. An exception to this general picture may be the well-marked subspecies P. c. obscurus. It lives right down to the coast from Washington to northern California in the absence of cold temperatures or the putatively necessary tree species.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{atmospheric}} pressure nitrogen plasma treatment {{was applied to}} cotton fabrics in the coating process of cotton fabric coated with 5, 5 -dimethylhydantoin (DMH) with the aim to enhance the adhesion of DMH and <b>antibacterial</b> <b>property.</b> Then chlorine was introduced into nitrogen-containing groups on the coated cotton fabrics {{in order to make}} it antibacterial by chlorination with sodium hypochlorite. The <b>antibacterial</b> <b>property,</b> rechargeability and stability of the coated cotton fabrics were investigated. FTIR, UV and SEM were used to evaluate the surface properties, including the existence of DMH on cotton fabrics, the content of DMH on cotton fabrics and the surface topography of cotton fabrics after modification. The results showed that nitrogen plasma treatment introduces nitrogen-containing groups into cotton fabrics and enhances the adhesion of DMH on the fabrics, and introduction of chlorine on the coated fabrics inhibits bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), effectively and the <b>antibacterial</b> <b>property</b> is regenerable. Therefore, the antibacterial finishing of cotton fabrics coated with DMH with the aid of nitrogen plasma treatment achieves good effect. School of Desig...|$|R
40|$|To develop {{implants}} {{with long-term}} <b>antibacterial</b> <b>property,</b> hydroxyapatite (HA) -gentamicin sulfate (GS) composite powder were synthesized and deposited onto titanium substrates by vacuum cold spraying at room temperature. The successful fabrication of the HA-GS composite powder and coatings {{was confirmed by}} transmission electron microscopy (TEM), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, respectively. Gentamicin release kinetics, <b>antibacterial</b> <b>property</b> and biocompatibility were systematically investigated in vitro. Results indicate that we can effectively load the coating with antibiotic and the coating shows long-term antibacterial capacity. Moreover, the HA-GS composite coatings displayed excellent biocompatibility. The approach in this study provides an alternative to fabricate an efficient bioactive drug delivery system for biomedical applications...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, the <b>antibacterial</b> <b>property</b> of hemp fiber was studied {{before and}} after {{extracted}} with ethanol. Simultaneously, the chemical composition of ethanol extract from hemp fiber was analyzed and characterized by UR and FT-IR. Experiment results show that, the <b>antibacterial</b> <b>property</b> of hemp fiber decreased after extracted with ethanol. The Inhibitory rate to Candida albicans decreased from 85. 7 % to 64. 4 %. The Inhibitory rate to Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans deceased as extraction time prolonging, and attained equilibrium after about 4 hours. Through experiments and date analysis by using FT-IR and UV, hemp fiber contains chalcone. It is initially argued that the active anti-bacterial constituents of hemp fiber may be alkaloids, flavones and saponins...|$|R
40|$|Studies were {{performed}} on surface modification of antibacterial TiO 2 /Ag+ nanoparticles by grafting gamma-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APS). The interfacial structure of the modified particles was characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. The thickness of the surface layer was determined by using Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). The results show that APS is chemically bonded {{to the surface of}} antibacterial TiO 2 /Ag+ nanoparticles. Furthermore, the modified particles were mixed in PVC to prepare composites whose <b>antibacterial</b> <b>property</b> was investigated. The results suggest that surface modification has no negative effect on antibacterial activity of TiO 2 /Ag+ nanoparticles and PVC-TiO 2 /Ag+ composites exhibits good <b>antibacterial</b> <b>property.</b> (c) 2005 Elsevier B.

25|$|Studies {{have been}} {{conducted}} to examine the E. coli O157:H7 bactericidal efficacies on 25 different copper alloys to identify those alloys that provide the best combination of antimicrobial activity, corrosion/oxidation resistance, and fabrication properties. Copper's antibacterial effect {{was found to be}} intrinsic in all of the copper alloys tested. As in previous studies, no <b>antibacterial</b> <b>properties</b> were observed on stainless steel (UNS S30400). Also, in confirmation with earlier studies the rate of drop-off of E. coli O157:H7 on the copper alloys is faster at room temperature than at chill temperature.|$|E
25|$|Despite that A.ustus {{has long}} been {{recognized}} as a common soil-associated fungus, knowledge of its biochemistry remained poor until recently. One of the first metabolites to be isolated and characterized from this fungus, ustic acid (C11H7O7), reacts with Iron (III) chloride to form a deep purple-colored compound. Ustic acid has since been shown to occur in other fungi, notably closely related Aspergilli such as A.granulosus and A.puniceus. Aspergillus ustus produce {{a number of other}} metabolites including autocystins (and versicolourins), austalides, a sterigmatocystin-like chemical, and nidulol.

25|$|Another {{group of}} {{hypotheses}} contended that dark skin pigmentation developed as antibacterial protection against tropical infectious diseases and parasites. Although {{it is true}} that eumelanin has <b>antibacterial</b> <b>properties,</b> its importance is secondary as a physical absorbed to protect against UVR induced damage. This hypothesis is not consistent with the evidence that most of the hominid evolution took place in savanna environment and not in tropical rainforests. Humans living in hot and sunny environments have darker skin than humans who live in wet and cloudy environments. The antimicrobial hypothesis also does not explain why some populations (like the Inuit or Tibetans) who live far from the tropics and are exposed to high UVR have darker skin pigmentation than their surrounding populations.|$|E

25|$|Naturally {{occurring}} chitin {{and certain}} peptides {{have been recognized}} for their antimicrobial properties in the past. Today, these materials are engineered into nanoparticles {{in order to produce}} low-cost disinfection applications. Natural peptides form nano-scale channels in the bacterial cell membranes, which causes osmotic collapse. These peptides are now synthesized in order to tailor the antimicrobial nanostructures with respect to size, morphology, coatings, derivatization, and other properties allowing them to be used for specific antimicrobial properties as desired. Chitosan is a polymer obtained from chitin in arthropod shells, and has been used for its <b>antibacterial</b> <b>properties</b> for a while, but even more so since the polymer has been made into nanoparticles. Chitosan proves to be effective against bacteria, viruses, and fungi, however it is more effective against fungi and viruses than bacteria. The positively charged chitosan nanoparticles interact with the negatively charged cell membrane, which causes an increase in membrane permeability and eventually the intracellular components leak and rupture.|$|E
25|$|Anecdotal {{claims for}} an {{antimicrobial}} effect {{are based on}} abstract scientific experiments which show some antimicrobial activity in commercial grapefruit seed extracts and ethanol grapefruit seed extract but not natural GSE. The preliminary studies for the antimicrobial effect state that the Citricidal commercial brand of GSE was used for testing. There is considerable scientific evidence that the anti-microbial activity associated with grapefruit seed extract {{can be attributed to}} the contamination or adulteration of commercial GSE preparations with synthetic antimicrobials or preservatives. According to a 2001 study, branded commercial GSE preparations were contaminated with synthetic benzethonium chloride that was unlikely to have been made from grapefruit seeds. Some of the marketers claimed that their product did not contain benzethonium chloride and the error was due to the similarity in molecular weight of the quaternary ammonium compound which was formed through a proprietary manufacturing process. It is highly improbable that the preservative benzethonium chloride is formed during any extraction and/or processing of grapefruit seeds and pulp. Researchers conclusively demonstrated the presence of benzethonium chloride in commercial GSE using various analytical methods including HPLC, one- and two-dimensional NMR, PIXE analysis, and electrospray ionization MS. Another in vitro study claimed GSE had <b>antibacterial</b> <b>properties.</b> As with the branded in vitro test this extract was contaminated. The ethanolic grapefruit seed and pulp extract tested was prepared or contaminated with ethanol, a chemical solvent used in the extraction process. Ethanol, also known as ethyl alcohol, is effective in inhibiting bacteria.|$|E
