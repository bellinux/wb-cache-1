About week later, the Cabinet supported a measure by Minister for Primary Industries, Vic Sullivan, to offer low-interest loans to farmer who lost {{significant amounts of}} crops and livestock. Later, Queensland Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen requested aid from the national government. Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser approved low-interest loans up to $25,000 (1979AUD) for small businesses and the implementation of other measures for recovery.|$|E

5|$|An outward {{shift of}} the PPF results from growth of the {{availability}} of inputs, such as physical capital or labour, or from technological progress in knowledge of how to transform inputs into outputs. Such a shift reflects, for instance, economic growth of an economy already operating at its full productivity (on the PPF), which means that more of both outputs can now be produced during the specified period of time without sacrificing the output of either good. Conversely, the PPF will shift inward if the labor force shrinks, the supply of raw materials is depleted, or <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> <b>disaster</b> decreases the stock of physical capital.|$|E
5|$|In the 6th {{or early}} 7th century <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> <b>disaster</b> caused a devastating flood of the Motagua Valley and buried {{the surface of}} the site under a deep layer of silt, {{completely}} changing the landscape.

5|$|The {{disaster}} {{had major}} implications {{for a large}} segment of the population, economy, and politics of the entire United States.

5|$|The text {{presents}} Cyrus as entering Babylon peacefully {{and being}} welcomed by {{the population as}} a liberator. This presents an implicit contrast with previous conquerors, notably the Assyrian rulers Tukulti-Ninurta I, who invaded and plundered Babylon in the 12th century BC, and Sennacherib, who did the same thing 150 years before Cyrus conquered the region. The massacre and enslavement of conquered people was common practice and was explicitly highlighted by conquerors in victory statements. The Cyrus Cylinder presents a very different message; Johannes Haubold notes that it portrays Cyrus's takeover as a harmonious moment of convergence between Babylonian and Persian history, not <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> <b>disaster</b> but the salvation of Babylonia.|$|E

In the 2000s and 2010s, the show dealt with controversial issues such as homosexuality, gambling, prostitution, surrogacy, and exotic dancing. Health issues were also focused on, including multiple sclerosis, bipolar disorder, epilepsy, amnesia, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and alzheimer's disease.

5|$|On April 1, 1998, seven {{counties}} in Minnesota were declared federal disaster areas: Brown, Le Sueur, Nicollet, Rice, Cottonwood, Blue Earth and Nobles.

In addition to the federal dollars, the state of Minnesota contributed $27.6million to the cleanup and rebuilding effort, with $1.35million designated specifically for the preservation of the historical buildings in St. Peter. Most of St. Peter's buildings that were on the National Historic Register were damaged, but only one—a French Second Empire school building built in 1871 (St. Peter Central School)—had to be demolished.

5|$|Abir {{enjoyed a}} boom {{through the late}} 1890s, by selling a {{kilogram}} of rubber in Europe for up to 10 fr which had cost them just 1.35 fr. However, this came {{at a cost to}} the human rights of those who could not pay the tax with imprisonment, flogging and other corporal punishment recorded. Abir's failure to suppress destructive harvesting methods and to maintain rubber plantations meant that the vines became increasingly scarce and by 1904 profits began to fall. During the early 1900s famine and disease spread across the concession, <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> <b>disaster</b> judged by some to have been exacerbated by Abir's operations, further hindering rubber collection. The 1900s also saw widespread rebellions against Abir's rule in the concession and attempts at mass migration to the French Congo or southwards. These events typically resulted in Abir dispatching an armed force to restore order.|$|E
5|$|Should {{the player}} choose {{to fulfill the}} promise, the protagonist begins her sophomore year at St. PigeoNation's largely as normal, but with one exception—she begins to have {{recurring}} dreams of her younger self and Ryouta, and her parents lying dead {{in front of an}} unfamiliar house. A mysterious man approaches them, promising to grant any wish that they make. On 2 September, she decides to check on Ryouta, who had gone to the infirmary earlier that day; the next morning, she fails to show up for class. Kazuaki asks Ryouta to retrieve their class' box of print handouts, and upon retrieving it, blood is discovered leaking from a corner of the box. Ryouta opens the lid, and it is revealed that the box contains the protagonist's severed head. A siren sounds and there is an order to evacuate to the gymnasium, where Ryouta overhears other students mention that more pieces of a human corpse were found in the other print boxes. Doubting the headmaster's explanation of <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> <b>disaster</b> occurring, Sakuya and Ryouta resolve to figure out the identity of the protagonist's killer and leave the gymnasium, discovering a large metal dome surrounding the school. Upon returning to their classroom and finding the box empty, Yuuya explains that the protagonist's body had been gathered in the chemistry lab, where Shuu performs an autopsy concluding that the protagonist died of asphyxiation caused by illness or poison with the dismemberment occurring afterwards.|$|E

Through a joint effort between the IBRD and the International Finance Corporation, the Bank offers financing to subnational entities either with or without sovereign guarantees. For borrowers needing quick financing for an unexpected change, the IBRD operates a Deferred Drawdown Option {{which serves as a}} line of credit with features similar to the Bank's flexible loan program. Among the World Bank Group's credit enhancement and guarantee products, the IBRD offers policy-based guarantees to cover countries' sovereign default risk, partial credit guarantees to cover the credit risk of a sovereign government or subnational entity, and partial risk guarantees to private projects to cover a government's failure to meet its contractual obligations.

40|$|Since the 1990 s, {{the number}} of <b>natural</b> <b>disasters</b> has been rapidly increasing.
