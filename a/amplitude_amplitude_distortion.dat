40|$|A {{conventional}} processing, {{without a}} reliable adjustment {{in order to}} preserve the seismic <b>amplitudes,</b> could damage the mapping of the petrophysical properties, jeopardizing the correlation between the seismic data and the well profile. A manner to estimate correctly the <b>amplitudes</b> and, therefore, the reflection coefficients is to perform a pre-stack migration in true <b>amplitude,</b> where an <b>amplitude</b> <b>distortion</b> caused by the geometrical spreading throughout the ray path is compensated by the migration calculation. Nevertheless, this process has an expensive cost as well as is dependent from the velocity model. A routine less expensive than the other one and also more stable taking into account the velocity model, is to transform the seismic section obtained from the acquisition in common offsets in simulated section in zero offset with true <b>amplitudes.</b> This transformation is called true <b>amplitude</b> Zero Offset migration (TA MZO). In a media with constant velocity, the stack curve for the MZO and the weight function are reduced in analytic formulas, mitigating the computational effort. This work has two main objects: the first is to verify the TA MZO algorithm efficiency for a constant velocity in a synthetic model to a complex geology based on a Neo-Albian turbidity reservoir, where the assumption of constant velocity is not respected.

40|$|A {{time and}} frequency-domain {{analysis}} {{is made of}} the effects of averaging and sampling methods used for constructing magnetic-observatory hourly data values. Using 1 -min data as a proxy for continuous, geomagnetic variation, we construct synthetic hourly values of two standard types: instantaneous "spot" measurements and simple 1 -h "boxcar" averages. We compare these average-sample types with others: 2 -h average, Gaussian, and "brick-wall" low-frequency-pass. Hourly spot measurements provide a statistically unbiased representation of the <b>amplitude</b> range of geomagnetic-field variation, but as a representation of continuous field variation over time, they are significantly affected by aliasing, especially at high latitudes. The 1 -h, 2 -h, and Gaussian average-samples are affected by a combination of <b>amplitude</b> <b>distortion</b> and aliasing. Brick-wall values are not affected by either <b>amplitude</b> <b>distortion</b> or aliasing, but constructing them is, in an operational setting, relatively more difficult than it is for other average-sample types. It is noteworthy that 1 -h average-samples, the present standard for observatory hourly data, have properties similar to Gaussian average-samples that have been optimized for a minimum residual sum of <b>amplitude</b> <b>distortion</b> and aliasing. For 1 -h average-samples from medium and low-latitude observatories, the average of the combination of <b>amplitude</b> <b>distortion</b> and aliasing is less than the 5. 0 nT accuracy standard established by Intermagnet for modern 1 -min data. For medium and low-latitude observatories, average differences between monthly means constructed from 1 -min data and monthly means constructed from any of the hourly average-sample types considered here are less than the 1. 0 nT resolution of standard databases.

40|$|By {{the use of}} two {{separate}} mesh sizes instead of OIICL irl+cornputirlg finite differences, an extrapolation to effective “zero ” mesh size may be made {{in order to reduce}} the truncation error, as originally suggesttd by Richardson. This technique of “difference extrapolation ” is applied to the? estimation of individual differentials in the barotropic vorticity equation, and here corresponds to the use of “sccorld-order ” finite differences. The truncation-induced phase speed lag of the difference solution relative to the true solution is shown to be systematically reduced, especially for the shorter waves. Next, the cxtrapolation is applied with {{two separate}} solutions of the barotropic difference equation, with the result that the phase speeds are further improved, at but the expense of an <b>amplitude</b> <b>distortion</b> of about 10 percent.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{wavefront}} distortions induced by acoustic heterogeneities in breast thermoacoustic tomography (TAT) are studied. <b>Amplitude</b> <b>distortions</b> are {{shown to be}} insignificant for different scales of acoustic heterogeneities. For wavelength-scale, or smaller, heterogeneities, <b>amplitude</b> <b>distortion</b> of the wavefront is minor {{as a result of}} diffraction when the detectors are placed in the far field of the heterogeneities. For larger-scale heterogeneities at the parenchyma wall, by using a ray approach (geometric optics), we show that no refraction-induced multipath interference occurs and, consequently, that no severe <b>amplitude</b> <b>distortion,</b> such as is found in ultrasound tomography, exists. Next, we consider the effects of phase distortions (errors in time-of-flight) in our numerical studies. The numerical results on the spreads of point sources and boundaries caused by the phase distortions are in good agreement with the proposed formula. After that, we demonstrate that the blurring of images can be compensated for by using the distribution of acoustic velocity in the tissues in the reconstructions. The effects of the errors in the acoustical velocities on this compensation also are investigated. An approach to implement the compensation using only TAT data is proposed. Lastly, the differences in the effects of acoustic heterogeneity and the generation of speckles in breast TAT and breast ultrasound imaging are discussed...|$|R

The distortion filter is modeled as a linear {{function of the}} frequency with unknown slope. We present a novel slope estimator, analytically derived by exploiting the spectral properties of the distorted signal, which results to be unbiased and does not exhibit false locks in the scenarios of practical interest. Since an ideal slope compensator would require an unmanageable filtering, we focus on a low-complexity compensation filter that ensures nearly the same performance. Extensive simulation results prove the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed solution, which can also work blindly at very low values of the signal-to-noise ratio.

This paper presents an analysis of the spectral efficiency of single-carrier and OFDM transmission in massive MIMO systems that use one-bit ADCs. A closed-form achievable rate, i. e., a lower bound on capacity, is derived for a wideband system with a large number of channel taps that employs low-complexity linear channel estimation and symbol detection. Quantization results in two types of error in the symbol detection. The circularly symmetric error becomes Gaussian in massive MIMO and vanishes as the number of antennas grows. The <b>amplitude</b> <b>distortion,</b> which severely degrades the performance of OFDM, is caused by variations between symbol durations in received interference energy. As the number of channel taps grows, the <b>amplitude</b> <b>distortion</b> vanishes and OFDM has the same performance as single-carrier transmission.

Thus by choosing the step size as a function of transition width and varying the step size from coarser to finer level, the minimum <b>amplitude</b> <b>distortion</b> and aliasing error can be definitely achieved.
