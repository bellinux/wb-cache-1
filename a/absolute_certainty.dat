5|$|Final Damnation: Finally, {{those who}} persist in {{living in a}} state of mortal sin and do not repent before death subject {{themselves}} to hell, an everlasting separation from God. The Church teaches that no one is condemned to hell without having freely decided to reject God. No one is predestined to hell and no one can determine with <b>absolute</b> <b>certainty</b> who has been condemned to hell. Catholicism teaches that through God's mercy a person can repent at any point before death, be illuminated with the truth of the Catholic faith, and thus obtain salvation. Some Catholic theologians have speculated that the souls of unbaptised infants and non-Christians without mortal sin but who die in original sin are assigned to limbo, although this is not an official dogma of the Church.|$|E

Smith rejects agnosticism as a third alternative to theism and atheism and promotes terms such as agnostic atheism (the view {{of those who do}} not believe in the existence of any deity, but do not claim to know if a deity does or does not exist) and agnostic theism (the view of those who do not claim to know of the existence of any deity, but still believe in such an existence).|$|E

This form of consensus was technically defined as agreement of all competent jurists in any particular generation, acting as representatives of the community. However, the practical difficulty of obtaining and ascertaining such an agreement meant that it had little impact on legal development. A more pragmatic form of consensus, which could be determined by consulting works of prominent jurists, was used to confirm a ruling so that it could not be reopened for further discussion. The cases for which there was a consensus account for less than 1 percent of the body of classical jurisprudence.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to review Hume’s {{criticism of the}} traditional confrontation between reason and passion. Against the model of a geometrical reason, Hume suggests another possible source of certainty which is capable of overcoming the «miseries » —limits and ideological excesses��� of that demonstrative and intuitive reason. There are no geometrical self-evidences in issues concerning facts and morality. Only a renewed and wider concept of rationality is valid when thinking about those issues. Besides mathematical reason and its <b>absolute</b> <b>certainties,</b> there would be another kind of equally valid, but much more useful certainty, that Hume discovers as rooted in the sentimental dimension of human beings. Thus, he reveals «the other of reason» inside reason itself, foreseeing important ideas of contemporary authors, who are critical with {{the excesses of the}} modern «charismatic reason». Este artículo pretende mostrar la crítica de Hume a la tradicional oposición entre razón y pasión. Frente al modelo de razón geométrica y de metafísica esencialista de cuna platónico-pitagórica, Hume apuesta por otra fuente de certezas «a la medida de lo humano », capaz de superar las «miserias» —limitaciones y excesos ideológicos— de esa razón demostrativa e intuitiva. En las cuestiones de hecho y en la moral no hay autoevidencias geométricas. Sólo un nuevo y más amplio modelo de racionalidad será válido para reflexionar sobre esas cuestiones. Junto a la razón matemática y sus certezas plenas, habría otra forma de certeza igualmente válida, pero mucho más útil, que Hume descubre arraigada en la dimensión pasional humana. Alumbra así «lo otro de la razón» en el interior de la misma, anticipando importantes ideas de autores contemporáneos críticos de la «razón carismática» moderna...|$|R
40|$|Muscoloskeletal pain is {{the gold}} {{standard}} in “commercial” pharmacological treatment. Physical activity is supposed to decrease pain perception, with other specific benefits. In scientific literature, the term “analgesia post exercise” is very common since the early 80 ’s. However, there are no <b>absolute</b> <b>certainties</b> about the true effects of exercise in pain treatment after recovery. Our work wants to examine this topic, and will try to understand how healty volunteers respond to a noxious stimulus after exercise and after recovery from exercise of various intensity and duration. We evaluated the responses to two types of exercise: a) strong and short exercise, and b) medium and very long exercise. The {{first part of the}} study analyses a group of 30 athletes: 15 cyclists and 15 volunteers coming from other sports: we evaluated pain perception and tolerance thresholds with two different kind of noxious stimuli. In the second part we evaluated pain perception and tolerance in a group of 27 ultratrailers, before, after and after 15 min recovery from a running race of 80 km and 5. 500 m of positive slope. Results of the first two experimets, show a return to basal values after recovery for cyclists group and for the control group we notice the tendence to an hyperalgesia post-recovery. Both groups, immediately after having finished the test, show an analgesic response to pain test. Third test gave us a yperalgesic response in both after and after recovery test.

25|$|Megalosauridae {{was first}} phylogenetically defined in 1869 by Thomas Huxley, yet {{was used as}} a ‘waste-basket’ clade for many years. In 2002, Ronan Allain redefined the clade after he {{discovered}} a complete megalosaurid skull in northwestern France of species Poekilopleuron. Using the characters described in this study, Allain defined Megalosauridae as dinosaurs including Poekilopleuron valesdunesis, now known as Dubreuillosaurus, Torvosaurus, Afrovenator, and all descendants of their common ancestor. Allain also defined two taxa within Megalosauridae: Torvosaurinae was defined as all Megalosauridae more closely related to Torvosaurus than to Poekilopleuron and Afrovenator, and Megalosaurinae was defined as all those that are more closely related to Poekilopleuron. Megalosauridae also falls under the basal clade Megalosauroidea, which also contains Spinosauridae. However, many taxa are still quite unstable and cannot be placed in one clade with <b>absolute</b> <b>certainty.</b> For example, Eustreptospondylus and Streptospondylus, while they are both defined as Megalosauridae, are often excluded to make more stable cladograms since they are not defined to a certain subgroup.|$|E
