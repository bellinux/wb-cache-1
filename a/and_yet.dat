5|$|<b>And</b> <b>Yet</b> It Moves is a {{platform}} video game developed by independent developer Broken Rules. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux on April 2, 2009, and a Wii port {{was released on}} the Wii Shop Channel in August 2010. <b>And</b> <b>Yet</b> It Moves was originally designed as a computer science project at the Vienna University of Technology in 2007. When the original prototype won or was nominated for awards at various independent game festivals, the team decided to create a full version of the game.|$|E

5|$|<b>And</b> <b>Yet</b> It Moves {{focuses on}} moving the player {{character}} {{through a series}} of hazardous environments. The player possesses the ability to freely rotate the entire game world, transforming walls into floors and vice versa. The game's levels and puzzles are designed around this concept. The game features paper collage styled visuals designed by Jan Hackl and a beatboxing soundtrack performed by Christoph Binder.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of their}} human qualities, we never entirely lose sympathy with Macbeth and Lady Macbeth, and our {{imagination}} participates with theirs in the tragedy. Their imagination makes the two more human <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> also destroys them. As Kinnaird points out (elaborating on {{an idea of}} Joseph W. Donohue, Jr.), Hazlitt in part sees Macbeth as a tragedy of imagination itself.|$|E
5|$|Both the PC and WiiWare {{versions}} of the game received positive reviews, with many critics applauding the gameplay mechanics and the visuals. <b>And</b> <b>Yet</b> It Moves was also released {{as part of the}} third Humble Indie Bundle.|$|E
5|$|Broken Rules {{currently}} {{has no plans}} to develop a sequel to <b>And</b> <b>Yet</b> It Moves, due to the time spent on the game. Bohatsch commented that he is unopposed to the idea and is amenable to proposals to develop such a game.|$|E

5|$|His {{more famous}} <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> {{controversial}} brother, Juan, {{who had been}} pardoned by the Spanish Queen Regent Maria Christina of Austria herself, left for Spain to use his influence to intercede for Antonio in August 1897. Soon enough, Antonio's case was dismissed by the Military Supreme Court and he was released.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} two {{chapters}} he describes the atrocious conditions he witnessed in China. Shanghai is depicted as a squalid, noisy, and polluted den of crime, poverty, and disease, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> still comparatively wealthy compared {{to the rest of}} the country. The interior of the country is difficult to access due to lack of infrastructure, is mostly unsafe for travel, and is wracked constantly by famine and starvation.|$|E
5|$|Levels {{consist of}} several missions, {{which are based}} around the {{destruction}} of enemy weapons and installations, as well as rescuing hostages or prisoners of war, or capturing enemy personnel. The helicopter is armed with machine guns, more powerful Hydra rockets <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> more deadly Hellfire missiles. The more powerful the weapon, the fewer can be carried: the player must choose an appropriate weapon for each situation. Enemy weapons range from armoured cars to artillery and tanks.|$|E

5|$|One {{radio program}} episode used Christmas clubs as a background. The December 23, 1949 episode of Life of Riley saw the show's protagonist Chester Riley {{attempting}} to withdraw his US$2 Christmas club money but discovering his account has accumulated {{a variety of}} fees including one for the passbook, another for early withdrawal, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> another for the bank's mailed reminders. The luckless Riley owes the bank 25 cents.|$|E
5|$|Rankings tend to {{concentrate}} on representing MBA schools themselves, but some schools offer MBA programs of different qualities <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> the ranking will only rely upon information from the full-time program (e.g., a school may use highly reputable faculty to teach a daytime program, but use adjunct faculty in its evening program or have drastically lower admissions criteria for its evening program than for its daytime program).|$|E
5|$|Richardson's Pamela, the {{prototype}} for the sentimental novel, is a didactic love {{story with a}} happy ending, written at a time women were beginning {{to have the right}} to choose husbands <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> were restricted by social conventions. Austen attempted Richardson's epistolary style, but found the flexibility of narrative more conducive to her realism, a realism in which each conversation and gesture carries a weight of significance. The narrative style utilises free indirect speech – she was the first English novelist to do so extensively – through which she had the ability to present a character's thoughts directly to the reader <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> still retain narrative control. The style allows an author to vary discourse between the narrator's voice and values and those of the characters.|$|E

5|$|The Upanishad's {{structure}} is notable as it embeds key parts of verses from early Principal Upanishads, thus referencing them <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> building its own message. The fragments of earlier major Upanishads it thus integrates within it, include Mundaka Upanishad and Shvetashvatara Upanishad.|$|E
5|$|The {{culture of}} Darjeeling is diverse and {{includes}} a variety of indigenous practices and festivals as mentioned above. Many of the Nepali Hindus, {{as well as the}} various Buddhist and other ethnic groups such as the Lepchas, Bhutias, Kiranti Limbus, Tibetans, Yolmos, Gurungs and Tamangs, have their own distinct languages and cultures <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> share a largely harmonious co-existence.|$|E
