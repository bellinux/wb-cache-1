Three seasonal items and a gluten-free fusilli were added in April 2013.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} at least 11 {{documented}} cases of blue whale-fin whale hybrid adults in the wild. Arnason and Gullberg describe the genetic distance between a blue and a fin as about the same as that between a human and a gorilla.

5|$|Baker's yeast or Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a {{unicellular}} fungus, {{is used to}} make {{bread and}} other wheat-based products, such as pizza dough and dumplings. Yeast species of the genus Saccharomyces are also used to produce alcoholic beverages through fermentation. Shoyu koji mold (Aspergillus oryzae) is an essential ingredient in brewing Shoyu (soy sauce) and sake, and the preparation of miso, while Rhizopus species are used for making tempeh. Several of these fungi are domesticated species that were bred or selected according to their capacity to ferment food without producing harmful mycotoxins (see below), which are produced by very closely related Aspergilli. Quorn, <b>a</b> <b>meat</b> substitute, is made from Fusarium venenatum.|$|E
5|$|Many Jews observe kashrut partially, by abstaining from pork or shellfish, or by not {{drinking}} milk with <b>a</b> <b>meat</b> dish. Some keep kosher at home but will eat in a non-kosher restaurant. In 2012, one {{analysis of the}} specialty food market in North America estimated that only 15% of Kosher consumers were Jewish. A sizable non-Jewish {{segment of the population}} views kosher certification as an indication of wholesomeness. Muslims, Hindus, and people with allergies to dairy foods often consider the kosher-pareve designation as an assurance that a food contains no animal-derived ingredients, including milk and all of its derivatives. However, since kosher-pareve foods may contain honey, eggs, or fish, strict vegetarians cannot rely on the certification.|$|E
50|$|Due to the scarceness of {{meat in the}} past, the hot pot was {{traditionally}} only {{prepared for}} festive occasions. <b>As</b> <b>meat</b> became more readily available during the 20th century, the dish became a common, everyday food throughout Finland.|$|R
500|$|Arbogast & Bastian (also <b>A</b> <b>Meats)</b> was {{the name}} of <b>a</b> {{slaughterhouse}} and <b>meat</b> packing plant located in Allentown, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, in the United States. [...] Once a national leader in hog slaughtering, the company had the capacity to process most of the 850,000 hogs raised annually in Pennsylvania for slaughtering. [...] In its heyday, Arbogast & Bastian [...] slaughtered an average of 4,000 hogs daily.|$|R

The family moved in 1897 to Waco and in 1901 to Fort Worth. McMillin's father was <b>a</b> <b>meat</b> packer. As a child, Bo was known to pick fights, but was also known all his life as one who never drunk nor smoked nor swore. He spoke with a {{distinctive}} Texas drawl.|$|E
5|$|Meat ants {{engage in}} ritualised fights to {{maintain}} and resolve boundary disputes with neighbouring colonies. When individuals from separate colonies meet, they will engage each other until appeasement occurs. <b>A</b> <b>meat</b> ant detects a foreign worker by intense antennation and gaping of the mandibles, and will also stretch themselves upward to appear taller and larger, suggesting that meat ants {{do this in a}} display of size matching. Once the ants have finished fighting, they will groom themselves and search for another ant. Such disputes between colonies may continue for months or even years in the same area, and escalated fights that result in serious injury or death are rare.|$|E
5|$|Omak is {{a planned}} city. Throughout the 20th century, Ross {{designed}} {{what would become}} the city of Omak. Within a year of its establishment, the town had a central business district with a public bank and hotel supported by the local agricultural industry. The town was provided with a post office, previously known as Epley. Ross founded Omak School District in 1906; soon after this its first school, Omak Schoolhouse, was built. In 1910, <b>a</b> <b>meat</b> market, hardware shop, law office, stationery and confectionery store were constructed in Downtown Omak. A steel bridge built the following year collapsed into the Okanogan River upon initial use. It was quickly rebuilt with no further problems.|$|E
5000|$|Tofu, <b>a</b> popular <b>meat</b> analogue, {{was invented}} in the Han dynasty. A {{document}} written by Tao Gu (903-970) describes how tofu was called [...] "small mutton" [...] and valued as <b>an</b> imitation <b>meat.</b> Meat analogues such as tofu and wheat gluten are associated with Buddhist cuisine in China {{and other parts of}} East Asia. In Medieval Europe, meat analogues were popular during Lent, when the consumption of meat from warm-blooded animals is forbidden.Meat analogue may also refer to a meat-based and/or less-expensive alternative to <b>a</b> particular <b>meat</b> product, such as surimi.|$|R

5|$|On 10 March 1914, the suffragette Mary Richardson {{walked into}} the National Gallery and {{attacked}} Velázquez's canvas with <b>a</b> <b>meat</b> cleaver. Her action was ostensibly provoked by the arrest of fellow suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst the previous day, although there had been earlier warnings of a planned suffragette attack on the collection. Richardson left seven slashes on the painting, particularly causing damage to the area between the figure's shoulders. However, all were successfully repaired by the National Gallery's chief restorer Helmut Ruhemann.|$|E
5|$|Some {{processes}} convert <b>a</b> <b>meat</b> or {{dairy product}} into a pareve (neither meat nor dairy) one. For example, rennet is sometimes made from stomach linings, yet is acceptable for making kosher cheese, but such cheeses {{might not be}} acceptable to some vegetarians, who would eat only cheese made from a vegetarian rennet. The same applies to kosher gelatin, an animal product, derived from kosher animal sources. Other gelatin-like products from non-animal sources such as agar agar and carrageenan are pareve by nature. Fish gelatin is derived from fish and is therefore (like all kosher fish products) pareve. Eggs are also considered pareve despite being an animal product.|$|E
5|$|Borgsen {{contacts}} Black again, confessing {{that his}} latest killing has not satisfied him. Black warns that his urges will only grow, {{and will never}} be satisfied again. When Borgsen hangs up, Black deduces that Vaughan {{is to be the}} next victim. Black, fellow Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) and Sheriff Falkner (John Dennis Johnston) track the kidnapped Vaughan to an equine slaughterhouse. Falkner is attacked and incapacitated by Borgsen as Black locates a still-living Vaughan, who has been hung by her jacket from <b>a</b> <b>meat</b> hook. Black is then confronted by Borgsen, who knocks him down with the cattle prod. Borgsen is about to kill Black with a captive bolt pistol, but is trampled to death by several escaped horses.|$|E

5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Indianapolis, Indiana, Vonnegut {{attended}} Cornell University, but dropped out in January 1943 and enlisted in the United States Army. As part of his training, he studied mechanical engineering at Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) and the University of Tennessee. He was then deployed to Europe to fight in World War II, and was captured by the Germans during the Battle of the Bulge. He was interned in Dresden and survived the Allied bombing of the city by taking refuge in <b>a</b> <b>meat</b> locker of the slaughterhouse where he was imprisoned. After the war, Vonnegut married Jane Marie Cox, {{with whom he had}} three children. He later adopted his sister's three sons, after she died of cancer and her husband died in a train accident.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} common {{constituents}} of a medieval meal, either as part of a banquet or as a small snack, were sops, pieces of bread with which a liquid like wine, soup, broth, or sauce could be soaked up and eaten. Another common sight at the medieval dinner table was the frumenty, a thick wheat porridge often boiled in <b>a</b> <b>meat</b> broth and seasoned with spices. Porridges were also made of every type of grain and could be served as desserts or dishes for the sick, if boiled in milk (or almond milk) and sweetened with sugar. Pies filled with meats, eggs, vegetables, or fruit were common throughout Europe, as were turnovers, fritters, doughnuts, and many similar pastries. By the Late Middle Ages biscuits (cookies in the U.S.) and especially wafers, eaten for dessert, had become high-prestige foods and came in many varieties. Grain, either as bread crumbs or flour, was also the most common thickener of soups and stews, alone or in combination with almond milk.|$|E
5|$|Paul Walsh {{was born}} to Don and June Walsh in Plumstead on 1 October 1962; {{his father was a}}n {{electrician}} and his mother worked at Tate & Lyle. He grew up supporting Arsenal, though his father was a season-ticket holder at West Ham United. Despite his natural skill, his small stature meant he was frequently overlooked at junior football. He was spotted playing for local youth side Londinium by Charlton Athletic scout Jim Fibbins, and signed schoolboy forms aged 14. In a 1986 interview with Shoot magazine Walsh cited Londinium manager John O' Connor as the biggest influence on his career. After leaving school he also began working part-time at <b>a</b> <b>meat</b> factory and later a fruit packing factory before he joined Charlton on a full-time basis.|$|E
