40|$|Cosmetic {{embellishment}} of fingernails {{involves the}} use of substance that harden either after the evaporation of solvents (varnishes) or after polymerisation (<b>artificial</b> acrylic <b>nails,</b> gel tips, glue-on <b>artificial</b> <b>nails).</b> Pathological reactions to cosmetics usually occur at a remote site for varnishes, and, most commonly, in situ with polymerising substances. Unvarnished <b>artificial</b> <b>nails</b> do not affect pulse oximetry readings, and in theory, patients are not required to remove them. However, a real problem of contamination via <b>artificial</b> <b>nails</b> exists. Increased carriage of pathological Gram-negative organisms and of Staphylococcus aureus and yeasts has been noted among nursing staff wearing <b>artificial</b> <b>nails,</b> both before and after fingernail cleaning. Fingernail fragility manifests itself through a number of different physical signs such as soft, breaking nails, with longitudinal or transverse fissures, showing distal doubling or friability. In some subjects, excessive manicuring with metal instruments or manicure sticks results in rolled onycholysis, of evocative appearance, or transverse onycholysis.

5000|$|... "The {{earliest}} {{experiments and}} resultant artificial nails used a monomer and polymer mix applied o the nail and extended over a supporting form.

5000|$|The {{artificial}} nails {{are not a}} replacement, but {{an extension}} for natural nails. There are two main approaches to creating artificial nails—tips and forms. Tips are made of lightweight plastic plates that are [...] "nail"-shaped. They are glued {{on the end of}} the natural nail. Then you have the choice to choose acrylic or gel powder to cover the nail. When you have chosen acrylic, gel or a combination of both is then applied over the entire nail. Tips are available in many different colors and designs. Some of the options ranging from simple colors such as yellow or blue to flamboyant designs such as animal prints and mixed metallic colors. When you get acrylic nails, forms are fitted over the nail and then an <b>artificial</b> <b>nail</b> is sculpted out of the acrylic, then properly shaped and buffed to a shine.|$|E

40|$|HISTORY AND CLINICAL FINDINGS: Case 1. A 34 -year-old woman {{presented}} with a recurrent, itching and erythematous plaque on her right cheek. Case 2. A 27 -year-old woman reported itching erythema on her fingertips {{from time to time}} recently. Inspection revealed dyshidrosiform blisters. Both patients had been using nail varnish and varnish remover. Case 3. A 49 -year-old woman had, for about 5 years, repeatedly experienced itching erythema at the perionychium of several fingers on which she had placed <b>artificial</b> <b>nails.</b> Marked oedema and erythema was noted. INVESTIGATION: Extensive epicutaneous tests were performed on these patients. They showed sensitisation against important allergens in nail varnish (toluolsulphonamide-formaldehyde resin), nail varnish remover (benzophenone- 2) and <b>artificial</b> <b>nails</b> (ethylacrylate), respectively. The three patients also showed type IV sensitisation against other substances. DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT AND COURSE: Epicutaneous tests documented type IV allergies to important constituents of nail varnish, nail varnish remover and <b>artificial</b> <b>nails.</b> Symptoms and skin changes disappeared when these three items were no longer used. CONCLUSION: Allergies against nail varnish and its remover and against <b>artificial</b> <b>nails</b> {{should be included in the}} differential diagnosis of skin allergies, even when patients have additional type IV sensitizations against common allergens. As the causative allergen can be easily avoided, knowledge of the particular problems associated with these allergies is of a great practical significance...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Background. Allergic contact {{dermatitis}} due to acrylates {{present in the}} workplace is a disease frequently reported among dentists, printers, and fiberglass workers. Recently, {{the number of cases}} of contact allergic dermatitis among beauticians specialized in sculpting <b>artificial</b> <b>nails</b> has increased. Objective. Our objective was to study the clinical characteristics and allergens implicated in allergic {{contact dermatitis}} due to acrylates in beauticians and users of sculpted nails. Material and methods. This was an observational, retrospective study of patients diagnosed with allergic contact dermatitis due to acrylates used in sculpting <b>artificial</b> <b>nails</b> over the last 26 years in the Hospital General Universitario, Valencia, Spain. Results. In total, 15 patients were diagnosed: 14 beauticians and 1 client. Most cases were diagnosed in the past 2 years. All were women, their mean age was 32. 2 years, and 26. 7 % had a personal or family history of atopy. The sensitization time varied between 1 month and 15 years. The most frequently affected areas were the fleshy parts of the fingers and hands. Three patients — 2 beauticians and 1 client — presented allergic asthma due to acrylates. All patients underwent patch testing with a standard battery of allergens and a battery of acrylates. The most frequent allergens were ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (13 / 15, 86. 7 %), hydroxyethyl methacrylate (13 / 15, 86. 7 %), triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (7 / 15, 46. 7 %), 2 -hydroxypropyl methacrylate (5 / 15, 33. 3 %), and methyl methacrylate (5 / 15, 33. 3 %). Conclusions. Acrylate monomers used for sculpting <b>artificial</b> <b>nails</b> are important sensitizers for contact and occupational dermatitis. The most important consideration is primary and secondary prevention...|$|R
50|$|When <b>artificial</b> <b>nails</b> {{are applied}} to the natural nail surface, minor types of trauma to the <b>artificial</b> <b>nails</b> which can happen from {{something}} as harmless as scraping a nail against a firm surface can cause separation of the nail from its nail bed. This allows bacteria and fungus to potentially enter the separated area setting up an infection. In fact, some hospitals won't allow their employees to have fake fingernails due {{to the risk of}} harboring infection which could be transmitted to patients. Several deaths of premature infants were blamed on an acrylic nail infection transmitted to the babies by a nurse in the late 1990s. Epidemiologists who have studied the outbreak of the bacterial infection at a children's hospital in Oklahoma City, found that half of the sixteen deaths from January 1, 1997 to March 12, 1998, were due to the contamination from the long fingernails. Infection can also be a risk when you have nails applied by a disreputable nail salon that doesn't follow sanitary practices.|$|R

50|$|French manicures can be {{made with}} <b>artificial</b> <b>nails,</b> which are {{designed}} to resemble natural ones and are characterized by lack of base color, or natural pink base nails with white tips.

Another technique is to whiten the underside of the nail with white pencil and paint a sheer color over the entire nail.|$|R
25|$|First {{one should}} rinse hands with warm water, keeping hands below wrists and forearms, to prevent {{contaminated}} water from {{moving from the}} hands to the wrists and arms. The warm water helps to open pores, which helps with the removal of microorganisms, without removing skin oils.

The most commonly missed areas are the thumb, the wrist, the areas between the fingers, and under fingernails. <b>Artificial</b> <b>nails</b> and chipped nail polish harbor microorganisms.|$|R
