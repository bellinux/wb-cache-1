He was {{motivated}} by his loyalty to Hitler and <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> useful to him; he did not seek power or prestige or take advantage of his position to accumulate personal wealth. He lived in a modest house in Munich. Although Hess had less influence than other top NSDAP officials, he was popular with the masses. After the Invasion of Poland {{and the start of}} World War II in September 1939, Hitler made Hess second in line to succeed him, after Hermann Göring.

25|$|He {{was known}} for his {{determination}} to achieve goals that were seemingly beyond his reach. As a child, he wanted to join the baseball team that would win the Utah territorial championship, but others believed him to be too physically awkward to be successful. In response, he purchased a baseball and practiced throwing the ball for hours against his barn to improve. The team he joined later won the championship.

He practiced his writing to the point that he was invited to teach penmanship at one of the local academies.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{near the}} sacred has {{influenced}} Mesoamerican settlement. Mountains and caves were important elements in Mesoamerican creation myths. Mesoamerican belief systems liken water to fertility and mountains give flowing water and rainfall through caves. Accordingly, these natural features were considered sacred and were sought out by Mesoamerican migrants {{looking for a}} new home. A cave could be considered an axis mundi if it marked the center of a village (Brady and Ashmore 1999: 127). The Late Postclassic site of Mayapan incorporated several cenotes into its ceremonial groups and the Cenote Ch’en Mul is at the site core. At Dos Pilas house platforms were often in front of cave entries and the tunnel went beneath the platform.|$|E

25|$|The show often {{includes}} strong, brassy, long-suffering {{women who}} exhibit diva-like behaviour and stoically battle through {{an array of}} tragedy and misfortune. Such characters include Angie Watts, Kathy Beale, Sharon Watts, Pat Butcher, Denise Fox and Tanya Branning. Conversely there are female characters who handle tragedy less well, depicted as eternal victims and endless sufferers, who include Sue Osman, Little Mo Mitchell, Laura Beale, Lisa Fowler, Ronnie Mitchell and Linda Carter. The 'tart with a heart' is another recurring character, often popular with viewers. Often their promiscuity masks a hidden vulnerability and <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> loved. Such characters have included Pat Butcher (though in her latter years, this changed), Tiffany Mitchell, Kat Slater, Stacey Slater, Dawn Swann and Roxy Mitchell.|$|E
25|$|The United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) was a {{peacekeeping}} mission {{established in the}} early 1990s following the civil war which broke out in Cambodia {{after the collapse of}} the Khmer Rouge regime in 1979. The Australian government had closely followed events in Cambodia given the possible implications for regional security, while out of <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen as a good international citizen it had also invested heavily diplomatically in order to push the parties towards a peace agreement. In August 1989 the UN attempted to broker a peace agreement between the warring factions, and included amongst the reconnaissance party were two Australian officers tasked with laying the groundwork for a monitoring force should it be deployed. However, {{after the collapse of the}} peace effort the proposed UN force was cancelled and the reconnaissance team withdrawn.|$|E
25|$|In early 1999, {{the team}} was broken up, and Kukoč {{was one of the}} only players from their {{championship}} years that the Bulls retained. In the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season, he led the team in scoring, rebounding, and assists. During the 1999–2000 season as Chicago continued their rebuilding scheme, Kukoč was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers for whom he played briefly before he was soon traded again to the Atlanta Hawks. After a short stint with the Hawks, he finally found himself in a more suitable fit with the Milwaukee Bucks via a third trade. On September 12, 2006, Kukoč announced that he would retire from professional basketball if he could not be signed by either the Milwaukee Bucks or the Chicago Bulls for the 2006–07 NBA season.
