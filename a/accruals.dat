Results for the food supply chain are different from results by Sloan and others. In particular, results for high <b>accrual</b> agribusiness are similar to results by Sloan for the complete U.

40|$|Objective: To {{develop a}} {{systematic}} statistical approach to estimate <b>accrual</b> closure date in large scale multi-center clinical trials or large public health studies. It {{is relevant to}} the research in public health. Background: In a typical multi-center cancer clinical trial or large public health study, sample size is predetermined to achieve desired power and study participants are enrolled from hundreds of satellite sites. As the <b>accrual</b> is closing to the target size, the coordinating data center needs to project an <b>accrual</b> closure date based on observed <b>accrual</b> pattern and notify participating sites several weeks in advance. In the past, projections were simply based on some crude assessment and conservative measures were incorporated {{in order to achieve}} the target <b>accrual</b> size. The resulted excessive <b>accrual</b> size usually leads to unnecessary budget increase considering that the coordinating center needs to pay thousands of dollars for each accrued participant. Method: For multi-center clinical trials, there is very small probability for a site to accrue a patient during a short period and mostly the <b>accrual</b> from different sites is mostly independent from each other. Therefore, the overall <b>accrual</b> could be modeled by a Poisson process. Based on <b>accrual</b> data collected up to a time point, a Poisson process-based method was used to analyze the past <b>accrual</b> pattern. Combining with assumption on the future accruing pattern, two methods were proposed here to predict the <b>accrual</b> closure date. The estimates and their confidence intervals were used to guide clinical practice. The proposed methods were illustrated through analysis of <b>accrual</b> data from NSABP trials B- 38 and C- 08...|$|R

To measure the idiosyncratic risk in this study five factors of Fama-French Model were used (Fama and French 2014).
