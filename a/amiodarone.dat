5|$|Doxorubicin {{and several}} {{chemotherapeutic}} drugs (including cyclophosphamide) cause dyspigmentation. Other groups {{of drugs that}} cause this problem include antimalarials, <b>amiodarone,</b> heavy metals (but not iron), tetracyclines, and antipsychotics.|$|E
5|$|An {{underactive thyroid}} gland results in hypothyroidism. Typical {{symptoms}} are abnormal weight gain, tiredness, constipation, heavy menstrual bleeding, hair loss, cold intolerance, and a slow heart rate. Iodine deficiency {{is the most}} common cause of hypothyroidism worldwide, and the autoimmune disease Hashimoto's thyroiditis {{is the most common}} cause in the developed world. Other causes include congenital abnormalities, diseases causing transient inflammation, surgical removal or radioablation of the thyroid, the drugs <b>amiodarone</b> and lithium, amyloidosis, and sarcoidosis. Some forms of hypothyroidism can result in myxedema and severe cases can result in myxedema coma.|$|E
5|$|Excessive {{production}} of the thyroid hormones is called hyperthyroidism, which is most commonly a result of Graves' disease, a toxic multinodular goitre, a solitary thyroid adenoma, or inflammation. Other causes include drug-induced excess of iodine, particularly from <b>amiodarone,</b> an antiarrhythmic medication; an excess caused by the preferential uptake of iodine by the thyroid following iodinated contrast imaging; or from pituitary adenomas which may cause an over{{production of}} thyroid stimulating hormone. Hyperthyroidism often causes a variety of non-specific symptoms including weight loss, increased appetite, insomnia, decreased tolerance of heat, tremor, palpitations, anxiety and nervousness. In some cases it can cause chest pain, diarrhoea, hair loss and muscle weakness. Such symptoms may be managed temporarily with drugs such as beta blockers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the chronic}} stage, {{treatment}} involves managing the clinical {{manifestations of the}} disease. For example, pacemakers and medications for irregular heartbeats, such as the anti-arrhythmia drug <b>amiodarone,</b> may be life saving for some patients with chronic cardiac disease, while surgery may be required for megaintestine. The disease cannot be cured in this phase, however. Chronic heart disease caused by Chagas disease is now a common reason for heart transplantation surgery. Until recently, however, Chagas disease was considered a contraindication for the procedure, since the heart damage could recur as the parasite was expected to seize the opportunity provided by the immunosuppression that follows surgery.|$|E
5|$|For {{diseases}} of the heart rate or rhythm, {{a number of different}} antiarrhythmic agents are used. These may interfere with electrolyte channels and thus the cardiac action potential (such as calcium channel blockers, sodium channel blockers), interfere with stimulation of the heart by the sympathetic nervous system (beta blockers), or interfere with the movement of sodium and potassium across the cell membrane, such as digoxin. Other examples include atropine for slow rhythms, and <b>amiodarone</b> for irregular rhythms. Such medications are not the only way of treating {{diseases of}} heart rate or rhythm. In the context of a new-onset irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation), immediate electrical cardioversion may be attempted. For a slow heartbeat or heart block, a pacemaker or defibrillator may be inserted. The acuity of onset often affects how a rhythm disturbance is managed, as does whether a rhythm causes hemodynamic instability, such as low blood pressure or symptoms. An instigating cause is investigated for, such as a heart attack, medication, or metabolic problem.|$|E
5|$|In adults, {{widespread}} {{screening of}} the general population is a matter of debate. Some organizations (such as the United States Preventive Services Task Force) state that evidence is insufficient to support routine screening, while others (such as the American Thyroid Association) recommend either intermittent testing above a certain age in both sexes or only in women. Targeted screening may be appropriate in a number of situations where hypothyroidism is common: other autoimmune diseases, a strong family history of thyroid disease, those who have received radioiodine or other radiation therapy to the neck, those who have previously undergone thyroid surgery, those with an abnormal thyroid examination, those with psychiatric disorders, people taking <b>amiodarone</b> or lithium, and those with a number of health conditions (such as certain heart and skin conditions). Yearly thyroid function tests are recommended in people with Down syndrome, as they are at higher risk of thyroid disease.|$|E
25|$|<b>Amiodarone</b> has {{numerous}} side effects. Most individuals administered <b>amiodarone</b> on {{a chronic}} basis will experience {{at least one}} side effect.|$|E
25|$|<b>Amiodarone</b> is {{sometimes}} responsible for epididymitis, {{a condition of}} the epididymis, and is normally associated with bacterial infections but which can also occur as a non-bacterial inflammatory condition. <b>Amiodarone</b> accumulates in {{the head of the}} organ and can cause unilateral or bilateral inflammation. It tends to resolve if <b>amiodarone</b> is stopped.|$|E
25|$|Defibrillation is the {{treatment}} of choice for ventricular fibrillation (VF) and ventricular tachycardia resulting in cardiac arrest. However, <b>amiodarone</b> {{has been used in}} shock-refractory VF. The 2010 guidelines of the American Heart Association included <b>amiodarone</b> as a second line agent (after epinephrine or vasopressin). They believed that <b>amiodarone</b> was more effective than lidocaine in VF or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Amiodarone</b> may be {{an acronym}} for its IUPAC name (2-butyl-1-benzofuran-3-yl)-methanone, where ar is a {{placeholder}} for phenyl. This is partially supported by dronedarone which is noniodinated benzofuran derivative of <b>amiodarone,</b> where the arylmethanone is conserved.|$|E
25|$|<b>Amiodarone</b> is {{available}} in oral and intravenous formulations.|$|E
25|$|Loss of eyelashes {{has been}} linked to <b>amiodarone</b> use.|$|E
25|$|Low-dose <b>amiodarone</b> {{has been}} {{reported}} to cause pseudo-alcoholic cirrhosis.|$|E
25|$|Class III agents include: bretylium, <b>amiodarone,</b> ibutilide, sotalol, dofetilide, and dronedarone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Amiodarone</b> can worsen {{the cardiac}} {{arrhythmia}} {{brought on by}} digitalis toxicity.|$|E
25|$|Some {{cases of}} {{gynecomastia}} {{have been reported}} with men on <b>amiodarone.</b>|$|E
25|$|Long-term {{administration}} of <b>amiodarone</b> {{has been associated}} with peripheral neuropathies.|$|E
25|$|Diltiazem {{has been}} shown to be more {{effective}} than either digoxin or <b>amiodarone.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Amiodarone</b> slows {{conduction}} {{rate and}} prolongs the refractory {{period of the}} SA and AV nodes. It also prolongs the refractory periods of the ventricles, bundles of His, and the Purkinje fibres without exhibiting any effects on the conduction rate. <b>Amiodarone</b> {{has been shown to}} prolong the myocardial cell action potential duration and refractory period and is a non-competitive ÃŸ-adrenergic inhibitor.|$|E
25|$|People with atrial {{fibrillation}} and rapid ventricular response are often treated with <b>amiodarone</b> or procainamide to stabilize their heart rate. Procainamide and cardioversion are now accepted treatments for conversion of tachycardia found with WPW. <b>Amiodarone</b> was previously {{thought to be}} safe in {{atrial fibrillation}} with WPW, but after several cases of ventricular fibrillation, {{it is no longer}} recommended in this clinical scenario.|$|E
25|$|Chemical {{cardioversion}} {{is performed}} with drugs, such as <b>amiodarone,</b> dronedarone, procainamide, dofetilide, ibutilide, propafenone, or flecainide.|$|E
25|$|Individuals with {{baseline}} depressed {{lung function}} should be monitored closely if <b>amiodarone</b> therapy {{is to be}} initiated.|$|E
25|$|A 2016 review, however, {{found that}} <b>amiodarone</b> {{did not improve}} {{survival}} or positive outcomes in those who had a cardiac arrest.|$|E
25|$|The most {{specific}} test of pulmonary toxicity due to <b>amiodarone</b> is {{a dramatically}} decreased DLCO noted on pulmonary function testing.|$|E
25|$|As a {{doctoral}} candidate at Oxford University, Bramah Singh determined that <b>amiodarone</b> and sotalol had antiarrhythmic properties and {{belonged to a}} new class of antiarrhythmic agents (what would become the class III antiarrhythmic agents). Today the mechanisms of action of <b>amiodarone</b> and sotalol have been investigated in more detail. Both drugs have been demonstrated to prolong the duration of the action potential, prolonging the refractory period, by interacting among other cellular function with K+ channels.|$|E
25|$|In India, <b>amiodarone</b> is marketed(produced by Cipla Pharmaceutical) {{under the}} brand name Tachyra. It is also {{available}} in intravenous ampules and vials.|$|E
25|$|Abnormal liver enzyme {{results are}} common in {{patients}} on <b>amiodarone.</b> Much rarer are jaundice, hepatomegaly (liver enlargement), and hepatitis (inflammation of the liver).|$|E
25|$|A study {{published}} in 2013 showed a possible association between <b>amiodarone</b> and {{an increased risk of}} cancer, especially in males, with a dose-dependent effect.|$|E
25|$|<b>Amiodarone</b> {{chemically}} resembles thyroxine (thyroid hormone), and its binding to {{the nuclear}} thyroid receptor might contribute to some of its pharmacologic and toxic actions.|$|E
25|$|Hypothyroidism (slowing of the thyroid) occurs frequently; in the SAFE trial, which {{compared}} <b>amiodarone</b> {{with other}} medications {{for the treatment}} of atrial fibrillation, biochemical hypothyroidism (as defined by a TSH level of 4.5-10 mU/l) occurred in 25.8% of the amiodarone-treated group as opposed to 6.6% of the control group (taking placebo or sotalol). Overt hypothyroidism (defined as TSH >10 mU/l) occurred at 5.0% compared to 0.3%; most of these (>90%) were detected within {{the first six months of}} <b>amiodarone</b> treatment.|$|E
25|$|Further, {{vardenafil}} causes lengthening of the QT interval. Therefore, {{it should}} not be taken by people taking other medications that affect the QT interval (such as <b>amiodarone).</b>|$|E
25|$|Other {{drugs that}} prolong the QT {{interval}} such as quinidine, verapamil, <b>amiodarone,</b> sotalol and methadone may also interact with chlorpromazine to produce additive QT interval prolongation.|$|E
25|$|Interactions of {{potential}} clinical importance with cimetidine include warfarin, theophylline, phenytoin, carbamazepine, pethidine and other opioid analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine, terfenadine, <b>amiodarone,</b> flecainide, quinidine, fluorouracil, and benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} <b>amiodarone</b> on the {{warfarin}} concentrations {{can be as}} early as {{a few days after}} initiation of treatment; however, the interaction may not peak for up to seven weeks.|$|E
25|$|<b>Amiodarone</b> {{has been}} used both in the {{treatment}} of acute life-threatening arrhythmias as well as the chronic suppression of arrhythmias. It is used both in supraventricular arrhythmias and ventricular arrhythmias.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these agents, <b>amiodarone</b> has some AV node blocking effects (particularly when administered intravenously), {{and can be used}} in individuals when other agents are contraindicated or ineffective (particularly due to hypotension).|$|E
