5|$|The most {{difficult}} scene for Whedon to film was Willow panicking in her dormitory room. Her obsession {{about what to}} wear to visit Buffy was inspired by Whedon's own experiences {{when he was at}} a loss for what tie to wear for a friend's funeral. He praised Alyson Hannigan's acting, saying {{that she was able to}} be consistently emotional in every take <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> and the crew cry every time. Whedon acknowledged his difficulty speaking on the DVD commentary while watching Hannigan in the scene.|$|E
5|$|When {{this episode}} was being produced, The Bachelorette was a {{bigger and more}} {{prolific}} program than when this episode was originally broadcast. In addition, ABC was not doing very well {{at the time of}} this episode's production. The production staff encountered some trouble when deciding what Peter would be doing in the lobby with Cleveland during his Bachelorette audition; although the series could never come up with ideas they deemed to be suitable, they intended for Peter to put his buttocks in an aquarium tank in order to embarrass Cleveland <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> want to leave. This scene was not used, and the production staff used a scene of Peter putting his naked buttocks on Cleveland's naked buttocks; they also shortened this more detailed version and used the less-detailed current version.|$|E

After moving into secondary school, Ford met teacher David Benyon, who was a prominent figure in youth football {{in the area and}} included him in the Swansea boys team he managed. Ford was selected to represent Wales at under-14 level in a series of matches against the other home nations of Britain but suffered a broken ankle in a match for his school side just days before the first scheduled fixture against Scotland.

25|$|The series {{became an}} instant hit because, {{although}} a comedy, {{in the context of}} its time it did deal with aspects of working-class life comparatively realistically.

25|$|This twelve-day period used to {{be called}} the unbaptized days, during which the demonic forces of all kinds were {{considered}} to be more than usually active and dangerous. People were cautious not to attract their attention, and did not go out late at night.

When a karakondžula found someone outdoors during the night of an unbaptized day, it would jump on his back, <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> carry it wherever it wanted.
