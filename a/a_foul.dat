5|$|A {{minute later}} Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard was shown a yellow card for <b>a</b> <b>foul</b> on García. The {{resulting}} free-kick found Steven Gerrard, but {{he fell to}} the ground after a challenge from Claude Makélélé. The referee Steve Bennett ignored Liverpool claims for a penalty and Chelsea went straight on the attack, but an effort by Drogba went wide of the Liverpool goal. Chelsea continued to attack in an effort to score an equalising goal, but attempts by Duff and Joe Cole failed to find the target. Liverpool defender Djimi Traoré was the third player to be shown a yellow card for <b>a</b> <b>foul</b> on Ferreira in the 35th minute. However, minutes later he made an important tackle as Duff beat the Liverpool offside trap, but a poor touch outside of the Liverpool penalty area allowed Traoré to dispossess him. As half-time approached Liverpool were content to remain in their own half and allow Chelsea to attack them, but any attack was dealt with by the Liverpool defence.|$|E
50|$|Individual sports {{may have}} {{different}} types of fouls. For example, in basketball, <b>a</b> personal <b>foul</b> involves illegal personal contact with an opponent. <b>A</b> technical <b>foul</b> refers to unsportsmanlike non-contact behavior, a more serious infraction than <b>a</b> personal <b>foul.</b> <b>A</b> flagrant <b>foul</b> involves unsportsmanlike contact behavior, considered the most serious foul and often resulting in ejection from the game.|$|R

People exposed to small amounts of airborne tellurium exude <b>a</b> <b>foul</b> and persistent garlic-like odour. Tellurium dioxide {{has been used to}} treat seborrhoeic dermatitis; other tellurium compounds were used as antimicrobial agents before the development of antibiotics. In the future, such compounds may need to be substituted for antibiotics that have become ineffective due to bacterial resistance.|$|E
5|$|Leicester City {{started their}} cup run against Barnsley, but {{required}} a replay {{to overcome their}} Third Division opponents 2–1. The first Leicester goal was controversial, as the referee overruled his linesman, who had flagged for <b>a</b> <b>foul.</b> Barnsley equalised with a penalty, but Leicester quickly retook the lead. Later {{in the second half}} Leicester claimed a third goal, but the referee adjudged that the ball had not crossed the line. A 1–0 win at Millwall followed.|$|E
5|$|Meetings between Manchester United and Arsenal {{prior to}} this one were often eventful encounters. In Alex Ferguson's first match against Arsenal at Old Trafford in January 1987, his team prevailed with a 2–0 win to end the visitors' 22-match unbeaten run in all competitions. Arsenal's David Rocastle was sent off in the match for <b>a</b> <b>foul</b> on Norman Whiteside, {{which led to a}} {{confrontation}} between his teammates and the United coaching staff.|$|E

5|$|Nedvěd played UEFA Champions League {{football}} with Lazio, scoring against Real Madrid in a 2–2 draw in {{the second}} group stage before the Italian side was eliminated. In Lazio's final Champions League match of the season, Nedvěd was criticised by Leeds United manager David O'Leary for a challenge on Alan Maybury (although the referee did not call <b>a</b> <b>foul),</b> and he received a three-match suspension from European competition from UEFA.|$|E
5|$|A few {{vertebrate}} {{species such}} as the Texas horned lizard are able to shoot squirts of blood from their eyes, by rapidly increasing the blood pressure within the eye sockets, if threatened. Because an individual may lose up to 53% of blood in a single squirt, this is only used against persistent predators like foxes, wolves and coyotes (Canidae), as a last defence. Canids often drop horned lizards after being squirted, and attempt to wipe or shake the blood out of their mouths, suggesting that the fluid has <b>a</b> <b>foul</b> taste; they choose other lizards if given the choice, suggesting a learned aversion towards horned lizards as prey.|$|E
5|$|All line {{markings}} on the pitch {{form part of}} the area which they define. For example, a ball on the side line {{is still in the}} field of play; a ball on the line of the penalty circle is in the penalty circle; <b>a</b> <b>foul</b> committed over the 23-metre (25-yard) line has occurred in the 23-metre area. A ball must completely cross a boundary line to be out of play, and a ball must wholly cross the goal line before a goal is scored.|$|E

50|$|In 1776, {{the device}} {{consisted}} of <b>a</b> <b>fouled</b> anchor (tangled in its rope) of silver or pewter. Changes {{were made in}} 1798, 1821, and 1824. In 1834, it was prescribed that a brass eagle be worn on the cover, the eagle to measure 3.5 in from wingtip to wingtip. An eagle clutching <b>a</b> <b>fouled</b> anchor with thirteen six-pointed stars above was used on uniform buttons starting in 1804. This same insignia is used today on the buttons of Marine dress and service uniforms, with the six-pointed stars changed to five-pointed stars.|$|R
5|$|Chelsea again {{were the}} away {{team to a}} lower {{opponent}} in the quarter-finals, facing Derby County of the Championship. In the first half, Eden Hazard gave Chelsea the lead, later doubled by a Filipe Luís free kick, the full-back's first for Chelsea. Craig Bryson halved the deficit for Derby, but soon afterwards defender Jake Buxton was sent off for <b>a</b> <b>foul</b> on Loïc Rémy and André Schürrle scored the final goal of a 3–1 Chelsea win. In the semi-final, Chelsea beat Liverpool 2–1 on aggregate after Branislav Ivanović scored the winning goal {{in the first half}} of extra time in the second leg, heading in Willian's free kick.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea, {{also of the}} Premier League, {{were the}} {{opposition}} in the semi-final. The match was held at a neutral venue Old Trafford, the home ground of Manchester United. Liverpool {{took the lead in}} the first half. Chelsea defender John Terry committed <b>a</b> <b>foul</b> on Luis García, which resulted in a Liverpool free kick, from which Riise scored. They extended their lead soon after the start of the second half, when a goal by García from , after he received the ball from a William Gallas header, gave them a 2–0 lead. Chelsea scored late in the half through striker Didier Drogba, but they were unable to achieve an equaliser and Liverpool won the match 2–1 to progress to the final.|$|E
5|$|Foster joined newly {{promoted}} League Two side Stevenage on {{a two-year}} contract on 31 May 2010. Foster made his Stevenage {{debut in the}} club's first ever Football League fixture, a 2–2 draw against Macclesfield Town, playing the whole game in the centre of defence. After the Macclesfield game, Foster did {{not appear in the}} first-team until late September 2010, coming on as a late substitute in Stevenage's 1–0 away win at Lincoln City. He then appeared as a 52nd-minute substitute in the club's victory over Burton Albion, but was sent-off for <b>a</b> <b>foul</b> on Shaun Harrad. Foster scored his first goal for Stevenage in January 2011, scoring the first goal of the game in Stevenage's 4–2 home win over Barnet. Foster received his second red card of the 2010–11 season in a game against Northampton Town, receiving the red card for <b>a</b> <b>foul</b> on Nana Ofori-Twumasi, a game that Stevenage went on to lose 2–0. Stevenage appealed against the sending off, but the appeal was subsequently rejected. This ultimately meant that Foster had played his last game of the 2010–11 season, serving a four-match suspension that ruled him out of Stevenage's end of season 3–3 draw with Bury, as well as the club's subsequent play-off campaign. Foster played 23 times for Stevenage in his only season with the club, scoring once, and the team went on to win promotion into League One via the play-offs.|$|E

5|$|Hanigan {{spent the}} entire 2009 season with the Reds except for five games with the Bats. He served as the backup catcher to Ramón Hernández until Hernández {{underwent}} knee surgery and {{was placed on the}} DL. Hanigan went on the DL after he was hit on the face mask by <b>a</b> <b>foul</b> tip and suffered a concussion; he returned on August 8, 2009. For the season, Hanigan had the best fielding percentage as a catcher (.998), and the second best caught stealing percentage (42.9) in the majors.|$|E
5|$|In {{the closing}} {{stages of the}} first half, Van Nistelrooy got his first shot on goal, turning Senderos only to send the ball {{trickling}} along the floor for Lehmann to save comfortably. The first half finished with <b>a</b> <b>foul</b> on Rooney, who had done well to break free of challenges from Cole, Vieira and Senderos, who eventually brought Rooney down. The English forward took the free kick himself, but it went over the bar to cheers from the Arsenal fans {{and the sound of}} the referee's half-time whistle.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{tried to}} find a way back into the match. With 16 minutes left, Whelan was brought down in the Juventus penalty area by Massimo Bonini, but the referee decided that it was not <b>a</b> <b>foul.</b> Liverpool created more chances {{near the end of the}} match; Tacconi saved a shot from Whelan. Wark and Steve Nicol saw headers go wide of the Juventus goal. No further goals were scored and at {{full-time}} the score was 1–0 to Juventus, who had won their first European Cup and became the first club to win all three seasonal UEFA competitions.|$|E

5|$|Merritt {{brought the}} score to 59–35 with her seventh scoring shot. As the game {{drew to a}} close, there were several missed shots by Sarah Vinci and Hill, but Mexico was unable to {{capitalise}} on the opportunities, continuing to miss shots and turn over the ball. With nineteen seconds of play remaining, Hill took a two-point shot from inside the paint; attracting <b>a</b> <b>foul,</b> she scored another point from a free throw. Although Mexico's Wendy Garcia Amador scored the last two points of the game, her team lost to Australia 62–37.|$|E
5|$|Michigan {{lost the}} April 8 {{national}} championship game against Midwest number one seed Louisville by an 82–76 score. Albrecht scored 17 first-half points on 4-for-4 three-point shooting. Burke scored 24 points {{in the championship game}} and made the seven-man All-Tournament team (which was revised multiple times) along with teammates McGary and Albrecht. The turning point of the game was described as a missed call by the referees when, as Michigan trailed 67–64 with 5 minutes left, Burke pinned Peyton Siva's dunk attempt with a clean, all-ball block, but was called for <b>a</b> <b>foul,</b> resulting in two made free throws by Siva. Michigan never got closer than 4 points the rest of the game.|$|E
5|$|On 18 May 2013, having progressed {{through the}} club's academy, Areola made his senior debut for PSG, {{replacing}} first-choice goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu in the 48th minute of a 3–1 home win over Brest. PSG had been crowned Ligue 1 champions {{prior to the}} match and their opponents were already relegated. He made his first start for the club the following weekend in a 3–1 win over Lorient, playing 61 minutes in what was the final match of the season before being substituted for fourth-choice 'keeper Ronan Le Crom, who was sent off later in the match for <b>a</b> <b>foul</b> on Julien Quercia.|$|E
