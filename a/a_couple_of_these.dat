These, along with compounding, decrease the memory load of the language, as they allow for the expansion of {{a relatively small number of}} basic roots into a large vocabulary.

2500|$|Meier founded MicroProse with Stealey in 1982, and by 1986 {{the company}} was using his name and face in {{advertisements}} for its games. MicroProse at first developed mostly simulation video games, such as Silent Service and F-19 Stealth Fighter. In 1987, the company released Sid Meier's Pirates!, which also began a trend of placing Meier's name in the titles of his games. He later explained that the inclusion of his name {{was because of the}} dramatic departure in the design of Pirates! compared to the company's earlier titles. Stealey decided that it would improve the company's branding, believing that it would make those who purchased the flight simulators more likely to play the game. Stealey recalled: [...] "We were at dinner at a Software Publishers Association meeting, and Robin Williams was there. And he kept us in stitches for two hours. And he turns to me and says 'Bill, you should put Sid's name on <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> boxes, and promote him as the star.'

2500|$|The {{cholesterol}} superpathway {{follows the}} degradation of cholesterol down to various substrates, however only <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> biotransformed molecules see propionyl-CoA as a byproduct. The conversion of 3,24-dioxocholest-4-en-26-oyl-CoA to 2-oxochol-4-en-24-oyl-CoA sees {{the release of a}} propionyl-CoA molecule. Additionally, the conversion of 3-oxo-23,24-bisnorchol-4-en-17-ol-22-oyl-CoA to androst-4-ene-3,17-dione release of a propionyl-CoA molecule. Finally, {{the degradation of}} (S)-4-hydroxy-2-oxohexanoate to pyruvate and propanal, in turn releases a propionyl-CoA substrate after the propanal is converted. All these propionyl-CoA substrates are converted to succinyl-CoA following the methylmalonyl pathway For amino acid metabolism, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase works in the degradation pathways of isoleucine, threonine, valine, and methionine. These amino acids are degraded into propanoyl-CoA which is then further degraded into [...] (S)-methylmalonyl-CoA. This substrate must be further metabolized by a very similar enzyme, methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase, which converts the (S) form of methylmalonyl-CoA into the (R) form. This is finally transformed using methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. L-methionine is also metabolized through a longer superpathway (see Figure 2). After transformation to L-homocystein, it is combined with L-serine to make L-cystathione, which is hydrolyzed by cystathione gamma lyase to create 2-oxobutanoate. This substrate is transformed to propanoyl-CoA and undergoes the same metabolism previously described for propanoyl-CoA.|$|E

I had sent from Fernando Po several pounds of this fine silk, intending to experiment upon it in a veil or lace shawl; and afterwards I learned that the Empress Eugénie had a dress made of it, which cost a fabulous number of francs. Bacon and other old writers talk of 'spider's silk' like gathering moonbeams. [Footnote: The Ananse or Agya ananse (father spider), as the Oji-speaking peoples call the insect, is with them either a creator of man (corresponding so far with the scarabeus in the Nile valley) or {{a representative of the}} evil principle. Bosman (Letter xvii.), describing a 'great hideous hairy species,' says, 'The negroes call this spider ananse, and believe that the first men were made by that creature; and, notwithstanding some of them by conversation with the Europeans are better informed, there are yet a great number that remain of that opinion, out of which folly they are not to be reasoned.' The people have a number of fables called Anansesem, such as Spider and Spiderson and the Three Ghosts; in these spider-stories the insect, like the fox with us, is the most intelligent of animals (the late Rev. J. Zimmermann's Akra or Gã Grammar, Stuttgart, 1858). It is represented as speaking through the nose like the local 'bogy,' and its hobbling gait is imitated by the story-teller.
