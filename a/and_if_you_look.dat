500|$|Technical {{director}} Lisa Forsell {{explained that}} {{to enhance the}} richness and beauty of the desert landscapes surrounding Radiator Springs, the filmmakers created a department responsible for matte paintings and sky flats, saying: [...] "Digital matte paintings are {{a way to get}} a lot of visual complexity without necessarily having to build complex geometry, and write complex shaders. We spent a lot time working on the clouds and their different formations. They tend to be on several layers and they move relative to each other. The clouds do in fact have some character and personality. The notion was that just as people see themselves in the clouds, cars see various car-shaped clouds. It’s subtle, but there are definitely some that are shaped like a sedan. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> closely, you’ll see some that look like tire treads. The fact that so much attention is put on the skies speaks to the visual level of the film. Is there a story point? Not really. There is no pixel on the screen that does not have an extraordinary level of scrutiny and care applied to it. There is nothing that is just throw-away." ...|$|E
2500|$|On August 13, 2009, during Netroots Nation, {{when confronted}} by LGBT activist Lane Hudson, Clinton {{explained}} {{that he had to}} sign DOMA in order to prevent a constitutional amendment that would proscribe same-sex marriage: [...] "We were attempting at the time, in a very reactionary Congress, to head off an attempt to send a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage to the states. [...] <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> at the eleven referenda much later—in 2004, in the election—which the Republicans put on the ballot {{to try to get the}} base vote for President Bush up, I think it's obvious that something had to be done to try to keep the Republican Congress from presenting that." ...|$|E

[...] Ford responded, [...] "I don't know why Mr. Corker keeps bringing up my family[...] [...] [...] It's you and I running for the Senate.

Some, however, the Tele. 710, came with four smaller knockouts <b>and,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> inside the case, two circular ones too, top right and left of the dial aperture.

2500|$|He said, [...] "In {{the early}} days, {{every time you}} saw the {{exterior}} of Hogwarts, it was a physical miniature," [...] which was made by craftsmen and occupied a large sound stage.

And in the last film, we needed an arena for the battle for Hogwarts – the big courtyard outside doubled in size, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> at the first movie it wasn't there at all. There were quite some liberties taken with the continuity of Hogwarts." [...] In the last film, Craig used a digital model instead of a miniature to [...] "embrace the latest technology".|$|E

50|$|The Priory Of Sion fascinates me, {{because it}} has all the {{appearances}} of being a real conspiracy, <b>and</b> yet <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> at the elements another way, it looks like a very complicated practical joke by a bunch of intellectual French aristocrats.

60|$|It {{fell like}} an eye upon the stirrups, and then {{suddenly}} and yet very gently rested upon the bed, upon the alarum clock, and upon the butterfly box stood open. The pale clouded yellows had pelted over the moor; they had zigzagged across the purple clover. The fritillaries flaunted along the hedgerows. The blues settled on little bones lying on the turf with the sun beating on them, and the painted ladies and the peacocks feasted upon bloody entrails dropped by a hawk. Miles away from home, in a hollow among teasles beneath a ruin, {{he had found the}} commas. He had seen a white admiral circling higher and higher round an oak tree, but he had never caught it. An old cottage woman living alone, high up, had told him of a purple butterfly which came every summer to her garden.

60|$|Well, {{gunpowder}} {{is strong}} sometimes: but not always. You may carry it in a flask, {{or in your}} hand, and then it is weak enough.
