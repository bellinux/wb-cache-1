It was not [...] "numerously signed" [...] by the inhabitants of Casterbridge, as is usual in such cases, for Boldwood had never made many friends over the counter. The shops thought it very natural that <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who, by <b>importing</b> direct from the producer, had daringly set aside the first great principle of provincial existence, namely that God made country villages to supply customers to county towns, should have confused ideas about the Decalogue. The prompters were <b>a</b> few merciful <b>men</b> who had perhaps too feelingly considered the facts latterly unearthed, and the result was that evidence was taken which it was hoped might remove the crime in a moral point of view, out of the category of wilful murder, and lead it to be regarded as a sheer outcome of madness.|$|R

40|$|The {{collection}} holds primarily {{correspondence to}} Klaus Tarnowski (David Toren) in Sweden {{from family and}} friends in Breslau, then Germany, 1939 - 1942, documenting Klaus’ sojourn in Sweden and the Tarnowskis’ plight in Breslau. Most prominent among the collection's personal correspondence are his parents Georg Tarnowski and Marie née Friedmann, as well as his brother Hans and his grandmother Betty Friedmann. Also included is documentation, including official correspondence from German government offices on property of the Tarnowski and Friedmann families. David Toren was born as Klaus Günther Tarnowski in Breslau on April 30, 1925, the younger son of the lawyer Georg Tarnowski and his wife Marie, née Friedmann. At age 14, {{a few days before the}} beginning of the Second World War, he was sent with a Kindertransport to Uppsala, Sweden, where he went to high school and then studied chemistry in Stockholm, before emigrating to Israel in 1948. In 1953, he and his American-born wife moved to England, where Toren studied law, before starting a career as intellectual property lawyer in the United States. Georg Tarnowski was born in 1878 in Breslau and became a prominent lawyer who was also active in German-Jewish organizations, such as Zentralverein Deutscher Bürger jüdischen Glaubens, Vereinigungl jüdischer Frontsoldaten and – as a gifted author and poet – in the Prague-based organization for friendship, art and humor, Schlaraffia. As a lawyer, he had important business ties with clients in Sweden. Marie Tarnowski’s father Siegmund Friedmann was <b>a</b> business <b>man</b> <b>importing</b> wood from South America, particularly from Venezuela, and he served as a consul for Venezuela in Germany. In spite of the Tarnowskis' strong ties to Sweden and Venezuela, they didn’t emigrate to either place but remained in Germany. Georg and Marie Tarnowski were murdered in Auschwitz in March 1943.

50|$|Nevertheless, the war {{affected}} society, economy, and administration. During the war, {{the provincial}} administrative institutions were {{subordinate to the}} military and headed by military officials. Mobilization resulted in work force shortage affecting all non-war-related industry, construction, and agriculture. Women, minors and POWs partially replaced the drafted <b>men.</b> <b>Import</b> and fishing declined when the ports were blocked. With the war going on, food shortages occurred, especially {{in the winter of}} 1916/17. Also coal, gas, and electricity were at times unavailable.|$|R

50|$|When World War I broke out, Hargrave {{joined the}} Royal Army Medical Corps, and saw {{action at the}} Battle of Gallipoli. Hargrave's Quaker pacifism was {{reinforced}} by the horrors of war. The experience convinced him that modern civilisation had gone awry and he voiced his feelings in his angry polemic of 1919, The Great War Brings It Home. This was {{a call to action}} for all groups concerned with the health and character of future generations. Hargrave called for a new national scheme for character-building and physical training, and the result was the foundation of the Kindred of the Kibbo Kift in August 1920. Intended as a movement for all ages and genders, the Kibbo Kift provided a co-educational, and therefore progressive, alternative to the Boy Scouts. Hargrave was initially appointed 'Head Man' as a temporary measure, but by 1924 had succeeded in becoming the undisputed leader. <b>As</b> Head <b>Man</b> he <b>imported</b> into the Kindred his interest in ritual and art, along with his own views about self-education, science, magic, and healthy behaviour. He was a strong believer in Darwinian evolution, holding that Kibbo Kift training would produce morally upright and healthy individuals, through whom the human race as a whole would evolve into a better state. He believed that building better individuals was the way of building a better society, thus standing apart from those on the left and right who believed in the State as the main vehicle for social change. Hargrave's vision of the better society to come owed much to his Quaker roots: he saw a future society without war, poverty or wasted lives, all kept together by the self-discipline of enlightened individuals.|$|R

40|$|More Than the Boston Tea Party: Tea in American Culture, 1760 s – 1840 s,” a M. A. thesis by Lisa L. Petrovich {{from the}} History Department and advised by Dr. Ralph Mann, argues that tea, despite its {{function}} in the Boston Tea Party, played other important roles in early American culture. Part of the new consumer economy, tea embedded itself in social customs and allowed for a more democratic means of respectability. It played political roles before the American Revolution and during the antebellum reform movements. Even though <b>men</b> <b>imported</b> and consumed the commodity, society in the new republic considered tea the domain of women, which reinforced negative patterns of thought about women’s place in America. Between the 1760 s and the 1840 s, Americans claimed tea {{as a part of}} their culture and gave it social, political, and gendered meanings, which include but are much more than the Boston Tea Party...|$|R

5000|$|Interpreting [...] "person" [...] in {{accordance}} with Parliament's purpose of criminalizing possession of material that poses a reasoned risk of harm to children, it seems that it should include visual works of the imagination as well as depictions of actual people.
