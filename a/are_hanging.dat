5|$|The 160 {{entries in}} the list consist of the following: 91 <b>are</b> <b>hanging</b> scrolls; 38 are hand scrolls or emakimono; 22 are byōbu folding screens or {{paintings}} on fusuma sliding doors; four are murals; and three are albums. Two items, the portrait of Kichijōten and Illustrated Biography of Prince Shōtoku do not fall {{in any of these}} categories. The paintings are located in museums, Buddhist temples, Shinto shrines, private collections, a university and one is located in a tomb (Takamatsuzuka Tomb). A large proportion of items are housed in the national museums of Tokyo, Kyoto and Nara. The city containing the greatest number of National Treasure paintings is Kyoto with 51, followed by Tokyo with 48 of which 28 are located in the Tokyo National Museum which is the structure housing the most painting National Treasures.|$|E
5|$|Being a brachycephalic breed, King Charles Spaniels can be {{sensitive}} to anesthesia. This is because in brachycephalic dogs, there is additional tissue in the throat directly behind the mouth and nasal cavity, known as the pharynx, and anesthesia acts as a muscle relaxant causing this tissue to obstruct the dogs' narrow airways. These narrow airways can decrease the dogs' ability to exercise properly and increase their susceptibility to heat stroke. Other congenital and hereditary disorders found in the King Charles Spaniel <b>are</b> <b>hanging</b> tongue, where a neurological defect prevents the tongue from retracting into the mouth; diabetes mellitus, which {{may be associated with}} cataracts; cleft palate and umbilical hernia. The English Toy Spaniel Club of America recommends that umbilical hernias be corrected only if other surgery is required, due to the risk of surgery in brachycephalic breeds. In another study conducted by the OFA, the King Charles Spaniel was the 38th worst of 99 breeds for patella luxation; of 75 animals tested, 4% were found to have the ailment. However, surveys conducted by the Finnish breed club between 1988 and 2007 found that the occurrences were higher in some years, ranging from 5.3% to 50%.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Swift {{entering}} the coffee shop. As she sits down, she notices that couple, opposite {{where she is}} sitting, is arguing, reminding Swift about her parents arguing when she was very young. Then the waiter (Toby Hemingway) comes by, just to take Swift's order, who looks up and she infatuates him, resulting in a romantic relationship between the two. They are seen moving in together and unpacking boxes. After some time of dating, he proposes to her on a rowboat and she cheerfully accepts. Later, the two are seen arguing, resulting in Swift running away from the house, crying, just like she did {{when she was younger}} as she saw her parents arguing. The boyfriend follows her, and the two reconcile the relationship. They get married and have two sons. In the end, time returns to when Swift was ordering her food at the coffee shop. Throughout the video, there are some scenes of Swift singing the verses of the song while walking barefoot on a green pasture amongst photos of her and her family. The photos <b>are</b> <b>hanging</b> on a white string in between two large trees. Swift is seen with her hair loose and wearing a white dress with a thin belt around the waist.|$|E

500|$|After {{the writing}} of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, several similar stories followed. The Greene Knight (15th–17th century) is a rhymed retelling of nearly the same tale. In it, the plot is simplified, motives are more fully explained, and some names are changed. Another story, The Turke and Gowin (15th century), begins with a Turk {{entering}} Arthur's court and asking, [...] "Is there any will, as a brother, To give a buffett and take another?" [...] At {{the end of this}} poem the Turk, rather than buffeting Gawain back, asks the knight to cut off his head, which Gawain does. The Turk then praises Gawain and showers him with gifts. The Carle of Carlisle (17th century) also resembles Gawain in a scene in which the Carle (Churl), a lord, takes Sir Gawain to a chamber where two swords <b>are</b> <b>hanging</b> and orders Gawain to cut off his head or suffer his own to be cut off. Gawain obliges and strikes, but the Carle rises, laughing and unharmed. Unlike the Gawain poem, no return blow is demanded or given.|$|E
500|$|The game {{takes place}} over six levels called {{attraction}}s. Each attraction {{is divided into}} five acts; the fifth act ends in a boss fight with Robotnik. Like earlier Sonic games, the players collect rings, jump to perform a spin attack to defeat enemies, as well as perform a spin dash {{on the ground to}} gain speed. Power-ups are placed throughout the attractions providing players with rings, shields, and speed shows, among other boons. The partner mechanic offers new actions not seen in earlier Sonic games. Players can call their partner if they are separated, which reunites them with the main character, but this costs the player 10 rings. In addition, players can throw their partner, which can aid in getting to hard-to-reach platforms. If the partner is computer-controlled, the player is given the ability to stop and anchor the computer partner to perform special moves. Using this, the player can [...] "snap up" [...] to a partner on a higher ledge if they <b>are</b> <b>hanging</b> below. They can also anchor the partner and build tension in the tether by moving away from them, then release them to gain a powerful speed boost. The game also employs a [...] "time of day" [...] mechanic; each level changes to a specific time of day (morning, noon, evening, and night), which affects enemy placement and boss difficulty.|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} commenced at Gibraltar on 17 September 1986. Aerial stuntmen B. J. Worth and Jake Lombard {{performed the}} pre-credits parachute jump. Both the terrain and wind were unfavourable. Consideration {{was given to}} the stunt being done using cranes but aerial stunts arranger B. J. Worth stuck to skydiving and completed the scenes in a day. The aircraft used for the jump was a C-130 Hercules, which in the film had M's office installed in the aircraft cabin. The initial point of view for the scene shows M in what appears to be his usual London office, but the camera then zooms out to reveal that it is, in fact, inside an aircraft. Although marked as a Royal Air Force aircraft, the one in shot belonged to the Spanish Air Force and was used again later in the film for the Afghanistan sequences, this time in [...] "Russian" [...] markings. During this later chapter, a fight breaks out on the open ramp of the aircraft in flight between Bond and Necros, before Necros falls to his death. Although the plot and preceding shots suggest the aircraft is a C-130, the shot of Necros falling away from the aircraft show a twin engine cargo plane, a C-123 Provider. Worth and Lombard also doubled for Bond and Necros in the scenes where they <b>are</b> <b>hanging</b> on a bag in a plane's open cargo door.|$|E

2500|$|Nests are {{typically}} composed “of one comb of small worker cells {{and up to}} three combs of larger cells used for rearing males and queens, surrounded by multiple layers of envelope”. The nests (investigated in Archer’s experiment) were small {{with a mean of}} 57 workers, as cited in “A Test of Worker Policing Theory in an Advanced Eusocial Wasp, Vespula rufa.” [...] However, mature colonies can have as many as 282 workers. The nests are generally found in dry banks underground but close to the surface. Subterranean nests have nest cavities just below the surface or just beneath the layer of moss. There are also nests that are positioned in the stumps of old, hollow trees, as well as nests that <b>are</b> <b>hanging</b> from the roots of trees. In a group of 19 subterranean nests the average depth of such nests was 2.9 centimeters. On rare occasions, aerial nests can be spotted in dense bushes. Aerial nests can exist [...] "in a cavity ...or covered above." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Slim Shady LP turned Eminem from an {{underground}} rapper into a high-profile celebrity.

In June 1999, he married his girlfriend Kimberly Ann [...] "Kim" [...] Scott, the mother of Hailie, {{despite the fact that}} the song [...] "'97 Bonnie & Clyde" [...] from The Slim Shady LP contains references to killing her.

[...] Eminem also became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content. He was labeled as [...] "misogynist, a nihilist and an advocate of domestic violence", and in an editorial, Billboard editor in chief Timothy White accused Eminem of [...] "making money by exploiting the world's misery".|$|E

2500|$|As {{the fires}} {{continued}} to burn, occupants {{trapped in the}} upper floors of the South Tower provided information about conditions to 9-1-1 dispatchers. At 9:37am, an occupant on the 105th floor of the South Tower reported that floors beneath him [...] "in the 90-something floor" [...] had collapsed. The New York City Police Department aviation unit also relayed information about the deteriorating condition of the buildings to police commanders. Only 14 people escaped from above the impact zone of the South Tower after it was hit (including Stanley Praimnath, who saw the plane coming at him), and only four from the floors above it. They escaped via Stairwell A, the only stairwell which had been left intact after the impact. Numerous police hotline operators who received calls from individuals inside the South Tower were not well informed of the situation as it rapidly unfolded. Many operators told callers not to descend the tower on their own, {{even though it is}} now believed that Stairwell A was most likely passable at and above the point of impact. At 9:52am, the NYPD aviation unit reported over the radio that [...] "large pieces may be falling from the top of WTC 2. Large pieces <b>are</b> <b>hanging</b> up there". With the warnings, the NYPD issued orders for its officers to evacuate. During the emergency response, there was minimal communication between the NYPD and the New York City Fire Department (FDNY), and overwhelmed 9-1-1 dispatchers did not pass along information to FDNY commanders on-scene. At 9:59am, the South Tower collapsed, 56 minutes after being struck.|$|E
