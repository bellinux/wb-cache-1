A prediction model of residual stress redistribution is raised based on the Hull - Rimmer theory. And the quantitative expression between crack length, initiation crack location, initial distribution of residual stress and redistribution stress is achieved. Then the residual stres of crack tip and the redistribution stress of three instances are predicted, which also compared with the test results. It can be found from the comparison that the prediction results are basically same with the test results. Therefore, the prediction model of residual stress redistribution based on Hull-Rimmer theory can be well used for the precise prediction of residual stress redistribution in the crack propagation process...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of <b>cracks</b> <b>or</b> <b>damage</b> phenomena in concrete elements is strictly correlated to {{the occurrence of}} nonlinear effects in their elastic response to an ultrasonic excitation. The Fourier analysis is often inadequate to pinpoint such effects, since the signal-to-noise ratio of higher order harmonics is usually very low. In order to overcome this drawback, we suggest an alternative procedure, denoted as Scaling Subtraction Method (SSM), to extract nonlinearity indicators from the recorded ultrasonic signals, based on the dependence of {{the response of the}} system on the excitation amplitude. The SSM is first described and then used to analyze the evolution of nonlinearity due to progressive crack formation induced by quasi-static compressive loads in concrete core-drilled cylinders.

When load is applied to a structure containing a <b>crack</b> <b>or</b> <b>damage,</b> a small area ahead of the crack undergoes very high stress.

The size of this damage zone varies depending on the material type and the damage tolerance i. e. energy absorbed by the damage zone is directly proportional to the damage zone. The damage zone can be mapped by various destructive and nondestructive methods. A destructive method is cutting the specimen and observation by SEM.
