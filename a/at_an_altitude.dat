5|$|The Venus Express probe {{has shown}} through stellar {{occultation}} that the atmospheric haze extends much further {{up on the}} night side than the day side.

5|$|An {{alternative}} design {{completed by}} McDonnell Aircraft in 1965 is usually {{considered part of}} Project Isinglass, however some documents refer to the aircraft as having been codenamed Project Rheinberry. McDonnell's proposed boost-glide aircraft, submitted to the CIA independently of the Convair Isinglass proposals, featured a small, manned, rocket-powered craft with a high lift-to-drag ratio that would be air-launched by a B-52 bomber while flying over the Atlantic Ocean. The aircraft would ignite its rocket engine and adopt a trajectory that would take it over the Soviet Union at speeds of Mach 20 and <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>altitude</b> of over , before descending over the Pacific Ocean to a landing at Groom Lake, Nevada, as a glider, landing on the lake bed using a skid landing gear.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>an</b> <b>altitude</b> of , Chard {{is one of}} {{the highest}} towns in Somerset, and is also the southernmost. The suburbs include: Crimchard, Furnham, Glynswood, Henson Park and Old Town. Local {{folklore}} claims that the town has a very unusual and unique feature, a stream running along either side of Fore Street. One stream eventually flows into the Bristol Channel and the other reaches the English Channel. This situation changed when the tributary of the Axe was diverted into the Isle; the gutter in Holyrood Street, though, still flows into the River Axe and therefore it is still true it lies on the watershed and that two gutters within the down eventually drain into the Bristol Channel and the English Channel.|$|E
5|$|L. ahuacaense {{is known}} only from Cerro El Ahuaca, a steep granite inselberg near Cariamanga in Loja Province, {{southern}} Ecuador, where it occurs <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>altitude</b> of , but only near rocky surfaces. The vegetation {{is dominated by}} the molasses grass (Melinis minutiflora). They eat plants, and traces of their feeding are visible on the mountain. Their habitat on Cerro El Ahuaca covers an area around , and the total population there may not contain more than a few dozen individuals. Except for some small outcrops close to the Cerro, no nearby habitat is suitable, but more populations may exist elsewhere in southern Ecuador or nearby northern Peru.|$|E

5|$|On February 10, 1952, Davis flew his 59th {{and last}} combat {{mission of the}} war in an F-86E Sabre (tail number 51-2752). That day, he led a flight of four F-86s on a patrol near the Yalu River, near the Manchurian border. Davis' group {{was part of a larger}} UN force of 18 F-86s {{operating}} in the area. As Davis' patrol reached the border, one of his F-86 pilots reported he was out of oxygen causing Davis to order him to return to base with his wingman. As Davis continued patrolling with one wingman, Second Lieutenant William W. Littlefield, and cruising <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>altitude</b> of , they spotted a flight of 12 MiG-15s of the Chinese 4th Fighter Division heading in the direction of a group of US F-84 Thunderjets conducting a low-level bombing mission on North Korean communication lines.|$|E
5|$|Twenty {{years after}} the Falklands {{conflict}} Bravo November saw service in Iraq, being the first British helicopter to land Royal Marines ashore. After departing from , Bravo November landed the first Royal Marines on to the Al-Faw peninsula to seize oil-pumping facilities before Iraqi troops could destroy them. The second DFC for actions at the controls of Bravo November was awarded to Squadron Leader Steve Carr {{for his role in}} an operation in Iraq. Bravo November was tasked with delivering the Marines to the landing sites marked by US special forces before returning for more troops, guns and freight. The aircraft was being flown <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>altitude</b> of less than 100ft with restricted visibility due to dust clouds thrown up by American armoured forces.|$|E
5|$|On September26, the Hurricane Hunter P2V-3W Neptune {{aircraft}} Snowcloud Five, led by U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander Grover B. Windham, {{was sent}} from Guantánamo Bay to investigate Janet, {{which was at}} the time a Category4 hurricane south of Jamaica. Upon penetration of the hurricane's eyewall <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>altitude</b> of 700ft (200m), a final transmission was received from the reconnaissance flight before it presumably crashed in the Caribbean Sea. All 11people on board, including nine crew members and two journalists, were killed. Following the loss of the plane, an extensive search and rescue operation took place over a large area of the Caribbean Sea, with 3,000personnel involved with the search, returning no results. The exact cause of the crash remains unknown, though it is speculated that the plane's altimeter gave an incorrect reading due to the low surrounding barometric pressure. Although four hurricane reconnaissance flights have been lost since operations began in 1943, Snowcloud Five remains the only known loss of a reconnaissance aircraft {{as a result of a}} hurricane in the Atlantic basin, with the other three occurring as a result of Pacific typhoons.|$|E

25|$|The {{difficulty}} of mountain training can {{be judged by}} the fact that only 15 out of the 200 soldiers in the 100th Separate Guards Reconnaissance Company and the 1st Airborne Company of the 345th Guards Airborne Regiment reached the summit of Peak Harvest in the Alay Mountains <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>altitude</b> of 4000 meters.
