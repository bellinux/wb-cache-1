This is the first study on this issue using individual representative data ­ the German Socio-Economic Panel ­ and multivariate methods. The results indicate that rather women, persons with many years of tenure and working in big firms receive <b>severance</b> <b>payments.</b> There is a huge variance {{in the size of the}} payments, which can only partly be explained by tenure, the wage and citizenship.

40|$|In 1990 Colombia {{replaced}} {{its traditional}} system of <b>severance</b> <b>payments</b> {{with a new}} system of <b>severance</b> <b>payments</b> savings accounts (SPSAs). Although <b>severance</b> <b>payments</b> often are justified {{on the grounds that they}} provide insurance against earnings loss, they also increase costs for employers and distort employment decisions. The impact of <b>severance</b> <b>payments</b> depends largely on how much of the costs to employers can be shifted to workers. The theoretical analysis in this Paper shows that, in contrast to a traditional system of <b>severance</b> <b>payments,</b> the system of SPSAs facilitates the shifting of <b>severance</b> <b>payments</b> costs to workers in the form of lower wages. Empirical results using the Colombian National Household Surveys indicate that the introduction of SPSAs shifted around 80 % of the total <b>severance</b> <b>payments</b> contributions to wages and had a positive effect on weekly hours. Results using the 1997 Colombian Living Standards Measurement Survey suggest that, although SPSAs in part replaced employer insurance with self-insurance, SPSAs continue to play a consumption smoothing role for the non-employed. consumption smoothing; crowding out; distortions; tax shifting; unemployment insurance...|$|R

40|$|WIFO {{studied the}} effects which two schemes {{to reform the}} <b>severance</b> <b>payment</b> {{currently}} proposed to Parliament {{would have on the}} Austrian labour market. Only a few terminated employment relationships currently meet the requirements to qualify for <b>severance</b> <b>payment.</b> An employee giving notice him-/herself is not eligible for <b>severance</b> <b>payment.</b> Eligibility rises in graduated steps with the length of stay in a company: no <b>severance</b> <b>payment</b> is due for employment of less than three years, but it amounts to one year's salary after 25 years of employment. In Austria, about one third of all employment relationships are terminated annually, with most of these employees not eligible for <b>severance</b> <b>payment,</b> since the currently applicable stepped rate acts to the detriment of employees who are employed by the same company for less than three years. <b>Severance</b> <b>payment</b> thus operates rather as a premium for employee loyalty. Two proposals have been submitted to Parliament which aim to bring the <b>severance</b> <b>payment</b> system more in line with high mobility rates and which simultaneously attempt to change <b>severance</b> <b>payments</b> into an old-age pension provision scheme (second pillar). The proposals furnished, respectively, by the SPÖ (Social Democratic Party) and ÖVP (Austrian People's Party) are contribution-based systems. In both models, the employee's entitlement to <b>severance</b> <b>payment</b> grows uniformly with the length of gainful employment. Even when an employee quits, the entitlement remains active in the <b>severance</b> <b>payment</b> fund, although the ÖVP's model precludes the employee from disposing of the money. Under the ÖVP's model, the employer pays contributions only for employees who have worked for the employer for more than a year. While this is an improvement over the current stepped model, it is still detrimental to the desired higher mobility of employees who would thus suffer a loss of entitlement. For mobile and seasonal workers in particular this model grants neither a bridging support nor any additional old age pension provision. After 300 contributory months (25 years), no more contributions need to be paid for the employee. The envisaged slow transition to the new system would reduce wage costs for older employees only in the 26 th year, at a time when demographic projections forecast a severe shortage of workers. Seen from today, the capping will have a long-term effect in the loan and insurance industry, chemicals manufacturing industry, and energy and water utilities. With the maximum <b>severance</b> <b>payment</b> set at one year's salary, just as today, employees of these industries would not be worse off than today. The SPÖ proposal includes all employees in the system, regardless of the period of gainful employment and the type of termination. Employers need to make contributions to the <b>severance</b> <b>payment</b> funds for all employees, from the time they are first employed until the time they leave/retire. The model places greater emphasis on bridging and on additional old-age provision, since entitlements rise with the duration of gainful employment. Almost 71 percent of terminated employment relationships and 23 percent of continuing employment relationships have a duration of less than one year. Short term employment is particularly widespread in the construction industry, tourism, retail trade, data processing, loan and insurance businesses, and producer and other services. A reform of <b>severance</b> <b>payments</b> as envisaged by the SPÖ model would mean additional expenditure for employers, but would offer better security against unemployment and old-age provision to employees of these sectors, whereas this security would be lower if the ÖVP model were implemented.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{equilibrium}} welfare effects of introducing mandated <b>severance</b> <b>payments</b> in a labor market with costly mobility, where self-insurance through a riskless asset {{is the only}} way to smooth fluctuations in labor income due to unemployment shocks. The framework allows for wage flexibility at the level of the individual firm-worker match. Wages vary with both tenure and productivity of the workers. When <b>severance</b> <b>payments</b> are introduced, the firm can potentially undo their effect by modifying the wage profile. Workers entry wages fall by the expected present value of the future payment. However, because of incomplete markets, workers are affected by the change in slope of the wage profile. Moreover, non trivial general equilibrium effects are also present, since the incentives to save are affected and the capital stock varies. On the one hand, with <b>severance</b> <b>payments</b> agents are better insured and the precautionary motive for savings is reduced.

40|$|Suppose {{that a fair}} {{insurance}} policy is available to risk-averse economic agents contingent on only "observable" variables. The risk-averse agents will purchase incomplete insurance to maximize their expected utility. The first order condition is typically an equality of expected "marginal" utility. whether or not weighted by the level of income, conditional on observable states. It is interesting {{to know how the}} "levels" of utility are ranked among these states given the first order conditions. We will show that the ranking of the "level" of expected utility depends on the degree of risk aversion. Suppose an implicit contract model with <b>severance</b> <b>payments.</b> Workers are laid off with a fixed known probability. When a worker is laid off, he is paid <b>severance</b> <b>payments</b> and released for a search of new employment. Whether he is reemployed or self-employed or how much he is earning is unverifiable by the original employer, so that <b>severance</b> <b>payments</b> cannot be contingent on income after layoff. In this sense, <b>severance</b> <b>payments</b> are incomplete insurance. Suppose that income after layoff is proportional to <b>severance</b> <b>payments</b> with the proportion being stochastic. The first order condition is given as an equality of an expected marginal utility of income after layoff weighted by that income to a marginal utility of wages for a retained worker weighted by the amount of <b>severance</b> <b>payments.</b> For example, when the relative risk aversion is more than one and constant, and the mean of proportion of yield on <b>severance</b> <b>payments</b> is less than one, the utility of the retained is larger than the expected utility of the laid off. Other cases are worked out, too. This claim is proved using the following theorem. Provided that the relative risk aversion is greater than one, the "level" of utility of sure income is greater (less) than the expected utility, if the utility function is of increasing (decreasing, respectively) relative risk aversion. The result is reverse for the case that the degree of risk aversion is less than one. All assertions are rigorously proved...|$|R

40|$|Whereas the {{existing}} literature models Employment Protection Legislation (EPL) as a firing tax on labor shedding, this paper studies qualitatively and quantitatively the macroeconomic effects of <b>severance</b> <b>payments</b> (pure transfers) between employer and dismissed employees. First, {{it shows that the}} transfer component of existing EPL largely dominates the tax component. Second, it shows that the theoretical distinction between tax and transfer is important: in a search economy where bonding is limited by a wage floor, a rise in <b>severance</b> <b>payment</b> increases unemployment duration, with ambiguous effects on turnover, the opposite of what happens when firing taxes are increased. Third, when the model is calibrated to the Italian economy, one of the countries with the most stringent EPL, it appears that a reduction of <b>severance</b> <b>payments</b> is more beneficial (in terms of unemployment rate and its duration) than a decrease in the firing tax. Overall, this paper argues that the emphasis of the theoretical and empirical literature should shift from the analysis of firing taxes to that of <b>severance</b> <b>payments</b> with limited bonding.
