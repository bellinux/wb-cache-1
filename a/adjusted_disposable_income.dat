40|$|This paper uses age-period-cohort {{models to}} show that the living {{standards}} (total monetary incomes after public benefits and contributions, adjusted for household size and inflation) of successive birth cohorts in the United States and Germany are strongly correlated with general changes in <b>disposable</b> <b>incomes.</b> This means that, after introducing controls, virtually every successive birth cohort in Germany and the United States had increasing <b>disposable</b> <b>incomes,</b> similar to general rates of economic growth. For France, however, we find that, while <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> increased through the 20 th century, cohorts born before 1950 profited from this, while cohorts born after 1950 experience no improvement in living standards over previous cohorts, after <b>adjusting</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>incomes</b> for inflation and controls - mainly education and household composition. Thus, while economic growth benefits all birth cohorts in the United States and Germany, pre- 1950 birth cohorts in France have monopolized lucrative positions and social transfers so that post- 1950 birth cohorts do not benefit from economic growth...|$|R

40|$|The {{main idea}} {{of this paper is}} that {{although}} the per capita regional GDP is a good indicator of regional income according to its place of generation, it cannot take into account the redistribution process that comes after production, and that may be very significant at the regional level. The paper focuses then on the transformation of the regional product on the <b>adjusted</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> of the households, and on the different redistributive flows that proceed with that transformation. It has two distinct parts. Firstly we adopted a synchronic analysis where we deal with the so-called income inter-regional redistribution process. In this part we wonder how the regional income inequalities, that are the outcome of the different locations of production, are smoothed when the income falls {{into the hands of the}} households (or if the contrary happens, how they are amplified). The identification and the estimation of the weights of the different channels through which that lessening (or amplifying) process acts is an essential part of the work. In a second part ahead we turn to a dynamic approach where we focus on the spatial stabilization of the income effect. At this point our purpose is rather to look at the shocks on the regional product, and to discuss how they can be absorbed (or not) when the production income is transmuted into the regional <b>adjusted</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> of the households. The degree and the channels of risk sharing (as this absorption process is named too) are also estimated.

40|$|First considered, at a {{point in}} time, is how {{cross-country}} differences in the mix of income sources are related to three measures of economic well-being. Poverty, defined as 50 percent of mean-adjusted household income; relative <b>adjusted</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> of aged households with heads over 55 years of age relative to those under 55; and inequality as measured by the gini coefficient. Second, the broader question, namely that if the institutions providing social benefits are changing, over time, what is the likely redistributive impact of this development is addressed. The analysis focuses on income sources in the last stages of the working career. Starting at age 55, four different five-year age groups are identified to describe the last stage of the working career. LIS data is used to analyze the experience of ten countries: Australia 1994, Canada 1997, Finland 1995, Germany 1994, Netherlands 1994, Norway 1995, Sweden 1995, Switzerland 1992, United Kingdom 1995 and United States 1997.

40|$|In most OECD-countries income {{inequality}} has increased {{during the last}} two decades. In this paper, we investigate to what extent changes in the overall distribution of incomes can be attributed to social policy measures. The case for the Netherlands is particularly interesting, because the Dutch welfare state has been reformed rather fundamentally in recent years. The budget incidence analysis indicates that in the period 1981 - 1996 inequality of <b>adjusted</b> <b>disposable</b> household <b>income</b> increased sharply. The main force behind this phenomenon was a more unequal distribution of market incomes, but social transfers also explain a substantial large part of the rise in inequality. Social security reforms indeed seem to have made the income distribution less equal. The results of a more detailed analysis for 1996 on the redistributive impact of social policy and of specific social programs - using data from an unique income panel survey - can be summarised as follows: - The first five income deciles clearly gain from social security, while the higher deciles loose. Social security causes a reduction in inequality by 26 to 50 percent, depending on the indicator used. - The public old age program and the social assistance program explain by far the largest part of redistribution by the social system, while the disability and unemployment programs do not have strong redistributive effects. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The Guidelines for the FCTC Article 6 state: When {{establishing}} {{their levels}} of taxation, Parties should make tobacco products less affordable over {{time in order to}} reduce consumption. The objective is to estimate the impact of changes in tobacco affordability on tobacco consumption and tobacco excise revenues in 2011 - 2014 in 28 European Union countries. Material and Methods Tobacco affordability index was calculated using the Eurostat data on harmonized consumer price index for tobacco products (adjusted for inflation) and the <b>adjusted</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income,</b> gross Purchasing Power Standard per inhabitant. The European Commission data on tobacco revenues and tobacco sales (cigarettes and fine-cut tobacco combined) were used. Results Strong correlation between changes of tobacco affordability and tobacco sales is observed in the EU- 28. Tobacco consumption declined in the EU- 28 in 2011 - 2014, while tobacco excise revenues were stable. Countries where tobacco became less affordable mainly due to tax and price increases (UK, France, Romania) observed a decline in consumption and growing revenue. Countries, where tobacco became less affordable mainly due to the economic recession (Greece, Spain, Ireland) had a decline in consumption and a reduction in revenue. Countries, where tobacco became more affordable (Lithuania, Bulgaria, Austria) had an increase in consumption and revenue. Conclusions Tobacco taxation can ensure both tobacco consumption decline and revenue increase only if taxation is a key factor of tobacco affordability reduction. Otherwise, in years of economic recession consumption declines, but revenue does not increase; while in years of economic growth revenue increases, but consumption does not decline...|$|E

Specifically, this thesis examines the determinants of household demand growth for PV systems in the early-stage technology diffusion process at international, national and local levels. Quantitative econometric, cross-sectional and time-series, regression analysis is {{used to examine the}} determinants of household demand for domestic PV systems in 21 countries in 2009, and patterns of demand growth in Australia and Germany from the early 1990 s to 2010. Data were drawn mainly from the databases of the International Energy Agency Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme, World Bank, OECD, and Australian Bureau of Statistics. In-depth interviews were conducted with 21 households, owners and non-owners of PV systems. The households were located in Canberra, Australia’s capital, where the researcher lived and government policy was used to promote domestic PV system purchases. The international cross-sectional analysis found turn-key price had an inverse relationship to household demand; wealth per capita, GDP per capita, and feed-in tariffs had a positive influence on demand. Surprisingly, solar radiation levels and education were found to lack explanatory power. In the two-country time-series analysis, feed-in tariffs had a positive influence on household demand for PV systems. GDP per capita, household <b>adjusted</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> per capita and household net worth per capita were found to positively influence Australian household demand for PV systems; turn-key price was found to influence German household demand inversely, and electricity price was found to influence German household demand positively. In the household interviews, household concern about the environment, economic benefits and social interaction were reported as the major drivers for households adopting PV systems while price, transaction costs, equity and fairness issues were the major barriers to household PV adoption. In summary, household demand for PV systems is sensitive to turn-key price and electricity price, and price effects appear more powerful as markets mature. Government policy has been important in giving initial impetus to demand growth: feed-in tariffs especially, capital subsidies less so. If turn-key price continues to fall, policy stimulation will be less necessary in future...|$|E
