5|$|A Passover Seder is {{a ritual}} meal held by Jews {{on the first}} two nights of the Passover holiday (first night only in Israel). The Seder is {{traditionally}} conducted in the home by the family and their invited guests, although it may also be held by <b>any</b> <b>group</b> of Jews, such as members of a synagogue, condominium complex, student group, army base, etc. At the Seder, participants read the Haggadah, a ritual text recounting the liberation of the Israelites from slavery in ancient Egypt. The reading is accompanied by visual aids {{in the form of the}} symbolic foods on the Passover Seder Plate. A festive meal is part of the ritual. While religious Jewish law places certain restrictions on a non-Jew eating at a Seder, non-traditional Jews often invite non-Jews to their Seders, and non-Jews also conduct Seders of their own.|$|E

Other stringed instruments composing the standard Filipino rondalla are the 14-string bandurria found only in the Philippines, the laúd, the octavina, the Twelve-string guitar, the Ukulele, the bajo de uñas or double bass, the Guitarrón mexicano, and other Filipino-made instruments modeled and developed after the guitar.

5|$|Hydrogen's {{chemical}} properties {{are not very}} close {{to those of the}} alkali metals, which occupy group 1, and on that basis hydrogen is sometimes placed elsewhere: {{one of the most common}} alternatives is in group 17; one of the factors behind it is the strictly univalent predominantly non-metallic chemistry of hydrogen, and that of fluorine (the element placed on the top of group 17) is strictly univalent and non-metallic. Sometimes, to show how hydrogen has properties both corresponding to those of the alkali metals and the halogens, it may be shown in two columns simultaneously. Another suggestion is above carbon in group 14: placed that way, it fits well into the trends of increasing ionization potential values and electron affinity values, and is not too far from the electronegativity trend, even though hydrogen cannot show the tetravalence characteristic of the heavier group 14 elements. Finally, hydrogen is sometimes placed separately from any group; this is based on how general properties of hydrogen differ from that of <b>any</b> <b>group.</b> The other period 1 element, helium, is sometimes placed separately from <b>any</b> <b>group</b> as well. The property that distinguishes helium from the rest of the noble gases (even though the extraordinary inertness of helium is extremely close to that of neon and argon) is that in its closed electron shell, helium has only two electrons in the outermost electron orbital, while the rest of the noble gases have eight.|$|E
5|$|Johnson left Washington, D.C. {{just before}} Congress adjourned. He raised one {{thousand}} men, nominally {{part of the}} militia brigade under Kentucky Governor Isaac Shelby, but largely operating independently. He disciplined his men, required that every man have arms in prime condition and ready to hand, and hired gunsmiths, blacksmiths, and doctors at his own expense. He devised a new tactical system: when <b>any</b> <b>group</b> of men encountered the enemy, they were to dismount, take cover, and hold the enemy in place. All groups not in contact were to ride {{to the sound of}} firing, and dismount, surrounding the enemy when they got there. Between May and September, Johnson raided throughout the Northwest, burning the war supply centers of Indian villages, surrounding Indian fighting units and scattering them, killing some Indian warriors each time.|$|E
5|$|The {{player is}} free to join {{any one of the}} servile groups and share common goals, or remain unaligned. Geneforge can be {{completed}} without joining <b>any</b> <b>group.</b> Trajkov can be killed through combat or tricked into killing himself by using the Geneforge. He can also be aided in activating the device, if the player steals the shaper gloves from Goettsch. Goettsch offers the player fake shaper gauntlets, which do not protect Trajkov from the Geneforge's energy should he be convinced they are genuine shaping gloves. The player can complete the game by using the last boat on Sucia Island. The small vessel is moored in a guarded dock {{on the far side of}} the island. Finishing the game unlocks one of more than a dozen game endings, dependent on the player's actions during the game.|$|E

During the following day seventy suspects were rounded up, but no evidence of their involvement could be found.

However this was not enough for {{some members of the}} division, who attacked Jewish houses in Qastina and Be'er Tuvia, injuring some of the occupants.
