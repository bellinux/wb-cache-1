5|$|In 1976, after a {{prolonged}} investigation, Singapore's Internal Security Department arrested hundreds of MNLF members together with many documents, arms and explosives in <b>a</b> <b>sting</b> operation in Singapore. Twenty-three members were released after interrogation, seventeen were detained without trial under the Internal Security Act (ISA) and ten {{turned over to}} the Malaysian police for suspected involvement in terrorist activities in Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|In 2001 RIRA members {{travelled}} to Slovakia {{to procure}} arms, and {{were caught in}} <b>a</b> <b>sting</b> operation by the British security agency MI5. The men attempted to purchase five tonnes of plastic explosives, 2,000 detonators, 500 handguns, 200 rocket-propelled-grenades, and also wire-guided missiles and sniper rifles. Three men from County Louth were arrested and extradited to the UK and subsequently imprisoned for 30 years each after pleading guilty to conspiring to cause explosions and other charges.|$|E

The FBI used an undercover agent to meet with Jew and hand over the money.|$|E
5|$|Mantas {{evolved from}} bottom-dwelling stingrays, {{eventually}} developing more wing-like pectoral fins. M. birostris {{still has a}} vestigial remnant of <b>a</b> <b>sting</b> barb {{in the form of}} a caudal spine. The mouths of most rays lie on the underside of the head, while in mantas they are right at the front. Manta rays and devil rays are the only ray species that have evolved into filter feeders.|$|E
5|$|Archibald {{and colleagues}} {{suggested}} the life habits of Macabeemyrma ovata {{may have been}} similar to extant Myrmeciinae ants. The ant is large with long legs and elongated mandibles. It presumably had large eyes {{that were used to}} hunt for prey and navigation, and the ant was possibly equipped with <b>a</b> <b>sting.</b> Colonies most likely nested in the soil like most other Myrmeciinae, but like some Myrmecia species it is possible they were an arboreal nesting species. Workers were solitary foragers, foraging on the ground or onto vegetation while preying on arthropods. Workers most likely did not recruit other ants to food sources or lay down pheromone trails.|$|E
50|$|Only {{the females}} {{of the species}} have <b>a</b> <b>stinger,</b> and will {{normally}} sting only when provoked.|$|R

5|$|Emergency {{treatment}} {{is needed in}} a case of a severe allergic reaction. Before calling for help, laying a person down and elevating the legs is suggested. Depending on a patients needs, they will be given an EpiPen or an Anapen to use in case they are stung. In a scenario of experiencing anaphylaxis, further doses of adrenaline and intravenous infusions may be required. Some with severe anaphylaxis may suffer cardiac arrest and will need resuscitation. Inhalers may additionally be used in case a victim has asthma and experiences a reaction from <b>a</b> <b>sting.</b> The use of ACE inhibitors is not recommended, as it is known to increase the risk of anaphylaxis. Medications like antihistamines, H2 blockers, corticosteroids and anti-leukotrienes have no effect on anaphylaxis.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, an Australian ant allergy venom {{study was}} conducted, {{with the goal}} of {{determining}} which native Australian ants were associated with ant sting anaphylaxis. It showed that the jack jumper ant was responsible for the majority of patients' reactions to Myrmecia ant stings. Of the 265 patients who reacted to <b>a</b> <b>sting</b> from an ant belonging to the Myrmecia genus, 176 were from the jack jumper. 15 from M. nigrocincta and three from M. ludlowi, while 56 patients had reacted to other Myrmecia ants. The study concluded that four native species of Australian ants caused anaphylaxis. Apart from Myrmecia species, the green-head ant (Rhytidoponera metallica) was also responsible for several systemic reactions.|$|E
5|$|The {{police have}} little success with street-level arrests or with {{securing}} informants beyond Bubbles, a well known West Side drug addict. Eventually the investigation takes {{the direction of}} electronic surveillance, with wiretaps and pager clones to infiltrate the security measures taken by the Barksdale organization. This leads the investigation to areas the commanding officers had hoped to avoid, including political contributions. When an associate of Avon Barksdale is arrested by State Police and offers to cooperate, the commanding officers order the detail to undertake <b>a</b> <b>sting</b> operation to wrap up the case. Detective Kima Greggs is seriously hurt in the operation, triggering an overzealous response {{from the rest of}} the department. This causes the detail's targets to suspect that they are under investigation.|$|E

5|$|The {{remnants}} of Arthur re-intensified somewhat as it traversed The Maritimes; <b>a</b> <b>sting</b> jet with gusts of 65–80mph (100–130km/h) developed along the storm's backside. The former hurricane made an additional landfall {{in the region}} near Fundy National Park by 18:00UTC. By July6, the sting jet had dissipated, and steady weakening of the cyclone resumed as only a split jet provided upper-level support to the storm. Turning back to the northeast, Arthur moved through Labrador later that day. Once over the Labrador Sea, Arthur turned northwest while weakening before doubling back to the southeast. After weakening below gale-force strength, the extratropical system dissipated late on July9.|$|E
5|$|The series {{depicts the}} {{everyday}} lives of office {{employees in the}} Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, a Dunder Mifflin client is stolen by a rival salesman named Danny Cordray (Olyphant), and Michael Scott (Steve Carell), Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) decide to set up <b>a</b> <b>sting</b> in order to uncover his sales secret. Meanwhile, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) starts a band when he learns {{that one of his}} old college friends has a successful music career.|$|E
5|$|An extra in the film, Tyler Nelson, {{violated}} his nondisclosure {{agreement in}} an interview with The Edmond Sun on September 17, 2007, which was then picked up by the mainstream media. It is unknown if he remained in the final cut. At Nelson's request, The Edmond Sun subsequently pulled the story from its website. On October 2, 2007, a Superior Court order was filed finding that Nelson knowingly violated the agreement. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed. A number of production photos and sensitive documents pertaining to the film's production budget were also stolen from Spielberg's production office. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department set up <b>a</b> <b>sting</b> operation after being alerted by a webmaster that the thief might try to sell the photos. On October 4, 2007, the seller, 37-year-old Roderick Eric Davis, was arrested. He pleaded guilty to two felony counts and was sentenced to two years and four months in prison.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{elements}} of the character are drawn from the real Colbert's personal life. Both the real Colbert and the character were raised in Charleston, South Carolina; both are the youngest of 11 children; both played Dungeons & Dragons as teenagers; and both are practicing Roman Catholics. Colbert's own interest in and knowledge of religion, science fiction, and J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings story will often show through in the Report. His character has a chocolate portrait of Viggo Mortensen (who portrayed Aragorn in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings films) {{in a place of}} honor on his shelf; Mortensen briefly reprised the role of Aragorn in the Reports September 13, 2007 episode. He also owns <b>a</b> <b>Sting</b> sword presented to him by Peter Jackson.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{not having}} <b>a</b> <b>sting,</b> the {{porcupine}} ray {{is capable of}} injuring humans with its many sharp thorns. It is reportedly bold and tolerant of being approached closely underwater. The tough, thorny skin of this ray, made into a form of leather called shagreen, had many historical uses. In particular, {{it was used to}} cover the hilts of various melee weapons, as its extremely rough texture prevented slippage during battle. For example, the Japanese deemed it the only species whose skin was acceptable for covering sword grips. The Malayans used it to cover shields. The skin was also used ornamentally, such as by the Chinese, who dyed it and ground down the thorns to yield a mottled pattern. The native inhabitants of Funafuti Atoll used dried portions of the ray's tail as a rasp-like tool.|$|E
5|$|It is {{suggested}} that people should avoid jack jumpers, but this is difficult to do. Closed footwear (boots and shoes) along with socks reduce the chances of encountering <b>a</b> <b>sting,</b> but wearing thongs or sandals will put the person at risk. With this said, they are still capable of stinging through fabric, and can find their way through gaps in clothing. Most stings occur when people are gardening, so taking extra caution or avoiding gardening altogether is recommended. People can also avoid encountering jack jumpers by moving to locations where jack jumper populations are either low or absent, or eliminate nearby nests. Since Myrmecia ants have different venoms, people who are allergic to them are advised {{to stay away from}} all Myrmecia ants, especially to ones they have not encountered before.|$|E
