5|$|Black {{comes to}} in a {{hospital}} bed, tended to by his wife Catherine Black (Megan Gallagher). She explains to him what has happened, <b>and</b> <b>turns</b> <b>on</b> the evening news to show him the interview with his rescuer. However, watching Dees speak, Black quickly realises he is the bomber. The FBI locate Dees' home, but his electronic surveillance had alerted him long before, and he has escaped before they even arrive. However, as Black sits in his car, he receives a call from Dees, who has booby-trapped the car. The FBI are able to monitor this call with Dees' equipment. Dees tells Black that they will both soon be famous, letting Black {{know that he has}} a remote detonator for the car's explosives. Before he can use it, he is killed by a police marksman.|$|E
5|$|Discovering that Talbot {{has already}} confiscated the painting, Coulson agrees {{to meet with}} him after {{debriefing}} his team. Meanwhile, May follows Talbot, who is actually Hydra agent Sunil Bakshi using advanced technology to take on Talbot's voice and appearance. May is attacked by Agent 33, a former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent brainwashed into Hydra's service, who knocks May unconscious and uses the same device to take on her voice and appearance. Agent 33 goes to the Bus, a S.H.I.E.L.D. plane being used as a mobile command center, where she secretly plants a computer virus before meeting with Coulson. Further discussing his contingency plan, in which May would kill Coulson and replace him as Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., Coulson deduces that Agent 33 is not May <b>and</b> <b>turns</b> <b>on</b> her; this draws the attention of Bakshi, who was ready to torture May to gain S.H.I.E.L.D. secrets.|$|E

5|$|The highway enters Geneseo {{from the}} south, taking the name Genesee Street {{as it passes}} {{the western edge of}} the campus of SUNY Geneseo. At the edge of the campus, the route crosses the Genesee River and exits Geneseo. Past the river in the town of York, NY63 begins to curve {{northwest}} up and out of the Genesee River valley until it runs eastâ€“west once again at the hamlet of Piffard. The major junction in York is the community of Greigsville, where NY63 reconnects with NY36. This next section of highway has become a major shortcut for traffic heading to the Buffalo area, despite remaining a two-lane road through open rural country, since it is both physically shorter than going all the way to the New York State Thruway as well as toll-free. Most of this Buffalo-bound traffic follows NY36 north from Mount Morris <b>and</b> <b>turns</b> <b>on</b> to NY63 here. Signage along this route reflects this use.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} of Andalusian horses is extended, elevated, cadenced and harmonious, with {{a balance of}} roundness and forward movement. Poor elevation, irregular tempo, and excessive winging (sideways {{movement of}} the legs from the knee down) are discouraged by breed registry standards. Andalusians {{are known for their}} agility and their ability to learn difficult moves quickly, such as advanced collection <b>and</b> <b>turns</b> <b>on</b> the haunches. A 2001 study compared the kinematic characteristics of Andalusian, Arabian and Anglo-Arabian horses while moving at the trot. Andalusians were found to overtrack less (the degree to which the hind foot lands ahead of the front hoof print) but also exhibit greater flexing of both fore and hind joints, movement consistent with the more elevated way of going typically found in this breed. The authors of the study theorized that these characteristics of the breed's trot may contribute to their success as a riding and dressage horse.|$|E
25|$|The {{control of}} the time machine is the same in all three films. The {{operator}} is seated inside the DeLorean (except the first time, when a remote control is used), <b>and</b> <b>turns</b> <b>on</b> the time circuits, activating a unit containing multiple fourteen- and seven-segment displays that show the destination (red), present (green), and last-departed (yellow) dates and times. After entering a target date, the operator accelerates the car to , which activates the flux capacitor. As it accelerates, several coils around the body glow blue/white while a burst of light appears in front of it. Surrounded by electrical current similar to a Tesla coil, the whole car vanishes {{in a flash of}} white/blue light seconds later, leaving a pair of fiery tire tracks. A digital speedometer is attached to the dashboard so that the operator can accurately gauge the car's speed. Various proposals have been brought forth in the past by fans of the movie franchise for why the car has to be moving at 88mph to achieve temporal displacement, but actually the production crew chose the velocity simply because they liked how it looked on the speedometer.|$|E

500|$|An inter-title {{confirms}} Helen's {{death by}} announcing {{the parents have}} gone on [...] "a visit to their lost darling". The scene cuts to a grassy cemetery with lines of tombstones separated by a loose line of two trees. Helen's parents approach her grave, marked {{by a group of}} flowers and a temporary marker at the head. Shep follows behind and pauses by a tree as Helen's parents kneel and pause to grieve. The camera cuts to Shep, who appears sad with his eyes only half open. After the parents finish grieving, they stand up and walk to the stage left. Shep stays under the tree for a moment before approaching the grave. Through an overheard split, Shep is shown to be reminiscing about the party. The next scene shows Shep back home, lying on his side in apparent despair. His master tries to get Shep to eat some food, but the Collie refuses <b>and</b> <b>turns</b> <b>on</b> his side. His master pets him, confused as to what has his pet troubled so, but he gives up and departs.|$|E
500|$|Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) {{is being}} {{released}} from a military prison for unknown reasons. Upon leaving, he runs into Charles Widmore (Alan Dale) who reveals that he prevented communication between his daughter Penelope (Sonya Walger) and Desmond {{while he was in}} prison, and strongly warns Desmond against attempting to reform a relationship. Desmond, wanting to prove that he is not a coward, travels to the United States from the United Kingdom to train for a sailing race around the world, sponsored by Charles Widmore. He meets Libby (Cynthia Watros) in a cafe, and after a deep conversation, Libby gives Desmond a yacht owned by her late husband. While Desmond is training, Penny tracks him down and angrily questions him. (There is a moment in the background where Jack is seen arriving at the stadium to run.) Desmond tells her that he is determined to win Widmore's race and promises that he will return. However, while sailing, Desmond gets caught in a bad storm, and washes up on the island. He is rescued by a man in a yellow HAZMAT suit, Kelvin Inman (Clancy Brown) (who also is the American intelligence officer that releases Sayid in one of his flashbacks) who takes him to the [...] The two live together for three years before Desmond finds out that Inman is secretly planning on escaping the island using Desmond's boat. Desmond violently confronts Inman about this, accidentally killing him in the process. After almost letting the countdown timer run down, Desmond starts drinking liquor and contemplates suicide. Before he shoots himself however, he hears John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) banging on the hatch door, <b>and</b> <b>turns</b> <b>on</b> a light. Desmond then realizes that there is still hope and decides not to kill himself.|$|E

2500|$|Typical {{gradient}}-echo EPI uses two gradient coils {{within a}} slice, <b>and</b> <b>turns</b> <b>on</b> first one coil {{and then the}} other, tracing a set of lines in k-space. Turning on both gradient coils [...] can generate angled lines, which cover the same grid space faster. Both gradient coils can also be turned on in a specific sequence to trace a spiral shape in k-space. This spiral imaging sequence acquires images faster than gradient-echo sequences, but needs more math transformations (and consequent assumptions) since converting back to voxel space requires the data be in grid form (a set of equally spaced points in both horizontal and vertical directions).|$|E
2500|$|Tattoos is {{the third}} studio album by American singer Jason Derulo. The album was {{released}} on September 20, 2013 through Beluga Heights Records and Atlantic Records and its affiliated record labels. Incorporating a base core of R, pop and electronic dance music, Derulo wanted the album to be [...] "totally different" [...] from his previous albums and show the growth in his writing and his overall performance saying [...] "there are so many twists <b>and</b> <b>turns</b> <b>on</b> the album... It's important when someone thinks they've figured you out to flip them". A deluxe edition of the album featuring 3 bonus tracks, was released simultaneously alongside the eleven-track standard edition, which will only be made available in some European and Oceania countries.|$|E

A common action that is not shared with Windows is for the key to allow dragging a window around from any location without raising it. Otherwise it is often used much like Windows, with press+release popping up a primary menu (GNOME Shell bringing up the Activities Overview, Cinnamon pops up its main system menu normally docked at lower-left of screen), and with combinations with letters performing actions such as run-command, often with the shortcuts and actions copied from Windows. In the Compiz window manager, the Super key causes the scroll wheel to zoom {{in or out of}} any part of the desktop.|$|E
