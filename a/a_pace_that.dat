5|$|During 1928–1973, the Soviet Union {{was growing}} {{economically}} at <b>a</b> <b>pace</b> <b>that</b> would eventually {{catch up with}} the United States and Western Europe. This was true despite the advantage the United States had — the USSR was hampered by the effects of World War II, which had left most of Western USSR in ruins. In 1973, the process of catching up {{with the rest of the}} West came to an abrupt end, and 1973 was seen by some scholars as the start of the Era of Stagnation. The beginning of the stagnation coincided with a financial crisis in Western Europe and the U.S. By the early 1970s, the Soviet Union had the world's second largest industrial capacity, and produced more steel, oil, pig-iron, cement and tractors than any other country. Before 1973, the Soviet economy was expanding at faster rate than that of the American economy (albeit by a very small margin). The USSR also kept a steady pace with the economies of Western Europe. Between 1964 and 1973, the Soviet economy stood at roughly half the output per head of Western Europe and a little more than one third that of the U.S.|$|E

25|$|Mitchell Energy had a near-monopoly in {{drilling}} Barnett Shale {{wells in}} the early years of the field. In 1995, for instance, Mitchell completed 70 Barnett wells, while all other operators combined completed three. This was largely because the Barnett was marginal economically: according to a former CEO, Mitchell had invested about $250 million in the Barnett from 1981 to 1997, and had not recouped its costs. But after 1997, competitors realized that Mitchell had discovered how to extract gas profitably, they, too started buying leases and drilling Barnett wells, at <b>a</b> <b>pace</b> <b>that</b> Mitchell could not match. In 2001, for the first time, Mitchell completed fewer than half the Barnett Shale wells (258 wells, versus 260 by other operators).|$|E

Victims are to be informed of this immediately by law enforcement or medical service providers. Emergency rooms of many hospitals employ sexual assault nurse/forensic examiners (SAN/FEs) with specific training to care for those who have experienced a rape or sexual assault. They are able to conduct a focused medical-legal exam. If such a trained clinician is not available, the emergency department has a sexual assault protocol that has been established for treatment and the collection of evidence. Staff are also trained to explain the examinations in detail, the documentation and the rights associated with the requirement for informed consent.

25|$|The Indian Craton {{was once}} part of the supercontinent of Pangaea. At that time, what is now India's {{southwest}} coast was attached to Madagascar and southern Africa, and what is now its east coast was attached to Australia. During the Jurassic Period about 160 Ma (ICS 2004), rifting caused Pangaea to break apart into two supercontinents, namely Gondwana (to the south) and Laurasia (to the north). The Indian Craton remained attached to Gondwana, until the supercontinent began to rift apart about in the early Cretaceous, about 125 million years ago (ICS 2004). The Indian Plate then drifted northward toward the Eurasian Plate, at <b>a</b> <b>pace</b> <b>that</b> is the fastest known movement of any plate. It is generally believed that the Indian Plate separated from Madagascar about 90 Million years ago (ICS 2004), however some biogeographical and geological {{evidence suggests that the}} connection between Madagascar and Africa was retained at the time when the Indian Plate collided with the Eurasian Plate about 50 Million years ago (ICS 2004). This orogeny, which is continuing today, is related to closure of the Tethys Ocean. The closure of this ocean which created the Alps in Europe, and the Caucasus range in western Asia, created the Himalaya Mountains and the Tibetan Plateau in South Asia. The current orogenic event is causing parts of the Asian continent to deform westward and eastward {{on either side of the}} orogen. Concurrently with this collision, the Indian Plate sutured on to the adjacent Australian Plate, forming a new larger plate, the Indo-Australian Plate.|$|E

After the change of innings, Tasmanian openers Jim [...] "Snowy" [...] Atkinson and Alf Rushforth started their innings at 17:10 local time with Rushworth taking strike to Halcombe, who ran in from the pavilion end. Buttsworth called Halcombe from square leg on the third ball. Halcombe was bowling at such <b>a</b> <b>pace</b> <b>that</b> the wicket-keeper and slips were standing about 20 metres behind the stumps. Lonergan, standing at the bowler's end, also no-balled Halcombe for dragging his back foot over the crease. On the eighth ball, Buttsworth called Halcombe for another throw. After Alex Webster bowled an over from the other end, Halcombe continued from the pavilion end and was greeted with applause from the crowd. Halcombe sent down another two overs without incident.|$|E
500|$|Since Fear of a Black Planet {{was first}} released, {{it has been}} viewed by critics {{as one of the}} {{greatest}} and most important hip hop albums of all time, as well as a culturally significant work.

Alex Ross cited it as one of [...] "the most densely packed sonic assemblages in musical history", while [...] Q said it [...] "achieved the near impossible by being every bit as good as its predecessor". In the opinion of Kembrew McLeod, Public Enemy had worked with production equipment that would seem primitive decades later but still managed to invent new [...] "techniques and workarounds that electronics manufacturers never imagined".

[...] In passing through these two sharp curves, the British force lost thirty soldiers killed or wounded, and four colonial militia were also killed, including Captain Jonathan Wilson of Bedford, Captain Nathan Wyman of Billerica, Lt.

2500|$|Eminem {{purchased}} the Effigy Studio in Ferndale, Michigan, in 2007, and ended his {{working relationship with}} much of his former production team of the 54 Sound recording studio, including the Bass Brothers. In September 2007, Dr. Dre stated his intention to dedicate two months {{to the production of}} Relapse. Working with Dr. Dre allowed Eminem to concentrate on the processes of songwriting rather than the production, which was largely taken care of by Dre. The rapper justified his choice of using Dr. Dre {{for the vast majority of}} the production due to their long collaborative history and a musical [...] "chemistry" [...] only he and Dr. Dre shared. This allowed the rapper to pick the beats from Dr. Dre's catalog that challenged him rhythm-wise to experiment with different flows. The making of the album progressed at the Effigy Studio up to a year after, as recording sessions were then moved to Orlando, Florida in September 2008. By then, Eminem had begun to start writing verses again at such <b>a</b> <b>pace</b> <b>that</b> he often took more time to record the lyrics than write them. He credited sobriety for his new creative run, acknowledging that his mind was free of the clutter that [...] "blocked" [...] him during his drug abuse in the last years. Dr. Dre would start the song-writing process by giving a number of his beats on a CD to Eminem, who in a separate room in the studio would listen and select the ones he preferred and inspired him the most. Eminem would then write lyrics to the instrumentals, while Dr. Dre and his production staff continued to create new music. Once he felt he had written lyrics for enough songs, Eminem would dedicate an entire day to record his songs to the point that he would lose his voice for the following days. At that point, the rapper would then begin to write lyrics for new songs. The process continued for the next six months and allowed Eminem to have enough material for a second album, initially called Relapse2, which became Recovery.|$|E
