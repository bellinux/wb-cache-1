Later during the Islamic Golden Age, there was a logical debate among Islamic philosophers, logicians and theologians over whether the term Qiyas refers to <b>analogical</b> <b>reasoning,</b> inductive reasoning or categorical syllogism. Some Islamic scholars argued that Qiyas refers to inductive reasoning, which Ibn Hazm (994-1064) disagreed with, arguing that Qiyas does not refer to inductive reasoning, but refers to categorical syllogism in a real sense and <b>analogical</b> <b>reasoning</b> in a metaphorical sense. On the other hand, al-Ghazali (1058–1111) (and in modern times, Abu Muhammad Asem al-Maqdisi) argued that Qiyas refers to <b>analogical</b> <b>reasoning</b> in a real sense and categorical syllogism in a metaphorical sense.

It also comprises methods for establishing authenticity of hadith and for determining when the legal force of a scriptural passage is abrogated by a passage revealed at a later date. In addition to the Quran and sunnah, the classical theory of Sunni fiqh recognizes two other sources of law: juristic consensus (ijmaʿ) and <b>analogical</b> <b>reasoning</b> (qiyas). It therefore studies the application and limits of analogy, as well as the value and limits of consensus, along with other methodological principles, some of which are accepted by only certain legal schools. This interpretive apparatus is brought together under the rubric of ijtihad, which refers to a jurist's exertion in an attempt to arrive at a ruling on a particular question. The theory of Twelver Shia jurisprudence parallels that of Sunni schools with some differences, such as recognition of reason (ʿaql) as a source of law in place of qiyas and extension of the notion of sunnah to include traditions of the imams.|$|E

40|$|Computer-aided {{architectural}} design technology {{is now a}} crucial tool of modern architecture, {{from the viewpoint of}} higher productivity and better products. As technologies advance, the amount of information and knowledge that designers can apply to a project is constantly increasing. This requires development of more advanced knowledge acquisition technology to achieve higher functionality, flexibility, and efficient performance of the knowledge-based design systems in architecture. Human designers do not solve design problems from scratch, they utilize previous problem solving episodes for similar design problems as a basis for developmental decision making. This observation leads to the starting point of this research: First, we can utilize past experience to solve a new problem by detecting the similarities between the past problem and the new problem. Second, we can identify constraints and general rules implied by those similarities and the similar parts of similar situations. That is, by applying <b>analogical</b> and inductive <b>reasoning</b> we can advance the problem solving process. The main objective of this research is to establish the theory that (1) design process {{can be viewed as a}} learning process, (2) design innovation involves <b>analogical</b> and inductive <b>reasoning,</b> and (3) learning from a designer's previous design cases is necessary for the development of the next generation in a knowledge-based design system. This thesis draws upon results from several disciplines, including knowledge representation and machine learning in artificial intelligence, and knowledge acquisition in knowledge engineering, to investigate a potential design environment for future developments in computer-aided {{architectural design}}. This thesis contains three parts which correspond to the different steps of this research. Part I, discusses three different ways - problem solving, learning and creativity - of generating new thoughts based on old ones.

In Part III, three different methods of building design systems for solving an architectural design problem are compared rule-based, example-based, and case-based. Finally, conclusions are made based on the current implementation of the work, and possible future extensions of this research are described.

The creation of new ventures is a process by which entrepreneurs come to imagine the oppor-tunity for novel ventures, refine their ideas, and, after an initial investment, justify their ventures to relevant others to gain much-needed support and legitimacy (e. g., Alvarez & Barney, 2007; Mc-Mullen & Shepherd, 2006).

The derivational replay mechanism is discussed in some detail, and extensive results of the first full implementation are presented. These results show up to a large performance improvement in a simple transportation domain for structurally similar problems, and smaller improvements when less strict similarity metrics are used for problems that share partial structure in a process-job planning domain and in an extended version of the STRIPS robot domain...|$|R

Although most classical-era jurists recognized maslaha and maqasid as important legal principles, they held different views regarding the role they should play in Islamic law. Some jurists viewed them as auxiliary rationales constrained by scriptural sources and <b>analogical</b> <b>reasoning.</b> Others regarded them as an independent source of law, whose general principles could override specific inferences based on the letter of scripture.

In other words, ‘Ali's guidance was seen to be the expression of God's will and the Qur'anic message. This spiritual and absolute authority of ‘Ali was known as walayah and it was inherited by his successors, the Imams.
