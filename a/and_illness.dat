5|$|A {{subfield}} of {{the sociology}} of health <b>and</b> <b>illness</b> that overlaps with cultural sociology {{is the study of}} death, dying and bereavement, sometimes referred to broadly as {{the sociology of}} death.

40|$|Abstract: The {{purposes}} of this research were to determine the cost of {{occupational health and safety}} and work-related health problems, accidents, injuries <b>and</b> <b>illnesses</b> in rubber tappers by implementing a program in which rubber tappers were provided training on self-care in order to reduce and prevent work-related accidents, injuries <b>and</b> <b>illnesses.</b> Data on costs for healthcare, the prevention and the treatment of work-related accidents, injuries <b>and</b> <b>illnesses</b> were collected by interview using a questionnaire. The findings revealed that there was no relationship between what was spent on healthcare and the prevention of work-related accidents, injuries <b>and</b> <b>illnesses</b> <b>and</b> that spent on the treatment of work-related accidents, injuries <b>and</b> <b>illnesses.</b> The proportion of the injured subjects after the program implementation was significantly less than that before the program implementation (p< 0. 001). The level of pain after the program implementation was significantly less than that before the program implementation (p< 0. 05). The treatment costs incurred after the program implementation were significantly less than those incurred before the program implementation (p< 0. 001). It was demonstrated that this program raised the health awareness of rubber tappers. It strongly empowered the leadership in health promotion for the community...|$|R

40|$|The Survey of Occupational Injuries <b>and</b> <b>Illnesses</b> (SOII) uses a {{stratified}} sample design to produce State and National estimates for nonfatal workplace injuries <b>and</b> <b>illnesses.</b> Private industry estimates are produced separately for 42 States, the District of Columbia, and three U.

Additionally, estimates for injuries <b>and</b> <b>illnesses</b> for State <b>and</b> local government workers are available for 26 of these States. Future plans will expand the coverage to national estimates for the State and local governments beginning with data released in 2009.

5|$|The {{sociology}} of health <b>and</b> <b>illness</b> {{focuses on the}} social effects of, and public attitudes toward, illnesses, diseases, mental health and disabilities.

In Britain, sociology was introduced into the medical curriculum following the Goodenough Report (1944).|$|E

Bolesław returned home after the war but died two months later from exhaustion <b>and</b> <b>illness.</b> Lech's mother, Feliksa Wałęsa (née Kamieńska; 1916–1975), has been credited with shaping her son's beliefs and tenacity.|$|E
5|$|Several StarCraft novels also feature Raynor; he is a {{prominent}} character in Liberty's Crusade, which reveals that Raynor {{had a wife}} and son.

Afterward, Raynor's wife Liddy dies {{after a period of}} depression <b>and</b> <b>illness.</b> As a result, Raynor immerses himself in his work and develops a penchant for operating alone. He is also the primary protagonist in Queen of Blades, a novelization of the events of StarCrafts Episode II in which Raynor attempts to rescue Sarah Kerrigan from the Zerg on Char and eventually allies with the high templar Tassadar and renegade dark templar Zeratul, facilitating the reconciliation between the two estranged Protoss.|$|E
5|$|Teachers of the {{doctrine}} focus on personal empowerment, promoting a positive view of the spirit and body. They maintain that Christians have been given power over creation because they {{are made in the}} image of God and teach that positive confession allows Christians to exercise dominion over their souls and material objects around them. Leaders of the movement view the atonement as providing for the alleviation of sickness, poverty, and spiritual corruption; poverty <b>and</b> <b>illness</b> are cast as curses which can be broken by faith and righteous actions. There are, however, some prosperity churches which seek a more moderate or reformed paradigm of prosperity. Kirbyjon Caldwell, pastor of a Methodist mega-church, supports a theology of abundant life, teaching prosperity for the whole human being, which he sees as a path to combating poverty.|$|E

5|$|Also in {{the region}} was the British 74-gun ship of the line HMS Swiftsure under Captain Benjamin Hallowell, {{a veteran of the}} Battle of the Nile three years earlier. Swiftsure was passing slowly along the North African coast after being {{detached}} from Keith's fleet to join Warren's squadron off Malta, escorting a small convoy en route. Hallowell's ship was understrength as more than 80 men had been removed from the ship for service in Egyptian waters <b>and</b> <b>illness</b> rendered another 59 unfit for duty, while the vessel itself was in a poor state of repair and leaking badly. Progress had been slow, and a northeasterly wind had also significantly delayed Hallowell's passage. When he learned from a passing vessel that there was a French squadron {{in the region}}, he ordered the convoy to separate and sailed for Malta alone in an effort to join Warren more rapidly and warn him of Ganteaume's return. At 03:30 on 24 June his lookouts sighted sails to the southwest. Hallowell immediately assumed that the distant ships were the enemy and he turned away from the French and tacked into the wind. By 05:30, lookouts on the nearest French ships, the ships of the line Jean Bart and Constitution had spotted the distant British vessel and were ordered to give chase.|$|E
5|$|For the English {{winter of}} 1930–31, Lee took on {{positions}} at both St. Andrew's College and Rhodes University, both in Grahamstown in South Africa. The MCC were touring that winter, and suffered heavily with injuries <b>and</b> <b>illness.</b> No fewer than seven players were missing at various stages, and the England captain, Percy Chapman, requested that Lee be excused from his coaching duties {{to join up}} with the touring party. Having believed he had secured this permission, {{he made his first}} appearance against Natal, scoring 14 runs in his only innings. He played in three further tour matches, twice making scores in the forties, but not reaching a half-century during the tour. His only Test appearance came in the fourth Test between England and South Africa. Lee opened the innings alongside Bob Wyatt and scored 18 and 1 in his two innings of the match, which finished a draw. During the match, the MCC were contacted by one of the schools he had been coaching at, which claimed that Lee had broken his contract by leaving without permission. Lee argued vehemently against these claims, citing the fact that the sportsmaster at the school had told Jack White that he had permission to leave, but the MCC were unmoved, and refused to issue Lee his England cap and blazer until he had apologised. Lee felt he had no need to apologise, and never received either cap or blazer, though small compensation {{came in the form of}} an England touring tie, which Jack Hobbs gave to him.|$|E
5|$|On {{the return}} to Australia, the team stopped on the Indian subcontinent to play their first Tests on Pakistani and Indian soil respectively. In a short tour, the four Tests were the only fixtures. Harvey failed to pass double figures in a one off Test against Pakistan in Karachi, the first between the two countries. Moving to India, he scored 140 in the drawn Second Test in Bombay, scoring runs all around the ground. Due to {{injuries}} <b>and</b> <b>illness</b> {{to many of the}} bowlers, the Australians were unable to dismiss their hosts twice. In the final match, Australia were in trouble after taking a 41-run first innings lead. In the second innings they were struggling on a sticky wicket caused by flooding, but made 69 out of 9/189 in the low-scoring Third Test in Calcutta to help Australia to a 2–0 series win. He ended with 253 runs at 63.25 for the series. His performances on the subcontinent were marked by his aggressive footwork in moving down to meet the pitch of the ball. After seven months away, the Australians returned home.|$|E
