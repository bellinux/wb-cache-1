It formed out of a stationary trough of low pressure on September 18 near the coast of North Carolina. The system quickly reached tropical storm status, and Danielle looped to the west due to a change in steering currents. Tropical Storm Danielle reached a peak of 65mph (105km/h) winds before weakening <b>and</b> <b>hitting</b> the Delmarva Peninsula. The storm quickly dissipated over land.|$|E

It moved northward and quickly intensified, reaching peak winds of 70mph (120km/h) before weakening <b>and</b> <b>hitting</b> Oaxaca as a tropical depression. In Mexico, El Salvador, and Guatemala, the system brought heavy rainfall, which killed 18 people and caused flooding and damage.

It interacted with Hurricane Pauline, which caused Olaf {{to turn to the}} southeast and later to the north to strike Mexico again, finally dissipating on October 12.|$|E

5|$|Baggio was {{initially}} a regular squad member under Dino Zoff, appearing {{as a substitute}} in two Euro 2000 qualifying matches, in a 2‚Äì0 win against Wales in 1998, setting up a goal for Vieri; and in a 1‚Äì1 draw against Belarus in 1999. Baggio made a starting appearance in a 0‚Äì0 friendly draw against Norway in 1999, creating several chances, helping to set-up a goal which was ruled offside, <b>and</b> <b>hitting</b> the post from a free-kick. However, he was later dropped from the squad after Inter's poor 1998‚Äì99 season, {{and he was not}} called up for the Euro 2000 finals due to his limited playing time during the 1999‚Äì2000 season, and accusations made against his fitness. Zoff centred his squad around younger offensive players, such as Francesco Totti, Alessandro Del Piero, Stefano Fiore, Marco Delvecchio, Filippo Inzaghi and Vincenzo Montella.

5|$|Current {{research}} suggests that the rates of self-harm are much higher among young people with the average age of onset between 14 and 24. The earliest reported incidents of self-harm are in children between 5 and 7 years old. In the UK in 2008 rates of self-harm in young people could be as high as 33%. In addition there appears to be an increased risk of self-harm in college students than among the general population. In a study of undergraduate students in the US, 9.8% of the students surveyed indicated that they had purposefully cut or burned themselves on at least one occasion in the past. When the definition of self-harm was expanded to include head-banging, scratching oneself, <b>and</b> <b>hitting</b> oneself along with cutting and burning, 32% of the sample said they had done this. In Ireland, a study found that instances of hospital-treated self-harm were much higher in city and urban districts, than in rural settings. The CASE (Child & Adolescent Self-harm in Europe) study suggests that the life-time risk of self-injury is ~1:7 for women and ~1:25 for men.|$|E
5|$|Freese {{emerged as}} a {{potential}} starter when an injury seemed likely to put Cardinals starting third baseman Troy Glaus {{on the disabled list}} {{at the beginning of the}} 2009 season. Freese made his MLB debut on Opening Day of the 2009 season, coming off the bench <b>and</b> <b>hitting</b> a go-ahead sacrifice fly in the Cardinals' home opener against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Freese was expected to be the team's starting third baseman, but was quickly passed over by Brian Barden and Joe Thurston. He was optioned to Triple-A Memphis on April 20, 2009 to make room for newly acquired reliever Blaine Boyer. He later had surgery to repair a left ankle injury that hampered him during spring training. He missed two months of the season. He was activated and assigned to the Springfield Cardinals of the Double-A Texas League in late July, before he was assigned to Memphis. He led the Memphis Redbirds to a PCL division championship. He was recalled in the September call-up on September 23, 2009. Freese played only 17 games for the Cardinals in 2009, in addition to 56 games for Triple-A Memphis.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs {{missed a}} large part of the 1927 season with a {{combination}} of illness and injury. In between his absences, he performed well, although he was left out of the Gentlemen v Players match. He scored 1,641 runs at 52.93, including seven centuries. He began the 1928 season with four centuries in the first month, but another leg injury kept him out of cricket for six weeks.

In his first game, he and Sutcliffe shared a century partnership; in the third, Hobbs scored 159, having opened with a 155-run partnership with Sutcliffe. England won the series 3‚Äì0.
