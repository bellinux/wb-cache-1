5|$|The clip {{opens with}} Lopez and her love {{interest}} conversing {{on the side}} walk {{in front of a}} shop window. These scenes are intercut with that of suspicious men in a van, observing Lopez and her lover. Later, Lopez and her lover split and she starts singing as she walks down the street. She goes inside a boutique and enters through at a secret door. As she enters, she takes off a wig and changes her clothing. She enters in a room where there are pictures of her lover scattered across a table. These scenes are intercut with scenes of Lopez and her lover laying in a grass. As the video progresses, Lopez is seen sad, accompanied with her love interest and his friend in an apartment; they are observing from a window with binoculars. It is revealed that the men {{from the beginning of the}} video are FBI officers and they <b>are</b> <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> building abruptly. They break into Lopez and her lover's apartment and arrest him. In the end, it is revealed that Lopez is an undercover FBI agent who surrenders her boyfriend.|$|E
25|$|Where {{the doorway}} is wide enough, many Ashkenazi Jews tilt the mezuzah {{so that the}} top slants toward the room into which the door opens. This is done to {{accommodate}} the variant opinions of Rashi and of his grandson, Rabbeinu Tam, {{as to whether it}} should be placed vertically (Rashi) or horizontally (Rabbeinu Tam), and also to imply that God and the Torah (which the mezuzah symbolizes) <b>are</b> <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> room. The compromise solution has been suggested by Rabbi Jacob ben Asher.|$|E

25|$|One shift {{caused by}} multi-literate environments is that private-sphere texts {{are being made}} more public. The private sphere is {{described}} as {{an environment in which}} people have a sense of personal authority and are distanced from institutions, such as the government. The family and home are considered {{to be a part of}} the private sphere. Family photographs are an example of multimodality in this sphere. Families take pictures (sometimes captioning them) and compile them in albums that are generally meant to be displayed to other family members or audiences that the family allows. These once private albums <b>are</b> <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> public environment of the Internet more often due to the rapid development and adoption of technology.|$|E
25|$|Government, {{bankruptcy}} and general auctions are amongst {{the most common}} auctions to be found today. A government auction is simply an auction held {{on behalf of a}} government body generally at a general sale. Here one may find a vast range of materials that have to be sold by various government bodies, for example: HM Customs & Excise, the Official Receiver, the Ministry of Defence, local councils and authorities, liquidators, as well as material put up for auction by companies and members of the public. Also in this group you will find auctions ordered by executors who <b>are</b> <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> assets of individuals who have perhaps died in testate (those who have died without leaving a will), or in debt. One of the most interesting bodies to look out for at auction is HM Customs & Excise who may be entering at auction various items seized from smugglers, fraudsters and racketeers.|$|E
25|$|The Alford plea arose {{out of the}} 1970 {{case before}} the Supreme Court of the United States, North Carolina v. Alford, where the Court ruled that the {{defendant}} could be allowed to enter a guilty plea while still maintaining innocence. According to the United States Department of Justice, in 2000 {{a greater percentage of}} State inmates made use of the plea than Federal inmates. The state courts of Indiana, Michigan, and New Jersey do not allow usage of the plea. It has been used in other states, and in application of the plea process the courts require the plea to be of a voluntary nature and based on factual evidence. The courts make an effort to determine defendants <b>are</b> <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> plea by their own choice, {{and that there is a}} factual basis for the plea; they accomplish this by questioning the defendant about their choice and the prosecution about the potential case against the defendant. Once entered, the plea is treated as a standard guilty plea.|$|E

25|$|In general The Mysterious Affair at Styles is a {{considerable}} achievement for a first-off author. The country-house-party murder is a stereotype in the detective-story genre, which Christie makes no great use of. Not her sort of occasion, at least later in life, and perhaps not really her class. The family party is much more in her line, {{and this is what}} we have here. This is one of the few Christies anchored in time and space: we are in Essex, during the First World War. The family is kept together under one roof by the exigencies of war and of a matriarch demanding rather than tyrannical – not one of her later splendid monsters, but a sympathetic and lightly shaded characterisation. If the lifestyle of the family still seems to us lavish, even wasteful, nevertheless we have the half sense that we are witnessing the beginning of the end of the Edwardian summer, that the era of country-house living has entered its final phase. Christie takes advantage of this end-of-an-era feeling in several ways: while she uses the full range of servants and their testimony, a sense of decline, of break-up is evident; feudal attitudes exist, but they crack easily. The marriage of the matriarch with a mysterious nobody is the central out-of-joint event in an intricate web of subtle changes. The family is lightly but effectively characterised, and on the outskirts of the story are the villagers, the small businessmen, and the surrounding farmers – the nucleus of Mayhem Parva. It is, too, a very clever story, with clues and red herrings falling thick and fast. We <b>are</b> <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> age when plans of the house were an indispensable aid to the aspirant solver of detective stories, and when cleverness was more important than suspense. But here we come to a problem that Agatha Christie has not yet solved, for cleverness over the long length easily becomes exhausting, and too many clues tend to cancel each other out, as far as reader interest is concerned. These were problems which Conan Doyle never satisfactorily overcame, but which Christie would.".|$|E
500|$|The movie Mayor West is {{watching}} {{on the television}} is Romancing the Stone. The music played in the background during the black people's parade is taken almost verbatim from the film adaptation of the 1975 musical The Wiz where, in the final number of the film, they sing [...] "Brand New Day" [...] {{when it came to}} the absence of most of the Quahog Police Department. The two songs playing in the background at the junior prom are [...] "Hold On to the Nights" [...] by Richard Marx and [...] "Why" [...] by Annie Lennox. The music used in the background and the academy's logo when Peter, Quagmire and Cleveland <b>are</b> <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> police training grounds is a reference to that used in the Police Academy. The scene where Meg plays Madame Butterfly while turning the lamp on and off and the line [...] "I will not be ignored, Brian" [...] is a reference to 1987 thriller Fatal Attraction. The entire scene in the hotel where Meg is discovered attempting to seduce Brian is a reference to The King of Comedy, which MacFarlane notes as one of his favorite movies. When Peter Griffin steals a giraffe from the zoo, he names the giraffe Allison Janney.

However, many of the biofuels that were being supplied in 2008 (using the first-generation biofuel production procedure) have been criticised for their adverse impacts on the natural environment, food security, and land use. In 2008, the Nobel-prize winning chemist Paul J. Crutzen published findings that the release of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in the production of biofuels means that overall they contribute more to global warming than the fossil fuels they replace.O release from agro-biofuel production negates global warming reduction by replacing fossil fuels ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Diamond Age" [...] is an {{extension}} of labels for archeological time periods that take central technological materials to define an entire era of human history, such as the Stone Age, the Bronze Age or the Iron Age. Technological visionaries such as Eric Drexler and Ralph Merkle, both of whom receive an honorary mention in The Diamond Age, have argued that if nanotechnology develops the ability to manipulate individual atoms at will, it will become possible to simply assemble diamond structures from carbon atoms, materials also known as diamondoids. Merkle states: [...] "In diamond, then, a dense network of strong bonds creates a strong, light, and stiff material. Indeed, just as we named the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and the Steel Age after the materials that humans could make, we might call the new technological epoch we <b>are</b> <b>entering</b> <b>the</b> Diamond Age". In the novel, a near future vision of our world, nanotechnology has developed precisely to this point, which enables the cheap production of diamond structures.|$|E
