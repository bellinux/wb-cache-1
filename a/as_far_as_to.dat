5|$|King Philip V and Frederick IV of Denmark paid Violante Beatrice visits in 1703 and 1709, respectively. The former {{chose to}} ignore {{the other members of}} the Tuscan Royal Family and reluctantly deigned only speak to her. The latter, on the other hand, was taken with Violante, going <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> refuse to leave the room while she was {{changing}} clothes.|$|E
5|$|After seducing Drusus' wife Livilla, Sejanus {{convinced}} {{her that he}} loved her and went <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> divorce his own wife, Apicata. They involved Livilla's physician, Eudemus, whom they met in secret for some time. With the help of Livilla, Drusus was poisoned and died of what passed as natural causes on 14 September 23. Cassius Dio says the actions of Sejanus were revealed in a letter by Apicata following his death in October 31.|$|E

5|$|During {{the filming}} and {{promotion}} of Daft Punk's Electroma, the duo {{went to great lengths}} to avoid showing their faces. While on the set of the film, the duo chose to be interviewed with their backs turned. As reported on October 2006, the band went <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> wear black cloth over their heads during a televised interview. During this interview they noted that the use of cloth bags in particular had been a spontaneous decision, reflecting their willingness to experiment with their perceived image in the media.|$|E
5|$|Formed in late 1853, the Conciliation cabinet {{faced the}} Parliament {{only when it}} {{gathered}} in May 1854. Paraná presented a bill to reform the Code of Criminal Procedure, which had already been reformed in 1841. In search of support, Paraná went <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> aid Liberal candidates in the 1854 provincial elections. The opposition by most saquaremas to this judicial reform was so fierce that a year later, Paraná (who had been raised from Viscount to Marquis in late 1854) backed down and implicitly withdrew the bill.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the keys}} to the game, {{according}} to ESPN.com blogger Matt Fortuna, was to stop the run. Both teams had 1,000+ yard rushers (Zach Line for SMU, Robbie Rouse for Fresno State), but SMU's rush defense (24th in FBS) was better than Fresno State's (73rd in FBS). Many analysts predicted that Fresno State would emerge victorious, some going <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> predict a blowout, but said that for SMU to emerge victorious, they would have to win the field position battle as well as create turnovers.|$|E

In his analysis, the hoax was designed to serve the political purposes of both Heraclius and his former foe, recently turned ally and co-father-in-law, Persian general and soon-to-become king, Shahrvaraz.|$|E
5|$|Through his father, Prince Dom João (later King Dom JoãoVI), Pedro was {{a member}} of the House of Braganza (Portuguese: Bragança) and a {{grandson}} of King Dom PedroIII and Queen Dona (Lady) MariaI of Portugal, who were uncle and niece as well as husband and wife. His mother, Doña Carlota Joaquina, was the daughter of King Don CarlosIV of Spain. Pedro's parents had an unhappy marriage. Carlota Joaquina was an ambitious woman, who always sought to advance Spain's interests, even to the detriment of Portugal's. Reputedly unfaithful to her husband, she went <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> plot his overthrow in league with dissatisfied Portuguese nobles.|$|E
5|$|As {{happened}} to {{other members of}} the royal family, Boril's ascension forced Strez and his closest supporters to flee, in that case to neighbouring Serbia, where he was welcomed by the reigning Stefan Nemanjić (1196–1228) in 1207 or early 1208. Even though Boril requested the extradition of Strez to Bulgaria, the Serbian ruler hoped to use Strez as a puppet in gaining Bulgarian-held territory. Stefan believed that Strez's royal ancestry and imperial aspirations would make it much easier to impose Serbian rule over Macedonia, Kosovo and Braničevo, as well as Belgrade, all captured by Bulgaria under Kaloyan. At the same time, Boril was unable to take military action against Strez and his Serbian patron, as he had suffered a major defeat {{at the hands of the}} Latins at Plovdiv. Stefan went <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> become a blood brother of Strez in a ceremony which Stefan was hoping would secure Strez's loyalty.|$|E

5|$|In late December {{and early}} January, student demonstrations in South Vietnam were held against {{neutralism}} and French President Charles de Gaulle, who advocated {{the removal of}} the Americans and negotiations between the two Vietnams. The Council of Notables had accused the provisional government and junta of having an uncertain stance on the issue and went <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> recommend that South Vietnam suspend diplomatic relations with France. The rumors and crisis heightened when a reputed French agent, Lieutenant Colonel Tran Dinh Lan suddenly returned to Saigon after several years in France. He had served in both the French and Vietnamese National Army and had brought with him several million US dollars worth of South Vietnamese piasters. Lan moved into the home of one of Kim's top aides, fuelling speculation that French agents were being systematically brought into the capital. Such rumors served to spread the belief that a French-sponsored neutralist deal was imminent and gave the conspirators an opportunity to act.|$|E
5|$|In this situation, {{the court}} had decided in {{previous}} cases that immigration detention, {{for the purposes of}} processing and removal, did not infringe on Chapter III. Al-Kateb argued that if indeed the provisions of the Migration Act extended <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> allow the indefinite detention of people like him, then it would have gone beyond those valid purposes and would infringe Chapter III. That is, non-judicial detention is permitted for the purposes of facilitating the removal of unlawful non-citizens, and if the prospects of removal are remote or impracticable for the reasonably foreseeable future, then the detention can no longer be considered to be for the purpose of removal. Al-Kateb's argument in this respect relied on a decision of the Federal Court in another case, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Al Masri, in which a Full Court of the Federal Court found that a person in a very similar situation to Al-Kateb was entitled to be released.|$|E
5|$|Mongolia's central {{geographical}} {{position on}} the Asian continent was an important reason why {{it was able to}} play such a large role in the trade system. The Mongol army was easily able to assert strong rule throughout most of the empire. The military ensured that supply lines and trade routes flowed smoothly; permanent garrisons were established along trade routes to protect the travellers on these routes. Complex local systems of taxation and extortion that were prevalent before Mongol rule were abolished to ensure the smooth flow of merchants and trade through the empire. A system of weights-and-measures was also standardised. To make the voyage on the trade routes less harrowing, the Mongols went <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> plant trees along the roads to shade the merchants and travellers in the summer months; stone pillars were used to mark the roads where trees could not grow.|$|E

5|$|On 22 July 2010, reports {{surfaced}} {{suggesting that}} English club Newcastle United {{were looking to}} sign Ben Arfa. After being questioned, Newcastle's manager Chris Hughton denied the reports. Five days later, Ben Arfa's agent declared that Newcastle were indeed interested in the player, along with German clubs Hoffenheim and Werder Bremen, Turkish club Galatasaray, and Italian club A.C. Milan. On 9 August, a season-long loan with an option to make the move permanent was reportedly being negotiated between the two clubs. However, a loan-fee for the deal {{could not be reached}} with Newcastle offering £650,000; £350,000 short of what Marseille wanted. On 12 August, Marseille president Jean-Claude Dassier announced that Ben Arfa would not be moving to Newcastle and even went <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> say that an offer from the club had not even existed.|$|E
5|$|The {{rulers of}} the princely states were not uniformly {{enthusiastic}} about integrating their domains into independent India. Some, such as the rulers of Bikaner and Jawhar, were motivated to join India out of ideological and patriotic considerations, but others insisted {{that they had the}} right to join either India or Pakistan, to remain independent, or form a union of their own. Bhopal, Travancore and Hyderabad announced that they did not intend to join either dominion. Hyderabad went <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> appoint trade representatives in European countries and commencing negotiations with the Portuguese to lease or buy Goa to give it access to the sea, and Travancore pointed to the strategic importance to western countries of its thorium reserves while asking for recognition. Some states proposed a subcontinent-wide confederation of princely states, as a third entity in addition to India and Pakistan. Bhopal attempted to build an alliance between the princely states and the Muslim League to counter the pressure being put on rulers by the Congress.|$|E
5|$|Though the Earl {{had come}} out as homosexual, on 14 September 1984 he married Francesca Fisher, then 20, the day before his 30th birthday. In sharp {{contrast}} to the Earl, Fisher was a teetotaler and a vegetarian, and he hoped she would be a calming influence on his life. He also wanted to give up drug use and homosexuality and produce an heir. His father refused to attend the wedding, going <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> place an advertisement in The Times that he had a prior engagement. The marriage lasted for three years, but quickly fell apart after he started freebasing cocaine and using rent boys. During the marriage, the Earl accidentally drove a car half way over a cliff while Francesca was a passenger. They had no children. He later formed a close friendship with James Whitby, who became a companion for most of the remainder of his life.|$|E

5|$|Yen {{described}} the {{role as the}} most emotionally and mentally difficult in his career. He spent months preparing for the role by going on a strict diet which consisted of eating one meal a day, training in Wing Chun, and learning more about Ip Man through his two sons. This was all {{in the hopes of}} portraying an erudite and cultured Ip Man, as well as bringing out the special traits of Wing Chun. Yen even went <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> stay in character after filming, wearing his costume and changing his voice and movement patterns. While rehearsing a fight scene, Yen was reportedly injured when an axe wielder accidentally slashed the side of his left eye. Yen also had a masseur on set as he could not raise his right shoulder due to an injury.|$|E
5|$|As {{she grew}} older Betsy {{suffered}} from numerous illnesses, the exact natures {{of which are}} not recorded but which {{are known to have}} caused William great concern. William began to become paranoid that Betsy would marry and leave his service, in 1835 going <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> have her sign an affidavit that she would never leave him. In 1843 his older brother Charles, a successful planter in Java, returned to England after over 30 years abroad. William became deeply suspicious that Betsy was becoming too close to Charles, a suspicion intensified when Charles took her on a visit to Holland and the Rhine; Charles returned to Java in 1845. In around 1844 Betsy struck up a close relationship with the pen manufacturer and art collector Joseph Gillott, one of William's regular customers who owned some of his pictures. Gillott was married with children, and the closeness of their relationship caused William concern. In 1848, William retired to York leaving Betsy alone in his London apartment; although aware that Betsy was considering marriage he was confident that he could persuade her to come to York and live with him in his retirement. Betsy did eventually join him in York, and was present at his death.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{signed for}} Stoke City in September 1966 after telling manager Tony Waddington {{that he was}} going to sign a {{contract}} at another club; though Waddington was not keen on Smith's hard-tackling style, he did not want to lose the young player. At the age of 18 he faced Leeds United's FWA Footballer of the Year Bobby Collins in a reserve match, and despite Collins going <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> punch him in the face Smith managed to last the entire match without backing down in an extremely physical contest. However, for a period Waddington banned Smith from playing against first-team players in training as he feared Smith would injure one of his players. He made his first-team debut in the Football League against Arsenal in September 1968, and was given the task of man-marking Bobby Gould. He gave away a penalty after fouling Jon Sammels, which Terry Neill converted for the only goal of the match, but otherwise made a solid debut. However, in his second appearance he gave away two penalties in a 3–1 defeat away to Ipswich Town, and had to wait five months for another first-team appearance. In March 1969, Alan Bloor picked up a knock and Smith returned to the starting line-up in a 5–1 defeat to Leeds, failing in his task to man mark Mick Jones, who claimed a hat-trick. Despite the poor start to his senior career, he managed to finish the 1968–69 season with 14 First Division appearances to his name, and was occasionally used as an emergency striker.|$|E
