60|$|Joe laughed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> a good joke, and {{sat down}} as if the fire was quite as welcome as the friend.|$|E
6000|$|HON. Doth she {{not wear}} a great purse by her side, {{and is not}} her hand often in it, {{fingering}} her money, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> her heart's delight? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you ever}} come back I'll tell you," [...] laughed Rose as he danced away into the wrong corner, bumped smartly against another gentleman, and {{returned}} as soberly <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the proper figure.|$|E
60|$|Alderling stopped, {{and smoked}} definitively, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> the end.|$|R
60|$|She made an {{impatient}} movement, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> a very insignificant matter.|$|R
60|$|Henchard, without answering, {{shook his}} head <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> rather a {{question}} for Newson himself than for him.|$|R
6000|$|Zoe (known to her father, by vulgar abbreviation, as [...] "Zo") took Mr. Gallilee's stumpy red hand, {{and held}} hard by it <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the {{one way in}} which a dull child could rouse herself, with a {{prospect}} of success.|$|E
60|$|That {{allusion to}} the Captain, now on his return trip, made Mrs. Jessie sob in her napkin, and set the boys cheering. Then, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> not {{sensation}} enough, Archie suddenly dashed out of the room, {{as if he had}} lost his wits.|$|E
6000|$|... "I like th' hills best," [...] said Seth, [...] "when {{the clouds}} are {{over your head}} {{and you see the}} sun shining ever so far off, over the Loamford way, as I've often done o' late, on the stormy days. It seems to me <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> heaven where there's always joy and sunshine, though this life's dark and cloudy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. And there's a tobacconist's now," [...] said Trannel, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> what he {{had been}} looking for all along. [...] "I want some cigarettes." ...|$|R
60|$|It held up its chain at arm's length, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> {{the cause}} of all its unavailing grief, and flung it heavily upon the ground again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because {{you fell}} in love!" [...] growled Scrooge, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> {{the only one}} {{thing in the world}} more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. [...] "Good afternoon!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, Basil, I think I {{will let}} you go alone," [...] said my wife. [...] "But {{try to find out}} how it is with them. Don't be so terribly straightforward, and let it look <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> what you came for. Don't make the {{slightest}} advance towards their confidence. But do let them open up if they will." ...|$|E
6000|$|This is the especial {{curse of}} our day, that {{religion}} does not mean, as it used, {{the service of}} God--the being like God and showing forth God's glory. No, religion means nowadays the art of getting to heaven when we die, and saving our own miserable souls, and getting God's wages without doing God's work--as if that was godliness, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> anything but selfishness, as if selfishness was any the better for being everlasting selfishness! ...|$|E
60|$|Steve tore his hair, metaphorically speaking, for he {{clutched}} his cherished top-knot, and wildly dishevelled it, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the heaviest penance he could inflict upon himself at such short notice. Charlie laid himself out flat, melodramatically begging {{someone to take}} him away and hang him; but Archie, who felt worst of all, said nothing except to vow within himself that he would read to Mac till his own eyes were as red as a dozen emery bags combined.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{care what}} they think of you," [...] Gavin said, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> decisive, [...] "and I tell you I will not allow you to repeat this freak." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'People {{are more}} {{forgiving}} than I could have hoped. Mr. Calcott has offered me this, in the kindest way; and <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> not enough, see what poor little Clara says.' ...|$|R
60|$|His {{companion}} put {{his head}} out of window for a moment, and drawing it in again, observed (<b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> his cause of anxiety), <b>that</b> the boy <b>was</b> drenched to the skin.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's father, Benny; don't {{you know}} me?" [...] asked the man, {{with an odd}} sort of choke in his voice, as he thrust the dog away, and held out both hands to the boy. Down dropped the nuts, and crying, [...] "Oh, Daddy, Daddy!" [...] Ben cast himself {{into the arms of}} the shabby {{velveteen}} coat, while poor Sanch tore round them in distracted circles, barking wildly, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the only way in which he could vent his rapture.|$|E
6000|$|This was awkward for Tommy. [...] "She {{believes}} I meant that," [...] {{he cried}} hoarsely. [...] "Grizel believes that of me! I have behaved since then <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> what I meant, have I? I meant {{only that it}} would be hard on me if Elspeth learned of our love at the very moment when this man is treating her basely. I look as if I had meant something worse, do I? I know myself at last! Grizel has shown me what I am." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's some hyaena--or other," [...] {{replied the}} Sub-Warden, looking vaguely {{up to the}} ceiling, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> where they usually were to be found. [...] "Let us to business, my dear. Here comes the Warden." [...] And he picked {{up from the floor}} a {{wandering}} scrap of manuscript, on which I just caught the words 'after which Election duly holden the said Sibimet and Tabikat his wife may at their pleasure assume Imperial--' before, with a guilty look, he crumpled it up in his hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't I {{like the}} sailing? and seeing Harry too? I don't feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> waste, because I can {{sometimes}} spare poor Flora a little. We {{could not let}} her go alone." ...|$|R
5000|$|Writing in The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia, {{academic}} Peter Dendle said, [...] "This run-of-the-mill campus thriller crosses Angel Heart with Revenge of the Nerds, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> a niche <b>that</b> {{really needed}} filling." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So papa said," [...] replied Ethel, as {{she looked}} sorrowfully down. [...] "He was very angry with me for saying so. I wish I could help feeling <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> the temptation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is so restful to {{see people}} take things calmly, and not bolt their meals, or rush about like runaway steam-engines. It is this {{moderation}} that keeps Englishmen so hearty, jolly, and long-lived. They don't tear themselves to pieces as we do, but take time for rest, exercise, food, and recreation, like sensible people as they are. It is like reposing on a feather-bed to live here, and my tired nerves rejoice in it,' said Lavinia, eating bread and cheese <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> her mission in life.|$|E
60|$|She {{joined her}} {{companion}} again, {{and they left}} the burial-ground. I saw them stop near the church and speak to the sexton's wife, who {{had come from the}} cottage, and had waited, watching us from a distance. Then they went on again up the path that led to the moor. I looked after Anne Catherick as she disappeared, till all trace of her had faded in the twilight--looked as anxiously and sorrowfully <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the last I was to see in this weary world of the woman in white.|$|E
6000|$|... '"Laugh," [...] he said. [...] "Finish the laughter. I'll not cut ye short. Tell me now"--he {{wrenched}} at my head--"why the King {{chose to}} honour you,--you--you--you lickspittle Englishman? I am full of patience now. I have waited so long." [...] Then {{he was off}} at score about his Jonah in Bury Refectory, and what I'd said of it, and his pictures in the chapel which all men praised and none looked at twice (<b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> my fault!), and a whole parcel of words and looks treasured up against me through years.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The Constitution Britannique,' Mr Podsnap explained, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he were {{teaching}} in an infant school.' We Say British, But You Say Britannique, You Know' (forgivingly, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> not his fault). 'The Constitution, Sir.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Welcome {{is not to}} be bought,' said James. 'I {{could not}} stand hearing him reply to poor granny's heartfelt rapture with his riches and his Cheveleigh, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> all she could prize.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing. But I'm {{glad you}} wish {{so much to}} go." [...] The girl dropped her hands and stared. [...] "You must have enjoyed {{yourself}} to-day," [...] she added, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> an explanation.|$|R
6000|$|... "If the Doctor had {{pretended to}} have stated the {{particular}} bounds {{and limits of}} non-resistance, and told the people in what cases they {{might or might not}} resist, he would have been much to blame; nor was one word said in the articles, or by the managers, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> expected from him; but, on the contrary, we have insisted that in NO case can resistance be lawful, but in case of EXTREME NECESSITY, and where the Constitution can't otherwise be preserved; and such necessity ought to be plain and obvious to the sense and judgment of the whole nation: and this was the case at the Revolution." ...|$|E
6000|$|When Miss Smith and Miss Jones {{called a}} few days after to tell her that Mr. Fletcher was going abroad, the amiable creatures were entirely routed by finding Jack there in a most unmistakable situation. He blandly wished Horace [...] "bon voyage," [...] and regretted that he wouldn't be there to the wedding in October. Kitty devoted herself to {{blushing}} beautifully, and darning many rents in a short daisy muslin skirt, [...] "which I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likes it, and so do I," [...] she said, with a demure look at her lover, who laughed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the best joke of the season.|$|E
6000|$|... "Gee!" [...] Steve {{resumed his}} saga in a whirl of enthusiasm. [...] "Gee! if they're right to start with, if they're born right, if they've got the grit in them, you can't {{sterilize}} {{it out of}} 'em if you use up half the germ-killer in the country. From the way that kid acted you'd have thought he'd been spending the {{last year in a}} training-camp. The other kid rolled him over, but he come up again <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> just the sort of stuff he liked, and pretty soon I see that he's uncovered a yellow streak in the Whiting kid as big as a barn door. You were on it, weren't you, colonel?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Colonel, I've {{never seen}} a man that I've had such {{unbounded}} confidence in as you. When you say a thing right out, I always feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> ends it; <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> evidence, and proof, and everything else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, it ends then. Her uncle trusted me a {{deal more}} than he trusted Barbara. She was strange from a child. Fond of the men,' <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> an unusual and unbecoming form of philanthropy.|$|R
6000|$|... 63. Art became Italian! Yes, {{but what}} art? Your authors give a perspective--or {{what they call}} such,--of the upper church of Assisi, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> merely an {{accidental}} occurrence of blind walls for Giotto to paint on! ...|$|R
