5|$|A {{very well}} {{understood}} example of extrinsic control is {{the regulation of}} glucose metabolism by the hormone insulin. Insulin is produced in response to rises in blood glucose levels. Binding of the hormone to insulin receptors on cells then activates a cascade of protein kinases that cause the cells to take up glucose and convert it into storage molecules such as fatty acids and glycogen. The metabolism of glycogen is controlled by activity of phosphorylase, the enzyme that breaks down glycogen, and glycogen synthase, the enzyme that makes it. These enzymes are regulated in a reciprocal fashion, with phosphorylation inhibiting glycogen synthase, but <b>activating</b> phosphorylase. Insulin causes glycogen synthesis by <b>activating</b> protein phosphatases and producing {{a decrease in the}} phosphorylation of these enzymes.|$|E

5|$|Xenon induces robust cardioprotection and neuroprotection {{through a}} variety of mechanisms. Through its {{influence}} on Ca2+, K+, KATP\HIF, and NMDA antagonism, xenon is neuroprotective when administered before, during and after ischemic insults. Xenon is a high affinity antagonist at the NMDA receptor glycine site. Xenon is cardioprotective in ischemia-reperfusion conditions by inducing pharmacologic non-ischemic preconditioning. Xenon is cardioprotective by <b>activating</b> PKC-epsilon and downstream p38-MAPK. Xenon mimics neuronal ischemic preconditioning by <b>activating</b> ATP sensitive potassium channels. Xenon allosterically reduces ATP mediated channel activation inhibition independently of the sulfonylurea receptor1 subunit, increasing KATP open-channel time and frequency.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} {{impregnated}} almond shell <b>activated</b> carbon by Zn° and ZnSO 4 {{were used as}} adsorbent with a particle size of 10 - 20 mesh. The objective {{of this research was}} to determine the ability of impregnated <b>activated</b> carbon in nitrate removal. The modified <b>activated</b> carbon had 1 mm effective size, with a uniformity coefficient of 1. 18. Potassium nitrate solution was used in batch adsorption experiments for nitrate removal from water. The effects of nitrate concentration, <b>activated</b> carbon dosage and time of contact were studied. Experimental data showed that modified <b>activated</b> carbon by Zn° and ZnSO 4 was more effective than virgin almond <b>activated</b> carbon for nitrate removal. The maximum nitrate removal was 64 %- 80 % and 5 %- 42 % for modified <b>activated</b> carbon and virgin <b>activated</b> carbon, respectively. While virgin <b>activated</b> carbon used, nitrate-N decreased from 20 to 15 mg/L in 30 min reaction. The final nitrate concentration was not in the standard range of WHO recommendations for water quality; while impregnated <b>activated</b> carbons were used, nitrate drcreased to < 10 mg/L.

PD 98059 ([2 -(2 'amino- 3 '-methoxyphenyl) -oxanaphthalen- 4 -one]) blocks mitogen <b>activated</b> protein kinase by inhibiting its immediate upstream activator, mitogen <b>activated</b> protein kinase kinase (also known as MEK). Here we used PD 98059 to study the role of mitogen <b>activated</b> protein kinase in the axonal outgrowth of adult dorsal root ganglia explants. Whereas PD 98059 at 50 μM left spontaneous axonal outgrowth unaffected, it markedly inhibited nerve growth factor stimulated axon growth when assessed after two days in culture. A mitogen <b>activated</b> protein kinase assay and immunoblotting using antibodies discriminating between <b>activated</b> and inactivated kinase, both confirmed that PD 98059 reduced the amount of <b>activated</b> enzyme in nerve growth factor stimulated preparations, while the total amounts of the kinase remained unchanged.
