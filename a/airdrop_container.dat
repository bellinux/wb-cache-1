5000|$|The {{original}} prototype {{was designed}} by SOE motor cycle enthusiast Harry Lester, from an idea developed by Lt. Colonel John Dolphin, the Commanding Officer of Station IX, the secret Inter-Services Military Research Establishment based in a mansion called The Frythe (latterly owned by the pharmaceutical company GSK) an hour's drive north of London {{near the town of}} Welwyn in Hertfordshire, which had been taken over for the war effort. Powered by a Villiers [...] single-cylinder two-stroke petrol (gasoline) engine, the Welbike was designed to fit into a CLE Canister - the standard parachute <b>airdrop</b> <b>container</b> 51 in long, 15 in high, and 12 in wide. Once deployed, they were easily assembled and ready for use as quickly as possible. The name Welbike comes from the custom that all the clandestine equipment devised at Station IX in Welwyn had names starting with Wel, e.g., Welman, Welrod. There was very limited space in the airborne equipment container, so the Welbike, which was carried in the container at an angle, had no suspension, no lights and just a single rear brake.|$|E

5|$|In June, the ZNDH finally {{received}} from Germany the long-promised <b>airdrop</b> <b>containers</b> for aerial resupply of ammunition and other equipment, constantly in need by besieged and encircled garrisons {{all over the}} NDH. They were immediately {{put to good use}} and eased the work of the already overstretched ZNDH. The Dornier Do 17s of the ZNDH proved to be especially well suited for such tasks. June also saw Kren returned to his previous position as head of the ZNDH.|$|R
50|$|KG 55 {{returned}} to the frontline in January 1944. From here on, with a few exceptions, it was used primarily in the night intruder and air-supply role. I./KG 55 trained after refitting as a night strategic bomber force {{under the command of}} IV Fliegerkorps from January to March 1944. From 31 March to 7 April it was utilised to <b>airdrop</b> <b>containers</b> to the 1st Panzer Army, under the command of Hans-Valentin Hube. The German formation was trapped in the Kamenets-Podolsky pocket. The following night it struck rail targets at Fastov, southwest of Kiev. On 10 April it bombed Korosten marshalling yards and then at rail junctions, Rovno, Kiev and Shepetovka from 4-11 May 1944. The German defeat in the Crimea on 12 May, necessitated aircraft to evacuate personnel and KG 55 was called in to do so from 11-15 May, operating from Focsani, Romania.It transferred to Deblin on 16 May, but had 35 He 111 H-16s on strength on 1 June 1944.II Gruppe also trained for long-range operations under the command of IV Fliegerkorps. It was brought up to strength with 35 H-16s at Deblin: where it remained based until 10 May 1944. It trained from January to March 1944. From 31 March to 7 April 1944, it dropped supplies to the Kovel pocket, and rendered support to the 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking. It flew rail interdiction; bombing yards at Rovno, Kiev and Shepetovka from 4-11 May. It joined I Gruppe at Focsani in Romania to evacuate the Crimea, from 11-16 May 1944. It moved back to Deblin but the fuel crisis now prevalent in the Luftwaffe, slowed down the pace of operations. On 21/22 June, with I. and III. Gruppen, it bombed Poltava Air Base, which housed United States Army Air Force bombers that had been flying shuttle-missions to Eastern Europe and landing in the Soviet Union. The raid caused significant losses to the US Fifteenth Air Force. A Heinkel He 177 from 2./Aufkl√§rungsgruppe 100 shadowed the 3rd Bombardment Division, 45th Bombardment Wing to Poltava. The raid, carried out by KG 55, KG 53, KG 27 and KG 4, destroyed 43 B-17 Flying Fortress' damaged 26, and destroyed 200,000 US gallons of aviation fuel.|$|R
