5|$|Analysts said that, {{in return}} for {{organizational}} support, al-Balawi probably agreed {{to appear in the}} video, and to connect the attack he was planning to the death of Baitullah Mehsud, thus raising the profile of the Tehrik-i-Taliban. Most <b>analysts</b> <b>believe,</b> however, that al Qaeda chose the CIA as the target and ran the operation.|$|E
5|$|Modern <b>analysts</b> <b>believe</b> {{that the}} Italian {{campaign}} failed because Mussolini and his generals initially allocated insufficient {{resources to the}} campaign (an expeditionary force of 55,000 men), failed to reckon with the autumn weather, attacked without the advantage of surprise and without Bulgarian support. Elementary precautions such as issuing winter clothing had not been taken. Mussolini had not considered the warnings of the Italian Commission of War Production, that Italy {{would not be able}} to sustain a full year of continuous warfare until 1949.|$|E

40|$|The psychoanalytic {{conflict}} surrounding lay {{and medical}} analysis {{was a prominent}} conflict within both the European and American psychoanalytic communities. This thesis is an analysis of that conflict from the time period of 1900 - 1940. I argue that this conflict {{is an expression of}} two conflicting ideas for the disciplinary identity of psychoanalysis. Lay <b>analysts</b> <b>believed</b> that psychoanalysis should be a distinct discipline and be used in a multidisciplinary context. Medical <b>analysts</b> <b>believed</b> that through aligning psychoanalysis with medicine it would obtain professional legitimacy. This thesis also covers concepts of professionalization in disciplines...|$|R
5|$|After {{five years}} with San Diego, Hamilton {{was traded to}} the Toronto Blue Jays on December 12, 1998, for Peter Tucci, Carlos Almanzar, and Woody Williams. <b>Analysts</b> <b>believe</b> that Toronto {{acquired}} Hamilton if Roger Clemens's trade request was successful. Hamilton began the 1999 season with the Syracuse SkyChiefs, the Triple-A affiliate of the Blue Jays. He started three games, recording one loss, no wins, and a 5.11 ERA in 12 innings pitched. The Blue Jays called him up, and Hamilton made 18 starts in 22 games pitched. Pitching in 98 innings, he went 78 with a 6.52 ERA.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{investigation}} {{did not find}} any considerable evidence linking Kocharyan to the Hunanyan group, many Armenian politicians and <b>analysts</b> <b>believe</b> that President Robert Kocharyan and National Security Minister Serzh Sargsyan were behind the assassination of Vazgen Sargsyan and other leading politicians. In January 2000, investigators alleged that several members of the President Robert Kocharian's inner circle may have been behind the October 27 shooting, promoting some opposition figures to call for Kocharian's resignation. However, Kocharyan gradually consolidated his power throughout the year to emerge as the most powerful figure in the country's leadership.|$|E
5|$|After the trial, Kenealy instigated {{a popular}} radical reform movement, the Magna Charta Association, which championed the Claimant's cause for some years. Kenealy {{was elected to}} Parliament in 1875 as a radical {{independent}} but was not an effective parliamentarian. The movement was in decline when the Claimant was released in 1884, {{and he had no}} dealings with it. In 1895, he confessed to being Orton, only to recant almost immediately. He lived generally in poverty {{for the rest of his}} life and was destitute at the time of his death in 1898. Although most commentators have accepted the court's view that the Claimant was Orton, some <b>analysts</b> <b>believe</b> that an element of doubt remains as to his true identity and that, conceivably, he was Roger Tichborne.|$|E

25|$|Some <b>analysts</b> <b>believed</b> the Abbas {{family would}} not {{proceed with the}} case as it would allow Foreign Policy and Schanzer to dig in too deep into the PA's secret {{finances}} and records. However, the case proceeded.|$|R
5|$|Gov. Schwarzenegger again {{appealed to}} the Supreme Court, looking to {{overturn}} the Ninth Circuit's ruling, filing a writ of certiorari to the Court in May 2009. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, at this point filed as Schwarzenegger v. Entertainment Merchants Ass'n. The fact that the Court accepted this case was considered surprising, based on the previous case record for such violent video game laws that were unanimously overturned in other states. <b>Analysts</b> <b>believe</b> that because the Court agreed to hear this case, there are unanswered questions between the protection of free speech from the First Amendment, and the legal enforcement of protecting minors from unprotected free speech such as through restrictions on the sales of pornography to minors. Just a week prior to {{the acceptance of the}} certiorari, in United States v. Stevens the Court overturned another law that sought restrictions on depictions of animal cruelty, which some analysts felt would reflect the Court's position to likely overturn the violent video game law.|$|E
5|$|Tensions {{between the}} EEU and the European Union (EU) {{occurred}} as both {{have sought to}} deepen their ties with several former Soviet republics. The EU has signed free trade agreements with Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia. However, separatists in all three countries back closer ties with Russia. Russia and the EU both pressured Ukraine to join their respective economic blocs {{to the exclusion of}} the other, which ultimately led to Ukraine being torn in two, with the EU supporting the unwilling departure of the elected president, and Russia then annexing the Crimean peninsula (following a referendum) and supporting separatists in Eastern Ukraine. In response, some member states of the European Union have sought to find alternatives to Russian gas, while others have voiced their support for the construction of the South Stream pipeline which circumvents Ukraine. Later the already started construction of the pipeline, under US sanctions on Russia and pressure on EU, the project was abandoned. <b>Analysts</b> <b>believe</b> Russia backs the Eurasian Economic Union in order to limit western influence in the region.|$|E

25|$|Some local <b>analysts</b> <b>believe</b> {{the riots}} and {{conflict}} were instigated by the military, {{with the aim}} to embarrass Aung San Suu Kyi during her European tour, to reassert their own authority, or {{to divert attention from}} other conflicts involving ethnic minorities across the country.|$|E
25|$|Targeted {{killing is}} a form of {{assassination}} based on the presumption of criminal guilt.

25|$|<b>Analysts</b> <b>believe</b> the {{increasing}} {{popularity of the}} sport of figure skating meant that more sophisticated audiences came to prefer straightforward Olympic-style ice-skating competitions, or skating shows for adults (i.e., without cartoon characters), such as Stars on Ice. At the same time, shows such as Disney on Ice (featuring Disney cartoon characters) successfully competed for the child audience.|$|E
50|$|After a {{proposed}} bout with Cuban superstar Yuriorkis Gamboa fell through, Brandon Rios agreed to face off with Richar Abril on April 14, 2012 in Las Vegas.

25|$|However, {{nearly all}} the rare-earth {{elements}} in the world come from China, and one <b>analyst</b> <b>believes</b> that an overall increase in Chinese electronics manufacturing may consume this entire supply by 2012.

25|$|The Lockheed Martin RQ-170 Sentinel is an {{unmanned}} aerial vehicle (UAV) {{developed by}} Lockheed Martin and operated by the United States Air Force (USAF) for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

25|$|The recent {{renovation}} of the Renaissance Center, and related construction of a state-of-the-art cruise ship dock, new stadiums, and a new RiverWalk, have stimulated related private economic development. Nearby Windsor has a 19-year-old drinking age with a myriad of entertainment to complement Detroit's Greektown district. Some <b>analysts</b> <b>believe</b> that tourism planners have yet to tap the full economic power of the estimated 46 million people who live within a 300-mile (480-km) radius of Detroit.|$|E
25|$|Political <b>analysts</b> <b>believe</b> ETA's guilt {{would have}} {{strengthened}} the PP's {{chances of being}} re-elected, as {{this would have been}} regarded as the death throes of a terrorist organisation reduced to desperate measures by the strong anti-terrorist policy of the Aznar administration. On the other hand, an Islamist attack would have been perceived as the direct result of Spain's involvement in Iraq, an unpopular war that had not been approved by the Spanish Parliament.|$|E
50|$|France opposed Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser's {{material}} and political {{assistance to the}} FLN, which some French <b>analysts</b> <b>believed</b> was the revolution's main sustenance.
