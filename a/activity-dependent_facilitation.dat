40|$|<b>Activity-dependent</b> <b>facilitation</b> is a {{mechanism}} of associative synaptic plasticity {{that contributes to}} classical conditioning in Aplysia. Previous studies of <b>activity-dependent</b> <b>facilitation</b> in the mechanosensory neurons of Aplysia suggested that the Ca*+ influx during paired spike activity enhances the transmitter-stimulated, CAMP-dependent, presynaptic facilitation in these cells. Moreover, paired activity was found to potentiate the activation of the adenylate cyclase by transmitter. It was therefore proposed that the Ca*+/calmodulin-sensitive cyclase {{may serve as a}} site of interaction between the inputs from the conditioned and unconditioned stimuli. These studies were carried out to test whether a Ca*+/calmc-dulin-sensitive adenylate cyclase in the Ap/ysia CNS has the properties necessary to mediate such an associative interaction...|$|E
40|$|The Goto Kakizaki (GK) rat is {{a widely}} used animal model to study {{defective}} glucose-stimulated insulin release in type- 2 diabetes (T 2 D). As in T 2 D patients, the expression of several proteins involved in Ca 2 +-dependent exocytosis of insulin-containing large dense-core vesicles is dysregulated in this model. So far, a defect in late steps of insulin secretion could not be demonstrated. To resolve this apparent contradiction, we studied Ca 2 +–secretion coupling of healthy and GK rat β cells in acute pancreatic tissue slices by assessing exocytosis with high time-resolution membrane capacitance measurements. We found that β cells of GK rats respond to glucose stimulation with a normal increase in the cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration. During trains of depolarizing pulses, the secretory activity from GK rat β cells was defective in spite of upregulated cell size and doubled voltage-activated Ca 2 + currents. In GK rat β cells, evoked Ca 2 + entry was significantly less efficient in triggering release than in nondiabetic controls. This impairment was neither due to a decrease of functional vesicle pool sizes nor due to different kinetics of pool refilling. Strong stimulation with two successive trains of depolarizing pulses led to a prominent <b>activity-dependent</b> <b>facilitation</b> of release in GK rat β cells, whereas secretion in controls was unaffected. Broad-spectrum inhibition of PKC sensitized Ca 2 +-dependent exocytosis, whereas it prevented the <b>activity-dependent</b> <b>facilitation</b> in GK rat β cells. We conclude that {{a decrease in the}} sensitivity of the GK rat β-cell to depolarization-evoked Ca 2 + influx is involved in defective glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Furthermore, we discuss a role for constitutively increased activity of one or more PKC isoenzymes in diabetic rat β cells...|$|E
40|$|SummaryRecordings in the locust {{antennal lobe}} (AL) reveal activity-dependent, stimulus-specific changes in {{projection}} neuron (PN) and local neuron response patterns over repeated odor trials. During {{the first few}} trials, PN response intensity decreases, while spike time precision increases, and coherent oscillations, absent at first, quickly emerge. We examined this “fast odor learning” with a realistic computational model of the AL. <b>Activity-dependent</b> <b>facilitation</b> of AL inhibitory synapses was sufficient to simulate physiological recordings of fast learning. In addition, in experiments with noisy inputs, a network including synaptic facilitation of both inhibition and excitation responded with reliable spatiotemporal patterns from trial to trial despite the noise. A network lacking fast plasticity, however, responded with patterns that varied across trials, reflecting the input variability. Thus, our study suggests that fast olfactory learning results from stimulus-specific, activity-dependent synaptic facilitation and may improve the signal-to-noise ratio for repeatedly encountered odor stimuli...|$|E
40|$|Short-term {{plasticity}} (STP) comprises several rapid synaptic {{processes that}} operate on millisecond-to-minute timescales and modulate synaptic efficacy in an <b>activity-dependent</b> manner. <b>Facilitation</b> and augmentation {{are two major}} STP components in central synapses that work to enhance synaptic strength, while various forms of short-term depression work to decrease it. These multiple components of STP interact to perform a variety of synaptic computations. Using a modeling approach in excitatory hippocampal synapses, we recently described the contributions of individual STP components to synaptic operations. In this mini-review, we summarize the recent findings that revealed a wide palette of functions that STP components play in neural operations and discuss their roles in information processing, working memory and decision making...|$|R
40|$|SummaryAn activity-dependent form of {{intermediate}} memory (AD-ITM) for sensitization is induced in Aplysia {{by a single}} tail shock that gives rise to plastic changes (AD-ITF) in tail sensory neurons (SNs) via the interaction of action potential firing in the SN coupled {{with the release of}} serotonin in the CNS. <b>Activity-dependent</b> long-term <b>facilitation</b> (AD-LTF, lasting > 24 hr) requires protein synthesis dependent persistent mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation and translocation to the SN nucleus. We now show that the induction of the earlier temporal phase (AD-ITM and AD-ITF), which is translation and transcription independent, requires the activation of a compartmentally distinct novel signaling cascade that links second messengers, MAPK and PKC into a unified pathway within tail SNs. Since both AD-ITM and AD-LTM require MAPK activity, these collective findings suggest that presynaptic SNs route the flow of molecular information to distinct subcellular compartments during the induction of activity-dependent long-lasting memories...|$|R
40|$|Synaptic plasticity, {{changes in}} the number and {{strength}} of synaptic connections in the brain, represents the best-characterized correlate of learning and memory. Long-term synaptic plasticity is a transcription- and translation-dependent process that can be restricted to subsets of synapses within a single neuron. The model system Aplysia californica provides an excellent model system to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying long-term, learning- related synaptic plasticity. In this thesis, I investigate two cell biological questions that emerge from the requirement for gene expression during synapse-specific plasticity. The first question concerns the spatial regulation of gene expression within neurons. Here, we propose that one mechanism for restricting gene expression to individual synapses is through mRNA localization and regulated translation. I have identified a 66 nucleotide sequence in the 5 'UTR of sensorin mRNA that when paired with the sensorin 3 'UTR is required and sufficient for sensorin mRNA synaptic localization. My experiments further indicate that this localization element is encoded by a stem-loop structure (Meer et al., 2012). The second question concerns the mechanisms by which synaptically-generated signals are transported from the synapse to the nucleus to initiate transcription. Using the Aplysia sensory-motor co-culture system, I found that the transcriptional regulator CREB-regulated transcriptional co-activator (CRTC) is required for <b>activity-dependent</b> long-term <b>facilitation.</b> Aplysia CRTC (ApCRTC) accumulates in the nucleus when cultures are treated with stimulation inducing activity-dependent heterosynaptic plasticity, but not when treated with activity-independent heterosynaptic plasticity inducing stimulation. Electrophysiological studies show that ApCRTC is functionally required in the postsynaptic (motor) neuron, as injection of dominant-negative constructs block long-term synaptic plasticity...|$|R
40|$|SummaryTRPV 1 receptors feature {{prominently}} in nociception of spinal primary afferents {{but are also}} expressed in unmyelinated cranial visceral primary afferents linked to homeostatic regulation. Cranial visceral afferents enter the brain at the solitary tract nucleus (NTS) to control the heart, lungs, and other vital organs. Here we identify a role for central TRPV 1 in the <b>activity-dependent</b> <b>facilitation</b> of glutamatergic transmission from solitary tract (ST) afferents. Fast, synchronous ST-NTS transmission from capsaicin-sensitive (TRPV 1 +) and -insensitive (TRPV 1 −) afferents was similar. However, afferent activation triggered long-lasting asynchronous glutamate release only from TRPV 1 + synapses. Asynchronous release was proportional to synchronous EPSC amplitude, activity, and calcium entry. TRPV 1 antagonists and low temperature blocked asynchronous release, but not evoked EPSCs. At physiological afferent frequencies, asynchronous release strongly potentiated the duration of postsynaptic spiking. This activity-dependent TPRV 1 -mediated facilitation {{is a form of}} synaptic plasticity that brings a unique central integrative feature to the CNS and autonomic regulation...|$|E
40|$|At {{the nerve}} terminal, both N- and P/Q-type Ca 2 + {{channels}} mediate synaptic transmission, with their relative contribution varying between synapses and with postnatal age. To clarify functional significance of different presynaptic Ca 2 + channel subtypes, we recorded N-type and P/Q-type Ca 2 + currents directly from calyces of Held nerve terminals in α 1 A-subunit-deficient mice and wild-type (WT) mice, respectively. The most prominent feature of P/Q-type Ca 2 + currents was <b>activity-dependent</b> <b>facilitation,</b> which was absent for N-type Ca 2 + currents. EPSCs mediated by P/Q-type Ca 2 + currents showed less depression during high-frequency stimulation {{compared with those}} mediated by N-type Ca 2 + currents. In addition, the maximal inhibition by the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen was greater for EPSCs mediated by N-type channels than for those mediated by P/Q-type channels. These {{results suggest that the}} developmental switch of presynaptic Ca 2 + channels from N- to P/Q-type may serve to increase synaptic efficacy at high frequencies of activity, securing high-fidelity synaptic transmission...|$|E
40|$|This work reviews {{research}} on neural mechanisms of {{two types of}} associative learning in the marine mollusk Aplysia, classical conditioning of the gill- and siphon-withdrawal reflex and operant conditioning of feeding behavior. Basic classical conditioning is caused in part by <b>activity-dependent</b> <b>facilitation</b> at sensory neuron–motor neuron (SN–MN) synapses and involves a hybrid combination of activity-dependent presynaptic facilitation and Hebbian potentiation, which are coordinated by trans-synaptic signaling. Classical conditioning also shows several higher-order features, whichmight {{be explained by the}} known circuit connec-tions in Aplysia. Operant conditioning is caused in part by a different type of mechanism, an intrinsic increase in excitability of an identified neuron in the central pattern generator (CPG) for feeding. However, for both classical and operant conditioning, adenylyl cyclase is a molecular site of convergence of the two signals that are associated. Learning in other inver-tebrate preparations also involves many of the same mechanisms, which may contribute to learning in vertebrates as well. Learning can be divided into two general cat-egories: nonassociative learning, in which an animal learns about the properties or oc...|$|E
40|$|In outside-out patches excised {{from human}} {{embryonic}} kidney (HEK) 293 cells expressing Ca 2 +-permeable -amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazole-propionate receptor (AMPAR) channels, currents activated by 1 ms glutamate pulses at negative membrane potentials facilitated during and following a repetitive (2 to 100 Hz) agonist application. The degree of facilitation depended on subunit type, membrane potential and stimulation frequency being antagonized by a slow recovery from desensitization. <b>Activity-dependent</b> current <b>facilitation</b> occurred in Ca 2 +-permeable {{but not in}} Ca 2 +-impermeable AMPAR channels. Current facilitation, however, {{does not depend on}} Ca 2 + flux. Rather it reflects a relief from the block of Ca 2 +-permeable AMPARs by intracellular polyamines since facilitation occurred only in the presence of polyamines and since facilitated currents had a nearly linear current-voltage relation (I-V). Relief from polyamine block was use dependent and occurred mainly in open channels. The relief mechanism was determined primarily by membrane potential rather than by current flow. In closed channels the degree of polyamine block was independent of membrane potential. The voltage dependence of the rate of relief from the block in open channels rather than the voltage dependence of the block underlies the inwardly rectifying shape of the I-V at negative potentials. Currents through native Ca 2 +-permeable AMPAR channels in outside-out or nucleated patches from either hippocampal basket cells or a subtype of neocortical layer II nonpyramidal cells also showed facilitation. It is concluded that a use-dependent relief from polyamine block during consecutive AMPAR channel openings underlies current facilitation. This polyamine-AMPAR interaction may represent a new activity-dependent postsynaptic mechanism for control of synaptic signalling...|$|R
40|$|Short-term {{habituation}} (STH) is {{the decrease}} in behavioral responding observed during repeated stimulation at regular intervals. For siphon-elicited siphon withdrawal in Aplysia (S-SWR), we previously showed that the amplitude of responses measured in LFS-type siphon motor neurons (LFS MNs) during training {{is dependent on the}} stimulus interval used and is training-site specific. The major source of excitation from siphon stimulation onto the LFS MNs comes from the L 29 interneurons. Here we examined the role of the L 29 s in STH by addressing two questions: 1. What are the relative contributions of intrinsic regulation of excitability and network inhibition on L 29 activity during STH training? By activating L 29 s with intracellular current injection, we found that intrinsic changes in excitability occur, but only at short training intervals (1 sec). We also demonstrated that network inhibition is not required for regulating L 29 responses during training, indicating that any expression of inhibition is redundant to the excitability changes. 2. How does L 29 synaptic plasticity contribute to the maintenance of training site-specificity exhibited in LFS MNs? When training stimuli are delivered 1 sec apart (1 sec ISI), L 29 responses decrease in both stimulated (trained) and un-stimulated (untrained) pathways, yet site-specificity of training is maintained in the LFS MNs. Our results suggest that <b>activity-dependent</b> synaptic <b>facilitation</b> (augmentation; AUG) expressed by the L 29 s acts to compensate for the decreased activity in the untrained pathway. First, we demonstrated that the L 29 -LFS synapse exhibits significant AUG with L 29 activation at a 1 sec ISI. Second, we showed that the induction of AUG prevents the reduction in siphon-evoked LFS responses that is otherwise observed with decreased L 29 activity. Collectively, our results support a role for the L 29 s in regulating network dynamics during STH training, but only at rapid (1 sec ISI) training intervals...|$|R
40|$|Sustained {{activity}} at most central synapses {{is accompanied by}} a number of short-term changes in synaptic strength which act over a range of time scales. Here we examine experimental data and develop a model of synaptic depression at the calyx of Held synaptic terminal that combines many of these mechanisms (acting at differing sites and across a range of time scales). This new model incorporates vesicle recycling, <b>facilitation,</b> <b>activity-dependent</b> vesicle retrieval and multiple mechanisms affecting calcium channel activity and release probability. It can accurately reproduce the time course of experimentally measured short-term depression across different stimulus frequencies and exhibits a slow decay in EPSC amplitude during sustained stimulation. We show that the slow decay is a consequence of vesicle release inhibition by multiple mechanisms and {{is accompanied by a}} partial recovery of the releasable vesicle pool. This prediction is supported by patch-clamp data, using long duration repetitive EPSC stimulation at up to 400 Hz. The model also explains the recovery from depression in terms of interaction between these multiple processes, which together generate a stimulus-history-dependent recovery after repetitive stimulation. Given the high rates of spontaneous activity in the auditory pathway, the model also demonstrates how these multiple interactions cause chronic synaptic depression under in vivo conditions. While the magnitude of the depression converges to the same steady state for a given frequency, the time courses of onset and recovery are faster in the presence of spontaneous activity. We conclude that interactions between multiple sources of short-term plasticity can account for the complex kinetics during high frequency stimulation and cause stimulus-history-dependent recovery at this relay synapse...|$|R
40|$|The {{presynaptic}} calcium current (IpCa) {{was recorded}} from the calyx of Held in rat brainstem slices using the whole-cell patch clamp technique. Tetanic activation of IpCa by 1 ms depolarizing voltage steps markedly enhanced the amplitude of IpCa. Using a paired pulse protocol, the second (test) response was facilitated with inter-pulse intervals {{of less than}} 100 ms. The facilitation was greater at shorter intervals and was maximal (about 20 %) at intervals of 5 – 10 ms. When the test pulse duration was extended, the facilitation was revealed as an increased rate of IpCa activation. From the current-voltage relationship measured at 1 ms from onset, facilitation could be described by {{a shift in the}} half-activation voltage of about − 4 mV. IpCa facilitation was not attenuated when guanosine- 5 ′-O-(3 -thiotriphosphate) (GTPγS) or guanosine- 5 ′-O-(2 -thiodiphosphate) (GDPβS) was included in the patch pipette, suggesting that G-proteins are not involved in this phenomenon. On reducing [Ca 2 +]o, the magnitude of facilitation diminished proportionally to the amplitude of IpCa. Replacement of [Ca 2 +]o by Ba 2 + or Na+, or buffering of [Ca 2 +]i with EGTA or BAPTA attenuated IpCa facilitation. We conclude that repetitive presynaptic activity can facilitate the presynaptic Ca 2 + current through a Ca 2 +-dependent mechanism. This mechanism would be complementary to the action of residual Ca 2 + on the exocytotic machinery in producing <b>activity-dependent</b> <b>facilitation</b> of synaptic responses...|$|E
40|$|Kinins are {{important}} mediators in cardiovascular homeostasis, inflammation, and nociception. Two kinin receptors have been described, B 1 and B 2. The B 2 receptor is constitutively expressed, and its targeted disruption leads to salt-sensitive hypertension and altered nociception. The B 1 receptor is a heptahelical receptor {{distinct from the}} B 2 receptor {{in that it is}} highly inducible by inflammatory mediators such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide and interleukins. To clarify its physiological function, we have generated mice with a targeted deletion of the gene for the B 1 receptor. B 1 receptor-deficient animals are healthy, fertile, and normotensive. In these mice, bacterial lipopolysaccharide-induced hypotension is blunted, and there is a reduced accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in inflamed tissue. Moreover, under normal noninflamed conditions, they are analgesic in behavioral tests of chemical and thermal nociception. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, we show that the B 1 receptor was not necessary for regulating the noxious heat sensitivity of isolated nociceptors. However, by using an in vitro preparation, we could show that functional B 1 receptors are present in the spinal cord, and their activation can facilitate a nociceptive reflex. Furthermore, in B 1 receptor-deficient mice, we observed a reduction in the <b>activity-dependent</b> <b>facilitation</b> (wind-up) of a nociceptive spinal reflex. Thus, the kinin B 1 receptor plays an essential physiological role in the initiation of inflammatory responses and the modulation of spinal cord plasticity that underlies the central component of pain. The B 1 receptor therefore represents a useful pharmacological target especially for the treatment of inflammatory disorders and pain...|$|E
40|$|The gill- and siphon-withdrawal reflex of Aplysia {{undergoes}} {{classical conditioning}} of its amplitude and duration when siphon stimulation (the conditioned stimulus, CS) is paired with tail or mantle shock (the unconditioned stimulus, US). This conditioning of a preexisting response exhibits both temporal and stimulus specificities, {{which can be}} accounted for by activity-dependent enhancement of presynaptic facilitation of the siphon sensory neurons. To test whether conditioning of the reflex also exhibits response specificity (development of a new type of response to the CS that often resembles the response to the US), we measured the direction of siphon withdrawal in response to siphon stimulation (the CS) with tail or mantle shock as the US. The unlearned response to siphon stimulation is straight contraction, the response to tail shock is backward bending, and the response to mantle shock is forward bending. In the first experiment, we trained different animals with the tail or mantle US paired or unpaired with the CS; in a second experiment, we trained each animal with two CSs, one of which was paired with the US; in a third experiment, we varied US intensity; and in a fourth experiment, we trained each animal with two USs, one of which was paired with the CS. There was a significant, pairing-specific tendency for the direction of the response to the CS to resemble the response to the US after training in each experiment, demonstrating response specificity in conditioning of the withdrawal reflex. This feature of conditioning could in principle {{be accounted for by}} an elaboration of <b>activity-dependent</b> <b>facilitation...</b>|$|E
40|$|Activation {{of group}} I metabotropic {{glutamate}} receptors (mGlu 1 or - 5 receptors) {{is known to}} either enhance or attenuate excitotoxic neuronal death depending on the experimental conditions. We have examined the possibility that these receptors may switch between two different functional modes in regulating excitotoxicity. In mixed cultures of cortical cells, the selective mGlu 1 / 5 agonist, 3, 5 -dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG), amplified neurodegeneration induced by a toxic pulse of NMDA. This effect was observed when DHPG was either combined with NMDA or transiently applied to the cultures prior to the NMDA pulse. However, two consecutive applications of DHPG consistently produced neuroprotection. Similar effects were observed with DHPG or quisqualate (a potent agonist of mGlu 1 / 5 receptors) in pure cultures of cortical neurons virtually devoid of astrocytes. In cultures of hippocampal pyramidal neurons, however, only protective effects of DHPG were seen suggesting that, in these particular cultures, group I mGlu receptors were endogenously switched into a 'neuroprotective mode'. The characteristics of the <b>activity-dependent</b> switch from <b>facilitation</b> to inhibition were examined in mixed cultures of cortical cells. The switch in the response to DHPG was observed when the two applications of the drug were separated by an interval ranging from 1 - 45 min, but was lost when the interval was extended to 90 min. In addition, this phenomenon required the initial activation, of mGlu 5 receptors (as indicated {{by the use of}} subtype-selective antagonists) and was mediated by the activation of protein kinase C. We conclude that group I mGlu receptors are subjected to an activity-dependent switch in regulating excitotoxic neuronal death and, therefore, the recent 'history' of these receptors is critical for the response to agonists or antagonists...|$|R
40|$|Members of the Rab {{family of}} monomeric GTPases have {{been implicated in}} vesicle trafficking, and Rab 3 A, located on {{synaptic}} vesicles in neurones and secretory vesicles in neuroendocrine cells, {{is likely to be}} involved in vesicle fusion leading to neurotransmitter release. A hydrolysis-deficient mutant of Rab 3 A, Rab 3 AQ 81 L, has been shown to potently inhibit hormone release. Here we show that the inhibition of hormone release by Rab 3 AQ 81 L is activity-dependent. Bovine adrenal chromaffin cells were induced to express Rab 3 AQ 81 L and green fluorescent protein by adenoviral gene transfer of a bicistronic construct. Fluorescent cells were stimulated with single depolarizations and trains of depolarizing pulses in whole cell perforated patch clamp recordings, and exocytosis was detected with cell capacitance measurements and carbon fibre amperometry. When single depolarizations were used to evoke exocytosis, cells expressing Rab 3 AQ 81 L showed a 50 % reduction in response amplitude. When trains of brief depolarizations (10 or 40 ms) were used to evoke exocytosis, responses rapidly declined to zero in cells expressing Rab 3 AQ 81 L. Wild-type Rab 3 A had effects similar to Rab 3 AQ 81 L, causing significant inhibition of exocytosis only during repetitive stimulation. Expression of Rab 5 A did not alter exocytosis evoked by single depolarizations or repetitive stimulation. Applying a long duration depolarization {{in the middle of a}} stimulus train revealed that exocytotic efficacy (capacitance increase per amount of calcium influx) was not decreased in Rab 3 AQ 81 L-expressing cells. Instead, the activity-dependent increase in exocytotic efficacy observed in control cells did not occur in Rab 3 AQ 81 L-expressing cells. Our results suggest that Rab 3 A in the GTP bound conformation prevents <b>activity-dependent</b> <b>facilitation...</b>|$|E
40|$|Transmission at the hippocampal mossy fibre (MF) –CA 3 {{pyramidal}} cell synapse {{is characterized by}} prominent <b>activity-dependent</b> <b>facilitation,</b> which is thought to provide a wide dynamic range in hippocampal informational flow. At this synapse in mice the magnitude of paired-pulse facilitation and frequency-dependent facilitation markedly decreased with postnatal development from 3 weeks (3 W) to 9 weeks (9 W). Throughout this period the mean amplitude and variance of unitary EPSCs stayed constant. By altering extracellular Ca 2 +/Mg 2 + concentrations the paired-pulse ratio could be changed to a similar extent as observed during development. However, this was accompanied by an over 30 -fold change in EPSC amplitude, suggesting that the developmental change in facilitation ratio cannot simply be explained by a change in release probability. With paired-pulse stimulation the Ca 2 + transients at MF terminals, monitored using mag-fura- 5, showed a small facilitation, but its magnitude remained similar between 3 W and 9 W mice. Pharmacological tests using CNQX, adenosine, LY 341495, H- 7 or KN- 62 suggested that neither presynaptic receptors (kainate, adenosine and metabotropic glutamate) nor protein kinases {{are responsible for the}} developmental change in facilitation. Nevertheless, loading the membrane-permeable form of BAPTA attenuated the paired-pulse facilitation in 3 W mice to a much greater extent than in 9 W mice, resulting in a marked reduction in age difference. These results suggest that the developmental decrease in the MF synaptic facilitation arises from a change associated with residual Ca 2 +, a decrease in residual Ca 2 + itself or a change in Ca 2 +-binding sites involved in the facilitation. A developmental decline in facilitation ratio reduces the dynamic range of MF transmission, possibly contributing to the stabilization of hippocampal circuitry...|$|E
40|$|Chemical synapses {{exhibit a}} {{diverse array of}} {{internal}} mechanisms that affect the dynamics of transmission efficacy. Many of these processes, such as release of neurotransmitter and vesicle recycling, depend strongly on activity-dependent influx and accumulation of Ca 2 +. To model how each of these processes may affect the processing of information in neural circuits, and how their dysfunction may lead to disease states, requires a computationally efficient modelling framework, capable of generating accurate phenomenology without incurring a heavy computational cost per synapse. In this dissertation, I derive physically grounded mathematical models of the instantaneous rate of Ca 2 +-triggered neurotransmitter release. The Ca 2 + traces that drive these dynamics come from simulations in MCell of spike-evoked Ca 2 + influx and buffered diffusion through the presynaptic space, an approach that overcomes observational limitations of physiological experiments. With these Ca 2 + traces, I drive a validated kinetic model of the SNARE complex, which mediates spike-triggered vesicle fusion for both synchronous and asynchronous release. The profiles of the resulting release rate histograms inform {{the parameters of the}} phenomenological release models, including the time scales and the facilitation of release probability. Based on these results, I construct an event-driven model of presynaptic dynamics, treating all Ca 2 +-sensitive processes, not just vesicle release, as Poisson processes with decaying rate parameters that may undergo <b>activity-dependent</b> <b>facilitation.</b> This approach provides a unified framework for modelling both spontaneous and spike-evoked presynaptic vesicle dynamics, for an arbitrary number of processes that define interaction between an arbitrary number of vesicle pools and recycling pathways. I validate the model against MCell and demonstrate a runtime complexity that bridges the gap between full molecular simulations and abstract synaptic models. Furthermore, I verify that Ca 2 +-dependent recycling mechanisms are essential for maintaining transmission fidelity during high-frequency stimuli. Finally, the versatility of the framework enables one both to model diverse types of synapses and to perform test and control modelling experiments by including different sets of features and controlling their rates and responsiveness. I present this model as a highly extensible tool for future investigations into the functional impact of different synaptic mechanisms on information processing and dysfunction in model networks...|$|E
