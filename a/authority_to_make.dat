5|$|By {{executive}} order, Bevin required {{all state}} agencies to reduce spending {{in their current}} budgets by 4.5 percent. House Speaker Greg Stumbo argued that Bevin {{did not have the}} authority to order such reductions without legislative approval, but Senate President Robert Stivers defended Bevin's action, saying it amounted to simply not spending money that was previously allocated. Bevin later compromised with the state's public college and university presidents to reduce the cuts to 2 percent, but Attorney General Andy Beshear sued to stop the cuts entirely. On May 18, 2016, a Franklin Circuit Court judge ruled Bevin did have the <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the cuts. The Kentucky Supreme Court accepted the case on appeal, granting Beshear's request to bypass the Kentucky Court of Appeals for expediency. A hearing before the Supreme Court occurred on August 18. On September 21, 2016, the Supreme Court issued a 5â€“2 decision reversing the Franklin Circuit Court ruling and agreeing with Beshear that Bevin did not have the <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> mid-year budget cuts without the approval of the General Assembly.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} full term in Congress, Jennings stepped up his attacks on Harrison, accusing him of using his office for {{personal}} gain, of taking part in questionable land speculation deals, and needlessly raising tensions with the Native American tribes on the frontier. Jennings presented a congressional resolution that intended to reduce Harrison's <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> political appointments and opposed his policy of purchasing lands from the Indians. When Harrison was up for reappointment as territorial governor in 1810, Jennings sent a scathing letter to President James Madison that argued against his reappointment. Harrison's allies in Washington argued on his behalf and aided in securing his reappointment.|$|E

5|$|In the Senate, Stevenson was a {{conservative}} stalwart, steadfastly opposing spending on internal improvements {{and maintaining a}} strict constructionist view of the constitution. He urged his fellow senators to oppose the Civil Rights Act of 1871, claiming that its provision that the president could suspend the right of habeas corpus in cases where he believed violence was imminent amounted to giving the chief executive the powers of a dictator. He also opposed the appropriation of federal money to fund the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, {{because he did not}} believe Congress was given the <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> such an allocation under the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|The {{governor}} {{also can}} influence the state court system through the appointment of judges. In Indiana, when vacancies occur on the Supreme Court, Tax Court, and circuit courts, the Judicial Nominating Commission interviews candidates and sends a list of three candidates for each vacancy to the governor, who chooses one. Justices of the peace and superior courts judges are elected in Indiana; if a vacancy occurs (such as by death or resignation) the governor may make an appointment, who holds the office until the next general election. The <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> such appointments gives the governor considerable sway in setting {{the makeup of the}} judiciary.|$|E

However, other polls seemed to favor the Schindler family's position, and questions were raised about the wording of all the polls.|$|E

5|$|When Napoleon {{sought to}} sell the French {{territory}} of Louisiana to the United States in 1802, Jefferson was concerned over the political consequences of acquiring a large tract of what was perceived then as predominantly Southern territory, {{as well as a}} possible lack of constitutional <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the purchase. To circumvent these concerns, Lincoln made a novel proposal that the territory could be acquired by expanding an existing state's borders, effecting a purchase that would not require a constitutional amendment. This proposal was rejected by Jefferson and his other advisors, and the purchase was ultimately made in spite of the standing constitutional question.|$|E
5|$|Chandler feared Laffoon, who {{controlled}} the State Democratic Central Committee, {{would attempt to}} hand-select the Democratic gubernatorial nominee by calling a nominating convention instead of holding a primary election, and he used a bold move to circumvent Laffoon's ability to carry out such an action. Under the Kentucky Constitution, Chandler became acting governor any time Laffoon left the state. When Laffoon traveled to meet with President Franklin D. Roosevelt in Washington, D. C. on February 6, 1935, Chandler used his authority to call the legislature into session to consider a bill requiring that each party's gubernatorial candidates be chosen by a primary rather than a nominating convention. Laffoon returned to the state {{the next day and}} challenged Chandler's <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the call, but Chandler's actions were validated by the Kentucky Court of Appeals on February 26.|$|E
5|$|Both Block 37 and The Mills Corporation have {{histories}} of financial difficulties. Block 37 had been demolished in 1989 for a hotly contested redevelopment plan under the then new Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley. The debates included {{the demolition of}} the Chicago Landmark McCarthy Building, which proceeded after the Illinois Supreme Court decided private preservation groups did not have standing to challenge the city's decision. Once the site was cleared, the initial redevelopment plan fell through, as did several subsequent plans, leaving the block vacant and undeveloped for nearly a generation. The Mills Corporation has itself been in financial difficulty in the past. This reputation and changing financial climate caused a delay in 2006 as contractors feared not getting paid. During the construction, cost overruns and delays have forced the city of Chicago and the Chicago Transit <b>Authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> up for a shortfall of over $100million. In November 2009, the developer was declared in default and CB Richard Ellis was named receiver.|$|E

5|$|Even {{though as}} many as {{fourteen}} claimants put forward their claims to the title, the real contest was between John Balliol and Robert de Brus. The Scottish magnates made a request to Edward to conduct the proceedings and administer the outcome, but not to arbitrate in the dispute. The actual decision would be made by 104 auditors - 40 appointed by Balliol, 40 by Bruce and the remaining 24 selected by Edward I from {{senior members of the}} Scottish political community. At Birgham, with the prospect of a personal union between the two realms, the question of suzerainty had not been of great importance to Edward. Now he insisted that, if he were to settle the contest, he had to be fully recognised as Scotland's feudal overlord. The Scots were reluctant to make such a concession, and replied that since the country had no king, no one had the <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> this decision. This problem was circumvented when the competitors agreed that the realm would be handed over to Edward until a rightful heir had been found. After a lengthy hearing, a decision was made in favour of John Balliol on 17November 1292.|$|E
5|$|The governor's {{powers are}} {{enumerated}} {{in the state}} constitution. There have been four constitutions of Kentuckyâ€”adopted in 1792, 1799, 1850, and 1891, respectivelyâ€”and each has enlarged the governor's authority. Among the powers appropriated to the governor in the constitution are the ability to grant pardons, veto legislation, and call the legislature into session. The governor serves as commander-in-chief of the state's military forces and is empowered to enforce all laws of the state. The officeholder is given broad statutory <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> appointments to the various cabinets and departments of the executive branch, limited somewhat by {{the adoption of a}} merit system for state employees in 1960. Because Kentucky's governor controls so many appointments to commissions, the office has been historically {{considered one of the most}} powerful state executive positions in the United States. Additionally, the governor's influence has been augmented by wide discretion in awarding state contracts and significant influence over the legislature, although the latter has been waning since the mid-1970s.|$|E
5|$|The Rio de Janeiro bid {{committee}} was an incorporated non-profit entity {{under the leadership}} of an Honorary Council and an Executive Board, both chaired by Carlos Arthur Nuzman. At the highest level, the Honorary Council comprised the President of the Federative Republic of Brazil Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva, the Governor of the State of Rio de Janeiro SÃ©rgio Cabral, the Mayor of the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro Eduardo Paes, and the two Brazilian IOC members: Nuzman and JoÃ£o Havelange. At the executive level, the Executive Board was divided in four departmentsâ€”Government Coordination Commission, Business Council, Legacy Committee and Athletes' Commissionâ€”being responsible for the main operations of the campaign. The Board also included representations from the three levels of Government with the specific <b>authority</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> commitments on behalf of their respective Governments. Technical aspects of the bid were supported by various Councils and Committees composed of a professionals staff, and supplemented by a team of domestic and international experts; which were coordinated by Carlos Roberto OsÃ³rio, Secretary General of the bid committee. Mike Lee, former Director of Communications and Public Affairs for the London bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics, was the lead advisor to the bid of Rio de Janeiro. His company, Vero Campaigning Communications, was responsible for planning the bid's advertising campaign strategy, presentation scripts, visual support development and international media relations, as well as international press conferences.|$|E
