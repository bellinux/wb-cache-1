500|$|Placed under {{surveillance}} {{due to his}} involvement in revolutionary politics by 1894, Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești was eventually expelled from France, despite Huysmans' intervention in his favor. Reputedly, the deportation document identified him as a [...] "threat to public order". One urban legend recounts that Bogdan-Pitești was present at Vaillant's public execution <b>and</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> to kiss Vaillant's mangled body, which both disgusted and alarmed the judicial establishment. Zambaccian suggests {{that the decision to}} deport the Romanian provocateur was not politically motivated. He writes that Bogdan-Pitești had exhausted the patience of French authorities by trafficking in stolen bicycles.|$|E

50|$|But {{the young}} {{students}} {{are grateful for}} her presence. They strain their necks <b>and</b> <b>lean</b> <b>over</b> seats to ask Pola questions. She brings to life what they studied in history books. Her stories fascinate them, and they sit quietly and attentively whenever she offers her knowledge.|$|R
60|$|Vandyke ruffled his long, black locks, disarranged his {{careless}} tie <b>and</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> to Madder.|$|E

60|$|After the day's uproar, the tranquillity of {{the scene}} was soothing, <b>and</b> I <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> the side to enjoy it.|$|R
60|$|Alison fancied {{that she}} heard a sound outside the window again, but she paid no heed to it, and as Nevis was about to lay {{his hand on the}} table <b>and</b> <b>lean</b> <b>over</b> it she moved her elbow sharply. The next moment the cloth slid down into a heap on the floor, and the letter disappeared.|$|R
60|$|Victoria bit her lip, <b>and</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> {{to brush}} a fly {{from the neck}} of her horse.|$|E
60|$|In {{another moment}} he had reined up beside Clarence <b>and</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> him, bearded, handsome, {{powerful}} and protecting.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Marx {{had been}} {{watching}} my face, <b>and</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> towards me with a question upon his lips.|$|E

6000|$|Captain Barber gave a hurried glance {{towards the}} door <b>and</b> then <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> the table [...] "Broken ’art," [...] he whispered, sorrowfully.|$|R
60|$|Gascoyne <b>and</b> Henry <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> {{the stern}} {{in order to}} avoid being overheard by those around them, and conversed in low tones.|$|R
60|$|For {{the gloomy}} head waiter re-entered <b>and</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> {{the back of}} Mr. Fyshe's chair and whispered to him.|$|E
60|$|Colonel Bishop set {{his foot}} upon the crossbar, <b>and</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> his victim, a cruel {{smile on his}} full, coarse face.|$|E

60|$|On {{would come}} the launch, {{whistling}}, and on we would go, drifting. At {{about a hundred}} yards off, she would start whistling like mad, and the people would come <b>and</b> <b>lean</b> <b>over</b> the side, <b>and</b> roar at us; but we never heard them! Harris would be telling us an anecdote about his mother, and George and I would not have missed {{a word of it}} for worlds.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Good night,' <b>and</b> he <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> her <b>and</b> {{kissed her}} forehead, in a grave {{grateful}} way {{that brought the}} tears into her eyes as he silently departed.|$|R
60|$|I {{leaned against}} the {{balustrade}} all numb, watching them depart. I saw Cosimo come upon her other side <b>and</b> <b>lean</b> <b>over</b> her as he moved, so slim and graceful, beside her own slight, graceful figure. Then I sank to the cushions of the seat she had vacated, and stayed there with my misery until the night had closed about the place, and the white marble pillars looked ghostly and unreal.|$|R
60|$|The {{seven men}} shrugged their {{shoulders}} helplessly, and Hezekiah, looking depressed, lit his pipe, and went <b>and</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> the side.|$|E
60|$|When Mrs. Liddell had gone, {{she rose}} <b>and</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> the counter. Marcella opened her burning eyes and pulled herself wearily together.|$|E
60|$|The spell, {{whatever}} it may have been, had passed. The young man lifted his hat <b>and</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> {{the side of the}} coach.|$|E
60|$|BURKE--I'll {{be going}} down to her, then. But first I'm {{thinking}} I'll take this chance when we're alone to {{have a word with}} you. [He sits down opposite CHRIS at the table <b>and</b> <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> toward him.] <b>And</b> that word is soon said. I'm marrying your Anna before this day is out, and you might as well make up your mind to it {{whether you like it or}} no.|$|R
60|$|She {{saw that}} her mother wished to speak, <b>and</b> <b>leaned</b> down <b>over</b> her, for Madame Duchesne could not as yet raise her voice above a whisper.|$|R
60|$|Benson {{died that}} night. He {{remained}} defiant {{almost to the}} last; but just before he went out, he motioned to me, <b>and</b> I <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> to catch the faintly whispered words.|$|R
60|$|Whereupon Bo {{turned her}} back to Riggs and looked out of the window. The man laughed. Then he stood up <b>and</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> Helen.|$|E
6000|$|... "To whom {{does your}} amiable wish refer?" [...] asked a brother-officer named Stewart, {{who came up}} just then <b>and</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> the bulwarks beside him.|$|E
60|$|I {{thought that}} {{after that she}} must surely go away. But she did nothing of the sort. She came <b>and</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> the rail by my side.|$|E

He touches the sleeping man's hand <b>and</b> <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> to kiss him... and is surprised when the kiss is returned.|$|R
6000|$|At that instant, as I {{looked up}} in my agony of {{suspense}} towards the brink of the precipice, with the liquid fire rising apace to seize me, I saw Kea, all breathless with haste, rush eagerly {{up to the edge}} <b>and</b> <b>lean</b> <b>over</b> towards me. In her hands, O joy, she held a large coil or ring of something. Thank heaven! Thank heaven! My heart bounded with delight. Saved! saved! It was rope she was carrying! ...|$|R
60|$|The squire {{raised his}} gun, the rowing ceased, <b>and</b> we <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> {{to the other}} side to keep the balance, and all was so nicely {{contrived}} that we did not ship a drop.|$|R
