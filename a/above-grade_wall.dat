40|$|As a {{response}} to the global warming, building sector aims to be more energy efficient. The adoption of some energy efficient measures may have potential negative impacts on the building performance under a changing future climate. This study investigates the impact of future climate changes on the building performance of a typical Canadian single-family house built in compliance with current Quebec Energy Code (QEC) and retrofitted to the Passivehaus standard (PH). The building performance is evaluated in terms of energy consumption, thermal comfort, and durability over the current year, 2020, 2050, and 2080. For the energy consumption and the thermal comfort five shading device scenarios are proposed. The thermal comfort is evaluated using an adaptive model for naturally ventilated houses. Durability is also evaluated in terms of the freeze thaw risk on brick and the biochemical risk on plywood. Durability analysis is carried out on two types of <b>above-grade</b> <b>wall</b> assemblies that meet the QEC standards and retrofitted options to the PH. The future weather files are generated using General Circulation Models (GCM) HadCM 3 with the IPCC’s A 2 emission scenario. Simulation results showed that by upgrading the current typical houses in Canada to the PH standard, compared to the current climate, the overall thermal performance of the PH in terms of the energy consumption and the thermal comfort would decrease by 2080. This study concludes that upgrading the current wall assemblies to the PH standard would increase the freeze thaw risk of the brick veneer, however, compared to the current climate this risk would decrease under 2080 climate. While the biochemical risk of the plywood sheathing defined by the moisture content criteria would decrease, the risk defined by RHT criteria would increase over future climates. The mold growth risk on the plywood sheathing would likely decrease under the future climates...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{polyethylene}} vapour barriers is well {{integrated into}} building codes and the Canadian construction industry, {{a result of}} significant investment in research and training. Their use has resulted in significant improvement in building envelope air tightness when properly detailed. Contractors and inspectors have developed a strong understanding of the details and practices required to achieve tight and reliable enclosures. However, some groups have expressed concerns that polyethylene vapour barriers may reduce drying and entrap moisture. In particular, problems have been encountered with below-grade walls where inward drying of initial construction moisture within the concrete foundation walls is trapped by polyethylene sheets. Problems have also been identified in <b>above-grade</b> <b>walls</b> where absorptive and non-ventilated claddings are employed. A research program is currently underway to determine the significance/insignificance of potential moisture problems due to plastic sheeting in <b>above-grade</b> and below-grade <b>wall</b> assemblies. The research is aimed to outline cases where performance can be improved, and changes that could reduce inappropriate use. Finally, the research aims to address the benefits/risks wit...|$|R
40|$|Load-bearing brick-masonry multifamily {{buildings}} are prevalent {{in urban areas}} {{across much of the}} Northeast and mid-Atlantic. In most instances, these {{buildings are}} un-insulated unless they have been renovated within the past two decades. Affordable housing capital budgets typically limit what can be spent and energy improvements often {{take a back seat to}} basic capital improvements such as interior finish upgrades and basic repairs. The Consortium for Advanced Residential Buildings (CARB) is researching cost effective solution packages for significant energy efficiency and indoor air-quality improvements in these urban buildings. To explore how these low-cost retrofits can effectively integrate energy efficiency upgrades, CARB partnered with Columbus Property Management and Development, Inc. on a community-scale gut rehabilitation project located at 56 th Street and Walnut Street in Philadelphia, consisting of 32 units in eleven 3 -story buildings. These buildings were built in the early 1900 s using stone foundations and solid brick-masonry walls. They were renovated in the 1990 s to have interior light gauge metal framing with R- 13 batt in the <b>above-grade</b> <b>walls,</b> induced-draft furnaces, and central air conditioning...|$|R
40|$|Coating <b>above-grade</b> {{exterior}} concrete <b>walls</b> is {{an effective}} and economical way to both decorate and protect concrete. Monotonous gray concrete {{can be turned into}} colors appealing to the eye, adding warmth and scale to an otherwise unattractive facade. Texture can be added to give liveliness to an otherwise flat and unappealing surface, and depth and accent features can be added at a fraction of what it would cost to create them with formwork. Besides adding color, texture, and form, high-performance acrylic-textured coating systems provide a layer of protection against concrete deterioration. The success of these systems, however, depends on a number of factors, including: ● surface preparation; ● the chemical and physical condition of the concrete substrate; ● priming; ● product selection (coating must possess right properties for service conditions); and ● professional application under favorable drying conditions. Surface preparatio...|$|R
