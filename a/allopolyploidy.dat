40|$|The role of polyploidy, {{particularly}} <b>allopolyploidy,</b> {{in plant}} diversification {{is a subject}} of debate. Whole-genome duplications precede the origins of many major clades (e. g., angiosperms, Brassicaceae, Poaceae), suggesting that polyploidy drives diversification. However, theoretical arguments and empirical studies suggest that polyploid lineages may actually have lower speciation rates and higher extinction rates than diploid lineages. We focus here on the grass tribe Andropogoneae, an economically and ecologically important group of C 4 species with a high frequency of polyploids. A phylogeny was constructed for ca. 10 % of the species of the clade, based on sequences of four concatenated low-copy nuclear loci.

40|$|Polyploidy, a {{state in}} which the {{chromosome}} complement has undergone an increase, is {{a major force in}} evolution. Understanding the consequences of polyploidy has received much attention, and allopolyploids, which result from the union of two different parental genomes, are of particular interest because they must overcome a suite of biological responses to this merger, known as "genome shock. " A key question is what happens to gene expression of the two gene copies following allopolyploidization, but until recently the tools to answer this question on a genome-wide basis were lacking. Here we utilize high throughput transcriptome sequencing to produce the first genome-wide picture of gene expression response to <b>allopolyploidy</b> in fungi. A novel pipeline for assigning sequence reads to the gene copies was used to quantify their expression in a fungal allopolyploid. We find that the transcriptional response to <b>allopolyploidy</b> is predominantly conservative: both copies of most genes are retained; over half the genes inherit parental gene expression patterns; and parental differential expression is often lost in the allopolyploid. Strikingly, the patterns of gene expression change are highly concordant with the genome-wide expression results of a cotton allopolyploid. The very different nature of these two allopolyploids implies a conserved, eukaryote-wide transcriptional response to genome merger. We provide evidence that the transcriptional responses we observe are mostly driven by intrinsic differences between the regulatory systems in the parent species, and from this propose a mechanistic model in which the cross-kingdom conservation in transcriptional response reflects conservation of the mutational processes underlying eukaryotic gene regulatory evolution.

The split between Potentilla (=Potentillinae) and Fragariinae received better support than in previous studies. The phylogeny of Fragariinae was found to be consistent with classifying ten genera: Alchemilla in wide sense (incl. Aphanes and Lachemilla), Comarum, Sibbaldia, Sibbaldianthe, Sibbaldiopsis, Chamaerhodos, Drymocallis, Dasiphora, Potaninia, Fragaria, and also including a few orphan Potentilla species. The segregated genera Ivesia, Horkelia, Horkeliella and Duchesnea were found to be nested within Potentilla, corroborating earlier studies, while the segregated genus Argentina (P. anserina and close relatives) showed an ambiguous position. Plastid and nuclear (ribosomal) phylogenies were compared and incongruences were detected as potential instances of allopolyploid speciation. Five strongly supported incongruences were detected in Fragariinae and four of them were considered to be potentially caused by <b>allopolyploidy.</b> In addition, five supported incongruences were found in Potentilla. Alchemilla in the wide sense was found to contain four major clades, African Alchemilla, Eurasian Alchemilla, Lachemilla and Aphanes.

Methods: Illumina RNA-seq data were generated for phylogenetically strategic species in Agavoideae. Paleopolyploidy was inferred in analyses of frequency plots for synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (K-s) between Hosta, Agave, and Chlorophytum paralogous and orthologous gene pairs. Phylogenies of gene families including paralogous genes for these species and outgroup species were estimated to place inferred paleopolyploid events on a species tree. Key results: K-s frequency plots suggested paleopolyploid events {{in the history of the}} genera Agave, Hosta, and Chlorophytum. Phylogenetic analyses of gene families estimated from transcriptome data revealed two polyploid events: one predating the last common ancestor of Agave and Hosta and one within the lineage leading to Chlorophytum. Conclusions: We found that polyploidy and the origin of the Yucca-Agave bimodal karyotype co-occur on the same lineage consistent with the hypothesis that the bimodal karyotype is a consequence of <b>allopolyploidy.</b> We discuss this and alternative mechanisms for the formation of the Yucca-Agave bimodal karyotype. More generally, we illustrate how the use of next-generation sequencing technology is a cost-efficient means for assessing genome evolution in nonmodel species...|$|E
40|$|Polyploidy and {{aneuploidy}} are conspicuous {{features of}} chromosomal {{evolution in the}} Poaceae; at least 80 % of grass species are of polyploid origin (Stebbins 1985). The original basic chromosome number for the Poaceae is not known and {{has been the subject}} of much speculation. In the large tribe Paniceae, which includes the genus Brachiaria, the most common basic chromosome number is x = 9 (DeWet 1986). The predominance of x = 9 in Brachiaria genus had been reported in several studies (Basappa et al. 1987; Honfi et al. 1990; Bernini and Marin-Morales 2001; Mendes-Bonato et al. 2002, 2006; Utsunomiya et al. 2005). More recently, a new chromosome number, x = 6, was determined for B. dictyoneura (Risso-Pascotto et al. 2006). There is a large predominance of polyploid forms in the genus Brachiaria and tetraploids prevail. The origin of polyploidy, however, has never been pursued in this genus. Cytological evidence from analysis of meiotic behaviour, including chromosome pairing at diakinesis, led to the suggestion that autotetraploidy and segmental <b>allopolyploidy</b> could have contributed to evolution in some species (Mendes-Bonato et al. 2002, 2006;Utsunomiya et al. 2005). On the other hand, in two pentaploid accessions of B. brizantha (2 n = 5 x = 45) there was clear evidence of <b>allopolyploidy</b> (Mendes et al. 2006). This paper reports the unusual cytological behaviour during meiosis in one accession of Brachiaria humidicola from the Embrapa Beef Cattle germplasm collection. 201...|$|E
40|$|<b>Allopolyploidy</b> (interspecific {{hybridisation}} and polyploidy) {{has played}} a significant role in the evolutionary history of angiosperms and can result in genomic, epigenetic and transcriptomic perturbations. We examine the immediate effects of <b>allopolyploidy</b> on repetitive DNA by comparing the genomes of synthetic and natural Nicotiana tabacum with diploid progenitors N. tomentosiformis (paternal progenitor) and N. sylvestris (maternal progenitor). Using next generation sequencing, a recently developed graph-based repeat identification pipeline, Southern blot and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) we characterise two highly repetitive DNA sequences (NicCL 3 and NicCL 7 / 30). Analysis of two independent high-throughput DNA sequencing datasets indicates NicCL 3 forms 1. 6 – 1. 9 % of the genome in N. tomentosiformis, sequences that occur in multiple, discontinuous tandem arrays scattered over several chromosomes. Abundance estimates, based on sequencing depth, indicate NicCL 3 is almost absent in N. sylvestris and has been dramatically reduced in copy number in the allopolyploid N. tabacum. Surprisingly elimination of NicCL 3 is repeated in some synthetic lines of N. tabacum in their forth generation. The retroelement NicCL 7 / 30, which occurs interspersed with NicCL 3, is also under-represented but to a much lesser degree, revealing targeted elimination of the latter. Analysis of paired-end sequencing data indicates the tandem component of NicCL 3 has been preferentially removed in natural N. tabacum, increasing the proportion of the dispersed component. This occurs across multiple blocks of discontinuous repeats an...|$|E
40|$|<b>Allopolyploidy</b> {{has played}} a {{prominent}} role in organismal evolution, particularly in angiosperms. Allohexaploidization is a critical step leading to the formation of common wheat as a new species, Triticum aestivum, as well as for bestowing its remarkable adaptability. A recent study documented that the initial stages of wheat allohexaploidization was associated with rampant genetic and epigenetic instabilities at genomic regions flanking a retrotransposon family named Veju. Although this finding is in line with the prevailing opinion of rapid genomic instability associated with nascent plant <b>allopolyploidy,</b> its relevance to speciation of T. aestivum remains unclear. Here, we show that genetic instability at genomic regions flanking the Veju, flanking a more abundant retroelement BARE- 1, as well as at a large number of randomly sampled genomic loci, is all extremely rare or nonexistent in preselected individuals representing three sets of independently formed nascent allohexaploid wheat lines, which had a transgenerationally stable genomic constitution analogous to that of T. aestivum. In contrast, extensive and transgenerationally heritable repatterning of DNA methylation at all three kinds of genomic loci were reproducibly detected. Thus, our results suggest that rampant genetic instability associated with nascent allohexaploidization in wheat likely represents incidental and anomalous phenomena that are confined to by-product individuals inconsequential to the establishment of the newly formed plants toward speciation of T. aestivum; instead, extensive and heritable epigenetic remodeling coupled with preponderant genetic stability is generally associated with nascent wheat allohexaploidy, and therefore, more likely a contributory factor to the speciation event(s) ...|$|E
