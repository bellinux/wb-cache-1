40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} vocational higher school students’ conceptual structures of accounting. Data was collected from 96 students using a free word association test. The results of this research revealed the conceptual structures of <b>accounting</b> of <b>the</b> participant students with various dimensions. Eight different categories were formed with the participant students’ response words about accounting. These categories were: tools used in <b>accounting,</b> <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> profession and education, <b>accounting</b> results, <b>accounts,</b> <b>the</b> <b>accounting</b> environment, mathematical operations, the scientific quality of <b>accounting</b> and <b>the</b> professional ethics of <b>accounting.</b> <b>The</b> category with the highest frequency was tools used in <b>accounting</b> whereas <b>the</b> category with the lowest frequency was professional ethics of accounting. It was observed when the categories formed were analyzed that, accounting students’ conceptual structures of accounting were on various dimensions and at an adequate level.
