25|$|Joan Kerr {{indicates}} that St. Saviour's Cathedral, Goulburn {{was one of}} Blacket's favourite buildings, as, unlike his cathedrals in Sydney and Perth, he was not hampered either by distance, or a previous architect's foundations. It was here that Blacket was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>really</b> indulge a love of Flowing Decorated ornamentation. There are three very large windows, of seven and six lights in the chancel and transept ends, each with highly elaborate and distinct tracery, inspired by, but not identical to, famous Medieval windows. That in the North transept has a wheel based on the Visconti emblem of a window in Milan Cathedral, but by the judicious placement of two small tracery lights, Blacket has {{turned it into a}} sunflower, an emblem frequently used by one of the stained glass firms he employed, Lyon and Cottier. Other decorative features include the foliate carving of the capitals, much of it in the stiff-leaf style of Wells Cathedral; pierced cinquefoil openings in panels above the hammerbeams; and a screen of white New Zealand stone. The stained glass includes windows by two of England's major firms: John Hardman & Co. and Heaton, Butler and Bayne, and Sydney's two leading firms: Lyon and Cottier and Ashwin and Falconer.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} whether she got sick of shooting on the Hydra holding cell set, Elizabeth Mitchell responded I guess so. It was creepy because {{it was supposed to}} be underwater, so it was a little bit dingy but kind of great at the same time ... what I will miss is just being one on one with another actor. And then also one on two obviously when it was Michael [...] because the three of us, it was almost like being on stage. We were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>really</b> work off of each other and I thought you don't usually get that in a TV show.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{regard the}} Zoo TV Tour {{as one of}} rock's most memorable tours. During the [...] "Zooropa" [...] leg of the tour, Guy Garcia of Time called Zoo TV [...] "one of the most electrifying rock shows ever staged". In 1997, Robert Hilburn wrote that [...] "It's not {{unreasonable}} {{to think of it}} as the Sgt. Pepper's of rock tours." [...] In 2002, Tom Doyle of Q called it [...] "still the most spectacular rock tour staged by any band", and in 2013, the magazine listed it as one of the [...] "ten greatest gigs of all time". In 2009, critic Greg Kot said, [...] "Zoo TV remains the finest supersized tour mounted by any band in the last two decades." [...] Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork wrote in a review of Achtung Babys 20th anniversary reissue, [...] "Even 20 years on, the tour looks like something to behold, a singularly inventive experience that no band—including U2 itself—has been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>really</b> expound upon in a meaningful way." [...] Rolling Stone included the tour on its 2017 list of [...] "The 50 Greatest Concerts of the Last 50 Years".|$|E
5000|$|Record {{producer}} Rick Rubin has {{remarked on}} the song's structure, [...] "It takes such confidence <b>to</b> be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> get <b>really</b> quiet and loose {{for such a}} long time. Led Zeppelin completely changed how we look at what popular music can be." ...|$|R
60|$|HIGGINS. You know, Pickering, {{that woman}} {{has the most}} {{extraordinary}} ideas about me. Here I am, a shy, diffident sort of man. I've never been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> feel <b>really</b> grown-up and tremendous, like other chaps. And yet she's firmly persuaded that I'm an arbitrary overbearing bossing kind of person. I can't account for it.|$|R
25|$|Recently, Mike Faiella, co-creator of Fantasimation Studios {{and who was}} {{directly}} involved with Kappie the Kangaroo, stated that Kyle was physically in the studio, worked on said productions and was acknowledged off being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> draw <b>really</b> fast, as the pencil tests that {{he did in the}} studio were shifted to production the moment he finished.|$|R
500|$|I {{definitely}} don't go {{the straight}} and narrow path, and you know, I definitely kinda like to experiment and collaborate. And so, I think it's taken me and Max this long to work together because of that, because what he does is genius and he is a classic hitmaker. But when I was coming out it was {{at a time when we}} had the huge pop explosion, and he was all over radio and I just wanted to work with others like Linda Perry and do that route and do [...] "Beautiful" [...] and songs like that. We built a level of respect for each other. So at this point, coming together, especially embracing my true pop-starness, at this point in my career having come full circle, I was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>really</b> truly embrace it, and embrace him. He gave me the freedom to really sing on these songs, and have a little more creative freedom because I heard he is a stickler for melody and a melody king and I was scared, I was like 'Oh my God! I won't be able to collaborate here.' But he couldn't have been more great, and this is a really fun song, super up-tempo. It's probably the most dancey-ish song on my record, but it's called 'Let There Be Love' but it's free and representative of what this album is about.|$|E
500|$|Metcalfe {{spoke of}} the new storyline, saying how [...] "honoured" [...] she was {{to take part in}} the storyline as well as praising the writer, Anna Clements: [...] "I'm honoured to have been given this storyline to raise {{awareness}} of such an important cause. Count the Kicks is a fantastic charity, which aims to teach expectant mothers about noticing changes in their pregnancy to reduce the risk of stillbirth. And working with Sands has helped me understand how Mercedes would cope with life after her baby has died. Mercedes has already been through so much tragedy in her life, but the death of her son will show a much more fragile side to her character. The scripts are brilliantly written by Anna Clements and with the help of the two charities, I was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>really</b> understand what Mercedes is going through." [...] Erica Stewart, the bereavement support services manager at Sands, said: [...] "We're pleased to have been approached by the researchers and writers at Hollyoaks for advice and help to ensure that this heartbreaking storyline is portrayed truthfully and sensitively. Stillbirth is not rare and it's a tragedy that can happen to anyone. Sadly thousands of babies die each year in the UK. In 2013, over 100 babies every week were stillborn or died soon after birth. For a show like Hollyoaks with a youth focus to be covering this devastating experience is a brilliant way of raising awareness of the issues surrounding baby death among a younger audience who may have not otherwise come across them." [...] Metcalfe later further discussed the storyline, revealing that when she read the scripts she had [...] "a lump in my throat", which made cry and when she had finished reading the scripts, she was [...] "sat their sobbing". She continued to say: [...] "When it came to playing it on set I did minimal rehearsals because I didn't want to wear out the true meaning of the words." [...] before praising the script writing, calling them [...] "brilliant" [...] and stating she did not have to work hard to find the [...] "level of emotion", [...] "The words were all there on the page. I broke down every time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Commenting on his {{association}} with the S/M subgenre of Nikkatsu's Roman Pornos, Konuma said, [...] "In general, the roman porn audience wants to see something they can't experience in everyday life. These people get excited about seeing acts which they may - or {{may not want to}} do to their wives or mates. Things they would never be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>really</b> do without ending up in jail or divorce. For example, I was often assigned to make movies with rape scenes. I am not a person who could possibly perform rape. I want to see a lady's happy face while having sex... Movies are fantasies. Sometimes they might be ugly, but they're still fantasies. I was the dreamweaver." ...|$|E
50|$|A big {{improvement}} came in {{the mid-1970s}} from Barry M. Trost's group. It was found that siloxyvinylcyclopropanes {{as well as the}} analogous sulfinylvinylcyclopropanes could be used as substrates to build interesting annulated cyclopentene structures. Albeit these reactions still required reaction temperatures above 300 °C they were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> make <b>really</b> useful products arising from the annulation of cyclopentene to a present ring system.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Various {{efficient}} game problem solvers {{are based}} on PN-Search. Especially depth-first versions of PN-Search like DF-PN or PDS – contrary to other known techniques – are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> solve <b>really</b> hard problems. However, the performance of DF-PN and PDS decreases dramatically when the search space significantly exceeds available memory. A simple trick to overcome this problem is presented. Experiments on Atari Go and Lines of Action show great practical value of the proposed enhancement. ...|$|R
2500|$|O'Connor in June 1993 wrote {{a public}} letter in The Irish Times which asked people to [...] "stop hurting" [...] her: [...] "If only I can {{fight off the}} voices of my parents / and gather a sense of {{self-esteem}} / Then I'll be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>REALLY</b> sing ..." [...] The letter repeated accusations of abuse by her parents as a child which O'Connor had made in interviews. Her brother Joseph defended their father to the newspaper but agreed regarding their mother's [...] "extreme and violent abuse, both emotional and physical". Sinead said that month, [...] "Our family is very messed up. We can't communicate with each other. We are all in agony. I for one am in agony." ...|$|E
2500|$|Promotion on {{the album}} ended soon after its December release and Norwood {{subsequently}} started work on a second album with Epic Records. Amongst those to record with her were songwriting and production partners Tricky Stewart, The-Dream, Stargate, Ne-Yo, and Human collaborator Brian Kennedy. Expressing her dissatisfaction with Humans commercial performance, Norwood told Blues & Soul magazine she was [...] "a little disappointed about that" [...] but also felt [...] "pleased that Sony has given me another chance to do another project that I feel they're totally behind. In hindsight I do feel the last album was a little political. So a lotta changes have been made since Human – and hopefully they're changes for the better! Because, having got all the deep stuff off my chest, I'm now <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>really</b> tap into the fun part of music again [...] it's exactly the type of album that I need to be makiing right now!" ...|$|E
6000|$|These {{are a few}} of {{the more}} salient {{features}} of stage [...] "law" [...] so far as we have been able to grasp it up to the present; but as fresh acts and clauses and modifications appear to be introduced for each new play, we have abandoned all hope of ever being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>really</b> comprehend the subject.|$|E
50|$|The {{wildlife}} {{in the park}} includes the Big Five. The preserved plains of the Sabi Sands and the Kruger National Park hold one of highest concentrations of game per hectare on the planet. This, coupled with ethical and responsible conservation management, have resulted in animals which are highly habituated to human presence. Our landrovers pose no threat, and we <b>able</b> <b>to</b> get <b>really</b> close <b>to</b> countless animal species (including predators, general game, reptiles, insects, and birds-a-plenty).|$|R

6000|$|Wednesday.--Do you know, I think I am much better. I {{really enjoy}} things, and I really feel dull occasionally, {{neither of which}} was {{possible}} with me before; and though I am still tired and weak, I almost think I feel a stirring among the dry bones. O, I should like to recover, and be once more well and happy and fit for work! And then <b>to</b> be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> begin <b>really</b> <b>to</b> my life; to have done, {{for the rest of}} time, with preluding and doubting; and to take hold of the pillars strongly with Samson--to burn my ships with (whoever did it).

60|$|In {{a single}} week, {{at a time}} when the back of the war had seemed to be broken, we had lost nearly twelve hundred men with seven guns. The men of the Free State--for the {{fighting}} was mainly done by commandos from the Ladybrand, Winburg, Bethlehem, and Harrismith districts--deserve great credit for this fine effort, and their leader De Wet confirmed the reputation which he had already gained as a dashing and indefatigable leader. His force was so weak that when Lord Roberts was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>really</b> direct his own against it, he brushed it away before him; but the manner in which De Wet took advantage of Roberts's enforced immobility, and dared to get behind so mighty an enemy, was a fine exhibition of courage and enterprise. The public at home chafed at this sudden and unexpected turn of affairs; but the General, constant to his own fixed purpose, did not permit his strength to be wasted, and his cavalry to be again disorganised, by flying excursions, but waited grimly until he should be strong enough to strike straight at Pretoria.|$|E
5000|$|Allmusic {{awarded the}} album 4½ stars with its review by Scott Yanow stating: [...] "Jimmy Woods' {{original}} sound and passionate, chance-taking style make one {{wonder why he}} was never <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>really</b> make it; his music has not really dated".|$|E

Sivin suggests that {{we need to look at}} the scientific development in China on its own terms.|$|E
50|$|Ellis (born 1810) was a Nez Perce leader. He was a {{grandson}} of Hohots Ilppilp. As a teenager {{he went to}} the Red River Colony where he learned English. He lived in the area of Kamiah, Idaho where he was involved in farming as well as sheep, cattle and horse ranching. Ellis was the first person appointed as leader of all the Nez Perce, at the urging of Elijah White, the U.S. Indian agent for the Oregon Country in 1842. However the idea of a chief for all Nez Perce was so foreign to their previous organization that he was not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> exercise <b>really</b> power as such.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: ConnectIT uses a {{graphical}} representation to express strategies {{for playing the}} connect-four game. With this tool we can transfer complex knowledge about the connect-four game itself, simple algorithmic concepts and modern high-level component-based modeling techniques from theoretical grounds into an inspiring and practical learning experience. We proved the adequacy of this approach in several projects with school pupils who had no experience in computer science. Solely based on intuition and knowledge about the game, they were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> build <b>really</b> competitive strategies. ConnectIT’s intuitive approach to strategy formulation and enactment could be an as-set when applied to serious games, e. g. in business and management. ...|$|R
