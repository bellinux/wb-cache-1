5|$|Adkins grew up {{in poverty}} {{in the midst of}} the Depression, and his spirited, unusual {{lifestyle}} is reflected in his music. His songs, which he began recording and distributing locally in the mid-1950s, explored <b>an</b> <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> sexual intercourse, and decapitation, and were obscure outside of West Virginia until the 1980s. The newfound popularity secured him a cult following, spawned the Norton Records label, and helped usher in the genre known as psychobilly.|$|E
5|$|Carolina wrens {{adapt to}} various {{habitats}}. Natural habitats include {{various types of}} woodland such as oak hardwoods and mixed oak-pine woodlands, ash and elmwoods, hickory-oak woodlands with a healthy amount of tangled undergrowth. The preferred habitats are riparian forests, brushy edges, swamps, overgrown farmlands, and suburban yards with abundant thick shrubs and trees, and parks. It has <b>an</b> <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> dilapidated buildings and unkempt yards in man-made areas. Subspecies burleighi and neophilus inhabit slash pine and palmettos.|$|E
5|$|In Buah Rindu, Amir shows <b>an</b> <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> using {{traditional}} Malay poetic forms {{such as the}} quatrain, but unlike the highly fixed traditional forms, he mixes the rhyming patterns. The text is dominated by terms related to love and searching, and according to Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw the collection is united by a theme of longing. Johns states that the imagery in Buah Rindu is dependent on traditional Malay literature, and that Amir's terminology is heavily influenced by classical Malay poetry. The author's use of language is also notably coloured by Javanese terms and ideas, and another source of influence appears to be Indian literature, with references to Hindu gods and goddesses.|$|E

40|$|We {{synthesized}} a VIP analog {{that combines}} mutations that decrease the <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> the VPAC 1 receptor but maintain <b>a</b> high <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> the VPAC 2 receptor with an amino-terminal hexanoylation {{that increases the}} <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> the VPAC 2 receptor with a limited decrease in the affinity of the VPAC 1 receptor. The resulting Hexanoyl[A 19,K(27, 28) ]VIP had the expected properties of <b>a</b> high <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> the VPAC 2 receptor and <b>a</b> low <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> the VPAC 1 receptor and also <b>a</b> low <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> the PAC 1 and secretin receptors. With a 1000 -fold preference for the VPAC 2 receptor and a IC 50 value of binding of 1 nM, this compound is the most potent and the most selective agonist presently described.

5|$|In Buah Rindu, {{particularly}} {{its earlier}} poems, Amir shows <b>an</b> <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> using traditional Malay poetic forms {{such as the}} quatrain (found in pantun and syair). However, unlike the highly fixed traditional forms, Amir mixes the rhyming patterns; for instance, one quatrain may have a monorhyme (seloka) while the next may have an alternating simple 4-line (pantun) pattern. Lines are generally divided by a clear caesura, {{and in some cases}} even two. The caesura may not always be in the centre of a line; it is at times towards the front, and at times towards the rear.|$|E
5|$|In {{competitive}} inhibition, {{the substrate}} and inhibitor cannot bind to the enzyme {{at the same}} time, {{as shown in the}} figure on the right. This usually results from the inhibitor having <b>an</b> <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> the active site of an enzyme where the substrate also binds; the substrate and inhibitor compete for access to the enzyme's active site. This type of inhibition can be overcome by sufficiently high concentrations of substrate (Vmax remains constant), i.e., by out-competing the inhibitor. However, the apparent Km will increase as it takes a higher concentration of the substrate to reach the Km point, or half the Vmax. Competitive inhibitors are often similar in structure to the real substrate (see examples below).|$|E
5|$|Jose Sarria {{was born}} to Julio Sarria and Maria Dolores Maldonado. His parents did not marry and his father showed no {{interest}} in his son's life. Maria initially raised José Julio Sarria on her own, but when this became too difficult she placed him with another couple. Both they and his mother indulged his early interest in wearing girl's clothing. Sarria showed <b>an</b> <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> languages, which led to his first serious romance with another man. Sarria tutored Paul Kolish, an Austrian baron who had fled from the Nazis. Sarria and Kolish fell in love, and their relationship endured until Kolish and his son {{were killed in a}} car accident in 1947.|$|E

40|$|The endogenously {{produced}} nonapeptide (H-Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe-Ser-Pro-Phe-Arg-OH) bradykinin (BK) {{is generated}} by cleavage of the larger precursor polypeptide (kininogen) by specific proteases (kallikreins) within numerous tissues of the body [1]. The biologic actions of BK and Lys-BK are terminated when the kininase family of proteolytic enzymes degrades these peptides [1, 2]. Two major BK receptor subtypes, namely, B 1 and B 2, mediate the functional effects of BK and Lys-BK [1 - 3]. Although the B 2 -subtype is found under normal physiologic conditions, the B 1 subtype is typically induced during injury or trauma [1]. The B 1 subtype has <b>a</b> low <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> BK and <b>a</b> high <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> Des-Arg 9 -BK; however, the B 2 subtype exhibits <b>a</b> high <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> BK and Lys-BK and <b>a</b> low <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> Des-Arg 9 -BK [1].

5|$|The mockingbird's habitat {{varies by}} location, but it prefers open areas with sparse vegetation. In the eastern regions, {{suburban}} and urban {{areas such as}} parks, gardens are frequent residential areas. It has <b>an</b> <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> mowed lawns with shrubs within proximity for shade and nesting. In western regions, desert scrub, chaparral are among its preferred habitats When foraging for food, it prefers short grass. This bird does not nest in densely forested areas, and generally resides in the same habitats year round.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the war there were about 35,000 people who had been born in either Germany or Austria-Hungary living in Australia. Due to large-scale German migration in the late 19th century, there were also an inestimable number of people of German origin, many of whom maintained <b>an</b> <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> their ancestral roots. Many of these were naturalised Australians, and indeed it is believed that many men of German origin enlisted in the AIF. However, due to concerns about the loyalties of some members of the German and Austrian communities, internment camps were set up where those suspected of unpatriotic acts were sent. In total it is believed that 4,500 people were interned under the provisions of the War Precautions Act, of which 700 were naturalised Australians and 70 Australian-born. Following the end of the war, 6,150 were deported.|$|E
5|$|Because higher league {{placement}} {{results in}} {{a greater share of}} television rights, success on the field generates greater income for the club. Since the inception of the Premier League, Manchester United has received the largest share of the revenue generated from the BSkyB broadcasting deal. Manchester United has also consistently enjoyed the highest commercial income of any English club; in 2005–06, the club's commercial arm generated £51million, compared to £42.5million at Chelsea, £39.3million at Liverpool, £34million at Arsenal and £27.9million at Newcastle United. A key sponsorship relationship was with sportswear company Nike, who managed the club's merchandising operation as part of a £303million 13-year partnership between 2002 and 2015. Through Manchester United Finance and the club's membership scheme, One United, those with <b>an</b> <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> the club can purchase a range of branded goods and services. Additionally, Manchester United-branded media services – such as the club's dedicated television channel, MUTV – have allowed the club to expand its fan base to those beyond the reach of its Old Trafford stadium.|$|E

5|$|During Part II of {{the series}} the concept of , {{altering}} the quality of chakra, is introduced. Nature manipulation allows ninja, following certain training, to convert their chakra into one of five elements: earth, water, fire, wind, and lightning. Each element is predominant and subordinate to different elements; for example, fire is weak against water, but can easily counter and even gain strength when used against a wind-based jutsu and earth is weak against lightning based jutsu. Most ninja have a natural affinity {{for one of the}} five elements, allowing them to use jutsu of that type with greater ease. Ninja with <b>an</b> <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> fire, for instance, will be able to breathe fire much sooner than {{they will be able to}} manipulate water.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of the Jiajing Emperor (r. 1521–1567), the native Chinese {{ideology}} of Daoism was fully sponsored at the Ming court, while Tibetan Vajrayana and even Chinese Buddhism were ignored or suppressed. Even the History of Ming states that the Tibetan lamas discontinued their trips to Ming China and its court at this point. Grand Secretary Yang Tinghe under Jiajing was determined to break the eunuch influence at court which typified the Zhengde era, an example being the costly escort of the eunuch Liu Yun as described above in his failed mission to Tibet. The court eunuchs were in favor of expanding and building new commercial ties with foreign countries such as Portugal, which Zhengde deemed permissible since he had <b>an</b> <b>affinity</b> <b>for</b> foreign and exotic people.|$|E
