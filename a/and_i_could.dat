5|$|I reckon {{it really}} sums up just what I felt {{as far as}} the {{competition}} goes. It's a very overwhelming process to go through and you really do feel that there's something else that got you there. Especially with how I didn't feel confident before and then something just clicked <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> look people in the eyes and really try and deliver a song.|$|E
5|$|This {{was by far}} {{the biggest}} {{challenge}} I have ever taken on in my career, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not be more honored {{to be a part of}} such an amazing and historical event.

5|$|I fell in {{love with}} him as a ten-year-old boy. I saw him in a play in New York... a very well-staged melodrama which was an {{enormous}} hit for about a year—it was made as a movie later with somebody else. He had the leading role, and I never forgot him. And through the years I'd seen him in movies—little things. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never forget that performance of his. He's always played very stereotyped parts in pictures but is one of the best actors I've ever known. I have such respect for him. You play next to him and you just feel the thing that you do with a big actor—this dynamo going on.|$|E

60|$|If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{only have}} had my last melancholy hope {{realised}} in recovering {{the body of}} my beloved <b>and</b> lamented son, <b>I</b> should have returned home somewhat comforted, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> then have been comparatively resigned.|$|R

25|$|I {{felt that}} air {{was forced into}} my mouth, I could not speak <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not close my mouth. I could {{understand}} well everything said to me. Other times I {{feel that there is}} food in my mouth and there is also a lot of salivation. I cannot speak.|$|E

After the couple married, Allen began writing material for them to use together ("With a vaudeville act, Portland <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be together, even if we couldn't find any work"), and the couple divided their time between the show business circuit, Allen's New England family home and Old Orchard Beach, Maine, in summers.|$|E
25|$|I had to gain {{them some}} time, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{think of nothing}} other than to attack. I had to stop them somehow. I distracted them, and I even managed to shoot one down, but then I myself was hit. My plane took 15 cannon hits, 80 by machine gun. My leg and my arm were injured, {{although}} I didn't feel a thing. I knew I probably wasn't {{going to make it}} back.|$|E
