50|$|In signal {{acquisition}} and audio, <b>anti-aliasing</b> is often done using an analogue <b>anti-aliasing</b> filter {{to remove the}} out-of-band component of the input signal prior to sampling with an analogue-to-digital converter. In digital photography, optical <b>anti-aliasing</b> filters are made of birefringent materials, and smooth the signal in the spatial optical domain.

500|$|Although Wipeout 2048 and Wipeout HD have {{a shared}} shader program {{and did not}} require {{retooling}} for the Vita's architecture, Roberts said that a [...] "great deal" [...] of time and attention was spent fine-tuning the game's shader effects for the Vita's GPU. Lovegrove thought that the method of working on a PlayStation 3 and its handheld counterpart was identical (a sentiment generally shared by the team), and Roberts said that the systems' similarities helped the team [...] "get moving quickly". Roberts added that the game's lighting system was identical to that of Wipeout HD; both games' ships shared image-based lighting, with blended diffuse and specular highlights effects and the vertex-based lighting system used for weaponry. According to Roberts, {{the main difference between}} the games was PlayStation Vita's utilisation of the effects via the GPU; PlayStation 3 relied on SPUs. The team decided to use <b>anti-aliased</b> colour buffers for real-time shadow rendering, instead of depth buffers. This gave the game greater transparency effects, since the memory cost of anti-aliasing was 8 bits per pixel; therefore, 4x MSAA (multisample anti-aliasing) buffers contained the same amount of memory as a 32-bit depth buffer. Another feature which Roberts considered an improvement was tone mapping (partly due to Vita's superior support of buffer formats), which gave Wipeout 2048 better exposure control and bloom effects.|$|E
2500|$|Prerendered (also {{known as}} closed) {{subtitles}} are separate video frames that are overlaid {{on the original}} video stream while playing. Prerendered subtitles are used on DVD and Blu-ray (though they are contained in the same file as the video stream). It is possible to turn them off or have multiple language subtitles and switch among them, but the player has to support such subtitles to display them. Also, subtitles are usually encoded as images with minimal bitrate and number of colors; they usually lack <b>anti-aliased</b> font rasterization. Also, changing such subtitles is hard, but special OCR software, such as SubRip exists to convert such subtitles to [...] "soft" [...] ones.|$|E

5000|$|ATI {{revealed}} Temporal <b>Anti-Aliasing,</b> a new <b>anti-aliasing</b> technology their chips {{were capable}} of. By {{taking advantage of}} the frame-to-eye effects of a framerate higher than 60 frame/s, the GPU is able to better smooth aliased edges by rotating the <b>anti-aliasing</b> sampling pattern between frames. A 2X software setting became perceptively equivalent to 4X. Unfortunately, it required the system to be able to maintain at least 60 frame/s or temporal <b>anti-aliasing</b> would cause a noticeable flickering, because the user would {{be able to see the}} alternating AA patterns. If the framerate could not be maintained, the driver will disable Temporal AA. However, in games which this performance level could be maintained, Temporal AA was a nice addition to ATI's excellent <b>anti-aliasing</b> options. Note, ATI's [...] "Temporal AA" [...] was actually a temporal dithering filter for spatial AA, not de facto temporal <b>anti-aliasing</b> (which must involve a controlled blending of the temporal subsamples from consecutive screens).|$|R
50|$|It is very {{important}} to avoid input signal overload when using an <b>anti-aliasing</b> filter. If the signal is strong enough, it can cause clipping at the analog-to-digital converter, even after filtering. When distortion due to clipping occurs after the <b>anti-aliasing</b> filter, it can create components outside the passband of the <b>anti-aliasing</b> filter; these components can then alias, causing the reproduction of other non-harmonically-related frequencies.|$|R
40|$|An <b>anti-aliasing</b> filter that {{incorporates}} a sampler is proposed to precede noise-shaping analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), such as discrete-time Δ Sigma modulators.

However, contrary to CT Δ Sigma modulators, the proposed <b>anti-aliasing</b> filter is not sensitive to clock jitter. Furthermore, its key characteristics include: (1) higher suppression of aliases, compared to a Butterworth filter of the same order (same number of opamps); and (2) high-pass shaping of the sampling errors. Its performance advantages are derived theoretically and then confirmed through behavioural simulations...|$|R

2500|$|ClearType in WPF {{supports}} sub-pixel positioning, natural advance widths, Y-direction anti-aliasing {{and hardware}} acceleration. WPF supports aggressive caching of pre-rendered ClearType text in video memory. The {{extent to which}} this is supported {{is dependent on the}} video card. DirectX 10 cards will be able to cache the font glyphs in video memory, then perform the composition (assembling of character glyphs in the correct order, with the correct spacing), alpha blending (application of anti-aliasing), and RGB blending (ClearType's sub-pixel color calculations), entirely in hardware. This means that only the original glyphs need to be stored in video memory once per font (Microsoft estimates that this would require 2MB of video memory per font), and other operations such as the display of <b>anti-aliased</b> text on top of other graphics including video can also be done with no computation {{effort on the part of}} the CPU. DirectX 9 cards will only be able to cache the alpha-blended glyphs in memory, thus requiring the CPU to handle glyph composition and alpha-blending before passing this to the video card. [...] Caching these partially rendered glyphs requires significantly more memory (Microsoft estimates 5MB per process).

40|$|In digital relays, <b>anti-aliasing</b> filters {{introduce}} additional time-delays in the phasor estimations. This time-delay {{reduces the}} speed of the protection relay. Removal of <b>anti-aliasing</b> filter from digital relay is beneficial {{from the point of view}} of cost, compactness, power dissipation, reliability and maintainability. Previously efforts have been made to remove <b>anti-aliasing</b> filter from digital relays using very high sampling rates. However, existing digital relays do not support very high sampling rates. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the possibility of phasor estimation without using <b>anti-aliasing</b> filter and very high sampling rates. Compressive Sampling (CS) theory has opened up a new possibility of signal reconstruction from sub-Nyquist rate samples. This paper proposes a CS based phasor estimation method for digital relays. The proposed method can work with the lower A/D sampling rates. The performance of the proposed method has been evaluated using signals generated by PSCAD software and mathematical equations. It is shown that the proposed phasor estimation method has faster response than the conventional approach. Results show that the frequency specification of <b>anti-aliasing</b> filter can be significantly relaxed in the proposed method. The complete removal of <b>anti-aliasing</b> filter is also possible at the cost of significant computational burden. In summary, this paper presents some promising results regarding removal of <b>anti-aliasing</b> filter from digital relays with lower sampling rates...|$|R
