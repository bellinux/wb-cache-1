40|$|One of {{the keys}} to the success of aerial {{refueling}} for probe-drogue aerial refueling system (PDARS) is the successful docking between the probe and drogue. The study of probe-drogue docking success probability offers an important support to achieving successful docking. During the docking phase of PDARS, based on prior information and reasonable assumptions for the movements of the drogue under atmospheric disturbance, the probe-drogue docking success probability is converted to the probability of the drogue center located in a specific area. A model of the probe-drogue docking success probability is established with and without <b>actuation</b> <b>error,</b> respectively.

40|$|Videos and VOS {{display of}} {{experimental}} tests with SuperDroid robot. The video shows the robot performing autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance. The VOS display shows {{a representation of}} some of the internal computation that is performed in order to build the velocity occupancy search space. Please see Chapter 4 for more details on experimental set-up. In order to autonomously navigate in an unknown environment, a robotic vehicle must be able to sense obstacles, determine their velocities, then select and execute a collision-free path that will lead quickly to a goal. However, the perceived location and motion of the obstacles will be uncertain due to the limited accuracy of the robot’s sensors. Thus, it is necessary to develop a system that can avoid moving obstacles using uncertain sensor data. The method proposed here is based on an occupancy grid —which has previously been used to avoid stationary obstacles in an uncertain environment—in conjunction with velocity obstacles—which allow a robot to avoid well-known moving obstacles. The combination of these techniques leads to velocity occupancy space (VOS) : a search space which allows the robot to avoid moving obstacles and navigate efficiently to a goal using uncertain sensor data. However, the basic VOS concept assumes holonomic robots that are capable of instantaneous and error free velocity changes¬ - capabilities that are not possessed by actual vehicles. Therefore, two extensions are derived by which VOS is adapted to work with actual robotic vehicles. The first extension to VOS is for an acceleration controlled, differential drive robot. Two different techniques by which the differentially drive robot may approximate the velocity of a holonomic robot are derived and evaluated. They are then combined in order to allow the robot to select the best method based on the robot’s current state. The second extension to the basic VOS algorithm is designed to explicitly account for the <b>actuation</b> <b>error</b> experienced in typical robotic vehicles. The velocity obstacles are augmented to account for both the error in the robot’s current position as well as the velocity error that will occur while the robot attempts to follow the command velocity so that these sources of error does not cause a collision. Numerous simulation trials have been used to validate the original VOS concept as well as the two extensions. Experimental trials, with a typical, differentially driven robotic vehicle with <b>actuation</b> <b>error,</b> have demonstrated the success of VOS under real world conditions...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, {{calibration}} techniques {{have been widely}} used to improve the accuracy of robots and machine tools since they only involve software modification instead of changing the design and manufacture of the hardware. Traditionally, there are four steps are required for a calibration, i. e. error modeling, measurement, parameter identification and compensation. The objective of this thesis is to propose a method for the kinematics analysis and error modeling of a newly developed hybrid redundant robot IWR (Intersector Welding Robot), which possesses ten degrees of freedom (DOF) where 6 -DOF in parallel and additional 4 -DOF in serial. In this article, the problem of kinematics modeling and error modeling of the proposed IWR robot are discussed. Based on the vector arithmetic method, the kinematics model and the sensitivity model of the end-effector subject to the structure parameters is derived and analyzed.

40|$|As {{a general}} and thus popular model for {{autonomous}} systems, partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) can capture uncertainties from different sources like sensing noises, <b>actuation</b> <b>errors,</b> and uncertain environments. However, its comprehensiveness makes {{the planning and}} control in POMDP difficult. Traditional POMDP planning problems target to find the optimal policy to maximize the expectation of accumulated rewards. But for safety critical applications, guarantees of system performance described by formal specifications are desired, which motivates us to consider formal methods to synthesize supervisor for POMDP. With system specifications given by Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL), we propose a supervisory control framework with a type of deterministic finite automata (DFA), za-DFA, as the controller form. While the existing work mainly relies on optimization techniques to learn fixed-size finite state controllers (FSCs), we develop an $L^*$ learning based algorithm to determine both space and transitions of za-DFA. Membership queries and different oracles for conjectures are defined. The learning algorithm is sound and complete.

40|$|Many {{tasks in}} robot-assisted surgery, food handling, manufacturing, and other {{applications}} require planning and controlling {{the motions of}} manipulators or other devices that must interact with highly deformable objects. We present a unified approach for motion planning under uncertainty in deformable environments that maximizes probability of success by accounting for uncertainty in deformation models, noisy sensing, and unpredictable actuation. Unlike prior planners that assume deterministic deformations or treat deformations {{as a type of}} small perturbation, our method explicitly considers the uncertainty in large, time-dependent deformations. Our method requires a simulator of deformable objects but places no significant restrictions on the simulator used. We use a samplingbased motion planner in conjunction with the simulator to generate a set of candidate plans based on expected deformations. Our method then uses the simulator and optimal control to numerically estimate time-dependent state distributions based on uncertain parameters (e. g. deformable material properties or <b>actuation</b> <b>errors).</b> We then select the plan with the highest estimated probability of successfully avoiding obstacles and reaching the goal region. Using FEM-based simulation of deformable tissues, we demonstrate the ability of our method to generate high quality plans in two medical-inspired scenarios: (1) guiding bevel-tip steerable needles through slices of deformable tissue around obstacles for minimally invasive biopsies and drug-delivery, and (2) manipulating planar tissues to align interior points at desired coordinates for precision treatment...|$|R
40|$|A {{document}} {{describes a}} multi-field wavefront control (WFC) procedure for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) on-orbit optical telescope element (OTE) fine-phasing using wavefront measurements at the NIRCam pupil. The control {{is applied to}} JWST primary mirror (PM) segments and secondary mirror (SM) simultaneously with a carefully selected ordering. Through computer simulations, the multi-field WFC procedure shows that it can reduce the initial system wavefront error (WFE), as caused by random initial system misalignments within the JWST fine-phasing error budget, from a few dozen micrometers to below 50 nm across the entire NIRCam Field of View, and the WFC procedure is also computationally stable as the Monte-Carlo simulations indicate. With the incorporation of a Kalman Filter (KF) as an optical state estimator into the WFC process, the robustness of the JWST OTE alignment process can be further improved. In the presence of some large optical misalignments, the Kalman state estimator can provide a reasonable estimate of the optical state, especially for those degrees of freedom that {{have a significant impact}} on the system WFE. The state estimate allows for a few corrections to the optical state to push the system towards its nominal state, and the result is that a large part of the WFE can be eliminated in this step. When the multi-field WFC procedure is applied after Kalman state estimate and correction, the stability of fine-phasing control is much more certain. Kalman Filter has been successfully applied to diverse applications as a robust and optimal state estimator. In the context of space-based optical system alignment based on wavefront measurements, a KF state estimator can combine all available wavefront measurements, past and present, as well as measurement and <b>actuation</b> <b>error</b> statistics to generate a Maximum-Likelihood optimal state estimator. The strength and flexibility of the KF algorithm make it attractive for use in real-time optical system alignment when WFC alone cannot effectively align the system...|$|E
40|$|Adverse events due {{to medical}} errors are a {{leading cause of}} death in the United States {{exceeding}} the mortality rates of motor vehicle accidents, breast cancer and AIDS. Improvements can and should be made to reduce the rates of preventable surgical errors since they account for nearly half of all adverse events within hospitals. Although minimally invasive surgery has proven patient benefits such as reduced postoperative pain and hospital stay, its operative environment imposes substantial physical and cognitive strain on the surgeon increasing the risk of error. In order to mitigate errors and protect patients, a multidisciplinary approach was taken to improve minimally invasive surgery. Clinical, human factors, and biomedical engineering principles and methodologies were used to develop and assess laparoscopic surgery instrumentation, practices and procedures. First, the foundational understanding and the imperative to transform health care into a high quality and safe system is discussed. Next, a generalized perspective is presented on the impact of the design and redesign of surgical technologies and processes on human performance. The remainder of this dissertation presents the experimental results of four studies used to develop and assess laparoscopic surgery instrumentation, practices and procedures. In the first experiment, a novel hand-controlled electrosurgical laparoscopic grasper was developed and evaluated to eliminate the use of foot pedals, reduce surgery-related discomfort, and minimize the risk of <b>actuation</b> <b>errors.</b> The final three studies compared the emerging technique of single-incision surgery to conventional laparoscopic surgery to determine whether there were any technical, physical or subjective performance differences across the two surgical techniques. In all, these studies contribute towards the improvement of the quality and safety of minimally invasive surgery. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of domestic mobile manipulators for unconstrained environments has driven significant research recently. Robot Care Systems has been pioneering {{in developing a}} prototype of a mobile manipulator for elderly care. It has a {{6 degrees of freedom}} robotic arm mounted on their flagship robot LEA, a non-holonomic differential drive platform. In order to utilize the navigation and manipulation capabilities of such mobile manipulators, robot placement algorithm that computes a favorable position and orientation of the mobile base is sought, which enables the end effector to reach a desired target. None of the existing approaches perform robot placement while ensuring a high chance of successful planning to target through a short path, while accounting for sensing and <b>actuation</b> <b>errors</b> typical in real world scenarios. This thesis presents a novel robot placement algorithm DeCOWA (Determining Commutation configuration using Optimization and Workspace Analysis) with these characteristics. Since the approach to robot placement is dependent upon the kind of mobile manipulation, a comparative study of sequential and full body methods is performed with respect to criteria important in domestic settings. Sequential mobile manipulation is found to be most suitable, for which a modular mobile manipulation framework encompassing motion planning and robot placement is presented. With sequential mobile manipulation, the ability to successfully reach a target depends upon the kinematic capabilities of the arm. Accordingly, robot placement with DeCOWA determines a favorable location for the arm, and corresponding platform orientation. To find the position of arm’s base, an offline manipulator workspace analysis is performed generating the Inverse Reachability and Planability maps. During online use, these maps are combined into an Inverse Fusion Map that ranks different locations based on the ability of the arm placed there to find a successful and short motion plan to target. This map is filtered to generate a set of feasible locations at the arm’s height. Through a ranked iterative search, a suitable collision free arm location is determined followed by minimization of the platform distance from robot’s current pose. This approach is evaluated against an unbiased random placement of robot near the target using a sample set of twenty scenes mimicking domestic settings. It is found that DeCOWA is able to generate commutation configurations in fraction of a second, that lead to a high planning success rate, a short path length, and account for goal tolerance of navigation. Also, its modularity allows to use several planability metrics, making it useful for domestic application. Biomechanical Design - BioRobotic...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Introduced in {{this paper}} is an {{innovative}} drive for wheeled mobile robots, {{that is based on}} two identical, coaxial wheels, independently driven by two identical motors. The common axis is capable of rotating about a vertical axis. The drive, termed Dual-Wheel Transmission (DWT), is composed of two identical epicyclic gear trains, lying at two different levels and coupled by a common planet-carrier. The latter can turn freely with respect to the robot platform carrying the motors, the transmission having, as a stand-alone unit, three degrees of freedom and only two motors, which makes it underactuated. Upon coupling this drive with two other wheel units, which is the minimum required for static support, a robot with mobility of three is produced, the underactuation thereby disappearing. Finally, the dimensioning of the DWT is reported for robustness against manufacturing, <b>actuation</b> and sensing <b>errors.</b> Index Terms — Epicyclic gear trains, dual-wheel transmission, wheeled mobile robots.

40|$|A {{pneumatic}} muscle actuator (PMA) is {{a device}} that mimics behavior of skeletal muscle by contracting and generating force in a nonlinear manner when activated. PMAs have a high {{power to weight ratio}} and possess unique characteristics which make them ideal for human interaction. Due to their nonlinear dynamics, PMAs are difficult to control, presenting challenges in system implementation. Despite these challenges, PMAs have great potential as a source of resistance for strength training and rehabilitation. The main goal of this work was to control a PMA for use in isokinetic exercise, potentially benefiting anyone in need of optimal strength training through a joint 2 ̆ 7 s range of motion. This includes astronauts who need to counteract muscle atrophy and bone loss during prolonged spaceflight. The lightweight PMA driven by pressurized air does not need gravity to produce resistance, making it an attractive option for a microgravity exercise device. The control system developed is based on an inverse three-element phenomenological model and adaptive nonlinear control. The system operates as a type of haptic controller, automatically adjusting resistance to assist a simulated neuromuscular actuator in maintaining the desired velocity. A human quadriceps dynamic simulator (HQDS) was developed so that control effectiveness and accommodation could be tested prior to human implementation. A motor, which produces torque analogous to quadriceps 2 ̆ 7 torque production about the knee, is used in conjunction with the HQDS to simulate neuromuscular <b>actuation.</b> Tracking <b>error</b> results for motor shaft position (simulated joint angle), velocity (simulated lower leg angular velocity), and PMA displacement indicate that the control system is effective at producing PMA displacement and resistance necessary for a scaled, simulated neuromuscular actuator to maintain low-velocity isokinetic movement during simulated concentric and eccentric knee extension.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the design of}} blood glucose control during the postprandial period for Type 1 diabetes patients. An artificial pancreas for ambulatory purposes {{has to deal with}} the delays inherent to the subcutaneous route, the carbohydrate intakes, the metabolic changes, the glucose sensor errors and noise, and the insulin pump constraints. A time response typically obtained in closed-loop insulin delivery shows hyperglycemia in the early postprandial period caused by the lag in the insulin absorbtion, followed by hypoglycemia caused by control over-reaction. A hybrid control system is proposed in this paper to overcome these problems. An insulin bolus is administered prior to the meals like in open-loop control, whereas a PD controller is used for robust glucose regulation. The controller gain is progressively increased after the bolus from zero up to its nominal value as function of the insulin on board, so that the PD controller becomes fully operational just when the insulin on board falls below a prescribed value. An excessive accumulation of active insulin is avoided in this way, drastically reducing the risk of hypoglycemia. The controller gain is adapted by means of a variable structure algorithm, allowing a very simple software implementation. The robust performance of the control algorithm is intensively assessed in silico on a cohort of virtual patients under challenging realistic scenarios considering mixed meals, circadian variations, time-varying uncertainties, discrete measurement and <b>actuation,</b> sensor <b>errors</b> and other disturbancesResearch in this area is partially supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation through grant DPI 2010 - 20764 -C 02, the Government of Catalonia trough grant SGR 00523, and the Argentinean Government (ANPCyT PICT- 2011 - 0888, CONICET PIP 112 - 2011 - 00361 and UNLP I 164).
