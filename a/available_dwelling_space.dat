40|$|The {{relationship}} between housing characteristics and residential property price is complex to illustrate. To {{have a better}} understanding of the housing-price structure, structural or spatial submarkets have been introduced in previous studies. However, there is no consensus on the importance of neighborhood effect among them. With regard to this issue, this study specifically focuses on the differences in structural, geographical, and demographical effects between housing submarkets (as categorized by <b>dwelling</b> <b>space).</b> Market subdivisions are relative to consumer behaviors. The heterogeneity of spatial effects in different submarkets gives an explanation as to why the impact of nonneighborhood housing factors in those submarket models is similar, regardless of whether the neighborhood effect is included or not. It also indicates that only some, but not all, of the potential purchasers would make decisions with reference to transaction records of flats in the surrounding areas, only when the flat they want to buy is within a specific range in size. Other critical characteristics such as building age, <b>dwelling</b> <b>space,</b> location choice, and commuting time (to central business district) show remarkably different effects on housing price in those submarkets. Segmentation of housing market by <b>dwelling</b> <b>space</b> (and the average price per square feet is higher when the flats are larger) helps to obtain a better understanding of the importance of <b>dwelling</b> <b>space</b> in housing valuations and in urban housing planning.

50|$|A {{house is}} a {{building}} that functions as a home, ranging from simple dwellings such as rudimentary huts of nomadic tribes and the improvised shacks in shantytowns to complex, fixed structures of wood, brick, concrete or other materials containing plumbing, ventilation and electrical systems. Houses use a range of different roofing systems to keep precipitation such as rain from getting into the <b>dwelling</b> <b>space.</b> Houses may have doors or locks to secure the <b>dwelling</b> <b>space</b> and protect its inhabitants and contents from burglars or other trespassers. Most conventional modern houses in Western cultures will contain one or more bedrooms and bathrooms, a kitchen or cooking area, and a living room. A house may have a separate dining room, or the eating area may be integrated into another room. Some large houses in North America have a recreation room. In traditional agriculture-oriented societies, domestic animals such as chickens or larger livestock (like cattle) may share {{part of the house}} with humans.

40|$|Narrative {{inductive}} {{accounts of}} my teaching practices create a compelling medium for exposing and challenging silences in education, while seeking and reinforcing enduring ideals. By stressing active perception, reflection, creative experimentation and invention in multiple mediums (e. g., literary, visual arts and performing arts) within my classroom, students and I experience challenge and hope. As we strive for meaning, the classroom discourse gains texture rich with honesty, pursuit, imaginative leaps, failures and tough ethical questions revealing our shared humanity and fostering agency for learning. The singular and collective stories of teaching that unfold provide {{direction for the}} field of education because within them the reader is able to closely observe and interrogate existing practices while better discerning the possible. ^ Poetic <b>dwelling</b> <b>spaces</b> emerge, opening up content rather than pinning it down definitively. Alongside my students we suspend preoccupations with outcomes and linger in ideas.

We privilege artistry, science and humanity as arteries comprising the bloodstream of good teaching and learning.

40|$|Residential {{crowding}} {{is frequently}} associated with impoverished {{segments of the}} population, often living in distressed neighbourhoods, and with detrimental consequences for crowded households. The aim of this thesis is to apply a sociological and historical perspective on residential crowding by analyzing Swedish governmental texts and quantitative survey data. Politically defined welfare standards, {{as well as the}} subjective experience of crowding are analyzed and interpreted through sociological welfare and governmentality theory. The arguments justifying the official governmental standards on residential crowding – first formulated in the mid- 1930 s – are explored in a discourse analysis. The analysis shows that there is a strong link between what is regarded to be appropriate <b>dwelling</b> <b>space</b> and what is regarded to be morally good housing conditions. In the 1930 s and 1940 s experts’ decided on what was adequate <b>dwelling</b> <b>space,</b> however in the mid- 1980 s experts’ ability to decide on <b>dwelling</b> <b>space</b> was highly questioned. Instead it became an individual responsibility to decide on how to reside. Hence, what constitutes morally good and morally bad dwelling conditions is debated and dispersed on many actors. Two parallel discourses on crowding, a ”gentrified” and a “distressed” are further explored by analyzing the data from a survey study. Subjective as well as objective elements are analyzed by relating socio-economic profiles of the crowded residents in a distressed and a gentrified neighbourhood. Despite income differences within the crowded population, depending on what neighbourhood you live in, the crowded residents in all neighbourhoods experience less freedom regarding their dwelling situation than do non-crowded residents. The least amount of freedom is experienced by those who are crowded both according to the Swedish housing standard and according to a subjective measure of crowding...|$|R
