25|$|As in Perl 5, {{the formal}} {{parameters}} (i.e., the {{variables in the}} parameter list) are aliases to the <b>actual</b> <b>parameters</b> (the values passed in), but by default, the aliases are constant so they cannot be modified. They may be declared explicitly as read-write aliases for the original value or as copies using the is rw or is copy directives should the programmer require them to be modified locally.|$|E
2500|$|A {{prediction}} interval instead gives an interval {{in which one}} expects y'd to fall; this is not necessary if the <b>actual</b> <b>parameters</b> α and β are known (together with the error term εi), but if one is estimating from a sample, then one may use the standard error of the estimates for the intercept and slope ( [...] and [...] ), {{as well as their}} correlation, to compute a {{prediction interval}}.|$|E

5000|$|Locate {{the name}} and start {{building}} the parameter list for the name, filling in the formal parameter names. Also receive any <b>actual</b> <b>parameter</b> list {{from the body of}} the expression, and return it as the <b>actual</b> <b>parameter</b> list from this expression ...|$|R
50|$|In {{this example}} the <b>actual</b> <b>{{parameter}}</b> for the formal parameter o is always p. As p {{is a free}} variable in the whole expression, the parameter may be dropped. The <b>actual</b> <b>parameter</b> for the formal parameter y is always n. However n is bound in a lambda abstraction. So this parameter may not be dropped.|$|R
2500|$|... two {{different}} types, namely the function's formal and <b>actual</b> <b>parameter</b> type have ...|$|R
5000|$|If all the <b>actual</b> <b>parameters</b> {{have the}} same value, and all the free {{variables}} of that value are available for definition of the function then drop the parameter, and replace the old parameter with its value.|$|E
50|$|To {{instantiate}} {{a generic}} unit, the programmer passes <b>actual</b> <b>parameters</b> for each formal. The generic instance then behaves {{just like any}} other unit. It is possible to instantiate generic units at run-time, for example inside a loop.|$|E
5000|$|The {{parameters}} {{can be used}} by {{the drawing}} functions, and also by the production rules. The production rules can use the parameters in two ways: first, in a conditional statement determining whether the rule will apply, and second, the production rule can modify the <b>actual</b> <b>parameters.</b> For example, look at: ...|$|E

5000|$|It is also {{possible}} to have 'constrained' formal parameters, for which the <b>actual</b> <b>parameter</b> must inherit from a given class, the [...] "constraint". For example in ...|$|R
50|$|Dynamic {{dispatch}} {{contrasts with}} static dispatch, {{in which the}} implementation of a polymorphic operation is selected at compile-time. The purpose of dynamic dispatch is to support cases where the appropriate implementation of a polymorphic operation cannot be determined at compile time because it depends on the runtime type of one or more <b>actual</b> <b>parameters</b> to the operation.|$|E
50|$|A passive {{programmable}} resistance device uses {{a closed}} loop feedback for controlling resistance to rotational or translational motion of an object. One or more <b>actual</b> <b>parameters,</b> such as force or position, are measured and compared with desired parameters. The differences are used to provide a control signal which controls the resistance to {{the movement of the}} object. Patent US 4544154 A, 1985.|$|E
50|$|For each visual type, the {{acceptance}} packet contains both its identifier and the <b>actual</b> <b>parameters</b> it contains (visual class, etc.) The client stores this information, as it cannot request it afterwards. Moreover, clients cannot change or create new visual types. Requests for {{creation of a}} new window include the depth and the identifier of the visual type to use for representing colors of this window.|$|E
50|$|If no {{variable}} {{names are}} {{free in the}} <b>actual</b> <b>parameter</b> and bound in the body, beta reduction may be performed on the lambda abstraction without canonical renaming.|$|R
25|$|In {{computer}} programming, two {{notions of}} parameter are commonly used, and {{are referred to}} as parameters and arguments—or more formally as a formal <b>parameter</b> and an <b>actual</b> <b>parameter.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The naive beta-redex {{changed the}} meaning of the {{expression}} because x and y from the <b>actual</b> <b>parameter</b> became captured when the expressions were substituted in the inner abstractions.|$|R

50|$|Euclid is {{descended from}} the Pascal {{programming}} language. Functions in Euclid are closed scopes, may not have side effects, and must explicitly declare imports. Euclid also disallows gotos, floating point numbers, global assignments, nested functions and aliases, {{and none of the}} <b>actual</b> <b>parameters</b> to a function can refer to the same thing. Euclid implements modules as types. Descendants of Euclid include the Mesa programming language, the Concurrent Euclid programming language and the Turing programming language.|$|E
5000|$|In Central India, There {{is lack of}} Astronomy club due {{to which}} people cannot get access to <b>actual</b> <b>parameters</b> of Amateur astronomy. There is only one vast Semi Governmental {{organisation}} working for the sake and promotion of Astronomy and Astrophysics. Named [...] "Sky trackers and Astronomy researchers club" [...] in Bhopal (Madhya Pradesh) have been promoting the need of amateur astronomy among all age groups {{in various parts of}} Madhya Pradesh and nearby areas.|$|E
50|$|ALGOL {{introduced}} {{the use of}} block structure and lexical scope. It was also notorious for its difficult call by name default parameter passing mechanism, which was defined so as to require textual substitution of the expression representing the <b>actual</b> <b>parameter</b> {{in place of the}} formal parameter during execution of a procedure or function, causing it to be re-evaluated each time it is referenced during execution. ALGOL implementors developed a mechanism they called a thunk, which captured the context of the <b>actual</b> <b>parameter,</b> enabling it to be evaluated during execution of the procedure or function.|$|R
50|$|The lambda {{abstraction}} operator, λ, takes {{a formal}} parameter variable {{and a body}} expression. When evaluated the formal parameter variable is identified with {{the value of the}} <b>actual</b> <b>parameter.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: MSE (R) {{of least}} squares {{estimator}} (ML) vs. James-Stein estimator (JS). The James-Stein estimator gives its best estimate when {{the norm of}} the <b>actual</b> <b>parameter</b> vector θ is near zero.|$|R
5000|$|Notice {{that the}} formal {{parameters}} {{listed in the}} argument list to the [...] command are simply the defined names for statically allocated global variables. The semantics of parameter passing was given as being equivalent to assignment {{at the time of}} the control transfer to the destination unit, and if <b>actual</b> <b>parameters</b> were omitted, as in the second [...] command above, the effect was to leave the prior values of the corresponding formal parameters unchanged.|$|E
50|$|A real FDA {{can only}} {{approximate}} this ideal, and the <b>actual</b> <b>parameters</b> {{are subject to}} drift over time and with changes in temperature, input conditions, etc. Modern integrated FET or MOSFET FDAs approximate more closely to these ideals than bipolar ICs where large signals must be handled at room temperature over a limited bandwidth; input impedance, in particular, is much higher, although the bipolar FDA usually exhibit superior (i.e., lower) input offset drift and noise characteristics.|$|E
5000|$|Instances (or [...] "dictionaries") in Scala type {{classes are}} just {{ordinary}} {{values in the}} language, rather than a completely separate kind of entity. While these instances are by default supplied by finding appropriate instances in scope {{to be used as}} the implicit <b>actual</b> <b>parameters</b> for explicitly-declared implicit formal parameters, {{the fact that they are}} ordinary values means that they can be supplied explicitly, to resolve ambiguity. As a result, Scala type classes do not satisfy the coherence property and are effectively a syntactic sugar for implicit parameters.|$|E
50|$|Beta-reduction {{captures the}} idea of {{function}} application (also called a function call), and implements the substitution of the <b>actual</b> <b>parameter</b> expression for the formal parameter variable. Beta-reduction is {{defined in terms of}} substitution.|$|R
5000|$|The alpha {{renaming}} {{removed the}} problem by changing the names of x and y in the inner abstraction {{so that they are}} distinct from the names of x and y in the <b>actual</b> <b>parameter.</b>|$|R

Existing short-baseline experiments measure the first small dip in the black curve at 500 km/GeV; JUNO will observe the large dip at 16000 km/GeV. For reactor neutrinos with an energy of ≈3 MeV, the distances are ≈1.5 km and ≈50 km, respectively. This plot is based on assumed mixing parameters; the measured shape will differ and allow the <b>actual</b> <b>parameters</b> to be computed.|$|E
5000|$|Correlation effects: Taking the {{collision}} terms into account explicitly requires a large numerical effort, {{but can be}} done with state-of-the-art computers. Technically speaking, {{the collision}} terms in the semiconductor Bloch equations are included in second-Born approximation. This microscopic model has the advantage of having predictive character, i.e., it yields the correct linewidth for any temperature or excitation density. In the other models, the relaxation time has to be extracted from experiment, but depends on the <b>actual</b> <b>parameters</b> meaning the experiment has to be redone for any temperature and excitation intensity.|$|E
5000|$|Perl 6 {{introduces}} true formal parameters to the language. In Perl 6, a subroutine declaration {{looks like}} this: sub do_something(Str $thing, Int $other) { [...] [...] [...] }As in Perl 5, the formal parameters (i.e., the {{variables in the}} parameter list) are aliases to the <b>actual</b> <b>parameters</b> (the values passed in), but by default, the aliases are constant so they cannot be modified.

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the bind-class , ECL has bind-classes , , , and [...] Bind-class [...] indicates that a parameter is to be passed by reference. Bind-class [...] causes a parameter to be passed by reference if possible and by value if not (e.g., if the <b>actual</b> <b>parameter</b> is a pure value, or a variable to which a type conversion must be applied). Bind-class [...] specifies that an abstract syntax tree for the <b>actual</b> <b>parameter</b> is to be passed to the formal parameter; this provides extraordinary flexibility for programmers to invent their own notations, with their own evaluation semantics, for certain procedure parameters. Bind-class [...] is similar to , but provides a capability {{similar to that of}} varargs in C: the [...] bind-class can only appear in the last formal parameter of the procedure, and that formal parameter is bound to a list of abstract syntax tree representations, one for each remaining <b>actual</b> <b>parameter.</b> ECL has an [...] built-in function for evaluating an abstract syntax tree; alternatively, there are functions by which programmers can explore the nodes of the abstract syntax tree and process them according to their own logic.|$|R
30|$|In this work, the <b>actual</b> <b>parameter</b> {{learning}} is {{performed with the}} widely used least squares (LS) estimation. For brevity, the parameter learning and digital cancellation procedure is here outlined only for the ith receiver, since the procedure is identical for all the receivers.|$|R
5000|$|For {{the list}} class shown above, an <b>actual</b> generic <b>parameter</b> substituting for [...] {{can be any}} other {{available}} class. To constrain the set of classes from which valid <b>actual</b> generic <b>parameters</b> can be chosen, a generic constraint can be specified. In the declaration of class [...] below, the generic constraint dictates that any valid <b>actual</b> generic <b>parameter</b> will be a class that inherits from class [...] The generic constraint ensures that elements of a [...] can in fact be sorted.|$|R
