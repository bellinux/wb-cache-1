50|$|I {{have always}} {{believed}} {{the law to}} be this, that when an offer is made to another party, and in that offer there is a request express or implied that he must signify his acceptance by doing some particular thing, then {{as soon as he}} does that thing, he is bound. If a man sent an offer abroad saying: I wish to know whether you will supply me with goods at such and such a price, and, if you agree to that, you must ship the first cargo {{as soon as you get}} this letter, there can be no doubt that as soon as the cargo was shipped the contract would be complete, and if the cargo went to the bottom of the sea, it would go to the bottom of the sea at the risk of the orderer. So again, where, as in the case of Ex parte Harris, a person writes a letter and says, I offer to take an <b>allotment</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares,</b> and he expressly or impliedly says, If you agree with me send an answer by the post, there, as soon as he has sent that answer by the post, and put it out of his control, and done an extraneous act which clenches the matter, and shews beyond all doubt that each side is bound, I agree the contract is perfectly plain and clear.But when you come to the general proposition which Mr. Justice Brett seems to have laid down, that a simple acceptance in your own mind, without any intimation to the other party, and expressed by a mere private act, such as putting a letter into a drawer, completes a contract, I must say I differ from that. It appears from the Year Books that as long ago as the time of Edward IV, Chief Justice Brian decided this very point. The plea of the Defendant in that case justified the seizing of some growing crops because he said the Plaintiff had offered him to go and look at them, and if he liked them, and would give 2s. 6d. for them, he might take them; that was the justification. That case is referred to in a book which I published a good many years ago, Blackburn on Contracts of Sale, and is there translated. Brian gives a very elaborate judgment, explaining the law of the unpaid vendor's lien, as early as that time, exactly as the law now stands, and he consequently says: “This plea is clearly bad, as you have not shewn the payment or the tender of the money;” but he goes farther, and says (I am quoting from memory, but I think I am quoting correctly), moreover, your plea is utterly naught, for it does not shew that when you had made up your mind to take them you signified it to the Plaintiff, and your having it in your own mind is nothing, for it is trite law that the thought of man is not triable, for even the devil does not know what the thought of man is; but I grant you this, that if in his offer to you he had said, Go and look at them, and if you are pleased with them signify it to such and such a man, and if you had signified it to such and such a man, your plea would have been good, because that was a matter of fact.I take it, my Lords, that that, which was said 300 years ago and more, is the law to this day, and it is quite what Lord Justice Mellish in Ex parte Harris accurately says, that where it is expressly or impliedly stated in the offer that you may accept the offer by posting a letter, the moment you post the letter the offer is accepted. You are bound from the moment you post the letter, not, as it is put here, from the moment you make up your mind on the subject.But my Lords, while, as I say, this is so upon the question of law, it is still necessary to consider this case farther upon the question of fact. I agree, and I think every Judge who has considered the case does agree, certainly Lord Chief Justice Cockburn does, that though the parties may have gone no farther than an offer on the one side, saying, Here is the draft,—(for that I think is really what this case comes to,)—and the draft so offered by the one side is approved by the other, everything being agreed to except the name of the arbitrator, which the one side has filled in and the other has not yet assented to, if both parties have acted upon that draft and treated it as binding, they will be bound by it. When they had come so near as I have said, still it remained to execute formal agreements, and the parties evidently contemplated that they were to exchange agreements, so that each side should be perfectly safe and secure, knowing that the other side was bound. But, although that was what each party contemplated, still I agree (I think the Lord Chief Justice Cockburn states it clearly enough), that if a draft having been prepared and agreed upon as the basis of a deed or contract to be executed between two parties, the parties, without waiting for the execution of the more formal instrument, proceed to act upon the draft, and treat it as binding upon them, both parties will be bound by it. But it must be clear that the parties have both waived the execution of the formal instrument and have agreed expressly, or as shewn by their conduct, to act on the informal one. I think that is quite right, and I agree with the way in which Mr. Herschell in his argument stated it, very truly and fairly. If the parties have by their conduct said, that they act upon the draft which has been approved of by Mr. Brogden, and which if not quite approved of by the railway company, has been exceedingly near it, if they indicate by their conduct that they accept it, the contract is binding.|$|E

Halberstam himself had no sons. A leadership dispute then arose between Unger and Ben Zion Aryeh Leibish Halberstam, brother of the previous Rebbe and son of the Third Bobover Rebbe, Shlomo Halberstam, who both claimed the title of Bobover Rebbe. The dispute was taken to an arbitration panel, known as a Beth Din, which ruled that the faction following Ben Zion Aryeh Leibish Halberstam held the rights to the name [...] "Bobov". Unger was also allowed to use the name Bobov, so long as a distinguishing identifier would be added to it. The qualifying suffix [...] "-45" [...] was henceforth adopted in tribute to the name of the street on which the community center of the sect was located at the time. In addition, the Beth din ordered Bobov to pay $6,200,000 to Bobov-45's Rebbe and Rav in 25 quarterly installments as an <b>allotment</b> <b>of</b> their faction's <b>share</b> <b>of</b> the inheritance of the larger Bobov enterprise's assets, valued at the time at over $100,000,000.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} different IPO mechanisms {{on the structure of}} share ownership and explores the role of underpricing and rationing in determining investors’ shareholdings. We focus on the agency problem that results when large institutions are the only investors capable of monitoring the firm whereas small shareholders free-ride on these activities. The major conclusion is that some well-known aspects of IPOs may be explained as rational responses by the issuer to the existence of regulatory constraints in public capital markets. There is a two-stage offering mechanism in which the investment banker, acting {{in the interests of the}} issuer, optimally rations the <b>allotment</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> to small investors in order to capture the benefits associated with better monitoring by institutions. Importantly, in our model, the existence of underpricing (and oversubscription) is an indication that the issuer has received a higher ex ante price than would have been obtained through a competitive Walrasian-type offering process. � 1998 Elsevier Science S.

Compared with {{developed}} capital markets, Korean IPO {{markets are}} operating under relatively stronger financial regulations of public authorities. Policy-makers have {{the incentive to}} set the IPO offer price lower, so that the stock price after listing remains higher than the offer price. We have examined the negative effect of IPO underpricing by examining the stock price behavior <b>of</b> IPO <b>shares</b> after listing. If excessive underpricing <b>of</b> an IPO <b>share</b> offers investors the opportunity of realizing short-term gains, then it {{would serve as a}} mechanism for preventing from maintaining a stable share price after listing. The main results of this study are as follows. First, around 48 % of IPO firms have their share prices below their offer prices in a month after listing, even though their average initial return is 33 %. Second, the <b>allotment</b> ratio <b>of</b> IPO <b>shares</b> does not have any relationship with the share price in a month: it has the strong relationship only with the initial return. Third, the high volatility <b>of</b> IPO <b>shares</b> is mainly due to the price fluctuation in the initial trading. Fourth, firms wth excessive initial returns are more likely to suffer from price declines in a month after listing. Theses findings support the view that the excessive underpricing <b>of</b> IPO <b>shares</b> can work as a mechanism for preventing from maintaining a stable share price after listing. ? ??? ????? ????? ???? ?????(HY- 2014 -G) ...|$|R
