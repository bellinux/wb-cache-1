40|$|The package {{structure}} critically {{influences the}} major characteristics of semiconductor lasers, such as thermal behavior, output power, wavelength, and far-field distribution. In this paper, a new single emitter package structure called F-mount is designed and {{compared with the}} conventional package structure C-mount. The influence of package structure on their performances is characterized and analyzed. The thermal resistances of lasers with different package structures are calculated through simulation, and are contrasted with experimental results. Some devices are also tested for the maximum output power level. Under the continuous wave (CW) condition, the maximum power of F-mount reaches 12. 6 W at 808 nm while the output power only reaches 10. 9 W for C-mount. Under the condition of 0. 5 % duty cycle (100 mu s, 50 Hz), the catastrophic optical mirror damage level reaches 58. 7 W at 74 A for F-mount, and 54. 8 W at 57 A for C-mount are reported for the first time. It is experimentally found {{that there is an}} obvious wavelength difference between the two type structure lasers: about 1. 37 nm in CW mode and 2. 89 nm in quasi CW mode. Theoretical analysis shows that red-shift and blue-shift is a result of external strain in the package process of F-mount and C-mount, respectively. It is also found that the package structure has an effect on the divergence <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>slow</b> axis far fields, but little impact on that of fast axis far fields. The analysis shows that package structure has a strong influence on the performance of the laser; therefore, the package should be optimized to achieve better performance for some special applications...|$|R

40|$|Significant {{yawing moment}} asymmetries were {{encountered}} during the high-angle-of-attack envelope {{expansion of the}} two X- 31 aircraft. These asymmetries led to position saturations of the thrust vector vanes and trailing-edge flaps during some of the dynamic stability axis rolling maneuvers at high <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> attack. This <b>slowed</b> the high-angle-of-attack envelope expansion and resulted in maneuver restrictions. Several aerodynamic modifications {{were made to the}} X- 31 forebody with the goal of minimizing the asymmetry. A method for determining the yawing moment asymmetry from flight data was developed and an analysis of the various configuration changes completed. The baseline aircraft were found to have significant asymmetries above 45 deg <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack with the largest asymmetry typically occurring around 60 deg <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack. Applying symmetrical boundary layer transition strips along the forebody sides increased the magnitude of the asymmetry and widened the angle-of-attack range over which the largest asymmetry acted. Installing longitudinal forebody strakes and rounding the sharp nose of the aircraft caused the yawing moment asymmetry magnitude to be reduced. The transition strips and strakes made the asymmetry characteristic of the aircraft more repeatable than the clean forebody configuration.

40|$|Airplanes and {{helicopters}} use high aspect ratio wings {{to reduce the}} power required to fly, but must operate at low <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack to prevent flow separation and stall. Animals capable <b>of</b> <b>slow</b> sustained flight, such as hummingbirds, have low aspect ratio wings and flap their wings at high <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack without stalling. Instead, they generate an attached vortex along {{the leading edge of}} the wing that elevates lift. Previous studies have demonstrated that this vortex and high lift can be reproduced by revolving the animal wing at the same <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack. How do flapping and revolving animal wings delay stall and reduce power? It has been hypothesized that stall delay derives from having a short radial distance between the shoulder joint and wing tip, measured in chord lengths. This non-dimensional measure of wing length represents the relative magnitude of inertial forces versus rotational accelerations operating in the boundary layer of revolving and flapping wings. Here we show for a suite of aspect ratios, which represent both animal and aircraft wings, that the attachment of the leading edge vortex on a revolving wing is determined by wing aspect ratio, defined with respect to the centre of revolution. At high <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack, the vortex remains attached when the local radius is shorter than four chord lengths and separates outboard on higher aspect ratio wings. This radial stall limit explains why revolving high aspect ratio wings (of helicopters) require less power compared with low aspect ratio wings (of hummingbirds) at low <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack and vice versa at high <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack...|$|R

In each case the design is based on a linearization of the lateral-directional dynamics about a high <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack condition.
