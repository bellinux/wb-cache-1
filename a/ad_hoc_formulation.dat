She also proves convergence and consensus using an updating rule which stipulates that the weight put by an agent on another one’s beliefs in each period is inversely related to the distance between their beliefs in the previous period. However, she adopts a rather <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>formulation</b> concerning the diagonal elements of the interaction matrix, according to which the level of trust placed by an agent on herself is not based on distances but only indirectly changes over time due to a normalization term ensuring the row-stochasticity. This formulation implies that each agent puts zero weight on herself and equal weight on other agents in the limit. We treat this result as a paradox {{in the sense that the}} aforementioned limiting behavior of the social interaction matrix T is not in accordance with its gradual updating rule at any time instance t. In particular, each agent neither assigns an equal amount of relative influence to any other agent in the network nor evaluates her own belief as having zero relative importance (T_ij(t) 1 /n- 1, ∀ t and T_ii(t) [...] 0, ∀ t).|$|E

I have made no effort to be comprehensive in my introduction of biological material and the reader interested in a brief account of single cell electro­ physlology from a physically-oriented biologists viewpoint will find the chapters by Woodbury (1965) an excellent introduction. Part I is introductory in nature, exploring the basic electrical properties of inexcitable and excitable cell plasma membranes. Cable theory is utilized to illustrate the function of the non-decrementing action potential as a signaling mechanism for the long range trans­ mission of information in the nervous system, and to gain some in­ sight into the gross behaviour of neurons. The detailed analysis of Hodgkin and Huxley on the squid giant axon membrane ionic conductance properties is reviewed briefly, and some facets of membrane behaviour that have been revealed since the appearance of their work are dis­ cussed. Part II examines the foundations of electrodiffusion theory, and the use of that theory in trying to develop quantitative expla­ nationsof the observed membrane properties of excitable cells, in particular the squid giant axon.

40|$|Entrainment is an {{important}} element of the mixed layer mass, heat, and temperature budgets. Conventional procedures to estimate entrainment heat advection often do not permit the closure of heat and temperature budgets because of inaccuracies in its formulation. In this study a rigorous approach to evaluate the effect of entrainment using the output of a general circulation model (GCM) that does not have an explicit prognostic mixed layer model is described. The integral elements of the evaluation are 1) the rigorous estimates of the temperature difference between mixed layer water and entrained water at each horizontal grid point, 2) the formulation of the temperature difference such that the budget closes over a volume greater than one horizontal grid point, and 3) the apparent warming of the mixed layer during the mixed layer shoaling to account for the weak vertical temperature gradient within the mixed layer. This evaluation of entrainment heat advection is compared with the estimates by other commonly used <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>formulations</b> by applying them in three regions: the north-central Pacific, the Kuroshio Extension, and the Nino- 3 areas in the tropical Pacific.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{comparison}} of several models, proposed in the literature, of softening plasticity with internal variables regularized by nonlocal averaging of integral type. The analyzed models of softening plasticity are divided in two groups. The former complies with models {{based on the principle}} of nonlocal maximum plastic dissipation; the latter is given by models formulated <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> without any recourse to thermodynamic requirements. In general, these models are not easy to compare. Actually, the formulations based on the principle of nonlocal maximum plastic dissipation appears to be quite different in terms of the free energy and of the yield function. On the other side, it is not trivial to check the thermodynamic admissibility of nonlocal models <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> formulated. To highlight the fundamental properties of these models in order to exploit the similarities and the differences between them, a general treatment of softening plasticity with internal variables is preliminarily proposed in the framework supplied by convex analysis and by the generalized standard material. It is shown that this framework provides the suitable tools to perform a theoretical analysis of such nonlocal problems. The proposed nonlocal formulation of softening plasticity combines in a quite general way the effect of local and nonlocal internal variables in the expressions of the free energy and of the elastic domain. As a consequence, several models of softening plasticity based either on thermodynamic considerations or on <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>formulations</b> can be derived from the proposed model.

Kaleidoscope avoids this problem by guiding the user’s query construction actively. Based on a grammar specifying the syntax and semantics of an English-like Query Language (EnQL), the interface generates legitimate query constituents incrementally as menu choices. Additional intraquery guidance ensures the integrity of a partial query. The central theme {{of this paper is}} that to support Kaleidoscope’s style of usersystem interaction, the presence of a high-level data model is critical. The absence of an explicit model leads to <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> grammar design and query translation.

40|$|Statistical {{self-similarity}} {{of random}} processes in continuous-domains is defined through invariance of their statistics to time or spatial scaling. In discrete-time, scaling by an arbitrary factor of signals {{can be accomplished}} through frequency warping, and statistical self-similarity {{is defined by the}} discrete-time continuous-dilation scaling operation. Unlike other self-similarity models mostly relying on characteristics of continuous self-similarity other than scaling, this model provides a way to express discrete-time statistical self-similarity using scaling of discrete-time signals. This dissertation studies the discrete-time self-similarity model based on the new scaling operation, and develops its properties, which reveals relations with other models. Furthermore, it also presents a new self-similarity definition for discrete-time vector processes, and demonstrates synthesis examples for multi-channel network traffic. In two-dimensional spaces, self-similar random fields are of interest in various areas of image processing, since they fit certain types of natural patterns and textures very well. Current treatments of self-similarity in continuous two-dimensional space use a definition that is a direct extension of the 1 -D definition. However, most of current discrete-space two-dimensional approaches do not consider scaling but instead are based on <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>formulations,</b> for example, digitizing continuous random fields such as fractional Brownian motion. The dissertation demonstrates that the current statistical self-similarity definition in continuous-space is restrictive, and provides an alternative, more general definition. It also provides a formalism for discrete-space statistical self-similarity that depends on a new scaling operator for discrete images. Within the new framework, it is possible to synthesize a wider class of discrete-space self-similar random fields...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a review of}} the most {{influential}} approaches to developing beam models that have been proposed over the last few decades. Essentially, primary {{attention has been paid to}} isotropic structures while a few extensions to composites have been given for the sake of completeness. Classical models - Da Vinci, Euler-Bernoulli, and Timoshenko - are described first. All those approaches that are aimed at the improvement of classical theories are then presented by considering the following main techniques: shear correction factors, warping functions, Saint-Venant based solutions and decomposition methods, variational asymptotic methods, the Generalized Beam Theory and the Carrera Unified Formulation (CUF). Special attention has been paid to the latter by carrying out a detailed review of the applications of 1 D CUF and by giving numerical examples of static, dynamic and aeroelastic problems. Deep and thin-walled structures have been considered for aerospace, mechanical and civil engineering applications. Furthermore, a brief overview of two recently introduced methods, namely the mixed axiomatic/asymptotic approach and the component-wise approach, has been provided together with numerical assessments. The review presented in this paper shows that the development of advanced beam models is still extremely appealing, due to the computational efficiency of beams compared to 2 D and 3 D structural models. Although most of the techniques that have recently been developed are focused on a given number of applications, 1 D CUF offers the breakthrough advantage of being able to deal with a vast variety of structural problems with no need for <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>formulations,</b> including problems that can notoriously be dealt with exclusively by means of 2 D or 3 D models, such as complete aircraft wings, civil engineering constructions, as well as multiscale and wave propagation analyses.

An important advantage with such an approach is a direct fracture mechanics assessment e. g. via computed J - integral or CTOD. A recent development in this approach is the notion of two-parameter fracture assessment. This means that the crack tip stress tri-axiality (constraint) is employed in determining the corresponding fracture toughness, giving a much more realistic capacity of cracked structures.

An <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> nondimensional <b>formulation</b> of the governing local bias and orbital motion limited current collection equations allows one to approach the problem with a perturbation technique in which a parameter, epsilon, quantifies the influence of ohmic effects on the final solution. For the case of small ohmic effects an approximate solution is obtained with a third-order expansion. Conversely, the case of dominant ohmic effects is treated based on {{an extension of the}} exact analytical solution available for the particular case of zero load and negligible potential drop at the cathodic end of the tether. After computing the analytical current and potential profile the maximum and average current, the Lorentz force and torque, as well as the optimum load impedance for maximum power generation are obtained. When compared with the exact, numerically-computed solution an accuracy of better than 5 %is achieved for the computation of the average current across the full parameter space. The error with respect to the generated power becomes negligible when the load impedance is set to the optimum value, while it can grow to a maximum of about 30 % for the less relevant case in which the load impedance of the power generation system is badly mismatched. The results, which are valid for a general rectilinear passive electrodynamic tether with constant cross section satisfying orbital motion limited theory and irrespective of the particular orbit configuration, will be of aid in the design and analysis of space missions involving bare electrodynamic tethers...|$|R
