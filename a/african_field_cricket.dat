50|$|Gryllus bimaculatus {{is one of}} many cricket species {{known as}} <b>field</b> <b>crickets.</b> Also known as the <b>African</b> or Mediterranean <b>field</b> <b>cricket</b> or as the two-spotted cricket, it can be {{discriminated}} from other Gryllus species by the two dot-like marks on the base of its wings.|$|R

50|$|Gryllus veletis, {{commonly}} known as the spring <b>field</b> <b>cricket,</b> is abundant throughout eastern North America. G. veletis is a solitary, aggressive, omnivorous, burrow-inhabiting species of <b>field</b> <b>cricket.</b> This species is commonly confused with Gryllus pennsylvanicus (fall <b>field</b> <b>cricket),</b> as they inhabit the same geographical area. However, the two species are easily distinguished through examination of life history, ovipositor and behavioural differences. Predators of G. veletis, and most <b>field</b> <b>crickets,</b> include American toads, wild turkeys, red-tailed hawks, wolf spiders and red-backed salamanders.|$|R
50|$|Unlike House crickets, {{which can}} adapt {{themselves}} to indoor conditions, the <b>field</b> <b>cricket</b> will die by early winter. Consequently, <b>field</b> <b>crickets</b> in temperate regions exhibit diapause.|$|R

50|$|Gryllus assimilis, {{commonly}} known as the Jamaican <b>field</b> <b>cricket,</b> is one of many cricket species known as a <b>field</b> <b>cricket.</b> It is found in the West Indies, southern United States, Mexico and South America.|$|R
50|$|<b>Field</b> <b>crickets</b> eat a {{broad range}} of feeds: seeds, plants, or insects (dead or alive). They are known to feed on {{grasshopper}} eggs, pupae of Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) and Diptera (flies). Occasionally they may rob spiders of their prey. <b>Field</b> <b>crickets</b> also eat grass.|$|R
50|$|The {{chirping}} of {{the more}} common <b>field</b> <b>crickets</b> is not as reliably correlated to temperature—their chirping rate varies depending on other factors such as age and mating success. In many cases, though, the Dolbear's formula is a close enough approximation for <b>field</b> <b>crickets,</b> too.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike house <b>crickets</b> (Acheta domesticus), <b>field</b> <b>crickets</b> are {{not able}} to adapt to a {{residential}} environment due to constraints in their life history traits and consequently, the insect will not live through the winter. Though <b>field</b> <b>crickets</b> are not normally found in home environments, they may invade a home to seek refuge from poor weather, attraction to light, or in search of foodstuffs (i.e. grains, seeds, etc.). Entrance can be gained through small cracks and crevices leading into a building. Once inside, damage to nylon, wool, plastic and leather fabrics may occur. The <b>field</b> <b>cricket</b> does not consume these materials, but [...] "cuts out" [...] a path through which it may pass. The human inhabitant may be aggravated by the <b>field</b> <b>cricket's</b> nocturnal chirping.|$|R

50|$|<b>Field</b> <b>crickets,</b> {{including}} G.veletis, {{are generally}} omnivorous scavengers. Their diet normally consists of plants, both fresh and decaying, other dead insects {{and in some}} cases predation of other <b>field</b> <b>crickets</b> or live insects may occur. An example of <b>field</b> <b>cricket</b> predation is seen in the consumption of fly pupae, which helps reduce the population of flies, often viewed as pests by humans. Consumption of plant matter helps ensure that fallen leaves and other material does not accumulate. Along with other scavengers (i.e. earthworm, beetles, etc.) decomposition of plants into fertile soil helps maintain a balanced ecosystem in forests and fields.|$|R

5000|$|On {{the island}} of Kauai, females of a species of {{parasitoid}} fly, Ormia ochracea, respond to the stridulation mating calls of male <b>field</b> <b>crickets</b> (Teleogryllus oceanicus) by locating the crickets and then laying their lethal larvae on them. In response to this, male <b>field</b> <b>crickets</b> have evolved via a [...] "flatwing" [...] mutation to no longer produce mating songs.|$|R
40|$|Animal {{personality}} can {{be defined}} as a set of physiological and behavioral characteristics that differ between individuals, but are consistent over time and across situations. The evolution of individual differences in behavior that are consistent over time and situations is still not clear. Our understanding of why animals have personality can be improved by investigating the underlying physiological mechanisms of animal behavior. Serotonin is a key monoamine that serves as a physiological modulator of animal behavior. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are a group of chemicals that increase levels of serotonin in the brain. Fluoxetine is one such chemical and is used to treat depression in humans. In the <b>field</b> <b>cricket</b> (Gryllus bimaculatus), increased levels of serotonin have been linked to higher activity and boldness, which are both personality traits. In the current study, the effects of induced serotonin on activity, exploration, boldness and aggression was investigated. My results show that injecting fluoxetine causes substantial changes in behavioral traits used to describe personality in <b>field</b> <b>crickets.</b> This result is opposite to previous studies, as serotonin induced individuals were less active, less explorative, and won less fights, compared to control individuals. This could be due to serotonin existing naturally within the circulatory system of the <b>field</b> <b>cricket,</b> whereas fluoxetine is a manufactured chemical intended for human receptors, or that fluoxetine has a similar effect in modulating personality in <b>field</b> <b>crickets</b> as in humans. Since fluoxetine acts similarly in <b>field</b> <b>crickets</b> as in humans, an increased understanding of the effects of induced serotonin on different behaviors in <b>field</b> <b>crickets</b> could be beneficial for treating psychological illnesses...|$|R
