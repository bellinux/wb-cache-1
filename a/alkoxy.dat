25|$|The <b>alkoxy</b> sulfonium salt is {{deprotonated}} at {{the alpha}} position with triethylamine {{to afford the}} oxidized product. The reaction accommodates {{a wide array of}} functional groups, but allylic and benzylic alcohols are typically transformed into allylic and benzylic chlorides. Its application in synthesis is based on the mild protocol conditions and functional and protecting group compatibility. In the total synthesis of ingenol, Kuwajima and co-workers exploited the Corey-Kim oxidation by selectively oxidizing the less hindered secondary alcohol(scheme 15).|$|E
25|$|Silyl ethers are a {{group of}} {{chemical}} compounds which contain a silicon atom covalently bonded to an <b>alkoxy</b> group. The general structure is R1R2R3Si−O−R4 where R4 is an alkyl group or an aryl group. Silyl ethers are usually used as protecting groups for alcohols in organic synthesis. Since R1R2R3 can be combinations of differing groups which can be varied {{in order to provide}} a number of silyl ethers, this group of chemical compounds provides a wide spectrum of selectivity for protecting group chemistry. Common silyl ethers are: trimethylsilyl (TMS), tert-butyldiphenylsilyl (TBDPS), tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS/TBDMS) and triisopropylsilyl (TIPS). They are particularly useful because they can be installed and removed very selectively under mild conditions.|$|E
25|$|Lithium {{aluminium}} hydride {{is widely}} used in organic chemistry as a reducing agent. It is {{more powerful than the}} related reagent sodium borohydride owing to the weaker Al-H bond compared to the B-H bond. Often as a solution in diethyl ether and followed by an acid workup, it will convert esters, carboxylic acids, acyl chlorides, aldehydes, and ketones into the corresponding alcohols (see: carbonyl reduction). Similarly, it converts amide, nitro, nitrile, imine, oxime, and azide compounds into the amines (see: amide reduction). It reduces quaternary ammonium cations into the corresponding tertiary amines. Reactivity can be tuned by replacing hydride groups by <b>alkoxy</b> groups. Due to its pyrophoric nature, instability, toxicity, low shelf life and handling problems associated with its reactivity, it has been replaced in the last decade, both at the small-industrial scale and for large-scale reductions by the more convenient related reagent sodium bis (2-methoxyethoxy)aluminium hydride, which exhibits similar reactivity but with higher safety, easier handling and better economics.|$|E
25|$|For optimal {{activity}} and selectivity of the coxibs, a 4-methylsulfonylphenyl attached to an unsaturated (usually) five-membered ring with a vicinal lipophilic group is required (rofecoxib). The SO2CH3 {{can be replaced}} by SO2NH2, wherein the lipophilic pocket is occupied by an optionally substituted phenyl ring or a bulky <b>alkoxy</b> substituent (celecoxib). Within the hydrophilic side-pocket of COX-2, the oxygen of the sulfonamide (or sulfone) group interacts with Hist90, Arg513, and Gln192 and forms hydrogen bonds. The substituted phenyl group {{at the top of}} the channel interacts with the side-chains of amino acid residues through hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. Tyr385 makes for some sterical restrictions of this side of the binding site so a small substituent of the phenyl group makes for better binding. Degrees of freedom are also important for the binding. The central ring of the coxibs decides the orientation of the aromatic rings and, therefore, the binding to COX enzyme even though it often has no electrostatic interactions with any of the amino acid residues. The high lipophilicity of the active site does require low polarity of the central scaffold of the coxibs.|$|E
2500|$|In the IUPAC {{nomenclature}} system, ethers {{are named}} using the general formula [...] "alkoxyalkane", for example CH3–CH2–O–CH3 is methoxyethane. If the ether {{is part of}} a more complex molecule, it is described as an <b>alkoxy</b> substituent, so –OCH3 would be considered a [...] "methoxy-" [...] group. The simpler alkyl radical is written in front, so CH3–O–CH2CH3 would be given as methoxy(CH3O)ethane(CH2CH3).|$|E
2500|$|Usually TBS ethers are severed by TBAF, but the {{hindered}} TBS ether above survives {{the reaction}} conditions upon primary TIPS removal (scheme 5). The MEM protecting group was first described by Corey in 1976. This protecting group is similar in reactivity and stability to other <b>alkoxy</b> methyl ethers under acidic conditions. Cleavage of MEM protecting groups is usually accomplished under acidic conditions, but coordination with metal halides greatly enhances lability via assisted cleavage (scheme 6).|$|E
2500|$|In 1953, William von Eggers Doering and Edwin Dorfman elucidated {{the correct}} pathway for the {{reaction}} {{mechanism of the}} Baeyer–Villiger oxidation by using oxygen-18-labelling of benzophenone. The three different mechanisms would each lead to a different distribution of labelled products. The Criegee intermediate {{would lead to a}} product only labelled on the carbonyl oxygen. The product of the Wittig and Pieper intermediate is only labeled on the <b>alkoxy</b> group of the ester. The Baeyer and Villiger intermediate leads to a 1:1 distribution of both of the above products. The outcome of the labelling experiment supported the Criegee intermediate, which is now the generally accepted pathway.|$|E
2500|$|The {{simplest}} of the cyclopentadienyls are ThIII(C5H5)3 and ThIV(C5H5)4: many derivatives are known. The first (which has two forms, one purple and one green) {{is a rare}} example of thorium in the formal +3 oxidation state. In the derivative , a blue paramagnetic compound, the molecular geometry is trigonal planar around the thorium atom, which has a 6d1 configuration instead of the expected 5f1.

Sci. |year=2015 |issue=6 |pages=517–521 |accessdate=16 July 2016 |doi=10.1039/C4SC03033H}} The second is prepared by heating thorium tetrachloride with K(C5H5) under reflux in benzene: the four cyclopentadienyl rings are arranged tetrahedrally around the central thorium atom. The halide derivative [...] can be made similarly by reducing the amount of K(C5H5) used (other univalent metal cyclopentadienyls can also be used), and the chlorine atom may be further replaced by other halogens or by <b>alkoxy,</b> alkyl, aryl, or BH4 groups. Of these, the alkyl and aryl derivatives have been investigated more deeply due to the insight they give regarding the nature of the Th–C σ bond. Of special interest is the dimer 2, where the two thorium atoms are bridged by two cyclopentadienyl rings, similarly to the structure of niobocene.|$|E
50|$|In chemistry, the <b>alkoxy</b> {{group is}} an alkyl (carbon and {{hydrogen}} chain) group singular bonded to oxygen thus: R-O. The range of <b>alkoxy</b> groups is great, the simplest being methoxy (CH3O-). An ethoxy group (CH3CH2O-) {{is found in}} the organic compound ethyl phenyl ether, C6H5OCH2CH3 which is also known as ethoxybenzene.
