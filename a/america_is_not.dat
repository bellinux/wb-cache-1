Nekesa Mumbi Moody from Associated Press deduced [...] "Twenty years after the first MTV Video Music Awards, and not much has changed — Madonna still makes jaws drop and cheeks blush." [...] Brian Hiatt from Entertainment Weekly felt that [...] "The close-up of [...] locking lips with the 21-year-old Spears was an indelible MTV moment — sexy, vaguely transgressive, and as meaningless as it was entertaining." [...] Elysa Gardner from USA Today explained that the performance [...] "offered a poignant reminder of MTV's role in defining a youth culture that {{has become something of a}} tease — winking at convention without offering any fresh alternatives." [...] The MTV producers were skeptical, saying that [...] "It was sensational, but I wonder what the good folk in places like Provo, Utah state, would make of it. Middle <b>America</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> gonna let this one go lightly." [...] When asked about it, Madonna revealed, [...] "I am kissing [...] and passing my energy on to her. Like kind of a mythological fairytale." [...] The performance was listed by Blender magazine as one of the twenty-five sexiest music moments on television history. MTV listed the performance as the number-one opening moment in the history of the MTV Video Music Awards. In Madonna's 2004 Re-Invention World Tour, a remix interlude of [...] "Hollywood" [...] featured a breakdancer, a firedancer, a bellydancer, a tapdancer, and a skateboarder.

'From sunny Italy to the New York ghetto,' read the taglines on Paramount's original one-sheet, contrasting scenes of 'carefree Beppo at home' in the serene canals of Old Italy with the mean streets of New York where 'to live your baby must have Pasteurized milk.' <b>America</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a promised land paved with gold but a Darwinian jungle, where dreams meet dead ends." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to National Party analyst Raul Pineda Alvarado, Zelaya's {{attempt to}} modify {{constitution}} was a [...] "carbon copy" [...] {{of what has}} happened in Venezuela, Ecuador and Nicaragua. US Republican Newt Gingrich wrote in the Washington Examiner that Chavez had used ALBA to create [...] "a tide of incipient dictatorship" [...] flowing out of Venezuela into other countries in Latin America. He noted that Chavez had subverted democracy in Venezuela to ensure his rule will be uncontested for decades, and [...] "one-by-one, each of the members of ALBA have followed Chavez's lead and changed their constitutions to remove limits on the number of terms their presidents can serve." [...] However, the notion of extending term limits in Latin <b>America</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> unique to ALBA countries, as efforts in Colombia have been made towards allowing President Álvaro Uribe to seek re-election.|$|E

[...] Johnson said the U.S. was [...] "cringing in fear" [...] of Muslim terrorists after September 11 attacks and that professors were afraid to discuss it [...] "because they're afraid of what the Muslim students will do. They're afraid it won't keep the peace on campus. I never thought our country would descend to this level. We are afraid to search the truth and to proclaim it. [...] We once knew who the true God was and were able to proclaim it frankly. [...] But since about 1960 we've been hiding from that.

2500|$|Wilson {{ignored the}} protests for six months, but on June20,1917, as a Russian {{delegation}} {{drove up to}} the White House, suffragists unfurled a banner which stated: [...] "We women of America tell you that <b>America</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a democracy. Twentymillion women are denied the right to vote. President Wilson is the chief opponent of their national enfranchisement". Another banner on August14,1917, referred to [...] "Kaiser Wilson" [...] and compared the plight of the German people with that of American women. With this manner of protest, the women were subject to arrests and many were jailed. Another ongoing tactic of the National Woman's Party was watchfires, which involved burning copies of President Wilson's speeches, often outside the White House or in the nearby Lafayette Park. The Party continued to hold watchfires even as the war began, drawing criticism from the public and even other suffrage groups for being unpatriotic. On October17, Alice Paul was sentenced to seven months and on October30 began a hunger strike, but after a few days prison authorities began to force feed her. After years of opposition, Wilson changed his position in 1918 to advocate women's suffrage as a war measure.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2012 column titled [...] "The New Racial Derangement Syndrome", Hanson argued {{again that}} class {{considerations}} now more often trump racial differences, and [...] that racism in modern <b>America</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> confined {{to any one}} particular group, citing various statements by prominent African-Americans such as Morgan Freeman, Samuel L. Jackson, Jamie Foxx, Chris Rock and Rob Parker that he saw as racially chauvinistic and often blatantly anti-white, and thus as signs of a new [...] "racialist derangement" [...] sweeping across black America that had set back considerable progress in making racial considerations prior to 2009 incidental rather than essential to an American citizen's identity. In a 2015 column titled [...] "The Weariness of the Whiners", Hanson illustrated the paradoxes of race and class, by illustrating the talk show hostess Oprah Winfrey claim {{that she was a}} victim of racism when a clerk at the Trois Pommes boutique refused to display a $38,000 handbag to her. In a 2016 column [...] "The New Segregationism", Hanson lamented growing racial polarization, mostly on the part of elites who take refuge in racial chauvinism when their own careerist concerns are unmet. He used as an example of what he sees as the unlikelihood of the claim that there is anti-black racism in modern America in the complaint by the actor Will Smith that he was not nominated for an Oscar.|$|E
