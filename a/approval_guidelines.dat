[...] The Fukui Court issued a similar injunction against the restart of Oi units 3&4 in May, 2014. Former Tokyo high court judge and current Chou Law School Professor Jun Masuda criticized Fukui Judge Hideaki Higuchi, who headed the court panel, “It seems the judge has already had the idea of demanding absolute safety from the beginning.

40|$|The use of decentralised, {{sustainable}} urban {{drainage systems}} (SUDS) {{for the treatment}} of stormwater runoff is becoming increasingly prevalent in Germany. Decentralised SUDS can offer a viable and attractive alternative to end of pipe treatment systems for stormwater runoff from urban areas. However, there is still some uncertainty regarding the long-term performance of SUDS, and the general legislative requirements for SUDS approval and testing. Whilst the allowable pollution levels in stormwater runoff that infiltrate into ground and/or water table are regulated across Germany by the Federal Soil Protection Law, there is presently no federal law addressing the discharge requirements for surface water runoff. The lack of clear guidance can make it difficult for planners and designers to implement these innovative and sustainable stormwater treatment systems. This study clarifies the current understanding of urban stormwater treatment requirements and new technical <b>approval</b> <b>guidelines</b> for decentralised SUDS devices in Germany. The study findings should assist researchers, designers and asset managers to better anticipate and understand the performance, effective life-spans, and the planning and maintenance requirements for decentralised SUDS systems.

The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to see if on-site portable pull-out tests in South Africa on post-installed chemical and mechanical fixings can produce similar results to internationally laboratory tested fixings. The method used in the field study was to use typical South African 25 MPa, 75 mm slump ready mix concrete as supplied by a reputable supplier and to test several types of fixings in common situations, some covered in the European Technical <b>Approval</b> <b>Guidelines</b> (ETAG) and some not. The results were analyzed against published international values and theoretical calculations for the fixings. The findings showed that the results produced using the portable equipment can show values similar to the published and theoretical values.

It is also used off-label in patients with acute, suspected or antecedent heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The aim of this prospective observational cohort study was to document fondaparinux' prescription practice, tolerance and therapy safety in a representative mixed German single-centre patient cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS Between 09 / 2008 - 04 / 2009, 231 consecutive patients treated with fondaparinux were enrolled. Medical data were obtained from patient's records. The patients were clinically screened for thrombosis (Wells score), sequelae of HIT (4 T's score), and bleeding complications (ISTH-criteria) and subjected to further assessment (i. e. sonography, HIT-diagnostics), if necessary. The mortality rate was assessed 30 days after therapy start. RESULTS Overall, 153 / 231 patients had a prophylactic, 74 / 231 patients a therapeutic, and 4 / 231 patients a successive prophylactic/therapeutic indication. In 11 / 231 patients fondaparinux was used due to suspected/antecedent HIT, in 5 / 231 patients due to a previous cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity to heparins. Other indications were rare.

40|$|Abstract. The {{need for}} {{protection}} against rockfall {{has led to}} the development of different types of technological solu-tions that are able to both prevent blocks from detaching from rock walls and to control, intercept or deviate the blocks dur-ing movement. Of the many devices that are able to inter-cept and stop a block, one of the most frequently used is net fence. Many different types of full-scale tests have been car-ried out, with different test site geometries and procedures to study their behaviour and to certify these devices. This has led to a series of data and information that are not easy to compare. The recent endorsement, by the European Or-ganization for Technical Approvals (EOTA), of a European Technical <b>Approval</b> <b>Guideline</b> (ETAG), which defines how to test and assess the performance of a net fence, is there-fore a great innovation that will change both the market and the design procedures of these devices.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{investigation}} into the cause and consequences of an observed brittle behaviour of some starter bars on a construction site in the Netherlands. A few bars suddenly failed when they were bent in order to align them. For the investigation firstly a batch of starter bars that possibly exhibited the same brittle behaviour was traced using a bending test. Both a parameter related to the applied manufacturing process and the nitrogen content of the starter bars, were used to distinguish between probable brittle and ductile starter bars. The fatigue behaviour of the brittle starter bars as well as the ductility of the connection in which these starter bars were used, were investigated experimentally. The fatigue life appeared to be reduced and brittle failures were also observed in the connection where the starter bars are loaded in tension. It could be demonstrated that the structure in which these starter bars were used, still satisfies the requirements. Since the observed brittle behaviour can not be detected by the tests according to the current Dutch <b>Approval</b> <b>Guideline,</b> it is recommended to add an additional bending test, which might be defined using the results of this investigation...|$|R

The impetus for the White Paper, a recommendation from the Practice, Education, and Regulation Congruence (PERC) Task Force, is described. The history of approval/accreditation of nursing programs is discussed, both in the U. S. and globally. The comprehensive work on approval/accreditation processes that was done at NCSBN in the 1990 s is reviewed and put in context with the current research done at NCSBN. Globalization issues of approval processes are discussed, considering the <b>approval</b> <b>guidelines</b> issued by the International Council of Nurses. The current models of approval/accreditation by boards of nursing in the U. S. are presented, and advantages/disadvantages of each model are discussed. The 5 models are: I. Boards of nursing act independently to approve/accredit nursing programs. II. Boards of nursing collaborate with the national nursing accreditors, on visits and/or with the program reports, when approving programs. III. Boards of nursing deem national nursing accreditation as meeting state approvals. III a. Boards of nursing deem accreditation as meeting approvals, though they require further documentation. IV. Boards of nursing require national nursing accreditation. V. Boards of nursing are not involved with the approval system at all. The future trends of, and recommendations for, approval/accreditation processes are identified and include: • Researchers are looking at the best ways to educate nurses. • It is recommended that all approval/accreditation processes include the 5 competencies cited in the 2003 Institute of Medicine report, entitled, “Health Professions Education: A Bridge to Quality. ” These competencies are: o Delivering patient-centered car...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAbstractBackgroundHospital-acquired and ventilator-associated {{pneumonia}} (HAP/VAP) {{are often}} selected for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) aiming at new drug <b>approval.</b> <b>Guidelines</b> {{for the design}} of such RCTs have been repeatedly updated by regulatory agencies. We hypothesized that large variability in the enrolled populations, the endpoints assessed and the HAP/VAP definition criteria may impact the results of these studies, and addressed this through a systematic review of HAP/VAP RCTs. MethodsA search (Pubmed-Embase-ICAAC-ECCMID) of all RCTs published between 1994 and 2016 comparing antimicrobial treatment for HAP/VAP {{in the intensive care unit}} was conducted. The populations enrolled, inclusion/exclusion criteria, statistical design and endpoints assessed were recorded. All unpublished RCTs recorded on the ClinicalTrials. gov registry were also screened. ResultsFrom the 93 abstracts reviewed, 39 potentially relevant studies were inspected, leading to 27 studies being included. As expected, illness severity or the proportion with VAP (27 – 100 %) differed greatly among the enrolled populations. The HAP/VAP definition used various clinical and biological criteria, and only 55 % of studies required a microbiological sample. The mandatory duration of prior hospital stay was variable; the mechanical ventilation duration was an inclusion criterion in only 41 % of VAP studies. Nine studies had non-inferiority design, but nine studies (33 %) did not have a pre-specified statistical hypothesis. Clinical cure was the primary endpoint in 24 studies, but was recorded in several populations or as the co-primary endpoint in 13 studies. The definition of clinical cure and the timing of its assessment greatly differed. This variability slightly improved over time but remained significant in the 13 registered but currently unpublished RCTs that we screened. ConclusionOur study provides a description of populations and endpoints of RCTs evaluating antimicrobials for treatment of HAP/VAP in the ICU. There was significant heterogeneity in enrollment criteria, endpoints and statistical design, which may influence the ability of studies to demonstrate differences between studied drugs...|$|E

Data on the characteristics of practice, prescription rates of antipsychotic, and information sources about their clinical decisions were collected. Most psychiatrists used second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), and preferentially an oral formulation, in the treatment of schizophrenia. LAI SGAs were prescribed to 30. 4 % of schizophrenic patients. The duration and type of practice did not influence the class or formulation of antipsychotics used. The clinicians following the higher percentage of schizophrenic patients were associated with a higher use of LAI antipsychotics and a lower use of oral SGAs.

AIM: The present study's aim was to establish the upper threshold of the concentration of BDNF in Naval Medical Research Institute (NMRI) mice spiral ganglion outgrowth. METHODS: Spiral ganglion explants were prepared from post-natal day 4 (p 4) (NMRI) mice of both sexes under the <b>approval</b> and <b>guidelines</b> of the regional council of Hearing Research Institute Tubingen. RESULTS: Spiral ganglion explants were cultured at postnatal days 4 in the presence of different concentrations of BDNF as described under methods. We chose an age of postnatal day (P 4) and concentrations of BDNF 0; 6; 12. 5; 25 and 50 ƞg/ml. Averaged neurite outgrowth is measured in 4 different cultures that were treated with different concentrations. Results show that with increasing concentrations of BDNF, the neurite density increases. CONCLUSION: The present finding show evidence that BDNF has a clear incremental effect on the number of neurites of spiral ganglia in the prehearing organ, but less on the neurite length. The upper threshold of exogenous BNDF concentration on spiral ganglion explant is 25 ƞg/ml. This means that concentration beyond this level has no further incremental impact. Therefore our suggestion for hydrogel concentration in NMRA mice in future research should be 25 ƞg/ml...|$|R

Some States and localities regulate recombinant DNA research, however, and many private companies have voluntarily submitted information on their recombinant DNA work for RAC and NIH <b>approval.</b> The NIH <b>guidelines</b> underwent a major revision in December 1978 and have been revised approximately every 3 months since then. NIH supports experiments to assess recombinant DNA risks and publishes and updates a plan for a risk assessment program...|$|R
40|$|Background. It was {{important}} to develop South African guidelines {{in view of the}} extent of local and worldwide religious affiliation, rapid growth of academic investigation, guidelines provided by other associations (e. g. Royal College of Psychiatrists), the South African Society of Psychiatrists (SASOP) ’s own position statements on culture, mental health and psychiatry, the appropriate definition of spirituality, the need for an evolutionary and anthropological approach, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5 th edition (DSM-V) ’s cultural formulation, local legislation, ongoing research, and teaching requirements.   Objective. To report on the outcome of the peer-reviewed process that was followed to draft local guidelines for psychiatric training and practice.   Methods. During 2013, comments by members of the SASOP on a framework for guidelines on the role of spirituality in psychiatry practice and training were collated and subsequently submitted to the SASOP board for <b>approval.</b>   Results. <b>Guidelines</b> were compiled in terms of: (i) integrating spirituality in clinical care and service provision; (ii) integrating spirituality in psychiatric training; (iii) ethically integrating spirituality within the professional scope of practice; and (iv) appropriate referral between psychiatrists and spiritual advisors.   Conclusions. Integrating spirituality in the approach to practice and training cannot be ignored by local psychiatrists in the multicultural, multireligious and spiritually diverse South African context...|$|R
40|$|Local governments across Australia make a vital {{contribution}} in strengthening {{the economy and}} securing the well-being of children and families. Ensuring existing and future communities have access to adequate child care is an ongoing challenge. To address this challenge, the Commonwealth Department of Education engaged the UTS Centre for Local Government and Australian Centre of Excellence for Local Government to develop national Guidelines for the Planning and Development of Child Care Facilities. These guidelines are now available for local governments, developers and child care providers.   They enable councils to plan better for the future child care needs of their community through their strategic planning, land use planning and development assessment functions.   The guidelines provide evidence-based guidance {{and easy to use}} checklists to help local governments build capacity to plan systematically and strategically. Supporting councils to work in partnership with a range of stakeholders to improve the availability of child care is also an important objective of the guidelines. All local governments can shape the availability of child care through strategic planning, land use planning and development assessment processes.   Through these functions, they help decide the priority of child care in their locality, where it is located and the size and the type of child care provided.   Local governments work within a broader context of state and national policy, legislation and regulations which govern the land use planning and service approval processes.   Within this framework, access to child care can be facilitated by local governments planning in collaboration with other government agencies, child care providers and the local community.   The information contained in the Guidelines for the Planning and Development of Child Care Facilities can also inform discussions with state level organisations responsible for the establishment and delivery of child care services.   The ultimate objective is to promote more streamlined mechanisms for development and service <b>approval.</b> • <b>Guidelines</b> for the Planning and Development of Childcare Facilities won a Planning Institute of Australia (NSW) Planning Excellence Award in 2014. This original resource provides up-to-date, inter- jurisdictional planning advice and resources for councils looking to increase the availability of child-care centres within their municipalities.  ...|$|R
