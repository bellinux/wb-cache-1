The current strengthening mechanisms of CNT/metal composite mainly rely on CNTs' interaction with dislocations and CNT's intrinsic high strength. Here we demonstrated that laser shock loading the CNT/metal composite results in high density nanotwins, stacking fault, dislocation around the CNT/metal interface. The composites exhibit enhanced strength with excellent stability. The results are interpreted by both molecular dynamics simulation and experiments.

40|$|Abstract—The {{prevention}} of {{sudden cardiac death}} (SCD), frequently caused by ventricular fibrillation (VF), is commonly accomplished with defibrillation shocks. Nevertheless, incidences of defibrillation failure {{have been reported in}} practical applications and physiological investigations, the mechanisms of which have not been fully explained. Physiological experiments have suggested that intracellular Ca (Ca i) dynamics {{may play a role in}} reinitiating VF via triggered activity, resulting in defibrillation failure. We hypothesize that defibrillation failure can occur due to spontaneous Ca release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and subsequent early afterdepolarizations (EADs), which are caused by Cai accumulation in fibrillating tissue. This hypothesis was tested with computer simulations of two-dimensional (2 D) tissue that incorporated: a bidomain representation of tissue; an action potential model that exhibits Ca i dynamics with parameter changes facilitating the appearance of EADs; a fixed distribution of the <b>applied</b> <b>shock</b> current; and a mathematical model of the electroporation phenomenon. We found that when EAD clusters appeared due to rapidly rotating spiral waves in 2 D tissue, they facilitated defibrillation failure via triggered activity that produced additional spiral waves after shock application. Similar triggered activity phenomena may be observed with delayed afterdepolarizations and represent a topic for an additional investigation.

40|$|The shock {{response}} of four common semicrystalline thermoplastic polymers—polyethylene (PE), polyvinylchloride (PVC), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and polychlorotrifluoroethylene (PCTFE) —have {{been studied in}} terms of their Hugoniots, release velocities and shear strengths. Through the variations in behaviour caused by changes to the attached atoms to the carbon backbone, it has been possible to suggest that there are two main factors in play. The first is an electrostatic repulsion between adjacent polymer chains. Where this force is large, for example in PTFE with highly electronegative fluorine atoms, this results in this force dominating the {{shock response}}, with low shock velocities, high release velocities and little if no hardening behind the shock front. In contrast, in materials such as PE, this force is now weaker, due to the lower electronegativity of hydrogen, and hence this force is easier to overcome by the <b>applied</b> <b>shock</b> stress. Now the main factor affecting shock behaviour is controlled by the shape of the polymer chain allowing inter chain tangling (tacticity). This results in higher shock velocities, lower release speeds and significant hardening behind the shock front as the chains are forced together. This is prevalent in materials with a relatively open structure such as PE and is enhanced with the presence of large side groups or atoms off the main polymer chain.

40|$|Natural, {{synthetic}} and {{combinations of}} natural and synthetic materials are used widely in contemporary sports surfaces which {{have been designed to}} encourage elastic deformation under load, in order to increase athletic performance {{and at the same time}} reduce the risk of injury. In response to this need, manufacturers have developed a wide variety of indoor sports flooring systems types, which are generally separated into two major categories, area-elastic sports surfaces and point-elastic sports surfaces. Area elastic sport surface structures attenuate energy by allowing deformation over a comparatively large area, where as point elastic sport surface structures deform in response to applied forces over a relatively small area, in close proximity to the point of impact. Sports surfaces can therefore be extremely complicated arrangements of materials, which contribute to a surface&# 039;s complex behaviour. The materials used in each of these surface categories, attenuate the energy applied to a surface by an athlete, in order to reduce the energy returned to the athlete.

Spores of Bacillus subtilis were used as a model system to study the effects of a simulated impact-caused ejection on rock-colonizing microorganisms using a high-explosive plane wave setup. Embedded in different types of rock material, spores were subjected to extremely high shock pressures (5 to 50 GPa) lasting for fractions of microseconds to seconds. Nearly exponential pressure response curves were obtained for spore survival and linear dependency for the induction of sporulation-defective mutants.

To assess the nature of the critical physical parameter responsible for spore inactivation by ultrahigh shock pressures, the resulting peak temperature was varied by lowering the preshock temperature, changing the rock composition and porosity, or increasing the water content of the samples. Increased peak temperatures led to increased spore inactivation and reduced mutation rates.

The test results proved that the compressive strength of concrete increases with per cent increase in GGBS up to 40 %. Beyond 40 %, there is marginal decrease in strength of concrete.

40|$|The {{development}} and exploitation of materials science, such as chemical synthesis, physical {{processes such as}} diffusion and transport, and {{the understanding of the}} thermodynamics that drives these processes are the foundation of new materials and material structures. For example, novel approaches in growth and processing techniques combined with an understanding of quantum effects have {{led to the development of}} quantum dots and nanoparticles with unique electronic and optoelectronic properties. Subsequently, new applications have emerged in the field of quantum dot electronics, energy storage systems, and optical communication devices. In the present study, we have extended the principles of chemical synthesis to the solid phase regime to achieve the formation of nanoparticles of scintillating materials (BaGdF₅ and GdF₃) in different solid glass matrices to form novel transparent nanocomposite scintillators. Judicious manipulation of materials choice and thermal processing to drive diffusion and control solubility in the liquid-solid space has resulted in the selection of the robust host glass matrix and the high energy radiation absorbing material (aluminosilicate glass as the host for BaGdF₅:Tb nanoparticles). These nanocomposite and similar material systems offer a new approach to achieve large area, low-cost and efficient scintillators. As a result, we have achieved 2. 4 times improvement in light output under gamma-ray excitation. To further enhance efficiency, we have investigated technologies for patterning 2 D photonic crystal structures into the surface of the scintillators to improve light out-coupling into a photomultiplier tube (PMT). The potential of this embodiment has been demonstrated and resulted in a completely different and new opportunity for dynamic load sensing. During the investigation of 2 D photonic crystal structures for dynamic loading sensing, it has become apparent that linearly deposited multilayer (1 D photonic crystal) structures offer the best solution; therefore, optical microcavity (OMC) and distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) multilayer structures have been examined in greater detail. From a deeper understanding of the interplay between the optical and acoustic properties, highly sensitive devices (Ag/Al₂O₃/SiO₂/Al₂O₃/Ag asymmetrical OMC (AOMC) and SiOx₁/SiOx₂ DBR structures) have been successfully developed and extensively characterized.
