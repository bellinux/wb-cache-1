30|$|In this work, {{we present}} an {{operator}} called GRAB, {{developed as a}} generalization of LBP. While we will show the effectiveness of GRAB, like other multi-resolution approaches, there is likelihood that it will suffer the curse of dimensionality. There are techniques for reducing dimensionality. For example, Chan et al. [17] uses subspace techniques of LDA to help reduce the dimensionality of standard MLBP while maintaining or increasing {{the accuracy of the}} added dimensionality. In terms of added accuracy, they argue that, ‘However, by directly applying the similarity measurement to the multi-scale LBP histogram, the performance will be compromised. The reason is that this histogram is of high dimensionality and contains redundant information’. While Chan et al. show impressive results, in this work, we use GRAB and scale-selection algorithm rather than MBLP to avoid sampling issues and will use SVMs for recognition, which remove the redundancy in a different, and generally more effective way. And again, our focus is on <b>addressing</b> <b>recognition</b> under scale changes, not just improving recognition rates.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{automatic}} analysis {{system for the}} Arabic handwriting postal <b>addresses</b> <b>recognition,</b> by using the beta elliptical model. Our system is divided into different steps: analysis, pre-processing and classification. The first operation is the filtering of image. In the second, we remove the border print, stamps and graphics. After locating the address on the envelope, the address segmentation allows the extraction of postal code and city name separately. The pre-processing system and the modeling approach are based on two basic steps. The first step is the extraction of the temporal order {{in the image of}} the handwritten trajectory. The second step is based on the use of Beta-Elliptical model for the representation of handwritten script. The recognition system is based on Graph-matching algorithm. Our modeling and recognition approaches were validated by using the postal code and city names extracted from the Tunisian postal envelopes data. The recognition rate obtained is about 98 %.

Five apple varieties were studied using three different analytical techniques: HPLC, electronic tongue multisensor system based on potentiometric chemical sensors and FTIR spectroscopy. Twenty samples (apples) of each variety were measured.

We demonstrate that modeling aggregate counts of visual words is surprisingly expressive enough for such a challenging recognition task. An activity is represented by a sum-product network (SPN). SPN {{is a mixture of}} bags-of-words (BoWs) with exponentially many mixture components, where subcomponents are reused by larger ones. SPN consists of terminal nodes representing BoWs, and product and sum nodes organized in a number of layers. The products are aimed at encoding particular configurations of primitive actions, and the sums serve to capture their alternative configurations. The connectivity of SPN and parameters of BoW distributions are learned under weak supervision using the EM algorithm. SPN inference amounts to parsing the SPN graph, which yields the most probable explanation (MPE) of the video in terms of activity detection and localization. SPN inference has linear complexity in the number of nodes, under fairly general conditions, enabling fast and scalable recognition. A new Volleyball dataset is compiled and annotated for evaluation. Our classification accuracy and localization precision and recall are superior to those of the state-of-the-art on the benchmark and our Volleyball datasets. 1...|$|R
