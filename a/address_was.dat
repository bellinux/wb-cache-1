5|$|A {{central theme}} of President Obama's inaugural <b>address</b> <b>was</b> a call to restore responsibility—both in terms of {{accountability}} in Washington and the responsibility of ordinary people to get involved. Obama's address did not have memorable sound bite phrases. Instead, he used traditional references to connect his new administration with the nation's history in a speech that was understated deliberately, according to rhetoric expert James Mackin.|$|E

Additionally, the old Fourth Avenue entrance was restored, and the <b>address</b> <b>was</b> changed to 1221 S.W. Fourth Avenue. Renovations also {{restored the}} original look of the City Council chamber, with council members now facing the windows.|$|E

When Anne died on 8 August 1622, she was buried at Calvert's local Protestant parish church, St Martin-in-the-Fields.|$|E
40|$|The first {{question}} to be asked in any consideration of <b>addressing</b> <b>is</b> what are the types of object for which <b>addresses</b> <b>are</b> being provided? The {{most common form of}} an <b>address</b> <b>is</b> the postal <b>address.</b> In this case, the “addressable object” is the postal delivery point. This <b>address</b> <b>is</b> frequently used as a synonym for the building, be it residential, commercial or public, and for referencing purposes beyond the delivery of mail. The <b>address</b> <b>is</b> usually built around a property identifier (e. g. building number or name), street name, and a sequence of geographic areas (town, county, country etc). However, {{there is no reason why}} <b>addresses</b> should <b>be</b> restricted to buildings. This paper discusses the requirement for addresses, how <b>addresses</b> can <b>be</b> created for a range of classes of addressable object, and outlines a definitive <b>address</b> infrastructure.

5|$|A keen geographer, Towner {{would often}} {{disappear}} into the bush for weeks on end, for study or exploration. As {{a fellow of the}} Royal Geographical Society of Australia and member of the Royal Historical Society of New South Wales, he took a particular interest in researching the life of the explorer Sir Thomas Mitchell. In 1946, he successfully lobbied the Australian Government to issue a postage stamp commemorating the centenary of Mitchell's discoveries in central Queensland. He addressed the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia in Brisbane in 1955, and was awarded the Dr Thomson Foundation Gold Medal for his geographical work the following year. Towner's <b>address</b> <b>was</b> published in 1957, in a booklet entitled Lake Eyre and its Tributaries.|$|E
5|$|An {{area the}} Reform Act did not <b>address</b> <b>was</b> {{the issue of}} {{municipal}} and regional government. As a result of archaic traditions, many English counties had enclaves and exclaves, which were mostly abolished in the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844. Furthermore, many new conurbations and economic areas bridged traditional county boundaries by having been formed in previously obscure areas: the West Midlands conurbation bridged Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Worcestershire, Manchester and Liverpool both had hinterlands in Cheshire but city centres in Lancashire, while in the south Oxford's developing southern suburbs were in Berkshire and London was expanding into Essex, Surrey and Middlesex. This led to further acts to reorganise county boundaries {{in the late nineteenth}} and twentieth centuries.|$|E
50|$|In the {{automatic}} address configuration process, network hosts select a random candidate address within the reserved range and use Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) probes to ascertain that the <b>address</b> <b>is</b> {{not in use}} on the network. If a reply is received to the ARP, it indicates the candidate IP <b>address</b> <b>is</b> already in use; a new random candidate IP <b>address</b> <b>is</b> then created and the process repeated. The process ends {{when there is no}} reply to the ARP, indicating the candidate IP <b>address</b> <b>is</b> available.|$|R

50|$|Universally {{administered}} and locally administered <b>addresses</b> <b>are</b> {{distinguished by}} setting the second-least-significant {{bit of the}} first octet of the <b>address.</b> This bit <b>is</b> {{also referred to as}} the U/L bit, short for Universal/Local, which identifies how the <b>address</b> <b>is</b> administered. If the bit <b>is</b> 0, the <b>address</b> <b>is</b> universally administered. If it <b>is</b> 1, the <b>address</b> <b>is</b> locally administered. In the example address 06-00-00-00-00-00 the first octet is 06 (hex), the binary form of which is 00000110, where the second-least-significant bit is 1. Therefore, it is a locally administered address. Consequently, this bit is 0 in all OUIs.|$|R
5|$|Charles Churchill {{suffered}} ill-health in {{his later}} years and retired from active involvement in the companies in 1915. His son, Charles Henry Churchill, assumed the responsibilities of chairman and managing director. Charles Churchill died on 14 or 15 February 1916; his last <b>address</b> <b>was</b> 321 Seven Sisters Road, Stoke Newington, London. His son, C H Churchill, had died six days earlier. W Chamberlain was appointed chairman, and Arthur Lyman Churchill, son of Charles, stepped up from head of the small tool grinding department to become managing director and, in 1920, chairman. Willis Clark Churchill, brother of Arthur, became a board member after 30 years of association with the business but died {{before the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt had {{the tree}} {{moved from the}} Ellipse to the White House grounds, where it {{remained}} until 1954 when it was returned to the Ellipse. In 1946, the lighting ceremony became a televised event, though not with widespread telecast. From 1948 to 1951, President Harry S. Truman signalled the lighting of the tree by remote control from his Independence, Missouri home, but in 1952, he stayed at the White House for the lighting ceremony. In 1953, the ceremony was widely telecast and President Dwight David Eisenhower's <b>address</b> <b>was</b> radio broadcast through the Voice of America in thirty-four languages.|$|E
5|$|In {{avoiding}} {{war with}} Great Britain, he guaranteed {{a decade of}} peace and profitable trade by securing the Jay Treaty in 1795, despite intense opposition from the Jeffersonians. He oversaw {{the creation of a}} strong, well-financed national government that maintained neutrality in the French Revolutionary Wars, suppressed the Whiskey Rebellion, and won wide acceptance amongst Americans. Washington's incumbency established many precedents still in use today, such as the cabinet system, the inaugural address, and the title Mr. President. His retirement from office after two terms established a tradition that lasted until 1940 and was later made law by the 22nd Amendment. He remained non-partisan, never joining the Federalist Party, although he largely supported its policies. Washington's Farewell <b>Address</b> <b>was</b> an influential primer on civic virtue, warning against partisanship, sectionalism, and involvement in foreign wars.|$|E

50|$|Initially, {{users are}} able to choose a range of IP {{addresses}} for their VPC. Within this range, users can assign various private and public IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to instances in the VPC in order {{to communicate with the}} Internet and other instances of VPCs. These <b>addresses</b> <b>are</b> assigned to specific instances rather than the user's entire VPC account.Static assignment of Public IP <b>addresses</b> <b>is</b> not possible, instead the <b>address</b> <b>is</b> assigned and unassigned in certain cases, causing the address of an instance to change. When a consistent IP <b>address</b> <b>is</b> needed, a third type of IP Address, Elastic IP <b>addresses,</b> can <b>be</b> used in place of Public IP addresses.|$|R

He was wounded in action several times, and commended many times in reports by Allied commanders. In March 1917, he was wounded in the left leg and hospitalised in England. In May 1917, while recovering in Scotland, he met waitress Elizabeth A. Stewart (c. 1896–unknown), who was the daughter of Royal Navy cook George Stewart.
