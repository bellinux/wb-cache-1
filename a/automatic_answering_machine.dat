Jokes are recorded on an <b>automatic</b> <b>answering</b> <b>machine.</b> In the past, many jokes were recorded on cassette tape and then played sequentially, each caller hearing the next joke on the tape. Modern touch tone phones allow callers to select different joke types: knock-knock, joke of the day, professional humor, random, etc.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMany {{researchers}} have studied speech emotion for {{years from the}} perspective of psychology to engineering. To date, none has made the speech emotion recognition system intuitive enough {{in such a way that}} it can be embedded in <b>automatic</b> <b>answering</b> <b>machines</b> that can effectively detect the various affective states of human verbal communication. In most cases the underlying emotional information was misinterpreted thus resulting in wrong feedbacks and responses. The complexity of understanding and analyzing speech emotion is presented in the dynamics of the emotion itself. Emotion is dynamic and changeable over time. Hence, it is imperative to cater for this parameter to boost the performance of the speech emotion recognition system. In this paper, values of Valence (V) and Arousal(A) are used to generate a recalibrated affective space model. Such approach is adopted from psychologists’ understanding that emotion can be represented using emotion primitives’ values. The VA approach is then coupled with the brain associative memory concept that can provides a better means in understanding the dynamics of speech emotion. Results of such analysis tallies with the psychological findings and has its practical implementation...|$|R
40|$|An <b>automatic</b> {{telephone}} <b>answering</b> <b>machine</b> or {{system is}} an electronic device that answers automatically to an incoming telephone call and plays a prerecorded message and {{is capable of}} recording a message the caller want to leave. These systems include message recording system having remote acess to message playback, automatic dialing, equipment to receive an alarm, automatic data entry-answering systems and other common telephone devices being used along with modem equipments. The microcontroller typically controls a number of peripherals, components of the <b>answering</b> <b>machine</b> such as an LCD or LED display, an indicator light for recording and playback options, a DTMF receiver and an audio controller. A telephone <b>answering</b> <b>machine</b> must be capble of being remotely activated consisting of:  A switch deciding the mode of operation either automatic or normal mode.  Provison for receiving the calls automatically when in automatic mode.  Provison for recording the message to be deliverd to the incoming user and also to record his mesage  Storage for the message  Microcontoller to deliver control signal as per the mode of operation Commonly used telephone answering devices comprises {{of a number of}} features which allow a user to examine the presence of a call, seize calls, play back recorded voice messages, record an announcement etc. Triggering of a telephone <b>answering</b> <b>machine</b> done by counting the incoming ring signals and when the count surpass a preset number set by the user.

5000|$|Most 20th century <b>answering</b> <b>machines</b> used {{magnetic}} recording which Valdemar Poulsen invented in 1898. [...] The {{creation of the}} first practical <b>automatic</b> <b>answering</b> device for telephones, however, is in dispute. Clarence Hickman worked for Bell Laboratories from 1930 where he developed methods for the {{magnetic recording}} and working on the recognition of speech patterns and electromechanical switching systems. In 1934, he developed a tape-based <b>answering</b> <b>machine</b> which phone company AT&T, {{as the owner of}} Bell Laboratories, kept under wraps for years for fear that an <b>answering</b> <b>machine</b> would result in fewer telephone calls. Many claim it was William Muller in 1935, {{but it could have been}} created already in 1931 by William Schergens whose device used phonographic cylinders. Ludwig Blattner promoted a telephone <b>answering</b> <b>machine</b> in 1929 based on his Blattnerphone magnetic recording technology. In 1935 inventor Benjamin Thornton developed a machine to record voice messages from the caller. The device reportedly also was able to keep track of the time the recordings were made. Although many sources maintain that he invented it in 1935, Thornton had actually filed a patent in 1930 (Number 1831331) for this machine, which utilized a phonographic record as the recording medium.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Increased {{incidence}} of telephone <b>answering</b> <b>machines</b> {{and the use}} of such devices to screen calls pose a potential threat to the representativeness of samples in telephone surveys. Using data from nine statewide surveys, this analysis examines the ex-tent to which <b>answering</b> <b>machines</b> are used to screen calls and the demographic characteristics associated with answering ma-chine use and call screening. Results show that at most two to three percent of households use <b>answering</b> <b>machines</b> to screen calls, and that such screening is more likely to take place in households with higher family incomes, outside rural areas, and which include individuals who are younger and have higher levels of education.
