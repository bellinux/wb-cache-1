25|$|The {{creation}} of a GIUH is possible given nothing more than topologic data for a particular drainage basin. In fact, only the number of streams of a given order, the mean length of streams of a given order, and the mean land area draining directly to streams of a given order <b>are</b> <b>absolutely</b> required (and can be estimated rather than explicitly calculated if necessary).

25|$|Mycorrhizal fungi form a mutualistic {{relationship}} with the roots of most plant species. In such a relationship, both the plants themselves and {{those parts of the}} roots that host the fungi, are said to be mycorrhizal. Relatively few of the mycorrhizal relationships between plant species and fungi have been examined to date, but 95% of the plant families investigated are predominantly mycorrhizal either in the sense that most of their species associate beneficially with mycorrhizae, or <b>are</b> <b>absolutely</b> dependent on mycorrhizae. The Orchidaceae are notorious as a family in which the absence of the correct mycorrhizae is fatal even to germinating seeds.|$|E
25|$|A {{chemically}} pure and structurally perfect diamond is perfectly transparent with no hue, or color. However, in reality almost no gem-sized natural diamonds <b>are</b> <b>absolutely</b> perfect. The {{color of a}} diamond may be affected by chemical impurities and/or structural defects in the crystal lattice. Depending on the hue and intensity of a diamond's coloration, a diamond's color can either detract from or enhance its value. For example, most white diamonds are discounted in price when more yellow hue is detectable, while intense pink diamonds or blue diamonds (such as the Hope Diamond) can be dramatically more valuable. Of all colored diamonds, red diamonds are the rarest. The Aurora Pyramid of Hope displays a spectacular array of naturally colored diamonds, including red diamonds.|$|E

25|$|This statue to {{the right}} speaks well for the {{equality}} of gender in ancient Egypt that a private lady could have a sculpture made for herself. The heavy tripartite wig frames the broad face and passes behind the ears, thus giving the impression of forcing them forward.

Whereas the natural curve of the eyebrows dips towards the root of the nose, the artificial eyebrows in low relief <b>are</b> <b>absolutely</b> straight above the inner corners of the eyes, a feature which places the bust early in Dynasty XII. Around 1900 B.C. these artificial eyebrows, too, began to follow the natural curve and dipped toward the nose.|$|E

The court must then immediately stay the proceedings. Further, in any civil or criminal proceedings started for printing or publishing any extract from or abstract of any document published under Parliament's authority, the court must grant judgment in favour of the defendant or accused if satisfied that the extract or abstract was printed or published bona fide and without malice.|$|E
25|$|Motility {{is a key}} {{virulence}} determinant in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{has three}} distinct methods of moving across or through a medium. Rhamnolipids are particularly important in swarming motility where they are postulated to lower the surface tension of the surface through their surfactant properties, allowing the bacterial cell to swarm. New evidence suggests that rhamnolipids are necessary to allow Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells to overcome attachment mediated by type IV pili. There is some discrepancy between the role of HAAs and RHLs in swarming motility. Some studies use a rhlA mutation to assess the effect on motility, which prevents the formation of HAAs and rhamnolipids. Studies that use a rhlB mutant show that Pseudomonas aeruginosa can swarm {{in the absence of}} rhamnolipids, but HAAs <b>are</b> <b>absolutely</b> necessary for swarming. Rhamnolipids have been proposed to be important in regulating swarm tendril formation.|$|E

25|$|As {{typical for}} the CMGC kinase group, the {{catalytic}} site of MAP kinases {{has a very}} loose consensus sequence for substrates. Like all their relatives, they only require the target serine / threonine amino acids {{to be followed by}} a small amino acid, preferably proline ("proline-directed kinases"). But as SP/TP sites are extremely common in all proteins, additional substrate-recognition mechanisms have evolved to ensure signaling fidelty. Unlike their closest relatives, the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), where substrates are recognized by the cyclin subunit, MAPKs associate with their substrates via auxiliary binding regions on their kinase domains. The most important such region consists of the hydrophobic docking groove and the negatively charged CD-region. Together they recognize the so-called MAPK docking or D-motifs (also called kinase interaction motif / KIM). D-motifs essentially consist of one or two positively charged amino acids, followed by alternating hydrophobic residues (mostly leucines), typically upstream of the phosphorylation site by 10–50 amino acids. Many of the known MAPK substrates contain such D-motifs that can not only bind to, but also provide specific recognition by certain MAPKs. Interestingly, D-motifs are not restricted to substrates: MAP2 kinases also contain such motifs on their N-termini that <b>are</b> <b>absolutely</b> required for MAP2K-MAPK interaction and MAPK activation. Similarly, both dual-specificity MAP kinase phosphatases and MAP-specific tyrosine phosphatases bind to MAP kinases through the same docking site. D-motifs can even be found in certain MAPK pathway regulators and scaffolds (e.g. in the mammalian JIP proteins).|$|E
25|$|In 1992 a {{campaign}} was organised against poorings {{out by a}} vocal minority of students who claimed victimisation. College authorities banned poorings out {{on the basis of}} legal liability in 1993. Rather than simply disappearing, the tradition of the pooring out has merely evolved to suit the contemporary climate. Today, pooring out is an honour generally reserved for students elected to prominent positions in the college, particularly the Student Heads. Both men and women may now be poored out; however the actual practice is most often gender segregated. For example, a man of college is defended by men and poored out by men, while a woman of college is defended by women and poored out by women. On account of the administration’s aforementioned hostility to the practice, they are no longer supposed to take place on college grounds and <b>are</b> <b>absolutely</b> forbidden in Strachan Hall. Rather, poorings-out now often occur during The Lit. However, their actual form has changed little. The student selected to be poored out lies across a table while three of his fellow students lie across him to defend him. The assemblage is then rushed by the upper year students, who shred the gown of the person, while removing his or her defenders. Once a student has been poored out, they wear the remains of their gown bound as a sash. The gown is never to be washed, mended or sewn and must be worn in its original state as a sign of pride for the experiences of the student whilst at Trinity.|$|E
