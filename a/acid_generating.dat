50|$|Nitro {{compounds}} {{are common}} in pharmaceuticals, explosives, dyes, and plastics. As for carbon compounds, catalysed Michael additions and aldol reactions can be used. For aromatic nitro compounds, synthesis is via a substitution reaction. The standard synthesis is carried out in a solution of nitric acid, mixed with excess sulfuric acid to create nitronium ions. These are then substituted on to the aromatic species. Often, the para-isomer is the desired product, but standard systems have poor selectivity. As for acylation, the reaction is normally quenched with water, and creates copious acidic waste. Using a La(OTf)3 catalyst in place of sulfuric acid reduces this waste considerably. Clark et al. report 90% conversion using just 1 mol% of ytterbium triflate in weak nitric <b>acid,</b> <b>generating</b> only a small volume of acidic waste.|$|E

5000|$|Glycolysis is a {{metabolic}} pathway {{that takes place}} in the cytosol of cells in all living organisms. This pathway can function with or without the presence of oxygen. In humans, aerobic conditions produce pyruvate and anaerobic conditions produce lactate. In aerobic conditions, the process converts one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate (pyruvic <b>acid),</b> <b>generating</b> energy in the form of two net molecules of ATP. Four molecules of ATP per glucose are actually produced, however, two are consumed as part of the preparatory phase. The initial phosphorylation of glucose is required to increase the reactivity (decrease its stability) in order for the molecule to be cleaved into two pyruvate molecules by the enzyme aldolase. During the pay-off phase of glycolysis, four phosphate groups are transferred to ADP by substrate-level phosphorylation to make four ATP, and two NADH are produced when the pyruvate are oxidized. The overall reaction can be expressed this way: ...|$|E

The lake, {{and the site}} of the proposed mine, waste rock area, and tailings impoundments area, are perched above the Taseko River, which connects downstream with the highly productive salmon-bearing Chilko and Chilcotin Rivers before entering the Fraser River below Williams Lake. Some 240 m tonnes of potentially <b>acid</b> <b>generating</b> waste rock will need to be stored permanently underwater behind a massive dam to be built across the Fish Lake watershed. This structure will need to be maintained in perpetuity, for if the water capping the waste rock was to drain, acid generation in the exposed wasterock would present a serious environmental risk to downstream fisheries. Any inadvertent, accidental or even naturally caused effluent discharge from the tailings dam will inevitably end up in these river systems with potentially catastrophic results to one of BC’s most valuable fish runs. The massive dam and stored effluent and waste rock on the Fish Lake watershed would also pose serious threats for groundwater contamination by mine effluents draining from beneath the impoundment into the rocks and groundwater systems feeding the Taseko River. Any heavy metals stored in dissolved or solid form in the tailings will pose a risk to Taseko River water quality. All of these risks last not only for the mine life but forever, requiring a significant continual investment of inspection and maintenance effort by future generations.|$|E

40|$|Fifty-one {{waste rock}} samples {{collected}} from an abandoned mine in north Queensland, Australia were characterised by routine and advanced geochemical tests {{to aid the}} development of a mineralogical Acid Rock Drainage (ARD) Index. The ARD Index comprises five categories (diameter/size, degree of alteration and morphology of <b>acid</b> <b>generating</b> phase; content of neutralising phases and spatial relationship between <b>acid</b> <b>generating</b> and neutralising phases). Polished rock slices (up to 5 cm diameter) and petrographic thin sections were evaluated by these criteria and scored out of 50, with a higher number representing a greater <b>acid</b> <b>generating</b> potential. Ten mesotextural groups were identified and extensive geochemical testing confirmed there to be four potentially acid forming mesotextures (C, G, H & J). Classification using the mineralogical ARD Index recognised only two mesotextures as significantly acid forming (mesotextures H & J). ARD Index values were cross-checked against paste pH values which confirmed mesotextures C and G as not acid forming which is in agreement with the sulphide mineralogy.

40|$|For {{many years}} open pits {{have been used}} for the {{disposal}} of waste rock. Mine waste disposal has become an environmental issue that is watched closely by government agencies and the public due to the legacies of past mine waste disposal methods. An in-pit disposal program for <b>acid</b> <b>generating</b> waste rock was: conducted by Lakefield Research Limited at an abandoned mine site which operated as an open pit and underground mine. The mine was closed in 1975 and the mine property was included in a provincial park. Prior to commencing the in-pit disposal program, an Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) of the mine property was conducted. The data collected during the ESA was used to develop a reclamation program that would address the site specific conditions that would maximize the on site resources to minimize the costs of the reclamation program. A testing program was conducted as part of the ESA. The data from the testing program was used to determine the <b>acid</b> <b>generating</b> potential of the waste rock and the surface water quality. Two locations containing waste rock were generating acid during the ESA which had not generated acid at the time of closure, in 1975.
