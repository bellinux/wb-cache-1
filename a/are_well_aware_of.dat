On the other hand, obsolescence may sometimes be desirable to a company which can profit immensely from the regular purchase of what is often expensive new equipment instead of retaining one device {{for a longer period of}} time. Those in the industry <b>are</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> this, and may utilize planned obsolescence as a method of increasing profits.|$|E
25|$|Failing {{to respond}} to {{physiological}} warning signals or crossing mental barrier by strong will may lead to blackout underwater or on reaching the surface. Trained freedivers <b>are</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> this and competitions must be held under strict supervision and with competent first-aiders on standby. However this does not eliminate the risk of blackout. Freedivers are recommended to only dive with a 'buddy' who accompanies them, observing from in the water at the surface, and ready to dive to the rescue if the diver loses consciousness during the ascent. Due {{to the nature of}} the sport, any practice of freediving must include strict adherence to safety measures as an integral part of the activity, and all participants must also be adept in rescue and resuscitation. Without proper training and supervision, competitive freediving/apnea/breath-hold diving is extremely dangerous.|$|E
25|$|The basic social unit of {{the tiger}} is the {{elemental}} one of mother and offspring. Adult animals congregate only on an ad hoc and transitory basis when special conditions permit, such as plentiful supply of food. Otherwise they lead solitary lives, hunting individually for the dispersed forest and tall grassland animals, upon which they prey. They establish and maintain home ranges. Resident adults of either sex tend to confine their movements to a definite area of habitat within which they satisfy their needs, {{and in the case}} of tigresses, those of their growing cubs. Besides providing the requirements of an adequate food supply, sufficient water and shelter, and a modicum of peace and seclusion, this location must make it possible for the resident to maintain contact with other tigers, especially those of the opposite sex. Those sharing the same ground <b>are</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> each other's movements and activities.|$|E

500|$|In The Indian Pilgrim (1818) Sherwood {{tried to}} adapt Pilgrim's Progress for the Indian context; the work focused on [...] "the {{supposed}} depravity and pagan idolatry of Brahmans, fakirs, nautch (dance) girls, and soldiers' temporary wives." [...] This text demonstrates Sherwood's religious biases: [...] "Muslims and Jews receive better treatment than Hindus {{because of their}} belief in one God, but Roman Catholics fare little better than the Hindu idolaters." [...] The Indian Pilgrim, although never published in India, was popular in Britain and America. Sherwood also wrote texts for Indian servants of British families {{in the style of}} British writings for the poor. One of these was The Ayah and Lady (1813) in which the ayah, or maid, is [...] "portrayed as sly, selfish, lazy, and untrustworthy. Her employers <b>are</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> her faults, yet they tolerate her." [...] A more culturally sensitive and realistic portrayal of Indians appears in The Last Days of Boosy (1842), a sequel to The History of Little Henry and his Bearer, in which the converted Boosy is cast out of his family and community because of his conversion to Christianity.|$|E
500|$|A 2005 study led by Margo Lillie, a {{zoologist}} at the University of British Columbia, and her student Tracy Boechler, {{concluded that}} tipping a cow {{would require a}} force of nearly [...] and is therefore impossible to accomplish by a single person. Her calculations found that it would require more than four people to apply enough force to push over a cow, based on an estimate that a single person could exert [...] of force. However, since a cow can brace itself, Lillie and Boechler suggested that five or six people would, most likely, be needed. Further, cattle <b>are</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> their surroundings and {{are very difficult to}} surprise, due to excellent senses of both smell and hearing. Lillie and Boechler's analysis found that if a cow did not move, the principles of static physics suggest that two people might be able to tip a cow if its centre of mass were pushed over its hooves before the cow could react. However, cows are not rigid or unresponsive, and the faster humans have to move, the less force they can exert. Thus Lillie and Boechler concluded that it is unlikely that cows can actually be tipped over in this way. Lillie stated, [...] "It just makes the physics of it all, in my opinion, impossible." ...|$|E

The most appropriate word to describe {{the behavior of those}} individuals is 'denial'. Not all individuals who call themselves climate change skeptics are deniers.

2500|$|Hermione Jean Granger is a Muggle-born, Gryffindor {{student who}} becomes best friends with Harry Potter and Ron Weasley. J.K.

She is an overachiever who excels academically and is described by Rowling as a [...] "very logical, upright and good" [...] character.

2500|$|Within {{the labor}} movement, {{organizing}} {{is the cause}} within the cause. [...] In most industrialized nations, {{there has been a}} steady decline in union membership and in the influence of organized labor since the 1950s. [...] A response to this decline has been a renewed organizing effort. The heads of unions <b>are</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the problem. In the U.S., many labor activists have blamed John Sweeney, the former (1995â€“2009) President of the AFL-CIO, for not doing enough to organize. In fact, this has been cited as the genesis of the split within the American labor movement that {{led to the formation of}} the Change to Win Federation (a rival umbrella organization of North American unions set up as an alternative to the AFL-CIO in 2005), by Change to Win advocates at least. Many unions see organizing as a way to ensure the future of their organization. [...] Unions who emphasize organizing and are expansionist are said to have the [...] "organizing model." [...] By contrast, other unions are said to have the [...] "servicing model," [...] spending most of their resources on providing services to the existing membership (i.e., non-expansionist).|$|E
2500|$|Pliny also {{cites the}} opinion of Nicias, {{according}} to whom amber:is a liquid produced by the rays of the sun; and that these rays, {{at the moment of}} the sun's setting, striking with the greatest force upon the surface of the soil, leave upon it an unctuous sweat, which is carried off by the tides of the Ocean, and thrown up upon the shores of Germany. Besides the fanciful explanations according to which amber is [...] "produced by the Sun", Pliny cites opinions that <b>are</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> its origin in tree resin, citing the native Latin name of succinum (sÅ«cinum, from sucus [...] "juice"). He writes: Amber is produced from a marrow discharged by trees belonging to the pine genus, like gum from the cherry, and resin from the ordinary pine. It is a liquid at first, which issues forth in considerable quantities, and is gradually hardened [...] Our forefathers, too, were of opinion that it is the juice of a tree, and for this reason gave it the name of [...] "succinum" [...] and one great proof that it is the produce of a tree of the pine genus, {{is the fact that it}} emits a pine-like smell when rubbed, and that it burns, when ignited, with the odour and appearance of torch-pine wood.He also states that amber is also found in Egypt and in India, and he even refers to the electrostatic properties of amber, by saying that [...] "in Syria the women make the whorls of their spindles of this substance, and give it the name of harpax [...] from the circumstance that it attracts leaves towards it, chaff, and the light fringe of tissues." ...|$|E
