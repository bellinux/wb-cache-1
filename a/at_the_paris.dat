5|$|Born in Cologne, {{the son of}} {{a synagogue}} cantor, Offenbach showed early musical talent. At the age of 14, he was {{accepted}} as a student <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Paris</b> Conservatoire but found academic study unfulfilling and left after a year. From 1835 to 1855 he earned his living as a cellist, achieving international fame, and as a conductor. His ambition, however, was to compose comic pieces for the musical theatre. Finding the management of Paris' Opéra-Comique company uninterested in staging his works, in 1855 he leased a small theatre in the Champs-Élysées. There he presented a series of his own small-scale pieces, many of which became popular.|$|E
