Along with Bourne, Folley and Rodgers, the album featured Tollhurst (guest guitars, piano, mandolin and tipple), Cindy Boste (guest lead vocals), Sarah Carroll (guest lead vocals) and Skip Sail (guest banjo). In March 2003 Richard Sharman of I-94 Bar website reviewed Chris Wilson and The Spidermen's gig at the Bridge Hotel in Sydney, {{and found that}} Wilson's [...] "voice was magnificent ranging from soft tenderness to a bellowing roar that raised shivers <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> neck. His voice sounded better than ever and his harp playing was superb – this boy can play!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Roger Ebert {{awarded the}} film two-and-a-half stars out of four, writing: [...] "It is a well-directed film, because Besson has a natural gift for {{plunging}} into drama with a charged-up visual style. And {{it is well}} acted." [...] However, he was not entirely complimentary: [...] "Always <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mind was the troubled {{thought that there was}} something wrong about placing a 12-year-old character {{in the middle of this}} action. ... In what is essentially an exercise—a slick urban thriller—it seems to exploit the youth of the girl without really dealing with it." [...] The New York Times Janet Maslin wrote, [...] "The Professional is much too sentimental to sound shockingly amoral in the least. Even in a finale of extravagant violence, it manages to be maudlin … Mr. Oldman expresses most of the film's sadism as well as many of its misguidedly poetic sentiments." ...|$|E
2500|$|Woolf {{wrote about}} meeting Sackville-West in 1925: [...] "Vita shines in the grocer's shop in Sevenoaks...pink growing, grape clustered, pearl hung...There is her {{maturity}} and full-breastedness; her being so much full in sail {{on the high}} tides, where I am coasting down backwaters; her capacity I mean to take the floor in any company, to represent her country, to visit Chatsworth, to control silver, servants, chow dogs, her motherhood...her in short being (what I have never been) a real woman". [...] Sackville-West greatly admired Woolf's writings, declaring in a 1925 letter: [...] "My darling, last night I went to bed early and read Mrs. Dalloway-It was a very curious sensation: I thought {{you were in the}} room...I was very unhappy because I had a row with my mother and very happy because of you; so it felt like being two different people at the same time...I felt quite light, as though I was falling through my bed, like when one has a high fever. Today I am quite solid again and my boots are quite muddy. They weigh me down. Yet I am not solid as usual-not quite an oaf-because there is <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mind all the time...a glow, a sort of nebula, which only when I examine it hardens into a shape; as soon as I think of something else it dissolves again, remaining there like the sun through a fog and I have to reach out again, to take it into my hands & feel its contours: then it hardens, [...] "Virginia is coming on Saturday!". Sackville-West considered Woolf to be the better writer, telling Woolf in one letter: [...] "I contrast my illiterate writing with your scholarly one, and I am ashamed". Though Woolf envied Sackville-West's ability to quickly turn out books compared to her laborious efforts to turn out a novel, she was inclined to agree with this assessment, writing in her diary that A Passenger to Tehran was written too much in haste as [...] "Vita's prose is too fluent". Before going on her second trip to Persia in 1927, a chastened Sackville-West, after receiving several letters from Woolf telling her not to churn out books, wrote to Woolf: [...] "I shall work so hard , partly to please you and partly to please myself...I treasure your sudden discourse on literature yesterday morning, a send-off to me, rather like Polonius to Laertes. It is quite true that you have had infinitely more influence on me intellectually than anyone else, and for this alone, I love you...You do like me to write well, don't you? And I do hate writing badly-and having written so badly in the past. But now, like Queen Victoria, I will be good".|$|E
