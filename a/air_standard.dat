50|$|When {{high levels}} of {{dangerous}} lead contamination were recognized {{in the town of}} Herculaneum, Missouri in 2001, residents contacted the MCE, who began to monitor the situation in addition to smelter emissions. It was discovered that trucks carrying lead concentrate to the smelter were responsible for spreading the contaminants. The EPA then began to enforce the national lead <b>air</b> <b>standard,</b> which forced Doe Run, the smelter’s owner, to clean up the area and buy out the homes nearest the plant. In 2005, the Coalition won a 2004 lawsuit on behalf on two Herculaneum residents prompted by the EPA’s failure to review lead air pollution standards every five years as required by the Clean Air Act. The courts then ordered the EPA to conduct a decades-overdue review. The Coalition mobilized the children’s health community to ensure that the new standard was protective in order to counter industry lobbyists who pushed the EPA to remove the standard all together. During the review process, Kat Logan Smith, executive director of MCE, and Leslie Warden, a former Herculaneum resident, testified at the EPA’s clean air scientific advisory panel in North Carolina. The review resulted in a new standard that is ten times more protective than the one it replaced. It will go into effect between 2010 and 2013 and be emulated around the globe.|$|E
40|$|Background & Aims of the Study: Among {{different}} kinds of air pollutants, Particle matters due to their proved destructive impacts on human health and their various sources like transportation attract wide attention. The objective of this work is determining {{the real value of}} particle matters in one of the important and busy roads in Iran (Sari- Qaemshahr road). 						Materials & Methods: In this study, measurement and field analysis of particle matter (PM) pollution of Sari-Qaemshahr road (Iran), with high load of traffic, has been done during a 6 years period (2010 - 2015) and the results have been investigated by means of AQI and Iranian clean <b>air</b> <b>standard</b> indexes. Furthermore, the effect of pollutants on human health is discussed. 						Results: The results showed that particle matter pollution in study stations has an increasing upward trend. Comparison of measured particles with clean <b>air</b> <b>standard</b> expresses that the amount of particles is under the clean <b>air</b> <b>standard</b> limitation and it could not considered as a danger. However, comparison of PM with AQI index showed that the amount of the PM, except 2010, is in the range of very unhealthy and it shows a very poor condition. Considering its effects on human health, the increasing trend of these particles could become a concern for the society. 						Conclusions: This research reveals that the Iranian clean <b>air</b> <b>standard</b> needs a meticulous review in order to administer the emission of PM, using the results which are obtained from this study...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn inter-laboratory {{comparison}} exercise {{involving the}} environmental tracers used for groundwater dating was organized in 2012 in France. This paper focuses on SF 6 and CFC tracers. Sampling and analytical protocols were compared {{in three different}} exercises using: (1) groundwater from a homogeneous aquifer, (2) groundwater from a fractured heterogeneous aquifer and (3) an <b>air</b> <b>standard.</b> The results show good agreement between laboratories (except some outliers) for the aquifers and <b>air</b> <b>standard.</b> Variation in the SF 6 results on the <b>air</b> <b>standard</b> was low (RSD = 2 %) compared to CFCs (RSD 3 – 7 %), even though its concentration was two orders of magnitude lower. Results obtained on recent groundwater (recharged post 1980) show that the inter-laboratory uncertainty for groundwater dating with SF 6 is 3 – 4 years. This large uncertainty is mainly due to sampling and/or analytical problems. For CFCs, the uncertainties obtained from all laboratories were less than 2 years for groundwater recharged between 1965 and 1996. A higher RSD was observed for CFCs with the <b>air</b> <b>standard</b> analysis, as compared to groundwater measurement, which could indicate an additional uncertainty due to inadequate standardization. Different sampling protocols were used by the laboratories (glass bottles, steel cylinders, etc.) but no systematic effect on measurement uncertainty {{could be attributed to}} any of these protocols for either CFCs or SF 6. The better precisions obtained through these exercises indicate that, except for CFC- 11 and SF 6, the corresponding uncertainty in recharge date determination on recent groundwater (1993 – present) is higher than the commonly assumed 1 – 2 years (i. e., 7 years for CFC- 12 and 4 years for CFC- 113). These results confirm the need for regular inter-laboratory comparison exercises to improve the analytical and sampling procedures used in groundwater dating...|$|E
