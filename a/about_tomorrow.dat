2500|$|After the Brisbane show, Wheatley {{calculated}} that the crowd had paid $5 per ticket—so box office gross must {{have been at least}} $30,000–$35,000—yet his band, like all other acts, were on a fixed fee. They received $200 for the concert, and the top-billed act, Farnham, was paid about $1000. Wheatley realised that the promoters had pocketed the lion's share of the takings. As a result, the group decided to manage and book themselves and over the closing months of 1969 Wheatley became more involved in choosing venues, booking shows and promoting the group with care to avoid over-exposure, cutting down on appearances and increasing their fee. They closed the year with the bluesy single [...] "Think <b>About</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> Today", which provided another Top 20 hit nationally and went to No. 11 in Melbourne. It was later used by the Bank of New South Wales in its youth-oriented TV ads.|$|E
2500|$|The Masters Apprentices (or The Masters to fans) were an Australian pop/rock band fronted by Jim Keays on lead vocals, which {{formed in}} 1965 in Adelaide, South Australia, {{relocated}} to Melbourne in February 1967 {{and attempted to}} break into the United Kingdom market from 1970, before disbanding in 1972. Their popular Australian singles are [...] "Undecided", [...] "Living in a Child's Dream", [...] "5:10 Man", [...] "Think <b>About</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> Today", [...] "Turn Up Your Radio" [...] and [...] "Because I Love You". The band launched the career of bass guitarist, Glenn Wheatley, later a music industry entrepreneur and an artist talent manager for both Little River Band and John Farnham. The band reformed periodically, including in 1987–1988 and again subsequently; they were inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame in 1998 alongside The Angels. Both Keays, with His Master's Voice and Wheatley, with Paper Paradise, wrote memoirs in 1999 which included their experiences with the band.|$|E

Keays and Ford also co-wrote [...] "Quicksand" [...] {{which was}} issued as a single by Adelaide-based blues group, The Expression, in June 1970. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, {{declared}} that the track [...] "ranks {{as one of the}} most astonishing hard guitar/psychedelic singles of the period". Keays and Ford co-wrote [...] "St John's Wood" [...] (mid-1970) for Brisbane-formed group, The Sect, which had relocated to Melbourne in late 1969 and signed with the same booking agency. From July 1970 The Masters Apprentices had relocated to the United Kingdom where they tried to break into the local market but they disbanded in 1972 without achieving any UK charting.|$|E

40|$|Recent crises {{have seen}} very large spikes in asset price risk without {{dramatic}} shifts in fundamentals. We propose {{an explanation for}} these risk panics based on selfful filling shifts in risk {{made possible by a}} negative link between the current asset price and risk about the future asset price. This link implies that risk <b>about</b> <b>tomorrow’s</b> asset price depends on uncertainty <b>about</b> risk <b>tomorrow.</b> This dynamic mapping of risk into itself gives rise to the possibility of multiple equilibria and self-fulfilling shifts in risk. We show that this can generate risk panics. The impact of the panic is larger when the shift from a low to a high risk equilibrium takes place in an environment of weak fundamentals. The sharp increase in risk leads to a large drop in the asset price, decreased leverage and reduced market liquidity. We show that the model can account well for the developments during the recent financial crisis. Financial Panics, Sunspot-Like Equilibria...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{contrasts}} {{theories that}} explain diverse belief by asymmetric private information (in short PI) with theories which postulate agents use subjective heterogenous beliefs (in short HB). We focus on problems where agents forecast aggregates such as profit {{rate of the}} S&P 500 and our model {{is similar to the}} one used in the literature on asset pricing (e. g. Brown and Jennings (1989), Grundy and McNichols (1989), Allen, Morris and Shin (2003)). We first argue there is no a-priori conceptual basis to assuming PI about economic aggregates. Since PI is not observed, models with PI offer no testable hypotheses, making it possible to prove anything with PI. In contrast, agents with HB reveal their forecasts hence data on market belief is used to test hypotheses of HB. We show the common knowledge assumptions of the PI theory are implausible. The theories differ on four main analytical issues. (1) The pricing theory under PI implies prices have infinite memory and at each t depend upon unobservable variables. In contrast, under HB prices have finite memory and depend only upon observable variables. (2) The “Beauty Contest” implications of the two are different. Under PI today’s price depends upon today’s market belief <b>about</b> <b>tomorrow’s</b> mean belief <b>about</b> “fundamental ” variables. Under HB it depends upon today’s market belief <b>about</b> <b>tomorrow’s</b> market beliefs. Tomorrow’s beliefs are, in part, beliefs about future beliefs and are often mistaken. Market forecast mistakes are key to Beauty Contests, and are a central cause of market uncertainty called “endogenous uncertainty. ” (3) Contrary to PI, theories with HB have wide empirical implications which are testable with available data.
