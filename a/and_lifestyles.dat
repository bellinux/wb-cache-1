5|$|After humans {{migrated}} out {{of their}} ancestral environment of eastern Africa, they were exposed to new climates and challenges. Thus, Wade argues, human evolution did not end with behavioural modernity, but continued to be shaped by the different environments <b>and</b> <b>lifestyles</b> of each continent. While many adaptations happened in parallel across human populations, Wade believes that genetic isolation – either because of geography or hostile tribalism – also facilitated a degree of independent evolution, leading to genetic and cultural differentiation from the ancestral population and giving rise to different human races and languages.|$|E

5|$|The cornerstone, {{located at}} the {{northeast}} corner of the building, bears the dates 1872, the start of construction, and 1878, the year of completion. The stone was opened during ceremonies November 15, 1978, the centennial of the building's completion. Various documents enclosed within the stone had been damaged by moisture, although several coins from the era remained intact. Officials closed and resealed with stone with 38 new items depicting Michigan's history, people, <b>and</b> <b>lifestyles.</b> At the lawn's southeast corner is the Grand Army of the Republic Memorial, a 1924-bronze plaque attached to a boulder as a memorial to American Civil War veterans who fought for the Union.|$|E

Varma wanted to name the characters played by Nagarjuna and Raghuvaran as Bhavani and Siva respectively. At Nagarjuna's request, he reversed the names. Varma chose newcomers Chakravarthy, Jithendra, and Ramjagan to play J. D., Chinna, and Naresh after auditioning them at Annapurna Studios. Uttej, one of Varma's assistant directors, played a comic role of a server in the college canteen. He recommended Varma to cast Sushma for Keerthi's role.|$|E
5|$|Procellariids, as well {{as having}} strong natal philopatry, exhibit strong site fidelity, {{returning}} to the same nesting site, burrow or territory in sequential years. The figure varies for different species but is high for most species, an estimated 91% for Bulwer's petrels. The strength of this fidelity can also vary with sex; almost 85% of male Cory's shearwaters return to the same burrow to breed the year after a successful breeding attempt, while the figure for females is around 76%. This tendency towards using the same site {{from year to year}} is matched by strong mate fidelity, with birds breeding with the same partner for many years; in fact it is suggested that the two are linked, site fidelity being a means by which partnered birds could meet {{at the beginning of the}} breeding season. One pair of northern fulmars bred as a pair in the same site for 25 years. Like the albatrosses the procellariids take several years to reach sexual maturity, though due to the greater variety of sizes <b>and</b> <b>lifestyles,</b> the age of first breeding stretches from just three years in the smaller species to 12 years in the larger ones.|$|E

A survey was conducted using the Diagnostic Inventory of Health <b>and</b> <b>Lifestyle</b> Habits (DIHAL. 2) {{at the end of}} the class (July). Males were found to show significantly higher total scores for health level (p< 0. 01) <b>and</b> <b>lifestyle</b> habits (exercise, eating and resting) (p< 0. 01) than females. Likewise, they also had significantly higher total scores for exercise (p< 0. 001) and resting (p< 0. 05). A significant gender difference was also observed for a pattern classification of lifestyle (p< 0. 01); males showed a strong tendency for a fulfilling-type <b>lifestyle</b> <b>and</b> a <b>lifestyle</b> that requires care with regard to <b>lifestyle</b> habits, <b>and</b> little tendency for a lifestyle that requires care with regard to both health level <b>and</b> <b>lifestyle</b> habits, while few females showed a fulfilling-type <b>lifestyle</b> <b>and</b> instead showed a strong tendency for a lifestyle that requires care with regard to both health level <b>and</b> <b>lifestyle</b> habits.
