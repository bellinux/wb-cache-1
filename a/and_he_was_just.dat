She recalls of their encounter, [...] "He was so anti-drug when I met him. I {{mentioned}} to him that I smoked marijuana, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> appalled. He said, 'Don't ever do that again.'" [...] Presley was not only deeply opposed to recreational drugs, he also rarely drank. Several of his family members had been alcoholics, a fate he intended to avoid.|$|E
500|$|Dworsky was {{eventually}} told {{to stop working}} on the drawings before he completed them, but he defended himself against Gehry's criticism. [...] "Knowledgeable people were supportive of us. They were saying it's a very complex and unusual design, and they can understand the difficulties in trying to achieve this within a limited budget and a limited schedule. It was unfortunate that Frank came out with his criticism, {{but he was the}} center of the storm, having designed the building, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> trying to lessen the blame on himself." ...|$|E

500|$|In mid-1992, MC Serch, whose group 3rd Bass had dissolved, {{began working}} on a solo project and {{approached}} Nas. At the suggestion of producer T-Ray, Serch collaborated with Nas for [...] "Back to the Grill", the lead single for Serch's 1992 solo debut album Return of the Product. At the recording session for the song, Serch discovered that Nas {{did not have a}} recording contract and subsequently contacted Faith Newman, an A executive at Sony Music Entertainment. As Serch recounted, [...] "Nas was in a position where his demo had been sittin' around, 'Live at the Barbeque' was already a classic, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> tryin' to find a decent deal ... So when he gave me his demo, I shopped it around. I took it to Russell first, Russell said it sounded like G Rap, he wasn't wit' it. So I took it to Faith.

500|$|On May 9, Rentería {{was called}} up to the Marlins {{following}} an injury to shortstop Kurt Abbott. His first game came on May 10, in a 4–2 win over the Colorado Rockies, {{when he entered the}} game in the ninth inning as part of a double switch. He did not have any at bats in that game, though, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a backup infielder when he first came up because Alex Arias had replaced Abbott as the everyday shortstop. However, Rentería replaced Arias as the starting shortstop on May 19 against the Chicago Cubs. He got his first hit (a single) in his first at bat (against Steve Trachsel) in a 3–2 Marlins victory. He got four hits in a game {{for the first time on}} June 10 in a 5–2 win over the Montreal Expos. His first home run came the next day, off Ugueth Urbina of the Expos, in a 3–2 loss. Rentería did so well as a shortstop that the Marlins moved Abbott over to second base when he came off the disabled list. On June 23, Rentería strained a hamstring on a groundout in the sixth inning of a 5–3 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates. He was placed on the disabled list the next day, but he remained the starting shortstop when he returned on July 11. From July 25 to August 16 he had a 22-game hitting streak, which was the longest for a rookie since Jerome Walton of the Chicago Cubs had a thirty-game streak in [...] Rentería finished the season with a [...]309 batting average, 68 runs scored, and sixteen stolen bases in 106 games.

Fawaz described, in an interview with The Daily Telegraph, finding the performer on Christmas morning, [...] "I went round there to wake him up <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> gone, lying peacefully in bed.

2500|$|The team {{originally}} used American football commentators, but we {{were asked}} to make [...] "everything more British," [...] so they hired English actor Hugh Dennis to perform the voice of Ralph and ex-footballer Ray Wilkins to perform the voice of Tony; Robinson recalled that Dennis' [...] "Eddie Waring-esque commentary" [...] was deliberately intended to contrasted with the [...] "dry and amusing delivery" [...] of Wilkins. Actors that were intended for the role of the Tango drinker were passed over as they did not like the idea of being slapped; the role ultimately went to an actor whose identity has not been discussed.

2500|$|In 1459, Lê Nhân Tông's older brother, Nghi Dân, plotted with a {{group of}} {{followers}} to kill the Emperor. On October 28, the plotters with some 100 [...] "shiftless men" [...] infiltrated the palace and murdered the Emperor (he was just 18). The next day, facing certain execution the Dowager Empress committed suicide. The rule of Nghi Dân was brief, and he was never officially recognized as a sovereign by later Vietnamese historians. Revolts against his rule started almost immediately and the second revolt, occurring on June 24, 1460, succeeded. The rebels, led by the last of Lê Lợi's former advisors (Nguyễn Xí and Dinh Liêt), captured and killed Nghi Dân along with his followers. The rebels then selected the youngest son of Lê Thái Tông to be the new Emperor. His posthumous name is Lê Thánh Tông <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> 17 years old at the time.|$|E
2500|$|Craig Sheffer portrays Keith Scott, Dan's older, kinder, under-achieving brother. Sheffer {{said that}} {{characters}} like Keith {{are not the}} most enjoyable to play.

[...] "And that's a nice thing to play and come {{home at the end of}} the day. You don't bring too much with you. We had some good scenes within the framework of a simple character, so there was some of that stuff to play, but also a lot of cheesy stuff." [...] After Dan chose Deb rather than Karen, Keith helped Karen to raise Lucas and fell in love with her, but they only get together in season three. He had a recurring drinking problem and rivalry with his brother.|$|E

2500|$|The tour's {{rendition}} of [...] "Rope Burn" [...] was considered [...] "incredibly sexy" [...] and [...] "what everyone was talking about", becoming its most controversial performance. During the act, Jackson [...] "plucks a male fan {{out of the}} crowd and ties his hands to the arms of a chair on stage while she gyrates around him and eventually kisses him." [...] The selected fan was required to be strapped into the chair due to safety concerns from Jackson's previous tour, after the participant had forcefully grabbed and fondled her while onstage. Jackson said, [...] "Everyone thinks it's this kinky thing. But the reason he gets strapped in is on this last tour, this guy grabbed my crotch. I sat on his lap and then I stood up and he grabbed my crotch, and I was trying to move his hand and he was too strong for me <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> rubbing on my crotch.

A recurring theme of War and Peace is that certain events are just fated to happen, and there is nothing that a leader can do to challenge destiny, a view of history that dramatically discounts leadership as a factor in history. During the Soviet period, historians engaged in what Lieven called huge distortions to make history fit with Communist ideology, with Marshal Kutuzov and Prince Bagration transformed into peasant generals, Alexander I alternatively ignored or vilified, and the war becoming a massive [...] "People's War" [...] fought by the ordinary people of Russia with almost no involvement {{on the part of the}} government. During the Cold War, many Western historians were inclined to see Russia as [...] "the enemy", and there was a tendency to downplay and dismiss Russia's contributions to the defeat of Napoleon. As such, Napoleon's claim that the Russians did not defeat him <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> the victim of fate in 1812 was very appealing to many Western historians.|$|E
