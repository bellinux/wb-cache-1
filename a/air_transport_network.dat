This dynamic behavior not only characterizes {{the evolution of}} the system but also affect the system's functioning. Understanding the evolutionary mechanisms is thus fundamental in order to better design optimal <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> <b>networks</b> that benefits companies, passengers and the environment. In this review, we briefly present and discuss the state-of-art on time-evolving <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> <b>networks.</b> We distinguish the structural analysis of sequences of network snapshots, ideal for long-term network evolution (e. g. annual evolution), and temporal paths, preferred for short-term dynamics (e. g. hourly evolution). We emphasize that most previous research focused on the first modeling approach (i. e. long-term) whereas only a few studies look at high-resolution temporal paths. We conclude the review highlighting that much research remains to be done, both to apply already available methods and to develop new measures for temporal paths on <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> <b>networks.</b> In particular, we identify that the study of delays, network resilience and optimization of resources (aircraft and crew) are critical topics that can benefit of temporal network analysis.

A journey such as one from Lilabari (North Lakhimpur) in Assam state to Ziro in the neighbouring state of Arunachal Pradesh could take a few days during inclement weather, braving hazards such as avalanches in the hills and flooding in lower lying areas. The flight, on the other hand was as short as 12 minutes, though weather could cause disruptions because this was flying where visual contact had to be maintained with the ground/terrain in the absence of reliable aids for navigation. The weather caused poor visibility on account of heavy rains and low clouds and/or fog and could at times result in waterlogged runways. Many runways were unpaved or dirt strips and facilities at these airports were very limited.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAir {{transport}} network, or airport network, is {{a complex}} network involving numerous airports. Effective management of the air transport system requires an in-depth understanding of the roles of airports in the network. Whereas knowledge on <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> properties has been improved greatly, methods to find critical airports in the network are still lacking. In this paper, we present methods to investigate network properties and to identify critical airports in the network. A novel network model is proposed with airports as nodes and the correlations between traffic flow of airports as edges. Spectral clustering algorithm is developed to classify airports. Spatial distribution characteristics and intraclass correlation of different categories of airports are carefully analyzed. The analyses based on the fluctuation trend of distance-correlation and power spectrum of time series are performed to examine the self-organized criticality of the network. The results indicate {{that there is one}} category of airports which dominates the self-organized critical state of the network. Six airports in this category are found {{to be the most important}} ones in the Chinese <b>air</b> <b>transport</b> <b>network.</b> The flights delay occurred in these six airports can propagate to the other airports, having huge impact on the operation characteristics of the entire network.
