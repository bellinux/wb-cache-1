5|$|At the 500hPa level, the air {{temperature}} averages −7°C (18°F) within the tropics, but {{air in the}} tropics is normally dry at this level, giving the air room to wet-bulb, or cool as it moistens, to <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>favorable</b> temperature that can then support convection. A wetbulb temperature at 500hPa in a tropical atmosphere of −13.2°C is required to initiate convection if the water temperature is 26.5°C, and this temperature requirement increases or decreases proportionally by 1°C in the sea surface temperature for each 1°C change at 500hpa.|$|E

5|$|An upper-level {{anticyclone}} {{north of}} the system provided <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>favorable</b> environment for organization, allowing the convection to organize into banding features. The system also developed good outflow, though initially the surface circulation was too elongated {{for it to be}} considered a tropical cyclone. Early on June3, the nearby anticyclone moved northeastward, which increased wind shear over the system and caused it briefly to become less-organized. However, convection increased over the center, and at 1500UTC on June3 the NHC classified the system as Tropical Depression Two-E about 140mi (240km) southwest of Zihuatanejo, Guerrero; the upgrade was due to the system developing sufficiently organized convection, as well as a closed surface circulation.|$|E

5|$|After {{reaching}} peak winds, Tropical Storm Chantal became disorganized {{while the}} center became ill-defined and situated to the west-southwest {{of the main}} area of convection; {{this was due to}} unfavorable upper-level winds, although computer models continued to forecast <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>favorable</b> upper-level environment. By early on August20, Hurricane Hunters reported several low-level circulations embedded within a large low pressure area. Later that day, wind shear decreased when the storm moved into the Gulf of Honduras. Chantal became much better organized, again reaching peak winds of 70miles per hour (110km/h) before making landfall early on August21 near the border of Mexico and Belize. Initially, the storm was forecast to cross the Yucatán Peninsula and Bay of Campeche and make a second landfall in the state of Veracruz. Chantal slowly weakened over land while moving slowly across northern Belize. Convection decreased markedly late on August21, and early the next day Chantal weakened to tropical depression status. The upper- and middle-level circulations turned to the northeast while the low-level circulation turned to the west-southwest further inland. Weakening continued, and late on August22 Chantal dissipated over the Mexican state of Tabasco.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{sequence}} of Cabo Verde hurricanes, Lisa began as a tropical wave that developed into a tropical depression by 18:00UTC on September20, about 460mi (740km) southwest of Cabo Verde. An unusually weak subtropical ridge steered the system north, east, and north again over subsequent days. The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Lisa six hours after formation, but fell back to tropical depression intensity by 18:00UTC on September22 as dry air entered the circulation. <b>A</b> <b>more</b> <b>favorable</b> environment allowed Lisa to re-attain tropical storm status by 12:00UTC the following day and subsequently begin a period of rapid intensification; it reached hurricane intensity by 21:00UTC on September24 and reached peak winds of 85mph (140km/h) six hours later. Progressively cooler waters and stronger shear caused Lisa to weaken to a tropical storm early on September25, weaken to a tropical depression early on September26, and degenerate into a remnant low at 18:00UTC that day. The remnant low moved northwest and north, dissipating by 06:00UTC on September29 about 595mi (960km) south-southwest of the Azores.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Carlos was {{an unusually}} small {{tropical}} cyclone which affected the western coast of Mexico in June2015. Forming {{as the third}} named storm and hurricane of the annual hurricane season, Carlos developed from a trough first noted by the National Hurricane Center on June7. The disturbance gradually organized and was designated as a tropical depression three days later while south of the Mexican Pacific coast. Drifting slowly northwestward, the depression was upgraded further to a tropical storm. Although persistent wind shear and dry air hampered intensification early on, Carlos strengthened into a hurricane on June13 after moving into <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>favorable</b> environment. However, the return of dry air and upwelling of cooler waters caused the system to deteriorate into a tropical storm. Paralleling the Mexican coast, Carlos later regained hurricane intensity on June15 and attained peak winds of 90mph (150km/h) a day later. The reprieve was brief, however, as the onset of wind shear, land interaction, and dry air afterward led to rapid weakening. On June17, Carlos degenerated into a remnant area of low pressure, having made landfall in Jalisco earlier that day. By the morning of June18, Carlos was declared to have completely dissipated.|$|E

5|$|On June 20, Jaws opened across North America on 464 screens—409 in the United States, the {{remainder}} in Canada.

5|$|The {{first two}} moons to be {{discovered}} were Titania and Oberon, which were spotted by Sir William Herschel on January 11, 1787, six years after he had discovered the planet itself. Later, Herschel thought he had discovered up to six moons (see below) and perhaps even a ring. For nearly 50years, Herschel's instrument {{was the only one}} with which the moons had been seen. In the 1840s, better instruments and <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>favorable</b> position of Uranus in the sky led to sporadic indications of satellites additional to Titania and Oberon. Eventually, the next two moons, Ariel and Umbriel, were discovered by William Lassell in 1851. The Roman numbering scheme of Uranus's moons {{was in a state of}} flux for a considerable time, and publications hesitated between Herschel's designations (where Titania and Oberon are Uranus II and IV) and William Lassell's (where they are sometimes I and II). With the confirmation of Ariel and Umbriel, Lassell numbered the moons I through IV from Uranus outward, and this finally stuck. In 1852, Herschel's son John Herschel gave the four then-known moons their names.|$|E
5|$|The glass forms include {{borosilicate}} {{glasses and}} phosphate glasses. Borosilicate nuclear waste glasses are used on an industrial scale to immobilize high level radioactive waste {{in many countries}} which are producers of nuclear energy or have nuclear weaponry. The glass waste forms {{have the advantage of}} being able to accommodate a wide variety of waste-stream compositions, they are easy to scale up to industrial processing, and they are stable against thermal, radiative, and chemical perturbations. These glasses function by binding radioactive elements to nonradioactive glass-forming elements. Phosphate glasses while not being used industrially have much lower dissolution rates than borosilicate glasses, which make them <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>favorable</b> option. However, no single phosphate material has the ability to accommodate all of the radioactive products so phosphate storage requires more reprocessing to separate the waste into distinct fractions. Both glasses have to be processed at elevated temperatures making them unusable for some of the more volatile radiotoxic elements.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{organized}} into a tropical cyclone in the Andaman Sea, {{the origins of}} the 1999Odisha cyclone {{can be traced back to}} an area of convection that began developing in the Sulu Sea on October21. Despite some signs of development, wind shear suppressed outflow and prevented any significant organization. Tracking westward, the disturbance encountered <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>favorable</b> environment in the South China Sea; as a result, thunderstorm activity began to increase. Prompted by these changes, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) at 02:00UTC on 23October. However, the system failed to develop any further before wind shear reemerged in the Gulf of Thailand, causing convection to diminish and resulting in the cancellation of the TCFA. On 24October, the storm crossed the Malay Peninsula and moved into the Andaman Sea by 03:00UTC the following day. Although the environment remained moderately unfavorable for tropical cyclogenesis, the disturbance organized, developing fair outflow, a strong rainband, and additional convection. At 06:00UTC on 25October, the system became a tropical depression while centered 550km (340mi) east of Port Blair. As such, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) designated the system as BOB03. With the storm now steadily organizing, the JTWC once again issued a TCFA at 19:30UTC on 25October; early the following day, the IMD assessed that the nascent depression had strengthened into a cyclonic storm. At the time, the storm was located 325km (200mi) south-southeast of Rangoon, Myanmar.|$|E
5|$|In late September, a {{large area}} of {{disturbed}} weather associated with two tropical waves formed {{just east of the}} Lesser Antilles. The disturbance drifted very slowly west-northwestward, inhibited by strong wind shear that eventually caused the westernmost wave to dissipate. Albeit weak, an elongated remnant trough, or area of low pressure, persisted for several days, stalling over the extreme eastern Caribbean Sea as a nearby upper-level cyclonic vortex retrograded to its north. By October5, the trough had drifted northward into <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>favorable</b> atmospheric environment over the Virgin Islands, which allowed the lowest pressures to extend to the surface. The low became well defined, interacting with the adjacent upper vortex to produce a wide convective banda concentrated region in which strong showers and thunderstorms can formover the northeastern Caribbean. Over the next day, the system continued to acquire a prominent subtropical structure: it developed a markedly larger wind radius than typically seen in pure tropical cyclones. Satellite observations also revealed that although the lower wind circulation was distinct, it had become intertwined with the cyclonic vortex aloft to its southwest, confirming the hybrid nature of the system. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) thus classified the system as a subtropical depression at 06:00UTC on October6, when it was 265mi (425km) north-northwest of San Juan, Puerto Rico.|$|E
5|$|Other historians, {{including}} Wilhelm Mommsen and Arthur Rosenberg, {{oppose the}} idea that Frederick could have, or would have, liberalized Germany. They believe {{that he would not}} have dared to oppose both his father and Bismarck to change Germany's course; a natural soldier, he was steeped in his family's strong military tradition, and had happily reported to his father since he joined the army at the age of ten. Andreas Dorpalen notes that Frederick had complied with most of William's and Bismarck's policies early in his life, and would have been unlikely to change his behaviour. According to Arthur Rosenberg, despite his liberal tendencies Frederick still firmly believed in Bismarck and his system, with Dorpalen adding that in any case Frederick had too weak and ineffectual a character to have brought about real change, regardless of how long he reigned. James J. Sheehan states that the political climate and party system of Germany during that period were too steeped in the old ways for Frederick to overcome with liberalization. Dorpalen also observes that Frederick's liberal persona may have been exaggerated after his death, to keep the liberal movement strong in Germany, and he points out that the many mistakes made by Wilhelm II helped to paint his father in <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>favorable</b> light.|$|E
