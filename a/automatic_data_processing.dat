Automation of such apparatus allows to improve the precision of measurements and facilitate interpretation of results. Bases of method. One of problems is influence of external radiations on the object of researches. Such radiation arises up at transformation of output signals of the radiometric system {{in time to the}} transmission of them in the device of the <b>data</b> <b>processing.</b> The decision of problem, offered in the article, consists in pre-processing of signals through in a digital integrator and post-processing in a computer. The offered method and his enginneering realization provide the <b>automatic</b> measuring <b>data</b> <b>processing,</b> and can be used for design of the complex systems: panoramic radiometers, multichannel correlators, and other ? for the analysis of the low-intensity noise signals.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 92) A {{test station}} {{was designed and}} constructed to automatically measure the direction finding accuracy and angular coverage of a antenna/receiver assembly. One operator utilizing the station can collect and analyze over 38, 000 data points in 11 hours. The test station is comprised of four modules and a anechoic chamber. The anechoic chamber provides a controlled test environment while the modules perform specific functions at the station. The four modules include the Computer, Control, Source, and Positioner Modules. The Computer Module interfaces with the other three modules and performs the <b>automatic</b> control and <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> for the test station. Automatic positioner control, manual positioner control, and manual antenna pattern measurements are provided by the Control Module. The Source Module radiates a continuous or pulsed electromagnetic wave from the tapered end of the anechoic chamber. Finally, the Positioner Module provides the measurement interface between the test station and the antenna/receiver assembly under test. The execution of <b>automatic</b> control and <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> at the test station is determined by a computer program written to comply wth specific test requirements.
