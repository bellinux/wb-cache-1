40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: Evaluation of a {{protocol}} of activation-deactivation of <b>alarm</b> <b>soundings</b> on noninvasive {{mean arterial pressure}} (MAP) monitoring. Materials and methods: 103 patients were analyzed. <b>Alarm</b> <b>soundings</b> on noninvasive MAP were either activated (group A) or inactivated (group NA) according to {{a protocol}} based on patient's hemodynamic status. RESULTS: In {{the first part of}} the study (11 periods of 24 hours), we informed the nursing staff before data collection. In the second part of the study (11 periods of 24 hours), we did not inform the nursing staff before data collection. Results of the two parts were assembled and the final analysis consisted of 3, 304 hours of monitoring with 12, 839 noninvasive MAP measurements, 6, 354 in group A and 6, 485 in group NA. In group A, 75 of 944 (8 %) of abnormal measurements were detected or managed with a delay > 15 minutes and among them 16 required a therapeutic adjustment. In group NA, 140 of 265 (53 %) of abnormal measurements were detected or managed with a delay > 15 minutes and among them, only one required a therapeutic adjustment. The number of <b>alarm</b> <b>soundings</b> avoided in group NA was 286. CONCLUSION: In this study, a systematic activation of <b>alarm</b> <b>soundings</b> for non-invasive blood pressure monitoring seemed unnecessary for the safety of ICU patients...|$|R

50|$|In October 2013, Nest {{announced}} its second product, the Nest Protect smoke and carbon monoxide detector. The Nest Protect {{is available in}} {{both black and white}} (the black is exclusively sold through Nest directly) and also comes in battery or AC-powered models. The Nest Protect features a multicolored light ring which is color-coded to indicate different operations, such as yellow to indicate an early warning or red if an <b>alarm</b> is <b>sounding.</b> The ring also has a motion detector which turns it white briefly when someone passes under to provide illumination. The Nest Protect is voice-activated and warns of an <b>alarm</b> <b>sounding</b> briefly before it does. It is also able to communicate with the Nest Thermostat to provide the Auto-Away feature information that someone is present in the house, as well as to shut off the furnace {{in the event of a}} fire or carbon monoxide. The Nest Protect also features a controversial Wave Silence feature to stop an <b>alarm</b> from <b>sounding</b> with a wave in the event of a potential false alarm. It is available for sale in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Belgium, France, Ireland and the Netherlands.|$|R
