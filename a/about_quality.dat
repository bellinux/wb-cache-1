It was started in 1966, as a typical [...] "hobby zine", and despite some popularity soon threatened to go under. However, Jim Dunnigan bought the ailing magazine, and restructured his own company (then known as Poultron Press) to publish it, creating Simulations Publications, Inc. (SPI). An aggressive advertising campaign, and a new policy of including a new game in every issue, allowed S to find a much larger market, and SPI to become a company known to all wargamers as having a line of games that surpassed Avalon Hill's (at least, in numbers—arguments <b>about</b> <b>quality</b> raged).|$|E

2500|$|Ford Motor Company {{was one of}} {{the first}} American {{corporations}} to seek help from Deming. In 1981, Ford's sales were falling. Between 1979 and 1982, Ford had incurred $3 billion in losses. Ford's newly appointed Corporate Quality Director, Larry Moore, was charged with recruiting Deming to help jump-start a quality movement at Ford. Deming questioned the company's culture and the way its managers operated. To Ford's surprise, Deming talked not <b>about</b> <b>quality,</b> but about management. He told Ford that management actions were responsible for 85 percent of all problems in developing better cars. In 1986, Ford came out with a profitable line of cars, the Taurus-Sable line. In a letter to Autoweek Magazine, Donald Petersen, then Ford chairman, said, [...] "We are moving toward building a quality culture at Ford and the many changes that have been taking place here have their roots directly in Deming's teachings." [...] By 1986, Ford had become the most profitable American auto company. For the first time since the 1920s, its earnings had exceeded those of archrival General Motors (GM). Ford had come to lead the American automobile industry in improvements. Ford's following years' earnings confirmed that its success was not a fluke, for its earnings continued to exceed GM and Chrysler's.|$|E
2500|$|He is a Senior Visiting Fellow at the King's Fund. In 2014, he was {{the lead}} author of the keynote Kings Fund Paper [...] "Making Health and Care Systems fit for an Ageing Population".

He has campaigned on [...] {{discrimination}} against older people [...] in the British National Health Service, against the attitude being that the person is old and there is nothing that can be done about it. He challenges plans for large reductions in older people in acute hospitals, saying it is [...] "absolute la la land to think we’re going to be in a situation any time soon where older people don’t still keep piling through the doors of general hospitals." [...] He has also written about the need to focus more on healthy ageing, [...] to make health and care professionals better trained in the care of older people. He has criticised the large NHS spend on management consultancy [...] and pushed the case for NHS staff to learn more from other organisations within the NHS, criticised the idea that more aggressive regulation and inspection and [...] "accountability" [...] can bring <b>about</b> <b>quality</b> improvement in services [...] and attacked contestible but prevalent [...] "groupthink" [...] and oft repeated [...] "factoids" [...] from the health policy [...] "commentariat" [...] and made the case for improving the care for older people in nursing homes rather than pretending no-one will ever need or want to be admitted to one.|$|E

2500|$|While when a {{contract}} is silent a court must essentially {{make an informed}} choice about whether a right to terminate should exist, if {{a contract}} deals with the matter the courts' general approach is to follow the parties' wishes. The drafters of the old Sale of Goods Act 1893 distinguished between [...] "conditions" [...] (major terms, which when breached confer a right to terminate) and [...] "warranties" [...] (minor terms, which do not), and under the present Sale of Goods Act 1979 some terms, such as descriptions <b>about</b> <b>quality,</b> are conditions by default. A third kind is an [...] "innominate term", which is typically a vague term like citrus pulp pellets being [...] "in good condition", or a ship having to be [...] "seaworthy". Because such a term could be breached in both a major way (e.g. the ship sinks) or a trivial way (e.g. a lifejacket is missing) the court will determine whether the right to terminate arises based on how serious in fact {{the consequences of the}} breach were. So in The Hong Kong Fir, Lord Diplock held that a ship crew being too incompetent to properly operate the vessel did not breach the contract's [...] "seaworthiness" [...] term in a serious enough way as to allow for termination, because the charterers still got a working boat and could have replaced the crew. If a contract specifies that a particular obligation is a [...] "condition" [...] the dominant approach of the courts is to treat it as such. Nevertheless, concerned with the ability of a stronger party to specify the terms it finds most convenient as [...] "conditions" [...] {{at the expense of the}} weaker, courts retain the ability to construe an agreement contra proferentum. In L Schuler AG v Wickman Machine Tool Sales Ltd the majority of the House of Lords held that clause 7 of a contract, stating it was [...] "a condition of this agreement" [...] that Mr Wickman would visit 6 major car companies [...] "at least once in every week" [...] to try selling panel presses, was not really a condition in the technical sense. So when Mr Wickman was found to have visited much less, Schuler AG could not dismiss him. This was because clause 11 said that 60 days of warning was needed before Schuler AG could terminate, so the whole contract read together meant the clause 7 had to be subject to clause 11. The language in the contract is not decisive. If the word [...] "condition" [...] is not used, but the contract describes a right to terminate, such as the contract being terminable for [...] "any breach" [...] of obligation, the issue is, again, one of construction and the courts may be reluctant to give effect to the plain meaning if it would have [...] "draconian consequences" [...] for the weaker party. By contrast, in Bunge Corporation v Tradax SA the House of Lords held that giving notice for a ship to start loading the soya bean cargo four days late, when the contract expressly stipulated the date, should allow the right to terminate regardless of the actual consequences of the breach. In mercantile contracts, 'broadly speaking time will be considered of the essence', and so it is highly likely the courts will enforce obligations to the letter.|$|E

40|$|There is a {{great deal}} of talk about a crisis in {{teaching}} across the Englishspeaking world, <b>about</b> the <b>quality</b> of teachers leaving much to be desired, and <b>about</b> the <b>quality</b> of student outcomes dropping.

Much of the literature in this regard emanates primarily from the US, and England and Wales, and to a lesser extent from Australia and New Zealand. While the criticisms voiced may well be valid for these contexts, one would still not be justified in uncritically generalising from them to the rest of the English-speaking world.
