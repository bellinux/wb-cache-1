5|$|At {{the four}} corners of the wall sit towers (E) with {{intricate}} roofs boasting 72 ridges, reproducing the Pavilion of Prince Teng and the Yellow Crane Pavilion <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>appeared</b> in Song dynasty paintings. These towers are the most visible parts of the palace to commoners outside the walls, and much folklore is attached to them. According to one legend, artisans could not put a corner tower back together after it was dismantled for renovations in the early Qing dynasty, and it was only rebuilt after the intervention of carpenter-immortal Lu Ban.|$|E
5|$|Motul de San José {{has been}} {{identified}} as the source of Ik-style polychrome ceramics bearing painted scenes of the Late Classic Maya aristocracy involved in a variety of courtly activities. The Ik-style was characterised by hieroglyphs painted in a pink or pale red colour, scenes with dancers wearing masks, and the realistic representation of subjects <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>appeared</b> in life. The city was the capital of a polity that included various satellite sites of varying importance, including a port on the shore of Lake Petén Itzá.|$|E

5|$|Receiving {{light and}} other signals from distant astronomical sources can even take much longer. For example, {{it has taken}} 13billion (13) years for light to travel to Earth from the faraway galaxies viewed in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field images. Those photographs, taken today, capture images of the galaxies <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>appeared</b> 13billion years ago, when the {{universe}} was less than a billion years old. The fact that more distant objects appear to be younger, due to the finite speed of light, allows astronomers to infer the evolution of stars, of galaxies, and of the universe itself.|$|E
5|$|One analyst {{reasoned}} the {{recurrence of}} lesbian chic {{was due to}} the often-used homoerotic subtexts of gay male subculture being considered off limits because of AIDS in the late 1980s and 1990s, joined with the distant memory of lesbians <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>appeared</b> in the 1970s: unattractive and militant. In short, lesbians became more attractive to general audiences when they ceased having political convictions. All the attention on feminine and glamorous women created what culture analyst Rodger Streitmatter characterizes as an unrealistic image of lesbians packaged by heterosexual men; the trend influenced an increase in the inclusion of lesbian material in pornography aimed at men.|$|E
5|$|The Ik-style ceramic corpus {{includes}} {{a set of}} features such as hieroglyphs painted in a pink or pale red colour and scenes with dancers wearing masks. One of the most distinctive features is the realistic representation of subjects <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>appeared</b> in life, {{something that is very}} rare in Mesoamerican art. The corpus is represented by more than 30 intact vessels, the majority of unknown provenance, which have been compared to ceramic fragments recovered from Motul de San José and its satellite sites. The subject matter of the vessels includes courtly life from the Petén region in the 8th century AD, such as diplomatic representations, feasting, bloodletting, scenes of warriors and the sacrifice of prisoners of war.|$|E

25|$|Geneticists have {{identified}} more than 300 genetic loci and 150 genes associated with coat color variability. Knowing the mutations associated with different colors has allowed some {{correlation between the}} timing of the appearance of variable coat colors in horses with {{the timing of the}}ir domestication. Other studies have shown how human-induced selection is responsible for the allelic variation in pigs. Together, these insights suggest that, although natural selection has kept variation to a minimum before domestication, humans have actively selected for novel coat colors as soon <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>appeared</b> in managed populations.|$|E
25|$|On March 26, 2008, in Siegel v. Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc., 542 F. Supp. 2d 1098, 1145 (C.D. Cal. 2008), Judge Larson ruled {{again that}} the Superboy {{character}} was not a work for hire. Larson also held that the 2001 settlement documents did not constitute a contract terminating the Siegel heirs' claim to the Superman and Superboy works. The Siegels regained the copyright to the Superman character, story, and indicia <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>appeared</b> in Action Comics #1 (but not prior to or after that). Judge Larson later expanded his ruling to allow the Siegel heirs to claim additional plots, Superman characters, costuming, and indicia.|$|E

25|$|The {{defeat of}} the crusaders allowed Kilij Arslan to {{establish}} his capital at Konya, and also proved to the Muslim world that the crusaders were not invincible, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>appeared</b> to be during the First Crusade. The crusaders and Byzantines each blamed the other for the defeat, and neither of them were able to ensure a safe route through Anatolia now that Kilij Arslan had strengthened his position. The only open route to the Holy Land was the sea route, which benefitted the Italian maritime republics. The lack of a safe land route from Constantinople also benefitted the Principality of Antioch, where Tancred, ruling for his uncle Bohemond, was able to consolidate his power without Byzantine interference.|$|E
25|$|After their Defeat the Rebels {{retired to}} the Isle aux Noix, where they {{continued}} till lately, sending out some Parties, and many Emissaries, to debauch the Minds of the Canadians and Indians, {{in which they}} have proved too successful, and for which they were too well prepared by the Cabals and Intrigues of these two last years; We knew of their being reinforced, and very considerably, I suppose, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>appeared</b> in Numbers near St. John's last Sunday Evening; where or when they landed, or the Particulars since, we have but very imperfect Accounts of, all Communications with the Forts of St. John's and Chambli, being, as far as I can find, entirely cut off.|$|E
25|$|On 28 April, when Cockburn {{learned of}} stores of flour and {{military}} equipment at French Town on the Elk River, he embarked in Fantome and took Mohawk, Dolphin, Racer and Highflyer up the river. At 11 p.m. 150 marines and five artillery men left in boats {{to destroy the}} stores, with Lieutenant Lewis following in Highflyer as support. Unfortunately they were diverted into the Bohemia River and it was after 8 a.m. before they reached their destination {{only to discover that}} the Americans had erected a six-gun battery. The battery fired on the boats as soon <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>appeared,</b> but the boats' carronades soon silenced it. The British burned stores, which consisted mainly of cavalry equipment, and five vessels.|$|E

25|$|Following the 5 May attack, the Mission and its {{garrison}} remained {{under constant}} {{fire from the}} Jong. The Tibetans' weapons may have been inefficient and primitive but they kept up a constant pressure and fatalities were an irregular but nagging reality; a fatality on 6 May was followed by another eleven in the seven weeks after the surprise attack on Changlo Manor. The garrison responded with its own attacks; some of the Mounted Infantry returned from Karo La, armed with new standard-issue Lee–Enfield rifles, and pursued Tibetan horsemen, {{and one of the}} Maxims was stationed on the roof and short bursts of machine-gun fire met targets <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>appeared</b> {{on the walls of the}} Jong.|$|E
25|$|From the outset, {{money market}} funds fell under the {{jurisdiction}} of the SEC <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>appeared</b> to be more like investments (most similar to traditional stocks and bonds) vs. deposits and loans (cash and cash equivalents the domain of the bankers). Although {{money market funds}} are quite close to and are often accounted for as cash equivalents their main regulator, the SEC, has zero mandate to control the supply of money, limit the overall extension of credit, mitigate against boom and bust cycles, etc. The SEC’s focus remains on adequate disclosure of risk, and honesty and integrity in financial reporting and trading markets. After adequate disclosure, the SEC adopts a hands off, let the buyer beware attitude.|$|E
25|$|As {{suddenly}} <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>appeared,</b> {{the tourists}} vanish. The fugitive {{returns to the}} museum to investigate and finds no evidence of people being there during his absence. He attributes the experience to a hallucination caused by food poisoning, but the tourists reappear that night. They {{have come out of}} nowhere and yet they talk as if they have been there for a while. He watches them closely while still avoiding direct contact and notices more strange things. In the aquarium he encounters identical copies of the dead fish he found on his day of arrival. During a day at the pool, he sees the tourists jump to shake off the cold when the heat is unbearable. The strangest thing he notices is the presence of two suns and two moons in the sky.|$|E
