5|$|Cirrus clouds, like {{cirrostratus}} clouds, {{can produce}} several optical effects, such as halos {{around the sun}} and moon.

Common halo varieties are the 22Â° halo, sun dogs, the circumzenithal arc and the circumhorizontal arc (also known as fire rainbows).

5|$|A {{medium-sized}} gray bat, Myotis escalerai {{is similar}} to Myotis nattereri. The fur is long and soft; with a brown tone on the back, and the brighter underparts approaching white. The feet are dark gray. Much of the face is pink, and the muzzle is pointed, with long hairs on the upper lip resembling a moustache. The long ears are brown to gray. The tragus, a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear, is long and reaches {{to the middle of the}} ear <b>and</b> <b>colored</b> gray to yellow, becoming darker from the base towards the tip. According to several authors, it differs from M.nattereri in showing a distinct fringe of hairs on the tail membrane, but bat specialist A.M. Hutson writes that this feature does not distinguish the two species. In addition, the presence of an S-shaped spur on the uropatagium (membrane between the hind legs), which approaches the middle of the membrane, is a distinctive feature of this species. With its broad wings, low flight, and rapid wingbeats, the species is capable of precise, agile flight.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} decoration was extraordinarily rich. The walls were decorated with marble, {{the roof was}} gilded, while the narthex featured a depiction of the baptism of Constantine the Great. Fragments of ivory, amethyst, gold <b>and</b> <b>colored</b> glass, originally inlaid in the marble sculptures, have also been found at the site, as well as fragments of mosaics. The deliberate evocation of the Solomonic Temple was further reinforced by the preponderance of motifs such as palm trees, pomegranates and lilies in the church's decoration. A notable characteristic, {{which has not been}} attested before in Constantinopolitan art and architecture, is the extensive use of Sassanid Persian decorative motifs such as friezes of running palmette and pomegranate leaves or symmetric geometric and vegetal patterns. Persian motifs became increasingly popular in the 6th century, and were also used in the decoration of the Hagia Sophia. Another exceptional find are ten relief plaques bearing the images of Christ, the Virgin Mary and the Apostles; such images are very rare due to the destruction of human representations in the Iconoclasm of the 8th and 9th centuries.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: When {{examining}} the shape <b>and</b> <b>color</b> {{for a new}} product in an initial process of industrial design, they should be suitable for the productâs functionality, targeted image and concept. Additionally, it is also important that the shape <b>and</b> <b>color</b> differ from those of existing products so that the new design is distinctive to attract consumer attention. To support designers in their endeavor to come up with new designs, we propose a computerized method of analyzing existing designs and searching for a possible usage of shape <b>and</b> <b>color</b> different from the existing designs. First, we mathematically define feature indices to represent and quantify shape <b>and</b> <b>color</b> characteristics of designs. Then, we analyze the usage of shape <b>and</b> <b>color</b> in existing designs, which are obtained as 3 D CAD data or 3 D shape data scanned from real products, by calculating the feature indices of the designs. By plotting the calculated results as a vector in shape <b>and</b> <b>color</b> feature indices space, we obtain the distribution of shape <b>and</b> <b>color</b> usages of the existing designs. Here, we assume that the distance between the two vectors in the space represents the difference in shape <b>and</b> <b>color</b> usages of the two designs. Based on the assumption, we search for a possible new shape <b>and</b> <b>color</b> usage by searching for a new vector in the space which is as far from any of the existing vectors as possible. Once such a new vector is obtained, we visualize the suggested usage of shape <b>and</b> <b>color</b> by generating 3 D polygon model examples with the feature indices quantified by the vector. We examine the efficacy and feasibility of the proposed idea by implementing it as a computer program and applying it to designs of &quot;card stands &quot; as simple actual product examples...|$|R
