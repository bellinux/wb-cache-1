5|$|As far as Westmoreland was concerned, however, <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> to {{know was}} that the NVA had massed large numbers of troops for a set-piece battle. Making the {{prospect}} even more enticing was that the base was in an unpopulated area where American firepower could be fully employed without civilian casualties. The opportunity to engage and destroy a formerly elusive enemy that was moving toward a fixed position promised a victory of unprecedented proportions.|$|E

5|$|James B. Conant, the {{chairman}} of the NDRC and the S-1 Executive Committee, was concerned that the navy was running its own nuclear project, but Bush felt that it did no harm. He met with Gunn at Anacostia on 14 January 1943, and explained the situation to him. Gunn responded that the navy was interested in nuclear marine propulsion for nuclear submarines. Liquid thermal diffusion was a viable means of producing enriched uranium, and <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> was details about nuclear reactor design, which he knew was being pursued by the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. He was unaware that the it had already built Chicago Pile-1, a working nuclear reactor. Bush was unwilling to provide the requested data, but arranged with Rear Admiral William R. Purnell, a fellow member of the Military Policy Committee that ran the Manhattan Project, for Abelson's efforts to receive additional support.|$|E

There, Zobek appears before Gabriel with the Devil Mask over his face, and divulges that he is the Lord of the Necromancers and that he grew tired of the Lords of Shadow {{dividing}} the power amongst the three of them. Orchestrating the events of the story, he searched Hell for this power until an evil force entered him and expanded his knowledge of the dark arts, which allowed him to cast the spell that separated the Earth from the Heavens so that the Spirits would contact the Brotherhood. Zobek discloses he used the Devil Mask on Gabriel to kill Marie and that <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> was for Gabriel to restore the power of the Spirits to avoid suspicion from them. Satan (Jason Isaacs) emerges and takes the God Mask from Zobek, revealing himself as the mastermind who gave Zobek his powers so that Satan could have revenge on God and return to the Heavens. Gabriel confronts Satan and defeats him, releasing souls of the deceased from limbo. Gabriel discovers the God Mask cannot bring Marie back and that it only allows him to see through God's eyes. Marie tells him he has been given a new life to redeem himself before she departs with the God Mask.|$|E

His worst finish was a 6th place at Motegi, which was <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> to clinch the title that day, taking the first premier class title for an Italian or a non-Japanese {{manufacturer}} since Phil Read's title for MV Agusta in 1974. Stoner was named Young Australian of the Year for his 2007 performance.|$|E

[...] On February 3, 2015 Kane was a healthy scratch against the Vancouver Canucks. It was later determined that he was scratched because of an incident with his teammates.

Until the latter stages of the final race of the 1986 season, the Australian Grand Prix, Prost appeared set to finish second in the Championship, behind Mansell. Prost had the same number of wins as Piquet, but he had four second places to Piquet's three, thus placing him second before the final race. While running third behind Piquet, and directly behind Prost on the road (3rd was <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> to win the title), Mansell suffered a rear tyre failure at [...] and crashed out.

Ryder later commented on the extreme cold and the crowded nature of the caravan, which had eight people inside it during filming; he {{felt that it was}} [...] "quite hectic but [...] a great atmosphere". Throughout filming, Hoyle and Ryder {{remained}} in character, improvising their scenes around a basic narrative structure rather than using a script. Hoyle told a reporter that they [...] "wanted everything to feel like real time... As soon as you woke up, the cameras would be on you. I look knackered."

Upon reviewing Michael's financial situation, Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) finds that Michael spends a large amount on useless items like magic kits and bass fishing equipment.

Dwight retreats to the stairwell to moan.

Layne suggested that Cayce offer his trance healing to the public. Cayce was reluctant as {{he had no idea what}} he was prescribing while asleep, and whether the remedies were safe. He also told Layne he himself did not want to know anything about the patient as it was not relevant. He finally agreed, on the condition that readings would be free. He began, with Layne's help, to offer free treatments to the townspeople. Layne described Cayce's method as, [...] "...a self-imposed hypnotic trance which induces clairvoyance." [...] Reports of Cayce's work appeared in the newspapers, which inspired many postal inquiries. Cayce stated he could work just as effectively using a letter from the individual as with the person being present in the room.
