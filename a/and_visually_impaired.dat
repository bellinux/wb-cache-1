40|$|Mapping {{applications}} on mobile {{devices have}} gained widespread popularity {{as a means}} for enhancing user mobility and ability to explore new locations <b>and</b> venues. <b>Visually</b> <b>impaired</b> users currently rely on computer text-tospeech or human-spoken descriptions of maps and indoor spaces. Unfortunately, speech-based descriptions are limited in their ability to succinctly convey complex layouts or spacial positioning. This paper presents Timbremap, a sonification interface enabling <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> users to explore complex indoor layouts using off-the-shelf touch-screen mobile devices. This is achieved using audio feedback to guide the user’s finger on the device’s touch interface to convey geometry. Our userstudy evaluation shows Timbremap is effective in conveying non-trivial geometry <b>and</b> enabling <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> users to explore indoor layouts. 1...|$|R

Twelve blindfolded participants, <b>and</b> one <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> person, were able to operate both players, though there were problems with short impact related operations in the gesture player.
