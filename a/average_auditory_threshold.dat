The present study refers to a population of industrial workers affected by noise-induced hearing loss. Aim {{of the study is}} to identify the minimal level of hearing loss over which the patient felt changes in his quality of life, and the <b>average</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>threshold</b> at which the patient considered the application of a hearing aid useful or necessary. The sample comprised 180 males with noise-induced hearing loss. Each subject received a questionnaire designed for this study. Data show a correlation between disability, handicap and the degree of noise-induced hearing loss. The most relevant problems in noise-induced hearing loss are correlated with disability rather than handicap. 35 dB can be considered as the level above which these devices can be suggested to patients.

40|$|ABSTRACTThis study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the effect of acute brucellosis on the auditory system. Forty-two patients with acute brucellosis were evaluated clinically, and with serological and audiological tests, before and after treatment. Hearing threshold averages were calculated at 11 different frequencies (250 – 8000 Hz) of the auditory airway, and statistical analysis was performed. The average hearing thresholds were > 20 dB, with standard audiometry at 6000 – 8000 Hz, and < 20 dB at all other frequencies. After treatment, the <b>average</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>threshold</b> decreased to < 20 dB at 6000 – 8000 Hz (p < 0. 0001). Pure-tone hearing thresholds were improved at all frequencies after treatment, with statistically significant differences at all frequencies except 12 000, 14 000 and 16 000 Hz (p < 0. 05). There was no permanent hearing loss caused by acute brucellosis, and hearing thresholds were restored after treatment. It was concluded that acute brucellosis affects the auditory system, especially at high frequencies, and that patients with all forms of brucellosis should be evaluated for hearing loss...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose: Auditory {{processing}} disorders (APD), tinnitus {{and hearing}} loss (HL) are typical issues reported by patients in audiologic clinics. These auditory impairments can be concomitant or mutually excluding. APD {{are not necessarily}} accompanied by significant HL, whereas many adults exhibit peripheral HL and typical cognitive deficits often associated with APD. Since HL, tinnitus and APD affects to several parts of the ascending auditory pathway from the periphery to the auditory cortex, {{there could be some}} interrelationship between them. For instance, tinnitus has been reported to degrade the auditory localization capacity. Tinnitus is believed to be triggered by deafferentation of normal peripheral input to the central auditory system. This peripheral deficit can be accompanied by HL or not, since a type of permanent cochlear damage (thus deafferentation) without an elevation of hearing thresholds might persist. Therefore, a combined study of APD, tinnitus and HL on the same cohort of patients can be audiologically relevant and worthy. Methods: Statistical analysis is applied to a cohort of 305 patients attending an audiology clinic in Madrid (Spain). This group of patients is first categorized in four subgroups, namely, HLTG (with tinnitus and HL), NHLTG (with tinnitus and without HL), HLNTG (with HL but no tinnitus), and NHLNTG (neither tinnitus nor HL). The statistical variables include Age, <b>Average</b> <b>Auditory</b> <b>Threshold</b> (ATT), for assessing HL, Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI), for measuring tinnitus, and a new 25 -item Auditory Behavior Questionnaire (ABQ), for scoring APD. Factor analysis is applied to arrange these items into 4 subscales. The internal consistency reliability of this ABQ is confirmed by calculating Cronbach's coefficients α. The test-retest reliability is assessed by the intraclass correlation coefficients, ICC. Statistical techniques applied to the data set include descriptive analysis of variables and Spearman rank correlations (ρ) between them. Results: Overall reliability of ABQ is confirmed by an α value of 0. 89 and by an ICC of 0. 91. Regarding the internal consistency reliability, the four subscales prove a fairly good consistency with α coefficients above 0. 7. Average values of statistical variables show significantly lower age of patients with tinnitus and no HL, which can provide a cue of noise overexposure of this segment of population. These younger patients show also decreased ABQ and similar THI in comparison with patients in the other subgroups. A strong correlation (ρ = 0. 63) was found between AAT and Age for the HLNTG subgroup. For the HLTG subgroup, a moderate correlation (ρ = 0. 44) was found between ABQ and THI. Conclusion: The utilized questionnaire (ABQ), together with AAT and THI, can help to study comorbid hearing impairments in patients regularly attending an audiological clinic.

MATERIALS and METHODS: Retrospective study on 8 postlingual adults and 52 prelingual children with severe to profound hearing loss who underwent cochlear implantation at the Otolaryngology-Head and Neck surgery department, Kasr-Al Aini Hospital, Cairo University. A statistical analysis of several factors was performed to reveal any significant effect {{of the outcome of}} the procedure. RESULTS: The duration of deafness in adults showed a significant linear yet non-monotonic correlation with the postoperative <b>average</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>thresholds</b> as revealed by Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r= 0. 839, p= 0. 009) and a linear regression model (f= 14. 211, p= 0. 009), which showed that the increase in the duration of deafness led to an increase in hearing thresholds and accounted for 70. 3 % {{of the variance in the}} outcome (β= 0. 839, t= 3. 770, and p= 0. 009). Age at implantation in children showed a positive linear, monotonic relation with the postoperative receptive (r= 0. 725, p< 0. 001, rS= 0. 354, p= 0. 010) and was a significant predictor of outcome (β= 0. 440, t= 2. 961; p= 0. 005) according to multiple linear regres-sion. Mann-Whitney U-test was performed to evaluate the difference in medians of outcomes in relation to the regularity of attendance to speech rehabilitation.

40|$|Cyclodextrins are sugar {{compounds}} that are increasingly finding medicinal uses {{due to their}} ability to complex with hydrophobic molecules. One cyclodextrin in particular, 2 -hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin (HPbCD), is used as a carrier to solubilize lipophilic drugs and is itself being considered as a therapeutic agent for treatment of Niemann-Pick Type C disease, due to its ability to mobilize cholesterol. Results from toxicological studies suggest that HPbCD is generally safe, but a recent study has found that it causes hearing loss in cats. Whether the hearing loss occurred via death of cochlear hair cells, rendering it permanent, was unexplored. In the present study, we examined peripheral auditory function and cochlear histology in mice after subcutaneous injection of HPbCD to test for hearing loss and correlate any observed auditory deficits with histological findings. On <b>average,</b> <b>auditory</b> brainstem response <b>thresholds</b> were elevated at 4, 16, and 32 kHz in mice one week after treatment with 8, 000 mg/kg.

Vertex to mastoid brainstem auditory-evoked potentials in response to 5. 1 -millisecond Hanning-gated sine waves with frequencies octave-spaced from 0. 5 to 32 kHz were recorded. Three dogs were examined at 10, 13, 19, 25, and 45 days. Four other dogs were examined at 16 days. Data from 7 dogs between 42 and 47 days of age were pooled to obtain audiogram reference values in 1. 5 -month-old puppies. The best <b>auditory</b> <b>threshold</b> lowered from above 60 dB sound pressure level (SPL) to values close to 0 dB SPL between 13 and 25 days of age and then stabilized. The audible frequency range widened, including 32 kHz in all tested dogs from the 19 th day. In the 7 1. 5 -month-old puppies, the mean <b>auditory</b> <b>threshold</b> decreased by 11 dB per octave from 0. 5 to 2 kHz. The <b>auditory</b> <b>threshold</b> was lowest and held the same value from 2 to 8 kHz. The mean <b>auditory</b> <b>threshold</b> increased by 20 dB per octave from 8 to 32 kHz.

Regarding the otoacoustic emissions, smokers group presented a lower response level in the frequencies of 1, 000 Hz in both ears and 4, 000 Hz in the left ear. Among smokers there were more cases of cochlear dysfunction and tinnitus. ConclusionOur results suggest that cigarette smoking has an adverse effect on the auditory system...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION: One of the {{problems}} observed in pure-tone audiometry tonal has been the variation in test results of a same individual, particularly at frequencies of 4 kHz, 6 kHz and/or 8 kHz. Improper placement of headphones {{is one of the}} factors that can cause alterations in results. OBJECTIVE: To compare differences in <b>auditory</b> <b>thresholds</b> using earphones positioned by the examiner and by the worker. METHODS: Clinical and experimental study conducted in 2009, with 324 workers aged between 19 and 61 years, with a mean of 33. 29 years and mean exposure time of 7. 67 years. All subjects were familiar with audiometry procedures. <b>Auditory</b> <b>thresholds</b> were obtained at frequencies of 0. 25 - 8 kHz, with earphones positioned by the examiners, and at frequencies of 4, 6 and 8 kHz, with earphones placed by workers in a comfortable position, following the examiner's instructions. The thresholds obtained in these two situations were compared. RESULTS: The three frequencies exhibited better responses with earphones placed by the workers themselves (p < 0. 001). At a frequency of 8 kHz a greater difference was found (p < 0. 001), with a mean of 13. 89 dB and standard deviation of 6. 07 dB. CONCLUSION: Earphone placement by the workers themselves under supervision of the examiner results in improved mean <b>auditory</b> <b>thresholds</b> at frequencies of 4, 6 and 8 kHz, the last one significantly higher than the other two...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} hear is crucial to an animal’s survival. Fish have {{developed}} complex hearing mechanisms that can {{be influenced by the}} environment. For example, in catfish, high water temperatures lower the <b>auditory</b> <b>threshold,</b> or the sound intensity required to produce a response in the brain. In bats, increasing a sound’s duration increases the latency, or {{the time it takes to}} initiate an electrical response in the brain, known as an auditory evoked potential (AEP). This indicates that their brain is responding to the end (offset) of a sound. The current study will investigate auditory evoked potentials in goldfish. Here, sounds of different durations will be played to goldfish in order to study the effect of duration on AEP latency. Since bats and goldfish are both selective for shorter sound durations, it is hypothesized that the response latency in goldfish will also increase with sound duration, meaning they would respond to sound offset. Additionally, the effects of water temperature will be examined by comparing <b>auditory</b> <b>thresholds</b> at two different temperatures. Based on what is seen in catfish, it is hypothesized that increasing the temperature will lower the <b>auditory</b> <b>threshold</b> in goldfish. This study will provide insight to the impact of environmental factors such as water temperature and surrounding sounds on fish hearing. Additionally, advancing knowledge in fish audiology is crucial to the continued application of fish acoustic systems as models for human hearing...|$|R
