5|$|Gilchrist {{has been}} {{the chair of the}} National Australia Day Council since 2008. In 2008, Gilchrist {{supported}} debate on whether Australia Day should be moved to a new date because the current date marks European settlement and is offensive to many Aboriginal Australians. Gilchrist is considered to have left-wing views; Australian captain Ricky Ponting commented in his annual Captain's Diary that his deputy had <b>a</b> <b>penchant</b> for reading Karl Marx while on tour.|$|E

5|$|A {{tall and}} thin off spinner, Trumble {{delivered}} the ball at a quicker pace than most spin bowlers, using his height and uncommonly long fingers to his greatest advantage. He was at his best on the softer pitches of England, but his accuracy and variations in pace enabled him to take wickets on the harder pitches of Australia. He was a dependable lower order batsman and a fine fielder in the slips. He was recognised as a shrewd thinker about the game and was popular with team-mates and opponents, with <b>a</b> <b>penchant</b> for practical jokes.|$|E
5|$|Born into a well-read {{and educated}} family, Hambro {{developed}} <b>a</b> <b>penchant</b> for French literature, marking an incongruity to the literary taste of his parents—they had been readers of English {{literature in the}} Anglo-American tradition. Making his debut in 1960 with the satirical novel De frafalnes klubb, Hambro published trilogies and other novels {{for the next two}} decades. He had a keen interest in linguistics; in the 1969 book Ting, tanke, tale he problematized linguistic questions in a popular scientific way. A translator of French literature, he chaired the Norwegian Association of Literary Translators in the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Groening {{thought that}} it would be funny to have a baby {{character}} that did not talk and never grew up, but was scripted to show any emotions that the scene required. Maggie's comedic hallmarks include her tendency to stumble and land on her face while attempting to walk, and <b>a</b> <b>penchant</b> for sucking on her pacifier, the sound of which has become the equivalent of her catchphrase and was originally created by Groening during the Tracey Ullman period. In the early seasons of the show, Maggie would suck her pacifier over other characters' dialogue, but this was discontinued because the producers found it too distracting.|$|E
5000|$|... ″Rapid Sandification {{parts of}} Arabia, desertification, cosmic and climatological evolution? In our view, Islamic {{expansion}} involves {{an even more}} down-to-earth explanation: It was born of <b>an</b> irresistible <b>penchant</b> for raiding (l'irrésistible <b>penchant</b> <b>à</b> la razzia) which animated all the Arabs. The success of these tumultuous incursions, due to a better military organization, belatedly suggested to them the idea of occupation and conquest, an idea absent at the beginning.″ ...|$|R
5000|$|Rex has <b>an</b> uncanny <b>penchant</b> for ham rolls, or [...] "Wurštsemm'ln" [...] in {{the local}} dialect. He is {{introduced}} to them by Moser, who tells him, [...] "I practically live on these".|$|R

5|$|His first {{exposure}} to musical training {{came in the}} form of piano lessons, which he later said in his instructional video A Work in Progress did not have much impact on him. He had <b>a</b> <b>penchant</b> for drumming on various objects around the house with a pair of chopsticks, so for his thirteenth birthday his parents bought him a pair of drum sticks, a practice drum and some lessons, with the promise that if he stuck with it for a year they would buy him a kit.|$|E
5|$|In 1835, aged 14, Paranhos {{was sent}} to the Imperial capital, Rio de Janeiro, to {{continue}} his studies. At the beginning of the following year he was admitted into the Naval Academy. To help support his education, Paranhos tutored his classmates. In 1841, when he was 22, he graduated with the rank of midshipman, enrolling in the Army's Military Academy. He pursued a course in engineering and developed <b>a</b> <b>penchant</b> for mathematics. Prior to graduation from the Army Academy, he was promoted to second lieutenant in the Navy and became a substitute teacher in the Naval Academy. In 1842, he married Teresa de Figueiredo Faria, whose family had also come from Porto in Portugal.|$|E
5|$|Princess Charlotte was a {{difficult}} child and indifferent student, with a nervous disposition. Her relationship with her demanding mother was strained. As she grew older, Charlotte developed <b>a</b> <b>penchant</b> for spreading gossip and causing trouble. Eager to escape from parental control, at age sixteen, she married Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Meiningen in 1878. Her husband's weak-willed personality {{had little effect on}} her. Known for spreading gossip and her eccentric personality, Princess Charlotte enjoyed Berlin society while frequently leaving her only child, Princess Feodora, in the care of family members. Charlotte and Feodora, in turn, also had {{a difficult}} relationship.|$|E

5|$|Halvdan Koht {{was born}} on 7 August 1873 in Tromsø, {{one of the larger}} cities in Northern Norway. He was the second of four {{children}} born to Paul Steenstrup Koht (1844–1892), an educator and politician, and Betty Giæver (1845–1936), a part-time teacher with <b>a</b> <b>penchant</b> for singing, languages and drawing. Betty's antecedents were mixed: she was maternally descended from Northern Germany, yet on her father's side she was of Norwegian origin—a distinguished forebear on that side was her great-grandfather, the civil servant Jens Holmboe from Tromsø. Through the offspring of his maternal grand-uncle, Halvdan Koht was a third cousin of the parliamentarian Ola Krogseng Giæver. In Paul Koht's lineage, Kjeld Stub was a distant ancestor. The name Koht stems from German immigrants to Norway in the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Cooder {{recorded}} Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down {{after being}} {{inspired by a}} headline about bankers and other affluent people profiting from bank bailouts and the resulting recession during the late-2000s. Released in August to critical acclaim, it showcased Cooder's return to his early work's musical style and told topical stories about political and social corruption, various economic victims, and an emerging class war. With the album finished, Cooder had developed <b>a</b> <b>penchant</b> for writing such songs and wanted to continue writing more storyline-inspired songs. A month after the album's release, Cooder had his first short-story collection, Los Angeles Stories, published by City Lights Bookstore. In June 2012, he joined Time political columnist Joe Klein on the latter's road trip across the United States, speaking out to people in towns {{about the state of}} the nation and its forthcoming presidential election in 2012.|$|E
5|$|James Charles Taylor (born September 20, 1935) is {{a former}} American {{football}} fullback who played professionally in the National Football League (NFL) for ten seasons, with the Green Bay Packers from 1958 to 1966 and with the expansion New Orleans Saints in 1967. With the Packers, Taylor was invited to five straight Pro Bowls and won four NFL championships, including a victory in Super Bowl I over the Kansas City Chiefs. He was recognized as the NFL Most Valuable Player after winning the rushing title in 1962, the only season in which Jim Brown did not lead the league in rushing yards during his career. An aggressive player and fluent trash talker, Taylor developed several personal rivalries throughout his career, most notably with New York Giants linebacker Sam Huff. This confrontational attitude, combined with his tenacious running style, <b>a</b> <b>penchant</b> for contact, and ability to both withstand and deliver blows, earned him {{a reputation as one}} of the league's toughest players.|$|E
50|$|De Kuyper's films reveal <b>an</b> {{engineered}} <b>penchant</b> for melodrama, love songs, {{and silent}} films of Alfred Machin and Yevgeni Bauer.

5000|$|Over {{a century}} later, the term has re-appeared with a {{positive}} gloss to mark the post-modern quest for success and celebrity. 'Self-confidence {{is the key to}} all success...Some characterize Trump as an egomaniac...Ross Perot has <b>a</b> similar <b>penchant</b> for egomania'.|$|R
25|$|Bobby Simpson was a {{physically}} compact, highly accomplished batsman with <b>a</b> striking <b>penchant</b> for compiling high scores...He was a pleasant, personable cricketer, and a captain with genuine feeling for his players.

5|$|Other {{characters}} {{include the}} Soda Poppers, {{a group of}} three former child stars from the 1970s. The three, each with their own trademark catch-phrase, first appear as victims of hypnosis in the first episode, later acting as the judges on a Pop Idol parody in the second episode. By the fourth episode, they are elected the governors of the Dakotas and plunge the region into civil war over ownership of Mount Rushmore. Also making sporadic appearances is Hugh Bliss, an eccentric magician and leader of the Prismatology cult, a parody of Scientology. He is often seen attempting to promote his self-help guides based on Prismatology. Sam finds Bliss irritating, while Max almost idolizes him. Minor characters include Agent Superball, a US Secret Service agent with <b>a</b> <b>penchant</b> for guarding doors; Chuckles, the pit manager in a mafia-run casino; and the Computer Obsolescence Prevention Society (COPS), a group of outdated computers attempting to find purpose in the technologically advanced world.|$|E
5|$|Several StarCraft novels also feature Raynor; he is a {{prominent}} character in Liberty's Crusade, which reveals that Raynor {{had a wife}} and son. His son exhibited psychic potential and consequently is conscripted for the Confederate ghost program, where the intense training ultimately kills him. Afterward, Raynor's wife Liddy dies {{after a period of}} depression and illness. As a result, Raynor immerses himself in his work and develops <b>a</b> <b>penchant</b> for operating alone. He is also the primary protagonist in Queen of Blades, a novelization of the events of StarCrafts Episode II in which Raynor attempts to rescue Sarah Kerrigan from the Zerg on Char and eventually allies with the high templar Tassadar and renegade dark templar Zeratul, facilitating the reconciliation between the two estranged Protoss.|$|E
5|$|Steph was {{introduced}} as Zara Morgan's (Kelly Greenwood) bitchy friend with <b>a</b> <b>penchant</b> for humiliating and bullying others. She was {{touted as a}} new student for Hollyoaks High {{and was the first}} character from the Dean family to be introduced into the series. Over time the character was joined by an on-screen family. She was not initially particularly close to her brothers and sister, although for many years she tried to maintain a relationship with them. Generally, her mother Frankie never had much time for Steph or her life, usually preferring to involve herself in the lives of Steph's brothers, Craig and Jake, or to boast about her daughter Debbie's professional singing prowess; in contrast Steph had a very close relationship with her father Johnno, who continually supported the family through a number of tough times over the years; however, Steph was hit very hard when he left Hollyoaks in 2005 after discovering that he had an illegitimate baby son.|$|E
5000|$|The {{album was}} {{produced}} by Daniel Rey who had previously worked with The Ramones, The Misfits, and Boston hardcore punk band, Gang Green - with whom Murphy's Law share <b>a</b> lyrical <b>penchant.</b> He also wrote {{one of the songs}} for this album, [...] "Green Bud".|$|R
50|$|He has {{published}} papers on a generative approach to Garden Design, and is constantly developing a matrix form of planting design to help increase {{the viability of}} ecological planting schemes. Basson spends his time studying natural landscapes with <b>a</b> particular <b>penchant</b> for the Mediterranean flora, natural hard materials and seasonal variation.|$|R
50|$|One day Sang-Eun meets {{a traffic}} officer, that she {{believes}} {{may be the}} prince of her dreams. The traffic officer is named Jong Bum and he has <b>a</b> strong <b>penchant</b> for beautiful woman. He mistakenly believes Sang-Eun {{to be a lawyer}} and approachers her. Once Jong Bum realizes that she is mentally challenged he leaves.|$|R
5|$|Wulfstan {{must have}} early on {{garnered}} the favour of powerful men, particularly Æthelred king of England, for we find him personally drafting all royal law codes promulgated under Æthelred's reign from 1005 to 1016. There {{is no doubt}} that Wulfstan had <b>a</b> <b>penchant</b> for law; his knowledge of previous Anglo-Saxon law (both royal and ecclesiastical), as well as ninth-century Carolingian law, was considerable. This surely made him a suitable choice for the king's legal draftsman. But it is also likely that Wulfstan's position as archbishop of York, an important centre in the then politically sensitive northern regions of the English kingdom, made him not only a very influential man in the North, but also a powerful ally for the king and his family in the South. It is indicative of Wulfstan's continuing political importance and savvy that he also acted as legal draftsman for, and perhaps advisor to, the Danish king Cnut, who took England's West Saxon throne in 1016.|$|E
5|$|Barry John {{was born}} in Cefneithin, Carmarthenshire in Wales. He was educated at Gwendraeth Grammar School in the Gwendraeth Valley, north of Llanelli. He {{attended}} Cefenithin Primary, {{and there he was}} fortunate to receive skilled rugby teaching. The headmaster, William John Jones, and teacher Ray Williams, were both former Wales international rugby players. Despite his natural talents, he never played at schoolboy level for Wales, but represented both his school and his local village team, Cefneithin RFC. He once played a game for rival team Pontyberem while still a schoolboy, but John recalls in his autobiography that the local resentment at making such a sporting faux pas ensured he never did so again. While still a teenager attending grammar school, he made his first top-flight rugby appearance for Llanelli, on 4 January 1964 in an encounter with Moseley. Although Llanelli lost the encounter, John scored a try and converted it, and played in four more matches for the Llanelli senior team {{towards the end of the}} season. He continued to represent Llanelli while at Trinity College, Carmarthen, and gained a reputation as a kicking fly-half with <b>a</b> <b>penchant</b> for putting over dropped goals. During the 1964/65 season, John began to make an impact on the Welsh club scene. His dropped goal against Aberavon on 26 October 1964, only 17games in, was his 11th of the season.|$|E
5|$|Britain's Deviants, in {{the late}} 1960s, played {{in a range of}} {{psychedelic}} styles with a satiric, anarchic edge and <b>a</b> <b>penchant</b> for situationist-style spectacle presaging the Sex Pistols by almost a decade. In 1970, the act evolved into the Pink Fairies, which carried on in a similar vein. With his Ziggy Stardust persona, David Bowie made artifice and exaggeration central—elements, again, that were picked up by the Sex Pistols and certain other punk acts. The Doctors of Madness built on Bowie's presentation concepts, while moving musically in the direction that would become identified with punk. Bands in London's pub rock scene stripped the music back to its basics, playing hard, R rock 'n' roll. By 1974, the scene's top act, Dr. Feelgood, was paving the way for others such as the Stranglers and Cock Sparrer that would {{play a role in the}} punk explosion. The pub rock scene created small venues where non-mainstream bands could play and they released low-cost recordings on independent record labels. Among the pub rock bands that formed that year was the 101ers, whose lead singer would soon adopt the name Joe Strummer, a performer who has been called the link between pub rock and punk rock. Despite the presence of some shared approaches and values between the two genres, they had an important difference; while pub rock aimed to continue the tradition of earlier rock'n'roll bands, punk rock aimed to break with tradition.|$|E
50|$|There {{was much}} {{speculation}} that the Yongle Emperor's real mother was a Korean or Mongolian concubine. Relations between Ming China and Joseon Korea improved dramatically and became much more amicable and mutually profitable during Yongle's reign, who also had <b>a</b> strong <b>penchant</b> for Korean cuisine and women, as did his grandson, the Xuande Emperor.|$|R
5000|$|Bardem's native {{language}} is Spanish {{and he is}} also fluent in English. He is also a stated fan of heavy metal music, with <b>a</b> particular <b>penchant</b> for the band AC/DC.
