During the seventeenth century, the second part held an indoor jeu de paume court and a chapel; its first floor had three large bedrooms.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A nonsingular matrix {{is called}} <b>almost</b> {{strictly}} <b>totally</b> positive when all its minors are nonnegative, and furthermore these minors are positive if {{and only if}} their diagonal entries are positive. In this paper we give a characterization of these matrices in terms of the positivity of a very reduced number of their minors (which are called boundary minors), improving previous characterizations that have appeared in the literature. We show the role of boundary minors in accurate computations with <b>almost</b> strictly <b>totally</b> positive matrices. Moreover, we analyze the QR factorization of these matrices, showing the differences and analogies with that of totally positive matrices.

5|$|Between 1907 and 1920 Bruce {{made many}} {{journeys}} to the Arctic regions, both for scientific and for commercial purposes. His failure to mount any major exploration ventures after the SNAE is usually attributed to {{his lack of}} public relations skills, powerful enemies, and his fervent Scottish nationalism. By 1919 his health was failing, and he experienced several spells in hospital {{before his death in}} 1921, after which he was <b>almost</b> <b>totally</b> forgotten. In recent years, following the centenary of the Scottish Expedition, efforts have been made to give fuller recognition to his role in the history of scientific polar exploration.|$|E
5|$|Its {{position}} on a major route way brought death and destruction to the town on many occasions. In 1069, {{in an attempt to}} quell rebellion in the north, the area between the Ouse and the Tyne was laid to waste by the armies of William the Conqueror. The town of Northallerton was <b>almost</b> <b>totally</b> destroyed or depopulated. Just a few years later it is described in the Domesday Book as modo est in manu regis et wastum est (put down as waste). In 1318, the town was destroyed again by the Scots, under Sir James Douglas following the Capture of Berwick upon Tweed.|$|E
5|$|Phase {{contrast}} and {{differential interference contrast}} (DIC) microscopy are important tools in biology and medicine. Most animal cells and single-celled organisms have very little color, and their intracellular organelles are <b>almost</b> <b>totally</b> invisible under simple bright field illumination. These structures can be made visible by staining the specimens, but staining procedures are time-consuming and kill the cells. As seen in Figs.24 and25, phase {{contrast and}} DIC microscopes allow unstained, living cells to be studied. DIC also has non-biological applications, for example {{in the analysis of}} planar silicon semiconductor processing.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after his}} arrival at Sigeberht's court, Felix {{established}} a church at Dommoc, his episcopal see, which is widely taken to mean Dunwich, on the Suffolk coast. Dunwich has since been <b>almost</b> <b>totally</b> destroyed by the effects of coastal erosion. Other historians have suggested as an alternative site for Felix's see the coastal Walton, Suffolk near Felixstowe, where {{there was once a}} Roman fort. A church and priory were dedicated to him there by Roger Bigod in 1105.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the fire was under control, the house was <b>almost</b> <b>totally</b> destroyed, leaving behind only the garage and some front stonework. The fire had spread rapidly, and {{although}} high winds contributed to the intensity, authorities deemed {{the speed with which}} the house had become fully involved suspicious enough to bring in arson investigators. The bodies of Tim and Kelly were not recovered until the following morning, when the house had cooled enough to permit safe searching. Kelly had perished in her bed, most likely of smoke inhalation. Tim's body was found on the ground floor, near the kitchen. Investigators at first assumed he had died trying to escape, but later determined that he had perished in or near his bedroom, most likely of smoke inhalation and heat, and that his body had fallen through burned flooring to where it was discovered.|$|E
5|$|In 1798 a large French {{expeditionary force}} under General Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Egypt, then under the nominal {{control of the}} Ottoman Empire, in an {{extension}} of the ongoing French Revolutionary Wars. The fleet that had convoyed the French army was anchored in Aboukir Bay near Alexandria, and was discovered there by a British fleet under Vice-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson on 1 August. In the ensuing Battle of the Nile the French Mediterranean Fleet was <b>almost</b> <b>totally</b> destroyed, preventing the French forces in Egypt from maintaining regular reinforcement and communication from France and ending the possibility of a wholesale evacuation of the French army. Following an unsuccessful campaign in Syria, Bonaparte returned to France without his army, eventually seizing control of the French government during the events of 18 Brumaire.|$|E

5|$|In 1804, {{at the end}} of the Peace of Amiens, Hope briefly took {{command of}} HMS Atlas, but it soon became clear that his health was failing and he could no longer {{maintain}} an active naval career. Retiring from the navy on half-pay, Hope was an invalid from 1804 until 1807, when a return to health permitted him to take a post as a Lord of the Admiralty. Hope changed positions several times in this role, but he held onto the position for twenty years as a political favourite, a status maintained by being <b>almost</b> <b>totally</b> politically inactive. In 1812, Hope was advanced to rear-admiral and in January 1815 he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) on the reorganisation of the order, and was invested later in the year.|$|E
5|$|In Asia Minor, Conrad {{decided not}} {{to wait for the}} French, and marched towards Iconium, capital of the Seljuq Sultanate of Rûm. Conrad split his army into two divisions. Much of the {{authority}} of the Byzantine Empire in the western provinces of Asia Minor was more nominal than real, with much of the provinces being a no-man's land controlled by Turkish nomads. Conrad underestimated the length of the march against Anatolia, and anyhow assumed that the authority of Emperor Manuel was greater in Anatolia than was in fact the case. Conrad took the knights and the best troops with himself to march overland while sending the camp followers with Otto of Freising to follow the coastal road. The king led one of these, which was <b>almost</b> <b>totally</b> destroyed by the Seljuqs on 25 October 1147 at the second battle of Dorylaeum.|$|E
5|$|The {{entrance}} to the keep was located in an avant-corps on the northern side, with a vaulted passageway between two gates leading from the outer courtyard to the inner rooms of the keep. The keep itself features just two round towers of 5m diameter with square bases, both located {{on the western side}} and within the outer ward. The more southern of the two is <b>almost</b> <b>totally</b> ruined, probably as a result of Ibrahim Pasha's destruction. The more exposed eastern and southern sides featured no towers. According to the historian Kevin Andrews, this is perhaps because they were judged to be adequately protected by the steep terrain.|$|E
40|$|The Brownian {{separable}} permuton is {{a random}} probability measure {{on the unit}} square, which was introduced by Bassino, Bouvel, Féray, Gerin, Pierrot (2016) as the scaling limit of {{the diagram of the}} uniform separable permutation as size grows to infinity. We show that, almost surely, the permuton is the pushforward of the Lebesgue measure on the graph of a random measure-preserving function associated to a Brownian excursion whose strict local minima are decorated with i. i. d. signs. As a consequence, its support is <b>almost</b> surely <b>totally</b> disconnected, has Hausdorff dimension one, and enjoys self-similarity properties inherited from those of the Brownian excursion. The density function of the averaged permuton is computed and a connection with the shuffling of the Brownian continuum random tree is explored. Comment: 26 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

The comparisons of these three different periods showed that the length of mood episode has decreased significantly, from one year before 1940 to about one month, the mortality has <b>almost</b> been <b>totally</b> eliminated, {{the quality of life}} of the free intervals is practically the same, while the number of the episodes has dramatically increased.

5|$|The {{relatively}} short period of occupation at Mixco Viejo (Jilotepeque Viejo) led to an unusual unity of architectural styles for a Mesoamerican city. Almost all archaeological finds at the city, including both artefacts and earlier versions of later structures, date to the last few hundred years before the Spanish conquest. The architecture was built with mica and pumice slabs, in some cases this was coated with stucco. Stone sculpture is <b>almost</b> <b>totally</b> absent from the city, the only example being a ballcourt marker {{in the form of a}} serpent's head with jaws agape and a human head emerging from its mouth. Originally some buildings were decorated with painted stucco but this is so poorly preserved that only a few fragments remain.|$|E
5|$|The rodent fauna of the Northern Highlands of Madagascar {{remained}} <b>almost</b> <b>totally</b> unstudied {{until the}} 1990s. A 1994 {{survey of the}} Anjanaharibe-Sud Reserve partially filled this gap {{and led to the}} discovery of two new species: Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat and northern voalavo, the first known and type species of the genus Voalavo. Both species were formally described in 1998 by Michael Carleton and Steven Goodman. The generic name, Voalavo, is a general Malagasy word for rodent, and the specific name, gymnocaudus, refers to the naked tail, which distinguishes the northern voalavo from the related tufted-tailed rats (Eliurus). In 2000, the species was also recorded from the nearby Marojejy National Park.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} capture of Schuckmannsburg in the Caprivi Strip by a {{combined}} force of BSAP and Northern Rhodesia Police on 21 September 1914, the British South Africa Company's own armed forces and police remained <b>almost</b> <b>totally</b> uninvolved in the war until the following month. The South African Prime Minister, the former Boer general Louis Botha, had told Britain that the Union could both handle its own security during the hostilities and defeat German South-West Africa without help, so the Imperial garrison {{had been sent to}} the Western Front. Lieutenant-Colonel Manie Maritz—an ex-Boer commander who now headed a column of Afrikaans-speaking Union troops—defected to the Germans in mid-September, hoping to spark an uprising that would overthrow British supremacy in South Africa and restore the old Boer Republics. Botha requested the 500-man column that the Chartered Company had raised, hoping to reduce the possibility of further defections by interspersing his own forces with firmly pro-British Rhodesians. The expeditionary force was promptly formalised in Salisbury, and named the 1st Rhodesia Regiment after the unit of Southern Rhodesian volunteers that had fought in the Anglo-Boer War. Apart from a small contingent of Matabele (or Ndebele) scouts, the unit was all white.|$|E

Göring assured Hitler that the 6th Army could be supplied by air, but {{this turned out to be}} infeasible. Hitler's refusal to allow a retreat led to the deaths of 200,000 German and Romanian soldiers; of the 91,000 men who surrendered in the city on 31 January 1943, only 6,000 survivors returned to Germany after the war. Soviet forces continued to push the invaders westward after the failed German offensive at the Battle of Kursk and by the end of 1943 the Germans had lost most of their territorial gains in the east.|$|E
5|$|In France, {{the action}} was infamous for a {{despatch}} supposedly sent by Dupotet and subsequently printed in edited form in the newspaper Le Moniteur Universel.

This story, <b>almost</b> <b>totally</b> invented, was widely believed in France at the time. The effect on the Mauritius campaign of the defeat of Niémen was not immediately apparent, Hamelin's squadron remaining a menace to British shipping well into 1810. However, {{in the aftermath of}} the destructive Battle of Grand Port, the French, although the victors, were unable to repair their ships due to lack of naval stores and their effectiveness declined until they were unable to resist the Invasion of Isle de France in November 1810. This inability was directly related to the failure of all but one of the French frigates sent to reinforce and resupply the island to reach it, the others either captured or driven back en route.|$|E
