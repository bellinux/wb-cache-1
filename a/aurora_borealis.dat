5|$|Brian and Stewie {{decide to}} go to the North Pole to kill Santa, but Brian does not want Stewie to get {{disappointed}} if Santa is not what everybody thinks he is; to this Stewie responds that Brian is as negative as Eeyore from Winnie-the-Pooh. To prevent Stewie from going to the North Pole he tells him that Santa is not real; Stewie questions this, also asking if Elmo, SpongeBob SquarePants and Curious George aren't real. On their way to the North Pole, Brian and Stewie find themselves in Canada, where they meet a man with a thick Canadian accent; they also see the <b>Aurora</b> <b>borealis</b> and the Aurora Boreanaz (an aurora with David Boreanaz's face).|$|E
5|$|SvalRak is the world's northern-most {{rocket launch}} site, and {{is located at}} the 79th {{parallel}} north. This makes it an ideal location for sending instruments into Earth's magnetic field and the polar cups, cleft and cup.

5|$|The University of Alaska also grew {{during this}} period. In 1946, Congress {{appropriated}} money {{for construction of}} a Geophysical Institute to study Arctic phenomena such as the <b>aurora</b> <b>borealis.</b> The institute was established in 1949 and spurred the university's growth as the GI Bill simultaneously boosted the student population. Elementary education also developed as the Fairbanks Independent School District (the precursor to today's Fairbanks North Star Borough School District) was established in 1947 to collect school taxes from areas outside city limits that were sending students to Fairbanks' school. The Golden Valley Electric Association, an electrical cooperative, was founded in the 1940s to provide electricity to areas outside Fairbanks city limits. In 1953, it bought the FE Co. power plant that served Fairbanks and provided electricity to customers as varied as Fairbanks' second radio station, KFRB, and the town's largest farm, Creamer's Dairy.|$|E
5|$|The walrus {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the religion and folklore of many Arctic peoples. Skin and bone are used in some ceremonies, and the animal appears frequently in legends. For example, in a Chukchi version of the widespread myth of the Raven, in which Raven recovers the sun and the moon from an evil spirit by seducing his daughter, the angry father throws the daughter from a high cliff and, as she drops into the water, she turns into a walrus – possibly the original walrus. According to various legends, the tusks are formed either by the trails of mucus from the weeping girl or her long braids. This myth is possibly related to the Chukchi myth of the old walrus-headed woman who rules the bottom of the sea, who is in turn linked to the Inuit goddess Sedna. Both in Chukotka and Alaska, the <b>aurora</b> <b>borealis</b> is believed to be a special world inhabited by those who died by violence, the changing rays representing deceased souls playing ball with a walrus head.|$|E

2500|$|A Birkeland {{current is}} a set of {{currents}} that flow along geomagnetic field lines connecting the Earth’s magnetosphere to the Earth's high latitude ionosphere. In the Earth’s magnetosphere, the currents are driven by the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field and by bulk motions of plasma through the magnetosphere (convection indirectly driven by the interplanetary environment). The strength of the Birkeland currents changes with activity in the magnetosphere (e.g. during substorms). [...] Small scale variations in the upward current sheets (downward flowing electrons) accelerate magnetospheric electrons which, when they reach the upper atmosphere, create the <b>Auroras</b> <b>Borealis</b> and Australis. In the high latitude ionosphere (or auroral zones), the Birkeland currents close through the region of the auroral electrojet, which flows perpendicular to the local magnetic field in the ionosphere. [...] The Birkeland currents occur in two pairs of field-aligned current sheets. [...] One pair extends from noon through the dusk sector to the midnight sector. [...] The other pair extends from noon through the dawn sector to the midnight sector. [...] The sheet on the high latitude side of the auroral zone {{is referred to as the}} Region 1 current sheet and the sheet on the low latitude side is referred to as the Region 2 current sheet.|$|R
25|$|In {{northern}} latitudes, {{the effect}} {{is known as the}} <b>Aurora</b> <b>Borealis</b> or the Northern Lights. The former term was coined by Galileo in 1619, from the Roman goddess of the dawn and the Greek name for the north wind. The southern counterpart, the Aurora Australis or the Southern Lights, has features that are almost identical to the <b>Aurora</b> <b>Borealis</b> and changes simultaneously with changes in the northern auroral zone. The Aurora Australis is visible from high southern latitudes in Antarctica, Chile, Argentina, New Zealand, and Australia.|$|E

5000|$|In the mid-seventies, Dr. Zdonik {{worked on}} the Prophet data {{management}} system for pharmacologists at Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc. After becoming a professor at Brown University during the early 1980s, Zdonik became a leading researcher in object-oriented databases. He has over one hundred peer-reviewed papers in the database field and was named an ACM Fellow in 2006. More recently, he {{has been involved in}} the development of several notable database projects with other well-known researchers, such as Michael Stonebraker and Sam Madden. These projects include the <b>Aurora</b> and <b>Borealis</b> stream processing engines, the C-Store column store database, and the H-Store parallel, main memory OLTP system.

5000|$|His naming {{was often}} creative, patterned, {{sometimes}} practical and descriptive, sometimes whimsical. Examples of patterned place naming include <b>Aurora</b> Creek and <b>Borealis</b> Ridge, Choral and Anthem Creeks ("singing streams"), {{all in the}} upper Entiat valley; the three [...] "baking powder creeks", Royal, Crescent, and Schilling Creeks, named for then-popular brands of baking powder; the [...] "American poets' peaks Bryant Peak (for William Cullen Bryant), Irving Peak (for Washington Irving), Longfellow Mountain (Henry Wadsworth Longfellow), Poe Mountain (for Edgar Allan Poe), and Whittier Peak (for John Greenleaf Whittier). He named Indian Pass and Indian Creek for the ancient Indian trail over the pass, and in association he named nearby Indian Head Peak and Papoose Creek, a tributary of Indian Creek. Near Indian Creek he named Kloochman Creek and Tillicum Creek, Chinook Jargon terms for wife and friend, [...] "figuring that an Indian should have both {{a wife and a}} friend". Labyrinth Mountain was named for the appearance of its complex contour lines on a map, and in association Sylvester named Minotaur and Theseus Lakes on the mountain. He named Mount David and Mount Jonathan, close to one another, and Mount Saul across Indian Creek valley from them, as in Biblical history Saul being close to but forever separated from David and Jonathan.|$|R
25|$|On November 14, 1789, for {{the first}} time on record the <b>Aurora</b> <b>Borealis</b> was seen in Mexico City. This caused much consternation; people {{believed}} that the heavens were on fire, and the end of the world was approaching.|$|E
25|$|A {{recently}} built landmark is Arctura, {{named after}} Jämtland's provincial star Arcturus, a large hot water accumulator tank. Due to its appearance it {{is referred to}} as Termosen (the Thermos). At night the 65 meter building is illuminated with various lights like sunrise and the <b>Aurora</b> <b>Borealis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Finnmark is {{situated}} in the <b>Aurora</b> <b>Borealis</b> zone, {{and because of the}} dry climate with frequent clear skies, Alta Municipality was early chosen as a location for the study of this strange light phenomenon. For this reason, Alta is sometimes referred to as the city of the northern lights.|$|E
25|$|During {{the night}} after the Battle of Fredericksburg, an aurora was seen from the battlefield. The Confederate Army took this {{as a sign that}} God was on their side, as the lights were rarely seen so far south. The {{painting}} <b>Aurora</b> <b>Borealis</b> by Frederic Edwin Church is widely interpreted to represent the conflict of the American Civil War.|$|E

25|$|It is {{possible}} to observe <b>aurora</b> <b>borealis</b> (northern lights) from Tromsø, as northern Norway {{is located in the}} auroral zone. As it is always light in the summer, no aurora is visible between late April and mid August. Additionally, due to the coastal location, Tromsø is often subject to cloudy conditions which prevents aurora being seen, even if they are present.|$|E

Birkeland's terrella experiment, which consisted of a small, magnetized sphere representing the Earth suspended in an evacuated box, is shown on the left. When subjected to an electron beam a glow of light would appear around the magnetic poles of the terrella, simulating the aurora.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, as {{the fairy}} tale series ended, a second series of three 10-krone {{commemorative}} coins was introduced, celebrating the International Polar Year.

25|$|Thomas Bopp {{was born}} October 15, 1949 in Denver, Colorado. The {{following}} year his family relocated to Youngstown, Ohio. It was there that, {{at the age}} of three, his father Frank Bopp introduced him to astronomy on the porch steps of the family home as they watched a meteor shower. Frank began to teach him about planets, constellations and the <b>aurora</b> <b>borealis.</b> At the age of ten he received his first telescope, a four-inch reflector.|$|E
25|$|While away at sea, in {{addition}} to his exercises with weights and with a punching bag, Hodgson also practised his photography, taking photographs of <b>aurora</b> <b>borealis,</b> cyclones, lightning, sharks, and the maggots that infested the food given to sailors. He also built up a stamp collection, practised his marksmanship while hunting, and kept journals of his experiences at sea. In 1898, he was awarded the Royal Humane Society medal for heroism for saving another sailor who had fallen overboard in shark-infested waters.|$|E
25|$|Stunning and {{dramatic}} scenery and landscape is found throughout Norway. The {{west coast of}} southern Norway and the coast of northern Norway present {{some of the most}} visually impressive coastal sceneries in the world. National Geographic has listed the Norwegian fjords as the world's top tourist attraction. The country is also home to the natural phenomena of the Midnight sun (during summer) as well as the <b>Aurora</b> <b>borealis</b> know also as the Northern lights. The 2014 Environmental Performance Index put Norway in tenth place, based on the environmental performance of the country's policies.|$|E
25|$|On 25 January 1938 (during {{solar cycle}} 17), bright lights, an <b>aurora</b> <b>borealis</b> {{appeared}} over the northern hemisphere, including in places {{as far south}} as North Africa, Bermuda and California. It was the widest occurrence of the aurora since 1709 and people in Paris and elsewhere believed a great fire was burning and notified fire departments. Sister Lúcia indicated that it was the sign foretold and so apprised her superior and the bishop in letters the following day. Just over a month later, Hitler seized Austria and eight months later invaded Czechoslovakia.|$|E
25|$|Notwithstanding {{the arduous}} duties of his professorship, he found time for {{investigation}} in various fields of physical science, and he published {{a very large}} number of dissertations, some of them of considerable length. Among the subjects were the transit of Mercury, the <b>Aurora</b> <b>Borealis,</b> the figure of the Earth, the observation of the fixed stars, the inequalities in terrestrial gravitation, the application of mathematics to the theory of the telescope, the limits of certainty in astronomical observations, the solid of greatest attraction, the cycloid, the logistic curve, the theory of comets, the tides, the law of continuity, the double refraction micrometre, and various problems of spherical trigonometry.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} book of his Meteorology, Aristotle propounded the view of comets that would hold sway in Western thought for nearly two {{thousand}} years. He rejected the ideas of several earlier philosophers that comets were planets, {{or at least a}} phenomenon related to the planets, on the grounds that while the planets confined their motion to the circle of the Zodiac, comets could appear in any part of the sky. Instead, he described comets as a phenomenon of the upper atmosphere, where hot, dry exhalations gathered and occasionally burst into flame. Aristotle held this mechanism responsible for not only comets, but also meteors, the <b>aurora</b> <b>borealis,</b> and even the Milky Way.|$|E
25|$|An aurora was {{described}} by the Greek explorer Pytheas in the 4th century BC. Seneca wrote about auroras in the first book of his Naturales Quaestiones, classifying them, for instance as pithaei ('barrel-like'); chasmata ('chasm'); pogoniae ('bearded'); cyparissae ('like cypress trees'), and describing their manifold colors. He wrote about whether they were above or below the clouds, and recalled that under Tiberius, an aurora formed above {{the port city of}} Ostia that was so intense and red that a cohort of the army, stationed nearby for fire duty, galloped to the rescue. It has been suggested that Pliny the Elder depicted the <b>aurora</b> <b>borealis</b> in his Natural History, when he refers to trabes, chasma, 'falling red flames' and 'daylight in the night'.|$|E
25|$|The {{environment}} in which the Inuit lived inspired a mythology filled with adventure tales of whale and walrus hunts. Long winter months of waiting for caribou herds or sitting near breathing holes hunting seals gave birth to stories of mysterious and sudden appearance of ghosts and fantastic creatures. Some Inuit looked into the <b>aurora</b> <b>borealis,</b> or northern lights, to find images of their family and friends dancing in the next life. However, some Inuit believed that the lights were more sinister and if you whistled at them, they would come down and cut off your head. This tale is still told to children today. For others they were invisible giants, the souls of animals, a guide to hunting and as a spirit for the angakkuq to help with healing. They relied upon the angakkuq (shaman) for spiritual interpretation. The nearest thing to a central deity was the Old Woman (Sedna), who lived beneath the sea. The waters, a central food source, were believed to contain great gods.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} failed {{operations}} after that point, particularly the Battle of the Barents Sea—combined with the outstanding {{success of the}} U-boat fleet {{under the command of}} Karl Dönitz—led to his eventual demotion to the rank of Admiral Inspector of the Kriegsmarine in January 1943. The office of Admiral Inspector was only a ceremonial position with no power. After the Battle of the Barents Sea on 31 December 1942, Raeder, who had received confusing, misleading and incomplete reports from Admiral Oskar Kummetz, had at first reported to Hitler a great victory had been won above the Arctic Circle. Kummetz mentioned in his report that the sky was red – a reference to the <b>Aurora</b> <b>Borealis</b> – and Raeder misunderstood this as meaning that the sky was red because the British ships were all on fire. Later on the evening of 31 December 1942, Raeder called Admiral Theodor Krancke at the Wolf's Lair to explain the misunderstanding, but there was a New Year's party going on, and Krancke decided not to ruin the party by reporting the misunderstanding. Hitler during his New Year's Address delivered on the radio later that night mentioned the victory that the Kriegsmarine had won {{on the last day of}} 1942 with an entire British convoy said to had been destroyed.|$|E
500|$|To tourists, {{one of the}} fascinations of {{the islands}} is their [...] "nightless" [...] summers. On the longest day in Shetland there are over 19 hours of {{daylight}} and complete darkness is unknown. This long twilight is known in the Northern Isles as the [...] "simmer dim". Winter nights are correspondingly long with less than six hours of daylight at midwinter. [...] At {{this time of year}} the <b>aurora</b> <b>borealis</b> can occasionally be seen on the northern horizon during moderate auroral activity.|$|E
