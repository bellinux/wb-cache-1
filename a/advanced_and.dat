5|$|Aerobatic {{competitions}} {{take place}} for both powered aircraft and gliders, {{with up to}} 30 events {{each year in the}} UK and Ireland. Starting at the Beginner level, pilots can move up to Standard (powered aircraft) or Sports (glider) levels, and then on to Intermediate, <b>Advanced,</b> <b>and</b> finally Unlimited classes. Each step up requires a wider repertoire of aerobatic figures and progressively more performance from the aircraft. National championships are awarded annually at Standard/Sports, Intermediate, Advanced (powered aircraft only), and Unlimited levels, and pilots who have reached <b>Advanced</b> <b>and</b> Unlimited levels are eligible for selection to represent the UK in international competition.|$|E

5|$|Departing from Cape Henlopen, Delaware on February 17, 1776, {{the fleet}} {{arrived in the}} Bahamas on March 1, with the {{objective}} of seizing gunpowder and munitions known to be stored there. Two days later the marines came ashore seizing Fort Montagu at the eastern end of the Nassau harbor, but did not advance to the town where the gunpowder was stored.

5|$|Eventually, {{this design}} would prove too <b>advanced</b> <b>and</b> {{expensive}} for Reynolds. He instead devised an alternate {{design of the}} Reynolds Building, {{which was published in}} August 1928. The new design was much more conservative, with an Italianate dome that a critic compared to Governor Al Smith's bowler hat, and a brick arrangement on the upper floors that simulated windows in the corners, a detail that remains in the current Chrysler Building. This design almost exactly reflected the shape, setbacks, and the layout of the windows of the current building, but with a different dome.|$|E

5|$|For locally <b>advanced</b> <b>and</b> metastatic {{pancreatic}} adenocarcinomas, {{which together}} represent over 80% of cases, numerous recent trials comparing chemotherapy regimes have shown increased survival times, {{but not to}} more than one year. Overall five-year survival for pancreatic cancer in the US has improved from 2% in cases diagnosed in 1975–77, and 4% in 1987–89 diagnoses, to 6% in 2003–09. In the less than 20% of cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma with a diagnosis of a localized and small cancerous growth (less than 2cm in Stage T1), about 20% of Americans survive to five years.|$|E

It would change names again in 1955, this time to 100th Division (Replacement Training). It would once again be reorganized in 1959 to its present designation as 100th Division (Institutional Training). Its mission became to teach basic, <b>advanced,</b> <b>and</b> common training skills to soldiers from the Army's active, reserve, and National Guard components.|$|E
5|$|The Avro Vulcan (later Hawker Siddeley Vulcan from July 1963) is a jet-powered {{tailless}} {{delta wing}} high-altitude strategic bomber, which was {{operated by the}} Royal Air Force (RAF) from 1956 until 1984. Aircraft manufacturer A.V. Roe and Company (Avro) designed the Vulcan in response to Specification B.35/46. Of the three V bombers produced, the Vulcan was considered the most technically <b>advanced</b> <b>and</b> hence the riskiest option. Several scale aircraft, designated Avro 707, were produced to test and refine the delta wing design principles.|$|E

Initially running for 16 weeks, the course was cut to 10 weeks (which included 75 hours flying time) in October 1940. A year later it was raised to 12 weeks (including 100 hours flying time), and again to 16 weeks two months later. It continued to increase after this, peaking at 28 weeks in June 1944.|$|E

In 1975, Tomasevich noted that some {{estimates of the number of}} those killed were as high as 7,000, but that the foremost authority on German terror in Serbia, Venceslav Glišić, placed the figure at about 3,000.
