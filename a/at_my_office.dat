In 1771, he moved Abigail and the children to Braintree, but he kept his office in Boston, saying, [...] "I shall spend more Time in my Office than ever I did." [...] He also noted {{on the day of}} the family's move, [...] "Now my family is away, I feel no Inclination at all, no Temptation, to be any where but <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>Office.</b> I am in it by 6 in the Morning – I am in it at 9 at night.... In the Evening, I can be alone <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>Office,</b> and no where else. I never could in my family." [...] Nevertheless, after some time in the capital, he became disenchanted with the rural and [...] "vulgar" [...] Braintree as a home for his family. In August 1772, therefore, Adams moved his family back to Boston. He purchased a large brick house on Queen Street, not far from his office. In 1774, Adams and Abigail returned the family to the farm due to the increasingly unstable situation in Boston, and Braintree remained their permanent Massachusetts home.|$|E
2500|$|The Court {{began its}} interrogations on May 27, 1920. Dean Greenough summoned each witness {{with a brief}} note, for example: [...] "I expect you, {{whatever}} your engagement may be, to appear <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>office</b> tomorrow, Friday, May 28th, at 2:45 P.M." [...] Another even said: [...] "If necessary you are directed to cut a final examination {{in order to keep}} this appointment." [...] Only the Court's notes survive, not transcripts, so it is difficult to ascertain the tenor of the exchanges, whether these were conversations, interviews, or interrogations, or perhaps changed in the course of each session. Clearly the Court pressed witnesses and challenged them with conflicting facts, since the Court's notes record admissions followed by attempts to recant, as well as denials followed by admissions. For example, the Court's note for Harold Saxton says [...] "when pushed he practically confessed to one act, but later retracted." [...] And Kenneth Day [...] "confessed to H.S. [...] relations with Roberts, after denial at first." ...|$|E

They took off its sexual organs. Some people got paid a lot of money to bottle the rebellion of the '60s, and that's when it started to mean zero to me." [...] He added, [...] "To me, 1969 really suggested the death knell of the counter-culture revolution. The terrible event of Charles Manson showed the cultism of the period; I was always wary of crowds. I didn't go to Woodstock. I didn't want to be in a mudflat waiting to get into a portable toilet. I thought it was a terrible idea. So I stayed <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>office</b> at Warner Bros.…I don't even know what happened around then, for many reasons. One is I was working so hard and was too busy to really get totally turned around by what other people were doing." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{publicity}} {{around this}} matter {{led to the}} Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission's widest, longest and costliest inquiry, with the Ombudsman sending the Kieran Boylan file to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) In December 2012. In May 2013, the investigation concluded with no evidence established of any improper conduct by gardaí. It was later revealed that gardaí had disrupted the GSOC's investigation and refused to co-operate with it. In 2014, the GSOC disclosed {{to the general public}} {{that there had been a}} security alert at their office, an event which, it was later revealed, resulted from a suspicion that gardaí were bugging the office due to the GSOC's investigation into the Kieran Boylan affair. Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams told the Dáil on 19 February 2014 “Today, following a radio interview in which I was asked about the Boylan angle, I was contacted <b>at</b> <b>my</b> Dáil <b>office</b> by a man who said he was the Kieran Boylan in question.

Brandon Boyer on Canabalt in Boing Boing, November 11, 2009 [...] Adam Saltsman, also known as Adam Atomic, made the endless runner Canabalt in 2009, where an anonymous runner runs in one direction and is able to jump and slide upon landing. Boing Boing described the game as a [...] "one-button action-opus". It was made in response to Experimental Gameplay's [...] "Bare Minimum" [...] challenge. The game's viral success was a surprise to him, and he later felt like he squandered the opportunity and audience. When asked in an interview where he imagined the running man coming from, Saltsman stated [...] "I used to have fantasies <b>at</b> <b>my</b> old <b>office</b> job of running down our long, long hallway just for fun.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} study was to closely examine the RISE evaluation system and its effectiveness in non-traditional, Montessori schools. The research consisted of a qualitative study interview approach using three administrators, one who {{did not use the}} RISE evaluation system, and two who were mandated by their central office to use it; and four teachers, all who were evaluated with the RISE evaluation system. This qualitative study used the theoretical framework—hermeneutic phenomenology. Interviews with the administrators and teachers were used to collect the data. The interviews were administered in personal offices, coffee shops, and <b>at</b> <b>my</b> personal <b>office.</b> All interviews(except one) were tape recorded and transcribed by me. The transcribed interviews were coded to create an item analysis. ^ The main {{purpose of this}} study was to determine if the RISE evaluation system would be an effective tool to use in non-traditional classrooms, such as a Montessori classroom. This study was intended to give educators of non-traditional schools and classrooms information about the RISE evaluation system’s effectiveness. ^ This research contributes to the field by studying the RISE evaluation system’s effectiveness in non-traditional classrooms. This study provides a framework for examining the factors for conducting effective evaluations using the RISE evaluation system in non-traditional schools. ...|$|R
