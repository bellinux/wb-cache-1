40|$|Summary. [...] The {{aerodynamic}} lift and moment derivatives for pitching oscillations in incompressible flow have been measured for two axis positions on (i) a clipped delta wing of aspect ratio 1. 2, (ii) a complete delta wing of aspect rat'io 1 - 6, and (iii) an <b>arrowhead</b> <b>wing</b> of aspect ratio 1. 32. The {{results for the}} <b>arrowhead</b> <b>wing</b> and the dipped delta wing are compared with values predicted by the vortex-lattice 5 and the Multhopp-Garner 6 methods of calculation. The results for the complete delta wing are compared with values calculated by Garner G and by Lawrence and Gerber n. In each of the comparisons a satisfactory measure of agreement {{was found between the}} theoretical and experimental values of the derivatives. Calculated values for the clipped delta wing based on very low aspect ratio theory 2 did not accord with those found by experiment. 1. Introduction. [...] 1. 1. Range and Purpose of the Investigation: [...] It has been shown by W. P. Jones 1 that theoretical estimates of flutter and stability derivatives for a wing of finite span in compressible flow can be derived from the solution for an ' equivalent ' wing in incompressible flow. One of the requirements for the equivalent wing is that its lateral dimensions should be (1 [...] M 0 ~) 1 / " times those of the original wing, where M 0 denotes the Mach number of the compressibl...|$|E
40|$|Summary. [...] A {{method of}} calculating {{stability}} derivatives for wings osciUating at low frequencies is developed from ~he modified vortex-lattice method outlined in R. & M. 24701. Derivatives are {{obtained for the}} following wings describing plunging (vertical translational) and pitching oscillations: (i) Delta wings of aspect ratio A, = 1. 2, 2 and 3 with a taper ratio 1 / 7. (ii) <b>Arrowhead</b> <b>wing</b> of aspect ratio 1. 32 with a taper ratio 7 / 18 and angle of sweep of 63. 4 deg at quarter chord. (iii) Circular plate. Comparison is made with measured values of the derivatives for the delta wing of aspect ratio 1. 2 and the <b>arrowhead</b> <b>wing</b> oscillating in incompressible flow. Satisfactory agreement is obtained with experiment, and also with values calculated by the Multhopp-Garner method 4. For the delta wing Ar = 3, derivatives are also obtained for particular (small) values of the mean frequency parameter coM. These results were calculated by using the a~,,-+ 0 solution, which is accurate to first order in frequency, with a correction {{to allow for the}} oscillatory wake. Comparison with values from Ref. 2, in which all frequency effects are taken into account, indicates that the present method is adequate for small values of com. The theory of Ref. 3 'for wings oscillating in compressible flow is applied to the delta wing A, = 3, and the stability derivatives for pitching oscillations are calculated for M [...] 0. 745 and 0. 917.

40|$|The Lomax and Sluder {{method for}} {{adapting}} slender-wing theory to delta or rectangular wings by making chordwise and compressibility corrections is extended to cover wings of any arbitrary planform in subsonic and supersonic flows.

Comparison of the results of this work with those of the vortex-lattice method and Kernel function method for a family of Gothic and <b>arrowhead</b> <b>wings</b> shows good agreement. A universal curve is proposed for the evaluation of the lift coefficient of a low aspect ratio wing of an arbitrary planform in subsonic flow.

40|$|Summary. Oscillatory heave {{and pitch}} {{derivatives}} have been determined experimentally and theoretically {{for a set}} of eight planforms- three cropped delta <b>wings,</b> three <b>arrowhead</b> <b>wings,</b> and two unswept tapered wings. Three experimental procedures of widely different type were used. These were a free oscillation technique for a wall-mounted half-span wind-tunnel models. A similar technique for models mounted on rocket-b 0 osted test vehicles and an inexorable forcing technique of the internal rigid drive type applied to half-span wind-tunnel model wings. The theoretical values were obtained by various forms of liftingsurface theory. All these results are tabulated and compared. They cover a Mach number range of approximately 0. 8 to 2. 5. Some theoretical values of control-surface derivatives are included in the TableS, and a few other miscellaneous experimental or theoretical results are also described. Section...|$|R

40|$|Summary. [...] The vortexqattice {{method of}} calculating flutter derivati~zes {{presented}} in this note is an extension to higher frequencies of the work on stability derivatives reported in R. & M. 2922. The method is a modified form of the scheme outlined in R. & M. 2470 and is suggested {{as an alternative to}} the latter method since it gives a simpler routine calculation for wings of general plan-form. Derivatives are calculated for the following wings, describing plunging and pitching oscillations: (a) Delta wings of aspect ratio A [...] 1 - 2 and 3 and with a taper ratio 1 / 7 (b) <b>Arrowhead</b> <b>wing</b> of aspect ratio 1. 32 with a taper ratio 7 / 18 and angle of sweep of 63. 4 deg at quarter-chord. The results for the d:lta wing A [...] 1 - 2 and the <b>arrowhead</b> <b>wing</b> are compared with values of the pitching derivatives obtained in low-speed tests; those for the delta wing A = 3 with the values calculated in R. & M. 2841. The comparison indicates that the present method gives reasonable accuracy for low-aspect-ratio wings in incompressible flow; the method may be sufficiently reliable for use with the equivalent wing theory suggested in R. & M. 2855 for the calculation of flntter derivatives in compressible subsonic flow. 1. Introductio~Â¢. [...] The vortex lattice method of Ref. 2 (R. & M. 2470) has been used to calculate derivatives for a delta wing A = 3 and gives satisfactory results for frequencies in the flutter range ~ (R. & M. 2841).

40|$|An oscillatory lifting-surface {{theory for}} subsonic flow (Ref. 1) {{is used to}} {{calculate}} the aerodynamic forces on an oscillating <b>arrowhead</b> <b>wing</b> of aspect ratio 2 with trailing-edge control surfaces of varying span. The collocation method is outlined for simple harmonic motion of arbitrary mode and frequency and is applied for modes of plunging, pitching and control rotation. The discontinuous upwash in the control-surface problem is replaced by a smooth equivalent function. An alternative treatment for total forces, such as lift and pitching moment, is provided by the reverse-flow theorem with collocation solutions calculated for the 'reversed wing ' in appropriate modes. Values of the aerodynamic derivative coefficients are presented for a range of frequency at the Mach numbers 0. 781 and 0. 927. The variation of the pitching derivatives with frequency, Mach number and pitching axis is illustrated and shows good agreement with the results obtained by other collocation theories and by low-frequency wind-tunnel measurements. For the control-rotation mode, the calculated values of the indirect control derivatives indicate the good comparisons between the various methods of constructing equivalent upwashes and also the satisfactory comparison with the other collocation theories. Values of the direct control derivatives appear more sensitive and large variations in magnitud...|$|E
40|$|Summary. [...] The {{problem of}} tunnel {{interference}} on a complete lifting wing fitted with ailerons is considered {{in relation to}} aerodynamic measurements on a six-component balance. Asymmetric loading introduces corrections to the incidence of the wing, the drag and the rolling, pitching and yawing moments. Tile basic theory of wall interference in closed rectangular tunnels is outlined in sections 3 to 5. In section 6, the tunnel-induced upwash is {{expressed in terms of}} the loading on the wing and four quantities dependent on tile shape of tunnel. These quantities are evaluated for a duplex tunnel (b [...] - 2 h) in Tables 4 to 7 and may be computed for a general rectangular shape with the aid of Tables 1 to 3. Section 7 describes how the evaluation of tunnel interference is conveniently linked with Multhopp's lifting-surface theory to determine corrections to incidence, pitching moment and rolling moment. A worked example in the case of antisymmetrical loading is given in Appendix II, which concludes with an approximate procedure, suggested as a possible substitute for the lifting-surface method. The corrections to drag and yawing moment are discussed in detail in section 8. All tile corrections are summarized in section 9 and expressed as products of experimental aerodynamic coeffici-~nts and theoretically determined quantities, which are evaluated in Table 8 for an <b>arrowhead</b> <b>wing</b> (Fig. 4) with various ailerons in a duplex tunnel. The corrections to incidence due to symmetrical loading are equivalent to corrections to lift of tile opposite sign...|$|E
