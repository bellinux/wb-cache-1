5|$|On April 27, 2014, {{three years}} and two days after this tornado, a violent EF4 tornado touched down west of Ferndale and moved along almost the same path as this tornado, causing 16 {{fatalities}} and many injuries. However, it affected more of Mayflower than this tornado did and caused greater damage all <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>path,</b> especially in Vilonia, before lifting near El Paso.|$|E

5|$|Many temples {{were now}} built entirely of stone, and their general plan became fixed, with the sanctuary, halls, courtyards, and pylon {{gateways}} oriented <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> used for festival processions. New Kingdom pharaohs ceased using pyramids as funerary monuments and placed their tombs {{a great distance}} from their mortuary temples. Without pyramids to build around, mortuary temples began using the same plan as those dedicated to the gods.|$|E
5|$|Mesa Verdeans used astronomical {{observations}} to plan their farming and religious ceremonies, drawing on both natural {{features in the}} landscape and masonry structures built for this purpose. Several great houses in the region were aligned to the cardinal directions, which positioned windows, doors, and walls <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> of the sun, whose rays would indicate the passing of seasons. Mesa Verde's Sun Temple {{is thought to have}} been an astronomical observatory.|$|E
5|$|A typhoon {{was first}} {{observed}} southwest of Guam on October 1, which progressed steadily westward. On October 4, the storm crossed the Philippines, entering from Borongan in Eastern Samar to Capiz {{and into the}} South China Sea. Heavy damage occurred <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>path,</b> and several boats were wrecked in Capiz, resulting in several fatalities. The island of Mindoro lost communications with Manila during the storm. Shifting to the west-northwest, the storm moved ashore eastern Vietnam on October 8 near Danang. Another typhoon followed a similar path, originating near Guam on October4 and progressing westward. Five days later, the storm struck the Philippine province of Camarines Norte, causing damage as it moved westward through Luzon. Moving across the South China Sea, the storm struck {{the east coast of}} what was then Indochina on October11.|$|E

5|$|Even in {{the absence}} of an impact, {{significant}} acceleration or deceleration of the head can cause TBI; however in most cases a combination of impact and acceleration is probably to blame. Forces involving the head striking or being struck by something, termed contact or impact loading, are the cause of most focal injuries, and movement of the brain within the skull, termed noncontact or inertial loading, usually causes diffuse injuries. The violent shaking of an infant that causes shaken baby syndrome commonly manifests as diffuse injury. In impact loading, the force sends shock waves through the skull and brain, resulting in tissue damage. Shock waves caused by penetrating injuries can also destroy tissue <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> of a projectile, compounding the damage caused by the missile itself.|$|E
5|$|Northeast of Eoline, {{the tornado}} {{weakened}} to EF2 intensity, continuing to cause significant damage as it crossed County Road 9, Alabama State Highway 5, and County Road 26, south of West Blocton. Several mobile homes and site-built homes were either destroyed or sustained major damage. <b>Along</b> <b>the</b> <b>path,</b> thousands of trees were downed. The tornado continued to weaken {{as it moved}} {{to the east of}} West Blocton, continuing to knock down trees. More trees were downed as the tornado crossed the Cahaba River and lifted just northeast of Marvel at 6:55p.m. CDT (2355 UTC), not far from the Shelby County border.|$|E
5|$|Officially, NY18F {{begins at}} {{the eastern edge of}} the village of Lewiston at an {{interchange}} between NY104 and the Niagara Scenic Parkway. Signage for NY18F, however, exists as far south as the interchange between NY104 and NY18 south of the village. According to signage, NY18F is concurrent to NY104 from NY18 north to the interchange between NY104 and the Moses Parkway, where NY18F and NY104 split at the western extent of the interchange. The Seaway Trail, routed along NY104 from Niagara Falls north to Lewiston, follows NY18F west into Lewiston <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> of Ridge Road, here named Center Street. At 4th Street, NY18F turns northward, following 4th Street for four blocks to Oneida Street. NY18F cuts west on Oneida for two blocks before continuing northward out of the village on 2nd Street.|$|E

5|$|The {{choice of}} the route had a {{significant}} impact on the character and culture of the Sevier Valley. It has also been a motivating factor for environmentalists to create a new National Park <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> of the highway to protect scenic areas around the route. I-70 from Green River to Grand Junction, Colorado is part of the Dinosaur Diamond Prehistoric Highway, making I-70 one of the few Interstate Highways to be named a National Scenic Byway. Attractions listed by the Federal Highway Administration for the Dinosaur Diamond Prehistoric Highway on or near I-70 include, Arches National Park, Canyonlands National Park, Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry, Goblin Valley State Park and Westwater. The designation lists several side roads branching from I-70 that lead to dinosaur bones or footprints.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} part of the temple was the sanctuary, which typically contained a cult image, a statue of its god. The rooms outside the sanctuary grew larger and more elaborate over time, so that temples evolved from small shrines in the late Predynastic Period (late fourth millenniumBC) to large stone edifices in the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1070BC) and later. These edifices are among the largest and most enduring examples of Egyptian architecture, with their elements arranged and decorated according to complex patterns of religious symbolism. Their typical design consisted of a series of enclosed halls, open courts, and entrance pylons aligned <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> used for festival processions. Beyond the temple proper was an outer wall enclosing a wide variety of secondary buildings.|$|E
5|$|Typically for a stegosaur, Kentrosaurus had {{extensive}} osteoderm (bony {{structures in the}} skin) covering, including small plates (probably located on the neck and anterior trunk), and spikes of various shapes. The spikes of Kentrosaurus are very elongated, with one specimen having a bone core length of 731 millimetres. The plates have a thickened section in the middle, {{as if they were}} modified spines. The spikes and plates were likely covered by horn. Aside from a few exceptions they were not found in close association with other skeletal remains. Thus, the exact position of most osteoderms is uncertain. A pair of closely spaced spikes was found articulated with a tail tip, and a number of spikes were found apparently regularly spaced in pairs <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> of an articulated tail.|$|E

5|$|In Guadeloupe, {{which was}} the first area the {{hurricane}} affected, residents evacuated to schools set up as shelters. Pan American World Airways canceled flights to the region. When Inez was near peak intensity, the NHC warned residents in southern Haiti and the Dominican Republic of the danger posed by the hurricane. The agency emphasized that the eye was visible on radar to calm tension of an unexpected change in track. In general, hurricane warnings were issued 24hours in advance, with the exception of southeastern Florida due to the hurricane's slowing track. Overall, 250,000people evacuated <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> of Inez. At Guantánamo Bay, officials ordered residents at the naval base to evacuate to storm shelters. Large ships at the port there were moved to Jamaica before the storm struck. Throughout eastern Cuba, Premier Fidel Castro ordered about 125,000people to evacuate in low-lying areas, mostly in Oriente Province. United States Air Force tracking stations in the Bahamas were secured or moved to safer locations. Residents in the Florida Keys boarded up windows and store fronts, and hundreds of people evacuated to a shelter in Key West. In southeastern Florida, government offices and schools closed.|$|E
5|$|The Sajkab'chen {{company of}} native musketeers pushed {{ahead with the}} road {{builders}} from Tzuktzok' to the first Kejache town at Chunpich, which the Kejache had fled, leaving behind {{a substantial amount of}} food. The company's officers sent for reinforcements from García at Tzuktok' but before any could arrive some 25 Kejache returned to Chunpich with baskets to collect their abandoned food. The nervous Sajkab'chen sentries feared that the residents were returning en masse and discharged their muskets at them, with both groups then retreating. The musketeer company then arrived to reinforce their sentries and charged into battle against approaching Kejache archers. Several musketeers were injured in the ensuing skirmish, and the Kejache retreated along a forest path without injury, mocking the invaders. The Sajkab'chen company followed the path and found two more deserted settlements with large amounts of abandoned food. They seized the food and retreated back <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>path.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{first state}} {{trunkline}} highway designated <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> {{of the modern}} US2 was M‑12, a designation that was in use by July 1, 1919, between Ironwood and Sault Ste. Marie. The first roadside park in the country was created by Herbert Larson near what is now US2 near Iron River in 1919–20, although other sources state that {{the first was a}} picnic table alongside US16 (Grand River Avenue) in 1929 south of Saranac. When the US Highway System was created on November 11, 1926, US2 partially replaced M-12. Between Crystal Falls and Iron Mountain, US2 was routed through Florence, Wisconsin. The former routing of M‑12 from Crystal Falls to Sagola became a new M‑69 when the former M‑69 became US102 (now US141). M‑12 from Sagola south to Iron Mountain was made a part of an extended M‑45, which is now M‑95. By the next year, M‑48 was added along US2 from Rexton to Garnet {{as part of a larger}} extension.|$|E
5|$|The {{first state}} {{trunkline}} highway designated <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> {{of the modern}} US41 was M-15, in use {{as far back as}} 1919. The 1925 draft plan for the establishment of the US Highway System would have replaced M-15 with three different US Highways. Between Menominee and Powers, M-15 was to follow the route that US41 follows today. East of Powers to Rapid River, the trunkline would have been just US2. The next segment between Rapid River and Covington was planned as US102 while the remainder north to Copper Harbor was planned as US41. In between Powers and Covington, US41 was planned to follow US2 west to Iron Mountain and then route of the modern US141 between Powers and Covington. When the system was created on November 11, 1926, US41 was the only US Highway routed along the alignment of M-15. The original map showed US41 following an unbuilt alignment between Powers and Marquette. The new US41 designation was instead routed to follow the former M-15.|$|E
5|$|The path {{continues}} north {{beside the}} Torridge Estuary, in places following {{the route of}} the Bideford, Westward Ho! and Appledore Railway, past Northam to Appledore and around the promontory past the Shell middens and a submerged forest, that dates from the Mesolithic period, off the pebble ridge to Westward Ho! (this is the only placename in the UK which includes an exclamation mark). The path then follows the coast around Clovelly Bay where several small villages including Abbotsham lie inland, because of the cliffs. The path passes the site of the Iron Age Hill fort at Peppercombe Castle and the village of Bucks Mills. Clovelly itself is a historic village with a small natural harbour. The path continues past the site of the Iron Age Hill fort at Windbury Head to Hartland Point and Hartland Quay. Hartland Point features a lighthouse and radar tower, and marks the western limit (on the English side) of the Bristol Channel with the Atlantic Ocean to the west. There is a winter helicopter service from Hartland Point to Lundy, which is visible from many points <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> between Welcombe and the Cornish border.|$|E
