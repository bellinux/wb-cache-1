40|$|Voltage ranking is an {{important}} part of power system security assessment. The commonly used performance index method with a low exponent could suffer from masking effects. This paper proposes a generic compensation factor to reduce the masking problem. An <b>adaptive</b> <b>fuzzy</b> <b>system</b> is used for the calculation of the generic compensation factor. A simplification of the defuzzification process is proposed for improvement of computational efficiency. Convergence analysis shows that values calculated by the <b>adaptive</b> <b>fuzzy</b> <b>system</b> are good approximations. The parameters would only need to be calculated offline once.

Besides the commonly used 1 P- 1 Q calculation method, an alternative method is used for the calculation of voltage deviations.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} a {{combined}} direct and indirect adaptive control scheme for adjusting an <b>adaptive</b> <b>fuzzy</b> controller, and an <b>adaptive</b> <b>fuzzy</b> identification model parameters. First, using <b>adaptive</b> <b>fuzzy</b> building blocks, with {{a common set of}} parameters, we design and study an adaptive controller and an adaptive identification model that have been proposed for a general class of the uncertain structure nonlinear dynamic systems. We then propose a hybrid adaptive (HA) law for ad-justing the parameters. The HA law utilizes two types of errors in the adaptive system, the tracking error and the modeling error. Performance analysis using a Lyapunov synthesis approach proves the superiority of the HA law over the direct adaptive (DA) method in terms of faster and improved tracking and pa-rameter convergence. Furthermore, this is achieved at a negligible increasing in the implementation cost and the computational complexity. We prove a theorem that shows the properties of this hybrid <b>adaptive</b> <b>fuzzy</b> control <b>system,</b> i. e., bounds for the integral of the squared errors, and the conditions under which these errors converge asymptotically to zero are obtained.
