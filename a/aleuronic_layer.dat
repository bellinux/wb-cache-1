30|$|To {{know the}} {{segregation}} pattern of colour trait in <b>aleuronic</b> <b>layer,</b> {{study has been}} performed using different chemical tests such as standard phenol, modified phenol (CuSO 4), potasium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide tests. These chemical tests are insensitive to environment and serves not only as basis for grouping of varieties, but also used for genotype identification (Naga Padma et al. 1996) with consistent results.|$|E
40|$|Wheat germinating caryopses may {{represent}} {{a starting point for}} the Fusarium Head Blight disease; however, only few studies concern the defence repertoire of wheat caryopses against fungal challenge. The germinating caryopses of two wheat commercial varieties (Blasco and Sagittario), differentially susceptible to FHB in the field, were inoculated with F. graminearum and the redox status in the interaction milieu, oxylipin production, the expression profile of some host-defence related genes, and programmed cell death in the <b>aleuronic</b> <b>layer,</b> were analysed. In Sagittario, the redox balance was profoundly modified and 9 -oxylipins accumulated during fungal contamination. In this variety, F. graminearum produced a high quantity of deoxynivalenol whilst programmed cell death, also through metacaspases activation, was enhanced in the <b>aleuronic</b> <b>layer</b> of its caryopses. In Blasco, the expression of tolerance factors such as Pathogenesis-Related-protein 1, glucosyl-transferase and glutathione transferase genes was up-regulated consequent to infection. Results show that unscavenged ROS and 9 -oxylipins may be related to deoxynivalenol accumulation in the germinating caryopses of wheat after F. graminearum infection.

30|$|In seed-specific {{expression}} studies {{carried out}} in tobacco, recombinant proteins are typically accumulated in the cotyledon parenchymatic tissue, hence they can directly interfere with embryo development and seed germination. Differently, in rice there {{is the opportunity to}} allocate recombinant proteins in the endosperm, i.e. a tissue separated by the embryo and metabolically inert at maturity. Beside this, rice seeds can be industrially processed to separate the hulls, the germ and the <b>aleuronic</b> <b>layer.</b> The removal of these components, which is relatively inexpensive, greatly favours the extraction and purification of heterologous proteins because both the lipid content and the number of protein contaminants are minimized.|$|E
40|$|During seed {{formation}} of Brassica macrocarpa {{the development of}} the embryo precedes that of the integuments; structural changes and histochemical changes are associated. Esterases, acid phosphatases, phenols and starch follow a sigmoid pattern, increasing during embryogenesis and decreasing during seed maturation. In the mature seed, esterase activity is localized in the embryo and in the cells of the mucilaginous, <b>aleuronic</b> and hyaline <b>layers.</b> Acid phosphatases are present in the mucilaginous cells, mainly in the column, the cell walls delimiting intercellular spaces of the cortical cylinder and the adhesion areas of the cotyledons. Phenols are scanty in the root apex, mucilaginous cells and the palisade layer, and abundant in the pigmented layer. Starch is absent in ripe seeds which have lipid and protein reserves. The major classes of storage proteins have molecular weights of 21, 22, 27 and 30 KD and accumulate in the late stages prior to complete drying. Esterases and acid phosphatases in mucilaginous cells of the seed integument suggest that these enzymes are involved in hydrolytic processes occurring prior to germination and that mucilages have a metabolic function in seed-soil interactions...|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} Figure 3, the {{freezing}} resistance of weedy rice seed was {{much higher than}} that of cultivated rice. Weedy rice surviving semi-wildly in rice fields is known to show a high level of adaptability to environmental stress (Chung [2010]; Chung and Ahn [2005]; Suh [2003]). The weedy seeds that shatter on the surface of paddy fields in the autumn should have resistance to freezing in the winter to regenerate in the following germinating season, although there was no report on the freezing resistance of weedy rice seeds. In plants with freezing resistance, antifreeze proteins block the growth of ice crystals in the outside spaces of cells in the tissue, thus preventing cell damage derived from the repetition of freezing and thawing, and also have functions in transforming the generation of ice crystals by adhering to surfaces of ice (DeVries [1986]; Jeong [2009]; Yoo and Hwang [2000]). In this way, antifreeze protein accumulates in the tissue in case of cold acclimation, and thus makes the plant not freeze to death even in freezing temperature. The tetrazolium test in Figure 4 showed that freezing damage of the cultivated rice began in overall tissue of the embryo and <b>aleuronic</b> <b>layer</b> of seed. But, in the weedy rice seeds after freezing treatment, those seed tissues were stained by tetrazolium solution to dark purple to show freezing resistance. Therefore, one hypothesis for a freeze resistance mechanism of weedy rice is that anti-freeze proteins accumulate in the embryo and <b>aleuronic</b> <b>layer</b> of the seed.|$|E
