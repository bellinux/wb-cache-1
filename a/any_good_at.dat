2500|$|After the decision, the NBA allowed {{players to}} leave college early as [...] "hardship cases", which {{essentially}} {{meant that the}} player had to prove financial hardship. This rule quickly developed into one that was observed in the breach, with Sport magazine writer Jackie Lapin commenting in the 1970s that [...] "Almost {{anyone who has been}} <b>any</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> the game in the past decade would qualify [...] — with the probable exception of Bill Bradley, the banker's son." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other {{writers have}} delved {{more into the}} {{specifics}} of James' general concerns. ESPN writer Rob Neyer stated in a 2003 column that while Ryan was among the 20 best pitchers since World WarII, he [...] "often had trouble throwing strikes, [...] he wasn't <b>any</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> fielding his position". In another column, Neyer, while stating that Ryan belonged in the Hall of Fame, pointed to Ryan's record-breaking walks total and noted that his [...]309 on-base percentage against [...] "wasn't even close to being in the top 100".|$|E
2500|$|Bublé had {{a strong}} passion for ice hockey and {{wanted to become a}} {{professional}} hockey player for the Vancouver Canucks growing up, but he believed he wasn't good enough. [...] "I wanted so bad to be a hockey player... If I was <b>any</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> hockey, I probably wouldn't be singing right now." [...] He often played hockey in his youth, watched Vancouver Canucks games with his father, and said that he [...] "went to every single home game as a kid... I remember I wanted to be Gary Lupul, I wanted to be Patrik Sundstrom and Ivan Hlinka. I used to think that being named Michael Bublé was pretty cool because I was close to being called Jiri Bubla." [...] Bublé shared his hockey interest with his grandfather.|$|E

6000|$|... "I can’t say," [...] said Halibut; [...] "but I don’t think it’s <b>any</b> <b>good</b> your waiting <b>at</b> all, {{because if}} I see any signs that Mrs. Riddel {{is waiting for}} you I may just give her {{a hint of the}} {{hopelessness}} of it." ...|$|R
2500|$|Consequently, the {{somewhat}} recently added drummer Richie Ramone {{stepped up to}} the writing process, resulting in the hit song [...] "Somebody Put Something in My Drink," [...] which would be released as a single and also appeared on the band's first compilation album Ramones Mania (1988). [...] "Joey was always encouraging me to write songs," [...] explained Richie, [...] "but I didn't really need the encouragement." [...] This would be the first time the band used the drummer as a songwriter since original drummer Tommy Ramone, with Joey saying he wanted to make Richie feel like a part of the band, because he felt past drummers were not {{so much a part of}} the band nor <b>any</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> writing, while calling Richie a [...] "regular Phil Collins." [...] Johnny would later say the album needed a better production quality, commenting that the guitar moments didn't sound like he had performed them. [...] "The producer on , Jean Beauvoir," [...] Johnny relates, [...] "was selected by the label, not us." ...|$|E
60|$|Harcourt very plainly {{told him}} {{that a man who}} {{scribbled}} never did <b>any</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> the bar. The two trades, he said, were not compatible.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mary, full {{of her own}} grievances. [...] "It is an abominable bondage, and I do not {{see that}} it does <b>any</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir, I don't {{like the}} way he talks about some things. I don't suppose this country is perfect, but I think it's about the best there is, and it don't do <b>any</b> <b>good</b> to look <b>at</b> its {{drawbacks}} all the time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{could we}} have to do this fall and winter?" [...] asked Mary Erskine. She wished to {{ascertain}} whether she could do <b>any</b> <b>good</b> by coming <b>at</b> once, or whether it would be better, for Albert's plans, to wait until the spring.|$|R

6000|$|I {{got up at}} {{last and}} walked on to the jetty, and the woman, wot {{was sitting on the}} deck of the John Henry, kept calling out: [...] "Bill!"

5000|$|Samuel's {{changeable}} {{feelings for}} Elisabeth {{can be seen}} throughout his diary. A resentful sentence from 25 April 1663 suggests jealous feelings surrounding Elisabeth and her dancing teacher, or perhaps a simple familiarity with Elisabeth and her self-confidence:"...merrily practising to dance, which my wife hath begun to learn this day of Mr. Pembleton, but I fear will hardly do <b>any</b> great <b>good</b> <b>at</b> it, because she is conceited that she do well already, though I think no such thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes;--I {{suppose you}} know what a pony is? Of course {{there ought to be a}} {{shooting}} pony at the cottage for these men. My poor head has so many things to work upon that I had forgotten it; and you're never <b>any</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> thinking of things." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} nurse-maid, [...] "I don't see {{anything}} out of the way in my views.

5000|$|Karwal {{made his}} {{debut in the}} film {{industry}} with the Punjabi film, Aappan Pher Milange, which was released in May 2012 and starred alongside Gracy Singh in this movie. At a promotional event of the film, he said, [...] "After doing television, I wanted to stretch my horizon. Punjabi films is an excellent medium of doing so. The way its reach is growing, it should be giving competition to Bollywood very soon," [...] The film, however, failed to do <b>any</b> <b>good</b> business <b>at</b> the box office.|$|R
60|$|Then {{you hear}} {{every kind of}} odd noise in the ship--creaking, straining, crunching, scraping, pounding, whistling, blowing off steam, each of which to your unpractised ear is {{significant}} of some impending catastrophe; you lie wide awake, listening with all your might, as if your watching did <b>any</b> <b>good,</b> till <b>at</b> last sleep overcomes you, and the morning light convinces you that nothing very particular has been the matter, and that all these frightful noises are only the necessary attendants {{of what is called}} a good run.|$|R
60|$|The chief {{person being}} Mr. Macey, I {{told him how}} the three men of the guard {{would be at the}} gate directly, if they were not already there, and how Sergeant Drooce and the other seven were gone to bring in the {{outlying}} part of the people of Silver-Store. I next urged him, for the love of all who were dear to him, to trust no Sambo, and, above all, if he could got <b>any</b> <b>good</b> chance <b>at</b> Christian George King, not to lose it, but to put him out of the world.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} thought you had. If I went in {{for that kind of}} thing myself, I should like to go {{to the top of the}} ladder. I should feel that if I could do <b>any</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> all by {{becoming}} a Minister, I could only do it by becoming first Minister." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then Drummond got mumps, and I {{wrote to}} him asking if I might {{represent}} the house instead of him, and I suppose he didn't believe I was <b>any</b> <b>good.</b> <b>At</b> any rate, he wouldn't {{let me go}} in. Then Joe--a man who knows something about boxing--suggested I should go down to Aldershot." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good business. There'll be {{shooting}} {{and all that}} sort of rot. Oh, and by the way, are you <b>any</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> acting?

Do you do anything in that line?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{am not a}} good {{fisherman}} myself. I {{devoted a}} considerable amount of attention to the subject at one time, and was getting on, as I thought, fairly well; but the old hands told me that I should never be <b>any</b> real <b>good</b> <b>at</b> it, and advised me to give it up. They said that I was an extremely neat thrower, and that I seemed to have plenty of gumption for the thing, and quite enough constitutional laziness. But they were sure I should never make anything of a fisherman. I had not got sufficient imagination.|$|R
50|$|There {{were small}} waiting {{rooms on the}} platforms, but the booking office and main {{buildings}} were at street level with a long path leading down to the platforms. However, {{by the time the}} station was opened, the city's horse tram network was already well established and by 1901 the tramlines were converted to electricity. This limited the station's usage. It was closed to passenger services on 24 September 1928 - the first station on the Great Central Main Line to close. The line itself closed on 5 September 1966 to passengers and completely on 25 March 1968. There were never <b>any</b> <b>goods</b> facilities <b>at</b> Carrington.|$|R
5000|$|Due to the Troubles {{occurring}} in Ireland, which {{had resulted in}} the loss of over 100 British soldiers in 1972 and the potential security risks, both Scotland and Wales had refused to play Ireland in Dublin in 1972. Defying expectations to the contrary, England agreed to travel in 1973. Despite a poor performance, resulting in an 18-9 loss, the crowd in the Landsdowne Road stadium gave a standing ovation to the England team. England captain John Pullin delivered a quip at a post-match dinner - [...] "Well we might not be <b>any</b> <b>good</b> but <b>at</b> least we turned up" [...] - to great applause.|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{friends will}} not assist {{themselves}} by resisting the government measures," [...] said Mr. Neuchatel, {{with his usual}} calm smile, half sceptical, half sympathetic.

We do not want measures; {{what we want is}} a new channel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, don't {{expect that}} of me. I chew my tongue like a ten-year-old kid when I write. I never was <b>any</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> it, and I'm clear {{out of it}} now. The chances are I'll round up in the {{mountains}} again; I can't see how I'd make a living anywhere else. If I come back this way I'll let you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, don't say so; I didn't do <b>any</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> all," [...] said Sophy, {{becoming}} much {{ashamed of}} her attempt at haranguing. [...] "Old Pucklechurch was the one, for he saved all the dear cows and horses, and was nearly letting himself {{be killed in}} the defence. But, oh! {{all the rest of}} them. To think of them treating us so after everything!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not much fear of that," [...] replied Henry. [...] "The nagging {{woman is}} born, as they say, not made; and she'll nag like the roses bloom, {{not because she}} wants to, but because she can't help it. And a woman to whom it don't come natural will never be <b>any</b> real <b>good</b> <b>at</b> it, try as she may. And as for the men, why we'll just go on {{selecting}} wives according to the old rule, so that {{you never know what}} you've got till it's too late for you to do anything but make the best or the worst of it, according as your fancy takes you.|$|R
50|$|The station reopened on 1 April 1919, and {{continued}} in use until 7 January 1952, when the SCLER {{was closed to}} passengers from Aintree Central to Southport Lord Street. Public goods facilities were ended at Woodvale, Lydiate and Sefton & Maghull stations {{on the same day}} and there never were <b>any</b> <b>goods</b> facilities <b>at</b> Ainsdale Beach station. The line remained open for public goods traffic until 7 July 1952 at Southport Lord Steet, Birkdale Palace and Altcar & Hillhouse stations. A siding remained open at Altcar & Hillhouse for private goods facilities until May 1960. The very last passenger train to run on the SCLER was a railway enthusiasts' special train between Aintree and Altcar & Hillhouse stations on 6 June 1959.|$|R
5000|$|One {{example of}} {{differentiation}} in burials, possibly due to status, was two adult, most likely males, that were both buried within tombs (not {{associated with each}} other), {{but one of them}} did not have <b>any</b> grave <b>goods</b> <b>at</b> all, while the other contained three pots. Presumably one was of a higher status than the other. However, Nasca ceramics in general are the most abundant artifacts at Cahuachi and carry a variety of different information and meaning. Therefore, there is not enough information or sample to create a hierarchical social classification for the people buried with them of the different types of pottery, besides the distinction between plainware and fineware, and even then who is to say which in each distinction is better? ...|$|R
