500|$|Gilbert {{was mostly}} {{collaborative}} with Dahl's work, as the writer declared: [...] "He not only helped in script conferences, but {{had some good}} ideas and then left you alone, and when you produced the finished thing, he shot it. Other directors have such <b>an</b> <b>ego</b> {{that they want to}} rewrite it and put their own dialogue in, and it's usually disastrous. What I admired so much about Lewis Gilbert was that he just took the screenplay and shot it. That's the way to direct: You either trust your writer or you don't." ...|$|E

500|$|Another myth {{concerns}} Saul Bass, {{the graphic}} designer who created {{many of the}} title sequences of Hitchcock's films and storyboarded some of Psychos scenes, claiming he had directed the shower scene. This was refuted by several figures associated with the film, including Leigh, who stated: [...] "absolutely not! I have emphatically said this in any interview I've ever given. I've said it to his face in front of other people... I was in that shower for seven days, and, believe me, Alfred Hitchcock was right next to his camera {{for every one of}} those seventy-odd shots." [...] Hilton A. Green, the assistant director, also refutes Bass' claim: [...] "There is not a shot in that movie that I didn't roll the camera for. And I can tell you I never rolled the camera for Mr. Bass." [...] Roger Ebert, a longtime admirer of Hitchcock's work, summarily dismissed the rumor, stating, [...] "It seems unlikely that a perfectionist with <b>an</b> <b>ego</b> like Hitchcock's would let someone else direct such a scene." ...|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} of {{the leader of the}} Flood were mixed. In a review of Halo 2, Mike Leonard of the AllXbox community said that the introduction of the Gravemind character had him [...] "rolling my eyes hard enough to get motion sickness from seeing the back of the inside of my skull"; Leonard {{went on to say that}} the [...] "Little Shop of Horrors reject" [...] ruined the [...] "cool" [...] of the Halo franchise. Staff from GamesRadar singled out the appearance of the Gravemind as a sign the Halo series had jumped the shark. [...] "Until Gravemind showed up, we were pretty sure we understood the Halo series' story," [...] they wrote, but that the appearance of a Venus Flytrap-like creature with <b>an</b> <b>ego</b> and [...] "a tendency to spout philosophical drivel" [...] was unexpected. Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com bemoaned the fact that Gravemind was never explicitly stated to be the Flood leader in either Halo 2 or Halo 3 and was hardly seen in the third installment. Publications also took issue with the fact that the character's motivations were never fully explored; the South Florida Sun-Sentinel said that the [...] "unique and compelling characters" [...] of Halo 3, such as Cortana and the Master Chief, were overwhelmed by Gravemind.|$|E
500|$|Donna's {{relationship}} with Michael proved unpopular with critics. In an editorial discussing {{the boundaries between}} fiction and reality, The Guardian Scott Murray and Barney Ronay declared their love for Donna, commending the way she [...] "always has time for people" [...] and recommending that she stay away from Michael as she deserves better. Bree Treacy of RTÉ.ie believes that Michael had better chemistry with Donna than with his wife Annalese, however similarly commented {{that he did not}} deserve Donna, never having seen her as more than [...] "a notch on his stethoscope". Following her promotion to ward sister, Treacy hoped that the series producers would give Donna a man who would see her [...] "as more than just a good time girl." [...] Simon criticized Donna for failing to observe correct organ donation protocol in an attempt to win Michael's affection, commenting that she had [...] "thrown her own heart willynilly at the first good-looking doctor she s with <b>an</b> <b>ego</b> the size of Texas." [...] She later branded her [...] "selfish to a fault" [...] for her negative reaction to Kieran's posting to Afghanistan, but opined that Kieran [...] "makes a far more suitable partner for her" [...] than Michael did.|$|E
500|$|After {{seeing the}} {{portrayal}} of Yellowjacket in Ant-Man, the antagonist of the film, McMillian noted, It's hardly a secret that Marvel Studios {{has a bit of}} a problem when it comes to offering up exciting characters for their heroes to fight against ... villains generally fall into one of two camps. There's the Unstoppable Monster ... or there's the Professional White Guy In A Suit With <b>An</b> <b>Ego</b> ... No matter which of the groups the above villains fall into, they share one common purpose: evil. The motivations for evil likely differ—although, invariably, they fall under the umbrella of 'misguided belief in a greater good that doesn't exist'—but that really doesn't matter, because without fail, there will be so little time in the movie to actually properly explore those motivations, meaning that to all intents and purposes, the villain is being evil for reasons of plot necessity and little else ... The strange thing about this is that Marvel's comic books offer a number of wonderful, colorful bad guys who could step outside the above parameters and offer an alternative to the formulaic villains audiences have gotten used to (and arguably bored with) ... In future movies, we can only hope [...] treated {{in such a way that}} their freak flags are allowed to fly free.|$|E

500|$|Though {{he was not}} a power pitcher, Hoffman was a strikeout pitcher. His 9.36 K/9 was the fifth-highest in MLB history, {{and highest}} ever among relievers. Sports {{journalist}} Fran Zimniuch wrote in Fireman: The Evolution of the Closer in Baseball that Hoffman was [...] "a thinking man's closer, using guile rather than heat." [...] As the velocity of his fastball decreased, he compensated with a devastating changeup that is as synonymous a pitch with Hoffman as the splitter is with Bruce Sutter or the cutter is with Mariano Rivera. [...] "It's a tough situation throwing a change-up in the ninth inning, unless you've got Trevor's changeup", closer Billy Wagner said. [...] "There's not many guys who have a changeup that's dominating", All-Star third basemen Scott Rolen said. [...] "But his is dominating. It's a weapon. That's not usually a word you use with a changeup." [...] Robb Nen, a retired closer, was amazed at how Hoffman got better after he lost velocity on his fastball. [...] "I don't think I could do it, to just lose the ability to throw 95 and still be one of the best. I have tremendous respect for him", Nen said. Another retired closer, Troy Percival, concurred about the difficulty in transforming from a power pitching style. [...] "It's not easy to do. Guys who throw 95, 96 [...] have <b>an</b> <b>ego</b> about being able to do that. [...] just went right into, 'Hey, you know, I throw 87 now. This is what I've got.' And he goes out there and gets it done just as well as he ever did." ...|$|E
500|$|The telepathic mutant {{leader and}} founder of the X-Men. He is a close friend of Erik Lehnsherr until their differing views of mutantkind's place in {{humanity}} create a schism between them. McAvoy was Vaughn's top choice for Xavier, and, after being cast, auditioned with every actor considered for Magneto to test the duo's chemistry. McAvoy said he did not read comic books as a child, but added that he was a fan of the X-Men cartoons from the age of 10. While he describes the older Charles Xavier as [...] "a monk... a selfless, egoless almost sexless force for the betterment of humanity and mortality", he says that the younger Xavier is a very different person: [...] "It's quite fun because the complete opposite of that is an ego-fueled, sexed up self-serving dude. And not going too far with it, but he's definitely got <b>an</b> <b>ego</b> and he's definitely got a sex drive as well." [...] McAvoy admitted to feeling similarities between Xavier/Magneto and Martin Luther King Jr./Malcolm X, stating that the film was [...] "sort of like meeting them at a point where they are still finding out who they are and you are still seeing some of the events that shaped them." [...] McAvoy avoided doing any callbacks to Patrick Stewart's performance as Xavier as Vaughn told him and Michael Fassbender to only take the allusion to Xavier and Magneto's old friendship in the other movies as inspiration. Vaughn stated that since he considered that Professor X was [...] "a bit of a pious, sanctimonious boring character, and he's got too much fucking power", the script would make young Xavier more interesting by [...] "making him more of a rogue" [...] who would become more responsible as his mission of finding more mutants went on.|$|E

[...] In one day, March 11, 1962, Ormandy and the Philadelphia recorded Sibelius's Symphony No. 1; the Semyon Bogatyryov arrangement of Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 7 (for which Ormandy had given the Western hemisphere premiere performance); and Delius's On Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring.|$|E

Prior to releasing the album, in an interview with NME, lead singer Luke Pritchard had claimed to have 80-90 songs written for the album, stating, [...] "I want this album to be big……I've got <b>an</b> <b>ego,</b> I want the album to do well. I want our singles to come on the radio and for people to literally have their heads blown off by them". Recorded over a total of seven weeks in London and Los Angeles Pritchard told NME the band had wanted more input into their second album.

2500|$|Actor Matthew Gravelle {{took his}} role as murderer and {{possible}} paedophile Joe Miller very seriously. [...] "You don't {{want to get it}} wrong with whoever you're playing. You try to be as true to somebody who might actually be like that as possible," [...] Gravelle said. [...] "Whatever happens, he's still ultimately not a good person and you've got to try and be sympathetic towards him just to see it from his point of view." [...] He did not research paedophilia per se, but tried to discover research on individuals with pre-paedophiliac tendences. He found there was little scientific research in the area. Gravelle was therefore forced to come up with his own rationales for Joe's crimes. [...] "The need to be loved was the root of it," [...] he said. [...] "Joe had love but he didn't have the attention in the way that he got it from Danny. It's probably <b>an</b> <b>ego</b> thing. ... He's not working. It's a self-worth issue." ...|$|E

In response, Bhagat Singh wrote an essay entitled [...] "Why I am an Atheist" [...] to address the question of whether his atheism was born out of vanity. In the essay, he defended his own beliefs and said that he used to be a firm believer in the Almighty, but could not bring himself to believe the myths and beliefs that others held close to their hearts. He acknowledged the fact that religion made death easier, but also said that unproven philosophy is a sign of human weakness. In this context, he noted: ...|$|E
