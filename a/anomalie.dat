40|$|In the {{generalized}} Pauli-Villars regularization of chiral gauge theory proposed by Frolov and Slavnov, {{it is essential}} to specify how to sum the contributions from an infinite number of regulator fields. It is shown that an explicit sum of contributions from an infinite number of fields essentially results in a specific choice of regulator in the past formulation of covariant anomalies. We show this correspondence by reformulating {{the generalized}} Pauli- Villars regularization as a regularization of composite current operators. A salient feature of the covariant regularization,which works for any chiral theory and gives rise to covariant anomalies, is that it generally spoils the Bose symmetry in anomalous theory but it preserves the Bose symmetry as well as gauge invariance in anomaly-free gauge theory. eneralized Pauli-Villars Regularization and the Covariant Form of <b>Anomalie...</b>|$|E

Although there is a trend to start investigation after two miscarriages, data are not available to date to justify this approach. We sought to compare the frequency of uterine anomalies between women referred to hysteroscopy for repeated miscarriages after two, and three or more, miscarriages respectively. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of acquired and congenital uterine anomalies in all patients undergoing hysteroscopy for repeated pregnancy loss at an academic and referral medical centre. RESULTS: Hysteroscopy was performed on 165 women referred for recurrent pregnancy loss: 67 after two and 98 after three or more consecutive mis-carriages.

40|$|The climate {{variability}} {{over the}} North Atlantic region {{is described in}} the 10 - 50 year band, using a 500 -year integration of the Hamburg ECHAMl/LSG coupled general circulation model. In order to isolate nearly periodic components of the atmosphere and the ocean, the multichannel version of the singular spectrum analysis (MSSA) is applied to 11 components of the climate system. In doing so the main {{focus is on the}} turbulent exchange between the two subsystems. One interdecadal oscillation of the system ocean and atmosphere is detected with a period of about 18 years. The associated anomalies of sea level pressure (SLP) are situated east of Newfoundland while these of the geopotential height at 500 hPa are slightly shifted to the East. Both the fields undergo a primarily standing oscillation. The sea surface temperature (SST) and the sub surface temperature anomalies have a large extension along the 40 ° N latitude circle with most of their variability south of Newfoundland. lt is found that the SST anomaly is primarily generated by the temperature advection in the upper ocean layer which is coupled to the Subpolar Gyre strength and Ekman pumping vertical velocity. Both the processes are forced by the atmosphere. In a further analysis applied only to the SST and the Geopotential height at 500 hPa over the whole Northern Hemisphere this 18 year mode was also isolated. The modes obtained by the local and hemispheric analyses are well correlated both in time and space, suggesting a more active role of atmosphere than of the ocean, in addition a strong modulation of the amplitude of the oscillation due to local processes over the North Atlantic was detected. Die Klimavariabilität über dem Nordatlantik wird anhand einer 500 Jahre Integration des Hamburger gekoppelten Klimamodels ECHAMl/LSG untersucht. Um periodische Komponenten in Ozean und Atmosphäre zu isolieren, wird die MSSA ("multichannel singular spectrum analysis") auf 11 Komponenten des Klimasystems angewandt. Bei den Analysen wird besonderes Augenmerk auf den turbulenten Austausch zwischen beiden Subsystemen gelegt. Es kann eine Oszillation des gekoppelten Systems mit einer Periode von etwa 18 Jahren detektiert werden. Die <b>Anomalie</b> des Bodendrucks weist ihre maximale Amplitude östlich von Neufundland auf, während die <b>Anomalie</b> des 500 hPa Geopotentials leicht östlich dazu verschoben ist. Die <b>Anomalie</b> der SST zeigt ihre größte Variabilität südlich von Neufundland. Diese wird im wesentlichen durch die Temperaturadvektion in der oberen Ozeanschicht generiert, welche im wesentlichen an den subpolaren ozeanischen Wirbel sowie an das "Ekman pumping" gekoppelt ist. Beide Prozesse werden durch die Atmosphäre angetrieben. In einer weiteren Analyse, in der die MSSA auf die SST und das 500 hPa Geopotential der gesamten nördlichen Hemisphäre angewandt wird, kann ebenfalls ein Oszillation von 18 Jahren detektiert werden. Diese Mode korreliert räumlich und zeitlich gut mit dem der lokalen Analyse über dem Nordatlantik, welches auf ein aktivere Rolle der Atmosphäre hinweist.

40|$|Abstract. The Pioneer Anomaly {{refers to}} the {{difference}} between the expected theoretical trajectory of the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecrafts and the observed trajectory through Doppler measurements. It has been interpreted by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) as a constant anomalous acceleration (Anderson et al. 2002). For this analysis, the Groupe <b>Anomalie</b> Pioneer (GAP) composed of several french laboratories has developped a specific trajectography software, ODYSSEY, which enables to test different anomaly models. The paper will present, after {{a brief description of the}} software and the implemented models, the last results obtained: in addition to the constant anomaly, time dependent signatures of the anomaly have been noticed which can be described geometrically. The fit of the Pioneer 10 data with these new models yields a reduction of the standard deviation of the residual by a factor 2 with respect to the simple constant anomaly. ...|$|E

It is therefore of interest to study the environmental factors that may be responsible for their variability. Here we examine variability in the annual number of forest fire scars at a spatial scale of 2. 5 °.

Data come from ten years of satellite–derived data, incorporating both the number of forest fire scars and monthly rainfall.
