In 1869, he and Balakirev worked together on what became Tchaikovsky's first recognized masterpiece, the fantasy-overture Romeo and Juliet, a work which The Five wholeheartedly embraced. The group also welcomed his Second Symphony, subtitled the Little Russian.

5|$|Harry Bradshaw, {{appointed}} {{in the summer}} of 1899, was faced with several difficulties, not least falling attendances and limited funds to attract the best players. In his five years at Arsenal, he managed to steer the club away from bankruptcy by signing local talent such as Jimmy Ashcroft and Jimmy Jackson, and directed his team's promotion to the First Division in 1903–04. Phil Kelso replaced Bradshaw in the close season and succeeded in keeping the club afloat in the top division. He also steered Arsenal to the semi-final stage of the FA Cup in the 1905–06 and 1906–07 seasons. Kelso departed in February 1908, amid uncertainty over the club's finances, and was replaced by George Morrell, a fellow Scotsman. Morrell's time as manager coincided with Sir Henry Norris' takeover of Arsenal and the club's subsequent relocation to Highbury. Arsenal were relegated to the Second Division in 1913, though the move to North London brought <b>about</b> <b>much</b> larger attendances.|$|E

25|$|The {{tracking}} of numerous cloud features allowed determination of zonal winds {{blowing in the}} upper troposphere of Uranus. At the equator winds are retrograde, {{which means that they}} blow in the reverse direction to the planetary rotation. Their speeds are from −100 to −50m/s. Wind speeds increase with the distance from the equator, reaching zero values near ±20° latitude, where the troposphere's temperature minimum is located. Closer to the poles, the winds shift to a prograde direction, flowing with its rotation. Wind speeds continue to increase reaching maxima at ±60° latitude before falling to zero at the poles. Wind speeds at −40° latitude range from 150 to 200m/s. Because the collar obscures all clouds below that parallel, speeds between it and the south pole are impossible to measure. In contrast, in the northern hemisphere maximum speeds as high as 240m/s are observed near +50 degrees of latitude. These speeds sometimes lead to incorrect assertions that winds are faster in the northern hemisphere. In fact, latitude per latitude, winds are slightly slower {{in the northern part of}} Uranus, especially at the midlatitudes from ±20 to ±40 degrees. There is currently no agreement about whether any changes in wind speed have occurred since 1986, and nothing is known <b>about</b> <b>much</b> slower meridional winds.|$|E

Dr. Mackenzie wrote that the Emperor had [...] "an almost overwhelming sense of the duties of his position". In a letter to Lord Napier, Empress Victoria wrote [...] "The Emperor is able to attend to his business, and do a great deal, but not being able to speak is, of course, most trying."

500|$|In {{terms of}} regular nuclear testing, Kittens {{represents}} bomb component testing, while Tims and Rats were early subcritical hydronuclear tests. [...] Vixen is [...] "safety testing" [...] of a bomb; assuring {{that the core}} would not accidentally undergo criticality {{in the event of}} a fire or unintended crash. These are always messy (see the US equivalent at Plutonium Valley in Project 56), for a successful test subjects the core fuel to high explosives in the hope that it simply scatters rather than undergoes criticality. The differences in the sort of dangers presented by major vs the minor tests is that there was no critical explosion in the minor tests. [...] In the major tests, the bomb cores reached critical mass; the plutonium or uranium fissile materials [...] "burned" [...] into highly radioactive fission products, and those, along with the unspent fuel and activated bomb case, tower and soil if the explosion was close to the ground, are lofted into the stratosphere to be dropped eventually as fallout globally.

According to Fanning, their relationship {{was not only a}} [...] "love match", but also a [...] "meeting of minds"; Anne Marie was a gifted artist and a [...] "strong-willed and modern-minded woman, determined to forge her own career". This determination would strain the Nielsens' marriage, as Anne Marie would spend months away from home during the 1890s and 1900s, leaving Carl, who was susceptible to opportunities with other ladies, to raise their three young children in addition to composing and fulfilling his duties at the Royal Theatre.|$|E
