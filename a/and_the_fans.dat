5|$|In 1995 {{the team}} regressed further, losing even more players to free agency and {{finished}} {{the season with a}} 5–11 record, their worst since Bill Parcells' first season in 1983. Quarterback Dave Brown was particularly disappointing, as he finished with just 2,814yards and 11 touchdowns on the season. Reeves went public with his desire to have more of a say in personnel matters. He controlled the team's free agency decisions, but feuded with General manager (GM) George Young who chose the team's draft picks.* Pervin. pg. 124 Lowlights were a 35–0 loss to the Dallas Cowboys in the Monday Night season opener, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fans</b> pelting the Charger sideline with snowballs in the season's final game.

Orton commented on every accomplishment that Flair had made and criticized him for calling Triple H the greatest wrestler of all. Flair retaliated to Orton's comments, stating that individuals like Shawn Michaels and Mick Foley, who Orton had previously feuded with, were not legends, therefore Orton was not a Legend Killer. Flair also stated that he and Orton would have a match at Taboo Tuesday <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fans</b> would {{have the opportunity to}} choose what type of match they face in. At Taboo Tuesday, Orton and Flair met in a Steel Cage match, which was the fans selection. Orton won the match after delivering an RKO to Flair. After the match, Flair shook Orton's hand.|$|E

5|$|The Jets {{opened their}} 2012 season against the Buffalo Bills with Sanchez {{completing}} 19 of his 27 passes for 266 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception in a 48–28 rout of the Bills. In the subsequent four games, Sanchez {{became the first}} quarterback since Stoney Case in 1999 to complete under 50% of his passes in four straight contests as the Jets fell to a 2–3 record. This prompted fierce criticism from the media <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fans</b> in regards to Sanchez's continued accuracy issues and prompted calls {{for the promotion of}} Tim Tebow.

25|$|One of {{the major}} reasons is the stadium's design. Originally built in a shallow sinkhole, the playing surface is below ground level.

This traps crowd noise inside the stadium, which results in sound levels on the field which have been measured at 115 decibels—just short of the threshold of pain.|$|E
