5|$|Pushing {{against an}} object that rests on a {{frictional}} surface can result in <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> object does not move because the applied force is opposed by static friction, generated between the object and the table surface. For a situation with no movement, the static friction force exactly balances the applied force resulting in no acceleration. The static friction increases or decreases {{in response to the}} applied force up to an upper limit determined by the characteristics of the contact between the surface and the object.|$|E
5|$|Sonya gives Rodya a cross {{when he goes}} to turn {{himself in}} and symbolizes the burden Raskolnikov must bear. Sonya tells him they will bear the cross {{together}} and is taking part of his burden onto herself, encouraging him to confess. Sonya and Lizaveta had exchanged crosses, so originally the cross was Lizaveta's—whom Rodya didn't intend to kill, making it an important symbol of redemption. Sonya's face reminds him of Lizaveta's face, another example of his guilty conscience and symbolizes a shared grief. Self-sacrifice, along with poverty, is a larger theme of the novel. The desperation of poverty creates <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> only way to survive is through self-sacrifice, which Raskolnikov consistently rejects, as part of his philosophical reasoning. For example, he rejects Razumikhin's offer of employment and the idea of his sister's arranged marriage. Raskolnikov originally rejects Sonya's offer to accompany him to the confession but, in a feverish state of mind, sees her following him through the market, and finds power in that idealism.|$|E
5|$|We {{consider}} {{the surface area}} of the entire mass of mercury, including {{the part of the}} surface that is in contact with the glass, because mercury does not adhere to glass at all. So the surface tension of the mercury acts over its entire surface area, including where it is in contact with the glass. If instead of glass, the tube was made out of copper, the situation would be very different. Mercury aggressively adheres to copper. So in a copper tube, the level of mercury {{at the center of the}} tube will be lower than at the edges (that is, it would be a concave meniscus). In <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> liquid adheres to the walls of its container, we {{consider the}} part of the fluid's surface area that is in contact with the container to have negative surface tension. The fluid then works to maximize the contact surface area. So in this case increasing the area in contact with the container decreases rather than increases the potential energy. That decrease is enough to compensate for the increased potential energy associated with lifting the fluid near the walls of the container.|$|E

25|$|Over time, the iqtaʿ {{system was}} expanded, and {{increasingly}} larger areas of kharaj (taxable lands) were appropriated as iqtaʿ lands {{in order to}} meet the fiscal needs of the Mamluk military institution, namely payment of Mamluk officers and their subordinates.

25|$|The speed {{lines of}} gas turbine {{centrifugal}} compressors typically exhibit choke. This is <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> pressure ratio of a speed line drops rapidly (vertically) {{with little or}} no change in flow.

Higher pressure ratio turbocharger centrifugal compressors exhibit this same phenomenon. Real choke phenomena is a function of compressibility as measured by the local Mach number within an area restriction within the centrifugal pressure stage.|$|E

25|$|Water {{scarcity}} involves water shortage, {{water stress}} or deficits, and water crisis. The relatively new concept of water stress is difficulty in obtaining sources {{of fresh water}} for use {{during a period of}} time; it may result in further depletion and deterioration of available water resources. Water shortages may be caused by climate change, such as altered weather-patterns (including droughts or floods), increased pollution, and increased human demand and overuse of water. The term water crisis labels <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> available potable, unpolluted water within a region is less than that region's demand. Two converging phenomena drive water scarcity: growing freshwater use and depletion of usable freshwater resources.|$|E
25|$|The {{extensive}} suburban {{development that}} has taken place since the 1960s in King of Prussia has led urban planning scholars like Joel Garreau to label the area as an epitome of the edge city phenomenon, <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> most vibrant economic growth and prosperity in a metropolitan area (in this case, Philadelphia) no longer occurs in the urban center, but rather at its periphery. Before 1960, the Greater King of Prussia area was known for little more than being the place of Washington's winter respite in 1777-8 (see Valley Forge National Historical Park). The growth in King of Prussia developed around the convergence of four highways with the construction of the King of Prussia Mall, a large business park, and housing developments.|$|E
25|$|Multimodality also obscures an audience’s {{concept of}} genre by {{creating}} gray areas {{out of what}} was once black and white. Carolyn R. Miller, a distinguished professor of rhetoric and technical communication at North Carolina State University observed in her genre analysis of the Weblog how genre shifted with the invention of blogs, stating that “there is strong agreement on the central features that make a blog a blog. Miller defines blogs {{on the basis of their}} reverse chronology, frequent updating, and combination of links with personal commentary. However, the central features of blogs are obscured when considering multimodal texts. Some features are absent, such the ability for posts to be independent of each other, while others are present. This creates <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> genre of multimodal texts is impossible to define; rather, the genre is dynamic, evolutionary and ever-changing.|$|E

25|$|Quartz {{belongs to}} the {{trigonal}} crystal system. The ideal crystal shape is a six-sided prism terminating with six-sided pyramids at each end. In nature quartz crystals are often twinned (with twin right-handed and left-handed quartz crystals), distorted, or so intergrown with adjacent crystals of quartz or other minerals as to only show part of this shape, or to lack obvious crystal faces altogether and appear massive. Well-formed crystals typically form in a 'bed' that has unconstrained growth into a void; usually the crystals are attached {{at the other end}} to a matrix and only one termination pyramid is present. However, doubly terminated crystals do occur where they develop freely without attachment, for instance within gypsum. A quartz geode is such <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> void is approximately spherical in shape, lined with a bed of crystals pointing inward.|$|E
25|$|In the United States {{there are}} many laws that allow the {{confiscation}} of cash and other assets from the bearer if there is suspicion that the money came from an illegal activity. Because {{a significant amount of}} U.S. currency contains traces of cocaine and other illegal drugs, {{it is not uncommon for}} innocent people searched at airports or stopped for traffic violations to have cash in their possession sniffed by dogs for drugs and then have the cash seized because the dog smelled drugs on the money. It is then up to the owner of the money to prove where the cash came from at his own expense. Many people simply forfeit the money. In 1994, the United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, held in the case of UNITED STATES of America v. U.S. CURRENCY, $30,060.00 (39 F.3d 1039 63 USLW 2351, No. 92-55919) that the widespread presence of illegal substances on paper currency in the Los Angeles area created <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> reaction of a drug-sniffing dog would not create probable cause for civil forfeiture.|$|E
25|$|According to Weinfeld, the Abraham {{covenant}} {{represents a}} covenant of grant, which binds the suzerain. It is {{the obligation of}} the master to his servant and involves gifts given to individuals who were loyal serving their masters. In the covenant with Abraham in Genesis 15, it is God who is the suzerain who commits himself and swears to keep the promise. In the covenant there are procedures of taking the oath, which involve a smoking oven and a blazing torch. There are many similarities between Genesis 15 and the Abba-El deed. Genesis 15 and similarly in the Abba-El deed it is the superior party who places himself under oath. Also the oaths in both involve <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> inferior party is delivering the animals while the superior swears the oath.
