5|$|Kanye West {{began working}} on Graduation {{immediately}} after releasing his second studio album Late Registration. By late September 2005, West had already completed three songs for the album, which he intended to contain a total of twelve tracks. Around {{the time of the}} recording of the third studio album, West would often listen to songs written by folk and country singer-songwriters Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash in hopes of developing methods to augment his word play and storytelling abilities. The former musician had been recommended to West by multiple of his friends, including English disc jockey Samantha Ronson, all of whom claimed his music and the way he dealt with the press reminded them of Dylan. Kanye also listened to his most favorite alternative rock bands, including The Killers, Radiohead, Modest Mouse, and Keane, in order to gain new ideas on how to make his hip-hop production style more stadium-friendly. Additionally, West would often test his new songs on his iPod, in his office, in dance clubs and just <b>about</b> <b>anywhere</b> people might listen to his music. He would then make adjustments to the tracks based on feedback he received, repeating the process as many times as necessary.|$|E
25|$|Free ribosomes {{can move}} <b>about</b> <b>anywhere</b> in the cytosol, but are {{excluded}} from the cell nucleus and other organelles. Proteins that are formed from free ribosomes are released into the cytosol and used within the cell. Since the cytosol contains high concentrations of glutathione and is, therefore, a reducing environment, proteins containing disulfide bonds, which are formed from oxidized cysteine residues, cannot be produced within it.|$|E
500|$|Ian Dunn from One Giant Leap {{also wrote}} positively: [...] "The series has been amazingly gripping. The {{situation}} of the show allows it to be set just <b>about</b> <b>anywhere,</b> much like Doctor Who. The plot is enticing and you really care about the characters." [...] He also commented: [...] "One intriguing thing about the series so far {{is that some of}} the scenarios have been rather adult for a show broadcast at 6pm. One episode, set in a Roman world featured a scene in a sex dungeon. Another featured Cerberus doing what all dogs do (no matter how many heads they have) and urinate on a motorbike â€“ well, half man-half motorbike." ...|$|E

50|$|Very little info on him can be <b>about</b> Kristoff <b>anywhere,</b> {{except that}} he was Spanish by birth, a martial artist (apparently holding a black belt in karate), ex-Foreign Legionnaire and had some {{legitimate}} training as an actor.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have {{you seen}} {{anything}} of a barone-looking lugger," [...] he asked, [...] "French-rigged, and French-manned, skulking <b>anywhere</b> <b>about</b> this coast?" ...|$|R
500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "C+", calling it [...] "a messy episode". He {{argued that it}} is an example of [...] "magnificently bad television". This in turn, makes it {{somewhat}} entertaining; VanDerWerff argued that he would [...] "rather watch this episode several times than I would some of those season seven outings where everybody seemed like they would rather be just <b>about</b> <b>anywhere</b> else." [...] However, he did compliment the episode's gross-out scares, noting that the beginning was [...] "a pretty great cold open". Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, was extremely critical of the episode. Referring to it as the series' [...] "nadir", he ridiculed the plot and sarcastically labeled the main villain [...] "Butt Munch". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a negative review and awarded it one star out of four. Vitaris, sardonically referring to the episode as [...] "The X(enophobic)-Files", noted that while [...] "the butt-crawler is new, the plot is pure [...] "X-Files generic Monster-of-the-Week." [...] Matt Hurwitz and Chris Knowles noted in their book The Complete X-Files that the episode soon became known as the [...] "'Butt Genie' episode" [...] among fans.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} {{also proved}} versatile, as it provided generous interior space that allowed fitting for either a transport or luxury airliner role. Having an amphibious configuration also allowed the G-21 to go just <b>about</b> <b>anywhere,</b> and [...] plans {{were made to}} market it as an amphibian airliner.|$|E
2500|$|In North America and Japan, using a {{standard}} household outlet (120-volt, 15amp breaker, 12amp maximum allowable draw, 1.4kW) and the [...] cable included by Nissan, the Leaf will regain approximately 5 miles of range per hour. This type of charging {{is ideal for}} the commuter that can plug into standard outlets {{at home and at}} work during the typical 21 hours a day that the typical North American car is parked. [...] It is also useful for emergency charging from any ubiquitous 120-volt outlet just <b>about</b> <b>anywhere</b> in North America.|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{you don't}} mind, squire, I'll take a turn with you,' said Crinkett at last; 'while Jack can sit <b>anywhere</b> <b>about</b> the place.' ...|$|R
60|$|Nevertheless, since {{clearly he}} was not <b>anywhere</b> <b>about</b> the market-hall, to the inn they all trooped, and {{deafened}} the landlady with their inquiries.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a document," [...] Estermen was saying, [...] "not a line {{of writing}} of any sort in his trunk, his bureau, or <b>anywhere</b> <b>about</b> his room." ...|$|R
60|$|Barnes, {{questioned}} on the subject, had {{no information}} to give, beyond {{the fact that}} he had not seen them <b>about</b> <b>anywhere.</b> Which was not a great help. Adair proceeded with the fielding-practice without further delay.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hardly know}} what to say. It {{would be a very}} bad match for her. You, you know, are a capital fellow; the best fellow going. There is nobody <b>about</b> <b>anywhere</b> that I like so much." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{supposed}} {{place is}} often very suppositious indeed--for clusters {{of the common}} veronicas, if luxuriant, throw their blossoms <b>about</b> <b>anywhere.</b> But {{the idea of an}} upper and lower petal is always kept in the flower's little mind.|$|E
6000|$|It was Peter's {{turn to look}} frightened, and he hastily glanced {{this way}} and that way. [...] "No," [...] he replied. [...] "Is he <b>anywhere</b> <b>about</b> here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is Amy's {{illumination}} <b>anywhere</b> <b>about?</b> I took a fancy to {{buy that}} for Father," [...] said Jo, very anxious to learn the fate of her sister's work.|$|R
6000|$|... "The other chambermaid can't be found, sir," [...] she answered. [...] "Her bed hasn't been slept in, and she doesn't {{seem to be}} <b>anywhere</b> <b>about</b> the place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have not}} got it with you?" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "You leave her keepsake lying <b>about</b> <b>anywhere?</b> Oh, Mr. Germaine, you have indeed {{forgotten}} Mary! A woman, in your place, would have parted {{with her life}} rather than part with the one memorial left {{of the time when}} she first loved!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{would come}} out to us. You will be quite safe there. If their {{soldiers}} came, they would never catch us; we could move <b>about</b> <b>anywhere,</b> we know all the places where water is to be found, and they would only die of thirst if they went after us into the desert." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am so {{accustomed}} to sleeping <b>about</b> <b>anywhere</b> that I take little or no account of thirty, forty, fifty naked fellows, lying, sitting, sleeping round me. Someone brings me a native mat, someone else a bit of yam; a third brings a cocoa-nut; so I get my supper, put down the mat (like a very thin door-mat) on the earth, roll up my coat for a pillow, and make a very good night of it. I have had deafness in my right ear again for some days; no pain with it, but it is inconvenient.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're doin' wonderfully, my boy, an' when I tell Hannah Morse, she'll be pleased, 'cause a {{speck of}} dirt <b>anywhere</b> <b>about</b> the house does fret her mortally bad." ...|$|R
60|$|The King {{looked around}} for his son Inga, but failed to find the boy among the prisoners. Nor was the fat King, Rinkitink, to be seen <b>anywhere</b> <b>about.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Right! Who says it is?--or {{who thinks}} there is {{anything}} right <b>about</b> assessments, <b>anywhere?</b> I have heard assessors, with my own ears, use such words as these:--'Sich a man is rich, and can afford to pay,' and 'sich a man is poor, and it will come hard on him.' Oh! they kiver up dishonesty, nowadays, under all sorts of argooments." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{murder of}} Morris Barnes, {{considered}} merely as an event, {{came as a}} Godsend to the halfpenny press, which has an unwritten but immutable contract with the public to provide it with so much sensation during the week, in season or out of season. Nothing else was talked <b>about</b> <b>anywhere.</b> Under {{the influence of the}} general example, Wrayson found himself within a few days discussing its details with perfect coolness, and with an interest which never flagged. He seemed continually to forget his own personal and actual connection with the affair.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then, again, {{unless a}} man can {{dispense}} with what we ordinarily call comfort or luxuries to a great extent, and knock <b>about</b> <b>anywhere</b> in Melanesian huts, he can hardly do much work in this Mission. The climate is so warm that, to my mind, it quite supplies {{the place of the}} houses, clothing, and food of old days, yet {{a man can}}not accommodate himself to it all at once. I don't say that it came naturally to me five years ago, as it does now, when I feel at home anywhere, and cease to think it odd to do things which, I suppose, you would think very extraordinary indeed.|$|E
6000|$|Gilbert Gildersleeve {{smiled a}} sickly smile. It was neck or nothing now. He must go right through with it. [...] "Oh yes," [...] he answered, with prompt conviction, playing a {{dangerous}} card well--for {{how could he}} know what name this young man Waring might possibly be passing under? [...] "The gentleman who was talking to me when you came in just now. His name's Billington--though, perhaps," [...] he added, after a pause, with a reflective air, [...] "he may have given you another one. Young men will be young men. They've often some reason, when travelling, for concealing their names. Though Billington's {{not the sort of}} fellow, to be sure, who's likely to be knocking <b>about</b> <b>anywhere</b> incognito." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, deary,' said Mrs Boffin, laying aside her shawl. 'I'm not nervous any more. I'm {{not a bit}} troubled now. I'd go <b>anywhere</b> <b>about</b> {{the house}} the same as ever. But--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Rattray!" [...] in a subdued voice--Rattray's study fronted that way. [...] "D'you know if Mr. King's <b>anywhere</b> <b>about?</b> I've got a--" [...] McTurk discreetly {{left the}} end of the {{sentence}} open.|$|R
60|$|Just {{imagine how}} Reddy felt {{when at last}} he awoke {{and there was not}} so much as a feather from a fat hen <b>anywhere</b> <b>about,</b> while his stomach fairly ached with emptiness.|$|R
60|$|The soil, however, is very rich. The pitch {{certainly}} does not injure vegetation, though plants will not grow actually in it. The first plants which caught our eyes were pine-apples; for which La Brea is famous. The heat of the soil, {{as well as of}} the air, brings them to special perfection. They grow <b>about</b> <b>anywhere,</b> unprotected by hedge or fence; for the Negroes here seem honest enough, at least towards each other. And at the corner of the house was a bush worth looking at, for we had heard of it for many a year. It bore prickly, heart-shaped pods an inch long, filled with seeds coated with a red waxy pulp.|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{daughter}} Robina," [...] I said, [...] "is {{just the}} same age--according to years; and Dick is twenty-one. I hope you will be friends with them. They have got sense, both of them. It comes out {{every now and again}} and surprises you. Veronica, I think, is nine. I am not sure how Veronica is going to turn out. Sometimes things happen that make us think she has a beautiful character, and then for quite long periods she seems to lose it altogether. The Little Mother--I don't know why we always call her Little Mother--will not join us till things are more ship-shape. She does not like to be thought an invalid, and if we have her <b>about</b> <b>anywhere</b> near work that has to be done, and are not always watching her, she gets at it and tires herself." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{social life}} {{of these people}} centred about the {{households}} of their leading men. The hall of the chief where they settled for a time was often a very capacious timber building. There were no doubt huts for herds and outlying farm buildings; but {{with most of the}} Aryan peoples this hall was the general centre, everyone went there to feast and hear the bards and take part in games and discussions. Cowsheds and stabling surrounded it. The chief and his wife and so forth would sleep on a dais or in an upper gallery; the commoner sort slept <b>about</b> <b>anywhere,</b> as people still do in Indian households. Except for weapons, ornaments, tools and suchlike personal possessions there was a sort of patriarchal communism in the tribe. The chief owned the cattle and grazing lands in the common interest; forest and rivers were the wild.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't think so,' I answered, after a moment's deliberation. 'From what I know of Mr. Ashurst, I don't {{believe it}} is likely he would have left his will <b>about</b> {{carelessly}} <b>anywhere.</b> He was a secretive man, fond of mysteries and mystifications. He would be sure to conceal it. Besides, Lady Georgina and Harold have been taking care of everything in the house ever since he died.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, this is Russia--only more so. There's not {{the shadow}} of a {{republic}} <b>about</b> it <b>anywhere.</b> There are ranks, here. There are viceroys, princes, governors, sub-governors, sub-sub-governors, and a hundred orders of nobility, grading along down from grand-ducal archangels, stage by stage, till the general level is struck, where there ain't any titles. Do you know what a prince of the blood is, on earth?" ...|$|R
50|$|The {{presence}} of these islets mean {{that there is no}} open water broader than <b>about</b> 0.8 km <b>anywhere</b> on the loch. Small boulders break the surface of the shallower sections making navigation difficult.|$|R
