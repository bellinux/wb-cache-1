5|$|Although {{the series}} fictionalises {{the world of}} MI5, several storylines are based on truth. The series had advisors who were ex-MI5 officers. The writers also {{research}} heavily on each episode. The producers were keen in world events that Britain and America were directly or indirectly responsible for, where the consequences of an operation <b>are</b> <b>worse</b> than what they intended to resolve in the first place, known as blowback. One example includes the two powers aiding the Afghan Mujahideen in 1989 before {{pulling out of the}} country; this ultimately lead to the rise of Al-Qaeda.|$|E

5000|$|Many {{contemporary}} egalitarians {{have been}} identified as luck egalitarians, believing, roughly, that it is bad when one person <b>is</b> <b>worse</b> off than another through no fault or choice of her own. Temkin argues that the egalitarian’s fundamental concern should not be with luck per se but with comparative fairness. His view is that, among equally deserving people, it is bad, because unfair, for some to <b>be</b> <b>worse</b> off than others through no fault or choice of their own. But, among unequally deserving people, it is not bad, because not unfair, for someone less deserving to <b>be</b> <b>worse</b> off than someone more deserving, even if the former <b>is</b> <b>worse</b> off through no fault or choice of her own. [...] To illustrate, egalitarians need not object if criminal John <b>is</b> <b>worse</b> off than law-abiding Mary, even if John craftily avoided capture and <b>is</b> <b>worse</b> off only because, through no fault or choice of his own, a falling limb injured him. In that case the effects of luck need not trouble egalitarians because they do not undermine comparative fairness.|$|R

The muscle weakness becomes progressively worse {{during periods of}} physical activity and improves after periods of rest. Typically, the weakness and fatigue <b>are</b> <b>worse</b> {{toward the end of}} the day. MG generally starts with ocular (eye) weakness; it might then progress to a more severe generalized form, characterized by weakness in the extremities or in muscles that govern basic life functions.|$|E
25|$|A VAT, {{like most}} taxes, distorts {{what would have}} {{happened}} without it. Because the price for someone rises, the quantity of goods traded decreases. Correspondingly, some people <b>are</b> <b>worse</b> off by more than the government is made better off by tax income. That is, more is lost due to supply and demand shifts than is gained in tax. This is known as a deadweight loss. If the income lost by the economy is greater than the government's income; the tax is inefficient. It must be noted that a VAT and a Non-VAT have the same implications on the microeconomic model.|$|E

25|$|Firstly, certain {{costs are}} {{difficult}} to avoid and are shared by everyone, such as the costs of housing, pensions, education and health care. If the state does not provide these services, then for those on lower incomes, the costs must be borrowed and often those on lower incomes are those who <b>are</b> <b>worse</b> equipped to manage their finances. Secondly, aspirational consumption describes the process of middle income earners aspiring to achieve the standards of living enjoyed by their wealthier counterparts and one method of achieving this aspiration is by taking on debt. The result leads to even greater inequality and potential economic instability.|$|E
25|$|Cholesterol ratio: This ratio {{compares the}} levels of LDL to HDL. Trans fat behaves like {{saturated}} fat by raising the level of LDL, but, unlike saturated fat, it has the additional effect of decreasing levels of HDL. The net increase in LDL/HDL ratio with trans fat is approximately double that due to saturated fat. (Higher ratios <b>are</b> <b>worse.)</b> One randomized crossover study published in 2003 comparing the effect of eating a meal on blood lipids of (relatively) cis and trans fat rich meals showed that cholesteryl ester transfer (CET) was 28% higher after the trans meal than after the cis meal and that lipoprotein concentrations were enriched in apolipoprotein(a) after the trans meals.|$|E
