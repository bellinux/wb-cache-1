5|$|Extinct North American cats {{resembling}} the cheetah had historically {{been assigned to}} Felis, Puma or Acinonyx. However, a phylogenetic <b>analysis</b> <b>in</b> 1990 placed these species under the genus Miracinonyx. Miracinonyx exhibited {{a high degree of}} similarity with the cheetah. However, in 1998, a DNA analysis showed that Miracinonyx inexpectatus, M.studeri, and M.trumani (early to late Pleistocene epoch), found in North America, are not true cheetahs; in fact, they are close relatives of the cougar.|$|E

5|$|Liu {{and colleagues}} {{conducted}} a separate phylogenetic <b>analysis</b> <b>in</b> 2017. They criticized {{the analysis of}} Rieppel and colleagues as having unnecessarily repeated several characters in their data, thus imbuing the repeated characters with undue weight in the <b>analysis.</b> <b>In</b> their own analysis, Liu and colleagues used the same source datasets, but deleted repeated characters, added two new characters from an analysis by Sean Modesto and Hans-Dieter Sues (2004), and removed poorly preserved or potentially chimeric taxa such as Cosesaurus, Kadimakara, Trachelosaurus, and Malerisaurus. Analyses based on parsimony-based and Bayesian methods found that Dinocephalosaurus {{was a member of}} the Tanystropheidae, being the sister group to a clade containing Tanystropheus, Macrocnemus, Langobardisaurus, and Tanytrachelos. The analyses also recovered a monophyletic Protorosauria, albeit to the exclusion of Prolacerta. The tree from the parsimony-based analysis is reproduced above, at right.|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} of morphological characteristics and gene sequences {{has supported the}} basal position within the genus long suspected of D.regia, often regarded as the most ancient of all extant Drosera species. Its distinct morphology and unique relict characteristics, ones it likely shared with the common ancestor of all Drosera such as the operculate pollen, led early researchers to suggest its ancient position in the genus. The first cladistic analysis based on rbcL and morphological data confirmed these ideas and suggested that D.regia formed a clade sister to all other Drosera surveyed, with Dionaeamuscipula forming a sister clade to all Drosera. Further <b>analysis</b> <b>in</b> 2002 based on the nuclear 18S rDNA, plastid DNA (rbcL, matK, atpB), and morphological data confirmed these relationships, supporting the basal position of D.regia in the genus and its close relationship with Dionaea and Aldrovanda. New <b>analysis</b> <b>in</b> 2003 revealed a close relationship between D.regia and D.arcturi, both of which clustered basally with respect to all other Drosera, suggesting a link between D.regia and all other Drosera through its relationship with D.arcturi.|$|E

At the time it was regarded as a distinct species, but by 1995 it was thought to be a hybrid, and this was confirmed by genetic <b>analysis</b> <b>in</b> 2002. In appearance it is very similar to A.sericeus, but its leaf segments are flat rather than cylindrical.|$|E

Molecular diagnostics are also used to understand the specific strain of the pathogenfor example by detecting which drug resistance genes it possessesand hence which therapies to avoid.|$|E
