5|$|A wetland reserve {{has been}} created at Heron's Green Pool on the {{opposite}} side of the causeway to the lake. <b>A</b> <b>shallow</b> pool fringed with sedges (Cyperaceae), rushes (Juncaceae) and reedgrasses (Calamagrostis) and surrounded by lightly grazed, rough grassland may also prove attractive to snipe and lapwings.|$|E
5|$|After the Pangaean supercontinent sundered {{during the}} Cretaceous period, the region {{became part of}} a {{shifting}} transition zone between <b>a</b> <b>shallow</b> inland sea—the Western Interior Seaway—and a band of plains and low hills to the west.

5|$|Behind the sea wall, {{the marshes}} were drained after the war, and reverted to farmland, but {{the bank was}} {{breached}} in the North Sea flood of 1953, returning the whole area to tidal saltmarsh dominated by sea aster.

5|$|Downbursts. When an outflow {{boundary}} forms due to <b>a</b> <b>shallow</b> {{layer of}} rain-cooled air spreading out near ground level from the parent thunderstorm, both speed and directional wind shear can result at {{the leading edge}} of the three dimensional boundary. The stronger the outflow boundary is, the stronger the resultant vertical wind shear will become.|$|E

50|$|Military {{submarines}} use several {{systems to}} communicate with distant command centers or other ships. One is VLF (Very Low Frequency) radio, which can reach a submarine either on the surface or submerged to <b>a</b> fairly <b>shallow</b> depth, usually less than 250 ft. ELF (Extremely Low Frequency) can reach a submarine at greater depths, but has a very low bandwidth and is generally used to call a submerged sub to <b>a</b> <b>shallower</b> depth where VLF signals can reach. A submarine also has the option of floating a long, buoyant wire antenna to <b>a</b> <b>shallower</b> depth, allowing VLF transmissions by a deeply submerged boat.|$|R

5|$|Nankoweap Formation {{is around}} 1050million {{years old and}} {{is not part of}} a group.

5|$|Next, the metamorphosed Precambrian {{basement}} rocks were uplifted and {{a nearly}} 500-million-year-long {{gap in the}} geologic record, a major unconformity, affected the region. Geologists {{do not know what}} happened to the eroded sediment that must have overlain the complex, but they do know that regional uplift was responsible; the area was originally below the surface of <b>a</b> <b>shallow</b> sea.|$|E
5|$|The Fukushima Hamadōri {{earthquake}} was {{succeeded by}} a number of smaller tremors; that same day, at least 11 earthquakes of magnitude3.5 Mj or higher were recorded near its epicentre. Of the series, the strongest registered at a magnitude of 5.5 Mj and occurred within 3.5hours after the initial quake. <b>A</b> <b>shallow</b> magnitude 6.0 Mw (6.4 Mj) earthquake and several smaller tremors struck the region on 12 April.|$|E
5|$|The Khewra Salt Mine is {{also known}} as Mayo Salt Mine, in honour of Lord Mayo, who visited it as Viceroy of India. The mine is a part of a salt range that {{originated}} about 800 million years ago, when evaporation of <b>a</b> <b>shallow</b> sea followed by geological movement formed a salt range that stretched for about 300 kilometers (185 miles).|$|E
30|$|However, {{in case of}} a {{permeable}} layer (sand) {{surrounded by}} impermeable barriers (shale or carbonate seal) on all sides and intact uplifting to <b>a</b> <b>shallower</b> depth, the pore pressure within this layer will be the same anywhere within its boundaries, and it is also the same before and after uplifting, while the pore pressure gradient in the uplifted part of this layer increases after uplifting because it is now at <b>a</b> <b>shallower</b> depth relative to the surface and will require heavier mud weight to drill.|$|R

5|$|The {{airframe}} {{was also}} subdivided into sections to allow {{transport by road}} or rail. The wings were of standard Junkers double-wing construction. This gave the Ju 87 considerable advantage on take-off; even at <b>a</b> <b>shallow</b> angle, large lift forces were created through the aerofoil, reducing take-off and landing runs.|$|E
5|$|The pool {{house was}} built in 1968 and is brick with wood-framed {{casement}} windows. It is a divided brick building with locker rooms on the larger west section and a refreshment area on the smaller east section. The west section has a flat roof, and the east section has <b>a</b> <b>shallow</b> hipped roof with a broad overhang. The building does {{not contribute to the}} former historic estate.|$|E
5|$|The pyramid has a T-shaped {{substructure}} with a descending corridor {{leading to}} a chamber with a gabled roof. Similarly to the main pyramid, the substructure was constructed in <b>a</b> <b>shallow</b> open pit dug into the ground before the pyramid construction started and is therefore located just below ground-level.|$|E
