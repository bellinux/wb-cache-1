5|$|All tiger sharks {{generally}} swim slowly, which, {{combined with}} cryptic coloration, may make them difficult for prey to detect in some habitats.

5|$|One of the {{advantages}} of linezolid is its high bioavailability (close to 100%) when given by mouth: the entire dose reaches the bloodstream, {{as if it had been}} given intravenously.

5|$|The 5.7×28mm SS90 {{cartridge}} was discontinued, and replaced, in 1993, {{with the}} 5.7×28mm SS190. The SS190 uses a 2.7-mm (0.11in) shorter projectile with a weight of 2.0g (31grains), which has, when {{fired from the}} P90, a muzzle velocity of roughly 715m/s (2,350ft/s).

5|$|To be most {{effective}} at controlling a pest, a biological control agent requires a colonizing ability which <b>allows</b> <b>it</b> {{to keep pace with}} changes to the habitat in space and time.

5|$|A {{communications}} variant designated Tu-142MR ("Bear J") was {{the last}} production version of the Tu-142. It was tasked with long-range communications duties with Soviet ballistic missile submarines, a role {{similar to that of}} the Boeing E-6 Mercury. The Tu-142MR differed from the ASW Tu-142s in having less-sophisticated avionics, but had a long trailing wire radio aerial to relay messages to submerged Soviet submarines in times of nuclear war. This was amongst the many distinctive features of the Tu-142MR that <b>allows</b> <b>it</b> to communicate with satellites, airborne and ground-based command posts, and submarines. The aircraft replaced the Ilyushin Il-80 in the airborne command and control role. Tu-142s are currently operated by the 76th Naval Aviation Regiment from Kipelovo. Other developments of the Tu-142 include the one-off Tu-142MRT maritime reconnaissance variant, and the unbuilt Tu-142MS missile-carrying variant.|$|E

The establishment of a cotton gin in Sáenz Peña, a town in northern Argentina, allowed Alpargatas to manufacture denim in 1968, <b>allowing</b> <b>it</b> to take advantage to fashion trends in that direction, and a new plant in Aguilares, Tucumán, <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> to create its Pampero children's footwear line in 1972.|$|R

5|$|Aerox at Destructoid {{said that}} the game {{inherits}} issues from previous Ace Attorney games, such as how evidence sometimes can only be presented when the game's script <b>allows</b> <b>it,</b> and how it sometimes is unclear how to trigger events during investigations; he did however note that these occur less frequently than in previous Ace Attorney games. Osborn criticized the cross-examinations, saying that objections that should logically be valid are sometimes not accepted by the game, and that the player often has to resort to trial and error. Meanwhile, Bryan Vore at Game Informer {{said that the}} in-game task list and new way of traveling made sure that he never felt lost during investigations, and {{knew what to do}} to proceed. Urara Honma at Famitsu also noted the hints and lower difficulty as helpful features.|$|E
5|$|Alloys of zinc {{with small}} amounts of copper, aluminium, and {{magnesium}} are useful in die casting as well as spin casting, especially in the automotive, electrical, and hardware industries. These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak. An {{example of this is}} zinc aluminium. The low melting point together with the low viscosity of the alloy makes possible the production of small and intricate shapes. The low working temperature leads to rapid cooling of the cast products and fast production for assembly. Another alloy, marketed under the brand name Prestal, contains 78% zinc and 22% aluminium, and is reported to be nearly as strong as steel but as malleable as plastic. This superplasticity of the alloy <b>allows</b> <b>it</b> to be molded using die casts made of ceramics and cement.|$|E

5|$|Compared to {{its closest}} wild cousins (the coyote and golden jackal), the gray wolf is larger and heavier, with a broader snout, shorter ears, a shorter torso and longer tail. It is a slender, powerfully built animal with a large, deeply {{descending}} ribcage, a sloping {{back and a}} heavily muscled neck. The wolf's legs are moderately longer than those of other canids, which enables the animal to move swiftly, and <b>allows</b> <b>it</b> to overcome the deep snow that covers most of its geographical range. The ears are relatively small and triangular. Females tend to have narrower muzzles and foreheads, thinner necks, slightly shorter legs and less massive shoulders than males.|$|E
5|$|Cyathus helenae is {{a species}} of fungus in the genus Cyathus, family Nidulariaceae. Like {{other members of the}} Nidulariaceae, C.helenae resembles a tiny bird's nest filled with 'eggs'—spore-containing {{structures}} known as peridioles. It was initially described by mycologist Harold Brodie in 1965, who found it growing on mountain scree in Alberta, Canada. C.helenaes life cycle <b>allows</b> <b>it</b> to reproduce both sexually and asexually. One of the smaller species of Cyathus, C.helenae produces a number of chemically unique diterpenoid molecules known as cyathins. The specific epithet of this species was given by Brodie in tribute to his late wife Helen.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{chemical}} similarity, lithium typically {{does not}} occur together with sodium or potassium due to its smaller size.

Its diagonal relationship with magnesium often <b>allows</b> <b>it</b> to replace magnesium in ferromagnesium minerals, where its crustal concentration is about 18ppm, comparable to that of gallium and niobium. Commercially, the most important lithium mineral is spodumene, which occurs in large deposits worldwide.|$|E
