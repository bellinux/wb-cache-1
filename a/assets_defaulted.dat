The one-factor model underlying the capital calculations in Basel II {{has implications for}} the distribution of average (across <b>assets)</b> <b>default</b> rates over time. One of these implications is that the average default rate in any period is probably smaller than the overall average default rate (over time and assets). The lesson for practioners is that the short-term default experience of new, very safe assets is likely to underpredict the true long-run default rate for these assets. ...|$|R

This in turn allows GE to explain liquidity and liquidity crises in equilibrium. A formal definition of liquidity is presented. When new information raises the probability a fixed income <b>asset</b> may <b>default,</b> its drop in price may be much greater than its objective drop in value because the drop in value reduces the relative wealth of its natural buyers, who disproportiantely own the asset through leveraged purchases. When the information also shortens the horizon over which the <b>asset</b> might <b>default,</b> its price falls still further because the margin requirement for its purchase endogenously rises.

40|$|We {{extend the}} {{standard}} model of general equilibrium with incomplete markets to allow for default and punishment by thinking of assets as pools. The equilibrating variables include expected delivery rates, along with the usual prices of assets and commodities. By reinterpreting the variables, our model encompasses {{a broad range of}} adverse selection and signalling phenomena in a perfectly competitive, general equilibrium framework. Perfect competition eliminates the need for lenders to compute how the size of their loan or the price they quote might affect default rates. It also makes for a simple equilibrium refinement, which we propose in order to rule out irrational pessimism about deliveries of untraded assets. We show that refined equilibrium always exists in our model, and that default, in conjunction with refinement, opens the door to a theory of endogenous assets.

40|$|Some recent {{papers have}} studied {{the link between the}} stance of {{monetary}} policy and the risktaking behavior of banks. Loose monetary policy can encourage banks to reach for yield, which will increase their share of risky assets and also induces banks to take more risks on account of a rise in asset values. On the funding side, loose monetary policy increases incentives to use more short term funding. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the evidence on the risk taking channel of monetary transmission and empirically examines the existence of the risk taking channel in Indian banking.

In this paper we discuss applications of some modern methods of non-parametric statistics to modeling loss distributions, and possibilities of using them for modeling other input variables for the purpose of arriving at an integrated company model. Several examples of inference about the severity of loss, loss distributions percentiles and other related quantities based on data smoothing, bootstrap estimates of standard error and bootstrap confidence intervals are presented.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} reduced transaction costs in the international trading of assets {{on the ability of}} governments to issue debt. We examine a model in which governments care about the welfare of their citizens, and thus are more inclined to default if a large proportion of their debt is held by foreigners. Reductions in transaction costs make it easier for domestic citizens to share risk by selling debt to foreigners. This may increase tendencies for governments to default, and thus raise their cost of credit and reduce welfare. We find that {{even in the absence of}} transaction costs, home bias in placement of government debt may persist, because in the presence of default risk the return on government debt is correlated with the tax burden required to pay the debt. Asset inequality may reduce this home bias, and by increasing foreign ownership, increase incentives for default. Finally, if foreign creditors are less risk averse than domestic creditors, there may be one equilibrium in which domestic creditors hold the <b>asset</b> and <b>default</b> risk is low, and another in which foreign creditors hold the <b>asset</b> and <b>default</b> risk is high. ...|$|R

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{developments}} in modern actuarial science has been the introduction of stochastic models. This is necessitated by the design complexity of products being offered in today 2 ̆ 7 s marketplace and the many variables that can impact the financial performance of these products. Most of the stochastic modeling {{has focused on the}} variables impacting the asset side of an insurance operation like market returns, <b>asset</b> <b>defaults</b> and interest rates. In this thesis, a stochastic model is developed for the Long-Term Care (LTC) Insurance product, focusing on the liability risks like mortality, morbidity and lapse behavior. The model tries to measure the pricing volatility of the LTC rider insurance as well as the stand-alone product, caused by the volatility in these liability risks. The stochastic process governing the model is a Markov Chain process. We first discuss the traditional deterministic pricing of Long-Term Care Insurance. An algorithm is proposed to simulate the LTC insurance process. In addition, a regression model is developed to estimate the volatility risk and thus derive a deterministic approximation to the risk-adjusted net single and level premiums. The robustness of the regression model is tested against the full simulation model, under different assumptions and changes in product design. ...|$|R

Bielecki and Jang (2006) derive optimal investment strategies for an investor allocating her wealth among a defaultable bond, risk-free account and stock, assuming constant default intensity.

Based on a broad set of European banks for the period 1996 - 2002, our study first shows that banks expanding into non-interest income activities present higher risk and higher insolvency risk than banks which mainly supply loans. However, considering size effects and splitting non-interest activities into both trading activities and commission and fee activities we show that the positive link with risk is mostly accurate for small banks and essentially driven by commission and fee activities.

We consider five categories of shareholders (managers/directors, institutional investors, non-financial companies, individuals/families, and banks), a breakdown specific to our dataset. Controlling for various factors, we find that ownership structure is significant in explaining risk differences but that such findings mainly hold for privately owned banks. On the whole, a higher equity stake of either individuals/families or banking institutions {{is associated with a}} decrease in <b>asset</b> risk and <b>default</b> risk. Also, institutional investors and non-financial companies seem to impose the riskiest strategies when they hold higher stakes. We further find no significant differences in <b>asset</b> risk and <b>default</b> risk between publicly-held and privately-owned banks. Moreover, for public banks, changes in ownership structure do not affect risk taking. Market forces seem to align the risk-taking behavior of public banks and the ownership structure is no more a determinant to explain risk differences.
