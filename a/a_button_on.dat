5|$|The Leaf's {{electric}} warning sound had to {{be removed}} for cars delivered in the U.K., as the country's law mandates that any hazard warning sound must be capable of being disabled between 11:00 pm and 6:00 am, and the Leaf's audible warning system does not allow for such temporary deactivation. For the 2014 UK model of the car, the VSP system is enabled by default, though <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> the dash permits drivers to disable the system until the next time the car is switched on.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{displayed}} on a black-and-white television screen, and the tanks are controlled by two joysticks each. Pushing both joysticks moves the player's tank forward, and pulling them both back causes the tank to stop. Pulling them in different directions or amounts causes the tank to turn in place or while moving, respectively. <b>A</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> {{the top of the}} right joystick fires a shell.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid is {{the first}} mass {{production}} car manufactured by Hyundai to include the warning sound system. In 2010 the carmaker decided to have <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> the Sonata Hybrid's instrument panel to turn the VESS on and off, but after {{the enactment of the}} Pedestrian Safety Enhancement Act of 2010, signed into law by President Obama in early 2011, and learning that the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration would not allow such switches to avoid the noise device to be turned off, Hyundai decided not to install the button, and the first Sonata Hybrids destined for the U.S. market had to be altered to remove the switch.|$|E

5|$|The rapid {{introduction}} of new types of radars working on different frequencies meant the IFF system had to respond to an ever-increasing list of signals, and the direct response of the Mk. II required an ever-increasing number of sub-models, each turned to different frequencies. By 1941 {{it was clear that}} this was going to grow without bound, and a new solution was needed. The result was a new series of IFF units which used the indirect interrogation technique. These operated on a fixed frequency, different from the radar. The interrogation signal was sent from the aircraft by pressing <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> the radar, which caused the signal to be sent out in pulses synchronized to the radar's main signal. The received signal was amplified and mixed into the same video signal as the radar, causing the same extended blip to appear.|$|E

25|$|Some {{models have}} a hush or {{temporary}} silence feature that allows silencing, typically by pressing <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> the housing, without removing the battery. This is especially useful in locations where false alarms can be relatively common (e.g. near a kitchen), or users might remove the battery permanently {{to avoid the}} annoyance of false alarms, preventing the alarm from detecting a fire should one break out.|$|E

The epitoga has evolved from the academic hood, which explains why the French academic dress does not include a hood.|$|E
25|$|In X-Men #5, it is {{revealed}} {{that in order}} for Wolverine to fully infiltrate the ranks of the vampires that were attacking Utopia at the behest of Dracula's son (when Wolverine thought the vampire virus had simply bested his healing factor), Cyclops has to infect him with nanites that are capable of shutting off Wolverine's healing factor. Cyclops can activate them by merely clicking <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> a remote control device he carries with him at all times.|$|E

25|$|Another {{option to}} share music files is to burn CDs. To do this the user needs {{to create a}} {{playlist}} with the songs the user wishes to share. If the playlist exceeds roughly twenty songs it is likely {{they will need to}} make multiple CDs. By inserting a disk into the disk drive <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> the bottom of the window should give the option to burn a disk. The files are automatically downloaded to the disk and may be uploaded onto another computer or saved as a backup for the user’s computer.|$|E
25|$|With the V70 Bi-Fuel Volvo {{continued}} {{to offer a}} factory CNG powered car. A 95-litre tank installed in the trunk allowed for a claimed range of 250km running on CNG only. Due to the bulky tank rear cargo space was considerably reduced. Drivers could choose whether their car should run on petrol or CNG {{at the touch of}} <b>a</b> <b>button.</b> <b>On</b> Bi-Fuel models the temperature gauge in the instrument cluster was replaced by a level gauge for the gas tank. Several options, such as a trip computer and sports suspension, were not available for Bi-Fuel models.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s Tyco Toys created {{a line of}} action figures called The Incredible Crash Dummies based on the {{characters}} from the NHTSA television advertisements. They were intended to fall apart {{at the touch of}} <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> their abdomens. Vehicles which could be crashed into walls and broken were also produced. Dummies and vehicles were easily reassembled. They prompted a one-hour television special, The Adventures of the Incredible Crash Dummies. Unique for its time, the cartoon was produced entirely using 3D computer animation techniques. A comic book series and a video game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy were produced.|$|E

25|$|The {{solution}} was to choose a single frequency {{for all of the}} IFF transponders to operate on, no matter what the radar system's natural frequency might be. The selected frequency was 180MHz, a little under the lowest of the existing 1.5m radars. The transponder radio was tuned only to this frequency, not the radar itself. The radar system also added a separate radio system for transmitting and receiving these pulses, the interrogator. When the radar operator pressed <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> their console, the interrogator began sending out pulses synchronised with those of the radar unit. The IFF unit in the target aircraft then responded with pulses with the same timing. The output of the interrogator's receiver was mixed with the radar's, causing the blip to extend as before. When this was added to the spiral scan display, instead of stretching the blip, the IFF signal appeared as a series of short line segments extending outward {{from the middle of the}} display, the sunrise pattern.|$|E

The only MSX console with a Famicom game {{slot in the}} MSX computer is AX330. The user can switch between MSX and Famicom modes by pressing <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> {{the back of the}} computer. The other variants, which are compatible with the Sega Mega Drive, are the AX660 and AX990. Sega Master System Pal cartridges are playable with AX660, and AX990 if together the TV Game Computer Cartridge Converter and Master System Converter are attached {{at the same time to}} the MSX AX660 or AX990 consoles, connecting the Sega Master System cartridge to the game inlet in the computer. Attaching only the Master System Converter to play Sega Master Cartridges on the AX660, or AX990 is not possible because of the inlet depth and the physical shape of the Master System Converter that prevent the converter from being attached correctly to the AX660 and AX990 computers.|$|E
25|$|The four {{remaining}} teams {{stood on}} the topmost of the four levels of the Steps of Knowledge. Olmec began the round by telling the remaining teams the episode's legend of the featured artifact, which became the theme {{for the remainder of}} the episode. The legend centered on an artifact which the winning team searched for in the final round. At the end of the legend, Olmec told the teams the room in which the artifact could be found. After finishing, he asked the teams a series of questions to test their memory. Each multiple-choice question had three possible answers. A team attempting to answer signaled by stomping on <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> their step, causing the front of the step to illuminate (if Olmec was still in the middle of asking a question, he stopped talking immediately). A team who answered correctly moved down to the next level. If a team answered incorrectly or ran out of time (three seconds after being called upon), the other teams were given a chance to answer. The first two teams to answer three questions correctly and thereby reach the bottom level advanced to the next round.|$|E

50|$|Instead of {{the black}} Porsche 928 of the first game, the player {{commands}} a red example of the just-introduced (at the time) Nissan 300ZX Z32 T-Top Turbo. Unlike the first game, the player was able to fire at offending vehicles, with some cabinets containing <b>buttons</b> <b>on</b> the steering wheel, and others having <b>a</b> fire <b>button</b> <b>on</b> the gearshift, along with <b>a</b> <b>button</b> to activate the nitrous boost.|$|R
25|$|Within most scenes, {{the player}} {{can control the}} main {{character}} by moving them around the environment; they can also hold down a button to see what thoughts are going through the character's mind, and trigger them to hear an internal monologue on that thought. When the player is near an object or another character they can interact with, they will be presented with a context sensitive icon that represents what control they need to do. These controls include pressing <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> the DualShock controller, moving the analogue sticks in a specific manner, or rotating the motion-sensitive controller in a specific way; in the version with PlayStation Move support, further actions based on the Move controllers are also present. These actions may lead to additional actions to fully complete the interaction. Some scenes impose a timer on the player, requiring them to complete the necessary actions in time to avoid the death or incapacitation of that character. In other scenes, the player does not have full control of the character but must instead be prepared to respond to these icons {{in the manner of}} quick time events, such as during a hand-to-hand fight or while driving frantically {{on the wrong side of}} the road.|$|E
500|$|Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark {{frontman}} Andy McCluskey {{recalled a}} great many people [...] "who thought that the equipment wrote the song for you", and asserted: [...] "Believe me, if there was <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> a synth or a drum machine that said 'hit single', I would have pressed it as often as anybody else would have – but there isn't. It was all written by real human beings, and it was all played by hand".|$|E
500|$|Sinclair {{took the}} view that an {{electric}} vehicle needed to be designed from the ground up, completely rethinking the principles of automotive design rather than simply dropping electric components into an established model. He believed that the motor {{was the key to}} the design. Sinclair and Curry developed a wafer-thin motor that was mounted on a child's scooter, with <b>a</b> <b>button</b> <b>on</b> the handlebars to activate it. The research got no further, however, as Sinclair's development of the first [...] "slimline" [...] pocket calculator – the Sinclair Executive and its successors – took precedence.
