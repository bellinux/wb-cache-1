40|$|Abstract The grid {{connected}} {{voltage source inverter}} is now {{the most widely used}} interface for connecting renewable power generation to the grid. Control of this device is a key aspect to ensure the performance, reliability and life span of the renewable power generation system. Conventionally, the current control of the {{grid connected}} inverter is based on the measured grid side voltage. The power and the power factor at the receiving end, which is usually defined as the point of common coupling, can be controlled accurately. This controller topology has been widely used and many control methods have been developed aiming at objectives such as increasing system stability, decreasing harmonic injection, and improving transient response of the system. However, in case of the voltage measurement is not available, i. e. a faulty voltage sensor, the conventional current control topology will be disabled for lack of information of the grid voltage. This would decrease the reliability and efficiency of the system thus should be improved. voltage-sensor-less In this research, a current control system for the grid connected inverter system not relying on the information provided by the <b>a.</b> <b>c.</b> side <b>voltage</b> sensors will be developed with compliance to the recommendations issued to the performances of the distribution generations such as the harmonic limitations and the fault-ride-through capabilities. Three problem will be addressed and solved. Firstly, the <b>a.</b> <b>c.</b> side <b>voltage</b> should be acquired without the use of <b>a.</b> <b>c.</b> side <b>voltage</b> sensors. This is achieved by adopting <b>an</b> <b>a.</b> <b>c.</b> side <b>voltage</b> estimation algorithm. Secondly, the grid connected inverter should be able to start-up without synchronising to the grid while keep the current injected in a safe range. This is achieved by the newly designed start-up process. Thirdly, the grid connected inverter should be able to ride-through grid faults and providing support to the grid. The transient response of the grid connected inverter is the key measure to define the performance. In this study, a faster symmetrical component decomposition method is proposed to improve the transient response of the current control, without relying on grid voltage sensors. The proposed system is verified by both simulation and experimental tests, with analyses and insight aiming at general applications of the proposed method and algorithms. ...|$|R
