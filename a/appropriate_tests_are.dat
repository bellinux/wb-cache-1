40|$|The {{endocrine}} system {{is essentially an}} information system of the body. The interpretation of the endocrine tests is difficult because of the complex interaction between different hormones and organs. Analysis of hormones is technically demanding because the hormone levels are usually low, and the tests are also prone to interferences. Useful results could be obtained only if the <b>appropriate</b> <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> chosen, the patient is properly prepared and the analysis is correctly performed. Unawareness of clinical or technical pitfalls may lead to failure to diagnose an important endocrine disease or unnecessary treatment of a condition which does not exist.

40|$|Abstract Background Outreach {{facilitation}} {{has been}} proven successful in improving the adoption of clinical preventive care guidelines in primary care practice. The net costs and savings of delivering such an intensive intervention need to be understood. We wanted to estimate the proportion of a facilitation intervention cost that is offset {{and the potential for}} savings by reducing inappropriate screening <b>tests</b> and increasing <b>appropriate</b> screening <b>tests</b> in 22 intervention primary care practices affecting a population of 90, 283 patients. Methods A cost-consequences analysis of one successful outreach facilitation intervention was done, taking into account the estimated cost savings to the health system of reducing five inappropriate tests and increasing seven <b>appropriate</b> <b>tests.</b> Multiple data sources were used to calculate costs and cost savings to the government. The cost of the intervention and costs of performing <b>appropriate</b> <b>testing</b> <b>were</b> calculated. Costs averted were calculated by multiplying the number of tests not performed {{as a result of the}} intervention. Further downstream cost savings were determined by calculating the direct costs associated with the number of false positive test follow-ups avoided. Treatment costs averted as a result of increasing <b>appropriate</b> <b>testing</b> <b>were</b> similarly calculated. Results The total cost of the intervention over 12 months was $ 238, 388 and the cost of increasing the delivery of appropriate care was $ 192, 912 for a total cost of $ 431, 300. The savings from reduction in inappropriate <b>testing</b> <b>were</b> $ 148, 568 and from avoiding treatment costs as a result of <b>appropriate</b> <b>testing</b> <b>were</b> $ 455, 464 for a total savings of $ 604, 032. On a yearly basis the net cost saving to the government is $ 191, 733 per year (2003 $Can) equating to $ 3, 687 per physician or $ 63, 911 per facilitator, an estimated return on intervention investment and delivery of appropriate preventive care of 40 %. Conclusion Outreach facilitation is more expensive but more effective than other attempts to modify primary care practice and all of its costs can be offset through the reduction of inappropriate <b>testing</b> and increasing <b>appropriate</b> <b>testing.</b> Our calculations <b>are</b> based on conservative assumptions. The potential for savings is likely considerably higher. </p...|$|R

The importance of selecting {{patients with a}} high pre-test probability of secondary forms of hypertension is first discussed. The laboratory tests currently used for seeking a cause of hypertension are critically reviewed, with emphasis on their operative features and limitations. Strategies to identify primary aldosteronism, the most frequent form of secondary hypertension, and to determine its unilateral or bilateral causes are described. Treatment entails adrenalectomy in unilateral forms, and mineralocorticoid receptor blockade in bilateral forms. Renovascular hypertension is also a common, curable form of hypertension, that should be identified {{as early as possible}} to avoid the onset of cardiovascular target organ damage. The tests for its confirmation or exclusion are discussed. The various tests available for the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, which is much rarer than the above but extremely important to identify, are also described, with emphasis on recent developments in genetic testing. Finally, the tests for diagnosing some rarer monogenic forms and other renal and endocrine causes of arterial hypertension are explored...|$|E

Although most children with acute {{abdominal pain}} have self-limited benign conditions, pain may be a manifestation of an urgent surgical or medical condition where the biggest challenge is making a timely diagnosis so that appropriate treatment can be initiated without any diagnostic delays that increase morbidity. This is weighed against the need to decrease radiation exposure and avoid unnecessary operations. Across all age groups, there are numerous conditions that present with abdominal pain ranging from a very simple viral illness to a life-threatening surgical condition. It is proposed that the history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies should initially be directed at differentiating surgical versus nonsurgical conditions both categorized as urgent versus nonurgent.

40|$|Hepatitis B virus (HBV) chronically infects {{approximately}} 250, 000 Canadians and 350 {{million people}} worldwide. Without intervention, approximately 15 % to 40 % of chronically infected individuals will eventually develop cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease or hepatocellular carcinoma, or require liver transplantation. The availability and {{extensive use of}} the HBV vaccine has dramatically {{reduced the number of}} incident infections in Canada and worldwide. Effective therapeutic agents have been and continue to be developed to treat chronic infection. The present review provides a comprehensive overview of diagnostic tests for HBV infection and immunity, and elaborates on HBV risk factors, vaccine prevention and therapeutic monitoring. HBV diagnosis is accomplished by testing for a series of serological markers of HBV and by additional testing to exclude alternative etiological agents such as hepatitis A and C viruses. Serological tests are used to distinguish acute, self-limited infections from chronic HBV infections and to monitor vaccine-induced immunity. Nucleic acid testing for HBV-DNA is increasingly being used to quantify HBV viral load and measure the effectiveness of therapeutic agents.

40|$|The recent {{developments}} in biological experiments have awarded the research community with valuable information, which describe finely regulated systems that govern the cell dynamics. One of the greatest challenges, however, remains to represent this extensive amount of knowledge in a proper way {{that can be used}} in simulations, and validated automatically, in order to understand the dynamics and ultimately achieve a desired behaviour for the system (cell) under control. Many tools and techniques have been proposed in the literature to address this important problem. In this research, the use of Petri nets for knowledge representation is investigated. The initial focus of this research is then to introduce a concept of consistency between Petri nets obtained from various knowledge sources. Two algorithms are provided to construct Petri net models for cell dynamics using data available in public domain biological database. The first algorithm generates a low-level model capturing protein- protein interactions and the second, produces a high-level model which describes pathway sequences and is considerably easier to analyze. <b>Appropriate</b> <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> developed to study consistency of such models. In the context of biological systems, diseases that alter cell dynamics, such as cancer, can be regarded as faults in the system, and disease diagnosis and treatment will correspond to fault detection and control.

Efficient tools and procedures are developed to achieve sensitivity analysis.

This study was undertaken to evaluate the best diagnostic approach.  PATIENTS AND METHODS— 52 patients with ReA, defined by arthritis and a symptomatic preceding infection of the gut or the urogenital tract, and 74  patients with possible ReA, defined by oligoarthritis without a preceding symptomatic infection and after exclusion of other diagnoses (UOA), were studied. The following diagnostic tests were applied for {{the identification of the}} triggering bacterium: for yersinia induced ReA—stool culture, enzyme immunoassay (EIA), and Widal's agglutination test for detection of antibodies to yersinia; for salmonella or campylobacter induced ReA—stool culture, EIA for the detection of antibodies to salmonella and Campylobacter jejuni; for infections with shigella—stool culture; for infections with Chlamydia trachomatis—culture of the urogenital tract, microimmunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase assay for the detection of antibodies to Chlamydia trachomatis.  RESULTS—A causative pathogen was identified in 29 / 52 (56 %) of all patients with ReA. In 17  (52 %) of the patients with enteric ReA one of the enteric bacteria was identified: salmonella in 11 / 33 (33 %) and yersinia in 6 / 33 (18 %). Chlamydia trachomatis was the causative pathogen in 12 / 19 (63 %) of the patients with urogenic ReA. In patients with the clinical picture of UOA a specific triggering bacterium was also identified in 35 / 74 (47 %) patients: yersinia in 14 / 74 (19 %), salmonella in 9 / 74 (12 %), and Chlamydia trachomatis in 12 / 74 (16 %).  CONCLUSIONS—Chlamydia trachomatis, yersinia, and salmonella can be identified as the causative pathogen in about 50 % of patients with probable or possible ReA if the <b>appropriate</b> <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> used. ...|$|E

These viruses are largely restricted to Europe and their vector nematodes and at-risk hosts occur widely in Europe. Plants for planting were identified as the most significant entry pathway and the probability of entry is rated as unlikely to moderately likely for ArMV and as very unlikely to unlikely for RpRSV, SLRSV and TBRV. These ratings have moderate uncertainty. The probability of establishment is rated very likely with low uncertainty. The probability of local spread by natural means is likely, with low to medium uncertainty, whereas that of human-assisted long-distance spread is unlikely to moderately likely, with high uncertainty. Potential impact is rated minimal to minor in all hosts, {{with the exception of}} ArMV in grapevine, for which it is minor to moderate. These ratings have medium or high uncertainty. The current legislation addresses only two of the many host species of these viruses, but other weaknesses were also identified.

Each project aimed to promote greater levels of understanding and inspire interest in chemistry, {{both of which are}} great challenges within the U. S. educational system. Assessment drives learning, so <b>appropriate</b> <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> essential to good courses. However, large classes often make written exams impractical. A multiple-choice test of conceptual knowledge in general chemistry was created and validated to provide the chemical education community with a reliable and functional tool that correlates with open-ended General Chemistry exams. Large classes make active-learning implementation challenging, as not all students can participate. Students in a large General Chemistry course taught via active-learning were studied through surveys and interviews. The data revealed that “silent” students are engaged in the active-learning experience, yet “vocal” students outperform silent students on measures of conceptual understanding in chemistry. The motivation behind being vocal suggested students participate in order to improve their grade, and while doing so, also see the benefit to their learning. Another mixed-methods study focused on the traditionally formatted General Chemistry Laboratories. Initial data on student expectations lead {{to the creation of a}} pilot lab section and ultimately a new format of the labs with the inclusion of a discussion session. The changes resulted in the students being better prepared, focusing on the content rather than the process of the labs, and reporting better understanding of chemistry due to labs. Two novel laboratory experiences were also developed to promote conceptual understanding, and their creation and use are outlined. The impact of a professional development program on high school chemistry courses was analyzed via interviews, teacher observations and a case study. The professional development exposed teachers to novel chemistry teaching practices of inquiry-based concept development and active-learning methods.

40|$|This work {{treats the}} thermal and {{mechanical}} performances of gas-filled, flat plate solar collectors {{in order to}} achieve a better performance than that of air filled collectors. The gases examined are argon, krypton and xenon which all have lower thermal conductivity than air. The absorber is formed as a tray connected to the glass. The pressure of the gas inside is near to the ambient and since the gas volume will vary as the temperature changes, there are potential risks for fatigue in the material. One heat transfer model and one mechanical model were built. The mechanical model gave stresses and information on the movements. The factors of safety were calculated from the stresses, and the movements were used as input for the heat transfer model where the thermal performance was calculated. It is shown that gas-filled, flat plate solar collectors can be designed to achieve good thermal performance at a competitive cost. The best yield is achieved with a xenon gas filling together with a normal thick absorber, where normal thick means a 0. 25 mm copper absorber. However, a great deal of energy is needed to produce the xenon gas, and if this aspect is taken into account, the krypton filling is better. Good thermal performance can also be achieved using less material; a collector with a 0. 1 mm thick copper absorber and the third best gas, which is argon, still gives a better operating performance than a common, commercially produced, air filled collector with a 0. 25 mm absorber. When manufacturing gas-filled flat plate solar collectors, one way of decreasing the total material costs significantly, is by changing absorber material from copper to aluminium. Best yield per monetary outlay is given by a thin (0. 3 mm) alu-minium absorber with an argon filling. A high factor of safety is achieved with thin absorbers, large absorber areas, rectangular constructions with long tubes and short distances between glass and absorber. The latter will also give a thin layer of gas which gives good thermal performance. The only doubtii ful construction is an argon filled collector with a normal thick (> 0. 50 mm) aluminium absorber. In general, an assessment of the stresses for the proposed construction together with <b>appropriate</b> <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> recommended before manufacturing, since it is hard to predict the factor of safety; if one part is reinforced, some other parts can experience more stress and the factor of safety actually drops...|$|E
