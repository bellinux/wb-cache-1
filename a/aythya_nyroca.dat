5000|$|The Lac Fitri Ramsar Site meausres [...] in {{size and}} was {{established}} on 13 June 1990. The Lake Fitri expands substantially during the rainy season, varying from year to year. Swamps encircle the lake periphery over a length of 150 km. Echinochloa stagnina, Vossia cuspidata and Nymphaea aquatica are the common vegetation types noted while Acacia nilotica and Mitragyna inermis grow in the flooded zone of the lake. The fringe land area around the lake has annual grasses and sedge. Also, as an Important Bird Area it has both breeding and non-breeding species. It is wintering ground for {{a large number of}} Palearctic waterbirds. The large number of bird species recorded here are <b>Aythya</b> <b>nyroca,</b> Balearica pavonina, Ardeola ralloides, Platalea alba, Dendrocygna bicolor, Dendrocygna viduata, Anas acuta, and Anas querquedula. It provides refuge during the drought season to Afrotropical species and elephants. It is also known as a productive fishing lake with an annual fish catch of 3,000 tonnes.|$|E
50|$|The swamp lies {{on one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} bird migration routes in the world, and over 250 species of birds have been recorded in the area, including the globally vulnerable greater spotted eagle (Aquila clanga), eastern imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca), and lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni). Records of globally near-threatened bird species at the wetland include great snipe (Gallinago media), ferruginous duck (<b>Aythya</b> <b>nyroca)</b> and pallid harrier (Circus macrourus). In addition to the great diversity of birds in the area, there are a wide variety of animals living in and around the marsh. Twenty-three species of mammals have been recorded, including jungle cat (Felis chaus) and European otter (Lutra lutra). Five species of amphibians and twelve species of reptiles have been recorded, and a two-year weekly butterfly survey found fifty-three species of butterflies in the area. The wetland lies 7 km SSW of the city of Qab Elias on the eastern edge of Mount Lebanon. The main area of reedbeds and open pools covers 253 ha, stretching east from the foot of the mountains to the Litani River in a long strip. Rain and snow falling on the high ridge of Barouk mountain to the west provide water for the wetland. Most rain falls between December and March, soaking quickly through layers of limestone in the mountains and emerging as springs in the valley floor. The water is particularly pure, as it has not been polluted by agricultural fertilizers, pesticides, etc. In recent years the marsh dried out by mid-July (with the exception of a few deep pools and ditches) and did not fill up again until January or February. However, the introduction by A Rocha's involvement of improved management techniques, such as the reduced pumping of water for irrigation of nearby farmland, and changes to less “thirsty” crops, has helped the marsh remain wet throughout the year. This has resulted in a significant increase in wintering and breeding water birds since 2002. Surrounding the open water and reed bed are areas of rough grazing, cultivated land, drainage ditches, and an avenue of trees, all adding to the diversity of habitats in the area. On the nearby mountain slopes, small wooded areas and rocky shrubland give an even greater variety of habitats and species. Behind the nearby village of Aammiq are woods where Syrian woodpecker (Dendrocopus syriacus) and Syrian serin (Serinus syriacus) can be found. In spring and summer, shrubby hillsides are home to assorted buntings, wheatears, warblers and shrikes, and rocky gorges host western rock nuthatch (Sitta neumayer) and Eurasian eagle owl (Bubo bubo). Mammals present include Caucasian squirrel, wildcat, wild boar and the elusive Indian porcupine..The Aammiq Wetland and some of the surrounding area is in the process of being declared a National Reserve. The main landowning family is fully engaged in the preservation of this very important ecosystem and initial plans to develop the area for ecotourism are underway.|$|E
50|$|Mammals:The {{following}} {{descriptions of}} mammals of the Ammiq wetlands {{have all been}} recorded by A Rocha personnel in the Aammiq region from 1997 onwards. The region covered includes not just the valley floor wetlands but also the adjacent farmlands and the slopes of Mount Barouk. In addition to these, other mammal species are probably present but {{have not yet been}} positively identified. One mammal of interest is the European otter Lutra lutra which was reported in the Aammiq wetlands prior to 1975; its reappearance was confirmed in June 2003. Water buffalos were introduced to the swamp {{in order to maintain the}} health of the vegetation cover and the swamp itself, since buffalo graze wetlands in a more efficient way than other herbivores. The mammals recorded in the region include: southern white-breasted hedgehog (Erinaceus concolor), Cape hare (Lepus capensis), Caucasian squirrel (Sciurus anomalus), Indian porcupine (Hystrix indica), gray wolf (Canis lupus), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), European otter (Lutra lutra), European badger (Meles meles), striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena), mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella), wild boar (Sus scrofa). The area was probably also the home of some extinct mammals from Lebanon such as the Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica), and the Asiatic cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus venaticus).Birds:Nearly 260 bird species have been recorded in the Aammiq region either by A Rocha personnel or people working with A Rocha from 1996 onwards. The Aammiq region includes not just the valley floor wetlands but also the adjacent farmlands and the sometimes wooded rocky slopes of Mount Barouk.The listing of these birds does not give any idea of their abundance or status. While some of the birds recorded below are residents, others are passage migrants. Some of these, such as the white stork and the lesser spotted eagle, may pass over Aammiq in flocks of hundreds at a time. Other migrants fly over in far smaller numbers. Species include: pygmy cormorant (Phalacrocorax pygmeus), white pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus), greater flamingo (Phoenicopterus rubber), ferruginous duck (<b>Aythya</b> <b>nyroca),</b> osprey (Pandion haliaetus), Verreaux's eagle (Aquila verreauxii), peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), common crane (Grus grus), rock pigeon (Columba livia).Amphibians and reptiles: The amphibians and reptiles listed below have been recorded in the Aammiq region either by A Rocha personnel or people working with A Rocha from 1996 onwards. As with the other species lists, the Aammiq region is here taken to include not just the valley floor wetlands, which are very rich in reptiles, but also the adjacent farmlands and the rocky slopes of Mount Barouk. Herpetology, the study of reptiles and amphibians, is a specialised field and as yet there has been no systematic A Rocha herpetological survey of this area. Far more species are known to exist in the area than the ones reported. Species include: European green toad (Bufo viridis), Levantine frog (Rana bedriagae), Levant green lizard (Lacerta media), European worm snake (Typhlops vermicularis), Levant viper (Macrovipera lebetina).Moths, butterflies, and dragonflies:As with many other groups, the moths of the Aammiq region are poorly known. The list below represents an incomplete and provisional list of species so far recorded, though the Aammiq region is rich in butterflies. A Rocha personnel recorded several new records of species since 1998 such as: Oriental marbled skipper (Carcharodus boeticus), swallowtail (Papilio machaon), scarce swallowtail (Iphiclides podalirius), false Apollo (Archon apollinus), large white (Pieris brassicae), plain tiger (Danaus chrysippus), long-tailed blue (Lampides boeticus). Also the Aammiq region has a surprising diversity of dragonflies which can be divided into two groups, the Zygoptera (damselflies) and the Anisoptera (the insects commonly referred to as dragonflies), species include: azure damselfly (Coenagrion puella), blue-tailed damselfly (Ischnura elegans), emperor dragonfly (Anax imperator), southern darter (Sympetrum meridionale), scarlet dragonfly (Crocothemis erythraea).|$|E

40|$|Okhla Bird Sanctuary (OBS) is an Important Bird Area, {{which comes}} under the {{protected}} area network of Uttar Pradesh with one-third area {{lying in the}} state of Delhi (India). OBS has widest flood plains along the Delhi stretch of river Yamuna and is important in conserving the ecological wealth of floodplains of the river. Rapid urbanization and industrialization and discharge of untreated wastewater into the river have resulted in deteriorated water quality. The present study focused on assessment of water quality, aquatic flora and avifaunal diversity in the OBS. Water quality was analyzed following methods of APHA. For vegetation analysis, sub-merged and free-floating plants were scooped up from five randomly selected sites. Total bird counts were conducted for water birds and species richness, evenness and Shannon-Weaver species diversity indices were calculated. Results indicate that the organic load is very high in the wetland as evident from low levels of dissolved oxygen (2. 26 ± 1. 62 mg/l) and high Biological and Chemical Oxygen Demands (15. 20 ± 3. 75 mg/l, 44. 60 ± 12. 07 mg/l). Nine species of free-floating and submerged plants were recorded; Hydrilla verticillata, Vallisneria spiralis, Azolla pinnata and Ceratophyllum demersum dominated both deep and shallow water areas. 52 species of waterbirds including four near-threatened species viz., Anhinga melanogaster, Mycteria leucocephala, Threskiornis melanocephalus and <b>Aythya</b> <b>nyroca</b> were recorded.

The current study shows the 25 common waterfowl species, their trend, phenology, and dispersion in Hungary using the data of a ten-year period between the 1996 / 1997 and 2005 / 2006 seasons. The six commonest species were: Anas platyrhynchos, Anser albifrons, Anser fabalis, Anser anser, Anas crecca and Fulica atra. During the ten-year period there were 8 species with about 1000 individuals or less (Anser erythropus, Mergus albellus, Tachybaptus ruficollis, Phalacrocorax pygmeus, Netta rufina, Podiceps nigricollis, Cygnus olor, Mergus merganser).

The valley of the Wierna Rzeka river has very natural and wild character (Fig. 2) – it forms numerous oxbow lakes resembling meanders (Fig. 3) and small ponds (Fig. 4). There are many natural habitats along the boundaries of the planned investment, especially: oxbow lakes rich in species (habitat code 3150) and plant communities of the Nymphaeion alliance and the Potamion alliance (e. g. the Nupharo-Nymphaeetum association with the dominance of the Yellow Water-Lily Nuphar luteum – Fig. 4), humid Molinia meadows of the Molinion alliance (habitat code 6410) and peat bog communities of the Scheuchzerio-Caricetea nigrae class (habitat code 7140), which forms a specifi c mosaic with bulrush communities of the Magnocaricion alliance. Many endangered and protected species of the Polish flora have been found in these plant communities, e. g. Polemonium coeruleum (Fig. 5), Drosera rotundifolia, Ophioglossum vulgatum and Succisella infl exa (Fig. 6). It is worth saying that Succisella infl exa (on a new location situated {{in the area of the}} planned investment) grows in the humid Molinia meadow, which turns into bulrush communities (Fig. 6). Unfortunately, all these natural, vulnerable characteristics of the Wierna Rzeka river valley are threatened by engineering of the river banks connected with the planned construction of a recreational-storage reservoir (Fig. 1). This kind of construction will have enormous, negative consequences for all habitats and species occurring not only along the researched river section, but also along the whole river valley. The aim of this paper is to warn about irreversible changes that will take place when the planned investment will be performed and, hopefully, to convince the decision-makers to resign from their plans. Th e latter would substantially improve the protection of nature and landscape values of the Wierna Rzeka river valley...|$|E
