However the exact role of σ-receptors is difficult to establish as many σ-agonists also bind to other targets such as the κ-opioid receptor and the NMDA glutamate receptor. In animal experiments, σ-antagonists such as rimcazole were able to block convulsions from cocaine overdose. σ-antagonists are also under investigation for use as antipsychotic medications.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{present study}} coupled {{expression}} profiling with chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to examine peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-β/δ (PPARβ/δ) -dependent regulation of gene expression in mouse keratinocytes, a cell type that expresses PPARβ/δ in high concentration. Results Microarray analysis elucidated eight {{different types of}} regulation that modulated PPARβ/δ-dependent gene expression of 612 genes ranging from repression or activation without <b>an</b> <b>exogenous</b> <b>ligand,</b> repression or activation with <b>an</b> <b>exogenous</b> <b>ligand,</b> {{or a combination of}} these effects. Bioinformatic analysis of ChIP-seq data demonstrated promoter occupancy of PPARβ/δ for some of these genes, and also identified the presence of other transcription factor binding sites in close proximity to PPARβ/δ bound to chromatin. For some types of regulation, ATF 4 is required for ligand-dependent induction of PPARβ/δ target genes. Conclusions PPARβ/δ regulates constitutive expression of genes in keratinocytes, thus suggesting the presence of one or more endogenous ligands. The diversity in the types of gene regulation carried out by PPARβ/δ is consistent with dynamic binding and interactions with chromatin and indicates the presence of complex regulatory networks in cells expressing high levels of this nuclear receptor such as keratinocytes. Results from these studies are the first to demonstrate that differences in DNA binding of other transcription factors can directly influence the transcriptional activity of PPARβ/δ. </p...|$|E
40|$|Mincle (also {{called as}} Clec 4 e and Clecsf 9) is a C-type lectin {{receptor}} expressed in activated phagocytes. Recently, we {{have demonstrated that}} Mincle is an FcRγ-associated activating receptor that senses damaged cells. To search <b>an</b> <b>exogenous</b> <b>ligand(s),</b> we screened pathogenic fungi using cell line expressing Mincle, FcRγ, and NFAT-GFP reporter. We found that Mincle specifically recognizes the Malassezia species among 50 different fungal species tested. Malassezia is a pathogenic fungus that causes skin diseases, such as tinea versicolor and atopic dermatitis, and fatal sepsis. However, the specific receptor on host cells has not been identified. Mutation of the putative mannose-binding motif within C-type lectin domain of Mincle abrogated Malassezia recognition. Analyses of glycoconjugate microarray revealed that Mincle selectively binds to α-mannose but not mannan. Thus, Mincle may recognize specific geometry of α-mannosyl residues on Malassezia species and use this to distinguish them from other fungi. Malassezia activated macrophages to produce inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. To elucidate the physiological function of Mincle, Mincle-deficient mice were established. Malassezia-induced cytokine/chemokine production by macrophages from Mincle−/− mice was significantly impaired. In vivo inflammatory responses against Malassezia was also impaired in Mincle−/− mice. These results indicate that Mincle is the first specific receptor for Malassezia species to be reported and {{plays a crucial role}} in immune responses to this fungus...|$|R

Most often amino acid side chains coordinate {{one or both of the}} two available axial coordination sites of the heme iron. Coordination of both sites, such as in cytochrome b 5, produces a good electron transfer protein but excludes the binding of <b>exogenous</b> <b>ligands.</b> In hemoglobins, coordination can occur at a single site (as in the “pentacoordinate” hemoglobins associated with oxygen transport), or at both sites (as in the “hexacoordinate” hemoglobins found in a wider distribution of organisms and functions).

Reversible coordination brings a variety of chemical features to hexacoordinate hemoglobins by affecting their affinity for ligands, redox equilibrium, and the kinetics and extent of electron transfer.

40|$|In {{the present}} contribution, we report a {{theoretical}} {{investigation of the}} magnetic properties of the dihydrogen-evolving enzyme [FeFe]-hydrogenase, based on both DFT models of the active site (the H-cluster, a Fe 6 S 6 assembly including a binuclear portion directly involved in substrates binding), and QM/MM models of the whole enzyme. Antiferromagnetic coupling within the H-cluster has been treated using the broken-symmetry approach, along {{with the use of}} different density functionals. Results of g value calculations turned out to vary {{as a function of the}} level of theory and of the extension of the model. The choice of the broken-symmetry coupling scheme also had a significant influence on the calculated g values, for both the active-ready (H-ox) and the CO-inhibited (H-ox-CO) enzyme forms. However, hyper-fine coupling-constant calculations were found to provide more consistent results. This allowed us to show that the experimentally detected delocalization of an unpaired electron at the binuclear subcluster in Desulfovibrio desulfuricans Hox is compatible with a weak interaction between the catalytic centre and <b>a</b> low-weight <b>exogenous</b> <b>ligand</b> like <b>a</b> water molecule...|$|R

At low temperature three main bands are clearly resolved; the temperature dependence of their zeroth, first and second moments sheds light on the stereodynamic properties in the surroundings of the chromophore. Within {{the limits of the}} reported analysis, in the binuclear derivatives the motions coupled to the chromophore appear to be ''essentially harmonic'' in the whole temperature range investigated; moreover the data are consistent with the presence of <b>an</b> <b>exogenous</b> <b>ligand</b> strongly bound to the two metal ions. For the mononuclear derivative an ''essentially harmonic'' behavior is evident only up to 200 K where the data are consistent with the presence of <b>an</b> <b>exogenous</b> <b>ligand</b> much less strongly bound, while at higher temperatures the behavior of the spectra indicates the onset of very large anharmonic contributions to motions, that plausibly involve the above exogenous ligand and, quite likely, the entire active site...|$|E

40|$|AbstractGlobins are {{respiratory}} {{proteins that}} reversibly bind dioxygen {{and other small}} ligands at the iron of a heme prosthetic group. Hemoglobin and myoglobin are the most prominent members of this protein family. Unexpectedly {{a few years ago}} a new member was discovered and called neuroglobin (Ngb), being predominantly expressed in the brain. Ngb is a single polypeptide of 151 amino acids and despite the small sequence similarity with other globins, it displays the typical globin fold. Oxygen, nitric oxide, or carbon monoxide can displace the distal histidine which, in ferrous Ngb as well as in ferric Ngb, is bound to the iron, yielding a reversible adduct. Recent crystallographic data on carboxy Ngb show that binding of <b>an</b> <b>exogenous</b> <b>ligand</b> is associated to structural changes involving heme sliding and a topological reorganization of the internal cavities; in particular, the huge internal tunnel that connects the bulk with the active site, peculiar to Ngb, is heavily reorganized. We report the results of extended (90 ns) molecular dynamics simulations in water of ferrous deoxy and carboxy murine neuroglobin, which are both coordinated on the distal site, in the latter case by CO and in the former one by the distal His 64 (E 7). The long timescale of the simulations allowed us to characterize the equilibrated protein dynamics and to compare protein structure and dynamical behavior coupled to the binding of <b>an</b> <b>exogenous</b> <b>ligand.</b> We have characterized the heme sliding motion, the topological reorganization of the internal cavities, the dynamics of the distal histidine, and particularly the conformational change of the CD loop, whose flexibility depends ligand binding...|$|E
40|$|Peroxisome proliferator-activated {{receptor}} γ (PPARγ) is {{the master}} regulator of adipogenesis {{as well as the}} target of thiazolidinedione (TZD) antidiabetic drugs. Many PPARγ target genes are induced during adipogenesis, but others, such as glycerol kinase (GyK), are expressed at low levels in adipocytes and dramatically up-regulated by TZDs. Here, we have explored the mechanism whereby <b>an</b> <b>exogenous</b> PPARγ <b>ligand</b> is selectively required for adipocyte gene expression. The GyK gene contains a functional PPARγ-response element to which endogenous PPARγ is recruited in adipocytes. However, unlike the classic PPARγ-target gene aP 2, which is constitutively associated with coactivators, the GyK gene is targeted by nuclear receptor corepressors in adipocytes. TZDs trigger the dismissal of corepressor histone deacetylase (HDAC) complexes and the recruitment of coactivators to the GyK gene. TZDs also induce PPARγ-Coactivator 1 α (PGC- 1 α), whose recruitment to the GyK gene is sufficient to release the corepressors. Thus, selective modulation of adipocyte PPARγ target genes by TZDs involves the dissociation of corepressors by direct and indirect mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Formulation {{of short}} interfering RNA (siRNA) into {{multicomponent}} lipid nanoparticles (LNP) {{is an effective}} strategy for hepatic delivery and therapeutic gene silencing. This study systematically evaluated the effect of polyethylene glycol (PEG) density on LNP physicochemical properties, innate immune response stimulation, and in vivo efficacy. Increased PEG density not only shielded LNP surface charge but also reduced hemolytic activity, suggesting {{the formation of a}} steric barrier. In addition, increasing the PEG density reduced LNP immunostimulatory potential as reflected in cytokine induction both in vivo and in vitro. Higher PEG density also hindered in vivo efficacy, presumably due to reduced association with apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a protein which serves as an endogenous targeting ligand to hepatocytes. This effect could be overcome by incorporating <b>an</b> <b>exogenous</b> targeting <b>ligand</b> into the highly shielded LNPs, thereby circumventing the requirement for ApoE association. Therefore, these studies provide useful information for the rational design of LNP-based siRNA delivery systems with an optimal safety and efficacy profile...|$|R

More importantly, SB-RI and CD 36, which are homologous to SCARB 2, have so far been shown to transport cholesterol and fatty-acids, respectively (Neculai et al., 2013). SCARB 2, however, hasn’t been demonstrated to possess the ability of binding and/or delivering lipid despite containing a large cavity that might accommodate lipid ligands.

This question can be addressed by studying NO binding to the myoglobin cavity mutant H 93 G, where the proximal histidine has been replaced by glycine. When this protein is expressed in the presence of imidazole (Im), an imidazole molecule occupies the proximal cavity and serves as a ligand to the iron [Barrick, D.

Although several fatty acids and their derivatives are known to bind and activate PPARγ, {{the nature of the}} endogenous ligand(s) promoting the early stages of adipocyte differentiation has remained enigmatic. Previously, we showed that lipoxygenase (LOX) activity is involved in activation of PPARγ during the early stages of adipocyte differentiation. Of the seven known murine LOXs, only the unconventional LOX epidermis-type lipoxygenase 3 (eLOX 3) is expressed in 3 T 3 -L 1 preadipocytes. Here, we show that forced expression of eLOX 3 or addition of eLOX 3 products stimulated adipogenesis under conditions that normally require <b>an</b> <b>exogenous</b> PPARγ <b>ligand</b> for differentiation. Hepoxilins, a group of oxidized arachidonic acid derivatives produced by eLOX 3, bound to and activated PPARγ. Production of hepoxilins was increased transiently during the initial stages of adipogenesis. Furthermore, small interfering RNA-mediated or retroviral short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of eLOX 3 expression abolished differentiation of 3 T 3 -L 1 preadipocytes. Finally, we demonstrate that xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and eLOX 3 synergistically enhanced PPARγ-mediated transactivation. Collectively, our results indicate that hepoxilins produced by the concerted action of XOR and eLOX 3 may function as PPARγ activators capable of promoting the early PPARγ-dependent steps in the conversion of preadipocytes into adipocytes...|$|R

The role of apoE was investigated using both in vitro studies employing recombinant apoE and in vivo studies in wild-type and apoE−/− mice.

However, the specific set of genes regulated by each E 2 F remains to be characterized. To gain insight into the molecular pathways regulated by E 2 F 2, we have analyzed the proteome of antigen receptor–activated T cells lacking E 2 F 2. We report that loss of E 2 F 2 results in a deregulated Aryl-hydrocarbon-receptor pathway. Proliferating E 2 F 2 −/− T lymphocytes expressed significantly higher levels of Aip, Ahr, and Arnt relative to wild-type (WT) 1 controls. The mechanism for increased levels of Aip appears straightforward, involving direct regulation of the Aip gene promoter by E 2 F 2. Although the Ahr and Arnt promoters also bind E 2 F 2, their regulation appears to be more complex. Nevertheless, exposure to the environmental xenobiotic 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), <b>a</b> well-known <b>exogenous</b> <b>ligand</b> of the Ahr pathway, led to overexpression of the Ahr target gene Cyp 1 a 1, and to increased sensitivity to TCDD-triggered apoptosis in E 2 F 2 −/− T cells compared with WT controls.

To further study this, we generated transgenic mice expressing PPARα in the proximal tubule {{under the control of the}} promoter of KAP 2 (kidney androgen-regulated protein 2). Segment-specific upregulation of PPARα expression by testosterone treatment of female transgenic mice improved kidney function during cisplatin or ischemia–reperfusion-induced acute kidney injury. Ischemia–reperfusion injury or treatment with cisplatin in wild-type mice caused inhibition of fatty-acid oxidation, reduction of mitochondrial genes of oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial DNA, fatty-acid metabolism, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Similar injury in testosterone-treated transgenic mice resulted in amelioration of these effects. Similarly, there were increases in the levels of 4 -hydroxy- 2 -hexenal-derived lipid peroxidation products in wild-type mice, which were also reduced in the transgenic mice. Similarly, necrosis of the S 3 segment was reduced in the two injury models in transgenic mice compared to wild type. Our results suggest proximal tubule PPARα activity serves as a metabolic sensor.

We found that hecate mutant embryos exhibit a nearly 10 -fold increase in the frequency of intracellular Ca 2 + transients normally present in the enveloping layer during the blastula stages. Inhibition of Ca 2 + release leads to ectopic expression of dorsal genes in mutant embryos suggesting that Ca 2 + transients are important in mediating dorsal gene expression. Inhibition of Ca 2 + release also results in the expression of dorsal-specific genes in the enveloping layer in a β-catenin-independent manner, which suggests an additional function for the Ca 2 + transients in this cellular layer. The mutant phenotype can be reversed by the expression of factors that activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling, suggesting that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, at least as activated by <b>an</b> <b>exogenous</b> Wnt <b>ligand,</b> is intact in hec mutant embryos. Our results are consistent with a role for the hecate gene in the regulation of Ca 2 + release during the cleavage stages, which in turn influences dorsal gene expression in both marginal cells along the dorsoventral axis and in the enveloping layer...|$|R

Moreover, a third, huge cavity (volume approximately 290 Å 3) connecting both sides of the heme, is open towards the exterior and provides a potential passageway for ligands.

We describe an experimental {{model in which}} an initial, apparently antigen-independent binding step is followed by ligation of the TCR. The model is the polyclonal response to mAb to the CD 3 portion of the TCR complex. Epidermal and thymic dendritic cells utilize low levels of Fc receptors to present the anti-CD 3 mAb and induce mitogenesis. Within 3 h of coculture, most of the dendritic cells have formed clusters with the resting T lymphocytes, and these clusters are the site for subsequent DNA synthesis and cell growth. However, the binding of dendritic cells to T cells proceeds as efficiently {{in the absence of}} anti-CD 3 as in its presence, and anti-FcR mAb does not block. CD 3 and Fc receptors are essential for the subsequent mitogenesis response in dendritic-T cell clusters. Because <b>an</b> <b>exogenous</b> <b>ligand</b> for the TCR {{does not seem to be}} required for the extensive polyclonal clustering of resting lymphocytes to dendritic cells, we suggest that an antigen-independent mechanism mediates the initial interaction.

An aspartic acid-to-lysine change at position 84 (D 84 K) of ecotropic Moloney MLV Env abolishes virus binding and infection. We recently identified lysine 234 (rK 234) in mATRC 1 as a residue that influences virus binding and infection. Here we show that D 84 K virus infection increased 3, 000 -fold on cells expressing receptor with an rK 234 A change and 100, 000 -fold on cells expressing an rK 234 D change. The stronger complementation of D 84 K virus infection by rK 234 D than by the rK 234 A receptor suggests that although the major reason for loss of infection of D 84 K and D 84 R virus is due to steric hindrance and charge repulsion, the loss of an interaction of D 84 with receptor appears to contribute as well. Taken together, these results indicate that D 84 is very close to rK 234 of mATRC 1 in the bound complex and there is likely an interaction between them.

Resonance Raman spectroscopy showed that the stabilization of <b>an</b> <b>exogenous</b> heme <b>ligand,</b> such as CO, occurs differently in human cytoglobin in comparison with Antarctic fish cytoglobins. Furthermore, while it has been extensively reported that human cytoglobin is essentially monomeric and can form an intramolecular disulfide bridge that can influence the ligand binding kinetics, 3 D modeling of the Antarctic fish cytoglobins indicates that the cysteine residues are too far apart to form such an intramolecular bridge. Moreover, gel filtration and mass spectrometry reveal the occurrence of non-covalent multimers (up to pentamers) in the Antarctic fish cytoglobins that are formed at low concentrations. Stabilization of these oligomers by disulfide-bridge formation is possible, but not essential. If intermolecular disulfide bridges are formed, they influence the heme-pocket structure, as is shown by EPR measurements...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRecent {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that autocrine signaling through epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) might be involved in generating or maintaining an intrinsic polarity in tissue cells, possibly via spatial localization of EGFR-mediated signaling. The difficulty of experimental investigation of autocrine signaling makes especially valuable an application of computational modeling for critical hypotheses about the dynamic operation of the underlying signaling circuits, both intracellular and extracellular. Toward this end, we develop and analyze here a spatially distributed dynamic computational model of autocrine EGFR signaling. Under certain conditions, the model spontaneously evolves into a state wherein sustained signaling is spatially localized on smaller than cell dimension, conferring a polarity to the otherwise nonpolar model cell. Conditions of a sufficiently large rate of autocrine EGFR ligand release and of <b>a</b> sufficiently small <b>exogenous</b> <b>ligand</b> concentration are qualitatively consistent with experimental observations of EGFR-mediated migration. Thus, computational analysis supports the concept that autocrine EGFR signaling circuits could play a role in helping generate and/or maintain an intrinsic cell spatial polarity, possibly related to migration as well as tissue organization. We additionally offer particular suggestions for critical nodes in the EGFR signaling circuits governing this self-organization capability...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNeuroglobin (Ngb) is a monomeric protein that, {{despite the}} small {{sequence}} similarity with other globins, displays the typical globin fold. In {{the absence of}} exogenous ligands, the ferric and the ferrous forms of Ngb are both hexacoordinated to the distal and proximal histidines. In the ferrous form, oxygen, nitric oxide or carbon monoxide can displace the distal histidine, yielding a reversible adduct. Crystallographic data show that the binding of <b>an</b> <b>exogenous</b> <b>ligand</b> is associated to structural changes involving heme sliding and a topological reorganization of the internal cavities. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in solution show that the heme oscillates between two positions, much as the ones observed in the crystal structure, although the occupancy is different. The simulations also suggest that ligand binding in solution can affect the flexibility and conformation of residues connecting the C and D helices, {{referred to as the}} CD corner, which is coupled to the configuration adopted by the distal histidine. In this study, we report the results of 30 ns MD simulations of CO-bound Ngb in the crystal. Our goal was to compare the protein dynamical behavior in the crystal with the results supplied by the previous MD simulation of CO-bound Ngb in solution and the x-ray experimental data. The results show that the different environments (crystal or solution) affect the dynamics of the heme group and of the CD corner...|$|E

40|$|Neuroglobin (Ngb), a {{globular}} heme protein {{expressed in}} the brain of vertebrates, binds oxygen reversibly, with an affinity comparable to myoglobin (Mb). Despite low sequence identity, the overall 3 D fold of Ngb and Mb is very similar. Unlike in Mb, in Ngb the sixth coordination position of the heme iron is occupied by the distal histidine, {{in the absence of}} <b>an</b> <b>exogenous</b> <b>ligand.</b> Endogenous ligation has been proposed as a unique mechanism for affinity regulation and ligand discrimination in heme proteins. This peculiarity might be related to the still-unknown physiological function of Ngb. Here, we present the x-ray structure of CO-bound ferrous murine Ngb at 1. 7 Å and a comparison with the 1. 5 -Å structure of ferric bis-histidine Ngb. We have also used Fourier transform IR spectroscopy of WT and mutant CO-ligated Ngb to examine structural heterogeneity in the active site. Upon CO binding, the distal histidine retains (by and large) its position, whereas the heme group slides deeper into a preformed crevice, thereby reshaping the large cavity (≈ 290 Å 3) connecting the distal and proximal heme sides with the bulk. The heme relocation is accompanied by a significant decrease of structural disorder, especially of the EF loop, which may be the signal whereby Ngb communicates hypoxic conditions. This unexpected structural change unveils a heme-sliding mechanism of affinity control that may be of significance to understanding Ngb's role in the pathophysiology of the brain...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Hexacoordinate hemoglobins {{are found}} in many living organisms ranging from prokaryotes to plants and animals. They are named “hexacoordinate ” because of {{reversible}} coordination of the heme iron by a histidine side chain located in the heme pocket. This endogenous coordination competes with <b>exogenous</b> <b>ligand</b> binding and causes multiphasic relaxation time courses following rapid mixing or flash photolysis experiments. Previous rapid mixing studies have assumed a steady-state relationship between hexacoordination and <b>exogenous</b> <b>ligand</b> binding that does not correlate with observed time courses fo...|$|R
