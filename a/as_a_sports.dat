In January 2007, he held talks with his {{previous}} club, Anorthosis, but the transfer never materialised. In an interview in August 2007 Kinkladze's former international teammate Malkhaz Asatiani confirmed that Kinkladze had finished his career and settled in Moscow.

Encouraged by his former headmaster, who had {{prompted}} his interest in writing, Fingleton quickly eased into his new career. Fingleton started <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>sports</b> reporter, and had a narrow escape when he was sacked by Robert Clyde Packer for breaking a pot, but then reinstated. Fingleton then risked being fired by removing cricket articles written by the famed Neville Cardus from the newspaper's archive against policy for his personal use.|$|E

5|$|After being let go by Bordeaux, Valbuena put his {{ambitions of}} {{becoming}} a professional player on hold, and was recommended by Garcia to play for amateur club Langan-Castets in the Championnat de France amateur 2, the fifth division of French football. Unlike at Bordeaux where he trained numerous times a week, Valbuena only trained {{three times a week}} with Langon-Castets and, due to the club's amateur status, worked <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>sports</b> shop salesman when he was not playing football. In his only season at the club, he impressed with his technical ability and was subsequently recruited by Championnat National club Libourne Saint-Seurin who had scouted the player eight times while he was at Langon-Castets.|$|E
5|$|After his cricket career ended, Halcombe had a {{successful}} career <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>sports</b> broadcaster. In 1947 he was appointed as the sports supervisor for the Australian Broadcasting Commission in Perth. He was Western Australia's first full-time sports broadcaster, a state that he filled {{until his retirement in}} 1968. Halcombe won a strong personal following for his flamboyant description of cricket and Australian rules football matches. Halcombe also conducted regular segments on his Saturday sports programs such as Strange but True and People I Met This Week. Halcombe developed a reputation as a raconteur and had a habit of rummaging through old newspapers in search of sporting items. Halcombe travelled widely throughout the state to interview notable sports personalities and presented his broadcasts in a distinctive humorous style. He was particularly remembered for his commentary partnerships with Johnnie Moyes and Englishman Arthur Gilligan during English tours to Australia.|$|E

5|$|Gatorade, {{now owned}} by PepsiCo, is today sold in some eighty {{countries}} and over fifty various flavors. In contrast to the forty-three dollars that Cade and his team spent {{to make the first}} experimental batch of Gatorade in 1965, Gatorade prompted the evolution of a multibillion-dollar sports drink industry in the years that followed; as of 2007, over seven billion bottles of Gatorade were being sold annually in the United States. While he was surprised by its commercial success <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>sports</b> drink, Cade took greater pride in Gatorade's use in hospitals, in post-operative recovery and to treat diarrhea-related dehydration in infants and young children. Cade's other research included hypertension, exercise physiology, autism, schizophrenia and kidney disease. His research into carbo-loading substantiated the early claims of Swedish researchers, and he also invented a hydraulic football helmet that substantially reduced the risk of concussion to football players.|$|E
5|$|Hammond {{was married}} twice, divorcing {{his first wife}} in acrimonious circumstances, and had a {{reputation}} for infidelity. His relationships with other players were difficult; team-mates and opponents alike found him hard to get along with. He was unsuccessful in business dealings and failed to establish a successful career once he retired from cricket. He moved to South Africa in the 1950s in an attempt to start a business, but this came to nothing. As a result, he and his family struggled financially. Shortly after beginning a career <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>sports</b> administrator, he was involved in a serious car crash in 1960 which left him frail. He {{died of a heart attack}} in 1965.|$|E
5|$|In early 2014, {{the owner}} of the club, the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research gave the project of {{building}} a new sports city to the Spanish company TriArena. They are constructing a main football stadium with a capacity of 16,000 spectators and an area of 71,150 m². The project also includes two tennis courts, a basketball court, a volleyball court, a fustal pitch, a handball court, a hotel, restaurants, and a covered swimming pool. Al-Talaba is defined <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>sports</b> club, not just a football one, and it has supported other sports at minor level only in the past. The foundation stone was laid by the former minister of higher education and scientific research, Ali al-Adeeb, in February 2014. The cost of the project is estimated to be $84 million and the duration of construction was expected to be 30 months, meaning that by 2017 the Al-Talaba Sports City should be open. Due to the financial crisis in Iraq, the project was scratched after spending $4 million on designs.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, the {{legality}} of DFS has been determined on a state-by-state basis based on local gambling laws and other rulings. The federal Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIEGA) contains language dictating that fantasy sports are not considered an unlawful wager under the act; however, the act only prohibits the electronic transfer of funds from unlawful gambling as defined under state laws. A number of state attorneys general have issued opinions concluding that DFS {{is a form of}} illegal gambling, while the state of Nevada declared that DFS games must be licensed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>sports</b> pool. The New York State ruling, which resulted from an investigation of DFS services after it was alleged that employees working for DraftKings and FanDuel had used inside information to win cash prizes from each other, spawned retaliatory lawsuits from the companies which alleged that the rulings were the result of a misinterpretation of the nature of their services. The state has since joined other states, such as Massachusetts and Virginia, in choosing to legalize and regulate DFS rather than prohibit it.|$|E
5|$|Rollason {{continued}} {{to aspire to}} a career in broadcasting, and while still teaching did screen tests for BBC Wales and BBC South, but she was unsuccessful in both auditions. In 1980, she took a holiday job as a volunteer presenter at Basildon Community Radio after seeing an advertisement in Basildon town centre and offering her services to them. A year later she joined the team of Essex Radio <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>sports</b> reporter when the commercial station went on air. She was subsequently appointed as the station's deputy sports editor. Three years later she became a producer-director for Cheerleader Productions, making sports content for Channel 4. Among the events for which she helped to provide coverage were {{the final of the}} 1984 Davis Cup, held in Sweden, and Super Bowl XIX, which took place in 1985. Additionally, she worked on the US Masters and US Open.|$|E
5|$|The photographers in 1999, 2001, 2003 and 2004 were {{respectively}} Antoine Verglas, James Porto, Michael Zeppetello and Steven White for the Swimsuit Issue works.

No body painting pictures have been chosen as the main image {{on the cover of}} the Swimsuit Issue. However, in the 2005 Swimsuit Issue (pictured left) in which Carolyn Murphy is the cover model, Jessica White was shown as an inset on the cover in a Miami Dolphins jersey body painting by Gair. Thus, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Sports</b> Illustrated Swimsuit Issue photographer Gair debuted on the cover in a sense. In 2006 a small cropped portion of her photograph of a bodypainting of Klum appeared in an inset on the cover, but no bodypainting was apparent.|$|E

5|$|Wellsway School is an 11–18, mixed {{comprehensive}} school {{which was established}} in 1971, by amalgamating Keynsham Grammar School and Wellsway County Secondary School both of which opened on a shared site in the mid-1950s. Most students that attend the school live in Keynsham and Saltford or the nearby villages. As of 2007, approximately 1350 students attend the school, ranging in age of 11–18, with 64% achieving 5 or more A-C grades at GCSE. Wellsway's bid for specialist school status was accepted in September 2007. Meaning that Wellsway School now specialises <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Sports</b> and Science College. This means the School has joined the national network of specialist schools, resulting in every school in Bath and North East Somerset now having a specialism. A joint bid is unusual as there are only six {{schools in the country}} with a combined Sports and Science specialism.|$|E
