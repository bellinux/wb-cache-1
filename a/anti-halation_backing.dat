50|$|Cinestill Film {{converts}} the Kodak {{motion picture}} cinema film {{by removing the}} Remjet backing, a separate <b>Anti-halation</b> <b>backing</b> used to protect the film in motion picture cameras. Due to the removal of this <b>anti-halation</b> <b>backing,</b> Cinestill Film exhibits a glowing effect on the image in areas with strong highlights.|$|E
5000|$|Backing removal: An {{alkaline}} bath softens the {{cellulose acetate}} phthalate binder. A spray wash and buffer removes the rem-jet <b>anti-halation</b> <b>backing.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{emulsion}} {{is attached}} to the film base with a transparent adhesive called the subbing layer. On the back of the base is a layer called the <b>anti-halation</b> <b>backing,</b> which usually contains absorber dyes or a thin layer of silver or carbon (called rem-jet on color negative stocks). Without this coating, light not absorbed by the emulsion and passing into the base would be partly reflected back at the outer surface of the base, re-exposing the emulsion in less focused form and thereby creating halos around bright points and edges in the image. The <b>anti-halation</b> <b>backing</b> can also serve to reduce static buildup, which could be a significant problem with early black-and-white films. The film, running through a motion picture camera at 12 in (early silent speed) to 18 in (sound speed) per second, could build up enough static electricity to cause sparks bright enough to record their own forms on the film; <b>anti-halation</b> <b>backing</b> solved this problem.|$|E
50|$|This {{effect is}} {{particularly}} pronounced in motion picture cameras. These cameras {{are subject to}} the constant motion of film being dragged through the film gate, so most motion picture cameras have film movements made or plated with wear-resistant alloys such as hard chrome. Given such a relatively reflective pressure plate behind the film, many motion picture films use an <b>anti-halation</b> (and anti-static) <b>backing.</b>|$|R
50|$|A Lippmann {{plate is}} a clear glass plate (having no <b>Anti-halation</b> <b>backing),</b> coated with an almost {{transparent}} (very low silver halide content) emulsion of extremely fine grains, typically 0.01 to 0.04 micrometres in diameter.Consequently, Lippmann plates have an extremely high resolving power exceeding 400 lines/mm.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>anti-halation</b> <b>backing</b> is a layer {{found in}} most {{photographic}} films. It is usually a coating {{on the back of}} the film base, but sometimes it is incorporated between the light-sensitive emulsion and the base. The light that passes through the emulsion is absorbed by the anti-halation layer. This prevents any light from being reflected back through the emulsion from the rear surface of the base, or from anything behind the film, such as the pressure plate of the camera, and causing a halo-like effect around bright points or edges in the image.|$|E
5000|$|A {{piece of}} film {{consists}} of a light-sensitive emulsion applied to a tough, transparent base, sometimes attached to <b>anti-halation</b> <b>backing</b> or [...] "rem-jet" [...] layer (now only on camera films). Originally the highly flammable cellulose nitrate was used. In the 1930s, film manufacturers introduced [...] "safety film" [...] with a cellulose triacetate plastic base. All amateur film stocks were safety film, {{but the use of}} nitrate persisted for professional releases. Kodak discontinued the manufacture of nitrate base in 1951, and the industry transitioned entirely to safety film in 1951 in the United States and by 1955 internationally. Since the late 1990s, almost all release prints have used polyester film stock.|$|E
