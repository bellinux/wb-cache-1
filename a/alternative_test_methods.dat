40|$|The {{reliability}} of {{printed circuit boards}} under dynamic loads is a key issue in the handheld electronic products industry. In order to predict {{the performance of the}} boards in their application lifetime, different tests were developed. The current industry-wide standard <b>testing</b> <b>method</b> is a board level drop test. In this test, the boards are dropped under defined conditions until a failure in the board is detected. The main failure driver is a flexural oscillation of the board due to the impact event. As this <b>test</b> <b>method</b> has a number of drawbacks, an <b>alternative</b> <b>test</b> <b>method</b> was evaluated in this study. A board level cyclic bend test was used and the results of both tests were compared. A very good correlation between the methods could be observed, supporting the suitability of the board level cyclic bend test for the determination of the drop test performance.
