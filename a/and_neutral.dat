5|$|Most {{tropical}} cyclones form on {{the side}} of the subtropical ridge closer to the equator, then move poleward past the ridge axis before recurving north and northeast into the main belt of the Westerlies.

During El Niño years, the break in the subtropical ridge tends to lie near 130°E, which would favor the Japanese archipelago. During La Niña years, the formation of tropical cyclones, and the subtropical ridge position, shift westward across the western Pacific Ocean, which increases the landfall threat to China and greater intensity to Philippines. Those that form near the Marshall Islands find their way to Jeju Island, Korea.|$|E
5|$|Nelson {{returned}} to operate out of Genoa, intercepting and inspecting merchantmen and cutting-out suspicious vessels in both enemy <b>and</b> <b>neutral</b> harbours. Nelson formulated ambitious plans for amphibious landings and naval assaults to frustrate {{the progress of}} the French Army of Italy that was now advancing on Genoa, but could excite little interest in Hotham. In November Hotham was replaced by Sir Hyde Parker but the situation in Italy was rapidly deteriorating: the French were raiding around Genoa and strong Jacobin sentiment was rife within the city itself. A large French assault at the end of November broke the allied lines, forcing a general retreat towards Genoa. Nelson's forces were able to cover the withdrawing army and prevent them from being surrounded, but he had too few ships and men to materially alter the strategic situation, and the British were forced to withdraw from the Italian ports. Nelson {{returned to}} Corsica on 30 November, angry and depressed at the British failure and questioning his future in the navy.|$|E

5|$|There {{are three}} types of Force powers; light, dark <b>and</b> <b>neutral.</b> Light Force powers provide nonviolent {{advantages}} such as being able to restore health or persuade enemies to ignore the player. Dark Force powers are violent and give the ability to throw objects or choke enemies. Neutral powers enhance athletic abilities such as being able to jump higher or run faster. There are fourteen powers in total, four of each type and a bonus power in each light and dark if the Jedi stays true to that path. Players earn stars to allocate toward Force powers by completing specific levels. By finding all the secrets in a level, players can also gain one bonus star to use. Between levels, the player can choose which Force powers to enhance by allocating stars to that power. Stars cannot be reclaimed from powers later on.|$|E

40|$|The {{sputtering}} {{effects of}} plasma-related ion-surface interactions {{have been investigated}} by measuring the energy distributions of ions <b>and</b> <b>neutrals</b> sputtered by low energy ( silicon. The energy distributions of both the sputtered ions <b>and</b> <b>neutrals</b> was performed by a combination quadrupole mass spectrometry and time-of-flight analysis. The energy distributions for secondary ions were obtained for both monatomic silicon and monatomic copper. The energy distributions for neutral copper atoms are also reported. The energy analysis of the sputtered secondary ions and atoms can be explained {{in the context of}} a linear collision cascade model. The high energy tall of the energy spectra can be fitted to an E"-"n power dependence with the value of n increasing as the primary ion energy drops. The ability of the system to measure both sputtered ions <b>and</b> <b>neutrals</b> enabled the ionisation probability, i. e. the variation of the ionisation fraction with exiting kinetic energy to be obtained.
