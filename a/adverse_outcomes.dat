40|$|OBJECTIVES: Management of anticoagulated {{patients}} after {{head injury}} is unclear {{due to lack}} of robust evidence. This study aimed to determine the <b>adverse</b> <b>outcome</b> rate in these patients and identify risk factors associated with poor outcome. DESIGN: Multicentre, observational study using routine patient records. SETTING: 33 emergency departments in England and Scotland. PARTICIPANTS: 3566 adults (aged ≥ 16  years) who had suffered blunt head injury and were currently taking warfarin. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measure was rate of <b>adverse</b> <b>outcome</b> defined as death or neurosurgery following initial injury, clinically significant CT scan finding or reattendance with related complication within 10  weeks of initial hospital attendance. Secondary objectives included identifying risk factors for <b>adverse</b> <b>outcome</b> using univariable and multivariable analyses. RESULTS: Clinical data available for 3534 / 3566 patients (99. 1 %), median age 79  years; mean initial international normalised ratio (INR) 2. 67 (SD 1. 34); 81. 2 % Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 15 : 59. 8 % received a CT scan with significant head injury-related finding in 5. 4 % (n= 208); 0. 5 % underwent neurosurgery; 1. 2 % patients suffered a head injury-related death. Overall <b>adverse</b> <b>outcome</b> rate was 5. 9 % (95 % CI 5. 2 % to 6. 7 %). Patients with GCS= 15 and no associated symptoms had lowest risk of <b>adverse</b> <b>outcome</b> (risk 2. 7 %; 95 % CI 2. 1 to 3. 6). Patients with GCS= 15 multivariable analysis (using imputation) found risk of <b>adverse</b> <b>outcome</b> to increase when reporting at least one associated symptom: vomiting (relative risk (RR) 1. 8; 95 % CI 1. 0 to 3. 4), amnesia (RR 3. 5; 95 % CI 2. 1 to 5. 7), headache (RR 1. 3; 95 % CI 0. 8 to 2. 2), loss of consciousness (RR 1. 75; 95 % CI 1. 0 to 3. 0).

The outcome measure was "severe adverse outcome" defined as death before discharge or severe neurological injury on cranial ultrasound. The adjusted odd ratio (aOR) and 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) of severe <b>adverse</b> <b>outcome</b> for hypoproteinemia (total plasma protein level < 40 g/L) was calculated by univariate and multivariate analyses. Calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit) was performed and the predictive ability for severe <b>adverse</b> <b>outcome</b> was assessed for total plasma protein and compared with CRIB, CRIB-II, SNAP-II and SNAPPE-II, by calculating receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and their associated area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS: 761 infants were studied: 14. 4 % died and 4. 1 % survived with severe cerebral ultrasound findings. The aOR of severe <b>adverse</b> <b>outcome</b> for hypoproteinemia was 6. 1 (95 % CI 3. 8 - 9. 9). The rank order for variables, as assessed by AUCs and 95 % CIs, in predicting outcome was: total plasma protein [0. 849 (0. 821 - 0. 873) ], SNAPPE-II [0. 822 (0. 792 - 0. 848) ], CRIB [0. 821 (0. 792 - 0. 848) ], SNAP-II [0. 810 (0. 780 - 0. 837) ] and CRIB-II [0. 803 (0. 772 - 0. 830) ].

The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the different indices in the prediction of <b>adverse</b> <b>outcome</b> of pregnancies suspected for intrauterine fetal growth restriction (IUGR). Methods. Uterine artery blood flow was recorded in 217 pregnancies admitted for Doppler ultrasound surveillance due to suspected IUGR. The median gestational age at examination was 38 weeks (range 25 - 42 weeks). Only cases having bilateral uterine artery notching were included in the evaluation. The uterine artery Doppler spectrum was analyzed for different indices, including evaluation of notch and end-diastolic velocities. Umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry was also performed. The outcome variables chosen were: a small-for-gestational-age (SGA) newborn, preterm birth, and abdominal delivery. ROC-curve calculations were used to compare the different indices. Results. The uterine artery blood velocity pulsatility index (PI) and resistance indices (RI) were the best predictors of <b>adverse</b> <b>outcome</b> of pregnancy. Apart from premature birth, the systolic/end-diastolic ratio was less predictive of <b>adverse</b> <b>outcome.</b> The indices including only diastolic blood velocities were the least predictive of <b>adverse</b> <b>outcome.</b> The group with notch velocity above end-diastolic velocity was compared with those having notch velocity below the end-diastolic velocity.

40|$|AbstractThe <b>Adverse</b> <b>Outcome</b> Pathway (AOP) {{concept has}} {{recently}} been proposed to support a paradigm shift in regulatory toxicology testing and risk assessment. This concept {{is similar to the}} Mode of Action (MOA), in that it describes a sequence of measurable key events triggered by a molecular initiating event in which a stressor interacts with a biological target. The resulting cascade of key events includes molecular, cellular, structural and functional changes in biological systems, resulting in a measurable <b>adverse</b> <b>outcome.</b> Thereby, an AOP ideally provides information relevant to chemical structure-activity relationships as a basis for predicting effects of structurally similar compounds. AOPs could potentially also form the basis for qualitative and quantitative predictive modeling of the human <b>adverse</b> <b>outcome</b> resulting from molecular initiating or other key events for which higher-throughput testing methods are available or can be developed. A variety of cellular and molecular processes are known to be critical for normal function of the central (CNS) and peripheral nervous systems (PNS). Because of the biological and functional complexity of the CNS and PNS, it has been challenging to establish causative links and quantitative relationships between key events that comprise the pathways leading from chemical exposure to an <b>adverse</b> <b>outcome</b> in the nervous system. Following introduction of the principles of MOA and AOPs, examples of potential or putative <b>adverse</b> <b>outcome</b> pathways specific for developmental or adult neurotoxicity are summarized and aspects of their assessment considered. Their possible application in developing mechanistically informed Integrated Approaches to Testing and Assessment (IATA) is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} the cause of <b>adverse</b> perinatal <b>outcome</b> in fetal growth restriction(FGR) where umbilical artery Doppler(UA) was normal, as identified from the Prospective Observational Trial to Optimize Pediatric Health(PORTO). We compared cases of <b>adverse</b> <b>outcome</b> where UA Doppler was normal and abnormal. The PORTO study was a national multicenter study of > 1, 100 ultrasound-dated singleton pregnancies with an estimated fetal weight(EFW) 95 th centile or end-diastolic flow was absent/reversed. <b>Adverse</b> perinatal <b>outcome</b> was defined as a composite of intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, necrotizing enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, sepsis or death. Fifty-seven(5. 0 %) of the 1, 116 fetuses had an <b>adverse</b> perinatal <b>outcome.</b> Nine(1. 3 %) of 698 fetuses with normal UA Doppler had an <b>adverse</b> <b>outcome,</b> compared with 48 (11. 5 %) of 418 with abnormal UA Doppler(p< 0. 0001). There were two perinatal deaths in the normal group and six in the abnormal group(p= 0. 01). The perinatal deaths in the normal group were one case of pulmonary hypoplasia after prolonged preterm rupture of the membranes from 12 weeks' gestation and a case of placental abruption. Gestation at delivery was 33 ± 3 vs. 31 ± 4 weeks(p= 0. 05) and mean birth-weight was 1830 g± 737 vs. 1146 g± 508 (p= 0. 001) in the respective groups. Neonatal sepsis was commonest <b>adverse</b> <b>outcome</b> in both groups, 0. 1 % and 0. 4 % respectively(p= 0. 01). <b>Adverse</b> perinatal <b>outcome</b> is uncommon in FGR with normal UA Doppler. The cases we identified were associated with heterogenous pathologies. FGR with normal UA blood flow is a largely benign condition...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} {{predictive}} value of biphasic ST-events for interventions for suspected fetal distress and <b>adverse</b> neonatal <b>outcome,</b> when using ST-analysis of the fetal electrocardiogram (FECG) for intrapartum fetal monitoring. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Three academic hospitals in Sweden. POPULATION: Women in labor with a high-risk singleton fetus in cephalic position beyond 36 weeks of gestation. METHODS: In women in labor who were monitored with conventional cardiotocography, ST-waveform analysis was recorded and concealed. Traces with biphasic ST-events of the FECG (index) {{were compared with}} traces without biphasic events of the FECG. The ability of biphasic events to predict interventions for suspected fetal distress and <b>adverse</b> <b>outcome</b> was assessed using univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Interventions for suspected fetal distress and <b>adverse</b> <b>outcome</b> (defined as presence of metabolic acidosis (i. e. umbilical cord pH 12 mmol), umbilical cord pH < 7. 00, 5 -min Apgar score < 7, admittance to neonatal intensive care unit or perinatal death). RESULTS: Although the presence of biphasic events of the FECG was associated with more interventions for fetal distress and {{an increased risk of}} <b>adverse</b> <b>outcome</b> compared with cases with no biphasic events, the presence of significant (i. e. intervention advised according to cardiotocography interpretation) biphasic events showed no independent association with interventions for fetal distress [odds ratio (OR) 1. 71, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 65 - 4. 50] or <b>adverse</b> <b>outcome</b> (OR 1. 96, 95 % CI 0. 74 - 5. 24). CONCLUSION: The presence of significant biphasic events did not discriminate in the prediction of interventions for fetal distress or <b>adverse</b> <b>outcome.</b> Therefore, biphasic events in relation to ST-analysis monitoring during birth should be omitted if future studies confirm our findings...|$|R
