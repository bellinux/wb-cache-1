25|$|Even {{with the}} {{conditions}} treacherous, 200,000 spectators turned {{up for the}} race on Sunday afternoon. The race {{turned out to be}} a one-man show by Scotsman Jackie Stewart. While Graham Hill took the lead at the start, by the end of the first lap Stewart had moved into first place and built a nine-second lead. He put his superior Dunlop wet tires to great effect and by the end of lap 2, had extended his lead to 34 seconds. When the race ended after 14 laps, Stewart crossed the line more than 4 minutes in front of second placed Hill. The eventual World Champion had spun on lap 11, but was able to get out of the car, push it into the right direction <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>going</b> before third-placed Jochen Rindt could catch up. Chris Amon had battled with Hill for 11 laps over second place, rarely having more than a second between the two, until Amon spun out of the race on the same lap as Hill did.|$|E
25|$|When the 6th Division {{attacked}} on the left, {{the preliminary}} bombardments, even controlled by artillery observation aircraft {{had left the}} Quadrilateral undamaged. The position was below the crest of ground beyond Ginchy in a depression, where the wire had been overgrown. The two brigadiers and the divisional commander thought that the preparation had failed. The 16th Brigade on the right was to capture the Quadrilateral with a battalion advancing on open ground from the south-west as a company bombed along the trench to the right. The second battalion in support was then {{to pass through the}} troops on the first objective <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>going</b> to the third, where the final two battalions were to take Morval. The 71st Brigade on the left was to attack with two battalions to capture Straight Trench and then advance to the final objective supported by the other two battalions of the brigade. Three tanks with the division were to attack the Quadrilateral but two broke down before reaching the assembly point east of Guillemont. Ross asked for the tank lane in the creeping barrage to be closed and XIV Corps, which had considered this possibility, had the order passed to the XIV Corps Commander, Royal Artillery (CRA), Brigadier-General A. E. Wardrop but by chance, his orders to the 6th Division CRA were not followed.|$|E

The album was released under the name Kele, dropping his surname. Okereke explained the album title, saying [...] "as a boxer, you have to rely on nobody else but yourself to achieve what it is you want to achieve. Even though you take hits, you have to keep focus on your priorities <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>going.</b> I thought that was an inspiring image." [...] The first single from the album, [...] "Tenderoni", was released on 14 June 2010.|$|E

2500|$|Once the FBI {{discovered}} through Selbold that Duquesne {{was again}} in New York operating as a German spy, director J. Edgar Hoover provided a background briefing to President Franklin Roosevelt. FBI agent Raymond Newkirk, {{using the name}} Ray McManus, was now assigned to DUNN and he rented a room immediately above Duquesne's apartment near Central Park and used a hidden microphone to record Duquesne's conversations. But monitoring Duquesne's activities proved to be difficult. As Newkirk described it, [...] "The Duke had been a spy {{all of his life}} and automatically used all of the tricks in the book to avoid anyone following him... He would take a local train, change to an express, change back to a local, go through a revolving door <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>going</b> on right around, take an elevator up a floor, get off, walk back to the ground, and take off in a different entrance of the building." [...] Duquesne also informed Sebold that he was certain he was under surveillance, and he even confronted one FBI agent and demanded that he stop tracking him, a story confirmed by agent Newkirk.|$|E

50|$|Effectively, the {{institutional}} investor's large order has given {{an option to}} the professional investor.

When you couldn't stand bein' lonely night after night, when you went out on the streets and saw everybody {{on the way to a}} good time but you? We used to look in the newspapers for notices of the big balls, and we'd take the cars to the West End and stand outside the awnings watching the carriages driving up and the people coming in. And the same with the weddings. We got to know a good many of the swells by sight. There was Mrs. Larrabbee,"--a certain awe crept into her voice--"and Miss Ferguson--she's sweet--and a lot more. Some of the girls used to copy their clothes and hats, but Florry and me tried to live honest. It was funny," [...] she added irrelevantly, [...] "but the more worn out we were at night, the more we'd want a little excitement, and we used to go to the dance-halls <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>going</b> until we were ready to drop." ...|$|E
60|$|As she {{lay there}} through inexorably {{conscious}} hours {{the picture of}} that hideous moment in the box alternated with the vision of her sister's guilty flight. She wanted to fly, herself--to go off <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>going</b> for ever. Lionel was fussily kind to her and he didn't abuse Selina--he didn't tell her again how that lady's behaviour suited his book. He simply resisted, with a little exasperating, dogged grin, her pitiful appeal for knowledge of her sister's whereabouts. He knew what she wanted it for and he wouldn't help her in any such game. If she would promise, solemnly, to be quiet, he would tell her when she got better, but he wouldn't lend her a hand to {{make a fool of}} herself. Her work was cut out for her--she was to stay and mind the children: if she was so keen to do her duty she needn't go further than that for it. He talked {{a great deal about the}} children and figured himself as pressing the little deserted darlings to his bosom. He was not a comedian, and she could see that he really believed he was going to be better and purer now. Laura said she was sure Selina would make an attempt to get them--or at least one of them; and he replied, grimly, 'Yes, my dear, she had better try!' The girl was so angry with him, in her hot, tossing weakness, for refusing to tell her even whether the desperate pair had crossed the Channel, that she was guilty of the immorality of regretting that the difference in badness between husband and wife was so distinct (for it was distinct, she could see that) as he made his dry little remark about Selina's trying. He told her he had already seen his solicitor, the clever Mr. Smallshaw, and she said she didn't care.|$|E
