5|$|Minnesotans {{have low}} rates of {{premature}} death, infant mortality, cardiovascular disease, and occupational fatalities. They have long life expectancies, and high rates of health insurance and regular exercise. These <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>measures</b> have led two groups to rank Minnesota as the healthiest state in the nation; however, {{in one of these}} rankings, Minnesota descended from first to sixth in the nation between 2005 and 2009 because of low levels of public health funding and the prevalence of binge drinking.|$|E
5|$|In 1830, {{on the eve}} of Muhammad Ali's invasion, the Porte {{transferred}} {{control of}} the sanjaks of Jerusalem and Nablus to Abdullah Pasha, the governor of Acre. According to Silverburg, in regional and cultural terms this move was important for creating an Arab Palestine detached from greater Syria (bilad al-Sham). According to Pappe, it was an attempt to reinforce the Syrian front in face of Muhammad Ali's invasion. Two years later, Palestine was conquered by Muhammad Ali's Egypt, but Egyptian rule was challenged in 1834 by a countrywide popular uprising against conscription <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>measures</b> considered intrusive by the population. Its suppression devastated many of Palestine's villages and major towns.|$|E
5|$|In February 2001, {{the sale}} of bird seed in the square was stopped <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>measures</b> were {{introduced}} to discourage the pigeons {{including the use of}} birds of prey. Supporters continued to feed the birds but in 2003 the mayor, Ken Livingstone, enacted bylaws to ban feeding them in the square. In September 2007 Westminster City Council passed further bylaws banning feeding birds on the pedestrianised North Terrace and other pavements in the area. Nelson's column was repaired from years of damage from pigeon droppings at a cost of £140,000.|$|E

5|$|Zino's petrel nests in burrows {{which are}} visited only at night, to {{the accompaniment of}} their {{haunting}} calls. The single white egg is incubated by both adults, one sitting during the day while the other feeds on fish and squid at sea. Eggs, chicks and adults have been subject to predation by introduced cats and rats, and in the past have been taken for food by local shepherds. Predator control, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>measures</b> such as the removal of grazing animals which trample the burrows, has enabled the population to recover to 6580 breeding pairs; it remains endangered on the IUCN Red List. However, conservation efforts had a major setback in August 2010 when fires killed three adults and 65% of the chicks.|$|E

25|$|With this perspective, crime {{prevention}} or reduction measures can be devised that increase effort required {{to commit the}} crime, such as target hardening. Rational choice theories also suggest that increasing risk of offending and likelihood of being caught, through added surveillance, police or security guard presence, added street lighting, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>measures,</b> are effective in reducing crime.|$|E
