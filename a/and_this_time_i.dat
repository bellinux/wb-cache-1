2500|$|At {{the start}} of World War I at the young age of 16, Brodovitch {{abandoned}} his dream of entering the Imperial Art Academy and {{ran away from home}} to join the Russian army. Not long after, his father had him brought home and hired a private tutor to help Alexey finish school. Upon graduating, Brodovitch ran away again on several occasions. He recalls: After a week or so I ran away to the front line to kill Germans. But my father, now a military general {{at the head of a}} Red Cross hospital train, had plenty of influence, and I was soon brought back to him. On the train back I was employed as a nurses' aid. In East Prussia I ran away again and joined a nearby regiment. Once again I was caught, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> was sent to an officers' school, the Corps de Pages. During the Russian Civil War, Brodovitch served with the White Army. While fighting against the Bolsheviks in Odessa, he was badly wounded and was hospitalized for a time in Kislovodsk, in the Caucasus. [...] In 1918, the town was surrounded by the Bolsheviks, forcing Brodovitch into exile. It was during this retreat to the south through Caucasus and Turkey that he met his future wife, Nina.|$|E

6000|$|... "You won't stay a little?" [...] He came to {{me again}} tenderly, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> {{suffered}} him. [...] "Her visit had its beauty," [...] he murmured as he held me, [...] "but yours has a greater one." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> also <b>I</b> {{shall not}} die, perhaps. Indeed, I do think not.|$|R
60|$|He was on {{the point}} of replying, when again he started <b>and</b> listened. <b>This</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> {{distinctly}} heard Mr. Bowles's cock, next door, crow twice.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{came after}} you," [...] I {{returned}} as coolly as <b>I</b> could; <b>and</b> by <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> had the pistol {{where it could}} be brought into instant use.|$|R
6000|$|... "The second heap {{of stones}} has done this, baas," [...] said Hans faintly, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> {{did not even}} look him. I only sat down and buried my face in my hands. One more such miss, and then-- ...|$|E
6000|$|I tried; <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> succeeded. With {{the image}} of Mrs. Van Brandt vividly present to my mind, I {{arranged}} the first words of the sentence which was to tell my mother that my [...] "infatuation" [...] was at an end! ...|$|E
6000|$|Monsieur Gratiot {{slapped his}} linen breeches. [...] "That I have," [...] <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> {{thought he was}} going to laugh. But he did not, though his eyes sparkled. [...] "And do you think that the good Congress will ever repay me, Davy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Yes; <b>and</b> by <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> have {{no doubt}} {{he is on the}} top of a vehicle of some sort, going as fast as horses can gallop to join his sweetheart.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That is Armstrong's way,' Lord Halliburn said; 'he means nothing, <b>and</b> by <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> {{should say}} {{that most of the}} girls know that he means nothing. I can't make out why he doesn't marry.' ...|$|R
60|$|A linen-draper's shop--a linen-draper's daughter! Was I {{still in}} love?--I {{thought of my}} father; I thought of the name <b>I</b> bore; <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> though <b>I</b> might have {{answered}} the question, I dared not.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{were always}} somebody's good angel, cousin," [...] I said; [...] "but I am her brother, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> can help. I am {{going back to}} the farm at Fairmead, and, if she is longing for open air, do you think she would come and keep house for me?" ...|$|E
60|$|The wine sparkled in {{his eyes}} and the bells jingled. My own fancy grew warm with the Medoc. We had passed through walls of piled bones, with casks and puncheons intermingling, into the inmost {{recesses}} of catacombs. I paused again, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> made bold to seize Fortunato by an arm above the elbow.|$|E
6000|$|Phoebe {{was almost}} desperate in her refusals, {{and was so}} little {{believed}} after all, that she charged Robert--when the sheriff had taken leave--to assure Augusta of the impossibility of her accepting the invitation. Sir John smiled, saying, 'Lady Caroline scarcely deserved her,' and added, 'Here is another who wishes {{to shake hands with}} you, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> promise that you shall not be persecuted--my brother.' ...|$|E
60|$|Lov. <b>And</b> {{though for}} <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> put up, because I am a winner-- [Snatches the gold.|$|R
60|$|I {{called the}} {{proprietor}} to me--a little pale-faced {{man with a}} black moustache, who had been hovering in the background. He hastened to my side, smiling <b>and</b> bowing. <b>This</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> did not ask him a direct question.|$|R
60|$|We found {{ourselves}} in the full thick {{of one of these}} meeting-places. To get out at any price! So we scrambled up the steep earthen banks to a stubble field above. <b>And</b> by <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> was in a greater rage.|$|R
60|$|Whilst he went {{upon that}} errand I {{returned}} once more on mine, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> gained {{the foot of}} the stairs without mishap, and stood in the hall. Ramiro's back was towards me. On my right stood the tall buffet from which the boy had fetched him wine that evening; this I marked out as the cover to which I must fly in case of need.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hardly," [...] {{answered}} the hunter. [...] "On my previous trip I stood the cold very well, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> shall go much better prepared. Somehow, I like {{hunting in the}} Arctic Circle better than hunting anywhere else. Besides, I wish to--But never mind that now," [...] and Barwell Dawson broke off rather abruptly. Then he told {{a story of a}} hunt after polar bears that made Chet's eyes water.|$|E
60|$|It is a {{year now}} since I wrote any of this story, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> shall really finish it. How little do we foresee the course of events! and certainly, when I last laid down my pen, I little thought that this story would have ended as it has. Most of what follows I have at times {{gathered}} from Sophy's lips, the rest from my own knowledge of the affair.|$|E
60|$|The sight was pathetic, <b>and</b> at <b>this</b> {{particular}} <b>time</b> <b>I</b> felt {{it to be}} {{more than}} I could bear.|$|R
60|$|This part of Friday's {{discourse}} {{began to}} relish with me very well; <b>and</b> from <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> entertained some hopes, that one <b>time</b> or other <b>I</b> might find {{an opportunity to}} make my escape from <b>this</b> place, <b>and</b> that <b>this</b> poor savage might be a means to help me to do it.|$|R
40|$|Being a {{theoretical}} scientist by background, I tend to begin my articles with general motivating observations <b>and</b> definitions. <b>This</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> hold back <b>and</b> introduce information design (I attribute to this term a different, designed meaning, see Karabeg, 2003) with an application {{which is currently}} under development. I call it ‘Key Point Dialog’...|$|R
60|$|Your grandmother's match-making was {{as honest}} as the day. There {{was the same}} salad of family and {{visitors}} as on the former afternoon, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> met Freshman, who was destined to marry Alice; there was tea, tennis, and, by your grandmother's suggestion, a walk to see the sunset from {{the crest of the}} hill. Rachel and I walked across the breezy moorland together, while I talked and tempted her to talk.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's a farm-house or something," [...] he declared, cheerily. [...] "We'll just nach'ly make 'em give us shelter. Going {{to storm}} too bad {{to do much}} work for 'em, and I bet it's some cranky old {{shellback}} farmer, living 'way out here like this. Well, we'll teach the old codger to like music, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> will play my mouth-organ. Ain't you glad we're young folks that like music and dancing--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Men in {{the nervous}} {{condition}} I was," [...] he answered, [...] "think {{all sorts of}} things, {{and that is one}} of the things I thought. Finally I went to Miss Laniston's house again, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> found her, and learned what had happened. Then I went to the pier, ordered the trunk sent back here, for I knew there was no question now of the trip to Europe, and here I am." ...|$|E
60|$|And now if {{you would}} hear what other adventures befell Sir Gareth <b>and</b> Lynette at <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> pray you to read further, for there these several things are told of in due order.|$|R
60|$|This was {{the first}} <b>time</b> that <b>I</b> could say, in the true sense of the words, that I prayed in all my life; for now I prayed {{with a sense of}} my condition, and with a true Scripture view of hope, founded on the {{encouragement}} of the word of God; <b>and</b> from <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> may say, I began to have hope that God would hear me.|$|R
6000|$|<b>And</b> all <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> was busily wooing Mistress Dolly; but she, little minx, {{would give}} me no satisfaction. I see her {{standing}} among the strawberries, her black hair waving in the wind, and her red lips redder still from the stain. And {{the sound of her}} childish voice comes back to me now after all these years. <b>And</b> <b>this</b> was my first proposal: ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"Not {{from the}} North," [...] said De Aquila. [...] "But {{the sea is}} always open. If the Barons gain the upper hand Robert will send another army into England for sure, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> think he will land here--where his father, the Conqueror, landed. Ye have brought your pigs to a pretty market! Half England alight, and gold enough on the ground"--he stamped on the bars beneath the table--"to set every sword in Christendom fighting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I... I was vexed by your interruption," [...] he said lamely, {{to explain}} his late choler. [...] "Here is the thing. I found it here when I came. Messer Caro might {{discover}} better employment for his leisure. But there, there"--he seemed in sudden haste again. [...] "Take it to her in God's name. She will be impatient." [...] I thought he sneered. [...] "O, she will praise your diligence," [...] he added, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> was sure that he sneered.|$|E
6000|$|... "We farmers on {{the back}} seats don't often {{get a chance to}} be heard, Mr. Speaker," [...] said he, amidst a general tittering from the front seats. [...] "We come down here without any l'arnin' of parli'ment'ry law, and before we know what's {{happened}} the session's over, and we hain't said nothin'." [...] (More laughter.) [...] "There's b'en a good many times when I wanted to say somethin', <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> made up my mind I was a-goin' to--law or no law." ...|$|E
5000|$|On February 6, 2006, Tocchet {{was served}} with a {{criminal}} complaint, accused of financing a nationwide sports gambling ring based in New Jersey in which several current NHL players wagered. [...] "It's not a hockey-related issue, it's a football thing. <b>And</b> at <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> can't comment any further," [...] Tocchet told The Arizona Republic after the Coyotes practiced on Tuesday, February 7, 2006.|$|R
60|$|I was now {{still further}} {{apprehensive}} {{as to the}} fate of Dian, <b>and</b> at <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> imagine, came the first realization that my affection for the girl might be prompted by more than friendship. During my waking hours she was constantly the subject of my thoughts, and when I slept her dear face haunted my dreams. More than ever was I determined to escape the Mahars.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> all <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> {{never ceased}} {{wondering}} {{at my own}} mental state; I thought of it when, quickly tired, my trembling fingers dropped the pencil; or when I woke from uneasy sleep to find the vision still before me, inviting, insistently calling to me, to resume my childish rambles and adventures of long ago in that strange world where I first saw the light.|$|R
