2500|$|After {{winning the}} Nobel Prize in 1996, Curl took a quieter path than Smalley, who became an outspoken {{advocate}} of nanotechnology, and Kroto, who used his fame to further {{his interest in}} science education, saying, [...] "After winning a Nobel, you can either become a scientific pontificator, or you can have some idea for a new science project <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> your newfound notoriety to get the resources to do it.

2500|$|DESI can be {{coupled to}} {{ultra-fast}} liquid chromatography using an LC eluent splitting strategy. It {{is a strategy}} through a tiny orifice on an LC capillary tube. There is negligible dead volume and back pressure that allows for almost real time mass spectrometry detection with a fast elution and purification. This coupling {{can be used to}} ionize a wide range of molecules, from small organics to high mass proteins. This is different from ESI (electrospray ionization) in that {{it can be used to}} directly analyze salt-containing sample solutions without requiring [...] “make-up” solvents/ acids to be doped into the sample. This set up allows for a high flow rate without splitting. The high resolution that is accomplished by reverse-phase HPLC can be combined with this procedure to produce high throughput screening of natural products as well. The incorporation of the electrochemistry component helps with ionization efficiency via the electrochemical conversion. This method is proved better than ESI in the fact that you don't have to separate the small potential that is applied to the cell from the potential on the spray in DESI. DESI also shows a better tolerance to inorganic salt electrolytes <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> traditional solvents used in electrolysis.|$|E

"At {{any rate}} we cannot {{try to do}} so till your {{shoulder}} is completely healed, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> your arm naturally; but I {{do not think that}} we had better try and cross to the isles just at present. If Prince Charles is there, or is believed by the English to be there, the search will be so keen that every stranger would be hunted down; and although the Highlanders might risk imprisonment and death for the prince himself, they could not be expected to run the same risk for anyone else. If the prince escapes it will be because the whole population are with him, and every man, woman, and child is trying to throw the pursuers off the scent. No, I think we should be safer in Edinburgh itself than in the isles. We will make a shift to live as we can for a month or so; by that time I hope {{you will be able to}} use one arm as well as the other, and we will then boldly go down into the Lowlands in our old characters as two drovers." ...|$|E
