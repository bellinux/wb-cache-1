5000|$|Around this time, DC {{was also}} {{publishing}} reprint-themed 80-Page Giant <b>Annuals</b> (also called [...] "100 Page Spectaculars"), {{some of which}} were reprinted replicas of past <b>Annuals</b> and {{some of which were}} newly published reprint collections styled as the <b>Annuals</b> of a Silver Age title that had no <b>Annuals</b> during its actual run.|$|R
5000|$|In addition, <b>annuals</b> {{are often}} {{published}} centred on sports, toys, currently-popular celebrities, recently released films, and popular TV series. British <b>annuals</b> are also published featuring American characters such as Spider-Man, often with simplified content aimed at younger readers. As tastes {{in these areas}} change, so does the line-up of <b>annuals</b> released each year. The increasing emphasis in recent years on <b>annuals</b> of this type (as opposed to the [...] "classic" [...] line-up of <b>annuals</b> based on comics) means that sales remain strong, and in fact doubled between 1998 and 2005Some <b>annuals</b> have become extremely collectible, especially The Beano, The Dandy, Rupert and Eagle.|$|R

5000|$|Comic book <b>annuals</b> {{originally}} {{were little}} more than reprint albums, representing stories that had first seen publication in its monthly counterpart, but eventually this changed to <b>annuals</b> featuring primarily all-new material. Later <b>annuals</b> often featured stories with greater import to the characters featured than in the monthly publication, reflecting the [...] "special" [...] status of their once-yearly publication. <b>Annuals</b> also on occasion featured the finale of a multi-issue storyline running in the monthly series; conversely, many <b>annuals</b> would showcase stand-alone stories that did not fit in with the then-current thrust of the monthly series' storyline.|$|R

5|$|In October 2015, the City {{announced}} that its official <b>annual</b> Christmas tree lighting, {{which had been}} held at Daley Center since 1966 (except for 1982), would {{be held at the}} park in order that the official Christmas tree of the city could be closer to ice skating at McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink, the <b>annual</b> Christmas caroling at Cloud Gate and to the new offerings of the nearby Maggie Daley Park. The <b>annual</b> lighting will occur near Michigan Avenue and Washington Street. Some parties opposed the move that separated the <b>annual</b> tree from the Christkindlmarket and the Chicago Picasso.

40|$|<b>Annuals</b> {{offer an}} almost {{infinite}} variety of flower color and plant form. They brighten landscape beds {{and add a}} splash of color to a porch, deck, or patio when placed in contain-ers (Figure 1). Some also make good cut flowers (Table 1). In Florida, most <b>annuals</b> only last one season (not one year). To be successful, they must be planted at the right time. Typically, <b>annuals</b> are divided into two types: warm season and cool season. Warm-season (tender) <b>annuals</b> are damaged by frosts or freezes and should be planted after the last frost date. Based on historical records, this is typically March 15 for North Florida and February 15 for Central Florida; frosts and freezes are rare in South Florida. However, early and late frosts can occur almost anywhere in the state, and tender <b>annuals</b> need to be covered if this occurs. Cool-season (hardy) <b>annuals</b> are intolerant of heat...|$|R

50|$|There {{were three}} Uncle Dick's <b>Annuals</b> issued from 1929 to 1931, dated as the 1930 to 1932 <b>annuals,</b> {{the first one}} being fully named 'Uncle Dick's Competition Annual'. These <b>annuals</b> were aimed more at boys, with action stories and very little Pip & Squeak content.

50|$|Although <b>annuals</b> have no {{vegetative}} regrowth {{from year}} to year, many retain a dormant population back-up underground {{in the form of}} a seed bank. The seed bank serves as an <b>annual's</b> source of age structure in the sense that often not all seeds will germinate each year. Thus, each year's population will consist of individuals of different ages in terms of seed dormancy times. The seed bank also helps to ensure the <b>annual's</b> survival and genetic integrity in variable or disturbed habitats (e.g., a desert), where good growing conditions are not guaranteed every year. Not all <b>annuals,</b> however, retain a seed bank. As far as population density, <b>annuals</b> with seed banks are predicted to be more temporally variable yet more spatially constant over time, while plants with no seed bank would be expected to be patchy (spatially variable).|$|R

5000|$|<b>Annuals</b> {{published}} by DC and particularly Marvel became fewer {{and far between}} in the late 1990s, mainly due to the near-collapse of the comic book industry {{in the wake of}} the speculator boom; <b>annuals</b> were seen as an unnecessary risk in a climate where many monthly publications were in danger of cancellation for lack of sales (especially at Marvel, which filed for bankruptcy during this time). When the industry began to recover from the [...] "bust", <b>annuals</b> began re-appearing on occasion, but by no means as regularly as before the [...] "bust", when numbered series of <b>annuals</b> had reached the teens or twenties, indicating over a decade of regular publication.|$|R
