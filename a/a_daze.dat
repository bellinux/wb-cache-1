5|$|Like {{the other}} {{characters}} of the series, Perry was structured in a simple style to allow young viewers to easily draw him. In keeping with the show's general design scheme, Perry is constructed of geometric shapes in a style reminiscent of deceased Looney Tunes animator Tex Avery. Povenmire uses different design styles for drawing Perry depending on how he is portrayed. When Perry is portrayed as a domesticated and mindless pet, Povenmire begins with a square shaped like a loaf of bread. He then draws his front legs and feet before drawing his bill, which is set at a certain angle. Povenmire then draws his eyeballs, which are never focused and look in opposing directions in <b>a</b> <b>daze.</b> He concludes the figure by adding his hind legs, tail, hair, and finally color.|$|E

25|$|The casket was opened, {{and after}} viewing the body Jacqueline Kennedy {{asked for a}} closed casket funeral. But she left the final {{decision}} to her brother-in-law, Robert Kennedy. Robert Kennedy, Walton, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, and four others viewed the body shortly before 5:00 A.M. McNamara said the casket should be kept closed. Walton agreed, which convinced Robert Kennedy that a closed-casket funeral would be held. Walton remembered sleeping as if in <b>a</b> <b>daze</b> {{for the next few}} hours.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, the Thai princes {{have moved}} from the Matsugae {{household}} to private dormitories {{on the grounds of}} the Peers School. Chao P. asks Kiyoaki to return him his emerald ring from the marquis's safe-keeping; he has not received a letter from Ying Chan in months, and is pining for her. Kiyoaki tears up the one last letter he receives from Satoko. One day, his mother leaves for the Ayakura villa in order to congratulate the family, casually informing him that the marriage to Prince Harunori will now definitely go ahead. All of a sudden he feels emotionally shattered, and spends the next few hours in <b>a</b> <b>daze.</b> This is the turning point of the novel.|$|E
25|$|Some time later, Japp phones Poirot {{and tells}} him Winnie has been found about fifteen miles from Amiens. She is in <b>a</b> <b>daze,</b> has been doped {{according}} to the doctor who examined her, and is unable to remember much after setting off from her home town of Cranchester. She remembers nothing of meeting one of Miss Pope's staff, Miss Burshaw, in London before the trip to France. Despite the girl being found, Poirot speaks with Detective Inspector Hearn, who has been dealing with the case and is no nearer to solving the mystery of how the girl disappeared. The only {{other people in the}} carriage seemed clear of suspicion – two middle-aged spinsters, two French commercial travellers from Lyon, a young man called James Elliot and his flashy wife, and an American lady about whom very little is known. He is able to confirm that Winnie's shoes were found by the rail line which confirms Poirot's theory.|$|E

25|$|Several weeks later, {{once again}} in the nursery (as in Act I), the family's {{belongings}} are being packed away as the family prepares to leave the estate forever. Trofimov enters in search of his galoshes, and he and Lopakhin exchange opposing world views. Anya enters and reprimands Lopakhin for ordering his workers to begin chopping down the cherry orchard even while the family is still in the house. Lopakhin apologizes and rushes out to stop them for the time being, in the hopes that he will be somehow reconciled with the leaving family. Charlotta enters, lost and in <b>a</b> <b>daze,</b> and insists that the family find her a new position. Ranevskaya tearfully bids her old life goodbye and leaves as the house is shut up forever. In the darkness, Firs wanders into the room and discovers that they have left without him and boarded him inside the abandoned house to die. He lies down on the couch and resigns himself to this fate (apparently dying on the spot). Offstage we hear the axes as they cut down the cherry orchard.|$|E

25|$|The troop carrier {{pilots in}} their remembrances and {{histories}} admitted to many errors in {{execution of the}} drops but denied the aspersions on their character, citing the many factors since enumerated and faulty planning assumptions. Some, such as Martin Wolfe, an enlisted radio operator with the 436th TCG, pointed out that some late drops were caused by the paratroopers, who were struggling to get their equipment out the door until their aircraft had flown by the drop zone by several miles. Others mistook drops made ahead of theirs for their own drop zones and insisted on going early. The TCC personnel {{also pointed out that}} anxiety at being new to combat was not confined to USAAF crews. Warren reported that official histories showed 9 paratroopers had refused to jump and at least 35 other uninjured paratroopers were returned to England aboard C-47s. General Gavin reported that many paratroopers were in <b>a</b> <b>daze</b> after the drop, huddling in ditches and hedgerows until prodded into action by veterans. Wolfe noted that although his group had botched the delivery of some units in the night drop, it flew a second, daylight mission on D-Day and performed flawlessly although under heavy ground fire from alerted Germans.|$|E

500|$|In contrast, Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph {{rated the}} film two stars {{out of five}} and called the plot [...] "a curate's egg, {{thoroughly}} scrambled". He concluded, [...] "The film squanders both of its casts, reeling from one fumbled set-piece to the next. It {{seems to have been}} constructed in a stupor, and you watch in <b>a</b> <b>daze</b> of future past". Simon Abrams, writing for RogerEbert.com, gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, calling it a [...] "visually driven and paint-by-numbers-plot". Abrams was critical of the undeveloped subplots that built up because the film's pacing left little time to develop each element of the story set in the 1970s.|$|E
500|$|On December 13, 1933, Bruins defenceman Eddie Shore, in <b>a</b> <b>daze</b> {{following}} what {{he thought}} was a check by Toronto's Ace Bailey, charged the latter player from behind, flipping Bailey into the air and causing him to suffer a severe skull fracture after he landed on his head. [...] The check was so vicious that Bailey was given the last rites before being transported to the hospital in Boston. Neurosurgeons operated throughout the night to save his life; however, Bailey's prognosis was so grim that morning papers printed his death notice. [...] Bailey survived, but he never played professionally again. [...] Shore ultimately served a 16-game suspension for the hit, and avoided being charged with manslaughter had Bailey died.|$|E
500|$|Fleder {{dedicated}} a {{great deal}} of focus to establishing the correct chemistry between Braugher and D'Onofrio. Fleder said, [...] "The energy between them had to be [...] because they're carrying the episode. The audience is centered on them and if either of them falters, the whole episode kind of falls apart." [...] The first day of shooting had to take place outside the subway station, so all outside scenes were shot first. As a result, the final scenes of the film were shot on the first day. Among those scenes were Pembleton leaving the subway in <b>a</b> <b>daze</b> following Lange's death; Yoshimura deeply regretted that {{this was one of the}} first scenes shot because he felt that the performance would have been more moving if Braugher had some previous dramatic interaction with D'Onofrio.|$|E

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1892 Mahler took the Hamburg singers to London to {{participate}} in a eight-week season of German opera—his only visit to Britain. His conducting of Tristan enthralled the young composer Ralph Vaughan Williams, who [...] "staggered home in <b>a</b> <b>daze</b> and could not sleep for two nights." [...] However, Mahler refused further such invitations as he was anxious to reserve his summers for composing. In 1893 he acquired a retreat at Steinbach, on the banks of Lake Attersee in Upper Austria, and established a pattern that persisted {{for the rest of his}} life; summers would henceforth be dedicated to composition, at Steinbach or its successor retreats. Now firmly under the influence of the Wunderhorn folk-poem collection, Mahler produced a stream of song settings at Steinbach, and composed his Second and Third Symphonies there.|$|E

Yet all this is the least of it (216c)- Socrates is mad about {{beautiful}} boys, following them around in <b>a</b> <b>daze</b> (216d).

2500|$|A former driver suggested, to The Times, that a {{blackout}} was a possibility, {{due to the}} erratic shift {{patterns that}} the drivers had to adhere to. He {{also said that the}} vending machine at the tram depot was stocked only with energy drinks, and that [...] "Nobody is ever fully awake; I was always in a bit of <b>a</b> <b>daze</b> and that is because the way the shifts work doesn't allow the drivers to get a regular sleep pattern." [...] Following this, multiple sources reported on a video apparently showing a different driver struggling to stay awake at the controls. The driver concerned was suspended pending an investigation into the matter.|$|E
2500|$|When forming The Smiths, The Velvet Underground {{was a key}} influence, {{along with}} Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones. Marc Bolan of T. Rex also had a strong impact on him because of the groove and the sound that put the {{listener}} in <b>a</b> <b>daze.</b> Talking about his instrument, he explained : [...] "I try {{to think about the}} guitar along the spectrum of James Williamson, who was in The Stooges during the Raw Power era, on the one hand to John McLaughlin and his solo record, My Goal's Beyond. I like all the spectrum in between, and that might be – and is – Richard Lloyd of Television, John McGeoch from Siouxsie and the Banshees, Nile Rodgers. To me these people are magicians and artists." ...|$|E

Lewis and others argued the stoppage was premature and that a champion {{should be given the}} benefit of the doubt. In spite of the Lewis camp protests, Boxing Monthly editor Glynn Leach pointed out that Lewis [...] "only seemed to recover his senses once the fight was waved off", and that [...] "in the opinions of everyone I spoke to at ringside, the decision was correct." ...|$|E
