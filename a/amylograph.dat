40|$|Because of {{the belief}} that the {{rheological}} properties of wheat fl our and dough are related to the flour quality and its processing characteristics, they are of great importance in the baking and milling industries. The Farinograph, Extensograph, <b>Amylograph</b> and Alveograph tests are the most common empirical tests used for assessing rheological properties of wheat dough. Recently, new rheological tool for wheat fl our characterization, called Mixolab, has been developed. The advantage of using Mixolab is that one can measure protein and starch characteristics in a single test. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the relationships between Mixolab parameters and parameters obtained using Farinograph and <b>Amylograph</b> among flour samples of different technological quality. Mixolab water absorption value was significantly correlated to Farinograph water absorption value (r = 0. 9816) as well as Mixolab dough formation time value (time for C 1) to dough development time obtained using Farinograph (r = 0. 9668), while the values which indicate dough stability have not expressed so high correlation (r = 0. 7484). In addition, difference between the values of maximum torque (C 1) and torque at the end of the first period of constant temperature (T= 30 °C) obtained by Mixolab expressed good correlation with the Farinograph degree of softening (r = 0. 8504).

Wheat flour of good baking quality was provided by a Czech commercial mill. Besides the mixolab profiles, basic baking quality parameters were also determined. By analytical methods, protein content, Zeleny’s value and Falling Number were determined. Dough baking quality was tested {{with the help of}} three rheological apparatuses, namely farinograph, extensigraph and <b>amylograph.</b> Moreover, laboratory baking test was performed, and specific bread volume was calculated. Mixolab torque data was strongly affected by substitution level than hemp flour type. The most precise distinguishing of samples was observed during the mixing and starch retrogradation phases of the test. Correlation analysis confirmed proper relationships between mixolab and rheological parameters related both to protein properties (C 1, C 2, C 1 –C 2 vs. farinograph and extensigraph ones) and starch or starch gel properties (C 3, C 4, C 5 vs. <b>amylograph</b> ones).

The cultivars included 8 adapted hybrids, 7 adapted population cultivars, and 4 nonadapted population cultivars. The results showed a significant influence of both harvest year and genotype on grain characteristics, chemical composition, and functional properties of the grain. Multivariate data analysis confirmed that the variations in the data were explained by yearly and genotype differences.

40|$|To elevate {{dietary fibre}} content in wheat bread, two {{additions}} of barley flour were tested (30 % and 50 %), and further 5 % or 10 % of chia or teff wholemeals. Chia elevated dietary fibre content {{more effectively than}} teff did (up to 6. 41 % and 4. 29 %, respectively). Non‑gluten nature of proteins in non‑traditional raw materials also affected farinograph, <b>amylograph</b> and mixolab proof results. Water absorption increased about 10 % in total, especially owing to teff presence in composite flour. All three alternative crops decelerated dough development and prolonged its stability, but dough softening degree depended on their combination. Higher water absorption was reflected in viscosity rise during <b>amylograph</b> testing. Using mixolab equipment, significantly more accurate differentiation of tested composites was reached, both in phase of dough kneading and registration of viscosity during heating and cooling. Contrary to this, any statistically verifiable difference was observed between chia or teff wholemeal variants from white of dark seeds.

Amylograms of 6 % slurries of cornstarch in the preheated milks were compared with gel electrophoresis patterns of the whey proteins remaining undenatured in the same preheated milk samples. As temperature of preheating was increased, smaller portions of each whey protein remained undenatured and the second increase in viscosity shown by the <b>Amylograph</b> became less. After all the whey proteins except (alpha) -lactalbumin and (beta) -lactoglobulin had been completely denatured by preheat treatment at 82 (DEGREES) C, the second step in the viscosity curve no longer appeared but {{was replaced by a}} gradual viscosity increase. This increase was eliminated when the temperature of preheat treatment was raised to 95 (DEGREES) C. Addition of more (alpha) -lactalbumin to milk preheated at 82 (DEGREES) C failed to raise the viscosity, but addition of (beta) -lactoglobulin did increase viscosity. The Amylogram made with the addition of (beta) -lactoglobulin was similar to that obtained with raw milk or milk that had been preheated at only 74 (DEGREES) C. Microscopy and measurement of the swelling power of the starch in the preheated milk samples indicated differences in viscosity were not caused by effects on swelling of the starch granules.

Rice starch granules begin to swell radially, then undergo radial contraction and random tangential expansion to form complex structures in the gelatinization temperature range. At the end of the gelatinization temperature range, starch granules begin to lose their granular structures. At higher temperatures, rice starch granules soften and melt into thin flat disks and then stretch into thin filaments to form a three-dimensional network. During this transition, rapid increases in swelling power and solubility occur. These progressive configurational changes are reflected in the <b>amylograph</b> curves. Susceptibility of the starch granules dispersed in excess water to changes during heating is dependent on gelatinization temperature range during initial swelling and on the ratio of amylose to amylopectin in the latter stage of swelling.

After the day storage period, Tamees bread had a faster degree of staling followed by Burr and Mafrood in comparison to Samauli and white pan breads. Both white pan and Samauli breads remained fresh to some degree while Mafrood and Burr breads were slightly stale and Tamees was stale. After 3 days storage period, all types of bread were rated very statle except Samuli and pan which was rated only stale. Swelling power, total water soluble, soluble starch and amyloraph maximum viscosity tended to decrease as the storage period increased. Sensory freshness scores of all breads correlated positively with swelling power, total soluble and soluble starch, and correlated negatively with the storage period: while swelling power and maximum viscosity of bread samples correlated negatively with the storage period...|$|E
40|$|Starches of {{fine texture}} from cormels of cocoyam (Xanthosoma sagittifolium), {{cultivar}} Ede ocha and cultivar Ede uhie {{were subjected to}} acid and enzyme modification treatments. Proximate composition, functional and <b>amylograph</b> pasting properties of the starches were evaluated. The starch samples were also used {{in the production of}} cookies at 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 % level of substitution with wheat flour. The cookies produced were subjected to proximate analysis and sensory evaluation. The result of the sensory evaluation showed that cookies prepared at 5 % level of substitution were most acceptable. After eight weeks of storage in light polythene bags, the cookies prepared at 5 and 10 % levels of substitution with wheat flour were found to be more acceptable by the panelists. Observations on the functional properties showed that the modified cocoyam starches exhibited higher bulk densities than the untreated starches. Native and modified starches with the high water absorption capacity and swelling index were produced from cultivar Ede uhie. There was no significant difference (p> 0. 05) in the solubility of the starch samples...|$|E

The study includes <b>amylograph,</b> farinograph and extensograph analysis of dough with and without additives (control sample). The volume of lost CO 2 gas (mL) is the lowest in dough samples with an added combination of complex additive and thyme extract (0. 05 and 0. 5 %) and rosemary extract (2. 0 %). In the samples with thyme extract (1. 0 %) added, the volume of lost gas is at a level of samples with added complex additive, DATEM, and L-ascorbic acid.

40|$|Effect {{of barley}} flour on {{rheological}} characteristics of dough, organoleptic, nutritional and storage characteristics of south Indian parotta G Koushika Maiya, BG Shwetha and D Indrani Barley (Hordeum sativum) {{is a good}} source of dietary fibre, particularly b-glucan. Effect of 10, 20, 30 and 40 % barley flour on the rheological characteristics of dough and quality characteristics of south Indian parotta was studied. Use of increasing amount of barley flour from 0 to 40 % increased farinograph water absorption and decreased stability, increased extensograph resistance to extension and decreased extensibility, decreased <b>amylograph</b> set back and increased peak viscosity values. Sensory analysis showed that use of barley flour above 30 % brought about adverse effect on the quality of parotta. Addition of combination of 2 % dry gluten powder and 0. 001 % xylanase enzyme, XY (combination of improvers) decreased elasticity, increased exten-sibility of the dough and quality of parotta with 30 % BF. During 48 h of storage, parottas with 30 % barley flour remained softer than control parotta. The total dietary fibre and b-glucan contents of parotta with 30 % BF were 2. 0 and 10. 5 times higher than the control parotta...|$|E
40|$|Prospect {{of maize}} flour for cookiesCookies {{is one of}} the {{favorite}} snacks consumed by community. The average consumption of dry cake in the big city and village in Indonesia is 0. 40 kg/capita/year. Cookies processing do not need volume development as wet cake and bread, but the cookies have to be crispy, imperishable to water, hard and unbroken easily. This relates with the physiochemical characteristic and functional of maize flour. Maize flour has hard texture, relatively low gluten content (< 1 %) with <b>amylograph</b> features processing the cold viscosity (240  620 BU). This papers described the results of research relating with the nutrition content, functional characteristic, and the construction of dry cake from maize flour. The cookies made from maize flour have good nutrition quality and adequate processing feature, substitution towards the wheat flour until the level 50  80 % with the receiving level of highly preference (organoleptic). Supported by the recipe of dry cake that popular in the recent time were using the corn based material for example corn flake, coco chip, corn crispy. This indicated the opportunity of utilizing maize flour corn powder that has already received by the modern community who processing the high prospect to be developed...|$|E
40|$|Karkade (Hibiscus sabdariffa) powder {{was used}} a crude fiber, calcium, and iron {{supplement}} in chocolate cakes at 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 % supplement levels based on wheat flour weight. Cakes {{were evaluated by}} baking tests. Karkade which was not pH-controlled, caused a real reduction in cake volume, cake specific volume, and cake crumb pH, which increased with increasing concentration of karkade. However, chocolate cakes containing 5 % karkade with the pH of cake batter is controlled to 7. 0 {{by the addition of}} soda just before making cakes were similar to the control cakes, containing wheat flour alone, in all aspects. In addition, the crude fiber, calcium, and iron contents in these cakes approximately increased 5, 4, and 2 fold respectively. Physical tests were used to study the effect of karkade on wheat flour properties. Karkade had a little effect on flour properties such as volume sedimentation, alkaline water retention capacity, and <b>amylograph</b> peak viscosity. The unsatisfactory use of karkade in chocolate cakes is attributable at least in part to organic acids in karkade which lower the pH value of cake crumb. With the pH value of cake crumb controlled to the optimum level, karkade powder at up to 5 % level of supplementation can be used in the production of chocolate cakes...|$|E
