40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we present}} a {{high-level}} feedback control algorithm for rapid imaging in atomic force microscopy (AFM). This algorithm is designed for samples which are string-like, such as DNA and biopolymers. The tip control of the microscope is performed in real-time while probing the unknown sample based on feedback from the tip and {{a model of the}} sample. This model <b>is</b> <b>continually</b> <b>updated</b> <b>based</b> on the measurements. To avoid exciting unwanted dynamics in the AFM system, the tip is steered at a constant velocity along a sinusoidal trajectory whose average is the estimate of the sample curve. We discuss the advantages of the algorithm and some of the challenges which must be overcome to make this technique a viable approach to AFM imaging. I...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis article solves {{analyzing}} {{and modeling}} of transport infrastructure financing needs based on precedence analysis. Precedence is {{calculated for the}} infrastructure of the selected region and selected segmentation applied in smaller regional units. Based on comparison of progress of the precedence of transport infrastructure at various time intervals and development of precedence in the infrastructure funding are sought consensus and disproportion in the precedence. Development of transport {{is determined by the}} state inspection infrastructure concepts and strategies for transport policy. These concepts <b>are</b> <b>continually</b> <b>updated.</b> <b>Based</b> on changes in the design there can be determined another precedence. Precedence in transport infrastructure may be affected by various combinations of selected segments of transport routes. For this reason, different precedence may exist. To determine the precedence it is important do correct choice of threshold values of important qualitative and quantitative attributes. Based on combination of values for these attributes are compared development of the precedence in the past and there are searched consensus in the precedence of development infrastructure, in the precedence of concepts changes and in the precedence infrastructure funding. Setting appropriate thresholds and mutual functional dependencies among individual attributes are predicted requirements for infrastructure funding. Prediction is based on planning changes in transport infrastructure which are modified based on individual precedence in concepts changes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—With recent {{advances}} in smartphones and wearable sensors, Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) have been proposed for use in continuous, remote electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring. In such systems, sampling the ECG at clinically recommended rates (250 Hz) and wireless transmission of the collected data incurs high energy consumption at the energy-constrained body sensor. The large volume of collected data also makes data storage at the sensor infeasible. Thus, {{there is a need}} for reducing the energy consumption and data size at the sensor, while maintaining the ECG quality required for diagnosis. In this paper, we propose GeM-REM, a resource-efficient ECG monitoring method for BSNs. GeM-REM uses a generative ECG model at the base station and its lightweight version at the sensor. The sensor transmits data only when the sensed ECG deviates from modelbased values, thus saving transmission energy. Further, the model parameters <b>are</b> <b>continually</b> <b>updated</b> <b>based</b> on the sensed ECG. The proposed approach enables storage of ECG data in terms of model parameters rather than data samples, which reduces the required storage space. Implementation on a sensor platform and evaluation using real ECG data from MIT-BIH dataset shows transmission energy and data storage reduction ratios of 42. 1 : 1 and 37. 3 : 1 respectively, which are better than state of the art ECG data compression schemes.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new paradigm of learning for reasoning, understanding, and prediction, {{as well as the}} scaffolding network to implement this paradigm. The scaffolding network embodies an incremental learning approach that is formulated as a teacher-student network architecture to teach machines how to understand text and do reasoning. The key to our computational scaffolding approach is the interactions between the teacher and the student through sequential questioning. The student observes each sentence in the text incrementally, and it uses an attention-based neural net to discover and register the key information in relation to its current memory. Meanwhile, the teacher asks questions about the observed text, and the student network gets rewarded by correctly answering these questions. The entire network <b>is</b> <b>updated</b> <b>continually</b> using reinforcement learning. Our experimental results on synthetic and real datasets show that the scaffolding network not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods but also learns to do reasoning in a scalable way even with little human generated input.

40|$|Fossils {{provide the}} {{principal}} basis for temporal calibrations, which {{are critical to}} the accuracy of divergence dating analyses. Translating fossil data into minimum and maximum bounds for calibrations is the most important, and often least appreciated, step of divergence dating. Properly justified calibrations require the synthesis of phylogenetic, paleontological, and geological evidence and can be difficult for non-specialists to formulate. The dynamic nature of the fossil record (e. g., new discoveries, taxonomic revisions, updates of global or local stratigraphy) requires that calibration data <b>be</b> <b>updated</b> <b>continually</b> lest they become obsolete. Here, we announce the Fossil Calibration Database ([URL] a new open-access resource providing vetted fossil calibrations to the scientific community.
