While time spent machining and surface roughness decrease with CUSM, the entrance profile diameter is slightly larger than normal due to the additional chemical reactivity of the new slurry choice.

50|$|In {{abrasive}} flow machining, the <b>abrasive</b> <b>fluid</b> {{flows through}} the workpiece, effectively performing erosion. Abrasive particles in the fluid contact raised features {{on the surface of}} the workpiece and remove them. The fluid is forced through the workpiece by a hydraulic ram, where it acts as a flexible file, or slug, molding itself precisely to the shape of the workpiece. The highest amount of material removal occurs in areas where the flow of the fluid is restricted; according to Bernoulli's Principle, the flow speed and pressure of the fluid increase in these areas, facilitating a higher material removal rate (MRR). The pressure exerted by the fluid on all contacting surfaces also results in a very uniform finish.|$|E

40|$|As it was {{difficult}} to solve the near wall characteristics of flow field in softness abrasive flow machining (SAFM) on mould structural surface, a method for simulation the flow characteristics based on the low Re number k-ε model was proposed in this paper. The greater curvature of small size tube was used as specific simulation object. The motion law of particles and related parameters were calculated and the precision machining mechanism of SAFM was discussed. Simulation results show that the micro cutting of abrasive flow mainly appears as the transposition of cutting location influenced by the particle pressure, and as the variation of machining efficiency influenced by near-wall particle velocity. Thus via control of the inlet velocity and its corresponding machining time, it is supposed to work out the machining process according with the machining requirements. By tracking near-wall particles, it can be confirm that the movement of near-wall abrasive particles is similar to stream-wise vortices. The cutting traces on workpiece surfaces assume disorderly arrangement, so the feasibility of SAFM method can be reaffirmed.

The innovative valve concept is based on controlling the friction of material by employing several friction elements along the flow direction. Abrasive particles in the viscous fluid are stopped {{by the force of}} friction when coming into contact with the friction elements. Friction is neutralized by use of vibration to break away the abrasive particles from the friction element surfaces. Several factors were considered in designing the piezoelectric valve.

The outcomes of numerical simulations, performed following the standard, well-established approach involving Eulerian-Lagrangian modelling of the liquid-particle flow and application of an algebraic erosion model, were compared against the laboratory data. This allowed proper definition of the erosion prediction models and assessment of their reliability for the flow conditions of interest.

The effect of conduction heat loss for different laser properties on the vaporization and melting in the laser drilling process is investigated. ^ Three thermal models of the SLS for a two-component metal powder bed were proposed: (1) 1 -D melting of the powder bed with constant heat flux heating; (2) 2 -D melting and resolidification of a powder bed with a moving Gaussian heat source; (3) 3 -D melting and resolidification of a powder bed with a stationary ellipsoid or a moving round laser beam.
