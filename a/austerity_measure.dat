5|$|On 13 August 2012, Fuller {{signed for}} League Two side Barnet on a free transfer, along with Gillingham team-mate Curtis Weston. He made his debut for the Bees in a 1–1 draw with Bristol Rovers on 21 August 2012. He {{would go on}} to make 39 league appearances, {{cementing}} his place as the club's first choice right-back. Barnet started the 2012–13 season poorly, failing to win any of their first 12 league matches and were ultimately relegated to the Conference on goal difference after finishing in 23rd place. Barnet's relegation required manager Edgar Davids to release a number of players as an <b>austerity</b> <b>measure</b> to accommodate the fact that the club would be operating on a smaller wage budget in the 2013–14 season, and it was announced on 22 May 2013 that Fuller would be released along with 12 other players.|$|E

2500|$|Six o'clock closing was {{introduced}} during the First World War, partly {{as an attempt}} to improve public morality and partly as a war <b>austerity</b> <b>measure.</b> [...] Before this reform, most hotels and public houses in Australia had closed at 11 or 11:30pm. [...] Support for changing hotel closing times originally came from the temperance movement, which hoped that implementing restrictions on the sale of alcohol would lead eventually to its total prohibition. [...] Although the movement had been active since the 1870s, it had been gaining ground since the 1900s following the introduction of 6o'clock retail trade closing, first legislated in Western Australia in 1897. [...] The argument made by the temperance movement challenged the grounds for public houses being [...] "kept open while bakers' shops were shut". [...] Prominent groups in this movement were the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and the Rechabites. [...] Their agitation was augmented with the outbreak of war in 1914 where it was argued that a [...] "well-ordered, self-disciplined and morally upright home front was a precondition for the successful prosecution of the war." ...|$|E
40|$|We use {{evidence}} from a natural experiment in Greece {{to study the}} effect of the announcement of <b>austerity</b> <b>measures</b> on road traffic accidents (RTAs). We use daily RTA data from 2010 and 2011, during which a number of <b>austerity</b> <b>measures</b> were announced, including salary and pension cuts and an increase in direct and indirect taxes. We find that controlling for other factors potentially influencing RTAs, the number of RTAs increased significantly on the first two days following the announcements of <b>austerity</b> <b>measures.</b> We put forward some tentative suggestions for why this happens...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the trade {{relations}} between Romania and the PIIGS (Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Spain) in order to verify whether the exports of Romania have been positively or negatively affected by the <b>austerity</b> <b>measures</b> adopted by these Eurozone periphery countries, thus diminishing Romania’s export performance in such markets. Hence, our main research question is whether <b>austerity</b> <b>measures</b> harm or affect in any way the inflows and outflows of international trade in the studied countries. To assess this hypothesis, we focused on the external trade relations, and their linkages with the macroeconomic environment, rather than the competitiveness of a state explained by a detailed sectoral analysis. In this respect, we use comparative and descriptive statistics in order to observe {{the consequences of the}} internal devaluation, and implicitly <b>austerity</b> <b>measures,</b> on the PIIGS-Romanian trade relations. Our findings suggest that the effects of <b>austerity</b> <b>measures</b> are not homogenous because they depend on the scale of trade exchanges and on {{the way in which the}} <b>austerity</b> <b>measures</b> were applied...|$|R

40|$|The {{implementation}} of <b>austerity</b> <b>measures</b> presents a dilemma for governments. While <b>austerity</b> <b>measures</b> such as cutbacks aim {{to reduce costs}} and enhance public sector efficiency, the same measures might undermine the motivation of employees and, consequently, the prospects of effectively implementing austerity programmes. Based on a survey of ministerial officials in Poland and Latvia, this article finds that the scale of cutbacks explains a larger decline of staff motivation in Latvia than in Poland. The article further shows that motivation {{was more likely to}} decrease after the crisis if <b>austerity</b> <b>measures</b> involved cutbacks such as staff reductions, recruitment freezes, and a reduction of training opportunities...|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1932, as an <b>austerity</b> <b>measure</b> to save money during the Great Depression, Milton County {{to the north and}} Campbell County to the southwest were annexed by Fulton County.

On May 9 of that year, neighboring Cobb County ceded to Fulton County the city of Roswell and lands lying east of Willeo Creek, in order that the latter county be more contiguous with the lands ceded from Milton County.|$|E
