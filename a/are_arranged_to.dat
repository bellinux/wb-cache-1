25|$|In {{addition}} to themed exhibits in the museum, touring exhibits <b>are</b> <b>arranged</b> <b>to</b> other places within Croatia, and abroad {{in order to}} reach out to a wider audience. Artwork from the museum's holdings have recently been on exhibit in Japan (2006), Italy (2002), USA (2000), and Slovakia (2000). It is estimated that over 200,000 visitors saw these international shows.|$|E

The Brick House, also rectangular, faces the Glass House, but a nearby concrete, circular sculpture by Donald Judd (untitled, 1971) and small circular pools {{on either side}} of it serve to soften the rectangular effect, although structures and objects throughout the estate <b>are</b> <b>arranged</b> <b>to</b> show patterns or repetitions of curves and angles.|$|E

Sometimes a single projector mounted near the centre of the dome is employed with a fisheye lens to spread the light over the whole dome surface, while in other configurations several projectors around the horizon of the dome <b>are</b> <b>arranged</b> <b>to</b> blend together seamlessly.|$|E
25|$|The lush {{decoration}} {{of the south}} and of the main apses (the latter is heptagonal), is made of a triple order of niches, the middle order being alternated with triple windows. The bricks <b>are</b> <b>arranged</b> <b>to</b> form patterns like arches, hooks, Greek frets, sun crosses, swastikas and fans. Between these patterns are white and dark red bands, alternating one course of stone with two to five of bricks. This is the first appearance of this most important decorating aspect of the Palaiologian architecture in Constantinople.|$|E
25|$|In any {{of these}} designs an observer, rather than seeing a {{continuous}} weak light, sees a brighter light during short time intervals. These instants of bright light <b>are</b> <b>arranged</b> <b>to</b> create a light characteristic or, pattern specific to a lighthouse. For example, the Scheveningen Lighthouse flashes are alternately 2.5 and 7.5seconds. Some lights have sectors of a particular color (usually formed by colored panes in the lantern) to distinguish safe water areas from dangerous shoals. Modern lighthouses often have unique reflectors or Racon transponders so the radar signature of the light is also unique.|$|E

A display device <b>is</b> <b>arranged</b> <b>to</b> display information to a user for indicating when,a user might strike the dummy.

25|$|The ship {{carries a}} maximum of 134 {{passengers}} and travels the polar regions {{with a number of}} on-board guides and scientific experts/lecturers in relevant fields. Numerous trips ashore <b>are</b> <b>arranged</b> <b>to</b> see the landscapes, geology, flora and fauna, by using 12-man Zodiac inflatable boats. In the Arctic, the guides are armed and trained in the use of flare guns and rifles, due to the possibility of polar bear encounters and are in constant radio contact with the ship and each other. The ship contains a heated Mudroom in which boots and clothing can be stored after excursions, enabling anything wet to dry out quickly.|$|E
25|$|Normally, a wing {{with such}} a low aspect ratio will suffer from very poor {{performance}} due {{to the degree of}} induced drag created at the wingtips, as the higher pressure air below spills around the wingtip to the lower-pressure region above. In a conventional aircraft, these wingtip vortices carry a lot of energy with them and hence create drag. The usual approach to reducing these vortices is to build a wing with a high aspect ratio, i.e. one that is long and narrow. However, such wings compromise the maneuverability and roll rate of the aircraft, or present a structural challenge in building them stiff enough. The XF5U attempted to overcome the tip vortex problem using the propellers to actively cancel the drag-causing tip vortices. The propellers <b>are</b> <b>arranged</b> <b>to</b> rotate in the opposite direction to the tip vortices, with the aim of retaining the higher-pressure air below the wing. With this source of drag eliminated, the aircraft would fly with a much smaller wing area, and the small wing would yield high maneuverability with greater structural strength.|$|E
500|$|Roberts disliked Pei's initial designs, {{referring}} {{to them as}} [...] "just a bunch of towers". Roberts intended his comments as typical of scientific experimentation, rather than artistic critique; still, Pei was frustrated. His second attempt, however, fit Roberts' vision perfectly: a spaced-out series of clustered buildings, joined by lower structures and complemented by two underground levels. The complex uses many elements of cubist design, and the walkways <b>are</b> <b>arranged</b> <b>to</b> increase the probability of casual encounters among colleagues.|$|E

500|$|Blue-ringed {{octopuses}} {{spend much}} of their time hiding in crevices whilst displaying effective camouflage patterns with their dermal chromatophore cells. [...] If they are provoked, they quickly change colour, becoming bright yellow with each of the 50-60 rings flashing bright iridescent blue within a third of a second. [...] In the greater blue-ringed octopus (Hapalochlaena lunulata), the rings contain multi-layer iridophores. [...] These <b>are</b> <b>arranged</b> <b>to</b> reflect blue–green light in a wide viewing direction. The fast flashes of the blue rings are achieved using muscles under neural control. Under normal circumstances, each ring is hidden by contraction of muscles above the iridophores. When these relax and muscles outside the ring contract, the bright blue rings are exposed.|$|E

Its lyrics <b>are</b> <b>arranged</b> <b>to</b> portray the singer during a celebration: [...] "I came to have a party / Open off that Bacardi ... Purple taking me higher / I'm lifted and I like it." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine praised its lyrics and beat, and felt the song prepares listeners for the album's [...] "party theme". Lyrically, [...] "We Belong Together" [...] {{was described as a}} [...] "broken-hearted lament for love"; it features finger-snaps, kick drums, and a piano-driven melody.|$|E
500|$|In {{vaulting}} a {{roof space}} using stone ribs and panels of infill, the bearing ribs all spring from columns along the walls. There is commonly a rib called the ridge rib which {{runs along the}} apex of the vault. There may be intermediate or [...] "tierceron" [...] ribs, which have their origin at the columns. In Decorated Gothic there are occasionally short lierne ribs connecting the bearing and tierceron ribs at angles, forming stellar patterns. This is the feature that appears at Bristol, at a very early date, and quite unlike the way that [...] "lierne" [...] ribs are used elsewhere. In this case, there is no ridge rib, and the lierne ribs <b>are</b> <b>arranged</b> <b>to</b> enclose a series of panels that extend the whole way along the centre of the choir roof, interacting with the large east window by reflecting the light from the smoothly arching surfaces. From the nave can be seen the intricate tracery of the east window echoed in the rich lierne pattern of the tower vault, which is scarcely higher than the choir, and therefore clearly visible. The two aisles of the choir both also have vaults of unique character, with open transverse arches and ribs above the stone bridges.|$|E
