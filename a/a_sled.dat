5|$|Conventions with {{significant}} numbers of fursuiters may offer an event known as the furry games, furry races, or critterlympics. These focus on feats of dexterity suited to multiple players in teams, such as dragging <b>a</b> <b>sled</b> filled with plush toys or other fursuiters around a marked track, or racing back and forth while tethered to one another with a hula hoop.|$|E
5|$|The Olympic program {{remained}} {{similar to}} previous Winter Olympics, {{with only a}} few exceptions: neither skeleton nor military patrol events were held; curling, which had appeared in the first Winter Olympic Games, was a non-medal demonstration sport in 1932, as were <b>a</b> <b>sled</b> dog race and women's speed skating. Both men and women competed in these Games, although the only medal events women contested were the ladies' singles and pairs in figure skating. Warm weather forced officials to hold the four-man bobsleigh competition two days after the closing ceremonies, which had been conducted on February 13.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the {{structure}} {{was used by}} and for student organizations. Formerly housed in the Calisthenium and Riding Academy and later the Alumnae Gymnasium, the Philaletheis Society moved into the Students' Building upon its opening and began to use the space for its theatrical performances. The junior prom, lectures from {{a wide array of}} speakers, and faculty-led skits all took place beneath the building's roof. Vassar's yearbook, the Vassarion, as well as its weekly newspaper, The Miscellany News, were also headquartered in the Students' Building. An annual Christmas party, complete with students clad as reindeer pulling <b>a</b> <b>sled</b> on which sat political science professor Charles Gordon Post dressed as Santa Claus, once occurred within the building as well.|$|E

5|$|Okba, old {{and worn}} out, comes and asks Thalaba to simply kill him and end his misery. However, Thalaba denies the request. The angel of death, Azrael, tells Thalaba that either Okba or Laila must die. Okba uses this {{chance to try}} and stab Thalaba, but Laila steps in between them and is killed. Okba curses God for his fate but Thalaba can only feel pity over the scene. After leaving, {{he is able to}} come to Simorg's valley. Simorg directs Thalaba to take <b>a</b> <b>sled</b> to {{continue}} on his way while the spirit of Laila asks Thalaba to end Okba's misery. However, Thalaba refuses to commit vengeance and he travels onwards until he arrives at a small boat waiting for him. He is taken down a river to the sea where Thalaba tosses away his magic ring. He is then taken to a cave that would lead him to the domain of the sorcerers.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility for the {{expedition}} {{was given to}} Sivert Klevan, an engineer with a good instinct for public relations. The ice was to be procured from the glacier Svartisen, and a glaciologist was brought along to give advice. It {{soon became clear that}} the entire three-ton block could not be brought out in one go. Instead, 200kg blocks were cut out with a chainsaw, carried away on <b>a</b> <b>sled,</b> and flown by helicopter down to the town centre. There they were melted together to make a block of ice weighing 3,050kg. The block was placed in a specially constructed iron container, which was insulated with wood and glass wool. The container was placed on top of a truck that would carry {{it all the way to}} the Equator, accompanied by a van carrying equipment and a sedan with a film crew.|$|E
5|$|On 21 February 2007, a Class 73 derailed {{after hitting}} an {{avalanche}} between Hallingskeid and Myrdal on the Bergen Line. The accident {{raised questions about}} the class's abilities to handle hard snow, such as in avalanches. In particular, a DNV report from 1999 had shown that the train could act as <b>a</b> <b>sled,</b> lose contact with the tracks and slide on top of the snow. A former NSB employee who worked with route planning, stated that a locomotive-hauled train would be better suitable for such situations, because more of the weight is located {{at the front of the}} train, and it will therefore plow instead of slide. The National Rail Administration said that they took extra precautions for the Class 73 trains and that during snowfall they would run a snow-clearing unit ahead of all Class 73 runs. NSB stated that they would consider the possibility of reverting to conventional trains, but that unless new information could shed light on the situation, they would retain use of the Class 73 trains.|$|E

25|$|In 2017, a {{study showed}} that 9,000 YBP the {{domestic}} dog was present at what is now Zhokhov Island, arctic north-eastern Siberia, however this area {{was connected to the}} mainland then. The dogs were selectively bred as either sled dogs or as hunting dogs, which implies that <b>a</b> <b>sled</b> dog standard and a hunting dog standard existed at that time. The optimal maximum size for <b>a</b> <b>sled</b> dog is 20–25kg based on themo-regulation, and the ancient sled dogs were between 16–25kg. The same standard has been found in the remains of sled dogs from this region 2,000 YBP and in the modern Siberian husky breed standard. Other dogs were more massive at 30kg and appear to be dogs that had been crossed with wolves and used for polar bear hunting. At death, the heads of the dogs had been carefully separated from their bodies by humans and is thought to be for ceremonial reasons.|$|E
25|$|According to Christoph Baumer, the {{earliest}} discoveries of wheels in Mesopotamia {{come from the}} first half of the third millennium BCE – more than half a millennium later than the first finds from the Kuban region. At the same time, in Mesopotamia, some intriguing early pictograms of <b>a</b> <b>sled</b> that rests on wooden rollers or wheels have been found. They date from about the same time as the early wheel discoveries in Europe and may indicate knowledge of the wheel.|$|E

25|$|In winter, both on {{land and}} on sea ice, the Inuit used dog sleds (qamutik) for transportation. The husky dog breed comes from Inuit {{breeding}} of dogs and wolves for transportation. A team of dogs in either a tandem/side-by-side or fan formation would pull <b>a</b> <b>sled</b> made of wood, animal bones, or the baleen from a whale's mouth and even frozen fish, over the snow and ice. The Inuit used stars to navigate at sea and landmarks to navigate on land; they possessed a comprehensive native system of toponymy. Where natural landmarks were insufficient, the Inuit would erect an inukshuk.|$|E
25|$|In December 1912, Aurora {{returned}} {{to find that}} Douglas Mawson, Xavier Mertz, and Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis had set out on <b>a</b> <b>sled</b> expedition, and were overdue on their return. The captain attempted {{to wait for the}} expedition to return, but poor anchorage and extremely strong winds combined to cause a number of anchor chains to break. At the end of January the ship had to leave to pick up the Western Base Party. After yet another long blizzard delaying them further, they left on 8 February, reaching the Western Base party on 23 February, loaded quickly and headed North, arriving in Hobart on 15 March.|$|E
25|$|Very {{little is}} known about the process of {{quarrying}} the stone and transporting it to the sites of the circles. One exception is at Vestra Fiold in Orkney, where Colin Richards led an excavation that determined that the stones used for the Orcadian stone circles were cut from a horizontal seam of bedrock that was located just below the surface. These had been eased over a large pit and supported on stone trestles, after which wooden rollers and <b>a</b> <b>sled</b> were likely positioned underneath, allowing the megalith to be moved. One of these stones, which weighed over 10 tonnes, had been left in its original position poised on stone supports, to be discovered by the archaeological excavators.|$|E

50|$|The storm {{system has}} caused {{at least three}} deaths in Oklahoma, one in <b>a</b> <b>sledding</b> {{accident}} and two in an auto crash. On February 1, a 20-year-old Oklahoma City woman died due to injuries suffered in <b>a</b> <b>sledding</b> accident near Lake Stanley Draper, in which the sled being pulled by a vehicle veered off the road, flinging the woman into a guardrail; she was pronounced dead at the scene. Two days later as slick road conditions continued across parts of the state, a truck carrying eight people ran off of a bridge and fell into the Spring River (which had been covered in ice), on I-44 in Ottawa County near Miami, killing two people; one of two westbound lanes of I-44 was reopened to traffic the previous evening after blizzard conditions made it impassible.|$|R
25|$|The Call of the Wild {{is a short}} {{adventure}} novel by Jack London published in 1903 and set in Yukon, Canada during the 1890s Klondike Gold Rush, when strong sled dogs were in high demand. The central character {{of the novel is}} a dog named Buck. The story opens at a ranch in Santa Clara Valley, California, when Buck is stolen from his home and sold into service as <b>a</b> <b>sled</b> dog in Alaska. He becomes progressively feral in the harsh environment, where he is forced to fight to survive and dominate other dogs. By the end, he sheds the veneer of civilization, and relies on primordial instinct and learned experience to emerge as a leader in the wild.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{stunning}} finds of royal statues dating to his reign was made as recently as 1989 {{in the courtyard of}} Amenhotep III's colonnade of the Temple of Luxor where a cache of statues was found, including a -high pink quartzite statue of the king wearing the Double Crown found in near-perfect condition. It was mounted on <b>a</b> <b>sled,</b> and may have been a cult statue. The only damage it had sustained was that the name of the god Amun had been hacked out wherever it appeared in the pharaoh's cartouche, clearly done as part of the systematic effort to eliminate any mention of this god during the reign of his successor, Akhenaten.|$|E
