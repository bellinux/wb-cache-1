40|$|Progress {{toward the}} {{implementation}} of distributed engine control in an aerospace application may be accelerated {{through the development of}} a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) system for testing new control architectures and hardware outside of a physical test cell environment. One component required in an HIL simulation system is a high-fidelity model of the control platform: sensors, actuators, and the control law. The control system developed for the Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation 40 k (40, 000 pound force thrust) (C-MAPSS 40 k) provides a verifiable baseline for development of a model for simulating a distributed control architecture. This distributed controller model will contain enhanced hardware models, capturing the dynamics of the transducer and the effects of data processing, and a model of the controller network. A multilevel framework is presented that establishes three sets of interfaces in the control platform: communication with the engine (through sensors and actuators), communication between hardware and controller (over a network), and the physical connections within individual pieces of hardware. This introduces modularity at each level of the model, encouraging collaboration in the development and testing of various control schemes or hardware designs. At the hardware level, this modularity is leveraged through the creation of a Simulink (R) library containing blocks for constructing smart transducer models complying with the IEEE 1451 specification. These hardware models were incorporated in a distributed version of the baseline C-MAPSS 40 k controller and simulations were run to compare the performance of the two models. The overall tracking ability differed only due to quantization effects in the feedback measurements in the distributed controller. Additionally, it was also found that the added complexity of the smart transducer models did not prevent real-time operation of the distributed controller model, a requirement of <b>an</b> <b>HIL</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A control-oriented {{model of}} a Dual Clutch Transmission (DCT) was {{developed}} for real-time Hardware In the Loop (HIL) applications, to support model-based development of the DCT controller and to systematically test its performance. The model is an innovative attempt to repro-duce the fast dynamics of the actuation system while maintaining a simulation step size large enough for real-time applications. The model comprehends a detailed physical description of hydraulic cir-cuit, clutches, synchronizers and gears, and simplified vehicle and internal combustion engine sub-models. As the oil circulating in the system has a large bulk modulus, the pressure dynamics are very fast, possibly causing instability in a real-time simulation; the same challenge involves the servo valves dynamics, due to the very small masses of the moving elements. Therefore, the hydraulic cir-cuit model has been modified and simplified without losing physical validity, in order to adapt it to the real-time simulation requirements.

40|$|Dynamic testing {{plays an}} {{important}} part in the vehicle seat suspension study. However, a large amount of research work on vibration control of vehicle seat suspension to date has been limited to simulations because the use of a full-size vehicle to test the device is an expensive and dangerous task. In order to decrease the product development time and cost as well as to improve the design quality, in this research, a vibration generation platform is developed for simulating the road induced vehicle vibration in laboratory. Different from existing driving simulation platforms, this research focuses on the vehicle chassis vibration simulation and the control of motion platform to make sure the platform can more accurately generate the actual vehicle vibration movement. A seven degree-of-freedom (DOF) full-vehicle model with varying road inputs is used to simulate the real vehicle vibration. Moreover, because the output vibration data of the vehicle model is all about the absolute heave, pitch and roll velocities of the sprung mass, in order to simulate the vibration in all dimensions, a Stewart multiple-DOF motion platform is designed to generate the required vibration. As a result, the whole vibration simulator becomes <b>a</b> hardware-in-the-loop (<b>HIL)</b> <b>system.</b> The hardware consists of a computer used to calculate the required vibration signals, a Stewart platform used to generate the real movement, and a controller used to control the movement of the platform and implemented by a National Instruments (NI) CompactRIO board. The data, which is from the vehicle model, can be converted into the length of the six legs of the Stewart platform. Therefore, the platform can transfer into the same posture as the real vehicle chassis at that moment. The success of the developed platform is demonstrated by HIL experiments of actuators. As there are six actuators installed in the motion platform, the signals from six encoders are used as the feedback signals for the control of the length of the actuators, and advanced control strategies are developed to control the movement of the platform to make sure the platform can accurately generate the required motion even in heavy load situations. Theoretical study is conducted on how to generate the reasonable vibration signals suitable for vehicle seat vibration tests in different situations and how to develop advanced control strategies for accurate control of the motion platform. Both simulation and experimental studies are conducted to validate the proposed approaches...|$|R
40|$|Control design {{plays an}} {{important}} role in wind energy conversion systems in achieving high efficiency and performance. In this study, hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations are carried out to design a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm for small vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs). Wind torque is calculated and applied to an electrical motor that drives the generator in the HIL simulator, which mimics the dynamics of the rotor. To deal with disturbance torques in the <b>HIL</b> <b>system,</b> <b>a</b> virtual plant is introduced to obtain an error between the speeds in the <b>HIL</b> <b>system</b> and virtual plant. This error is used by a proportional-integral (PI) controller to generate a disturbance torque compensation signal. The MPPT algorithm is tested in the HIL simulator under various wind conditions, and the results are compared with numerical simulations. The HIL simulator successfully mimics the dynamics of the VAWT under various wind conditions and provides a realistic framework for control designs...|$|R
