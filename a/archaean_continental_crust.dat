Geologically investigated area is made up of varied assemblages of rock types ranging from gneiss, ancient supracrustals of Sargur group, Peninsular gneiss, ultramafics, meta-ultramafites, amygdaloidal metabasalt and pillowed/BIF, granodorite, amphibolite and to younger intrusives of Neo-proterozoic age. Felsites in alternation with pegmatites are also exposed. Quartzo-feldspathic veins traverses the felsites at places and felsite with large phenocryst of feldspar are also found. At places felsites are highly jointed and the joint plane trend in E-W direction. Petrographic study shows that felsites are aphanitic and porphyritc in texture. The field and petrographic studies coupled with chemistry data suggest that the felsites dykes of the study area have evolved from a complex crystallization history and are formed in a volcanic arc granitic environment. The concentration of uranium up to 7. 1 ppm indicates the potentiality of felsites for the occurrence of radioactive elements...|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{economic}} importance of chalcophile (sulfide-loving) and siderophile (metal-loving) elements (CSEs), {{it is unclear}} how they become enriched or depleted in the <b>continental</b> <b>crust,</b> compared with the oceanic crust. This {{is due in part to}} our limited understanding of the partitioning behaviour of the CSEs. Here I compile compositional data for mid-ocean ridge basalts and subduction-related volcanic rocks. I show that the mantle-derived melts that contribute to oceanic and <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> formation rarely avoid sulfide saturation during cooling in the crust and, on average, subduction-zone magmas fractionate sulfide at the base of the <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> prior to ascent. Differentiation of mantle-derived melts enriches lower crustal sulfide- and silicate-bearing cumulates in some CSEs compared with the upper crust. This storage predisposes the cumulate-hosted compatible CSEs (such as Cu and Au) to be recycled back into the mantle during subduction and delamination, resulting in their low contents in the bulk <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> and potentially contributing to the scarcity of ore deposits in the upper <b>continental</b> <b>crust.</b> By contrast, differentiation causes the upper oceanic and <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> to become enriched in incompatible CSEs (such as W) compared with the lower oceanic and <b>continental</b> <b>crust.</b> Consequently, incompatible CSEs are predisposed to become enriched in subduction-zone magmas that contribute to <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> formation and are less susceptible to removal from the <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> via delamination compared with the compatible CSEs...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} {{mechanisms for}} early <b>Archaean</b> <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> are controversial. Continental crust may have accumulated via horizontal accretion in modern-style subduction zones or via vertical accretion above upper mantle upwelling zones. However, {{the characteristics of}} the continental crust changes at the transition between the Archaean and Proterozoic eons, suggesting that continental crust did not form in subduction zones until at least the late Archaean. Here I use seismic receiver function data to analyse the bulk properties of continental crust in Western Australia, which formed and stabilized over a billion years in the Archaean. I find that the bulk seismic properties of the crust cluster spatially, with similar clusters confined within the boundaries of tectonic terranes. I use local Archaean crustal growth models to show that both plume and subduction processes may have had a role in creating crust throughout the Archaean. A correlation between crustal age and the bulk seismic properties of the crust reveals a trend: from about 3. 5 Gyr ago (Ga) {{to the end of the}} Archaean, the crust gradually thickened and simultaneously became more evolved in composition. I propose that this trend reflects the transition between crust dominantly formed above mantle plumes, to crust formed in subduction zones-a transition that may reflect secular cooling of Earth's mantle. 6 page(s...|$|E
40|$|International audienceUntil {{recently}} {{it was assumed}} that the <b>Archaean</b> <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> (made of TTGs: tonalites, trondhjemites, and granodiorites) was generated through partial melting of MORB-like basalts in hot subduction environments, where the subducted oceanic crust melted at high pressure, leaving a garnet-bearing amphibolitic or eclogitic residue. However, recent geochemical models as well as basalt melting experiments have precluded MORB as a plausible source for TTGs. Rather, geochemical and experimental evidences indicate that formation of TTG required a LILE-enriched source, similar to oceanic plateau basalts. Moreover, subduction is a continuous process, while continental growth is episodic. Several “super-growth events” have been identified at ~ 4. 2, ~ 3. 8, ~ 3. 2, ~ 2. 7, ~ 1. 8, ~ 1. 1, and ~ 0. 5 Ga, which is inconsistent with the regular pattern that would be expected from a subduction-driven process. In order to account for this periodicity, it has been proposed that, as subduction proceeds, descending residual slabs accumulate at the 660 -km seismic discontinuity. When stored oceanic crust exceeds a certain mass threshold, it rapidly sinks into the mantle as a cold avalanche, which induces the ascent of mantle plumes that in turn produce large amounts of magmas resulting in oceanic plateaus. However, melting at the base of thick oceanic plateaus {{does not appear to be}} a realistic process that can account for TTG genesis. Modern oceanic plateaus contain only small volumes (≤ 5 %) of felsic magmas generally formed by high degrees of fractional crystallization of basaltic magmas. The composition of these felsic magmas drastically differs from that of TTGs. In Iceland, the interaction between a mantle plume and the mid-Atlantic ridge gives rise to an anomalously (Archaean-like) high geothermal gradient resulting in thick basaltic crust able to melt at shallow depth. Even in this favorable context though, the characteristic Archaean TTG trace element signature is not being produced. Consequently, internal recycling of oceanic plateaus does not appear to be a suitable process for the genesis of <b>Archaean</b> <b>continental</b> <b>crust.</b> A possible alternative to this scenario is the subduction of oceanic plateaus. This hypothesis is supported by a present-day analog. In Ecuador, the Carnegie ridge, which is an oceanic plateau resulting from the Galapagos hot spot activity, is being subducted beneath the South American plate. Not only are the resulting magmas adakitic (TTG-like) in composition, but the volcanic productivity is several times greater than in other parts of the Andean volcanic arc. Above the location where the plateau is subducted, the arc is wide and the quaternary volcanoes numerous (about 80 active edifices). The volcanic productivity of each individual volcano also is more intense than away from the subduction focal point with an average output rate of about 0. 4 – 0. 5 km 3 ·ka− 1 compared with only about 0. 05 – 0. 2 km 3 ·ka− 1 for production rates at volcanoes erupting in the rest of the arc. Consequently, we infer that occasional subduction of oceanic plateaus throughout Earth's history can account for the episodic nature of crustal growth. Additionally, the generation by this mechanism of huge volumes of TTG-like magmas would readily dominate the crustal growth record...|$|E

East Antarctica {{is dominated}} by the East Antarctic Craton, which consists of fragments of <b>Archaean</b> <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> surrounded by polydeformed orogenic belts (e. g. Maud Belt). The Maud Belt in Dronning Maud Land preserves a high-grade polyphase tectono-thermal history. This belt has traditionally been interpreted as a Mesoproterozoic-age (1. 3 - 0. 9 Ga) mobile belt that was later affected by thermal overprint associated with little or no deformation during the Neoproterozoic (0. 6 - 0. 5 Ga). Therefore the Maud Belt {{has been used as a}} piercing point in Mesoproterozoic supercontinent reconstruction. However, with the growing number of geochronological data pointing to major structural reworking and not just a thermal overprint of the Mesoproterozoic crust during the Pan-African orogeny thereby challenging early models of Mesoproterozoic supercontinent reconstruction. Areas east and west of Gjelsvikfjella record major Pan-African reworking. Thus the outcrops of Gjelsvikfjella provide the linkage between the two areas. Yet, so far little data has been available for this crucial sector. Therefore, detailed fieldwork in the Gjelsvikfjella coupled with petrographic, geochemical and geochronogical data obtained from carefully selected samples reveal a complex tectono-thermal history for this part of the Maud Belt. The SHRIMP U-Pb zircon data obtained make it possible to differentiate between a series of magmatic and metamorphic events. The oldest event recorded is the formation of an extensive, 1140 - 1130 Ma, volcanic arc. This was followed by 1104 ± 8 Ma granitoids that might represent, together with so far undated mafic dykes part of a decompression melting-related bimodal suite.

40|$|The enigmatic Arequipa Massif {{of southwestern}} Peru is an outcrop of Andean {{basement}} that underwent Grenville-age metamorphism, {{and as such}} {{it is important for}} the better constraint of Laurentia–Amazonia ties in Rodinia reconstruction models. U–Pb SHRIMP zircon dating has yielded new evidence on the evolution of the Massif between Middle Paleoproterozoic and Early Paleozoic. The oldest rock-forming events occurred in major orogenic events between ca. 1. 79 and 2. 1 Ga (Orosirian to Rhyacian), involving early magmatism (1. 89 – 2. 1 Ga, presumably emplaced through partly <b>Archaean</b> <b>continental</b> <b>crust),</b> sedimentation of a thick sequence of terrigenous sediments, UHT metamorphism at ca. 1. 87 Ga, and late felsic magmatism at ca. 1. 79 Ga. The Atico sedimentary basin developed in the Late-Mesoproterozoic and detrital zircons were fed from a source area similar to the high-grade Paleoproterozoic basement, but also from an unknown source that provided Mesoproterozoic zircons of 1200 – 1600 Ma. The Grenville-age metamorphism was of low-P type; it both reworked the Paleoproterozoic rocks and also affected the Atico sedimentary rocks. Metamorphism was diachronous: ca. 1040 Ma in the Quilca and Camaná areas and in the San Juán Marcona domain, 940 ± 6 Ma in the Mollendo area, and between 1000 and 850 Ma in the Atico domain. These metamorphic domains are probably tectonically juxtaposed. Comparison with coeval Grenvillian processes in Laurentia and in southern Amazonia raises the possibility that Grenvillian metamorphism in the Arequipa Massif resulted from extension and not from collision. The Arequipa Massif experienced Ordovician–Silurian magmatism at ca. 465 Ma, including anorthosites formerly considered to be Grenvillian, and high-T metamorphism deep within the magmatic arc. Focused retrogression along shear zones or unconformities took place between 430 and 440 Ma. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDespite the {{consensus}} that TTGs, the main constituents of the <b>Archaean</b> <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> worldwide, originated by partial melting of garnet-bearing amphibolites, natural evidence is scarce. A large variety of Archaean amphibole-rich rocks, including migmatitic amphibolites and hornblende-rich cumulates, was exhumed as a tectonic melange in the Inyoni shear zone (ISZ) near Barberton (South Africa), likely {{at the time}} of emplacement of the 3. 2 Ga Nelshoogte-Badplaas plutons. This unique collection provides the opportunity to investigate partial melting of garnet-amphibolites, as well as the differentiation processes occurring in the TTG magmas en route to the surface. The ISZ migmatitic amphibolites are characterized by quartz-plagioclase leucosomes in equilibrium with garnet, amphibole, titanite ± epidote. Garnet compositions are characterized by high almandine and grossular contents. Actually, the leucosomes and neosomes likely lost part of their melt component and mesosomes may have been also modified towards restite-rich compositions due to melt segregation. Restite-bearing rocks are very iron-rich according to their high contents in garnet. Besides, the Mg-rich compositions of the hornblende cumulates and their REE distribution patterns resemble those of the nearby TT (tonalite-trondhjemite) plutons. Thermobarometric estimates from the ISZ migmatitic rocks cluster in the range 720 - 800 °C and 1. 1 - 1. 2 GPa for the melting reaction and the derived geothermal gradient is ca 17 - 22 °C/km. These conditions are consistent with either water-present melting or, more likely, water-absent epidote-dehydration melting. Such a geothermal gradient is therefore assigned to the genesis of large volumes of medium-pressure TTG magmas, that will likely form at greater depth. Unmelted garnet-bearing amphibolites correspond to slightly lower conditions. The magmatic cumulates crystallized at ca 0. 6 GPa. The cumulate rocks evidence that the TTG parental magmas en route to the surface experienced fractional crystallization of a large amount of amphibole before crystallizing as tonalite-trondhjemite plutons at slightly shallower depths (ca 0. 5 GPa) ...|$|E
40|$|Understanding how the Earth’s first {{continental}} {{land masses}} were generated {{is important because}} the processes responsible directly affected {{the evolution of the}} planet’s primordial silicate interior, and also its atmosphere and hydrosphere. <b>Archaean</b> <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> is dominated by rocks of the trondhjemite–tonalite–granodiorite (TTG) suite. These can be divided into (1) a mid- to late Archaean (3. 5 – 2. 5 Ga) suite with low SiO 2 and high MgO, Sr and transition element contents, and (2) an Eoarchaean (&# 62; 3. 5 Ga) suite with higher SiO 2 and lower MgO, Sr and transition element concentrations. Cenozoic adakites are considered to be compositionally similar to mid- to late Archaean (3. 5 – 2. 5 Ga) TTGs, but not the oldest TTG rocks. Conversely, a suite of Early Eocene adakite-like rhyodacites (Jamaican-type adakites: JTA) from Jamaica are shown to be geochemically similar to the Eoarchaean TTGs. In contrast to newly discovered JTA-like rocks (Ryozen low Sr/Y) in Japan, new trace element and Nd–Hf radiogenic isotope data in this study confirm that the Jamaican JTA cannot be formed by complex mixing, assimilation and fractional crystallization processes. New partial melt models here explore several different source compositions (mid-ocean ridge basalt, ocean island basalt and oceanic plateau), mineral modes, melt modes and partition coefficients. The results of these models clearly demonstrate that the JTA and the Eoarchaean TTG can be generated by partial melting of plagioclase- and garnet-bearing amphibolite source regions with oceanic plateau-like compositions. Further modelling shows that the JTA and Eoarchaean TTG low MgO and transition element abundances can be derived from two dominant processes: (1) relatively shallow partial melting of subducting oceanic crust (compositionally similar to Mesozoic oceanic plateau basalt) whereby the slab melts ascend without interacting with a mantle wedge; (2) partial melting of oceanic plateau-like subducting oceanic crust followed by interaction of the slab melts with a thin and/or discontinuous (boudinage-like?) mantle wedge whereby the expected increase of MgO, Ni, and Cr in the slab melts is obliterated by fractional crystallization of ferromagnesian minerals (mostly amphibole). Consequently, using the JTA as a modern analogue for Eoarchaean TTG production, we propose the existence of subduction zones consuming oceanic plateau-like oceanic crust in Eoarchaean times...|$|E

40|$|The Lewisian {{complex of}} NW Scotland is dominantly {{composed}} of Archaean tonalitic to granodioritic gneisses, ultramafic bodies and minor metasedimentary components. Although {{the area is}} internationally well known and has been much studied for over a century, the recognition and precise timing of some high-grade metamorphic events has proven difficult to ascertain. This {{is partly due to}} repeated deformational and metamorphic episodes in the Palaeoproterozoic which overprint and obscure earlier events. We present data from both laser ablation (LA) ICP-MS and an adaptation of a U-Pb chemical abrasion ID-TIMS technique applied to multi-age component zircons from the Assynt (“Central”) block of this region. The new data reveal a previously unrecognised complexity and provide the first unequivocal proof of an Archean to Paleoproterozoic granulite metamorphic event in the Assynt area. LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dating has indicated a ca 2. 8 Ga protolith age for a tonalitic gneiss with evidence for a ca. 3. 5 Ga xenocrystic component (the oldest discovered in the UK). Non-conventional U-Pb ID-TIMS utilising a combination of high-temperature annealing followed by multi-step incremental dissolution on single grains allows identification of Pb-loss and multi-generational age trajectories on 206 Pb/ 238 U- 207 Pb/ 235 U plots. A combination of LA-ICP-MS and this non-conventional TIMS work has dated zircon growth at ca 2. 7 Ga (“Badcallian”) and 2. 5 Ga (“Inverian”) with later Pb-loss occurring at ca 1. 9 Ga and ca 1. 7 Ga (early and late “Laxfordian” respectively). This TIMS method is unique in that it combines a pseudo-spatial resolution normally associated with an in-situ technique but benefits from the highprecision analysis required to differentiate between these metamorphic events at ca 2. 7 and 2. 5 Ga. Zircon Hf isotopes indicate that some gneisses from the Assynt area are typical of <b>Archaean</b> <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> (epsilon Hf ca - 1). The tonalite gneisses however have strongly negative epsilon Hf values of - 7 to - 10 indicating a more complex history of derivation through partial melting of ancient crust with residual garnet as a long-lived control on Hf. Moreover, consistent zircon epsilon Hf values from inherited cores, igneous overgrowths and two separate metamorphic events indicate that the tonalitic gneisses were formed by crustal recycling, rather than new additions to the crust. These events may be summarised as: zircon crystallisation from a magma at ca 3. 5 Ga, partial melting and crustal recycling producing the tonalite gneiss protoliths at ca 2. 8 Ga, a prolonged lower crustal residence in granulite P-T conditions by ca 2. 7 Ga, further metamorphism in amphibolite conditions at ca 2. 5 Ga and later deformation associated with punctuated terrane amalgamation events between ca 1. 9 Ga and ca 1. 7 Ga. The occurrence of a 2. 7 Ga metamorphic event preserved in gneisses from Assynt contradicts the assertion of some previous studies that it does not exist in this region and suggests at least some local terrane amalgamation occurred in the Archean...|$|E

50|$|It is {{a matter}} of debate whether the amount of <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> has been increasing, decreasing, or {{remaining}} constant over geological time. One model indicates that at prior to 3.7 Ga ago <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> constituted less than 10% of the present amount.By 3.0 Ga ago the amount was about 25%, and following a period of rapid crustal evolution it was about 60% of the current amount by 2.6 Ga ago. The growth of <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> appears to have occurred in spurts of increased activity corresponding to five episodes of increased production through geologic time.|$|R
40|$|No Hadean rocks {{have ever}} been found on Earth's surface except for zircons [...] -evidence of <b>continental</b> <b>crust,</b> {{suggesting}} that Hadean <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> existed but later disappeared. One hypothesis for {{the disappearance of the}} <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> is excavation/melting by the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB), a concentration of impacts in the last phase of the Hadean eon. In this paper, we calculate the effects of LHB on Hadean <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> in order to investigate this hypothesis. Approximating the size-frequency distribution of the impacts by a power-law scaling with an exponent α as a parameter, we have derived semi-analytical expressions for the effects of LHB impacts. We calculated the total excavation/melting volume and area affected by the LHB from two constraints of LHB on the moon, the size of the largest basin during LHB, and the density of craters larger than 20 km. We also investigated the effects of the value of α. Our results show that LHB does not excavate/melt all of Hadean <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> directly, but over 70...|$|R
50|$|Geologically {{the continents}} largely {{correspond}} to areas of <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> {{that are found}} on the continental plates. However some areas of <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> are regions covered with water not usually included {{in the list of}} continents. The area referred to as Zealandia is one such area (see submerged continents below).|$|R
50|$|The <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> is {{typically}} from 30 km to 50 km thick and is mostly composed of slightly less dense rocks {{than those of}} the oceanic crust. Some of these less dense rocks, such as granite, are common in the <b>continental</b> <b>crust</b> but rare to absent in the oceanic crust.|$|R
