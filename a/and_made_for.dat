5|$|Alexios, who was {{fighting}} with his retinue alongside the Franks, {{did not immediately}} realize that his left wing had collapsed. In the meantime, on his right wing, the Chomatenoi, engaged with Tarchaneiotes's men, were outflanked and attacked in the rear by the Pechenegs, who had somehow evaded Alexios's Turkish flank-guards. The Chomatenoi too broke and fled, and Alexios's fate seemed sealed. At this point the Pechenegs failed to follow up their success, and instead turned back and began looting Bryennios's own camp. After gathering what plunder they could, they left the battle <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> their homes.|$|E
5|$|Amid {{a torrent}} of Japanese fire, the Australians broke contact <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> the landing craft, {{bringing}} the wounded out with them. The embarkation took only five minutes, but as the vessels attempted to depart two of them, overloaded with about 60 men on board, ran aground and stuck fast. In an effort to lighten the load, several men volunteered to leave the craft, which enabled one of the vessels to float free. The other, however, remained stuck. Coming under attack from the Japanese, some of whom waded out and attacked {{the men in the}} vessel with grenades, the casualties mounted, with a number of men, including Downs, being either killed or lost overboard and subsequently listed as missing, presumed killed.|$|E
5|$|Diocletian was in Antioch in {{the autumn}} of 302, when the next {{instance}} of persecution occurred. The deacon Romanus visited a court while preliminary sacrifices were taking place and interrupted the ceremonies, denouncing the act in a loud voice. He was arrested and sentenced to be set aflame, but Diocletian overruled the decision, and decided that Romanus should have his tongue removed instead. Romanus would be executed on November 18, 303. The boldness of this Christian displeased Diocletian, and he left the city <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> Nicomedia to spend the winter, accompanied by Galerius.|$|E

5|$|In early 766 a {{prisoner}} exchange {{took place between}} the two states in western Cilicia, followed by a resumption of large-scale hostilities. In August 766, a large Abbasid army, comprising many different national contingents, under al-Hasan ibn Qahtaba and al-Abbas ibn Muhammad, the brother of Caliph al-Mansur (r. 754–775), invaded Byzantine territory from Upper Mesopotamia <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> Kamacha. The campaign is dealt with briefly by Muslim historians such as al-Tabari, but is fully recorded in a contemporary Syriac Christian source, the so-called Zuqnin Chronicle, written by a monk of the Zuqnin Monastery near Amida.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant du Plooy led his {{men around}} the bend, {{carefully}} keeping them behind cover, then sent Coey {{out into the}} open riverbed to give treatment. With his Red Cross flag clearly visible, Coey came out from cover <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> the bodies on the ground. The concealed cadres immediately opened fire and fatally shot him through the head. His lifeless body fell at du Plooy's feet. Coey was the first American fatality of the Rhodesian Bush War. The contact in which he died eventually ended with du Plooy and two other Rhodesians being wounded and a further Rhodesian soldier, Corporal Jannie de Beer, being killed. The insurgents escaped without any further loss to their number.|$|E
5|$|On 22 January 1945 Z31, Z34 and Z38 laid {{mines in}} Magerøya, Laafjord, and Brei Sounds. On 25 January, Z31, Z34, and Z38 sailed out of Tromsø, making for the Baltic. On 28 January, while off the Sognefjord, the three destroyers were intercepted by a {{squadron}} of British ships, including the light cruisers Diadem, and Mauritius. During the battle, one of Z38s funnels caught fire, splitting a boiler tube. After this Z38 broke off from the battle, <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> Kiel alongside Z34. Once there she received 200 coastal artillerymen, {{to be taken to}} Gotenhafen.|$|E

5|$|She was {{commissioned}} on 25 March 1797 under Captain Henry Stanhope, becoming the third ship of the Royal Navy {{to bear the}} name Neptune. Her predecessors had been two 90-gun ships, the first launched in 1683, renamed HMS Torbay in 1750 and sold in 1784. The second had been launched in 1757, {{was used as a}} sheer hulk from 1784, and was broken up in 1816. Stanhope sailed from Woolwich on 11 June 1797, flying the broad pendant of Commodore Sir Erasmus Gower, <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> the Nore.|$|E
5|$|The 21st, about 960 strong, {{boarded the}} steamer Northerner on January 6, 1862. The fleet {{transporting}} Burnside's North Carolina Expedition encountered harsh weather {{off the coast}} of Cape Hatteras. Prolonged poor weather and the shallowness of Hatteras Inlet resulted in weeks of delay as the fleet struggled to enter Pamlico Sound. Finally, just as most of the vessels began to run low on potable water, the fleet entered the sound <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> Roanoke Island on February 5, 1862.|$|E
5|$|Behind Royal Sovereign was Marlborough, {{inextricably}} {{tangled with}} Impétueux. Badly damaged {{and on the}} verge of surrender, Impétueux was briefly reprieved when Mucius appeared through the smoke and collided with both ships. The three entangled ships continued exchanging fire for some time, all suffering heavy casualties with Marlborough and Impétueux losing all three of their masts. This combat continued for several hours. Captain Berkeley of Marlborough had to retire below with serious wounds, and command fell to Lieutenant John Monkton, who signalled for help from the frigates in reserve. Robert Stopford responded in HMS Aquilon, which had the assignment of repeating signals, and towed Marlborough out of the line as Mucius freed herself <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> the regrouped French fleet to the north. Impétueux was in too damaged a state to move at all, and was soon seized by sailors from HMS Russell.|$|E

5|$|By {{the start}} of the operation, Bismarcks crew had {{increased}} to 2,221 officers and enlisted men. This included an admiral's staff of nearly 65 and a prize crew of 80 sailors, who could be used to crew transports captured during the mission. At 02:00 on 19 May, Bismarck departed Gotenhafen <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> the Danish straits. She was joined at 11:25 by Prinz Eugen, which had departed the previous night at 21:18, off Cape Arkona. The two ships were escorted by three destroyers—, , and —and a flotilla of minesweepers. The Luftwaffe provided air cover during the voyage out of German waters. At around noon on 20 May, Lindemann informed the ship's crew via loudspeaker of the ship's mission. At approximately the same time, a group of ten or twelve Swedish aircraft flying reconnaissance encountered the German force and reported its composition and heading, though the Germans did not see the Swedes.|$|E
5|$|In September 1879 the Jeannette, an ex-Royal Navy gunboat {{converted}} by the US Navy for Arctic exploration, and {{commanded by}} George W. De Long, entered the pack ice {{north of the}} Bering Strait. She remained ice-bound for nearly two years, drifting {{to the area of}} the New Siberian Islands, before being crushed and sunk on 13 June 1881. Her crew escaped in boats <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> the Siberian coast; most, including De Long, subsequently perished either during the boat journey or in the wastelands of the Lena River delta. Three years later, relics from the Jeannette appeared {{on the opposite side of}} the world, in the vicinity of Julianehaab on the southwest coast of Greenland. These items, frozen into the drifting ice, included clothing bearing crew members' names and documents signed by De Long; they were indisputably genuine.|$|E
5|$|The lack of patrolling by MacGregor's troops {{allowed the}} Spanish to march {{straight}} into Porto Bello early on 30 April 1819. MacGregor {{was still in}} bed when the Spaniards found his riflemen drilling in the main square and opened fire. Awoken by the noise, MacGregor threw his bed and blankets from the window onto the beach below and jumped out after them, then attempted to paddle out to his ships on a log. He passed out and would probably have drowned {{had he not been}} picked up and brought aboard the Hero by one of his naval officers. MacGregor would claim that on regaining consciousness he immediately raised his standard over the Hero, then despatched runners to Rafter ordering him not to surrender. The version of events favoured by Sinclair is that Rafter received orders to this effect only after he had himself contacted MacGregor on the Hero. Rafter, in the fort with 200 men, kept up a steady barrage and waited for his commander to fire on the royalists from the ships—but to the colonel's astonishment MacGregor instead ordered his fleet to turn about <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> the high seas. Abandoned, Colonel Rafter and the remnants of MacGregor's army {{had no choice but to}} surrender; most of the surviving officers and troops entered miserable existences in captivity. Rafter was ultimately shot with 11 other officers for conspiring to escape.|$|E

5|$|There, Troglita {{positioned}} himself between the Matmata plateau and the coast, and awaited the Moors. He also sent for ships to bring supplies, but adverse winds made this impossible. When the Moorish army appeared nearby it was likewise exhausted from hunger <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> some sources of water, which Troglita {{set out to}} reach first. The Byzantines camped at Marta {{in the district of}} Gallica, where battle was joined. It was a disastrous defeat for the Byzantines, whose army broke and fled. Corippus, possibly in an attempt to exculpate his hero Troglita, attributes the defeat to the indiscipline of some soldiers, who attacked the enemy before the army was ready, leading to a disorganized piecemeal engagement. According to Corippus's account, the Moorish allies of the Byzantines panicked first and retreated, causing the entire army to disintegrate, despite the personal intervention of Troglita and the other Byzantine leaders.|$|E
5|$|Thucydides gives {{only the}} barest of details for this battle; the most {{reliable}} detailed account is given by Plutarch. According to Plutarch, the Persian fleet was anchored off {{the mouth of the}} Eurymedon, awaiting the arrival of 80 Phoenician ships from Cyprus. Cimon, sailing from Phaselis, made to attack the Persians before the reinforcements arrived, whereupon the Persian fleet, eager to avoid fighting, retreated into the river itself. However, when Cimon continued to bear down on the Persians, they accepted battle. Regardless of their numbers, the Persian battle line was quickly breached, and the Persian ships then turned about, <b>and</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> the river bank. Grounding their ships, the crews sought sanctuary with the army waiting nearby. Some ships may have been captured or destroyed during the naval battle, but it seems likely that most were able to land.|$|E
