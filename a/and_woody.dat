5|$|It was {{difficult}} for crew members to perceive the film's quality {{during much of the}} production process when the finished footage was in scattered pieces and lacked elements like music and sound design. Some animators felt the film would be a significant disappointment commercially, but felt animators and animation fans would find it interesting. According to Lee Unkrich, one of the original editors of Toy Story, a scene was cut out of the original final edit. The scene features Sid, after Pizza Planet, torturing Buzz <b>and</b> <b>Woody</b> violently. Unkrich decided to cut right into the scene where Sid is interrogating the toys because the creators of the movie thought the audience would be loving Buzz <b>and</b> <b>Woody</b> at that point. Another scene, where Woody was trying to get Buzz's attention when he was stuck in the box crate, was shortened because the creators felt it would lose the energy of the movie. Peter Schneider had grown optimistic about the film as it neared completion, and announced a United States release date of November, coinciding with Thanksgiving weekend and the start of the winter holiday season.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Coarse <b>and</b> fine <b>woody</b> debris are {{substantial}} forest ecosystem carbon stocks; however, {{there is a}} lack of understanding how these detrital carbon stocks vary across forested landscapes. Because forest <b>woody</b> detritus production <b>and</b> decay rates may partially depend on climatic conditions, the accumulation of coarse <b>and</b> fine <b>woody</b> debris carbon stocks in forests may be correlated with climate. This study used a nationwide inventory of coarse <b>and</b> fine <b>woody</b> debris in the United States to examine how these carbon stocks vary by climatic regions and variables. Results Mean coarse <b>and</b> fine <b>woody</b> debris forest carbon stocks vary by Köppen's climatic regions across the United States. The highest carbon stocks were found in regions with cool summers while the lowest carbon stocks were found in arid desert/steppes or temperate humid regions. Coarse <b>and</b> fine <b>woody</b> debris carbon stocks were found to be positively correlated with available moisture and negatively correlated with maximum temperature. Conclusion It was concluded with only medium confidence that coarse <b>and</b> fine <b>woody</b> debris carbon stocks may be at risk of becoming net emitter of carbon under a global climate warming scenario as increases in coarse or fine woody debris production (sinks) may be more than offset by increases in forest woody detritus decay rates (emission). Given the preliminary results of this study and the rather tenuous status of coarse <b>and</b> fine <b>woody</b> debris carbon stocks as either a source or sink of CO 2, further research is suggested in the areas of forest detritus decay and production. </p...|$|R
