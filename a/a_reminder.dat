5|$|The {{concept of}} a {{character}} being confronted at a triumphant feast with <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> of their downfall {{is not unique to}} Shakespeare and may originate from the Belshazzar's feast episode of the Bible. The term 'ghost at the feast' has entered popular culture, and is often used as a metaphor for a subject a person would rather avoid considering, or (considering the general plot of Macbeth) <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> of a person's unpleasant past or likely future.|$|E

5|$|According to Christian theologian Gordon J. Wenham, {{the purpose}} of kashrut was to help Jews {{maintain}} a distinct and separate existence from other peoples; {{he says that the}} effect of the laws was to prevent socialization and intermarriage with non-Jews, preventing Jewish identity from being diluted. Wenham argued that since the impact of the food laws was a public affair, this would have enhanced Jewish attachment to them as <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> of their distinct status as Jews.|$|E
5|$|After the United States entered World War I in 1917, {{images of}} the statue were heavily used in both {{recruitment}} posters and the Liberty Bond drives that urged American citizens to support the war financially. This impressed upon the public the war's stated purpose—to secure liberty—and served as <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> that embattled France had given the United States the statue.|$|E
5|$|Between 1873 and 1875, mineowners Fletcher Burrows built a small {{model village}} at Howe Bridge, {{comprising}} cottages, shops, a village club, and a bath house for their employees. This Victorian village {{on either side}} of Leigh Road, together with St Michael and All Angel's Church, is a conservation area. The Ena Mill, one of Atherton's large spinning mills, complete with chimney, survives as <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> of the textile industry.|$|E

Results show that without <b>an</b> income <b>reminder,</b> WTP estimate associated with DC elicitation format is about 1. 66 times as large as that associated with OE elicitation format. With <b>an</b> income <b>reminder,</b> the WTP estimate associated with DC format decreased while the WTP estimate associated with OE format increased, and the divergence between the WTP estimates was almost eliminated. dichotomous choice, open-ended, income reminder, water quality improvement, willingness-to-pay, Research Methods/ Statistical Methods,...|$|R

5|$|A {{transitional}} fossil is any fossilized {{remains of}} a life form that exhibits traits common to both an ancestral group and its derived descendant group. This is especially important where the descendant group is sharply differentiated by gross anatomy and mode of living from the ancestral group. These fossils serve as <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> that taxonomic divisions are human constructs that have been imposed in hindsight on a continuum of variation. Because of the incompleteness of the fossil record, there is usually {{no way to know}} exactly how close a transitional fossil is to the point of divergence. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that transitional fossils are direct ancestors of more recent groups, though they are frequently used as models for such ancestors.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it is hard}} to {{test the}} hearing of sharks, they may have a sharp sense of hearing and can {{possibly}} hear prey from many miles away. A small opening on each side of their heads (not the spiracle) leads directly into the inner ear through a thin channel. The lateral line shows a similar arrangement, and is open to the environment via a series of openings called lateral line pores. This is <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> of the common origin of these two vibration- and sound-detecting organs that are grouped together as the acoustico-lateralis system. In bony fish and tetrapods the external opening into the inner ear has been lost.|$|E
5|$|During the English Civil War Plymouth {{sided with}} the Parliamentarians and was besieged for almost four years by the Royalists. The last major attack by the Royalists was by Sir Richard Grenville leading {{thousands}} of soldiers towards Plymouth, but they were defeated by the Plymothians at Freedom Fields Park. The civil war ended as a Parliamentary win, but monarchy was restored by King Charles II in 1660, who imprisoned many of the Parliamentary heroes on Drake's Island. Construction of the Royal Citadel began in 1665, after the Restoration; it was armed with cannon facing both out to sea and into the town, rumoured to be <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> to residents not to oppose the Crown. Mount Batten tower also dates from around this time.|$|E

5|$|Earlier {{on the day}} of the shooting, Loughner {{reportedly}} had an altercation {{with his}} father regarding a black bag the younger man took from a car trunk. A bag matching the description was later found in a nearby desert area containing 9mm ammunition, and it is believed to belong to Loughner. Later that morning, at approximately 7:30a.m., Loughner was stopped by an Arizona Game and Fish Department officer after running a red light, but was released with <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> when it was determined that he did not have any outstanding warrants.|$|E
5|$|Engine {{anti-ice}} {{was turned}} {{on for the}} two engines during taxi. The captain announced to passengers that the flaps would remain up during taxi, and {{they should not be}} worried seeing them in the retracted position. He placed an empty coffee cup on the flap handle as <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> of the position of the flaps, a procedure used by many flight crews. The captain told the first officer they would use standard USAir contaminated runway procedures that included the use of 18 degrees flaps, and also decided that they would take off with a reduced V1 speed of 110 knots.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Sunderland {{moved to}} their present ground, Stadium of Light in Monkwearmouth, which was opened by Prince Andrew, Duke of York. Built with an {{original}} capacity of 42,000, it hosted its first game against Dutch team Ajax. The stadium bears a similar {{name to the}} Portuguese club Benfica's ground Estádio da Luz, albeit in a different language. Stadium expansion in 2000 saw the capacity increase to 49,000. A Davy lamp monument stands outside the stadium, and a miners banner {{was presented to the}} club by the Durham Miners' Association, as <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> of the Monkwearmouth Colliery pit the stadium was built on.|$|E

5|$|In {{the post-war}} era, {{the park was}} long known chiefly for its {{isolated}} location and primitive camping facilities. In August 1952it played host to the first Woodsmen's Carnival, an annual celebration of the lumbering industry, which was again active in the second growth forests in the area. The festival, originally sponsored by the Penn-York Lumbermen's Club, features lumberjack competitions as <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> of the past, as well as displays of new equipment. In 1987the Galeton Rotary Club took over sponsorship, and renamed the event the Woodsmen's Show in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Leigh's wealth as an {{industrial}} town resulted in many outlets for the entertainment of its population, including theatres, cinemas and public houses. In 1908 the Hippodrome Theatre on Leigh Road {{was built on}} the site of Walker's silk mill of 1827, this subsequently became a cinema, first the Odeon, later the Classic. Another theatre, the Theatre Royal, was built on Lord Street which later became the Leigh Casino Club. The Palace Cinema was built in 1913 on Railway Road and the assembly rooms above the Conservative Club, were converted to a cinema known as the Sems in 1908. Brewery Lane is <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> that there was once a brewery in Bedford belonging to George Shaw & Co.|$|E
5|$|Shapinsay {{is one of}} the Orkney Islands off {{the north}} coast of {{mainland}} Scotland.
