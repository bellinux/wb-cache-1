60|$|For an {{hour the}} Russians held their {{advanced}} works, {{and then were}} forced to fall back; and the French, following up their advantage, crossed a ravine and occupied the village of Semianotsky, which had been partially destroyed on the previous day by the Russians, so that if captured it would afford no cover to the French. It was but {{for a short time}} that the latter held it. Coming up at the head of his grenadiers, Touchkoff drove them out, recrossed the ravine, and recaptured the <b>advance</b> <b>works</b> they had before so obstinately contested. In turn the French retook the three redoubts; but, again, a Russian division coming up wrested the position from them, and replanted their flag there. Napoleon, seeing that no impression could be made on the Russian left, now sent orders to the Viceroy to carry the great redoubt before Gorki. In spite of the difficulties presented by the broken ground, the three French divisions pressed forward with the greatest gallantry, and, heedless of the storm of grape poured upon them, stormed the redoubt. But its late defenders, reinforced by some battalions from Doctorow's corps, dashed forward to recover the position, and fell with such fury upon the French that the regiment that had entered the redoubt was all but annihilated, and the position regained, while at the same moment two regiments of Russian cavalry fell upon reinforcements pressing forward to aid the defenders, and threw them into disorder.|$|E

An £8m [...] "pre-start works agreement" [...] has now been announced between Transport Scotland and the preferred bidder, Connect Roads. Connect Roads will now begin the work of fencing, environment surveys and ground investigations ahead of the main works contract commencing later in the year. Other site clearing works and environmental works, such as the relocation of protected badgers, is continuing meantime. Final completion of construction is now anticipated {{in the second half of}} 2017, shaving around 6 months off the original construction timescale. The Craibstone interchange was announced to be completed in late 2016 along with the Balmedie to Tipperty section a few months later. Main sub-contracts for the construction phase of the works have now been published on the Public Contracts Scotland website, with most indicated to begin January 2015. Transport Scotland has also added a current activity page to their AWPR/B-T area, which details currently ongoing works on the project.|$|E

50|$|The second {{method used}} to advance (or retard) the {{ignition}} timing is called vacuum timing advance. This method {{is almost always}} used in addition to mechanical timing advance. It generally increases fuel economy and driveability, particularly at lean mixtures. It also increases engine life through more complete combustion, leaving less unburned fuel to wash away the cylinder wall lubrication (piston ring wear), and less lubricating oil dilution (bearings, camshaft life, etc.). Vacuum <b>advance</b> <b>works</b> by using a manifold vacuum source to advance the timing at low to mid engine load conditions by rotating the position sensor (contact points, hall effect or optical sensor, reluctor stator, etc.) mounting plate in the distributor {{with respect to the}} distributor shaft. Vacuum advance is diminished at wide open throttle (WOT), causing the timing advance to return to the base advance in addition to the mechanical advance.|$|E

40|$|The M 2 motorway-widening {{scheme in}} Kent, England was set within a constrained, {{environmentally}} sensitive corridor. Ecologists were involved {{from the earliest}} stages {{of the project and}} throughout the planning, development, and implementation phases they worked alongside the design engineers to develop pragmatic solutions to the potential impacts of the scheme. One of the most significant impacts was on the areas of ancient woodland that abut the existing motorway. Since the widening was on-line or adjacent to the existing motorway, the widening proposals sought to minimize the ancient woodland land-take, but some loss was inevitable. The scheme was discussed at length with the statutory consultees. One option considered was a contribution to offsite habitat creation (mitigation banking). Instead, a scheme for the creation of new woodland adjacent to the scheme was developed. However, rather than simply planting trees onto a bare site, an ambitious proposal to translocate the existing ancient woodland soil to the new site was implemented. From the outset, the ancient woodland topsoil was identified as a valuable resource, having developed in shaded conditions for hundreds of years and containing a considerable diversity of woodland seeds, bulbs, micro-organisms, and invertebrates. The majority of the woodlands affected by the scheme were commercial sweet chestnut coppice of little intrinsic nature conservation value, but all of the woodlands supported the protected hazel dormouse. Over a year before the contract to widen the M 2 was let, the ecological <b>advance</b> <b>works</b> began on site. The trees within all of the strips of woodland where the motorway widening would take place were coppiced during winter, using hand-held tools and without permitting vehicles onto the ancient woodland soil. This work was timed to coincide with the period when dormice would be hibernating on the ground. On waking from hibernation in spring, the dormice moved into the canopy of the remaining woodland, where their habitat had been enhanced by the provision of artificial nest sites and woodland-management techniques, including selective coppicing and replanting. The following autumn, the ancient woodland soil (with its seed-bank intact) was carefully excavated and re-spread on a specially prepared ‘receptor site. ’ One hundred mature coppiced hazel trees were transplanted from the area of the widening to the new site to provide food for dormice. Also, 60, 000 new trees of an appropriate diverse species mix and of local provenance were planted. Piles of decaying timber were also assembled to provide a habitat for fungi and dead wood invertebrates. The new woodland that has been created connects three existing woods, enhancing their nature conservation value and providing a linking function as a substantial ‘wildlife corridor. ’ There is also a public footpath and bridleway, suitably fenced throughout the length of the site so that the new woodland can be enjoyed by local people. The translocated ancient woodland soil will give the new woodland a valuable start in its development by providing many of the important components of a woodland ecosystem. The site is being monitored closely {{for at least the next}} 10 years, and each successfully transferred element of the habitat is being carefully logged and its progress to full establishment recorded. Five years on, the woodland is developing well. There is a distinct woodland ground flora, with carpets of bluebells in the spring, and woodland invertebrates are still present. The tiny fragment of retained woodland in the center of the site still holds a population of dormice. The translocated and new Hazel are beginning to fruit heavily so that a further eight hectares of habitat will soon be available to the population...|$|E
