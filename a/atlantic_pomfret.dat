5000|$|The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>pomfret</b> or Ray's bream (after naturalist, John Ray), Brama brama, is a pomfret of {{the family}} Bramidae, found in the Atlantic, Indian, and South Pacific Oceans, at depths down to 1,000 m. Its length is between 40 and 100 cm. In South Africa, where {{it is a common}} bycatch of the hake fishery, it is {{generally}} known and sold as [...] "angelfish", although it is not a true marine angelfish.|$|E
40|$|Hydroclimatic {{variability}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} factors that drives inter-annual changes in fish migration patterns. This study analyses the relationship between climate- oceanographic factors and migration of the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>pomfret</b> (Brama brama) in NE Atlantic waters. Geo-referenced catch data from logbooks of longliners operating in European Atlantic waters from 2002 to 2013 were linked to environmental indices at different temporal and spatial scales. Our results point to a strong influence of temperature at 200 m depth as the key factor along with the upwelling in the Galician (NW Iberian) waters. However, sea surface temperature (SST) indirectly affects the geographical display of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>pomfret</b> migration, and large migrations are observed in scenarios of high SSTs in the migratory area (c. above 14. 7 °C). Migrations are constrained during years when temperatures are below this threshold. A longer time-series of annual landings (1950 – 2013) supports this evidence and highlights the significant influence of temperature at 200 -m depth along with the landings of the previous year. Length frequency distributions suggest an increase in size between consecutive seasons supporting the hypothesis that migration is a feeding strategy and a return to tropical waters of origin for spawning. Our study shows that the temperature of intermediate waters is a key variable in determining the northward migration of the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>pomfret</b> whereas density-dependence and surface climatic conditions trigger secondary effects on the migration pattern of this species.

40|$|Natural {{mortality}} is a poorly known aspect of fisheries biology, despite its importance in stock assessments and population analysis. Of {{potential sources of}} mortality and morbidity in fishes, the effect of internal parasites is perhaps the least studied even though these organisms are known to inhibit nutrient uptake and stimulate an inflammatory response in fish. Parasite taxa of the pelagic elasmobranchs silky and night sharks and pelagic stingray (Carcharhinus falciformis, C. signatus and Pteroplatytrygon violacea), and the mesopelagic teleosts sailfin lancetfish, oilfish, snake mackerel, escolar and <b>Atlantic</b> <b>pomfret</b> (Alepisaurus ferox, Ruvettus pretiosus, Gempylus serpens, Lepidocybium flavobrunneum, and Brama brama) are described from the western North Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. Parasite taxa included cestodes, trematodes, acanthocephalans, and nematodes. Suggested protocol revisions to current accepted laboratory methods will enhance future parasite taxa descriptions from pelagic marine fishes. This work serves as the first parasite taxa and load descriptions for pelagic stingray, lancetfish, oilfish, snake mackerel, escolar and pomfret...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{mortality}} is a poorly known aspect of fisheries biology, despite its importance in stock assessments and population analysis. Of the many {{potential sources of}} mortality and morbidity in fishes, the effect of internal parasites is perhaps the least studied. Intestinal parasites may inhibit nutrient uptake as well as stimulate an inflammatory response in fish. Intestinal parasites of several tropical pelagic elasmobranchs, including silky and night sharks (Carcharhinus falciformis and C. signatus), the pelagic stingray (Pteroplatytrygon violacea), and mesopelagic fishes including sailfin lancetfish (Alepisaurus ferox), oilfish (Ruvettus pretiosus), snake mackerel (Gempylus serpens), escolar (Lepidocybium flavobrunneum), and <b>Atlantic</b> <b>pomfret</b> (Brama brama) are described from the South Atlantic Bight in the western North Atlantic. Parasites recovered include cestodes, trematodes, acanthocephalans and nematodes. Total gastrointestinal parasite loads were compared against the size (both length and weight) of the host, showing no correlation in pelagic elasmobranchs and a small correlation in mesopelagic teleosts. Sex and parasite loads were also compared for elasmobranchs showing a weak correlation. Capture seasons were also compared, and other results of this research showed that the parasites {{in this study are}} not host-species specific. The observed parasite classes and total helminth loads are the first described for these five mesopelagic fishes and will serve as a baseline for further studies. Future research is suggested to ascertain if commercially valuable, co-occurring, co-existing pelagic fishes may also be at risk for similar intestinal parasite fauna and burdens...|$|E
