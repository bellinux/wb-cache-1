CH£OPICKI, J. B. BARTUŒ, R. J. GRYGLEWSKI. Pol. J. Pharmacol., 2002, 54, 433 – 441. Recent {{evidence suggests that}} hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) is mediated by hypoxia-induced closure of voltage-gated potassium channels in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells. It is also claimed that various vasoconstrictor mediators such as thromboxane A (TXA 2 2), platelet activating factor (PAF), cysteinyl leukotrienes (cys-LTs) or endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) contribute to HPV. Their role, however, has not been unequivocally accepted. On the contrary, {{it is well known}} that endothelium-derived nitric oxide negatively modulates HPV. Since NO counteracts action of vasoconstrictor mediators, we tested the hypothesis that modulatory role of TXA 2, PAF, cys-LTs and ET- 1 in HPV would become apparent in absence of endogenous NO. For that purpose we <b>assessed</b> <b>contribution</b> of these mediators to HPV in the isolated blood-perfused rat lung pretreated with a nonselective NOS inhibitor, L-NAME. HPV, which was greatly augmented by L-NAME (300 �M) alone, was inhibited neither by a TXA synthase inhibi- 2 tor (Camonagrel, 300 �M), nor by a PAF receptor antagonist (WEB 2170, 100 �M), nor by an inhibitor of five-lipooxygenase-activating protein (MK 886, 10 �M), nor by a non-selective ET- 1 receptor antagonist (LU 302872, 30 �M). In summary, in isolated blood-perfused rat lung, TXA 2, PAF, cys-LTs and ET- 1 seem not to be involved in HPV, whereas we confirm the dominant role of endogenous NO in blunting HPV...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to get {{empirical}} data about the <b>assessed</b> <b>contribution</b> of an iso 9001 internal audit to fulfil the company goals and in this way improve its efficiency. The empirical study in the case of Mercator, plc. is based on the analytically proven hypothesis taken from a former research. The first hypothesis (H 1) assumes that internal audits contribute to the fulfilment of company goals and in this way contribute to company efficiency. The other hypothesis (H 2) suggests that internal audits have more positive than negative effects upon business performance of a company. The study concluded that the internal audit in Mercator had generally more positive than negative effects upon business performance of the company. Respondents also realized that the internal audit considerably contributed to the fulfilment of company goals and to better efficiency. The results of the empirical study in Mercator support both hypotheses used as the research starting-point. Therefore the case of Mercator supports the statement that an internal audit which is primarily a quality management tool according to iso 9001 requests could also contribute to better business performance and company efficiency. The empirical outcomes could help quality managers as a reference data for benchmarking of internal audits and their effects in various environments. Further empirical research including additional internal audit cases (from other environments) would be welcome. The results of these audits could support the development of a wider benchmark database and it could in addition give a stronger support to the hypotheses presented in this article...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Our aims were to {{describe}} activity and sedentary behaviours in urban Asian women, with dysglycaemia (diagnosed at recruitment), and without dysglycaemia {{and examine the}} relative contribution of these parameters to their glycaemic status. METHODS: 2800 urban women (30 - 45 years) were selected by random cluster sampling and screened for dysglycaemia for a final sample of 272 newly diagnosed, drug naive dysglycaemic and 345 normoglycaemic women. Physical activity and sedentary behaviours were assessed by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Demographic data, diet and anthropometry were recorded. Logistic regression analysis <b>assessed</b> <b>contribution</b> of all parameters to dysglycaemia and exposure attributable fractions were calculated. RESULTS: The mean energy expenditure on walking (2648. 5 ± 1023. 7 MET-min/week) and on moderate and vigorous physical activity (4342. 3 ± 1768. 1 MET-min/week) for normoglycemic women and dysglycaemic women (walking; 1046. 4 ± 728. 4 MET-min/week, moderate and vigorous physical activity; 1086. 7 ± 1184. 4 MET-min/week) was above the recommended amount of physical activity per week. 94. 3 % of women spent > 1000 MET-minutes/week on activity. Mean sitting and TV time for normoglycaemic and dysglycaemic women were 154. 3 ± 62. 8, 38. 4 ± 31. 9, 312. 6 ± 116. 7 and 140. 2 ± 56. 5 minutes per day respectively. Physical activity and sedentary behaviour contributed to dysglycaemia after adjustment for family history, diet, systolic blood pressure and Body Mass Index. Exposure attributable fractions for dysglycaemia were; lower physical activity: 78 %, higher waist circumference: 94 %, and TV viewing time: 85 %. CONCLUSIONS: Urban South Asian women {{are at risk of}} dysglycaemia at lower levels of sedentary behaviour and greater physical activity than western populations, indicating the need for re-visiting current physical activity guidelines for South Asians...|$|E
40|$|Background: Studies of {{socioeconomic}} disparities {{in patterns of}} cause of death have been limited to single countries, middle-aged people, men, or broad cause of death groups. We <b>assessed</b> <b>contribution</b> of specific causes of death to disparities in mortality between groups with different levels of education, in men and women, middle-aged and old, in eight western European populations. Methods: We analysed data from longitudinal mortality studies by cause of death, between Jan 1, 1990, and Dec 31, 1997. Data were included for more than 1 million deaths in 51 million person years of observation. Findings: Absolute educational inequalities in total mortality peaked at 2127 deaths per 100 000 person years in men, and at 1588 deaths per 100 000 person years in women aged 75 years and older. In this age-group, rate ratios were greater than 1. 00 for total mortality and all specific causes of death, apart form prostate cancer in men and lung cancer in women, showing increased mortality in low versus high eductational groups. In men, cardiovascular diseases accounted for 39 % {{of the difference between}} low and high eductational groups in total mortality, cancer for 24 %, other diseases for 32 %, and external causes for 5 %. Among women, contributions were 60 %, 11 %, 30 %, and 0 %, respectively. The contributions of cerebrovascular disease, other cardiovascular diseases, pneumonia, and COPD strongly increased by age, whereas those of cancer and external causes declined. Although relative inequalities in total mortality were closely similar in all populations, we noted striking differences in the contribution of specific causes to these inequalities. Interpretation: Research needs to be broadened to include older populations, other diseases, and populations from different parts of Europe. Effective interventions should be developed and implemented to reduce exposure to cardiovascular risk factors in low-educational groups. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|Three {{technology}} forecast {{reports from}} the Fraunhofer Institute and four reports on literature studies (sometimes called scanning reports) from the Swedish Defence Research Institute (FOI) have been reviewed by staff at the Military-Technology Division at the Swedish Defence University (SEDU). The task given by the Defence Material Administration FMV {{was to assess the}} military utility of the given technologies in a time frame to 2040, from a Swedish Armed Forces (SwAF) point of view. In the review we assess the military utility of a certain technology as a possible contribution to the operational capabilities of the SwAF, based on identified relevant scenarios. Since a new capability catalogue is under development at the SwAF Headquarters, this report will only present general assessments of the capability impact from the technologies under study. The technologies were grouped into four classes: potentially significant, moderate, negligible, or uncertain military utility. The following technology was assessed to have a potential for significant military utility;  Multi robot systems The following technologies were assessed to have a potential for moderate military utility;  Over-the-Horizon Radar  Space-based imaging radar The following technology was found to have negligible military utility.  Moving Target Defence The following technologies were assessed to have uncertain military utility;  Software-Defined Networking  Transient Materials- Programmed to Perish, but this technology should be monitored since it might reach high technical readiness level (TRL) by 2050 - 60 The method used in this technology forecast report was to assign each report to one reviewer in the working group. First, a summary of each forecast report was made. The Fraunhofer assessment of TRL in the time period to 2035 was held to be correct. The technology was then put into one or more scenarios that were deemed to be suitable in order to assess the military utility as well as indicate possibilities and drawbacks of each technology. Based on a SWOT-analysis, the <b>assessed</b> <b>contribution</b> to the fundamental capabilities and to the factors DOTMPLFI (Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Personnel, Leadership, Facilities and Interoperability) were listed. Furthermore, the expected requirements on the SwAF R&D in order to facilitate the introduction of the technology are given. As a consequence of our continuing development of the evaluation process, we have for the first time used a model developed at the division of Military-Technology to assess the Military utility 1 of the technologies. Finally, conclusions and an overall rating regarding the potential military utility of each technology were presented. The chosen definition of military utility clearly affects the result of the study. The definition (the military utility of a certain technology is its contribution to the operational capabilities of the SwAF, within identified relevant scenarios) is the same as used in our Technology Forecasts since 2013. Our evaluation of the method used shows that there is a risk that the assessment is biased by the participating experts’ presumptions and experiences from their own field of research. Also, it should be stressed that the six technologies’ potential military utility was assessed within the specific presented scenarios, and their possible contribution to operational capabilities within those scenarios, not in general. When additional results have been found in the analysis this is mentioned. The last chapter of this report analyzes thinking and debate on war and warfare in three military great powers: USA, Russia and China. Therefore, this chapter has a different structure. Aspects of military technology are discussed {{at the end of the}} chapter, but no assessment of the military utility is made. The greatest value of the method used is its simplicity, cost effectiveness and that it promotes learning within the working group. The composition of the working group and the methodology used is believed to provide a broad and balanced coverage of the technologies under study. This report is to been seen as an executive summary of the Fraunhofer reports and the reports on literature studies from FOI. The intention is to help the SwAF Headquarters to evaluate the military utility of emerging technologies within identified relevant scenarios. Overall, the quality of the Fraunhofer reports is considered to be balanced and of a high level of critical analysis regarding technology development. These reports are in line with our task to evaluate the military utility of the emerging technologies. The FOI reports are considered to be high quality.

40|$|Five {{technology}} forecast {{reports from}} the Fraunhofer Institute have been reviewed by staff at the Department of Military-Technology at the Swedish Defence University. The task given by the Swedish Defence Material Administration (FMV) {{was to assess the}} military utility of the given technologies in a time frame to 2040 from a Swedish Armed Forces’ (SwAF) perspective. We assess the military utility of a certain technology based on its contribution to the operational capabilities of the SwAF, according to identified relevant scenarios. It {{should be noted that the}} military utility of the technology in this report is assessed solely in the presented scenario, not for the technology in any other scenarios. Since a new capability catalogue is under development at the SwAF Headquarters, we will only present general assessments of the capability impact from the technologies under study. After the seminars, the technologies were grouped into three classes; technologies with potentially significant, uncertain or negligible military utility. The classification uncertain is given for technologies that are difficult to put into the two other classes, and not because a high technology readiness level (TRL) will not be reached by 2040. The following technologies were assessed to have a potential for significant military utility; 3 D Printers Our overall assessment is that 3 D printing has significant potential for military utility, possibly disruptive. Logistic concepts for both national and expeditionary missions will be affected in the 2040 time frame. The technology development will be driven by civilian industry, but a SwAF in-depth study is recommended as it could help form potential logistic concepts and determine what methods and systems are suitable for military adoption and what kind of application-specific issues have to be addressed in order to take full advantage of the new technology. Deep Learning The military utility for deep learning is assessed to be significant, primarily regarding SIGINT and IMINT, which is where the greatest utility can be seen. The driving force as regards research in the field is the private sector. We therefore recommend that the SwAF follow the research conducted and focus studies on how and where deep learning can be implemented within the organization. Nanothermites We suggest that a deeper study into the feasibility of nanothermite munitions and their possible military utility is carried out, since they are assessed to have a potential for significant military utility. Some of the remaining challenges include resolving risks and uncertainties pertaining to health, legality and material development. We also suggest that nanothermites should be incorporated as a future area of interest within the SwAF R&D projects. Unmanned Surface Vessels USV could be used for many tasks that are dull, difficult and dangerous. If employed to search for submarines they are expected to lower the cost of personnel, enhance the readiness level and increase the probability of finding hostile submarines. Therefore, we assess that USV have potential for significant military utility. The effectiveness of USV for the SwAF will depend greatly on how the platforms are incorporated into the organization. Research on how to use the USV tactically will likely be imperative if the technology is to reach its full potential. We recommended that the SwAF should follow the development and pursue research on USV before acquiring own platforms. Structural Health Monitoring Structural health monitoring is a key part when utilizing kinodynamic motion planning in automated and autonomous systems; therefore it will affect the capability of all systems that rely on kinodynamic motion planning. This technology has the capacity to enhance the capabilities of automatic and autonomous systems. Therefore, our assessment is that structural health monitoring has significant potential for military utility No technology was assessed to have uncertain or negligible military utility. The result of our technology forecast is different from previous years since all the technologies were assessed to have significant potential for military utility. The reason for this is assumed to be because these technologies have been selected by a board of experts from the SwAF and the Defence Materiel Administration, (FMV), as well as from a number of interesting, potentially disruptive technologies proposed by the Fraunhofer Institute. Furthermore, the Fraunhofer Institute estimates that all technologies in this report will reach high TRL levels, mostly 8 and 9 by 2035. The method used in this technology forecast report was to assign each Fraunhofer report to one reviewer in the working group. First, a summary of each forecast report was made. The Fraunhofer assessment of technical readiness level (TRL) in the time period to 2035 was held to be correct. The technology was then put into one scenario that was assumed to be suitable in order to assess the military utility as well as indicate possibilities and drawbacks of the technology. Based on a SWOT analysis, an assessment of the capability impact was made. An improvement this year is that the footprint table has been adjusted to the one used by NORDEFCO, presenting the <b>assessed</b> <b>contribution</b> to the factors DOTMPLFI (Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Personnel, Leadership, Facilities and Interoperability). Furthermore, the demands that are expected to be put on the SwAF R&D in order to facilitate the introduction of the technology were indicated. Finally, conclusions regarding the potential military utility of each technology were drawn. We believe that this information could be used as decision support for future R&D investments. The chosen definition of military utility clearly affects the result of the study. The definition of the military utility of a certain technology is its contribution to the operational capabilities of the SwAF within identified relevant scenarios and is the same as used in the Technology Forecast of 2013 and 2014. This definition is believed to be good enough for this report but could be further elaborated in the future. An article that in-depth presents our concept of military utility has recently been published. 1 Our evaluation of the method used shows that there is a risk that the assessment is biased because of the participating experts’ presumptions and experiences from their own field of research. The scenarios that were chosen do not cover all aspects of the technologies and their possible contribution to operational capabilities. It should be stressed that we have assessed potential military utility of the five technologies within the specific presented scenarios, not the technology itself. Any additional results found in the analysis are mentioned. The greatest value of the method used is its simplicity, cost effectiveness and not least the tradeoff that it promotes learning within the working group. The composition of the working group and the methodology used are believed to provide for a broad and balanced coverage of the technologies under study. This report provides executive summaries of the Fraunhofer reports and the intention is to help the SwAF Headquarters evaluate the military utility of emerging technologies within identified relevant scenarios. Overall, the quality of the Fraunhofer reports is considered to be balanced and of a high level of critical analysis regarding technology development. However, the report on Unmanned Surface Vessels was found to have a somewhat lower quality than the other reports, for instance, some parts of the text are copied and pasted from last year’s report on UCAV and some parts of the assessments are missing, e. g. in the TRL evaluation.
