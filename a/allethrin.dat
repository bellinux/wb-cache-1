40|$|Protecting children's {{environmental}} health {{is a significant}} public health challenge given children's unique exposure pathways and special vulnerabilities to environmental contaminants compared to adults. This dissertation focused on topics surrounding children's {{environmental health}} research {{with an emphasis on}} exposure assessment and application in an epidemiologic investigation. The environmental contaminants that this work focused on included pesticides and polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants. Chapter 1 provides a general introduction to children's environmental health and highlights the background and significance and specific aims for each study/chapter. 	Chapter 2 focuses on children's residential exposures via house dust to pesticides and PBDEs in low-income homes. House dust was used to assess indoor residential exposures to these environmental contaminants given that for young children this medium serves as a reservoir for contaminants tracked-in or used indoors and a source of non-dietary ingestion. Additionally, the contaminants of interest have been routinely measured in this medium. In this study, concentrations for 24 pesticides, one pesticide synergist, and three PBDE congeners (major constituents of the pentaBDE flame retardant commercial mixture commonly used on furniture) were measured in house dust samples from farmworker and urban homes in California. Pesticides frequently detected in most homes included: organophosphates (chlorpyrifos and diazinon) which were voluntarily phased-out for residential uses prior to this study by the urging of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); pyrethroids such as permethrins, <b>allethrins,</b> cypermethrins; and the synergist piperonyl butoxide. Interestingly, chlorthal-dimethyl was detected solely in farmworker homes, suggesting contamination due to regional agricultural use. All three PBDE congeners were detected in all homes and maximum concentrations for each of these congeners are the highest reported to date in house dust (BDE- 47 : 125 632 ng/g, BDE- 99 : 218 768 ng/g, BDE- 100 : 41 149 ng/g). Possible explanations for the high PBDE concentrations observed include California's stringent flammability standards and the presence of poorly constructed or deteriorating furniture treated with PBDEs as previously hypothesized by other researchers. Additionally, diazinon and chlorpyrifos concentrations in Salinas farmworker homes were lower than concentrations reported in samples from Salinas farmworker homes studied between 2000 - 2002, suggesting a temporal reduction after the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency's voluntary residential phase-out. Lastly, for some resident children, estimated non-dietary PBDE but not pesticide intake exceeded U. S. EPA recommended chronic reference doses (RfDs). In chapter 3 the presence in the environment of dialkylphosphates (DAPs), non-specific urinary OP pesticide metabolites, and their relation to children's urinary DAP metabolites was investigated. Although DAPs were found to be present in the environment, as assessed in house dust, this medium may not play a significant contribution to the DAPs observed in children's urine. The non-dietary ingestion exposure route for environmental DAPs was estimated to be < 5 % of the dose calculated from DAP levels in children's urine. The distribution of concentrations of diethyl and dimethyl DAPs in dust differed from those observed in children's urine, a finding suggesting that DAPs behave differently in the environment and in the body. However, if humans excrete DAPs unchanged then it is possible for urinary DAPs to reflect exposure to both OP pesticides and DAPs present in one's environment and/or food. Results from this study indicate other sources and pathways, such as DAPs in food, may impact urinary DAP levels more significantly than DAPs in dust. More research is needed on the pharmacokinetics and toxicodynamics of preformed DAPs and other specific OP metabolites {{to determine the extent of}} their contribution to urinary biomarkers in humans. In chapter 4 the effects of early life exposures to OP pesticides, as assessed by urinary DAP metabolites, on children's autonomic dysregulation (concomitant sympathetic activation and parasympathetic withdrawal) were assessed at several time points (i. e., when children were 6 months and 1, 3 Â½ and 5 years of age). This is the first study to use ANS response measures as outcomes to investigate the association between OP pesticide exposures in children and ANS regulation. The study population was part of the Center for Children's Environmental Health Research longitudinal birth cohort study (CHAMACOS). Children in this cohort live in the Salinas Valley, an agricultural region in California with intense OP pesticide use and were predominantly from Mexico or Mexican-American. Children's autonomic nervous system (ANS) function was assessed using resting and reactivity measures of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), pre-ejection period (PEP), and heart rate (HR), while OP pesticide exposures were assessed in utero and postnatally by using urinary DAPs. Although the results suggest that OP pesticides at the exposure levels observed are not associated with children's ANS dysregulation, the study focused on a relatively demographically and ethnically homogeneous study population; thus, the results may not be generalizable to other populations. Future investigations in this population will involve evaluating what factors predict ANS regulation and whether ANS resting and reactivity measures of HR, RSA, and PEP are related to later physical and mental problems as observed in prior studies. Finally, chapter 5 highlights the major findings, public health implications and future directions for each chapter/study...|$|R

50|$|The {{earliest}} pyrethoids {{are related}} to pyrethrin I and II by changing the alcohol group of the ester of chrysanthemic acid. This relatively modest change can lead to substantially altered activities. For example, the 5-benzyl-3-furanyl ester called resmethrin is only weakly toxic to mammals (LD50 (rat, oral) = 2,000 mg/kg) but is 20-50 times more effective than natural pyrethrum and is also readily biodegraded. Other commercially important esters include tetramethrin, <b>allethrin,</b> phenothrin, barthrin, dimethrin, and bioresmethrin. Another family of pyrethroids have altered acid fragment together with altered alcohol components. These require more elaborate organic synthesis. Members of this extensive class include the dichlorovinyl and dibromovinyl derivatives. Still others are tefluthrin, fenpropathrin, and bioethanomethrin.|$|E

40|$|International audiencePyrethroids are widely-used {{chemical}} insecticides, {{to which}} humans are commonly exposed, and known to alter functional expression of drug metabolizing enzymes. Limited data have additionally suggested that drug transporters, that constitute key-actors {{of the drug}} detoxification system, may also be targeted by pyrethroids. The present study was therefore designed to analyze the potential regulatory effects of these pesticides towards activities of main ATP-binding cassette (ABC) and solute carrier (SLC) drug transporters, using transporter-overexpressing cells. The pyrethroids <b>allethrin</b> and tetramethrin were found to inhibit various ABC and SLC drug transporters, including multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) 2, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporter polypeptide (OATP) 1 B 1, organic anion transporter (OAT) 3, multidrug and toxin extrusion transporter (MATE) 1, organic cation transporter (OCT) 1 and OCT 2, with IC 50 values however ranging from 2. 6 muM (OCT 1 inhibition by <b>allethrin)</b> to 77. 6 muM (OAT 3 inhibition by tetramethrin) and thus much higher than pyrethroid concentrations (in the nM range) reached in environmentally pyrethroid-exposed humans. By contrast, <b>allethrin</b> and tetramethrin cis-stimulated OATP 2 B 1 activity and failed to alter activities of OATP 1 B 3, OAT 1 and MATE 2 -K, whereas P-glycoprotein activity was additionally moderately inhibited. Twelve other pyrethoids used at 100 muM did not block activities of the various investigated transporters, or only moderately inhibited some of them (inhibition by less than 50 %). In silico analysis of structure-activity relationships next revealed that molecular parameters, including molecular weight and lipophilicity, are associated with transporter inhibition by allethrin/tetramethrin and successfully predicted transporter inhibition by the pyrethroids imiprothrin and prallethrin. Taken together, these data fully demonstrated that two pyrethoids, i. e., <b>allethrin</b> and tetramethrin, can act as regulators of the activity of various ABC and SLC drug transporters, but only when used at high and non-relevant concentrations, making unlikely any contribution of these transporter activity alterations to pyrethroid toxicity in environmentally exposed humans...|$|E

Results indicated that Ae. aegypti was more susceptible than C. Y. quinquefasciatus. The blank coil caused neither significant knockdown nor mortality of mosquitoes, while coils containing either d-allethrin or d-trans <b>allethrin</b> provided adequate knockdown of mosquitoes, but with low mortalities for both Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes below 10 days of age. The susceptibility of mosquitoes increased with age as indicated by a decrease in KT 50 and increase in mortality of female mosquitoes tested for both species. This study also indicated that blood-engorged mosquitoes were more difficult to be knocked down, but easier to kill than non blood-engorged mosquitoes. However, susceptibility of mosquitoes to coils was not affected by oviposition.

Pyrethroids, derived from compounds found only in the Asteraceae, are particularly toxic to insects and have been successfully used as pesticides including on flowering crops that are visited by pollinators. Pyrethrins, from which they were derived, occur naturally in the nectar of some flowering plant species. We know relatively little about how such compounds [...] i. e., compounds that target sodium channels [...] influence pollinators at low or sub-lethal doses. Here, we exposed individual adult forager honeybees to several compounds that bind to sodium channels to identify whether these compounds affect motor function. Using an assay previously developed to identify the effect of drugs and toxins on individual bees, we investigated how acute exposure to 10 ng doses (1 ppm) of the pyrethroid insecticides (cyfluthrin, tau-fluvalinate, <b>allethrin</b> and permethrin) and the nectar toxins (aconitine and grayanotoxin I) affected honeybee locomotion, grooming and wing fanning behaviour. Bees exposed to these compounds spent more time upside down and fanning their wings. They also had longer bouts of standing still.

40|$|A new {{rapid and}} {{sensitive}} analytical method using negative ion chemical ionization-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in selective ion monitoring mode {{has been developed}} for the determination of residues of different synthetic pyrethroid insecticides, <b>allethrin,</b> bifenthrin, cypermethrin, cyphonothrin, cyfluthrin, ~. -cyhalothrin, deltamethrin, fenvalerate, fenpropathrin, permethrin, prallethrin, and trans-fluthrin, in whole blood. The residues of pyrethrold molecules were extracted from the whole blood using a hexane and acetone (8 : 2, v/v) solvent mixture without separating the serum. The method was found sensitive to detect the residues of pyrethroids up to the level 0. 2 pg/mL. Experiments conducted with the whole blood samples at the fortification level 1 - 100 pg/mL showed 91 - 103 % recovery, whereas blood serum samples collected after the fortification of pyretbroids in whole blood showed 36 - 54 % recovery. Recovery experiments conducted by direct fortification of pyrethroids in blood serum samples showed 96 - 108 %. The applications of the analytical method was tested by analyzing 73 human blood samples collected from the population exposed continuously to different pyrethroid-based formulations. None of the blood samples showed residues of pyrethroids. The results were also confirmed by the detection of the appropriate amounts {{in a number of}} these samples, which had subsequently been spiked with known quantity of pyrethroids...|$|E
40|$|Na {{channels}} of frog muscle fibers treated with 100 microM veratridine became transiently modified after a train of repetitive depolarizations. They {{open and close}} reversibly with a gating process whose midpoint lies 93 mV more negative than the midpoint of normal activation gating and whose time course shows no appreciable delay in the opening or closing kinetics but still requires more than two kinetic states. Like normal activation, the voltage dependence of the modified gating can be shifted by changing the bathing Ca 2 + concentration. The instantaneous current-voltage relation of veratridine-modified channels is curved at potentials negative to - 90 mV, as if external Ca ions produced a voltage-dependent block but also permeated. Modified channels probably carry less current than normal ones. When the concentration of veratridine is varied between 5 and 100 microM, the initial rate of modification during a pulse train is directly proportional to the concentration, while the rate of recovery from modification after the train is unaffected. These are the properties expected if drug binding and modification of channels can be equated. Hyperpolarizations that close modified channels slow unbinding. <b>Allethrin</b> and DDT also modify channels. They bind and unbind far faster than veratridine does, and their binding requires open channels...|$|E
40|$|Background & objectives: Resistance amongst {{cockroaches}} {{has been}} reported to most of the spray insecticides apart from the problem of food contamination and inconvenience. Gel baits which can be selectively applied have been found effective in control of cockroaches in laboratory studies but very few field studies are available. This trial was planned to evaluate the efficacy of fipronil (0. 01 %) and imidacloprid (2. 15 %) gels over synthetic pyrethroid (0. 02 % deltamethrin + 0. 13 % <b>allethrin)</b> and propoxur (2 %) aerosols in control of cockroaches in the field. Methods: Survey was done to find out pre-treatment density in catering establishments and houses by visual count and sticky trap methods. A total of 10 catering establishments and 10 houses having high cockroach infestation were selected by sampling (two catering establishments and houses for each insecticidal treatment and two for control). Propoxur and synthetic pyrethroid aerosols were used for spraying the infested sites once only. Single application of fipronil and imidacloprid gels was used as crack and crevice treatment. Visual count method gave better indications of cockroach infestation as compared to sticky trap method, hence, the same was followed for post-treatment evaluation every week up to 12 weeks...|$|E
40|$|Estrogens, whether {{natural or}} synthetic, clearl inluence {{reproductive}} development, senescence, and carcinogenesis. Pyrethroid insecticides {{are now the}} most widely used agents for indoor pest control, providing potential for human exposure. Using the MCF- 7 human breast carcinoma cel line, we stdied the estrogenic potential of several sthetic pyrethroid mpounds in vitro usig pS 2 mRNA levels as the end point. We tested sumitin, tfenvalerate trans alletbrin, and permethrin. Nanomolar concentrations of either sumithin or fenvalerate were sufficient to increase pS 2 expression slighdy above basal levels. At micromolar concentmtions, these two pyrethroid compounds induced pS 2 expression to levels comparable to those elicited by 10 nM 17 f. estradiol (fivefold). The estrogenic activity of sumithrin was abolished with co-treatment with an antiestrogen (ICI 164, 384), whereas estrogenic activity of fenvalerate was not si y diminished with antiestrogen co-treatment. In addition, both sumithini and fenvalerate were:able to induce ei proliferation of MCF- 7 cells in a se-response fashion. Neither perm in nor d-trans <b>allethrin</b> affected pS 2 expression. Perme had a noticeable effect on cel proliferation at 100 pM, whereas d-trans allethin slightdy induced MCF- 7 cell prolieration at 10 pM, but was toxic at higher concentrtions. Overall, our studies imply that each pyrethroid compound is unique in its abilit...|$|E
