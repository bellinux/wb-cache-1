50|$|Following the Panic of 1893, {{the school}} {{suffered}} {{a series of}} financial setbacks. The panic led to decreased enrollment and a severe drop off in the sales of the homesites.

For a unique sample of 129 Belgian companies listed in the period 1905 - 1909, we find that universal bank affiliation had a positive impact on the market-to-book ratio and return-on-assets. The effect on performance was positively related to the degree of bank involvement. Universal banks significantly reduced the volatility of return-on-assets. Stock return performance, measured by the Sharpe ratio, was also significantly better for <b>affiliated</b> <b>corporations.</b> ...|$|R
50|$|This {{deduction}} {{is designed}} to reduce the consequences of triple taxation.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the change in}} tax preferences induced by the recent German corporate tax reform. The reform eliminates the imputation system and shifts the system towards a classical corporate tax system. However, financial preferences of corporations are largely unaffected if evaluated {{from the perspective of}} shareholders subject to the top marginal tax rate. A similar statement holds for the incentives to carry out share repurchases that in Germany have been allowed only recently. This paper argues that the much-discussed elimination of capital gains taxation for corporations abolishes a tax preference for new equity finance of <b>affiliated</b> <b>corporations.</b> Steuerreform, Finanzierungspräferenzen, steuerliche Veräußerungsgewinne, Aktienrückkauf...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} universal bank relations on the performance {{and the risk of}} listed companies in Belgium in the period 1905 - 1909. Our results are consistent with the view that universal banks are efficient institutions which overcome problems of asymmetric association inevitably associated with external finance. We find that universal bank affiliation was positively linked with market-to-book ratio and return-on-assets. Performance was also positively related to the degree of bank involvement. Universal bank relations were significant and negatively correlated with volatility of return-on-assets.

50|$|By the mid-1970s, Stanley Rader, an {{attorney}} and church accountant {{who had been a}} personal assistant to Herbert W. Armstrong since 1958, appeared to be stepping into the number two position of administration previously thought to be Garner Ted's domain. Relations between the two became strained and a power struggle ensued. One conflict was that Rader had set up privately owned, <b>affiliated</b> <b>corporations</b> that were doing business with the church. Garner Ted, and others in the organization, were skeptical of Rader's legal and financial dealings and suspected a bid to control the church's multimillion-dollar business. One objection to Rader's role was that, being Jewish, he had never been a baptized member of the church or a practicing Christian. That obstacle was removed in 1975 when Rader was baptized by the elder Armstrong.|$|R
