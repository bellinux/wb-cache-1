25|$|In addition, it {{has been}} argued that Titania in William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night’s Dream (1600) is an {{inversion}} of Circe.

She is made to love <b>an</b> <b>ass</b> after, rather than before, he is transformed into his true animal likeness.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{introduction}} of gas generally in the parish there was a limited supply from the Mill to separate houses. The Church was first lit with gas in 1857. The Public Lighting Act was adopted at a Vestry Meeting on 13 November 1862. The opposition to lamps in the streets was strong, and the effigy of an active promoter of it was carried on <b>an</b> <b>ass</b> round the village and hung on a lamp-post, and but for police interference would have been burned. In 1861 gas was supplied from Nottingham by the Nottingham Gas Light and Coke Company, and for street lamps in 1872. Beeston {{was connected to the}} mains water supply in 1876.|$|E
25|$|Priapus joined Pan and the satyrs as {{a spirit}} of {{fertility}} and growth, though he was perennially frustrated by his impotence. In a ribald anecdote told by Ovid, he attempted to rape the goddess Hestia but was thwarted by <b>an</b> <b>ass,</b> whose braying caused him to lose his erection at the critical moment and woke Hestia. The episode gave him a lasting hatred of asses {{and a willingness to}} see them destroyed in his honour. The emblem of his lustful nature was his permanent erection and his large penis. Another myth states that he pursued the nymph Lotis until the gods took pity on her and turned her into a lotus plant.|$|E

25|$|David Bevington {{argues that}} the play {{represents}} {{the dark side of}} love. He writes that the fairies make light of love by mistaking the lovers and by applying a love potion to Titania's eyes, forcing her {{to fall in love with}} <b>an</b> <b>ass.</b> In the forest, both couples are beset by problems. Hermia and Lysander are both met by Puck, who provides some comic relief in the play by confounding the four lovers in the forest. However, the play also alludes to serious themes. At the end of the play, Hippolyta and Theseus, happily married, watch the play about the unfortunate lovers, Pyramus and Thisbe, and are able to enjoy and laugh at it. Helena and Demetrius are both oblivious to the dark side of their love, totally unaware of what may have come of the events in the forest.|$|E
25|$|The carnyx's most {{prominent}} {{feature is the}} bell, which was constructed as an animal head, either {{as one of a}} serpent, a fish, a bird, a wolf, a horse, <b>an</b> <b>ass</b> or a wild boar. The earliest depiction shows the head of a dragon and was found on Aetolian victory coins from the 3rd century BC, which commemorate the expulsion of the Gallic warriors, who had marauded the Delphi sanctum. Behn (1912) interpreted the many bell types as distinguishing features of the various Celtic clans and chiefdoms. Others have suggested a mythological component, which is the most logical explanation, since the Deskford Carnyx in Scotland was a sacrificial offering, of which the possibly dismantled head could have been the key element. Based on this independent development of the bell an attempt was made to derive the Etruscan lituus from the carnyx, but without success.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a dispute}} among {{biologists}} {{as to how}} to properly classify the various species of zebra. It is thought that the plains zebra and mountain zebra belong to the subgenus Hippotigris and that Grévy's zebra is the sole species of subgenus Dolichohippus. This is on account of Grévy's zebra resembling <b>an</b> <b>ass</b> (subgenus Asinus), while the plains zebra and mountain zebra are more horse-like. All three animals belong to the genus Equus along with other living equids. However, recent phylogenetic evidence finds that plains zebras are more closely related to Grévy's zebras than mountain zebras. In areas where plains zebras are sympatric with Grévy's zebras, it is not unusual to find them in the same herds and fertile hybrids occur. In captivity, plains zebras have been crossed with mountain zebras. The hybrid foals lacked a dewlap and resembled the plains zebra apart from their larger ears and their hindquarters pattern.|$|E

25|$|The {{production}} emphasized, {{to a level}} {{never before}} seen, the supposed sexual undercurrents {{of the story of}} Titania's infatuation with Bottom after he turns into <b>an</b> <b>ass.</b> Brook was influenced by Jan Kott's study of the play in Shakespeare Our Contemporary, in which Kott notes the phallic properties of the donkey, and argues that Oberon deliberately degrades Titania by exposing her to this monstrous sexuality. In Brook's staging, Bottom entered Titania's bower carried by the fairies, one of whom thrust his upraised arm between Bottom's legs to represent a phallus. In a jab at more traditional stagings, the sequence was accompanied by Mendelssohn's Wedding March, a piece of music originally written to be played as an intermezzo between Acts IV and V, but often used in more genteel productions for the final marriage scene of the play. Despite the disturbing undercurrents of this view of sexuality, many audience members found the play witty and affectionate in its treatment of sex, in tune with the spirit of 1960s permissiveness.|$|E
