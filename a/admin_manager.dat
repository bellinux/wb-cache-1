40|$|This {{paper is}} not {{a case study of}} a {{particular}} administrative system. Our aim is to share the experience and knowledge gained during deployment and running of IS MU. We also stress the consequences it has had on the university as an organization. Its two main principles are as follows: Every student and staff member authorized as an IS MU user can participate in en-hancing the system and contribute to analysis of new applications. The system is to provide something interesting or useful for everyone. The access to the system must be transparent, i. e. all applications have web interface. Apart from around 15 thou-sand students (who use the system at least occasionally), IS MU has to serve several thousands of staff members (access the system on a regular basis) as well as people from the registrar departments and management (50 - 100 people, massive usage). IS MU operates from March 1999. In December 2000, the number of accesses reached 20 millions. During the last semester (Autumn 2000), university could fully exploit the features of IS MU. The number of accesses was over 180 thousand per day. Everybody is responsible for keeping their data up-to-date. Everyone has access to all available public information (IS MU obviously respects the Data Protection Act). The system is there for everyone, not merely for a few <b>admin</b> people or <b>managers.</b> We consider both principles to be very important. We believe that they were one of the forces behind recent changes and setting of new trends for the university. IS MU must be a living system, an everyday tool, to have the potential to change traditional university. The system is being implemented step by step. From the rst set of applications (Catalogue of Course Offerings), it increased its scope to approximately 160 applications. The applica-tions comprise tools for "Lecturer " (20 applications), "Student " (10), "Catalogue of Course Offerings " (40), "Credit Control " (40), "Publications " (10), various tools for presenting in-formation and communication applications (20).
