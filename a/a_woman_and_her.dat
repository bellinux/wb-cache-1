Near Santiago de Cuba, 25houses were swept away after the Bayamo River overflowed. In the same area, <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> four sons drowned due to the swollen river.

5|$|The town {{suffered}} {{very little}} from the bombing {{runs in the}} Second World War that did damage to many English locations. The worst case in Shrewsbury was in 1940, <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> two grandchildren were killed when a cottage was destroyed on Ellesmere Road, the only local air raid deaths. Therefore, many of its ancient buildings remain intact and there was little redevelopment in the 1960s and 1970s, which arguably destroyed the character of many historic towns in the UK. However, some historic buildings were demolished {{to make way for}} the brutalist architectural style of the 1960s, though the town was saved from a new 'inner ring road' due to its challenging geography. Two notable examples of 1960s/70s construction in Shrewsbury were demolished in the 2000s — the Telecom Tower on Smithfield Road and the multi-storey car park at St Austin's Friars.|$|E

Originally, each case would have to be approved by a local eugenics council, but this was removed from the law in 1952, making the decision a private one between <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> physician.|$|E

25|$|The Bear Valley raid was {{an armed}} {{conflict}} {{that occurred in}} 1886 during Geronimo's War. In late April, a band of Chiricahua Apaches attacked settlements in Santa Cruz County, Arizona {{over the course of}} two days. The Apaches raided four cattle ranches in or around Bear Valley, leaving four settlers dead, including <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> baby. They also captured a young girl, who was found dead several days after the event, and stole or destroyed a large amount of private property. When the United States Army learned of the attack, an expedition was launched to pursue the hostiles. In May, two small skirmishes were fought just across the international border in Sonora, Mexico but both times the Apaches were able to escape capture.|$|E

25|$|The Blackwater guards' {{account of}} the {{incident}} differed from that set forth in an Iraqi government account.

According to this account, the security team fired warning shots and then lethal fire at the Kia. They then set off stun grenades to clear the scene. Iraqi police and Iraqi Army soldiers, mistaking the stun grenades for fragmentation grenades, opened fire at the Blackwater men, to which they responded.|$|E
25|$|The {{family moved}} to Plattsburgh, New York, in 1852. In 1856 {{after the death of}} her mother, she {{continued}} her education in a Montreal convent-school, run by the Dames du Sacré-Coeur where her father had obtained the position of Music Master. This afforded her a better education than she might otherwise receive, and additional musical instruction. On 24 August 1860 she and Adelina Patti were soloists in the world premiere of Charles Wugk Sabatier's Cantata in Montreal which was performed in honour of the visit of the Prince of Wales. However, she was ultimately unable to finance a musical education in Quebec, where singing and acting were considered unsavoury careers for <b>a</b> <b>woman,</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> {{family moved to}} Albany, New York in 1865. There she became a popular singer, an organist and teacher of singing and saved enough money to continue her studies.|$|E
25|$|A {{community}} of sealers and others existed on Kangaroo Island from 1802 {{to the time}} of South Australia's colonisation in 1836. The sealers were rough men and several kidnapped Aboriginal women from Tasmania and mainland South Australia. The women were kept prisoner as wives and virtual slaves. At least two contemporary accounts report of (Taplin 1867, Bull 1884) reputed crossings of Backstairs Passage from Kangaroo Island to the mainland by kidnapped women seeking to escape from their captors. 'A fine specimen of her race' was pointed out to J.W. Bull as having swum the passage in 1835, and <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> baby were found dead on the beach after a presumed crossing in 1871. In 1803 sealers from the American brig Union built the schooner Independence, the first ship constructed in South Australia, at what is now American River.|$|E
