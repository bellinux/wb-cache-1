5|$|The {{earliest}} date that appears on Ruisdael's paintings and etchings is 1646. Two years after this date he {{was admitted to}} membership of the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke. By this time landscape paintings were <b>as</b> <b>popular</b> as history paintings in Dutch households, though {{at the time of}} Ruisdael's birth, history paintings appeared far more frequently. This growth in popularity of landscapes continued throughout Ruisdael's career.|$|E
5|$|Though Kikai {{started to}} {{photograph}} in Asakusa {{simply because it}} was near where he then lived, he has continued {{because of the nature}} of the place and its visitors. Once a bustling and fashionable area, Asakusa long ago lost this status. If it were <b>as</b> <b>popular</b> and crowded as it was before the war, Kikai says, he would go somewhere else.|$|E

5|$|United States shortwave {{broadcasters}} began transmitting popular radio {{programs in}} an attempt to attract foreign audiences.

5|$|Although {{association}} {{football was}} not <b>as</b> <b>popular</b> as rugby in the Rhondda {{in the early}} 20th century, after the 1920s several notable players had emerged from the area. Two {{of the most important}} players both came from the village of Ton Pentre; Jimmy Murphy was capped 15 times for Wales, and in 1958 managed both the Welsh national team and Manchester United. Roy Paul, also from Ton Pentre, led Manchester City to two successive FA Cup finals in 1955 and 1956 and gained 33 Welsh caps. Alan Curtis, who was best known for representing Swansea City and Cardiff City, came from the neighbouring village of Pentre, and in an 11-year international career won 35 caps for Wales scoring 6 goals.|$|E
5|$|By {{writing for}} a {{scientific}} as well <b>as</b> <b>popular</b> audience, Beebe {{did much to}} make science accessible to the general public. This was particularly significant {{in the area of}} conservation, of which {{he was one of the}} most important early advocates. With his many writings about the dangers of environmental destruction, Beebe helped to raise public awareness about this topic. However, Beebe's prolific writing for a popular audience had a downside, in that other scientists of his time were reluctant to hold him in high accord because they regarded him as a popularizer.|$|E

5|$|Carte {{started his}} career working for his father, Richard Carte, in the music {{publishing}} and musical instrument manufacturing business. As a young man, he conducted and composed music, but he soon turned to promoting the entertainment careers of others through his management agency. Carte believed that a school of wholesome, well-crafted, family-friendly, English comic opera could be <b>as</b> <b>popular</b> as the risqué French works dominating the London musical stage in the 1870s. To that end, he brought together the dramatist W. S. Gilbert and composer Arthur Sullivan and, together with his wife Helen Carte, he nurtured their collaboration {{on a series of}} thirteen Savoy operas. He founded the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company and built the state-of-the-art Savoy Theatre to host the Gilbert and Sullivan operas.|$|E
5|$|However, poison {{still exists}} as a murderous entity today, {{but it is}} not <b>as</b> <b>popular</b> form of {{conducting}} murder {{as it used to be}} in past times, probably because of the wider range of ways to kill people and other factors that must be taken into consideration. One of the more recent deaths by poisoning was that of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko in 2006 from lethal polonium-210 radiation poisoning.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, for {{the first}} time in many years, Robey {{appeared}} in a Christmas pantomime as a male when he was engaged to play the title role in Sinbad the Sailor; Fred Emney Sr played the dame role. Although the critics were surprised by the casting, it appealed to audiences, and the scenes featuring Robey and Emney together proved the most memorable. During the war the demand for light entertainment in the English provinces guaranteed Robey frequent bookings and a regular income. His appearances in Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle and Glasgow were <b>as</b> <b>popular</b> as his annual performances in Birmingham. His wife Ethel accompanied him on these tours and frequently starred alongside him.|$|E

5|$|In 1935, Heyer's thrillers began {{following}} {{a pair of}} detectives named Superintendent Hannasyde and Sergeant (later Inspector) Hemingway. The two were never <b>as</b> <b>popular</b> as other contemporary fictional detectives such as Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot and Dorothy L. Sayers's Lord Peter Wimsey. One of the books featuring Heyer's characters, Death in the Stocks, was dramatized in New York City in 1937 as Merely Murder. The play focused on the comedy rather than the mystery, and it closed after three nights.|$|E
5|$|In {{the regions}} of Saint-Lo and Cotentin, the Norman Cob was {{widespread}} in agricultural uses until 1950, and the population continued to increase {{in the first half}} of the 20th century, even through the occupation during World War II. Even the Percheron, which was internationally recognized as the Norman draft horse, was not <b>as</b> <b>popular</b> in the homeland of the Norman Cob breed. In 1945, Norman Cob stallions accounted for 40% of the conscripted horses, and in 1950 a studbook was created for the breed.|$|E
5|$|Jemima Puddle-Duck was popular, almost <b>as</b> <b>popular</b> as Peter Rabbit, {{and became}} the subject of {{ancillary}} merchandise. She is depicted in one of the four well known endpapers of the Potter books, and was featured on a Christmas card for the Invalid Children's Aid Association. She became the principal character in an unpublished painting book describing the livestock at Hill Top, and appeared in Peter Rabbit's Painting Book and Tom Kitten's Painting Book before being given her own painting book, Jemima Puddle-Duck's Painting Book in 1925, composed grudgingly in response to public demand for yet another book.|$|E

5|$|Lord Thomas Bulkeley {{bought the}} castle from the Crown in 1807 for £735, {{incorporating}} {{it into the}} park that surrounded his local residence, Baron Hill. By then the castles of North Wales had become attractive locations for visiting painters and travellers, who considered the ivy-clad ruins romantic. Although not <b>as</b> <b>popular</b> as other sites in the region, Beaumaris formed part of this trend and was visited by the future Queen Victoria in 1832 for an Eisteddfod festival and it was painted by J. M. W. Turner in 1835. Some of the castle's stones may have been reused in 1829 to build the nearby Beaumaris Gaol.|$|E
5|$|On 31 July 1879, {{the last}} day of their {{agreement}} with Carte, the directors of the Comedy Opera Company attempted to repossess the Pinafore set by force during a performance, causing a celebrated fracas. Carte's stagehands managed to ward off their backstage attackers and protect the scenery and props. The Comedy Opera Company opened a rival production of H.M.S. Pinafore in London, but it was not <b>as</b> <b>popular</b> as the D'Oyly Carte production and soon closed. Legal action over the ownership of the rights ended in victory for Carte, Gilbert and Sullivan. From 1 August 1879, the new company, later called the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, became the sole authorised producer of the works of Gilbert and Sullivan.|$|E
5|$|Reduced {{to a minor}} character, the new fictional Napoleon became not a world {{historical}} figure but {{an intimate}} one, fashioned by individuals' needs and consumed <b>as</b> <b>popular</b> entertainment. In their attempts to represent the emperor as a figure of national unity, proponents and detractors of the Third Republic used the legend {{as a vehicle for}} exploring anxieties about gender and fears about the processes of democratization that accompanied this new era of mass politics and culture.|$|E

5|$|Riley wrote {{gentle and}} romantic poems {{that were not}} in dialect. They {{generally}} consisted of sonnets and were strongly influenced by the works of John Greenleaf Whittier, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Alfred, Lord Tennyson. His standard English poetry was never <b>as</b> <b>popular</b> as his Hoosier dialect poems. Still less popular were the poems Riley authored in his later years; most were to commemorate important events of American history and to eulogize the dead.|$|E
5|$|Tchaikovsky wrote many {{works that}} are {{popular with the}} {{classical}} music public, including his Romeo and Juliet, the 1812 Overture, his three ballets (The Nutcracker, Swan Lake, The Sleeping Beauty) and Marche Slave. These, along with his First Piano Concerto and his Violin Concerto, the last three of his six numbered symphonies and his operas The Queen of Spades and Eugene Onegin, are among his most familiar works. Almost <b>as</b> <b>popular</b> are the Manfred Symphony, Francesca da Rimini, the Capriccio Italien and the Serenade for Strings.|$|E
5|$|The University of Wisconsin {{faculty and}} regents voted {{to end the}} Experimental College in May 1932. There was a {{farewell}} banquet for 250 guests in June 1932. Meiklejohn did not judge the college's success by its permanence, {{which he did not}} expect—he said he attempted the college as a test. Meiklejohn asked Sellery to give his graduate student advisers university assistantships, but was denied. Meiklejohn began to work on adult education in the University of Wisconsin Extension Division in July 1932, where some of the Experimental College's ideas took hold. He later moved to Berkeley. Advisers who stayed after the program's end—such as classicist Walter Agard, philosopher Carl Bögholt, and political scientist John Gaus—were known <b>as</b> <b>popular</b> and innovative, and Agard became the Classics department chair.|$|E
