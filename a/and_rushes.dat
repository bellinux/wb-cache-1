5|$|The {{temple and}} pyramid were also {{surrounded}} by a brick wall. Likely for reasons of economy, the causeway leading to the mortuary temple {{at the foot of}} the pyramid was never built, no satellite pyramid was added to the mortuary complex, and the valley temple was left unfinished. Consequently, the priest of the mortuary cult of Neferirkare lived on the temple premises, in dwellings of mud-bricks <b>and</b> <b>rushes,</b> rather than in the pyramid town closer to the Nile valley.|$|E

5|$|Hundreds {{of species}} {{of animals and}} plants {{characterize}} the Santa Ana River's diversity of climates and vegetation zones.

Upon leaving the forest, Mulder states that the creature may, in fact, be an evolved version of the first Spanish conquistadors who had first settled in the forest 450 years before. Although Kinsley finds it ridiculous, Mulder believes that centuries of seclusion could be adequate for such drastic adaptations to happen. Afterwards, Mulder realizes that the creatures presume others' presence in their territory as threatening <b>and</b> <b>rushes</b> to the hotel room where Scully is packing her things. After ascertaining that she is finished packing, he firmly urges her to vacate the room, which she does. The camera then pans under the bed where a pair of red eyes open.|$|E

5|$|The {{marshes and}} meres {{surrounding}} the village supported fishing since Saxon times, {{at least until}} significant draining during the 17th century.
