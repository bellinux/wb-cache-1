Then the aircraft received a final once-over by our ground mechanics, any faults were rectified and the Spitfire was ready for collection.|$|E
5|$|Histologically, cholangiocarcinomas {{may vary}} from {{undifferentiated}} to well-differentiated. They are often surrounded by <b>a</b> <b>brisk</b> fibrotic or desmoplastic tissue response; {{in the presence}} of extensive fibrosis, {{it can be difficult to}} distinguish well-differentiated cholangiocarcinoma from normal reactive epithelium. There is no entirely specific immunohistochemical stain that can distinguish malignant from benign biliary ductal tissue, although staining for cytokeratins, carcinoembryonic antigen, and mucins may aid in diagnosis. Most tumors (>90%) are adenocarcinomas.|$|E
5|$|A distant, mournful fanfare (A), {{played on}} a cornet {{representing}} a bugle, is followed by <b>a</b> <b>brisk</b> military march initiated by a duet for side drum and piccolo (B). A passage for brass precedes {{the introduction of a}} theme or leitmotif associated with the phantom Kijé which, after a reprise of the march and a C major crescendo, is repeated on tenor saxophone, an instrument relatively new to the orchestra at that time. The cornet fanfare then returns to close the movement.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, other doctors were also experimenting with gland transplantation, {{including}} Serge Voronoff, {{who had become}} known for grafting monkey testicles into men. In 1920, Voronoff demonstrated his technique before several other doctors {{at a hospital in}} Chicago, at which Brinkley showed up uninvited. Though Brinkley was barred at the door, his appearance elevated his profile in the press, which eventually resulted in his own demonstration at a hospital in Chicago. Brinkley transplanted goat testicles into 34 patients, including a judge, an alderman, a society matron and the chancellor of the now-defunct Chicago Law School (not {{to be confused with the}} University of Chicago Law School), all while the press looked on. His public profile grew, and his gland business in Milford continued at <b>a</b> <b>brisk</b> pace.|$|E
5|$|The artery is only {{present in}} {{approximately}} 3–10% of the population. Thyroid ima artery is of surgical importance; {{due to its}} relatively small size and infrequent presence it can cause complications such as severe bleeding in surgery of the thorax, trachea, thyroid or parathyroid glands. Knowledge of occurrence of the artery is especially important during tracheostomy and thyroidectomy. Because the artery is smaller than the other thyroid vessels, and having an origin {{from one of the}} bigger vessels, <b>a</b> <b>brisk</b> cut while performing the surgery may cause complications such as severe hemorrhage and significant blood loss. The artery, if dissected, may draw back into the mediastinum and further complicate the condition by causing hemorrhage and clots in the thoracic cavity.|$|E
5|$|On August20, 2015, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began {{monitoring}} {{a tropical}} wave over western Africa, near the Atlantic shore. The disorganized system emerged over the Atlantic Ocean several hundred {{miles southeast of}} the Cape Verde Islands the following day. Moving quickly west, the system bypassed the Cape Verde Islands to the south on August22, but remained largely disorganized. A sharp trough developed within expanding deep convection on August23, though a well-defined circulation did not consolidate. Organization of the low improved throughout the day as environmental conditions favored tropical cyclogenesis. The trough acquired gale-force winds the following day and finally developed a closed circulation by 18:00UTC. The formation of a closed low marked the transition into a tropical cyclone; accordingly, the system was classified as Tropical Storm Erika, the fifth named storm of the annual hurricane season. Upon its designation, Erika was situated roughly 1,035mi (1,665km) east of the Lesser Antilles. The storm maintained <b>a</b> <b>brisk</b> westward trajectory, steered by a subtropical ridge to the north.|$|E
