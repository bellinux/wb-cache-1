5|$|The Turkish force withdrew towards Katia, {{which by}} the time the regiment's {{reconnaissance}} patrol got there had been abandoned; the Turks were heading towards Oghratina. Once the enemy were located, the regiment kept patrols in contact with them overnight and <b>all</b> <b>during</b> the next day while the Turks withdrew to Negilia. By 8 August the enemy had reached Bir el Abd, where they established defences and were waiting for the New Zealanders.|$|E
5|$|The band {{recorded}} …And Justice for <b>All</b> <b>during</b> early 1988 at One on One Recording Studios in Los Angeles. Musically, {{the album}} is progressive, with long and complex songs, fast tempos, and few verse-chorus structures. It is noted for its sterile production, which producer Flemming Rasmussen attributed to his absence during the mixing process. The lyrics feature themes of political and legal injustice seen through the prisms of censorship, war, and nuclear brinkmanship.|$|E
5|$|After four largely injury-free seasons, {{the muscular}} {{injuries}} {{that had previously}} plagued Messi reoccurred. After he suffered a hamstring strain on 2 April, during the first quarter-final against Paris Saint-Germain, his appearances became sporadic. In the second leg against PSG, with an underperforming Barcelona down a goal, Messi came off the bench {{in the second half}} and within nine minutes helped create their game-tying goal, which allowed them to progress to the semi-finals. Still unfit, he proved ineffective during the first leg against Bayern Munich and was unable to play at <b>all</b> <b>during</b> the second, as Barcelona were defeated 7–0 on aggregate by the eventual champions. These matches gave credence to the notion of Messidependencia, Barcelona's perceived tactical and psychological dependence on their star player.|$|E

5|$|At the time, {{only about}} $15,000 from the {{building}} fund was still available since money had already been spent on buying the property and materials from the Mellon Mansion. Further fund raising generated 1,200 pledges, 95 percent of which were fulfilled: 60 {{percent of the money}} came from 10 percent of the parishioners and approximately 10 percent of the people did not contribute at <b>all.</b> <b>During</b> this time, all of the books concerning the finances of the construction of the new church were kept by ladies of the St. Peter's Cenacle. The ladies not only recorded all of the pledges and collections, but they also recorded all notices and minutes from their meetings. While the church was being built, the Campaigners met almost every evening.|$|E
5|$|English {{taxation}} {{after the}} Norman Conquest of 1066 {{was based on}} the geld or danegeld, a national tax paid by all free men, those who were not serfs or slaves. The geld {{was based on the}} number of hides of land owned by the taxpayer, and could be demanded by the king and assessed at varying levels without the need for consultation with the barons or other subjects. During King Henry I's reign, an increasing number of exemptions, and the difficulties encountered in collecting the geld, lowered its importance to the Exchequer—the treasury of England. It is unclear whether the geld was collected at <b>all</b> <b>during</b> the reign of Henry's successor, King Stephen. Stephen's successor, King Henry II, collected the geld only twice, once in 1155 and again in 1161–1162. The geld was unpopular, and after 1162 Henry may have felt it politically expedient to stop collecting it.|$|E
5|$|Fàbregas {{was named}} in the {{provisional}} squad in the lead up to the 2013 Confederations Cup by del Bosque. He made two starts in the competition and one substitute appearance, <b>all</b> <b>during</b> the group stage of the competition, and assisting a goal in Spain's opening group match against Uruguay, which Spain won 2–1. Spain won all their group matches, only conceding a goal and scoring 15. Spain advanced to {{the final of the}} competition for the first time, after a lengthy and difficult semi-final clash in a re-match against their opponents of the European Championship Final of the previous year, Italy. The match ended 0–0 after extra time and Spain won 7–6 in the resulting penalty shoot-out, but were eventually defeated 3–0 in the final by hosts and defending champions Brazil.|$|E

5|$|On May 18, the 6th Massachusetts {{and other}} regiments fell back to Deserted House outside of Suffolk. On May 20 they were posted {{in support of}} {{artillery}} at Windsor, Virginia. Finally, on May 23, the 6th Massachusetts received orders to return to Massachusetts. The regiment reached Boston by steamship on May 26 to be welcomed and addressed {{in front of the}} State House by Governor Andrew. The 6th Massachusetts then proceeded to Lowell, where they were received with enthusiastic festivities. The regiment reassembled on June 3, 1863, at Camp Wilson and were mustered out. In <b>all</b> <b>during</b> their second enlistment, the regiment lost 13 men killed or mortally wounded in combat and 18 by disease.|$|E
5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. All teams, including Mercedes used the softer tyre compound during the first session (Q1). Jenson Button, who had problems with his car <b>all</b> <b>during</b> practice, was unable to set a time when his car broke down on his out lap. Lewis Hamilton set the fastest time, with Valtteri Bottas in second. Along with Button, both Manor Marussia cars were eliminated in Q1, as well as Daniil Kvyat– who made a mistake during his final lap– and Pastor Maldonado. Fernando Alonso was the first driver to reach a second qualifying session for McLaren {{over the course of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|Since 1949, a more {{detailed}} classification system has been put into use based on thematic content and the historical period of a play's creation. The first category in this system is chuantongxi, traditional plays that were in performance before 1949. The second category is xinbian de lishixi, historical plays written after 1949. This type of play was not produced at <b>all</b> <b>during</b> the Cultural Revolution, but is a major focus today. The final category is xiandaixi, contemporary plays. The subject matter of these plays is taken from the 20th century and beyond. Contemporary productions are also frequently experimental in nature, and may incorporate Western influences. In {{the second half of}} the 20th century, Western works have increasingly been adapted for Peking opera. The works of Shakespeare have been especially popular. The movement to adapt Shakespeare to the stage has encompassed all forms of Chinese theatre. Peking opera in particular has seen versions of A Midsummer Night's Dream and King Lear, among others.|$|E

Swanigan started every game his {{freshman}} year. His highest scoring game was in a win against Wisconsin in Purdue's last regular season game, where he scored 27 points and missed only one shot from the field. He scored 6 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in #4 Purdue's loss to #13 Arkansas-Little Rock, and did not play at <b>all</b> <b>during</b> the overtime period.|$|E
5|$|The club's record league {{victory was}} a 10–2 win over Castleton Gabriels on 10 December 2005 in the North West Counties Football League Division Two; Simon Carden scored {{five of the}} goals, which is the club record for {{the highest number of}} goals scored by a player in a single game. F.C. United {{achieved}} eight-goal victory margins on three further occasions, in 8–0 wins over Squires Gate, Glossop North End and Nelson, <b>all</b> <b>during</b> the 2006–07 season. The club's heaviest league defeat was 0–5 to Harrogate Town on 20 February 2016 in the National League North.|$|E
5|$|The {{ranges of}} the American and Chinese {{alligator}} extend into regions that sometimes experience periods of frost in winter. Being ectothermic, the internal body temperature of crocodilians falls {{as the temperature}} drops, and they become sluggish. They may become more active on warm days, but do not usually feed at <b>all</b> <b>during</b> the winter. In cold weather, they remain submerged with their tails in deeper, less cold water and their nostrils just projecting through the surface. If ice forms on the water, they maintain ice-free breathing holes, {{and there have been}} occasions when their snouts have become frozen into the ice. Temperature sensing probes implanted in wild American alligators have found that their core body temperatures can descend to around , but as long as they remain able to breathe they show no ill effects when the weather warms up.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to several}} rain showers between {{first and second}} practice, the track was again wet during the second session, which limited the drivers to using the {{intermediate}} tyres only. Hamilton was again fastest, setting a time of 1:38.841. Teammate Rosberg crashed at turn seven thirty minutes into the session, damaging a new-specification front wing that the team had deliberately not run in first practice for fear of damage. Rosberg later apologised for the incident, which saw him {{trying to get back}} to pit lane, before his team told him to stop on track, calling an early end to his session. Nico Hülkenberg, Räikkönen, Ricciardo and Carlos Sainz Jr. all finished within one second of Hamilton's time, while Sergio Pérez was at one point {{on his way to a}} new fastest time overall, setting best times in the first two timechecks along the track, before having to slow in the last part of the lap due to heavy rain. The two Manor drivers Pascal Wehrlein and Haryanto covered the highest number of laps, with 24 and 22 laps in 12th and 14th place respectively. Neither Renault nor Williams drivers set a time, albeit going on track. The Sauber cars and Max Verstappen's Toro Rosso did not leave the garage at <b>all</b> <b>during</b> the session.|$|E
5|$|Garfield's accomplishments as {{president}} included {{a resurgence of}} presidential authority against senatorial courtesy in executive appointments, energizing American naval power, and purging corruption in the Post Office, <b>all</b> <b>during</b> his extremely short time in office. Garfield made notable diplomatic and judiciary appointments, including a U.S. Supreme Court justice. He enhanced {{the powers of the}} presidency when he defied the powerful New York senator Roscoe Conkling by appointing William H. Robertson to the lucrative post of Collector of the Port of New York, starting a fracas that ended with Robertson's confirmation and Conkling's resignation from the Senate. Garfield advocated agricultural technology, an educated electorate, and civil rights for African Americans. He also proposed substantial civil service reform, eventually passed by Congress in 1883 and signed into law by his successor, Chester A. Arthur, as the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act. On July 2, 1881, he was shot at the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station in Washington D.C. by Charles J. Guiteau, a lawyer and writer with a grievance. The wound was not immediately fatal for Garfield, but his doctors' uncleaned and unprotected hands are said to have led to infection that caused his death on September 19. Guiteau was convicted of the murder and was executed in June 1882; he tried to name his crime as simple assault by blaming the doctors for Garfield's death. With his term cut short by his death after only 200 days, and much of it spent in ill health trying to recover from the attack, Garfield is little-remembered for other than his assassination. Historians often forgo listing him in rankings of U.S. presidents due to the short length of his presidency.|$|E
5|$|McAllister {{started his}} career with Eastleigh as a youth player. He moved to Basingstoke Town {{towards the end of}} 2001–02, making his debut in March 2002. McAllister spent three seasons there, making 113 appearances, scoring 66 goals before moving up the {{national}} league system to Conference National club Stevenage Borough where he made 10 appearances, having loan spells at Gravesend & Northfleet and Eastleigh in 2004–05. He joined Woking in 2005, spending two full seasons there, and making over 100 appearances. He had a short spell with Grays Athletic, being sent out on loan to Rushden & Diamonds and then another short spell at Oxford United, <b>all</b> <b>during</b> 2007–08. After leaving Oxford in 2008, he took a step up to the Football League {{for the first time in}} his career, signing for Exeter City. He went on to score seven goals in his first season, but was loaned out to Barnet and Rotherham United in his second and was eventually released by the club in May 2010. McAllister then dropped back down to non-League football, joining Crawley Town where he played at Old Trafford; his team was defeated 1–0 by Manchester United in their FA Cup fifth round tie. He rejected a new contract from Crawley at the end of the 2010–11, subsequently joining Newport County.|$|E

5|$|On the {{completion}} of his extra year learning Arabic at Oxford, Seamer joined the Sudan Political Service. He continued to play cricket for Somerset during his periods of leave, but it dramatically reduced his availability for the county. During his time at Oxford, Seamer had become good friends with Mitchell-Innes; the pair both attended the same college, and played together for both the university and Somerset. When Mitchell-Innes graduated from Oxford the year after Seamer, he joined his friend in the Sudan, where the pair often organised cricket matches, despite the extreme heat. Seamer's duties prevented him from playing for Somerset at <b>all</b> <b>during</b> 1937, but he appeared eight times the following year through May and early June. His average that season was the highest he achieved after leaving university, recording 20.78 from his 14 innings, though his highest score was 47 runs, scored against Derbyshire. In 1939, the last season of first-class county cricket in England before the Second World War, Seamer played seven times for Somerset. However, unlike his appearances the previous year, {{in which he had}} generally batted as part of the top order, Seamer predominantly appeared in the middle order for the county in 1939, and his highest score was 28.|$|E
5|$|The city of Bastogne, Belgium was a hub {{of several}} major roads {{and became a}} prime target for the Germans, seeing its capture as {{necessary}} to their advance. Middleton was in continuous communication with Bradley at 12th Army Group headquarters in Luxembourg, and maintained that though Bastogne could soon be surrounded, it should be held. As the Germans advanced on Bastogne, both Bradley and First Army commander Hodges recognized the threat to Middleton and had him move his headquarters. He was supposed to leave Bastogne on 18 December, but spent another night there {{so that he could}} brief his relief force, the 101st Airborne Division. Not only did that division's acting commander, Brigadier General Anthony McAuliffe, show up ahead of schedule, but so did Colonel William Roberts from the 10th Armored Division Combat Command R (CCR), sent by Patton. Another welcome guest arriving later that evening was Major General Matthew Ridgway, commander of XVIII Airborne Corps, en route to his headquarters, but advised by Middleton to stay in Bastogne for the night to avoid capture by the Germans. While Middleton and his guests slept, elements of the 101st Airborne poured into Bastogne <b>all</b> <b>during</b> the night and into the following day.|$|E
5|$|While at Oxford, Mitchell-Innes {{had become}} {{good friends with}} Jake Seamer, who had also {{attended}} Brasenose College, and the pair were teammates for both Oxford and Somerset. Seamer had joined the Sudan Political Service (SPS) on his graduation in 1936, and while at Oxford, Mitchell-Innes also secured a role with the organisation {{that he would take}} up after his graduation. His duties with the SPS prevented him from playing for Somerset at <b>all</b> <b>during</b> 1938, but he made seven early-season appearances the following year, though two were for the Marylebone Cricket Club and the Free Foresters. It was for the latter of these that Mitchell-Innes made his only century of the season; playing against Oxford University, the Free Foresters required nearly 400 runs in the fourth innings to win. Mitchell-Innes opened the innings, and after the lunch interval on the final day he played attacking cricket, bringing up his century in 95 minutes. He was eventually dismissed for 143 runs, bowled as he tried to heave an on drive. The Free Foresters came within nine runs of their target, but were bowled out before they could reach it. In total, he scored 347 runs at 31.54 that year; the last season of first-class county cricket in England before it was interrupted by the Second World War.|$|E
