Some dietary fat is {{necessary}} to facilitate absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) and carotenoids. Humans and other mammals have a dietary requirement for certain essential fatty acids, such as linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid) and <b>alpha-linolenic</b> <b>acid</b> (an omega-3 fatty acid) because they cannot be synthesized from simple precursors in the diet. Both of these fatty acids are 18-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids differing in the number and position of the double bonds. Most vegetable oils are rich in linoleic acid (safflower, sunflower, and corn oils). <b>Alpha-linolenic</b> <b>acid</b> is found in the green leaves of plants, and in selected seeds, nuts, and legumes (in particular flax, rapeseed, walnut, and soy). Fish oils are particularly rich in the longer-chain omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). A large number of studies have shown positive health benefits associated with consumption of omega-3 fatty acids on infant development, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and various mental illnesses, such as depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and dementia. In contrast, it is now well-established that consumption of trans fats, such as those present in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.|$|E

The optimisation of sprouting process {{and the influence of}} selenium supplementation, in doses 10, 15, and 30 mg/l of selenium as sodium selenite, on amaranth growth and fatty acid profile were examined. Methods such as FRAP, DPPH, polyphenols content and GPX activity were applied to characterize antioxidant poten- tial of seeds and sprouts of four different edible amaranth genera. E. coli, S. aureus, C. albicans were used to evaluate amaranth sprouts antimicrobial properties. Interaction be- tween amaranth sprouts and biological systems was assessed by analysing antibacterial and antifungal properties with a disc diffusion test. The studies proved amaranth sprouts to be potentially attractive as functional food. As confirmed by all the data amaranth sprouts are suitable as a moderate selenium accumulator and are rich in essential fatty acids, especially linoleic and <b>alpha-linolenic</b> <b>acids,</b> which are precursors of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. Thus, it opens dietary opportunities for amaranth sprouts. They can also serve as a moderate source of antioxidant compounds.

Diets were fed for 4 wk. Given the emerging evidence for an association between elevated endocannabinoid concentrations and metabolic syndrome, we also measured tissue endocannabinoid concentrations. In (n- 3) LCPUFA-supplemented rats, liver triglycerides and the peritoneal macrophage response to an inflammatory stimulus were significantly lower than in rats fed the control diet, and heart triglycerides were lower, but only in KO-fed rats. These effects were associated with a lower concentration of the endocannabinoids, anandamide and 2 -arachidonoylglycerol, in the visceral adipose tissue and of anandamide in the liver and heart, which, in turn, was associated with lower levels of arachidonic acid in membrane phospholipids, but not with higher activity of endocannabinoid-degrading enzymes. Our data suggest that the beneficial effects of a diet enriched with (n- 3) LCPUFA are the result of changes in membrane fatty acid composition. The reduction of substrates for inflammatory molecules and endocannabinoids may account for the dampened inflammatory response and the physiological reequilibration of body fat deposition in obese rats...|$|R

We observe a heterogeneous uptake which is droplet-size dependent, time dependent, and lipid dependent. Cells grown in linoleic acid-supplemented medium show the largest distribution of lipid content across different droplets at all times during differentiation. When analyzing the average lipid content, we find that adding linoleic or <b>alpha-linolenic</b> fatty <b>acids</b> at day 0 results in uptake of the new lipid components with an exponential time constant of 22 ± 2 hr. Conversely, switching lipids at day 3 results in an exponential time constant of 60 ± 5 hr.

To test this hypothesis, the activity of rat Delta 6 -desaturase expressed in COS- 7 cells was investigated. Recombinant Delta 6 -desaturase expression was analysed by Western blot, revealing a single band at 45 kDa. The putative involvement of this enzyme in the Delta 6 -desaturation of C(24 : 5) n- 3 to C(24 : 6) n- 3 was measured by incubating transfected cells with C(22 : 5) n- 3. Whereas both transfected and non-transfected COS- 7 cells were able to synthesize C(24 : 5) n- 3 by elongation of C(22 : 5) n- 3, only cells expressing Delta 6 -desaturase were also able to produce C(24 : 6) n- 3. In addition, Delta 6 -desaturation of [1 -(14) C]C(24 : 5) n- 3 was assayed in vitro in homogenates from COS- 7 cells expressing Delta 6 -desaturase or not, showing that Delta 6 -desaturase catalyses the conversion of C(24 : 5) n- 3 to C(24 : 6) n- 3. Evidence is therefore presented that the same rat Delta 6 -desaturase catalyses not only the conversion of C(18 : 3) n- 3 to C(18 : 4) n- 3, but also the conversion of C(24 : 5) n- 3 to C(24 : 6) n- 3.

An appropriate balance of essential fatty acids—omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids—seems also important for health, although definitive experimental demonstration has been elusive. Both of these [...] "omega" [...] long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are substrates for a class of eicosanoids known as prostaglandins, which have roles throughout the human body. They are hormones, in some respects. The omega-3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which can be made in the human body from the omega-3 essential fatty acid <b>alpha-linolenic</b> <b>acid</b> (ALA), or taken in through marine food sources, serves as a building block for series 3 prostaglandins (e.g., weakly inflammatory PGE3). The omega-6 dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) serves as a building block for series 1 prostaglandins (e.g. anti-inflammatory PGE1), whereas arachidonic acid (AA) serves as a building block for series 2 prostaglandins (e.g. pro-inflammatory PGE 2). Both DGLA and AA can be made from the omega-6 linoleic acid (LA) in the human body, or can be taken in directly through food. An appropriately balanced intake of omega-3 and omega-6 partly determines the relative production of different prostaglandins, which is one reason why a balance between omega-3 and omega-6 is believed important for cardiovascular health. In industrialized societies, people typically consume large amounts of processed vegetable oils, which have reduced amounts of the essential fatty acids along with too much of omega-6 fatty acids relative to omega-3 fatty acids.|$|E

Recently, we have shown that relatively low doses of dietary n- 3 LCPUFAs (4 weeks), {{in the form of}} either fish or krill oil, balanced for EPA and DHA content, and against a control diet with no EPA and DHA and similar contents of oleic, linoleic and <b>alpha-linolenic</b> <b>acids,</b> lower the concentrations of the endocannabinoids, anandamide (AEA) and 2 -arachidonoylglycerol (2 -AG), in the visceral adipose tissue, and of AEA in the liver and heart, of obese Zucker rats. This, in turn, is associated with lower levels of arachidonic acid in membrane phospholipids and with amelioration of some metabolic syndrome parameters. We investigated here whether in Zucker rats, under the same conditions, fish and krill oil are also able to influence LCPUFA and endocannabinoid profiles in brain. Only krill oil was able to increase significantly DNA levels in brain phospholipids, with no changes in arachidonic acid. DHA increase was associated with lower levels of 2 -AG in the brain, whereas AEA and its congeners, N-palmitoylethanolamine and N-oleoylethanolamine, were unchanged. We conclude that, despite the strong impact of dietary n- 3 fatty acid on endocannabinoid levels previously observed in peripheral tissues, in the brain only 2 -AG is affected by dietary krill oil, suggesting that the beneficial effect of the latter on the metabolic syndrome is mostly exerted by modifying peripheral endocannabinoids. Nevertheless, possible effects of dietary krill oil in the brain through modification of 2 -AG levels deserve further investigation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

The methane inhibitory effect of capric acid was more pronounced at the highest (30 mg) dose compared to the medium (20 mg) (- 85 % v. - 34 %), whereas the lower dose (10 mg) did not reduce rumen methanogenesis. A 23 % decrease in total short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production was observed, accompanied by shifts towards increased butyrate at 20 mg and increased propionate at 30 mg of capric acid (P < 0. 001). Capric acid linearly decreased the extent of biohydrogenation of C 18 : 2 n- 6 and C 18 : 3 n- 3, by up to 60 % and 86 %, respectively. This reduction was partially due to a lower extent of lipolysis when capric acid was supplemented.

40|$|Dietary {{polyunsaturated}} {{fatty acids}} (PUFA) {{play a key}} role in regulating delta- 6 desaturase (D 6 D), the key enzyme for long-chain PUFA biosynthesis. Nevertheless, the extent of their effects on this enzyme remains controversial and difficult to assess. It has been generally admitted that C 18 unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) regulate negatively delta- 6 desaturase (D 6 D). This inhibition has been evidenced in regard to a high glucose/fat free (HG/FF) diet used in reference. However, several nutritional investigations did not evidence any inhibition of desaturases when feeding fatty acids. Because the choice of the basal diet appeared to be of primary importance in such experiments, our goal was to reconsider the specific role of dietary UFAs on D 6 D regulation, depending on nutritional conditions. For that, sixteen adult Wistar rats were fed purified linoleic acid, α-linolenic acid or oleic acid, included in one of two diets at 4 % by weight: an HG/FF or a high starch base (HS) where the pure UFAs replaced a mixed vegetable oil. Our results showed first that D 6 D specific activity was significantly greater when measured in presence of an HG/FF than with an HS/ 4 % vegetable oil diet. Secondly, we found that linoleic and <b>alpha-linolenic</b> <b>acids</b> added to HG/FF reduced the specific activity of D 6 D. In contrast, when pure UFAs were added to an HS base, D 6 D specific activities remained unchanged or increased. Concordant results were obtained on D 6 D mRNA expression. Altogether, this study evidenced the importance of the nutritional status in D 6 D regulation by C 18 UFAs: when used as control, HG/FF diet stimulates D 6 D compared with a standard control diet containing starch and 4 % fats, leading to an overestimation of the D 6 D regulation by UFAs. Then, UFAs should be considered as repressors for unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis only in very specific nutritional conditions. <br /...|$|R

Cookies supplemented with chia flour contained signicantly more protein, fat, crude fiber, calcium, zinc, and <b>alpha-linolenic</b> (n- 3) <b>acid.</b> It was estimated that the supplemented cookies would contribute to the corresponding DRIs in the range of 8. 1 - 13. 8 % (children) and 6. 5 - 11. 0 % (males/females) for calcium; and 14. 0 - 18. 0 % (children) and 6. 4 - 11. 3 (males/females) for zinc. The addition of chia flour to the cookies resulted in a product sensorially acceptable with a better fatty acid profile (lower n- 6 /n- 3). Supplemented cookies would contribute to alpha-linolenic DRI in the range of 65. 9 - 134. 5 % (children), 49. 4 - 100. 9 % (males), and 53. 9 - 110. 0 % (females). Dietary intake of protein, fiber, calcium, zinc, and <b>alpha-linolenic</b> (n- 3) <b>acid</b> could be increased by the consumption of sugar-snap cookies supplemented with chia flour. </p...|$|R
