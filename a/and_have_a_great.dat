5|$|SMP2 {{supports}} {{a trial of}} a special category of bigadv work units, designed to simulate proteins that are unusually large and computationally intensive <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> scientific priority. These units originally required a minimum of eight CPU cores, which was raised to sixteen later, on February7, 2012. Along with these added hardware requirements over standard SMP2 work units, they require more system resources such as random-access memory (RAM) and Internet bandwidth. In return, users who run these are rewarded with a 20% increase over SMP2's bonus point system. The bigadv category allows Folding@home to run especially demanding simulations for long times that had formerly required use of supercomputing clusters {{and could not be}} performed anywhere else on Folding@home. Many users with hardware able to run bigadv units have later had their hardware setup deemed ineligible for bigadv work units when CPU core minimums were increased, leaving them only able to run the normal SMP work units. This frustrated many users who invested significant amounts of money into the program only to have their hardware be obsolete for bigadv purposes shortly after. As a result, Vijay Pande announced in January 2014 that the bigadv program would end on January 31, 2015.|$|E

500|$|The opening track, [...] "Sure Hope You Mean It", {{features}} slightly off-beat percussion, tambourine shakes, {{and lyrics}} {{about a man}} who awaits a sign of approval from the woman he admires. [...] "Keep Marchin", which evoked socially conscious and positive sentiments, was composed in the vein of the Civil Rights Movement era soul music by artists such as Sam Cooke and the Staple Singers. Gail Mitchell from Billboard compared the song to Curtis Mayfield and the Impressions' 1968 song [...] "We're a Winner". Saadiq said [...] "Keep Marchin" [...] was also inspired by his journey in the music industry. [...] "Big Easy", featuring New Orleans-style brass playing, was sung {{from the point of view}} of a man in New Orleans who reacts to Hurricane Katrina and looks for his lost lover. J. Gabriel Boylan of The New York Observer remarked that the song [...] "manages to cast Hurricane Katrina as the villain in a romance, tearing lovers apart." [...] Its composition—mixing a blissful sound with disheartening lyrics—is similar to the songwriting technique used by Holland–Dozier–Holland. Saadiq was inspired to write [...] "Big Easy" [...] after watching the 2006 documentary film When the Levees Broke. He explained its upbeat composition in an interview for All Things Considered: [...] "In New Orleans, when they mourn, they really celebrate <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> time. I wanted to give it that same spirit." ...|$|E
2500|$|The post-industrial {{economy was}} noted in 1973 by Daniel Bell.

Since all sectors are highly interconnected, this did not reflect less importance for manufacturing, agriculture, and mining but just {{a shift in the}} type of economic activity.|$|E
2500|$|Although his {{journals}} clarify {{some aspects}} of his work and life, Kierkegaard took care not to reveal too much. Abrupt changes in thought, repetitive writing, and unusual turns of phrase are some among the many tactics he used to throw readers off track. Consequently, there are many varying interpretations of his journals. Kierkegaard did not doubt the importance his journals would have in the future. In December 1849, he wrote: [...] "Were I to die now the effect of {{my life would be}} exceptional; much of what I have simply jotted down carelessly in the Journals would become of great importance <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> effect; for then people would have grown reconciled to me and would be able to grant me what was, and is, my right." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tevez {{made his}} West Ham debut after coming on as a second-half {{substitute}} in the 1–1 home draw with Aston Villa on 10 September 2006. However, after this match, West Ham {{went on a}} nine-game winless streak (one draw and eight defeats), which included seven consecutive matches without scoring. This winless run also included going out of both the UEFA Cup and League Cup. In November of the same season, Tevez left the ground early after being substituted and throwing a tantrum during a league match against Sheffield United, and as punishment, his teammates decided Tevez had to donate half of a week's wages to charity and train in a Brazil jersey. Tevez refused to wear the shirt, saying, [...] "I played in Brazil <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> respect for Brazil and Brazilians but I'm Argentine and won't wear that shirt." ...|$|E
2500|$|He becomes {{friends with}} a woman named Dixie Cooney, and when he finds out that Dr. Greg Madden has {{manipulated}} her into giving up her child, he warns Kendall of Madden, {{who happens to be}} Kendall's OBGYN. Kendall does not listen to Zach at first, but it is not long before Kendall admits that she needs Zach in her life. She tells him that she still loves him, and the two reunite. They are married at sea. This happy reunion does not last long though. Shortly after, Kendall is thrown into a coma after construction materials fall on her, in what is a botched murder attempt by her best friend, JR Chandler, in a drunken effort to kill his wife [...] Babe. The doctors inform Kendall's loved ones that if they go about the needed procedure to save Kendall's life, it will most likely mean the death of her unborn baby; if the baby is allowed to be born later than sooner, it will kill Kendall. Zach is naturally conflicted. He remembers Kendall's words of wanting the baby to grow up <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> life, thus Zach painfully chooses Kendall's wishes. He knows she would choose the life of her unborn baby over her own life. He barricades himself in Kendall's hospital room, even occupying a handgun to keep everyone out, except needed doctors, until the baby is born. Spike Lavery enters the world on May 31, 2006, and Kendall later awakes from her coma, now a mother to a beautiful baby boy.|$|E

2500|$|The Boston Advertiser {{reviewed}} Indian myths; or, legends, {{traditions and}} {{symbols of the}} aborigines of America (James R. Osgood, 1884) and stated that [...] "A large and interesting collection of Indian myths has been made by Ellen Russell Emerson, with the desire of making more evident {{the capacity of the}} Indian race for moral and intellectual culture[...] [...] [...] In support of these views Miss Emerson gives the results of her wide reading on all matters relating to North American Indians, and to the mythology of different countries, showing the family likeness that runs through the legends, traditions and symbols, and is even seen in the languages of the aborigines of America, and the races of the East,—Persians, Assyrians, Hindoos, Chinese and Egyptians. These legends and myths deal with God, with the origin of man and of evil, with all the powers of nature, with forms of worship, and with birds, animals, trees and rocks. They are full of strange and interesting things, <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal of wild fancy and poetic beauty mingled with their childishness. Miss Emerson deals with the capacities and prospects of the red race as a race, not with the wrongs of the separate tribes, or the injustice and inhumanity of the United States Government toward them; but her book is a claim, based on history and ethnology, not on religion or philanthropy, for the full recognition of Indians as belonging to the brotherhood of men, with rights to be respected and powers to be developed." [...] In the 1989 The Journal of American Indian Family Research, it stated that Indian myths was [...] "A valuable study of Indian myths compared with other cultures of the world." ...|$|E
