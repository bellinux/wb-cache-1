This source was confirmed to be M87 by 1953, and the linear relativistic jet emerging from {{the core of the}} galaxy was suggested as the cause. This jet extended from the core at a position angle of 260° to an angular distance of 20″ with an <b>angular</b> <b>width</b> of 2″.

25|$|The {{smallest}} detectable {{visual angle}} {{produced by a}} single fine dark line against a uniformly illuminated background is also much less than foveal cone size or regular visual acuity. In this case, under optimal conditions, the limit is about 0.5 arc seconds or only about 2% of the diameter of a foveal cone. This produces a contrast of about 1% with the illumination of surrounding cones. The mechanism of detection {{is the ability to}} detect such small differences in contrast or illumination, and does not depend on the <b>angular</b> <b>width</b> of the bar, which cannot be discerned. Thus as the line gets finer, it appears to get fainter but not thinner.|$|E

50|$|The beam {{diameter}} or beam width of an electromagnetic beam is the diameter along any specified line that is {{perpendicular to the}} beam axis and intersects it. Since beams typically do not have sharp edges, the diameter can be defined in many different ways. Five definitions of the beam width are in common use: D4σ, 10/90 or 20/80 knife-edge, 1/e2, FWHM, and D86. The beam width {{can be measured in}} units of length at a particular plane perpendicular to the beam axis, but it can also refer to the <b>angular</b> <b>width,</b> which is the angle subtended by the beam at the source. The <b>angular</b> <b>width</b> is also called the beam divergence.|$|E

40|$|Positive ions are {{accelerated}} at or {{near the}} earth's bow shock and propagate into the upstream region.

Very few ions are accelerated in the vicinity of the shock to energies much above about 100 keV. It is not yet clear whether the most energetic ions (i. e., those near 100 keV) are accelerated at the shock or in the broad disturbed region upstream from the shock.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between active regions (ARs) and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is studied. For this purpose a {{statistical analysis of}} 694 CMEs as-sociated with ARs was carried out.

The fastest and halo CMEs can be ejected only from the most complex ARs (when an AR is a bipolar group of spots with large asymmetric penumbras around the main spot with many smaller spots in the group). We also showed that the wider events have a tendency to originate from uncomplicated magnetic structures. This tendency was used for estimation of the real <b>angular</b> <b>widths</b> of the halo CMEs. The probability of launching of fast CMEs increases to-gether with increase of the complexity and size of ARs.
