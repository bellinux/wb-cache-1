5|$|On July 1, 1879 the Army Signal Service {{began taking}} weather {{observations}} using weather equipment at the Springer Building in Springfield {{becoming the first}} federal weather station in the region. Eleven years later the U.S. Weather Bureau was founded and the equipment in Springfield was transferred from the Signal Service to the Weather Bureau. In 1898 Springfield became {{the site of a}} new weather station that used kites to measure data in the atmosphere using tethered instruments. In 1905 Peoria became the site of a new U.S. Weather Bureau, constructed at the cost of $7,969 the station measured temperatures, wind speeds, precipitation, snowfall, and barometric pressure. A year later at the Peoria Station a telegraph was installed to help better transmit weather data and observations. In Springfield the Weather Bureau was officially moved from its original location to a new building at 7th and Monroe. In 1928 the Springfield Weather Bureau moved temporarily to the <b>Abe</b> <b>Lincoln</b> Hotel and the old office was subsequently destroyed for construction of a new federal courthouse.

Reagan recalled, [...] "I {{looked up at the}} presidential box above the stage where <b>Abe</b> <b>Lincoln</b> had been sitting the night he was shot and felt a curious sensation...

Moser of The Morning Call said that the performance resonated with the audience, even though Cyrus was lifted atop a huge pedestal. Jane Stevenson of the Toronto Sun wrote, [...] "She went for a big ending, with fireworks, confetti, an elevating stage and dancers dressed as <b>Abe</b> <b>Lincoln,</b> Mount Rushmore, the Liberty Bell and The Statue of Liberty for the final older song Party in the U.S.A." [...] A critic from Nashville Scene wrote, [...] "Party in the U.S.A. was sung by Miley and screamed back by every person in the crowd. Cue red-white-and-blue confetti. Cue fireworks. Pack the Bangerz Tour up and put the circus back on the road. Fans in other cities need to party, too." [...] Cyrus also performed the song during the musical festival on June 21, 2014, Summertime Ball at Wembley Stadium of London, in front of 80,000 people.|$|E

2500|$|A month later, LaRouche held a {{press conference}} to accuse the Soviet government, British government, drug dealers, {{international}} bankers, and journalists of being involved in a variety of conspiracies.

He refused to answer a question from an NBC reporter, saying [...] "How can I talk with a drug pusher like you?" [...] He called the leadership of the United States [...] "idiotic" [...] and [...] "berserk," [...] and its foreign policy [...] "criminal or insane." [...] He warned of the imminent collapse of the banking system and accused banks of laundering drug money. Asked about the movement's finances, he said [...] "I don't know. ...

2500|$|Scharnhorst {{describes}} {{six major}} themes in Alger's boys' books. The first, the Rise to Respectability, he observes, {{is evident in}} both his early and his late books, notably Ragged Dick, whose impoverished young hero declares, [...] "I mean to turn over a new leaf, and try to grow up 'spectable." [...] His virtuous life wins him not riches but, more realistically, a comfortable clerical position and salary. The second major theme is Character Strengthened Through Adversity. In Strong and Steady and Shifting for Himself, for example, the affluent heroes are reduced to poverty and forced {{to meet the demands}} of their new circumstances. Alger occasionally cited the young <b>Abe</b> <b>Lincoln</b> as a representative of this theme for his readers. The third theme is Beauty versus Money, which became central to Alger's adult fiction. Characters fall in love and marry on the basis of their character, talents, or intellect rather than the size of their bank accounts. In The Train Boy, for example, a wealthy heiress chooses to marry a talented but struggling artist, and in The Erie Train Boy a poor woman wins her true love despite the machinations of a rich, depraved suitor. Other major themes include the Old World versus the New.|$|E
