One of the reasons was the disbanding of the Rifle Corps between August and September 1941 and the consequent removal of the corps artillery.

The agency used weather stations that were established by Spain and the United States after each country ruled over the archipelago. The weather data ceased in August 1940, which were later rebuilt in 1945. Also in 1940, meteorology records were disrupted in Hong Kong, which were later restored in 1947, due to World War II.|$|E

Reaching cooler waters, Danielle began to weaken, becoming a remnant low on August21 and dissipating on August24. Danielle never approached land, although it briefly threatened the Azores as it made a northerly turn. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>result,</b> <b>there</b> was no impact caused by the storm.|$|E

5|$|In September 1969, Cheyenne {{prototype}} #10 (s/n 66-8835) underwent {{wind tunnel}} testing at NASA Ames Research Center, {{to research the}} half-P hop and drag issues.

The remote controllers' lack of sensory feedback from helicopter compounded the situation. During high speed testing to replicate the half-P hop vibration, the rotor oscillations quickly accelerated out of control and struck the tail boom, resulting in the destructive breakup of the helicopter.|$|E

The post office at Fourth and Broadway, built despite much public outcry over the demolition of its landmark 1894 predecessor, is the district's most notable building of the 1930s. Its stripped-down Classical Revival style shows the influence of Art Deco in its smooth, finished surfaces.

5|$|Soon {{after the}} end of the American Revolution in 1783, a surge of westward {{migration}} into Central and Western New York began. At the time, most travel west of the Albany area was by water. While rudimentary roads were laid out following the Mohawk River, there were no major land routes west of Fort Schuyler (present day Utica), except for an old east–west Iroquois trail that was a simple foot path. By the late 1780s many companies began to set up their operations in the new settlements in the Central and Western New York. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>result,</b> <b>there</b> was a clamor for the building of a main road running west from Utica.|$|E

The Directory wanted France to assume responsibility for liberating the works of art they deemed in danger in order to protect and nationalize the heritage and culture of their subjects. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>result,</b> <b>there</b> were teams of artists and scientists who accompanied the armies into battle equipped with lists of paintings, sculptures, and other pieces of patrimony that would be collected, crated, and shipped back to France.|$|E
