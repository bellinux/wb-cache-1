25|$|An Asian coffee {{known as}} kopi luwak {{undergoes}} a peculiar process made from coffee berries eaten by the <b>Asian</b> <b>palm</b> <b>civet,</b> passing through its digestive tract, with the beans eventually harvested from feces. Coffee brewed from {{this process is}} among the most expensive in the world, with bean prices reaching $160 per pound or $30 per brewed cup. Kopi luwak coffee is said to have uniquely rich, slightly smoky aroma and flavor with hints of chocolate, resulting from the action of digestive enzymes breaking down bean proteins to facilitate partial fermentation.|$|E
25|$|In late May 2003, {{studies were}} {{conducted}} using samples of wild animals sold as {{food in the}} local market in Guangdong, China. The results found that the SARS coronavirus could be isolated from masked palm civets (Paguma sp.), even if the animals did not show clinical signs of the virus. The preliminary conclusion was the SARS virus crossed the xenographic barrier from <b>asian</b> <b>palm</b> <b>civet</b> to humans, and more than 10,000 masked palm civets were killed in Guangdong Province. The virus was also later found in raccoon dogs (Nyctereuteus sp.), ferret badgers (Melogale spp.), and domestic cats. In 2005, two studies {{identified a number of}} SARS-like coronaviruses in Chinese bats.|$|E
25|$|The Central Zoo Authority of India (CZA) has {{identified}} the park as coordinating zoo for the breeding programmes for endangered species as per the National Zoo Policy {{adopted by the}} Government of India in 1988, which states that the main objective of zoos will be to complement and strengthen national efforts in the conservation of the country's rich biodiversity and that the species which have no chance of survival in the wild would be bred under ex-situ conditions. The park has {{a high rate of}} success in captive breeding of lion-tailed macaques. In 2010, the zoo had 22 lion-tailed macaques, from a breeding pair that were brought to the zoo in 1983. The park is also successful in breeding other rare species in captivity, including ostrich, <b>Asian</b> <b>palm</b> <b>civet,</b> Indian gaur, wild dog, Asiatic lion, Nilgiri langur, sangai, hippo, Malabar giant squirrel, white tiger, Asiatic wolf, panther and bison. The zoo is among four in the country to have an ostrich. The park also undertakes cross-breeding as part of its conservation efforts. The park is also a participating zoo of the CZA for the captive breeding of rock python, Nilgiri langur, lion-tailed macaque, Asiatic lion, wild dog, Asiatic wolf, and gaur. The zoo also promotes exterior conservation—conservation of rare species in their natural habitat—whereby individuals born in the zoo are released in the wild after adequate training, as per the guidelines of the CZA.|$|E

50|$|<b>Asian</b> <b>palm</b> <b>civets</b> are {{believed}} to lead a solitary lifestyle, except for brief periods during mating. They are both terrestrial and arboreal, showing nocturnal activity patterns with peaks between late evening until after midnight. They are usually active between 6:00 pm and 4:00 am, being less active during nights when the moon is brightest.|$|R

This selective picking gives the growers reason to give their coffee a certain specification called [...] "operation cherry red" [...] (OCR). In rare circumstances, the <b>Asian</b> <b>palm</b> <b>civet</b> eats coffee berries and excretes the beans. These beans are called kopi luwak, and can be processed further into a rare and expensive coffee.|$|E

25|$|In 2013, The Seattle Times {{reported}} that global coffee prices dropped more than 50 percent year-over-year. In Thailand, black ivory coffee beans are fed to elephants whose digestive enzymes reduce the bitter taste of beans collected from dung. These beans sell {{for up to}} $1,100 a kilogram ($500 per lb), achieving the world's most expensive coffee some three times costlier than beans harvested from the dung of <b>Asian</b> <b>palm</b> <b>civets.</b>|$|R
50|$|Kopi Luwak is {{traditionally}} {{made from the}} faeces of wild civets, however, due to it becoming a trendy drink, civets are being increasingly captured from the wild and fed coffee beans to mass-produce this blend. Many of these civets are housed in battery cage systems which have been criticised on animal welfare grounds. The impact of the demand for this fashionable coffee on wild <b>palm</b> <b>civet</b> populations is yet unknown but may constitute a significant threat. In Indonesia, the demand for <b>Asian</b> <b>palm</b> <b>civets</b> {{appears to be in}} violation of the quota set for pets.|$|R
50|$|In {{some parts}} of its range <b>Asian</b> <b>palm</b> <b>civets</b> are hunted for bush meat and the pet trade. In {{southern}} China it is extensively hunted and trapped.

50|$|Chitwan is {{considered}} to have the highest population density of sloth bears with an estimated 200 to 250 individuals. Smooth-coated otters inhabit the numerous creeks and rivulets. Bengal foxes, spotted linsangs and honey badgers roam the jungle for prey. Striped hyenas prevail on the southern slopes of the Churia Hills. During a camera trapping survey in 2011, wild dogs were recorded in the southern and western parts of the park, as well as golden jackals, fishing cats, jungle cats, leopard cats, large and small Indian <b>civets,</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>palm</b> <b>civets,</b> crab-eating mongooses and yellow-throated martens.|$|R
50|$|<b>Asian</b> <b>palm</b> <b>civets</b> are omnivores {{utilizing}} fruits such as {{berries and}} pulpy fruits {{as a major}} food source, and thus help to maintain tropical forest ecosystems via seed dispersal. They eat chiku, mango, rambutan and coffee, but also small mammals and insects. Ecologically, they fill a similar niche in Asia as common raccoons in North America. They {{play an important role}} in the natural regeneration of Pinanga kuhlii and P. zavana palms at Gunung Gede Pangrango National Park. They also feed on palm flower sap, which when fermented becomes toddy, a sweet liquor. Because of this habit, they are called the toddy cat.|$|R

50|$|The {{widespread}} {{reporting of}} claims by Kolesnokov and Filatov caused controversy in many Chinese internet discussion boards and chat rooms.

Circumstantial evidence suggests that the SARS virus crossed over to humans from <b>Asian</b> <b>palm</b> <b>civets</b> ("civet cats"), a type of animal that is often killed and eaten in Guangdong, where SARS was first discovered. However, civet cats are extensively used in food production without causing SARS in their handlers.|$|R

50|$|Prey {{specimens}} {{found at}} the eagle's nest have ranged in size from a small bat weighing 10 g to a Philippine deer weighing 14 kg. The primary prey varies from island to island depending on species availability, particularly in Luzon and Mindanao, because the islands are in different faunal regions. For example, the tree squirrel-sized Philippine flying lemurs, the preferred prey in Mindanao, are absent in Luzon. The primary prey for the eagles seen in Luzon are monkeys, birds, flying foxes, giant cloud-rats Phloeomys pallidus which can weigh {{twice as much as}} flying lemurs at 2 to 2.5 kg, and reptiles such as large snakes and lizards. The flying lemur could make up an estimated 90% of the raptor's diet in some locations. While the eagles generally seem to prefer flying lemurs where available, most other animals found in the Philippines, short of adult ungulates and humans, may be taken as prey. This can include <b>Asian</b> <b>palm</b> <b>civets</b> (12% of the diet in Mindanao), macaques, flying squirrels, tree squirrels, fruit bats, rats, birds (owls and hornbills), reptiles (snakes and monitor lizards), and even other birds of prey. They have been reported to capture young pigs and small dogs.|$|R
