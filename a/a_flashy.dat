5|$|Nonetheless, Ripken {{demonstrated}} {{the ability to}} play excellent defense at shortstop, {{and as a result}} remained a fixture there for well over a decade, leading the league in assists several times, winning the Gold Glove twice, and, in 1990, setting the MLB record for best fielding percentage in a season at his position. Though not <b>a</b> <b>flashy</b> fielder, Ripken displayed excellent fundamentals, and studied batters and even his own pitching staff so he could position himself to compensate for his lack of physical speed. Ripken's legacy as a fielder is reflected by his place near the top of almost every defensive statistical category—he holds at least one all-time record (for either season, career, or most seasons leading the league) in assists, putouts, fielding percentage, double plays, and fewest errors. Ripken's career range factor was 4.73 (and as high as 5.50 for a single season), a mark few shortstops have reached.|$|E

500|$|By 1944, Patton {{had been}} {{established}} as a highly effective and successful leader, noted {{for his ability to}} inspire his men with charismatic speeches, which he delivered from memory because of a lifelong trouble with reading.

500|$|Between 1685 and 1785 this Chapman Horse/Andalusian/Barb cross {{developed}} into the original Cleveland Bay. During this century the type grew bigger due to better feeding, and by 1785 had developed through selective breeding into the [...] "agricultural type" [...] Cleveland Bay. This original type was heavier and more draft-like than the breed of today. This {{was due to}} a need for strength more than speed on the farms and poor roads of 17th- and 18th-century England. As roads improved and speed became {{more important in the}} late 18th century, Thoroughbred and Arabian blood was added. The resulting horses were used extensively as coach horses, and were lighter of frame, with a well-arched neck and powerful shoulders, making for <b>a</b> <b>flashy</b> carriage horse. The Thoroughbred blood was added despite the claims of breeders that the Cleveland Bay was [...] "free from taint of black or blood", meaning either Thoroughbred [...] "blood" [...] or the Old English [...] "Black" [...] and its descendents.
