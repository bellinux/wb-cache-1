5|$|Brock had a {{successful}} pre-war military career <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> rise through the ranks, which many commented on at the time. Some credited luck and others skill in his rapid promotions, and Brock had substantial portions of both {{on his way to}} prominence. Lacking special political connections, Brock's ability to gain promotions even when the nation was at peace attests to his skills in recruiting men and organizing finances, and ambition.|$|E
5|$|Hazel: The protagonist, Fiver's brother; {{he leads}} the rabbits from Sandleford and {{eventually}} becomes Chief Rabbit. Though Hazel is not particularly large or powerful, he is loyal, brave, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> thinker. He sees the good in each individual, and what they bring to the table; in so doing, he makes sure that no one gets left behind, thus earning the respect and loyalty of his warren. He often relies on Fiver's advice, and trusts in his brother's instincts immensely.|$|E

5|$|In {{individual}} Olympic competition, Heath won {{a silver}} medal in the 200-meter freestyle (1:49.10) behind Gross's world record-setting performance (1:47.44). He also placed fourth in the 100-meter freestyle event final (50.41); the outcome was controversial, however, because of a premature starter gun <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> start by Gaines, the winner. Gaines' coach, Richard Quick, knew of starter Frank Silvestri's propensity to fire the starter gun almost immediately when the swimmers mounted the blocks. Gaines gained about a meter's head start on the competition; video of the event later confirmed that {{one or more of}} the swimmers had not been set when the starter gun fired.|$|E

5|$|Pennsylvania Route378 (PA378) is a north-to-south road in Lehigh and Northampton counties. The {{southern}} terminus is at PA309 in Center Valley. Its northern terminus is at U.S. Route22 (US22) in Bethlehem. The route heads {{north from}} PA309 as a two-lane undivided road through Upper Saucon Township and Lower Saucon Township before crossing South Mountain {{into the city}} of Bethlehem. Here, PA378 follows city streets through Bethlehem's South Side, intersecting the northern terminus of PA412. The route crosses the Lehigh River and becomes a four-lane freeway that continues north to US22. PA378 is the only highway from US22 to Center City Bethlehem, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> route for visitors traveling to the Sands Casino Resort on the city's South Side.|$|E

5|$|This {{assessment}} was left unchanged for decades, as few players {{at the highest}} level used the Budapest Gambit and information about games from lesser players could not easily be found. During that time, various responses were developed against the 4.Bf4 line; these included 4...g5, invented by István Abonyi, further developed by the masters Bakonyi and Drimer. The master Kaposztas showed that even when White succeeded in his positional plan, it only meant for Black a worse endgame with drawish tendencies. Two pawn sacrifices were also introduced in the variation with 6.Nbd2 (still in the 4.Bf4 line), based on pawn pushes d7–d6 or f7–f6 <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> attack against b2.|$|E
5|$|Although a {{commercial}} and critical success, the play closed after 31 performances when Barrymore collapsed, suffering a nervous breakdown. Since appearing in Redemption {{he had worked}} ceaselessly, appearing on stage in the evenings, while planning or rehearsing the next production during the day, {{and by the time}} he appeared as Richard, he was spending his daytimes filming Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. He spent six weeks recuperating under the ministrations of his father's friend, wrestler William Muldoon, who ran a sanitarium. During the summer of 1920, Oelrichs became pregnant with Barrymore's child, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> divorce was arranged with her husband, which left her and Barrymore free to marry in August that year; a daughter, Diana Barrymore, followed in March 1921. Soon after the birth, he began rehearsals for Clair de Lune, which his wife had adapted from Victor Hugo's 1869 novel The Man Who Laughs. Barrymore persuaded Ethel to play the role of the Queen– it was the first time the two had appeared on stage together in over a decade. The play was a critical flop, although the presence of the siblings ensured that it ran for over 60 performances.|$|E
5|$|In sparing the lives, the French {{are awarded}} by God with the {{collapse}} of a bridge that leads to many of the English soldiers drowning <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> victory. The English, after losing Tourelles, fall back to the coast to await for reinforcements. Word comes that the Burgundian troops are coming to help the English. Joan meets with the Duke of Burgundy to warn him against a battle before she returns to her men to help bury the dead. Talbot's son comes with reinforcements from England, and the English army attacks the French at Patay. During the battle, Joan is able to kill the son and Conrade is able to kill the father. This causes the English to flee and, in turn, allows the French to retake Rheims. Once Rheims is free, Charles comes and is crowned the King of France. The story ends with Joan telling him to be a good king.|$|E

Christina {{falls in love with}} Paul and after a short romance <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> engagement, the couple marry. Shortly after, Christina becomes {{pregnant}} and gives birth to a son, Andrew (Shannon Holmes). Paul suffers a nervous breakdown and cheats on Christina with Caroline. The couple eventually reunite and they leave to manage a branch of Lassiter's in Hawaii. Paul later returns to the street where he gets his brother-in-law, Philip Martin (Ian Rawlings), involved in a fraud scandal. Paul then flees to Brazil and asks Christina to join him. He returns for Helen's birthday, but the celebration is ruined when he is forced to flee the country on fraud charges. Paul returns to Australia after the death of Helen and is sentenced to seven years' imprisonment, of which he serves three.|$|E
5|$|The track {{had been}} patched up {{prior to the}} weekend's racing using a {{synthetic}} rubber compound, and it had remained secure throughout the practice and qualifying sessions, {{as well as the}} Grand-Am and Indy Lights races. However, the Dallara DW12's aerodynamic ground force effects acted to pull the compound out. After assessing the track conditions, {{the decision was made to}} attempt to repair the track and restart the race. Marshalls and track workers started to pull the loose strips up from the track, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> drying concrete was used to fill the troughs. The repairs were held up for a short time when a crew was despatched to collect more of the concrete, as the on-site resources had been used up, but eventually the race director was happy the race could restart. Kanaan and Power drove around to survey the repairs, acting as driver representatives, and although Kanaan particularly did not sound confident that they would hold up, they agreed to try and continue racing. There was some confusion about the rules of the restart; no repairs were allowed, and the teams could change tires, but had to remain on the same compound. This led to J.R. Hildebrand suffering a one lap penalty as his car required repair work, and a number of drivers being angered at having to stay on the harder tires, which were the slower compound.|$|E

25|$|While {{the fall}} of Lae was clearly {{a victory for the}} Allies, and it was {{achieved}} more quickly and at lower cost than anticipated, a significant proportion of the Japanese garrison had escaped through the Saruwaged Range, to the north of Lae, and would have to be fought again elsewhere. The Huon Peninsula campaign was the result, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> follow up landing was subsequently undertaken at Scarlet Beach by the 20th Brigade.|$|E
