5|$|Despite having <b>an</b> <b>offense</b> <b>that</b> {{featured}} star {{running back}} Shaun Alexander, Alabama's offensive strategy revolved around a passing offense {{more than a}} running one. During the regular season, Alabama passed for 2,435 yards but only ran for 1,272 yards. The Crimson Tide averaged 22.9 points per game, 116 rushing yards per game, and 221.4 passing yards per game.|$|E

5|$|Auburn {{head coach}} Tommy Tuberville {{was named the}} Associated Press Coach of the Year on December 24, {{due in large part}} to his success in using Auburn's new West Coast offense to drive the Tigers to an undefeated 12–0 regular season. In {{response}} to his success, Auburn administrators agreed to a seven-year, $16million contract extension with Tuberville prior to the Sugar Bowl. Tuberville planned <b>an</b> <b>offense</b> <b>that</b> finished the regular season averaging 33.4points and 430.8yards of total offense per game.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech quarterback Marcus Vick was {{predicted}} {{to be the}} key player for the favored Virginia Tech Hokies in pregame discussion. Vick had led the Hokies to a fifth place national ranking and <b>an</b> <b>offense</b> <b>that</b> earned 610rushing yards in the final two games of the regular season. Off the field, the matchup between head coaches also was a point of interest. At the time, Florida State head coach Bobby Bowden had the most wins of any active head coach in college football, while Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer was ranked third. Beamer had never defeated Bowden in a game. Before the game, Beamer was named the ACC's 2005 Coach of the Year for the second consecutive year.|$|E
5|$|Scalia {{maintained}} that every element of <b>an</b> <b>offense</b> <b>that</b> helps determine the sentence must be either admitted by the defendant or found {{by a jury}} under the Sixth Amendment's jury guarantee. In the 2000 case of Apprendi v. New Jersey, Scalia wrote the Court's majority opinion that struck down a state statute that allowed the trial judge to increase the sentence if the judge found the offense was a hate crime. Scalia found the procedure impermissible because {{whether it was a}} hate crime had not been decided by the jury. In 2004, he wrote for the Court in Blakely v. Washington, striking down Washington state's sentencing guidelines on similar grounds. The dissenters in Blakely foresaw that Scalia would use the case to attack the federal sentencing guidelines (which he had failed to strike down in Mistretta), and they proved correct, as Scalia led a five-member majority in United States v. Booker, which made those guidelines no longer mandatory for federal judges to follow (they remained advisory).|$|E

5|$|The second NFC North game of {{the season}} took place in Detroit, when the Bears played the winless Lions. Although the Bears led the all-time series 96–69–5, the Lions had won the last four meetings. The Bears' {{offensive}} players had success against Detroit in the past: in 12 career games against the Lions, Jay Cutler threw for 2,669 yards, 17 touchdowns, seven interceptions and an 89.9 passer rating, while Matt Forte (in 14 games) had 1,066 rushing yards, six rushing touchdowns and four touchdown receptions, his most against any opponent. A potential weakness that Forte and the Bears rushing attack could exploit was the Lions' run defense; with the departures of defensive linemen Ndamukong Suh and Nick Fairley, the run defense, which had allowed a league-low 69.3 rushing yards per game in 2014, regressed in 2015, allowing 126.6 yards per game (ranked 27th in the league). The Lions pass defense also suffered during the season: the Lions allowed quarterbacks to complete 78 percent of passes and a league-high combined 128.7 passer rating, while also allowing the second-most plays of 20 yards or more, with 25. To take advantage of this, the Bears saw the returns of Alshon Jeffery, Eddie Royal and Martellus Bennett from injuries. As for the Bears defense, they faced <b>an</b> <b>offense</b> <b>that</b> recorded 4.9 yards per play, ranked 29th in the NFL. Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford had also struggled, having an average of 6.2 yards per pass, the worst in his six-year career, and had been benched in the Lions' week five game against Arizona. Detroit running backs also struggled, averaging only 2.8 yards per carry. As a whole, the Lions offense led the league in turnovers with 15. On special teams, the Lions led the league in kickoff returns of at least 20 yards, with running back Ameer Abdullah leading the NFL in the same category with nine. Terrence Mitchell, Antrel Rolle, runningback Antone Smith, linebacker Shea McClellin, tackle Nick Becton, Jermon Bushrod and nose tackle Bruce Gaston were inactive.|$|E

25|$|The 1950 {{season was}} one of major change for the Browns, with seven rookies on the roster and 12 new players overall.

Two of the new players – Ford and Cole – were African-Americans, joining Willis, Motley and Horace Gillom to bring {{the number of black}} players on the team to five. With the additions, the Browns employed about a third of all the black players in the NFL at the time.|$|E

The 2006 Warriors returned nine starters from <b>an</b> <b>offense</b> <b>that</b> ranked No. 11 in the nation in total offense while the defense returned six players from a unit that was ranked No. 102 in the nation under defensive coordinator Jerry Glanville.

The return of Chuck Knox as head coach, after Knox's {{successful}} stints as head coach of the Buffalo Bills and Seattle Seahawks, would not boost the Rams' fortunes. His run-oriented offense marked the end of the Zampese tenure in 1993. Knox' game plans called for <b>an</b> <b>offense</b> <b>that</b> would be steady, if unspectacular. Unfortunately for the Rams, Knox's offense was not only aesthetically unpleasing but dull as well, especially by 1990s standards. The Rams finished last in the NFC West during all three years of Knox' second stint, and were never a serious contender during this time.|$|E

25|$|After winning {{all of its}} preseason games, Cleveland {{prepared}} to face the defending champion Philadelphia Eagles to open the regular season. The victory over the Bears, who finished {{near the top of}} the NFL's Western Conference in 1949, appeared to prove that the team could compete in the new league, but Eagles coach Greasy Neale did not take the Browns seriously. Led by <b>an</b> <b>offense</b> <b>that</b> featured Graham, Motley and Lavelli, all of whom were later inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the Browns beat the Eagles in Philadelphia and went on to finish the regular season with a 10–2 record for first place in the league's American Division. Their losses both came against the New York Giants.|$|E
25|$|Kaplan’s own view, {{adopted by}} the GNYBA and {{subsequently}} by the American Contract Bridge League’s National Laws Commission, was that if a player takes an action {{that could have been}} influenced by unauthorized information, that action constitutes an offense, but not <b>an</b> <b>offense</b> <b>that</b> should necessarily be regarded as cheating. Instead, the incident should be handled as a procedural matter – much as accidentally exposing a card is treated as a technical violation, not as an attempt to cheat. In this way, bridge is able to apply sanctions such as score adjustment when a player allows himself to be inadvertently and subconsciously influenced by, say, his partner’s hesitation. It isn’t necessary to go to the extreme of accusing the player of deliberate cheating.|$|E
25|$|An {{opportunity}} to {{return them to}} Japan appeared when the American trader Charles W. King offered to take them back to Japan, again {{with the hope of}} establishing trade relations with the country. In July 1837, the seven castaways left with Charles W. King on board the Morrison to Uraga at the entrance of Edo Bay. There the ship was fired on repeatedly, and King was not able to accomplish his objective to establish diplomatic contact. He then went to Kagoshima, but again met with cannon fire, and finally decided to abandon his efforts and go back to Canton. The castaways resigned themselves to a life in exile. Returning to Japan was problematic, for this was during Japan's period of isolation when leaving the country was <b>an</b> <b>offense</b> <b>that</b> was punishable by death.|$|E
