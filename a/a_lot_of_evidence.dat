Changes in neurohumoral factors especially activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) {{play a key role in}} the pathogenesis of the cardiovascular continuum. The first drugs that block RAAS were ACE inhibitors. Lisinopril deserves special attention among the ACE inhibitors. Lisinopril — one of the most known and well-studied drugs in this group with proven organoprotective properties. This allows its use in various clinical situations. Lisinopril is used for hypertension treatment long ago and there are <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidences</b> <b>of</b> its high antihypertensive efficacy currently.

500|$|When {{co-owner}} Smith died in July 1950, O'Malley {{convinced his}} widow {{to turn over}} control of the shares to the Brooklyn Trust Company, which O'Malley controlled as chief legal counsel. Rickey's contract as general manager was set to expire on October 28, 1950. Rickey's Dodgers stock was held on margin and he had fully levered life insurance policy. O'Malley lowballed Rickey with an offer of $346,000 (the purchase price). Rickey demanded $1 million ($ today). O'Malley eventually pursued a complicated buyout of Rickey, who had received an outside offer from William Zeckendorf of $1million for his interests. [...] There were varying accounts about the sincerity of the offer because Zeckendorf and Pittsburgh Pirates owner John Galbreath were fraternity brothers, but there is <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> that he had a sincere interest in acquiring the team. The outside offer triggered a clause in the partnership agreement whereby the asking price of a [...] had to be matched if a current owner wanted to retain control and the third party would be compensated $50,000. The canceled $50,000 check would later include Rickey's signature showing that Zeckendorf turned over the $50,000 to Rickey.|$|E

In this study we demonstrate that Citrus bergamia juice extracts (BJe) reduces CRC cell growth by multiple mechanisms. Low BJe concentrations inhibit MAPKs pathway and alter apoptosis-related proteins, that in turn induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HT- 29 cells. Instead, high concentrations of BJe induce oxidative stress causing DNA damage. Our study highlights the role of BJe as modulator of cell apoptosis in CRC cells and strengthens our previous hypothesis that the flavonoid fraction of bergamot juice may play a role as anti-cancer drug...|$|R

Naringenin (Nar) down-regulated EMT markers expression in both mRNA and protein levels by inhibiting TGF-b 1 / Smad 3 signal pathway in the pancreatic cancer cells. Consequently, Nar suppressed the cells migration and invasion and reversed their resistance to Gem...|$|R

Conversely, the main theories developed till now, prototypes theory and exemplars theory, are unable to fully explain the experimental findings about the “phenomenon of typicality”. The classifier algorithm, introduced here, is characterized by an adaptive concepts description based on intermediate abstracted items varying from prototypes to exemplars {{and so it is}} able to subsume prototypes and exemplars theories.

This paper challenges the prevailing understanding of natural resources as a precursor of armed conflict and an obstacle to peace and political stability. This is achieved through a comparative case study between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Ghana, testing resource curse theory from Paul Collier and Philippe Le Billon‟s hypothesis. We come to find that resource curse leads to intra-state conflicts under certain circumstances, basically the colonial influence, geographic characteristics of the country, the stability in its governance, and its relationship with neighborin...|$|R
