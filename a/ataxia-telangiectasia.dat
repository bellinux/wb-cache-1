25|$|<b>Ataxia-telangiectasia</b> like {{disorder}} (ATLD) is {{an extremely}} rare condition, caused by mutation in the hMre11 gene, {{that could be considered}} in the differential diagnosis of A-T. Patients with ATLD are very similar to those with A-T in showing a progressive cerebellar ataxia, hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation and genomic instability. Those rare individuals with ATLD who are well described differ from those with A-T by the absence of telangiectasia, normal immunoglobulin levels, a later onset, and a slower progression of the symptoms. Because of its rarity, it is not yet known whether or not ATLD carries an increased risk to develop cancer. Because those mutations of Mre11 that severely impair the MRE11 protein are incompatible with life, individuals with ATLD all have some partial function of the Mre11 protein, and hence likely all have their own levels of disease severity.|$|E

50|$|Ataxia {{may depend}} on {{hereditary}} disorders consisting of degeneration of the cerebellum and/or of the spine; most cases feature both to some extent, and therefore present with overlapping cerebellar and sensory ataxia, even though one is often more evident than the other. Hereditary disorders causing ataxia include autosomal dominant ones such as spinocerebellar ataxia, episodic ataxia, and dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy, as well as autosomal recessive disorders such as Friedreich's ataxia (sensory and cerebellar, with the former predominating) and Niemann Pick disease, <b>ataxia-telangiectasia</b> (sensory and cerebellar, with the latter predominating), and abetalipoproteinaemia.

5000|$|Several human syndromes are {{associated}} with dysfunctional NHEJ. [...] Hypomorphic mutations in LIG4 and XLF cause LIG4 syndrome and XLF-SCID, respectively. These syndromes share many features including cellular radiosensitivity, microcephaly and severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) due to defective V(D)J recombination. Loss-of-function mutations in Artemis also cause SCID, but these patients do not show the neurological defects associated with LIG4 or XLF mutations. The difference in severity {{may be explained by}} the roles of the mutated proteins. Artemis is a nuclease and is thought to be required only for repair of DSBs with damaged ends, whereas DNA Ligase IV and XLF are required for all NHEJ events. Mutations in genes that participate in non-homologous end joining lead to <b>ataxia-telangiectasia</b> (ATM gene), Fanconi anemia (multiple genes), as well as hereditary breast and ovarian cancers (BRCA1 gene).|$|E

50|$|Mutations in the ATM gene cause <b>ataxia-telangiectasia.</b> The ATM gene {{provides}} {{instructions for}} making a protein that helps control cell division and is involved in DNA repair.

The ATM protein assists cells in recognizing damaged or broken DNA strands and coordinates DNA repair by activating enzymes that fix the broken strands. Efficient repair of damaged DNA strands helps maintain the stability of the cell's genetic information. Affected children typically develop difficulty walking, problems with balance and hand coordination, involuntary jerking movements (chorea), muscle twitches (myoclonus), and disturbances in nerve function (neuropathy). The movement problems typically cause people to require wheelchair assistance by adolescence. People with this disorder also have slurred speech and trouble moving their eyes to look side-to-side (oculomotor apraxia).|$|E

50|$|This gene encodes a DNA topoisomerase, {{an enzyme}} that {{controls}} and alters the topologic states of DNA during transcription. This nuclear enzyme {{is involved in}} processes such as chromosome condensation, chromatid separation, and the relief of torsional stress that occurs during DNA transcription and replication. It catalyzes the transient breaking and rejoining of two strands of duplex DNA which allows the strands to pass through one another, thus altering the topology of DNA. Two forms of this enzyme exist as likely products of a gene duplication event. The gene encoding this form, beta, is localized to chromosome 3 and the alpha form is localized to chromosome 17. The gene encoding this enzyme functions as the target for several anticancer agents, for example mitoxantrone, {{and a variety of}} mutations in this gene have been associated with the development of drug resistance. Reduced activity of this enzyme may also play a role in <b>ataxia-telangiectasia.</b> Alternative splicing of this gene results in two transcript variants; however, the second variant has not yet been fully described.|$|E
5000|$|Of about 200 {{neurological}} and neuromuscular disorders, 15 {{have a clear}} link to {{an inherited}} or acquired defect {{in one of the}} DNA repair pathways or excessive genotoxic oxidative stress. [...] Five of them (xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne's syndrome, trichothiodystrophy, Down's syndrome, and triple-A syndrome) have a defect in the DNA nucleotide excision repair pathway. Six (spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy-1, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Down's syndrome and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) seem to result from increased oxidative stress, and the inability of the base excision repair pathway to handle the damage to DNA that this causes. Four of them (Huntington's disease, various spinocerebellar ataxias, Friedreich’s ataxia and myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2) often have an unusual expansion of repeat sequences in DNA, likely attributable to genome instability. Four (<b>ataxia-telangiectasia,</b> ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder, Nijmegen breakage syndrome and Alzheimer's disease) are defective in genes involved in repairing DNA double-strand breaks. Overall, it seems that oxidative stress is a major cause of genomic instability in the brain. A particular neurological disease arises when a pathway that normally prevents oxidative stress is deficient, or a DNA repair pathway that normally repairs damage caused by oxidative stress is deficient.|$|E
50|$|A {{potential}} {{mechanism for}} exon shuffling is the long interspersed element (LINE) -1 mediated 3' transduction. However {{it is important}} first to understand what LINEs are. LINEs are a group of genetic elements that are found in abundant quantities in eukaryotic genomes. LINE-1 {{is the most common}} LINE found in humans. It is transcribed by RNA polymerase II to give an mRNA that codes for two proteins: ORF1 and ORF2, which are necessary for transposition. Upon transposition, L1 associates with 3' flanking DNA and carries the non-L1 sequence to a new genomic location. This new location {{does not have to be}} in a homologous sequence or in close proximity to the donor DNA sequence. The donor DNA sequence remains unchanged throughout this process because it functions in a copy-paste manner via RNA intermediates; however, only those regions located in the 3' region of the L1 have been proven to be targeted for duplication. Nevertheless, there is reason to believe that this may not hold true every time as shown by the following example. The human ATM gene is responsible for the human autosomal-recessive disorder <b>ataxia-telangiectasia</b> and is located on chromosome 11. However, a partial ATM sequence is found in chromosome 7. Molecular features suggest that this duplication was mediated by L1 retrotransposition: the derived sequence was flanked by 15bp target side duplications (TSD), the sequence around the 5' end matched with the consensus sequence for L1 endonuclease cleavage site and a poly(A) tail preceded the 3' TSD. But since the L1 element was present in neither the retrotransposed segment nor the original sequence the mobilization of the segment cannot be explained by 3' transduction. Additional information has led to the belief that trans-mobilization of the DNA sequence is another mechanism of L1 to shuffle exons, but more research on the subject must be done.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background <b>Ataxia-Telangiectasia</b> {{syndrome}} {{is characterized by}} progressive cerebellar dysfunction, conjuctival and cutaneous telangiectasias, severe immune deficiencies, premature aging and predisposition to cancer. Clinical and radiographic evaluation for malignancy in <b>ataxia-telangiectasia</b> patients is usually atypical, leading to delays in diagnosis. Case presentation We report {{the case of a}} 20 year old <b>ataxia-telangiectasia</b> patient with gastric adenocarcinoma that presented as complete gastric outlet obstruction. Conclusion A literature search of adenocarcinoma associated with <b>ataxia-telangiectasia</b> revealed 6 cases. All patients presented with non-specific gastrointestinal complaints suggestive of ulcer disease. Although there was no correlation between immunoglobulin levels and development of gastric adenocarcinoma, the presence of chronic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia seem to lead to the development of gastric adenocarcinoma. One should consider adenocarcinoma in any patient with <b>ataxia-telangiectasia</b> who presents with non-specific gastrointestinal complaints, since this can lead to earlier diagnosis. </p...|$|E
