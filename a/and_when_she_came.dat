500|$|The role of Martha Kent was {{originally}} given to Cynthia Ettinger, but during filming everyone, including Ettinger, {{realized that she}} was not right for the role. O'Toole was committed to the television series The Huntress when Ettinger was filming her scenes for the pilot. Around the time the creators were looking to recast the role of Martha Kent The Huntress was canceled, which allowed O'Toole the chance to join the cast of Smallville. Coincidentally, the actress had previously portrayed Lana Lang in Superman III. O'Toole thinks that the producers wanted someone older for the role of Martha, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>came</b> in to talk to the producers everyone appeared {{to be on the same}} page with what the character and the show should be about. O'Toole characterizes Martha as really intelligent, but believes the character has to hide her intelligence at times [...] "to keep the peace".|$|E

After her husband died Barbara was destitute and went to live with her son. After she in turn died in 1514, her son wrote [...] "This my pious Mother... often had the plague and many other severe and strange illnesses, and she suffered great poverty, scorn, contempt, mocking words, terrors, and great adversities.

500|$|While {{writing and}} {{recording}} for her debut album, Stefani cited her major influences as Club Nouveau, Lisa Lisa, Prince, New Order, The Cure and early Madonna and advised the producers and writers {{that she wanted}} a similar sound for the album. According to MTV's Jennifer Vineyard, musician and songwriter Linda Perry [...] "put Gwen in a headlock" [...] during a party after the Grammys and told her they could make beautiful music together"; however, Stefani felt scared and insecure about working with Perry. While recording at Perry's house, Stefani was initially insecure about her writing process and [...] "would go into another room to try to write some lyrics, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>came</b> back, Perry would already have the whole song nailed." [...] After a writing session where [...] "What You Waiting For?" [...] was created, Stefani became less insecure and felt more comfortable when making songs.
