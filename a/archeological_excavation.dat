5|$|The site {{on which}} the SIS {{building}} stands had been {{the location of the}} Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens in the 19th century. Several industrial buildings were subsequently built on the site after the demolition of the pleasure gardens in the 1850s, including a glass factory, a vinegar works and a gin distillery. <b>Archeological</b> <b>excavation</b> of the site during building found the remains of seventeenth century glass kilns, as well as barge houses and an inn called The Vine. Evidence was also found for a river wall on the site.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} dolmens {{scattered}} around the area. These dolmens are generally considered to have been tombs; however, the acidic soil of Brittany has eroded away the bones. They were constructed with several large stones supporting a capstone, then buried under a mound of earth. In many cases, the mound is no longer present, sometimes due to <b>archeological</b> <b>excavation,</b> and only the large stones remain, {{in various states of}} ruin.|$|E

25|$|Mona Island is {{believed}} to have been originally settled by Arawak Indians who arrived from Quisqueya (Hispaniola: present day Haiti and the Dominican Republic). An <b>archeological</b> <b>excavation</b> during the 1980s discovered many Pre-Columbian objects on the island that helped support historians' theories of the island's first inhabitants. Stone tools found in a rock shelter have been dated to around 3000 BC. Much later the island was settled by the Taínos and remained so until the arrival of the Spanish in the 15th century.|$|E
25|$|Nearby is {{the site}} of the {{original}} Lincoln cabin; the sandstone foundation clearly outlines the boundary of the house and is visible to visitors. Discovered through a professional <b>archeological</b> <b>excavation,</b> it is now preserved and protected by a wall. A very short distance from the original cabin site stands the replica farm house. Park rangers in full period clothing work the 1820s-style farm, making it a living history site. Visitors can talk with them, take classes and learn more about the many activities and items at the farm. The Living Historical Farm is open seasonally, from mid-spring to early fall; it cultivates crops, raises livestock, and uses and displays historic farm implements.|$|E

25|$|In October 1999, the Islamic Waqf, and the Islamic Movement {{conducted}} an illegal dig which inflicted much archaeological damage. The earth from this operation, which has archeological wealth relevant to Jewish, Christian and Muslim history, was removed by heavy machinery and unceremoniously dumped by trucks into the nearby Kidron Valley. Although the archeological finds {{in the earth}} are already not in situ, this soil still contains great archeological potential. No <b>archeological</b> <b>excavation</b> was ever conducted on the Temple Mount, and this soil was the only archeological information that has ever been available to anyone. For this reason Israeli archaeologists Dr. Gabriel Barkay and Zachi Zweig established a project sifting all the earth in this dump: the Temple Mount Sifting Project.|$|E
25|$|In the Hungarian {{village of}} Csengele, on {{the borders of}} what is still called Kiskunsag ("Little Cumania"), an <b>archeological</b> <b>excavation</b> in 1975 {{revealed}} {{the ruins of a}} medieval church with 38 burials. Several burials had all the characteristics of a Cumanian group: richly jeweled, non-Hungarian, and definitely Cumanian-type costumes; the 12-spiked mace as a weapon; bone girdles; and associated pig bones. In view of the cultural objects and the historical data, the archeologists concluded that the burials were indeed Cumanian from the mid-13th century; hence some of the early settlers in Hungary were from that ethnic group. In 1999 the grave of a high-status Cumanian from the same period was discovered about 50 meters from the church of Csengele; this was the first anthropologically authenticated grave of a Cumanian chieftain in Hungary, and the contents are consistent with the ethnic identity of the excavated remains from the church burials. A separated area of the chieftain grave contained a complete skeleton of a horse.|$|E
25|$|The Department of Britain, Europe and Prehistory was {{established}} in 1969 and is responsible for collections that cover a vast expanse of time and geography. It includes {{some of the earliest}} objects made by humans in east Africa over 2 million years ago, as well as Prehistoric and neolithic objects {{from other parts of the}} world; and the art and archaeology of Europe from the earliest times to the present day. <b>Archeological</b> <b>excavation</b> of prehistoric material took off and expanded considerably in the twentieth century and the department now has literally millions of objects from the Paleolithic and Mesolithic periods throughout the world, as well as from the Neolithic, Bronze Age and Iron age in Europe. Stone Age material from Africa has been donated by famous archaeologists such as Louis and Mary Leakey, and Gertrude Caton–Thompson. Paleolithic objects from the Sturge, Christy and Lartet collections include some of the earliest works of art from Europe. Many Bronze Age objects from across Europe were added during the nineteenth century, often from large collections built up by excavators and scholars such as Greenwell in Britain, Tobin and Cooke in Ireland, Lukis and de la Grancière in Brittany, Worsaae in Denmark, Siret at El Argar in Spain, and Klemm and Edelmann in Germany. A representative selection of Iron Age artefacts from Hallstatt were acquired as a result of the Evans/Lubbock excavations and from Giubiasco in Ticino through the Swiss National Museum.|$|E

500|$|Forensic archaeologists employ their {{knowledge}} of proper excavation techniques to ensure that remains are recovered in a controlled and forensically acceptable manner. When remains are found partially or completely buried the proper excavation of the remains will ensure that any evidence present on the bones will remain intact. [...] The difference between forensic archaeologists and forensic anthropologists is that where forensic anthropologists are trained specifically in human osteology and recovery of human remains, forensic archaeologists specialize more broadly in the processes of search and discovery. In addition to remains, archaeologists are trained to look for objects contained {{in and around the}} excavation area. These objects can include anything from wedding rings to potentially probative evidence such as cigarette butts or shoe prints. [...] Their training extends further to observing context, association and significance of objects in a crime scene and drawing conclusions that may be useful for locating a victim or suspect. A forensic archaeologist must also be able to utilize a degree of creativity and adaptability during times when crime scenes can not be excavated using traditional archaeological techniques. For example, one particular case study was conducted on the search and recovery of the remains of a missing girl who was found in a septic tank underground. This instance required unique methods unlike those of a typical <b>archeological</b> <b>excavation</b> in order to exhume and preserve the contents of the tank.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the better}} known and most {{controversial}} assertions Morey made about Islam is that God in Islam is in origin the [...] "moon god" [...] Hubal, a deity worshipped at the Kaaba in pre-Islamic Arabia." [...] Morey argues that the same name of God of Islam, Arabic Allah, was an epithet of Hubal's in pre-Islamic Mecca. He also cites a 1950s era <b>archeological</b> <b>excavation</b> in Hazor, Israel, in what was ancient Galilee, in which a decapitated male statue was unearthed which some archaeologists thought might be Hubal. Morley claims that this provides that moon worship existed in Arabia. He argues that Muhammad adapted it to create Allah, thus supposedly explaining the use of crescent moon imagery in Islam.

2500|$|The {{earliest}} known maps to {{have survived}} in China date to the 4th century BC. In 1986, seven ancient Chinese maps were found in an <b>archeological</b> <b>excavation</b> of a Qin State tomb {{in what is now}} Fangmatan, in the vicinity of Tianshui City, Gansu province. Before this find, the earliest extant maps that were known came from the Mawangdui Han tomb excavation in 1973, which found three maps on silk dated to the 2nd century BC in the early [...] Han Dynasty. The 4th century BC maps from the State of Qin were drawn with black ink on wooden blocks. These blocks fortunately survived in soaking conditions due to underground water that had seeped into the tomb; the quality of the wood {{had much to do with}} their survival. After two years of slow-drying techniques, the maps were fully restored.|$|E
