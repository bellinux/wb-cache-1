40|$|The IL- 1 {{cytokine}} {{network in}} epidermal cells was studied in vitro, using the spontaneously transformed HaCAT human keratinocyte line. Intracellular (ic) IL- 1 alpha and IL- 1 receptor antagonist protein (IL- 1 Ra) following cell lysis were readily identified assayed using a capture ELISA; whereas in culture supernatants IL- 1 Ra was not detected, and IL- 1 alpha {{was present at}} only very low levels. Confluent cultures of HaCAT cells were shown to provide optimal conditions for the study, since confluence increased the icIL- 1 Ra:IL- 1 <b>alpha</b> <b>ratio</b> to a level as seen in vivo, which was independent of Ca 2 + concentration in the culture medium. The IL- 1 Ra extracted from HaCAT cell lysates was functionally active, as demonstrated in the mouse thymocyte co-proliferation assay which could be blocked using a rabbit anti-IL- 1 Ra antibody. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta 1) stimulated a dose-dependent increase in HaCAT cell IL- 1 alpha without changing IL- 1 Ra concentration, with a resultant reduction in the icIL- 1 Ra: IL- 1 <b>alpha</b> <b>ratio</b> from 320 : 1 to 100 : 1. Similarly, TGF-alpha, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), IL- 6, and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) substantially increased HaCAT cell IL- 1 alpha, but {{had no effect on}} the IL- 1 Ra, with a concomitant reduction in the icIL- 1 Ra:IL- 1 <b>alpha</b> <b>ratio.</b> In contrast to their effects on monocytes, IL- 4 and IL- 10 at biologically active levels had no effect on IL- 1 alpha, IL- 1 Ra or the icIL- 1 Ra: IL- 1 <b>alpha</b> <b>ratio</b> in confluent HaCAT cells. Hydrocortisone reduced IL- 1 alpha to below the limit of sensitivity of the ELISA, and induced a small increase in IL- 1 Ra of questionable biological significance. Thus, regulation of the IL- 1 cytokine network in keratinocytes involves modulation of icIL- 1 alpha rather than of icIL- 1 Ra levels, and is markedly different from that noted in monocytes...|$|E
40|$|Researchers {{have shown}} that photoionization by the {{continuum}} of the hidden Seyfert I nucleus in NGC 1068 can {{have a significant effect}} on the ionization state and energetics of this disk's Interstellar Medium (ISM). Photoionization models with appropriate power law spectra can produce (NII) lambda lambda 6538, 6584 /H alpha line ratios of 1. 25 for ionization parameters Q approx. 10 (exp - 12). However the data indicate large regions where the (NII) /H <b>alpha</b> <b>ratio</b> is 1 to 3. Since the abundances are known to be solar, there must be additional heating sources.

40|$|Acoustic and Perceptual Characteristics of a Shouting Voice This study {{investigated}} the acoustic and perceptual characteristics of a shouting voice. A total of 35 males (24 actor students, 11 other students) shouted a short monolog (an excerpt of Shakespeare‘s King Lear) in a studio. Their lowest possible tone (produced in soft voice, vocal fry excluded) was also measured. The recorded shouting samples were analyzed for mean fundamental frequency (F 0), equivalent sound level (Leq), difference between the average Leq of the 1 – 5 kHz region and the average Leq of the 50 Hz– 1 kHz region (‘alpha ratio’), loudness (in sones) and difference between the average level of the F 1 region and the average level of the F 0 region (L 1 -L 0). Long-term average spectra (LTAS) were made. The relative F 0 (difference between the lowest possible F 0 and the mean F 0 in shouting, measured in semitones) was also calculated. Nine listeners, trained in vocology, evaluated the samples for voice quality, timbre, perceived pitch, perceived loudness, firmness of phonation (along the axis from breathy to pressed), degree of turbulence noise, and roughness. Reliability between the listeners’ evaluations was good (Cronbach’s alpha 0, 80 - 0, 94). Acoustic features of the shouting voice seemed to be high Leq, relatively high F 0 and high <b>alpha</b> <b>ratio.</b> LTAS analyses demonstrated increased acoustic energy in the higher part of the spectrum, but several different LTAS patterns emerged. According to the listeners’ evaluations voices had lots of roughness and noise. The shouting voices also {{had a tendency to}} pressed voice quality. The actor students had higher Leq and <b>alpha</b> <b>ratio</b> and lower F 0 than the others. The voices of the actor students’ were also evaluated to have better voice quality and greater loudness than the other voices. Lack of hypertension, perceived noise and roughness correlated with voice quality. <b>Alpha</b> <b>ratio,</b> firmness, Leq and F 0 seemed {{to be related to the}} degree of perceived loudness. The main characteristics in good shouting voice, thus, seemed to be lack of perceived noise, lack of roughness, high <b>alpha</b> <b>ratio,</b> high Leq and appropriate firmness. These characteristics imply vocal efficiency and phonation balance. No specific spectral correlates of good shouting voice were identified.

A total of 11 male actors and 10 male nonactors volunteered as subjects, reading an extended text sample in habitual, moderate, and loud levels. {{the samples were}} analyzed for sound pressure level (SPL), <b>alpha</b> <b>ratio</b> (difference between the average SPL of the 1 - 5 kHz region and the average SPL of the 50 Hz- 1 kHz region), fundamental frequency (F 0), and long-term average spectrum (LTAS). Through LTAS, the mean frequency of the first formant (171) range, the mean frequency of the actor's formant, the level differences between the F 1 frequency region and the F 0 region (L 1 -L 0), and the level differences between the strongest peak at 0 - 1 kHz and that at 3 - 4 kHz were measured. Eight voice specialists evaluated perceptually the degree of projection, loudness, and tension in the samples. the actors had a greater <b>alpha</b> <b>ratio,</b> stronger level of the actor's formant range, and {{a higher degree of}} perceived projection and loudness in all loudness levels. SPL, however, did not differ significantly between the actors and nonactors, and no differences were found in the mean formant frequencies ranges. the <b>alpha</b> <b>ratio</b> and the relative level of the actor's formant range seemed {{to be related to the}} degree of perceived loudness. From the physiological point of view, a more favorable glottal setting' providing a higher glottal closing speed, may be characteristic of these actors' projected voices. So, the projected voices, in this group of actors, were more related to the glottic source than to the resonance of the vocal tract.

40|$|Many {{different}} {{hub assembly}} procedures have been utilized {{over the years}} in bascule bridge construction. The first assembly procedure (AP 1) involves shrink fitting a trunnion component into a hub, followed by the shrink fitting of the entire trunnion-hub (TH) assembly into the girder of the bridge. The second assembly procedure (AP 2) involves shrink fitting the hub component first into the girder, then shrink fitting the trunnion component into the hub-girder (HG) assembly. The final assembly procedure uses a warm shrink fitting process whereby induction coils are placed on the girder of the bridge and heat is applied until sufficient thermal expansion of the girder hole allows for insertion of the hub component. All three assembly procedures use a cooling method at some stage of the assembly procedure to contract components to allow the insertion of one part into the next Occasionally, during these cooling and heating procedures, cracks can develop in the material due to the large thermal shock and subsequent thermal stresses. Previous works conducted a formal design of experiments analysis on AP 1 to determine the overall effect of various factors on the critical design parameters, overall minimum stress ratio (OMSR) and overall minimum critical crack length (OMCCL). This work focuses on conducting a formal design of experiments analysis on AP 1, AP 2 and AP 3 using the same cooling methods and parameters as in previous studies with the addition of the bridge size as a factor in the experiment. The use of the medium bridge size in AP 1 yields the largest OMCCL values of any bridge and the second largest OMSR values. The large bridge size has the largest OMSR values versus all factors for AP 1. The OMCCL and OMSR increases for every bridge size with an increase in the <b>alpha</b> <b>ratio</b> for AP 1.

40|$|A {{modified}} ELISA assay for {{measurement of}} the two estrogen metabolites 2 -hydroxyestrone (2 OHE 1) and 16 alpha-hydroxyestrone (16 alpha OHE 1) in plasma and serum has been developed. Previously, these have only been measured in urine. It is not known how well the measurements of these metabolites in urine and plasma are correlated. The goal {{of this study was}} to compare urinary and plasma levels of 2 OHE 1 and 16 alpha OHE 1 and their ratios and to explore how they were affected by ethnicity, dietary and genetic factors, and medication use. Blood and urine samples were obtained from 511 nulliparous women, aged 17 - 35, from four ethnic groups during the same visit at the study center, on a random day of the menstrual cycle. The overall correlation between the 2 OHE 1 / 16 <b>alpha</b> OHE 1 <b>ratio</b> in plasma and urine was fair (r(s) = 0. 52; p < 0. 0001). In general, the correlation between the 2 OHE 1 / 16 <b>alpha</b> OHE 1 <b>ratio</b> in urine and plasma was higher among women not using oral contraceptives (OCs) (r(s) = 0. 58; p < 0. 0001) than among women currently using OCs (r(s) = 0. 34; p < 0. 0001). The correlation was highest for samples obtained during the mid-cycle in among non-OC users (r(s) = 0. 83; p < 0. 0001). Among non-OC users, the urinary 2 OHE 1 / 160 <b>alpha</b> OHE 1 <b>ratio</b> was stable over the menstrual cycle while there was an increase in the plasma 2 OHE 1 / 16 <b>alpha</b> OHE 1 <b>ratio.</b> The strongest factors predicting discordance between the urinary and plasma 2 OHE 1 / 16 <b>alpha</b> OHE 1 <b>ratios</b> among non-OC users were a baseline urinary 20 HE 1 / 16 <b>alpha</b> OHE 1 <b>ratio</b> in the three upper quartiles (p < 0. 001), the menstrual cycle phase (p = 0. 001), and the number of cups of coffee consumed per day (p = 0. 006). Among current OC users, the strongest predictors of discordance between the urinary and plasma 2 OHE 1 / 16 <b>alpha</b> OHE 1 <b>ratios</b> were a baseline urinary 2 IHE 1 / 16 <b>alpha</b> OHE 1 <b>ratio</b> in the three lower quartiles (p < 0. 001), being black (p = 0. 001), and being Asian (p = 0. 014).

40|$|Summary: Objectives. Signiﬁcant {{changes in}} body tissues occur during pregnancy; however, {{literature}} concerning {{the effects of}} pregnancy on the voice is sparse, especially concerning the professional classically trained voice. Hypotheses. Hormonal variations and associated bodily changes during pregnancy affect phonatory conditions, such as vocal fold motility and glottal adduction. Design. Longitudinal case study with a semiprofessional classically trained singer. Methods. Audio, electrolaryngograph, oral pressure, and air ﬂow signals were recorded once a week during the last 12 weeks of pregnancy, 48 hours after birth and during the following consecutive 11 weeks. Vocal tasks included diminuendo sequences of the syllable /pae/ sung at various pitches, and performing a Lied. Phonation threshold pressures (PTPs) and collision threshold pressures (CTPs), normalized amplitude quotient (NAQ), <b>alpha</b> <b>ratio,</b> and {{the dominance of the}} voice source fundamental were determined. Concentrations of sex female steroid hormones were measured on three occasions. A listening test of timbral brightness and vocal fatigue was carried out. Results. Results demonstrated signiﬁcantly elevated concentrations of estrogen and progesterone during pregnancy, which were considerably reduced after birth. During pregnancy, CTPs and PTPs were high; and NAQ, <b>alpha</b> <b>ratio,</b> and dominance of the voice source fundamental suggested elevated glottal adduction. In addition, a perceptible decrease of vocal brightness was noted. Conclusions. The elevated CTPs and PTPs during pregnancy suggest reduced vocal fold motility and increased glottal adduction.

To date, similar phenomena have not been described in the voices of actresses. Therefore, the objective of the current investigation was to compare actresses' and nonactresses' voices through acoustic analysis to verify the existence of the AF cluster or the strategies used to produce the performing voice. Thirty actresses and 30 nonactresses volunteered as subjects in the present study. All subjects read a 40 -second text at both habitual and loud levels. Praat (v. 5. 1) was then used to analyze equivalent sound pressure level (Leq), speaking fundamental frequency (SFF), and in the long-term average spectrum window, the difference between the amplitude level of the fundamental frequency and first formant (L 1 - L 0), the spectral tilt (<b>alpha</b> <b>ratio),</b> and the amplitude and frequency of the AF region.

The observed [O (II) ]/H <b>alpha</b> <b>ratio</b> increases significantly from 0. 40 +/- 0. 01 at z = 0. 1 to 0. 52 +/- 0. 05 at z = 1. 47, which we attribute to either decreasing dust attenuation with redshift, or due to a bias in the (typically) fibre measurements in the local Universe that only measure the central kpc regions. At the bright end, we find that both the H alpha and Ly alpha number densities at z approximate to 2. 2 deviate significantly from a Schechter form, following a power law. We show that this is driven entirely by an increasing X-ray/active galactic nucleus fraction with line luminosity, which reaches approximate to 100 per cent at line luminosities L greater than or similar to 3 x 10 (44) erg s(- 1) ...|$|E
40|$|Theme: Care of the Professional VoiceSpeech-Language Pathology Session 2 A: {{abstract}} no. SLP 50 INTRODUCTION: The {{acoustic features}} of supranormal (better-than-normal) vocal performers e. g. actors and singers are well-documented (e. g. Barrichelo et al, 2001; Bele, 2006). Measures such as <b>alpha</b> <b>ratio,</b> speaker’s/singer’s formant and fundamental frequency have been useful in quantifying these voices and differentiating them from non-performing controls. Radio professionals are a subgroup of supranormal vocal performers. This pilot {{study will explore}} the acoustic differences between radio performers and non-performing controls. METHOD: Male radio performers (n= 15, mean age= 36 yrs including announcers, voice-over artists and newsreaders) and matched male controls with no history of voice disorder or professional vocal performance (n= 15, mean age= 36 yrs) participated as pilot groups. Participants were recorded reading a standard passage in two conditions: 1) as if in conversation outside the sound booth (habitual) and 2) as if presenting on the radio (performance). Cepstral Peak Prominence (CPP) (Hillenbrand & Houde, 1996) and <b>Alpha</b> <b>Ratio</b> (AR) (Sundberg & Nordenberg, 2006) were calculated for each voice sample. Factorial group x condition ANOVAS were conducted for CPP and AR. RESULTS: There were no significant interactions between group and condition for CPP or AR and no main group effects for both measures. There was {{a main effect for}} condition (p= 0. 021, p= 0. 002) seen for both measures across both groups. DISCUSSION: There were no differences between voices of radio performers and controls for CPP and AR. Differences between conditions may be due to a practice effect. These results contrast with our preliminary auditory-perceptual analysis and other previous studies (Medrado et al, 2005) where voices of radio performers were easily identified from controls. Continued data collection/analysis will examine specific characteristics of radio performer sub-types e. g. voice-over artists vs newsreaders as well as measures of Long Term Average Spectrum, fundamental frequency and detailed perceptual analysis...|$|E
40|$|In the {{framework}} of studies concerning new fuel cycles and nuclear wastes incineration experimental data of the <b>alpha</b> <b>ratio</b> between capture and fission cross sections of 233 U(n,f) reactions {{play an important role}} in the Th/U cycle. The safety evaluation and the detailed performance assessment for the new generation IV nuclear energy system projects strongly depend on this rapport. Since the current data are scarce and sometimes contradictory new experimental studies are required. The measurement will take place at the neutron time-of-flight facility GELINA at Geel, designed to perform neutron cross section measurements with high resolution for the incident neutron energy. A dedicated high efficiency fission ionization chamber (IC) as a fission fragment detector and six C 6 D 6 liquid scintilators are used. The method, based on the IC energy response study, allowing to distinguish between gammas originating from fission and capture in the resonance region, will be presented...|$|E

40|$|Understanding the {{interaction}} between a fluid and a solid phase is of fundamental importance {{to the design of}} an adsorption process. Because the heat effects associated with adsorption are comparatively large, the assumption of isothermal behavior is a valid approximation only when uptake rates are relatively slow. In this article, we propose to determine when it is needed to choose the isothermal or non-isothermal assumption according to two physical parameters <b>alpha</b> (<b>ratio</b> convection/capacity) and beta(quantity of energy/capacity). The proposed problem is solved by a mathematical method in the Laplace domain. When alpha-> infinite (infinitely high heat transfer coefficient) or beta-> 0 (infinitely large heat capacity), the limiting case is isothermal. When the diffusion is rapid (alpha< 10) the kinetics of sorption is controlled entirely by heat transfer. If the adsorption process is {{to be used as a}} heat pump, it shall be represented by an isotherm model with alpha and beta as high as possible...|$|E
40|$|The PGE 2 /PGF 2 alpha balance, {{controlled}} {{in part by}} prostaglandin- 9 -ketoreductase, {{seems to}} be involved in the regulation of sodium excretion by the kidney. A decreased PGE 2 /PGF 2 <b>alpha</b> <b>ratio</b> has been observed in the urine of hypertensive subjects. This suggests that an alteration of prostaglandin metabolism might be involved in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension. In order to test this hypothesis, prostaglandin- 9 -ketoreductase (PG- 9 -KR) and prostaglandin- 15 -dehydrogenase (PG- 15 -DH) activities were measured in erythrocytes of normotensive controls and patients with essential hypertension. The two enzyme activities were highly correlated in the two groups, supporting the hypothesis that they are alternate expressions of a single enzyme. These two enzyme activities were not significantly different in hypertensive subjects as compared to controls. Human essential hypertension does not appear to be linked to a generalized defect of prostaglandin catabolic enzymes. Comparative StudyJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S.

40|$|Along {{the normal}} aging process, voice tends to become weak, breathy, and loses projection, which may {{interfere}} in the communication process. One reliable way to evaluate voice quality is through acoustical analysis using, for instance, the long-term average spectrum (LTAS). {{the aim of}} this study was to identify acoustic measures, particularly LTAS's, which characterize vocal aging in women without vocal complaints. for this purpose, 30 elderly and 30 young women were included in this study. All spoke standard Portuguese and none had a history of vocal and laryngeal alterations or respiratory diseases. On the basis of the reading task, in habitual and loud levels, the following parameters were assessed: the equivalent sound level (L-eq), the speaking fundamental frequency (SFF) and, at the LTAS window, the difference between the levels of the regions of the first formant and fundamental frequency F- 0 (L- 1 - L- 0), <b>alpha</b> <b>ratio,</b> and the amplitude levels obtained at equal intervals of 160 Hz, ranging from 0 to 8 kHz. There were significant differences between young and old voices for SFF and Leg in both levels. in the LTAS window, amplitude levels were higher for young voices, comprising all frequencies except those in the regions between 4. 6 - 6. 7 and 4. 8 - 6. 5 kHz, in habitual and loud levels, respectively. There were also significant differences regarding L- 1 - L- 0 and <b>alpha</b> <b>ratio</b> between groups, in both levels. the observed differences in LTAS's slopes, L- 1 - L- 0 measures, and even L-eq and SFF measures, may be attributed, to some extent, to lower subglottal pressure or a glottal setting providing a slower glottal closing speed for the elderly group.

Here, we report a microscopically based magnetic model for this compound derived from density functional theory (DFT) based electronic structure calculations along with respective tight-binding models. Our (LSDA+U-d) calculations confirm the quasi-one-dimensional {{nature of the}} system with antiferromagnetic J(1) and J(2), but suggest a significantly larger frustration ratio alpha(DFT) approximate to 0. 94 - 1. 4, depending on the choice of U-d and structural parameters.

John of God, Fatebenefratelli, Brescia, Italy Background: An increased electroencephalographic (EEG) upper/lower <b>alpha</b> power <b>ratio</b> {{has been associated with}} less regional blood perfusion, atrophy of the temporoparietal region of the brain, and reduction of hippocampal volume in subjects affected by mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer’s disease as compared with subjects who do not develop the disease. Moreover, EEG theta frequency activity is quite different in these groups. This study investigated the correlation between biomarkers and memory performance. Methods: EEG α 3 /α 2 power ratio and cortical thickness were computed in 74 adult subjects with prodromal Alzheimer’s disease. Twenty of these subjects also underwent assessment of blood perfusion by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Pearson’s r was used to assess the correlation between cortical thinning, brain perfusion, and memory impairment. Results: In the higher α 3 /α 2 frequency power ratio group, greater cortical atrophy and lower regional perfusion in the temporoparietal cortex was correlated with an increase in EEG theta frequency. Memory impairment was more pronounced in the magnetic resonance imaging group and SPECT groups. Conclusion: A high EEG upper/low <b>alpha</b> power <b>ratio</b> was associated with cortical thinning and less perfusion in the temporoparietal area. Moreover, atrophy and less regional perfusion were significantly correlated with memory impairment in subjects with prodromal Alzheimer’s disease. The EEG upper/lower <b>alpha</b> frequency power <b>ratio</b> could be useful for identifying individuals at risk for progression to Alzheimer’s dementia and may be of value in the clinical context.
