The heart of the design is on the microcontroller. The ground probes require high voltage and this is generated from a 12 volt battery using a 555 timer arranged as an <b>a-stable</b> <b>multivibrator.</b> The use of a battery is to make the device usable even at remote places where electrical power is not available. A suggested code in assemble language for the microcontroller is given as guide. However a high level language can also be implemented, to achieve the same results. The use of the microcontroller (Âµprocessor) makes it feasible to produce a device that is cost effective for both urban and rural dwellers. The main activity of this design is centred {{on the development of the}} code (software program), {{design of a}} special power supply and the interfacing external hardware for the detector...|$|E
