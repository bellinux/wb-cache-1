When Canavan received <b>a</b> <b>tempting</b> job offer from the Pennsylvania Hospital for the Insane, in his capacity with the Massachusetts Commission on Mental Diseases, Southard petitioned the board to create a position for her as his assistant, and her salary was enough for her to refuse the Pennsylvania offer.|$|E
5|$|Egypt's wealth, however, made it <b>a</b> <b>tempting</b> {{target for}} invasion, {{particularly}} by the Libyan Berbers to the west, and the Sea Peoples, a conjectured confederation of seafarers from the Aegean Sea. Initially, {{the military was}} able to repel these invasions, but Egypt eventually lost control of its remaining territories in southern Canaan, much of it falling to the Assyrians. The effects of external threats were exacerbated by internal problems such as corruption, tomb robbery, and civil unrest. After regaining their power, the high priests at the temple of Amun in Thebes accumulated vast tracts of land and wealth, and their expanded power splintered the country during the Third Intermediate Period.|$|E

Holmes coached minor-league teams after his retirement, notably the Toronto Millionaires of the Canadian Professional Hockey League (CPHL) and the Cleveland Indians of the International Hockey League (IHL). Holmes died on June 27, 1941, near Fort Lauderdale, Florida and was inducted posthumously into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1972.|$|E

5|$|The English Channel was contested militarily between England and France {{during the}} 13th century, and Southampton was both an {{important}} base for naval operations and <b>a</b> <b>tempting</b> target for raiders. At {{the start of}} the 13th century additional work was therefore conducted to improve the town's defences; the king granted £100 in 1202 and again in 1203 to help develop the earth banks around the town. By 1217 East Gate had been built, probably of stone. In 1260 a murage grant was given to Southampton by Edward I, allowing the town to tax selected imports to build and maintain new stone walls; these initial murage grants ran from 1260 to 1275 and were then renewed between 1282 and 1285 and from 1286 to 1291. By the end of this work, many of the earth banks in the north and east of the town had been converted to stone. There appears to have been little interest in defending the west and south quays, however, probably because doing so would have hampered Southampton's merchants when they moved their trading goods {{in and out of the}} town.|$|E
5|$|The {{large and}} wealthy island of Cyprus {{had been under}} Venetian rule since 1489. Together with Crete, {{it was one of}} the major {{overseas}} possessions of the Republic, with a population estimated at 160,000 in the mid-16th century. Aside from its location, which allowed the control of the Levantine trade, the island possessed a profitable production of cotton and sugar. To safeguard their most distant colony, the Venetians paid an annual tribute of 8,000 ducats to the Mamluk Sultans of Egypt, and after their conquest by the Ottomans in 1517, the agreement was renewed with the Ottoman Porte. Nevertheless, the island's strategic location in the Eastern Mediterranean, between the Ottoman heartland of Anatolia and the newly acquired provinces of the Levant and Egypt, made it <b>a</b> <b>tempting</b> target for future Ottoman expansion. In addition, the protection offered by the local Venetian authorities to corsairs who harassed Ottoman shipping, including Muslim pilgrims to Mecca, rankled with the Ottoman leadership.|$|E

25|$|The {{specific}} reason Lee {{chose this}} risky strategy of splitting his army to capture Harpers Ferry is not known. One {{possibility is that}} he knew it commanded his supply lines through the Shenandoah Valley. Before he entered Maryland he had assumed that the Federal garrisons at Winchester, Martinsburg, and Harpers Ferry would be cut off and abandoned without firing a shot (and, in fact, both Winchester and Martinsburg were evacuated). Another possibility {{is that it was}} simply <b>a</b> <b>tempting</b> target with many vital supplies but virtually indefensible. McClellan requested permission from Washington to evacuate Harpers Ferry and attach its garrison to his army, but his request was refused.|$|E
25|$|Settlement in {{the area}} after the English ejected the Dutch was slow. The Swedes and Finns who had settled {{in the area}} {{from the days of}} New Sweden had {{generally}} welcomed the English and were allowed to stay; the few Dutch found in the area were rounded up as prisoners and sent to Virginia as slaves. Lord Baltimore encouraged Marylanders to move east to settle the area. But the land was far removed from other, more established settlements and did not appeal to many new settlers. It was <b>a</b> <b>tempting</b> wilderness base for pirates to hide out from authorities and regularly pillage settlers for supplies.|$|E
25|$|Lee divided his army. Longstreet {{was sent}} to Hagerstown, while Jackson was ordered to seize the Union arsenal at Harpers Ferry, which {{commanded}} Lee's supply lines through the Shenandoah Valley; it was also <b>a</b> <b>tempting</b> target, virtually indefensible. McClellan requested permission from Washington to evacuate Harpers Ferry and attach its garrison to his army, but his request was refused. In the Battle of Harpers Ferry, Jackson placed artillery on the heights overlooking the town, forcing the surrender of the garrison of more than 12,000 men on September 15. Jackson led most of his soldiers to join the rest of Lee's army, leaving A.P. Hill's division to complete the occupation of the town.|$|E

25|$|The {{location}} of the NDCBU in a community or business center is extremely important, since neighborhood cluster box installations located in remote or poorly lighted areas invite large-scale mail theft or vandalism. Even when located in a high-traffic location or inside a gated community, the NDCBU is <b>a</b> <b>tempting</b> target for thieves attracted {{by the possibility of}} recovering checks, cash, identifying information, or other valuables from multiple victims. A 2008 RAND Corporation study, citing USPS statistics collected between 2004 and 2007, found that NDCBU thefts constituted 52.7% of all urban neighborhood mail thefts and 76.6% of all rural neighborhood mail thefts from locations with more than one mailbox, with higher-income ZIP code zones having a substantially higher number of thefts than low-income ZIP code zones.|$|E
25|$|For Governor Trott, {{this proved}} <b>a</b> <b>tempting</b> offer. The Nine Years' War had been raging for eight years, and the island, which the Royal Navy had not visited in several years, was perilously underpopulated. Trott {{knew that the}} French had {{recently}} captured Exuma, 140 miles to the southeast, and were now headed for New Providence. With only sixty or seventy men living in the town, half of whom served guard duty at any one time, there was no practical way to keep Fort Nassau's twenty-eight cannons fully manned. However, if the Fancy's crew stayed in Nassau it would {{more than double the}} island's male population, while the very presence of the Fancy in the harbor might deter a French attack. On the other hand, turning away Captain Bridgeman might spell disaster if his intentions turned violent, as his crew of 113 (plus ninety slaves) would easily defeat the island's inhabitants. Lastly, there was also the bribe to consider, which was three times Trott's annual salary of £300.|$|E
25|$|With {{the fall}} of Irun and then San Sebastián, on September 23, 1936, the Nationalists under Franco pushed their way through Gipuzkoa, cutting off the Republican {{controlled}} areas in northern Spain from the border with France. This area had been already isolated {{from the rest of}} Spain by Nationalist control {{at the beginning of the}} war. This area was very attractive to the Nationalists because of the industrial production of Biscay and the mineral resources of Asturias. To conquer and control this area would be profitable through its valuable resources, would expel Republican forces and concentrate large numbers of Nationalist troops to dictate a two-front war. Franco realized that Madrid, the capital, was not going to be conquered quickly. Basque resources of iron, coal, steel and chemicals were <b>a</b> <b>tempting</b> target. The Republican north was also politically divided and weakened by struggles between Basque nationalists and leftists. Furthermore, its major supplies came by sea. Franco ordered his commanders on the Madrid front to go on the defensive and send all available resources to the north.|$|E

25|$|In April 2007, astronomers {{announced}} that the Swedish-built Odin satellite had made the first detection of clouds of molecular oxygen in space, following observations in the constellation Ophiuchus. The supernova of 1604 was first observed on 9 October 1604, near θ Ophiuchi. Johannes Kepler saw it first on 16 October and studied it so extensively that the supernova was subsequently called Kepler's Supernova. He published his findings in a book titled De stella nova in pede Serpentarii (On the New Star in Ophiuchus' Foot). Galileo used its brief appearance to counter the Aristotelian dogma that the heavens are changeless. In 2009 it was {{announced that}} GJ 1214, a star in Ophiuchus, undergoes repeated, cyclical dimming with a period of about 1.5 days consistent with the transit of a small orbiting planet. The planet's low density (about 40% that of Earth) suggests that the planet may have a substantial component of low-density gas—possibly hydrogen or steam. The proximity of this star to Earth (42 light years) makes it <b>a</b> <b>tempting</b> target for further observations. In April 2010, the naked-eye star ζ Ophiuchi was occulted by the asteroid 824 Anastasia.|$|E

He was invited to become a Liberal candidate two more times; once in 1931 for Torquay and once in 1932 for North Cornwall. The second was <b>a</b> <b>tempting</b> offer; the seat had become vacant on the death of its previous holder, a National Liberal with a comfortable majority, and it was felt that Birkett was almost certain to be returned to Parliament.

[...] This production and shipping could be disrupted by gunboats moving up the Black, the Pee Dee, the Waccamaw, and the Sampit rivers, which flow into the bay; and the two distributary channels of the Santee River, whose mouths lie just below the bay. [...] Curtailing rice production would not only damage the local economy, but would impair the Confederacy's ability to feed its armies.|$|E
500|$|Ark Royal spent April {{alternating}} between covering convoys and delivering aircraft to Malta and forays into the Atlantic to hunt commerce raiders. By May 1941, Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps were driving through North Africa towards the Suez Canal, pushing the Western Desert Force before them. With British forces close to collapse and strategic locations threatened, the British High Command risked sending a reinforcement convoy across the Mediterranean to Alexandria. The convoy consisted of five large transport ships, escorted by Ark Royal, the battlecruiser Renown, the battleship , the cruisers , , , and , and screened by destroyers of the 5th Destroyer Flotilla. Prior to Ark Royals departure, Captain Holland left to recuperate from stress and poor health, {{and was replaced}} by Captain Loben Maund.

[...] Varietys Peter Debruge was also critical, saying the film [...] "goes wonky {{on the way to the}} bank, due to its lackluster pacing and shortage of the qualities that typically earn stars Ben Stiller and Eddie Murphy their paychecks – namely, laughs." [...] Debruge felt that the opening 40 minutes were [...] "a dull blue-collar drama populated entirely by stereotypes," [...] and while the film [...] "picks up some much-needed momentum" [...] with the actual heist, the [...] "resolution feels rushed." [...] However, Debruge echoed praise for Murphy, calling his performance [...] "a welcome return to the comic's irreverent, '80s-era persona," [...] and lamenting his limited screen-time.|$|E
