In England after the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the final victory of parliamentarians over monarchists, and the arrival from Holland, with William III and Mary II, of the 'Dutch Elm' hybrid, planting of this cultivar became a fashion among enthusiasts of the new political order.

50|$|The main {{tree species}} in the Espy Bog include pin oak, silver maple, <b>American</b> <b>elm,</b> <b>white</b> pine, ash, and red maple. The shrub layer in the wetland complex {{consists}} of various species that are common in wetlands. These include poison sumac, buttonbush, smooth alder, silky dogwood, spicebush, willow, winterberry holly, and meadow-sweet. However, some introduced species have also been observed in the wetlands. These include buckthorn, common privet, Morrow's honeysuckle, and multiflora rose. The herbaceous layer contains several types of wetland fern as well as monkey flower, northern blue flag, marsh purslane, marsh St.-John's-wort, bulbiferous water hemlock, two tearthumb species, swamp milkweed, and skunk cabbage. Various sedges and grasses occur in meadow-like openings in the wetland complex, as does soft rush.|$|R

5000|$|The Washington Elm, Cambridge, Massachusetts. George Washington {{is said to}} {{have taken}} command of the American Continental Army under the Washington Elm in Cambridge on July 3, 1775. The tree survived until the 1920s and [...] "was thought to be a {{survivor}} of the primeval forest". In 1872, a large branch fell from it and was used to construct a pulpit for a nearby church. The tree, an <b>American</b> <b>white</b> <b>elm,</b> became a celebrated attraction, with its own plaque, a fence constructed around it and a road moved in order to help preserve it. The tree was cut down (or fell [...] - [...] sources differ) in October 1920 after an expert determined it was dead. The city of Cambridge had plans for it to be [...] "carefully cut up and a piece sent to each state of the country and to the District of Columbia and Alaska," [...] according to The Harvard Crimson. As late as the early 1930s, garden shops advertised that they had cuttings of the tree for sale, although the accuracy of the claims has been doubted. A Harvard [...] "professor of plant anatomy" [...] examined the tree rings days after the tree was felled and pronounced it between 204 and 210 years old, making it at most 62 years old when Washington took command of the troops at Cambridge. The tree would have been {{a little more than two}} feet in diameter (at 30 inches above ground) in 1773. In 1896, an alumnus of the University of Washington, obtained a rooted cutting of the Cambridge tree and sent it to Professor Edmund Meany at the university. The cutting was planted, cuttings were then taken from it, including one planted on February 18, 1932, the 200th anniversary of the birth of George Washington, for whom Washington state is named. That tree remains on the campus of the Washington State Capitol. Just to the west of the tree is a small elm from a cutting made in 1979.|$|E

40|$|European <b>White</b> <b>Elm</b> is {{recognized}} as a rare and endangered species in the forest fund of the Republic of Serbia. During the past century massive drying of elms occurred and the indications of their extinction appeared, which consequently led {{to a reduction in}} genetic diversity and the danger of genetic drift. In the area of the Great War Island near Belgrade we found 56 trees of European <b>White</b> <b>Elm</b> that are spatially divided into three subpopulations. In order to assess the genetic potential of European <b>White</b> <b>Elm</b> in the Great War Island and to define adequate conservation measures variability of 14 selected test trees progeny was rated.

40|$|Principles of the {{conservation}} of genetic resources of elms (Ulmus spp) do not differ fundamentally from the general principles accepted for {{the conservation}} of genetic resources of other common Noble Hardwoods. Efficient conservation can best be achieved through appropriate combination of in situ and ex situ methods, which have distinct advantages. Besides that, ex situ conservation is employed when emergency measures are needed for rare endangered populations and when populations are too small to be managed in situ (e. g. risks of genetic drift and inbreeding). The aim of our research is ex situ conservation of genetic resources of field elm {Ulmus minor Mill) and European <b>white</b> <b>elm</b> (Ulmus laevis Pall) through establishment of field genebanks. Sampling was conducted in one population of field elm and one population of <b>white</b> <b>elm.</b> Plant material (buds) from 8 trees of field elm and 10 trees of <b>white</b> <b>elm</b> was used for in vitro production of clones.
