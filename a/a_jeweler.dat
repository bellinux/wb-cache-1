5|$|With {{his father}} usually not home (and {{eventually}} meeting his death) {{because of a}} military career, Van Rensselaer's mother sent him to apprentice with his uncle, Wolfert van Bijler, <b>a</b> <b>jeweler</b> and diamond merchant. At the time, the gem trade was a prosperous enterprise to join, being a well-developed craft. In those days, the diamond trade was nearly always combined with the trade in pearls, other articles of luxury, and rarities of every description. Dutch jewelers found a ready market for their valuable wares at the Dutch imperial court and the smaller German courts. This realm of work promoted Van Rensselaer {{to a life of}} economic success.|$|E
5|$|Discharged {{from the}} army in 1863, Goebel's father moved his family to Covington, Kentucky. William {{attended}} school in Covington and was then apprenticed to <b>a</b> <b>jeweler</b> in Cincinnati, Ohio. After a brief time at Hollingsworth Business College, he became an apprentice in {{the law firm of}} John W. Stevenson, who had served as governor of Kentucky from 1871 to 1877. Goebel eventually became Stevenson's partner and executor of his estate. Goebel graduated from Cincinnati Law School in 1877, then enrolled at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, but withdrew to support his family on the death of his father. Goebel was in private practice for several years, before partnering with Kentucky state representative John G. Carlisle for five years. He then rejoined Stevenson in Covington as a partner.|$|E

25|$|In 1799, {{in nearby}} Cabarrus County, 12-year-old Conrad Reed found a 17-pound rock, which his family {{used as a}} doorstop. Three years later, <b>a</b> <b>jeweler</b> {{determined}} it was nearly solid gold, paying the family a paltry $3.50. The first documented gold find in the United States of any consequence set off the nation's first gold rush. Many veins of gold {{were found in the}} area throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, leading to the 1837 founding of the Charlotte Mint. North Carolina was the chief producer of gold in the United States until the Sierra Nevada find in 1848, although the volume mined in the Charlotte area was dwarfed by subsequent rushes.|$|E

25|$|In 1807, {{a skilled}} worker, such as <b>a</b> <b>jeweler,</b> perfumer, tailor or {{furniture}} maker, could earn 4-6 francs a day; a baker earned 8-12 francs a week; a stonemason earned 2-4 francs a day; an unskilled worker, such as construction laborer, earned 1.50 to 2.5 francs a day. Much {{of the work}} was seasonal; most construction work stopped during the winter. Women's salaries were lower; a worker in a tobacco factory earned one franc a day, while women making embroidery or seamstresses earned 50-60 centimes a day, government salaries in 1800 were fixed {{on a scale of}} 8000 francs a year for a chief of a division of a Ministry down to 2500 francs a year for a messenger.|$|E

When a creditor comes to claim the Orlacs' piano, Stephen throws a fountain pen that barely misses his head. Stephen seeks help from his stepfather, Henry Orlac (Ian Wolfe). Henry denies the request, upset that Stephen did not follow in his line of business as <b>a</b> <b>jeweler.</b> A knife thrown in anger by Stephen misses Henry, but breaks the shop front's window. Gogol meanwhile asks Yvonne for her love, but she refuses. Stephen goes to Gogol's home and demands to know about his hands, and why they throw knives. Gogol suggests that Stephen's problem comes from childhood trauma, but later confirms to his assistant Dr. Wong (Keye Luke) that Stephen's hands had been Rollo's.|$|E

His father was Hazi Dula Mia Shoudagar, <b>a</b> <b>jeweler,</b> and his mother was Sufia Khatun. His early {{childhood}} was spent in the village. In 1944, his family moved to the city of Chittagong, and he moved from his village school to Lamabazar Primary School. By 1949, his mother was afflicted with psychological illness. Later, he passed the matriculation examination from Chittagong Collegiate School ranking 16th of 39,000 students in East Pakistan. During his school years, he was an active Boy Scout, and traveled to West Pakistan and India in 1952, and to Canada in 1955 to attend Jamborees. Later while Yunus studied at Chittagong College, he became active in cultural activities and won awards for drama.

25|$|Holmes {{purchased}} {{an empty}} lot {{across from the}} drugstore, where construction began in 1887 for a two story mixed-use building, with apartments {{on the second floor}} and retail spaces, including a new drugstore, on the first. When Holmes declined to pay the architects or the steel company, Aetna Iron and Steel, they sued in 1888. In 1892, he added a third floor, telling investors and suppliers that he intended {{to use it as a}} hotel during the upcoming World's Columbian Exposition, though the hotel portion was never completed. Furniture suppliers found that Holmes was hiding their materials, for which he had never paid, in hidden rooms and passages throughout the building. Their search made the news, and investors for the planned hotel pulled out of the deal when <b>a</b> <b>jeweler</b> in the building showed them the articles. When the third floor caught fire on the night of August 13, 1893, only a few people were in the building, all employees and long term residents. Holmes had taken out insurance policies on the building with at least four companies, all of which promptly sued rather than pay.|$|E
25|$|Richard King (1824–1885) was a river pilot, born in New York City to Irish immigrants. He was indentured to <b>a</b> <b>jeweler</b> at age 11, {{but later}} ran to sea, {{eventually}} attaining a pilot's rating. In 1843, King first met his future business {{partner in the}} King Ranch, Mifflin Kenedy (1818–1895), captain of the steamboat Champion. Both served under General Zachary Taylor, operating steamboats from Brazos Santiago Harbor to Matamoros, and on up river to Camargo, Tamaulipas, {{in support of the}} U.S. invasion of Monterrey and Saltillo. After the Mexican War, King made a good living hauling merchandise on the Rio Grande, as far up river as Camargo, and Rio Grande City. In the meantime, Kenedy was able to make money by carrying goods overland into Mexico. By March 1, 1850, King, Kenedy, Charles Stillman, founder of Brownsville, and James O'Donnell entered into a business partnership (M. Kenedy & Co.) to transport Stillman's goods from Brazos Santiago Harbor on the Gulf of Mexico and up the Rio Grande. The enterprise required two types of steamers — the Grampus and Comanche. During the American Civil War, the steamboat fleet was reflagged under the name of the Matamoros, Mexico citizen Francisco Iturria and the Mexican flag. As Mexico was a neutral country, the steamboats could not be stopped by Union blockaders, and engaged in a lively commerce of transporting Texas cotton to many deep-water ships anchored offshore Matamoros, on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande. Stillman sold his share of the enterprise after the Civil War; the new firm operated as King, Kenedy & Co. until 1874.|$|E
500|$|The word detective did {{not exist}} at the time Poe wrote [...] "The Murders in the Rue Morgue", though there were other stories that {{featured}} similar problem-solving characters.

500|$|While early grills {{could not}} be removed easily and {{involved}} reshaping the tooth itself to fit the grill, grills are today made from custom dental molds. [...] For more expensive grills, a dentist takes a mold of the wearer's front teeth with a quick set alginate. [...] A tooth mold is obtained by filling the alginate negative with buff stone, then the buff stone is used to fit the grill to the unique set of teeth. [...] However, for inexpensive novelty grills, <b>a</b> <b>jeweler</b> may make an impression by having the wearer bite into dental putty or wax softened in water, or the wearer may do this himself. [...] Such grills may be less comfortable or dependable than grills that are professionally fitted, and in several instances jewelers manufacturing grills in this manner {{have been charged with}} practicing dentistry without a license.|$|E

500|$|In 1894, the [...] "blue pebbles" [...] were {{recognized}} as sapphires. [...] One story credits {{a local school}} teacher for recognizing the blue pebbles as sapphires. A variation is that the teacher lived in Maine, but {{was a friend of}} a local miner, who had mailed her a small box with some gold and a few [...] "blue pebbles" [...] in it. Another story credits a miner named S.S. Hobson for surmising that the blue stones might be sapphires, and his guess was confirmed by <b>a</b> <b>jeweler</b> in Helena. [...] Ultimately, in 1895, Jake Hoover sent a cigar box containing those he had collected while mining gold to an assay office, which in turn sent them via regular, uninsured mail to Tiffany's in New York City for appraisal by Dr. George Frederick Kunz, the leading American gemologist of the time. Impressed by their quality and color, Kunz pronounced them [...] "the finest precious gemstones ever found in the United States". Tiffany's sent Hoover a check for $3,750 (approximately $ as of [...] ), along with a letter that described the blue pebbles as [...] "sapphires of unusual quality".|$|E
