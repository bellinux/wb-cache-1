40|$|Accounts {{of mental}} content rooted in {{asymmetric}} dependence hold, crudely speaking, that {{the content of}} a mental representation {{is the cause of}} that representation on which all its other causes depend. 1 To speak somewhat less crudely, such accounts, hereafter “AD accounts”, hold 1) that (a) any nomic relations which obtain between, on the one hand, a mental representation and, on the other hand, various causes and possible causes of that representation which are not its content, are dependent on (b) a nomic relation between that representation and its content, but 2) that the latter nomic relation is not dependent on any of the former relations. This paper argues that <b>AD</b> <b>accounts</b> are false. There is more than one AD account; there are a range of possible accounts which share that general form. Yet all of those alternatives are false. The problem is a dilemma defined by reference to three axes of difference among possible <b>AD</b> <b>accounts.</b> Any position along the first axis requires a problematic position along one of the other two. First, <b>AD</b> <b>accounts</b> may deploy nomic relations which differ in scope, which apply for instance to all individuals or merely to particular individuals and hence have in that sense relatively wide or narrow scope. Second, <b>AD</b> <b>accounts</b> may deploy different conceptions {{of the nature of the}} syntax of mental representations. Third, <b>AD</b> <b>accounts</b> may deploy different accounts of the grounds of the nomic relations which bind that syntax to target contents. I will argue that <b>AD</b> <b>accounts</b> which deploy wide scope laws cannot fit with a reasonably plausible account of the nature of the syntax of mental representations, and that <b>AD</b> <b>accounts</b> which deploy narrow scope laws cannot fit with a reasonably plausible account of the grounds of the nomic relations which bind that syntax to target contents. 2 Section 1 is a brief exposition of <b>AD</b> <b>accounts</b> and of their motivation.

A selective review of the literature was conducted to summarize the current evidence from clinical studies to examine the role of vascular risk factors in prevention of dementia. Epidemiological evidence suggests that control of vascular risk factors may prevent, or at least delay, the onset of dementia. This finding is supported to some extent by randomized controlled trial evidence for treatment of hypertension but not for other risk factors. However, a number of methodological issues need addressing. There is a need for a randomized controlled trials (RCT) targeting multiple vascular risk factors in patients at increased risk of dementia; i. e., those with mild cognitive impairment.

40|$|Atopic dennatitis (AD) is a conUllon chronically {{relapsing}} {{skin disorder}} affecting 9 - 20 % of those born after 1970 [Schultz Larsen 1993]. TI,e aetiology {{is still not}} entirely elucidated and research {{is complicated by the}} multifactorial nature of the disease. Both genetical and environmental factors are involved in the pathogenesis of AD. The prevalence of atopic dennatitis seems to have increased along with astluna and allergic rhinitis during the past three decades [Williams 1992, Schultz Larsen 1996]. Several studies from different countries reported a two- to three-fold increase of the prevalence of AD over the past three decades. However, the reasons for this evolution of atopic diseases still remain to be elucidated. Furthennore, large, unexplained variations in prevalence have been reported between countries and within countries [ISAAC 1998], suggesting a critical role for environmental thctors in disease expression. Although some risk factors such as gender, parental smoking, and early exposure to allergens Olouse dust mite, pets, cow's milk and solid food) have becn identified, the role of other risk factors like socio-economic status, outdoor and indoor pollution and infections in early life are still a matter of discussion. Studies on the genetical and immunological background have provided new insights into the mechanisms involved in atopic diseases. However, therapeutical practice has not yet changed. Recently guidelines based on consensus have been established for the management of AD [Me Henry 1995]. Emphasis is put on educating and infonning the patients. Although these and other guidelines provide a good franlework for managing AD, the unpredictable course of the disease with exacerbations and remissions may fiustrate both patients and physicians [przybilla 1994]. Patients with <b>AD</b> <b>account</b> for about 30 % of demlatological consultations in general practice, and dennatological consultations account for about 20 % of all consultations in general practice [Rook 1986].

This is surprising when the impact of the two diseases is compared. In tenns of prevalence, AD is more conunon than asthma in Y 01 Ulg children [Peat 1994, Burr 1989]; in tenns of economic resources, the direct fimUlcial cost in the care of a child with moderate to severe AD is substantially higher than for the average child with asthma [Su 1997]; and in tenns of family impact - taking into account fmaneial burden, familial/social impact, personal strain and mastery - even in mild AD, the impact on fanlilies was found to be equivalent to that for children with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus [Su 1997]. Consequently AD should not be perceived as a minor skin disorder, but it should be recognised as a disease with considerable social, personal and fInancial burden...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is {{the most}} common form of dementia. The risk of AD {{increases}} with age. Although two of the main pathological features of AD, amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, were already recognized by Alois Alzheimer at the beginning of the 20 th century, the pathogenesis of the disease remains unsettled. Therapeutic approaches targeting plaques or tangles have not yet resulted in satisfactory improvements in AD treatment. This may, in part, be due to early-onset and late-onset AD pathogenesis being underpinned by different mechanisms. Most animal models of AD are generated from gene mutations involved in early onset familial <b>AD,</b> <b>accounting</b> for only 1 % of all cases, which may consequently complicate our understanding of AD mechanisms. In this article, the authors discuss the pathogenesis of AD according to the two main neuropathologies, including senescence-related mechanisms and possible treatments using stem cells, namely mesenchymal and neural stem cells...|$|R

Recent evidence suggests that the stress of dementia caregiving increases morbidity in CGs via its immunosuppressive effect that is mediated by ele-vated levels of cortisol (a biochemical marker of stress) most noticeable in the morning, the afternoon and the evening [6 - 8].

40|$|Currently, {{there are}} more than 30 million demen-tia {{patients}} worldwide (1). More than half ofdementia is caused by Alzheimer disease (AD),which consists of both familial and sporadic forms.
