5|$|Critics praised Undead Nightmare as a {{model for}} {{downloadable}} content especially in its balance of content and price. Neil Davey (The Guardian) said that it was the best purchase of 2010 at its price range, but staff of the Official Xbox Magazine found the price slightly too high. Henry Gilbert of GamesRadar thought that the game's concept sounded like a ploy to make easy money without much work, but admitted how wrong <b>and</b> <b>surprised</b> he was at the game's depth. At the time of its 2010 release, the Official Xbox Magazine counted Undead Nightmare among the best downloadable content in existence. The standalone retail disc had sold two million units as of August 2011. No sales figures were released regarding the download pack itself.|$|E
5|$|I am vexed <b>and</b> <b>surprised</b> at your not {{thinking}} {{the situation of}} Maria sufficiently important, and can only account for this want of – shall I say it? delicacy of feeling, by recollecting {{that you are a}} man – For my part I cannot suppose any situation more distressing than for a woman of sensibility with an improving mind to be bound, to such a man as I have described, for life – obliged to renounce all the humanizing affections, and to avoid cultivating her taste lest her perception of grace, and refinement of sentiment should sharpen to agony the pangs of disappointment.|$|E

40|$|Novelty <b>and</b> <b>surprise</b> play signi&# 64257;cant {{roles in}} animal {{behavior}} and {{in attempts to}} understand the neural mechanisms underlying it. They also play important roles in technology, where detecting observations that are novel or surprising is central to many applications, such as medical diagnosis, text processing, surveillance, and security. Theories of motivation, particularly of intrinsic motivation, place novelty <b>and</b> <b>surprise</b> among the primary factors that arouse interest, motivate exploratory or avoidance behavior, and drive learning. In many of these studies, novelty <b>and</b> <b>surprise</b> are not distinguished from one another: the words are used more-or-less interchangeably. However, while undeniably closely related, novelty <b>and</b> <b>surprise</b> are very different. The {{purpose of this article}} is &# 64257;rst to highlight the differences between novelty <b>and</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>and</b> to discuss how they are related by presenting an extensive review of mathematical and computational proposals related to them, and then to explore the implications of this for understanding behavioral and neuroscience data. We argue that opportunities for improved understanding of behavior and its neural basis are likely being missed by failing to distinguish between novelty and surpris...|$|R
5|$|In 1773, Barbauld {{brought out}} {{her first book}} of poems, after her friends had praised them and {{convinced}} her to publish. The collection, entitled simply Poems, went through four editions in just one year <b>and</b> <b>surprised</b> Barbauld by its success. Barbauld became a respected literary figure in England on the reputation of Poems alone. The same year she and her brother, John Aikin, jointly published Miscellaneous Pieces in Prose, which was also well received. The essays in it (most of which were by Barbauld) were favourably compared to Samuel Johnson's.|$|E
5|$|Shortly afterwards, Wark {{observed}} {{a battery of}} German 77mm guns firing on his rear companies, causing heavy casualties. Collecting a party of his men, he rushed the battery and succeeded in capturing four guns in conjunction with ten crewmen. With only two men, he pushed forward <b>and</b> <b>surprised</b> fifty Germans near Magny-la-Fosse who subsequently surrendered. At 15:00, he halted his battalion near Joncourt, and sent out patrols which found the town still occupied by enemy forces. The 32nd Battalion responded by withdrawing slightly and strengthening its line. At 17:30, the Germans launched a counter-attack that was repulsed {{with the assistance of}} the 31st Battalion, together with some men from the 46th (North Midland) Division.|$|E

On 13 December 1643 Captain Thomas Sandford and eight soldiers from that army crept into Beeston at night (possibly aided by treachery) <b>and</b> <b>surprised</b> the castle governor, Captain Thomas Steele, who was so shaken by the event that he surrendered on the promise {{that he would be}} allowed to march out of the castle with honours.

5|$|Wyatt {{was lucky}} during the few gun fights he {{took part in}} from his {{earliest}} job as an assistant police officer in Wichita to Tombstone, where he was briefly deputy U.S. marshal. Unlike his lawmen brothers Virgil and James, Wyatt was never wounded, although once his clothing and his saddle were shot through with bullet holes. According to John H. Flood's biography (as dictated to him by Wyatt Earp), Wyatt vividly recalled a presence that in several instances warned him away or urged him to take action. This happened {{when he was on}} the street, alone in his room at the Cosmopolitan Hotel, at Bob Hatch's Pool Hall, where he went moments before Morgan was assassinated, and again when he approached Iron Springs <b>and</b> <b>surprised</b> Curly Bill Brocius, killing him.|$|E

As they leave, Shrek saves Donkey from Dragon, who is heartbroken as a result. At first, Fiona is thrilled to be rescued but is quickly disappointed when Shrek reveals he is an ogre. She demands that Farquaad come to get her himself, but Shrek forcibly carries her with him. The three have several adventures on their way to Duloc, such as an encounter with Robin Hood wherein Fiona reveals that she is an expert martial artist.

5|$|Still {{farther north}} along the {{mountain}} ridge, in the Battle Mountain area, the battle was going poorly for the 24th Infantry. After C Company lost Battle Mountain, heavy UN airstrikes and artillery fire struck its crest in preparation for an infantry counterattack planned to regain the mountain from the North Koreans. The hot and sultry weather made climbing the steep slope difficult, but L Company was on top by 12:00 on August 21. North Korean troops had left the summit under fire from the UN aircraft, artillery, and mortars. The North Koreans placed their own mortar fire on the crest and prevented L Company from consolidating its position. This situation continued until mid afternoon when a North Korean platoon {{came out of the}} trenches on the eastern slope of the mountain <b>and</b> <b>surprised</b> a platoon of L Company with an attack from behind. The other two platoons of L Company, upon hearing firing, started to leave their positions and drift down the hill. The North Koreans swiftly reoccupied the peak while officers tried to assemble L and I Companies on the eastern slope. Elements of E Company also left their position during the day.|$|E

There was some discussion of which of the two very different Conservative candidates, the aristocrat or the labour representative, would be more popular in Oldham.|$|E

25|$|Two {{well known}} naval actions against pirates are the {{successful}} destructions of Edward Teach, or Blackbeard, and Bartholomew Roberts. In seventeen eighteen, {{off the coast}} of North Carolina at the Ocracoke Inlet, Teach's ship was at anchor <b>and</b> <b>surprised</b> by Lieutenant Maynard of the royal navy. Maynard and Teach engaged each other with small arms and cannon until the ships were close enough to board; Maynard boarded the pirate ship to fight Teach, and the notorious pirate eventually fell.
