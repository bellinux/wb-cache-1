Thus, the CO 2 contents of the various parts of one reservoir system should be approximately the same. However, the CO 2 contents of Wells <b>Fs</b> 6 <b>and</b> <b>Fs</b> 7 in the East Changde Reservoir are both <[*] 40 %, while the CO 2 contents of wells <b>Fs</b> 701 <b>and</b> <b>Fs</b> 9, which are only 2.5  km away from wells <b>Fs</b> 6 <b>and</b> <b>Fs</b> 7, are >[*] 80 % (Fig.  4).

5|$|Yttrium forms a water-insoluble fluoride, hydroxide, and oxalate, but its bromide, chloride, iodide, nitrate and sulfate are all soluble in water. The Y3+ ion is colorless in {{solution}} {{because of}} the absence of electrons in the d <b>and</b> <b>f</b> electron shells.|$|E
30|$|In addition, the {{temperature}} and pressure data {{as well as the}} CO 2 contents also indirectly verify the conclusions discussed above. As shown in Fig.  6, {{the temperature}}s and pressures of the stratum intersected by wells Fs 9, Fs 9 - 1, <b>and</b> <b>Fs</b> 701 show a consistent positive correlation, suggesting that they share the same temperature–pressure system, whereas wells <b>Fs</b> 6 <b>and</b> <b>Fs</b> 7 are part of another temperature–pressure system that is not interconnected with the former. In terms of CO 2 content, the five wells exhibit significant differences. The CO 2 contents of wells Fs 9, Fs 9 - 1, <b>and</b> <b>Fs</b> 701 are >[*] 80 %, whereas those of wells <b>Fs</b> 7 <b>and</b> <b>Fs</b> 6 are <[*] 40 %, i.e., 39.9 % and 15.3 %, respectively. Figure 4 and Table 1 together indicate that the amount of CO 2 within the pore space decreases with the increasing buried depth of our reservoir. Note that there exists a different declined trend of CO 2 between Fs 6 -Fs 7 <b>and</b> <b>Fs</b> 701 -Fs 9 -Fs 901. This phenomenon indicates that there are two separate reservoirs.|$|R

5|$|A more {{indirect}} {{effect would be}} that the contracted s and p1/2 orbitals shield (take on themselves) the charge of the nucleus more effectively, leaving even less for the outer d <b>and</b> <b>f</b> electrons, which therefore move on larger orbitals. Dubnium is greatly affected by this: unlike the previous group 5 members, its 7s electrons are more difficult to extract from an atom than the 6d electrons, though these energy levels remain close to each other.|$|E
5|$|A {{trend of}} {{decreasing}} electron affinity going down groups would be expected. The additional electron will be entering an orbital {{farther away from}} the nucleus. As such this electron would be less attracted to the nucleus and would release less energy when added. However, in going down a group, around one-third of elements are anomalous, with heavier elements having higher electron affinities than their next lighter congenors. Largely, {{this is due to the}} poor shielding by d <b>and</b> <b>f</b> electrons. A uniform decrease in electron affinity only applies to group 1 atoms.|$|E
5|$|Acer pseudoplatanus {{was first}} {{described}} by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in his Species Plantarum in 1753. It is the type species in the maple genus Acer. Many forms and varieties have been proposed, including natural varieties such as var. macrocarpum Spach, var. microcarpum Spach, and var. tomentosum Tausch, and forms such as f. erythrocarpum (Carrière) Pax, f. purpureum (Loudon) Rehder, <b>and</b> <b>f.</b> variegatum (Weston) Rehder.

After water shorted out old wires in the station, on March 11, 1999, a major fire {{occurred}} originating in an equipment room on the station's lower level. A 1930s-era relay room, which controlled the interlocking north of the station, was destroyed in the fire. The station was closed for several months, with G service suspended south of Hoyt–Schermerhorn Streets <b>and</b> <b>F</b> trains simply bypassing the station at a lower-than-normal operating speed. Signals and switches at the station were replaced and modernized after the fire, and again in Fall 2008 when the relay room was rebuilt.|$|E
