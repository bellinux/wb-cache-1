40|$|Abstract Background Sentinel {{surveillance}} for HIV in <b>ante-natal</b> <b>clinics</b> (ANC) {{remains the}} primary method for collecting timely trend data on HIV prevalence {{in most of}} sub-Saharan Africa. We describe prevalence of HIV and syphilis infection and trends over time in HIV prevalence among women attending <b>ante-natal</b> <b>clinics</b> (ANC) in Magu district and Mwanza city, part of Mwanza region in Northern Tanzania. HIV prevalence from ANC surveys in 2000 and 2002 was 10. 5 % and 10. 8 % respectively. In previous rounds urban residence, residential mobility, {{the length of time}} sexually active before marriage, time since marriage and age of the partner were associated with HIV infection. Methods A third round of HIV sentinel surveillance was conducted at <b>ante-natal</b> <b>clinics</b> in Mwanza region, Tanzania during 2006. We interviewed women attending 27 <b>ante-natal</b> <b>clinics.</b> In 15 clinics we also anonymously tested women for syphilis and HIV infection and linked these results to the questionnaire data. Results HIV prevalence was 7. 6 % overall in 2006 and 7. 4 % at the 11 clinics used in previous rounds. Geographical variations in HIV prevalence, apparent in previous rounds, have largely disappeared but syphilis prevalence is still higher in rural clinics. HIV prevalence has declined in urban clinics and is stable in rural clinics. The correlates of HIV infection have changed over time. In this round older age, lower gravidity, remarriage, duration of marriage, sexual activity before marriage, long interval between last birth and pregnancy and child death were all associated with infection. Conclusions HIV prevalence trends concur with results from a community-based cohort in the region. Correlates of HIV infection have also changed and more proximate, individual level factors are now more important, in line with the changing epidemiology of infection in this population. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{experiences}} of pregnant teenagers {{as related to}} ante-natal care were researched. The primary objective {{of the study was}} to explore and describe the experiences pregnant teenagers had of their ante-natal care. The researcher recommended measures based on the findings of the study to midwives to encourage ante-natal care clinic attendance amongst pregnant teenagers. The recommendations were such that even nurses at Primary Health Care clinics could utilise them as they also come into contact with pregnant teenagers. An increasing number of pregnant teenagers in the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Municipality area are admitted to referral hospitals with complications during pregnancy and labour. Some of these teenagers are un-booked or had only a few <b>ante-natal</b> <b>clinic</b> visits. The researcher therefore wanted to obtain first hand information related to the reluctance of pregnant teenagers to attend ante-natal care clinics. Attendance at ante-natal care clinics plays an important part in enabling the staff to screen pregnant mothers for health problems and so limit complications.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the effects of {{socio-cultural}} factors on maternal death in Tanzania with particular focus on Makete district in Njombe. region. The study attempted to answer the following questions: What are the social factors that contribute to maternal death in rural areas of Tanzania? What are the cultural factors that contribute to maternal deaths in rural areas of Tanzania? What is the women’s level of decision-making on issues that can control maternal mortality? The study was conducted among child-bearing women, health workers and village leaders in four wards of Makete District. Their selection was done using random sampling techniques and purposive sampling techniques. The study included both qualitative and quantitative data which were obtained through in-depth interviews, interviews, focus group discussions and direct observation methods. Regarding various social factors contributing to maternal mortality, the findings indicated that, women inability to make decisions on family planning use, women lack of decisions to go to the hospital during labour and women inability to decide to. attend <b>ante-natal</b> <b>clinic</b> can be the source of maternal death. On the other hand, women lack of decisions on eating nutritious food and women lack of decision-making on child bearing are cultural factors which can contribute to maternal death., Concerning women’s level of decision-making on issues that can control maternal death, the findings indicated that, women level of decision-making in Makete district is low. Due to low level of women decision-making on various matters, its effects revealed include limited <b>ante-natal</b> <b>clinic</b> attendance (87 %), early marriages (81 %), bearing many children (74 %), delays required care (61 %), poor nutritious food (60 %) and early child bearing (60 %) were mentioned to have effects on maternal mortality...|$|E

MethodsThis study used a cross-sectional survey, targeting pregnant women in sentinel sites. Pregnant women were tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and HIV infection. A series of tests were done to ensure high sensitivity. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of HBV-HIV co-infection among those collected during ANC sentinel surveillance, these included: age, marital status, education level, occupation, residence, pregnancy and syphilis infection.

Peripheral parasitemia {{was present in}} 18 % (19 / 106) of women: 15 Plasmodium falciparum and 4 P. vivax. Primigravidae were {{twice as likely to}} be parasitemic as multigravidae (31 % versus 14 %; relative risk: 2. 24; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 01 – 4. 96; P 0. 05). Although <b>ante-natal</b> <b>clinic</b> attendance was high, women booked late (mean, 19. 7 weeks) and attended irregularly. Free insecticide-treated nets (ITN) were not distributed despite government policy. Primigravidae were less likely to have an ITN in their homes than multigravidae (relative risk: 2. 13; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 03 – 4. 40). Coverage with chloroquine prophylaxis was low. This study revealed barriers to control of MIP at both the health service and client level.

Methods: Prospective study involving 30 pregnant women followed at an <b>ante-natal</b> <b>clinic</b> for 14 months. Hormone levels were analysed during pregnancy and the post-partum period. Results: Levels of all four hormones were elevated in the third trimester, compared with first trimester and postpartum values. Rhinitis patients had higher levels of oestrogen and {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} in the third trimester than non-rhinitis patients, although these differences were not statistically significant. The prevalence of rhinitis was 53. 3 per cent, with most cases occurring in the third trimester. Patients with pregnancy rhinitis had a higher prevalence of female babies, compared with non-rhinitis patients (p = 0. 003).
