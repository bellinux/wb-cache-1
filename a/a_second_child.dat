2500|$|<b>A</b> <b>second</b> <b>Children</b> in Need special, but {{one that}} was part of the series' continuity, was {{produced}} for the charity's 2005 appeal. This [...] starred David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor and Billie Piper as Rose Tyler, and filled in a gap between the episodes [...] "The Parting of the Ways" [...] and [...] "The Christmas Invasion".|$|R
40|$|The study {{investigated}} the firstborn's dependence behaviors {{in the context of}} <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>child's</b> pregnancy. Five preschool firstborns and their respective mothers, in the third trimester of pregnancy, took part in the study. The Fables Test was used in order to assess children's perceptions, and a semi-structured interview in order to investigate mothers' perceptions. The results revealed a dependence behavior tendency in the firstborn. There were also independence behaviors suggesting ambivalence. The results indicate that <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>child's</b> pregnancy is <b>a</b> special moment for the firstborn who is no longer an only child and has to learn to share maternal care. The investigation concerning changes in family relationships and their implications for each family member are of fundamental importance for understanding human development. This article represents a contribution to the literature which has not studied {{the extent to which the}} firstborn's behavior is affected by the presence of a sibling already during pregnancy...|$|R

5000|$|Julia Margaret Cameron was {{a strong}} {{advocate}} of this use of selective focus. For example, in [...] "Prayer and Praise", produced in 1865, there is a deliberate placement of focus at more than three points: on the face {{and parts of the}} body of the foreground child; and faces of mother and father; while <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>child's</b> face is thrown radically out of focus.|$|R

5|$|In 2011, city {{couples who}} both came from one-child {{families}} {{were allowed to}} have <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>child,</b> while couples in rural areas could have a second if just one of them came from a one-child family. In 2013, the further revision of the Planned Birth Policy allowed couples in which either parent had no siblings to have two children. In 2015, China allowed all couples to have two children, abolishing its decades-long one-child policy for urban families.|$|E

5|$|After April's failed {{wedding to}} Matthew, Callie and Arizona {{bought a house}} together, a fresh start, away from the {{memories}} of their apartment. They later decided to try again for <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>child.</b> However, {{a trip to the}} OB/GYN led to the discovery that Callie had developed adhesions in her uterus in the years since Sofia's birth, meaning she could not carry any more babies. After talking about it, the couple agreed to postpone their dream to have another baby until they're on more solid footing as a couple.|$|E
5|$|After a {{break in}} Cape Town, Coghlan and his wife left Kimberley for Bulawayo on 30 July 1900. There, they found the {{conditions}} to be very basic and the buildings, ramshackle. Nevertheless, the settlers enjoyed outdoor pursuits, dances and musical and theatrical performances. Coghlan and his wife lodged at the Grand Hotel. In 1901, not long after they arrived, the Coghlans' first child was born, but the baby lived only three days. <b>A</b> <b>second</b> <b>child,</b> a girl named Petal, was born in November 1902 and lived to old age.|$|E
5|$|All six main {{cast members}} from the pilot {{returned}} for the series; James Nesbitt and Helen Baxendale play Adam Williams and Rachel Bradley, a couple in a fledgling relationship; John Thomson and Fay Ripley play Pete and Jenny Gifford, a married couple whose first child is born in the first episode; Robert Bathurst and Hermione Norris play David and Karen Marsden, an upper-middle-class couple who are considering having <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>child.</b> Each had mixed feelings about whether {{there would be a}} series commission after the poor reception of the pilot; Ripley did not stop thinking about it, in contrast to Bathurst, who viewed it as just another failed pilot he had done.|$|E

5|$|In 1948 Kathleen married Frank Cole, a World War II veteran, {{and moved}} the family to Virginia. Godwin was further {{inspired}} by her mother's determination to continue writing after having <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>child.</b> According to Godwin, {{much of her time}} growing up was spent in the newsroom, where her mother worked. She also witnessed her mother's plays and novels being rejected. Godwin's autobiography creates the impression that much of her own writing was intended to accomplish the things her mother could not. As Cole's salary increased {{and he was able to}} support the family, Godwin's mother focused on being a wife and homemaker, eventually not writing at all.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>child,</b> Kate, was born. Green again {{returned}} to her studies after maternity leave, and by 1985 had completed her fellowship.

5|$|In 1814, the seventeen-year-old Mary Shelley (Mary Godwin, at the time) ran {{off with}} Percy Bysshe Shelley to {{continental}} Europe, accompanied by Claire Clairmont, Mary's stepsister. After six weeks of travelling, they returned to England but continued to live together. Mary returned pregnant with Percy's child, but their infant daughter died soon after her premature birth. Percy was alienated from his family and received little financial support from them; he was therefore harassed by creditors. In 1816, Mary and Percy had <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>child,</b> William. The same year, Claire Clairmont began an affair with the poet Lord Byron, and in January 1817 she had a daughter by him, Allegra.

In September 1817, Mary and Percy had another child, Clara.|$|E
50|$|Brown {{published}} <b>a</b> <b>second</b> book, <b>Children</b> Of Ham, which {{explores the}} lives of several black teenagers from Harlem who escape the clutches of heroin.

In 1961, Brown’s article “Harlem, My Harlem” was published in Dissent.|$|R

At Haasts Bluff they had <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>child,</b> Narrabri Narrapayi, in 1949. The population moved to Papunya in the late 1950s, where Makinti had another child, Jacqueline Daaru, in 1958. She had a daughter, Winnie Bernadette, in 1961 in Alice Springs. The family moved to Kintore when it was established in the early 1980s, and by 1996 Kumentje was painting there for the Papunya Tula Artists Cooperative.

5|$|Pete Gifford is Jenny's {{husband and}} has been Adam's best friend since {{childhood}}. Bullen based Pete on his own childhood friend, with whom he went through university. Pete is often deliberately insensitive towards Adam, which Thomson attributes to Pete thinking Adam is jealous of his achievements. In Series 2, Pete has an affair with co-worker Amy. It upsets his marriage to Jenny and by Series 3 they are separated. At the beginning of Series 4, they are back together and expecting <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>child.</b> After Jenny miscarries, she leaves Pete and takes little Adam with her.

5|$|Soon after, Clairmont {{became a}} lover of the Romantic poet Lord Byron, and Mary Godwin and Shelley had <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>child</b> on 24 January 1816, who was named William after Godwin. In February, Imlay went to visit the Shelleys, who had settled in Bishopsgate. Godwin's debts {{continued}} to mount, and while he demanded money from Shelley, Godwin still refused to see either him or his daughter. At this time, Charles Clairmont (Imlay's step-brother), frustrated with {{the tension in the}} Godwin household, left for France and refused to help the family any further. At around the same time, Claire Clairmont, Mary Godwin, and Shelley left for the Continent, seeking Byron. Godwin was aghast. He relied on Shelley's money, and the stain on his family's reputation only increased when the public learned that the group had left to join the rakish Byron.|$|E
