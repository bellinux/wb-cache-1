40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{relationship}} between the size of the banking sector 2 ̆ 019 s refinancing needs vis- 0 -vis the central bank and <b>auction</b> <b>rates</b> in its open market operations in times of financial market stress. In a theoretical model, it is found that marginal rates at central bank auctions may increase if the share of troubled banks becomes too high relative to the total size of the banking sector 2 ̆ 019 s refinancing needs. An empirical analysis then aims at determining the size of open market operations needed to absorb large stress levels in interbank money markets and hence contain central bank <b>auction</b> <b>rates.</b> Finally, the paper analyses effects of the composition of open market operations of different maturities on <b>auction</b> <b>rates.</b> It is found that a too high share of longer-term refinancing induces a rise in <b>auction</b> <b>rates</b> which is undesirable. Therefore, the analysis suggests that there is a lower bound for the amount of liquidity provided through short-term operations...|$|R

40|$|The {{residential}} market in Melbourne {{is often referred}} to as the ‘auction capital of the world’ with approximately 30 - 35 % of housing transfers undertaken via the auction process, most of which are conducted on the weekend and then reported in the media the following day. The most quoted measurement of auction success is via the clearance rate which simply indicates the proportion of signed contracts of sale within the auction process. At the same time the clearance rate can have a relatively large variance where the {{residential market}} can traditionally range from very good (i. e. a high clearance rate) to very poor (i. e. a low clearance rate). The subsequent effect on the market can directly increase or decrease demand, predominantly based only on this single measure of the perceived level of <b>auction</b> clearance <b>rates</b> only. This paper examines the concept of the <b>auction</b> clearance <b>rates</b> and the heavy reliance on the only one measure of success (i. e. the clearance rates), regardless of other variables. The emphasis is placed on the <b>auction</b> clearance <b>rate</b> as one measure of demand in the housing market but within the context of the definition of market value i. e. willing buyer-willing seller. This is supported by a discussion about other variables including the asking price, the auction process itself, marketing considerations and seasonal adjustments. The findings provide an insight into how to correctly interpret the <b>auction</b> clearance <b>rate</b> in the context of the overall supply-demand interactions. Whilst the auction process is clearly an integral part of the residential transfer process it is essential that the <b>auction</b> clearance <b>rate</b> is used with caution and also in conjunction with other variables. <br /...|$|R

We propose an econometric method that exploits data from auction tables and we determine variables influencing the shape of market bid functions and their fluctuations across auctions.

40|$|Flexible exchange-rate systems {{often are}} not {{recommended}} for countries undergoing economic transition. In late 1989, the former Soviet Union instituted exchange-rate flexibility on the limited share of enterprise international transactions channelled through the auction and. later, interbank markets for foreign-currency trade. This paper details the regulatory evolution of this system and analyses the impact of announced and implemented policy initiatives on two sets of flexible exchange rates observed in Moscow: i) the exchange-rates instituted through foreign-currency auctions and interbank markets; and ii) black-market exchange rates on dollar-ruble trade. We ask whether the flexible-rate system, as implemented, {{was associated with the}} negative or positive features of flexible exchange-rate systems. Initially the auction and interbank currency structure was used as a mechanism for a steady real depreciation of the ruble. Thereafter, the ruble was pegged in real terms at a level initially equal to the black-market exchange rate. This peg persisted until the end of 1991, when government central-bank foreign-exchange reserves were depleted and the crawling peg appears to have been abandoned. Throughout the sample, patterns in black-market exchange rates contrasted sharply with those of the <b>auction</b> <b>rates.</b> Black-market rates exhibited greater real variability and exhibited sharp speculative swings. ...|$|R

40|$|An {{appraisal}} of the trawl fishery based on the data collected from Mangalore and Malpe during the fishing seasons 1980 - 81 and 1981 - 82 were attempted. The prawns alone contributed around 70 - 75 % of the total value realised,although it formed only 13 % of the annual average trawl catch. The landings of the important groups like Prawns, Fishes, Stomatopods, Crabs, Cephalopods by trawl nets at Mangalore and Malpe were compared. Among different species of prawns,P. stiilifera and M. dobsoni were the dominant species contributing around 80 - 85 % of the annual prawn catch. Landings were generally high during September and January- May at both the centres. By-catches in trawls includes fishes,cephalopods,crabs and stomatopods.

40|$|For decades, the {{government}} of Hong Kong enjoyed huge fiscal surpluses. Only rarely did Hong Kong register a fiscal deficit. The natural questions to ask, following this observation, are: where did the surging revenues come from, and can such huge revenues be expected to continue indefinitely? It is the thesis of this chapter that the Hong Kong government, during the decade immediately preceding the handover, raised much of its revenue through land rent and inflation. The land rent was collected as land premiums which were collected though land <b>auctions,</b> <b>rates,</b> and other land-related revenues. The inflation tax was also raised directly by imposing higher fees and charges, and indirectly by fueling inflation expectations, as {{the government}} had increased Hong Kong people’s demand for property investment {{to serve as a}} hedge against inflation. This has contributed to higher proceeds in land auctions and high amounts of land premiums collected. While I would not say that the government has a “high land price policy” as many commentators claim, I have criticized time and again the government’s inflationary ways as highly dangerous and ultimately unsustainable. In this chapter, I also argue that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government’s mishandling of its housing policy has aggravated the inevitable fiscal crisis deeply and has left a trail of bankruptcies and bad debt that will take years to clean up...|$|R
