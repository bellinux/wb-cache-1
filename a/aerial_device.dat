5000|$|While {{nearly all}} Firecoaches were two-axle configurations, several [...] "tractor" [...] units were built to tow <b>aerial</b> <b>devices</b> and for various {{specialty}} uses. Derived from the Crown Supercoach product line, the cab-forward Firecoach {{was of a}} mid-engine layout. Although equipped with Hall-Scott gasoline engines like the Supercoach, the Firecoach was equipped with much larger versions (935 and 1091 cubic inches vs. 590). In 1958, to improve braking ability, Firecoaches (alongside all other Crown Coach vehicles) were equipped with 10-inch wide brake drums. For 1963, an automatic transmission became an option. Although introduced in the Supercoach a decade earlier, Crown produced its first diesel-powered Firecoach in 1964.|$|R
50|$|A quintuple {{combination}} pumper or quint is a {{fire service}} apparatus {{that serves the}} dual purpose of an engine and a ladder truck. The name quint {{is derived from the}} Latin prefix quinque-, meaning five, and refers to the five functions that a quint provides: pump, water tank, fire hose, <b>aerial</b> <b>device,</b> and ground ladders.|$|E
5000|$|In 1961, aerial devices saw {{a change}} as Crown {{introduced}} its first Firecoach snorkel truck (bucket lift). In 1966, Crown produces its first company-produced tiller-based <b>aerial</b> <b>device,</b> though a 2-axle ladder truck {{made its debut}} the same year. In 1969, the first quint version of the Firecoach made its debut as Crown introduced the Firecoach TeleSquirt.|$|E

During its production run, the Firecoach would be introduced {{in a variety}} of other configurations for customer requests. In 1955, the first water tender Firecoach was introduced. In 1956, a Firecoach was introduced as a tiller truck; the Firecoach chassis was a tractor towing an American LaFrance <b>aerial</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E
40|$|Polyvinyl {{chloride}} (PVC) {{tubes are}} effective bait stations for delivering dead neonatal mice (DNM) {{treated with the}} oral toxicant, 80 mg acetaminophen, to brown treesnakes (Boiga irregularis) in accessible jungle forest on Guam. However, PVC tubes are not practical for delivery of baits to remote areas of jungle or the forest canopy. Further, {{it is important that}} baits entangle in the canopy and not fall to the ground where they can be scavenged by non-target animals such as crabs. Data from helicopter aerial deployment of untreated DNM with radio transmitters that landed on the ground in areas of high coconut crab (Birgus latro) and hermit crab (Coenobita spp.) abundance showed that 67 % of DNM were taken by crabs and 11 % by monitor lizards (Varanus indicus). In contrast, in low crab abundance areas crabs took 24 % of the DNM that landed on the ground. It is evident from these data that a flotation system that delivers DNM to the canopy is needed; otherwise non-target animals will remove DNM, making them unavailable for snakes. Seven <b>aerial</b> flotation <b>devices</b> were evaluated. Promising <b>aerial</b> <b>devices</b> are two types of commercial cardboard paper streamers that resulted in 75 % - 85 % of the DNM becoming entangled in the canopy...|$|R

The first was a 75-foot model which replaced Ladder 3 as Aerial Tower 1 and the second was an 85-foot model which replaced Ladder 26 as Aerial Tower 2. The vehicles were moved around the city as needed. After both aerial units were disbanded in the early 1980s, the second unit re-emerged in 1983 as Boston Fire Department's Tower Unit and served until replacement in 1985.

40|$|Authorized SLAC {{personnel}} and subcontractors may use mobile elevating work platforms (MEWPs) to raise personnel, equipment, and working materials to elevated work areas. MEWPs (including scissors lifts, articulating boom <b>aerial</b> <b>devices,</b> and elevating platforms) offer flexible and versatile access to elevated locations. When work must be performed {{for extended periods}} of time at elevation and there is no guarded, fixed work surface available, it is generally appropriate to use a MEWP. When a MEWP is properly used, it can provide a useful working platform at heights, and is often safer than ladders or other access equipment. This chapter describes the minimum requirements for safely operating MEWPs at SLAC. 1. 1 Hazards/Impacts The misuse of MEWPs can result in property damage, severe injury, or death. Accidents associated with MEWPs include tip / roll-overs, collapses, or personnel being thrown from the basket. The risk of falling or being pinned by a nearby structure is increased by an impact, ground movement, improper maneuvering by the operator, or failure of an equipment component that is critical to the stability of the MEWP. Contact with electrical lines or equipment is a major hazard associated with MEWPs. ...|$|R

40|$|Many fire {{departments}} {{across the country}} have been fighting scarce local government resources and competition for those resources. Today, every fire chief has the responsibility to {{take a close look at}} methods of improving the management of their departmental resources. Fire apparatus is a key area in which improvements can be made. Determining before each apparatus purchase what its objectives are going to be and precisely what outcomes your community requires from it, is a most critical part of managing departmental resources. The Grand Rapids Fire Department was recently faced with the decision of continuing to replace traditional aerial devices with quints or revert back to the traditional style. The present quints were purchased because of the increasing number of incidents when a ladder truck would arrive on the fire scene without extinguishing capabilities. Department leaders felt a quint provided versatility and options that a traditional <b>aerial</b> <b>device</b> did not.

40|$|Cellular {{has always}} relied on static {{deployments}} for providing wireless access. However, even the emerging fifth-generation (5 G) networks may face difficulty {{in supporting the}} increased traffic demand with rigid, fixed infrastructure without substantial over-provisioning. This is particularly true for spontaneous large-scale events that require service providers to augment capacity of their networks quickly. Today, the use of <b>aerial</b> <b>devices</b> equipped with high-rate radio access capabilities {{has the potential to}} offer the much needed "on-demand" capacity boost. Conversely, it also threatens to rattle the long-standing business strategies of wireless operators, especially as the "gold rush" for cheaper millimeter wave (mmWave) spectrum lowers the market entry barriers. However, the intricate structure of this new market presently remains a mystery. This paper sheds light on competition and cooperation behavior of dissimilar aerial mmWave access suppliers, concurrently employing licensed and license-exempt frequency bands, by modeling it as a vertically differentiated market where customers have varying preferences in price and quality. To understand viable service provider strategies, we begin with constructing the Nash equilibrium for the initial market competition by employing the Bertrand and Cournot games. We then conduct a unique assessment of short-term market dynamics, where two licensed-band service providers may cooperate to improve their competition positions against the unlicensed-band counterpart intruding the market. Our unprecedented analysis studies the effects of various market interactions, price-driven demand evolution, and dynamic profit balance in this novel type of ecosystem.
