40|$|Mammals {{and birds}} have evolved {{the ability to}} {{maintain}} a high and constant body temperature Tb {{over a wide range}} of <b>ambient</b> <b>temperatures</b> <b>T</b> a using endogenous heat production. In many, especially small endotherms, cost for thermoregulatory heat production can exceed available energy; to overcome these energetic bottlenecks, they enter a state of torpor (a regulated reduction of Tb and metabolic rate). Since the occurrence of torpor in many species is a seasonal event and occurs at certain times of the day, we review whether circadian and circannual rhythms, important in the timing of biological events in active animals, also play an important role during torpor when Tb is reduced substantially and may even fall below 0 °C. The two distinct patterns of torpor, hibernation (prolonged torpor) and daily torpor, differ substantially in their interaction with the circadian system. Daily torpor appears to be integrated into the normal circadian rhythm of activity and rest, although torpor is not restricted only to the normal rest phase of an animal. I...|$|R

Furthermore, minimum T sk of Hauturu bats correlated positively with mean T a and Hauturu bats {{were more likely to}} arouse on nights with warmer sunset T a. No correlation was found for Pureora bats. Torpor bout duration did not differ between sites. On Hauturu, bats preferred thermally unstable roosts and preferentially roosted inside dead punga/silver fern-trees (Cyathea dealbata). As punga thermal characteristics did not differ from T a, Hauturu bats may take advantage of warm T a to reduce rewarming costs. We did not observe differences in any thermoregulatory variables between sexes in Hauturu. Differences in winter T a may differentially impact populations across a latitudinal gradient. Although bat populations in warmer climates are under less thermoregulatory stress, site and climate specific adaptations appear to be employed that affect roost choice and torpor patterns...|$|R

A series solution method is used to solve the governing non-linear set of partial differential equations near the thermal leading edge. It is shown that the effect of the horizontal free stream on the boundary layer gradually increases as one move upward away from the thermal leading edge along the cylinder. The solution has been obtained for different values of the Prandtl number, Pr, and it is shown that for Pr = 0. 733 and Pr = 6. 7 the present results are in excellent agreement with ones known from the open literature. Key words: free-forced convection, numerical solution, vertical cylinder, boundary layer. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} aimed to {{investigate}} whether embryonic temperature manipulation may alter thermal preference throughout the rearing phase of broiler chickens and how this manipulation may affect response to thermal challenge, metabolism, growth rate and feed intake rate. Eggs were exposed to a constant incubation temperature [machine temperatures: 36 °C (Low), 37. 5 °C (Control), and 39 °C (High); eggshell temperature of 37. 4 ± 0. 08 °C, 37. 8 ± 0. 15 °C, and 38. 8 ± 0. 33 °C, respectively] from d 13 till hatching. Low treatment chickens showed lower plasma T 3 and GH levels at d 1 of age and lower T 3 level at d 42 of age compared to the Control treatment. Preferred <b>ambient,</b> rectal <b>temperature,</b> <b>T</b> 4 level, growth rate, food intake rate, and response to thermal challenge were not altered in these chickens. On the other hand, High-treatment chickens exhibited high preferred <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> and rectal temperature during the first 2 wk post-hatch, lower plasma T 3 level at d 21 and 42 and a delayed increase in respiratory movement in response to thermal challenge compared to the Control treatment. However, chickens subjected to the Control and High treatments {{did not differ in}} T 4 and GH level and performance. We conclude that exposure to high temperature during late embryonic development has long-lasting effects on the thermoregulatory system of broiler chickens by affecting the heat tolerance of these chickens. Moreover, the preferred <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> of the chickens from heat-treated eggs correspond to those recommended for the strain under study, whereas for the cold-treated and control-chickens it was 1 °C below, indicating that incubation temperature might have consequences on the <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> chickens require during the rearing phase. </p...|$|R
40|$|Due {{in large}} part to in {{prevalence}} of solar energy, increasing demand of energy production (from all sources), and the uncertain future of petroleum energy feedstocks, solar energy harvesting and other photochemical systems will {{play a major role in}} the developing energy market. This dissertation focuses on a novel photochemical reaction process: high temperature photocatalysis (i. e., photocatalysis conducted above <b>ambient</b> <b>temperatures,</b> <b>T</b> > 100 °C). The overarching hypothesis of this process is that photo-generated charge carriers are able to constructively participate in thermo-catalytic chemical reactions, thereby increasing catalytic rates at one temperature, or maintaining catalytic rates at lower temperatures. The photocatalytic oxidation of carbon deposits in an operational hydrocarbon reformer is one envisioned application of high temperature photocatalysis. Carbon build-up during hydrocarbon reforming results in catalyst deactivation, in the worst cases, this was shown to happen in a period of minutes with a liquid hydrocarbon. In the presence of steam, oxygen, and above-ambient temperatures, carbonaceous deposits were photocatalytically oxidized over very long periods (t ≥ 24 hours). This initial experiment exemplified the necessity of a fundamental assessment of high temperature photocatalytic activity. Fundamental understanding of the mechanisms that affect photocatalytic activity as a function of temperatures was achieved using an ethylene photocatalytic oxidation probe reaction. Maximum ethylene photocatalytic oxidation rates were observed between 100 °C and 200 °C; the maximum photocatalytic rates were approximately a factor of 2 larger than photocatalytic rates at <b>ambient</b> <b>temperatures.</b> The loss of photocatalytic activity at temperatures above 200 °C is due to a non-radiative multi-phonon recombination mechanism. Further, it was shown that the fundamental rate of recombination (as a function of temperature) can be effectively modeled as a temperature-dependent quantum efficiency term, and is directly driven by bulk photocatalyst crystal parameters: maximum phonon energy and the number of phonons allowed per unit cell. This analysis extends to multiple photocatalysts and can explain experimental observations of photocatalytic oxidation rates with varied reactant concentrations. Lastly, this dissertation applies this knowledge to a thermo-catalytic reaction (CO-oxidation) using a Au/TiO 2 catalyst. The combined photo/thermo-catalytic reaction showed a 10 - 25 % increase in CO conversion during a temperature programmed reaction experiment...|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} temperature and humidity on thyroid hormones (T 4, T 3) and thyrotropin (TSH) measured in blood spots dried on filter paper. AlAs for 14 and T 3 blood spots were optimized to measure these analytes over the neonatal and euthyroid adult reference intervals. Sensitivities of the T 3 and T 4 assays were 0. 5 and 10 nmol/L, respective-ly. A blood-spot immunoradiometric assay for TSH involving magnetizable particles was developed with a sensitivity of 6 milli-int. unitslL. Control sera stored at- 20 DC, 4 #{ 176 }C,room temperature, 37 #{ 176 }C,and at external <b>ambient</b> <b>temperatures</b> for 36 days showed no significant change in measured concen-trations of TSH or 13 during 30 days or for T 4 at- 20 and 4 #{ 176 }C.
