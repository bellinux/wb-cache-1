However, NPR was never the producer of the radio series nor was it ever granted the rights to produce the radio adaptions nor did NPR fund any of the radio productions. Plans for a Jedi radio adaptation fell apart in the 1980s due to a disagreement (believed to be financial) between KUSC, Los Angeles (the producer of the two previous radio adaptations and to whom the rights were granted for production) and Lucasfilm. NPR was granted limited rights to air the two previous radio series because KUSC, Los Angeles provided the radio adaptations to NPR as part of NPR's National Program Service that allows any NPR member station rights to air the series {{as part of the}} annual dues already paid (rather than the 3rd party Extended Program Service where KUSC could have charged each station a fee for rights to <b>air</b> <b>cutting</b> out NPR). It was not until 1996 that a six-part adaptation of Return of the Jedi was made by Highbridge Audio, the company that had released the first two series on tape and CD. The production returned to the Westlake Recording Studios, where the original series had been recorded.|$|E
5000|$|The 3.34 km Victoria Tunnel/Waterloo Tunnel in Liverpool, England, {{was bored}} under a {{metropolis}} opening in 1848. The tunnel was initially {{used only for}} rail freight serving the Waterloo Freight terminal, and later freight and passengers serving the Liverpool ship liner terminal. The tunnel's path is from Edge Hill in {{the east of the}} city to the north end Liverpool docks at Waterloo Dock. The tunnel is split into two tunnels with a short open <b>air</b> <b>cutting</b> linking the two. The cutting is where the cable hauled trains from Edge Hill were hitched and unhitched. The two tunnels are effectively one on the same centre line and are regarded as one. However, as initially the 2375 m long Victoria section was originally cable hauled and the shorter 862 m Waterloo section was locomotive hauled, two separate names were given, the short section was named the Waterloo Tunnel. In 1895 the two tunnels were converted to locomotive haulage. Used until 1972, the tunnel is still in excellent condition. A short section of the Victoria tunnel at Edge Hill is still used for shunting trains. The tunnel is being considered for reuse by the Merseyrail network. Stations cut into the tunnel are being considered and also reuse by a monorail system from the proposed Liverpool Waters redevelopment of Liverpool's Central Docks has been proposed.|$|E

The micro dimples are machined in milling with the inclined ball end mill. When an inclined two flutes end mill removes the material in a depth of cut less than the tool radius, the <b>air</b> <b>cutting</b> time during neither edges contact with the workpiece appears in a rotation of cutter. When the tool is fed at a high feed rate so that the removal areas of an edge and another edge do not overlap each other, the concave dimples are machined. A mechanistic model {{is presented to}} control the shape {{and the size of}} the dimples to be machined. The micro dimples were machined to verify the mechanistic model in milling.

40|$|A new three-color {{infrared}} radiation pyrometer using an optical fiber is developed for measuring cutting temperature in high speed machining by small ball end mill. The high speed air spindle unit is adopted to the ordinary milling machine so that the maximum spindle revolution of 40000 rpm is attainable. The ball radius of the carbide cutter is 3 mm and the side cutting of carbon steel with ballnose is executed without cutting fluid. Cutting temperature distribution along the ball-nosed cutting-edge is measured. The influences of spindle rotational speed, radial depth of cut and feed per tooth on the temperature distribution at the flank face are examined. The maximum temperature of peripheral cutting edge about 700 °C is obtained even at the rotation angle of 180 ° after cutting, and it drops along the ballnose toward the ball tip. Relatively large temperature gradient arises along the ball cutting-edge at higher spindle revolution because cutting speed depends on the local tool radius. Depth of cut and feed per tooth, at the same time, affect the overall temperature at the ball cutting edges. The cooling characteristics in <b>air</b> <b>cutting</b> reveals that the temperature difference during one cycle of intermittent cutting increases as spindle speed decreases. The relationship between the peripheral cutting speed and the tool temperature varies from tool shank to ball tip because the interactions between cutting edge and workpiece change along the ballnose...|$|E

40|$|In Underbalanced Drilling (UBD) method, it is {{difficult}} to predict the equivalent circulation density due to co-existence of three phases which are <b>air,</b> <b>cuttings</b> and drilling fluid. This study presents the application of a developed model inspired from a novel intelligent algorithm namely radial basis function optimized by genetic algorithm (GA-RBF) algorithm to calculate frictional pressure loss of two-phase gasified drilling fluid flow along with cutting as the third phase in inclined wellbore portions. The suggested approach was conducted to extensive data reported in literature and was based on Rate of Penetration (ROP), wellbore inclination, pipe rotation and in situ flow rate of each phase. The results of this study show that the proposed model could reproduce the experimental frictional pressure loss data to an acceptable accuracy due to high correlation coefficient (R 2  >  0. 99) and very small values of average absolute relative deviation (AARD) (2. 166726), standard deviation (STD) (0. 038222) and root mean square error (RMSE) (0. 008783).

40|$|International audienceDuring several balloon flights {{inside the}} Arctic polar vortex in early 2003, unusual trace gas {{distributions}} were observed, which indicate {{a strong influence}} of mesospheric air in the stratosphere. The tuneable diode laser (TDL) instrument SPIRALE (Spectroscopie InFrarouge par Absorption de Lasers Embarqués) measured unusually high CO values (up to 600 ppb) on 27 January at about 30 km altitude. The cryosampler BONBON sampled air masses with very high molecular Hydrogen, extremely low SF 6 and enhanced CO values on 6 March at about 25 km altitude. Finally, the MIPAS (Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding) Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) spectrometer showed NO y values which are significantly higher than NO y * (the NO y derived from a correlation between N 2 O and NO y under undisturbed conditions), on 21 and 22 March in a layer centred at 22 km altitude. Thus, the mesospheric air {{seems to have been}} present in a layer descending from about 30 km in late January to 25 km altitude in early March and about 22 km altitude on 20 March. We present corroborating evidence from a model study using the KASIMA (KArlsruhe Simulation model of the Middle Atmosphere) model that also shows a layer of mesospheric air, which descended into the stratosphere in November and early December 2002, before the minor warming which occurred in late December 2002 lead to a descent of upper stratospheric <b>air,</b> <b>cutting</b> of a layer in which mesospheric air is present.

The same feature is found in trajectory calculations, based on a large number of trajectories started in the vicinity of the observations on 6 March. Based on the difference between the mean age derived from SF 6 (which has an irreversible mesospheric loss) and from CO 2 (whose mesospheric loss is much smaller and reversible) we estimate that the fraction of mesospheric air in the layer observed on 6 March, must have been somewhere between 35 % and 100 %...|$|E

40|$|Air {{abrasion}} as a caries removal {{technique is}} less aggressive than conventional techniques and is compatible {{for use with}} adhesive restorative materials. Alumina, while being currently the most common abrasive used for cutting, has controversial health and safety issues and no remineralisation properties.
