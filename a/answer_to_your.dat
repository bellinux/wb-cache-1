25|$|In <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> {{question}} concerning Lilith, I shall {{explain to}} you {{the essence of the}} matter. Concerning this point there is a received tradition from the ancient Sages who made use of the Secret Knowledge of the Lesser Palaces, which is the manipulation of demons and a ladder by which one ascends to the prophetic levels. In this tradition, it is made clear that Samael and Lilith were born as one, similar to the form of Adam and Eve who were also born as one, reflecting what is above. This is the account of Lilith which was received by the Sages in the Secret Knowledge of the Palaces. The Matron Lilith is the mate of Samael. Both of them were born at the same hour in the image of Adam and Eve, intertwined in each other. Asmodeus the great king of the demons has as a mate the Lesser (younger) Lilith, daughter of the king whose name is Qafsefoni. The name of his mate is Mehetabel daughter of Matred, and their daughter is Lilith.|$|E

2500|$|Political {{scientist}} Andrew Hacker wrote: [...] "It is {{more than}} a little revealing that whites who travelled south in 1964 referred to their sojourn as their 'Mississippi summer'. It is as if all the efforts of the local blacks for voter registration and the desegregation of public facilities had not even existed until white help arrived... Of course, this was done with benign intentions, as if to say 'we have come in <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> calls for assistance'. The problem was... the condescending tone... For Jewish liberals, the great memory of that summer has been the deaths of Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner and—almost as an afterthought—James Chaney. Indeed, Chaney's name tends to be listed last, as if the life he lost was worth only three fifths of the others." ...|$|E

Fontana replied, [...] "In <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> question, NO — there were no homosexual double-entendres in the script — at least none that were deliberate. If some viewers chose to read that into the dialogue, etc., that's their point of view, but certainly not ours. Writer Theodore Sturgeon was trying to reveal Spock's inner human in a struggle with what his culture, his upbringing and his half-human/half-Vulcan heritage had instilled in him about emotion and controlling it in an out-of-control situation. It also was a peek into the Vulcan culture {{that no one had}} seen before. That's ALL we were doing. I've heard this nonsense (especially about Kirk/Spock) for years. There is no basis to it. I hope this answer is helpful to you" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{strike and}} the {{subsequent}} Snow Riot in the District [...] exacerbated [...] long standing white fears of black workers on the navy yard. [...] In an undated diary entry for August 1835, African American diarist Michael Shiner confirms intimidation by white workers and their demand that the black caulkers stop work: [...] "Commodore Hull ishsared and evry one of them struck and said they wouldnt work anny moore {{and at the same}} time they were collered man from Baltimore by the name of Israel Jones a caulker by Trade he was the forman Caulker of those Colerded Caulkers and they where fifteen or twenty of them here at that time Caulkin on the Columbia and the Carpenters made all of them knock oft two." [...] As Michael Shiner wrote the white workers blamed Hull for bringing in black caulkers from Baltimore, Maryland and believed that black workers were to be used to break their strike. Hull's report to Dickerson shows the black caulkers did not strike. This and other incidents raised always simmering racial tension in the city and on the navy yard. White mechanics and laborers went on a three day rampage in which they threatened blacks and broke up their businesses and property. [...] On August 14, 1835, he wrote a letter to Dickerson, and expressed some apprehension for the safety of the black caulkers that he recently hired. [...] Rather than make a decision, Hull looked to the Secretary for a solution to his dilemma. [...] "Information has been conveyed to me that the Excitement which has prevailed in the City for some days past is about to be extended to the Neighborhood of the Establishment; the immediate Cause I understand is there are employed in the Yard a number of Blacks, who were in consequence of the Scarcity of Caulkers in this City brought in from Baltimore to caulk the Ship now building.Under the Circumstances I have to request that you will be pleased to give me instructions, Shall I let the Blacks inside the yard and afford them such protection as the force and means at my Command will allow or shall I discharge them and afford them an opportunity to return to Baltimore?" [...] As one historian has noted, Dickerson chose to throw the black caulkers to the mob as he promptly replied, “In <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> letter of this date, I have to observe that for the present should think it not best to admit the colored people in the Navy Yard at night.” After days of disorder and riot, President Andrew Jackson ordered a company of US Marines to restore order.|$|E
