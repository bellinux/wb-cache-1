5|$|Transfer RNA (tRNA) {{is a small}} RNA {{chain of}} about 80 {{nucleotides}} that transfers a specific amino acid to a growing polypeptide chain at the ribosomal site of protein synthesis during translation. It has sites for amino acid attachment and an <b>anticodon</b> region for codon recognition that binds to a specific sequence on the messenger RNA chain through hydrogen bonding.|$|E
5|$|Translation is {{the process}} by which a mature mRNA {{molecule}} is used as a template for synthesizing a new protein. Translation is carried out by ribosomes, large complexes of RNA and protein responsible for carrying out the chemical reactions to add new amino acids to a growing polypeptide chain by the formation of peptide bonds. The genetic code is read three nucleotides at a time, in units called codons, via interactions with specialized RNA molecules called transfer RNA (tRNA). Each tRNA has three unpaired bases known as the <b>anticodon</b> that are complementary to the codon it reads on the mRNA. The tRNA is also covalently attached to the amino acid specified by the complementary codon. When the tRNA binds to its complementary codon in an mRNA strand, the ribosome attaches its amino acid cargo to the new polypeptide chain, which is synthesized from amino terminus to carboxyl terminus. During and after synthesis, most new proteins must fold to their active three-dimensional structure before they can carry out their cellular functions.|$|E

It has also been suggested that tRNA acts as a selective constraint for determining codon usage. We have studied the relation between G. C/A. T pressure and tRNA constraints in determining choice of the third nucleotide of eight two-codon sets, using codon usage data obtained from protein genes in four bacterial species, Mycoplasma capricolum, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Micrococcus luteus, and in liverwort (Marchantia polymorpha) chloroplasts. The genomic G + C contents of these range from 25 % to 74 %. The results demonstrate that tRNA levels act additively to A. T and G.

25|$|A {{large number}} of the {{individual}} nucleotides in a tRNA molecule may be chemically modified, often by methylation or deamidation. These unusual bases sometimes affect the tRNA's interaction with ribosomes and sometimes occur in the <b>anticodon</b> to alter base-pairing properties.|$|E
25|$|Every mRNA {{consists}} of three parts: a 5' untranslated region (5'UTR), a protein-coding region or open reading frame (ORF), and a 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). The coding region carries information for protein synthesis encoded by the genetic code to form triplets. Each triplet of nucleotides of the coding region is called a codon and corresponds to a binding site complementary to an <b>anticodon</b> triplet in transfer RNA. Transfer RNAs with the same <b>anticodon</b> sequence always carry an identical type of amino acid. Amino acids are then chained together by the ribosome according {{to the order of}} triplets in the coding region. The ribosome helps transfer RNA to bind to messenger RNA and takes the amino acid from each transfer RNA and makes a structure-less protein out of it. Each mRNA molecule is translated into many protein molecules, on average ~2800 in mammals.|$|E
25|$|It {{is thought}} that DNMT3a and DNMT3b are the de novo methyltransferases that set up DNA {{methylation}} patterns early in development. DNMT3L is a protein that is homologous to the other DNMT3s but has no catalytic activity. Instead, DNMT3L assists the de novo methyltransferases by increasing their ability to bind to DNA and stimulating their activity. Finally, DNMT2 (TRDMT1) {{has been identified as}} a DNA methyltransferase homolog, containing all 10 sequence motifs common to all DNA methyltransferases; however, DNMT2 (TRDMT1) does not methylate DNA but instead methylates cytosine-38 in the <b>anticodon</b> loop of aspartic acid transfer RNA.|$|E

25|$|The {{top half}} of tRNA (consisting of the D arm and the {{acceptor}} stem with 5'-terminal phosphate group and 3'-terminal CCA group) and the bottom half (consisting of the T arm and the <b>anticodon</b> arm) are independent units in structure {{as well as in}} function. The top half may have evolved first including the 3'-terminal genomic tag which originally may have marked tRNA-like molecules for replication in early RNA world. The bottom half may have evolved later as an expansion, e. g. as protein synthesis started in RNA world {{and turned it into a}} (ribonucleoprotein world (RNP world). This proposed scenario is called genomic tag hypothesis. In fact, tRNA and tRNA-like aggregates have an important catalytic influence (i. e. as ribozymes) on replication still today. These roles may be regarded as 'molecular (or chemical) fossiles' of RNA world.|$|E
500|$|The {{process of}} synthesizing a protein from an mRNA {{template}} {{is known as}} translation. The mRNA is loaded onto the ribosome and is read three nucleotides at a time by matching each codon to its base pairing <b>anticodon</b> located on a transfer RNA molecule, which carries the amino acid corresponding to the codon it recognizes. The enzyme aminoacyl tRNA synthetase [...] "charges" [...] the tRNA molecules with the correct amino acids. The growing polypeptide is often termed the nascent chain.

2500|$|... tRNAs {{are small}} noncoding RNA chains (74-93 nucleotides) that {{transport}} amino acids to the ribosome. tRNAs have {{a site for}} amino acid attachment, and a site called an <b>anticodon.</b> The <b>anticodon</b> is an RNA triplet complementary to the mRNA triplet that codes for their cargo amino acid.|$|E
50|$|When {{referring}} to DNA transcription, the coding strand is the DNA strand whose base sequence {{corresponds to the}} base sequence of the RNA transcript produced (although with thymine replaced by uracil).

2500|$|EF-Tu {{contributes}} to translational accuracy in three ways. [...] In translation, a fundamental {{problem is that}} near-cognate <b>anticodons</b> have similar binding affinity to a codon as cognate <b>anticodons,</b> such that anticodon-codon binding in the ribosome alone {{is not sufficient to}} maintain high translational fidelity. [...] This is addressed by the ribosome not activating the GTPase activity of EF-Tu if the tRNA in the ribosome's A-site does not match the mRNA codon, thus preferentially increasing the likelihood for the incorrect tRNA to leave the ribosome. [...] Additionally, regardless of tRNA matching, EF-Tu also induces a delay after freeing itself from the aa-tRNA, before the aa-tRNA fully enters the A-site (a process called accommodation). [...] This delay period is a second opportunity for incorrectly charged aa-tRNAs {{to move out of the}} A-site before the incorrect amino acid is irreversibly added to the polypeptide chain. [...] A third mechanism is the less well understood function of EF-Tu to crudely check aa-tRNA associations and reject complexes where the amino acid is not bound to the correct tRNA coding for it.|$|R

2500|$|An <b>anticodon</b> is a unit made up {{of three}} {{nucleotides}} that correspond to the three bases of the codon on the mRNA. Each tRNA contains a distinct [...] <b>anticodon</b> triplet sequence that can base-pair {{to one or more}} codons for an amino acid. Some anticodons can pair with more than one codon due to a phenomenon known as wobble base pairing. Frequently, the first nucleotide of the <b>anticodon</b> is one not found on mRNA: inosine, which can hydrogen bond to more than one base in the corresponding codon position. In the genetic code, it is common for a single amino acid to be specified by all four third-position possibilities, or at least by both pyrimidines and purines; for example, the amino acid glycine is coded for by the codon sequences GGU, GGC, GGA, and GGG. Other modified nucleotides may also appear at the first <b>anticodon</b> position—sometimes known as the [...] "wobble position"—resulting in subtle changes to the genetic code, as for example in mitochondria.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{classes of}} aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are multidomain proteins. [...] In a typical scenario, an aaRS {{consists}} of a catalytic domain (where both the above reactions take place) and an <b>anticodon</b> binding domain (which interacts mostly with the <b>anticodon</b> region of the tRNA and ensures binding of the correct tRNA to the amino acid). [...] In addition, some aaRSs have additional RNA binding domains and editing domains that cleave incorrectly paired aminoacyl-tRNA molecules.|$|E
2500|$|Each tRNA is aminoacylated (or charged) with a {{specific}} amino acid by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. [...] There is normally a single aminoacyl tRNA synthetase for each amino acid, {{despite the fact that}} there can be more than one tRNA, and more than one <b>anticodon,</b> for an amino acid. [...] Recognition of the appropriate tRNA by the synthetases is not mediated solely by the <b>anticodon,</b> and the acceptor stem often plays a prominent role.|$|E
40|$|Motivation: In the bilingual {{world of}} nucleic acids and proteins, usually {{only one of}} the gene’s two DNA strands, namely a sense strand, is protein-coding. The {{preceding}} monolingual RNA world was likely much more strand-symmetric so that both (plus and minus) complementary replicas of ancestral genes could have been used with equal success as first templates (Rodin, Ohno, 1995, 1997; Carter, Duax, 2002). One would expect then for this primordial strand symmetry to be reflected in the genetic code organization. Results: The updated analysis of the current tRNA gene compilation (Sprinzl, Vassilenko, 2005) confirmed and strengthened our previous discovery that in pairs of consensus/ancestral tRNAs with complementary <b>anticodons,</b> their 2 nd bases in the acceptor stem are also complementary (Rodin et al., 1996; Rodin S., Rodin A., 2006). Here we show that, indeed, it might have been an in-frame double-strand coding of RNA genes that has directed the code’s earliest expansion and preserved this fundamental complementary link between the acceptors and the <b>anticodons.</b> Availability: All datasets used in this study and the reconstructed tRNA trees are available from the authors. No proprietary software has been used in this study...|$|R
40|$|In {{distinction}} to single-stranded <b>anticodons</b> {{built of}} G, C, A, and U bases, their presumable double-stranded precursors {{at the first}} three positions of the acceptor stem are composed almost invariably of G-C and C-G base pairs. Thus, the “second” operational RNA code responsible for correct aminoacylation {{seems to be a}} (G,C) code preceding the classic genetic code. Although historically rooted, the two codes were destined to diverge quite early. However, closer inspection revealed that two complementary catalytic domains of class I and class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) multiplied by two, also complementary, G 2 -C 71 and C 2 -G 71 targets in tRNA acceptors, yield four (2 × 2) different modes of recognition. It appears therefore that the core four-column organization of the genetic code, associated with the most conservative central base of <b>anticodons</b> and codons, was in essence predetermined by these four recognition modes of the (G,C) operational code. The general conclusion follows that the genetic code per se looks like a “frozen accident” but only beyond the “ 2 × 2 = 4 ” scope. The four primordial modes of tRNA–aaRS recognition are amenable to direct experimental verification...|$|R
40|$|The nearly {{invariant}} {{nature of}} the 'Universal Genetic Code' attests to its early establishment in evolution and {{to the difficulty of}} altering it now, since so many molecules are required for, and depend upon, faithful translation. Nevertheless, variations on the universal code are known in a handful of genomes. We have found one such variant in diplomonads, an early-diverging eukaryotic lineage. Genes for alpha-tubulin, beta-tubulin and elongation factor 1 alpha (EF- 1 alpha) from two unclassified strains of Hexamitidae were found to contain TAA and TAG (TAR) triplets at positions suggesting a variant code in which TAR codes for glutamine. We found confirmation of this hypothesis by identifying genes encoding glutamine-tRNAs with CUA and UUA <b>anticodons.</b> The alpha-tubulin and EF- 1 alpha genes from two other diplomonads, Spironucleus muris and Hexamita inflata, were also sequenced and shown to contain no such non-canonical codons. However, tRNA genes with the <b>anticodons</b> UUA and CUA were found in H. inflata, suggesting that this diplomonad also uses these codons, albeit infrequently. The high GC content of these genomes and the presence of two isoaccepting tRNAs compound the difficulty of understanding how this variant code arose by strictly neutral means...|$|R
2500|$|While the {{specific}} nucleotide sequence of a mRNA specifies which amino acids {{are incorporated into}} the protein product of the gene from which the mRNA is transcribed, the role of tRNA is to specify which sequence from the genetic code corresponds to which amino acid.

[...] One end of the tRNA matches the genetic code in a three-nucleotide sequence called the <b>anticodon.</b> The <b>anticodon</b> forms three base pairs with a codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis. On {{the other end of the}} tRNA is a covalent attachment to the amino acid that corresponds to the <b>anticodon</b> sequence.

2500|$|The binding of an aa-tRNA to EF-Tu • GTP {{allows for}} the ternary complex to be {{translocated}} to the A-site of an active ribosome, in which the <b>anticodon</b> of the tRNA binds to the codon of the mRNA.

[...] As such, the ribosome functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for EF-Tu. [...] Upon GTP hydrolysis, the conformation of EF-Tu changes drastically and dissociates from the aa-tRNA and ribosome complex.

40|$|Abstract Background Accurate {{amino acid}} {{insertion}} during peptide elongation requires tRNAs loaded by cognate amino acids and that <b>anticodons</b> match codons. However, tRNA misloading {{does not necessarily}} cause misinsertions: misinsertion is avoided when <b>anticodons</b> mismatch codons coding for misloaded amino acids. Presentation of the hypothesis Occasional compensation of misacylation by codon-anticodon mismatch necessarily occurs. Putatively, occasional error compensation may be enhanced beyond the random combination of independent errors in tRNA loading and codon-anticodon interactions: tRNA misacylation might alter potentials for codon-anticodon mismatches, perhaps specifically increasing potentials for mismatching those codons coding for the misacylated non-cognate amino acid. This hypothetical phenomenon is called 'error coordination', in distinction from 'error compensation' that assumes independence between misacylation and mismatch. Testing the hypothesis Eventually, the hypothesis should be tested for each combination of amino acid misacylation and codon-anticodon mismatch, by comparing stabilities or frequencies of mismatched codon-anticodon duplexes formed by tRNAs loaded by their cognate amino acid with stabilities formed by that tRNA when misloaded with the amino acid coded by the mismatched codon. Competitive mismatching experiments between misloaded and correctly loaded tRNAs could also be useful, yet more sophisticated experiments. Implications of the hypothesis Detecting error coordination implies estimating error compensation, which also promotes protein synthesis accuracy. Hence {{even in the absence}} of evidence for error coordination, experiments would yield very useful insights into misacylation and mismatch processes. In case experiments consider post-transcriptional RNA modifications (especially at wobble positions), results on codon-anticodon mismatches would enable significant improvements and sophistications of secondary structure prediction softwares. Positive results would show that protein translation enhances accuracies of products, not of single steps in the production. Ancient translational machineries putatively optimized error coordination, especially before tRNA editing by tRNA synthetases evolved: few primitive, but functionally versatile tRNA species perhaps executed low accuracy translation. Systems artificially designed/selected for low complexity and high efficiency could make use of this property for <b>anticodons</b> with high levels of error compensation and coordination. </p...|$|R
