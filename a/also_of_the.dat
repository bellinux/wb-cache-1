5|$|The use of crests {{was once}} {{restricted}} {{to those of}} 'tournament rank', i.e. knights and above, but in modern times nearly all personal arms include crests.

Some heraldists are <b>also</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opinion that crests, as personal devices, are not suited for use by corporate bodies, but this is not widely observed.|$|E
