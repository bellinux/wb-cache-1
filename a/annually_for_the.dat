5|$|Nichols and Cooper {{came to an}} {{agreement}} about the Solway Bridge. Although it was in Knox County, Anderson County had contributed $27,000 towards its construction.

Nichols negotiated a deal in which Knox County was paid $25,000 <b>annually</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> bridge, of which $6,000 was {{to be used to}} maintain the access road. Judge Thomas L. Seeber then threatened to close the Edgemoor Bridge unless Anderson County was similarly compensated. An agreement was reached under which Anderson County received $10,000 for the bridge and $200 per month. Knox County did not keep its side of the bargain to maintain the road, which was damaged by heavy traffic and became impassable after torrential rains in 1944. The Army was forced to spend $5,000 per month on road works in Knox County.|$|E

5|$|The {{ground floor}} of Manjakamiadana was divided into two vast rooms with {{furniture}} and decor that reflected European influence but with placement of objects respecting the norms of Malagasy cosmology. Following the reign of RadamaII, the building was no longer inhabited but instead was reserved for state occasions. The northernmost of these two rooms {{was the site of}} the signing of important trade treaties with British and American dignitaries. It was also opened <b>annually</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> celebration of the Fandroana (Royal Bath) ceremony. Following the imposition of French colonial rule, Manjakamiadana was transformed in 1897 into L'Ecole Le Myre de Vilers (Le Myre de Vilers School), a training centre for Malagasy civil servants employed by the French colonial regime. When the purpose of the building changed, the elevation of the main hall's floor was raised by building a platform on top of the original wooden floor.|$|E
