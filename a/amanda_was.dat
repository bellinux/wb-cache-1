5|$|To {{reinforce}} {{the connection with}} Love's Last Shift and capitalise on its unexpected success, Vanbrugh designed the central roles of Loveless, Amanda, and Sir Novelty for the same actors: John Verbruggen, Jane Rogers, and Colley Cibber. Keeping Rogers as <b>Amanda</b> <b>was</b> not a problem, since she was not an actress that the companies fought over, but holding on to John Verbruggen and Colley Cibber posed challenges, to which Rich rose with energetic campaigns of bribery and re-seduction. Filling {{the rest of the}} large Relapse cast presented a varied palette of problems, which forced some unconventional emergency casting.|$|E

[...] He loved Amanda, but his absences due to touring and fondness for practical jokes made their relationship uneasy when she was very young.

500|$|The Creative Assembly wanted Alien: Isolation {{to have a}} {{story that}} was {{closely related to the}} film. As a result, the team decided to explore a story set 15 years after the events of the film which would involve Ellen Ripley's {{daughter}} and the Nostromos flight recorder. Writer Will Porter explained that the process of creating a backstory for <b>Amanda</b> <b>was</b> [...] "refreshing" [...] as he felt that she was an overlooked character of the Alien universe. The derelict ship the Nostromo crew previously found in the film was also included in the game since the developers felt it was a central point in the Alien canon. Actress Sigourney Weaver agreed to reprise her role as Ellen Ripley to voice small sections throughout the game because she felt that the story was interesting and true to the film. Along with Weaver, the original Alien cast, which includes Tom Skerritt, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton, and Yaphet Kotto, reprised their roles for the game's separate downloadable content missions, marking the first time they were brought back together since the release of the film. All the characters were created with 3D face scans.|$|E

2500|$|After Carita's death, Marsh {{continued}} {{to pay the}} quarterly share of the profits to Carita's younger sister Amanda, who had moved in with the Belknaps, ostensibly to hold as a trust fund {{for the benefit of}} Carita's child. This profiteering arrangement between Amanda and Marsh was all done with Belknap's full knowledge and consent. [...] After Carita's child died in June 1871, Amanda left to tour Europe, and Belknap {{continued to}} take the quarterly bribery payments until December 1873, when Amanda returned and became Belknap's third wife. [...] <b>Amanda</b> <b>was</b> a beautiful young socialite; intending to keep the modest fortune she inherited from her family while also attaining a high position in Washington society, she required Belknap to sign a prenuptial agreement. Belknap rented a new large house for Amanda on G Street, which had been built by Orville Babcock, President Grant's personal secretary. From that time onward, Belknap and Amanda continued to accept Marsh's quarterly payments. <b>Amanda</b> <b>was</b> considered to be more self-indulgent then her sister Carita, donning gorgeous gowns, jewelry and other accessories for parties and other events, and was dubiously called the [...] "spendthrift belle" [...] by Washington society. The Belknaps extravagant lifestyle entertaining Washington society holding lavish parties created envy among Democrats and Washingtonians. [...] However, it was not publicly known that the Belknaps were receiving kickbacks until February 1876, when the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives launched an investigation, which discovered that Belknap and his wives had received about $20,000 in bribes from Marsh.|$|E

2500|$|Bankhead was {{director}} Irving Rapper's first {{choice for the}} role of Amanda in the film version of Tennessee William's The Glass Menagerie. Laurette Taylor, who originated the role of <b>Amanda,</b> <b>was</b> an idol of Bankhead's and also an alcoholic, whose brilliant performance in the original Broadway production reversed years of career decline. Rapper called Bankhead's screen test the greatest performance he had ever seen: [...] "I {{thought she was going to}} be difficult, but she was like a child, so sweet and lovely. I was absolutely floored by her performance. It's the greatest test I've ever made or seen in my life. I couldn't believe I was seeing such reality. Bankhead was absolutely natural, so moving, so touching without even trying. The crew was stunned, too." [...] But studio head Jack Warner rejected the idea because of his fear of Tallulah's drinking; though she promised not to drink during shooting, he refused to give her the part. The role was given to Gertrude Lawrence instead, whose acting was panned by most critics.|$|E
