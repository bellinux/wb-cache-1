500|$|Owing to the {{suppression}} by Serbia of Apis's confession {{and of the}} Salonika trial transcripts historians did not initially link Malobabić closely to the Sarajevo attack. [...] Apis's confession, however, states that [...] "I engaged Malobabić to organize the assassination {{on the occasion of}} the announced arrival of Franz Ferdinand to Sarajevo." [...] At the Salonika trial, Colonel Ljubomir Vulović (head of the Serbian Frontiers Service) testified: [...] 'In 1914 on occasion of my official trip from Loznica to Belgrade, I received a letter at the General Staff [...] noting that agents of Malobabić would come and a teacher whose name I don't recall (Danilo Ilić was a teacher but it is unclear if the teacher in question was Ilić as Ilić can be placed in Brod but not Loznica) so I could sent [...] them into Bosnia.' Because of that 'I went to Loznica and either that day or very soon afterwards sent Rade and that teacher into Bosnia.' [...] Soon thereafter occurred the Sarajevo assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand." [...] On the eve of his execution, Malobabić told a priest: [...] "They ordered me to go to Sarajevo when that assassination was to take place, and when everything was over, they ordered me to come back and fulfill other missions, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> outbreak of the war." [...] Vladimir Dedijer in The Road to Sarajevo presented additional testimonial evidence that Malobabić arrived in Sarajevo on the eve of the Sarajevo attack and gave the final go ahead for the operation to Danilo Ilić. This meshes with Dedijer's theory that Djuro Ŝarac had given instructions to Ilić on 16 June cancelling the assassination. [...] Soon after their confessions, Serbia executed Malobabić, Vulović, and Apis on false charges. Serbia published no clarifications of their confessions with regards to the Sarajevo attack.|$|E
2500|$|The {{sections}} build {{with more}} guitar layers, each complementary to the intro, with the drums entering at 4:18. [...] The extended Jimmy Page guitar solo in the song's final section was {{played for the}} recording on a 1959 Fender Telecaster {{given to him by}} Jeff Beck (an instrument he used extensively with the Yardbirds) plugged into a Supro amplifier, although in an interview he gave to Guitar World magazine, Page also claimed, [...] "It could have been a Marshall, but I can't remember". Three different improvised solos were recorded, with Page agonising about deciding which to keep. Page later revealed, [...] "I did have the first phrase worked out, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> link phrase. I did check them out beforehand before the tape ran." [...] The other guitar parts were played using a Harmony Sovereign H1260 acoustic guitar and a Fender Electric XII guitar (a 12-string guitar that was plugged directly to the soundboard); these can be heard on the left and right recording channels respectively. For live versions, Page switched to a Heritage Cherry Gibson EDS-1275 6/12 Doubleneck guitar. The final progression is a i-VII-VI (natural minor) progression (Am-G-F), a mainstay of rock music.|$|E

The first day of celebrations started with a pancake breakfast <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> parade of locally designed and commercial floats around the town. The parade procession began at the Community Rink on St. Louis Avenue to Willow Bunch Street, Broad Avenue, Principal Street and then finally down St. Catherine Street which meets St. Louis Avenue. The first prize for float went to the Willow Bunch Kinsmen and Kettle and second prize was a tie between the Willow Bunch Manoir Hotel and the Kirby Family entry from Coronach. An art display featuring Rosetown Painting and Photography {{was presented at the}} Willow Bunch School. Day one of the activities also included pony rides for children, ball games for adults and youngsters, an afternoon tea at the Senior Center, a barbecue dinner at the skating rink and then to end the day there was a dance with music by The Big Muddy Ramblers.
