60|$|Dick Four {{cocked his}} head critically, <b>and</b> <b>squinted</b> down a large red nose.|$|E
6000|$|But Stalky {{puffed out}} his cheeks <b>and</b> <b>squinted</b> down {{his nose in}} the style of Panurge, and all he said was, [...] "Oh, you abject burblers!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Hurrah! We've got a squirrel!' Mr. Man's boy Tommy {{cried as}} {{he picked up the}} box <b>and</b> <b>squinted</b> into it. 'Hurry and we'll put him into that cage we made yesterday!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why do {{you keep}} moving about then," [...] he said, [...] "making faces and all that--sneering <b>and</b> <b>squinting,</b> while I am {{painting}} you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{told you}} they was all thumbs," [...] he grimaced, {{holding up his}} hand <b>and</b> <b>squinting</b> at it with the {{fraction}} of sight remaining to him.|$|R
25|$|Major parklands and {{waterways}} in Burnaby include Central Park, Robert Burnaby Park, Kensington Park, Burnaby Mountain, Still Creek, the Brunette River, Burnaby Lake, Deer Lake, <b>and</b> <b>Squint</b> Lake.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Letts started <b>and</b> <b>squinted</b> reproachfully {{at the top}} of her hat. Then {{he turned}} and looked at Mrs. Green in search of the {{required}} information. [...] "He was shipwrecked," [...] said Mrs. Green.|$|E
60|$|None of 'em {{seemed to}} be in a hurry. Bill Jones took it up and bit it, and rang it on the table <b>and</b> <b>squinted</b> at it, and then he bit it agin, and turned round and asked Joe Barlcomb wot was wrong with it.|$|E
60|$|Dan did not answer, but, {{running to}} the closet, brought out {{the best of the}} guns {{belonging}} to his father. Leaping up to the loft, he opened the firing-hole fronting the direction Wolf Ear had taken, <b>and</b> <b>squinted</b> through. But the Indian horseman was long since out of sight.|$|E
5000|$|James Finlayson, a balding, mustachioed Scotsman {{known for}} {{displays}} of indignation <b>and</b> <b>squinting,</b> pop-eyed [...] "double takes," [...] made 33 appearances and is perhaps their most celebrated foil.|$|R
6000|$|... "A spell!" [...] said Arblaster, half awakening, <b>and</b> <b>squinting</b> upon Dick {{with one}} eye. [...] "Aroint thee! no spells! I {{be a good}} Christian. Ask my man Tom, else." ...|$|R
5000|$|Because of {{his fame}} on History Channel's Ancient Aliens, {{he became a}} popular Internet meme, with his hands {{out in front of}} him <b>and</b> <b>squinting,</b> usually with a caption {{concluding}} with [...] "Aliens." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Four-thousand-dollar {{stock of}} goods!" [...] gasped Keogh, in ecstasy. [...] "Talk about coals to Newcastle! Why didn't he take a ship-load of palm-leaf fans to Spitzbergen {{while he was}} about it? Saw the old codger on the beach. You {{ought to have been}} there when he put on his specs <b>and</b> <b>squinted</b> at the five hundred or so barefooted {{citizens}} standing around." ...|$|E
60|$|As {{he spoke}} he glared defiantly at the older officer, who calmly {{proceeded}} {{to translate the}} speech to the colonel. Carg reported that it was translated verbatim. Then the general sat back <b>and</b> <b>squinted</b> at his companion, who seemed fairly bewildered by the threat. Patsy caught the young officer smothering a smile, but neither of them interrupted the silence that followed.|$|E
60|$|What {{were his}} own {{feelings}} about himself at that triumphant moment? Fain [gladly] would his dogs have known, as breathing heavily and wiping their cutlasses, they gathered at a discreet distance from his hook, <b>and</b> <b>squinted</b> through their ferret eyes at this extraordinary man. Elation {{must have been in}} his heart, but his face did not reflect it: ever a dark and solitary enigma, he stood aloof from his followers in spirit as in substance.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm {{glad you}}'re wet,' said Quilp, {{snatching}} it, <b>and</b> <b>squinting</b> at her. 'I'm glad you're cold. I'm glad {{you lost your}} way. I'm glad your eyes are red with crying. It does my heart good to see your little nose so pinched and frosty.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'You {{might have}} listened to me and saved {{yourself}} trouble,' says she, climbing over the rail <b>and</b> <b>squinting</b> along for'ard <b>and</b> seeing the first shackle flip out and stop. 'There's fifteen fathom,' says she; 'you may as well turn your men to and heave up.' ...|$|R
60|$|As {{he stood}} there holding out his paws to Toby as if asking him to extract the spines, <b>and</b> <b>squinting</b> down now <b>and</b> then at those in his face, the boys {{did not try to}} {{restrain}} their laughter, which appeared to make the inquisitive monkey very angry.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, they're drowned," [...] {{continued}} Wicks; [...] "drowned alongside {{trying to}} lower a boat. We {{had a bit}} of a squall last night; that's how we got ashore." [...] He ran <b>and</b> <b>squinted</b> at the compass. [...] "Squall out of nor'-nor'west-half-west; blew hard; every one in a mess, falls jammed, and Holdorsen and Wallen spilt overboard. See? Clear your blooming heads!" [...] He was in his jacket now, and spoke with a feverish impatience and contention that rang like anger.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ginger {{sat up in}} bed {{and stared}} at ’im; then ’e bent ’is ’ead down <b>and</b> <b>squinted</b> at ’is chest, and next moment ’e was out of bed and all three of ’em was holding ’im down on the floor to prevent ’im {{breaking}} the tattooer’s neck which ’e’d set ’is ’eart upon doing, and explaining to ’im that the tattooer {{was at the top of}} ’is profession, and that it was only by a stroke of luck ’e had got ’im. And Sam reminded ’im of wot ’e ’ad said the night before, and said he’d live to thank ’im for it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} don't neglect your school work, though, Carl." [...] Mrs. Cowles held the scarf nearer the lamp <b>and</b> <b>squinted</b> at it, {{deliberately}} and solemnly, through the eye-glasses that lorded it atop her severe nose. A headachy scent of moth-balls {{was in the}} dull air. She forbiddingly moved {{the shade of the}} lamp about a tenth of an inch. She removed some non-existent dust from the wrought-iron standard. Her gestures said that the lamp was decidedly more chic than the pink-shaded hanging lamps, raised and lowered on squeaking chains, which characterized most Joralemon living-rooms. She glanced at the red lambrequin over the nearest window. The moth-ball smell grew more stupifying.|$|E
40|$|An 8 -year-old, spayed, female Japanese Akita was {{presented}} for acute blindness, cloudy eyes, <b>and</b> <b>squinting.</b> A presumptive diagnosis of uveodermatologic syndrome was made. Therapy with oral prednisone, topical prednisolone, and oral azathioprine {{was successful in}} eliminating most of the clinical signs and the Akita now has complete restoration of vision...|$|R
60|$|And in {{one special}} matter was he either eminently miserable, or otherwise: {{for all his}} {{multiplicity}} of wives, he had never an heir. Not his, the proud paternal glance of the Grand Turk Solyman, looking round upon a hundred sons, all bone of his bone, <b>and</b> <b>squinting</b> with his squint.|$|R
5000|$|Duane {{is remembered}} for {{contributions}} {{made in the}} study of the eye and vision, including aspects such as refraction, accommodation <b>and</b> <b>squint.</b> He also performed extensive analysis involving movement of the extraocular muscles. In 1897 he published a highly regarded treatise titled [...] "A new classification of the motor anomalies of the eye".|$|R
6000|$|About {{four o'clock}} the red-haired {{young man and}} his pretty little wife came up to call for us. She looked so charming <b>and</b> <b>squinted</b> so enchantingly, one could hardly believe she was not as simple and {{innocent}} as she seemed to be. She tripped down to the Seldon boat-house, with Charles by her side, giggling and squinting her best, and then helped her husband to get the skiff ready. As she did so, Charles sidled up to me. [...] "Sey," [...] he whispered, [...] "I'm an old hand, and I'm not readily taken in. I've been talking to that girl, and upon my soul I think she's all right. She's a charming little lady. We may be mistaken after all, of course, about young Granton. In any case, it's well for the present to be courteous. A most important option! If it's really he, we must do nothing to annoy him or let him see we suspect him." ...|$|E
60|$|At last {{he found}} inside {{a book on}} motor fuels the wad of copy-paper on which he had scrawled notes with a broad, soft pencil, {{and he began to}} dictate a short article on air-cooling. Una was terrified lest she be unable to keep up, but she had read recent numbers of the Gazette thoroughly, she had practised the symbols for motor technologies, and she was not troubled by being watched. Indeed, Babson seemed to have enough to do in keeping his restless spirit from {{performing}} the dismaying feat of leaping straight out of his body. He leaned back in his revolving desk-chair with a complaining squawk from the spring, he closed his eyes, put his fingers together piously, then seized the chair-arms and held them, while he cocked one eye open <b>and</b> <b>squinted</b> at a large alarm-clock on the desk. He sighed profoundly, bent forward, gazed at his ankle, and reached forward to scratch it. All this time he was dictating, now rapidly, now gurgling and grunting while he paused to find a word.|$|E
60|$|Old Harry Verney, {{the other}} keeper, was a {{character}} in his way, and a very bad character too, {{though he was a}} patriarch among all the gamekeepers of the vale. He was a short, wiry, bandy-legged, ferret-visaged old man, with grizzled hair, and a wizened face tanned brown and purple by constant exposure. Between rheumatism and constant handling the rod and gun, his fingers were crooked like a hawk's claws. He kept his left eye always shut, apparently to save trouble in shooting; <b>and</b> <b>squinted,</b> and sniffed, and peered, with a stooping back and protruded chin, as if he were perpetually on the watch for fish, flesh, and fowl, vermin and Christian. The friendship between himself and the Scotch terrier at his heels would have been easily explained by Lessing, for in the transmigration of souls the spirit of Harry Verney had evidently once animated a dog of that breed. He was dressed in a huge thick fustian jacket, scratched, stained, and patched, with bulging, greasy pockets; a cast of flies round a battered hat, riddled with shot-holes, a dog- whistle at his button-hole, and an old gun cut short over his arm, bespoke his business.|$|E

5000|$|In {{his review}} for The New York Times, Vincent Canby noted that The Gypsy Moths had the semblance of an [...] "action film," [...] but [...] "if {{this were a}} real action movie, I would be {{required}} to do little except look up at the sky <b>and</b> <b>squint.</b> Unfortunately, there isn't that much skydiving." ...|$|R

60|$|The {{opinion was}} {{not the result of}} hasty consideration, for which indeed there was no {{opportunity}} at that time, as the child came directly, and soon occupied herself in preparations for giving Kit a writing lesson, of which it seemed he had a couple every week, and one regularly on that evening, to the great mirth and enjoyment both of himself and his instructress. To relate how {{it was a long time}} before his modesty could be so far prevailed upon as it admit of his sitting down in the parlour, in the presence of an unknown gentleman--how, when he did set down, he tucked up his sleeves and squared his elbows and put his face close to the copy-book <b>and</b> <b>squinted</b> horribly at the lines--how, from the very first moment of having the pen in his hand, he began to wallow in blots, and to daub himself with ink up to the very roots of his hair--how, if he did by accident form a letter properly, he immediately smeared it out again with his arm in his preparations to make another--how, at every fresh mistake, there was a fresh burst of merriment from the child and louder and not less hearty laugh from poor Kit himself--and how there was all the way through, notwithstanding, a gentle wish on her part to teach, and an anxious desire on his to learn--to relate all these particulars would no doubt occupy more space and time than they deserve. It will be sufficient to say that the lesson was given--that evening passed and night came on--that the old man again grew restless and impatient--that he quitted the house secretly at the same hour as before--and that the child was once more left alone within its gloomy walls.|$|E
60|$|She congratulated herself {{still more}} on observing {{in the course}} of days that Mr Verloc seemed to be taking kindly to Stevie’s companionship. Now, when ready to go out for his walk, Mr Verloc called aloud to the boy, in the spirit, no doubt, in which a man invites the {{attendance}} of the household dog, though, of course, in a different manner. In the house Mr Verloc could be detected staring curiously at Stevie a good deal. His own demeanour had changed. Taciturn still, he was not so listless. Mrs Verloc thought that he was rather jumpy at times. It might have been regarded as an improvement. As to Stevie, he moped no longer {{at the foot of the}} clock, but muttered to himself in corners instead in a threatening tone. When asked “What is it you’re saying, Stevie?” he merely opened his mouth, <b>and</b> <b>squinted</b> at his sister. At odd times he clenched his fists without apparent cause, and when discovered in solitude would be scowling at the wall, with the sheet of paper and the pencil given him for drawing circles lying blank and idle on the kitchen table. This was a change, but it was no improvement. Mrs Verloc including all these vagaries under the general definition of excitement, began to fear that Stevie was hearing more than was good for him of her husband’s conversations with his friends. During his “walks” Mr Verloc, of course, met and conversed with various persons. It could hardly be otherwise. His walks were an integral part of his outdoor activities, which his wife had never looked deeply into. Mrs Verloc felt that the position was delicate, but she faced it with the same impenetrable calmness which impressed and even astonished the customers of the shop and made the other visitors keep their distance a little wonderingly. No! She feared that there were things not good for Stevie to hear of, she told her husband. It only excited the poor boy, because he could not help them being so. Nobody could.|$|E
50|$|Butt-Head has {{a severe}} overbite, wears dental braces, and has brown hair <b>and</b> <b>squinted</b> eyes. His top gums are often exposed and he speaks nasally {{with a deep}} voice and a slight lisp, {{repeatedly}} punctuating his speech with his trademark laugh (Uh huh, huh huh). He is usually shown wearing an AC/DC T-shirt. In merchandising appearances, his shirt displays the word 'Skull', to avoid licensing issues.|$|E
5000|$|TV Guide, echoing Canby, wrote, [...] "A great cast is {{primarily}} wasted in this gory, below-average, and overlong film. The script {{could have been}} written for a silent film to fit with Bronson's traditional man-of-few-words image (in fact, more grunts <b>and</b> <b>squint</b> than words)...As usual Bronson must rely upon the conviction that there are viewers who find silence eloquent." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{importance}} of the event does not count. They gaze with equal interest and absorption at a chorus girl or at a man painting a liver pill sign. They will form as deep a cordon around {{a man with a}} club-foot as they will around a balked automobile. They have the furor rubberendi. They are optical gluttons, feasting and fattening on the misfortunes of their fellow beings. They gloat and pore <b>and</b> glare <b>and</b> <b>squint</b> <b>and</b> stare with their fishy eyes like goggle-eyed perch at the book baited with calamity.|$|R

There is 14th-century glass in the east window and the chancel fittings were renewed in 1956 by Louis Osman.|$|R
