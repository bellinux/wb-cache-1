These remarks are prefaced in the 'Encyclopaedia' article by the following statement: 'No telegraphic testing ought in future to be accepted in any department of telegraphic business which has not this definite character; although it is only within the last year that convenient instruments for working, in <b>absolute</b> <b>measure,</b> have been introduced at all, and the whole system of <b>absolute</b> <b>measure</b> is still almost unknown to practical electricians.' ...|$|E

60|$|A {{particular}} {{result of}} great importance in respect to testing {{is referred to as}} follows in the 'Encyclopaedia' article: 'The importance of having results thus stated in <b>absolute</b> <b>measure</b> is illustrated by the circumstance, that the writer has been able at once to compare them, in the manner stated in a preceding paragraph, with his own previous deductions from the testings of the Atlantic cable during its manufacture in 1857, and with Weber's measurements of the specific resistance of copper.' It has now become universally adapted - first of all in England; twenty-two years later by Germany, the country of its birth; and by France and Italy, and all the other countries of Europe and America - practically the whole scientific world - at the Electrical Congress in Paris in the years 1882 and 1884.|$|E
60|$|But {{there is}} still {{stronger}} evidence of the long duration of certain types. I have already stated that, as we work {{our way through the}} great series of the Tertiary formations, we find many species of animals identical with those which live at the present day, diminishing in numbers, it is true, but still existing, in a certain proportion, in the oldest of the Tertiary rocks. Furthermore, when we examine the rocks of the Cretaceous epoch, we find the remains of some animals which the closest scrutiny cannot show to be, in any important respect, different from those which live at the present time. That is the case with one of the cretaceous lamp-shells (Terebratula) which has continued to exist unchanged, or with insignificant variations, down to the present day. Such is the case with the Globigerinæ, the skeletons of which, aggregated together, form a large proportion of our English chalk. Those Globigerinæ can be traced down to the Globigerinæ which live at the surface of the present great oceans, and the remains of which, falling {{to the bottom of the}} sea give rise to a chalky mud. Hence it must be admitted that certain existing species of animals show no distinct sign of modification, or transformation, in the course of a lapse of time as great as that which carries us back to the Cretaceous period; and which, whatever its <b>absolute</b> <b>measure,</b> is certainly vastly greater than thirty thousand years.|$|E

"The Ambassadors" [...] had been, all conveniently, [...] "arranged for"; {{its first}} {{appearance}} was from month to month, in the North American Review during 1903, and I had been open from far back to any pleasant provocation for ingenuity that might reside in one's actively adopting--so {{as to make}} it, in its way, a small compositional law--recurrent breaks and resumptions. I had {{made up my mind}} here regularly to exploit and enjoy these often rather rude jolts--having found, as I believed an admirable way to it; yet every question of form and pressure, I easily remember, paled {{in the light of the}} major propriety, recognised as soon as really weighed; that of employing but one centre and keeping it all within my hero's compass. The thing was to be so much this worthy's intimate adventure that even the projection of his consciousness upon it from beginning to end without intermission or deviation would probably still leave a part of its value for him, and a fortiori for ourselves, unexpressed. I might, however, express every grain of it that there would be room for--on condition of contriving a splendid particular economy. Other persons in no small number were to people the scene, and each with his or her axe to grind, his or her situation to treat, his or her coherency not to fail of, his or her relation to my leading motive, in a word, to establish and carry on. But Strether's sense of these things, and Strether's only, should avail me for showing them; I should know them but through his more or less groping knowledge of them, since his very gropings would figure among his most interesting motions, and a full observance of the rich rigour I speak of would give me more of the effect I should be most [...] "after" [...] than all other possible observances together. It would give me a large unity, and that in turn would crown me with the grace to which the enlightened story-teller will at any time, for his interest, sacrifice if need be all other graces whatever. I refer of course to the grace of intensity, which there are ways of signally achieving and ways of signally missing--as we see it, all round us, helplessly and woefully missed. Not that it isn't, on the other hand, a virtue eminently subject to appreciation--there being no strict, no <b>absolute</b> <b>measure</b> of it; so that one may hear it acclaimed where it has quite escaped one's perception, and see it unnoticed where one has gratefully hailed it. After all of which I am not sure, either, that the immense amusement of the whole cluster of difficulties so arrayed may not operate, for the fond fabulist, when judicious not less than fond, as his best of determinants. That charming principle is always there, at all events, to keep interest fresh: it is a principle, we remember, essentially ravenous, without scruple and without mercy, appeased with no cheap nor easy nourishment. It enjoys the costly sacrifice and rejoices thereby in the very odour of difficulty--even as ogres, with their [...] "Fee-faw-fum!" [...] rejoice in the smell of the blood of Englishmen.|$|E
40|$|Data {{from medical}} {{research}} is typically summarized with {{various types of}} outcome measures. We present three {{arguments in favor of}} absolute over relative outcome measures. The first argument is from cognitive bias: relative measures promote the reference class fallacy and the overestimation of treatment effectiveness. The second argument is decision-theoretic: <b>absolute</b> <b>measures</b> are superior to relative measures for making a decision between interventions. The third argument is causal: interpreted as measures of causal strength, <b>absolute</b> <b>measures</b> satisfy a set of desirable properties, but relative <b>measures</b> don't. <b>Absolute</b> outcome <b>measures</b> outperform relative measures on all counts.

The notion of <b>absolute</b> dispersion <b>measure</b> shares some properties {{with the notion of}} multidistance introduced and analyzed by Mart´ın and Mayor in several recent papers. We compare <b>absolute</b> dispersion <b>measures</b> and multidistances and we establish that these two notions are compatible by showing some functions that are simultaneously <b>absolute</b> dispersion <b>measures</b> and multidistances.

50|$|Absolute {{poverty is}} the level of poverty as defined in terms of the minimal {{requirements}} necessary to afford minimal standards of food, clothing, health care and shelter. For the measure to be absolute, the line must be the same in different countries, cultures, and technological levels. Such an <b>absolute</b> <b>measure</b> should look only at the individual's power to consume and it should be independent of any changes in income distribution. The intuition behind an <b>absolute</b> <b>measure</b> is that mere survival takes essentially the same amount of resources across the world and that everybody should be subject to the same standards if meaningful comparisons of policies and progress are to be made. Notice that if everyone's real income in an economy increases, and the income distribution does not change, absolute poverty will decline.|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} the {{relationship}} between risk factors and outcomes is important both in etiological and prognostic research. To assess the strength of a given risk factor-outcome relationship we use measures that are calculated in relative and absolute terms. Risk ratio, incidence rate ratio and odds ratio are relative measures of this relationship. Risk difference (or attributable risk) and rate difference (or attributable rate) are <b>absolute</b> <b>measures</b> of the same relationship. Risk difference and rate difference are calculated by subtracting the risk and the incidence rate in exposed individuals from that in unexposed individuals, respectively. The choice of these measures depends on the study aim. Relative measures are commonly used in etiological studies while <b>absolute</b> <b>measures</b> are mainly used in public health research.
