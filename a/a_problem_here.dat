25|$|Wood burning: when wood is burned, it {{is usually}} best to dry it first. Damage from {{shrinkage}} is not <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>here,</b> and the drying may proceed more rapidly than {{in the case of}} drying for woodworking purposes. Moisture affects the burning process, with unburnt hydrocarbons going up the chimney. If a 50% wet log is burnt at high temperature, with good heat extraction from the exhaust gas leading to a 100°C exhaust temperature, about 5% of the energy of the log is wasted through evaporating and heating the water vapour. With condensers, the efficiency can be further increased; but, for the normal stove, the key to burning wet wood is to burn it very hot, perhaps starting fire with dry wood.|$|E

The attack occurred at 7:45 pm near the municipal docks. At the time of the attack, the 56th Infantry Battalion had been stationed in Zihuatanejo, mostly to interdict the traffic in arms, drugs and stolen vehicles. The grenade attack on the security headquarters was followed by a highway ambush that killed four policemen. Kidnapping of Mexican citizens has been <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>here</b> as well.

25|$|On March 19, 1944 the Germans invaded Hungary and Gestapo chief Adolf Eichmann {{immediately}} {{organized the}} round-up, ghettoization, and deportation of Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz. The Klausenburg ghetto was established on May 1, 1944, and was liquidated via six transports to Auschwitz between late May and early June. Knowing that the Gestapo targeted community leaders first, the Rebbe hid {{in an open}} grave in a cemetery for several weeks. He then fled {{to the town of}} Nagybánya, where he was conscripted into a forced-labor camp along with 5000 other Hungarian Jews. Though hunger was not <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>here</b> (the barbed-wire enclosure had a back exit through which Jews could buy bread and milk from non-Jews) the Hungarian soldiers constantly badgered and searched inmates for their valuables. The Rebbe shaved his beard as authorized by the Hungarian Chief Orthodox Rabbinate. He continued to conduct prayer services and even a Shabbat tisch. Conditions were not harsh, and he and many prisoners bribed the authorities to refrain from labor.|$|E

60|$|Sir,--The Peninsula of Mulinuu was {{claimed by}} the German firm; and in case their claim should be found good, they had granted to the Samoan Government an option to buy at a certain figure. Hereon stand the houses of our officials, in {{particular}} that of the Chief Justice. It has long been <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>here</b> whether this gentleman paid any rent, {{and the problem is}} now solved; the Chief Justice of Samoa was a squatter. On the ground that the Government was about to purchase the peninsula, he occupied a house; on the ground that the Germans were about to sell it, he refused to pay them any rent. The firm seemed to have no remedy but to summon the squatter before himself, and hear over again from the official what they had heard already from the disastrous tenant. But even in Samoa an ingenious man, inspired by annoyance, may find means of self-protection. The house was no part of the land, nor included in the option; the firm put it up for sale; and the Government, under pain of seeing the Chief Justice houseless, was obliged to buy it.|$|E
