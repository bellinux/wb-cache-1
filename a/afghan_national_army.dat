5|$|On October 3, 2009, {{according}} to a report published by U.S. Army historian Richard S. Lowry, Taliban fighters launched a coordinated attack on the outpost from three sides at about 06:00, capturing its ammunition depot. Some 300 fighters participated in the attack armed with a recoilless rifle, rocket-propelled grenades, mortars, machine guns, and small arms, badly outnumbering the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) presence of about 85 U.S. Army, <b>Afghan</b> <b>National</b> <b>Army</b> and Latvian Army soldiers, and the 35 Afghan soldiers who abandoned their positions. It would later be known as the Battle of Kamdesh.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Musa Qala (also Qaleh or Qal'eh) was a British led {{military}} action in Helmand Province, southern Afghanistan, launched by the <b>Afghan</b> <b>National</b> <b>Army</b> and the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) against the Taliban on 7 December 2007. After three days of intense fighting, the Taliban retreated into the mountains on 10 December. Musa Qala was officially reported captured on 12 December, with Afghan Army troops pushing into the town centre.|$|E
5|$|The Taliban {{surrounded}} the remote base and its observation post, attacking it from Quam and surrounding farmland. They destroyed {{much of the}} U.S. heavy munitions, broke through American lines, and entered the main base before being repelled by artillery and aircraft. The United States claimed to have killed at least 21 Taliban fighters {{for the loss of}} nine U.S. soldiers killed and 27 wounded, and four <b>Afghan</b> <b>National</b> <b>Army</b> (ANA) soldiers wounded.|$|E

The camp also controls highly specialized battalion-level task forces built around Army Special Forces, infantry, a Marine special operations battalion and a Navy SEAL team.|$|R
5|$|The {{strategic}} {{purpose of}} controlling Musa Qala is both to squeeze Taliban operations in south-western Afghanistan {{and to serve}} as a symbol of <b>Afghan</b> <b>National</b> <b>Army</b> and ISAF strength; the town had taken on iconic proportions, according to British officials. The Taliban, however, continue to enjoy significant civilian support despite their atrocities and the broader campaign to win over the region remains difficult. Troop shortages have made it difficult for NATO to hold areas seized from the Taliban in southern Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Canada's {{military}} involvement in Afghanistan began in 2002 with the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), a coalition of soldiers from 42 countries, which was tasked as a counterinsurgency effort {{in response to the}} September 11 attacks. ISAF had initially been established as a stabilization force by the United Nations Security Council on 20 December 2001, to secure Kabul. The Canadian Liberal government at the time, under Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, chose to have the Canadian Forces (CF) hand over its prisoners to the United States, who led the fight against al-Qaeda and other insurgents. After NATO took command of Afghanistan in 2003, Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse {{at the hands of the}} United States armed forces in Iraq came to the attention of the public, and Canada soon faced pressure to hand their prisoners to someone else. Canada entered into an agreement with the Afghan government and started transferring detainees to Afghan security forces, which comprised the <b>Afghan</b> <b>National</b> <b>Army</b> (ANA) and the Afghan National Directorate of Security (NDS).|$|E
5|$|In November 2001, {{as part of}} Operation Enduring Freedom {{with the}} United States, the United Kingdom invaded Afghanistan to topple the Taliban in Operation Herrick. The 3rd Division were {{deployed}} in Kabul {{to assist in the}} liberation of the capital and defeat Taliban forces in the mountains. In 2006 the British Army began concentrating on fighting Taliban forces and bringing security to Helmand Province, with around 9,500 British troops (including marines, airmen and sailors) deployed at its peak—the second-largest force after that of the US. In December 2012 Prime Minister David Cameron announced that the combat mission would end in 2014, and troop numbers gradually fell as the <b>Afghan</b> <b>National</b> <b>Army</b> took over the brunt of the fighting. Between 2001 and 26 April 2014 a total of 453 British military personnel died in Afghan operations. Operation Herrick ended with the handover of Camp Bastion on 26 October 2014, but the British Army maintains a deployment in Afghanistan as part of Operation Toral.|$|E
50|$|Pul-e-Charkhi (Persian: زندان پل چرخی), {{also known}} as Pul-i-Charkhi or <b>Afghan</b> <b>National</b> Detention Facility, is the largest prison in Afghanistan east of Kabul. Construction of the jail began in the 1970s by order of former {{president}} Mohammed Daoud Khan and was completed during the 1980s. The prison became notorious for torture and executions after the 1978 Saur Revolution as well as during the 10 year Soviet war that followed. Between April 1978 and the Soviet invasion of December 1979, the communist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) under Nur Muhammad Taraki, executed around 27,000 political prisoners at Pul-i-Charkhi. The <b>Afghan</b> <b>National</b> <b>Army's</b> 201st Corps is based nearby Pul-e-Charkhi.|$|R
50|$|The brigade {{partnered with}} the <b>Afghan</b> <b>National</b> <b>Army’s</b> 203rd Corps, sharing their expertise, {{helping them to}} grow their {{capabilities}} as they continued to assume responsibility {{for the security of}} their nation and its people. The Afghans were able to successfully hold a grand council of leaders, also known as a Loya Jirga in Pashto, as well as the Ghazni Islamic festival, which was attended by dignitaries and followers from around the world. The Spartan Brigade also guided the Afghan security forces as they conducted their national presidential election, along with the ensuing run-off election.|$|R
5000|$|Operation Baawar (Pashto for assurance), {{was a major}} Afghan-led {{offensive}} in Afghanistan west of Kandahar City. The operation took place primarily in a sector known as the Horn of Panjwaii. The combat operation started on December 5, 2010. [...] Canadian troops from Task Force Kandahar, including those from the 1st Battalion Royal 22e Régiment Battle Group, worked with the <b>Afghan</b> <b>National</b> <b>Army’s</b> 1st Brigade of the 205th (Hero) Corps {{as part of the}} larger Operation Hamkari. [...] Part of Operation Baawar included Canadian and Afghan engineering units building 17 km of road between Mushan and Sperwan Ghar.|$|R
5|$|In fall of 2003, the 45th Infantry Brigade was {{deployed}} to Afghanistan {{in support of}} Operation Enduring Freedom, assuming command of Task Force Phoenix II from 2nd Brigade, 10th Mountain Division. The purpose of the soldiers' deployment was to assist in training Afghan security forces. Over the next few years, soldiers of the 45th Infantry Brigade, including its Headquarters and Headquarters Company, would deploy {{in support of this}} mission. In April 2004, 350 soldiers from the brigade's 1st Battalion, 279th Infantry Regiment also {{deployed to}} Joint Task Force Phoenix. During this rotation, the brigade grew the size of the <b>Afghan</b> <b>National</b> <b>Army</b> to over 14,000 as well as fielding a corps-sized force ahead of schedule. In August 2004, the brigade was replaced in this mission by the 76th Infantry Brigade, and subsequently returned home to the United States. The brigade spent three years back home, and in that time transformed into an infantry brigade combat team {{as a part of a}} new transformation plan for the Army.|$|E
5|$|The ADF {{currently}} has several forces deployed to the Middle East. The ADF's {{contribution to the}} Military intervention against ISIL makes up the largest overseas commitment with 780 personnel deployed as part of Operation Okra. As of November 2015, six F/A-18A Hornets, one E-7A Wedgetail and one KC-30A tanker were deployed to strike Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria. Approximately 380 personnel were deployed to Iraq {{as part of an}} international effort to provide training and other forms of assistance to the Iraqi military. Deployments in Afghanistan number 250 personnel in Operation Highroad, a non-combat training mission supporting the <b>Afghan</b> <b>National</b> <b>Army.</b> A frigate is also deployed to the Middle East in maritime security operations in and around the Gulf of Aden as part of the Combined Maritime Forces. Australian personnel also form part of peacekeeping missions in Israel, Jordan, Egypt and Sudan. The ADF has a further 400 personnel based in the Middle East to support operations in the region.|$|E
5|$|In September 2011, Simon Bates {{presented}} {{a week of}} programmes from South Australia {{as part of a}} promotion in which the station gave away a holiday to the state. In December 2011, Bates travelled to Afghanistan to present a series of shows with British troops at Camp Bastion, which featured Christmas messages from British soldiers serving there to their friends and relatives. Bates discussed the possible future of Afghanistan as coalition forces prepared to hand over control to the <b>Afghan</b> <b>National</b> <b>Army.</b> On 8 April 2012, Easter Sunday, the forces broadcaster BFBS simulcast a two-hour show presented jointly by Bates and BFBS's Rachel Cochrane, with Smooth, allowing family and friends of serving troops to connect with their loved ones. On 27 May 2012, Bates {{presented a}} special programme ahead of the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant, previewing Elizabeth II's journey along the River Thames on the royal barge, Spirit of Chartwell. He was given special access to the vessel and spoke to the boat's owner, Philip Morrell and to composer Debbie Wiseman who was commissioned to write the music for the event. To commemorate the 30th anniversary {{of the end of the}} 1982 Falklands War, Bates broadcast the breakfast show from the Falkland Islands for a week; he explored the lives and experiences of Islanders and reflected on the conflict.|$|E
50|$|In September 2012, a McClatchy {{journalist}} interviewed nine Afghan {{soldiers from}} the <b>Afghan</b> <b>National</b> <b>Army’s</b> 1st Kandak, 2nd Infantry Brigade, 201st Corps who had been present at the battle. The Afghan soldiers disputed portions of the USMC's account of the battle, stating that the Taliban did not charge Meyer's vehicle and that only two dead Taliban were found after the battle. The Afghan soldiers stated {{that it was the}} belated arrival of attack helicopters which finally chased away the Taliban, not the actions of any of the U.S. Soldiers or Marines on the ground. The Afghans added that the three Marines and naval corpsman, Johnson, Kenefick, Johnson, and Layton, were killed after remaining behind to cover the withdrawal of the Afghan {{soldiers from the}} ambush site.|$|R
5000|$|In January 2017, the Marine Corps Times {{reported}} that in spring 2017, the U.S. Marine Corps will deploy a task force of 300 personnel (known as Task Force Southwest) for nine months to southwestern Afghanistan to advise-and-assist local security forces in countering Taliban gains in the Helmand province. Officials said the Marines will work alongside [...] "key leaders" [...] from the <b>Afghan</b> <b>National</b> <b>Army's</b> 215th Corps and the 505th Zone National Police [...] "to further optimize their capabilities in that region."

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Islamist {{inspired}} {{terrorist attacks in}} New York and Washington on 11 September 2001, Australian forces were committed to the American-led international coalition against terrorism. The ADF's most visible contribution—codenamed Operation Slipper—has been a special forces task group operating in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2002 and again from mid-2005 {{to fight against the}} Taliban. Over time the Australian commitment has grown, with the addition of further ground forces {{in the form of a}} Reconstruction Task Force from 2006 to provide security, reconstruction and to mentor and train the <b>Afghan</b> <b>National</b> <b>Army.</b> Australia has also contributed a frigate and two AP-3C Orion surveillance aircraft and three C-130 Hercules transport aircraft to international operations in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean since 2001, supporting both the operations in Afghanistan and those in Iraq under Operation Catalyst. A detachment of four F/A-18 Hornet fighter-bombers was based at Diego Garcia from late-2001 to mid-2002, while two Boeing 707 air-to-air refuelling aircraft were also based in Manas Air Base in Kyrgyzstan to provide support to coalition aircraft operating in Afghan airspace but were later withdrawn. A Special Operations Task Group was deployed to support the Reconstruction Taskforce in April 2007. In addition to radar crews, logistics and intelligence officers, and security personnel, this brought the number of Australian personnel in Afghanistan to 950 by mid-2007, with further small increases to 1,000 in mid-2008, 1,100 in early 2009 and 1,550 in mid-2009.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a Reconstruction Taskforce (RTF) based {{around the}} 1st Combat Engineer Regiment with {{protective}} elements from the 5/7 RAR, 6 RAR and 2nd Cavalry Regiment began arriving in Uruzgan Province in southern Afghanistan in early September 2006 {{as part of}} Operation Slipper. The RTF formed part of a Dutch-led Provincial Reconstruction Team, operating as part of Task Force Uruzgan and based at Forward Operating Base Ripley, outside of Tarin Kowt. However, as the Australian commitment expanded, by 2010 the task force had evolved into a combined arms battalion-sized battle group consisting of infantry, engineers, cavalry, artillery and logistic elements, usually based on {{a unit of the}} Royal Australian Regiment. Known as the Mentoring Task Force (MTF), it formed part of a multinational brigade known as Combined Team Uruzgan and was tasked with counter-insurgency operations in conjunction with United States and other coalition forces. Partnered with the 4th Brigade, 205th Corps of the <b>Afghan</b> <b>National</b> <b>Army</b> (ANA), it operated throughout Uruzgan Province. While attached to MTF-1, soldiers from Combat Team Delta (based on D Company, 6 RAR) took part in heavy fighting during the Battle of Derapet in Deh Rahwod on 24 August 2010. Corporal Daniel Keighran was later awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia {{for his role in the}} battle, the first member of the Royal Australian Regiment to receive the award. The task force was withdrawn in late 2013 following the handover of the province to Afghan forces, although a small force protection element remains as part of the ongoing but reduced Australian training and advisory mission.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan {{have demonstrated that}} the U. S. military {{must be prepared to}} conduct foreign security force assistance missions as a major element of the U. S. national security strategy. This thesis is a study of the United States' attempt to build strong central armies in Iraq and Afghanistan {{in the midst of a}} larger nation-building effort. Following the collapse of the Taliban and Saddam Hussein regimes, the U. S. military was tasked to rebuild the <b>national</b> <b>armies</b> of Afghanistan and Iraq. Since the departure of U. S. forces from Iraq in 2011 and the withdrawal of combat advisors from Afghanistan in 2014, the Islamic State has gained control of significant territory in Iraq including Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, while the Taliban and the Islamic State of Iraq and the LevantÐKhorasan control 30 percent of Afghan districts. The purpose of this thesis is to explain why, despite $ 60 billion and more than a decade of military advisory efforts, the Iraqi and <b>Afghan</b> <b>national</b> <b>armies</b> are not unified sustainable forces loyal to the central government and capable of defending their territories from internal and external threats. There are four key premises as to why the Iraqi and Afghan armies have not met the expectations of a sustainable and legitimate central army: failure to achieve legitimacy of governance, lack of motivation and will to fight, creation of an army in the Western image rather than an army that meets the needs of Iraq and Afghanistan, and the lack of a long-term U. S. strategy and commitment. Outstanding ThesisMajor, United States Marine Corp...|$|R
