25|$|Species {{that are}} {{recorded}} in unexpected areas (<b>adventive</b> <b>species)</b> {{are not considered}} to be migratory species, because these did not leave their habitat on their own strength. Examples are species that are imported as egg or caterpillar alongside of their host plants or individuals that were reared by a collector but have escaped. An example of an introduced species is Galleria mellonella, which is found all over the world, because it is reared as food for captive birds and reptiles. At times it is difficult to decide if a species is adventive or migratory. Migratory species like Chrysodeixis chalcites and Helicoverpa armigera would be able to reach western Europe on their own, but are also common in greenhouses.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Adventive</b> <b>species</b> {{may or may}} {{not play}} a {{significant}} role in the decomposition of remains. Arthropods in this ecological role are not necessarily attracted to decaying remains, but use it as an extension of their natural habitats. <b>Adventive</b> <b>species</b> originate within the vegetation and soils surrounding decomposing remains. These insects may visit remains from time to time, or use them for concealment, but their presence can only be accounted for by chance. [...] They may also become predators of necrophagous species found at remains. [...] <b>Adventive</b> <b>species</b> include springtails, centipedes and spiders.|$|E

50|$|The {{later and}} more limited concept {{is that of}} a species that has arrived in a {{specific}} geographic area from a different region, but its population is not self-sustaining. Population numbers are only increased through re-introduction. After some time, an <b>adventive</b> <b>species</b> may become naturalized; or, some populations do not sustain themselves reproductively, but exist because of continued influx from elsewhere. Such a non-sustaining population, or the individuals within it, are said to be adventive. Cultivated plants are a major source of adventive populations. It is estimated that 10-20% of <b>adventive</b> <b>species</b> used in biological control programs eventually become naturalized.|$|E

50|$|The term is {{now used}} by some writers in a more {{restricted}} sense than its initial usage. The earliest and most widespread concept among biologists {{is that of a}} species that has arrived in a specific geographic area from a different region (without further caveats). This is the forerunner of the term 'non-indigenous species', although it lacks the frequently invoked basis of the word 'introduced', which means different things to different writers. In this sense, the cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis), which arrived in North America by natural range expansion, the black rat (Rattus rattus), which is believed to have arrived as a hitchhiker aboard ships, and the kudzu vine (Pueraria lobata), which was introduced deliberately by humans, are all <b>adventive</b> <b>species</b> and have established populations.

50|$|Adults of P. aequinoctialis {{sometimes}} feed on plant matter, such as {{the fruit}} of the palm Astrocaryum, but are generally predators, especially of adult mole crickets of the genus Scapteriscus. P. aequinoctialis has therefore been considered as a potential biological control agent to control Scapteriscus species. Three species of Scapteriscus (S. abbreviatus, S. borellii & S. vicinus) are <b>adventive</b> <b>species</b> in Florida, having arrived around 1900 from South America. The mole crickets' burrowing and the feeding by their adults and nymphs larvae cause significant damage to several grass species, including Paspalum notatum, Cynodon dactylon, Eremochloa ophiuroides, Stenotaphrum secundatum, Zoysia spp. and Hemarthria altissima.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} well known as a noxious weed, both in its native range and in areas where it is an {{introduced}} and often invasive species. It is naturalized in some areas, and it is recorded as an <b>adventive</b> <b>species</b> in others. It grows in many types of disturbed habitat, such as roadsides, and in cultivated fields. Widespread seed dispersal occurs when its spiny burs fall off the plant and are carried to new habitat by people, animals, machinery, or flowing water. The plant is destructive to native and crop plants because it easily outcompetes them for light.|$|E

40|$|In {{the modern}} world {{one of the most}} threat for the {{biodiversity}} is <b>adventive</b> –invasive <b>species.</b> In Colkheti seaside natural, secondary changed plants and wetlands are considered as the main place for plant invasion. The study of alien flora in Colkheti plain started {{in the first half of}} the 20 -th century. The appearance of foreign plants is connected with introduction of cultural plants, which began in the distant past and continues today. In this work the current condition, invasive indicators, bio morphological characteristics and growth-development properties of new invasive species, South American origin Verbena Brasiliensis spread in Colkheti flora (Western Georgia's seaside part) is given. In Colkheti it is mainly spread in the seaside, along the roads, along the railroad, on the ruderal places, near channels and rivers, deserted building sites, landfills, non-agricultural lands. Verbena Brasiliensis is a perennial, erect, branched, 50 – 210  cm height. The plant starts flowering in April–May and lasts till November. It is distinguished with high reproductivity. Fully grown plant in the second year develops about 90000 – 100000 seeds. Consequently the area of plant spread is gradually growing...|$|R
50|$|Labia minor is {{widespread}} in temperate zones around the world.

It ranges further north, into British Columbia and Quebec than any other earwig species, and is the only earwig in Quebec. It has also been introduced to Australia, Madeira, the Galápagos Islands and the Philippines. The species is probably often overlooked, however, due to its small size, and may be more widespread than is currently known.|$|E
50|$|Species {{that are}} {{recorded}} in unexpected areas (<b>adventive</b> <b>species)</b> {{are not considered}} to be migratory species, because these did not leave their habitat on their own strength.

5000|$|Bats {{have evolved}} to use {{echolocation}} to detect and catch their prey. Moths have in turn evolved to detect the echolocation calls of hunting bats, and evoke evasive flight maneuvers, or reply with their own ultrasonic clicks to confuse the bat's echolocation. The Arctiidae subfamily of Noctuid moths uniquely respond to bat echolocation in three prevailing hypotheses: startle, sonar jamming, and acoustic aposematic defense. All these differences depend on specific environmental settings {{and the type of}} echolocation call; however, these hypotheses are not mutually exclusive and can be used by the same moth for defense. The different defense mechanisms {{have been shown to be}} directly responsive to bat echolocation through sympatry studies. In places with spatial or temporal isolation between bats and their prey, the moth species hearing mechanism tends to regress. Fullard et al. (2004) compared adventive and endemic Noctiid moth species in a bat-free habitat to ultrasound and found that all of the <b>adventive</b> <b>species</b> reacted to the ultrasound by slowing their flight times, while only one of the endemic species reacted to the ultrasound signal, indicating a loss of hearing over time in the endemic population. However, the degree of loss or regression depends on the amount of evolutionary time and whether or not the moth species has developed secondary uses for hearing. Some bats are known to use clicks at frequencies above or below moths' hearing ranges. This is known as the allotonic frequency hypothesis. It argues that the auditory systems in moths have driven their bat predators to use higher or lower frequency echolocation to circumvent the moth hearing.Barbastelle bats {{have evolved to}} use a quieter mode of echolocation, calling at a reduced volume and further reducing the volume of their clicks as they close in on prey moths. The lower volume of clicks reduces the effective successful hunting range, but results in a significantly higher number of moths caught than other, louder bat species.|$|E
40|$|Allelopathy {{may play}} an {{important}} role in the invasion success of <b>adventive</b> plant <b>species.</b> The aim of this study was to determine the allelopathic potential of invasive woody plant species occurringin Hungary. Juglone index of fourteen invasive woody plant species in Hungary was determined by themethod of Szabó (1997), comparing the effects of juglone and substance extracted of plant species withunknown allelopathic potential on the germination rate, shoot length and rooth length of white mustard(Sinapis alba L.) used as receiver species. Results have proven a more or less expressed allelopathicpotential in case of all species. The juglone index at higher concentration extracts (5 g dry plant materialextracted with 100 ml distilled water) of almost every studied species approaches to 1 or is above 1, thismeans the effect of the extracts is similar to juglone or surpasses it. In terms of juglone index, theallelopathic potential of false indigo (Amorpha fruticosa L.), tree-of-heaven (Ailanthus altissima (Mill.) Swingle) and hackberry (Celtis occidentalis L.) were the highest. Besides these species the treatment withthe extracts of black walnut (Juglans nigra L.), black cherry (Prunus serotina Ehrh.) and green ash(Fraxinus pennsylvanica MARSH. var. subintegerrima (Vahl) Fern.) reduced extremely significantly thegermination rate, shoot and root length, compared to the control...|$|R
40|$|The cave-associated {{invertebrates}} of Nova Scotia {{constitute a}} fauna {{at a very}} early stage of post-glacial recolonization. The Coleoptera are characterized by low species diversity. A staphylinid Quedius spelaeus spelaeus, a predator, is the only regularly encountered beetle. Ten other terrestrial species registered from cave environments in the province are collected infrequently. They include three other rove-beetles: Brathinus nitidus, Gennadota canadensis and Atheta annexa. The latter two together with Catops gratiosus (Leiodidae) constitute a small group of cave-associated beetles found in decompositional situations. Quedius s. spelaeus and a small suite of other guanophiles live in accumulations of porcupine dung: Agolinus leopardus (Scarabaeidae), Corticaria serrata (Latrididae), and Acrotrichis castanea (Ptilidae).
