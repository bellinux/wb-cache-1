5|$|On lap 28, Kimi Räikkönen was {{the first}} of the top runners to pit, coming out in fourth, but spun at the hairpin in a repeat of an {{incident}} from 2014. The incident cost him twelve seconds and allowed Valtteri Bottas to stay ahead of him in third after he made <b>a</b> <b>pit</b> stop on lap 30. Hamilton made <b>a</b> <b>pit</b> stop on the same lap with Rosberg following suit two laps later, both without incident. At this point, Rosberg was about 1.5 seconds behind his teammate. Another four laps later, Sebastian Vettel came in for his second and final stop of the race. Massa came in for his only stop on lap 38, putting on the super-soft tyres, and dropped from sixth to ninth. Räikkönen made <b>a</b> <b>pit</b> stop again on lap 42, staying in fourth position ahead of the Lotus of Romain Grosjean.|$|E
5|$|Alesi, {{the first}} front-runner {{to make a}} {{scheduled}} pit stop on lap 18, rejoined in tenth. During the next two laps Salo passed Irvine for twelfth, whilst Barrichello made <b>a</b> <b>pit</b> stop from sixth position and came out in eleventh. By lap 22, Michael Schumacher had increased his lead over Häkkinen to eleven seconds. Ralf Schumacher, ten seconds behind Häkkinen, maintained a six-second gap over teammate Button. Michael Schumacher made <b>a</b> <b>pit</b> stop on that lap, emerging in third position. On lap 23 Barrichello passed Herbert for ninth position, and {{during the next two}} laps Villeneuve and Ralf Schumacher made pit stops. Button made <b>a</b> <b>pit</b> stop from fourth position on lap 26, and Häkkinen one lap later; Häkkinen was told by his team (on pit boards) to speed up to reduce the gap to Michael Schumacher, who had a heavier fuel load. Button dropped to eighth position, and Häkkinen came out behind Michael Schumacher. Frentzen and Coulthard made their pit stops together on lap 28, with Coulthard emerging ahead of Frentzen. On that lap, Barrichello passed Alesi for sixth position. Barrichello, setting the fastest lap of the race (1:53.803 on lap 30), had consecutive fastest laps before making his second pit stop on lap 31. However, his car's fuel pressure dropped and he was pushed by marshals into the pit lane. Barrichello and Alesi (who had a similar problem) retired, and Button inherited fourth place. Salo was the final scheduled driver to make <b>a</b> <b>pit</b> stop, on lap 33.|$|E
5|$|By lap 30, Earnhardt {{had moved}} up eight {{positions}} to twelfth. Ten laps later, Reutimann had maintained a lead of 1.7 seconds over Kenseth. On lap 42, Marcos Ambrose moved into seventh. Five laps later, Kenseth claimed the lead off Reutimann who {{was blocked by}} Casey Mears. On lap 51, green flag pit stops began, as Kenseth made <b>a</b> <b>pit</b> stop handling the lead to Stewart. On lap 54, Kyle Busch became the new race leader after Stewart came into pit road. Kyle Busch made <b>a</b> <b>pit</b> stop one lap later, handing the lead back to Kenseth. By lap 60, Kenseth had built up his lead over Reutimann by over two seconds. Eight laps later, Stewart passed Reutimann for second.|$|E

5|$|Gil de Ferran won {{the pole}} {{position}} and maintained his lead throughout the race's first half. Andretti {{made contact with}} Scott Dixon on the first lap and made <b>a</b> <b>pit</b> stop along with a change of strategy {{to move up the}} field. Hélio Castroneves took over the lead after de Ferran made <b>a</b> <b>pit</b> stop for fuel and held it for 15 laps before he retired with a mechanical issue. Fernández and Tony Kanaan held the first position over the next seven laps. Andretti moved into first place on the 71st lap and maintained the position to win the race.|$|E
5|$|Matt Kenseth {{took over}} the tenth {{position}} on lap 58. On lap 66, Hamlin made <b>a</b> <b>pit</b> stop, and Allmendinger did likewise two laps later. Juan Pablo Montoya and Kahne made their pit stops during the 69th lap. Edwards made <b>a</b> <b>pit</b> stop the following lap, giving the first position to Johnson. In turn, he made <b>a</b> <b>pit</b> stop on lap 71, handing the lead to Truex, Jr. On the following lap, Harvick moved to ninth, as Hamlin took over 16th. By lap 77, Truex, Jr. had a 1.2 second lead over Kahne. Seven laps later, Aric Almirola moved into the fifth position, Harvick was moving toward Johnson in seventh. By the 93rd lap, Truex, Jr. increased his lead to 1.5 seconds. Five laps later, the third caution was given because of debris. Most of the front runners made pit stops during the caution, as Hamlin's team worked to repair his splitter. At the lap 102 restart, Truex, Jr. was first, ahead of Edwards and Kahne in second and third. During the pit stops Johnson fell to 10th.|$|E
5|$|Montoya {{maintained}} his start-line advantage and led {{until he was}} passed by Barrichello on the ninth lap. Barrichello pulled away from Montoya and held the lead until his one and only pit stop on lap 19 which proved problematic because of a faulty refuelling rig. Montoya was utilising a one-stop strategy and made <b>a</b> <b>pit</b> stop on lap 29, which allowed his teammate Ralf Schumacher to lead for six laps. Barrichello regained the lead on lap 36, until Montoya took over the position on lap 42 when Barrichello made <b>a</b> <b>pit</b> stop for the second time. Barrichello started to reduce the gap between himself and Montoya {{but was unable to}} challenge the Williams driver who won his first Formula One victory.|$|E

5|$|Another {{round of}} green flag pit stops began on lap 203 when Truex made <b>a</b> <b>pit</b> stop; Kenseth {{was the first}} of the leaders to pit the {{following}} lap. On lap 208, Jeff Gordon became the new race leader after Biffle came into pit road. After pit stops, Biffle reclaimed the top position. On lap 220, the third caution was given as Ambrose's car suffered an engine failure. Jeff Gordon and Martin stayed out, while some of the leaders came to pit road.|$|E
5|$|As the pit stops {{started on}} lap eleven, Massa, Nico Hülkenberg and Felipe Nasr {{were the first}} to come in for new tyres. Hamilton had managed to extend his {{advantage}} over Vettel to almost 8 seconds when Vettel made <b>a</b> <b>pit</b> stop– the first of the front runners to do so– on lap 14. The undercut-strategy worked, as Rosberg emerged from the pit lane behind the Ferrari when he made <b>a</b> <b>pit</b> stop one lap later. Hamilton changed tyres on the following lap, emerging close in front of the battling Rosberg and Vettel, with the Mercedes driver taking second position in a DRS-aided move on the inside of turn one. He was now close behind teammate Hamilton, but ultimately unable to attack him for the lead. Räikkönen was the last of the top four to pit, on lap 18 and applied a different strategy, as he used the harder medium tyres, while the Mercedes and Vettel were running their middle stint on the softer tyre compound. Even with the harder tyres, he was able to close to the top three.|$|E

5|$|At {{the second}} round of pit stops, Räikkönen managed to get ahead of Bottas, who made pit stops {{simultaneously}} with Nico Rosberg on lap 29. Another two laps later, Vettel made <b>a</b> <b>pit</b> stop and emerged behind Rosberg, who claimed second, about ten seconds down on Hamilton, who made <b>a</b> <b>pit</b> stop on lap 32. Bottas was briefly challenged by the Lotus of Romain Grosjean, but Grosjean went off track on lap 33, while Will Stevens received a five-second penalty for speeding in the pit lane. On lap 43, Marcus Ericsson overtook Pérez for 12th and two laps later, Verstappen moved ahead of teammate Sainz for ninth. Pérez lost another position to Kvyat on lap 45. Another lap later, Stevens went into a spin while fighting for position with Alexander Rossi, who finished ahead of his more experienced teammate for the second race in a row. By lap 49, Kvyat moved ahead of Ericsson as well to claim 13th position. Two laps from the end, Felipe Nasr became the first retirement of the race, albeit he would be classified in last, four laps behind the winner. Lewis Hamilton took victory comfortably, finishing 18.9 seconds ahead of Rosberg.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Ricciardo was {{the first}} driver to pit {{for a second time}} on lap 30. At the same time, a {{three-way}} fight had emerged for ninth place, with Pérez in front of Grosjean and Verstappen. On lap 32, Verstappen moved ahead of Grosjean and took another position from Pérez, who in turn lost another place to Grosjean in the same manoeuvre. Vettel made <b>a</b> <b>pit</b> stop for a second time on lap 33, prompting Rosberg to follow suit one lap later. Hamilton briefly held the lead, but made <b>a</b> <b>pit</b> stop as well soon after, emerging to set a new fastest lap of the race albeit emerging behind both Ferrari cars. Lap 36 saw a collision between Pastor Maldonado and Marcus Ericsson, but both drivers were able to continue the race. Two laps later, Maldonado was in another fight for position with the other Sauber of Felipe Nasr, moving ahead. He ultimately received a five-second penalty for his part in the incident with Ericsson.|$|E

5|$|Four laps later, Gordon passed Johnson {{to become}} the leader. On lap 218, the seventh caution was given after Logano's engine failed. Most of the front-runners made pit stops during the caution. At the lap 225 restart, Gordon was the leader, ahead of Kyle Busch, Harvick, and Stewart, while Johnson {{restarted}} in ninth, after having an 18-second pit stop. By lap 236, Johnson had moved up to the fifth position. Four laps later, Dale Earnhardt, Jr. made pit stops because of a loose wheel. By lap 244, Gordon had a 1.1 second lead over Kyle Busch. Gordon continued to increase his lead over the second position, while Martin passed Menard for the 11th position. On the following lap, Stewart moved into the third position. By the 277th lap, Gordon had a 1.8 second lead over Kyle Busch in second. On lap 282, Kyle Busch made <b>a</b> <b>pit</b> stops, one lap before Gordon, Stewart, and Harvick made pit stops. On lap 284, Johnson made <b>a</b> <b>pit</b> stop, as the eighth caution was given after Andy Lally collided with the wall.

Johnson clinched the fifth position, after starting twenty-first.|$|E
5|$|Häkkinen passed Villeneuve on lap 28 {{although}} {{he went off}} the track in the process. Herbert made his only pit stop on the same lap {{although he}} stalled and rejoined in twelfth place. Gené, Mazzacane, Ralf Schumacher and Verstappen made pit stops between laps 28 and 29. Villeneuve tried to retake fourth position from Häkkinen on the 30th lap but overshot the manoeuvre. Häkkinen made <b>a</b> <b>pit</b> stop on lap 35, emerging behind Villeneuve and Irvine. Coulthard managed to close to within 2 seconds of Michael Schumacher {{when he made his}} second pit stop on lap 38. Michael Schumacher made <b>a</b> <b>pit</b> stop on the following lap and remained in the lead. Barrichello became the leader for one lap and made his pit stop on lap 41. This allowed Michael Schumacher to reclaim the first position. By the start of lap 45, Coulthard had closed to within two seconds of Michael Schumacher. Ralf Schumacher was called into his garage by his team to retire on the 45th lap. Zonta pulled off the race track with an blown engine two laps later.|$|E
