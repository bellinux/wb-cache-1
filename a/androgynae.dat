40|$|For centuries it {{has been}} a common belief that any {{abnormality}} of physique is an accompaniment of mental illness. Recently interest has been focussed on the degree of masculinity or conversely feminity in the constitution. An index of this parameter called 'androgynae ' can be derived from Taner's formula. Physique acts as a manifestation of the gene complex mediated possibly through endocrines and hence should reflect on the excretion pattern of 17 ketosteroids. Personality being a constitutional variation, it ought to be related to physique and in turn to the androgenic activities. M—f profile of the MMPI should locate such variation in that case. Present work was planned to find out implication of each of these parameters and {{to see if there is}} any correlation between them. It was seen that the psychiatric patients had low <b>androgynae</b> scores than the normals but the 17 ketosteroid excretion was higher. This was unexpected. M-f profile of the patients did not show any significant difference from the control. Results are discussed in the light of available literature. For centuries {{it has been}} thought that any abnormality of physique is a common accompaniment of mental illness. This belief can be traced to phythagoreans and beyond and its first codex was received in the hands of great Galen. Since then many workers have tried to boost this knowledg...|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} of Mannia <b>androgyna</b> (L.) A. Evans in Russian Asian and Japanese localities changes {{the conception of}} the distribution patterns of the taxon, previously regarded as principally a Mediterranean species. A description and illustrations based on specimens collected in Russian Asia and Japan are provided. The history of the taxonomic understanding of Mannia <b>androgyna</b> is briefly reviewed, and features differentiating closely related species are discussed...|$|R

50|$|The species Oxymitra paleacea Bisch. {{occurs in}} Europe, South America and North America (Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri, on {{sandstone}} or igneous substrates). North American plants have sometimes {{been considered a}} separate species O. <b>androgyna,</b> but they have more often been included in a wider definition of O. paleacea. The species Oxymitra cristata is found in South Africa.|$|R
40|$|Thirty-five randomly-collected Semele <b>androgyna</b> Kunth {{samples were}} {{screened}} by RP-HPLC for their phenolic composition. Fraction analysis allowed {{the detection of}} 17 different compounds. According to their retention times and UV spectra obtained by diode array analysis, these phenolics represent three classes: phenolic acids, flavones and flavonols. Co-chromatography with specific standards enabled identification of quercetin, rutin and quercitrin in Semele tissues for the first time. Polymorphism based on phenolic composition was evaluated using multivariate analysis and showed four distinct S. <b>androgyna</b> clusters. This polymorphism {{was not associated with}} morphological diversity or different in ambient light intensities. Biochemical differentiation is thus present in this species. The application of multivariate analysis techniques to RP-HPLC data has allowed the classification of samples into two groups, previously proposed on the basis of morphological and cytotaxonomical information. Therefore, the use of phenolics as chemotaxonomic markers in Semele is highly recommended because of its diagnostic value, even at a subspecies level. Discriminant canonical analysis and Mahalanobis distances confirmed these clusters as recognisable chemosystematic units. However, these units do not support the separation of S. pterygophora...|$|R
40|$|Nine Ochrolechia {{species have}} been {{identified}} in a revision of the genus in the Baltic countries: O. alboflavescens, O. <b>androgyna,</b> O. arborea, O. bahusiensis, O. frigida, O. microstictoides, O. pallescens, O. szatalaensis and O. turneri. O. bahusiensis is reported for the first time for Estonia and Lithuania, the occurrence of O. tartarea in the Baltic countries is doubtful and O. subviridis should be excluded from the Estonian checklist. An identification key for all listed taxa is provided. ...|$|R
40|$|This study covers {{investigations}} on the hornworts and liverworts of Bafa Lake Natural Park, {{included in}} the C 11 th grid square. A total of 1 species belonging to a family of the class Anthocerotopsida and 26 species belonging to 15 families of the class Marchantiopsida of the division Bryophyta were collected and their habitat characteristics and taxonomical features were recorded. In addition, very rare collected species, as Targionia lorbeeriana, Mannia <b>androgyna,</b> Oxymitra incrassata, Riccia gougetiana, Petalophyllum ralfsii and Gonylanthus ericetarum, exist in this study...|$|R
40|$|Over 280 lichens and bryophytes were {{recorded}} during a botanical survey of Mount Sprent. The {{number of species}} is approximately twice that of the vascular species (136 species) and demonstrates the importance of lichens and bryophyles in assessing the botmical significance of the area. Six species, Calil/aria contristans, Ochrolechia <b>androgyna,</b> Polychidiurn contorturn, Thelotrerna suecicum, Acromastigum verticale and Tylimanthus diversifolius are reported from Tasmania for the first time. Many of the species recorded are widespread in the high rainfall parts of Tasmania, but a significant number are confined mainly to the west. Lichen diversity is richest in subalpine and alpine heathland and on alpine rock outcrops, whilst bryophytes are most diverse in sheltered habitats such as young forest, scrub and amongst alpine rocks...|$|R
