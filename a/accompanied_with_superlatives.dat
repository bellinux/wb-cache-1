40|$|Abstract. We discuss {{semantics}} of superlative quantifiers at most n and {{at least}} n. We argue that {{the meaning of a}} quantifier is a pair specifying a verification and a falsification condition for sentences with this quantifier. We further propose that the verification condition of superlative quantifiers should be interpreted in an epistemic way, that is as a conjunctive list of possibilities. We also present results of a reasoning experiment in which we analyze the acceptance rate of inferences <b>with</b> <b>superlative</b> and comparative quantifiers in German. We discuss the results in the light of our proposal...|$|R

Diamond is renowned as a material <b>with</b> <b>superlative</b> physical qualities, most of which originate from the strong covalent bonding between its atoms.
