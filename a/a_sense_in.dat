5|$|The photographers in 1999, 2001, 2003 and 2004 were {{respectively}} Antoine Verglas, James Porto, Michael Zeppetello and Steven White for the Swimsuit Issue works. From 2005–2007 Gair {{took the}} photographs of her body paintings herself. Verglas again photographed the bodypainting for the 2008 Swimsuit Issue. No body painting pictures have been chosen as the main image {{on the cover of}} the Swimsuit Issue. However, in the 2005 Swimsuit Issue (pictured left) in which Carolyn Murphy is the cover model, Jessica White was shown as an inset on the cover in a Miami Dolphins jersey body painting by Gair. Thus, as a Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue photographer Gair debuted on the cover in <b>a</b> <b>sense.</b> <b>In</b> 2006 a small cropped portion of her photograph of a bodypainting of Klum appeared in an inset on the cover, but no bodypainting was apparent.|$|E

500|$|The {{texts and}} images of the Book of the Dead were magical as well as religious. Magic was as {{legitimate}} an activity as praying to the gods, even when the magic was aimed at controlling the gods themselves. Indeed, there was little distinction for the Ancient Egyptians between magical and religious practice. The concept of magic (heka) was also intimately linked with the spoken and written word. [...] The act of speaking a ritual formula {{was an act of}} creation; there is <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>in</b> which action and speech were one and the same thing. The magical power of words extended to the written word. Hieroglyphic script was held to have been invented by the god Thoth, and the hieroglyphs themselves were powerful. Written words conveyed the full force of a spell. This was even true when the text was abbreviated or omitted, as often occurred in later Book of the Dead scrolls, particularly if the accompanying images were present. The Egyptians also believed that knowing the name of something gave power over it; thus, the Book of the Dead equips its owner with the mystical names of many of the entities he would encounter in the afterlife, giving him power over them.|$|E
500|$|To {{effect this}} doctrine, the United States Army Air Corps would be {{required}} to expend the majority of its resources in amassing a fleet of self-defending heavy bombers, and in the training and maintenance of a great number of airmen to fill aircrew and ground crew positions. The ACTS officers who believed in the heavy bomber doctrine realized that any other Air Corps expenditures such as for tactical bombers and fighter aircraft would take away from the proposed large fleet of heavy bombers. Moreover, the men realized that the United States government would have to reduce funding to naval and ground forces in order to establish a great air fleet. To implement these changes, the ACTS instructors began to instill <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>in</b> their students that a separate and independent air arm of the type described earlier by Brigadier General William [...] "Billy" [...] Mitchell, to be called the United States Air Force, was the way forward. As a compromise first step, the General Headquarters (GHQ) Air Force was established within the Army Air Corps in 1935, commanded by General Frank M. Andrews, a strategic bombing advocate. Andrews staffed the command with like-minded officers such as Henry H. [...] "Hap" [...] Arnold.|$|E
500|$|Wall Street enjoyed renewed {{interest}} in the film in 1990 when the cover of Newsweek magazine asked, [...] "Is Greed Dead?" [...] after 1980s icons like Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky ran afoul of insider trading laws. Over the years, the film's screenwriter Stanley Weiser has been approached by numerous people who told him, [...] "The movie changed my life. Once I saw it I knew that I {{wanted to get into}} such and such business. I wanted to be like Gordon Gekko". In addition, both Charlie Sheen and Michael Douglas still have people come up to them and say that they became stockbrokers because of their respective characters in the film. In recent years, Stone was asked how the financial market depicted in Wall Street has changed and he replied, [...] "The problems that existed in the 1980s market grew and grew into a much larger phenomenon. Enron is a fiction, in <b>a</b> <b>sense,</b> <b>in</b> the same way that Gordon Gekko's buying and selling was a fiction ... Kenny Lay—he's the new Gordon Gekko". Entertainment Weekly magazine's Owen Gleiberman recently commented that the film, [...] "reveals something now which it couldn't back then: that the Gordon Gekkos of the world weren't just getting rich—they were creating an alternate reality that was going to crash down on all of us".|$|E

500|$|Mandela {{generated}} controversy {{throughout his}} career as an activist and politician, having detractors on both {{the right and the}} radical left. During the 1980s, Mandela was widely labelled a terrorist by prominent political figures in the Western world for his embrace of political violence. According to Thatcher, for instance, the ANC was [...] "a typical terrorist organisation". The US government's State and Defense departments officially designated the ANC as a terrorist organisation, resulting in Mandela remaining on their terrorism watch-list until 2008. On the left, some voices in the ANC—among them Frank B. Wilderson III—accused him of selling out for agreeing to enter negotiations with the apartheid government and for not implementing the reforms of the Freedom Charter during his Presidency. According to Barnard, [...] "there is also <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>in</b> which his chiefly bearing and mode of conduct, the very respect and authority he accrued in representing his nation in his own person, went against the spirit of democracy", and concerns were similarly expressed that he placed his own status and celebrity above the transformation of his country. His government would be criticised for its failure to deal with both the HIV/AIDS pandemic and the high levels of poverty in South Africa. Mandela was also criticised for his friendship with political leaders such as Castro, Gaddafi, and Suharto—deemed dictators by critics—as well as his refusal to condemn their governments' human rights violations.|$|E

[...] The result was [...] purchased from John E. Wilson on July 10, 1883, by the federal government. The sustained effort for a national monument on Popes Creek had begun to take shape.|$|E

2500|$|Though A Feast for [...] Crows was {{the first}} novel in the {{sequence}} to debut at number one on The New York Times Best Seller list, it received more negative reviews {{in comparison with the}} previous novels in the series. [...] Martin's decision to halve the plot in terms of character and location was highly controversial; many critics felt that this novel consisted of characters that people were less interested in. [...] Publishers Weekly said, [...] "Long-awaited doesn't begin to describe this fourth installment in bestseller Martin's staggeringly epic Song of Ice and Fire[...] This is not Act I Scene 4 but Act II Scene 1, laying groundwork more than advancing the plot, and it sorely misses its other half. The slim pickings here are tasty, but in no way satisfying." [...] Salon.com's Andrew Leonard said in 2011, [...] "I don't care how good a writer you are: If you subtract your three strongest characters from your tale, you severely undermine the basis for why readers fell under your spell in the first place. It didn't work. But there was also <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>in</b> A Feast of Crows that Martin had lost his way. The characters whose stories he did tell wandered back and forth across a landscape devastated by war and oncoming winter, but didn't seem to be headed anywhere in particular." [...] Remy Verhoeve of The Huffington Post noted in their 2011 A Dance with Dragons review that the fifth volume had to [...] "repair some of the damage done by A Feast for Crows, which frankly felt as if it was written by a ghost writer at times." [...] Both books had [...] "the same structural problems", being [...] "sprawling and incoherent", and in her opinion Feast has the less interesting characters. The Atlantic Rachael Brown said in their A Dance With Dragons review that Feast was [...] "bleak and plodding" [...] and [...] "sorely missed" [...] Daenerys Targaryen, Tyrion Lannister, and Jon Snow.|$|E

60|$|When, given A, it is {{possible}} to infer B, but given B, {{it is not possible to}} infer A, we say that B is dependent upon A in <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>in</b> which A is not dependent upon B. Stated in logical terms, this amounts to saying that, when we know a many-one relation of A to B, B is dependent upon A in respect of this relation. If the relation is a causal law, we say that B is causally dependent upon A. The illustration that chiefly concerns us is the system of appearances of a physical object. We can, broadly speaking, infer distant appearances from near ones, but not vice versa. All men look alike when they are a mile away, hence when we see a man a mile off we cannot tell what he will look like when he is only a yard away. But when we see him a yard away, we can tell what he will look like a mile away. Thus the nearer view gives us more valuable information, and the distant view is causally dependent upon it in <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>in</b> which it is not causally dependent upon the distant view.|$|E
