500|$|The {{first of}} twenty-eight books in Blyton's Old Thatch series, The Talking Teapot and Other Tales, was {{published}} in 1934, {{the same year as}} the first book in her Brer Rabbit series, Brer Rabbit Retold; (note that Brer Rabbit originally featured in Uncle Remus stories by Joel Chandler Harris), her first serial story and first full-length book, Adventures of the Wishing-Chair, followed in 1937. The Enchanted Wood, the first book in the Faraway Tree series, published in 1939, is about a magic tree inspired by the Norse mythology that had fascinated Blyton as a child. According to Blyton's daughter Gillian the inspiration for the magic tree came from [...] "thinking up a story one day <b>and</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>she</b> was walking in the enchanted wood and found the tree. In her imagination she climbed up through the branches and met Moon-Face, Silky, the Saucepan Man {{and the rest of the}} characters. She had all she needed." [...] As in the Wishing-Chair series, these fantasy books typically involve children being transported into a magical world in which they meet fairies, goblins, elves, pixies and other mythological creatures.|$|E
2500|$|In the September 1, 1995, {{article for}} the Shambhala Sun, [...] "bell hooks talks to John Perry Barlow", Barlow {{reflects}} upon Cynthia Horner passing away: [...] "It {{seems to me that}} what we’re here to do is to learn about love in the presence of fear... You pass away from the moment into the infinite, where there are no moments and where there’s no time. Here in an embodied state, the body, like all physical things, participates in entropy and all the other artifacts of time. There’s a thin but nevertheless impermeable membrane between the chronological and the timeless that has become much more real to me since my lover died a year ago. Even though I feel her soul, the absence of her body feels like an enormous barrier. The absence of the spoken word, the absence of the sound of her voice, or the touch of her skin. All the things that only can be done by souls with bodies on them... But you know the only time that I feel in contact with her, really, is when her spirit temporarily borrows someone else’s body to dance. Like the moment that you and I were dancing up in your apartment a few months ago. <b>And</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>she</b> was in you and I could feel her there. You quit dancing the way you danced and started dancing the way she danced. And it was almost like a practical joke that she was playing in a way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{production}} overhaul and the studio's attempts for more cost-efficient animated features, Mark Dindal urged for [...] "a simpler approach that emphasized the characters rather than overwhelming special effects or cinematic techniques". Because {{of the subsequent}} departure of Deja, animator Dale Baer inherited the character of Yzma. Using Eartha Kitt's gestures during recording sessions, Baer commented that [...] "She has a natural voice for animation and really got into the role. She would gesture wildly and it was fun just to watch her. She would come into each session almost serious and very professional <b>and</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>she</b> would go wild and break up laughing." [...] Ranieri was later asked {{to serve as the}} supervising animator of Kuzco (as a human and a llama), though he would admit being reluctant at first until he discovered that Kuzco [...] "had a side to him, {{there was a lot of}} comedy potential and as a character he went through an arc". Pudleiner was also reassigned to work as an animator of the human version of Kuzco. In addition to drawing inspiration from David Spade during recording sessions, the Kuzco animation team studied llamas at the zoo, visited a llama farm, watched nature documentaries, and even observed the animals up close when they came for a visit to the studio. For the rewritten version of Pacha, animator Bruce W. Smith observed that [...] "Pacha is probably the most human of all the characters," [...] and further added that he [...] "has more human mannerisms and realistic traits, which serve as a contrast to the cartoony llama he hangs out with. He is the earthy guy who brings everything back into focus. Being a big fellow about six-foot-five and weighing about 250 pounds we had to work hard to give him a sense of weight and believability in his movement." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Yes, I did,' <b>and</b> then <b>suddenly</b> <b>she</b> gave {{another little}} scream, which {{had quite a}} {{different}} sound from the first. 'Look! Look!' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> {{sat down}} <b>suddenly</b> upon the divan; {{it was almost}} as if she {{collapsed}} bereft of strength; <b>and</b> as <b>suddenly</b> <b>she</b> fell to weeping softly.|$|R
60|$|The {{question}} {{seemed to}} Gyp idiotic; <b>and</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>she</b> felt quite cool.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>she</b> {{felt herself}} being {{propelled}} by that softness forward towards the stile.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Belding's {{strained}} face {{underwent a}} swift and mobile relaxation, <b>and</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>she</b> was weeping in strangely mingled happiness and bitterness.|$|E
60|$|There {{was silence}} for a moment, during which Mrs. Goyte {{remained}} with her head dropped, sinister <b>and</b> abstracted. <b>Suddenly</b> <b>she</b> lifted her face, and her eyes flashed.|$|R
60|$|Her {{father came}} to the station {{with her in the}} morning. The train was not in: and they walked up and down <b>and</b> talked. <b>Suddenly</b> <b>she</b> remembered: it had slipped her mind.|$|R
6000|$|Torn with pity, I thought again, but I {{could see}} no alternative. <b>And</b> then, <b>suddenly,</b> <b>she</b> was {{clinging}} to me, her courage gone, her breast shaken with sobs. [...] "Where shall I go?" [...] she cried. [...] "God help me! Are there no remote places where He will not seek me out? I have tried them all, David." [...] <b>And</b> quite as <b>suddenly</b> <b>she</b> disengaged herself, <b>and</b> looked at me strangely. [...] "You are well revenged for Temple Bow," [...] she said.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>she</b> sank to {{the ground}} and, shaking her long hair about her face and arms, she burst into bitter weeping.|$|E
6000|$|Descending {{the stone}} stairs, she thought: [...] "'Anonyma'--'Anonyma'--yes, {{it was quite}} the name." [...] <b>And</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>she</b> saw Barbara come running up again.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>she</b> laughed, {{and a quick}} {{light came}} on all their faces, there was a blithe trip in the small boy's walk.|$|E
6000|$|... "What NONSENSE!" [...] said Mr. Bensington's cousin Jane, and [...] "Oh!" [...] {{directed}} at Redwood's head, [...] "I haven't patience with you," [...] <b>and</b> then <b>suddenly</b> <b>she</b> turned about <b>and</b> {{went out of}} the room with a slam.|$|R
60|$|He {{talked to}} her reassuringly, holding her hands--most of the time, in fact, for the country was a sparsely {{populated}} one, with {{his arm around her}} waist. <b>And</b> then <b>suddenly</b> <b>she</b> seemed to lose her new-found content.

60|$|She {{turned away}} reluctantly, <b>and</b> paused <b>suddenly</b> when <b>she</b> had made {{half a dozen}} steps.|$|R
60|$|Austen started. Euphrasia was {{not looking}} at him now, <b>and</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>she</b> dropped his arms {{and went to the}} window {{overlooking}} the garden.|$|E
6000|$|Her {{eyes flashed}} at me {{a sort of}} frightened merriment, <b>and</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>she</b> {{exploded}} into a clear burst of laughter. [...] "Ha, ha, ha!" ...|$|E
60|$|At {{these words}} Laura grew more {{thoughtful}} than ever, <b>and</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>she</b> caught her western chum {{by the arm}} and pulled Belle into a path leading to the dock.|$|E
6000|$|... "Won't you sit down," [...] she said, [...] "and tell me {{what you}} want to say?" [...] Her voice was flat <b>and</b> faint. <b>Suddenly</b> <b>she</b> had become afraid. She {{struggled}} not to be afraid. After all, what could happen? ...|$|R
60|$|He {{waited a}} long time, but Maggie did not reply. <b>And</b> then, <b>suddenly</b> <b>she</b> leaned against his {{shoulder}} and began to cry--to cry and shake with sobs, holding his arm tightly, and wetting the crêpe de Chine with tears.|$|R
60|$|She seemed dazed, and her form swayed strangely to <b>and</b> fro; <b>suddenly</b> <b>she</b> {{appeared}} to be conscious of her garments, for with a certain shamed movement of tardy modesty she pulled {{a part of her}} draperies over her breast.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Where shall I {{spend the}} night?' thought she. <b>And</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>she</b> saw before her a gate {{which she had}} not noticed before, and a very old woman leaning against it.|$|E
6000|$|<b>And</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>she</b> {{felt his}} arms knotted behind her back, {{crushing}} her to him. She stilled a scream; then, very swiftly, took a resolve, and, rigid in his arms, said: ...|$|E

6000|$|His mother gazed {{upon him}} in grieved suspense, and Sally went and leant upon the bureau, {{listening}} for every sound, <b>and</b> sighing. <b>Suddenly</b> <b>she</b> turned round, saying, 'Let them come, I don't care! Philip, tell the worst, {{and take your}} time.' ...|$|R
60|$|The girl's {{face flushed}} <b>suddenly,</b> <b>and</b> <b>she</b> glanced at Ingleby, who {{appeared}} embarrassed.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think so," [...] gasped Lady Casterley; <b>and</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>she</b> {{found herself}} half-lifted from the ground, and, as it were, flying towards the stile. She {{heard a noise}} behind; then Barbara's voice: ...|$|E
60|$|Through {{his head}} went {{a medley of}} sayings to soothe {{children}} that are hurt; but he felt unsteady, unlike himself. <b>And</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>she</b> knelt, and put her hot forehead against his lips.|$|E
6000|$|There came a lull. I {{forgot the}} weapon in my pocket. I said nothing, <b>and</b> <b>suddenly</b> <b>she</b> stood erect before me, wiping her swollen eyes. [...] "Willie," [...] she gulped, [...] "she's gone!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{she said}} slowly, musingly, and again, [...] "yes. That were a way. That is the way." [...] <b>And</b> then <b>suddenly</b> <b>she</b> looked up, <b>and</b> they saw doubt and dread in her eyes. [...] "But in that case--what of my son?" ...|$|R
60|$|Betty's {{face had}} colored warmly at her brother's first question; it toned down {{slightly}} when {{she understood that}} he was not going to tease her as usual, <b>and</b> <b>suddenly,</b> as <b>she</b> looked over his head, it paled white as snow.|$|R
