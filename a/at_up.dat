40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the relation of}} cardiac autoantibody and disease status in a consecutive series of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy by prospective antibody testing at diagnosis and <b>at</b> follow <b>up.</b> METHODS: Antibody status was assessed by indirect immunofluorescence in 110 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (85 male, mean (SD) age 44 (13) years) at diagnosis and <b>at</b> follow <b>up</b> (mean (SD) 14 (12) months); in 57 of them cardiac specific anti-alpha myosin antibody titres were also measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Patients underwent complete evaluation at diagnosis and clinical and non-invasive assessment <b>at</b> follow <b>up,</b> including exercise testing with maximal oxygen consumption measurements. RESULTS: The frequency of cardiac specific antibodies by immunofluorescence was lower <b>at</b> follow <b>up</b> than <b>at</b> diagnosis (28 (25 %) v 11 (10 %), P = 0. 002). Mean (SEM) anti-alpha myosin antibody titres <b>at</b> follow <b>up</b> were also lower than at diagnosis (0. 24 (0. 02) v 0. 30 (0. 02), P = 0. 038); 24 % of patients at diagnosis and 14 % <b>at</b> follow <b>up</b> had an abnormal ELISA result. None of the patients who were negative by immunofluorescence or ELISA at diagnosis became positive <b>at</b> follow <b>up.</b> Presence of antibody at diagnosis was associated with milder symptoms and greater exercise capacity <b>at</b> follow <b>up</b> and persistence of antibody <b>at</b> follow <b>up</b> was associated with stable disease and milder symptoms at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac specific autoantibodies in dilated cardiomyopathy become undetectable with disease progression; this is a recognised feature of other autoimmune conditions, such as type 1 diabetes. Detection of these antibodies at diagnosis and <b>at</b> follow <b>up</b> may provide a non-invasive marker of early dilated cardiomyopathy...|$|R

40|$|A {{randomized}} controlled experiment {{was conducted to}} investigate the effects of expressive writing and fact-control writing about experiences with ovarian cancer on emotional well-being {{and quality of life}} one month after writing in women diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Moderation effects of emotional approach coping and social constraints were predicted based on a matching hypothesis for the fit between the demands of writing and individual differences (Niles et al, 2014) and the role of social constraints on disclosure (Lepore & Revenson, 2007). Cancer-related avoidance and cancer-related intrusive thoughts were examined as mediators on the relationships between social constraints and emotional well-being <b>at</b> follow <b>up</b> and social constraints and quality of life <b>at</b> follow <b>up.</b> Results showed that participants in the expressive writing condition reported increased emotional well-being <b>at</b> follow <b>up,</b> controlling for baseline levels of emotional well-being, but there were no differences in quality of life <b>at</b> follow <b>up</b> between the two writing conditions, controlling for baseline quality of life. There were no differences in reported average negative affect post writing sessions between the two writing conditions. In a model predicting emotional well-being <b>at</b> follow <b>up,</b> expressive writing had a positive effect, social constraints had a negative effect, and emotional approach coping had no effect. The hypothesized moderation effects between emotional approach coping, social constraints and writing condition in predicting emotional well-being <b>at</b> follow <b>up</b> were not detected and support for the matching hypothesis proposed by Niles et al (2014) was not found. In a marginally significant model, social constraints had a significant effect and interacted with writing condition to predict quality of life <b>at</b> follow <b>up,</b> such that participants with high baseline levels of social constraints benefitted more from the fact control condition, whereas participants with low baseline levels of social constraints benefitted more from the expressive writing condition. Finally, cancer-related intrusive thoughts mediated the effect of social constraints on emotional well-being <b>at</b> follow <b>up</b> but not on quality of life <b>at</b> follow <b>up.</b> Cancer-related avoidance was not found to mediate the effect of social constraints on either emotional well-being <b>at</b> follow <b>up</b> or quality of life <b>at</b> follow <b>up...</b>|$|R

5|$|As the {{hurricane}} neared the Florida Keys on September25, its eye reformed and became more pronounced on satellite imagery. The reorganization {{led to an}} increase in intensity, and at about 1530UTC, Georges made landfall near Key West with winds of 105mph (160km/h). The hurricane's forward motion shifted to west-northwest, and forecast models indicated that Georges would re-attain Category 3 status before making landfall along the northern Gulf Coast. The slow motion of the storm led to an erratic track, mainly caused by westward wobbles of the eye. Vertical wind shear was estimated <b>at</b> <b>up</b> to 35mph (55km/h), restricting outflow within {{the hurricane}} and confining the most intense convection to {{the eastern side of the}} circulation.|$|E

5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1536 {{there was a great}} muster, {{reckoned}} <b>at</b> <b>up</b> to 40,000 in number, at Horncastle in Lincolnshire. The nervous gentry managed, with difficulty, to disperse these masses—who had tried unsuccessfully to negotiate with the king by petition. The Pilgrimage of Grace was a more serious matter. Revolt spread through Yorkshire, and the rebels gathered at York. Robert Aske, their leader, negotiated the restoration of sixteen of the twenty-six northern monasteries, which had actually been dissolved. However, the promises made to them by the Duke of Suffolk were ignored on the king's orders. Suffolk was instructed to put the rebellion down. Forty-seven of the Lincolnshire rebels were executed, and 132 from the northern pilgrimage. Further rebellions took place in Cornwall in early 1537, and in Walsingham (in Norfolk). These received similar treatment.|$|E

Ultimately, the diesel was never installed {{in any of the}} König-class battleships.

5|$|Seamounts are {{exceptionally}} {{important to}} their biome ecologically, but their role in their environment is poorly understood. Because they project out above the surrounding sea floor, they disturb standard water flow, causing eddies and associated hydrological phenomena that ultimately result in water movement in an otherwise still ocean bottom. Currents have been measured <b>at</b> <b>up</b> to 0.9knots, or 48centimeters per second. Because of this upwelling seamounts often carry above-average plankton populations, seamounts are thus centers where the fish that feed on them aggregate, in turn falling prey to further predation, making seamounts important biological hotspots.|$|E

Forming in the Pacific Ocean on September 27, the storm crossed into the Gulf of Mexico—one {{of only a}} handful of known storms to do so—and began to intensify. It ultimately peaked with winds corresponding to high-end Category 2 status on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale and made landfall near Freeport, Texas, on the morning of October 4. It rapidly weakened after moving inland and dissipated several days later. Damage from the storm was moderate, although the hurricane temporarily cut off the city of Galveston from the mainland.
