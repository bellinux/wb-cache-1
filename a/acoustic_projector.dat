40|$|For {{acoustic}} {{identification of}} objects in a littoral environment, there are generally three frequency bands of interest; 1 kHz to 10 kHz, 10 kHz to 100 kHz and 100 kHz to 1 MHz, where the selection of these bands is dependent upon the specific Navy mission. This paper will discuss {{the progress of the}} Naval Research Laboratory in developing <b>acoustic</b> <b>projector</b> prototypes to address the lower two frequency bands for unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) and/or autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) applications. The band of 1 kHz to 10 kHz is currently being addressed using cymbal flextensional vibrator elements sandwiched into thin panels. In-air data has shown that high levels of acoustic displacement at low frequencies are possible with these devices while more recent in-water data has verified these expectations. This success has led to modelling and prototyping of similar devices for shallow water regions. The frequency range of 10 kHz to 100 kHz has been investigated for several years where the <b>acoustic</b> <b>projector</b> was originally reported during AeroSense 1998. The results of integrating the NRL broadband projector into the NSWC/Coastal Systems Station (CSS) synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) UUV will be presented. This system integration considers the projector as a constant source level over the 10 kHz to 100 kHz band by driving the 100 lcHz resonant transducer with an inversely shaped transformer. The presentation will conclude with a discussion of the future development trends in shallow water transducers for AUV and UUV missions...|$|E

The prototype panels, measuring 100 -mm by 100 -mm by 6. 35 -mm thick exhibit a high acoustic output at a relatively low in-water resonance frequency.

40|$|Passive time {{reversal}} has aroused considerable {{interest in}} underwater communications as a computationally inexpensive means of mitigating the intersymbol interference {{introduced by the}} channel using a receiver array. In this paper the basic technique is extended by adaptively weighting sensor contributions to partially compensate for degraded focusing due to mismatch between the assumed and actual medium impulse responses. Two algorithms are proposed, one of which restores constructive interference between sensors, {{and the other one}} minimizes the output residual as in widely used equalization schemes. These are compared with plain time reversal and variants that employ postequalization and channel tracking. They are shown to improve the residual error and temporal stability of basic time reversal with very little added complexity. Results are presented for data collected in a passive time-reversal experiment that was conducted during the MREA’ 04 sea trial.

40|$|Measuring the {{performance}} of hydrophones in submarine and surface ship towed arrays at low frequencies in the Leesburg test facility (Okahumpka, FL) is achieved using ambient noise as a calibration source. The preferred method of calibration that relies on a known, repeatable sound source is not implemented because the equipment capable of generating sound at such low frequencies does not currently exist. ^ This project examines the feasibility of implementing a moving magnet actuator (MMA) as the motor force in a very low frequency (VLF) underwater <b>acoustic</b> <b>projector.</b> MMAs {{have the potential to}} advance low frequency projector technology by providing large linear displacements and large force outputs in a small package. To explore this potential, three methods of investigation are performed in this study: analytical modeling, numerical modeling, and experimental testing. Analytical modeling is performed in Matlab using fundamental equations for a simple acoustic point source. Numerical modeling is represented as a fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problem and is solved using the finite element program Abaqus. Experimental testing is conducted by placing a load on a Bose MMA to simulate the mass of the VLF projector’s water displacement. ^ Analytical and numerical modeling efforts estimate a projector source level of over 125 dB// 1 μPa @ 1 m at 1 Hz and over 180 dB// 1 μPa @ 1 m at 30 Hz. The experimental efforts find that the Bose MMA operates at displacements necessary to achieve sound pressure levels calculated from the analytical and numerical models. This study indicates that an MMA is a suitable force generator for the VLF projector and explores future work necessary for VLF projector design, manufacture, and operation. ...|$|E
40|$|Integral geoacoustic {{properties}} of the sea bottom were determined from full-field inversion of broad-band, waterborne, acoustic propagation data. The data were obtained during the YELLOW SHARK 94 experiment along a 15 -km mildly range-dependent transect at a shallow water site in the western Mediterranean. Seven tones from 200 Hz to 800 Hz were transmitted simultaneously by a mid-depth <b>acoustic</b> <b>projector,</b> bottom-moored at different ranges from a vertical array that spanned the water column below the thermocline. Extensive oceanographic and geophysical information were obtained in situ to support and validate the inversion. Matched-field processing {{was applied to the}} received pressure fields for each tone frequency. Optimization of the environmental parameters was performed simultaneously across all propagated frequencies. A maximum-likelihood objective function included the linear (Bartlett) cross correlator at the individual frequencies. Genetic algorithms searched for the global minimum of this objective function. The convergence and accuracy of the inversion were determined from statistical anallysis of the a posteriori distribution of the candidate environmental models produced by the search algorithm. The following conclusions were drawn from this study. 1) For a fixed source-vertical array configuration broad-band tomographic measurements were a sine qua non to obtain meaningful inversion results. 2) The broad-band inversion provided considerable stability and robustness with respect to volume and bottom variabilities. 3) Corresponding single-frequency inversions performed under the exact same conditions produced erratic results. 4) Integral geoacoustic {{properties of}} the bottom were effectively determined within the constraints imposed by the bottom parameterization. 5) More detailed and accurate properties were obtained by including the range dependence of ocean sound-speed profile in the forward modeling. 6) The broad-band-inverted sound-speed profile, attenuation, density, and thickness of the top clay layer, and sound speed of the underlying silt layer, were in close agreement with the independent geophysical measurements.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedContinuing U. S. Navy {{interest in the}} development of light-weight, low-volume, broadband, underwater <b>acoustic</b> <b>projectors</b> and receivers is the principal motivation for this research topic. Acoustic cymbal transducers, so named for their geometric similarity to the percussion instruments, are miniature "class V" flextensional transducers that consist of a piezoelectric ceramic drive element bonded to two opposing cymbal-shaped metal shells. Operating as mechanical transformers, the two metal shells convert the naturally large generative force of a piezoelectric ceramic in the radial mode into increased volume displacement at the metal shell surface to obtain usable source levels and sensitivities in a broad frequency range. The magnified displacement makes the acoustic cymbal element a potential alternative to acoustic transduction technologies presently used to generate and receive Navy sonar frequencies. Potential benefits to utilizing this technology are generating or receiving broadband sound, at sonar frequencies in a thin, low volume, conformable package. Applications of this technology have been limited because air-backed acoustic cymbal elements undergo degradation in performance when exposed to elevated hydrostatic pressure (i. e., deep ocean and extreme littoral water applications). This research shows that consistent and reliable acoustic performance can be achieved with cymbal-based transducers at hydrostatic pressures of interest to the Navy.

40|$|A hydro-acoustic {{imaging system}} was {{tested in a}} pilot study on distant {{localization}} of elements of the Baikal underwater neutrino telescope. For this innovative approach, based on broad band acoustic echo signals and strictly avoiding any active acoustic elements on the telescope, the imaging system was temporarily installed just below the ice surface, while the telescope stayed in its standard position at 1100 m depth. The system comprised an antenna with four <b>acoustic</b> <b>projectors</b> positioned {{at the corners of}} a 50 meter square; acoustic pulses were "linear sweep-spread signals" - multiple-modulated wide-band signals (10 - 22 kHz) of 51. 2 s duration. Three large objects (two string buoys and the central electronics module) were localized by the 3 D acoustic imaging, with a accuracy of ~ 0. 2 m (along the beam) and ~ 1. 0 m (transverse). We discuss signal forms and parameters necessary for improved 3 D acoustic imaging of the telescope, and suggest a layout of a possible stationary bottom based 3 D imaging setup. The presented technique may be of interest for neutrino telescopes of km 3 -scale and beyond, as a flexible temporary or as a stationary tool to localize basic telescope elements, while these are completely passive.

A single au-tonomous hydrophone was moored at a reference position within the working area. Acoustic transmissions were performed {{with a pair of}} <b>acoustic</b> <b>projectors,</b> from a small vessel. Three ocean transects were considered: the vessel departed from a position close to the moored receiver, accomplishing a set of transmission stations on a straight line, at distances of up to 4 km. For modelling purposes, emitter and receiver swapped roles, which resembles to what is usually called a synthetic array. The acoustic data was inverted for seafloor parameters, and source and receiver depths. The inversion procedure carried out herein is similar to Matched-Field Processing (MFP) : the problem was posed as an optimisation problem where the replica field was obtained for candidate solutions. The objective function was the root mean square error (RMSE) between the observed transmission loss (TL) and that generated by forward mod-elling. The search of the solution was carried out with a genetic algorithm (GA), in an attempt to minimise that error. Empirical distributions were generated with candidate solutions of final GA generations, in order obtain a solution of the inverse problem as a maximum a posteriori estimate. The empirical distributions were in general compact and the RMSE achieved values below 1 dB. The results indicate that in underwater noise monitoring activities, using a single hydrophone for modelling purposes may be a viable option...|$|R
25|$|Active sonar is {{also used}} to measure {{distance}} through water between two sonar transducers or a combination of a hydrophone (underwater <b>acoustic</b> microphone) and <b>projector</b> (underwater <b>acoustic</b> speaker). A transducer is a device that can transmit and receive acoustic signals ("pings"). When a hydrophone/transducer receives a specific interrogation signal it responds by transmitting a specific reply signal. To measure distance, one transducer/projector transmits an interrogation signal and measures the time between this transmission and the receipt of the other transducer/hydrophone reply. The time difference, scaled by the speed of sound through water and divided by two, is the distance between the two platforms. This technique, when used with multiple transducers/hydrophones/projectors, can calculate the relative positions of static and moving objects in water.|$|R

This study explored a method for designing an <b>acoustic</b> enclosure for <b>projectors</b> that generate noises in a wide band frequency range.

Fans are required in projectors that use lamps as an illumination source to dissipate the heat emitted from their lamps.

Based on the data obtained from the measurements, the sound level of the projector and the design of the enclosure were studied. Another aspect of this project was {{to find a way to}} cool down the projector while it was operating in a completely sealed enclosure. Based on the information about the power consumption of the projector and the temperature range that the projector can safely operates under, the cooling system was proposed. Finally the sound and temperature measurements were performed on the fabricated prototype of the enclosure to evaluate its functionality. ...|$|R
