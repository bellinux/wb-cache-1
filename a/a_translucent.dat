5|$|Vanadinite is very brittle, {{producing}} small, conchoidal fragments when fractured. Its hardness is 3–4 on the Mohs scale, {{about the}} same as a copper coin.

5|$|The {{eyes of the}} octopus {{are large}} and {{are at the top}} of the head. They are similar in {{structure}} to those of a fish and are enclosed in a cartilaginous capsule fused to the cranium. The cornea is formed from <b>a</b> <b>translucent</b> epidermal layer and the slit-shaped pupil forms a hole in the iris and lies just behind. The lens is suspended behind the pupil and photoreceptive retinal cells cover the back of the eye. The pupil can be adjusted in size and a retinal pigment screens incident light in bright conditions.|$|E

5|$|The spherical spores measure 3–5μm, {{including}} an outer covering (an epispore) of about 0.5μm. Their surface texture ranges from smooth to faintly warted. They have an oil droplet, and <b>a</b> <b>translucent</b> pedicel (a small stalk) up to 2.5μm long. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 10–12.5μm long by 5–7.5μm wide. The capillitium comprises short, highly branched (resembling antlers) and entangled threads measuring 5–10μm wide with walls up to 2.5μm thick. Capillitial threads {{do not have}} septa.|$|E
5|$|Hygrophorus bakerensis, {{commonly}} known as the Mt. Baker waxy cap, the brown almond waxy cap or the tawny almond waxy cap, is a species of fungus in the Hygrophoraceae family. It is characterized by its medium to large, relatively slender-statured fruit bodies with an almond odor, and growth often on or near rotting conifer wood. The slimy cap is brown in the center and cream to white near its curved edges. The gills and the stem are white, and in moist environments are often covered with droplets of <b>a</b> <b>translucent</b> liquid. The mushroom is known only from the United States, where it is common in coniferous forests throughout the Pacific Northwest. It was initially collected in Washington State on Mount Baker, a volcano. Although edible, the mushroom is not considered to be of high quality.|$|E
5|$|The VP {{update of}} 1991 {{featured}} cosmetic changes and mechanical however most were not visible {{unless you were}} to pull the motor down; and a very similar revised 3.8-litre V6 and 5.0-litre V8 engines from the VN were carried over. The 2.0-litre straight-four engine previously available in New Zealand was discontinued. Exterior cosmetic changes included <b>a</b> <b>translucent</b> acrylic grille on the base level Executive and Berlina, with a colour-coded grille for the S and SS, and a chrome grille for Calais. Updated tail lights and boot garnishes were {{also a part of}} the changes, which were different for each model, with the Berlina having grey stripes and the Calais chrome stripes. Semi-trailing arm independent rear suspension became standard on the Calais and SS, but was made an option on lower-end models in lieu of the live rear axle, improving ride and handling.|$|E

5|$|The {{first version}} of the Gorgon, Medusa, was to have five feet, but due to {{perceived}} animation difficulties, the final version had one tail. Other Gorgons in the game adhered to this design. The goddess Artemis was considered for inclusion in God of War: Ascension as a playable female character, offering alternative combat options. Game Director Todd Papy said {{she would have been}} depicted as half-human and half-feline, with the head and torso of a woman and the legs of a lioness. However, she was ultimately cut from the game and thus only appears in the original God of War as <b>a</b> <b>translucent</b> head.|$|E
5|$|The spores are spherical, and 3.5–4.5µm in diameter. They {{are covered}} with short narrow {{abruptly}} terminating projections of <b>a</b> <b>translucent</b> (hyaline) substance, which turn a pale cinnamon brown in potassium hydroxide, and a dark dull brown (nearly sepia) when stained with iodine. The capillitium is made of {{what appears to be}} encrusted cylindrical filaments 3–6µm in diameter, of a color varying from hyaline to dull yellowish brown in potassium hydroxide, and yellowish in iodine; its walls are thickened {{to the point where the}} interior (lumen) appears as only a line. Either two or four spores are attached to the basidia, and the sterigmata (extensions of the basidia that attach the spores) are long, up to 20µm. Geastrum triplex does not have cystidia.|$|E
5|$|The tuatara has a third {{eye on the}} top of {{its head}} called the parietal eye. It has its own lens, a parietal plug which resembles a cornea, retina with {{rod-like}} structures, and degenerated nerve connection to the brain. The parietal eye is only visible in hatchlings, which have <b>a</b> <b>translucent</b> patch at the top centre of the skull. After four to six months, it becomes covered with opaque scales and pigment. Its purpose is unknown, but it may be useful in absorbing ultraviolet rays to produce vitamin D, as well as to determine light/dark cycles, and help with thermoregulation. Of all extant tetrapods, the parietal eye is most pronounced in the tuatara. It is part of the pineal complex, another part of which is the pineal gland, which in tuatara secretes melatonin at night. Some salamanders have been shown to use their pineal bodies to perceive polarised light, and thus determine the position of the sun, even under cloud cover, aiding navigation.|$|E
