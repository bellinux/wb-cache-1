5000|$|The patches {{have been}} shown to provide rapid and {{sustained}} delivery to underlying tissues without significantly increasing levels of drug concentration in the blood when compared to the traditional oral administration. Ketoprofen undergoes metabolism in the liver via conjugation with glucuronic acid, CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 hydroxylation of the benzoyl ring, and reduction of its keto function. [...] Ketoprofen is used for its <b>antipyretic,</b> <b>analgesic,</b> and anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 (COX-1 and COX-2) enzymes reversibly, which decreases production of proinflammatory prostaglandin precursors.|$|E
5000|$|A highly {{selective}} reversible inhibitor of the COX-2 isoform of cyclooxygenase, celecoxib inhibits {{the transformation of}} arachidonic acid to prostaglandin precursors. Therefore, it has <b>antipyretic,</b> <b>analgesic</b> and anti-inflammatory properties. Nonselective NSAIDs (such as aspirin, naproxen, and ibuprofen) inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2. Inhibition of COX-1 (which celecoxib does not inhibit at therapeutic concentrations) inhibits the production of prostaglandins {{and the production of}} thromboxane A2, a platelet activator. COX-1 is traditionally defined as a constitutively expressed [...] "housekeeping" [...] enzyme and plays a role in the protection of the gastrointestinal mucosa, kidney hemodynamics, and platelet thrombogenesis. COX-2, on the contrary, is extensively expressed in cells involved in inflammation and is upregulated by bacterial lipopolysaccharides, cytokines, growth factors, and tumor promoters. Celecoxib is approximately 10-20 times more selective for COX-2 inhibition over COX-1. It binds with its polar sulfonamide side chain to a hydrophilic side pocket region close to the active COX-2 binding site. In theory, this selectivity allows celecoxib and other COX-2 inhibitors to reduce inflammation (and pain) while minimizing gastrointestinal adverse drug reactions (e.g. stomach ulcers) that are common with nonselective NSAIDs.|$|E

We analyzed data from JECS involving cases where drugs were used for 12 months before pregnancy was diagnosed, between the time of diagnosis of pregnancy until week 12 of pregnancy, and after week 12 of pregnancy. Results: We analyzed data from 97, 464 pregnant women. The percentages of pregnant women who had taken one or more drugs and supplements before diagnosis of pregnancy, between the time of diagnosis of pregnancy until week 12 of pregnancy, and after week 12 of pregnancy, were 78. 4 %, 57. 1 %, and 68. 8 % respectively.

40|$|Abstract Background Pyrexia, algesia and {{inflammation}} {{are associated}} with several pathological conditions. Synthetic drugs available {{for the treatment of}} these conditions cause multiple unwanted effects. Several studies are ongoing worldwide to find natural healing agents with better safety profile. The current study was thus aimed at evaluating <b>antipyretic,</b> <b>analgesic</b> and anti-inflammatory activities of the methanolic extract of whole plant of V. betonicifolia (VBME). Methods VBME was employed to assess antipyretic activity in yeast induced hyperthermia. Analgesic profile was ascertained in acetic acid induced writhing, hot plat and tail immersion test. Nevertheless, the anti-inflammatory activity was tested in carrageenan induced paw edema and histamine induced inflammatory tests. BALB/c mice were used at test doses of 100, 200 and 300 mg/kg body weight intra peritoneally (i. p). Results In yeast induced pyrexia, VBME demonstrated dose dependently (78. 23 %) protection at 300 mg/kg, similar to standard drug, paracetamol (90 %) at 150 mg/kg i. p. VBME showed a dose dependent analgesia in various pain models i. e. acetic acid, hot plat and tail immersion having 78. 90 %, 69. 96 % and 68. 58 % protection respectively at 300 mg/kg. However, the analgesic action of VBME was completely antagonized by the injection of naloxone like opiate antagonists. Similarly carrageenan and histamine induces inflammation was significantly antagonized by VBME, 66. 30 % and 60. 80 % respectively at 300 mg/kg. Conclusions It is concluded that VBME has marked <b>antipyretic,</b> <b>analgesic</b> and anti-inflammatory activities in various animal models and this strongly supports the ethnopharmacological uses of Viola betonicifolia as <b>antipyretic,</b> <b>analgesic</b> and anti-inflammatory plant. </p...|$|E

An anti-oxidative effect of ACE was evaluated by using the DPPH anti-oxidant assay. The results showed that, after 5 hours of yeast injection, 400 and 800 mg/kg ACE significantly reduced the rectal temperature of rats. Mice were found significantly less sensitive to heat at an oral dose of 800 mg/kg ACE, after 60 and 90 min. No anti-inflammatory activity of ACE at an 800 mg/kg dose could be observed in the rat paw assay. An anti-oxidative activity of ACE was observed with an IC 50 value of 47. 18 g/ ml.
