5|$|Enthusiastic at first, the United States Air Force awarded Republic with a {{contract}} for 199 aircraft in September 1952. However, by March 1953, the USAF had reduced the order to 37 fighter-bombers and nine tactical reconnaissance aircraft, citing the approaching end of the Korean War. By the time the F-105 mock-up had been completed in October 1953, the aircraft had grown so large that the Allison J71 turbojet intended for it was abandoned {{in favor of the}} more powerful Pratt & Whitney J75. Anticipating a protracted development of the engine, it was expected that the first aircraft would use the smaller Pratt & Whitney J57. Near the end of 1953, the entire program was canceled by the USAF due to a number of delays <b>and</b> <b>uncertainties</b> regarding the aircraft. However, on 28 June 1954, the USAF officially ordered 15 F-105s (two YF-105As, four YF-105Bs, six F-105Bs, and three RF-105Bs) under the Weapon System designation WS-306A.|$|E

However, after the ban there was a steep decline in coverage of Sinn Féin and Republican views, with television appearances being reduced to 34 times in the following year, and the delays <b>and</b> <b>uncertainties</b> caused by ambiguities, voice-overs and subtitles often led to coverage and films being dropped entirely.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAttitudes {{regarding}} risk <b>and</b> <b>uncertainty</b> {{are important}} to the economic activity. This is the reason why {{the purpose of this paper}} is to point out to the differences between the risk phenomenon, on the one hand and the probability <b>and</b> <b>uncertainty,</b> on the other hand. An event has greater impact when it turns impossibility into possibility more or less likely. A series of studies provides support for this principle in decision under both risk <b>and</b> <b>uncertainty</b> <b>and</b> shows that people are less sensitive to uncertainty than to risk. That's way this paper provides a simple conceptual framework for discussing about risk <b>and</b> <b>uncertainty.</b> Communicating about risk <b>and</b> <b>uncertainty</b> may be difficult because <b>uncertainty</b> is multi-dimensional <b>and</b> there are different practical and philosophical approaches to it...|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between the social construction of risk, <b>uncertainty</b> <b>and</b> evaluation in the field of development cooperation. It explores the assumption that risk <b>and</b> <b>uncertainty</b> are unusually high in development cooperation. Perceptions of risk <b>and</b> <b>uncertainty</b> are cultural constructs. Several authors have identified perceptions of uncertainty {{as one of the most}} important dimensions in organizational cultures. An analysis of evaluation reports shows that risk <b>and</b> <b>uncertainty</b> often emerge as a consequence of operational factors. Evaluations indicate that uncertainty is higher in technological and environmental areas. Furthermore, there are a number of management techniques of handling risk <b>and</b> <b>uncertainty</b> that could be used on development projects. Why have evaluations not influenced the conception of risk <b>and</b> <b>uncertainty</b> more than they have? Three characteristics of the evaluation system are described and discussed. First, the evaluation system is found to send mixed signals in respect of risk <b>and</b> <b>uncertainty.</b> Second, the messages are weak. Evaluation reports are not sufficiently anchored in theory and practice to command respect and belief among a widespread constituency. Third, the signals from the evaluation system have become routine. The messages no longer alarm management and decision-makers. The article concludes by assessing the future of risk <b>and</b> <b>uncertainty</b> management, in particular how evaluation systems may become more relevant in this field...|$|R
5|$|Three {{years after}} Rainbow Program's deactivation, {{there is a}} {{resurgence}} of terrorist activities, with the White Mask being the most prominent. The terrorists' goals are unknown, yet they are causing chaos across the world. To counter this rising threat, the program is reactivated by a new leader who is simply known as Six (voiced by Angela Bassett). Six assembles a group of special forces operatives from different countries to face and combat the White Masks. Recruits go through multiple exercises {{to prepare them for}} future encounters with the White Masks, training to perform hostage rescue and bomb disposal. Eventually, the White Masks launch a chemical attack on a university (called Bartlett University), and the recruits are sent to disarm the bombs and eliminate the enemy presence. The operation is a massive success, though there are casualties. The story ends with Six affirming that the reactivation of Team Rainbow is the best and only choice in a time filled with risks <b>and</b> <b>uncertainties.</b> Team Rainbow is ready for their next mission – to hunt down the leader of their enemy – and they stand prepared to protect and defend their nation from terrorists.|$|E

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{comparison}} of depression <b>and</b> <b>uncertainty</b> in cardiac patient and normal persons. Materials and Methods: The present study has been done in a form of casual-comparative on 60 persons at the Bookan city hospital. In the present study, Beck Depression Inventory (1988), <b>and</b> Fristone <b>Uncertainty</b> Scale (1994) were employed to gather the required data. For data analysis, Manova, Pearson correlation coefficient and regression analysis methods by SPSS- 19 was used. Results: Finding supported, the rate of depression <b>and</b> <b>uncertainty</b> were higher in coronary heart disease than normal persons. There is meaningful relationship between depression <b>and</b> <b>uncertainty</b> (p= 0. 01). The result of regression analysis showed that about 14 % of depression variance was predicted by uncertainty. Conclusion: Results supported that depression <b>and</b> <b>uncertainty</b> are associated with CHD. These results for the use of psychological interventions focusing on depression <b>and</b> <b>uncertainty</b> in the prevention and treatment of Coronary Heart Disease can be important in treating cardiac patients...|$|R

25|$|There were {{probably}} {{several types of}} south-pointing chariot which worked differently. In {{most or all of}} them, the rotating road wheels mechanically operated a geared mechanism to keep the pointer aimed correctly. The mechanism had no magnets and did not automatically detect which direction was south. The pointer was aimed southward by hand {{at the start of a}} journey. Subsequently, whenever the chariot turned, the mechanism rotated the pointer relative to the body of the chariot to counteract the turn and keep the pointer aiming in a constant direction, to the south. Thus the mechanism did a kind of directional dead reckoning, which is inherently prone to cumulative errors <b>and</b> <b>uncertainties.</b> Some chariots' mechanisms may have had differential gears.

Travel 2.0 model allow user {{to create their own}} contents and exchange their words through globally interactive features on websites. The users also can contribute their experiences, images and suggestions regarding their trips on online travel communities. For example, TripAdvisor is an online travel community which enables user to rate and share autonomously their reviews and feedbacks on hotels and tourist destinations. Non pre-associate users can interact socially and discuss through discussion forums on Tripadvior. Social media, especially Travel 2.0 website, plays a crucial role in decision-making behaviours of travellers. The user-generated contents on social media tools {{have a significant impact on}} travellers’ choices and organisation preferences. The travel 2.0 emerged a radical change in receiving information methods of travellers from business-to-customer marketing into peer-to-peer reviews. The user-generated contents become a vital tool for helping a number of travellers manage their international travels for the first time visiting. The travellers tend to trust and rely on peer-to-peer reviews and virtual communications on social media rather than the information provided by travel supplier. In addition, An autonomous review feature on social media would help traveller reduce risks <b>and</b> <b>uncertainties</b> before purchasing stages. Social media is also a channel for customer complaints and negative feedbacks which can damage images of organisations and destinations. For example, a majority of UK travellers read customer reviews before booking hotels and the bookings of hotels receiving negative feedbacks would be refrained by half of customers. Therefore, the organisations should develop strategic plans to handle and manage the negative feedbacks on social media. Although the user-generated content and rating system on social media are out of business controls, the businesses can monitor those conversations and participate in communities to enhance a customer loyalty and maintain customer relationships.|$|E
