5|$|Alex convinces Principal Skinner {{to have a}} school-dance {{rather than}} the regular yearly event of apple picking. Skinner agrees, so Alex and Lisa, {{accompanied}} by Sherri, Terri, Janey and Allison visit the mall to purchase party supplies, but the girls detour and begin trying on outfits for the dance, despite Lisa's protests. The group leave the mall, none speaking to each other. Lisa decides not to attend the dance, but changes her mind {{and goes to the}} school to take tickets at the door, but later arrives and discovers the boys and girls <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> on different sides of the room, and explains to Alex that it is like this because they are only children, not adults.|$|E
5|$|At episode's end, Rose, Sarah Jane, Mickey, and the Doctor <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> in the TARDIS. Sarah Jane declines {{a second}} chance of {{travelling}} in the TARDIS, having finally decided {{to move on with}} her life and stop waiting for the Doctor. Mickey says he would like to join the TARDIS crew, a suggestion of which Sarah Jane approves. She then asks Rose to stay with the Doctor, and to find her one day if she needs to. Sarah Jane then gets a chance to part properly with the Doctor, who leaves her with a brand new K9 as a parting gift.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} {{painting}} met with mixed reactions from art critics and historians. Artists had previously tended to depict {{war in the}} high style of history painting, and Goya's unheroic description was unusual for the time. According to some early critical opinion the painting was flawed technically: the perspective is flat, or the victims and executioners <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> too close together to be realistic. Although these observations may be strictly correct, the writer Richard Schickel argues that Goya was not striving for academic propriety but rather to strengthen the overall impact of the piece.|$|E

5|$|Cave 2 {{is above}} {{and to the}} east of Cave1 and faces north. It was created in late 6th or early 7th century. It is smaller than Cave 1, {{somewhat}} similar in terms of its floor plan, but it is dedicated primarily to Vishnu. Cave2 is reached by climbing 64 steps from the first cave. The cave entrance is a verandah divided by four square pillars with ends as half pillars, all carved out of the monolithic stone face. The pillars have decorative carvings with frieze of ganas (mythical dwarfs) with various facial expressions. On {{the two sides of the}} entrance <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> dvarapalas (guardians) holding flowers, not weapons. Like Cave1, Cave 2 art reflects Hindu theology and arts.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} scene Harris and Klebold <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> outside their high school. The player guides {{them to the}} {{cafeteria}} to plant their timed propane bombs without being detected by security cameras or hall monitors. After the explosives are set, the two stop {{for a moment on}} a hill outside the school, discussing their alienation and hostility. After the bombs fail to explode as planned, Harris and Klebold decide to enter the school and murder as many people as they can; the final number killed is up to the player. After roaming around the school shooting innocents, Harris and Klebold commit suicide. A montage of clips showing Harris and Klebold's corpses, students comforting each other, and childhood photos of the gunmen plays.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. {{state of}} Connecticut has {{fourteen}} active lighthouses in the state, {{two of which}} are maintained as private aids; six <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> but inactive. Another was destroyed after its deactivation. The earliest lighthouse in the state was erected in 1760, but that tower, the first New London Harbor Light, was replaced in 1801, and its successor is the oldest surviving light in Connecticut, as well as the tallest. The last officially recognized lighthouse in the state, the Avery Point Light, was constructed in 1943, but was not lit until the following year. The Mystic Seaport Light, constructed in 1966, is a functioning replica housed with a historic Fresnel lens; it is classified as an unofficial and non-navigational aid.|$|E

5|$|The raven-bears, a new heraldic beast which {{combined}} several {{creatures that}} are important to aboriginal symbolism, were proposed by the heralds in honour of the United Nations' International Year of the World's Indigenous Peoples, also occurring in 1993. The raven-bears <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> on an outcrop of {{what is known as the}} Canadian Shield, a geological formation which the authority foundation is based on. The Canadian Shield is formed by rocks, which are covered in red coloured maple leaves and by golden maple seeds. The motto that was chosen is Latin for Let us honour those who honour our country.|$|E
5|$|After the service, some people—regular {{faithful}} or visitors—may ask {{to consult}} a healer {{in one of}} the small rooms of the temple—although the desservant who lives in the apartment adjacent to the temple is always available to receive suffering persons. During these consultations, both <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> before Antoine's image: the patient expresses for a few minutes the request that he wishes to obtain, and the healer prays, sometimes while touching the consultant's shoulder or hand, presumably to convey the fluid. The healer's work is said to put again the consultant in the love of God that will allow him to find himself the spiritual journey leading to healing. For this purpose, the healer has to discover the origin of the consultant's problem, which is, in Antoinist beliefs, always linked to a person's own history, and to understand that he should bear the consequences of what was done in a preceding life.|$|E
5|$|Malmö Stadion has {{an overall}} {{capacity}} of 26,500 spectators for sports, of which 14,000 <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> spectators. When hosting concerts, the stadium can host 25,000 spectators when {{the stage is}} on either long side of the stadium, or up to 40,000 when it is {{placed in front of}} either short side. It comprises two main stands on each of the long sides of the pitch: the Southern Stand and the Northern Stand, both of which have two tiers. The lower tier of the Northern Stand is terraced, and was the only tier of the stand until the upper, seated tier was built in 1992. The short sides of the pitch feature two minor terracing sections, respectively named the Eastern Stand and the Western Stand. When Malmö FF were based at the ground, the Northern Stand terracing was the section with the most season ticket holders, while the Eastern Stand was the section used to house away fans.|$|E
50|$|This mill was {{probably}} an achtkantmolen. It <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> in 1685. Located on the Noordvliet at , the mill was a bark mill originally, but was an oil mill in 1786. It <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> in 1832 but {{had gone by}} 1850.|$|R

5|$|The Spirit of Fire {{releases}} the new Halo, but faces immediate resistance upon {{it from the}} Banished. Back on the Ark, Alice-130 and Douglas-042 destroy enemy barricades and prevent reinforcements, including Atriox, from reaching the Halo; they then use the portal network to reach the Halo themselves. There, Professor Anders is escorted to the ring’s control room, where the firing system of the structure is deactivated and a signal beacon is set. Meanwhile, the Spirit of Fires forces are locked in a struggle with {{the remnants of the}} Banished. Anders finds the gravity controls for the Halo and uses them to raise the land that the remaining Banished <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> on into space where it disintegrates. The ground forces return to the Spirit of Fire, but Anders and the Halo enter slipspace as they cannot halt the jump's countdown. Before the Halo jumps, Anders promises to get help from the UNSC as soon as possible. On the Ark, Atriox and a legion of Banished still live, preparing for the next fight against the UNSC. Meanwhile, the Halo carrying Anders drops out of slipspace prematurely, only to encounter a Foreunner construct known as a Guardian.|$|E
5|$|The spatial {{structure}} and {{positioning of the}} mirror's reflection are such that PhilipIV and Mariana appear to be standing on the viewer's side of the pictorial space, facing the Infanta and her entourage. According to Janson, {{not only is the}} gathering of figures in the foreground for Philip and Mariana's benefit, but the painter's attention is concentrated on the couple, as he appears to be working on their portrait. Although they can only be seen in the mirror reflection, their distant image occupies a central position in the canvas, in terms of social hierarchy as well as composition. As spectators, our position in relation to the painting is uncertain. It has been debated whether the ruling couple <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> beside the viewer or have replaced the viewer, who sees the scene through their eyes. Lending weight to the latter idea are the gazes of three of the figures—Velázquez, the Infanta, and Maribarbola—who appear to be looking directly at the viewer.|$|E
5|$|The {{stadium is}} the third largest used by a Swedish {{football}} club, behind AIK's Friends Arena and Djurgårdens IF's and Hammarby IF's Tele2 Arena, both located in Stockholm. In league matches, the stadium has a capacity of 24,000, of which 18,000 are seated, and 6,000 <b>are</b> <b>standing.</b> In European matches, the 6,000 standing places are converted to 3,000 seats, making the stadium a 21,000-capacity all-seater. Swedbank Stadion opened in April 2009, and replaced Malmö Stadion, where Malmö FF had been based since 1958. The new ground was originally budgeted to cost 398million kronor, but ultimately cost 695million kronor (€79.7). It is a UEFA category 4-rated stadium, and is thus able to host all UEFA club competition matches, except for finals. The ground's record attendance, 24,148, was set in an Allsvenskan match between Malmö FF and Mjällby AIF on 7 November 2010: in this match, Malmö FF won 2–0 and clinched that year's national championship.|$|E
