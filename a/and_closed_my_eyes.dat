500|$|According to {{the park}} and Twitter posts {{selected}} by news media, public response during the soft opening was positive; Total Orlando gave the ride five stars for teenagers and four stars for adults. On Coaster101.com [...] "Ashley" [...] said that although the restraints were tight, they were comfortable and not as tight as those on other rides, adding: [...] "The drop on Falcon's Fury is different from any ride I have ever ridden. The best way I can describe it is that instead of leaving your stomach {{at the top of the}} tower, you take it with you to the bottom." [...] According to Florida Trip Guides, the ride was a good addition {{to the park}}'s attraction lineup: [...] "Falcon's Fury is not for the faint of heart. I have ridden dozens of drop towers but this one is different. Something about facing straight down and falling really makes you nervous." [...] Robert Niles of Theme Park Insider said that Falcon's Fury and other recent attractions were nearing the extreme of human tolerance; as a result, [...] "You're getting to the point where instead of making an attraction more popular by having it achieve some type of record, you're actually limiting the audience for that." [...] Randi Nissenbaum of Bay News 9 called the view from the top of the tower incredible, and although she was nervous at first she wanted to ride again. Sue Carlton of the Tampa Bay Times said, [...] "it was terrifying and thrilling and I held on as hard as I could and yelled <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and afterward stepped off rubber-kneed and exhilarated." ...|$|E

60|$|De Cartienne and Cecil seated {{themselves}} {{at a small}} round table and began to play almost immediately.

But Fate decided otherwise. I was really very sleepy, and, though I struggled against it, I was obliged to yield in the end.

Irons recalls, [...] "I was attracted to Cat's voice, I would go to the open mic <b>and</b> <b>close</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> zone out whenever she sang.

6000|$|... "As I {{felt the}} sickening {{sweep of the}} descent, I had instinctively {{tightened}} my hold upon the barrel, <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes.</b> For some seconds I dared not open them--while I expected instant destruction, and wondered that I was not already in my death-struggles with the water. But moment after moment elapsed. I still lived.

I took courage, and looked once again upon the scene.|$|E
60|$|But I {{could not}} sleep. I took more cream of tartar. It {{must be the}} heat of the bed-clothes, I decided, that excited my hives. And yet, {{whenever}} I ceased struggling for sleep, and lighted the lamp and read, my skin irritation decreased. But as soon as I turned out the lamp <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> I was troubled again. So hour after hour passed, through which, between vain attempts to sleep, I managed to wade through many pages of Rosny's Le Termite--a not very cheerful proceeding, I must say, concerned as it is with the microscopic and over-elaborate recital of Noel Servaise's tortured nerves, bodily pains, and intellectual phantasma. At last I tossed the novel aside, damned all analytical Frenchmen, and found some measure of relief in the more genial and cynical Stendhal.|$|E
60|$|I {{turned on}} my side, <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> seeking to sleep; and then quite {{suddenly}} I {{heard a sound}} of unutterable sweetness--a melody so faint and subtle that it had none of the form and rhythm of earthly music. I sat up, my breath almost arrested, and listened more intently. I could still hear it, but very faint and distant. It was as a sound of silver bells, {{and yet it was}} not quite that. I remembered the stories I had heard that day in the tavern at Pojetta, and the talk of the mystic melodies by which travellers had been drawn to the anchorite's abode. I noted the direction of the sound, and I determined to be guided by it, and to cast myself at the feet of that holy man, to implore of him who could heal bodies the miracle of my soul's healing and my mind's purging from its torment.|$|E

"At Holyhead I {{tried to}} get into a {{carriage}} with people that looked all right, but in a queer way there seemed always to be a crowd round me shoving and pushing me just the way I didn't want to go. There was something uncanny and frightening about it. In the end I found myself in a carriage with Mrs. Vandemeyer after all. I went out into the corridor, but all the other carriages were full, so I had to go back and sit down. I consoled myself with the thought that there were other people in the carriage--there was quite a nice-looking man and his wife sitting just opposite. So I felt almost happy about it until just outside London. I had leaned back <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes.</b> I guess they thought I was asleep, but my eyes weren't quite shut, and suddenly I saw the nice-looking man get something out of his bag and hand it to Mrs. Vandemeyer, and as he did so he WINKED....|$|E
60|$|Never did a pilgrim {{approach}} Niagara with deeper enthusiasm than mine. I had lingered {{away from}} it, and wandered to other scenes, because my treasury of anticipated enjoyments, comprising all {{the wonders of}} the world, had nothing else so magnificent, and I was loath to exchange the pleasures of hope for those of memory so soon. At length the day came. The stage-coach, with a Frenchman and myself on the back seat, had already left Lewiston, and {{in less than an hour}} would set us down in Manchester. I began to listen for the roar of the cataract, and trembled with a sensation like dread, as the moment drew nigh, when its voice of ages must roll, for the first time, on my ear. The French gentleman stretched himself from the window, and expressed loud admiration, while, by a sudden impulse, I threw myself back <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes.</b> When the scene shut in, I was glad to think, that for me the whole burst of Niagara was yet in futurity. We rolled on, and entered the village of Manchester, bordering on the falls.|$|E
6000|$|Yet, {{we enjoyed}} {{intervals}} of unalloyed contentment. When the twilight toned down the hard {{outlines of the}} oaks, and made shadowy clumps and formless masses of other bushes, it was quite romantic to sit by the window and inhale the faint, sad odor of the fennel in the walks below. Perhaps this economical pleasure was much enhanced by a picture in my memory, whose faded colors the odor of this humble plant never failed to restore. So I often sat there of evenings <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> until the forms and benches of a country schoolroom came back to me, redolent with the incense of fennel covertly stowed away in my desk, and gazed again in silent rapture on the round, red cheeks and long black braids of that peerless creature whose glance had often caused my cheeks to glow over the preternatural collar, which at that period of my boyhood it was my pride and privilege to wear. As I fear I may be often thought hypercritical and censorious in these articles, I am willing to record this {{as one of the}} advantages of our new house, not mentioned in the advertisement, nor chargeable in the rent. May the present tenant, who is a stock-broker, and who impresses me with the idea of having always been called [...] "Mr." [...] from his cradle up, enjoy this advantage, and try sometimes to remember he was a boy! ...|$|E

60|$|The {{house was}} very quiet. The leaves of a catalpa, across the roadway, hung motionless. Somebody yawned {{on the veranda}} below. I threw away my half-finished cigar, <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes.</b> I think I had not lost {{consciousness}} {{for more than a}} few seconds before I was awakened by the shaking and thrilling of the whole building. As I staggered to my feet, I saw the four pictures hanging against the wall swing outwardly from it on their cords, and my door swing back against the wall. At the same moment, acted upon by the same potential impulse, the door of the end room in the hall, opposite the stairs, also swung open. In that brief moment I had a glimpse of the interior of the room, of two figures, a man and a woman, the latter clinging to her companion in abject terror. It was only for an instant, for a second thrill passed through the house, the pictures clattered back against the wall, the door of the end room closed violently on its strange revelation, and my own door swung back also. Apprehensive of what might happen, I sprang toward it, but only to arrest it an inch or two before it should shut, when, as my experience had taught me, it might stick by the subsidence of the walls. But it did stick ajar, and remained firmly fixed in that position. From the clattering of the knob of the other door, and the sound of hurried voices behind it, I knew that the same thing had happened there when that door had fully closed.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was during}} that melancholy November when {{the death of}} the Princess Charlotte had {{diffused}} throughout Great Britain a more general sorrow than had ever before been known in these kingdoms; I was sitting alone at evening in my library, and my thoughts had wandered from the book before me to the circumstances which made this national calamity be felt almost like a private affliction. While I was thus musing the post-woman arrived. My letters told me there was nothing exaggerated in the public accounts of the impression which this sudden loss had produced; that wherever you went you found the women of the family weeping, and that men could scarcely speak of the event without tears; that in all the better parts of the metropolis there was a sort of palsied feeling which seemed to affect the whole current of active life; and that for several days there prevailed in the streets a stillness like that of the Sabbath, but without its repose. I opened the newspaper; it was still bordered with broad mourning lines, and was filled with details concerning the deceased Princess. Her coffin and the ceremonies at her funeral were described as minutely as the order of her nuptials and her bridal dress had been, in the same journal, scarce eighteen months before. [...] "Man," [...] says Sir Thomas Brown, [...] "is a noble animal, splendid in ashes, and pompous in the grave; solemnising nativities and deaths with equal lustre, nor omitting ceremonies of bravery in the infamy of his nature." [...] These things led me in spirit to the vault, and I thought of the memorable dead among whom her mortal remains were now deposited. Possessed with such imaginations I leaned back upon the sofa <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Of {{a sudden}} I knocked against the cliff {{with such a}} thump as almost bereft me of my sense; and, as reason twinkled back, I was amazed to find that I {{was in a state}} of rest, that the face of the precipice here {{inclined}} outwards at an angle which relieved me almost wholly of the burthen of my own weight, and that one of my feet was safely planted on a ledge. I drew one of the sweetest breaths in my experience, hugged myself against the rope, <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> in a kind of ecstasy of relief. It occurred to me next to see how far I was advanced on my unlucky journey, a point on which I had not a shadow of a guess. I looked up: there was nothing above me but the blackness of the night and the fog. I craned timidly forward and looked down. There, upon a floor of darkness, I beheld a certain pattern of hazy lights, some of them aligned as in thoroughfares, others standing apart as in solitary houses; and before I could well realise it, or had in the least estimated my distance, a wave of nausea and vertigo warned me to lie back and close my eyes. In this situation I had really but the one wish, and that was: something else to think of! Strange to say, I got it: a veil was torn from my mind, and I saw what a fool I was—what fools we had all been—and that I had no business to be thus dangling between earth and heaven by my arms. The only thing to have done was to have attached me to a rope and lowered me, and I had never the wit to see it till that moment! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'As I say, {{once she}} passed the knife, and twice; but she was weak with hunger, {{and it was not}} meant that I should die. Yet was I minded to stay in that place, <b>and</b> to <b>close</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> in the last long sleep with those whose lives had crossed with mine and led my feet on unknown trails.

60|$|I put out {{my light}} {{as soon as}} {{possible}} <b>and</b> resolutely <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> for a street lamp opposite my window would not allow the room to fade into obscurity, and, as long as the hardness of the bed prevented me from sleeping, my thoughts ran back to the chamber of the favored guest, but my conscience stood by me. Cathay is a country where it is necessary to be very careful.|$|R
60|$|Perhaps I {{remained}} awake {{while one}} might have counted twenty; but I am confident {{it was no longer}} than that, <b>and</b> then I <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> not to open them again until conscious of a heavy blow on the soles of my feet.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{he turned}} to me and said, 'Fan, do you hear that robin--that little mystic robin-redbreast? Listen, he will sing again in less than twenty seconds.' And almost before he had {{finished}} speaking, while I was looking at him, a change came over him, and his face was of the colour of ashes; and he said, with a kind of moan and so low that I could scarcely catch the last words, 'Oh, this is cruel, cruel!' And almost at the same moment there came a rush of blood from his mouth, and he started forward and would have fallen to the ground had I not caught him and held him in my arms. I called to Constance, over and over again, but she did not hear me--no one in the house heard me. Oh, how horrible it was--for I knew that he was dying--to hear the sounds of the house, voices talking and the maid singing, and a boy whistling not far off, and to call and call and not be heard! Then a dreadful faintness came over me, and I could call no more; I shivered like a leaf <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> and my heart seemed to stand still, and still I held him, his head on my breast--held him so that he did not fall. Then at last I was able to call again, and someone must have heard, for in a few moments I saw Constance coming along the walk running with all her speed, and the others following. But I knew that he was already dead, for he had grown quite still, and his clenched hand opened and dropped like a piece of lead on my knee.|$|E
60|$|Yet {{how could}} I resign myself? Without love, without sympathy, without communion with any, how could I meet the morning sun, {{and with it}} trace its oft {{repeated}} journey to the evening shades? Why did I continue to live-- why not throw off the weary weight of time, and with my own hand, let out the fluttering prisoner from my agonized breast?--It was not cowardice that withheld me; for the true fortitude was to endure; and death had a soothing sound accompanying it, that would easily entice me to enter its demesne. But this I would not do. I had, from the moment I had reasoned on the subject, instituted myself the subject to fate, and the servant of necessity, the visible laws of the invisible God--I believed that my obedience {{was the result of}} sound reasoning, pure feeling, and an exalted sense of the true excellence and nobility of my nature. Could I have seen in this empty earth, in the seasons and their change, the hand of a blind power only, most willingly would I have placed my head on the sod, <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> on its loveliness for ever. But fate had administered life to me, when the plague had already seized on its prey--she had dragged me by the hair from out the strangling waves--By such miracles she had bought me for her own; I admitted her authority, and bowed to her decrees. If, after mature consideration, such was my resolve, it was doubly necessary that I should not lose the end of life, the improvement of my faculties, and poison its flow by repinings without end. Yet how cease to repine, since there was no hand near to extract the barbed spear that had entered my heart of hearts? I stretched out my hand, and it touched none whose sensations were responsive to mine. I was girded, walled in, vaulted over, by seven-fold barriers of loneliness. Occupation alone, if I could deliver myself up to it, would be capable of affording an opiate to my sleepless sense of woe. Having determined to make Rome my abode, at least for some months, I made arrangements for my accommodation--I selected my home. The Colonna Palace was well adapted for my purpose. Its grandeur-- its treasure of paintings, its magnificent halls were objects soothing and even exhilarating.|$|E
60|$|We passed on, {{and found}} the view of it better, as we thought, from a farther point along the road. The raindrops began to spatter down faster, and we took shelter under an {{impending}} precipice, where the ledge of rock had been blasted and hewn away to form the road. Our refuge {{was not a very}} convenient and comfortable one, so we took advantage of the partial cessation of the shower to turn homeward, but had not gone far when we met mamma and all her train. As we were close by the castle entrance, we thought it advisable to seek admission, though rather doubtful whether the Swiss gendarme might not deem it a sin to let us into the castle on Sunday. But he very readily admitted us under his covered drawbridge, and called an old man from within the fortress to show us whatever was to be seen. This latter personage was a staid, rather grim, and Calvinistic-looking old worthy; but he received us without scruple, and forthwith proceeded to usher us into a range of most dismal dungeons, extending along the basement of the castle, on a level with the surface of the lake. First, if I remember aright, we came to what he said had been a chapel, and which, at all events, looked like an aisle of one, or rather such a crypt as I have seen beneath a cathedral, being a succession of massive pillars supporting groined arches,--a very admirable piece of gloomy Gothic architecture. Next, we came to a very dark compartment of the same dungeon range, where he pointed to a sort of bed, or what might serve for a bed, hewn in the solid rock, and this, our guide said, had been the last sleeping-place of condemned prisoners on the night before their execution. The next compartment was still duskier and dismaller than the last, and he bade us cast our eyes up into the obscurity and see a beam, where the condemned ones used to be hanged. I looked and looked, <b>and</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> so as to see the clearer in this horrible duskiness on opening them again. Finally, I thought I discerned the accursed beam, {{and the rest of the}} party were certain that they saw it. Next beyond this, I think, was a stone staircase, steep, rudely cut, and narrow, down which the condemned were brought to death; and beyond this, still on the same basement range of the castle, a low and narrow [corridor] through which we passed and saw a row of seven massive pillars, supporting two parallel series of groined arches, like those in the chapel which we first entered. This was Bonnivard's prison, and the scene of Byron's poem.|$|E
