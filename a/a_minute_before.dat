5|$|In the 2002–03 season, Baroš scored {{twice on}} his Premiership debut away to Bolton Wanderers on 14 September 2002, as Liverpool won 32 away. Baroš was a {{substitute}} in the 2003 Football League Cup Final against Manchester United. He entered {{the game in}} the second half, but did not play {{to the end of the}} game, being substituted himself <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>before</b> the end of the game. Liverpool won the game 2–0 to win the cup, the first major trophy of Baroš' career. Towards the end of the season, he scored twice in a 6–0 away win over already-relegated West Bromwich Albion in April 2003. He ended his first season in the Premiership with 12 goals for the club.|$|E

In {{front of a}} crowd of 49,465 in Bolton, Cardiff won by two goals to nil, with further goals from Ferguson and Davies. Following this round, {{alongside}} Arsenal, they were {{one of only two}} teams from the Football League First Division who remained in the competition.

Sam Irving put the Welsh team ahead after nine minutes, before Davies made it two on 21 minutes. Chelsea received a penalty, but the shot by Andrew Wilson was saved by Farquharson. Albert Thain scored for Chelsea <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>before</b> half time. Bob Turnbull equalised for Chelsea, four minutes into the second half. A further penalty was given, this time to Cardiff after Harry Wilding handled the ball. This time, Ferguson scored, putting Cardiff ahead once more and winning them the match.|$|E

5|$|On {{the same}} lap Irvine overtook his {{teammate}} Herbert for tenth position. Wurz {{crashed into the}} barriers at turn 1 {{and was forced to}} retire. Gené retired on lap 22 with a gearbox issue as his teammate Mazzacane subsequently collided with the barriers at turn one on the same lap and had to retire from the event. Herbert became the first driver to make a pit stop on lap 27 although his pit crew came unprepared and Herbert was stationary for half <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>before</b> he exited in 17th position. On the 31st lap, Diniz made contact with the barriers at turn one and he damaged his left rear wheel, causing him to retire. Häkkinen's pace was reduced by lap 36 as he slowed with an blockage on his brake pedal and made an unscheduled pit stop. His team's mechanics opened his car's inspection hatch and rearranged radio cables. They subsequently removed a data transmitter which was the cause the blockage and Häkkinen rejoined in 9th. Trulli became the next retirement of the race when he pulled {{to the side of the}} track with a gearbox problem on the following lap.|$|E
5|$|Following the season, Chamakh turned {{professional}} {{and signed a}} three-year contract with Bordeaux. He spent {{the first half of}} the 2002–03 campaign playing in the fourth division, but following the winter break, was called up to the senior team by manager Elie Baup. Chamakh made his professional debut on 19 January 2003 in the team's Coupe de la Ligue match against Metz. He appeared as a substitute and played 15 minutes in a 1–0 defeat. Chamakh made his league debut three weeks later in a 2–0 home defeat to Bastia again appearing as a substitute. On 20 May, he scored his first professional goal against Nice, netting the equalizing goal just <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>before</b> injury time in a 1–1 draw. Chamakh appeared in 14 games, always as a substitute, during the campaign. In the 2003–04 season, he was promoted to the senior team permanently by new manager Michel Pavon and made his first professional league start on 1 November 2003 in a 1–0 win over Marseille. In the team's following match, Chamakh scored the opening goal in a 1–1 draw with Strasbourg just before halftime. However, midway through the second half, he received his first career red card after incurring a second yellow. Upon returning from his one-game suspension, Chamakh developed into a regular starter for the club, scoring goals in consecutive matches against Metz and Montpellier. He finished the league campaign with six goals in 25 matches. In the club's UEFA Cup campaign, Chamakh netted four times in eight appearances.|$|E

The aircraft transmitted Positional Operational Meteorological Reports at approximately one-hour intervals from 00:10 to 04:25 on 2 February.

25|$|Near {{the south}} exit {{close to the}} main bar, {{opposite}} end of the building from the Cabaret Room, a wedding reception drew to a close around 8:30p.m. in the Zebra Room, near the building's main entrance; some of its guests had complained of the room being excessively warm with loud explosions from beneath the floor, and the group left the building before the end of their allotted time. The room remained vacant from their departure until <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>before</b> 9 p.m., when an employee smelled smoke and opened the Zebra Room's door to confirm the presence of smoke. She asked another employee to call the Fire Department while she and others grabbed any available fire extinguishers and began trying to fight the flames. Though the employees were not aware of it, their opening of the Zebra Room's door allowed enough oxygen into the room to cause what had been a smoldering fire in the room's drop ceiling to flashover and begin to spread rapidly. It quickly became clear that fire extinguishers could not suppress the fast-growing fire. The Fire Department was alerted to the fire at 9:01p.m. and was on the scene by 9:05; as they approached, firefighters on the first emergency vehicles could already see smoke coming from the building.|$|E
25|$|After a {{break in}} competition, Sagan came back in May at the Tour of California. On the first stage, he {{finished}} second, in the slipstream of Mark Cavendish. He again came in second position {{on the next day}} to Cavendish, but this time he lost by half-a-wheel. On stage 3, Sagan once more reaped second position after a lone breaker, Toms Skujiņš, made it to the finish <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>before</b> him. On Stage 4, Sagan won the day by powering away from Wouter Wippert and Cavendish on the small incline before the line. As he crossed the finish, Sagan banged his front wheel twice on the tarmac and treated the crowd to a no-footed wheelie afterward to celebrate. On the fifth stage, Sagan came in third position. However, in the ensuing Time Trial in Santa Clarita, Sagan imposed himself on the flat and slightly technical circuit, grabbing the general classification jersey in the process. On the following day's seventh stage climb up Mount Baldy, Sagan lost the overall lead to Julian Alaphilippe, however he put in a surprisingly strong performance to end the day two seconds behind Alaphilippe in the overall standings, and giving him a chance of taking the general classification through time bonuses on the final stage. He took a second out of Alaphilippe's lead in the intermediate sprint on the last stage to Pasadena, before pipping Tyler Farrar for third place on the finish line, taking a four-second bonus which gave him the overall win by three seconds.|$|E

25|$|The Badgers {{traveled}} to Champaign, Illinois, {{looking for their}} first road win of the season. The Illini started the game with the ball but ended up going backwards on their first drive and were forced to punt. The Badgers took over with great field position at their own 47-yard line. Five plays later, Wisconsin was on the board first with a 2-yard touchdown run by RB James White. After a three-and-out for the Illini, the Badgers struck again {{this time it was}} RB Melvin Gordon with a 26-yard touchdown run. On the next Illini drive, QB Nathan Scheelhaase fumbled on the first play of the drive and the Badgers DE Ethan Hemer recovered at the Illinois 8-yard line. Three plays later, the Badgers extended their lead with a 2-yard touchdown pass to TE Brian Wozniak from QB Joel Stave. Back-to-back three-and-outs for both teams gave the ball back to the Illini late in the first quarter. The Illini were driving the ball into Wisconsin territory as the first quarter came to a close, the Badgers leading 21–0. The Illini would continue to move the ball and got down to the Wisconsin 3-yard line but on third down, Nathan Scheelhaase was sacked by LB Derek Landisch. The Illini K Taylor Zalewski kicked a 31-yard field goal and got Illinois on the board. Wisconsin would punt on their next drive and then Illinois responded with a quick 4-play drive that was capped with a 1-yard touchdown run by RB Josh Ferguson. The Badgers would then extend their lead with a 10-play scoring drive with Melvin Gordon punching in a 1-yard touchdown run. Once again, Illinois would score on their next drive with a 1-yard touchdown pass to TE Matt LeCosse from QB Aaron Bailey with less than <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>before</b> half.

[...] The flight {{suddenly}} dropped [...] in half <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>before</b> the hijackers managed to stabilize the aircraft. The exact time at which Flight93 came under the hijackers' control cannot be determined.

While the other hijacked flights were taken by five-man teams, Flight93 had only four hijackers, leading to speculation of a possible 20th hijacker. The 9/11 Commission believed that Mohammed al-Qahtani was the likely candidate for this role, but was unable to participate as he had been denied entry into the United States one month earlier. With many passengers saying in phone calls that they saw only three hijackers, the 9/11 Commission believed Jarrah remained seated until the crew were overpowered and passengers were moved to the back of the aircraft and then took over the flight controls out of sight of the passengers.|$|E
