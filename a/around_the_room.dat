5|$|All of Van Dormael's films contain surreal elements. In {{his first}} two films, these moments were few, like dancing flowers in Toto le héros or Georges flying <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> in Le huitième jour. Mr. Nobody makes much more {{extensive}} use of surreal imagery throughout the film.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternate}} ending {{was present}} in the behind-the-scenes video, showing an exhausted Madonna leaving the party with a male model, as well as aftermath scenes of the party which were released in the first teaser trailer. The parting shot showed Madonna running <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and posing {{in front of the}} windows overlooking New York. Other scenes included Madonna chatting with Ora and Rock in-between takes, sitting in the hallways, plunging towards the neon sock puppets multiple times as well as singing the song with the little girls {{from the beginning of the}} video. Another video set to Kleinenberg's remix featured further footage of Madonna dancing and more casual scenes featuring the guest stars.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the 1883 room has been restored to its original appearance. The red oak floor is trimmed by nine inches of mop board and quarter-round, decoratively accented. The two curved and semi-circular front walls mark the two coat rooms in the original, one-room building. The rounded walls hold a chair rail and are wainscoted below the blackboards. Blackboards cover available space on the north, east, and south walls. Pressed tin extends over the ceiling and {{is used as a}} crown molding <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> on the walls from the ceiling {{to the top of the}} blackboards.|$|E
50|$|The {{video was}} {{directed}} by P. R. Brown and features the band facing {{the walls of a}} small <b>room</b> with <b>the</b> camera orbiting <b>around</b> them. <b>The</b> walls are lifted {{by the end of the}} video revealing a crowd of fans <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room's</b> floor.|$|R

5|$|Tina (McShera) {{arrives at}} a Victorian villa for a séance. Hives (Shearsmith) settles Tina before {{retrieving}} Talbot (Steadman), who arrives shrouded in black and carrying a doll. Talbot, an elderly woman with heavy cataracts, speaks in a high-pitched voice, unnerving Tina. When the séance begins, objects fly <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> Talbot's voice becomes demonic and ectoplasm seeps from her mouth. Hives encourages Tina not to break the circle, but she does so when a blue-faced demon (Starkey) appears behind her. She is terrified until Hives reveals himself to be Terry, {{the host of a}} hidden camera programme called Scaredy Cam.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{for the single}} was directed by Wataru Takeishi. It opens with Hamasaki walking into a small orange-lit room with a black object on a stall. After touching it, the entire room starts to light up, and the singer subsequently walks around singing to the song; scenes are digitally-altered and edited during the process. Following the first chorus, Hamasaki is seen wearing a white outfit while a mysterious light shines <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> The video subsequently ends with the singer sitting on a small chair, looking in the distance. The clip was included on several DVD compilations released by Hamasaki: A Clips (2000), A Complete Box Set (2004), the digital release of A Clips Complete (2014), and the DVD and Blu-Ray re-release edition of her 2001 compilation album, A Best (2016). The visual was additionally used as the theme song for Japanese cosmetics company Aube's launch of their lipstick range, which led to Hamasaki becoming their spokeswoman and appearing in a campaign video.|$|E
5|$|Pickingill {{was also}} known for his purported ability to control animals, namely horses, and it was {{believed}} that when he struck a hedgerow with his stick, game animals would run out that could then be caught, killed and eaten. It was also rumoured that he could do things faster than ordinary human beings, and that he could do an hour's job in only a few minutes, with some believing that he got his imps—his familiar spirits—to do the job for him. Maple also noted that people who visited his cottage reported seeing ornaments and furniture dancing <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> of their own accord; the folklorist believed that this story had originated in a Dutch folkloric tradition that may have been imported to Essex when many Dutch migrants settled there in the seventeenth century.|$|E
50|$|Okhwan Yoon got {{his first}} bike when he was 6 years old and started to cycle <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> of his family home. In his teenage years, after coming back from school, he would ride <b>around</b> <b>the</b> villages near Seoul until it got dark. He {{wondered}} who lived behind the mountains and {{what it looked like}} there.|$|R

60|$|The spring {{had passed}} slowly {{to those of}} the Morris family located at Winchester. Strange to say {{although}} Joseph Morris' wound healed it seemed next to impossible for the pioneer to get back his strength, and the most he could do was to walk <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> of <b>the</b> Gibson home, or <b>around</b> <b>the</b> dooryard, supported by his wife or others.|$|R
5|$|The Fraternity's rituals {{at their}} Bayswater temple {{were carried out}} under a dim light, with Fortune {{claiming}} that bright light disperses etheric forces. An altar {{was placed in the}} centre of a room, with the colours of the altar-cloth and the symbols on the altar varying according to the ceremony being performed. A light was placed on the altar while incense, usually frankincense, was burned. The senior officers sat in a row along the eastern end of the room, while officers—who were believed to be channels for cosmic forces—were positioned at various positions on the floor. The lodge was opened by walking <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> in a circle chanting, with the intent of building a psychic force up as a wall. Next, the cosmic entities would be invoked, with the members believing that these entities would manifest in astral form and interact with the chosen officers.|$|E
5|$|Wesley {{attacks the}} base using {{explosive}} rats (a tactic {{he learned from}} the Exterminator), killing surviving Fraternity assassins,including The Repairman and the Butcher (who he kills in a knife fight) in a massive shootout. Entering Sloan's office, he is surrounded by Fox, Gunsmith and the remaining assassins. Wesley discloses Sloan's deception, to which Sloan reveals that {{the names of those}} present had legitimately come up in the Loom, and that he had acted to protect them. He gives the members a choice: kill themselves, per the code, or kill Wesley and use their skills to control the world. As the others choose the latter, Fox curves a bullet <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> choosing to follow the code and kill everyone, including herself, but not before throwing her gun to Wesley. Sloan escapes in the mayhem.|$|E
5|$|When {{a key to}} {{a room at the}} Marina View Hotel is {{delivered}} inside a jar of blood to the Homicide Department, Sgt. James Doakes (Erik King) and Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter) visit the hotel, where they find a room completely covered in blood. Dexter is sent in first to investigate, but seeing the blood-covered room brings back a repressed memory from his childhood— Dexter at the age of three years sitting in a pool of blood—and he collapses and runs from the room. The forensics team surmises that the blood in the hotel room came from at least five different bodies, although none were in the room. Since there were only one set of footprints in the room, they assume that the victims were killed elsewhere and their blood spread <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> by the killer. Debra suggests that the Ice Truck Killer, who had five bloodless victims, may have been responsible.|$|E

5|$|Angel {{returns to}} his hotel and finds Epiphany on his doorstep. He invites her into his room, where they have {{aggressive}} sexual intercourse, during which Angel has visions of blood dripping from the ceiling and splashing <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> He later confronts Krusemark in a gumbo hut, where the latter reveals that he and Margaret {{were the ones who}} helped Favorite leave the hospital. He also explains that Favorite was actually a powerful magician who sold his soul to Satan in exchange for stardom, but then sought to renege on the bargain. In 1943, Favorite kidnapped a young soldier and performed a Satanic ritual on the boy, murdering him and eating his still-beating heart in order to assume his identity and hide from the Devil. Favorite was supposed to drop out and resurface as the soldier he murdered, but was unexpectedly drafted into the war, injured, then sent home with amnesia. Hoping to jar his memory, the Krusemarks took Favorite from the hospital and released him into Times Square, never to be seen again. Angel has a panic attack and runs into the bathroom. He returns to find Krusemark drowned in a cauldron of boiling gumbo.|$|E
5|$|Late in Friday's {{first season}} in Wales, Cardiff took on Luton Town on 16 April 1977. Cardiff {{were in the}} relegation zone and had not won in seven games, while Luton were fifth in the table and {{challenging}} for promotion. After clashing repeatedly early in the match with Luton goalkeeper Milija Aleksic, Friday was lectured by the referee for a high tackle on the goalkeeper in the 36th minute. Friday held {{out a hand to}} apologise, but Aleksic reacted angrily. When the free kick was taken, Friday ran back, stole the ball from Luton defender John Faulkner, broke away, rounded Aleksic and slotted the ball past him into the net. In celebration, Friday jogged back past the goalkeeper while giving him the V-sign. Cardiff won the match 4–2 {{and at the end of}} the season avoided relegation to the third tier only on goal difference. Meanwhile, without Friday, Reading were relegated back to the Fourth Division by one point. Friday's actions became even stranger during his time at Cardiff; after they lost the second leg of the Welsh Cup final 3–0 to Shrewsbury Town on 18 May 1977, the players and staff were awoken in the middle of the night by loud bangs coming from below their rooms. The cause was found to be Friday, standing on the hotel's snooker table in his underpants and throwing the balls <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> in fury.|$|E
5|$|On Friday 9 November, prostitute Mary Jane Kelly {{was murdered}} in the single room where she lived at 13 Miller's Court, behind 26 Dorset Street, Spitalfields. One of the earlier victims, Chapman, had lived in Dorset Street, and another, Eddowes, was {{reported}} to have slept rough there. Kelly's severely mutilated body was discovered shortly after 10:45am lying on the bed. The first doctor at the scene, Dr George Bagster Phillips, believed that Kelly was killed by a slash to the throat. After her death, her abdominal cavity was sliced open and all her viscera removed and spread <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Her breasts had been cut off, her face mutilated beyond recognition, and her thighs partially cut through to the bone, with some of the muscles removed. Unlike the other victims, she was undressed and wore only a light chemise. Her clothes were folded neatly on a chair, with the exception of some found burnt in the grate. Abberline thought the clothes had been burned by the murderer to provide light, as the room was otherwise only dimly lit by a single candle. Kelly's murder was the most savage, probably because the murderer had more time to commit his atrocities in a private room rather than in the street. Her state of undress and folded clothes have led to suggestions that she undressed herself before lying down on the bed, which would indicate that she was killed by someone she knew, by someone she believed to be a client, or when she was asleep or intoxicated.|$|E

25|$|On one occasion, {{during a}} papal audience, Pius X {{was holding a}} paralyzed child who wriggled free from his arms and then ran <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> On another occasion, a couple (who had made {{confession}} to {{him while he was}} bishop of Mantua) with a two-year-old child with meningitis wrote to the pope and Pius X then wrote back to them to hope and pray. Two days later, the child was cured.|$|E
25|$|Students are {{not allowed}} to {{critique}} others, talk during the arrangement process, or stand and walk <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Participants must follow the sensei after each arrangement inspection.

The sensei will end class when everyone has been critiqued. At this time, students will report back to their seats and assist with cleaning the space.|$|E
50|$|Brandon, {{unaware of}} the rumors about a teacher, bumps into Elizabeth Jacobs, a girl from St. Lucius. It quickly becomes {{apparent}} that the rumors about a teacher are actually about Elizabeth who has followed Jeremiah from St. Lucius. Brandon and Elizabeth quickly bond as they go <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> and coax <b>the</b> residents to continue partying {{as there is no}} threat of a teacher.|$|R
50|$|On December 31 and on New Year's Day, {{groups of}} {{children}} carrying small cardboard boats adorned with ribbons and small flags go around visiting houses, stores and coffee shops, singing songs with good wishes and receiving coins and wheat cakes, while the elderly exchange visits. On the morning of Agios Basilios day, coming back from Liturgy, the men customarily throw a pomegranate hard against the walls of their homes, wishing for abundance and happiness for their family. The more seeds that are spread <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms,</b> <b>the</b> more luck the family will have in the coming year.|$|R
50|$|Rather {{than being}} a board game, Clue played out more like a simple point-and-click game where <b>the</b> player {{traveled}} <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> from <b>the</b> mansion to collect clues from the 6 suspects to decipher whodunnit. Each case was time limited, and every action taken used up a set amount of time. Successfully making a correct suggestion within the allotted time gave the player the maximum 4-star score for the level.|$|R
25|$|As night {{approached}} the hijackers {{took all the}} hostages up several decks to the Arazzi Lounge on the Promenade deck and gave them blankets to spend the night. While they ordered the ship's kitchen to send food up for the hostages, they placed containers they claimed were filled with gasoline <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> (apparently as a bluff {{to ward off the}} ship's crew). Despite fears of grenades and gasoline, the passengers attempted to sleep on the floor while the ship steamed towards Syria.|$|E
25|$|The ship got {{underway}} at 9:30am. As it {{was passing}} East 90th Street, a fire {{started in the}} Lamp Room in the forward section, possibly caused by a discarded cigarette or match. It was fueled by the straw, oily rags, and lamp oil strewn <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> The first notice of a fire was at 10:00am; eyewitnesses claimed the initial blaze began in various locations, including a paint locker filled with flammable liquids and a cabin filled with gasoline. Captain Van Schaick was not notified until 10 minutes after the fire was discovered. A 12-year-old boy had tried to warn him earlier, but was not believed.|$|E
25|$|The meeting's Timer reports {{how much}} time each speaker, table topics responder, and {{evaluator}} took to give his or her presentation. Then the General Evaluator, or Master Evaluator, gives his or her overall evaluation of the meeting and makes recommendations of ways to improve future meetings. Some clubs have Table Topics Evaluators who evaluate members' responses to the table topics; for those that do not, the General Evaluator frequently fills that role. In addition, some advanced clubs have a 'round robin' evaluation for the speakers. In addition to the designated evaluator giving an evaluation recorded in the members' manual, the other members <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> are asked for additional comments on the presentation.|$|E
