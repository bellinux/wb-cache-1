5|$|Manning's father spent {{weeks in}} late 2007 <b>asking</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> {{consider}} joining the Army. Hoping {{to gain a}} college education through the G.I.

Cavaradossi denies knowing {{anything}} about Angelotti's escape.|$|E

5000|$|When Tony {{is sent to}} the Naval Academy {{hospital}} to recuperate, he resumes courting Peggy and <b>asks</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> marry him. Peggy turns him down and is torn between the two brothers because Jim had already <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> marry, and she had put him off until after the Korean War is over.|$|R

5|$|Beyoncé {{has worked}} with Pepsi since 2002, and in 2004 {{appeared}} in a Gladiator-themed commercial with Britney Spears, Pink, and Enrique Iglesias. In 2012, Beyoncé signed a $50million deal to endorse Pepsi. The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPINET) wrote Beyoncé an open letter <b>asking</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> reconsider the deal because of the unhealthiness of the product and to donate the proceeds to a medical organisation. Nevertheless, NetBase found that Beyoncé's campaign was the most talked about endorsement in April 2013, with a 70 per cent positive audience response to the commercial and print ads.|$|E

5|$|From {{a purely}} {{literary}} and historical point of view, Either/Or {{can be seen}} as a thinly veiled autobiography of the events between Kierkegaard and his ex-fianceé Regine Olsen. Johannes the Seducer in The Diary of a Seducer treats the object of his affection, Cordelia, much as Kierkegaard treats Regine: befriending her family, <b>asking</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> marry him, and breaking off the engagement. Either/Or, then, could be the poetic and literary expression of Kierkegaard's decision between a life of sensual pleasure, as he had experienced in his youth, or a possibility of marriage and what social responsibilities marriage might or ought to entail. Ultimately however, Either/Or stands philosophically independent of its relation to Kierkegaard's life.|$|E
5|$|On 13 July 1999, Kouao took Climbié to Cameron's house, <b>asking</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> take Climbié {{permanently}} because Manning did {{not want}} her. Cameron refused but agreed to take her for the night. Cameron, her son Patrick, and her daughter Avril, observed that Climbié had numerous injuries—including a burn {{on her face and}} a loose piece of skin hanging from her right eyelid—which Kouao said was self-inflicted. Manning's account in the subsequent inquiry differed {{and he said that he}} hit Climbié because of her incontinence, beginning with slaps, but progressing to using his fist by the end of July. It was highly likely that at least some of the injuries were the result of deliberate physical harm.|$|E
5|$|On 6 December 2011, a prequel to {{the episode}} was {{released}} online.

While holding the button, he has phoned the TARDIS to speak to Amy Pond <b>asking</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> rescue him, although {{he does not have}} his co-ordinates, Amy cannot fly the TARDIS, and she is not on the TARDIS. The Doctor wishes Amy a Merry Christmas before letting go of the button, and the spaceship explodes.|$|E

Maisie disapproves of lying, but agrees.|$|R
50|$|Since {{her youth}} she had tended to a {{colorful}} mode of dress and avoiding fashions of the day. When `Abdu'l-Bahá <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> {{travel in the}} East for him he <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> dress in a less conspicuous fashion. She then designed a form of dress with a royal dark blue of inset panels of different fabric with silk trimmings.|$|R
5|$|Within {{weeks of}} his arrival at prison, Berkman began {{planning}} his suicide. He tried to sharpen a spoon into a blade, but his attempt {{was discovered by}} a guard and Berkman {{spent the night in}} the dungeon. He thought about beating his head against the bars of his cell, but worried that his efforts might injure him but leave him alive. Berkman wrote a letter to Goldman, <b>asking</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> secure a dynamite capsule for him. A letter was smuggled out of the prison and arrangements were made for her to visit Berkman in November 1892, posing as his sister. Berkman knew {{as soon as he saw}} Goldman that she had not brought the dynamite capsule.|$|E

Due to her overactive imagination, Catherine starts to believe that General Tilney murdered his wife. Henry catches her in his mother's chamber and becomes offended when he realises what she has been thinking.

Mulder acts as a hostage negotiator, calling Barry in order to earn his trust so that the standoff may be peacefully resolved. Barry quickly figures this out, causing Mulder to learn that he is a former FBI agent. A power outage occurs, frightening Barry and causing him to fire his gun, hitting one of the hostages.

Owen {{supports}} her decision as he realizes no good could come from him <b>asking</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> stay, but requests her not to leave him until she has to leave him for good, following which, they both spend two weeks leading to her permanent departure together. While saying her farewell to her colleagues of the last seven years, there is a possible act of terrorism in Seattle, which later turns out to be just a gas main explosion.

5|$|On {{the evening}} of 7November 1974, the children's nanny, Sandra Rivett, was bludgeoned {{to death in the}} {{basement}} of the Lucan family home. Lady Lucan was also attacked; she later identified Lucan as her assailant. As the police began their murder investigation, Lucan telephoned his mother, <b>asking</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> collect the children, and then drove a borrowed Ford Corsair to a friend's house in Uckfield, East Sussex. Hours later, he left the property and vanished without trace. The car was found abandoned in Newhaven, its interior stained with blood and its boot containing a piece of bandaged lead pipe similar to one found at the crime scene. A warrant for Lucan's arrest was issued a few days later, and in his absence the inquest into Rivett's death named him as her murderer, the last occasion in Britain a coroner's court did so.|$|E
5|$|She often {{bears the}} brunt of Victor's temper due to muddled misunderstandings and {{in part due to}} her aloof nature. One such {{occasion}} saw Victor <b>asking</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> pick up a suit of his from the dry-cleaners, only for her to return with a gorilla costume. Another occasion saw her persuading Victor to take on a dog whose owner had just died. Victor spent time building a kennel in the garden and when Mrs Warboys arrives with the dog, she forgets to mention that the dog is stuffed - much to Victor and Margaret's consternation. On another occasion she won a competition where the prize was either to earn £500 or to have a life-size waxwork model made of herself, which had to be delivered to the Meldrews' house; she chose the waxwork. As it turned out, she hated it as much as Victor and Margaret did, and the waxwork ended up in the dustbin.|$|E

Dwight then confronts Randall in the alley; Dwight tells him that he doesn't mind what he does, as long as he asks first.

Doggett notes that {{it would be difficult to}} miss a target in a confined space, but Scully notes it would have if the gunman was shooting from outside. Eventually, Scully proposes that the killer can perceive wave lengths of light not visible with an ordinary human eye, allowing him to virtually see through walls.|$|E
