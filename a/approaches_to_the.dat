As the tide receded, engineers were also able to resume their work of clearing the beach obstacles, {{and by the end}} of the evening, 13 gaps were opened and marked.|$|E
5|$|As {{retribution}} for the Italian actions at Beirut, {{four days}} after the battle the central Ottoman government ordered the Wilyets of Beirut, Aleppo, and Damascus to expel all Italian citizens from their jurisdictions, resulting in the deportation of over 60,000 Italians from the region. Despite the retaliatory expulsion of Italian citizens from the area, the battle gave the Italian forces complete naval superiority in the <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Suez Canal and Italian forces in Eritrea could now be reinforced without hesitation, eliminating much of the Ottoman threat to the region. Thus the battle was both a strategic and tactical Italian victory.|$|E

In Laos, the Air Force applied conventional air power in the support of an unconventional ground war. The mission of the U.S. Air Force was to seal off the southern Mekong River Valley, thus providing a buffer for Thailand; insulating the Vientiane government from direct communist threat; draining PAVN manpower and resources; and interdiction of the <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ho Chi Minh trail.|$|E

5|$|The crew took {{advantage}} of both natural and practical light at filming locations. The director sought various <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lighting setups, for example choosing several urban locations for the city lights' effects on the shots' backgrounds. He and the crew also embraced fluorescent lighting at other practical locations to maintain an element of reality and to light the prostheses depicting the characters' injuries. On the other hand, Fincher also ensured that scenes were not so strongly lit so the characters' eyes were less visible, citing cinematographer Gordon Willis' technique as the influence.|$|E

While moored in the town of Salale, the ship was heavily camouflaged and defensive arrangements were erected. These included positioning soldiers and field guns to defend the <b>approaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cruiser and establishing a network of coast watchers and telegraph lines to watch for hostile ships. An improvised minefield was also laid in the delta to keep the British ships from entering the river.|$|E
