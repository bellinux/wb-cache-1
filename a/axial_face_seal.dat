40|$|Improvements upon current {{gas turbine}} sealing {{technology}} performance {{are essential for}} decreasing specific fuel consumption to meet stringent future efficiency targets. The clearances between rotating and static components of a gas turbine, which need to be sealed, vary over a flight cycle. Hence, a seal which can passively maintain an optimum clearance, whilst preventing contact between itself and the rotor, is extremely desirable. Various configurations of a Rolls Royce (RR) seal concept, the Large <b>Axial</b> Movement <b>Face</b> <b>Seal</b> (LAMFS), use static pressure forces to locate <b>face</b> <b>seals.</b> Prototypes were tested experimentally at the Osney Thermofluids Laboratory, Oxford. Firstly a proof-of concept rig (simulating a 2 -D seal cross-section) manufactured by RR was re-commissioned. The simplest configuration using parallel <b>seal</b> <b>faces</b> induced an unstable seal housing behaviour. The author used this result, CFD, and analytical methods to improve the design and provide a self-centring ability. A fully annular test rig of this new seal concept was then manufactured to simulate a 3 D engine representative seal. The full annulus eliminated leakage paths unavoidable in the simpler rig. A parametric program of experiments was designed to identify geometries and conditions which favoured best-practice design. The new seal design {{is in the process}} of being patented by Rolls Royce. A 'fluidic' seal was also investigated, showing very promising results. A test rig was manufactured so that a row of jets could be directed across a leakage cross-flow. An experimental program identified parameters which could achieve a combined lower leakage mass flow rate compared with the original leakage. Influence of jet spanwise spacing, injection angle, jet to mainstream pressure ratio, mainstream pressure difference and channel height were analysed. It is hoped this thesis can be used as a tool to further improve these seal concepts from the parametric trends which were identified experimentally.

40|$|The film {{stiffness}} of a <b>face</b> <b>seal</b> is improved without increasing the sealing and dam area {{by using an}} apparatus which includes a primary seal ring {{in the form of}} a nose piece. A spring forces a sealing surface on the seal ring into sealing contact with a seat to form a <b>face</b> <b>seal.</b> A circumferential clearance seal is formed in series with this <b>face</b> <b>seal</b> by a lip on the piece. The width of the surface of the lip is substantially the same as the width of the sealing surface on the <b>face</b> <b>seal</b> and the clearance between the surface on the lip and the shaft is substantially the same as the spacing between the <b>face</b> <b>sealing</b> surfaces on the <b>face</b> <b>seal</b> when the shaft is rotating.

40|$|A {{new type}} of {{hydrostatic}} and hydrodynamic non-contacting <b>face</b> <b>seals</b> {{has been designed to}} meet the requirements of lower leakage, longer life and more repeatedly start and stop on shaft seals raised by liquid rocket engine turbopumps. And an experimental study on the performance of the <b>face</b> <b>seal</b> in the actual liquid oxygen turbopump was completed where low-viscosity water was selected as the seal fluid for the sake of safety. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Different performances of <b>face</b> <b>seals</b> under preset conditions were obtained by repeatedly running tests, and the main performance parameters encompass leakage, fluid film pressure between the faces, operating power, face temperature, and so on. The results indicate that the designed <b>face</b> <b>seal</b> has a smaller amount of leakage, with a minimum value of 3 ?ml/s. Furthermore, the designed <b>face</b> <b>seal</b> has been proved to demand lower operating power. Since its operating power changes slightly with different sealed fluid pressures, the new seal can be deployed in the harsh working condition with high pressure or with high speed (greater than 20, 000 ?rpm). However, one proviso is that when liquid is employed as the seal fluid, the groove depth should be relatively deeper (greater than 10 ?µm).

30|$|Face {{contact can}} affect sealing performance, such as dynamic behavior, thermo{{dynamics}}, friction, wear. The dynamics of <b>face</b> <b>seals</b> {{has been an}} active area since the works by Etsion [23 – 25]. In the aspect of gas <b>face</b> <b>seals,</b> direct numerical method [26 – 30] is detailed but computationally intensive, whilst semi-analytical method including perturbation method [31 – 34] and step jump method [35], on the other hand, is a more practical and efficient alternative but intensively depends on small displacement precondition. Before the introduction of asperity contact, stability and tracking {{have been used to}} illustrate the potential menace of face contact. Variables such as minimum film thickness, axial relative displacement and angular transmissibility are regarded as the indirect evaluation indexes of face contact. With the development of simulation, asperity contact models have been involved to directly gauge their influence on sealing dynamic performance. Harp and Salant [36] developed an axial dynamic model including the Abbott-Firestone plastic asperity contact model. Green [37] researched the transient performance of coned gas <b>face</b> <b>seals</b> during the startup operation by using the CEB model. Ruan [38] also used the CEB model to investigate the transient performance of spiral groove gas <b>face</b> <b>seals</b> during the startup and shutdown operations.|$|R
30|$|Fractal theory {{provides}} scale-independent asperity contact {{loads and}} assumes variable curvature radii in the contact analyses of rough surfaces, {{the current research}} for which mainly focuses on the mechanism study. The present study introduces the fractal theory into the dynamic research of gas <b>face</b> <b>seals</b> under face-contacting conditions. Structure-Function method is adopted to handle the surface profiles of typical carbon-graphite rings, proving the fractal contact model {{can be used in}} the field of gas <b>face</b> <b>seals.</b> Using a numerical model established for the dynamic analyses of a spiral groove gas <b>face</b> <b>seal</b> with a flexibly mounted stator, a comparison of dynamic performance between the Majumdar-Bhushan (MB) fractal model and the Chang-Etsion-Bogy (CEB) statistical model is performed. The result shows that the two approaches induce differences in terms of the occurrence and the level of face contact. Although the approach distinctions in film thickness and leakage rate can be tiny, the distinctions in contact mechanism and end face damage are obvious. An investigation of fractal parameters D and G shows that a proper D (nearly 1.5) and a small G are helpful in raising the proportion of elastic deformation to weaken the adhesive wear in the sealing dynamic performance. The proposed research provides a fractal approach to design gas <b>face</b> <b>seals.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{optimization}} of the geometrical {{parameters of}} the aerodynamic lift features and {{the analysis of the}} fluid flow in the seal interface are inter-twined. Any small changes in the geometrical {{parameters of the}} aerodynamic lift features significantly affect the performance of a non-contacting gas <b>face</b> <b>seal.</b> For a gas <b>face</b> <b>seal</b> to function with optimum performance requires that the optimum geometrical parameters be identified. This can be achieved through a lengthy trial and error process, often heavily dependent on the designer’s depth of insight, itself dependent on experience, or can be achieved through automated numerical methods. The purpose of this research was to develop a reliable numerical model that can serve as a design tool for simulating the performance of both unidirectional and bidirectional dry gas <b>face</b> <b>seals.</b> This was achieved in three steps. The first approach consisted in developing a 2 D numerical model that employed the Reynolds equation for seals operating at very low rotating speeds and low pressure differentials. In the second step a 3 D-CFD model was assembled and the practicability of using CFD, in a seal design loop, for seals operating in wide range of operating conditions, was investigated. This model employed a commercial CFD package (ANSYS CFX version 11). For last approach both models were incorporated into an automatic optimization tool that can generate optimal seal geometries with a minimum of human intervention. An extensive set of results from the analysis of dry gas <b>face</b> <b>seals</b> spanning across different operating conditions and geometrical <b>seal</b> <b>face</b> profiles, with the inclusion of convergent radial taper, are presented and discussed in this thesis. The results obtained from the Reynolds equation and 3 D CFD models are compared and critically analysed. Results obtained with both models are validated against test data obtained from AESSEAL plc, the sponsor of this research. The 3 D CFD model predictions showed a better agreement with the test data on the seal leakage than the Reynolds equation model. The leakage rates and fluid film thickness predictions illustrate how the 3 D CFD model can be used for seal design while overcoming some of the shortcomings of the Reynolds equation based models. The major limitation of the 3 D CFD model is that it is computationally expensive. An automatic optimization tool which can be used for the design of dry gas <b>face</b> <b>seals</b> has been presented. The improvements achieved from the optimization of a spiral groove <b>face</b> <b>seal</b> utilising the automatic optimization tool are: 4. 8 % increase of opening force, 13. 2 % reduction of seal leakage, 20. 7 % increase of design efficiency parameter, 28. 3 % increase of axial film stiffness and 15. 9 % reduction of power consumption.

40|$|Mechanical <b>face</b> <b>seals</b> are {{designed}} {{to benefit from the}} relative Downloaded Frotation between the faces allowed by the flexibility in the stator mounting. Relative rotation between the faces results in self-actuating hydrodynamic pressure, which creates a stiff barrier be-tween the <b>seal</b> <b>faces</b> that actively deters face contact. Furthermore, the gas film dissipates energy by internal friction and viscous shearing, which helps to reduce vibrations that result from exter-nal disturbances.

An example of an improperly designed seal is one where the gas film stiffness and damping contribute to a natural resonance close to an operat-ing frequency.
