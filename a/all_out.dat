5|$|The {{match at}} Prince's began on Thursday, 6 June and was played over three days, {{ending in a}} draw after being {{impacted}} by the weather. The North won the toss and batted first, scoring 156 <b>all</b> <b>out</b> and 196–5. In their only innings, the South scored 197 <b>all</b> <b>out.</b> Grace opened the bowling for the South and took 4–73 and 2–59. Once more he failed with the bat and was caught and bowled for 4, again losing his wicket to the irrepressible Tom Emmett. The match raised about £100 for the Cricketers' Fund Friendly Society.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{arrived in}} England for the 51st Ashes series in 1981. Willis, who was {{selected}} to play in all six Test matches, came into the series on a run of good county form. He had played four county matches, commencing with 5/61 against Yorkshire on 6 May, and 3/58 against Lancashire on 10 June. The first Test took place at Trent Bridge, Nottingham, on 18 June. England, batting first, were cut down for 185 <b>all</b> <b>out</b> thanks to four wickets for Terry Alderman and three a-piece for Dennis Lillee and Rodney Hogg. Only Mike Gatting passed fifty, and Willis was dismissed for a first-ball duck. Willis, however, combined with Dilley, Hendrick and Botham to reduce Australia to 179 <b>all</b> <b>out,</b> with three wickets for Willis. England could not take advantage, however, as Lillee and Alderman shared the host nation's ten wickets equally between them to leave Australia only 132 to win. Dilley took four wickets and Willis snatched Graeme Wood for eight to reach 200 Test wickets, however the tourists won the match with four wickets to spare.|$|E
5|$|Australia then {{proceeded}} to victory by an innings and 451 runs, their biggest winning margin for the tour. Loxton was not required to bowl in the first innings as the hosts fell for 83 in 36.5 overs. In the second innings, Loxton was given the new ball and bowled 12 overs without success, conceding 28 runs before Essex were <b>all</b> <b>out</b> for 187.|$|E

5|$|Early Seventies Britain {{was a very}} {{depressing}} {{place with}} both the colour strike and the UK postal workers strike in full swing.

5|$|England won the toss and {{declined}} from 125/0 to 245 <b>all</b> <b>out,</b> {{the last five}} wickets tumbling for just 22 runs. Malcolm Marshall and Curtly Ambrose took all ten wickets between them. The West Indies racked up 448/9 despite no batsman reaching a century. England {{had a chance to}} get back into the match, but from 334/7, the unheralded batting of Marshall (72) and Ambrose (43*) took the tourists into a position of dominance.|$|E
5|$|He took match {{figures of}} 5/48 in the Second Test in a drawn match.

5|$|In the meantime, {{the second}} innings in Adelaide saw England set Australia a near-impossible 532 for victory; even today, the highest {{successful}} Test run chase is 418. Australia lost its first wicket at three when Jack Fingleton was bowled by Larwood. Woodfull {{was joined by}} Bradman, who played in an unorthodox counterattacking method, before being dismissed for 66. Woodfull continued on to score an unbeaten 73, carrying his bat as his teammates capitulated around him. Australia was eventually <b>all</b> <b>out</b> for 193, with Oldfield unable to bat due to his fractured skull.|$|E

5|$|On a small {{ground at}} Belmont, the September grass was coarse. It had been rolled {{so that the}} ball moved very quickly across the ground. The Australian side, fielding first, dropped many catches and could not cope with the short boundary, {{allowing}} the Philadelphians to reach a huge total of 525 runs. King came in to bat last, at number 11, making 36 runs. The leading Australian bowlers, Hugh Trumble and George Giffen, took 2 for 104 and 0 for 114 respectively. When the Australians came to bat, they hoped that they would, by now, have recovered from their tiring journey, but ran into problems when dealing with Bart King's developing swing bowling. The side was <b>all</b> <b>out</b> for 199, with King taking 5 wickets for 78 runs. The Australians followed on and were <b>all</b> <b>out</b> again for 268, allowing the Gentlemen of Philadelphia to win by an innings and 68 runs.|$|E
5|$|She made 52 runs at 13.00 {{in seven}} T20 matches. Her best score was an unbeaten 20 from 13 balls in an eight-wicket win over Tasmania. In the final, Victoria batted first and made 5/127, Healy {{completing}} a catch and stumping. In reply, Healy made a duck as New South Wales lost four wickets {{in the first}} 13 balls and were <b>all</b> <b>out</b> for 75 to lose by 22 runs.|$|E
5|$|Tallon {{returned}} for the Fifth Test at The Oval, where England elected to bat first on a rain-affected pitch. Tallon caught Jack Crapp from an outside edge for a duck from the bowling of Miller, leaving England at 4/23 as play was adjourned for lunch. England continued to {{struggle against the}} moving ball and were <b>all</b> <b>out</b> for 52 in the middle session. The innings ended when Tallon took an acrobatic catch to dismiss Len Hutton down the leg side, catching it with his left hand. It was considered the catch of the season by Wisden. Tallon conceded six byes in the innings.|$|E

The scored 139 runs at a loss of seven wickets, and Faiz Fazal top scored with 47 runs. Batting second, the Middlesex Second XI got <b>all</b> <b>out</b> at 111 runs in the last over. Munaf Patel took three wickets, and the Royals won by 28 runs.|$|E
5|$|The Swedes {{were not}} {{popular in the}} regions that Sweden had gained at the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658. With the new war going badly, insurgents saw their chance to rise up against the unpopular rule. Swedish response, {{especially}} in Scania, was more subtle than one might believe. An <b>all</b> <b>out</b> terror campaign would have been economically disastrous. Instead small patrols searching the woods were often employed combined with promises of carrots or sticks to the local farmers.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} against Yorkshire, for whom Hutton played; it gave both Miller and Hutton an {{opportunity}} to gain a psychological advantage before the Tests. In cold and blustery conditions, Miller reduced his pace and bowled medium-paced off breaks, operating {{throughout most of the}} innings and taking 6/42 in 23.3 overs. He removed Hutton for five after the Yorkshireman had struggled for an hour in the middle. Yorkshire were <b>all</b> <b>out</b> for 71 on a wet wicket. In reply, Australia scored just 101; Miller scored a counter-attacking 34, the highest individual score in the match. He hit two sixes in his innings, including one from the first ball that he faced. He then took 3/49 in the second innings as Yorkshire were <b>all</b> <b>out</b> for 89 to leave Australia a victory target of 60. He was dismissed for two, caught at long off after attempting to hit a six from the spin of Johnny Wardle to leave Australia 3/13. The remaining batsmen struggled and Australia lost six wickets before scoring the winning runs; this was the closest the team came to defeat on the whole tour, and Miller's performance in the match was instrumental in preserving the unbeaten record.|$|E
