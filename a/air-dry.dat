5|$|Taiko {{construction}} has several stages, including making and shaping of the drum body (or shell), preparing the drum skin, and tuning {{the skin to}} the drumhead. Variations in the construction process often occur in the latter two parts of this process. Historically, byō-uchi-daiko were crafted from trunks of the Japanese zelkova tree that were dried out over years, using techniques to prevent splitting. A master carpenter then carved out the rough shape of the drum body with a chisel; {{the texture of the}} wood after carving softened the tone of the drum. In contemporary times, taiko are carved out on a large lathe using wood staves or logs that can be shaped to fit drum bodies of various sizes. Drumheads can be left to <b>air-dry</b> over a period of years, but some companies use large, smoke-filled warehouses to hasten the drying process. After drying is complete, the inside of the drum is worked with a deep-grooved chisel and sanded. Lastly, handles are placed onto the drum. These are used to carry smaller drums and they serve an ornamental purpose for larger drums.|$|E

500|$|The baleen of baleen {{whales are}} keratinous plates. They {{are made of}} a calcified hard α-keratin material, a fiber-reinforced {{structure}} made of intermediate filaments (proteins). The degree of calcification varies between species, with the sei whale having 14.5% hydroxyapatite, a mineral that coats teeth and bones, whereas minke whales have 1–4% hydroxyapatite. In most mammals, keratin structures, such as wool, <b>air-dry,</b> but aquatic whales rely on calcium salts to form on the plates to stiffen them. Baleen plates {{are attached to the}} upper jaw and are absent in the mid-jaw, forming two separate combs of baleen. The plates decrease in size as they go further back into the jaw; the largest ones are called the [...] "main baleen plates" [...] and the smallest ones are called the [...] "accessory plates". Accessory plates taper off into small hairs.|$|E

500|$|During the sailors' revolt, Dresden {{was ordered}} to steam to Eckernförde {{to serve as a}} relay to Kiel. Communications had been {{disrupted}} by major unrest there. The battleship [...] laid in Dresdens path, and her unruly crew refused to move out of Dresdens way; Markgraf aimed one of her [...] gun turrets at Dresden, but then her crew backed down and let Dresden leave the port. The ship then went to Swinemünde, where her crew partially scuttled her following reports that mutinous ships were en route to attack the cruisers stationed there. After these proved false, Dresden was re-floated and returned to seaworthy condition. This involved removing the ammunition for all of the guns and allowing them to <b>air-dry.</b> Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918, most of the High Seas Fleet's ships, under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, were interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow. Dresden was among the ships interned, but owing to her poor condition following the naval mutiny, she was not able to steam {{with the rest of the}} fleet in November. She arrived on 6 December, leaking badly.|$|E
2500|$|In {{this decade}} Seattle Box began modernizing, {{replacing}} two horse-drawn delivery carts with its first truck, a chain-driven Pierce Arrow. By {{the end of}} the decade, the truck fleet also included a Ford and three Kenworth trucks built in nearby Kirkland, Washington. Since horses were no longer needed for delivery, the old stables under the plant were converted to a dry kiln, which allowed the inventory to include a larger variety of dry lumber stock, and ended the need for a lengthy storage period to <b>air-dry</b> the company's large inventory, [...] of lumber. Other equipment modernization in the twenties included a new Stetson-Ross planer, two Mershon resaw machines, a new lumber carrier, and a new two-color modern design printer for boxes and crates.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were (1) to clarify the relationship between the duration of <b>air-drying</b> of one-step self-etch adhesives (1 -SEAs) and the evaporation degree (ED) of solvents, and (2) to evaluate the effect of ED on the ultimate micro-tensile strength (microTS) of the adhesives. METHODS: The ED of one HEMA-rich 1 -SEA, Clearfil S 3 Bond (Kuraray), and two HEMA-free 1 -SEAs, iBond (Heraeus-Kulzer) and G-Bond (GC), was determined without <b>air-drying</b> and after, respectively, 5 - and 10 -s <b>air-drying</b> using a gravimetric method. Next, the microTS of the adhesives at ED equivalent to 0 -, 5 - and 10 -s <b>air-drying</b> was measured. RESULTS: The ED increased with extension of <b>air-drying</b> time. Among the adhesives tested, iBond showed the largest ED, followed by G-Bond and Clearfil S 3 Bond in this order. A longer <b>air-drying</b> time for 10 -s resulted in a statistically significantly higher microTS for the HEMA-rich Clearfil S 3 Bond. The microTS of the latter was higher than that of the other two HEMA-free adhesives for each <b>air-drying</b> time. SIGNIFICANCE: <b>Air-drying</b> of 1 -SEAs had a significant effect on the degree of solvent evaporation (ED) and also on the mechanical properties (microTS) of the 1 -SEAs upon setting. It is therefore beneficial to remove solvents of the 1 -SEAs as much as possible by thorough, strong <b>air-drying</b> in order to achieve a strong adhesive layer at the interface. status: publishe...|$|R

30|$|The {{emissions}} of {{volatile organic compounds}} from <b>air-dried,</b> conventionally dried, and high-temperaturedried sugi wood were compared by gas chromatographymass spectrometry. Terpenes were clearly the main compound group in the <b>air-dried</b> wood samples, whereas acetic acid was only detected in the high-temperature-dried wood samples, indicating that considerable changes occurred in the volatile compound emission profile during hightemperature processing. The most abundant compounds in the <b>air-dried</b> wood and conventionally dried wood were δ-cadinene, α-muurolene, and β-cadinene (sesquiterpenes) for all specimens, and a-pinene and D-limonene (monoterpenes) for conventionally dried wood and <b>air-dried</b> wood. In contrast, acetic acid was detected only in the hightemperature-dried wood. Sensory evaluation of volatile organic compounds was performed by 18 male university students. Volatile compounds of <b>air-dried</b> wood and conventionally dried wood were assessed as being significantly more soothing than those from high-temperature-dried wood.|$|R
40|$|Mineral-N {{production}} by <b>air-dried</b> biosolids {{was measured in}} an Australian tenosol type soil with two moisture conditions over 70 days, using a controlled laboratory incubation procedure. The biosolids were from both <b>air-drying</b> pans and stockpiles. Inorganic-N components (NH(4) -N, NO(3) -N and NO(2) -N) were present in all biosolids, with higher concentrations in samples from <b>air-drying</b> pans compared with stockpiles of 1 yr age. Nevertheless, significant production of NO(3) -N occurred in moist soil amended with all <b>air-dried</b> biosolids. In contrast, saturated soil amended with <b>air-dried</b> biosolids generally showed {{a net loss of}} inorganic-N compounds during incubation, presumably owing to denitrification. In the saturated soil, only biosolids from <b>air-drying</b> pans provided NO(3) -N production from existing NH(4) -N. The results indicated that biosolids from <b>air-drying</b> pans provided the most robust production of NO(3) -N, compared with aged material from the stockpiles, owing to the reduced N content and increased stability of the organic fraction in stored biosolids. However, the rates of N-mineralization in the tenosol soil were substantially lower than reported for more fertile soil types and most of the organic-N content of the biosolids remained undegraded by day 70. The biosolids thus may substantially remain to provide improved properties of soil, such as structure and water-holding capacity. The results suggest that anaerobically digested biosolids from <b>air-drying</b> pans are potentially highly consistent products that could be effective replacements for inorganic-N fertilizer in agricultural production...|$|R

30|$|To {{clarify the}} optimal amount of <b>air-drying</b> time, this study {{measured}} the time taken to remove residual excess solvent from self-etching primer under observation with a 3 D video microscope. One hundred teeth were restored with direct resin composite restorations (16 upper anterior teeth, three lower anterior teeth, 14 upper premolars, 13 lower premolars, 16 upper molars, and 38 lower molars) under observation with a 3 D video microscope. In all restorations, Clearfil SE Protect {{was used for}} bonding of the resin composite under controlled environmental conditions (intra-oral temperature and humidity) using an intra-oral vacuum device. The duration of <b>air-drying</b> needed to evaporate the residual solvent from the self-etching primer solution was simultaneously measured. The data obtained were statistically evaluated by one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD multiple comparisons (p <  0.05). The duration for complete <b>air-drying</b> of the 100 cases was 40.9  ±  18.7  s.

This study revealed that a greater <b>air-drying</b> duration was needed to evaporate solvent from the self-etching primer than routine <b>air-drying</b> in the clinical situation.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different <b>air-drying</b> periods on microtensile bond strength (MTBS) of a total-etch adhesive to dentin. Materials and Methods: Prime & Bond NT (Dentsply-USA) was used with different <b>air-drying</b> periods (0, 2, 5, 10, 30 sec) for bonding a composite resin to prepared dentin. The specimens were then subjected to a tensile force until fracture and the MTBSs of the samples were recorded. Failure modes of the fractured samples were also determined using stereomicroscope and scanning electron microscopy. Data were analyzed using ANOVA and Bonferroni tests (P = 0. 05). Results: With increasing the <b>air-drying</b> periods, the MTBSs were increased until the 5 second air-blowing; after that, with increasing the <b>air-drying</b> periods, the MTBSs decreased. Both, the most complicated failure and the strongest bond were seen in the 5 sec <b>air-drying</b> group.

30|$|The {{effect of}} {{moisture}} content on the stress {{wave propagation velocity}} was investigated in order to estimate the Young’s modulus of full-scale timbers in an <b>air-drying</b> state using the measurement of stress wave propagation velocity above the fiber saturation point. Using Japanese cedar lumber, the velocity and the density under high-moisture condition and <b>air-drying</b> states were measured respectively; after measuring the modulus of elasticity in an <b>air-drying</b> state, the moisture content of each condition was measured. By performing numerical analysis on these data, {{the relationship between the}} moisture content and the rate of change of velocity of full-scale timbers was derived. This relationship was used to estimate the Young’s modulus of the timber in the <b>air-drying</b> state from the velocity in high-moisture condition. First, the velocity and the Young’s modulus in an <b>air-drying</b> state were estimated accurately from its density, moisture content and velocity under high-moisture condition. In cases where the density could not be measured, using the database of mechanical properties with the Monte Carlo simulation method, the Young’s modulus of the full-scale timber in an <b>air-drying</b> state might be estimated within 20 % accuracy from its moisture content and velocity under high-moisture condition.|$|R

Under anaerobic conditions, the phosphate release was also markedly higher for <b>air-dried</b> sediments than for the 'wet' controls. The accumulation of soluble inorganic phosphorus during <b>air-drying,</b> owing to breakdown of organic material and a drying-induced decrease in phosphate sorption, may be the cause of release on rewetting.
