500|$|The {{main source}} of the game's horror is Alma, a ghostly little girl. Craig Hubbard remarked that [...] "a guy in a mask chasing co-eds with a meat cleaver can be scary, but on some level you're {{thinking}} to yourself you could probably kick his ass if you got the drop on him...but when a spooky little girl takes out an entire Delta Force squad, how <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> deal with that?" [...] While Alma {{has been compared to}} the character Samara from The Ring, Craig Hubbard stated that she [...] "... was born out of a tradition of eerie, faceless female ghosts ..." [...] and not [...] "... as an answer to any specific movie character." [...] Hubbard acknowledged that Alma [...] "... admittedly bears some visual resemblance to the ghosts in Dark Water or Séance", but [...] "... creepy little girls have been freaking [...] out since The Shining." [...] Developers Dave Matthews and Nathan Hendrickson say the name 'Alma' comes from the character Alma Mobley in Peter Straub's novel Ghost Story.|$|E
6000|$|... "Are {{you trying}} to be light and amusing," [...] {{returned}} Brown, severely, [...] "or <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be discussing the matter seriously? What attraction could such a girl have for such a man as Reuben Neil?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “That cock won’t fight,” Mr Vladimir retorted, with {{an amazingly}} genuine English accent. “You’ll get your screw every month, {{and no more}} till {{something}} happens. And if nothing happens very soon you won’t get even that. What’s your ostensible occupation? What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> live by?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be silly, Harold," [...] she retorted. [...] "You have {{kissed me}} so much now that my hair is all down, and my face must be a sight. Lips <b>are</b> what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> kiss with--you don't have to kiss with your hands." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Remember," [...] I said, [...] "that I {{have really}} called {{to make his}} {{acquaintance}} {{as a matter of}} courtesy on behalf of my brother. What excuse do you give me for his absence? Tell me what it <b>is</b> that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> say in such a case?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, Casabianca, I'm afraid I don't see {{how to help}} you. It's {{a matter}} for your own conscience. I don't want to lure you from the burning deck; on the other hand, if you stick on here you'll most {{certainly}} be fired on both sides.... But, tell me. You spoke about locking up something at eleven-thirty. What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> lock up?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "How <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> like {{somebody}} when theyre {{sitting in the}} stands and youre {{on the field and}} theyre chucking oranges at you," [...] remarked Miami player Don Bailey. [...] "The crowd was beyond anything that I had ever seen.|$|E
5000|$|But the English {{countryside}} is {{far from}} deserted, and Father Morpheus drinks a lot of whiskey. He claims there's an alternative, but then he says a lot of strange things. When there's no one left to ask, who exactly <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> trust? ...|$|E

50|$|Why do {{you want}} to stop? How do you feel after masturbating? Are you addicted? What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> do instead?

5000|$|In the mid-1970s, {{the prince}} {{expressed}} an interest in serving as Governor-General of Australia; Commander Michael Parker explained: [...] "The idea behind the appointment was for him to put a foot on the ladder of monarchy, or being the future King and start learning the trade." [...] However, because of a combination of nationalist feeling in Australia and the dismissal of the government by the Governor-General in 1975, nothing came of the proposal. Charles accepted the decision of the Australian ministers, if not without some regret; he reportedly stated: [...] "What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> think when you are prepared to do something to help and you are told you are not wanted?" ...|$|E

5000|$|Like many of Blur's {{previous}} albums, Think Tank is a loose concept album. Albarn {{has stated}} {{that it is an}} album about [...] "love and politics", stating that [...] "Unease forces people to value what they've got. And that, hopefully, will pay dividends and help change the world to a better place. Hopefully. Touch wood." [...] Albarn also stated that the album is about [...] "what <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> do as an artist other than express what is going on around you." [...] Some of the songs are concerned with a sense of paranoia and alienation in British club culture. Damon also cited punk rock music, particularly The Clash, as an inspiration.|$|E
5000|$|Peter {{decides to}} throw a party, to which Marian invites [...] "the office virgins" [...] from her work, Duncan, and Duncan's roommates. Peter {{suggests}} that Marian buy herself a new dress for his party - something less [...] "mousy" [...] than her normal wardrobe. Marian submits to his wishes and buys a daring red dress. Before the party, Ainsley does Marian's makeup, including false eyelashes and a big lipsticked smile. When Duncan arrives, he says, [...] "You didn't tell {{me it was a}} masquerade. Who the hell <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be?" [...] He leaves and Marian follows. They end up going to a sleazy hotel, where they have unsatisfying sex. The next morning, they go out to breakfast and Marian finds that she cannot eat anything.|$|E
5000|$|The song is not {{an attempt}} at some sort of wide-sweeping {{political}} statement, it's just about just seeing things from a personal level - what <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> believe, what is actually right? How can you work out what is the truth, {{and what is the}} right thing to do? And there's so many different opinions, and you're supposed to have an opinion on what your country is doing, and yet it is so hard to even begin to gather all the facts. It's really distressing thing for people of our generation I think, the feeling of not being able to do anything about that. I guess that was something we were all feeling very acutely in the song. And I think the sounds of the song sum that up in a very tangible way.|$|E
60|$|Your ninth chapter <b>is</b> spent, as <b>you</b> <b>suppose,</b> <b>to</b> shew us the nature, {{and evil}} of sin; but {{because you do}} it more like a heathen philosopher, than a {{minister}} of the gospel, I shall not much trouble myself therewith.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} eat them, Otter," [...] said Juanna, {{who was still}} choking with laughter. [...] "If you don't you may get nothing more for days. Evidently <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> have a small appetite." ...|$|R

5000|$|Staff Sergeant Williams {{is new to}} the prison, and his {{ambition}} is matched only by his cruel treatment of the prisoners; he seeks to use their suffering as means for promotion. When Roberts is accused of cowardice, he asks Staff Sergeant Williams, [...] "And what <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be - a brave man in a permanent base job?" [...] The RSM also questions Staff Sergeant Williams motives for getting out of London, as in another scene, he slyly mentions {{the fact that the}} Germans were bombing the UK (including the civilian prison Williams worked at) just as Williams was volunteering for prison duty in Africa. Staff Sergeant Williams openly admits that he is trying to impress the RSM by showing that he has got what it takes to do the job, and attempts to undermine the RSM with a late night drinking contest.|$|E
5000|$|Davis' name pays {{homage to}} activist Angela Davis, and {{considers}} Davis' involvement with the Black Panther Party and activism as a whole {{to be one of}} her biggest inspirations, explaining, [...] "They came into the schools, they had guns, and they took over. They were teaching us all these revolutionary songs and chants and what not. At that time, when Angela Davis was the most wanted woman in America, I was just fixated with that image of her. By the late ’70s I had decided I sort of wanted to sexualize her name and become her, more or less. So I started in the late ’70s calling myself Vaginal Davis. I started to perform- or tried to perform- at these gay clubs in Los Angeles, in Hollywood. The people in these clubs, they would look at me and say, ‘Vaginal Davis? Well who <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be?’ And I said, ‘Well, Angela Davis- it’s a homage to that.’ And they’d say, ‘Well who’s that?’ They didn’t know who Angela Davis was." ...|$|E

5000|$|The girls wake up {{and ready}} {{themselves}} for another lesson in charm. So Hood complains about having Bubbles in her room, and Bubbles does not understand why So Hood feels that way. Farrah says at least they dont have Brittaney Starr in their room, because if they did they wouldnt be able to sleep. So Hood continues to bash Bubbles, saying theyre from Earth and shes from Mars. Bubbles tries {{to tell her that}} she never even talks to her, so it shouldnt be a problem. So Hood yells at her to shut up and to stop talking to her, and Bay Bay Bay runs in from the other room and immediately starts screaming in Bubbless face. Bubbles tries to defend herself, but So Hood, Bay Bay Bay, Ki Ki, Risky, and K.O. form a group and start screaming at Bubbles. Farrah states that [...] "Its ridiculous, theyre up in her face yelling at her. Who the hell would yell at Bubbles? She doesnt even know what youre talking about! Its like you get into it with one of the girls from Real Chance and they all jump in. It doesnt make any sense. How <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be in Charm School dealing with that?" [...] Meanwhile, Ashley and Brittanya are lying on a bed in another room together and ponder why the girls are screaming and are so loud. Ricki said she can already hear another fight, and states she will not tolerate disruptive individuals. Ricki tells the girls over the intercom to put on their uniforms and report to Lecture Hall in half an hour for their first lesson. Marcia begins to drink her favorite alcoholic beverage, tequila, saying that shes nervous for her first lesson. Ki Ki says that Marcia shouldnt even be in Charm School because her problems go a lot deeper than Charm School can reach.|$|E
