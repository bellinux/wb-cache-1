25|$|Several {{military}} installations {{were built in}} New Mexico just after the war began, including airbases, prisoner of war camps and internment camps. Among {{the most prominent of}} the new bases was Kirtland Field, in Albuquerque. Kirtland was originally an advanced flight school for Air Corps pilots, but it was converted into a major base shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor. By 1945, 1,750 B-24 crewmen had trained there, as well B-29 pilots, AT-11 pilots, glider pilots, aviation mechanics, navigators, and others. In May 1942, the army built the Albuquerque Air Depot Training Station just east of Kirtland for specializing in training in <b>aircraft</b> <b>service,</b> repair, and maintenance. It was, however, transformed into an airbase shortly thereafter and used as a convalescence station for wounded soldiers returning from battle. In 1945, the facility was renamed Sandia Army Airfield and eventually merged with Kirtland. Other major bases were located at Clovis, Alamogordo, and Roswell, along with temporary war-time airfields at Hobbs, Deming, Fort Sumner, and the White Sands Proving Ground.|$|E

2500|$|Despite these plans, the City of Cincinnati {{concluded}} in 2012 {{that it could}} not afford to reconfigure the airstrip and keep it operational and decided to focus its resources on Lunken Airport. Meanwhile, Blue Ash expressed little interest in operating the airport itself, pointing out that the FAA had declined to finance the reconfiguration on several occasions and the runway was [...] "at the end of its useful life". Amid declining airport revenues, the City of Cincinnati closed Blue Ash Airport permanently at noon on August 29, 2012, after 91 years of continuous service. Many planes were moved to more modern facilities at Lebanon-Warren County Airport, and Cincinnati West Airport also saw increased demand. That fall, Blue Ash opened phase I of Summit Park on the wooded western side of the airfield and demolished the Co-Op <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Service</b> hangar, which had stood since 1952.|$|E
2500|$|The Northwest Airlines hub in Memphis was {{exclusively}} {{served by}} Airlink partner Express Airlines I, which later operated as Pinnacle Airlines and now Endeavor Air, until 1997, when Mesaba initiated its first jet <b>aircraft</b> <b>service</b> using the Avro RJ85, the first jetliner type to be flown by either Airlink airline. The Avro RJ85 jetliner, {{which was a}} later model version of the British Aerospace BAe 146-200 featuring an improved cabin and more efficient engines, were operated as Northwest Jetlink flights with the aircraft being configured with 16 first class seats and 53 coach seats. This [...] {{marked the first time}} a regional airline had offered first class as well as coach on a regional jet aircraft. [...] Mesaba was split off at this time into Airways Corporation in order to address objections from mainline pilots flying for Northwest concerning Mesaba's [...] operation of a jet fleet. Mesaba also became the first regional airline to have a first class seating option via the Avro RJ85 jets, with this British-built four engine aircraft being approximately twice as large as the 50-passenger regional jets manufactured by Canadair and Embraer. [...] Eventually, as Pinnacle transitioned to an all Canadair CRJ regional jet fleet, Mesaba took over all Northwest Airlink Saab 340 turboprop operations.|$|E
