5000|$|Several cast {{changes were}} made {{throughout}} the program's run. In the first four seasons (1962-1966), {{the owner of the}} ranch was Judge Henry Garth (Lee J. Cobb). His daughter Betsy (Roberta Shore) lived at the ranch with him, and had a sister relationship with the ranch hands. Ranch hand Steve Hill (Gary Clarke) joined in episode storylines. Randy Boone joined the show in the second season as a youthful ranch hand who played guitar and sang duets with Betsy. (In 1965 Decca Records released an LP of songs from the two singing actors.) In the episode [...] "First To Thine Own Self" [...] (February 12, 1964) Boone's character sings [...] "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry", written by Hank Williams in 1949. In the third season, Clu Gulager was added to the show as the restless deputy Emmett Ryker. After executive producer Frank Price was replaced by Norman Macdonnell at the end of season 3, season 4 became a troublesome time. When Roberta Shore left the cast, Macdonnell added a new leading woman—Diane Roter, who played Jennifer, the Judge's niece. When Lee J. Cobb also left the show in 1966, John Dehner was brought in as the new owner, Morgan Starr. His demanding presence and tough demeanor did not fit well with the show, nor did fans like his character. Producer Frank Price was brought back on board for season 5 to straighten out the series. He replaced the characters of Randy, owner Morgan Starr and Jennifer with a few actors who brought back the family atmosphere to the show. John Grainger (played by Charles Bickford) became the new owner. Elizabeth Grainger (played by Sara Lane), was John Grainger's granddaughter. Her brother Stacey (Don Quine) rounded out this new cast. Although Price left again, the series continued smoothly in the pattern that he set. In season 6, Clay Grainger (played by John McIntire, previously portrayed the wagonmaster on Wagon Train) took over ownership after his brother John's apparent departure [...] "on business." [...] (John Grainger's abrupt series exit, due to actor star Charles Bickford's sudden death on November 9, 1967, was never properly explained onscreen in the series.) The sixth season also added Holly Grainger (played by Jeanette Nolan, McIntire's real-life wife) as the wife of Clay. Season 7 saw the entrance of David Sutton, played by David Hartman (later longtime anchor on <b>ABC's</b> <b>Good</b> Morning <b>America</b> <b>morning</b> news/features program). However, Sutton was replaced in season 8 with a younger hand, Jim Horn (played by Tim Matheson).|$|R
5000|$|In 1976, Cernan {{retired from}} the Navy with the rank of captain, and from NASA, and went into private business. He became Executive Vice President of Coral Petroleum Inc before {{starting}} his own company, The Cernan Corporation, in 1981.

50|$|In 2003, {{researchers}} at the Human Media Lab helped shape the paradigm Attentive User Interfaces, demonstrating how groups of computers could use human social cues for considerate notification. Amongst HML's early inventions was the eye contact sensor, first demonstrated to the public on <b>ABC</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Morning</b> <b>America.</b> Attentive User Interfaces developed at the time included an early iPhone prototype that used eye tracking electronic glasses to determine whether users were in a conversation, an attentive television that play/paused contents upon looking away, mobile Smart Pause and Smart Scroll (adopted in Samsung's Galaxy S4) {{as well as a}} technique for calibration-free eye tracking by placing invisible infrared markers in the scene.|$|E
5000|$|The saloon and steakhouse {{was bought}} in 1982 by the DeArmond family, {{and at the}} time was only a bar. A kitchen was added and began serving Mexican food in 1984. The bar's main {{clientele}} is tourists, but due to the 1988 Yellowstone Fires there was a sharp downturn in tourism in 1988. The DeArmond family developed the idea of pig races to draw more customers to the area and started the races in 1992. In 1994 the menu was switched to a classic saloon and steakhouse, to which it remains today. Bobby [...] "Pitts" [...] was featured on <b>ABC</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Morning</b> <b>America</b> a couple of times during this period.|$|E
50|$|The {{critical}} {{moment for the}} Morning News came in February 1992, when a series of rain storms hit the Southland, causing severe flooding in the San Fernando Valley. At that time, the only other news programs on in the morning were the national news shows on <b>ABC</b> (<b>Good</b> <b>Morning</b> <b>America),</b> NBC (Today) and CBS (CBS This Morning), which were all broadcast on a three-hour tape delay in the Pacific Time Zone, with limited live coverage during the local news segments. Filling a need, KTLA set aside its normal programming and provided extensive coverage of the flooding. That brought in large numbers of Southland viewers; once the flood crisis ended, the viewers stayed with the show. And as a result, ratings improved dramatically.|$|E

50|$|In 2000, Vertegaal {{became a}} Professor in Human-Computer Interaction at Queen's University in Canada. There {{he founded the}} Human Media Lab, a {{research}} facility in Human-Computer Interaction, and developed eyeBox, the first eye contact sensor, premiered in 2003 by Diane Sawyer at <b>ABC</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Morning</b> <b>America.</b> He edited a special issue of Communications of the ACM on Attentive User Interfaces, showing how groups of computers could use human social cues for considerate notification. Amongst these was an early iPhone that used eye tracking electronic glasses to determine whether users were in a conversation, an attentive television that play/paused contents upon looking away, mobile Smart Pause and Smart Scroll (adopted in Samsung's Galaxy S4) and calibration-free eye tracking. In 2004, Vertegaal founded alt.chi sessions at the ACM SIGCHI conference for presenting disruptive early research.|$|E

5000|$|From its debut, The Daily Buzz {{employed}} a personality-driven on-air approach, {{one that was}} looser, faster in pace, and sometimes edgy in comparison to tradition-bound network breakfast television shows broadcast by <b>ABC</b> (<b>Good</b> <b>Morning</b> <b>America),</b> CBS (The Early Show), and NBC (Today): Slang terms, pop music, and host commentaries would be interjected in the news summaries. Pop culture segments were liberally employed (see below). The hosts' employed not-as-formal forms of dress and demeanor (dancing in lead-outs to commercial breaks were not uncommon). And above all, the liveliness trumped the serious. The lively tone was intentional, as {{it was meant to}} attract an audience that was younger in age and were more likely to get their news from sources other than traditional local and network TV newscasts. As Andrea Jackson described it to the Orlando Sentinel in 2005, [...] "We always talk about The Daily Buzz as morning radio on television or late-night television in the morning. It's infotainment." ...|$|E

5000|$|After {{two and a}} {{half years}} of preparatory {{research}} to determine the wreck’s location, Capt. Bayerle discovered the wreck of the RMS Republic in 1981. [...] He raised investor capital and purchased the assets from a bankrupt Canadian offshore oil rig support company, Wolf Sub-Ocean Ltd., in addition to the purchase of a 285 ft Diving Support Vessel, the Oil Endeavor (renamed the SOSI Inspector) in the years following the find. Martin also married during those years and he and his wife, Susan, gave birth to two children - a daughter, Tessa, and a son, Grant. [...] During the summer of 1987, Martin went out to perform a major salvage on the Republic to try to recover the gold, an event that generated international media attention. Capt. Bayerle was featured on television programs such as CBS Evening News, ABC Evening News, and <b>ABC</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Morning</b> <b>America.</b> [...] The 74-day salvage was also closely followed in international periodicals, such as Forbes, New York Times, Associated Press, Japan Times, London Times, [...] and the Los Angeles Times among many other major publications.|$|E
