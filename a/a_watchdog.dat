5|$|Until the 1990s, {{the breed}} was almost unknown outside of Russia, and so {{relatively}} few details on associated health issues are known. The Russian Toy was originally bred as a rat fighter and as <b>a</b> <b>watchdog,</b> and can still exhibit the vocalization {{expected from the}} latter. It is a friendly dog and can become very attached to the family unit. Due to its size and similarities to the chihuahua, the two are often compared.|$|E
5|$|Alpine spaniels {{were kept}} by the canons of the monasteries in the Alps in order to search for {{travellers}} during heavy snow storms, including the Great St. Bernard Hospice in the Great St Bernard Pass between Italy and Switzerland. The dogs would be dispatched in pairs to search for fallen travellers, and were trained so that upon finding them {{would return to the}} canons in order to lead rescuers back to the unfortunate individuals. The Alpine breed was also used as <b>a</b> <b>watchdog</b> to guard sheep and cattle of mountainous regions, including the Himalayas.|$|E
5|$|The King Charles is a {{friendly}} breed, {{to the extent}} that it is not typically as suitable as <b>a</b> <b>watchdog</b> as some breeds, though it may still bark to warn its owners of an approaching visitor. It is not a high energy breed, and enjoys the company of family members, being primarily a lapdog. Although able to bond well with children and tolerant of them, it will not accept rough handling. It prefers not to be left alone for long periods. Known as one of the quietest toy breeds, it is suitable for apartment living.|$|E

5|$|Phan was {{transferred}} to the Huế court {{as a member of the}} censorate, <b>a</b> <b>watchdog</b> body that monitored the work of the mandarinate. He earned the ire of many of his colleagues, but the trust of the emperor, by revealing that the vast majority of the court mandarins were making a mockery of a royal edict to engage in regular rifle practice. Tự Đức later dispatched Phan on an inspection trip to northern Vietnam. His report led to the ousting of many officials who were deemed corrupt or incompetent, including the viceroy of the northern region. He rose to become the Ngu Su, or Imperial Censor, a position which allowed him to criticise other high officials and even the emperor for misconduct. Phan openly criticised Tôn Thất Thuyết, the foremost mandarin of the court, believing him to be rash and dishonest. Aside from his work in rooting out corruption, Phan also compiled a historical geography of Vietnam, which was published in 1883.|$|E
5|$|The Giant Schnauzer was {{originally}} bred as a multipurpose farm dog for guarding property and driving animals to market. By {{the turn of}} the 20th century the Giant Schnauzer was being used as <b>a</b> <b>watchdog</b> at factories, breweries, butcheries, and stockyards throughout Bavaria. It was unknown outside Bavaria until it was used as a military dog in World War I and World War II. The first Giant Schnauzers were imported to America in the 1930s, but they remained rare until the 1960s, when the breed became popular. In 1962, there were 23 new Giant Schnauzers registered with the American Kennel Club; in 1974 this number was 386; in 1984 it was over 800 and in 1987 it was around 1000 animals. In 2012, there were 94 new dogs registered, down from 95 in 2011.|$|E

25|$|A third {{possibility}} is that a large dog breed was indigenous to central Europe during the Neolithic Period, when humans grew wild and domestic crops and used domesticated animals. Whether or not a domesticated large breed existed in the Alpine area when the Romans invaded, Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs are almost certainly {{the result of the}} mating of native farm dogs with large Mastiff-type dogs brought to Switzerland by foreign settlers. The early ancestors of the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog were used by farmers, herdsmen and merchants in central Europe. The breed was bred as a draught dog to pull heavy carts, to guard and move dairy cattle, and as <b>a</b> <b>watchdog</b> and family companion.|$|E
25|$|In September 2016, {{a report}} {{revealed}} a state-owned Belfast business has trained forces in Bahrain that use torture to secure death sentences. Northern Ireland Co-operation Overseas Ltd, or NI-CO , {{has worked with}} Bahrain's police, prison guards and ombudsman's office for years. The company trains Bahrain's Interior Ministry Ombudsman, <b>a</b> <b>watchdog</b> which knowingly refused {{for more than two}} years to investigate complaints regarding the torture of Mohamed Ramadan—a father-of-three on death row who was tortured into making a false confession. NI-CO is embedded in Bahrain's internal security apparatus: a victim could be abused by NI-CO trained police, tortured in prison by NI-CO trained guards, and then have their torture allegation investigated and dismissed by the NI-CO trained ombudsman. In 2015-16, the UK Foreign Office awarded NI-CO over £900,000 out of a £2 million aid package to promote purported human rights reform in the Persian Gulf kingdom, which is a close British ally.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the questions raised by {{the large amount of}} funding he took from the health care industry, Baucus declared a moratorium as of July 1, 2009 on taking more special interest money from health care political action committees. Baucus, however, refused to return as part of his moratorium any of the millions of dollars he has received from health care industry interests before July 1, 2009, or to rule out a resumption of taking the same or greater health care industry contributions in the future. His policy on not taking health care industry money reportedly still allowed him to accept money from lobbyists or corporate executives, who, according to The Washington Post, continued to make donations after July 1, 2009. <b>A</b> <b>watchdog</b> group found that in July 2009 Baucus accepted additional money from the health care industry in violation of his own self-defined moratorium terms, reportedly leading Baucus to return those monies.|$|E

500|$|The Presidential Council can {{consist of}} no more than 21 persons at any one time.

The distinction between permanent and non-permanent members was not one of the recommendations of the Constitutional Commission, and the Government did not adopt the Commission's proposal that members should not belong to a political party.

500|$|Several {{episodes of}} the series {{have been subject to}} {{controversy}} as well.

[...] "SpongeBob, You're Fired", a 2013 season 9 episode, gained heavy controversy and sparked a political debate over its portrayal of unemployment; after Fox News and the New York Post commented on the episode, Media Matters for America accused the two organizations of using the episode to [...] "attack the social safety net".

50|$|Two or more timers are {{sometimes}} cascaded to form <b>a</b> multistage <b>watchdog</b> timer, where each timer {{is referred to}} as a timer stage, or simply a stage. For example, the block diagram below shows <b>a</b> three-stage <b>watchdog.</b> In <b>a</b> multistage <b>watchdog,</b> only the first stage is kicked by the processor. Upon first stage timeout, a corrective action is initiated and the next stage in the cascade is started. As each subsequent stage times out, it triggers a corrective action and starts the next stage. Upon final stage timeout, a corrective action is initiated, but no other stage is started because the end of the cascade has been reached. Typically, single-stage watchdog timers are used to simply restart the computer, whereas multistage watchdog timers will sequentially trigger a series of corrective actions, with the final stage triggering a computer restart.|$|R
