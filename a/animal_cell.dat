NF-κB has also been implicated in processes of synaptic plasticity and memory.|$|E
40|$|AbstractPlant {{and animals}} have evolved {{different}} strategies for their development.

In this study we used the same micro-rheometer to compare animal and plant single cell rheology. We found that wall-less plant cells exhibit the same weak power law rheology as <b>animal</b> <b>cells,</b> with comparable values of elastic and loss moduli. Remarkably, microtubules primarily contributed to the rheological behavior of wall-less plant cells whereas rheology of <b>animal</b> <b>cells</b> was mainly dependent on the actin network.

25|$|Cholesterol, {{from the}} Ancient Greek chole- (bile) and stereos (solid) {{followed}} by the chemical suffix -ol for an alcohol, is an organic molecule. It is a sterol (or modified steroid), a type of lipid molecule, and is biosynthesized by all animal cells, {{because it is an}} essential structural component of all <b>animal</b> <b>cell</b> membranes; essential to maintain both membrane structural integrity and fluidity. Cholesterol enables animal cells to dispense with a cell wall (to protect membrane integrity and cell viability), thereby allowing animal cells to change shape rapidly and animals to move (unlike bacteria and plant cells, which are restricted by their cell walls).|$|E
25|$|In 2005, {{a team of}} {{researchers}} at Cornell University, including Hod Lipson, implemented a self-assembling machine. The machine is composed of a tower of four articulated cubes, known as molecubes, which can revolve about a triagonal. This enables the tower to function as a robotic arm, collecting nearby molecubes and assembling them into a copy of itself. The arm is directed by a computer program, which is contained within each molecube, analogous to how each <b>animal</b> <b>cell</b> contains an entire copy of its DNA. However, the machine cannot manufacture individual molecubes, nor do they occur naturally, so its status as a self-replicator is debatable.|$|E
25|$|Cholesterol, {{given that}} it composes about 30% of all <b>animal</b> <b>cell</b> membranes, is {{required}} to build and maintain membranes and modulates membrane fluidity over the range of physiological temperatures. The hydroxyl group on cholesterol interacts with the polar heads of the membrane phospholipids and sphingolipids, while the bulky steroid and the hydrocarbon chain are embedded in the membrane, alongside the nonpolar fatty-acid chain of the other lipids. Through the interaction with the phospholipid fatty-acid chains, cholesterol increases membrane packing, which both alters membrane fluidity and maintains membrane integrity so that animal cells {{do not need to}} build cell walls (like plants and most bacteria). The membrane remains stable and durable without being rigid, allowing animal cells to change shape and animals to move.|$|E

500|$|Eukaryotic cells feature {{compartmentalized}} membrane-bound organelles {{that carry}} out different biological functions. The glycerophospholipids {{are the main}} structural component of biological membranes, such as the cellular plasma membrane and the intracellular membranes of organelles; in animal cells, the plasma membrane physically separates the intracellular components from the extracellular environment. The glycerophospholipids are amphipathic molecules (containing both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions) that contain a glycerol core linked to two fatty acid-derived [...] "tails" [...] by ester linkages and to one [...] "head" [...] group by a phosphate ester linkage. While glycerophospholipids are the major component of biological membranes, other non-glyceride lipid components such as sphingomyelin and sterols (mainly cholesterol in <b>animal</b> <b>cell</b> membranes) are also found in biological membranes. In plants and algae, the galactosyldiacylglycerols, and sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol, which lack a phosphate group, are important components of membranes of chloroplasts and related organelles and are the most abundant lipids in photosynthetic tissues, including those of higher plants, algae and certain bacteria.|$|E

The presence of two −COOH (carboxylic acid) groups on the same carbon in the gamma-carboxyglutamate residue allows it to chelate calcium ions. The binding of calcium ions in this way very often triggers the function or binding of Gla-protein enzymes, such as the so-called vitamin K-dependent clotting factors discussed below.|$|E
2500|$|Adequate {{determinism}} is {{the idea}} that quantum indeterminacy can be ignored for most macroscopic events. This is because of quantum decoherence. Random quantum events [...] "average out" [...] in the limit of large numbers of particles (where the laws of quantum mechanics asymptotically approach the laws of classical mechanics). Stephen Hawking explains a similar idea: he says that the microscopic world of quantum mechanics is one of determined probabilities. That is, quantum effects rarely alter the predictions of classical mechanics, which are quite accurate (albeit still not perfectly certain) at larger scales. Something as large as an <b>animal</b> <b>cell,</b> then, would be [...] "adequately determined" [...] (even in light of quantum indeterminacy).|$|E

2500|$|Nearly all cell {{membranes}} in animals, plants and fungi maintain a voltage {{difference between the}} exterior and interior of the cell, called the membrane potential.

In some types of electrically active cells, including neurons and muscle cells, the voltage fluctuations frequently {{take the form of a}} rapid upward spike followed by a rapid fall. [...] These up-and-down cycles are known as action potentials. In some types of neurons the entire up-and-down cycle takes place in a few thousandths of a second. [...] In muscle cells, a typical action potential lasts about a fifth of a second. In some other types of cells, and in plants, an action potential may last three seconds or more.|$|E
60|$|With {{but little}} break we come here upon a {{significant}} analogy, parallel to an analogy already described. As was pointed out, an inorganic {{body that is}} modifiable by its medium, acquires, after a time, an outer coat which has already undergone such change as surrounding agencies can effect; has a contained mass which is as yet unchanged, because unreached; and has a surface between the two where change is going on--a region of activity. And we saw that alike in the vegetal cell and the <b>animal</b> <b>cell</b> there exist analogous distributions: of course with the difference that the innermost part is not inert. Now we have to note that in those aggregates of cells constituting the Metaphyta and Metazoa, analogous distributions also exist. In plants they are of course not to be looked for in leaves and other deciduous portions, but only in portions of long duration--stems and branches. Naturally, too, we need not expect them in plants having modes of growth which early produce an outer practically dead part, that effectually shields the inner actively living part of the stem from {{the influence of the}} medium--long-lived acrogens such as tree-ferns and long-lived endogens such as palms. But in the highest plants, exogens, which have the actively living part of their stems within reach of environing agencies, we find this part,--the cambium layer,--is one from which there is a growth inwards forming wood, and a growth outwards forming bark: there is an increasingly thick covering (where it does not scale off) of tissue changed by the medium, and inside this a film of highest vitality. In so far as concerns the present argument, it is the same with the Metazoa, or at least all of them which have developed organizations. The outer skin grows up from a limiting plane, or layer, a little distance below the surface--a place of predominant vital activity. Here perpetually arise new cells, which, as they develop, are thrust outwards and form the epidermis: flattening and drying up as they approach the surface, whence, having for a time served to shield the parts below, they finally scale off and leave younger ones to take their places. This still undifferentiated tissue forming the base of the epidermis, and existing also as a source of renewal in internal organs, is the essentially living substance; and facts above given imply that it was the action of the medium on this essentially living substance, which, during early stages in the organization of the Metazoa, initiated that protective envelope which presently became an inherited structure--a structure which, though now mainly inherited, still continues to be modifiable by its initiator.|$|E
