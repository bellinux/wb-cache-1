25|$|The {{producing}} mint of each coin may {{be easily}} identified, as most coins bear a mint mark. The identifying {{letter of the}} mint {{can be found on}} the front side of most coins, and is often placed near the year. Unmarked coins are issued by the Philadelphia mint. Among marked coins, Philadelphia coins bear a letter P. Denver coins bear a letter D, San Francisco coins bear a letter S, and West Point coins bear a letter W. S and W coins are rarely, if ever, found in general circulation, <b>although</b> <b>S</b> coins bearing dates prior to the mid-1970s are in circulation. The CC, O, C, and D mint marks were used on gold and silver coins for various periods in the mid-nineteenth century until the early twentieth century by temporary mints in Carson City, Nevada; New Orleans, Louisiana; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Dahlonega, Georgia; respectively: most such coins still extant are now in the hands of collectors and museums.|$|E

25|$|Staphylococcus aureus (also {{known as}} golden staph) is a gram-positive, round-shaped {{bacterium}} {{that is a}} member of the Firmicutes, and it {{is a member of}} the normal flora of the body, frequently found in the nose, respiratory tract, and on the skin. It is often positive for catalase and nitrate reduction and is a facultative anaerobe that can grow without the need for oxygen. <b>Although</b> <b>S.</b> aureus is not always pathogenic (and can commonly be found existing as a commensal), it is a common cause of skin infections including abscesses, respiratory infections such as sinusitis, and food poisoning. Pathogenic strains often promote infections by producing virulence factors such as potent protein toxins, and the expression of a cell-surface protein that binds and inactivates antibodies. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of S. aureus such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is a worldwide problem in clinical medicine. Despite much research and development there is no approved vaccine for S. aureus.|$|E
25|$|The ant faces many {{respiratory}} challenges due to {{its highly}} variable environment, which can cause increased desiccation, hypoxia, and hypercapnia. Hot, humid climates cause an increase in heart rate and respiration which increases energy and water loss. Hypoxia and hypercapnia can result from red imported fire ant colonies living in poorly ventilated thermoregulatory mounds and underground nests. Discontinuous gas exchange (DGE) may allow ants to survive the hypercapnic and hypoxic conditions frequently found in their burrows; it is ideal for adapting to these conditions because it allows the ants to increase the period of O2 intake and CO2 expulsion independently through spiracle manipulation. The invasion success of the red imported fire ant may possibly be related to its physiological tolerance to abiotic stress, being more heat tolerant and more adaptable to desiccation stress than S. richteri. This means that the ant is less vulnerable to heat and desiccation stress. <b>Although</b> <b>S.</b> richteri has higher water body content than the red imported fire ant, S. richteri was more vulnerable to desiccation stress. The lower sensitivity to desiccation {{is due to a}} lower water loss rate. Colonies living in unshaded and warmer sites tend to have a higher heat tolerance than those living in shaded and cooler sites.|$|E
500|$|The global {{population}} of the common starling {{is estimated to be}} more than 310million individuals and its numbers are not thought to be declining significantly, so the bird is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern. It had shown a marked increase in numbers throughout Europe from the 19th century to around the 1950s and 60s. In about 1830, S. v. vulgaris expanded its range in the British Isles, spreading into Ireland and areas of Scotland where it had formerly been absent, <b>although</b> <b>S.</b> v. zetlandicus was already present in Shetland and the Outer Hebrides. The common starling has bred in northern Sweden from 1850 and in Iceland from 1935. The breeding range spread through southern France to northeastern Spain, and there were other range expansions particularly in Italy, Austria and Finland. It started breeding in Iberia in 1960, while the spotless starling's range had been expanding northward since the 1950s. The low rate of advance, about [...] per year for both species, is due to the suboptimal mountain and woodland terrain. Expansion has since slowed even further due to direct competition between the two similar species where they overlap in southwestern France and northwestern Spain.|$|E

500|$|According to some accounts, Sing and {{his wife}} were honoured by the local {{community}} when they arrived in Proserpine, Queensland, in late 1918. Other accounts, however, state that <b>although</b> <b>Sing</b> arranged for passage from Scotland to Australia for his wife, {{there was no evidence that}} she made the journey. If Sing's wife did come to Australia, it appears that she left her husband after a few years; Tate suggests that the [...] "transition from the green hills and ancient culture of Edinburgh to the dust and rough life of the mining district around Clermont must have been traumatic for Elizabeth Sing" [...] and might have been a reason for her departure.|$|R
2500|$|The {{carriage}} of S. aureus is {{an important}} source of hospital-acquired infection (also called nosocomial) and community-acquired MRSA. [...] <b>Although</b> <b>S.</b> aureus can be present on the skin of the host, a large proportion of its carriage is through the anterior nares of the nasal passages and can further be present in the ears. The ability of the nasal passages to harbour [...] S. aureus results from a combination of a weakened or defective host immunity and the bacterium's ability to evade host innate immunity. Nasal carriage is also implicated in the occurrence of staph infections.|$|E
2500|$|S. mutans {{has over}} time {{developed}} strategies to successfully colonize {{and maintain a}} dominant presence in the oral cavity.

S. mutans has been able to evolve from nutrition-limiting conditions to protect itself in extreme conditions. [...] Streptococci represent 20% of the oral bacteria and actually determine the development of the biofilms. [...] <b>Although</b> <b>S.</b> mutans can be antagonized by pioneer colonizers, once they become dominant in oral biofilms, dental caries can develop and thrive.|$|E

As expected, Ss showed more positive reactions to upward comparison information than to downward comparison information. Moreover, neuroticism was related to responding more negatively and less positively to social comparison information. <b>Although</b> <b>Ss</b> high and low in neuroticism {{did not differ in}} their reactions to downward comparison information, low neuroticism was associated with more positive responding to upward comparison information.
