5|$|Iron {{and steel}} are used widely in the {{construction}} of roads, railways, other infrastructure, <b>appliances,</b> <b>and</b> buildings. Most large modern structures, such as stadiums and skyscrapers, bridges, and airports, are supported by a steel skeleton. Even those with a concrete structure employ steel for reinforcing. In addition, it sees widespread use in major <b>appliances</b> <b>and</b> cars. Despite growth in usage of aluminium, it is still the main material for car bodies. Steel is used in a variety of other construction materials, such as bolts, nails, and screws and other household products and cooking utensils.|$|E
5|$|Steel is an alloy of {{iron and}} carbon with trace amounts of other elements. Because of its high tensile {{strength}} and low cost, {{it is a major}} component used in buildings, infrastructure, tools, ships, automobiles, machines, <b>appliances,</b> <b>and</b> weapons.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Natapol Thongplew Thesis title: Greening {{production}} and consumption: The {{case of the}} <b>appliance</b> <b>and</b> dairy industries in Thailand This research looked into the greening of the <b>appliance</b> <b>and</b> dairy industries in globalizing Thailand from a product chain perspective. It studied roles <b>and</b> strategies of <b>appliance</b> <b>and</b> dairy companies in greening consumption with an explicit involvement of consumers. This research finds that <b>appliance</b> <b>and</b> diary have increasingly attempted to engage Thai consumers in buying and using more sustainable products. To do so, companies employ different consumer-oriented strategies, including providing environmental information; however, they {{do not yet have}} a full-fledged consumer-oriented strategy to activate and engage (silent green) consumers. The study summarizes that <b>appliance</b> <b>and</b> diary companies in Thailand can advance their consumer-oriented strategies for better engaging Thai consumers (with green products and green markets) by acknowledging the role of consumers as citizens, recognizing emerging sustainable practices and lifestyles of citizens, and organizing consumer groups.  ...|$|R

5|$|The {{fire station}} {{contained}} flats for 32 firemen {{and their families}} and 6 single firemen. Facilities included a laundry, gym, billiards room and children's play-areas. The complex contained stables for the horses that pulled the fire <b>appliances,</b> <b>and</b> a blacksmith's workshop. There were electric bells and lights to alert firemen to an alarm, poles to expedite the firemen's response, suspended harnesses to allow the horses to be harnessed quickly, and electric doors. The fire station was also designed with foresight; the appliance bays were made wide enough to take motorised fire appliances. The station's first motorised fire appliance arrived in 1911, five years after it opened.|$|E
5|$|Warren and her {{daughter}} Amelia Tyagi wrote The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Mothers and Fathers Are Going Broke. Warren and Tyagi point out that a fully employed worker today earns less inflation-adjusted income than a fully employed worker did 30years ago. Although families spend less today on clothing, <b>appliances,</b> <b>and</b> other consumption, the costs of core expenses such as mortgages, health care, transportation, and child care have increased dramatically. The result is that even with two income earners, families are {{no longer able to}} save and have incurred greater and greater debt.|$|E

5|$|Gibson {{pursued a}} {{successful}} business career. He {{worked as a}} salesman for Hoover products. In January 1933 he established his own company A.H. Gibson (Electrical), which was a distributor of electrical <b>appliances</b> <b>and</b> parts. He also spent some time working in New York. His company became A.H. Gibson Industries Ltd, and was listed on the stock exchange from 1949 to 1959, during which period he was chairman and managing director. Gibson also held other directorships, most notably of Volkswagen Australasia from 1961 to 1967 and Hoover Australia from 1964 to 1970. An active member of Victoria's wider business community in the 1940s, he was President of the Electricity and Radio Federation of Victoria (1947–1949) and President of the Institute of Sales and Business Management (1946–1949).|$|E
5|$|On September 23, {{just days}} after the storm moved through, President George W. Bush {{declared}} New Castle County, Delaware as a disaster area following the effects of Henri and later Hurricane Isabel. The declaration designated the affected citizens eligible for grants to pay for temporary housing, house repairs, and serious disaster-related expenses. The declaration also allowed for federal funding for 75% of the repair cost for replacing public facilities. By two months after the storm, 659residents had applied for disaster aid through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), totaling to just over $1million (2003USD, $1.1million 2006USD). 141small businesses applied for loans, totaling to around $2.5million (2003USD, $2.75million 2006USD). In addition, FEMA received 183applications for public assistance, which would be used for rebuilding public roads and buildings. Over twentyvolunteer organizations met to establish a long-term committee to find resources for disaster recovery needs. One goal sought by the committee was to find a permanent housing solution for every one who was displaced from their houses from the storms. Volunteers also helped remove ruined <b>appliances</b> <b>and</b> furniture to local landfills, totaling to more than 300tons. State and county governments in Delaware purchased 171homes following the damage in the Glenville area, the highest number of houses purchased in the state due to storm damage. The house purchasing was done to mitigate the flood damage by restoring the area as a wetland.|$|E
5|$|The {{script for}} Part 3 called for Jason {{to wear a}} mask to cover his face, having worn a bag over his head in Part 2; what no one {{knew at the time}} was that the mask chosen would become a {{trademark}} for the character, and one instantly recognizable in popular culture in the years to come. During production, Steve Miner called for a lighting check. None of the effects crew wanted to apply any make-up for the light check, so they decided to just throw a mask on Brooker. The film's 3D effects supervisor, Martin Jay Sadoff, was a hockey fan, and had a bag of hockey gear with him on the set. He pulled out a Detroit Red Wings goaltender mask for the test. Miner loved the mask, but it was too small. Using a substance called VacuForm, Doug White enlarged the mask and created a new mold to work with. After White finished the molds, Terry Ballard placed red triangles on the mask to give it a unique appearance. Holes were punched into the mask and the markings were altered, making it different from Sadoff's mask. There were two prosthetic face masks created for Richard Brooker to wear underneath the hockey mask. One mask was composed of approximately 11 different <b>appliances</b> <b>and</b> took about six hours to apply to Brooker's face; this mask was used for scenes where the hockey mask was removed. In the scenes where the hockey mask is over the face, a simple head mask was created. This one-piece mask would slip on over Brooker's head, exposing his face but not the rest of his head.|$|E

40|$|The {{increased}} {{consumption of}} <b>appliance</b> <b>and</b> electronic products by lower-income population represented a growth opportunity for {{companies in the}} sector. The overall objective {{of this paper is}} to investigate how <b>appliance</b> <b>and</b> electronic product manufacturers draw up their marketing planning for low-end products. An exploratory approach was taken in this study, comprising the literature review and the empirical research which was conducted in two stages by combining the qualitative and quantitative approaches. The study group comprised companies affiliated with National Association of <b>Appliance</b> <b>and</b> Electronic Product Manufacturers (ELETROS). Results indicate that in 87. 5 % of cases the marketing planning focuses on the product. The companies are concerned to differentiate the low-end products on the market mainly by design (87. 5 %) and innovation (62. 5 %). Within this context, it seems that the opportunity for growth of the <b>appliance</b> <b>and</b> electronic product companies can be boosted when implementing specific marketing planning for low-end products. Innovation is needed in all processes from project design of the product to its distribution.   </p...|$|R
