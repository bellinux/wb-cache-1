25|$|In the Georgia case of Berry v. Jackson, 115 Ga. 196, , {{recovery}} of property converted may be allowed in an <b>action</b> <b>of</b> <b>trover</b> where such is statutorily defined.|$|E
25|$|The {{conception}} that {{an action}} for conversion lies only for tangible property {{capable of being}} identified and taken into actual possession {{is based on a}} fiction by which the <b>action</b> <b>of</b> <b>trover</b> was founded, namely, that the defendant had found the property of another, which was lost. This conception has become, in the progress of the law, something without meaning which has been discarded by most courts. Therefore, it has been generally accepted that an action for conversion lies for every species of personal property which is the subject of private ownership, whether animate or inanimate. Intangible property can be the subject of a conversion in the United States. There cannot be an action in conversion for choses in action or mere debt. Computer software can be the subject of a conversion.|$|E
2500|$|Judge Ashurst said that, [...] "in {{order to}} {{maintain}} trover the plaintiff must have a right of property in the thing (ownership) and a right of possession, and unless both these rights concur, the <b>action</b> (<b>of</b> <b>trover)</b> will not lie."

2500|$|Armory v Delamirie , {{is a case}} {{which is}} {{frequently}} cited in United States Tort Law texts as the primary illustration <b>of</b> <b>action</b> in <b>trover.</b> A chimney sweep found a jewel while cleaning a chimney. He took it to a jeweler for evaluation. The jeweler removed the stone from the setting, {{with the intention of}} selling it to a third party. The chimney sweep was entitled to recover damages from the loss of the jewel. The case illustrates several pertinent issues with trover. First, the chimney sweep was not the primary owner of the jewel. Since the original owner could not be identified, the chimney sweep was the best owner. He had superior rights to the stone over the jeweler. The <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> the jeweler constituted a conversion. The possession by the chimney sweep was prima facie proof of ownership. A similar result was seen in Jeffries v Great Western Ry [...]|$|R
2500|$|Early trover cases {{involved}} the keeping or taking of a bailment by the bailee (the person charged {{to hold them}} with [...] "ordinary care"). Others concerned the use of lost chattels found by another. Who was the real owner? Early on, there was difficulty in dealing with situations where chattels held by a bailee were used by a third party. Examples could be sheep, horses, farm goods, grains or other chattels left {{in the care of}} a person who was required to exercise ordinary care. If negligence led to damages, an action could be had. A third person might use the chattel, returning it in a damaged condition. [...] The early common law had some difficulty in dealing with this kind of situation. This led to expansions <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> in <b>trover.</b>|$|R
60|$|The Society is {{not asked}} to {{disseminate}} Anti-slavery doctrines, but simply to be even-handed between master and slave, and, since they have recommended Sambo and Toney to be obedient to Mr. Legree, to remind him in turn that he also has duties toward the bodies and souls of his bondmen. But {{we are told that}} the time has not yet arrived, that at present the ears of our Southern brethren are closed against all appeals, that God in his good time will turn their hearts, and that then, and not till then, will be the fitting occasion to do something in the premises. But if the Society is to await this golden opportunity with such exemplary patience in one case, why not in all? If it is to decline any attempt at converting the sinner till after God has converted him, will there be any special necessity for a tract society at all? Will it not be a little presumptuous, as well as superfluous, to undertake the doing over again of what He has already done? We fear that the studies of Blackstone, upon which the gentlemen who argue thus have entered in order to fit themselves for the legal and constitutional argument of the question, have confused their minds, and that they are misled by some fancied analogy between a tract and an <b>action</b> <b>of</b> <b>trover,</b> and conceive that the one, like the other, cannot be employed till after an actual conversion has taken place.|$|E
60|$|Whether Keats was {{original}} or not, I do {{not think}} it useful to discuss until it has been settled what originality is. Lord Houghton tells us that this merit (whatever it is) has been denied to Keats, because his poems take the color of the authors he happened to be reading at the time he wrote them. But men have their intellectual ancestry, and the likeness of some one of them is forever unexpectedly flashing out in the features of a descendant, it may be after a gap of several generations. In the parliament of the present every man represents a constituency of the past. It is true that Keats has the accent of the men from whom he learned to speak, but this is to make originality a mere question of externals, and in this sense the author of a dictionary might bring an <b>action</b> <b>of</b> <b>trover</b> against every author who used his words. It is the man behind the words that gives them value, and if Shakespeare help himself to a verse or a phrase, it is with ears that have learned of him to listen that we feel the harmony of the one, and it is the mass of his intellect that makes the other weighty with meaning. Enough that we recognize in Keats that indefinable newness and unexpectedness which we call genius. The sunset is original every evening, though for thousands of years it has built out of the same light and vapor its visionary cities with domes and pinnacles, and its delectable mountains which night shall utterly abase and destroy.|$|E

50|$|The Somerset judgment, even if {{limited to}} prohibiting the forcible removal of slaves from England, {{established}} a radical precedent. It went against recent common law {{authority in the}} official opinion of the Attorney-General, Sir Philip Yorke and the Solicitor-General, Mr Talbot in 1729 and the court decision of Sir Philip Yorke, by then Lord Chancellor Hardwicke, in 1749 {{in the case of}} Pearne v Lisle. These decisions had stated that slaves were items of property (Hardwicke described them as 'like stock on a farm') who were not emancipated either by becoming Christian or by entry into England, that possession of them could be recovered by the legal <b>action</b> <b>of</b> <b>trover</b> and that their master might lawfully compel them to leave England with him. The claim of 1749 relied on the opinion of 1729, which quoted no precedents and gave no reasoning. There were other freedom suits with different rulings before 1772, notably Shanley v Harvey (1763) and R v Stapylton (1771, also before Lord Mansfield).|$|E

6000|$|The Petty Sessions {{court that}} morning resembled Church on the {{occasion}} of a wedding; for the villagers <b>of</b> <b>Trover</b> had put on their black clothes and grouped themselves according to their religious faiths--'Church' in the right, 'Chapel' in the left-hand aisle. They presented all that rich variety of type and monotony of costume which the remoter country still affords to the observer; their mouths were almost all a little open, and their eyes fixed with intensity on the Bench. The three magistrates--Squire Pleydell in the chair, Dr. Becket on his left, and 'the Honble' Calmady on his right--were by most seen {{for the first time in}} their judicial capacity; and curiosity was divided between their proceedings and observation of the rector's prosecutor, a small baker from the town whence the village <b>of</b> <b>Trover</b> derived its necessaries. The face of this fellow, like that of a white walrus, and the back of his bald head were of interest to everyone until the case was called, and the rector himself entered. In his thin black overcoat he advanced and stood as if a little dazed. Then, turning his ravaged face to the Bench, he jerked out: ...|$|R
2500|$|The theory <b>of</b> <b>trover</b> {{was that}} the defendant, by [...] "converting" [...] the chattel to his own use, had {{appropriated}} the plaintiff's property, {{for which he was}} required to make compensation. The plaintiff was not required to accept the chattel when it was tendered back to him. He could recover damages for the full value of the chattel at the time and place of conversion. The effect {{was that the}} defendant was compelled to buy the chattel at a forced sale, carried out by means <b>of</b> an <b>action</b> in <b>trover.</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} modern era, the debtor’s detainment or citizen’s arrest {{remained}} valid in Germany. Sometimes it {{was used as a}} tool to compel payment, other times it was used to secure the arrest of an individual and ensure a trial against them in order to garnish wages, replevin or a form <b>of</b> <b>trover.</b> This practice was particularly disgraceful to a person’s identity, but had different rules than criminal trials. It was more similar to the modern enforcement of sentences (Strafvollzug) e.g. the debtor would be able to work off their debt for a certain amount of days, graduated by how much they owed.|$|R
2500|$|The preoccupation of detinue {{with the}} two special cases of stray cattle and lost title-deeds persisted, and the general problem of {{recovering}} chattels which had neither been stolen or bailed was only solved with {{a new form of}} writ. [...] This was invented by adding a novel preamble to be inserted in the writ ostensurus quare. [...] This preamble alleged that the plaintiff casually lost possession of the chattel, that the defendant had found it, refused to restore it and converted it to his own use. [...] The full development <b>of</b> <b>trover</b> and conversion is seen by 1510. A discussion of more modern cases of a bailee (holder) in possession of a title-deed is found in Columbia Law Review.|$|R
2500|$|Trover {{has been}} {{described}} as an action in assumpsit which arose from the quare writs by adding the cum (Latin: [...] "with") which, then could allege that the defendant undertook (assumpsit, [...] "assumed the risk", or [...] "assumed the duty"), to do something. [...] Another clause which followed some time later contained the allegation <b>of</b> <b>trover,</b> and deals with situations which involved neither bailment nor a trespassory taking. In Bracton's day the appeal of larceny could be changed into an action de re adirata by omitting the words of felony. By this means a chattel could be recovered against a finder. If the finder refused in court to restore the chattel as adirata, the plaintiff could refile the claim ("claims afresh"), this time adding the word felony, indicating the action was for a real theft, and conversion.|$|R
25|$|The Tennessee Supreme Court {{observed}} it {{is essential}} in cases <b>of</b> <b>trover,</b> that the property must be found; it must {{at the time when}} the finder came upon it, to have been in such a situation as to clearly indicate that it was lost. It cannot have been placed there by the original owner who lost it by carelessness or forgetfulness, where it was later found by someone else. In such cases, the owner of the premises where the property is found is treated as a quasi-bailee (i.e. he holds the property for the original owner), and he may maintain trover against the finder. Since the log was not intentionally laid by the (unknown) owner on the land of the plaintiff (Deaderick), and hence he was not a quasi-bailee for the owner, he cannot hold against the superior right of the defendant (Oulds) arising out of his prior possession and earlier finding of the log. Judgment for ownership of the log was to the defendant Oulds.|$|R

Liability to the third bailee was not transferable. In later times, lawyers would talk <b>of</b> <b>trover</b> and bailment. In 1292, {{there was a slight}} tendency to regard the detainer rather than the bailment as the gist <b>of</b> the <b>action,</b> where it was stated [...] "it is not enough to say, 'you did not bail to me' , but one must add, 'and I do not detain it [...] from you.'" [...] But there are other later cases which show that it is impossible or at least extremely difficult for the bailor to fashion any count that will avail him against the third party. The third party was called the [...] "third hand".|$|R
