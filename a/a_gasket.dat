5|$|The Schenectady group {{improved}} on the anvils {{designed by}} Percy Bridgman, {{who received a}} Nobel Prize {{for his work in}} 1946. Bundy and Strong made the first improvements, then more were made by Hall. The GE team used tungsten carbide anvils within a hydraulic press to squeeze the carbonaceous sample held in a catlinite container, the finished grit being squeezed out of the container into <b>a</b> <b>gasket.</b> The team recorded diamond synthesis on one occasion, but the experiment could not be reproduced because of uncertain synthesis conditions, and the diamond was later shown to have been a natural diamond used as a seed.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difficulty}} {{the engineers}} struggled with {{was how to}} deal with radioactive contamination. Once the canyons began processing irradiated slugs, the machinery would become so radioactive that it would be unsafe for humans ever to come in contact with it. The engineers therefore had to devise methods to allow for the replacement of any component via remote control. They came up with a modular cell concept, which allowed major components to be removed and replaced by an operator sitting in a heavily shielded overhead crane. This method required early practical application of two technologies that later gained widespread use: Teflon, used as <b>a</b> <b>gasket</b> material, and closed-circuit television, used to give the crane operator a better view of the process.|$|E
5|$|Midshipman David Casey was an {{experienced}} junior {{officer who had}} distinguished himself to Captain Pigot during the previous months, but his disrating {{was one of the}} primary triggers to the mutiny. About a week before the mutiny, Casey was at his station on the main top, and the captain noticed that <b>a</b> <b>gasket,</b> one of the ties that held the sail securely, had not been tied by one of the sailors under his supervision. Casey was brought before the captain, and apologised for the oversight and took responsibility for it. The captain demanded that Casey apologise on his knees, a completely unacceptable and debasing demand for a gentleman. Casey refused to be humiliated in such a way. Pigot offered him one more opportunity and when Casey once more refused, the captain ordered that Casey receive 12 lashes (more commonly a sailor's punishment than that of a junior officer), and he was disrated, which would effectively end his career as a naval officer. Casey was a popular officer amongst the crew and they felt that he was punished unfairly. The topmen began to plot mutiny.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the effect}} of surface {{roughness}} appearing on a turned sealing surface on compressive stress and compressive force of copper <b>gaskets</b> (<b>a</b> fiat <b>gasket,</b> <b>a</b> ring joint <b>gasket</b> and <b>a</b> copper wire <b>gasket)</b> was studied. The results obtained can be summarized as follows : (I) In the case of <b>a</b> flat <b>gasket</b> or <b>a</b> ring joint <b>gasket,</b> in order to ignore both the surface roughness appearing on a turned sealing surface and the cross section of gasket, the compressive stress for sealing had to be nearly equal to 1. 3 times the tensile strength of the copper gasket. (2) In the case of <b>a</b> ring joint <b>gasket</b> or <b>a</b> copper wire <b>gasket,</b> the values of maximum heigh roughness, in which the minimum compressive force for sealing applied, {{were found in the}} region between 2 μm and 20 μm or not less than 110 μm respectively...|$|R

50|$|It is {{obviously}} essential for any piston engine {{to seal the}} joint between block and head. This is usually done by means of <b>a</b> head <b>gasket,</b> <b>a</b> flat <b>gasket</b> {{on the surface of}} the block. In early engines, the high pressures and high temperatures made this a difficult trial for the materials of the day and gasket failures were common. The junk head requires no head gasket and is sealed by piston rings inside the cylinder bore, as for the power piston.|$|R
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>gasket</b> used in {{a diamond}} anvil cell {{experiment}} is a thin metal foil, typically 0.3mm in thickness, which is placed in between the diamonds. Desirable materials for gaskets are strong, stiff metals such as rhenium or tungsten. Steel is frequently used as a cheaper alternative for low pressure experiments. The above-mentioned materials cannot be used in radial geometries where the x-ray beam must pass through the gasket. They are not transparent to x-rays, and thus if x-ray illumination through the gasket is required then lighter materials, such as beryllium, boron nitride, boron or diamond are used as <b>a</b> <b>gasket.</b> Gaskets are preindented by the diamonds and a hole is drilled {{in the center of}} the indentation to create the sample chamber.|$|E
25|$|A DAC {{consists}} of two opposing diamonds with a sample compressed between the polished culets (tips). Pressure may be monitored using a reference material whose behavior under pressure is known. Common pressure standards include ruby fluorescence, and various structurally simple metals, such as copper or platinum. The uniaxial pressure supplied by the DAC may be transformed into uniform hydrostatic pressure using a pressure-transmitting medium, such as argon, xenon, hydrogen, helium, paraffin oil or a mixture of methanol and ethanol. The pressure-transmitting medium is enclosed by <b>a</b> <b>gasket</b> and the two diamond anvils. The sample can be viewed through the diamonds and illuminated by X-rays and visible light. In this way, X-ray diffraction and fluorescence; optical absorption and photoluminescence; Mössbauer, Raman and Brillouin scattering; positron annihilation and other signals can be measured from materials under high pressure. Magnetic and microwave fields can be applied externally to the cell allowing nuclear magnetic resonance, electron paramagnetic resonance and other magnetic measurements. Attaching electrodes to the sample allows electrical and magnetoelectrical measurements as well as heating up the sample to a few thousand degrees. Much higher temperatures (up to 7000 K) can be achieved with laser-induced heating, and cooling down to millikelvins has been demonstrated.|$|E

40|$|Loss of {{pre-load}} with time, {{commonly known}} as ‘Relaxation’ is an established phenomena. Behaviour of a bolted joint depends upon the pre-load in the bolts in use, not the pre-load introduced by the mechanic. Loss of pre-load is expected due to the many factors such as embedment relaxation, gasket creep, elastic interactions, and vibration loosening or stress relaxation. In <b>a</b> <b>gasketed</b> joint, due to the gasket flexibility, relaxation is always substantial during preliminary passes, as 80 to 100 % loss is not uncommon in almost all the bolts, resulting in a dynamic behaviour. Pre-load in <b>a</b> <b>gasketed</b> joint is stabilized and retained to certain extent in the final passes only. In a non-gasketed joint, due to no gasket and no rotation its static behaviour is concluded. This paper highlights the factors affecting the amount of relaxation with time and presents important considerations that can reduce this. Both the {{short and long term}} relaxations are recorded and a ‘best fit’ model for relaxation behaviour is derived. </p...|$|R

2500|$|Because of its {{chemical}} inertness, PTFE {{cannot be}} cross-linked like an elastomer. Therefore, {{it has no}} [...] "memory" [...] and is subject to creep. Because of its superior chemical and thermal properties, PTFE is often used as <b>a</b> <b>gasket</b> material within industries that require resistance to aggressive chemicals such as pharmaceuticals or chemical processing. However, because of the propensity to creep, the long-term performance of such seals is worse than for elastomers which exhibit zero, or near-zero, levels of creep. In critical applications, Belleville washers are often used to apply continuous force to PTFE gaskets, ensuring a minimal loss of performance over the lifetime of the gasket.|$|E

60|$|There {{were many}} {{extraordinary}} tales related that night, on board Her Britannic Majesty's ship Coquette. The boatswain affirmed that, while piping below {{in order to}} overhaul the cables, he had heard a screaming in the air, that sounded as if a hundred devils were mocking him, and which he told the gunner, in confidence, he believed {{was no more than}} the winding of a call on board the brigantine, who had taken occasion, when other vessels were glad to anchor, to get under way, in her own fashion. There was also a fore-top-man named Robert Yarn, a fellow whose faculty for story-telling equalled that of Scheherazade, and who not only asserted, but who confirmed the declaration by many strange oaths, that while he lay on the lee-fore-top-sail-yard-arm, stretching forth an arm to grasp the leech of the sail, a dark-looking female fluttered over his head and caused her long hair to whisk into his face, in a manner that compelled him to shut his eyes, which gave occasion to a smart reprimand from the reefer of the top. There was a feeble attempt to explain this assault, by the man who lay next to Yarn, who affected to think the hair was no more than the end of <b>a</b> <b>gasket</b> whipping in the wind; but his shipmate, who had pulled one of the oars of the yawl, soon silenced this explanation, by the virtue of his long-established reputation for veracity. Even Trysail ventured several mysterious conjectures concerning the fate of the brigantine, in the gun-room; but, on returning from the duty of sounding the inlet, whither he had been sent by his captain, he was less communicative and more thoughtful than usual. It appeared, indeed, from the surprise that was manifested by every officer that heard the report of the quarter-master, who had given the casts of the lead on this service, {{that no one in the}} ship, with the exception of Alderman Van Beverout, was at all aware that there was rather more than two fathoms of water in that secret passage.|$|E

60|$|It being {{impossible}} to open {{any of the}} hatches in the fore part of the ship in communicating with the deck, the watch was changed by passing through the several berths to the companion-stair leading to the quarter-deck. The writer, therefore, made {{the best of his}} way aft, and, on a second attempt to look out, he succeeded, and saw indeed an astonishing sight. The sea or waves appeared to be ten or fifteen feet in height of unbroken water, and every approaching billow seemed as if it would overwhelm our vessel, but she continued to rise upon the waves and to fall between the seas in a very wonderful manner. It seemed to be only those seas which caught her in the act of rising which struck her with so much violence and threw such quantities of water aft. On deck there was only one solitary individual looking out, to give the alarm in the event of the ship breaking from her moorings. The seaman on watch continued only two hours; he who kept watch at this time was a tall, slender man of a black complexion; he had no greatcoat nor over-all of any kind, but was simply dressed in his ordinary jacket and trousers; his hat was tied under his chin with a napkin, and he stood aft the foremast, to which he had lashed himself with <b>a</b> <b>gasket</b> or small rope round his waist, to prevent his falling upon deck or being washed overboard. When the writer looked up, he appeared to smile, which afforded a further symptom of the confidence of the crew in their ship. This person on watch was as completely wetted {{as if he had been}} drawn through the sea, which was given as a reason for his not putting on a greatcoat, that he might wet as few of his clothes as possible, and have a dry shift when he went below. Upon deck everything that was movable was out of sight, having either been stowed below, previous to the gale, or been washed overboard. Some trifling parts of the quarter boards were damaged by the breach of the sea; and one of the boats upon deck was about one-third full of water, the oyle-hole or drain having been accidentally stopped up, and part of her gunwale had received considerable injury. These observations were hastily made, and not without occasionally shutting the companion, to avoid being wetted by the successive seas which broke over the bows and fell upon different parts of the deck according to the impetus with which the waves struck the vessel. By this time it was about three o'clock in the afternoon, and the gale, which had now continued with unabated force for twenty-seven hours, had not the least appearance of going off.|$|E
