5|$|English {{botanist}} and explorer Allan Cunningham collected what {{he called}} Grevillea sulphurea in 1822 near Coxs River in the Bathurst area, where it grew alongside G.rosmarinifolia and G.arenaria subspecies canescens.

5|$|One author {{regarded}} C.dentatus as {{a synonym}} of Coccomyces coronatus, although later authors have treated them separately. In 1923, Carlos Luigi Spegazzini tentatively reported {{the presence of}} C.dentatus on fallen Nothofagus leaves in Tierra del Fuego (southern South America); this species was later identified <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> species, C.australis.|$|E

5|$|Since 1979, Pachylemur has {{generally}} been regarded <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> genus, but some classifications include the genus in Lemur or the ruffed lemur genus Varecia. In a 1982 review, Ian Tattersall recognized two species, Lemur insignis and Lemur jullyi. He did not regard Pachylemur <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> genus or even subgenus. As Tattersall noted, Lemur jullyi Standing, 1904, is preoccupied by Palaeochirogalus jullyi Grandidier, 1899, and thus invalid. However, both names are based on material from the central plateau of Madagascar and Tattersall therefore presumed that they {{belong to the same}} species, which he could continue to call Lemur jullyi. Recent classifications recognize Pachylemur as a valid genus with two species—P.insignis (Filhol, 1895) and P.jullyi (Grandidier, 1899)—but express doubt about the distinction between the two species.|$|E

5|$|A form of {{the species}} found in Korea and Japan, A.hygrometricus var. koreanus, was named by V.J.

As pointed out by Fangfuk and colleagues, clarification of the proper name for this taxon must await analysis of A.hygrometricus var. koreanus specimens from the type locality in North Korea.|$|E
5|$|A rarely appearing, all-white {{form was}} {{initially}} described A.phalloides f. alba by Max Britzelmayr, though its status has been unclear. It is often found growing amid normally colored death caps. It has been described, in 2004, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> variety and includes what was termed A.verna var. tarda.

5|$|A.× cunninghamii (Albany Woollybush), {{a hybrid}} between A.cuneatus and A.sericeus, was first {{collected}} in 1827, and published as A.cunninghamii in 1845. Other than some dubious collections in the 1830s and 1840s, no further sightings {{are known to}} have been made until 1973, when Nelson rediscovered it. At the time it was regarded <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> species, but by 1995 it was thought to be a hybrid, and this was confirmed by genetic analysis in 2002. In appearance it is very similar to A.sericeus, but its leaf segments are flat rather than cylindrical.|$|E

5|$|Another species {{analysed}} in Gulden's 2001 study, Galerina pseudomycenopsis, {{also could}} not be distinguished from G.marginata based on ribosomal DNA sequences and {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} analyses. Because of differences in ecology, fruit body color and spore size combined with inadequate sampling, the authors preferred to maintain G.pseudomycenopsis <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> species. A 2005 study again failed to separate the two species using molecular methods, but reported that the incompatibility demonstrated in mating experiments suggests that the species are distinct.|$|E
5|$|Another species {{complex in}} Attalea {{includes}} A.speciosa and related species. Henderson (1995) recognised A.speciosa and A.spectabilis, considering {{the latter to}} either be an acaulescent form of A.speciosa or a hybrid between it and A.microcarpa. Govaerts and Dransfield accepted A.spectabilis, but Glassman considered it a dubious taxon. Attalea vitrivir was recognised <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> species by Michael Balick and coauthors; Glassman and Govaerts and Dransfield concurred, but Henderson considered it part of A.speciosa. Glassman also described a fourth member of this group, A.brejinhoensis, and it is accepted by Govaerts and Dransfield.|$|E
5|$|Asa Gray {{promoted}} {{and defended}} Origin against those American naturalists with an idealist approach, notably Louis Agassiz who viewed every species <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> fixed {{unit in the}} mind of the Creator, classifying as species what others considered merely varieties.

However, Madhvacharya does not mention Tantra <b>as</b> <b>a</b> separate, <b>distinct</b> religious or ritual-driven practice. The early 20th-century Indian scholar Pandurang Vaman Kane conjectured that Madhvacharya ignored Tantra because it may have been considered scandalous.

5|$|Curtis Gates Lloyd {{described}} the variety rochesterensis in 1909, originally {{as a new}} species, Phallus rochesterensis. It was found in Kew, Australia. A form with a pink-coloured indusium was reported by Vincenzo de Cesati in 1879 as Hymenophallus roseus, and later called Dictyophora indusiata f.rosea by Yosio Kobayasi in 1965; it is synonymous with Phallus cinnabarinus. A taxon described in 1936 as Dictyophora lutea and variously known for years as Dictyophora indusiata f.lutea, D.indusiata f.aurantiaca, or Phallus indusiatus f.citrinus, was formally transferred to Phallus in 2008 <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> species, Phallus luteus.|$|E

Thus {{it was easy to}} perceive B.verticillata as falling within the range of variation of this broadly defined species.

5|$|I. valdensis, a {{renaming}} of Vectisaurus valdensis by Ernst van den Broeck in 1900. Originally {{named by}} Hulke <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> genus in 1879 based on vertebral and pelvic remains, {{it was from}} the Barremian stage of the Isle of Wight.

5|$|Iguanodon gives {{its name}} to the unranked clade Iguanodontia, a very populous group of ornithopods with many species known from the Middle Jurassic to the Late Cretaceous. Aside from Iguanodon, the best-known members of the clade include Dryosaurus, Camptosaurus, Ouranosaurus, and the duck-bills, or hadrosaurs. In older sources, Iguanodontidae was shown <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> family. This family {{traditionally}} has been something of a wastebasket taxon, including ornithopods that were neither hypsilophodontids or hadrosaurids. In practice, animals like Callovosaurus, Camptosaurus, Craspedodon, Kangnasaurus, Mochlodon, Muttaburrasaurus, Ouranosaurus, and Probactrosaurus were usually assigned to this family.|$|E
