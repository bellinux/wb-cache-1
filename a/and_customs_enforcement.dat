40|$|Abstract: This article {{evaluates the}} Obama administration’s efforts towards {{reforming}} U. S. immigration detention policies. Over the past decade, immigrant rights advocates have increasingly criticized certain {{policies of the}} U. S.

In reviewing these developments, I contend that the Obama administration must take substantive steps towards reforming the existing system, particularly by instituting legally enforceable standards with penalties for performance failures, moving away from privatization, and applying more effective rulemaking for better management and monitoring of U. S. detention facilities...|$|R
40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The opportunity for employment {{is one of the}} most important magnets attracting illegal aliens to the United States.
