2500|$|News of Germany's {{impending}} military defeat {{spread throughout}} the German armed forces. The threat of mutiny was rife. Admiral Reinhard Scheer and Ludendorff decided to launch a last attempt to restore the [...] "valour" [...] of the German Navy. Knowing the government of Prince Maximilian of Baden would veto any such action, Ludendorff decided not to inform him. Nonetheless, word of the impending assault reached sailors at Kiel. Many, refusing {{to be part of}} a naval offensive, which they believed to be suicidal, rebelled and were arrested. Ludendorff took the blame; the Kaiser dismissed him on 26 October. The collapse of the Balkans meant that Germany was about to lose its main supplies of oil and food. Its reserves had been used up, even as U.S. troops kept arriving at the rate of 10,000 per day. The Americans supplied more than 80% of <b>Allied</b> <b>oil</b> during the war, and there was no shortage.|$|E

Polish pharmacist and inventor Ignacy Łukasiewicz established oil refinery in Jasło, then {{part of the}} Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Poland) in 1854. The first large refinery opened at Ploiești, Romania, in 1856-1857.

50|$|The Battle of the Caribbean {{refers to}} a naval {{campaign}} waged during World War II {{that was part of}} the Battle of the Atlantic, from 1941 to 1945. German U-boats and Italian submarines attempted to disrupt the <b>Allied</b> supply of <b>oil</b> and other material. They sank shipping in the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico and attacked coastal targets in the Antilles. Improved Allied anti-submarine warfare eventually drove the Axis submarines out of the Caribbean region.|$|R
5000|$|Anthony [...] "Tino" [...] De Angelis (born 1915) is a Bayonne, New Jersey-based {{commodities}} trader {{who bought}} and sold vegetable oil futures around the world. In 1962 he started to corner the market for soybean oil, used in salad dressing. In the aftermath, investors (51 banks) learned that he had bilked them out of about $175 million in total ($1.2 billion in year 2000 dollars). The scandal is named after De Angelis's company, <b>Allied</b> Crude Vegetable <b>Oil</b> Refining Corporation.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Allied</b> <b>oil</b> {{campaign}} of World War II {{was directed by}} the RAF and USAAF against facilities supplying Nazi Germany with petroleum, oil, and lubrication (POL) products.

50|$|On 16 February 1942, the Kriegsmarine Kapitänleutnant Werner Hartenstein {{devised a}} coordinated {{submarine}} attack against Caribbean targets including the Dutch island of Aruba. The Attack on Aruba {{turned out to}} be somewhat successful, the Germans sank or damaged several oil tankers but did not set ablaze the large oil tank on Aruba. Hoping to further disrupt a major <b>Allied</b> <b>oil</b> supply, Hartenstein ordered his U-boats to continue operating against the Aruba and Curaçao refineries.|$|E
50|$|In 1937, the {{synthetic}} fuel plant Hydrierwerke Pölitz AG {{was founded by}} IG Farben, Rhenania-Ossag, and Deutsch-Amerikanische Petroleum Gesellschaft which by 1943 was producing 15% of Nazi Germany's synthetic fuels, 577,000 tons. The plant derived its workforce from an adjacent system of camps (Pommernlager, Nordlager, Tobruklager, Wullenwever-Lager, Arbeitserziehungslager Hägerwelle, Dürrfeld Lager) plus a ship moored on the Oder River serving as a camp (Umschulungslager Bremerhaven). In addition, a subcamp of the Stutthof concentration camp was located in Pölitz. During World War II, the plant made Pölitz a bombing target of the <b>Allied</b> <b>Oil</b> Campaign leading to 70% of the town being destroyed.|$|E
5000|$|Nazi propagandist Arthur Dietrich and {{his team}} of agents in Mexico {{successfully}} manipulated editorials and coverage of Europe by paying hefty subsidies to Mexican newspapers, including the widely read dailies Excélsior and El Universal. [...] The situation became even more worrisome for the <b>Allies</b> when major <b>oil</b> companies boycotted Mexican oil following Lázaro Cárdenas' nationalization of the oil industry and expropriation of all corporate oil properties in 1938, which severed Mexico's access to its traditional markets and led Mexico to sell its oil to Germany and Italy.|$|R
50|$|Teagle {{has been}} accused of {{contributing}} to Nazi Germany during World War II through his involvement with German chemical company IG Farben. As a director of IG Farben's American subsidiary, he <b>allied</b> Standard <b>Oil</b> with the German company and conducted research jointly. Standard Oil supplied information to IG Farben on how to manufacture tetraethyl lead and synthetic rubber, both critical resources to the war effort. Because Teagle sold patent rights for synthetic rubber, Standard Oil delayed American industrial readiness by not producing rubber without German permission. Faced with a United States Department of Justice investigation, Teagle convinced President Franklin D. Roosevelt that a suit would hurt the war effort, instead choosing to pay an out-of-court fine. The result was a fall in public favor for Standard Oil and the resignation of Teagle in 1942, one year short of the mandatory retirement age. He was replaced by Ralph W. Gallagher.|$|R

The Persian and Alaskan routes each need 25 BRPs to open.|$|R
5000|$|In 1724, {{a textile}} factory was {{established}} in Schwechat. Schwechat profited massively from the Austrian industrialisation wave of the 19th century, many of the companies established then still existing today (like the famous Dreher Brewery, founded in 1796 by Franz Anton Dreher the Younger). Schwechat became a city in 1924 and was incorporated into Vienna in 1938. The city's oil refinery was a bombing target of the <b>Allied</b> <b>Oil</b> Campaign of World War II, with the southern aviation plant complex of the Heinkel firm also targeted in late 1943 and lasting through the spring of 1944.|$|E

50|$|On the Iranian home front, the {{combination}} of sanctions, declining oil prices, and Iraqi attacks on Iranian oil facilities and shipping took a heavy toll on the economy. While the attacks themselves were not as destructive as some analysts believed, the US-led Operation Earnest Will (which protected Iraqi and <b>allied</b> <b>oil</b> tankers, but not Iranian ones) led many neutral countries to stop trading with Iran because of rising insurance and fear of air attack. Iranian oil and non-oil exports fell by 55%, inflation reached 50% by 1987, and unemployment skyrocketed. At the same time, Iraq was experiencing crushing debt and shortages of workers, encouraging its leadership to try {{to end the war}} quickly.|$|E

Jerstad just two months after Zeamer's Medal of Honor action during the <b>Allied</b> raids on <b>oil</b> refineries in Ploieşti, Romania.) All other members of Zeamer's crew received the Distinguished Service Cross. It remains the most highly decorated single air mission, and Zeamer's regular crew the most highly decorated, in American history.|$|R
50|$|Strategic {{bombing in}} Europe never reached the decisive {{completeness}} the American campaign against Japan achieved, helped {{in part by}} the fragility of Japanese housing, which was particularly vulnerable to firebombing through the use of incendiary bombs. The destruction of German infrastructure became apparent, but the Allied campaign against Germany only really succeeded when the <b>Allies</b> began targeting <b>oil</b> refineries and transportation {{in the last year of}} the war. At the same time, strategic bombing of Germany was used as a morale booster for the Allies in the period before the land war resumed in Western Europe in June 1944.|$|R

Another brother, Prince Abdul Muhsin, vocally supported the movement and suggested a constitutional monarchy. In addition, the movement was also supported by younger princes from the cadet branches of the House of Saud. Another significant <b>ally</b> was then <b>oil</b> minister Abdullah Tariki.

Following perceived Iraqi unwillingness to co-operate with UN weapons inspections, core members of the PNAC including Richard Perle, Paul Wolfowitz, R. James Woolsey, Elliot Abrams, Donald Rumsfeld, Robert Zoellick, and John Bolton were among the signatories of an open letter initiated by the PNAC to President Bill Clinton calling {{for the removal of}} Saddam Hussein. Portraying Saddam Hussein {{as a threat to the}} United States, its Middle East <b>allies,</b> and <b>oil</b> resources in the region, and emphasizing the potential danger of any Weapons of Mass Destruction under Iraq's control, the letter asserted that the United States could [...] "no longer depend on our partners in the Gulf War to continue to uphold the sanctions or to punish Saddam when he blocks or evades UN inspections." [...] Stating that American policy [...] "cannot continue to be crippled by a misguided insistence on unanimity in the UN Security Council," [...] the letter's signatories asserted that [...] "the U.S. has the authority under existing UN resolutions to take the necessary steps, including military steps, to protect our vital interests in the Gulf." [...] Believing that UN sanctions against Iraq would be an ineffective means of disarming Iraq, PNAC members also wrote a letter to Republican members of the U.S. Congress Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott, urging Congress to act, and supported the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 (H.R.4655) which President Clinton signed into law in October 1998.|$|R

Despite this, he was able to obtain a contract with Food for Peace, a federal program which sold excess food stocks to poor countries. De Angelis discovered that he could obtain loans based upon the company's supposed inventory of salad oil.Ships apparently full of salad oil would arrive at the docks, and inspectors would confirm that the ships were indeed full of oil, allowing the company to obtain millions in loans. In reality, the ships were mostly filled with water, with only a few feet of salad oil on top. Since the oil floated on top of the water, it appeared to inspectors that these ships were loaded with oil. The company even transferred oil between different tanks while entertaining the inspectors at lunch. In all, Allied claimed to have 1.8 billion pounds of soybean oil, when it actually only had 110 million pounds. The claimed inventory was the basis for the company raising $180 million from investors.|$|R
