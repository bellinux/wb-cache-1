25|$|The {{marriage}} ceremony was celebrated {{with all due}} tradition in Esma Sultan Palace {{in the presence of}} Sultan's ministers in 1844. One week after that, she was ushered into Esma Sultan's silver-lined carriage in her pearl-trimmed red dress, tiara and bridal veil and sent off to the palace. In those days Sultan Abdülmecid still resided in Topkapı Palace, and he greeted his bride at the main entrance gate into the harem, wearing a splendid uniform with an <b>aigrette</b> plump atop his fez. He took her by the arm and escorted her into the Sovereign's Hall in the palace harem, having her take a seat in the nook that had been prepared for the bride. Mahmud II's daughters and wives came in and joined in the ceremony, as did the wives of important personages.|$|E
2500|$|The design {{began in}} Paris but became known in Britain. It was {{described}} in an 1868 fashion article in The Guardian reprinted from the French fashion magazine Le Follet: [...] "There is also the 'Eugenie' in honour of the Empress, in very fine leghorn, with a broad edge inclining over the eyes, trimmed {{with a bunch of}} white feathers, an <b>aigrette</b> of roses, an orchid or moss and field flowers. The chapeau 'Eugenie' is not very becoming to all faces: it requires to be worn by a very pretty and stylish lady". Eugenie's fashion choices appeared in influential US publications such as Godey's Lady's Book and it seems likely images of the hat may have been circulated to an American audience. The Metropolitan Museum of Art collection includes a straw hat of 1860 of a similar neat style to the Eugénie hat.|$|E

60|$|Edgar {{translated}} the pasha's speech, and {{then opened the}} box presented to himself. It contained a superb <b>aigrette,</b> mounted upon a brooch-like ornament by which it was fastened to a turban. This ornament, which was some four inches in diameter, was composed entirely of precious stones, with an emerald of great size in the centre. He looked at Sir Sidney Smith.|$|E

60|$|I caught Jerry's enthusiasm, {{and while}} she hunted out the box {{containing}} the black lace dress, I hastily gathered together some other odds and ends I thought might be useful--a black <b>aigrette,</b> {{a pair of black}} silk gloves, a spangled gauze fan, and a pair of slippers. They wouldn't have stood daylight, but they looked all right after night. As we left the room I caught up some pale pink roses on my table.|$|E

60|$|Kate had not {{the most}} remote notion what an <b>aigrette</b> might be, but {{she thought it would}} sound well for a countess; and she went on musing very pleasantly on the amiable {{simplicity}} of the countess, and the speech that was to cure the aunts of playing at cards on a Sunday, wearing turbans, and all other enormities, and lead them to live in the country, giving a continual course of school feasts, and surprising meritorious families with gifts of cows. She only wished she had a pencil to draw it all to show Sylvia, provided Sylvia would know her cows from her tables.|$|E
60|$|Selina's thin little lips became compressed, and for {{a moment}} she forgot to smile. Her cousin indeed! Mary, who was sitting there in a plain black gown without a single ornament, and not even a flower, looking for all the world like the poor {{relation}} she was! Selina glanced downwards at the great bunch of roses and maidenhair fern in her bosom, at the fancy and beaded trimming which ran like a nightmare all over her new gown, and which she was absolutely certain had come from Paris; at the heavy gold bracelets which concealed some part of her thin arms; she remembered suddenly the <b>aigrette</b> in her hair, such a finish to her costume, and her self-confidence returned.|$|E
60|$|The {{dress of}} the stranger, {{although}} gorgeous, was, however, certainly not classic. A crimson shawl was wound round {{his head and}} glittered with a trembling <b>aigrette</b> of diamonds. His vest which set tight to his form, was of green velvet, richly embroidered with gold and pearls. Over this he wore a very light jacket of crimson velvet, equally embroidered, and lined with sable. He wore also the full white camese common among the Albanians; and while his feet were protected by sandals, {{the lower part of}} his legs was guarded by greaves of embroidered green velvet. From a broad belt of scarlet leather peeped forth the jewelled hilts of a variety of daggers, and by his side was an enormous scimitar, in a scabbard of chased silver.|$|E
60|$|So saying, Ned emptied a large handbag {{upon the}} top of a barrel which served as a table. Colonel Warrener gave a cry of astonishment, as a great stream of bracelets, necklaces, tiaras, <b>aigrettes,</b> and other ornaments, poured out of the bag.|$|R
