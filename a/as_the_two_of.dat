5|$|At Hinata House, Keitarō meets Naru Narusegawa, {{who is also}} {{studying}} to enter Tokyo University. Naru ranks first {{in the whole of}} Japan on the practice exams, and Keitarō convinces her to help him study. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> them grow closer through their studies, and after Keitarō accidentally reads a small section of Naru's diary, he becomes increasingly convinced that Naru may be the girl with whom he made the promise. On {{the second day of the}} Tokyo University exam, Keitarō asks Naru about the promise and is stunned when she tells him he is mistaken. Despite their studying, and Naru's mock exam results, they both fail the exams. The pair then have an argument and independently run off to Kyoto to clear their heads. While on their trip they settle their differences and meet Mutsumi Otohime, who lives in Okinawa and is also studying for the Tokyo University exams.|$|E

Meanwhile, an unknown blogger is targeting the Winters family online, with photos of Hilary kissing Cane as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> them in a hotel room. After a private investigation, the Winters figure out Hilary is the blogger (as she blames Neil for her mother's death years prior) just as Hilary attempts to drug Cane. She is fired from Chancellor Industries and shunned by the family. Soon after, everyone gets word that Katherine has died from terminal cancer while on trip around the world.

25|$|Kürd Mehmed {{took for}} himself Abaza Hasan's former post as voyvoda of the Yeni Il Türkmen, and {{subsequently}} sought to undermine Ibşir Pasha's other former supporters. One {{of these was}} Seydi Ahmed Pasha, who had recently been appointed governor of Karaman. While Seydi {{was on his way}} to the provincial capital, Konya, Kürd Mehmed entered the city and convinced the population to resist the incoming governor, warning of his tyranny. Thus when Seydi arrived, he found the city armed against him with Kürd Mehmed organizing its defense. This led to an alliance between Seydi Ahmed and Abaza Hasan, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> them besieged Konya together, driving Kürd Mehmed out of the city. Yet by this time, orders had arrived from Istanbul removing Seydi from his post and assigning him to Aleppo instead. When Seydi and Abaza Hasan arrived, they found that Kürd Mehmed had done the same thing there as well, rallying the population of Aleppo to defend the city against them. Ultimately, Aleppo fell into Seydi's hands and Kürd Mehmed fled to Adana, where he and his men were killed.|$|E

Executive producer Diederick Santer spoke of his excitement at Nick's return, hailing the character as an [...] "EastEnders legend" [...] and [...] "one of the show's best-remembered and best-loved villains". Altman stated: [...] "After an absence of seven years, I am thrilled to return to Albert Square. The BBC have always given me great storylines as Nick Cotton and I look forward to seeing if Nick will once again spread fear and loathing throughout the Square!" [...] June Brown revealed that she had been asking producers to bring Altman back to the soap for 6 or 7 years, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> them share such a good working relationship. After spending time in Walsall, Cotton returns; walking normally again, and he is accompanied by his seven-year-old daughter, Dotty. He explained that he had met Dotty's mother Sandy while living in a squat, and that she was an alcoholic who had recently died, leaving him with custody of Dotty. Altman explained: [...] "Nick needed something, because I think if he didn’t have little Dotty, for him to walk through that door, she would just have treated him as a complete outcast."

Alfonso Cuarón, director of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban compared Voldemort with George W. Bush and Saddam Hussein, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> them [...] "...have selfish interests and are very much in love with power. Also, a disregard for the environment. A love for manipulating people." [...] Andrew Slack and the Harry Potter Alliance compare media consolidation in the U.S. to Voldemort's regime in Deathly Hallows and its control over the Daily Prophet and other media saying that [...] "Once Voldemort took over every form of media in the wizarding world, Dumbledore's Army and the Order of the Phoenix formed an independent media movement called 'Potterwatch'. Now the HP Alliance and Wizard Rock have come together to fight for a Potterwatch movement in the real world to fight back against Big VoldeMedia from further pushing out local and foreign news, minority representation, and the right to a Free Press." [...] Julia Turner from Slate Magazine also noted similarities between the events of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and the current War on Terror. She said that Voldemort takes up terrorism by destroying bridges, murdering innocents, and forcing children to kill their elders.|$|E
