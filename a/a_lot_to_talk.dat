500|$|Differing from Survivor in that {{previously}} Beyoncé {{had taken an}} active role in writing and producing, Destiny Fulfilled saw each member contributing inputs culled from personal experiences and individual opinions and points of view not dependent from the others'. In most cases, producers of the album would send them a CD containing a track that would be the group's basis in the songwriting process; without the producer's supervision of which part to sing, that formed a new direction of their style different from their previous records. The traditional approach where each member sang one verse and chimed in the chorus was replaced; in some songs in Destiny Fulfilled, their vocals were alternated in every line of the lyrics, a technique similar to hip hop artists. Destiny's Child took the role of executive producing alongside their manager, Mathew Knowles. Beyoncé, who vocally produced the songs, commented that it was important for her to make sure their voices were audible and identifiable. Taking it as one of her goals, the group decided to focus on mid-tempo songs and on few dance numbers and ballads—which they considered people cannot sing with. Beyoncé elaborated [...] "We {{wanted to make sure that}} the songs would be something that we were proud of 10 years from now, 20 years from now. We wanted it to be something that people can really feel an emotion to. Up-tempo songs can do that, but they more make you wanna dance." [...] As Rowland was recently engaged in the time of the writing of the album, it further influenced her songwriting. She also cited that being apart from the group affected the album as well: [...] "All of us have been in three different places... so there's <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about, a lot that's gone on, personally. I think it's important to talk about that on this new record, to put what we've been going through separately into the new record." ...|$|E

It was co-produced by Tommy McClendon with additional production {{being done by}} Dem Jointz. Mixing was done by Serban Ghenea and John Hanes served as the song's engineer. It is a mid-tempo R&B song, with its instrumentation consisting in a thumping bass and a subdued [...] "funky" [...] beat, having a [...] "distinctive Janet sound", according to some critics, and a soul-sample, while Jackson's vocals were considered [...] "breezy" [...] and [...] "soulful". It starts with [...] "a melodic almost a cappella intro, with Janet singing, [...] "I lived through my mistakes, it's {{just a part of}} growing," [...] before it [...] "segways into a legit bop." [...] Its pre-chorus is [...] "full of rich harmonies that give a retro—dare we say Jackson 5—vibe," [...] noted Fuse Mark Sundstrom. Towards the end, as described by Music Times' Carolyn Menyes, [...] "with a knowing wink, Jackson gives a spoken outro against some finger snaps. 'Hello.

I hope you enjoy,' she says, directly addressing the listeners who have waited so long for a taste of new Jackson music." [...] Lyrically, [...] "Unbreakable" [...] is a dedication to her fans, with Janet expressing thankfulness and praising her loyal fan base and a lover, with lines like, [...] "Never for a single moment did I ever go without your love" [...] and [...] "You made me feel wanted, and I want to tell you how important you are to me." [...] Lewis, one of its producers, commented about its lyrical content, saying, [...] "Some people think of unbreakable as being hard, but I think unbreakable is just being able to be vulnerable {{and to be able to}} withstand what comes to you.

It's hard for <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of people <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about emotions that are really deep pain and hurt and shit like that. [...] "Them Bones" [...] is pretty cut and dried. It's a little sarcastic, but it's pretty much about dealing with your mortality and life. Everybody's going to die someday. Instead of being afraid of it, that's the way it is: so enjoy the time you've got. Live as much as you can, have as much fun as possible. Face your fear and live. I had family members die at a fairly early age; so I've always had kind of a phobia about it. Death freaks me out. I think it freaks <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of people out. It's the end of life, depending on your views. It's a pretty scary thing. [...] "Them Bones" [...] is trying to put that thought to rest. Use what you have left, and use it well.|$|R
30|$|In addition, {{using new}} {{expressions}} and words is another linguistic factor which appeared progressive for low-anxious students and debilitating for the highly anxious ones. The teacher or peers’ negative judgment {{can be one}} of the affective factors which may heighten learners’ anxiety. Thus, having good relations with other students in the class mitigates negative judgments and contributes to decreasing learners’ anxiety. Besides, pedagogical contextual factors and tools used for learning affect learners’ anxiety. Teachers’ negative reaction to the learners’ mistakes make them feel embarrassed that they prefer not <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> in the class. The level of learners’ self-confidence influences their level of anxiety since learners with low self-confidence feel anxious <b>to</b> <b>talk.</b> In contrast, confident learners are eager to speak and they learn from their mistakes. EFL learners’ anxiety might be impressed by their self-perception of their English language. Besides, the background knowledge of students, and lack of topical knowledge affected their anxiety as familiarity with the topics of conversations decreases their anxiety. At the time of speaking, they have <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of ideas <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about in their mind in their native languages, but they have no idea how to put them; thus, they abstain <b>to</b> <b>talk.</b> This study suggested that cognitive, linguistic, and affective factors are important in the moment-by-moment rise and fall of learners’ anxiety.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to gain and create {{understanding}} on how preschool teachers and preschool directors create conditions for inclusion and how preschool teachers work to include all the preschool children. To achieve this, the aim has been divided into three research questions. The questions examine how preschool teachers and preschool directors’ describe the organisation to include all children, here called the arena of formulation, and how the preschool teachers actually work for inclusion on an individual- and group level, here called the arena of implementation. Finally we make a comparison between the two arenas. We have worked with a qualitative approach which made it possible for us to gain understanding about the chosen topic. The methods that have been carried out at the two preschools in order to get some answers to the posed questions and ultimately reach our purpose for this research have been observations and focus group interviews. The results have been interpreted with a theoretical point of view, the sociocultural perspective. The result in this study is that the arena of implementation and the arena of formulation are alike in many aspects although there are also a few differences. On one of the preschools the teachers talked <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> about having “open doors” which meant that the children were free to be wherever they wanted. This was, however, nothing that could be seen during the observations that were made.

Lewis was a good bloke for most of the time, but he's always been involved in something a little bit dodgy. Where can he go from here except to reform and mend his ways? I think we've all seen that before, so for me it was better to do something totally unexpected and challenging, rather than just fade away". Hull added that the scenes were a [...] "nightmare" [...] to film especially the character's final scene which was [...] "really tough". Hull felt that the storyline was done responsibly as it [...] "shows the reality of suicide and there are helpline numbers {{at the end of the}} programme.
