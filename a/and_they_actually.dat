25|$|Angelo Correr had promised, {{when he was}} a {{cardinal}} in the Conclave of November 1406, along with all the other cardinals who signed the Electoral Capitulations, that, if elected Pope, he would not create new cardinals except to keep the college of the Roman Obedience {{on a par with the}} Avignon Obedience. When he was elected Gregory XII, he signed and ratified those capitulations. But in May 1408, without need, he insisted on creating four new cardinals, two of whom were his nephews. The current cardinals objected loudly, citing the Electoral Capitulations, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>actually</b> refused to attend the Consistory to elevate the four new cardinals. On May 11 one of the cardinals, Jean Gilles, left Lucca, where Pope Gregory was staying at the time, and withdrew to Pisa. The Pope's nephew Paolo Correr (Corrario) was sent with troops to fetch him back by force. The papal action was so shocking that seven more cardinals deserted the same evening, and another who had just arrived in Lucca followed along without delay. On 29 June 1408, thirteen cardinals (who held the proxies of two additional cardinals) met in the port city of Livorno, where they prepared a manifesto which looked toward the holding of a general council to bring the schism to an end. Four more cardinals joined in the agreement in writing on 30 August, another on 14 September, another on 5 October, and yet another on 11 October.|$|E

White criticised the new layout's negative effect on gameplay and the poor enemy AI, and Kasavin called the experience [...] "frustrating, difficult, and tedious", though stating that such moments stood out because many areas of the game were [...] "thrilling". Reed found the controls dated and the stealth mechanics and strength upgrade system unnecessary, while the GamesRadar reviewer cited both the gameplay and control layout as dated, citing the difficulty of effectively controlling Lara at multiple points in the game because of these issues. The camera was also criticised, with White, Perry, Reed, Kasavin and the GamesRadar reviewer all citing it as awkward to control and sometimes wayward or confusing during its scripted movements.|$|E
500|$|Believing {{that the}} ridge {{was held by}} two understrength {{companies}} from the Japanese 81st Infantry Regiment—approximately 80–90 men—who had withdrawn there after the fighting on Little George and Artillery Hill, the Australians decided to commit only a battalion to capture it. On the morning of 30 December, after 40 minutes of airstrikes from Royal New Zealand Air Force Corsairs, who had been [...] guided onto their targets by RAAF Boomerangs, the roughly 800-strong 25th Battalion carried out an attack supported by artillery and machine gun fire with four companies advancing across a [...] frontage stretching across the ridge. Unbeknown to the Australians, however, the two companies from the 81st Infantry Regiment had been reinforced by men from the Japanese 38th Independent Mixed Brigade under Major General Kesao Kijima <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>actually</b> numbered 550. They had heavily fortified the ridge, establishing a series of bunkers and pillboxes between weapons pits that were linked with trenches. However, due to the steep terrain, they were only able to move three mortars onto the position, {{and there were no}} other heavy weapons. They were also unable to haul bulk water to the position, and had to rely on constant resupply by foot.|$|E

He streamed the show live and the stream cut out from Breeze-Woods, which {{caused him to}} miss that match {{and half of the}} main event. Technical issues aside, Oster felt that Arrival [...] "was a phenomenal show that gave the WWE a chance to show off the NXT roster". He also stated that all three promoted matches met or exceeded his expectations. Cesaro and Zayn's match [...] "wasn't the same as their previous encounters, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>actually</b> built on it" [...] and that [...] "they actually told the story that they knew each other well in the ring, and used it to put on a fantastic 20-minute match". Oster gave high praise to the women's match, he thought it [...] "was better than nearly all of the Divas matches on the main roster for the past few years, featuring some strong chain wrestling and submission moves." [...] He also noted that Emma's sitout powerbomb sparked the crowd to chant [...] "Better than Batista". For the main event, Oster felt that there were [...] "some interesting spots with some good storytelling, even if there weren't the typical brutal spots associated with a ladder match", so it was not [...] "overly special" [...] but still [...] "pretty good". Lastly, Oster praised the announcers, who [...] "worked perfectly together in a traditional sports style, which truly added to the broadcast. WWE should really consider going back to this format for the main shows".|$|E
