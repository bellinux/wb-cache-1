25|$|The {{show was}} unique {{for its use}} of the Vietnam War. Before All My Children debuted, no show had {{discussed}} the war in any depth. There were traditional Phoebe and free-spirited Amy both butting heads over the war, with Amy often leading protests around Pine Valley. When Amy left, Ruth takes over as the anti-war voice and protests <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> the early 1970s. The character's protest speech in 1972 won Mary Fickett the first Emmy Award given to a soap opera performer. Later in the show's run, Phoebe softened.|$|E

Morse made two more bids for reelection to the Senate {{before his death in}} 1974.|$|E

25|$|During the war, his {{opinions}} in military matters {{were in the}} antipodes of his cousin Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich, who was {{commander in chief of}} the Russian armies between 1914 and 1915. Nicholas Mikhailovich disliked his cousin from their youth when they were rivals in their military careers. He was a pacifist and was <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> a time of uppermost patriotism. He criticized his cousin's strategy and tactics, particularly the sacrificing of the Imperial guard and a large part of the regular army in the ill-fated advance on East Prussia. He foresaw that Russia would not win the war with only half-trained reservists and draftees.|$|E

About 1,000 people {{in place for the}} third major march, and the last to be sanctioned, were stopped on Thursday, September 4, 2008, by police because they attempted to begin their march after the time their march permit expired.
