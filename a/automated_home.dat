40|$|Abstract — Home {{security}} {{has been a}} major issue w here crime is increasing and everybody wants to take proper measures to prevent intrusion. In addition {{there is a need to}} <b>automate</b> <b>home</b> so that user can take advantage of the technological advancement in suc h a way that a person getting off his home does not need to think of his home security again and again. It is therefore the purpose of this invention to provide a security device, which gives immediate notification to the ow ner and security services like police station or fire brigade at the moment the unauthorized event occurs. This purpose is accomplished via use of some modules and a controller which activates a GSM (Global System for Mobile) module to send one or more SMS (Short Message Service) to the owner and corresponding security services at the time of break in. This system is low cost as it does not contain expensive sensors to detect emergencies and it is also easy to implement as the security modules w ill take very low space for installation...|$|R

40|$|Rationale and objectives: Adjuvant {{chemotherapy}} {{is associated}} with changes in cognition in a subgroup of cancer patients. Chemotherapy is generally given as a combination of cytotoxic agents, which {{makes it hard to}} define the agent responsible for these observed changes. Literature on animal experiments has been difficult to interpret due to variance in experimental setup. Methods: We examined the effects of cytotoxic agents administered separately on various cognitive measures in a standardized animal model. Male C 57 Bl/ 6 mice received cyclophosphamide, docetaxel, doxorubicin, 5 -fluorouracil, methotrexate, or topotecan. These agents represent different compound classes based on their working mechanism and are frequently prescribed in the clinic. A control group received saline. Behavioral testing started 2 or 15 weeks after treatment and included testing general measures of behavior and cognitive task performance: spontaneous behavior in an <b>automated</b> <b>home</b> cage, open field, novel location recognition (NLR), novel object recognition (NOR), Barnes maze, contextual fear conditioning, and a simple choice reaction time task (SCRTT). Results: Cyclophosphamide, docetaxel, and doxorubicin administration affected spontaneous activity in the <b>automated</b> <b>home</b> cage. All cytotoxic agents affected memory (NLR and/or NOR). Spatial memory measured in the Barnes maze was affected after administration with doxorubicin, 5 -fluorouracil, and topotecan. Decreased inhibition in the SCRTT was observed after treatment with cyclophosphamide, docetaxel, and topotecan. Conclusions: Our data show that, in mice, a single treatment with a cytotoxic agent causes cognitive impairment. Not all cytotoxic agents affected the same cognitive domains, which might be explained by differences in working mechanisms of the various agents...|$|E

40|$|Ubicomp {{applications}} increasingly involve smart phones {{that control}} or communicate with embedded systems.

Amarino is a toolkit that enables the rapid prototyping of such applications by connecting the Android operating system to the Arduino microcontroller platform. It consists of an Android application, an Arduino library, and a collection of documentation and examples. This suite of tools allows users to: 1) access Android events (ie: compass orientation, accelerometer data, and text messages received) and send them to Arduino microcontrollers without doing any Android programming, and 2) quickly develop Android applications that receive data (ie: environmental sensor data) from (and send data to) Arduino microcontrollers.

40|$|We report our {{retrospective}} analysis of 16 uraemic {{patients who were}} treated with <b>home</b> <b>automated</b> intermittent peritoneal dialysis (IPD) from 1988 to 1993. Six patients were diabetic. The mean age was 58. 5 years. The reasons for <b>home</b> <b>automated</b> IPD were: old age, poor eyesight, low intelligence or poor dexterity, family or patient request and old stroke. It took an average of 8. 8 sessions to train the helper. The mean frequency of the home IPD was once every 5. 8 days with a mean volume of 48 litres of dialysate used during each dialysis. There were 3 peritonitis episodes making the peritonitis rate once every 93 patient months. Four patients were still on home IPD and two were transplanted. Ten patients died of stroke, myocardial infarction, tuberculosis, chronic obstructive lung disease or suicide. A low plasma albumin is the only significant parameter in the early mortality group. Such high mortality can {{be accounted for by}} the fact that patients were older and forty per cent were diabetic.
