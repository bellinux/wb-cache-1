The disease has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestation and can affect a variety of organs and systems. This study focused on blood culture of serologic diagnosed brucellosis and <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>susceptibility</b> <b>test.</b> Materials and methods: In this cross sectional study, microbiologic survey was done on a total of 30 serum samples with STA titer of 1 : 160 or greater and 2 ME titer of 1 : 40 or greater, which were presumptive for brucellosis. Blood cultures were done by lysis centrifugation and <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>susceptibility</b> <b>test,</b> against 9 <b>antimicrobial</b> agents by disk method. The data was analyzed by stata V 8. 0 software. Results: At the end this study, the blood culture isolation rate was 23. 3 %(7 cases out of 30 patients) and all of the isolates were brucella melitensis. <b>Antimicrobial</b> <b>susceptibility</b> <b>tests</b> showed high in vitro activity of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and doxycycline and also, low in vitro activity of streptomycin and cotrimoxazole.
