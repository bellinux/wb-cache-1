5|$|Marie died on 18 July 1938, at 5:38p.m., {{eight minutes}} after lapsing into a coma. Her two eldest children, Carol and Elisabeth, {{accompanied}} by Prince Michael, were at her deathbed. Two days later, on 20 July, Marie's body {{was brought to}} Bucharest, where she lay in state in the white drawing room at Cotroceni Palace. Her coffin was surrounded by flowers <b>and</b> <b>glowing</b> tapers and was guarded by officers of the Fourth Hussars. Thousands of people filed by Marie's bier during the three-day lying in state and, on the third day, the palace was opened for factory workers. Marie's funeral cortege {{made its way to}} the train station, passing under the Arch of Triumph. Her coffin was taken to Curtea de Argeș Monastery, where she was interred. Marie's heart, according to her own wishes, was placed in a small golden casket embellished with the emblems of the Romanian provinces and interred in her Stella Maris chapel in Balchik. In 1940, after Southern Dobrudja was ceded to Bulgaria during World War II, her heart was transferred to Bran Castle. There, Ileana built a chapel to house the heart, kept in two nested boxes placed inside a marble sarcophagus.|$|E
5|$|Alucard {{appears in}} , {{a chapter of}} the Lords of Shadow reboot series. It is {{revealed}} that this version of Alucard was originally Trevor Belmont, the son of Gabriel and Marie Belmont, conceived before Gabriel {{was turned into a}} vampire and became the dark lord Dracula. Trevor grew up not knowing of his true origin until the Brotherhood of Light reveals to him who his parents were. Believing that his father Gabriel murdered his mother in cold blood, he decides to pursue him in the hopes of destroying him and bringing peace to the land. After infiltrating the castle, Trevor successfully fights his way to the throne room, where he confronts Dracula without letting on that he is his son, or telling Dracula his name. Although Trevor puts up a valiant effort, in the end he is defeated and stabbed in the heart with his own Combat Cross. Dying and gazing at the Mirror of Fate he finally realizes the truth of what really happened to Gabriel and feels sorry for him, calling him his father. Dracula, confused, gazes at the mirror as well and learns who Trevor was all along. Remorseful and horrified for killing his own son who had been unknown to him the entire time, Dracula desperately tries to bring him back to life by giving him his blood, which seems to be in vain. Dracula mourns over his loss, and places Trevor in a coffin with the name Alucard, since he never learned his son's real name. Many years later Alucard awakens, with pale white skin, white hair, <b>and</b> <b>glowing</b> orange eyes. He meets up with Dracula and his own son, Simon. Alucard tries to finish what he started, angry that his father turned him into a vampire. Dracula asks Alucard to join him in remaking the world and destroying the brotherhood, but Alucard refuses. Dracula proceeds to attack Simon for being a Belmont, wishing to end the Belmont bloodline due to his hatred of his past life. Alucard and Simon manage to defeat Dracula, and part ways as Dracula's castle crumbles.|$|E

He also claimed that his findings supported the World Ice Theory, which claimed that the universe originated from a cataclysmic clash between gigantic balls of ice <b>and</b> <b>glowing</b> mass.

Wesker says some of his lines from the game as well, and the fight between Wesker and Chris and Claire Redfield in the film is an almost shot-for-shot remake of a fight between Wesker and Chris and Sheva in Resident Evil 5.|$|E
25|$|Goa'uld symbiotes are {{serpentine}} lifeforms {{with four}} jaws <b>and</b> <b>glowing</b> yellow eyes. Originally aquatic, mature Goa'uld symbiotes have extensive fins and are powerful swimmers, {{with the ability}} to launch themselves from the water towards prospective hosts. A Goa'uld can burrow into their host through the back of the mouth or the neck, though they prefer the latter because they wish to avoid remembering the look of horror on the host's face. They then enter the brain, take control of the body, and gain total access to the host's memories; thus, the Goa'uld often use symbiote implantation as a means of interrogation that also provides a useful future spy.|$|E

Rafael traveled with a crew from a Malaysian junk, bringing back profitable trade items <b>and</b> <b>glowing</b> reports about China's commercial potential.

He introduced a number of progressions to painting in Cologne, especially by filling his backgrounds and landscapes with specific and elaborate details, and by rendering his figures with more bulk and volume. Wellesz described his paintings as evidencing an [...] "intensity of feeling which gives a very special and very moving quality to his work. His devotion is reflected in his figures: it charges with symbolic meaning the smallest details of his paintings; and, in a hidden, almost magical way, it speaks from the concord of his pure <b>and</b> <b>glowing</b> colours." ...|$|E

A member of the alien Chiss species, Thrawn is described as a tall, solidly built humanoid with blue skin <b>and</b> <b>glowing</b> red eyes who wears the white uniform befitting his rank.

500|$|The game's visuals and {{atmosphere}} received similar praise. GameSpot reviewer Kevin VanOrd remarked that Mass Effect 2 is more detailed and darker than its predecessor. He wrote that [...] "deep reds <b>and</b> <b>glowing</b> indigos saturate certain scenes, making them {{richer and more}} sinister; eerie fog limits your vision in one side mission, while rain pours down upon you in another. Subtle, moody lighting gives certain interactions great impact." [...] Reviewer Adriaan den Ouden of RPGamer credited the conversations and cutscenes for being better shot than the first game, stating that [...] "it's hard to imagine them becoming much better in Mass Effect 3". Critics also gave high marks to the game's extensive cast of voices, in particular Martin Sheen's performance of the Illusive Man, which was singled out for [...] "steal the show". Andrew Reiner, writing for Game Informer, opined that the music [...] "flows beautifully" [...] in both the story and action sequences. The game's presentation and direction were considered [...] "miles ahead of the competition".|$|E

According to Taylor, this new track, a joyful ode to holding the faith but {{allowing}} love {{to take its}} course when it's ready, matches Dion with a new team of collaborators, consistent hitmakers: Max Martin, Kristian Lundin and Andreas Carlsson. [...] "Replete with a festive mandolin and a midtempo beat to bring new heights to her as-ever splendid vocal," [...] this song is [...] "destined to enrapture" [...] top forty and AC the first time through, at last stripping away mainstream radio's gripe that Dion is [...] "too adult". He said that, youthful and yet elegant, <b>and</b> <b>glowing</b> brightly with warmth, the song also represents a bold step forward for Martin, who is best known [...] for his work with chart-topping youth acts.

For the visuals in the anime, ANN made note of the fight between Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha in episodes 132–134, noting the [...] "impressiveness of the Sasuke fight's visuals", in which [...] "Naruto clones explode from a lake like ninja-shaped surface-to-air missiles <b>and</b> <b>glowing</b> energy limbs ambush enemies from underground and cling to rock faces like neon prehensile tails". Although ANN praised the animators who [...] "put all the love they could into the fight", it criticized the slow plot pacing that led up to the fight, and the fight's tedious structure.|$|E

[...] Liz Guiver, the former vicar's secretary and administrator, revealed that many of the church's parishioners were excited at the prospect of seeing the actors on set. Speaking to Guy Blackman from The Age, Guiver recalled [...] "The person who played the vicar, and wore the vicar's robe, he smoked cigarettes, so we had to be careful that they were dry-cleaned before services on Sunday. Then we waited for months until the episode was aired, and most parishioners were glued to the set." [...] Scenes featuring the character's family homes and Ramsay Street were shot at the show's studio in Forest Hill and at Pin Oak Court in Vermont South respectively.

500|$|The Times {{later wrote}} of Barbirolli's first actions for the orchestra: [...] "In {{a couple of}} months of endless auditions, he rebuilt the Hallé, {{accepting}} any good player, whatever his musical background – he found himself with a schoolboy first flute, a schoolmistress hornist, and various brass players recruited from brass and military bands in the Manchester area... The reborn Hallé's first concert somehow lived up to the Hallé's great reputation." [...] The Musical Times also noted, [...] "From his earliest days with the orchestra it was the string tone that commanded immediate attention and respect. There was a fiery intensity <b>and</b> <b>glowing</b> warmth that proclaimed the born string coach". Barbirolli retained his reputation for training orchestras: after his death, one of his former players commented, [...] "If you wanted orchestral experience you'd be set for life, starting in the Hallé with John Barbirolli." [...] Further afield, critics, audiences and players in Europe and the United States commented on the improvement in the playing of their orchestras when Barbirolli was in charge. Later he extended his teaching skills to the Royal Academy of Music, where he took charge of the student orchestra from 1961.|$|E
