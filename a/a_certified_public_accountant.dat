500|$|In 1887, the American Association of Public Accountants (AAPA) was created; it was {{the first}} step in {{developing}} professionalism in the United States accounting industry. By 1905, the AAPA's first ethical codes were formulated to educate its members. During its twentieth anniversary meeting in October 1907, ethics was a major topic of the conference among its members. As a result of discussions, a list of professional ethics was incorporated into the organization's bylaws. However, because membership to the organization was voluntary, the association could not require individuals to conform to the suggested behaviors. Other accounting organizations, such as the Illinois Institute of Accountants, also pursued discussion on the importance of ethics for the field. The AAPA was renamed several times throughout its history, before becoming the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) as it's named today. The AICPA developed five divisions of ethical principles that its members should follow: [...] "independence, integrity, and objectivity"; [...] "competence and technical standards"; [...] "responsibilities to clients"; [...] "responsibilities to colleagues"; as well as [...] "other responsibilities and practices". Each of these divisions provided guidelines on how <b>a</b> <b>Certified</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Accountant</b> (CPA) should act as a professional. Failure to comply with the guidelines could have caused an accountant to be barred from practicing. When developing the ethical principles, the AICPA also considered how the profession would be viewed by those outside of the accounting industry.|$|E
