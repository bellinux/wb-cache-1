I hypothesized that (a) <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> from Lake Michigan move into DRM lakes during autumn but do not spawn, (b) <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> from DRM lakes differ genetically from nearshore Lake Michigan and do not form a panmictic population, and (c) DRM lakes will exhibit genetic isolation by distance. Overall, <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> exhibited low genetic diversity. The southern DRM lakes (i. e., Muskegon, White, and Pentwater lakes) were genetically similar to each other.

40|$|<b>Yellow</b> <b>perch</b> (Perca flavescens) {{constitute}} {{populations of}} economic and ecological importance throughout the Laurentian Great Lakes Region, but these populations are often subject to substantial recruitment variability. In Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron, annual monitoring indicates that during recent years age- 0 <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> experienced relatively high survival during early life. The collapse of the Lake Huron alewife population {{may have contributed to}} this phenomenon by leading to reduced larval <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> mortality in Saginaw Bay. However, recent high age- 0 <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> production has been accompanied by reduced sizes of young perch (perhaps due to increased intraspecific competition) and low recruitment to adult stages. Low sampling frequency (i. e. once per year) has previously limited a rigorous evaluation of the mechanisms underlying poor perch recruitment in Saginaw Bay. Additionally, the extent to which other recent changes in the Saginaw Bay ecosystem have influenced <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> foraging, growth, and subsequent survival remained unstudied. ^ With the goal of understanding early-life dynamics of <b>yellow</b> <b>perch,</b> we conducted frequent sampling and tracked growth, consumption, and condition of two <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> cohorts from larval stages through the first year of life. Additionally, we examined variation in age- 0 <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> diet patterns and related foraging strategies of age- 0 <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> to environmental variables. Mortality of young <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> is closely tied to growth: we observed consistent size-selective predation by the primary piscivores in Saginaw Bay (walleye, Sander vitreus), and we found significant increases in length and decreases in total energy content of young <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> following the first winter of life. Growth in length, mass, and total energy all slowed during late summer and early fall for both cohorts of age- 0 <b>yellow</b> <b>perch,</b> prior to drastic reductions in temperature. Age- 0 <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> consumed primarily zooplankton, and variation in diet variables across sites was greater than variation over time or ontogeny. Additionally, among-individual specialization was occasionally an important component of population foraging niches. After accounting for densities of available prey, diet selectivity indices were highest for Daphnia spp. and Chironomidae larvae. Furthermore, foraging patterns by young <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> appeared to respond to ambient densities of Daphnia spp., Chironomidae larvae, and Dreissena spp. Mussels; the latter of which was correlated with reduced consumption of benthic prey items.

We evaluated the potential for bottom hypoxia to affect the growth rates of <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> Perca flavescens, a species of ecological and economic importance in the lake. To this end, we (1) conducted laboratory experiments to quantify the effects of reduced dissolved oxygen on consumption, somatic growth, and RNA: DNA ratios (an index of short-term growth) of young <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> and (2) explored the effects of bottom hypoxia on young <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> growth in Lake Erie's central basin by collecting individuals in hypoxic and normoxic regions of the lake and quantifying their RNA: DNA ratios. <b>Yellow</b> <b>perch</b> consumption and growth in our experiments declined under hypoxic conditions (<= 2 mg O- 2 /L).

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the interaction between}} brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> (Perca flavescens). The goal of the thesis was to {{add to our understanding}} of the food web dynamics of intraguild predation in fish communities through an exploration of the trophic ecology of brook trout. Results suggest brook trout and <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> interact as intraguild predator and prey [...] -juvenile brook trout and <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> compete for shared resources and adult brook trout prey on <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> [...] -and that the outcome of the interaction is dependant upon <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> abundance and ecosystem size. In the presence of <b>yellow</b> <b>perch,</b> juvenile brook trout exhibited an ontogenetic diet shift to a high reliance on pelagic-linked prey unlike populations from non-perch lakes which maintained a strong link to littoral energetic pathways throughout ontogeny. Brook trout shifted to piscivory at a length of 25 cm and <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> became the dominant prey item. Brook trout abundance was approximately 75 % lower in lakes containing <b>yellow</b> <b>perch,</b> suggesting differences in brook trout trophic ecology had population level effects. Removal of greater than 70 % of <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> biomass from a 35 ha lake resulted in improved juvenile brook trout growth and condition. The availability of zooplankton and zoobenthos increased and brook trout 20 to 30 cm in length increased their consumption of littoral-linked prey. Piscivorous brook trout continued to prey primarily on <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> despite the significant reduction in perch density and brook trout trophic position was unchanged. These results suggest reduced perch biomass may lead to increased recruitment of piscivorous brook trout and shift the interaction between the two species toward dominance by brook trout. Based on a historical study of brook trout diet using archived scale samples, the presence of lake trout, a second predator on <b>yellow</b> <b>perch,</b> was shown to have no effect on the resource use of brook trout, suggesting top-down control of <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> populations does not occur in these systems. On the other hand, ecosystem size was shown to alter the outcome of the interaction between brook trout and <b>yellow</b> <b>perch.</b> In lakes with surface area greater than 100 ha, book trout were strongly linked to littoral energetic pathways despite the presence of <b>yellow</b> <b>perch,</b> indicating the two species were able to partition the littoral niche in large lakes. It is hypothesized that the increased proportion of non-depositional benthic habitat in large lakes results in a greater availability of large zoobenthos thereby reducing the effect of resource competition with <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> on brook trout growth and abundance. Consistent with theoretical predictions of the effect of enrichment on intraguild predation interactions, adult brook trout exhibited greater omnivory in large lakes as evidenced by lower trophic position relative to populations from small lakes. Further investigation of intraguild predation between brook trout and <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> may add to our understanding of how shifts in trophic linkages between littoral and pelagic energetic pathways affect fish community dynamics and provide further insight into the ontogeny of piscivory in freshwater salmonids and the dynamics of size-structured interactions...|$|R
40|$|A {{computer}} simulation model {{was developed to}} examine the effects of various levels of alewife densities, harvest, and bycatch rates on <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> Perca flavescens relative densities in Indiana waters of Lake Michigan. The model utilized STELLA® Research software to develop the age-structured population model to include measured or predicted biological characteristics of density-dependent growth, recruitment, and mortality. The model was validated by simulating historically documented <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> catch per unit effort (CPUE) from 1984 - 1998. A strong linear relationship (R 2 = 0. 70) between the model predicted CPUE values and the actual CPUE values was found. Twenty year model projections were performed using 1998 <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> trawl CPUE as starting values. Alewife abundance was established as either constantly high, constantly low, or allowed to fluctuate randomly and forecasts made used the average of 100 runs. Harvest was imposed on the <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> population at 20, 40, and 60 % rate levels for fish >_ 200 mm coupled with bycatch at 20, 40 and 60 % rate levels for fish ranging from 165 - 200 mm. Alewife abundance was the major factor determining the relative abundance of the <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> population. On average, constantly high alewife abundance with no harvest or bycatch resulted in projected continuing suppression of <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> abundance from 1998 levels. The model predicted the population to rebound using constant low and random alewife abundance with no harvest or bycatch to approximately 1, 100 fish/h and 700 fish/h, respectively. The model revealed harvest to have a generally negative impact on the <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> population.

High estimates show that cormorants were capable of consuming 29% of the age three <b>perch</b> population. <b>Yellow</b> <b>perch</b> have such an extensive impact on trout species in the bodies of water {{in which they were}} introduced and established, they caused a drastic change in the food habits and reduced the growth rates of the trout by more than 50% in some locations. Trout in lakes where perch have been introduced typically cannot compete successfully for the available food, and once <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> get established in small lakes, even intervention by the use of trout hatcheries {{has been shown to be}} ineffective. In Canada, <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> are effective at escaping predation by lake trout and other native fishes during summer due to their high thermal tolerance. Parasites and diseases in <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> are often shared with salmonids in eastern North American lakes. A few examples are: brain parasite Flavobacterium columnare, red worm Eustrongylides tubifex, broad tapeworm Diphyllobothrium latum, and parasitic copepods Ergasilus spp.|$|R
40|$|Hypoxia (< 2 mg O 2 •L- 1) is a {{widespread}} phenomenon in marine and freshwater systems worldwide, yet the ecological consequences of hypoxia are generally unknown, especially for mobile species such as fish. Areas of hypoxic conditions or “dead zones”, due primarily to eutrophication (i. e. nutrient enrichment), are viewed as {{a major threat to}} aquatic ecosystem function worldwide. Areas of bottom water (hypolimnetic) hypoxia have long been documented and are increasing in the Lake Erie ecosystem, an economically and ecologically important water body within the Laurentian Great Lakes. Quantifying the ecological consequences of hypoxia for highly mobile organisms (e. g., <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> Perca flavescens) is a complex task. Such organisms are capable of avoiding direct lethal effects of hypolimnetic hypoxia, but may be indirectly affected as they are forced to occupy inferior habitats (i. e., novel prey, predators, competitors and physical conditions). I used field, and laboratory techniques to address the overall hypothesis that hypolimnetic hypoxia in Lake Erie negatively affects <b>yellow</b> <b>perch.</b> Laboratory results suggest <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> growth and consumption are negatively affected by low oxygen conditions. However, my field results suggest <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> attempt to mitigate these potential consequences by altering their distribution and foraging patterns in the presence of hypoxic conditions. My results also suggest a change in the sub-daily behaviors of <b>yellow</b> <b>perch.</b> This behavioral change involves short-term forays to forage within hypoxic habitats. The largest consequence of hypoxia for <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> in LECB is altered distribution patterns due to vertical or horizontal migrations in avoidance of low oxygen conditions. Overall, it appears hypoxia has the potential to negatively affect <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> however, behavioral modifications allow <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> to mitigate the extent of these consequences in Lake Erie. These results will have management implications for Lake Erie resource agencies and provide important conclusions concerning the ecological consequences of hypoxia for freshwater fishes...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Yellow</b> <b>perch</b> {{is often}} {{recognized}} by its dark vertical stripes and gold or yellow body color. Perca {{is derived from}} early Greek for [...] "perch" [...] and flavescens is Latin for [...] "becoming gold" [...] or [...] "yellow colored". Adult sizes typically range from 3.9-11.4 in (10-30 cm); though {{have been known to}} grow larger. The <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> has a laterally compressed body with an oval, oblong shape. The anal fins are a green or yellow-orange, the dorsal fin is an olive color, and the belly is cream-colored. The vertical bands fade as they near the belly. Spawning intensifies the bands in males, and they can be nonexistent in juveniles. The spiny anterior dorsal fin has 13 to 15 spines. The soft rear fins also have one or two spines, but which are mostly made up of rays that range from 12 to 15 in number. The pelvic fins are close together, and the homocercal caudal fin is forked. The operculum tip has one spine, and the anal fin has two spines. There are seven to eight branchiostegal rays. <b>Yellow</b> <b>perch</b> has many fine and sharp teeth. They are rough to the touch because of their ctenoid scales. Common names for the <b>perch</b> are <b>yellow</b> <b>perch,</b> <b>American</b> perch, and lake <b>perch.</b> <b>Yellow</b> <b>perch</b> are one of the smaller-sized members of the perch family (Percidae). Due to its ability to crossbreed and the similar morphology, the <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> is sometimes classified as a subspecies of the European perch.For over 100 years, Canada and the United States have been commercially harvesting <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> in the Great Lakes with trapnets, gillnets, and poundnets. In Canada, the estimated catch in 2002 was 3,622 tons with a value of $16.7 million, second only to walleye at $28.2 million. The greatest demand in the United States is in the north-central region, where nearly 70% of all <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> sales in the US occur within 80 km (49.7 mi) of the Great Lakes. <b>Yellow</b> <b>perch</b> is one of the easiest fish to catch, and can be taken in all seasons, and tastes great. Therefore, it is a desirable sport fish in some locations of the US and Canada. It even makes up around 85% of the sport fish caught in Lake Michigan.|$|R
40|$|The western {{basin of}} Lake Erie {{receives}} input from two main tributaries (Maumee and Detroit River), which differ greatly in their nutrient and sediment loading. The higher turbidity of the Maumee River plume {{is thought to}} reduce predation on early-stage juvenile <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> (Perca flavescens), consequently increasing their survival. For this reason, my overall objective was to evaluate {{the effect of the}} Maumee River plume on the overall recruitment of larval <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> to the juvenile stage. However, traditional diet analyses are not effective for evaluating larval predation rates. I therefore review genetic and non-genetic diet analysis techniques, and how they have evolved with technological advances, allowing researchers to effectively explore trophic interactions and energy movement in aquatic ecosystems. This provided a framework for my doctoral research for which I used a variety of molecular genetic techniques to estimate survival of larval <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> using population genetics and predation rates through stomach content analysis of predator fish. Using <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> microsatellite markers, I measured temporal and spatial genetic structure in larval <b>yellow</b> <b>perch,</b> while Bayesian genotype assignment provided relative larval survival estimates for <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> inhabiting the Maumee and Detroit River plumes. Overall, genotype assignment of Age- 0 <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> establishes that, in the western basin of Lake Erie, larval recruitment to the juvenile stage is significantly higher for fish inhabiting the Maumee River plume relative to those in the Detroit River plume. In addition, I utilized molecular genetic techniques to accurately identify highly digested early-stage juvenile prey to the species level which was not possible with a more traditional approach (visual inspection of gut contents). Specifically, I use polymerase chain reaction (PCR), cloning and sequencing, to demonstrate the diversity of prey consumed by several freshwater fish species. Finally, using species-specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assays and microsatellite markers, I quantified predation and cannibalism experienced by larval <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> in the Maumee and Detroit river plumes. The combination of markers showed generally higher predation and cannibalism in the less turbid waters of the Detroit River plume, indicative of river-plume effects (possibly mediated through turbidity) reducing larval <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> predation mortality. My doctoral research shows the likely mechanism that river plumes in the western basin of Lake Erie contribute to larval <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> survival and consequently potential recruitment; however, temporal and spatial variability indicate that other factors also contribute...|$|R

40|$|<b>Yellow</b> <b>perch</b> (Perca flavescens) are a {{non-native}} {{species in}} most areas of British Columbia (BC) and could impact those ecosystems where they are introduced. To address this, I investigated seasonal diet composition and basic movement of introduced <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> in lakes within the Okanagan Region of British Columbia. In addition, a trial {{of the use of}} artificial spawning substrates as a potential method of removing eggs was completed. Diet composition was determined during five seasonal sampling periods, by counting and identifying items within perch stomachs. I compared diet composition among lakes, and among seasons and size classes within each lake using a multivariate analysis. Diet composition of <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> varied by lake. Most notably, <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> diets did not include juvenile fishes in several lakes, but the fish consumed large proportions of zooplankton. It is possible that diet composition of introduced <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> could be predicted based on presence or absence of predators and refugia for prey species. Prey selectivity and diet overlap with rainbow trout was also determined. Prey selectivity of perch varied among study lakes and seasons. Significant diet overlap between <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> and rainbow trout occurred in one of two lakes tested, likely lake-specific due to variable strains of rainbow trout stocked. Radio telemetry showed that in summer, <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> were found relatively close to shore, with no significant difference found among time periods within a 24 -hour tracking session. In spring, <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> were significantly farther from shore when ice was covering the lake, and moved closer to shore as the ice receded. This coincided with the beginning of the spawning season at temperatures of 3. 8 °C, the lowest end of the known spawning temperature range. Trials using artificial spawning substrates were successful. Perch spawned multiple times on all artificial spawning substrates and eggs were removed from the lake in an attempt to reduce spawning success. Overall, <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> displayed the expected characteristics of a generalist species across all study lakes, as would be expected in their native range; however, some specialization within specific lakes was observed.

40|$|We {{explored}} {{differences among}} four well-known indices (%W, %O, %N, and %IRI), plus a modified %IRI (%MIRI), examined diet and consumption dynamics of black crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus), largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), northern pike (Esox lucius), smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieui), walleye (Stizostedion vitreum), and <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> (Perca flavescens) in Spirit Lake, Iowa, in 1995 [...] 1997. %W and %MIRI emphasizes importance of large prey taxa, even when relatively rare in diets, whereas %O and %N emphasize small prey common in diets. %IRI yielded intermediate results. Using %IRI, {{we found that}} the most important prey taxa overall were <b>yellow</b> <b>perch,</b> Decapoda, and Amphipoda. Largemouth bass, northern pike, and walleye fed intensively on <b>yellow</b> <b>perch.</b> Smallmouth bass preyed heavily on both <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> and decapods. Black crappie and <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> largely relied on macroinvertebrates. <b>Yellow</b> <b>perch,</b> logperch (Percina caprodes), walleye, and bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) were the four most predominant prey fish species {{over the course of the}} study. Using bioenergetics models, we found that walleye dominated both the total consumption and consumption of fish in 1995 [...] 1997, due to their high abundance and piscivory. We believe that annual intensive walleye stocking in Spirit Lake results in higher consumptive demand on forage fishes and walleye cannibalism compared to other systems in North America. As an important prey as well as dominant predator, <b>yellow</b> <b>perch</b> could influences walleye well-being and compete walleye for food in Spirit Lake, playing a complex role in the trophic dynamics of the fish community.
