The object of the exercise was to closely connect compute engines within the chassis to multiple user services brought in at the front panel. This maps closely to the needs of real time systems and the main points of the architecture are reviewed and discussed in that light. The performance of an ATCA backplane has been tested and measured using a Backplane Tester developed within a 10 Gb/s Ethernet switch project that was an early adopter of the ATCA standard.

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2003, the PICMG group adopted the AdvancedTCA (<b>Advanced</b> <b>Telecom</b> <b>Computing</b> <b>Architecture)</b> standard. The 10 Gb/s backplane of the AdvancedTCA chassis is well specified in the standard but it remains however a high end product, which can be itself subject to printed circuit board manufacturing control problems that could greatly affect its quality control. In order to study the practical aspects of high speed Ethernet switching at 10 Gb/s and to validate the signal integrity of the AdvancedTCA backplane, we developed a Backplane Tester. The tester system is able of running monitored PRBS traffic at 3. 125 Gb/s over every link on the AdvancedTCA backplane simultaneously and to monitor any possible connectivity failure immediately in terms of link and slot position inside the chassis. The present report presents the architectural hardware design, the control structure and software aspects of the AdvancedTCA Backplane Tester design...|$|E
40|$|An {{upgrade to}} the very-long-baseline-interferometry (VLBI) science {{receiver}} (VSR) a radio receiver used in NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN) {{is currently being}} implemented. The current VSR samples standard DSN intermediate- frequency (IF) signals at 256 MHz and after digital down-conversion records data from up to four 16 -MHz baseband channels. Currently, IF signals are limited to the 265 -to- 375 -MHz range, and recording rates are limited to less than 80 Mbps. The new digital front end, denoted the Wideband VSR, provides improvements to enable the receiver to process wider bandwidth signals and accommodate more data channels for recording. The Wideband VSR utilizes state-of-the-art commercial analog-to-digital converter and field-programmable gate array (FPGA) integrated circuits, and fiber-optic connections in a custom architecture. It accepts IF signals from 100 to 600 MHz, sampling the signal at 1. 28 GHz. The sample data are sent to a digital processing module, using a fiber-optic link for isolation. The digital processing module includes boards designed around an <b>Advanced</b> <b>Telecom</b> <b>Computing</b> <b>Architecture</b> (ATCA) industry-standard backplane. Digital signal processing implemented in FPGAs down-convert the data signals in up to 16 baseband channels with programmable bandwidths from 1 kHz to 16 MHz.

40|$|ILC work at Illinois has {{concentrated}} {{primarily on}} technical {{issues relating to}} the design of the accelerator. Because many of the problems to be resolved require a working knowledge of classical mechanics and electrodynamics, most of our research projects lend themselves well to the participation of undergraduate research assistants. The undergraduates in the group are scientists, not technicians, and find solutions to problems that, for example, have stumped PhD-level staff elsewhere. The ILC Reference Design Report calls for 6. 7 km circumference damping rings (which prepare the beams for focusing) using “conventional” stripline kickers driven by fast HV pulsers. Our primary goal was to determine the suitability of the 16 MeV electron beam in the AØ region at Fermilab for precision kicker studies. We found that the low beam energy and lack of redundancy in the beam position monitor system complicated the analysis of our data. In spite of these issues we concluded that the precision we could obtain was adequate to measure the performance and stability of a production module of an ILC kicker, namely 0. 5 %. We concluded that the kicker was stable to an accuracy of ~ 2. 0 % and that we could measure this precision to an accuracy of ~ 0. 5 %. As a result, a low energy beam like that at AØ {{could be used as a}} rapid-turnaround facility for testing ILC production kicker modules. The ILC timing precision for arrival of bunches at the collision point is required to be 0. 1 picosecond or better. We studied the bunch-to-bunch timing accuracy of a “phase detector” installed in AØ in order to determine its suitability as an ILC bunch timing device. A phase detector is an RF structure excited by the passage of a bunch. Its signal is fed through a 1240 MHz high-Q resonant circuit and then down-mixed with the AØ 1300 MHz accelerator RF. We used a kind of autocorrelation technique to compare the phase detector signal with a reference signal obtained from the phase detector’s response to an event at the beginning of the run. We determined that the device installed in our beam, which was instrumented with an 8 -bit 500 MHz ADC, could measure the beam timing to an accuracy of 0. 4 picoseconds. Simulations of the device showed that an increase in ADC clock rate to 2 GHz would improve measurement precision by the required factor of four. As a result, we felt that a device of this sort, assuming matters concerning dynamic range and long-term stability can be addressed successfully, would work at the ILC. Cost effective operation of the ILC will demand highly reliable, fault tolerant and adaptive solutions for both hardware and software. The large numbers of subsystems and large multipliers associated with the modules in those subsystems will cause even a strong level of unit reliability to become an unacceptable level of system availability. An evaluation effort is underway to evaluate standards associated with high availability, and to guide ILC development with standard practices and well-supported commercial solutions. One area of evaluation involves the <b>Advanced</b> <b>Telecom</b> <b>Computing</b> <b>Architecture</b> (ATCA) hardware and software. We worked with an ATCA crate, processor monitors, and a small amount of ATCA circuit boards in order to develop a backplane “spy” board that would let us watch the ATCA backplane communications and pursue development of an inexpensive processor monitor that could be used as a physics-driven component of the crate-level controls system. We made good progress, and felt that we had determined a productive direction to extend this work. We felt that we had learned enough to begin designing a workable processor monitor chip if there were to be sufficient interest in ATCA shown by the ILC community. Fault recognition is a challenging issue in the crafting a high reliability controls system. With tens of thousands of independent processors running hundreds of thousands of critical processes, how can the system identify that a problem has arisen and determine the appropriate steps to take to correct, or compensate, for the failure? One possible solution might come through the use of the OpenClovis supervisory system, which runs on Linux processors and allows a select set of processors to monitor the behavior of individual processes and processors in a large, distributed controls network. We found that OpenClovis exhibited an irritating amount of sensitivity to the exact version of the Linux kernel running on the processors, and that it was poorly equipped to help us sort through problems that arose through conflicts so deep in the operating systems of the processors. But once this issue was addressed, we found that it performed as expected, recognizing crashes and process (and processor) failures...|$|E
