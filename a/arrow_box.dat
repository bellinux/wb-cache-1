Additionally, the mitochondrial genome of {{another member of}} the Cryphonectriaceae, namely Cryphonectria parasitica (158, 902 bp), was retrieved and annotated for comparative purposes. These genomes showed high levels of synteny, especially in regions including genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and electron transfer, unique open reading frames (uORFs), ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and transfer RNAs (tRNAs), as well as intron positions. Comparative analyses revealed signatures of duplication events, intron number and length variation, and varying intronic ORFs which highlighted the genetic diversity of mt genomes among the Cryphonectriaceae. These mt genomes showed remarkable size polymorphism. The size polymorphism in the mt genomes of these closely related Chrysoporthe species was attributed to the varying number and length of introns, coding sequences and to a lesser extent, intergenic sequences. Compared to publicly available fungal mt genomes, the C. austroafricana mt genome is the second largest in the Ascomycetes thus far. S 1 Fig. Midrooted phylogenetic tree of rnpb genes.

40|$|Exposures to {{low levels}} of lead in the {{environment}} {{are believed to have}} potentially significant health effects, especially in children; such exposures to the general population come from many sources. Responsibility for regulating lead exposures has been derived from a multitude of laws passed by the Congress, and thus ultimate protection of people depends on actions taken by several agencies of the federal government. For this reason, the history of efforts to reduce exposures to lead is an excellent case study in the way that federal agencies do or do not work well together. The issue of reduction of lead in gasoline is discussed in relation to the evidence generated by HUD concerning the relationship of blood lead in urban children in New York City to seasonal variations in consumption of leaded gasoline in that area. Some recommendations for developing interagency cooperation in such controversies are presented. Lead, for the most part, is a low level environmental pollutant, with many possible sources and many pathways for exposure. Part of the problem of controlling lead is the fragmentation of responsibility for regulation, not only at the Federal level, but at the local level as well. The Department of Housing and Urban Development has had both a research and a regulatory responsibility for a part of this complex system since 1971. The major emphasis of this presentation will focus on how the results of our research were used and some of the lessons learned about interagency cooperation and policymaking, rather than the research itself. After establishing the context in which we operated, I would like to share some observations with you on what I learned about the practical aspects of cooperation and policy making. One of the standard operating procedures for a paper on lead is to point out the ubiquity of the metal in the environment. Often the SOP is to include a list of the lead uses, or products which contain lead, and the transport media or pathways of human exposure.

In this setting, a mediated global schema is unrealistic. Yet, users/applications wish to query the databases via one peer using its schema. We have recently developed HepToX, a P 2 P Heterogeneous XML database system. A key idea is that whenever a peer enters the system, it establishes an acquaintance with {{a small number of}} peer databases, possibly with different schema. The peer administrator provides correspondences between the local schema and the acquaintance schema using an informal and intuitive notation of <b>arrows</b> and <b>boxes.</b> We develop a novel algorithm that infers a set of precise mapping rules between the schemas from these visual annotations. We pin down a semantics of query translation given such mapping rules, and present a novel query translation algorithm for a simple but expressive fragment of XQuery, that employs the mapping rules in either direction. We show the translation algorithm is correct.

40|$|The Operations Engineering Lab (OEL) at JPL has {{developed}} a software architecture based on an integrated toolkit approach for simplifying and automating mission operations tasks. The toolkit approach is based on building adaptable, reusable graphical tools that are integrated {{through a combination of}} libraries, scripts, and system-level user interface shells. The graphical interface shells are designed to integrate and visually guide a user through the complex steps in an operations process. They provide a user with an integrated system-level picture of an overall process, defining the required inputs and possible output through interactive on-screen graphics. The OEL {{has developed}} the software for building these process-oriented graphical user interface (GUI) shells. The OEL Shell development system (OEL Shell) is an extension of JPL's Widget Creation Library (WCL). The OEL Shell system can be used to easily build user interfaces for running complex processes, applications with extensive command-line interfaces, and tool-integration tasks. The interface shells display a logical process flow using <b>arrows</b> and <b>box</b> graphics. They also allow a user to select which output products are desired and which input sources are needed, eliminating the need to know which program and its associated command-line parameters must be executed in each case. The shells have also proved valuable for use as operations training tools because of the OEL Shell hypertext help environment. The OEL toolkit approach is guided by several principles, including the use of ASCII text file interfaces with a multimission format, Perl scripts for mission-specific adaptation code, and programs that include a simple command-line interface for batch mode processing. Projects can adapt the interface shells by simple changes to the resources configuration file. This approach has allowed the development of sophisticated, automated software systems that are easy, cheap, and fast to build. This paper will discuss our toolkit approach and the OEL Shell interface builder {{in the context of a}} real operations process example.

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{shows how}} the Unified Modeling Language (UML) {{can be used to}} model {{software}} architectures effectively. Software architectures represent high-level views of systems and therefore allow developers to concentrate on the big picture rather than on low-level details [13]. They are also one of the best approaches to consider non-functional requirements early in the development process [1]. However, there is no standard definition of software architecture [17]. There is no agreement yet on how they should be modeled either. Therefore, software architectures are often described informally (using <b>arrows,</b> lines and <b>boxes).</b> Standardizing the notation, by using UML as a modeling tool, would reduce the ambiguity and make software architecture modeling easier for practitioners. A number of Architecture Description Languages (ADLs) already exist, which can be used to model software architectures. However, the software architecture community does not yet agree on what features should be present in an ADL, or precisely what these features should model [6]. Furthermore, there exists no common definition of the term Architecture Description Language either [17]. A large number of ADLs have been proposed as well and each of them takes a particular approach to the modeling of architectures [14]. This is one more reason why a standard modeling notation is needed. UML is already widely used for software analysis & design and it could also be a very useful tool for software architecture modeling. By modeling the CommPOS software architecture in UML, the paper shows how UML can be used to model component-based software architectures. However, further research into using UML for modeling of software architecture behaviors and dynamic software architectures is needed...|$|R

In this issue of Blood, an innovative structural approach was used to shed light on the interaction betweenGPIb andGPIX subunits. 1 TheGPIb-IX-V complex serves as theplatelet receptor that mediates binding to collagen-bound vonWillebrand factor (VWF) at sites of vascular injury, leading to platelet activation and thrombus formation. 2 GPIb-IX-V also bindsmany other ligands, the func-tional consequences of which aremore ob-scure; in the case of thrombin even despite the availability of structural information. 3 The process of platelet activationmust be tightly regulated because dysregulated thrombus formation blocks blood vessels and leads to ischemia, for example, in heart attack and ischemic stroke. Defects inGPIb-IX-V lead to the bleeding disorder Bernard-Soulier syndrome.
