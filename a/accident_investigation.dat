5|$|Unusually for an {{aircraft}} <b>accident</b> <b>investigation,</b> the investigative committee was not provided {{information as to}} {{the identities of the}} flight crew of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Although the <b>accident</b> <b>investigation</b> {{found that}} {{procedures}} and policies were supposedly {{already in place}} to prevent such a crash from occurring again, {{the fact that this}} crash occurred showed that in at least one instance, the existing safety policies and their enforcement had been grievously inadequate. To re-emphasize the importance of adherence to existing safety policies and correcting the actions of anyone violating them at any time, the USAF quickly distributed the findings of the <b>accident</b> <b>investigation</b> throughout the service. These measures failed to prevent – sixteen years later – the occurrence in almost identical circumstances of another accident, when a C-17 transport aircraft crashed shortly after taking off from Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, on an aerial-display practice flight.|$|E
5|$|Investigations were {{launched}} by the Rail <b>Accident</b> <b>Investigation</b> Branch and Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate. RMT rail union leader Bob Crow said on BBC News that a points failure {{was responsible for the}} incident. Experts compared the cause to that of the Potters Bar rail crash in 2002.|$|E

5|$|In November 2010, the <b>Accident</b> <b>Investigation</b> Board Norway {{criticized the}} braking system of the trains. During 2009, there were 83 {{incidents}} where trains with locked wheels slid down steep sections of track. The <b>Accident</b> <b>Investigation</b> Board found that the metro had conducted insufficient testing of {{the braking system}} on steep slippery lines, had not adjusted the brakes satisfactorily, and had not maintained the trains and tracks sufficiently. In December 2010, Oslo Vognselskap ordered another 32 three-car units, bringing the total order up to 115 three-car units. The last trains will be delivered in 2012. There was political disagreement regarding the final purchase, with the Liberal Party and socialist opposition securing a majority for the purchase, while the right-winged parties voted to order 19 units. The extra trains {{will make it possible}} to run all lines except the Holmenkollen Line (Line 1) with six-car lines, compared to a situation with only three-car trains on the Lambertseter Line, the Ring Line and the Kolsås Line (lines 4 and 6) would only use three-car trains.|$|E
5|$|In September 1995 the House National Security Subcommittee on Military Personnel, {{chaired by}} Bob Dornan, {{requested}} that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) conduct its own investigation into the shootdown incident. Specifically, the GAO was asked {{to determine if the}} USAF <b>accident</b> <b>investigation</b> board had met its objectives, if the subsequent military justice investigations had followed established guidelines, and if the DoD and/or USAF had improperly or unlawfully influenced these investigations.|$|E

5|$|While {{agreeing on}} most basic facts and findings, CENIPA and NTSB, which collaborated in the <b>{{accident}}</b> <b>investigation,</b> arrived at disagreeing interpretations and conclusions. The CENIPA report concludes {{the accident was}} caused by mistakes made both by air traffic controllers and by the ExcelAire pilots, whereas the NTSB focuses on the controllers and the ATC system, concluding that both flight crews acted properly but were placed {{on a collision course}} by the air traffic controllers.|$|E

5|$|In October 1990, while {{flying a}} {{training}} route in eastern Colorado, B-1B (s/n 86-0128) from the 384th Bomb Wing, 28th Bomb Squadron, McConnell AFB, experienced an explosion as the engines reached full power without afterburners. Fire on the aircraft's left was spotted. The #1 engine {{was shut down}} and its fire extinguisher was activated. The <b>accident</b> <b>investigation</b> determined that the engine had suffered catastrophic failure, engine blades had cut through the engine mounts and the engine became detached from the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Member of parliament, Inge Myrvoll, and {{president}} of the Norwegian Airline Pilots Association, Cpt.Peter Helland, both stated that the <b>Accident</b> <b>Investigation</b> Board should make a new inquiry about the accident. Cpt. Helland stated that the report's credibility was weakened due to the influence de Havilland Canada had during the process. On 10 June, the commission reopened the case, after having held meetings with Tyrer. The commission stated that there was disagreement as to if the tail rudder and tail plane or the end piece had cracked first, which would be crucial in determining the cause of the accident. Among the inquiries would be to re-investigate the tape of cockpit sound with new technology. The <b>Accident</b> <b>Investigation</b> Board used the National Aerospace Laboratory in the Netherlands to conduct tests on the end pieces. The report from the National Aerospace Laboratory was published on 23 March 1995, and supported the conclusion in the commissions report. The journalist Oddvar Kristoffersen in Fremover won the SKUP Award for 1994 for his work related to uncovering the controversy. The pilots' union in Widerøe was initially critical of the report, but by July it stated that it supported the conclusion. In addition, Det Norske Veritas withdrew its critical comments concerning the commission. With this, all officially involved parties supported the report.|$|E
5|$|STS-125 {{was further}} pushed back to October 2008 due to {{manufacturing}} delays on external tanks for future space shuttle missions.

5|$|The Grayrigg {{derailment}} was a fatal railway {{accident that}} occurred at approximately 20:15 GMT on 23 February 2007, {{just to the}} south of Grayrigg, Cumbria, in the North West England region of the United Kingdom. The <b>accident</b> <b>investigation</b> concluded that the derailment was caused by a faulty set of points (number 2B) on the Down Main running line, controlled from Lambrigg ground frame. The scheduled inspection on 18 February 2007 had not taken place and the faults had gone undetected.|$|E
5|$|The <b>accident</b> <b>investigation</b> {{concluded}} that the crash was primarily attributable to Holland's personality and behavior, USAF leaders' inadequate reactions to the previous incidents involving Holland, and {{the sequence of events}} and aircrew response during the final flight of the aircraft. Holland's disregard for procedures governing the safe operation of the B-52 aircraft that he commanded and the absence of firm and consistent corrective action by his superior officers allowed Holland to believe that he could conduct his flight in an unsafe manner, culminating with the slow, steeply banked, 360° turn around the control tower.|$|E
5|$|The lack {{of flight}} {{recorder}} {{data for the}} last six minutes of the flight added significant complexity to the investigation and was a major factor in its lengthy duration. The Transportation Safety Board team had to reconstruct the last six minutes of flight entirely from the physical evidence. As the aircraft was broken into 2 million pieces by the impact, this process was time-consuming and tedious. The investigation became the largest and most expensive transport <b>accident</b> <b>investigation</b> in Canadian history, costing C$57 million (US$48.5 million) over five years.|$|E

5|$|According to the <b>Accident</b> <b>Investigation</b> Board Norway, {{the rescue}} work was {{hampered}} by, among other things: lack of fire crew at Voss {{to drive the}} fire engine, a defective helicopter bucket, and a three-hour delay from the fire to a rail carriage with water was sent from Ål. Also, the fire carriage from Voss arrived six hours after the accident was reported. Concerns were raised regarding the fire hazards of wooden snow tunnels, and the National Rail Administration admitted {{that they should be}} made of a more fire-proof material, such as concrete or steel. Following the accident, the National Rail Administration decided that all welding would have to be monitored for several hours after completion of the work.|$|E
5|$|General Robert C. Oaks, USAF, Commander of United States Air Forces in Europe, {{immediately}} appointed an Air Force Regulation (AFR) 110-14 <b>accident</b> <b>investigation</b> board {{composed of}} a board president, 11 board members from the USAF and U.S. Army, three associate members from France, Turkey, and the United Kingdom, four legal advisers, and 13 technical advisers. The board president was Major General James G. Andrus, USAF. An AFR 110-14 investigation's findings are publicly released and the testimony of witnesses in the investigation can be used against them in military disciplinary proceedings. For this reason, after serious mishaps the USAF usually also conducts a separate safety investigation, in which the results are not publicly released and witness testimony is immune from prosecution. In this case, however, for unknown reasons the USAF decided not to conduct a safety investigation.|$|E
5|$|On 26 February, {{an interim}} report {{published}} by the Rail <b>Accident</b> <b>Investigation</b> Branch outlined the current progress of the investigation. The report contained a single conclusion, that the immediate cause of the accident was {{the condition of the}} stretcher bar arrangement at points 2B at Lambrigg crossover, which resulted in the loss of gauge separation of the point switch blades. The stretcher bars (components that hold the moving blades of the points the correct distance apart) had been found to be disconnected or missing. Of the three bars, one was not in position, another had nuts and bolts missing, and two were fractured. The points in question were facing the direction of travel of the train.|$|E
