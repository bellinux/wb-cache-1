25|$|Newspaper reports {{mention that}} Chang dealt {{exclusively}} with young women. One of his methods {{was to have}} a waiter pass a note to pretty girls in his restaurants saying that he admired them <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to have a quiet dinner with them sometime. Many then went on to become his customers, and some his lovers.

In order to distance himself from the actual transaction, the goods and money were exchanged over a high wall so that the parties were invisible to each other.|$|E

25|$|Reverse money {{laundering}} {{is a process}} that disguises a legitimate source of funds that are to be used for illegal purposes.

Unaccounted cash received via disguising financial transactions is not included in official financial reporting and could be used to evade taxes, hand in bribes and pay “under-the-table” salaries. For example, in an affidavit filed 24 March 2014 in United States District Court, Northern California, San Francisco Division, FBI special agent Emmanuel V. Pascau alleged that several people associated with the Chee Kung Tong organization, and California State Senator Leland Yee, engaged in reverse {{money laundering}} activities.|$|E
25|$|Protagoras {{does not}} deny being a Sophist, and claims {{that it is an}} ancient and honorable art, the same art practiced by Homer and Hesiod. These poets, he says, used the arts as a screen, a front, to protect {{themselves}} from the charge. He says that he is more straightforward than the ancient artists, trainers, and musicians in frankly admitting that he is an educator. Protagoras says he is old enough now to be the father of any of the men present, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> now to address himself to the whole company of people in the house. Socrates assumes that Prodicus would not want to miss the lecture, and so Callias and Alcibiades are sent to rouse him from his bed (317c–e). According to Francis Bacon, Prodicus is led to produce a speech in the dialogue (337a), which seems to Bacon as humiliating for him.|$|E
