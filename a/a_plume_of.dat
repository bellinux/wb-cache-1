50|$|A {{probable}} {{explanation is}} that a hot spot, <b>an</b> extremely hot <b>plume</b> <b>of</b> deep mantle material, is rising to the surface beneath the Columbia Plateau Province. We know that beneath Hawaii and Iceland, a temperature instability develops (for reasons not yet well understood) at {{the boundary between the}} core and mantle. The concentrated heat triggers <b>a</b> <b>plume</b> hundreds <b>of</b> kilometers in diameter that ascends directly through {{to the surface of the}} Earth.|$|R
5|$|A non-tropical low {{pressure}} area developed about 240miles (390km) south-southwest of Bermuda on April 18 through the interaction of an upper-level trough and a surface frontal trough. The surface trough, which extended from the gale center to Hispaniola, brought <b>a</b> <b>plume</b> <b>of</b> moisture northward from the Caribbean Sea into the circulation, which caused heavy rainfall in Puerto Rico. The non-tropical low tracked generally northward, with a ridge to its east and west, and on April 19 the system began producing sporadic convection near its center; early that day, satellite imagery indicated {{the presence of a}} tight inner core of winds. After turning to the northwest, it looped southeastward and gradually became separated from the surface frontal system, due to the deepening of the upper-level trough over the system. Convection became better organized over the center, and it is estimated the system developed into Subtropical Storm Ana early on April 20 while located about 250miles (400km) west of Bermuda. Operationally, the subtropical cyclone was not classified by the National Hurricane Center until 21hours later.|$|E
5|$|Flux-cored, {{self-shielding}} or gasless wire-fed welding {{had been}} developed for simplicity and portability. This avoids the gas system of conventional GMAW and uses a cored wire containing a solid flux. This flux vaporises during welding and produces <b>a</b> <b>plume</b> <b>of</b> shielding gas. Although described as a 'flux', this compound has little activity and acts mostly as an inert shield. The wire is of slightly larger diameter than for a comparable gas-shielded weld, to allow room for the flux. The smallest available is 0.8mm diameter, compared to 0.6mm for solid wire. The shield vapor is slightly active, rather than inert, so the process is always MAGS but not MIG (inert gas shield). This limits the process to steel and not aluminium.|$|E
5|$|The 1985 Election Day floods (also {{known as}} the Killer Floods of 1985 in West Virginia) {{produced}} the costliest floods in both West Virginia and Virginia in November 1985. The event occurred after Hurricane Juan, a tropical cyclone in the 1985 Atlantic hurricane season, meandered near the coast of Louisiana before striking just west of Pensacola, Florida late on October31. Juan moved northward into Canada, but spawned another system that spread moderate rainfall across the Mid-Atlantic States, wetting soils. On November3, a low pressure area developed south of Florida and moved northeastward along a cold front, bringing <b>a</b> <b>plume</b> <b>of</b> moisture influenced by Juan's previous track. The storm moved through the southeastern United States, stalling on November5 west of Washington, D.C. before turning out to sea the next day. The event was {{known as the}} Election Day floods due to its concurrence with elections in Virginia.|$|E

5|$|The storm sent <b>a</b> <b>plume</b> <b>of</b> {{moisture}} {{throughout the}} Arabian Peninsula, contributing to dust storms {{as far north}} as Iraq. However, the effects were most severe in Yemen, becoming the second-worst natural disaster in the country after deadly floods in 1996. The storm dropped heavy rainfall in a normally arid region, reaching around , which caused flash flooding in valleys after waterways were unable to contain the approximately 2billionkm3 (528billion gallons) of water that fell. Poor drainage practices and an invasive species of weed contributed to the floods, which damaged or destroyed 6,505houses, leaving about 25,000people homeless. The floods killed 180people and severely disrupted the livelihoods of about 700,000residents of Hadhramaut and Al Mahrah governorates, mostly farmers whose fields were washed away. Some of the buildings at the Shibam UNESCO World Heritage Site collapsed due to the floods. Overall damage was estimated at US$874.8million, although residual losses from damaged infrastructure were estimated to cost an additional US$726.9million. The overall economic impact of the storm was therefore estimated at US$1.638billion, equating to roughly 6% of the country's gross domestic product.|$|E
5|$|On December 19, a small {{low-level}} circulation {{was located}} along the northwest coastline of Borneo; {{at the same}} time <b>a</b> <b>plume</b> <b>of</b> cold air progressed southward through the South China Sea on the southeastern periphery of a ridge over the Far East. The vortex drifted southwestward, reaching open water by December 21. The northerly air surge was deflected after interacting with the circulation, and {{at the same time}} a portion of the air surge crossed the equator. The southerly flow turned eastward, then northward, and in combination with the northerly flow it wrapped into the vortex, resulting in rapid development of the low-level circulation, just a short distance north of the equator. By December 25, an area of scattered convection persisted about 370km (230mi) east of Singapore within an area of low wind shear, in association with the low-level circulation. Continuing slowly westward, the convection deepened and organized further, and at 1200UTC on December 26 the disturbance developed into a tropical depression about 230km (145mi) east of Singapore, or 156km (97mi) north of the equator. This was the first recorded occurrence of a tropical cyclone near the equator.|$|E
5|$|Following Voyager's {{encounters}} with Enceladus {{in the early}} 1980s, scientists postulated {{that it may be}} geologically active based on its young, reflective surface and location near the core of the Ering. Based on the connection between Enceladus and the Ering, scientists suspected that Enceladus was the source of material in the Ering, perhaps through venting of water vapor. Readings from Cassini's 2005 passage suggested that cryovolcanism, where water and other volatiles are the materials erupted instead of silicate rock, had been discovered on Enceladus. The first Cassini sighting of <b>a</b> <b>plume</b> <b>of</b> icy particles above Enceladus's south pole came from the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) images taken in January and February 2005, though the possibility of a camera artifact delayed an official announcement. Data from the magnetometer instrument during the February 17, 2005, encounter provided a hint that the feature might be real when it found evidence for a planetary atmosphere. The magnetometer observed an increase in the power of ion cyclotron waves near Enceladus. These waves are produced by the interaction of ionized particles and magnetic fields, and the waves' frequency can be used to identify their composition, in this case ionized water vapor. During the two following encounters, the magnetometer team determined that gases in Enceladus's atmosphere are concentrated over the south polar region, with atmospheric density away from the pole being much lower. The Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) confirmed this result by observing two stellar occultations during the February 17 and July 14 encounters. Unlike the magnetometer, UVIS failed to detect an atmosphere above Enceladus during the February encounter when it looked over the equatorial region, but did detect water vapor during an occultation over the south polar region during the July encounter.|$|E

25|$|The {{eruption}} of the Thera volcano provides a possible time marker for the region. A large eruption, {{it would have}} sent <b>a</b> <b>plume</b> <b>of</b> ash directly over Anatolia and filled the sea in the area with floating pumice. This pumice appeared in Egypt, apparently via trade. Current excavations in the Levant may also add to the timeline. The exact date of the volcanic eruption {{has been the subject}} of strong debate, with dates ranging between 1628 and 1520 BCE. Radiocarbon dating has placed it at between 1627BCE and 1600BCE with a 95% degree of probability. Archaeologist Kevin Walsh, accepting the radiocarbon dating, suggests a possible date of 1628 and believes this to be the most debated event in Mediterranean archaeology.|$|E

50|$|Once begun, <b>a</b> dredge <b>plume</b> {{develops}} and dissipates. These processes {{depend on}} a number of factors—such as the rate at which dredgers release material into the water column, and exactly where they release it. Another factor is the types of dredged materials. <b>A</b> dredge <b>plume</b> <b>of</b> coarse sand has different properties and dynamics than <b>a</b> similar <b>plume</b> <b>of</b> fine sand. Dredge plumes usually contain different constituents, each of which affects the plume's character. For example, denser material settles faster than less dense material. A fourth factor {{is the degree to which}} the plume's material clumps together to form larger particles, a process known as flocculation. Still another factor is water movement where the plume is introduced, e.g., currents, tides, waves, and turbulence.|$|R
