ResultsAdequate data were available for 354 participants. Mean dietary intake of sodium and potassium were 4. 4 ± 2. 1 and 1. 8 ± 0. 9 g/ 24 h, respectively. High intake of sodium was associated with urban area, age < 44 y, <b>administrative</b> <b>occupation,</b> higher income, body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m 2, and a large waist circumference.

30|$|Using {{representative}} linked employer-employee {{data of the}} German Federal Employment Agency, {{this paper}} shows that just one out of seven full-time employees who earned low wages (i.e., less {{than two-thirds of the}} median wage) in 1998 / 99 was able to earn wages above the low-wage threshold in 2003. Bivariate probit estimations with endogenous selection indicate that upward wage mobility is higher for younger and better qualified low-wage earners, whereas women are substantially less successful. We show that the characteristics of the employing firm also matter for low-wage earners' probability of escaping low-paid work. In particular, small plants and plants with a high share of low-wage earners often seem to be dead ends for low-wage earners. The likelihood of leaving the low-wage sector is also low when staying in unskilled and skilled service occupations and in unskilled commercial and <b>administrative</b> <b>occupations.</b> Consequently, leaving these dead-end plants and occupations appears to be an important instrument for achieving wages above the low-wage threshold.|$|R
30|$|We {{find that}} just {{one out of}} seven workers who earned low wages in 1998 and 1999 {{received}} wages above the low-wage threshold in 2003. While upward wage mobility thus appears to be limited, low-wage employment is not a persistent experience or a dead-end for all low-wage earners. Upward mobility is more likely for younger and better qualified low-wage earners and for men. In particular, firm characteristics {{turn out to be}} important determinants of upward mobility. Plants with a high share of low-wage earners and small plants often seem to be dead-ends. Upward mobility in these plants is limited, and changing the plant goes along with an increased upward mobility. The likelihood of leaving the low-wage sector is also particularly low when staying in unskilled and skilled service occupations and in unskilled commercial and <b>administrative</b> <b>occupations.</b> In contrast, the shares of women and foreigners in the plant do not have significant impacts on upward mobility.|$|R
30|$|The {{estimates}} in Table  4 for {{the years}} 2000 and 2003 usually point in the same direction, with effects often being more pronounced in the longer term. Looking at individual characteristics first, all estimations indicate that women are substantially less likely to escape from low-paid work than men, even {{if they continue to}} be full-time employed. The results in the last column (which are marginal effects calculated according to Stewart and Swaffield 1999) imply that a woman's probability of achieving higher-paid work (conditional on the selection that she was a low-wage earner in 1998 / 99 and continues to be full-time employed in 2003) is about   12 percentage points lower than that of a man with similar characteristics. Upward wage mobility is also lower for older and for unskilled employees, whereas there is no clear difference between German and foreign employees. Compared to the reference group of skilled commercial and <b>administrative</b> <b>occupations,</b> the chance of leaving the low-wage sector is lower in all other groups of occupations except semi-professions.|$|R

The spatial distribution of home workers follows a sectoral form. While the characteristics of inner-city and suburban home workers differ, the differences {{are the same as}} for commuters. Rather than creating a completely new locational pattern, home work appears to reinforce existing urban forces of centralisation by professionals and continued decentralisation by the middle classes and those seeking larger estates, such as those in management occupations.

30|$|Research {{findings}} on the transition from school to company-based vocational education and training suggest that mathematical competencies {{play a central role}} in securing a vocational training position (Lehmann et al. 2005; Seeber 2009). For companies offering training, mathematical competency ranks high among expected prerequisites of trainability together with other basic competencies and working attitudes, and it also represents an important criterion when selecting candidates (van Buer and Fehring 2013). A curricular analysis of business professions confirms that mathematical skills are critical with respect to business and decision-making contexts, both of which require an understanding of numbers, the relationship between parameters and the ability to apply mathematical operations and analytical models (Wittmann 2013). The same is true of industrial-technical occupations. Empirical studies reveal that mathematical skills play an important role in developing job specific competencies in a number of occupations that require intermediate qualifications, such as business and <b>administrative</b> <b>occupations,</b> occupations in the information technology, in skilled crafts and industry (Wittmann 2013; Seeber and Lehmann 2013; Nickolaus et al. 2008; Nickolaus and Norwig 2009; Rosendahl and Straka 2011). The links between cognitive and motivational dispositions of young adults at the beginning of training and their professional performance at the end of training have been examined by the ULME-III study (Lehmann and Seeber 2007) with respect to a range of different occupations. Significant correlations were found between competencies in mathematics and reading on the one hand and vocational competencies on the other, in particular in the area of business and administration and in selected technical specializations, although the strength of these correlations varied significantly between occupations (Seeber and Lehmann 2011; 2013).|$|R
30|$|While the {{relevance}} of these individual characteristics has also been found in previous studies, {{the main focus of}} our analysis has been to check whether there exist firms and/or occupations that prove to be dead ends for low-wage workers. We have shown that the characteristics of the employing firm indeed matter for low-wage earners' probability of escaping low-paid work. In particular, plants with a high share of low-wage earners seem to be dead ends for individual low-wage earners since there, the chance of upward wage mobility is significantly lower. In contrast, plants with high shares of women or of foreigners do not reduce the upward wage mobility of women and foreigners, respectively. Another dead end for low-wage earners seems to be small plants, which offer significantly lower chances of upward wage mobility than larger plants. The likelihood of leaving the low-wage sector is also particularly low when staying in unskilled and skilled service occupations and in unskilled commercial and <b>administrative</b> <b>occupations.</b> Consequently, leaving these dead-end plants and occupations appears to be an important instrument for achieving wages above the low-wage threshold.|$|R

40|$|The {{overarching}} {{aim of this}} dissertation is {{to study}} what happens with occupational identities in occupations subject to substantial and protracted pressure for change, more specifically in <b>administrative</b> service <b>occupations</b> in Sweden today. The dissertation centres on two cases within this broader category: medical secretaries and post-office cashiers. Typically for <b>administrative</b> service <b>occupations,</b> both have {{a large majority of}} women and their existence has repeatedly been questioned. At the same time, they represent two diverging lines of the differentiation this type of occupations has gone through. While the medical secretaries so far have kept their place in medical/health care, the post-office cashiers have gone from expansion of the work content in the 1980 s and 1990 s to dequalification, splitting, and finally being abolished. The study combines interviews as a main source of data with various types of text material. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in 2004 – 05 with a total of 39 medical secretaries and post-office cashiers. The theoretical backbone of the dissertation is a pluralistic identity perspective combined with an intersectional analysis that takes into consideration various bases of identity like gender and class but also modernity. Focus is also put on the use of discourses and narratives. The results support the view that it is meaningful to speak of occupational identity in <b>administrative</b> service <b>occupations</b> and, more generally, that it is neither an obsolete phenomenon nor something reserved for well-defined professional, high-status or craft occupations. Both secretaries and cashiers have occupational identities which are distinct and strong within certain limits. There is a distinct core of tasks, competences and ethical norms that stands out as generally considered important. This core is also in many respects the same in both occupations (emphasizing among other things the balanced exertion of carefulness and service), which points toward the plausibility of the concept ‘administrative service’. There is furthermore some basis for suggesting that a strong but delimited occupational identity of this type can be evoked by technological and economic changes if these are perceived to collide with human and social concerns, and that it can also - at least under some circumstances - be a resource for resistance and action. Swedish medical secretaries constitute an example of this. In their collective identity work, they walk a fine line between embracing contemporary discourses of modernization, professionalization and change, and holding their ground in spheres of the occupation that easily get dismissed or neglected in these discourses...|$|R
50|$|The {{occupation}} {{structure of}} Stanfield have increasingly {{changed since the}} 1800s. It has moved from a primary sector industry such as agricultural farming to a secondary and tertiary sector employment such as manufacturing, skilled trades and thus, providing services. In relation to the 2001 Census Report, 53 people are registered in employment within Stanfield, 14 of whom are employed in skilled trades occupations such as metal and electrical trades and printing and other skilled trades. Interestingly, 7 people of the aforementioned occupation group are still employed as skilled agricultural trades and related production. The 2001 Census Report also illustrated that 9 people were employed as <b>administrative</b> <b>occupations</b> as well as, secretarial and related occupations. In regards to the 2011 Census Report, there were no mention of occupations within the agriculture sector, most of the employment recorded are from the secondary and tertiary sector.
