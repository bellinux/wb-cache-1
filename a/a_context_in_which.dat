25|$|Increasingly emancipated German-speaking Jews {{wanted to}} immerse {{themselves}} in Germany's rich cultural life. However, individual Jews {{were faced with}} a dilemma: they faced new opportunities, but without the comfort of a secure community. For Jewish women, there was an additional issue. German society imposed the usual gender role restrictions and antisemitism, so cultivated Jewish women tapped into the cultural salon. But from 1800 on, salons performed a political and social miracle. The salon allowed Jewish women to establish a venue in their homes in which Jews and non-Jews could meet in relative equality. Like-minded people could study art, literature, philosophy or music together. This handful of educated, acculturated Jewish women could escape the restrictions of their social ghetto. Naturally the women {{had to be in}} well-connected families, either to money or to culture. In these mixed gatherings of nobles, high civil servants, writers, philosophers and artists, Jewish salonnières created a radical vehicle for democratisation, providing <b>a</b> <b>context</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> patrons and artists freely exchanged ideas. Henriette Lemos Herz, Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel, Dorothea Mendelssohn Schlegel, Amalie Wolf Beer and at least twelve other salonnières achieved fame and admiration.|$|E

The power to name the object resides in the understanding. First must come the impression, and the understanding—having the power of utterance—expresses in speech the affection it receives from the object. True presentations are distinguished from those that are false {{by the use of}} memory, classification and comparison.

2500|$|Since {{the space}} of {{alternating}} linear forms in [...] arguments on a vector space is naturally isomorphic to the dual of {{the space of}} -vectors over that vector space, the Hodge dual can be defined for these spaces as well. [...] As with most constructions from linear algebra, the Hodge dual can then be extended to a vector bundle. [...] Thus <b>a</b> <b>context</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the Hodge dual is very often seen is the exterior algebra of the cotangent bundle, the space of differential forms on a manifold, {{where it can be}} used to construct the codifferential from the exterior derivative, and thus the Laplace–de Rham operator, which leads to the Hodge decomposition of differential forms in the case of compact Riemannian manifolds.|$|E

Previously, shipping occurred on a long-distance routes from the far east to India or even further west to the Arabian peninsula, which was relatively costly, risky and time-consuming. However, the new trading system involved {{the division of the}} maritime silk road into three segments: an Indian Ocean sector linking the Gulf of Aden and the Straits of Hormuz-based Arab traders to India, a Bay of Bengal sector linking the Indian ports with the Straits of Malacca and its associated ports including Singapura and the South China Sea sector linking Southeast Asia with Southern China.|$|E
40|$|Decisions under {{uncertainty}} depend {{not only}} on the degree of uncertainty but also on its source, as illustrated by Daniel Ellsberg's (1961) observation of ambiguity aversion. In this article, the authors propose the comparative ignorance hypothesis, according to which ambiguity aversion is produced by a comparison with less ambiguous events or with more knowledgeable individuals. This hypothesis is supported in a series of studies showing that ambiguity aversion, present <b>in</b> <b>a</b> comparative <b>context</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> person evaluates both clear and vague prospects, seems to disappear <b>in</b> <b>a</b> noncomparative <b>context</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> person evaluates only one of these prospects in isolation.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} investigated inferences {{based on}} suppositions. In Experiment 1, the subjects decided whether suppositions about individuals’ veracity {{were consistent with}} their assertions—for example, whether the supposition “Ann {{is telling the truth}} and Beth is telling a lie”, is consistent with the premises: “Ann asserts: I am telling the truth and Beth is telling the truth. Beth asserts: Ann is telling the truth”. It showed that these inferences are more difficult than ones based on factual premises: “Ann asserts: I live in Dublin and Beth lives in Dublin”. There was no difference between problems about truthtellers and liars, who always told the truth or always lied, and normals, who sometimes told the truth and sometimes lied. In Experiment 2, the subjects made inferences about factual matters set in three contexts: <b>a</b> truth-inducing <b>context</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> friends confided their personality characteristics, <b>a</b> lie-inducing <b>context</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> business rivals advertised their products, and <b>a</b> neutral <b>context</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> computers printed their program characteristics. Given the supposition that the individuals were lying, it was more difficult to make inferences <b>in</b> <b>a</b> truth-inducing <b>context</b> than <b>in</b> the other two contexts. We discuss the implications of our results for everyday reasoning from suppositions, and for theories of reasoning based on models or inference rules. 30 page(s...|$|R

2500|$|The {{fact that}} the Burghal Hidage does not include London, only taken in late 879; {{that many of the}} burhs {{recorded}} in the document were of a temporary nature and were only replaced by more permanent fortified sites later on; and that its organisation reflects a strategic offensive against the Viking presence in Mercia and London, are factors which argue strongly that the Burghal Hidage is a prescriptive list describing a system which was in process of being planned and implemented before late 879. [...] It is therefore likely to have originated in <b>a</b> <b>context</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the logistics of the system and the means for its implementation and support were being worked out in practice on the ground. [...] The {{fact that the}} construction of a burh at Buckingham by Alfred can be logically placed within this strategic scheme at this period (878-9), removes the necessity of having to place the creation of the original version of the Burghal Hidage after the first documentary mention of Buckingham in 914. Its composition can therefore be most appropriately placed in a West Saxon context, rather than one which relates to the formation of burhs and shires in Mercia in the early 10th century – to which situation it has no relevance.|$|E
2500|$|The latter preface {{is noted}} for its musings {{on the origin of}} the Romanian vernacular, with Năsturel {{recognizing}} it as a [...] "relative of Latin". However, as Negrici notes, his very retention of Slavonic showed that he was [...] "hostile to the Romanian language". Historian and culture critic Nicolae Iorga also argued that, given <b>a</b> <b>context</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> very few could read Slavonic, translating The Imitation of Christ into that language was [...] "pointless", an exercise in [...] "pretentious erudition". All of Năsturel's Slavonic poetry, including [...] "epigrams on Greek names" [...] or those he dedicated to Elena, has lexical obscurities and intricate wordplay, leading various specialists to conclude that his was a local manifestation of Baroque literature. Ethnologist Costion Nicolescu describes it as [...] "rhetorical, pompous and artificial", [...] "addressing an elite of intellectuals and the Chancellery". According to Theodorescu, Năsturel was a [...] "man of wide-ranging culture", but did not read all of the authors he cited. His verse is [...] "pedantic", its use of Slavonic [...] "already anachronistic"; the main function is to [...] "direct" [...] and feed a [...] "courtly culture", which is on par with other European manifestations. Iorga contends that, overall, Năsturel lacked literary skill and originality, being inferior to his Moldavian counterpart, Grigore Ureche.|$|E
2500|$|Critics' {{reviews of}} From the Sky Down were mixed. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an {{enthusiastic}} review, describing it as [...] "one {{of the most}} transcendent close-up looks at {{the process of creating}} rock & roll I've ever seen." [...] In his opinion, the film was a [...] "stirring testament to what it really means when four people in this world can create magical things because they band together." [...] Hank Steuver of The Washington Post called it an [...] "intriguing" [...] documentary that [...] "becomes a revealing and even enlightening meditation on the mystery of why some bands stay together and some don't." [...] The reviewer said the film is [...] "refreshingly blunt and beautifully assembled" [...] and praised Guggenheim for asking the band tough questions about that period in their history. Brad Wheeler of The Globe and Mail gave the film a three-out-of-four star rating, calling it an [...] "essential companion piece" [...] to the reissue of Achtung Baby. Wheeler wrote that [...] "the process of U2 dreaming itself a new fashion while struggling to get its joy back is tightly and adroitly explored". Radio broadcaster Alan Cross wrote that the viewer will [...] "come out with a new appreciation of {{what it takes to be}} U2". Cross enjoyed the scenes in which the band revisit old DAT tapes demonstrating the evolution of the songs [...] "Mysterious Ways" [...] and [...] "One", along with the animated scenes. Drew McWeeny of HitFix wrote that the documentary is not a [...] "complete record" [...] of Achtung Babys conception, but that it [...] "offers fans a rare glimpse at the process behind U2's music, and for non-fans, it attempts to set <b>a</b> <b>context</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> they can appreciate what it is that U2 accomplished". Like other reviewers, he highlighted the scene in which the band revisits the recording of [...] "One" [...] as one of the film's most important. McWeeny ended his review by saying, [...] "This may not be everything I wanted from the movie, but it's solid, and the glimpse we get of real creative alchemy is impressive, indeed." ...|$|E
