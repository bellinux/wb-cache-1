25|$|Anyway, I keep picturing <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>little</b> {{kids playing}} some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around – nobody big, I mean – except me. And I'm {{standing}} {{on the edge of}} some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff – I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all.|$|E
2500|$|During the war, this {{curiosity and}} {{propaganda}} underwent a transformation. Most of the German population realised that {{the fate of}} the prisoners of war was shared by their own absent detainees, and, from 1915, the prisoners noted that the visitors’ vehemence had cooled. Little by little a relationship built on understanding developed, as Charles Gueugnier, a simple zouave, noted in his daily diary: “Beautiful day, many visitors around the camp; among this crowd black dominates: grief has driven away their insolent smugness. All these griefs that pass through, I sympathise with them and salute in them those who have died for their fatherland. Especially, <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>little</b> ones hurt me a lot, because it’s sad”. Work also allowed prisoners to know the population better and better, and the longer the war dragged on, the more relaxed these relationships became. Robert d’Harcourt notes: “The inhabitants seemed rather indifferent to the war. The neighbourhood barber’s wife [...] told me one day: ‘What the f___ do we care about Alsace-Lorraine? Let them give it to the French and let the slaughter cease’." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Would Lord Grex allow Percival to {{have his}} friends living here?" [...] Earl Grex was Lady Mabel's father, Lord Percival was the Earl's son;--and the Earl lived in Belgrave Square. <b>All</b> <b>these</b> are <b>little</b> bits of the horse.|$|R
6000|$|... "You mind mine, snotty," [...] said Moorshed. [...] "I was <b>all</b> night putting <b>these</b> <b>little</b> ear-marks {{on you for}} {{the umpires}} to sit on. Leave 'em alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{there were}} sighs, the deeper for suppression, [...] And stolen glances, sweeter for the theft, [...] And burning blushes, though for no transgression, [...] Tremblings when met, and restlessness when left; [...] <b>All</b> <b>these</b> are <b>little</b> preludes to possession, [...] Of which young passion cannot be bereft, [...] And merely tend {{to show how}} greatly love is [...] Embarrass'd at first {{starting}} with a novice.|$|R
60|$|<b>All</b> <b>these</b> <b>little</b> tokens of his gratitude, Mr. Gradgrind very willingly {{undertook}} to render. Though he thought them far too slight, he said, {{for such a}} service.|$|E
60|$|Rajbullub {{was much}} {{surprised}} at the lad's interest in <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>little</b> matters, which, as it seemed to him, were not worth a thought {{on the part of}} his lord's nephew.|$|E
6000|$|... "Partly," [...] said Margaret, [...] "and partly my own. I put in <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>little</b> white puffs, and I {{hope you}} think they do me credit. Wasn't it grand of me?" ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{summer of}} 2014 she collaborated with Gianluca Buccellati, and {{together}} they arranged and recorded a cover of [...] "No Angel" [...] by Beyoncé. Wrote Stereogum, [...] "In her cover, Tei Shi keeps the song's lovesick drift intact but adds <b>all</b> <b>these</b> trickly <b>little</b> bloop-pop flourishes." [...] The Fader described the cover as an [...] "'80s-leaning take," [...] stating that [...] "breezy vocals and glowing synths were made for this role." ...|$|R
60|$|Well! <b>all</b> <b>these</b> {{pleasant}} <b>little</b> occurrences {{could happen}} yet. M. de Stainville was {{quite sure that}} on his return from Le Havre he could provoke the Englishman to fight. Milor might {{be something of a}} coward--obviously he was one, else he had accepted so mild a challenge--but he could not always refuse to fight in the face of certain provocation, which would mean complete social ruin if disregarded.|$|R
60|$|The {{velocity}} and certainty of Mr. Bucket's interpretation on <b>all</b> <b>these</b> heads is <b>little</b> short of miraculous. Mrs. Rouncewell, {{who holds the}} light, is giddy with the swiftness of his eyes and hands as he starts up, furnished for his journey.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not, sir; {{that would}} be oppressive, and they would stand in each other's way; still, Captain Cuffe, the thirds hold out wonderfully, even in <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>little</b> matters. There's the three lieutenants; and there's the boatswain, gunner, and carpenter--and--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{gave him}} a red-hot shot that time, Sir John," [...] whispered Captain Poke at my elbow; [...] "now, if you are so disposed, I will wring the necks of <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>little</b> blackguards, and throw {{them out of the}} window." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say {{about three}} {{thousand}} for the Island--enough to stop any expedition that might come. Look at <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>little</b> bays and coves. There are twenty {{places at the}} back of the island where you could land men and make things unpleasant for Hong-Kong." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{strikes me}} dumb {{to look over}} the long series of faces, such as any full Church, Courthouse, London-Tavern Meeting, or {{miscellany}} of men will show them. Some score or two of years ago, <b>all</b> <b>these</b> were <b>little</b> red-coloured pulpy infants; each of them capable of being kneaded, baked into any social form you chose: yet see now how they are fixed and hardened,--into artisans, artists, clergy, gentry, learned serjeants, unlearned dandies, and can and shall now be nothing else henceforth! ...|$|R
40|$|To {{implement}} digital recording, {{a confluence}} of several factors is necessary: political will {{on the part of}} the public officials involved (recorders and their political masters, usually county commissioners or supervisors), legal authority, and budgets adequate to the task. Without <b>all</b> of <b>these</b> factors, <b>little</b> progress is likely...|$|R
6000|$|Some {{subconscious}} barrier {{gave way}} in me. I found myself crying uncontrollably--as I have never cried since I {{was a little}} child. I was amazed and horrified at myself. And wonderfully, Margaret was on her knees beside me, with her arms about me, mingling her weeping with mine. [...] "Oh, my Husband!" [...] she cried, [...] "my poor Husband! Does it hurt you so? I would do anything! Oh, the fool I am! Dear, I love you. I love you over and away and above <b>all</b> <b>these</b> jealous <b>little</b> things!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I say, Ann," [...] remarked Kipps one day, [...] "we shall 'ave to {{call this}} little 'ouse by a name. I was {{thinking}} of 'Ome Cottage. But I dunno whether 'Ome Cottage is quite the thing like. <b>All</b> <b>these</b> <b>little</b> fishermen's places are called Cottages." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know a {{lady who}} would buy this--a {{marchande}} de mode, a friend of mine, who gives the highest prices that are ever paid for such articles--for {{to tell you the}} truth certain Russian princesses employ her in <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>little</b> matters. Have you thought of your price, mademoiselle?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's queer," [...] said Evans, after a pause, [...] "what {{these little}} marks down here are for. It {{looks like the}} plan of a house or something; but what <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>little</b> dashes, {{pointing}} this way and that, may mean I can't get a notion. And what's the writing?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Put {{the screw}} on the District officials; brigade De {{with a very}} strong Deputy Commissioner {{on each side of}} him; give him the best {{assistant}} in the Province; rub the fear of God into the people beforehand; and if anything goes wrong, say that his colleagues didn't back him up. <b>All</b> <b>these</b> lovely <b>little</b> experiments recoil on the District-Officer in the end,' said the Knight of the Drawn Sword with a truthful brutality that made the Head of the Red Provinces shudder. And on a tacit understanding of this kind the transfer was accomplished, as quietly as might be for many reasons.|$|R
40|$|The Internet is {{the latest}} in a long {{succession}} of communication technologies. The goal of this work is to draw lessons from the evolution of <b>all</b> <b>these</b> services. <b>Little</b> attention is paid to technology as such, since that has changed radically many times. Instead, the stress is on the steady growth in volume of communication, the evolution in the type of traffic sent, the qualitative change this growth produces in how people treat communication, and the evolution of pricing. The focus is on the user, and in particular on how quality and price differentiation have been used by service providers to influence consumer behavior, and how consumers have reacted...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, this article," [...] I said, {{pointing}} {{at it with}} my egg spoon as I sat down to my breakfast. [...] "I see that you have read it since you have marked it. I don't deny that it is smartly written. It irritates me though. It is evidently the theory of some arm-chair lounger who evolves <b>all</b> <b>these</b> neat <b>little</b> paradoxes in the seclusion of his own study. It is not practical. I should {{like to see him}} clapped down in a third class carriage on the Underground, and asked to give the trades of all his fellow-travellers. I would lay a thousand to one against him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Were I {{to enter}} into <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>little</b> particulars, it would detain you from more worthy subjects. Perhaps this {{certificate}} will convince you that I am no novice on the sea." [...] As she spoke, a guinea fell from her white hand into the broad and extended palm of her interrogator.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's quite true, but I'll {{tell you}} all about it another time," [...] and so he left her. <b>All</b> <b>these</b> <b>little</b> troubles, his {{experience}} in the [...] "House," [...] the necessity of snubbing Tifto, the choice of a wife, and his battle with Reginald Dobbes, were giving him by degrees age and flavour.|$|E
60|$|Ben WOULD say acTYVE, and SARtain, {{though he}} was above saying creatoore, or creatur'. This is the {{difference}} between a Pennsylvanian and a Yankee. We shall not stop, however, to note <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>little</b> peculiarities in these individuals, but use the proper or the peculiar dialect, as may happen to be most convenient to ourselves.|$|E
5000|$|... "We're really honoring traditions," [...] Mrs. Hawes told The Washington Post in 1983. [...] "These {{individuals}} {{are the people}} who've been pushed up by the traditions, they're the lightning rods that we grab onto. It's extremely important for the psychic {{health and well-being of}} Americans to maintain <b>all</b> of <b>these</b> <b>little</b> regional distinctions, to establish a cultural pluralism. It's like my brother folklorist Alan Lomax wrote one time: if the cultural gray-out continues around the world, pretty soon there will be no place worth visiting [...] [...] [...] and no particular reason to stay home, either." [...] Patricia Sullivan, [...] "Bess Lomax Hawes, 88, Championed folk arts as performer and NEA official".|$|R
500|$|... "The Box" [...] was co-written by co-executive {{producer}} Josh Singer {{and executive}} story editor Graham Roland, while being directed by [...] veteran Jeffrey Hunt. The episode {{was shot in}} the second half of July 2010. Hunt later tweeted on-set photos in January 2011. At San Diego Comic-Con International during the summer leading up to the season premiere, actress Jasika Nicole told the audience they would finally be able to see her character's apartment, which has previously been only alluded to in an early season two episode. She explained, [...] "It's really neat! [...] There's <b>all</b> <b>these</b> tiny <b>little</b> things that give you insight into how things are. [...] I know the color of (Astrid's) walls, so watch out!" ...|$|R
60|$|She smiled sweetly {{and said}} she was not feeling cold, after which there was a long {{interval}} of silence. From time to time we met a villager, a fisherman in his ponderous sea-boots, or a farm-labourer homeward plodding his weary way. But though heavy-footed after his day's labour he is never so stolid as an English ploughman is apt to be; invariably when giving us a good-night in passing the man would smile and look at Millicent very directly with a meaning twinkle in his Cornish eye. He might have been congratulating her on having a male companion to pay her <b>all</b> <b>these</b> nice <b>little</b> attentions, and perhaps signalling the hope that something would come of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't {{know what}} a {{pleasure}} it is to me to give you <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>little</b> particulars. Count up--my bosom friend, my second mother--count up the money you have advanced on the chance of my becoming Mrs. Armadale, and then think of my feeling this breathless interest in another man. Oh, Mrs. Oldershaw, how intensely I enjoy the luxury of irritating you! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing," [...] he said. [...] "I {{stood like}} a stuffed calf. She just looked back once, you know, and stood smiling like and crying--I {{could see the}} shine of her eyes--and then she was gone, and there was <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>little</b> fellows bustling about me, {{stuffing}} my 'ands and my pockets {{and the back of}} my collar and everywhere with gold." ...|$|E
6000|$|No, {{turn and}} turn about [...] But my turn is first, because I am the older. [...] Cliodna {{embroidered}} these bird wings, but Fand [...] Made <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>little</b> golden {{eyes with the}} hairs [...] That she had stolen out of Aengus' beard, [...] And therefore none that has this cloak about him [...] Is crossed in love. The heavy inlaid brooch [...] That Buan hammered has a merit too.|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{you think}} it very rude of me if I ask you to let me be one of [...] your party on your {{expedition}} up the river to-morrow? I heard of it [...] from your son Algernon {{last night at the}} Balfours', and I happen to [...] be very anxious to meet one of the ladies you have invited. Now, [...] I know you're kindness itself to all your young friends in <b>all</b> [...] <b>these</b> <b>little</b> matters, and I'm sure you won't be angry with me for [...] so coolly inviting myself.

Please [...] don't answer unless you've no room for me, but expect me to turn up [...] at half-past two.|$|R
2500|$|Despite this, recent Theosophists and Anthroposophists {{have tried}} to {{incorporate}} the facts of geology and paleontology into their cosmology and spiritual evolution (in Anthroposophy Hermann Poppelbaum is a particularly creative thinker in this regard). Some have attempted to equate Lemuria with Gondwanaland, for example. Today <b>all</b> <b>these</b> ideas have <b>little</b> influence outside their specialised followings, but for a time Theosophical concepts were immensely influential. [...] Theosophy-like teachings also continue today {{in a group of}} religions based on Theosophy called the Ascended Master Teachings.|$|R
60|$|From sumptuous Versailles, {{with its}} palaces, its statues, its gardens, and its fountains, we journeyed back to Paris and sought its {{antipodes}} --the Faubourg St. Antoine. Little, narrow streets; dirty children blockading them; greasy, slovenly women capturing and spanking them; filthy dens on first floors, with rag stores in them (the heaviest {{business in the}} Faubourg is the chiffonier's); other filthy dens where whole suits of second and third-hand clothing are sold at prices that would ruin any proprietor who did not steal his stock; still other filthy dens where they sold groceries--sold them by the half-pennyworth--five dollars would buy the man out, goodwill and <b>all.</b> Up <b>these</b> <b>little</b> crooked streets they will murder a man for seven dollars and dump {{the body in the}} Seine. And up some other of these streets--most of them, I should say --live lorettes.|$|R
