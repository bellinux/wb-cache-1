5|$|Sarah {{suggests}} that Hank and Jacob return a paltry {{sum of the}} money to the plane to avoid suspicion from local authorities. While travelling on foot to the woods, the brothers come across an old man on a snowmobile. Jacob, thinking that their cover is blown, bludgeons him. When the man regains consciousness, Hank suffocates him, then uses the snowmobile to drive his body off a bridge, making the murder look like an accidental death. The following night, Lou drunkenly demands some of the money from Hank, because he has spent recklessly since the discovery. When Hank refuses, Lou threatens to go to the authorities, having learned from Jacob <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> man's murder.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{positive}} news <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Post Office Pavilion, {{it was not}} doing well. GSA imposed conditions on the 1983 renovation that left the retail pavilion looking like an office building rather than a shopping mall. There was also too little retail space, the retail space was poorly configured due to the architectural design of the building, and GSA refused to allow any storefronts on the exterior that would signal that there was retail or restaurants inside. The pavilion's revenues were generated in about equal parts from tourists, local office workers, and local residents. Although most retailers were making money, revenues fluctuated wildly on a seasonal basis. Restaurants {{had a difficult time}} earning money, and turnover among them was high.|$|E
25|$|Everything <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> lead industry, {{from the}} mining of ore to its sale, {{stemmed from the}} ancient claim of the monarch to all mineral rights. The whole {{structure}} was designed to enable the Duchy of Lancaster, a royal possession, to collect the king's royalties and, since these were farmed out, the miners paid them to the king's farmer. By the 17th century the local holder of the mineral rights was also the barmaster, who ran the industry, helped by deputies responsible for the liberties, and by the miners' juries of the Barmote Court. The lead industry is long gone, but its traditions are still maintained and the barmaster and the jury still meet in the Barmote Hall in Wirksworth.|$|E

25|$|Within the Mountain State, these tribal villages can be {{characterized}} as rather small and scattered as they moved <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> fields every couple of generations. Many would join other tribes and remove to the midwest regions as settlers arrived in the state. Although, there were those who would acculturate within the historic as sometimes called Fireside Cabin culture. Some are early historic documented seeking protection closer, moving to the easterly Colonial trade towns. And later, other small splintered clans were attracted to, among others, James Le Tort, Charles Poke and John Van Metre trading houses within the state. This historic period changed way of living extends from a little before the 18th century Virginia and Pennsylvania region North American fur trade beginning on the Eastern Panhandle of the state.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 1953, Crawford went to Townsville {{for several}} months to assist in {{reporting}} for the Guardian newspaper on the very successful North QLD Rank and File Worker's convention. The Playwrights Advisory Board sponsored a playwriting competition in 1955 and Crawford entered a three-act play. This play was titled The Wit to Woo and was about a hospitalised patient who had a dream of finding a hard working life. Crawford wrote another play for the Ipswich Drama Festival of 1956 called They Passed this Way. It was <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Windmill cum Observatory on Wickham Terrace, Brisbane and was performed in Brisbane by New Theatre. Jim wrote several radio features about this time, The Avenging Ghost of Campbell Town and The Celebrated Mr Barrington with various successes.|$|E
25|$|Privacy {{amplification}} is {{a method}} for reducing (and effectively eliminating) Eve's partial information about Alice and Bob's key. This partial information could have been gained both by eavesdropping on the quantum channel during key transmission (thus introducing detectable errors), and on the public channel during information reconciliation (where it is assumed Eve gains all possible parity information). Privacy amplification uses Alice and Bob's key to produce a new, shorter key, {{in such a way}} that Eve has only negligible information about the new key. This can be done using a universal hash function, chosen at random from a publicly known set of such functions, which takes as its input a binary string of length equal to the key and outputs a binary string of a chosen shorter length. The amount by which this new key is shortened is calculated, based on how much information Eve could have gained <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> key (which is known due to the errors this would introduce), in order to reduce the probability of Eve having any knowledge of the new key to a very low value.|$|E

Peng's family lived in a thatched-straw hut and owned approximately 1.5 acres of irrigated land, on which the family grew bamboo, sweet potatoes, tea, cotton, and various vegetables. His father also operated a bean curd shop. The income from the land and shop supported an extended family of eight people, including Peng, his three brothers, his parents, his grandmother, and a grand-uncle. Peng's grand-uncle had joined and fought for the Taiping rebellion, and used to tell Peng <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Taiping ideals: that everyone should have enough food to eat, that women should not bind their feet, and that land should be redistributed equally. Peng later described his own class background as [...] "lower-middle peasant".|$|E
500|$|Smaug is {{the main}} antagonist. In many ways the Smaug episode {{reflects}} and references the dragon of Beowulf, and Tolkien uses the episode to put into practice some of the ground-breaking literary theories he had developed <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> English poem in its portrayal of the dragon as having bestial intelligence. Tolkien greatly prefers this motif over the later medieval trend of using the dragon as a symbolic or allegorical figure, {{such as in the}} legend of St. George. Smaug the dragon with his golden hoard may be seen {{as an example of the}} traditional relationship between evil and metallurgy as collated in the depiction of Pandæmonium with its [...] "Belched fire and rolling smoke" [...] in Milton's Paradise Lost.
