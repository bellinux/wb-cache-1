40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the challenges and}} barriers experienced when seeking Human Research Ethics <b>approval</b> <b>for</b> a national multisite qualitative research study. <b>Applications</b> <b>for</b> ethics <b>approval</b> were <b>submitted</b> to Human Research Ethics Committees(HRECs) across four Australian states in November 2010. Three out of the five HREC applications required alterations. None of the HRECs acknowledged approvals from the other HRECs. The authors found {{there was a lack}} of appreciation and knowledge of qualitative research and, in particular, the phenomenological methodological approach whereby HRECs attempted to quantify the qualitative research methodology. The issues encountered created complexities for the researchers and delayed the commencement of the study. Our experience suggests that multisite studies are unduly delayed due to current HRECs methods of review. HRECs need to address the efficiency of their ethics approval practices through harmonising multisite ethical review processes enabling the recognition of a single ethics and scientific review with mandatory expedition to all subsequent HRECs.

40|$|As {{part of an}} {{initiative}} designed to modernize the clinical trial enterprise, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently published a regulation establishing a new safety-reporting paradigm for drugs being studied under investigational new drug applications (INDs). 1 This rule — published last September and effective as of March 28, 2011 — is {{one in a series}} of steps the FDA is taking to enhance the protection of human subjects and improve trial conduct by streamlining the regulatory procedures for clinical trials. Monitoring patient safety during clinical trials is a critical component of the drug-development process. Such monitoring is a dynamic process intended to protect trial volunteers from preventable harm. It depends on observant investigators, responsible analysis by trial sponsors, and prompt reporting to the FDA, all investigators, and institutional review boards (IRBs) of serious new adverse reactions. Although safety databases are scrutinized when <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> marketing <b>approval</b> are <b>submitted,</b> ongoing safety analyses during trials are critical in ensuring that serious adverse events are discovered as soon as possible. Safety data from ongoing clinical trials influence the clinical care of patients enrolled in those and other trials of a given drug; if the drug is already on the market, these data may affect its clinical use. Safety reports derived from ongoing clinical trials must be meaningful, relevant, and amenable to timely analysis. The new regulation clarifies the responsibilities of clinical investigators and IND sponsors with respect to the reporting and analysis of serious, unexpected events that are suspected to be caused by the drug. Because the FDA’s previous safety...|$|R

Currently, standard therapy consists of parenteral anticoagulation followed by a vitamin K antagonist (VKA). The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) differ from VKAs, which overcome some {{of the limitations of}} VKAs and have practical implications on their use in clinical situations. Dabigatran is a prodrug that undergoes primarily renal elimination and does not affect cytochrome P 450 enzymes. Assays to quantify the degree of anticoagulation and the therapeutic level of DOAC are either unavailable for routine clinical use or require specific calibration. Routine monitoring of DOACs is not recommended at this time. Dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban are DOACs that have been studied for treatment of venous thromboembolism. Clinical trials comparing DOACs with standard therapy have shown them to be non-inferior for acute and extended therapy. Each DOAC has a unique benefit and harm profile that should be considered prior to use. The distinguishing characteristics of dabigatran include a requirement of parenteral anticoagulation prior to acute treatment, clinical trial results comparing it with a VKA for extended treatment, association with upper gastrointestinal adverse events, and increased risk of gastrointestinal bleed. Rivaroxaban is the only DOAC that has once-daily dosing while apixaban is the only DOAC that has lower risk of overall, major, and gastrointestinal bleeding compared with VKA. A common drawback of DOACs is the lack of an available reversal agent. Clinical trials of reversal agents are ongoing and one <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>approval</b> has been <b>submitted</b> to the US Food and Drug Administration. Selection of a DOAC for acute and extended therapy requires a shared decision-making approach that includes a comprehensive assessment of the benefits and harms of each individual DOAC.
