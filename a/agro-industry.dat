40|$|This {{research}} was commenced {{with the objective}} of identifying the major challenges and opportunities on the development of sustainable vegetable <b>agro-industries</b> in the National Regional State of Tigray. There is unexploited capacity on the production of vegetables that can provide sufficient inputs for vegetable <b>agro-industries</b> and both the amount of area coverage and yield per hectare of vegetable production are increasing {{from time to time in}} the region. However, there are not vegetable <b>agro-industries</b> that could transform the vegetable production sector and enhance the income of growers. Hence, a research is required to answer the question why there are not vegetable <b>agro-industries</b> in the region. One way of answering this question is to detect the major challenges and opportunities on the development of such industries. As a result, this thesis has detected some challenges and opportunities taking the case of Enderta wereda through applying key informants method of data collection. Since the data collected are qualitative, the data analysis is performed in such a way that the researcher first edited the data to ensure the completeness, consistency and meaningfulness and then interpreted them based on the literature on hand. Some of the challenges detected by this research are increasing price and scarcity of agricultural inputs, weak rural infrastructure, low attitude of investors, and lack of capital and expertise. The ongoing increase in vegetable products, favorable policy environment and increasing demand for processed vegetables are some of the identified opportunities. Finally, the researcher recommended that the current increase in the production of different vegetables should keep on by incorporating quality controlling mechanisms so that sustainable supply of raw materials could be assured for the intended vegetable agro-industries; the development of vegetable <b>agro-industries</b> should be in a sustainable way so that they offer permanent employment, generate income tax and profit for the concerned stake holders; and the development of vegetable <b>agro-industries</b> must be environmental friendly...|$|R
40|$|<b>Agro-industries</b> seem as an {{alternative}} to development to Sergipe semi-arid region that has to cope with the social and economic difficulties of local population and the climatic adversities as well. This study has the objective to identify the profile, management practices and the environmental management of <b>agro-industries</b> in Sergipe semi-arid region. Its data were collected both from secondary and primary sources such as structured personal interviews accomplished together with business owners and managers. From the universe of <b>agro-industries</b> of that region, a sample of forty-eight industries was selected, adopting non-proportional and non-probabilistic sampling criteria. As the main results of the study, it can be highlighted that the majority of these industries were of micro and small size and most were recently created, with predominance of manioc and diary products. In relation to management practices it was observed that there is no sanitary control of production, employment of temporary manpower in the harvest time, low sales competitiveness, and no costs control efficiently. Regarding the environmental management it was observed a low level of awareness related to the adoption of management practices that could guarantee a business sustained growth.

40|$|The present article {{explores the}} origin and changes in {{partnership}} agreements established between <b>agro-industries</b> and oil palm smallholders in Cameroon. The different forms of partnership which have existed {{over the years in}} the oil palm sector until now are assessed, notably the FONADER-sponsored smallholder scheme (1978 to 1991) and more recently the Afriland First Bank sponsored villagisation project of Socapalm Eseka (2007 / 2008 to present). Special attention is given to the factors and conditions that have influenced the outcomes of these partnerships, specifically the failure of the FONADER-sponsored smallholder scheme. The authors conclude that with the current absence of steady support from the government to oil palm smallholders, especially after the implementation of the structural adjustment plans, private partnership schemes between <b>agro-industries</b> and oil palm smallholders could be highly profitable for both stakeholders. Such partnerships can foster social cohesion and limit further encroachment of <b>agro-industries</b> into the primary forest, provided such partnership agreements are carefully planned and adequately implemented...|$|R
