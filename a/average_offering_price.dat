30|$|The {{studies of}} initial public <b>offering</b> <b>pricing</b> {{had been a}} popular {{interest}} of academic research recently, {{but there is still}} little study for entrepreneurial firms now. Under the asymmetric information hypothesis and signaling theory, we try to find some factors affecting the initial public <b>offering</b> <b>pricing</b> of entrepreneurial firms. Based on the 153 listed firms on China's Growth Enterprise Market, we do an empirical test for the correlation between initial public <b>offering</b> <b>pricing</b> and board of director independency, top management team ownership, venture capital existence, and reputation of underwriter. Finally, some research hypotheses are verified. As a result, we find that the top management team's ownership is significantly correlated to initial public <b>offering</b> <b>pricing</b> which means that the top management team plays a more important role in pricing of entrepreneurial firms as an insider, compared to board of director independency as an outsider's role. Also, we find that venture capital backing is significantly correlated to initial public <b>offering</b> <b>pricing</b> while underwriter reputation is not, which means that venture capital plays a more important role in pricing of entrepreneurial firms as an insider after it invested, compared to underwriter as an outsider.|$|R
40|$|There seem to {{be little}} discussions on the {{influences}} of different underwriting mechanisms on <b>offering</b> <b>prices.</b> Under different underwriting mechanisms, the issuer, the investment bank and the investor will consider the <b>offering</b> <b>prices</b> based on his own benefit. As a result, the <b>offering</b> <b>price</b> is affected by different underwriting mechanisms. In China, most of the stock IPO {{takes the form of}} stand-by underwriting. Because of the huge demand on the new share issue from Chinese investors, the investment bank almost has not unsold stocks to underwrite. Therefore, there is no big difference in the risk that the investment bank faces between the firm commitment underwriting and best-effort underwriting. As a result, when the Chinese investment bank is allowed to participate in the procedure of <b>pricing</b> <b>offering</b> <b>price,</b> the pricing behavior of the investment bank has no big difference in the two risk- similar mechanisms. Considering different advantage and suitability of different mechanisms, China needs to change the single underwriting mechanism situation and encourage the practice of the firm commitment underwriting mechanism...|$|R

40|$|Asset exchanges, such as {{mergers and}} acquisitions, {{typically}} {{give rise to}} abnormal returns. This dissertation tests a fads hypothesis for abnormal returns on initial public offerings, an asset exchange in which traders exchange cash for issuers' new shares. Initial public offerings, or IPOs, exhibit positive abnormal returns on {{the date of the}} exchange when trading prices, on <b>average,</b> rise above <b>offering</b> <b>prices.</b> IPOs also exhibit negative abnormal returns after the exchange as trading prices, on average, fall relative to those on comparable-risk assets. In the fads hypothesis, IPOs occur when a fad, or mass psychogical movement, induces traders to bid the trading prices of certain types of assets up over their intrinsic prices. These high trading prices offer a quasi-arbitrage opportunity that motivates unaffected traders to short-sell seasoned shares affected by the fad or issue new shares based on like assets. For the fads hypothesis to explain abnormal returns on IPOs, fads among traders must allow price bubbles to persist long enough for rational traders to issue IPOs, and rational traders must actually do so. This dissertation's experimental spot asset double auction markets show that the duration of price booms, or rising differences between trading prices and intrinsic prices, significantly increases with an increase in asset life, suggesting that differences between trading prices and intrinsic prices can persist. This laboratory finding parallels field findings that closed-end fund trading prices only converge to net asset values (an intrinsic price proxy) when secondary trading ceases due to merger, liquidation or open-ending. This finding is consistent with bubbles persisting long enough for quasi-arbitrage responses. This dissertation also shows that an apparent fad in closed-end country funds led issuers and underwriters to organize an extraordinary number of IPOs in late 1989 and early 1990. These issuers profited by promising to purchase assets at net asset values and selling shares based on that promise at a premium. The shares issued during this apparent fad had positive abnormal returns in their initial rise from <b>offering</b> <b>prices</b> to trading prices, and subsequently had negative abnormal returns as their premium trading prices fell to discounts. This closed-end country fund findings are consistent with the fads hypothesis of abnormal returns on IPO asset exchanges...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explain why the investors would like to {{purchase}} the stocks of IPO firms. The prior studies show that those IPO firms often do earnings management to make their IPO process easier or get a better <b>offering</b> <b>price.</b> This phenomenon is not unusual. For the investors, therefore, there must be a motivation to buy the IPO stocks even if they have known the earning data and <b>offering</b> <b>price</b> of IPO firms are unreliable by any possibility. This paper use a rational expectation model with a output boundary to analyze the investors' behavior, and we find that, a) in order to reduce the cost of investment, the investors will restore the earnings management, the IPO firms won't be able to cheat them; and, b) when there is asymmetric information between the IPO firms and the investors, the <b>offering</b> <b>price</b> will be underpriced if the earnings management exists. 近年來的國內外數起公司金融弊案，引起了投資人對公司做盈餘管理的重視。而從初次公開發行的相關文獻，發現新上市公司更是普遍存在做盈餘管理的現象。由於新上市公司可能做盈餘管理，虛列公司的盈餘使公司可以上市，或是得到更高的承銷價，而投資人的背後一定有某種決策的動機，使得投資人願意去購買新上市公司股票。本文透過投資人的理性預期及產出門檻的設計，其結果發現，在滿足公司的誘因條件下，公司做盈餘管理的動作，會被投資人給還原，且投資人可以降低投資成本。此外，我們也發現，公司與投資人有資訊不對稱時，若公司做盈餘管理時，會有承銷價低估的現象。第一章	緒論	 1 第二章	文獻探討	 3 第一節 台灣的 IPOs制度	 3 第二節 盈餘管理的相關文獻	 7 第三節 IPOs 的相關文獻	 9 第三章	模型	 13 第一節 模型的設定	 13 第二節 沒有盈餘管理的均衡	 14 第三節 盈餘管理的均衡	 23 第四章	結論	 32 參考文獻… [...] 	 3...|$|R

Applying multi regression through Stata 11, a simple comprises 677 companies, which issued and listed their A shares on Shenzhen Stock Exchange and Shanghai Stock Exchange are collected from 2006 － 2010. Based on previous literatures, a linear regression model is established with one dependent variable initial return of IPO, and thirteen independent variables, including realized offering size, exchange rate, low-wining rate, tradable share ratio, underwriter reputation, area, industry, earning per share, asset liability ratio, <b>offering</b> <b>price,</b> <b>offering</b> P/E ratio, time gap {{and the age of}} issuer. The regression result shows that four of independent variables are statistically significant. The variable of exchange rate, tradable share ratio, underwriter reputation, industry, earning per share are positively correlative with the magnitude of IPO underpricing. The variable of realized offering size, low-wining rate, area, asset-liability ratio, <b>offering</b> <b>price,</b> <b>offering</b> P/E ratio and the age of issuer are negatively correlated with the magnitude of IPO underpricing. The variable of exchange rate, lot-winning rate, <b>offering</b> <b>price</b> ad <b>offering</b> P/E ratio assumed as the main factors affect to the initial return in new environment of China market.

40|$|Initial Public Offering (IPO) {{has been}} adopted by most firms when they are process of going public into the stock market. In most cases, the <b>offering</b> <b>price</b> of IPO is {{systematically}} lower than its closing price on the first trading day. Because of this, investors can enjoy great benefits by purchasing IPOs on the first trading day and sell them on the second trading day or few trading days later. This phenomenon is called IPO under-pricing {{and it has been}} extensively documented in almost every stock market. This paper first reviews the U. S. IPO market. Then, reasons of IPO under-pricing based on several important IPO literatures are explained. Finally, a sample test to analyze the IPO under-pricing condition in U. S. NASDAQ will be carried out. This study examines 117 IPOs issued in the NASDAQ Global Market in 2007. The average under-pricing level is 15. 48 %. According to the regression result, it is found that 1) there is a significantly positive relationship between <b>offering</b> <b>price</b> and degree of IPO under-pricing; 2) there is a significantly positive/negative relationship between <b>offering</b> <b>price</b> adjustment and degree of IPO under-pricing; 3) there is a significantly negative relationship between economy crisis and degree of IPO under-pricing...|$|R

If they {{are able to}} buy back only some of the shares at or below the offer price (because the stock eventually rises higher than the offer price), then the underwriters would exercise a portion of greenshoe option to cover their remaining short position.

5000|$|When {{a public}} {{offering}} trades below its <b>offering</b> <b>price,</b> the <b>offering</b> {{is said to}} have [...] "broke issue" [...] or [...] "broke syndicate bid".

When the <b>offering</b> is <b>priced</b> and those 1.15 million shares are [...] "effective" [...] (become eligible for public trading), the underwriters are able to support and stabilize the <b>offering</b> <b>price</b> bid (also known as the [...] "syndicate bid") by buying back the extra 15% of shares (150,000 shares in this example) in the market at or below the offer price.
