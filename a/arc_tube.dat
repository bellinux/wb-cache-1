Like self-ballasted mercury-vapor lamps, self-ballasted metal-halide lamps are connected directly to mains power and do not require an external ballast.

50|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} {{a new type}} of metal-halide lamp was developed, which, instead of a quartz (fused silica) <b>arc</b> <b>tube</b> as used in mercury vapor lamps and {{previous}} metal-halide lamp designs, use a sintered alumina <b>arc</b> <b>tube</b> similar to those used in the high pressure sodium lamp. This development reduces the effects of ion creep that plagues fused silica arc tubes. During their life, sodium and other elements tends to migrate into the quartz tube, because of high UV radiation and gas ionization, resulting in depletion of light emitting material that causes cycling. The sintered alumina <b>arc</b> <b>tube</b> does not allow the ions to creep through, maintaining a more constant colour {{over the life of the}} lamp. These are usually referred as ceramic metal-halide lamps or CMH lamps.|$|E

40|$|The light sources {{chosen for}} special study were <b>arc</b> <b>tubes</b> through which a {{condenser}} was discharged. The discharge was initiated by an external control electrode. Tubes {{were made of}} Pyrex or quartz and had cathodes of mercury or nickel. Work was first done with mercury tubes at low pressures.

Tubes were tested to see at what voltage they discharged spontaneously one hence {{if they could be}} used with the 20, 000 V power supply available. A 2500 V power supply was obtained for use with low voltage tubes. An integrating light output meter was constructed for measuring the light output of the tubes. Using this meter relative readings of the light output of tubes used under different conditions were obtained. Fine fibres were set up and illuminated in a manner reproducing conditions of cloud tracks in an expansion chamber. The fibres were then photographed to get an indication of whether the light sources would be practically useful, and of their effects on a photographic emulsion. Emperimental results indicate that low pressure <b>arc</b> <b>tubes</b> are not a practical means of obtaining high voltage operation, Mercury cathodes were shown to be little better than nickel ones in all types of tubes studied; and have the disadvantage of becoming dirty.

In order to improve our understanding of the observed phenomena and to help design electrodes for future lamps, a rotational symmetric two-dimensional electrode model has been created. The model is completely phase resolved so that time-dependent effects can be studied (both ac and dc). Furthermore, it contains various options for calculating the power input distribution, including a complex cathode sheath model as well as a simple anode model. The model has been shown to predict spot/diffuse transitions (in Hg-lamps with heavy electrodes/low currents) very similar to the behaviour seen in real lamps...|$|R
