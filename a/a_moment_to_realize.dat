Lisa Marie, reviewer for RightStuf's Anime Today podcast, agrees that others, notably males, might see the series as shōjo. Luther calls the first DVD [...] "the perfect back-to-school accessory", while Marie characterizes School Rumble as [...] "insane", asserting it appears on the surface more laid back than other titles like Excel Saga and Haré + Guu. However, it uses its [...] "cast to breakevery rule of reality, but it plays everything so straight [...] it takes you <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> what just happened doesn't make any sense." [...] A fan of the subgenre, she praises the anime it for its surreal humour, and for being [...] "anime newbie friendly" [...] in that its jokes work on multiple levels. Not all are of Japanese origin—such as a reference to the long triangular resolution of Star Wars Return of the Jedi—giving the series broad appeal.|$|E

They needed another to divine that Carroll had anticipated Kane's intention to bunt, had left his position as the ball was pitched, had planned all, risked all, played all on Kane's sure eye; and so he had retired the side and won the game by creating and executing the rarest play in baseball.|$|R
60|$|Only {{when she}} went to her own room to dress, had she <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> the catastrophe, its consequences, and the means of averting them. So appalled was she, that she sat with her hair on her {{shoulders}} as if spell-bound, till the first ring at the door aroused her to speed and consternation, perhaps a little lessened by one of her sisters rushing in {{to say that it was}} Mrs. Ledwich and Mrs. Pugh, and that Henry was still in the cellar, decanting the wine.|$|E
6000|$|... --Now let us try for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize,</b> {{as far as}} we can, {{the nature}} of that abode of the damned which the justice of an {{offended}} God has called into existence for the eternal punishment of sinners. Hell is a strait and dark and foul-smelling prison, an abode of demons and lost souls, filled with fire and smoke. The straitness of this prison house is expressly designed by God to punish those who refused to be bound by His laws. In earthly prisons the poor captive has at least some liberty of movement, were it only within the four walls of his cell or in the gloomy yard of his prison. Not so in hell. There, by reason of the great number of the damned, the prisoners are heaped together in their awful prison, the walls of which are said to be four thousand miles thick: and the damned are so utterly bound and helpless that, as a blessed saint, saint Anselm, writes in his book on similitudes, they are not even able to remove from the eye a worm that gnaws it.|$|E

Just as Daniel's {{daughter}} Lara jumps into his arms, attempting {{to protect him}} with the [...] "invisible cloak", Daniel's wife Elizabeth (Karina Arroyave) runs {{out the front door}} and watches in horror as Farhad shoots Lara. It takes the grief-stricken parents and Farhad <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> that Lara is miraculously unharmed. The box of ammunition that Dorri had selected contained blanks. Farhad later tells his daughter that he believes the little girl was his guardian angel, preventing him from committing a terrible crime. Jean is complaining to someone she knows over the phone that she wakes up angry every day and does not know why. Immediately afterwards, she slips and falls down a flight of stairs, spraining her ankle. Jean phones Rick, telling him of her accident.|$|E
5000|$|When it is {{understood}} that the ancient Irish sagas record, even though it be in {{a more or less}} distorted fashion, in some cases reminiscences of a past mythology, and in others real historical events, dating from the pagan times, then it needs only <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> reflection <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> their value. Zimmer writes that nothing except a spurious criticism that [...] "...takes for original and primitive the most palpable nonsense of which Middle-Irish writers from the Twelfth to the Sixteenth century are guilty with regard to their own antiquity, which is in many respects strange and foreign to them, nothing but such a criticism can on the other hand make the attempt to doubt of the historical character of the chief persons of the saga cycles. For we believe that Méve, Conor MacNessa, Cuchulainn, and Fionn mac Cumhaill (Cool) are just as much historical personalities as Arminius or Dietrich of Berne or Etzel, and their date is just as well determined." [...] (Kelt. Studien, fasc. ii, 189.) The first three of these lived in the 1st century BC, and Finn in the 2nd or 3rd century. D'Arbois de Jubainville expresses himself to the same effect. [...] "We have no reason", he writes, [...] "to doubt the reality of the principal rôle in this of Cuchulainn" [...] (Introduction à l'étude de la littérature celtique, 217); and of the story of the Boru tribute imposed on Leinster in the 1st century he writes: [...] "The story has real facts for a basis though certain details may have been created by the imagination"; and again, [...] "Irish epic story, barbarous though it be, is, like Irish law, a monument of a civilization far superior to that of the most ancient Germans" [...] (L'épopée celtique en Irlande, preface, p. xli.).|$|R

50|$|On August 12, 2000 while {{a member}} of the Mets, Agbayani was {{involved}} in a particularly memorable play. In the fourth inning, with the Mets leading 1-0, the Giants loaded the bases after a double, an error, and a hit batsman. With one out, Giants catcher Bobby Estalella hit a fly pop to Agbayani in left field. Agbayani, thinking that the catch made three outs, gave the ball to a child in the stands and began to trot toward the dugout. It took him <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> his mistake, but once he did, he sprinted back to the stands, pulled the ball from the hands of the young fan he had given it to, and fired a throw toward home plate. Unfortunately for Agbayani, once the ball left the field, the play was dead, and all three runners were awarded two bases—causing Jeff Kent and Ellis Burks to score, and the Giants to take the lead, 2-1. The Mets {{went on to win the}} game, 3-2, and Agbayani gave another ball to the fan who had given the previous one back.|$|E
50|$|The next day, Grace Makutsi seeks a new job, {{having the}} name of an {{employment}} agency in hand. She is startled to meet her nemesis, Violet Sephoto, as the “head hunter” looking to fill positions for experienced secretaries. There is no chance of a good position from her sarcastic, one-time classmate, which gives Grace Makutsi <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> how much she likes her work at the Detective Agency. She takes a cab there, arriving mid-morning. Mma Ramotswe is glad to see her back again. She promotes her to associate detective, meaning she can handle a case from first interview through to the end. The next day, a client will be arriving while Mma Ramotswe will be in Mochudi to make progress on the hospital’s case. Grace Makutsi meets Teenie Magama, who knows an employee is stealing from her printing business, and needs proof. That evening, Phuti Radiphuti gives Grace an engagement ring, a diamond from Botswana. He is pleased that Grace did not get another job, as he knows how much Mma Ramotswe relies on her.|$|E

40|$|I met Larry Tribe in 1997 at {{a dinner}} party in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Tointroduce me to her colleagues, Harvard Professor Martha Minow asked me which of the University 2 ̆ 7 s {{scholars}} I would like to invite to my ideal dinner. As a newly minted professor, it took me <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> this was not an interview question, but her characteristically generous attempt to construct a guest list. I asked for Larry Tribe and Helen Vendler. I had been lucky enough to take a seminar on modem poetry with Vendler as an undergraduate at Harvard. But neither Vendler nor I had met Tribe before. At one point in the evening, someone mentioned Vendler 2 ̆ 7 s book on the odes ofJohn Keats. 1 Tribe mused aloud about who John Keats might have grown up to be if he had lived past the age of twenty-six. (This off-hand reference to how old Keats was when he died was my first experience of Tribe 2 ̆ 7 s intellectual range and photographic memory.) 2 ̆ 2 I think he would have grown up to be James Merrill, 2 ̆ 2 Vendler replied. I saw Tribe look up at her as she issued this extraordinary pronouncement. James Merrill, after all, was still alive. I thought each recognized a kindred spirit. She was forging the literary canon as he was forging the legal one. I felt I was in the presence of greatness...|$|E

40|$|The {{failure of}} socialist {{revolution}} in Western Europe is {{often viewed as}} the key to understanding Adorno's diagnosis of modern society.

Socialist revolution, which might have overcome the irrationality of the existing bourgeois order and established a rational world, failed to materialize.
