25|$|According to Harry A. Poeze, Malaka {{assumed that}} the colonial {{government}} used the educational system to produce educated indigenous people who would repress their own people. Malaka founded Sekolah Sarekat Islam to rival the government schools. Syaifudin writes that Malaka had four different methods of teaching: dialog, jembatan keledai, critical discussion, and sociodrama. In dialog method, Malaka used two-way communication while teaching. During his time teaching in Deli, he encouraged students to criticize their teacher, or the Dutchman, who was often wrong. In the SI school, he entrusted students who received higher grades to teach students with lower grades. Jembatan keledai was inspired by al-Ghazali; in addition to memorizing knowledge, the students were instructed to understand <b>and</b> <b>apply</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> their daily lives. Syaifudin writes {{that it is the}} opposite of bank style concept, and that it is similar to contextual teaching and learning. On critical discussion, Malaka not only verbally gave a problem to the students, but attempted to expose the problem directly, a method is similar to the problem-posing method of Paulo Freire.|$|E
25|$|Foragers first go {{in search}} of water, which they collect in {{multiple}} trips. This water is then regurgitated {{on the surface of}} the nest material (typically plant fibers). The water serves as a type of glue, adhering the fibers of the nest material, beginning the formation of a ball. The water also serves to moisten and soften the fibers of the pulp so it is easier to manipulate for the formation of the nest. Using their mandibles, the foraging wasps remove the plant fibers (pulp) from its surface. This forms a ball of pulp, and the wasp will move around the immediate area in order to collect enough pulp (a ball that is about the size of its head, 2–4mm). This collection process only takes a few minutes. At this point, the forager returns to the nest, carrying the pulp mass. Either the forager or the queen wasp will take the pulp <b>and</b> <b>apply</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the growing nest. The forager repeats this process multiple times in a day, usually for many hours. Interestingly, there is evidence that foragers collect the same foraging material on each trip. In nests that are made out of materials with distinct colors, researchers found that each forager collected only one of the colors in the nest, creating a colorful nest.|$|E

500|$|Speaking in a 2003 {{television}} documentary about Nigel Kneale's career, {{the writer and}} critic Kim Newman praised the underlying themes of Quatermass II, and their particular relevance to the British way of life. [...] "Quatermass II is the British Invasion of the Bodysnatchers, but I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing... What Quatermass II does is take that metaphor <b>and</b> <b>apply</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the specific conditions of Britain in the 1950s; not just the Cold War paranoia, but the traditional British grumbling resentment of bureaucracy as represented by the council, {{or in this case}} big business." [...] The British Film Institute's [...] "Screenonline" [...] website also offers praise in its analysis of the serial."With its tale of an invasion by an invisible enemy indistinguishable from ourselves, Kneale's story tapped into contemporary fears about the 'red' (i.e. communist) threat, although in a less direct way than the American science fiction films of the 1950s, including Invasion of the Body Snatchers. At the same time, it reflected the widespread anxiety of the nuclear age — the story begins with a failed test of a nuclear-powered rocket in Australia (at a time when the country was in reality a site for a series of British nuclear weapons tests). In short, Quatermass II was the perfect cold-war drama." ...|$|E

2500|$|Young Earth creationists {{generally}} hold that, when Genesis {{describes the}} creation of the Earth occurring over a period of days, this indicates normal-length 24 hour days, and cannot reasonably be interpreted otherwise. They agree that the Hebrew word for [...] "day" [...] (yôm) can refer to either a 24-hour day or a long or unspecified time; but argue that, whenever the latter interpretation is used, it includes a preposition defining the long or unspecified period. In the specific context of Genesis 1, since the days are both numbered and are referred to as [...] "evening and morning", this can mean only normal-length days. Further, they argue that the 24-hour day is the only interpretation that makes sense of the Sabbath command in Exodus 20:8–11. YECs argue that it is a glaring exegetical fallacy to take a meaning from one context (yom referring to {{a long period of time}} in Genesis 1) <b>and</b> <b>apply</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> a completely different one (yom referring to normal-length days in Exodus 20).|$|E

The following month, on February 2, 2006, the Oakville winery was devastated by a fire which destroyed the dairy barn, the original structure on the property. At {{the time of}} the fire, the Duncan Family decided to rebuild the Oakville winery from the ground up. The rebuild began in 2007 and was completed in October 2008. President and CEO David Duncan said {{at the opening of the}} new Silver Oak Oakville winery, [...] "Though the fire was devastating, it presented us with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. We were able to take 35 years of experience in winemaking and hospitality <b>and</b> <b>apply</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> create an ideal space for making our Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon and entertaining our guests." [...] David Duncan said, [...] "The new winery is a winemaker's dream. We incorporated all the technological advancements of recent years into the winery's design but made sure we could accommodate changes down the line." [...] The rebuild included using some 550 tons of reclaimed stone from a 115-year-old dismantled mill in Coffeyville, Kansas, installing 1,464 solar panels to generate solar power for the facility, elevating the property 4.5 feet above the flood plain and moving their iconic water tower 12 feet. The Duncan Family was able to salvage the two stained glass windows in the original winery that had been created by local artist Diane Peterson in the theme of the Napa Valley. With the rebuild of the winery, they asked Diane Peterson to create two new stained glass windows. [...] Together, the windows represent the four seasons. In the tasting room, adjacent to the new tasting bar, built from white oak which had previously been a barn in Missouri, is a glass-house library displaying Silver Oak wines dating back to the 1970s.|$|E

Advancing social conditions compelled men into degeneration. Mungan-ngaur is, so far, in line with our own ideas of divinity {{because he is not}} localised. He dwelleth not in temples made with hands; it is not likely that he should, when his worshippers have neither house, tent, nor tabernacle. As Mr. Robertson Smith says, 'where the God had a house or a temple, we recognise the work of men who were no longer pure nomads, but had begun to form fixed homes.' By the nature of Australian society, a deity could not be tied to a temple, and temple-ritual, and consequent myths to explain that ritual, could not arise. Nor could Darumulun be attached to a district, just as 'the nomad Arabs could not assimilate the conception of a god as a land-owner, <b>and</b> <b>apply</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> their own tribal deities, {{for the simple reason that}} in the desert private property in land was unknown.'[8] ...|$|E
60|$|After this {{flush of}} heroic mood, however, the glow subsided, and poor Septimius {{spent the rest}} of the day, as was his wont, poring over his books, in which all the {{meanings}} seemed dead and mouldy, and like pressed leaves (some of which dropped out of the books as he opened them), brown, brittle, sapless; so even the thoughts, which when the writers had gathered them seemed to them so brightly colored and full of life. Then he began to see that there must have been some principle of life left out of the book, so that these gathered thoughts lacked something that had given them their only value. Then he suspected that the way truly to live and answer the purposes of life was not to gather up thoughts into books, where they grew so dry, but to live and still be going about, full of green wisdom, ripening ever, not in maxims cut and dry, but a wisdom ready for daily occasions, like a living fountain; and that to be this, it was necessary to exist long on earth, drink in all its lessons, and not to die on the attainment of some smattering of truth; but to live all the more for that; <b>and</b> <b>apply</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> mankind and increase it thereby.|$|E
6000|$|... § 2. One {{numerous}} {{division of}} the reasoners who have treated social facts according to geometrical methods, not admitting any modification of one law by another, must for the present be left out of consideration, because in them this error is complicated with, and is the effect of, another fundamental misconception, of which we have already taken some notice, and which will be further treated of before we conclude. I speak of those who deduce political conclusions not from laws of nature, not from sequences of phenomena, real or imaginary, but from unbending practical maxims. Such, for example, are all who found their theory of politics on what is called abstract right, that is to say, on universal precepts; a pretension of which we have already noticed the chimerical nature. Such, in like manner, are those who make the assumption of a social contract, or {{any other kind of}} original obligation, <b>and</b> <b>apply</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> particular cases by mere interpretation. But in this the fundamental error is the attempt to treat an art like a science, and to have a deductive art; the irrationality of which will be shown in a future chapter.
