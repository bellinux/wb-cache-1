5|$|The plates lie flat <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> as a shingle-like armor. This was Marsh's initial interpretation, {{which led}} to the name 'roof lizard'. As further and {{complete}} plates were found, their form showed they stood on edge, rather than lying flat.|$|E

5|$|All {{described}} {{specimens of}} Sinosauropteryx preserve integumentary structures (filaments {{arising from the}} skin) which most palaeontologists interpret as very primitive type of feathers. These short, down-like filaments are preserved <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> half of the skull, the arms, neck, back, and {{top and bottom of}} the tail. Additional patches of feathers have been identified {{on the sides of the}} body, and palaeontologists Chen, Dong and Zheng proposed that the density of the feathers on the back and the randomness of the patches elsewhere on the body indicated the animals would have been fully feathered in life, with the ventral feathers having been removed by decomposition.|$|E
5|$|The multifidus muscles run up {{and down}} <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the spine, and are {{important}} for keeping the spine straight and stable during many common movements such as sitting, walking and lifting. A problem with these muscles is often found in someone with chronic low back pain, because the back pain causes the person to use the back muscles improperly in trying to avoid the pain. The problem with the multifidus muscles continues even after the pain goes away, and is probably an important reason why the pain comes back. Teaching people with chronic low back pain how to use these muscles is recommended as part of a recovery program.|$|E

5|$|The olive baboon {{is named}} for its coat, which, at a distance, is a shade of green-grey. Its {{alternative}} name comes from the Egyptian god Anubis, who was often represented by a dog head resembling the dog-like muzzle of the baboon. At closer range, its coat is multicolored, due to rings of yellow-brown and black on the hairs. The hair on the baboon's face, however, is coarser and ranges from dark grey to black. This coloration is shared by both sexes, although males have a mane of longer hair that tapers down to ordinary length <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E
5|$|The skull {{had a pair}} of horns {{above and}} in front of the eyes. These horns were {{composed}} of extensions of the lacrimal bones, and varied in shape and size. There were also lower paired ridges running along the top edges of the nasal bones that led into the horns. The horns were probably covered in a keratin sheath and may have had a variety of functions, including acting as sunshades for the eye, being used for display, and being used in combat against other members of the same species (although they were fragile). There was a ridge <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the skull roof for muscle attachment, as is also seen in tyrannosaurids.|$|E
5|$|At {{the northeastern}} terminus, the Baltimore Beltway was planned to extend {{southeast}} <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Back</b> River Neck peninsula and turn south {{to cross the}} river near the Essex Skypark Airport, heading towards an outer crossing of the Patapsco River. Part of this alignment was completed south of US 40 in 1972 with a further extension to MD 150 opening as the Southeast Freeway (designated MD 702) by 1975. However, the Baltimore Beltway was diverted to two freeways not planned {{to be part of}} it. The first was the Windlass Freeway (MD 149), a route planned to run from I-95 at Moravia Road northeast to Chase, paralleling US 40 to the south. The other freeway that was incorporated into the Baltimore Beltway was the Patapsco Freeway, a short connector from the Windlass Freeway southeast to the originally-planned Baltimore Beltway. Only the segment of the Windlass Freeway between MD 702 the planned intersection with the Patapsco Freeway south to MD 151 (North Point Boulevard) were constructed, opening to traffic in 1973.|$|E

5|$|Controversy {{regarding}} {{the identity of}} the filaments preserved in the first Sinosauropteryx specimen began almost immediately, as the team of scientists spent three days in Beijing examining the specimen under a microscope. The results of their studies (reported during a press conference at the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences on Thursday, April 24, 1997) were inconclusive; the team agreed that the structures preserved on Sinosauropteryx were not modern feathers, but suggested further research was required to discover their exact nature. Palaeontologist Alan Feduccia, who had not yet examined the specimen, wrote in Audubon Magazine that the structures of Sinosauropteryx (which he considered at the time to be a synonym of Compsognathus, as Compsognathus prima) were stiffening structures from a frill running <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> and that dinosaur palaeontologists were engaging in wishful thinking when equating the structures with feathers. Subsequent publications saw some of the team members disagreeing over {{the identity of the}} structures.|$|E
5|$|Distinct {{signs of}} sexual {{dimorphism}} {{are seen in}} the antelope. The male is considerably larger than the female. The females, as well as juveniles, have a rufous coat, whereas the males become yellowish grey or darker {{after the age of}} two years. The male has a prominent black crest of hair on the neck, but this feature is not well-developed in the female. One long white stripe runs <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> with 11–14 white stripes branching towards the sides. The chest has a central black stripe, and there is no throat beard. A black stripe runs from each eye to the nose and a white one from each eye to the centre of the dark face. A chevron is present between the eyes. The area around the lips is white, the throat has white patches, and two white spots appear {{on each side of the}} lower jaw. The underparts are completely white, while the slender legs are tawny and have black and white patches. The lesser kudu is characterised by large, rounded ears. Its tracks are similar to the greater kudu's. Females have four teats. The average lifespan is 10 years in the wild, and 15 years in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Hennig and Janensch, while {{grouping}} the dermal armour elements {{into four}} distinct types, recognised an apparently continuous change of shape among them, shorter and flatter plates {{at the front}} gradually merging into longer and more pointed spikes towards the rear, suggesting an uninterrupted distribution along the entire body, in fifteen pairs. Because each type of osteoderm was found in mirrored left and right versions, it seems probable that all types of osteoderms were distributed in two rows <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the animal, a marked contrast to the better-known North American Stegosaurus, which had one row of plates on the neck, trunk and tail, and two rows of spikes on the tail tip. There is one type of spike that differs from all others in being strongly, and not only slightly, asymmetrical, and having a very broad base. Because of bone morphology classic reconstructions {{placed it on the}} hips, at the iliac blade, while many recent reconstructions place it on the shoulder, because a similarly shaped spike is known to have existed on the shoulder in the Chinese stegosaurs Gigantspinosaurus and Huayangosaurus.|$|E

5|$|Running {{south along}} the Windlass Freeway, {{parallel}} to the Northeast Corridor, I-695, now narrowed to four lanes, turns west before making a sharp turn to the south, crossing over the railroad line twice. The road becomes the Patapsco Freeway and continues south to an interchange with MD 150 (Eastern Avenue) and MD 157 (Merritt Boulevard) near the Eastpoint Mall. A short distance later, I-695 comes to an interchange with MD 151 (North Point Boulevard). From here, the route continues southeast <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Back</b> River into residential and industrial Dundalk, interchanging with Cove Road. The route turns south, with the median briefly widening to include trees, before coming to another interchange with MD 151. Past MD 151, the Baltimore Beltway continues southwest through industrial areas, with maintenance switching to the Maryland Transportation Authority at the crossing of a CSX rail line. It comes to an interchange with MD 157 (Peninsula Expressway) and MD 158 (Bethlehem Boulevard) before heading west. The route runs past the Sparrows Point Industrial Complex before crossing over Bear Creek and interchanging with unsigned MD 695A (Broening Highway) south of the Dundalk Marine Terminal, with an eastbound exit and westbound entrance.|$|E
5|$|The next {{species of}} Stegosaurus {{to be named}} was S. marshi, by Frederick Lucas in 1901. Lucas {{reclassified}} this species in the new genus Hoplitosaurus later that year. Lucas also re-examined {{the issue of the}} life appearance of Stegosaurus, coming {{to the conclusion that the}} plates were arranged in pairs in two rows <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> arranged above the bases of the ribs. Lucas commissioned Charles R. Knight to produce a life restoration of S. ungulatus based on his new interpretation. However, the following year, Lucas wrote that he now believed the plates were probably attached in staggered rows. In 1910, Richard Swann Lull wrote that the alternating pattern seen in S. stenops was probably due to shifting of the skeleton after death. He led the construction of the first ever Stegosaurus skeletal mount at the Peabody Museum of Natural History, which was depicted with paired plates. In 1914, Charles Gilmore argued against Lull's interpretation, noting that several specimens of S. stenops, including the now-completely prepared holotype, preserved the plates in alternating rows near the peak of the back, and that there was no evidence of the plates having shifted relative to the body during fossilization. Gilmore and Lucas' interpretation became the generally accepted standard, and Lull's mount at the Peabody Museum was changed to reflect this in 1924.|$|E
5|$|The {{triangular}} pelvic fins {{are much}} longer than wide; adult males have claspers that extend past the pelvic fin rear tips. The broad and flattened tail is about a quarter longer than the disc and bears prominent skin folds along both sides. There are two dorsal fins of roughly equal size and shape, with the first originating over the rear tips of the pelvic fins. The tail terminates in a low caudal fin; the upper caudal fin lobe is somewhat angular, especially in adult males, while the lower lobe is rounded. The skin often bears creases and is devoid of dermal denticles. The Tasmanian numbfish is plain dark brown above, becoming lighter on the fins. The underside is white, sometimes with a few dark blotches. Many juveniles also exhibit a darker midline stripe <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> along with darker blotches over the disc and at the dorsal fin bases.|$|E
