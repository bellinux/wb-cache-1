50|$|Entranceway at Main Street at Westfield Road and Ivyhurst Road is a {{suburban}} residential subdivision entranceway built about 1920 by John Sattler. It {{is located on}} Main Street (New York State Route 5) {{in the town of}} Amherst within Erie County. It consists of stone posts, connecting quarter-height stone walls, and <b>accent</b> <b>light</b> fixtures located on either street corner.|$|E
50|$|Entranceway at Main Street at High Park Boulevard is a {{suburban}} residential subdivision entranceway built about 1916 by developer Charles S. Burkhardt. It {{is located on}} Main Street (New York State Route 5) at Eggertsville {{in the town of}} Amherst within Erie County. It consists of tall and short stone posts, corresponding quarter-height stone walls, and <b>accent</b> <b>light</b> fixtures set {{on either side of the}} streets' intersecting corners.|$|E
50|$|Overcoming speech impediments and {{sometimes}} paralyzing stage fright {{as a young}} man, Jouvet's first important association was with Jacques Copeau's Théâtre du Vieux-Colombier, beginning in 1913. Copeau's training included a varied and demanding schedule, regular exercise for agility and stamina, and pressing his cast and crew to invent theatrical effects in a bare-bones space. It was there Jouvet developed his considerable stagecraft skills, particularly makeup and lighting (he developed a kind of <b>accent</b> <b>light</b> named the jouvet). These years included a successful tour to the United States.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, topics of displaying, presentation, lighting, energy saving and {{issues related to the}} {{environment}} while selling the fresh food (fruits, vegetable, bakery products, meat) are becoming an important matter among traders. However, just bigger companies with transnational capital have devoted their attention to this issue yet. Generally, the energy costs make up 70 % of operating costs in retail stores where the cooling system and lighting are the most energy consuming. <b>Accent</b> <b>lighting</b> in modern retails is largely involved in the overall design and atmosphere in shops and plays a crucial role in presenting the goods as well. Using of <b>accent</b> <b>lighting</b> can draw the customer's attention to a specific part of the sales area and achieve the overall harmonization in the store. With the rational using of combination of energy saving and effective <b>accent</b> <b>lighting</b> retailers can achieve not only attractive presentation of displayed products but also appreciable savings in the operation of their stores. It is the only factor that can be exactly measured and controlled. Using a Colour and Lux Meters we found out the intensity and color temperature of <b>accent</b> <b>lighting</b> used in domestic and foreign retail chains for the different kinds of fresh food products. Based on the obtained values we have compiled graphs, which are showing visual comfort. We also identified different types of <b>accent</b> <b>lighting,</b> which we assigned to their impact on emotional involvement of consumers. The starting points were the tests we conducted in simulated laboratory conditions. While searching of a compromise between effective and energy efficient <b>accent</b> <b>lighting</b> we take into consideration consumers' emotional response as well as the annual electricity consumption of different types of light sources. At the end we recommend options for energy-efficient, effective and spectacular lighting while using the optimal number of light sources and their logical organization, automatic control as well as using energy-saving LED lights or practical skylights. Improvements in energy efficiency of technical equipments could reduce the operating costs for retailers as well as enhance the attractiveness of displayed goods and customer satisfaction and thereby increase their sales...|$|R
50|$|A lamp with {{night light}} is often {{configured}} {{so that one}} of the two sockets is a medium-base socket, considered to be the Main Lamp (under the lamp shade), and the other socket is a candelabra-base socket that is the night light or decorative <b>accent</b> <b>light.</b> The night light is usually placed somewhere on or inside the body of the lamp. In a typical set-up, the main lamp would have a 150 W medium-base bulb, and the night light would have 7 W candelabra bulb. The operation of the switch is still the same, such that the night light comes on, then the main lamp, then both together, then it goes back to off.|$|E
40|$|<b>ACCENT</b> (<b>LIGHT)</b> is a {{directional}} luminaire {{designed to}} highlight or spotlight objects. It can be recessed, surface mounted, or mounted to a pendant, stem, or track. ACCEPTANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR CODE COMPLIANCE is {{a description of}} test procedures in the Reference Nonresidential Appendices that includes equipment and systems to be tested, functions to be tested, conditions under which the test shall be performed, {{the scope of the}} tests, results to be obtained, and measurable criteria for acceptable performance. ACCESSIBLE is having access thereto, but which first may require removal or opening of access panels, doors, or similar obstructions. ACM See Alternative Calculation Method.

5000|$|Some <b>accent</b> <b>lights</b> aren't made {{to shine}} on a {{particular}} object, but are themselves {{a piece of art}} with a self-contained light source. Often made with Tiffany glass, these serve as a piece of functional decor for a home.|$|R
50|$|The company {{produces}} {{a range of}} glass pieces, including custom pendants, sconces, chandeliers and <b>accent</b> <b>lighting.</b> Pairpoint also produces barware, candlesticks, bookends, bowls and vases, {{as well as a}} line of controlled bubble ball door knobs. Pairpoint products are handmade in the US.|$|R
5000|$|Back <b>lights,</b> or <b>accent</b> <b>lighting,</b> {{serve the}} purpose of accentuating a subject. Typically a back light will {{separate}} a subject from a background. Examples would be a light shining onto a subject's hair to add a rim effect or shining onto a background to lift the tones of a background. There can be many <b>accent</b> <b>lights</b> in a shot, another example would be a spotlight on a handbag in a fashion shot. When used for separation, i.e. a hair-light, the light should not be more dominant than the main light for general use. Think {{in terms of a}} [...] "kiss of moonlight", rather than a [...] "strike of lightning", although there are no [...] "shoulds" [...] in photography and {{it is up to the}} photographer to decide on the authorship of their shot.|$|R
50|$|Tealights {{derive their}} name from {{their use in}} teapot warmers, but are also used as food warmers in general, e.g. fondue. They are a popular choice for votive candles. They are also {{suitable}} for <b>accent</b> <b>lighting</b> and for heating scented oil. Tealights may be set afloat on water for decorative effect.|$|R
50|$|The Bunshafts {{decorated}} their retreat {{primarily in}} off-whites with natural wood and glass and occasional red <b>accents.</b> <b>Lighting</b> {{was designed to}} highlight their art collection which included works by Pablo Picasso, Le Corbusier, Jack Youngerman, and Henry Moore as well as rocks with faces painted on them by Mrs Bunshaft.|$|R
50|$|Smart {{lighting}} is a lighting technology designed for energy efficiency. This may include high efficiency fixtures and automated controls that make adjustments based on {{conditions such as}} occupancy or daylight availability.

50|$|The {{concept of}} {{lighting}} Grozny mosque {{was made of}} three layers. First level - floodlighting, providing even illumination of the lower buildings and minarets. The second level - <b>accent</b> <b>lighting</b> of architectural elements of the building. The third level - festive lighting. This lighting solution allows you to visually raise {{the height of the}} minarets and make dynamic lighting the central dome.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, {{the entrances}} were renovated {{to include a}} more modern appearance, {{a fresh coat of}} paint was added {{throughout}} the mall, and additional <b>accent</b> <b>lighting</b> near the skylights was installed. The basic architecture remains the same with the same skylights and overall ceiling design original to the 1977 structure. Again that year, the mall added a TV area during the opening of Nordstrom.|$|R
40|$|Daylight and {{artificial}} light are two fundamentally different light sources. Daylight is constantly changing. It is dynamic in colour temperature, quantity, direction, ratio of diffuse and direct components, and intensity. These variations {{are determined by}} the position of the sun and the weather conditions. Being a point source, the sun produces direct <b>accent</b> <b>lighting</b> with an ever-changing direction, intensity and colour temperature because its position changes throughout the day...|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{relatively}} high cost per watt, LED lighting is most useful at very low powers, typically for lamp assemblies of under 10 W. LEDs are currently most useful and cost-effective in low power applications, such as nightlights and flashlights. Colored LEDs {{can also be used}} for <b>accent</b> <b>lighting,</b> such as for glass objects, and even in fake ice cubes for drinks at parties. They are also being increasingly used as holiday lighting.|$|R

The mathematical model {{that can be}} used to calculate the optical and geometrical parameters of extra narrow-angle spotlight have been developed. The two actual samples with output lens with the diameters 50 and 100 mm were developed and tested. The results of computer simulation and actual testing the spotlight samples were compared...|$|R
50|$|Winter {{accessories}} {{were introduced}} in 2011. In 2012 several new features were made available on the MY 2013: new optional Bentley-designed luxury bottle cooler and rear cabin storage area with space for two full-size Champagne bottles in a canted position, three hand‑blown and hand-cut lead crystal champagne flutes with white LED <b>accent</b> <b>lighting</b> (designed by David Redman of London), 21-inch five-spoke Sports alloy wheel, optional tinted glass sunroof in the front cabin.|$|R
50|$|The {{illuminated}} ceiling was once {{popular in the}} 1960s and 1970s but fell out of favor after the 1980s. This uses diffuser panels hung like a suspended ceiling below fluorescent lights, and is considered general lighting. Other forms include neon, which is not usually intended to illuminate anything else, but to actually be an artwork in itself. This would probably fall under <b>accent</b> <b>lighting,</b> though in a dark nightclub it could be considered general lighting.|$|R
50|$|The complex {{opened in}} 2003 as Qwest Center Omaha. It adopted its current name on July 15, 2011, {{as part of}} a $22 billion buyout of Qwest by CenturyLink (formerly CenturyTel). All signage, inside and outside, changed to conform to the new arena name and {{exterior}} <b>accent</b> <b>lighting</b> changed from blue to green. Work completed on December 20, 2011. The contract expires in 2018 and MECA is preparing to negotiate a new contract.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{analyzed}} the important of lighting in museum from three main aspects, environmental lighting. LED lighting {{can not only}} meet requirements of museum lighting, and also has advantage of protecting historical relics and intelligent energy saving. The dimming control of <b>accent</b> <b>lighting</b> is achieved by infrared detection, distance detection of visitor and exhibits. Intelligent lighting and bionic controlling improve the intelligent level of exhibition, protect historical relics effectively, reflect the topic of energy saving and environmental protection...|$|R
40|$|This project aims {{to analyse}} the factors {{affecting}} the visual perception of painted artworks displayed in museum settings and to establish, through a survey, {{whether there is}} a preference pattern for the observers. The study was conducted at the Light & Lighting Laboratory of KU Leuven Technology Campus Gent and it investigated the influence of three factors: the Correlated Colour Temperature (CCT) of a LED spotlight, used as <b>accent</b> <b>lighting</b> on the paintings, the lightness of the background and the overall hue content of the paintings...|$|R
50|$|Analysis {{of capital}} {{expenditures}} {{is used to}} determine appropriate asset classifications. Cost segregation identifies building costs that would typically be depreciated over a 27.5 or 39-year period and reclassifies them to permit a shorter, accelerated method of depreciation for certain building costs. Costs for non-structural elements, such as wall covering, carpet, <b>accent</b> <b>lighting,</b> portions of the electrical system, and exterior site improvements such as sidewalks and landscaping, can often be depreciated over five, seven or 15 years, rather than over 27.5 or 39 years.|$|R
50|$|On 5 September, {{coinciding with}} the return of Reid and Morgan, there was a refresh, with some minor changes made to the set, such as a new {{modified}} desk with new lighting and a perspex glass top. Furthermore, the wood panelling was replaced with white panels in the sofa area and weather area, with the latter receiving a new weather screen. The studio's <b>accent</b> <b>lighting</b> was also changed from orange to yellow. Graphic changes were also made, with a new over the shoulder graphic as well as a new Coming Up screen.|$|R
5000|$|An LED Strip Light (also {{known as}} an LED tape or ribbon light) is a {{flexible}} circuit board populated by surface mounted light-emitting diodes (SMD LEDs) and other components that usually comes with an adhesive backing. Traditionally, strip lights had been used solely in <b>accent</b> <b>lighting,</b> backlighting, task lighting, and decorative lighting applications. Increased luminous efficacy and higher-power SMDs have allowed LED strip lights {{to be used in}} applications such as high brightness task lighting, fluorescent and halogen lighting fixture replacements, indirect lighting applications, Ultra Violet inspection during manufacturing processes, set and costume design, and even growing plants ...|$|R
5000|$|The pumps, filter, {{electrical}} switch box and plumbing controls are often {{housed in a}} [...] "plant room".Low-voltage lighting, typically 12 volt direct current, is used to minimise electrical hazards. Lighting is often submerged and must be suitably designed. High wattage lighting (incandescent and halogen) either as submerged <b>lighting</b> or <b>accent</b> <b>lighting</b> on waterwall fountains have been implicated in every documented Legionnaires' disease outbreak associated with fountains. This is detailed in the [...] "Guidelines for Control of Legionella in Ornamental Features".Floating fountains are also popular for ponds and lakes; they consist of a float pump nozzle and water chamber.|$|R
