50|$|In 1950, {{designer}} F.R. Bell and Chief Engineer Maurice Wilks from British car manufacturers Rover {{unveiled the}} first car powered with a gas turbine engine. The two-seater JET1 had the engine positioned behind the seats, <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>grilles</b> {{on either side of}} the car, and exhaust outlets on the top of the tail. During tests, the car reached top speeds of 140 km/h, at a turbine speed of 50,000 rpm. The car ran on petrol, paraffin (kerosene) or diesel oil, but fuel consumption problems proved insurmountable for a production car. It is on display at the London Science Museum.|$|R

5000|$|After {{twenty years}} of {{potential}} confusion with the French Talbot that name was dropped in 1954 and the final revision was badged Sunbeam instead. It was given much larger front <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>grilles</b> and three <b>air</b> outlet portholes just below each side {{at the back of}} the bonnet. The engine now developed , amazing compared to the [...] that the, admittedly smaller swept volume, very first 90 achieved. In the 1952 Alpine Rally cars won three Coupes des Alpes, Manufacturers Team Prize, 1st 2nd and third places in the 2 to 3-litre class and a special cup for an outstanding performance. A name had been found for a new model.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the then}} Government edict of [...] "Export or die" [...] and steel {{allocated}} {{only to those}} who generated much needed dollar revenue, the Atlantic was designed specifically to appeal to North American tastes (certain aspects look like a 1949 Mercury and the bonnet (hood) brightwork looks similar to the Pontiac Chieftains of this era). The car featured up-to-the-minute detailing, with a wrap around windscreen, composed of a flat glass centre section with, tiny curved end panels. The front wings (fenders) sported twin 'Flying A' hood ornaments and swept down to a rounded tail, with spats enclosing the rear wheels. A centrally mounted third, main beam, headlight was built into the letter-box style <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>grille,</b> and the then unheard of luxury of hydraulically powered windows and hood (convertible top), [...] "flashing indicators" [...] (blinkers) rather than trafficators, (for the United States market at least) and the option of EKCO or HMV Autocrat radios. The range-topping Austin was offered in a variety of [...] "jewelescent" [...] colours with names like 'seafoam green' and 'desert gold' but few of these brave new metallics were sold in the UK market. The convertible, a three window, drophead coupe had a simple fabric top, without rear quarter lights (opera windows), which butted up to the rear of a rather thick windscreen header rail. The fixed head, five window, Sports Saloon (hardtop), could be had with its roof painted or covered in fabric. This gave it the popular 'drophead or cabriolet' look; all the style with no leaks. Many photographs of this car are wrongly titled, due to observers confusing the fabric covered hardtop for a convertible. As its final party trick, the centre section of the three piece, wrap-around, rear window, could be lowered into the boot (trunk), for added ventilation by a remote winder above the front windscreen. Few people in the car's native Britain would have ever seen anything like the futuristically-styled Atlantic before, and certainly not from a conservative mainstream manufacturer like Austin. The radical Atlantic suffered, however, from the dramatically new Jaguar XK120, also launched at the 1948 Motor Show.|$|E

The car will be offered three trim options: ST1, ST2 and ST3; the same three options that were available with the MkII ST.|$|R
50|$|Both Manta {{versions}} {{received a}} facelift in 1982, {{which included a}} plastic front spoiler, sideskirts for the GT/E and GSi models, a small wing at the rear and quadruple <b>air</b> <b>intakes</b> on the <b>grille.</b> Also the 1.2-, 1.6- and 1.9-litre engines were discontinued and replaced by the 1.3-litre OHC engine, the 1.8-litre OHC and the 2.0-litre S and E CIH engines (although the 75 PS 1.9N continued to be available in a few markets). The GT/E was renamed and was called the GSi from 1983 (except in the UK where the GT/E name continued).|$|R

5000|$|Instead of the {{conventional}} electric motor arrangement, one motor per axle, the locomotive had a somewhat unconventional motor arrangement: two large electric motors, one for each bogie, placed {{on top of the}} bogies driving the three axles via an external gearbox. The class initially had a lot of teething problems affecting the battery, radiator and power train. The original French design could not withstand the severe Finnish climate. For instance, hoods had to be fitted in Finland to the <b>air</b> <b>intakes</b> and ventilation <b>grilles</b> on the roof to prevent snow from entering the engines. The locomotive weight was much higher than specified and the driving characteristics were not particularly good. Accordingly, careless driving could result in a bumpy ride on poor sections of track (hence the nickname of [...] "Hyppyheikki" [...] or [...] "Jumping Heikki"). Not all the problems were solved, but this did not detract from the usefulness of the class in trains that needed a lot of power.The last use of the class was pulling trains on the unelectrified line between Tampere and Turku. When the last Dr13s were withdrawn in June 2000, the class had completed almost 40 years service, and the youngest locomotives were 35 years old.

50|$|Most {{vehicles}} manufactured {{from the}} mid-1970s until the mid-1990s have thermostatic <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> systems that regulate {{the temperature of}} the air entering the engine's intake tract, providing warm air when the engine is cold and cold air when the engine is warm to maximize performance, efficiency, and fuel economy.

40|$|Abstract. The flow {{characteristics}} of an aerator inserted on the chute with a concave surface {{is more complex}} than that of on the straight chute. The area of the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> of the aerator is a very important factor which influences the cavity size of jet flow after the aerator, the air pressure in the cavity and air concentrations in high-speed flows along the chute. The present project focused on the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> of an aerator inserted on a model chute with a concave surface. How the area of the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> of the aerator and the radius of chute arc affect {{flow characteristics}} are investigated. The air pressure in the cavity was indirectly derived from the jet trajectory equation. It is demonstrated that the cavity length increases with, and the air pressure in it decreases with the increasing of the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> area at first, and then it remains unchangeable for a discharge even though the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> area continues to increase...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the current research was to analyze the flow through the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> system of 1. 6 L Proton Waja engine by adding guide vane. The pressure drop across the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> system {{is known to have}} a significant influence on the indicated power of the SI engine. The pressure drop along the intake system is proportional to the engine speed and cross sectional area. The guide vane is placed in the system to reduce the pressure drop across the system. It was found that the guide vane help to reduce pressure drop across the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> system where it increases the capabilities of air induction system to suck more air to the engine. The geometry of <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> system of Proton Waja 1. 6 L engine was used in the modeling approach. The study was focused on different engine speed. This analysis was done in CFD using a model setup with appropriate speed of the Proton Waja 1. 6 L engine from maximum speed to minimum speed.
