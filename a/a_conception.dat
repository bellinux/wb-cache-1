5|$|Æthelred usually {{acted with}} the {{permission}} of or in association with King Alfred, but occasionally he acted independently of him. Although sometimes described as plain dux or ealdorman, his status was clearly quite different from that of other duces, for he is also accorded styles which aspire to divine grace and which appear to verge on the royal. In other words, there is no mistaking that the Mercians retained <b>a</b> <b>conception</b> of their ruler as a rightful successor to earlier kings, and <b>a</b> <b>conception</b> of their land as a kingdom with its own identity; but there is also no mistaking that Æthelred moved in an Alfredian world.|$|E
5|$|After {{the rise}} of philosophy, history, prose and rationalism in the late 5th century BC, the fate of myth became uncertain, and mythological genealogies gave place to <b>a</b> <b>conception</b> of history which tried to exclude the supernatural (such as the Thucydidean history).

5|$|Most {{scholars}} on the stronger-sacramental end of {{the spectrum}} assess the sacraments as being of great importance to the evangelist. However, perhaps counterintuitively, some scholars who find fewer sacramental references, such as Udo Schnelle, view the references that they find as highly important as well. Schnelle in particular views John's sacramentalism as a counter to Docetist anti-sacramentalism. On the other hand, though he agrees that there are anti-Docetic passages, James Dunn views the absence of a Eucharistic institution narrative as evidence for an anti-sacramentalism in John, meant to warn against <b>a</b> <b>conception</b> of eternal life as dependent on physical ritual.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{examines}} a presupposed {{correlation between}} the way one look upon values and the way one look upon {{the will of the}} people in a theoretical democratic context. The more specific purpose is to test the following hypothesis: There is a reversed connection between the way one look upon values and the way one look upon {{the will of the people}} in a theoretical democratic context, that is; a strong claim of values give reason to <b>a</b> limited <b>conception</b> of the will of the people and a weak claim of values gives reason for <b>a</b> more unlimited <b>conception</b> of the will of the people. In order to test the hypothesis I examine three different conceptions of democracy, these are: pluralist democracy, deliberative democracy and constitutional democracy. I analyze the way they look upon values, there view of the will of the people and finally if there is a connection between the way they look upon values and the will of the people. Values should be understood in a metaethical context. In other words it is not values in the “common” meaning, instead its how val-ues in them selves should be understood, and even more relevant, what we mean when we ex-press values. My conclusions are, first and foremost, that there is a {{correlation between the}} will of the people and values, according to the formulation of the hypothesis. This leaves, for that specific issue, two alternatives; <b>a</b> weak <b>conception</b> of values with <b>a</b> strong <b>conception</b> of the will of the people, and, <b>a</b> strong <b>conception</b> of values with <b>a</b> weak <b>conception</b> of the will of the people. I also conclude that there are problems with both alternatives. <b>A</b> weak <b>conception</b> of values could result in moral diffi-culties, such as a majority oppresses a minority. And <b>a</b> strong <b>conception</b> of values could result in an excavation of democracy. <b>As</b> for the <b>conceptions</b> of democracy, I conclude that the pluralistic democracy has a relativistic view on values and an (more or less) unlimited conception of the will of the people. The delibera-tive democracy has <b>a</b> similar <b>conception</b> with <b>a</b> few exceptions. The constitutional democracy have <b>a</b> somewhat relativistic <b>conception</b> of values but with objectivistic elements, and hence <b>a</b> limited <b>conception</b> of the will of the people...|$|R

[...] Kierkegaard thinks, [...] "a true {{conception}} of life and of oneself {{is required for the}} resolution of marriage; but this already implies the second great requirement, which is just like the first: <b>a</b> true <b>conception</b> of God. No one can have <b>a</b> true <b>conception</b> of God without having <b>a</b> corresponding <b>conception</b> of life and oneself, or <b>a</b> true <b>conception</b> of life without <b>a</b> corresponding <b>conception</b> of God, or <b>a</b> true <b>conception</b> of life without <b>a</b> corresponding <b>conception</b> of oneself. But <b>a</b> true <b>conception</b> of God is required; an understanding between God and the happy one is required, and thus a language is required in which they talk to each other. This language is the resolution, the only language in which God will involve himself with a human being." [...] He asks, [...] "Where does a person find guidance if he himself does not work out his own soul's salvation in fear and trembling"? He's writing about the wedding ceremony in this discourse just as he wrote about it in Either/Or and Repetition. Here he presents his own imaginative construction {{of the value of the}} single individual making a decision about marriage in the presence of God.

But such <b>a</b> <b>conception</b> of happiness Nietzsche rejected as something limited to, and characteristic of, the bourgeois lifestyle of the English society, and instead put forth the idea that happiness is not an aim per se—it is instead a consequence of a successful pursuit of one's aims, of the overcoming of hurdles to one's actions—in other words, of the fulfillment of the will.|$|E
