500|$|Next was Psychosis facing SmackDown! superstar and ECW Original Rey Mysterio, Jr. Mysterio won {{the match}} at the seven-minute mark after {{delivering}} a 619, {{followed by the}} West Coast Pop. The two later revealed that they were disappointed with the way their match panned out. After the contest, the SmackDown! crusaders entered the Hammerstein Ballroom. They consisted of Kurt Angle, JBL and his Cabinet, Carlito and Matt Morgan. The crowd chanted, [...] "You Suck Dick" [...] and [...] "Fuck You SmackDown!" [...] {{as they entered the}} arena. Joel Gertner attempted to interview the invaders, but Angle took the microphone out of his hand and JBL pushed him to the ground. JBL and <b>Angle</b> <b>cut</b> a promo, with the crowd continuing to chant, [...] "You Suck Dick", to which Angle replied [...] with [...] "Your MOTHER taught me how". Angle stated, [...] "The last time I was at an ECW event I walked out halfway through because it sucked" [...] (referring to the time Sandman was crucified). The crowd continued to chant, [...] "Shut the Fuck Up", while JBL spoke.|$|E

50|$|The ejector of the 92G-SD had an <b>angle</b> <b>cut</b> into it {{to eject}} the empty brass {{to the right}} side of the gun. The {{engineering}} of the 96G-SD would not allow this design of the ejector, so occasionally a brass would be ejected in a back direction.|$|E
5000|$|A backsaw {{is often}} used in {{combination}} with a mitre box to produce precisely <b>angled</b> <b>cuts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Medeco's {{patented}} {{lock design}} requires the <b>angled</b> <b>cuts</b> {{of a key}} to elevate and rotate the pins inside the lock {{in order for a}} side-bar to drop, allowing the cylinder to turn. The pins are uniquely chisel-tipped which allows them to be rotated by the <b>angled</b> <b>cuts</b> on the key and have a slot {{along the length of the}} pin for the sidebar to drop into once the pin has been rotated to its correct orientation.|$|R
50|$|The base of {{the tool}} may have {{adjustable}} fences for <b>angled</b> <b>cuts</b> and square cuts and fence stops for multiple cuts of exactly the same size.|$|R
5000|$|By 1900 Blüthner {{had become}} the largest piano maker in Germany, {{producing}} some 5,000 instruments annually. Innovations such as the Aliquot string, a fourth string that vibrated sympathetically and that is tuned in unison {{as well as the}} cylindrical soundboard and <b>angle</b> <b>cut</b> hammers, created a unique voice for the Blüthner instrument.|$|E
50|$|The dart {{itself is}} long and thin, and it has four fins {{machined}} into its rear section, with each fin having a small <b>angle</b> <b>cut</b> into it that causes water to flow over it and give the projectile a stabilizing spin. The shape of the dart helps it to penetrate the water while retaining a high velocity.|$|E
50|$|There are {{different}} types of cutting blades for bolt cutters, including <b>angle</b> <b>cut,</b> center cut, shear cut, and clipper cut blades. Bolt cutters are available usually in 12, 14, 18, 24, 30, 36 and 42 inches (30.5, 35.6, 46, 61, 76, 91.4 and 107 cm) in length. The length is measured {{from the tip of}} the jaw {{to the end of the}} handle.|$|E
5000|$|Compound-miter saw - Compound {{adds the}} ability to rotate the blade head at a range of angles from the board {{allowing}} you to enter the wood at an angle other than 90 degrees. Creates a ramp <b>angled</b> <b>cut</b> {{into the side of}} the wood. Allows for more complex cuts and is commonly used in trim work for homes. A compound miter saw is known as a single compound miter saw, meaning that the head only rotates on one side requiring the user to flip the board to get <b>angle</b> <b>cuts</b> in the other direction.|$|R
5000|$|Autodesk Inventor, CATIA, FreeCAD, Solidworks and Vectorworks {{refer to}} both concave and convex rounded edges as fillets, while {{referring}} to <b>angled</b> <b>cuts</b> of edges and concave corners as chamfers.|$|R
50|$|This {{polyhedron}} {{could be}} constructed {{by taking a}} tall uniform hexagonal prism, and making 3 <b>angled</b> <b>cuts</b> {{on the top and}} bottom. The trapezoids represent what remains of the original prism sides, and the 6 rhombi a result of the top and bottom cuts.|$|R
50|$|A cabochon stone, a {{gemstone}} {{that is not}} faceted, usually {{relies on}} the shallow <b>angle</b> <b>cut</b> {{into the side of}} the stone which helps the metal to stay in place. With a clear faceted stone, such as a diamond, a shallow groove is cut into the bezel itself. The girdle or widest part of the gem stone is placed in the bezel, which is then pushed down over the girdle. The pressure of the bezel over the edge of the diamond keeps it in place.|$|E
50|$|Like {{its next}} door neighbor, the Great American Tower, 3300 North is rotated 45 {{degrees from the}} street grid. It is, however, an eight sided {{building}} with a 45-degree <b>angle</b> <b>cut</b> into {{each of the four}} corners. The building is covered with reflective glass {{with the exception of the}} corners, the crown and the lobby, which expose the concrete construction. 3300 North was designed at a time when the architectural trend was shifting away from the International Style and towards Post Modernism and thus, has elements of both architectural styles.|$|E
50|$|Like its next-door neighbor, the 3300 North Central Avenue, Great American Tower is rotated 45 {{degrees from}} the street grid. It is, however, an eight sided {{building}} with a 45-degree <b>angle</b> <b>cut</b> into {{each of the four}} corners. Great American Tower is designed in the Post Modern style. It features exterior columns and spandrels giving the tower an angular, repetitive appearance. The top floor plate is smaller {{than the rest of the}} tower and features a balcony, which rings the outer perimeter with the exception of its 45-degree corners.|$|E
50|$|He {{had also}} noted that {{improperly}} pruned trees were unable to heal themselves. He thus became an early advocate of proper pruning techniques, including an <b>angled</b> <b>cut</b> to conform to a tree’s natural physiological processes. This proper pruning innovation was radical for the time period, and has only been adopted as the industry standard within the past 25 years.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of scroll saws offer a small {{light on a}} flexible arm that illuminates the work area and a dust blower nozzle to keep the work space clear while working. Table-tilting enables <b>angled</b> <b>cuts</b> to be made precisely and easily. Variable-speed support allows even finer control over cuts when working with delicate materials or when making intricate cuts.|$|R
50|$|When {{viewed from}} the top, metal {{counterweight}} is basically rectangular, typically with 45-degree <b>angle</b> chamfers <b>cut</b> at two opposing corners. A slot is cut into {{each end of the}} weight so as to enable the weight to straddle, and be laterally secured by, the arbor rods. In order to facilitate removal of weights with <b>angle</b> <b>cuts,</b> it is customary to stack the weights in alternating orientations so that the square corners of any weight will be aligned with the angled corners of adjacent weights. This simplifies removal because the square corners of each weight protrude beyond the angled corners of the weight below, serving as handles that can be easily gripped, even with gloved hands.|$|R
5000|$|There is an 8.9" [...] {{diameter}} Dana 44 {{ring and}} pinion that {{is very different from}} the standard Dana 44. This {{ring and pinion}} is significantly stronger with a better pinion to ring gear tooth contact patch and angle. It was typically used in the back of jeep JKs, Isuzus and Nissan pickups. This ring and pinion does share some components and can be adapted into an earlier Dana 44 but requires some work, different bearings and spacers. The benefit is the larger ring gear, better <b>angle</b> <b>cut</b> on the teeth and Dana 60 diameter pinion shaft.|$|E
5000|$|For 1966, {{minor changes}} greeted the Ambassador range. The V-shaped {{horizontal}} louver spanned unbroken between the headlamps {{and the effect}} was continued with twin rectangular trim pieces attached {{to the side of}} the front fenders at their leading edges by the headlamps. The effect was repeated in the new vertical wraparound taillamps with the top-line models receiving a twin set of horizontal ribbed moldings across the back of the trunk lid that simulated the look of the front grille. Hardtop coupes received a redesigned roofline that was angular in appearance with an <b>angle</b> <b>cut</b> rear side windows and rectangular rear window. The backlight no longer curved and wrapped slightly around the C-pillars. The changes made for a more [...] "formal" [...] notchback look that was popular at the time.|$|E
50|$|One of {{his most}} notable {{contributions}} to inclusive design is the Berman Corner, a device {{that can be found}} in printed materials for those who are unable to see.The Berman Corner itself is a 45 degree <b>angle</b> <b>cut</b> on one corner of a printed document, with a QR code or another scannable code within 3.5 inches of the cut.The premise behind this corner is that those who are visually impaired are able to feel the edge and recognize access to electronic resources. In response to this concept, Chawky Moussa, the President of Cecitech said, “As a person who is blind, I immediately recognized the way the Berman Corner works, and the huge value this will have every day! This creation helps me a lot in my daily work!” The Berman Corner is one of the numerous accessibility contributions Berman has made to date.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The sensing {{setup for}} {{detection}} and measurement {{of carbon dioxide}} and methane was designed. Absorption spectra of many compounds indicate several weak peaks around 1400 - 1600 nm wavelength. Thus, tunable lasers with 20 micron core photonic bandgap fiber matching above wavelengths were chosen for the optical measurement system. Measurements were performed at low pressure to eliminate pressure broadening effect and to sharpen the absorption peaks. The <b>angled</b> <b>cut</b> was performed to improve signal to noise ratio...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the interference between amplitudes e^+e^- →ρ→ where f_ 0 meson is {{considered in the}} frameworks of the four-quark model and {{the model of the}} scalar KK̅ molecule. The general expressions for the differential cross section with the radiative corrections and two <b>angle</b> <b>cuts</b> are given. The interference patterns are obtained in the spectrum of the differential cross section by the energy of the photon and in the full cross section by the energy of the beams...|$|R
50|$|The end of {{the final}} length of exhaust pipe where it vents to open air, {{generally}} the only visible part of the exhaust system part on a vehicle, often ends with just a straight or <b>angled</b> <b>cut,</b> but may include a fancy tip. The tip is sometimes chromed. It is often of larger pipe {{than the rest of}} the exhaust system. This produces a final reduction in pressure, and sometimes used to enhance the appearance of the car.|$|R
50|$|The feud between Edge and Kurt Angle {{continued}} after Backlash on the May 2 {{episode of}} SmackDown!, when Angle challenged Edge to a rematch {{but this time}} in a Hair vs. Hair match, which Edge accepted. On the May 16 episode of SmackDown!, during a segment between Edge and Triple H, Angle and Chris Jericho attacked both men, ending with Jericho manhandling Edge while <b>Angle</b> <b>cut</b> his hair once with the scissors as an example for their Hair vs. Hair match at Judgment Day. Later that episode, Angle and Jericho defeated Edge and Triple H in a tag team match after Angle nailed Edge with the steel chair and followed it with an Angle Slam for the win. After the match, Angle tossed Edge's hairpiece onto Edge. In a Hair vs. Hair match at Judgment Day, Edge defeated Angle and shaved the Angle's head bald following it.|$|E
50|$|The grip area is {{one that}} varies widely. A {{straight}} grip stock (A) proceeds smoothly from toe to the trigger, giving a nearly horizontal angle for the trigger hand, while a full grip stock (E) contains a separate piece for the grip, providing a near vertical angle for the trigger hand, and is commonly found on modern military rifles, such as the ubiquitous AK-47 and M16 rifle families of assault rifles. The semi-grip (B) stock {{is perhaps the most}} common sporting stock, with a steeper <b>angle</b> <b>cut</b> into the stock to provide a more diagonal angle for the trigger hand. Modern target style stocks have moved towards a fuller, more vertical grip, though built into the stock rather than made as a separate piece, and may be considered grip stocks. Anschütz stocks (C), for example, use a nearly vertical grip, and many thumbhole style stocks (D) are similar to full grips in shape.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 21 mm. The forewings are white irregularly sprinkled grey and brownish, {{with a small}} brownish spot near the base in the middle edged above with a fine black strigula. There is a large triangular fuscous blotch extending over the median third of the costa and reaching three-fourths across the wing, crossed {{in the middle of}} the disc by a blackish streak, and its apical <b>angle</b> <b>cut</b> off by an oblique white strigula preceded by dark fuscous suffusion. There is an oblong fuscous blotch on the costa towards the apex, emitting anteriorly a furcate lobe downwards, its posterior segment nearly reaching the tornus. A blackish dash crosses the lobe {{in the middle of the}} wing, and another is placed beyond it towards the costa, the costal edge of the blotch suffused dark fuscous,with two minute white strigulae. There is a fuscous streak along the upper part of the termen. The hindwings are dark grey, lighter and with hyaline streaks in the disc towards base.|$|E
50|$|Valves and seats {{will usually}} {{have the same}} angle to mate properly. That angle is usually 45 degrees, but 30 degrees {{can be found in}} many modern applications. The mating angle is often {{accompanied}} by top and bottom <b>angle</b> <b>cuts</b> that are 15 degrees deflection each side of the mating angle. For a 45 degree seat, the top angle would be 30 and bottom would be 60). This method increases air-flow, which gives mild horsepower, response, and efficiency improvements.|$|R
50|$|A {{variety of}} grooves, slots, and pockets in the {{work-piece}} may be produced {{from a variety}} of tool bits. Common tool bit types are: square end cutters, ball end cutters, t-slot cutters, and shell mills. Square end cutters can mill square slots, pockets, and edges. Ball end cutters mill radiused slots or fillets. T-slot cutters mill exactly that: T-shaped slots. Shell end cutters are used for large flat surfaces and for <b>angle</b> <b>cuts.</b> There are variations of these tool types as well.|$|R
50|$|For miter joints {{occurring}} at angles other than 90°, for materials {{of the same}} cross-section the proper <b>cut</b> <b>angle</b> must be determined so that the two pieces to be joined meet flush (i.e. one piece's mitered end is not longer than the adjoining piece). To find the <b>cut</b> <b>angle</b> divide the angle at which the two pieces meet by two. Technically, two different <b>cut</b> <b>angles</b> are required; one for each piece, where the second angle is 90° plus the aforementioned <b>cut</b> <b>angle,</b> but due to angular limitations in common cutting implements (hand circular saws, table saws) a single angle is required and is used to cut the first piece {{in one direction and}} the second piece in the opposite direction.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 14 mm. The forewings are grey suffused whitish, beyond {{a line from}} before {{the middle of the}} costa to three-fourths of the dorsum ochreous-brown, two whitish spots obliquely placed in the disc on the division. There is a black dot on the base of the costa and a thick blackish very oblique curved streak from the dorsum near the base to the disc near the middle, with the apex pointed. The costal edge just before the subterminal line is blackish and there is a fine whitish line from three-fifths of the costa to the dorsum before the tornus, acutely angulated in the middle, both halves slightly incurved, the <b>angle</b> <b>cut</b> by a fine blackish line from beyond the middle of the disc to the termen. Immediately beyond this is a rhomboidal blackish spot on the costa extending nearly to the apex and there are also short white pre-terminal markings edging a black subapical line, another above this and two below them. The hindwings are dark fuscous.|$|E

50|$|The grab {{has to be}} {{selected}} so that the combined weight of grab and contents does not exceed the grabbing safe working load of the crane. The mass of the contents depends upon {{the properties of the}} product being handled; its density, flow characteristics, angle of repose, lump/grain size, purity (e.g. is it wet or dry) and, in some cases, degree of settlement (e.g. a ship's cargo has compacted due to vibration, rolling, pitching and yawing over a long voyage). Most bulk-handling cranes are dedicated to a single product, but others will handle various materials and need a selection of grabs. Some applications (e.g. manganese ore) may also require the use of teeth fitted to the grab jaws to enable penetration. Other applications (e.g. rape seed) may require to be self-sealing and have offset lower jaws with serrated, <b>angle</b> <b>cut</b> side cutters to restrain easy-flow properties.When off-loading a ship, the grab may be more efficient if designed with a low-profile extended body which enables reaching under the ship's hatches, negating any need to centre the product with human and machinery access.The grab mechanism may be four rope, double rope, single rope ring discharge, single rope self-dumping, double chain, single chain self-dumping, single chain ring discharge, hydraulic or electro-hydraulic.Rope grabs have rope pulleys in both the upper and lower girders and close by drawing the closing rope(s) to shorten the gap between the two girders. The minimum diameter of the pulley is restricted by the ratio of the pulley diameter to the rope diameter, the strands of the wire rope being subjected to fatigue bending stresses if the pulley is too small, giving premature failure. The physical size of the pulleys then determines the size of the girders, then determining a break point between a four rope and a two rope design. The closing force at the shell jaws, and, inversely, the speed of closure, are determined by the number of pulleys on each closing rope in the two girders. The closing rope is fed into the grab mechanism through either a bellmouth or an arrangement of small rollers. The weight of the grab is supported by the holding rope(s) and pinned to the upper girder allowing some angular freedom. Holding and closing ropes require separate winding drums in the crane.The mechanism on chain grabs operates {{in the same way as}} on rope grabs. The chains are connected to ropes on the crane by (e.g. bordeaux) couplings which allow rotation. A linked chain requires a much small diameter pulley than the equivalent rope which makes a smaller, more compact, design of girder. Chains used on chain pulleys are less easily inspected for wear and fatigue than ropes which show outer strand deformation well before failure. Failure of a rope or chain is a very high severity (dangerous) hazard.|$|E
50|$|This {{is a type}} of key {{where the}} {{individual}} cuts are designed to engage chisel-pointed pins in high-security locking systems manufactured by Medeco and Emhart. These <b>angled</b> <b>cuts</b> are designed to lift each tumbler to a predetermined height to the shear line and to rotate them to a specific angle to engage a sidebar mechanism (Medeco) (this is also used in Schlage Primus) or to line up an interlocked pin to such a position to where it would allow the plug to rotate (Emhart).|$|R

50|$|Used in the {{processing}} of tube, pipe or any form of long section. The plasma cutting head usually remains stationary whilst the workpiece is fed through, and rotated around its longitudinal axis. There are some configurations where, as with 3 Dimensional Plasma Cutting, the cutting head can tilt and rotate. This allows <b>angled</b> <b>cuts</b> to be made through {{the thickness of the}} tube or section, commonly taken advantage of in the fabrication of process pipework where cut pipe can be provided with a weld preparation in place of a straight edge.|$|R
