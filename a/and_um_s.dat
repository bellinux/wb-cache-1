40|$|INTRODUCTION: In {{the human}} gut, S 100 B protein is {{specifically}} expressed by enteroglial cells (EGCs) and, {{in response to}} various stimuli, it is released in the extracellular space where it is suggested to participate to intestinal homeostasis. Most of its effects are mediated by the interaction with the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE), which is expressed also by intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). AIMS & METHODS: We aimed to {{study the effects of}} different concentrations of S 100 B on viability, proliferation and differentiation of the human IECs. To achieve this goal, Caco- 2 cells were exposed to nanomolar or micromolar concentrations of S 100 B (0. 005 <b>and</b> 5 <b>uM,</b> respectively), for 24 h, in presence or absence of a specific anti- RAGE neutralizing antibody (1 / 1000 v/v) added 2 h before S 100 B stimulation. Cells viability, proliferation and differentiation were respectively studied by MTT vitality test, Bromodeoxyuridine incorporation assay, lactase/sucrase enzymes activity tests. Cells with medium alone were used as control. Data are expressed as mean±SD. RESULTS: Both S 100 B 0. 005 <b>uM</b> <b>and</b> <b>S</b> 100 B 5 uM, compared to control, did not affect cell viability (0. 8 ± 0. 3 and 0. 7 ± 0. 3 vs 0. 7 ± 0. 1 l 540 − 630; p=ns). Both concentrations of S 100 B significantly decreased proliferation respect to control (0. 17 ± 0. 01 and 0. 18 ± 0. 01 vs 0. 23 ± 0. 01 l 450 − 540; p< 0. 05). This antiproliferative effect was not observed when cells were pre-treated with anti-RAGE. Compared to control, S 100 B 0. 005 <b>uM,</b> but not <b>S</b> 100 B 5 uM, significantly increased lactase activity (+ 7. 5 ± 0. 9, p< 0. 05 and + 1. 9 ± 0. 5 fold increase vs control; p=ns) and sucrase activity (+ 2. 6 ± 0. 3, p< 0. 05 and + 0. 7 ± 0. 4, p=ns fold increase vs control). The increase in lactase/sucrase activity was not observed when cells were pre-treated with anti-RAGE. CONCLUSION: Nanomolar concentration of S 100 B significantly reduces IECs proliferation and stimulates cells differentiation, without cytotoxic effects. Very intriguingly, these effects were abolished {{in the presence of a}} specific anti-RAGE antibody. Our findings further support the role of EGCs in the regulation of intestinal mucosal barrier functions...|$|R

40|$|A clear {{shift in}} the {{etiology}} of sepse {{has occurred in the}} last decade. Recent data from the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) show that Gram-positive cocci have exceeded Gram-negative bacilli as the major etiological agents. In this respect, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) have become the most frequent. However, most clinical laboratories do not identify these microorganisms to species level due to the need for a series of biochemical tests. The application of molecular biology techniques, including the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), for bacterial identification proved to be promising due to their speed, accuracy and sensitivity. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the efficiency, accuracy and sensitivity of multiplex PCR for the detection of Staphylococcus spp. frequently found in blood cultures, investigation of the ica operon involved in biofilm formation and the mecA gene encoding oxacillin resistance, and direct detection of major CoNS species in blood culture flasks. A total of 371 blood culture samples positive for Staphylococcus spp. obtained from patients seen at the Hospital of the Botucatu School of Medicine (FMB) were analyzed. The strains were isolated and identified by conventional biochemical tests. Simultaneously, bacterial DNA was extracted directly from the blood cultures for multiplex PCR. S. aureus was isolated from 85 (23 %) of the 371 samples studied and CoNS from 286 (77 %). Among the latter, 152 (53. 1 %) isolates were identified as S. epidermidis, 36 (12. 6 %) as S. haemolyticus, 36 (12. 6 %) as S. hominis, 23 (8 %) as S. capitis, 18 (6. 3 %) as S. warneri, 7 as S. caprae, 5 as S. simulans, two as S. lugdunensis, two as S. cohnii, one as S. saprophyticus, one as S. schleiferi, and one as S. xylosus. S. haemolyticus and S. hominis were concomitantly identified in one sample and S. haemolyticus and S. epidermidis in another. Forty-three (50. 6 %) of the 85 S. aureus strains were resistant to oxacillin in [...] . Na última década houve uma clara mudança na etiologia da sepse. Dados recentes do National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) mostram que os cocos Gram-positivos têm ultrapassado os bacilos Gram-negativos como os principais agentes etiológicos e os Estafilococos coagulase negativa (ECN) se tornaram os agentes mais frequentes. Entretanto a maioria dos laboratórios clínicos não identifica esses microrganismos a nível de espécies devido à necessidade de realização de uma série de provas bioquímicas. A aplicação de técnic as de biologia molecular, entre elas a reação em cadeia da polimerase (PCR) para a identificação de bactérias se mostrou uma técnica promissora devido a sua rapidez, acurácia e sensibilidade. Assim, este trabalho objetivou avaliar a eficiência, acurácia e sensibilidade da técnica de PCR multiplex para a detecção do gênero e de espécies de Staphylococcus spp. mais encontradas em hemoculturas, do operon ica de produção de biofilme e da presença do gene mecA de resistência à oxacilina diretamente dos frascos de hemocultivo. Foram analisadas 371 amostras de hemoculturas, positivas para o gênero Staphylococcus obtidas de pacientes atendidos no HC da Faculdade de Medicina de Botucatu (FMB). As amostras foram isoladas e identificadas por testes bioquímicos convencionais e simultaneamente o DNA bacteriano foi extraído diretamente das hemoculturas e destes realizou-se o PCR multiplex. Das 371 amostras estudadas 85 (23, 0 %) foram de S. aureus e 286 (77, 0 %) ECN. Dos ECN 152 (53, 1 %) foram identificados como S. epidermidis, 36 (12, 6 %) S. haemolyticus, 36 (12, 6 %) S. hominis, 23 (8, 0 %) S. capitis, 18 (6, 3 %) S. warneri, 7 S. caprae, 5 S. simulans, dois S. lugdunensis, dois <b>S.</b> cohnii, <b>um</b> <b>S.</b> saprophyticus, <b>um</b> <b>S.</b> schleiferi, <b>um</b> <b>S.</b> xylosus e concomitantemente <b>um</b> <b>S.</b> haemolyticus e <b>S.</b> hominis, e <b>um</b> <b>S.</b> haemolyticus e S. epidermidis.
