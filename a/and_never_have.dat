There is no rule in organized baseball prohibiting their participation and never has been to my knowledge. If Durocher, or if any other manager, or all of them, want to sign one, or twenty-five Negro players, it is all right with me. That is {{the business of the}} managers and the club owners. The business of the commissioner is to interpret the rules of baseball, and to enforce them.|$|E

25|$|On {{the accusations}} of being docile, Mathieu writes in her {{autobiography}} {{that she and}} Johnny Stark understood each other. She {{wanted to be a}} singer, and he was tired of people who just wanted to be famous. They were both hard workers, and he kept her schedule filled with lucrative contracts. She also writes that she was forbidden to read the press, and, having peeked at some of it, was content to follow that rule. Stark, of course, had a heavy hand in manipulating the press. Mireille writes that her mother was often surprised to read on the front page that she was engaged to someone famous, or {{was going to be in}} a movie by some famous director.

500|$|Eliot's poems have {{frequently}} been examined for instances of anti-Semitism—prejudice or discrimination against Jews. Scholar Louis Menand states that while Simeon is treated respectfully by Eliot, his characterisation is [...] "in {{the tradition of}} Christian condescension toward the virtuous heathen". [...] Comparatively, Craig Raine, a poet and an Emeritus Fellow of New College, Oxford, wrote a book-length defence of Eliot against the claims of deliberate anti-Semitism and argues that [...] "A Song for Simeon" [...] provides a sympathetic discussion of the Jewish diaspora. University of British Columbia scholar John Xiros Cooper states that the accusations of anti-Semitism lodged against Eliot rest [...] "on a few isolated lines of poetry" [...] and a passing reference in one prose text. Indeed, Eliot denied the claim, declaring, [...] "I am not an anti-Semite <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> been. It is a terrible slander on a man." [...] Political theorist and author Leonard Woolf, who was both Jewish and one of Eliot's close friends, believed that Eliot was [...] "slightly anti-Semitic {{in the sort of}} vague way which is not uncommon. He would have denied it genuinely." ...|$|E

"In western usage {{these words}} [...] have a rather {{specific}} connotation; they suggest {{a certain type}} of religiosity- emotional indeed sentimental; not intellectual, perhaps even anti intellectual; and in general apolitical and even anti-political.

[...] In the dream, Morpheus acts as Gold's guide, giving him {{an hour to}} free Belle from the {{sleeping}} curse; if he fails, Belle's soul will be banished to the netherworld forever. Belle is reliving her experiences as Rumplestiltskin's servant, so he tries to recreate {{the circumstances under which}} they first fell in love. He succeeds, culminating in a kiss, but this causes her memories to return and she pulls back. She refuses to repeat the pain she experienced {{as a result of their}} relationship and tells Gold that their child is better off without him, leaving Gold hurt. [...] "Morpheus" [...] then reveals himself to actually be Gold and Belle's unborn child; satisfied that Belle will not resume her relationship with Gold, he then warns her to not let Gold destroy them like he did to his first family, he frees his mother from the sleeping curse with a kiss on the forehead. Gold is left bereft as even his unborn child hates him. Belle wakes up but before returning to Storybrooke through Gold's portal, he tells Gold that she will listen to their son's warning <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> a life with him again.|$|E
2500|$|One {{specific}} {{scene in}} the film perceived {{as an example of}} anti-Semitism was in the dialogue of Caiaphas, when he states [...] "His blood [...] on us and on our children!", a quote historically interpreted by some as a curse taken upon by the Jewish people. Certain Jewish groups asked this be removed from the film. However, only the subtitles were removed; the original dialogue remains in the Hebrew soundtrack. When asked about this scene, Gibson said: [...] "I wanted it in. My brother said I was wimping out if I didn't include it. But, man, if I included that in there, they'd be coming after me at my house. They'd come to kill me." [...] In another interview when asked about the scene, he said, [...] "It's one little passage, and I believe it, but I don't <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> believed it refers to Jews, and implicates them in any sort of curse. It's directed at all of us, all men who were there, and all that came after. His blood is on us, and that's what Jesus wanted. But I finally had to admit {{that one of the reasons}} I felt strongly about keeping it, aside from the fact it's true, is that I didn't want to let someone else dictate what could or couldn't be said." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1911, {{he set out}} {{to build}} his first {{airplane}}, an airplane he named [...] "Silverwing". His first design was a monoplane, constructed of spruce and linen and which took the form of an American version of the Bleriot XI. The engine was a modified Elbridge motorboat motor, dubbed the [...] "aero special", which was a 2-stroke, 4-cylinder engine with a maximum of [...] and 1,050rpm. Upon completion, he sought to test the aircraft at the Great Salt Plains (adjacent to the Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge) in Alfalfa County, Oklahoma. His first attempt at flight ended in a ground loop, which required $100 to repair. After repairs, Cessna attempted flight 13 more times, each time ending in some sort of failure. Finally on his 13th attempt, Cessna got a glimpse of hope as his aircraft bounced up into the air for a short time before crashing into the trees as he attempted to turn it. After his crash, Cessna exclaimed in frustration, [...] "I'm going to fly this thing, then I'm going to set it afire <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> another thing to do with aeroplanes!". Finally, in June 1911 Cessna had his first successful flight. The crowds that had scoffed at his failures changed their tone and began calling him a [...] "daring hero" [...] and nicknamed him the [...] "Birdman of Enid". Cessna continued to teach himself how to fly {{over the next several months}} until December 1911, when he made a successful [...] flight and a successful landing at the point of departure. He was the first person to build and fly an airplane in the Heartland of the United States—between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains.|$|E
