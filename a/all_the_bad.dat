Lois runs after the dog, {{retrieves}} Rupert, and repairs him, causing Stewie to rethink <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> thoughts he's had of Lois. Stewie becomes enamored with her, which she takes as refreshing at first, but eventually, she becomes exhausted and frustrated at his increased dependency and even has a nightmare of murdering him. Taking Brian's advice, she starts ignoring his demands for attention (faking he got sick from pills and claiming to be dying), until he injures himself falling down the stairs; Lois tries to apologize for her behavior, but Stewie is so disgusted by it that it causes him to hate her once again.|$|E
5|$|Elle {{manages to}} {{convince}} Paul to sign over {{his share of}} Lassiter's {{to her and she}} leaves him with nothing. Paul has a brain tumour removed and he loses his memory. He later apologises to his neighbours for <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> things he did. Paul begins a relationship with Oliver's mother, Rebecca Napier, and she and her youngest son, Declan (James Sorensen), move in with him. Remembering that he murdered Gus, Paul confesses all to the police and Gus's sister Laura (Jodi Flockhart). The police inform Paul {{that they will not be}} pursuing the case, while Laura and her boyfriend Nick Thompson (Marty Grimwood) try to blackmail Paul by kidnapping Declan. Paul has an affair with Kirsten Gannon (Nikola Dubois) and Rebecca ends their relationship. Paul regains his assets from Elle and he buys the Erinsborough News. Paul briefly dates Cassandra Freedman (Tottie Goldsmith), but he and Rebecca soon reconcile. Paul is initially blamed for his half-sister Jill Ramsay's (Perri Cummings) death. He goes on the run, but his name is cleared by Jill's daughter Sophie (Kaiya Jones). When Paul and Rebecca get engaged, Lyn interrupts their wedding to announce she and Paul are still married. After divorcing Lyn, Paul marries Rebecca.|$|E

Heidfeld's strong finish {{enabled him to}} move into fourth place with 47 points and Vergne's retirement meant he fell to fifth on 40 points. e.Dams-Renault's strong performance allowed them to consolidate their lead in the Teams' Championship with 190 points; although neither of their cars scored points, Audi Sport ABT were still second while Mahindra's strong results meant they strengthened their hold on third place. With Techeetah not scoring points, Virgin and NextEV moved into fourth and fifth respectively with six races left in the season.

500|$|Fleming {{intended}} {{the book to}} have a more serious tone than his debut novel, and he initially considered making the story a meditation on the nature of evil.

Pericles lived {{during the first two}} and a half years of the Peloponnesian War and, according to Thucydides, his death was a disaster for Athens, since his successors were inferior to him; they preferred to incite <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> habits of the rabble and [...] followed an unstable policy, endeavoring to be popular rather than useful.

500|$|Breezy {{questioned}} if the song's {{content was}} inspired by Fantasia's past affair with a married man.

[...] Fantasia compared [...] "Sleeping with the One I Love" [...] to her 2005 single [...] "Free Yourself", explaining that they both have [...] "that gritty, bluesy feeling". Amber McKynzie described the main theme of the song as [...] "what it’s like to love hard and not get the same love in return". Matthew Scott Donnelly wrote that [...] "Sleeping with the One I Love" [...] was [...] "a modern sister track" [...] to Ben E. King's 1963 single [...] "I (Who Have Nothing)".

500|$|Uroš Predić (1857–1953) {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} 19th- and 20th-century Serbian realists. A native of Orlovat, a village in the Banat region of Austria-Hungary, Predić drew scenes of life in the village throughout his career. One of the more frequent sights during his stays there was of intoxicated young men returning from the pub at dawn and waking up the whole village. In painting the composition, Predić was not only attempting to realistically depict contemporary village life but also to convey a message. [...] "I observed this every day", he explained. [...] "I said to myself there must be some way of telling these people to what an unhappy level they have descended and have a moral impact on them, capturing <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> habits of my compatriots."

500|$|Roth's fake trailer {{contained}} {{elements that}} almost earned Grindhouse an NC-17 rating, including a cheerleader simultaneously stripping, bouncing on a trampoline and getting {{stabbed in the}} vulva, and three decapitations; the first victim dressed as a pilgrim turkey at a parade gets decapitated and his headless body stumbles around in a exaggerated manner, the second occurs as the victim's girlfriend performs fellatio on him, and the last decapitation occurs on a man while he is being kissed by a female victim. According to Roth, [...] "Instead of seeing it spread out in a feature, watching it all jammed together non-stop makes it more shocking. But {{we had a great}} discussion with the ratings board. They got it. Once they saw it with <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> splices and the distress and scratches they were fine with it."

500|$|In 1996, a {{previously}} unpublished private account written in 1972 by Aldo Lampredi for the Communist Party's archives, appeared in L'Unità. In it, Lampredi confirmed the key facts of Audisio's story {{but without the}} embellishments. Lampredi was undoubtedly an eyewitness and, because he prepared his narrative for the private records of the Communist Party – and not for publication – it was perceived {{that he had no}} motivation other than to tell the truth. Furthermore, he had had a reputation for being reliable and trustworthy; he was also known to have disliked Audisio personally. For all these reasons it was seen as significant that he largely confirmed Audisio's account. After Lampredi's account was published, most, but not all, commentators were convinced of its veracity. The historian Giorgio Bocca commented that [...] "it sweeps away <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> novels constructed over 50 years {{on the end of the}} Duce of fascism ....

[...] Upon hearing that some were surprised by the collaboration, Wale went on to say, [...] "If Jay-Z can work with Coldplay, then Wale should be able to work with Gaga."

She commented that her portion of the song, which includes lyrics such as [...] "Lookin' at, lookin' at, lookin' at me/ Eyes all stickin' like honey on bees", is narcissistic, but in a positive way. The lyrics capture the life and image of Wale's home areas Maryland and District of Columbia. About incorporating the hook in the song, Gaga said: ...|$|E
500|$|William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet {{inspired}} the lyrics for [...] "Exit Music (For a Film)". Initially Yorke {{wanted to work}} lines from the play into the song, but the final draft of the lyrics became a broad summary of the narrative. He said: [...] "I saw the Zeffirelli version when I was 13 and I cried my eyes out, because I couldn't understand why, the morning after they shagged, they didn't just run away. It's a song for two people who should run away before <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> stuff starts." [...] Yorke compared {{the opening of the}} song, which mostly features his singing paired with acoustic guitar, to Johnny Cash's At Folsom Prison. Mellotron choir and other electronic voices are used throughout the track. The song climaxes with the entrance of drums and distorted bass run through a fuzz pedal. The climactic portion of the song is an attempt to emulate the sound of trip hop group Portishead, but in a style that bass player Colin Greenwood called more [...] "stilted and leaden and mechanical". The song concludes by fading back to Yorke's voice, acoustic guitar and Mellotron.|$|E

[...] Andrew Rennie of Now considered it the album's strongest track and noted Ciara and Elliott's [...] "trademark chemistry". IGN's Finn White wrote that the song [...] "will make <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> girls sweat on the dance floor". In his review of Fantasy Ride, Marrio Tarradell of The Dallas Morning News wrote that [...] "Love Sex Magic" [...] is a [...] "dance-floor corker", and noted that [...] "Work" [...] is [...] "similarly club-ready", referring both songs to as [...] "ultra-catchy". Regarding [...] "Work", Tarradell wrote, [...] "The rapid-fire 'work, work, work' refrain will bond to your head as if with Krazy Glue." [...] Writing for Metro Weekly, Doug Rule called the song an [...] "instant classic" [...] and referred it to as a [...] "sequel of sorts to Elliott's marvelous 2002 hit 'Work It'."

It's a song which makes the most of Nicole's unwholesome sexiness– as opposed to wholesome, you understand, I'm not saying there's anything gross about her– and has drama and fury on its side." [...] Nick Levine of Digital Spy agreed saying that [...] "Scherzinger has managed to bag herself a banger of an (ahem) debut single". He described the song's busy production as [...] "having a whiff of the Berline [...] "teknoklub" [...] that is a [...] "racket in the best possible way". Levine also praised Scherzinger for her conviction on the song, awarding it five out of five stars. He gave [...] "Poison" [...] a better reception than he awarded Scherzinger's previous attempt, [...] "Baby Love" [...] (2007), which he only awarded three out of five stars, stating that it was the wrong single to launch the career of a world-class superstar.|$|E
