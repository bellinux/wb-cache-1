5|$|The {{team at the}} Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia, is {{planning}} to begin new experiments on the synthesis of ununennium and unbinilium using the 249Bk+50Ti and 249Cf+50Ti reactions in 2019 and 2020 using a new experimental complex. The team at RIKEN in Japan <b>also</b> <b>plans</b> to make attempts on these elements in 2017 through 2020 with 248Cm targets using the 248Cm+51V and 248Cm+54Cr reactions: following this, RIKEN plans to attempt the synthesis of unbiunium (element 121). The ion sources for the 51V and 54Cr beams necessary for the RIKEN experiments are under development; those for 50Ti are ready and the RIKEN team intends to first study the differences that arise from changing from 48Ca to heavier projectiles by the 248Cm+50Ti reaction aimed at producing new isotopes of oganesson. The team at GANIL in France <b>also</b> <b>plans</b> to search for heavy isotopes of existing superheavy elements and the new element unbinilium in 2019 and 2020 using 244Pu and 248Cm targets.|$|E
5|$|There are {{long-term}} {{plans to}} add express toll lanes to I-695 to ease traffic congestion along the route. In addition, there are <b>also</b> <b>plans</b> to widen the portion of I-695 between I-83 and I-95 {{to the north of}} Baltimore. This road, which is to be widened to eight lanes, is currently in the design phase.|$|E
5|$|A {{scheme to}} cover the moors with ash from {{coal-fired}} power stations, and possibly municipal rubbish, was proposed in 1962, and again in 1969. Another plan of the 1960s was to build a regional airport on the moors; this proposal was revived in 1971. Further ash-tipping schemes were voiced in 1974, as was a third plan for an airport in 1976. There were <b>also</b> <b>plans</b> to use the moor as a dump for colliery waste in 1978, when Thorne Colliery was upgraded and reopened.|$|E

5|$|As the 777s {{continue}} to phase in, the 747s are being progressively retired. On 5 January 2015, EVA Air had retired their first 747 variant, the combi variant. In 2016, EVA {{announced that the}} last 747-400 passenger service will be mid-May 2017. Last planned 747-400 long range service will be 26 March 2017. The airline will {{continue to}} operate the two daily 747-400 to Shanghai until mid-may. The airline <b>also</b> <b>plans</b> to retire the 747 freighters when the 777 freighters are delivered. EVA retired the Boeing 747-400 passenger aircraft from its fleet on 21 August.|$|E
5|$|Election {{reform is}} {{a focus of}} the Wildrose Alliance. The party proposes to set fixed {{election}} dates rather than the current format which allows the Premier to call an election at any time. It would allow more free votes in the legislature and would seek to elect the province's Senators rather than have them appointed by the Prime Minister. The party <b>also</b> <b>plans</b> to introduce a bill giving voters the right to recall their MLA. The Wildrose Party proposes numerous changes to how the province delivers health care, which it claims will remain compliant with the Canada Health Act, as well as controls on government spending. Smith is also critical of international climate change treaties, believing climate change science remains inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, {{upgrades}} {{were made}} to the portion of U.S. Route 202 concurrent with Route 23. This portion of road, which was originally a four-lane undivided road, saw an upgrade to a six-lane freeway south of the Alps Road interchange and to a six-lane surface road north of there. Construction on these improvements was completed in 1986. There were <b>also</b> <b>plans</b> to replace the Flemington Circle with an interchange as part of a project that would have also built a limited-access bypass of Flemington for Route 31; however, this plan was never realized.|$|E

5|$|In {{the period}} 2015 to 2020, Avinor {{plans to build}} a new control tower and a new fire- and rescue station. The former is located too close to the runway while the latter is too small and out of date. There are <b>also</b> <b>plans</b> to expand the {{terminal}} building to allow the simultaneous handling of two large and two small aircraft. Finnmark County Municipality is considering establishing a fast ferry service between Kirkenes and Vadsø which would have a service time of 45 minutes. There is a possibility of marketing Kirkenes as an alternative airport for Murmansk as Kirkenes can offer cheaper flights to Oslo than what is available from Murmansk to Moscow.|$|E
5|$|Offitt's {{membership}} has tired of endless talk, and plans a general strike, {{a fact of}} which Farnham is informed by Mr. Temple, a salty-talking vice president of a rolling mill. An element among the strikers <b>also</b> <b>plans</b> to loot houses along Algonquin Avenue, including Farnham's. The strike begins, paralyzing Buffland's commerce, though it is initially nonviolent. Neither the mayor nor the chief of police, when approached by Farnham, are willing to guard Algonquin Avenue. Farnham proceeds to organize Civil War veterans, and purchases weapons to arm them. After Farnham's force rescues the mayor from being attacked, he deputizes them as special police—on condition there is no expense to the city.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{unavailable}} for purchase as a soundtrack, Furst published the score of Mask of Light as a digital album with Rising Phoenix Records in 2017, fourteen {{years after the}} film's release.

5|$|Production of the {{left-hand}} drive European-spec i-MiEV began in October 2010. By {{the end of}} November 2010 cumulative production had reached 5,000 units at Mitsubitshi's Mizushima Plant. In May 2011 Mitsubishi announced a new production target of 25,000 i-MiEVs worldwide in fiscal year 2011. The carmaker <b>also</b> <b>plans</b> to export about 15,000 units overseas, mainly to Europe, where the company will promote sales to the European public sector, such as police departments and local governments. Production of the American-spec i electric car began in late October 2011. Since July 2009 Mitsubishi had manufactured more than 33,000 i-MiEVs and rebadge versions by March 2013, including more than 11,000 units rebadged in France as Peugeot iOn and Citroën C-Zero, and sold in the European market.|$|E
5|$|The plan resurfaced in 1929, when {{meetings}} {{took place}} between Jersey City Mayor Frank Hague and officials from New York City Mayor Jimmy Walker's office. This plan proposed a subway line running along the SIRT North Shore Branch and John F. Kennedy Boulevard in New Jersey, before connecting with the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad (today's PATH train) at Exchange Place. The service would have provided access to Lower Manhattan via the H's Downtown Hudson Tubes to Hudson Terminal (now {{the site of the}} World Trade Center station).

5|$|The year 1918 saw the {{introduction}} of the Education Act 1918, commonly also known as the Fisher Act as it was devised by Herbert Fisher. The act enforced compulsory education from 5–14 years, but also included provision for compulsory part-time education for all 14 to 18-year-olds. There were <b>also</b> <b>plans</b> for expansion in tertiary education, by raising the participation age to 18 though cuts in public spending after World War I made this impractical. This is the first act which starting planning provisions for young people to remain in education until the age of 18. The 1918 act was not implemented until a further act of 1921 was passed.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{small power}} station {{comprising}} three Cummins B and C series diesel engines, offering an approx 150 kVa 3 phase supply {{to most of the}} island buildings. Waste heat from the engine jackets is used for a district heating pipe. There are <b>also</b> <b>plans</b> to collect the waste heat from the engine exhaust heat gases to feed into the district heat network to improve the efficiency further. The Power is normally switched off between 0000 and 0630.|$|E
5|$|There were <b>also</b> <b>plans</b> for an {{intermediate}} {{stop at the}} current Woodside LIRR station, and an additional 63rd Street line station at Northern Boulevard adjacent to Queens Plaza. The bypass and proposed Woodside station would have necessitated the widening of the LIRR Main Line right-of-way onto private property west of Winfield Junction, where the Main Line merges with the Port Washington Branch, and reorganization of the track layout in the Sunnyside Yards. Later proposals suggested routing the bypass directly to the Archer Avenue line via the LIRR Montauk Branch (which no longer has passenger service).|$|E
