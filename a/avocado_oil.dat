40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to synthesize}} polyurethane membrace from <b>avocado</b> seed <b>oil</b> {{as a source}} of hydrixyl (-OH) and hexametylhene - 1. 6 -dissocyanate (HDMI) {{as a source of}} isocynate (-NCO). The oil were extracted from avocado seeds at temperature of  60 - 80 oC for 2 hours using n-hexane solvent. The results of FTIR spectrum analysis from <b>avocado</b> seed <b>oil</b> showed that there were -OH clusters absorption on the wavelength number of 3393. 819 cm- 1, thus this oil can be used to synthesize polyurethane membrane. The isocyanate composition, time and temperature during synthesis process of polyurethane membrane were varied. The polyurethane membrane were moulded in petri dishes, then heated up for 48 hours on the temperature of  70 oC, and finally taken out from its mould. The characteristics of the polyurethane membrane from <b>avocado</b> seed <b>oil</b> are brown in colour, homogenous, elastic, solid, transparent and shaped like a membrane. The measurements from FTIR spectrum showed that the -NCO clusters are no longer present. This condition happened because there were no more absorption in the wavelength number of  2270 cm- 1. It can be concluded that the isocyanate has completely reacted during polymerization and the curing process, thus urethane was created in the 1699, 965 cm- 1 absorption which was the urethane C=O clusters absorption...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Avocado</b> <b>oil</b> {{is one of}} few {{edible oils}} not derived from seeds; it is pressed from the fleshy pulp {{surrounding}} the avocado pit. Extra virgin <b>avocado</b> <b>oil</b> from the Hass cultivar has a characteristic flavor, is high in monounsaturated fatty acids, and has a high smoke point (≥), making it a good oil for frying. ‘Hass' cold-pressed <b>avocado</b> <b>oil</b> is a brilliant emerald green when extracted; the color is attributed {{to high levels of}} chlorophylls and carotenoids extracted into the oil. Cold-pressed ‘Hass' <b>avocado</b> <b>oil</b> has been described as having an avocado flavor, with grassy and butter/mushroom-like flavors. Other varieties may produce oils of slightly different flavor profile as has been seen with ‘Fuerte,' which has been described as having more mushroom and less avocado flavor.As a culinary oil, <b>avocado</b> <b>oil</b> compares well with olive oil. It has a similar monounsaturated fat profile which helps to protect the oil from breakdown during heating. <b>Avocado</b> <b>oil</b> is naturally low acidic, helping to increase smoke point.

50|$|<b>Avocado</b> <b>oil</b> was originally, {{and still}} is, {{extracted}} for cosmetic use {{because of its}} very high skin penetration and rapid absorption. Following drying of the avocado flesh to remove as much water as possible (≈65% water in avocado flesh), <b>avocado</b> <b>oil</b> for cosmetics is traditionally extracted with solvents at elevated temperatures. After extraction, the oil for application in skin care products is usually refined, bleached, and deodorized, resulting in an odorless yellow oil. Like extra virgin olive oil, cold-pressed <b>avocado</b> <b>oil</b> is unrefined and so retains the flavor and color characteristics of the fruit flesh.|$|E
40|$|Biodiesel is {{produced}} through a chemical process called transesterification, {{which refers to}} a catalysed chemical reaction involving vegetable oil and alcohol to yield fatty acid alkyl esters (biodiesel) and glycerol as a by product. Biodiesel is petroleum substitution in which its quantity continually decreases due to increasing of demand. Plenty of plants {{could be used as}} raw material for biodiesel, for example is avocado (Persea gratissima) seed. This is a waste that being thrown out after the flesh is taken. Therefore, avocado has a higher economic value to be used for consumption. Avocado is not only as an edible commodity but also as feedstock for production of biodiesel. The purposes of this research are producing biodiesel from <b>avocado</b> seed <b>oil</b> (Persea gratissima) so it can be used for alternative fuel, studying the effect of molar ratio <b>avocado</b> seed <b>oil</b> to methanol and reaction temperature to yield the highest methyl ester content, and also studying the effect of washing method and comparing between the conventional method (using water) and dry washing method to reach the highest methyl ester content. Variables that are used in this research are molar ratio of methanol to <b>avocado</b> seed <b>oil,</b> reaction temperature, and washing method. Transesterification process runs for 60 minutes, with NaOH as base catalyst concentration is 1 % by weight. <b>Avocado</b> seed <b>oil</b> contains free fatty acid less than 2 %, so that transesterification process can be carried out with no addition step to convert free fatty acid content become esters. Crude biodiesel which is yielded from transesterification process still contains of impurities, such as traces of glycerine, unreacted methanol, rest of base catalyst, and soap stock. So it needs to be washed out. There are two washing methods, which are water washing and dry washing. The use of dry washing method is expected to be technically feasible with less complexity than the water washing method, thereby making it a competitive alternative to commercial biodiesel production. From this research, it can be concluded that the characteristic of biodiesel from <b>avocado</b> seed <b>oil</b> is acceptable for alternative fuel. The optimum condition is obtained at molar ratio of 1 : 6 (alcohol to oil) and temperature 60 C. Washing method with water is resulting methyl ester content of 82. 7119 %, while for dry washing method resulting methyl ester content of 84. 5678 %. Therefore, the best washing method is dry washing in difference of 1. 8559 %...|$|R

In the present study, fourteen different kinds of edible oils (rapeseed, olive, hazelnut, argan, groundnut, grape seed, sesame, sunflower, walnut and organic walnut, avocado, wheat germ, and two combined oils) were analysed for FA determination using a BPX- 70 60 m highly polar GC column.

In the polyunsaturated (PUFA) group, grape seed oil presented the highest LA content while sunflower, sesame, and wheat germ oils showed noticeable MUFA amounts in addition to high PUFA contents. Walnut oils, also rich in LA, showed the highest linolenic acid (ALA) content. The n- 6 /n- 3 ratio of each oil was calculated. Trans-FA (TFA) was also detected and quantified.
