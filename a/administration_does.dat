5|$|Those with {{epilepsy}} or seizures {{are typically}} denied a pilot license. In Canada {{if an individual}} has had {{no more than one}} seizure, they may be considered after five years for a limited license if all other testing is normal. Those with febrile seizures and drug related seizures may also be considered. In the United States, the Federal Aviation <b>Administration</b> <b>does</b> not allow those with epilepsy to get a commercial pilot license. Rarely, exceptions can be made for persons who have had an isolated seizure or febrile seizures and have remained free of seizures into adulthood without medication. In the United Kingdom, a full national private pilot license requires the same standards as a professional driver's license. This requires a period of ten years without seizures while off medications. Those who do not meet this requirement may acquire a restricted license if free from seizures for five years.|$|E
25|$|The current {{administration}} of Daniel Ortega {{took office in}} November 2006. This <b>administration</b> <b>does</b> oppose private sector participation and has been critical of autonomous regulation.

25|$|In the United States, the Food and Drug <b>Administration</b> <b>does</b> {{not require}} {{labelling}} {{of genetically engineered}} salmon. However, in December 2015, members of the Alaska congressional delegation were able to insert language in a major spending bill that temporarily banned the sale of modified salmon until the FDA promulgated labeling guidelines.|$|E
50|$|For the 2010-11 school year, Wellsboro Area School District <b>administration</b> <b>did</b> {{not apply}} for a School Improvement Grant. It was {{eligible}} for funding due to the chronic, low achievement at the Butler Middle School. In 2011-12 the District was also eligible for School Improvement Grant funding due to the School Improvement II status of the middle school. The <b>Administration</b> <b>did</b> {{not participate in the}} funding opportunity.|$|R

25|$|After oral administration, {{zopiclone}} {{is rapidly}} absorbed, with a bioavailability around 75–80%. Time to peak plasma concentration is 1–2 hours. High-fat meal preceding zopiclone <b>administration</b> <b>does</b> not change absorption (as measured by AUC), but reduces peak plasma levels and delays its occurrence, thus may delay {{the onset of}} therapeutic effects.|$|E
25|$|Oral {{nicotinamide}} {{has been}} promoted as an over-the-counter drug {{for the treatment of}} Alzheimer's dementia. Conversely, no clinically significant effect has been found for the drug, as nicotinamide administration has not been found to promote memory functions in patients with mild to moderate dementia of either Alzheimers', vascular, or fronto-temporal types. This evidence suggests that nicotinamide may treat dementia as related to pellegra, but <b>administration</b> <b>does</b> not effectively treat other types of dementia.|$|E
25|$|No {{reports of}} ill effects have been {{documented}} in the human population from GM food. Although GM crop labeling is required in many countries, the United States Food and Drug <b>Administration</b> <b>does</b> not require labeling, nor does it recognize a distinction between approved GM and non-GM foods. The federal government of the United States passed a law that requires labeling regulations to be issued by July 2018, and allows indirect disclosure such as with a phone number, bar code, or web site.|$|E
50|$|Lincoln's <b>administration</b> <b>did</b> {{not comply}} with {{the rule of law}} or legal {{principle}} announced by Chief Justice Taney in his Merryman opinion, and Lincoln did not order his subordinates to comply with Taney's opinion. Alternatively, because Taney's order did not direct Lincoln to comply in any specific manner, it could be maintained that the Lincoln <b>administration</b> <b>did</b> not fail to comply with its legal obligations in connection with Merryman.|$|R

25|$|According to Mary Guy, Public <b>administration</b> <b>does</b> {{not only}} {{focus on the}} {{business}} side of administration but also on the personal side as well. It is not just about collecting the water bill or land ordinances to construct a new property, it is also about the quality of life and sense of community that is allotted to individuals by their city officials. Rational work is the ability to think cognitively and analytically, while emotional work means to think more practically and with more reason.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} Taiwan's Coast Guard Administration {{can be traced}} back to several origins. One of these is the former 7th Special Police Corps, which was {{expanded}} from the late and unique River Patrol squadron of the Taipei County (now New Taipei City) Police Department. The land branches of Coast Guard Administration originate from the controversial Taiwan Garrison Command, which no longer exists, but the formations of land patrol forces were inherited from the ROC Army. Because of its interesting and complicated origins, the Coast Guard <b>Administration</b> <b>does</b> not always go along well with the police, especially when problems related to legal jurisdiction on land occur.|$|E
25|$|Atorvastatin {{undergoes}} rapid absorption {{when taken}} orally, with an approximate time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) of 1–2 h. The absolute bioavailability {{of the drug}} is about 14%, but the systemic availability for HMG-CoA reductase activity is approximately 30%. Atorvastatin undergoes high intestinal clearance and first-pass metabolism, which is the main cause for the low systemic availability. Administration of atorvastatin with food produces a 25% reduction in Cmax (rate of absorption) and a 9% reduction in AUC (extent of absorption), although food {{does not affect the}} plasma LDL-C-lowering efficacy of atorvastatin. Evening dose administration is known to reduce the Cmax and AUC by 30% each. However, time of <b>administration</b> <b>does</b> not affect the plasma LDL-C-lowering efficacy of atorvastatin.|$|E

500|$|United States – Amnesty International {{writes that}} [...] "The United States signed the Covenant in 1979 under the Carter {{administration}} {{but is not}} fully bound by it until it is ratified. For political reasons, the Carter administration did not push for the necessary review of the Covenant by the Senate, which must give its 'advice and consent' before the US can ratify a treaty. The Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations took the view that economic, social, and cultural rights were not really rights but merely desirable social goals and therefore {{should not be the}} object of binding treaties. The Clinton Administration did not deny the nature of these rights but did not find it politically expedient to engage in a battle with Congress over the Covenant. The George W. Bush administration followed in line with the view of the previous Bush administration." [...] The Obama Administration stated [...] "The <b>Administration</b> <b>does</b> not seek action at this time" [...] on the Covenant. The Heritage Foundation, a critical conservative think tank, argues that signing it would obligate the introduction of policies that it opposes such as universal health care.|$|E
2500|$|Access to {{the museum}} is through the side patio/balcony {{entrance}} on {{the southern end of}} the building.

2500|$|All of the {{patients}} who met the eligibility criteria {{should be included in}} the main analysis of the response rate. [...] Patients in response categories 4-9 should be considered as failing to respond to treatment (disease progression).

2500|$|To make {{it easier}} for animals, young children, and {{individuals}} with classical (Kanner-type) autism to understand and perform theory of mind tasks, researchers have developed tests in which verbal communication is de-emphasized: [...] some whose <b>administration</b> <b>does</b> not involve verbal communication {{on the part of the}} examiner, some whose successful completion does not require verbal communication on the part of the subject, and some that meet both of the foregoing standards. [...] One category of tasks uses a preferential looking paradigm, with looking time as the dependent variable. For instance, 9-month-old infants prefer looking at behaviors performed by a human hand over those made by an inanimate hand-like object. Other paradigms look at rates of imitative behavior, the ability to replicate and complete unfinished goal-directed acts, and rates of pretend play.|$|E
2500|$|MSG is one {{of several}} forms of glutamic acid found in foods, in large part because glutamic acid (an amino acid) is {{pervasive}} in nature. Glutamic acid and its salts may be present in a variety of other additives, including hydrolyzed vegetable protein, autolyzed yeast, hydrolyzed yeast, yeast extract, soy extracts, and protein isolate, which must be specifically labeled. Since 1998, MSG cannot be included in the term [...] "spices and flavorings". The ribonucleotide food additives disodium inosinate and disodium guanylate are usually used with monosodium glutamate-containing ingredients. However, the term [...] "natural flavor" [...] is used by the food industry for glutamic acid (chemically similar to MSG, lacking only the sodium ion). The Food and Drug <b>Administration</b> <b>does</b> not require disclosure of components and amounts of [...] "natural flavor." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2012–13, a {{proposal}} on the White House's website urging the United States government {{to build a}} real Death Star as an economic stimulus and job creation measure gained more than 30,000 signatures, enough to qualify for an official response. The official (tongue-in-cheek) response was released in January 2013: {{the cost of building}} a real Death Star has been estimated at $850 quadrillion by the Lehigh University, or about 13,000 times the amount of mineable resources on Earth, while the International Business Times cited a Centives economics blog calculation that, at current rates of steel production, the Death Star would not be ready for more than 833,000 years. The White House response also stated [...] "the <b>Administration</b> <b>does</b> not support blowing up planets," [...] and questioned funding a weapon [...] "with a fundamental flaw that can be exploited by a one-man starship" [...] as reasons for denying the petition.|$|E
50|$|Part of the 50 reissued permits {{also include}} {{construction}} of natural gas, oil, and {{other fossil fuel}} pipelines.

Because of this controversy, the Obama <b>Administration</b> <b>did</b> not grant a real estate easement to the developers. This action by the Obama <b>Administration</b> <b>did</b> not stop the construction because the jurisdiction still falls under the Rivers and Harbors Act, which is overseen by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.|$|R

2500|$|Miller was Fed {{chairman}} for {{just over a}} year when Carter appointed him Secretary of the Treasury in August 1979, replacing Michael Blumenthal as part of a major cabinet shuffle in which five Cabinet members were replaced. [...] Carter appointed Paul Volcker to replace Miller. [...] He thus became the only person to serve as both Treasury Secretary and Chairman of the Federal Reserve. [...] As Treasury Secretary, Miller {{is best known for his}} role on the Chrysler Loan Guarantee Board, which oversaw management of a $1.5 billion loan to rescue the carmaker from bankruptcy. [...] This attracted some controversy as the bailout was thought to reward mismanagement and impede fair trade relations between the United States and Japan. [...] Miller agreed that [...] "The <b>administration</b> <b>does</b> not favor, as a general proposition, government aid to private corporations," [...] but thought an exception should be made in Chrysler's case. [...] Chrysler recovered in the early 1980s and paid off the loan early.|$|E
2500|$|Mark Mardell, the BBC News North America editor, {{criticized the}} [...] "whole process, {{which has been}} used not to examine a candidate's fitness for high office, but to {{underline}} the rather obvious fact that the Obama <b>administration</b> <b>does</b> not share the world view of Republican senators, and they don't like their former colleague joining it." [...] Mardell noted the senators repeatedly [...] "insisted he gave a simple 'yes' or 'no' to complex questions. These are old men who hold themselves in high regard, but seem to see serious examination of difficult problems as a personal affront. They desperately want to play 'gotcha', but haven't the self-restraint to design effective questions." [...] Mardell called Senator Hagel [...] "equally unimpressive, almost unprepared, for a level of hostility that had been signalled long in advance. Neither smart, nor humble, his tactic {{seemed to be a}} kind of bumbling blandness." [...] According to Mardell, only Senator Cruz was effective and well-prepared, as [...] "he ripped into the nominee with all the skill honed as a Texas solicitor general." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now {{there are}} various ways of exterminating a race, {{and most of them}} are cruel. You may end it with fire and sword after the old Hebrew fashion; you may enslave it and work it to death, as the Spaniards did the Caribs; you may set it {{boundaries}} and then poison it slowly with deleterious commodities, as the Americans do with most of their Indians; you may incite it to wear clothing to which it is not accustomed and to live under new and strange conditions that will expose it to infectious diseases to which you yourselves are immune, as the missionaries do the Polynesians; you may resort to honest simple murder, as we English did with the Tasmanians; or you can maintain such conditions as conduce to [...] "race suicide," [...] as the British <b>administration</b> <b>does</b> in Fiji. Suppose, then, for a moment, that there is an all-round inferior race; a Modern Utopia is under the hard logic of life, and it would have to exterminate such a race as quickly as it could. On the whole, the Fijian device seems the least cruel. But Utopia would do that without any clumsiness of race distinction, in exactly the same manner, and by the same machinery, as it exterminates all its own defective and inferior strains; that is to say, as we have already discussed in Chapter the Fifth, section 1, by its marriage laws, and by the laws of the minimum wage. That extinction need never be discriminatory. If any of the race did, after all, prove to be fit to survive, they would survive--they would be picked out with a sure and automatic justice from the over-ready condemnation of all their kind.|$|E
