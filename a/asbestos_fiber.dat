40|$|Introduction: Today, {{have been}} {{approved}} scientifically relationship between presence of <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibers</b> in the human respiratory area and malignant diseases such as lung advanced fibrosis (Asbestosis), gastrointestinal, lung and Laryngeal cancers. The {{aim of this study}} was the determination of <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibers</b> concentration in Yazd city’s air in the summer of 2015. Materials and Methods: This is a descriptive cross sectional study in which 13 high-traffic points of Yazd city were selected for asbestos sampling. Sampling was conducted in the summer in two stages using SKC pump. In total were collected 26 samples from the high traffic points of Yazd city. Also for the counting of <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibers</b> was used scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results: In the current research, the highest and the lowest concentration of <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibers</b> were related to Shohadayemehrab square (0. 02131 fiber/ml) and Azadshahr (0. 00112 fiber/ml) respectively. Qualitative analysis of <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibers</b> by SEM showed that 75 % of the samples were <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibers</b> and the other was non-asbestos fibers. Conclusion: The present study showed that the average of <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibers</b> concentration in total sampling stations (0. 00848 fiber/ml) was higher than WHO guidelines (2. 2 × 10 - 3 fiber/ml). The main reason for the presence of these fibers in the air of Yazd city can be attributed to brake pad, clutch and automobile gasket adhesive...|$|R

Moreover. after internalization, crocidolite <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibers</b> are often found free in the cytoplasm. whereas glass wool fibers are mainly localized inside cytoplasmic vacuoles. After treatments. we also detected signs of oxidative stress. revealed by an increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and by ail induction of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. The lipoperoxidative damage was characterized by a decrease in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), ail increase in the content of thiobarbituric reactive species (TBARS) and a consumption of vitamin E, as a lipophilic antioxidant. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of fiber exposure oil cell proliferation. and it was found that. unlike crocidolite <b>asbestos</b> <b>fibers,</b> SVFs did not induce a significant increase in DNA synthesis.
