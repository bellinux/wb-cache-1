40|$|We {{propose a}} {{feasible}} scheme of conditional quantum partial teleportation of a qubit as optimal asymmetric cloning at a distance. In this scheme, Alice preserves one imperfect clone whereas other clone is teleported to Bob. Fidelities of the clones can be simply controlled by an asymmetry in Bell-state measurement. The optimality means that tightest inequality for the fidelities in the asymmetric cloning is saturated. Further we design a conditional teleportation as symmetric optimal N-> N+ 1 cloning from N Alice's replicas on single distant clone.

30|$|The {{proposal}} in [21] suggests an optimized slotted 1 -persistence scheme for multi-hop communications. As well, the protocol proposes {{the formation of}} vehicle clusters that includes vehicles within the transmission range of each other. Using the elected cluster front and tail vehicles, the protocol proposes a store-carry forward mechanism in sparse networks to reduce the network overhead. Synchronized transmissions and additional overhead required for cluster formation and maintenance are the drawbacks of this scheme. To consider both channel quality and transmission distance in selecting the next relay node, Slavik and Maghoub [22] assign a shorter waiting time to vehicles belonging to a connected dominating set (CDS) and employs acknowledgements for every multi-hop message. The main disadvantage of the scheme is the piggy-backed acknowledgement that is sent {{as part of the}} periodic safety message, increasing its transmission overhead. The work of [14] develops an opportunistic broadcast scheme, in which the relay nodes use a long-range ACK packet to lower the redundant multi-hop transmissions. Moreover, the dissemination of multi-hop messages takes place in two phases: first one for quick propagation of message <b>and</b> <b>second</b> <b>one</b> <b>for</b> increasing the reception reliability. However, interference from the periodic safety messages could result in loss of long-range ACK packets resulting in greater number of retransmissions.|$|E

40|$|Background: Cyperus rotundus L. {{was used}} in {{traditional}} Iranian medicine to treat memory and cognition disorders. The present study was aimed at investigating {{the effect of the}} extract and essential oil of C. rotundus on memory dysfunction. Materials and Methods: Cognition was evaluated using the object recognition task that was composed of a square wooden open field box with different shape objects. The test was consisted of three sections: 15 min exploration, first trial for 12 min <b>and</b> <b>second</b> <b>one</b> <b>for</b> 5 min. In the second trial the difference in exploration between a previously seen object and novel one, was considered as an index of memory performance (recognition index). Memory deficit was induced by scopolamine (0. 5 mg/kg) before injection of plant extracts and essential oil. Results: Rivastigmine at 0. 6 mg/kg reversed the scopolamine induced memory dysfunction in mice (P < 0. 05). On the contrary, neither the hydroalcholic extracts (100, 200, 400 mg/kg) nor the polyphenolic extract (50, 100, 200 mg/kg) and essential oil (10, 20, 40 mg/kg) of C. rotundus produced significant improvement of memory dysfunction. The fact that rivastigmine reversed the scopolamine-induced memory dysfunction confirms the validity of this memory paradigm. Conclusion: Using the current method of the memory evaluation, none of the tested doses of the plant extract or essential oil changed the memory status of the animals, indicating either a lack of effective ingredient or unsuitable method for evaluation...|$|E

40|$|The {{unemployment}} {{leads to}} a deprivation of basic needs. Seriousness of unemployment depends on the lenght of its duration. Long-term unemployment leads to the apathy and evokes a short-time thinking. One of the main targets of employment policy is reduction of a long - term unemployment. The method of questionary investigation was used to gather the information. There were two questionary forms, one of them for the employed <b>and</b> <b>second</b> <b>one</b> <b>for</b> the jobless informants. Both forms contained total of 16 questions. Questions in a form for the employed were aimed to a fear of a losing of the job and questions aimed to the spending of a leisure time. In questionary forms for the jobless were questions aimed to a spending of a leisure time and questions aimed to their tendency {{to find a job}}. The experimental set of the employed was formed by the inhabitants of Budweis in South Bohemia. Rate of the returned questionary forms was 98 %. The experimental set of the unemployed was formed from the jobless people registered in employment office in Budweis. Rate of the returned questionaries reached 87 %. In my work I wanted to refer about problems of the unemployment with regard to human mentall condition. The aim of my work was to evaluate if the unemployment influenced human mentall condition. I predicted three hypotheses. Hypothesis No. 1 : Groups of person with problematic use on the employment market have a fear of losing the job, was confirmed. Hypothesis No. 2 : The empleyed people are using their leisure time for their perosnal growth than the people unemployed for more than 6 months, was confirmed. Hypothesis No. 3 : The people unemployed for a period more than 6 months have a smaller interest to find a job than the people unemployed for the period of 6 months and less, was confirmed also. The thesis treats the unemployment´s influence of a human mentall condition. This work has personally for me an impact of getting a theoretical knowledge about studied topic. The results point-out the fact that the unemployment influence a leisure-time activities. Duration of the unemployment influences an interest to find a job and competence to the risk group of the employed leads to the fear of losing a job and to the fear of searching for a new job.

40|$|To conduct {{experiments}} under abrupt {{changes in}} g-levels, a single-engine aerobatic aircraft has been used, providing 6 - 8 seconds of reduced gravity, preceded {{and followed by}} 5 - 7 seconds of hypergravity periods. Due to the specific conditions of the flight and previous findings [1], the hypothesis of the present work lies {{on the idea that}} some sensory inputs could have a notorious effect on brain final responses when gravity is altered. Therefore, this study focuses on the evaluation of such hypothesis, based on the analysis of the evolution in time of intracranial activity of limbic, visual and auditory cortices. Five subjects (N= 5, age 41 ¿ 14 years) have flown in parabolic flight with their eyes both open and closed. Electroencephalogram signals were recorded with an Emotive Epoc headset, synchronized with a triaxial accelerometer. The intracranial brain bioelectric activity (standardized current density) throughout the parabola, was calculated by applying Standard Low Resolution Brain Electromagnetic Tomography, and it was analyzed for the limbic, visual and auditory cortices. Intracranial activity of the Temporal, Parietal and Occipital lobes were carried out as well in order to compare the different periods/phases of the flight. Results detected a lower brain activity during the hypogravity phase in all lobes and cortices, only in the case of open eyes. The bioelectrical brain activity along the parabola showed similar patterns in all lobes and cortices, when visual inputs are highlighted. Suppressing the sight, two major behaviors were detected in brain activity: one for temporal lobe and auditory cortex, <b>and</b> <b>second</b> <b>one</b> <b>for</b> the rest of the lobes and visual cortex. It Seemed that, flying with closed eyes, other sensory stimuli were enhanced, in this case the auditory cortex. To confirm the validity of the results two-way ANOVA (factors lobe/phases) and Fisher post hoc test have been applied on mean intracranial activity values in all cases. Spectral entropy evolution in time has been considered as a fast indicator of the sudden extracranial brain activity variation during short g-changes. For open eyes, spectral entropy values indicated a slight decrease {{at the onset of the}} hypogravity phase, whereas in case of closed eyes, this change was detected in the last seconds of the parabola, even though these fluctuations were statistically non-significant. Results suggest that some of the sensory inputs can indeed have an impact on brain final response, when gravity conditions are altered. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|An area of {{research}} in graph theory, in which a distance-based parameter, called a resolving set, is used to distinguish all the vertices in a connected graph G, is a hot area {{of research}} from the past few decades. The concept of a resolving set "a set of vertices of G with the property that the list of distances from any vertex of G {{to those in the}} set uniquely distinguishes (identi?es) that vertex", was introduced in mid 1970 's by Slater [64] and, independently, by Harary and Melter [31]. Inspired by the work done by many researchers of this area and motivated by the multiple applications of resolving set in many areas such as robot navigation, chemical industry, network discovery and veri?cation, coin weighing problems and strategies for mastermind game, we contribute to the literature in this area by investigating resolving sets in some well-known families of graphs and by studying some new interesting resolving and distance-based parameters. The brief details of our contribution to this area are as follows: We study metric dimension of two families of regular graphs, the circulant graphs Xn, 3 and the generalized Petersen graphs P(2 m,m? 1), and discover that these families of graphs belong to the family of regular graphs with constant metric dimension (metric dimension of a graph which is independent of the choice of the number of vertices of the graph). 2 -size metric dimension, which is the cardinality of a minimum resolving set of a graph such that the subgraph induced by it is of size two, is also investigated. Further, we characterize all the connected graphs of order n having 2 -size metric dimension n, n? 1 and give some realizable results. Fault-tolerant metric dimension of graphs with its generalization "fault-tolerant partition dimension" and their relationship has also been studied. Moreover, we classify all the connected graphs such that the di?erence between their metric dimension and fault-tolerant metric dimension is one. We also characterize all the connected graphs of order n having fault-tolerant partition dimension n and n? 1. We study a partition of the vertex set of a graph in which each of its partite set is a resolving set for that graph, and we call it a locatic partition. We give some realizable results and characterize all the connected graphs of order n having locatic partition of maximum cardinality n, n? 1 and n? 2. We investigate the resolving polynomial of a graph, which is a good representative of the resolving structure of the graph. Also, we characterize all the connected graphs having two resolving roots. Further, the resolving share in graphs, which tells the exact participation of each vertex of the graph in resolving all the pairs of the vertices of that graph, has also been studied. With the help of resolving share, we de?ne and study a distance-based topological index. We propose two integer linear programming formulations: one for fault-tolerant metric dimension problem <b>and</b> <b>second</b> <b>one</b> <b>for</b> local metric dimension problem. We also compute local metric dimension and strong metric dimension of two families of convex polytopes Sn and Un...|$|E
