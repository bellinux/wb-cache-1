5|$|On October 19, 1959, a Boeing 707-227 {{crashed on}} the banks of the Stillaguamish River's North Fork during a test flight, killing four of eight occupants. The plane, being flown by Boeing test pilots instructing {{personnel}} from Braniff International Airways, lost three engines and suffered <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fourth after a dutch roll had been executed beyond maximum bank restrictions. The plane made an emergency landing in the riverbed while unsuccessfully trying to reach a nearby open field.|$|E
5|$|The loss of Taihō and Shōkaku left Zuikaku {{to recover}} the Division's few {{remaining}} aircraft after their heavy losses (only 102 aircraft remained aboard the seven surviving carriers by the evening) and the 1st Mobile Fleet continued its withdrawal towards Okinawa. The Americans did not spot the Japanese carriers until {{the afternoon of the}} following day and launched a large airstrike that only succeeded in hitting Zuikaku with a single bomb that started <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hangar.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the harsh}} winter conditions, the station area was {{gradually}} built with snow tunnels {{to keep the}} snow off the tracks. This included the platforms {{and most of the}} passing loop at the station. In 1914–15, the station serviced 398 passengers, and in 1919–20, it serviced 684 passengers, both times making it the least used station on the line. In 1948, {{the western part of the}} snow tunnel caught fire, and although it spread to the station building, it was quickly put out by the staff. In 1953, there was again <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tunnel.|$|E
5|$|Bruce's {{early work}} {{involved}} advising clients and rebuilding existing houses, rather than designing new buildings from scratch. Panmure House and Leslie House (seat of the Earl of Rothes) had been projects of the king's master mason John Mylne. At Panmure, although Bruce has {{been credited with}} the design in the past, the works were overseen by Alexander Nisbet, although Bruce did design the gates and gate piers. At Leslie, Bruce oversaw the works after Mylne's death, and probably made his own amendments. Panmure was demolished in the 1950s, and {{only a small part}} of Leslie House remains standing, following <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 18th century. Bruce later advised the Duke of Queensberry regarding his plans for Drumlanrig Castle.|$|E
5|$|Causes {{of death}} of adult ibis {{are not well}} known. Alligators could feasibly prey on nesting ibises {{but there has been}} little {{research}} in the area. A flock of fifty adult American white ibis were killed in <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Everglades. The corpses were found in a dense swathe of cattail (Typha angustifolia), which suggested they had taken shelter there. It is unclear why they {{had not been able to}} fly away from the fire, but one hypothesis was that they had been foraging for insects disturbed by the fire.|$|E

5|$|Meare Pool was drained {{after the}} Dissolution of the Monasteries {{and the fish}} house fell into disrepair. It {{suffered}} <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1880s, which destroyed the roof and gutted the interior. In 1893 some repairs {{were made to the}} walls, although the roof was not replaced until work was undertaken by the Ministry of Works in the 1920s, with further conservation being carried out in the 1960s. A piece of timber from the building was subject to dendrochronology testing in an attempt to provide a more specific date for the buildings construction, but the results proved inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|Sanchez takes Bond to his base, {{which is}} {{disguised}} as {{the headquarters of}} a religious cult. Bond learns that Sanchez's scientists can dissolve cocaine in petrol and then sell it disguised as fuel to Asian drug dealers. The televangelist Professor Joe Butcher serves as middleman, working under Sanchez's business manager Truman-Lodge. During Sanchez's presentation to potential Asian customers, Dario discovers Bond and betrays him to Sanchez. Bond starts <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> laboratory, but is captured again and placed on the conveyor belt that drops the brick-cocaine into a giant shredder. Bouvier arrives and shoots Dario, allowing Bond to pull Dario into the shredder, killing him.|$|E

5|$|The castle {{is largely}} the {{creation}} of the Douglas Earls of Morton, who held Aberdour from the 14th century. The earls used Aberdour as a second home until 1642, when their primary residence, Dalkeith House, was sold. <b>A</b> <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 17th century was followed by some repairs, but in 1725 the family purchased nearby Aberdour House, and the medieval castle was allowed to fall into decay. Today, only the 17th-century wing remains roofed, while the tower has mostly collapsed. Aberdour Castle is now in the care of Historic Scotland, and {{is open to the public}} all year.|$|E
5|$|The first {{bridge across}} the Ontonagon River was built in 1891. It was heavily damaged after <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> village a few years later. This bridge was deemed {{inadequate}} {{for the needs of}} traffic in Ontonagon in the 1930s. The Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) contracted for a replacement span in 1939. A temporary crossing was used while the original span was demolished and replaced with a swing bridge. This style of bridge was popular with the department {{in the first half of}} the 20th century, but fell out of favor as the MSHD transitioned to bascule bridges. Because of this change, the Ontonagon River Bridge was the last of its type built in the state when it was completed in 1940.|$|E
5|$|The {{major event}} of the second day (August 31, 1983) was the {{successful}} deployment of the INSAT-1B satellite, which took place at 7:48 UTC, with Challenger then maneuvering to avoid the firing of the booster motor forty minutes later. Other experimentation continued, though telemetry through TDRS was lost for around three hours, requiring manual intervention. A fire alarm sounded in the morning, indicating signs of <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> avionics compartment, but a second alarm remained silent and it was eventually determined to be a false alarm.|$|E

5|$|The {{market place}} at the centre of Poulton is the width of two streets and is now closed to motor traffic. Lying south of St Chad's Church and {{surrounded}} by shops, the square contains the town's war memorial {{as well as a}} market cross, stocks, whipping post and fish slabs, from which fish were sold on market days. Although many of the buildings surrounding the market place were rebuilt following <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 18thcentury, a few of the earlier buildings remain. To the south of the market place are town houses that were built for local merchants and professionals.|$|E
5|$|The work proved dangerous. By {{the end of}} the war, {{half the}} {{experienced}} chemists and metallurgists had to be removed from work with plutonium when unacceptably high levels of the element appeared in their urine. A minor fire at Los Alamos in January 1945 led to a fear that <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> plutonium laboratory might contaminate the whole town, and Groves authorized {{the construction of a new}} facility for plutonium chemistry and metallurgy, which became known as the DP-site. The hemispheres for the first plutonium pit (or core) were produced and delivered on 2 July 1945. Three more hemispheres followed on 23 July and were delivered three days later.|$|E
5|$|When the {{operation}} was still in its development stages, Armstrong and Colonel Roscoe C. Wilson were the leading candidates to command the group who was designated to drop the atomic bomb. Wilson was the Army Air Force project officer who provided liaison support to the Manhattan Project. Armstrong was an experienced combat veteran against German targets, {{but he was in}} his forties and had been severely injured in <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer of 1943. Wilson had no combat experience and was qualified primarily because of his engineering background and association with the project. Tibbets was considerably younger than both men and had experience in both staff and command duties in heavy bomber combat operations. He was already an experienced B-29 pilot, which made him an ideal candidate for the top-secret project.|$|E

5|$|With the victory, the Indians {{received}} their first playoff berth since the 1920 World Series. Indians' Manager Lou Boudreau dedicated the victory to pitcher Don Black, {{who suffered a}} cerebral hemorrhage the previous month. The Indians went on to face the Boston Braves in the 1948 World Series, winning it four games to two. The Red Sox fans experienced disappointment when Boston mayor James M. Curley ordered the fire department sirens sounded when Boston won the pennant. The sirens did sound, but it was instead for <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Boston navy yard.|$|E
5|$|About 30 {{houses in}} San Pablo, Laguna were either {{demolished}} by strong winds or by falling coconut trees. Elsewhere, in Zambales, {{a woman was}} killed after she was struck by lighting. In Lucena City, a farmer was swept away via floods and two boys died due to fallen trees. The resort city of Legaspi suffered severe damage because hundreds of dwellings were destroyed, forcing many residents to seek shelter in schools or churches. Along {{the east coast of}} Luzon, seven people perished when hit by falling coconut trees in Quezon. Meanwhile, three casualties occurred in <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> province of Sorsogon. A total of 15 people drowned in the town of Sexmoan. The nearby towns of Macabebe and Masantol saw two drownings each. In the city of Manila or the provinces of Batangas, Quezon, Laguna, and Cavite, 34,000 people were displaced. Overall, damage totaled $42 million (1983 USD). Infrastructure damage totaled $31 million. However, damage to crops totaled to only $9.4 million since residents were just beginning to replant fields.|$|E
5|$|In 1469 Thomas Mathew (died 1469), {{the third}} or fourth son of Sir David Mathew (died 1484) of Llandaf, {{inherited}} the land by marriage to Catherine, heiress of Radyr, and built Radyr Court, a manor house on the site of what is now the Radyr Court Inn in Danescourt. The house was used as a court. Although it was destroyed by <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 19th century, the three large dungeons survived and can still be seen at the Inn. On Thomas' death, his lands passed to his eldest son David and then to his younger son William Mathew (died 1528), who was knighted by King Henry VII at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485. Sir William accompanied Henry VIII to the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520. His successor was his eldest son Sir George Mathew, who became MP for Glamorganshire and in 1545 Sheriff of Glamorgan.|$|E
