5|$|Having just {{completed}} one such patrol in May 1976, {{the ship was}} notified {{that she would be}} participating in an International Naval Review in New York City as part of the United States Bicentennial celebrations, the first South African warship to visit the United States. President Kruger departed Simon's Town on 3 June, sailing via Walvis Bay, Abidjan <b>and</b> <b>Las</b> Palmas to Norfolk, Virginia. From there, she sailed in a fleet of 53 warships from 22 countries to New York City for the Naval Review on 4 July.

In the center of town, <b>LA</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>LA</b> 107 intersect Main Street. At this four-way intersection, LA 1 continues north toward Alexandria; LA 115 heads south through Hessmer to Bunkie; <b>and</b> <b>LA</b> 107 turns northeast onto Main Street beginning a concurrency with LA 115 out of Marksville. On {{the north side of}} town, <b>LA</b> 107 <b>and</b> <b>LA</b> 115 intersect two minor routes, LA 1190 (Spring Bayou Road) <b>and</b> <b>LA</b> 1192. Continuing northwest, <b>LA</b> 107 <b>and</b> <b>LA</b> 115 intersect two minor routes that run west to connect with LA 1: <b>LA</b> 1191 <b>and</b> another section of LA 1192. <b>LA</b> 107 <b>and</b> <b>LA</b> 115 have a very brief concurrency with LA 1192, which splits to the northeast and loops through Fort De Russy back to the first intersection in Marksville. <b>LA</b> 107 <b>and</b> <b>LA</b> 115 encounter two further minor routes before reaching the Red River: <b>LA</b> 1193 <b>and</b> <b>LA</b> 453 which run through an area known as Hickory Hill. <b>LA</b> 107 <b>and</b> <b>LA</b> 115 continue northwest across the Red River, slightly bypassing the small community of Moncla to the north.

5|$|Olid treated González <b>and</b> <b>Las</b> Casas more as honoured guests than as prisoners. Pedro de Briones' {{abandonment}} of Honduras {{resulted in a}} significant weakening of Olid's forces. Las Casas and González Dávila took advantage of this opportunity, and of Olid's excessive trust in his prisoners, to attack Olid and escape from their confinement. Once free, they expected support from Briones. Seizing their opportunity, González <b>and</b> <b>Las</b> Casas set upon Olid one evening and seriously wounded him. Olid managed to escape and hid in an Indian hut, but he was quickly found, and subjected to a rapid trial. Olid was executed by having his throat cut in the plaza at Naco. After the death of Olid, Spanish relations with the natives of Naco deteriorated notably. The Indians were increasingly unwilling to provide the Spanish with food and other supplies, {{and most of the}} Spanish abandoned the settlement and either returned to Mexico or resettled in other parts of Honduras. A court in Mexico subsequently condemned Las Casas and González Dávila for their execution of Olid, but neither was ever punished.|$|E

5|$|Batista {{responded with}} an all-out-attack, Operation Verano, {{in which the}} army aerially bombarded forested areas and villages {{suspected}} of aiding the militants, while 10,000 soldiers commanded by General Eulogio Cantillo surrounded the Sierra Maestra, driving north to the rebel encampments. Despite their numerical and technological superiority, the army had no experience with guerrilla warfare, and Castro halted their offensive using land mines and ambushes. Many of Batista's soldiers defected to Castro's rebels, who also benefited from local popular support. In the summer, the MR-26-7 went on the offensive, pushing the army out of the mountains, with Castro using his columns in a pincer movement to surround the main army concentration in Santiago. By November, Castro's forces controlled most of Oriente <b>and</b> <b>Las</b> Villas, and divided Cuba in two by closing major roads and rail lines, severely disadvantaging Batista.|$|E
