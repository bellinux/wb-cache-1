5|$|Yoshikawa {{develops}} {{misgivings about}} Asami after {{he is unable}} to reach any of the references on her résumé, such as a music producer she claimed to work for, who is missing. However, Aoyama is so enthralled by her that he pursues her anyway. She lives in an empty apartment, containing a sack and a phone. For four days after the audition, she sits perfectly still next to the phone waiting for it to ring. When it finally does, she answers pretending that she never expected Aoyama to call. After several dates, she agrees to accompany him to a seaside hotel, where a smitten Aoyama intends to propose marriage. At the hotel, Asami reveals burn scars on her body. Before making love, Asami demands that Aoyama pledge his love to her <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else.</b> A deeply moved Aoyama agrees. In the morning, Asami is nowhere to be found.|$|E

25|$|A {{lighthouse}} {{is located}} on the headland which, starting in 2005, {{was the subject of a}} controversy between Ukraine and Russia. From August 3, 2005, the lighthouse was occupied by the Russian Army. Despite a controversial ruling by a Court in Sevastopol on the subject, Russian military officials referred to the fact that they only took orders from the chief of the Russian Navy headquarters <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else.</b> Ukrainian activists complained that Sarych was illegally occupied by the Russian Navy. As a military object, the territory around the Sarych headland is closed to trespassers with barbed wire, and the Russian flag flew over Sarych.|$|E

25|$|Burr ran for {{president}} in the 1796 election, coming in fourth with 30 votes behind John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and Thomas Pinckney. (At the time members of the electoral college cast two ballots but did not specify an office. The first-place finisher overall became president and the runner up vice president. They did not run on a 'ticket' and were often opponents.) Burr was shocked by his defeat, as he believed he had arranged with Jefferson's supporters for their vote for him as well, in exchange for Burr's working to obtain New York's electoral votes for Jefferson. But many Democratic-Republican electors voted for Jefferson <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else,</b> or for Jefferson and a candidate other than Burr.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{recorded}} a thumping 10-wicket win over Bangladesh to level their head-to-head {{record in the}} NatWest Series to 1–1. Under leaden skies at Old Trafford, Ricky Ponting made the wise decision and chose to bowl, and short-balls from Brett Lee immediately had the Bangladeshis worried. They survived six overs without loss before Javed Omar was trapped by an in-swinger for a 20-ball 3. Tushar Imran was next to fall to Lee, and many expected a procession to begin, but Shahriar Nafees and Mohammad Ashraful gave the crowd a treat with some special strokes. Ashraful had two top-edged sixes, as Lee was dispatched for 20 runs in the 11th over. By the drinks break after 15 overs, Bangladesh were 76 for 2, having added 53 from the last 39 balls. Ponting, however, brought on the spinners Brad Hogg and Andrew Symonds, who both got {{a fair amount of}} turn out of the Old Trafford pitch, and Symonds had Shahriar bowled for 47 with a yorker that he played late to. The next ball, he got the out-of-form captain Habibul Bashar, and the wickets began to tumble quickly. Symonds got five wickets for 18 runs, Hogg three for 29, Bangladesh collapsed from 137 for 6 (when Khaled Mashud was bowled by Hogg) to 139 all out in three overs, as Ashraful went for 58 <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> really offering any resistance to the slow Australian bowlers.|$|E
25|$|The race {{had several}} attacks, the first {{meaningful}} one coming in only lap five from Aksana Papko of Belarus {{in an early}} bid to match her countryman Aliaksandr Lisouski's victory in the men's race on day one. She was chased down by a small group that included Svetlanan Paulikaite of Lithuania, Svitlana Halyuk of Ukraine and Ellen van Dijk of the Netherlands. The rest of the bunch was very attentive {{at this early stage}} and they were soon back together. Paulikaite struck out alone, but her effort did not come to anything. A crash in the middle period of the race took down Catherine Cheatley of New Zealand and Spain's Gema Pascual Torrecilla after a touch of wheels near the back. Cheatley rejoined after a few minutes, but Torrecilla pulled out having fallen more heavily. More attacks continued, but all were reeled. With less than eight laps to go, Van Dijk struck out alone <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> reacted. She overtook the Danish rider Trine Schmidt from an earlier escape and had soon almost half lap lead. The rest of the riders did not react and looked to each other. Despite having almost half a lap {{on the rest of the}} bunch, Van Dijk refused to start getting complacent and kept going. When a chase did materialise, it was too late and Van Dijk finished alone with a considerable gap to take the gold medal and the rainbow jersey. Behind Van Dijk the sprint was won by the 2007 champion Yumari Gonzalez Valdivieso of Cuba, ahead of Belinda Goss from Australia. Annalisa Cucinotta of Italy was fourth and Rebecca Quinn from the United States of America finished fifth.|$|E

25|$|Fisher was {{considered}} {{by those who}} met {{her to be a}} strong, witty businesswoman who was not afraid to speak her mind. In 1919, Fisher gave a speech {{at a meeting of the}} National Negro Business League. In her speech, Fisher told those assembled how to make a profit from catering and about her life growing up. She said she was a 57 year old woman who was not afraid to tell her age. In 1907, Fisher divorced her husband William and offered him a little over 100 dollars to not contest the divorce in court. William refused and was awarded nothing by the court system. Fisher said that her marriage wasn't a success and that for her to be successful she had to believe in herself <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else.</b> Fisher put her daughter Lucille through college and a music conservatory with the profits from her catering business. Fisher's first home was a 16 room house on Park Avenue which stood until 1960. In the 1920s she had a house built along Old Highway 63. During construction, she bought the materials, hired her own workers, and stayed on the property in a tent to oversee construction. Fisher was a celebrated personality in Columbia, with multiple articles written about her in the University Missourian. One particularly interesting article was her suggestions for Thanksgiving dinner. Fisher rented her properties out to black families who couldn't find housing easily in 1913. Annie gave out her recipes freely, but noted that she couldn't teach the common sense needed to cook her food. In a 1927 article in the Springfield Leader, Fisher's estimated net worth was approximately 100,000 dollars. Fisher was buried in a modest grave in 1938 at the Memorial Park Cemetery in Columbia.|$|E
500|$|Coincidentally Larry Hama, then {{an editor}} at Marvel, had begun to design {{characters}} and background for a series concept he was pitching that would be entitled Fury Force, about a team of futuristic super-soldiers affiliated with S.H.I.E.L.D., an existing Marvel Universe property combining military and science fiction genre elements. As Hama tells it, he got the job of writing for the series because Marvel had asked every other available creator to write it <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> would.

In June 1937, he signed up with NBC Radio to produce a series of six episodes under the name Streamlined Shakespeare, which also {{featured}} Barrie. The first program was Hamlet, which was well received by critics. The New York Times commented that [...] "Shakespeare's lines uttered dramatically by the voice of John Barrymore sweep through the 'ether' with a sound of finality; it seems that they are his words <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> could speak them with such lifelike force". Peters disagrees however, and considers that [...] "because he was desperate he pressed too hard and ended by caricaturing, not capturing, his great Shakespearean acting".|$|E

500|$|And the Band Played On was {{critically}} acclaimed {{and became a}} best-seller. Judith Eannarino of the Library Journal called it [...] "one {{of the most important}} books of the year", upon its release. It made Shilts both a star and a pariah for his coverage of the disease and the bitter politics in the gay community. He described his motivation to undertake the writing of the book in an interview after its release, saying, [...] "Any good reporter could have done this story, but I think the reason I did it, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> did, is because I am gay.

500|$|Bond next {{created the}} role of Mad Margaret in Ruddigore (1887; {{originally}} spelt [...] "Ruddygore"), which she regarded as her favourite of all the Gilbert and Sullivan roles, [...] "for it gave me the chance to show what I really could do as an actress." [...] The part was her largest to date, and Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte made her audition it {{for them to be}} sure that she could handle the responsibility. [...] "It was an awful ordeal. [...] I saw the three white faces looming out of the darkness as they sat close together; criticizing me, talking me over, with cold managerial detachment. It nearly killed me. [...] Perhaps it gave an added realism and abandon to my simulated madness, for indeed I was nearly mad with fear – but at any rate I came through triumphantly, they were all three of them delighted." [...] Bond was particularly nervous on opening night. [...] "I shook and tottered so much that Mad Margaret's staff was no mere adjunct, but an absolute necessity. Without it I should have fallen as I stood in the wings waiting to go on. Then some one gave me a push; I was there, on the stage, in the glare of the footlights, hundreds of eyes fixed on me, tier upon tier of dim white faces rising from floor to ceiling in the gloom. It was enough; I forgot myself, I was Mad Margaret <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else.</b> I made an immense success." [...] Cellier and Bridgeman seconded this assessment: ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{hypothetical}} case of Smith v. Jones in which Congress enacted a statute that says [...] "Smith wins", the majority {{would find it}} unconstitutional because it [...] "would create no new substantive law." [...] In the Chief Justice's view, it would: before the passage of {{the hypothetical}} statute, the law did not provide that Smith wins; after passage of the hypothetical statute, it does. For the Chief Justice, [...] "the question is whether its action constitutes an exercise of judicial power." [...] Both the hypothetical [...] "Smith wins" [...] statute and §8772 both have the same effect, which is essentially the legislature's [...] "'policy judgment'" [...] that one side in the case wins. He compared the majority's opinion, which found that §8772 left plenty of issues for the District Court to adjudicate, to [...] "a constitutional Maginot Line, easily circumvented by the simplest maneuver of taking away every defense against Smith's victory, without saying 'Smith wins.'" [...] Section8772 only required the courts to make two decisions—that Bank Markazi had an equitable interest in the assets <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> did—that were both already clear before §8772 was enacted. By the majority's view of [...] "plenty", [...] the Chief Justice contended that, in the hypothetical case Smith v. Jones, the majority would uphold a judgment for Smith if the court finds that Jones was served notice of the lawsuit and the case was within the statute of limitations. Strongly criticizing the majority, the Chief Justice, quoting Federalist No. 48, concluded that the majority's [...] "failure to enforce [...] in a case as clear as this reduces Article III to a mere 'parchment barrier against the encroaching spirit' of legislative power." ...|$|E

500|$|Stage 9 was {{the first}} major {{mountain}} stage, featuring two ascents of Mount Etna, including a summit finish. It was on this day that strong overall favorite Alberto Contador first seized control of the race. Just after 's José Rujano attacked out of the leading group on the road on the way up to Etna for the last time, Contador did likewise. Rujano struggled mightily to hold Contador's wheel <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> came close to reaching the pair. Contador won the stage, his first Giro stage win despite having won the Italian Grand Tour in 2008, and immediately attained a minute's advantage in the overall classification. In his five previous Grand Tour wins, Contador had never lost the race lead after taking it, but he had also never taken it so early on in the race. As teams who have riders with a legitimate chance to win a race overall will generally try to avoid defending the lead for too many days, lest they tire their support riders out early and leave their leader vulnerable, there was speculation that Contador would tactically relinquish the jersey. The Spaniard himself hinted that such a move would be in his plans. This would be likeliest to happen in the heavily undulating stage 11. The breakaway group for this stage was hard-fought and late-forming, since someone from its number could potentially become the new race leader. While 's Christophe Le Mével, who entered the day third overall and had on two other occasions come within a time bonus of claiming the jersey, made the group, neither he nor anyone in it was destined to take pink. Largely under the impetus of Michele Scarponi's [...] team, the breakaway group was caught before the finish. Contador {{and the rest of the}} overall favorites finished at the front of the race, with riders well down in the standings claiming the time bonuses, meaning Contador retained the race leadership after all.|$|E
