40|$|Trade {{liberalization}} {{is often}} considered a sufficient prerequisite for inducing desirable structural <b>adjustment.</b> <b>Entry</b> of transition economies (TEs) into the European Union (EU) should induce structural adjustments {{at the firm}} level to move trade and production profiles closer to the EU's patterns. At the macroeconomic level this should manifest itself in a rise in intra-industry trade based on horizontal product differentiation. Trade liberalization in TEs to date provides little empirical support for such a process as there are strong signs of persistent interindustry trade and vertical product differentiation. This may have come about because of the minimalist role of government in TEs. But also restricted access to foreign capital, information asymmetries, and the persistent lack of well-functioning markets provide strong arguments in favor offormulating industrial policies to strengthen the competitiveness of manufacturing firms rather than the regional approach that is more typical of the EU. The EU's legal framework leaves room for designing such a policy with subsidies, provided it is adjudicated as compatible with the EU's competition policy. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{motivating}} intuition is {{that the}} presence of nonmaximizing agents induces maximizing agents to take advantage of them and that this might magnify the effect of small deviations from maximizing behavior. This intuition is explored using a simple dynamic model. With an inflexible entry process, small deviations from maximizing behavior may have a substantial impact on the allocation of gains from trade. With a flexible entry process, the effect is dampened by <b>adjustments</b> in <b>entry.</b> Yet these deviations result in a first-order efficiency loss, in contrast to the second-order loss that one would expect from looking at standard static models.

40|$|Objective: The aims of {{this study}} were to examine the {{influence}} of maternal hypoadiponectinemia on the risk of varying degrees of gestational hyperglycemia as well as on ethnic differences in circulating levels of adiponectin. Methods: A case-control study nested within a prospective cohort of healthy pregnant women compared those who developed gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM, N = 80), or had an impaired glucose challenge test (GCT) non-GDM (defined as 1 hr plasma glucose > 140 mg/dl after a 50 -g oral glucose load when screening for GDM but did not meet the diagnostic criteria for GDM by a diagnostic oral glucose tolerance test, N = 128) to normal controls (N = 557). Concentrations of serum adiponectin were determined at entry (~ 17 weeks) and during the 3 rd trimester. Results: With multivariable <b>adjustment,</b> <b>entry</b> hypoadiponectinemia (the lowest tertile vs. other tertiles pooled) was strongly associated with an increased risk of GDM (AOR 2. 68, 95 % CI 1. 62 - 4. 41) and with impaired GCT non-GDM (AOR 1. 58, 95 % CI 1. 05 - 2. 38). This association persisted after adjustment for pregravid BMI {{despite the fact that the}} risk in obese women with low adiponectin was higher. Similar data were obtained during the 3 rd trimester. The concentration of adiponectin during the 3 rd trimester was significantly lower in African Americans compared to Hispanics or Caucasians and this difference was detectable in both cases and controls (p < 0. 05 or p < 0. 01 for each). Conclusions: The present results identified a unique graded association between hypoadiponectinemia during early pregnancy with risk of GDM and less severe hyperglycemia non-GDM independent of maternal BMI. The relationship persisted to the 3 rd trimester. African American women have lower adiponectin level than Caucasian or Hispanic women.

30|$|High <b>adjustment</b> or <b>entry</b> costs into {{entrepreneurship}} {{could also}} contribute to an observed self-employment premium because the future earnings of entrepreneurs would need to compensate for these costs. One such adjustment cost is the initial investment needed {{to set up a}} small business, often financed through credit. If credit markets are imperfect {{and it is difficult to}} obtain credit, then self-employed entrepreneurs must be paid more than they could get as employees in order to compensate them for the high costs of credit. On the other hand, in low income countries many self-employment opportunities may require little capital, while searching for higher-paid wage employment may involve relocating or other expensive search costs. 1 For those facing credit constraints, starting a low-level business as a petty trader or farmer may entail less upfront cost than searching for a wage job. In this case, imperfect credit markets would create a self-employment earnings penalty.|$|R
40|$|The basic intuition that motivates {{this paper}} is that the {{presence}} of non-maximizing agents creates incentives for maximizing agents to take advantage of them, and when "frictions" are sufficiently small, these incentives might translate seemingly small deviations from maximizing behavior into non-negligible effects. This paper explores this intuition by looking at a simple dynamic model, which in reduced form can be described by the elementary demand-supply paradigm. The dynamic model allows to caputre explicitly the special efforts that the maximizing agnets devote to gain {{at the expense of the}} non-maximizing ones. In a mdoel with inflexible entry process, it is shown that, when market frictions are relatively insignificant, small deviations from maximizing behavior have substatntial impact on market outcomes. In a model with flexible entry process, the price effect of deviations from rationality is dampened by <b>adjustments</b> in <b>entry.</b> Yet these deviations result in forst order effieciency loss, in contrast to the second order loss that one would expect from looking at standard static models. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{association}} between social adjustment and recurrent affective episodes was examined in 27 recovered bipolar patients and 24 recovered unipolar {{patients who had}} been receiving maintenance treatment for at least 1 year. Social adjustment variables and psychiatric status were assessed by bimonthly interviews over the 1 -year period using the Social Adjustment Scale (SAS) and the Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC). Variations in the social adjustment scores were analyzed in the 2 months preceding the onset of a recurrent affective episode. Furthermore, social <b>adjustment</b> variables at <b>entry</b> into the study were assessed to investigate whether there was any {{association between}} these and the potential timing of a recurrent episode. Results revealed no significant deterioration in social adjustment during the 2 months preceding a recurrent affective episode. However, it was demonstrated {{that there was a}} relationship between a patient's overall social <b>adjustment</b> score at <b>entry</b> into the study and the onset of recurrent affective episodes, independent of any residual depressive symptomatology. Specifically, impaired work adjustment in bipolar and unipolar patients was associated with recurrent episodes. Impaired social and leisure activities adjustment in bipolar patients was also associated with recurrent episodes, and impaired marital adjustment in unipolar patients was associated with recurrent episodes. These results suggest that social maladjustment could be a risk factor for both unipolar and bipolar recurrent affective episodes and that impairment in specific areas of social functioning could be used to predict outcome. 0 SCOPUS: ar. jFLWINinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

Supporting the contention that diversification leads to organizational adjustments, {{the results show that}} diversifying firms are less likely to adopt computerized dispatching systems for their taxicabs and make significant changes in their formal contract structures governing asset ownership. Consistent with the theory, diversification is associated with falling taxi productivity. Comparing the productivity of diversified and focused start-ups and incumbent firms reveals that the organizational change component of diversification accounts for an 18 % decrease in paid ride-miles per taxi.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} entry regulations and firing costs on cross-country differences in income and productivity. We construct a general equilibrium industry- dynamics model and quantitatively evaluate it using the cross-country data on entry costs and firing costs. Entry costs lower overall productivity in an economy by keeping low- productivity establishments in operation and making the establishment size inefficiently large. Firing costs lower productivity by reducing the reallocation of labor from low- productivity establishments to high-productivity establishments. The linear regression of the data on the model prediction accounts for 27 % of the cross-sectional variation in total factor productivity. Moving the level of entry costs and firing costs from the U.

30|$|This paper {{studies the}} link between trade reforms and labor informality in Argentina using a long time series {{spanning}} the 1980 – 2001 period. We explore cross-section mechanisms, that operate at the industry level, and time-series mechanisms, that operate at a general equilibrium level. We argue that firms can substitute formal with informal workers to smooth a negative trade shock. In this setting, industries exposed to larger tariffs cuts could experience increases in informality. In general equilibrium, there can be additional aggregate impacts in both manufacturing and non-traded sectors through workers reallocation among sectors, wage <b>adjustments,</b> and firm <b>entry</b> and exit. Using the cross-section variation of the data and an instrumental variable strategy we explore empirically the cross-section mechanisms. We find that reductions in industry tariffs increase labor informality, and the effect is differentially stronger in industries with {{a larger share of}} small-size firms. Using the time-series variation of the data, we are able to identify some of the general equilibrium effects. We find that the fall in the average national tariff decreased aggregate informality in the manufacturing sector but increased it in the non-traded sector.|$|R

We use a representative panel data set of French establishments that contains direct measures of these various costs as well as measures of entries and exits for the years 1992 and 1996. First, we show that our panel data source is able to reproduce results obtained by Abowd and Kramarz (2003) when we use the cross-section dimension. Our estimates show that collective terminations are much more expensive than individual terminations: legislation, namely the requirement {{to set up a}} "social plan" in case of collective terminations, magnifies firing costs. Collective terminations entail very large fixed costs. Termination costs are essentially linear in the number of terminated workers, with collective terminations being much more expensive. The costs of retirement are concave in the number of retired workers with a fixed cost component which is smaller than the one estimated for terminations, and quite smaller than that obtained by Abowd and Kramarz (2003). Finally, we find that hiring costs are small and seem only present when hiring on CDI; costs of hiring on short-term contracts are almost zero. Finally, the fixed (firm-specific) component of hiring costs is very small. <b>Adjustment</b> costs Terminations <b>Entry</b> Exit...|$|R

The present study adds to the limited literature on children’s transitions from early education and care into school by examining whether schools can support this transition through information sharing between elementary school teachers and early education programs. We examined information sharing {{as a predictor of}} social and academic adjustment {{during the first year of}} school for a sample of young children (N =  932) in Norway, where preschool is nearly universal. We find that half of first grade teachers in the sample (64 %) reported no contact with preschools; about one quarter (23 %) contacted preschools and received both general information about the preschool and specific information about the child, and smaller percentages contacted the preschools and received either general information about the program/curriculum only (8 %) or specific information about the child only (5 %). When teachers received both types of information, children were one and half times more likely to be rated as having positive social <b>adjustment</b> at school <b>entry</b> (OR =  1.51, p >  0.05) compared with other children. Mediation analyses revealed significant indirect links between this form of information sharing, children’s initial social and academic adjustment, and five academic and social outcomes mid-year in first grade. When initial adjustment was accounted for, we also found a slight negative effect of contact, suggesting that not all contact may be equally positive for children.|$|R

30|$|In {{the trade}} literature, firms respond to tariffs cuts by {{reducing}} wages and by firing workers who reallocate to comparative advantage sectors. In turn, if informal workers are “cheaper” than formal workers, because of various taxes associated with formality, firms {{can increase the}} fraction of informal workers as an adjustment mechanism. Thus, increasing tax evasion could be a strategy to smooth the negative trade shock. In this setting, industries exposed to larger tariff cuts could experience increases in informality. In general equilibrium, there can be additional aggregate impacts in both manufacturing and non-traded sectors. These additional impacts are explained by the usual trade adjustment mechanisms of workers reallocation among sectors, wage <b>adjustments,</b> and firm <b>entry</b> and exit. For instance, as workers reallocate out of an industry, they can get absorbed into the non-traded sector. To the extent that these workers are employed informally, tariff cuts {{can be associated with}} higher informality in the non-traded sector. However, if, for tax evasion reasons, exposed industries fire formal workers in higher proportion relative to informal workers, formal wages may decline with respect to informal wages. Formal workers may become cheaper and informality may decline, both in manufactures and in non-traded sectors. Further, the loss of tariff protection can induce firms to exit the market. As more efficient firms stay, provided {{they are likely to be}} more formal than smaller exiting firms, informality can decline as well through this channel. In the literature, it has been often difficult to disentangle these different mechanisms.|$|R
30|$|Becoming {{socially}} {{accepted and}} integrated {{is especially important}} for newcomers without prior organizational or work-related experiences, as is the case for apprentices in transition from compulsory school to education and training at the upper secondary level in Switzerland (Stalder and Nägele 2011). During organizational entry, apprentices cannot refer to their own work- and organization-related experiences, which would help them to adjust to the new situation. Although theories on social exchange and interpersonal relationships in organizations highlight that organizational socialization is a mutual process and should not be conceptualized as being solely the newcomers’ responsibility (Schaubroeck et al. 2013), organizational socialization and learning depends substantially on the apprentices’ willingness and capability to adapt rapidly. These attempts need to be supported by trainers and coworkers with the aim to integrate and instruct newcomers, which entails the social acceptance of the apprentices (Masdonati and Lamamra 2009). Socialization and learning in an apprenticeship is situated in a real-life situation and is therefore a social learning process (Wenger et al. 2002), with the apprentices being responsible for engaging in and contributing reliably to the work at hand. Additionally, the individual characteristics of an apprentice, e.g., her perceived pre-entry person–occupation fit (Nägele and Neuenschwander 2014) or his reliability, assiduity, or punctuality (Stalder and Stricker 2009), shape this socialization process. The organization can support a positive <b>adjustment</b> during organizational <b>entry</b> through their onboarding strategies (Klein and Polin 2012). It is important that newcomers get the information and guidance they need, which can be achieved by allocating enough resources to support them.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In SPARCL, {{treatment}} with atorvastatin 80 mg daily reduced stroke risk {{in patients with}} recent stroke or TIA and no known coronary heart disease by 16 % versus placebo over 4. 9 years of follow-up. The purpose of this secondary analysis {{was to determine whether}} men and women similarly benefited from randomization to statin treatment. METHODS: The effect of sex on treatment-related reductions in stroke and other cardiovascular outcomes were analyzed with Cox regression modeling testing for sex by treatment interactions. RESULTS: Women (n= 1908) constituted 40 % of the SPARCL study population. At baseline, men (n= 2823) were younger (62. 0 +/- 0. 21 versus 63. 9 +/- 0. 27 years), had lower systolic BPs (138. 1 +/- 0. 35 versus 139. 5 +/- 0. 47 mm Hg), higher diastolic BPs (82. 2 +/- 0. 20 versus 81. 0 +/- 0. 25 mm Hg), more frequently had a history of smoking (73 % versus 38 %), and had lower total cholesterol (207. 0 +/- 0. 54 versus 218. 9 +/- 0. 67 mg/dL) and LDL-C levels (132 +/- 0. 45 versus 134 +/- 0. 57 mg/dL) than women. Use of antithrombotics and antihypertensives were similar. After prespecified <b>adjustment</b> for region, <b>entry</b> event, time since event, and age, there were no sex by treatment interactions for the combined risk of nonfatal and fatal stroke (treatment Hazard Ratio, HR= 0. 84, 95 % CI 0. 68, 1. 02 in men versus HR= 0. 84, 95 % CI 0. 63, 1. 11 in women; treatment x sex interaction P= 0. 99), major cardiac events (HR= 0. 61, 95 % CI 0. 42, 0. 87 in men versus HR= 0. 76, 95 % CI 0. 48, 1. 21 in women; P= 0. 45), major cardiovascular events (HR= 0. 78, 95 % CI 0. 65, 0. 93 in men versus HR= 0. 84, 95 % CI 0. 65, 1. 07 in women; P= 0. 63), revascularization procedures (HR= 0. 50, 95 % CI 0. 37, 0. 67 in men versus HR= 0. 76, 95 % CI 0. 46, 1. 24 in women; P= 0. 17), or any CHD event (HR= 0. 54, 95 % CI 0. 41, 0. 72 in men versus 0. 67 95 % CI 0. 46, 0. 98 in women; P= 0. 40). CONCLUSIONS: Stroke and other cardiovascular events are similarly reduced with atorvastatin 80 mg/d in men and women with recent stroke or TIA. status: publishe...|$|R
