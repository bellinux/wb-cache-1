However, any downward revision in the book values of the assets is immediately written off to the Profit & Loss account. Under IFRS, an asset {{is considered to be}} impaired (and is thus written down) if its carrying amount is greater than its <b>recoverable</b> <b>amount.</b> The <b>recoverable</b> <b>amount</b> is the greater of the asset's value in use (present value of future values) or net realizable value.|$|R

50|$|The limited {{liability}} partnership was formed {{in the aftermath of}} the collapse of real estate and energy prices in Texas in the 1980s. This collapse led to a large wave of bank and savings and loan failures. Because the <b>amounts</b> <b>recoverable</b> from the banks were small, efforts were made to recover assets from the lawyers and accountants that had advised the banks in the early 1980s. The reason was that partners in law and accounting firms were subject to the possibility of huge claims which would bankrupt them personally, and the first LLP laws were passed to shield innocent members of these partnerships from liability.|$|R

40|$|Objective of IAS 36 Impairment {{of assets}} is to {{prescribe}} procedures {{that apply to}} an undertaking to ensure that its assets are carried at amounts not exceeding their <b>recoverable</b> <b>amount</b> if the carrying <b>amount</b> is <b>recoverable</b> in full.

Also, the rule specifies that a business case should include (lessen) a loss of value and should provide information on assets that have depreciated. There may be situations in which external influences or changes in production methods within the entity led to decreased value of an asset far more than is acknowledged in annual depreciation costs.

50|$|The {{calculation}} of the award in current South African law {{is different from that}} of Roman law, where the amount awarded would be calculated {{on the basis of the}} difference between the price actually given and the price the purchaser would have paid if he had known of the defect. It is, in other words, a subjective test. In South African law, the measure of relief is usually the difference between the actual purchase price and the value of the article in its defective state. The value of the defective thing must be ascertained as it is in the case of failure to make available the thing sold: by reference to the market price, if there is one. If no market price can be established, the best evidence available must be used to establish the actual value of the thing sold. Another means of assessing the <b>amount</b> <b>recoverable</b> is by referring to the cost of repairing the defect that existed at the time of sale and/or remedying any deterioration that might have occurred as a result of the defect. Only reasonable costs of repair may be taken into account in this regard.|$|E

50|$|A surety is {{entitled}} to contribution from a co-surety in respect of their common liability. This particular right is {{not the result of}} any contract, but is derived from a equity, on the ground of equality of burden and benefit, and exists whether the sureties be bound jointly, or jointly and severally, and by the same, or different, instruments. There is, however, no right of contribution where each surety is severally bound for a given portion only of the guaranteed debt; nor {{in the case of a}} surety for a surety; nor where a person becomes a surety jointly with another and at the latter's request. Contribution may be enforced, either before payment, or as soon as the surety has paid more than his share of the common debt; and the <b>amount</b> <b>recoverable</b> is now always regulated by the number of solvent sureties, though formerly this rule only prevailed in equity. In the event of the bankruptcy of a surety, proof can be made against his estate by a co-surety for any excess over the latter's contributive share. The right of contribution is not the only right possessed by co-sureties against each other, but they are also entitled to the benefit of all securities which have been taken by any one of them as an indemnity against the liability incurred for the principal debtor.|$|E

40|$|Plaintiff worked {{continuously}} as {{a welder}} from 1925 through 1950 when he quit welding {{and went into}} a business from which he {{was never able to}} realize a substantial income. In 1953, plaintiff, age 49 and in good health, was permanently and totally disabled in an auto accident. In his action for damages, evidence was admitted to show the prevailing wages paid to welders in plaintiff’s community as well as plaintiff’s own earnings as a welder prior to 1951. A substantial part of these earnings was derived from employment outside of the community. On appeal, Held: admissibility of such evidence is in the sound discretion of the trial court and no abuse of discretion was shown. The precise basis upon which the court deemed this evidence to be relevant, however, is unclear.

40|$|In {{a series}} of studies aimed at {{investigating}} the role of environmental surfaces in the transmission of certain respiratory virus infections, it was shown that small amounts of nasal mucus containing rhinovirus (infectious mucus) can spread from fingertips to door knobs, faucet handles, or other environmental surfaces and remain infectious for many hours. These surfaces can serve as a reservoir of virus and may provide sufficient infectious material to contaminate hands. Recent studies have shown that once virus is on the fingers, it may be transferred to the nasal and conjunctival mucosa by means of autoinoculation. It has been estimated that as little as 1. 0 plaque-forming unit can produce an infection in a susceptible human. In the present experiments, the amount of rhinovirus transmitted from fingers contaminated with infectious mucus to environmental surfaces and from there onto the fingers of a volunteer who touched the contaminated objects was quantitated, and the efficiency of transfer was studied. From 3 to 1, 800 plaque-forming units of rhinovirus were recovered from the fingertips of volunteers (recipients) who handled either a door knob or a faucet that had previously been manipulated by another volunteer (donor) whose fingers were contaminated with infectious mucus. The average amount of rhinovirus recovered from the fingers of the recipients was approximately 13. 5 % of the <b>amount</b> <b>recoverable</b> from the fingers of the donor. In experiments in which there was direct hand-to-hand contact between donor and recipient, about 6. 7 % of the virus present on the fingertips of donors was recoverable from the recipients...|$|E
40|$|Premiums {{constitute}} {{the cost of}} insurance protection. There are however authors who tend to find some tax elements in them. This article aims at presenting {{the conditions in which}} such a view may be regarded as correct and when the marks which are the characteristics of taxes can also appear in premiums paid on account of insurance as part of the Polish insurance system. Taxes are commonly regarded as being obligatory and not subject to refund. Compulsion cannot, however, be the right criterion that differentiates taxes from other payments and also from premiums. Although premiums are compulsory payments paid by the insured they cannot be compared to taxes. It is not because of the fiscal reasons that obligatory insurance was introduced. It was destined to popularize it in those fields in which such popularization proved to be necessary. Premiums as a cost for insurance protection must be equivalent. The degree of the rate of payment depends upon the realization of the principle of equilibrium between the premiums and the <b>amount</b> <b>recoverable.</b> In practice the premiums paid by the insured are not only destined to make good any loss or damage or to pay benefits, but also form a preventive fund and a reserve fund. The part of premiums which constitutes the preventive fund can be regarded as a specific kind of tax securing financial means for undertakings preventing the occurrence of events. The other part of the premiums which provides for the reserve fund bears even more distinctive marks of a tax. This fund is a form of revenue subject to refunding. As the insurance company has never exercised its right to that fund the payments on that account may be considered a permanent source of budget income.
