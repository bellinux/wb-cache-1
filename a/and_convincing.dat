5|$|In a 5–4 opinion {{written by}} Justice Harry Blackmun, the Supreme Court of the United States vacated the Appellate Division's ruling, holding that states seeking to sever parental rights irrevocably must show at least clear <b>and</b> <b>convincing</b> {{evidence}} of neglect. Justice William Rehnquist, joined by three others, dissented, {{on the grounds}} that the majority's focus on a single aspect of the law disregarded the fairness of the scheme as a whole. The ruling has since been criticized for its intrusion into state affairs. Because of the ruling, all states previously using the fair preponderance standard changed to the clear <b>and</b> <b>convincing</b> standard, but California has since abandoned the clear <b>and</b> <b>convincing</b> standard and returned to the fair preponderance standard.|$|E

5000|$|Reviewing the Ace Double release, Anthony Boucher {{praised the}} novel as [...] "built up with the detail of a Heinlein and the satire of a Kornbluth.

5|$|Spoilt Rotten {{received}} a mostly favourable reception in the media. Dalrymple was praised {{for carrying out}} a thought-provoking <b>and</b> <b>convincing</b> analysis of a newly emerged cultural phenomenon which sees emotion substituted for reason. Some critics, however, accused the author of cynicism and misanthropic pessimism in his approach, and the historian Noel Malcolm claimed that Dalrymple had overreached in his analysis.|$|E
5|$|A {{state may}} place {{the burden on}} the {{defendant}} has to prove incompetence by the preponderance of the evidence, but the state cannot require the defendant to prove incompetence by a higher standard, such as clear <b>and</b> <b>convincing</b> evidence. The right to competence cannot be waived because waivers of constitutional rights are required to be knowing and voluntary. The state may involuntarily medicate the defendant in order to make her competent for trial, but only after factual showings that there is a state interest in punishment (as opposed to civil confinement), that the medication is likely to result in competence, and that the medication is necessary to restore competence.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} {{then turned}} {{its attention to}} the question of a standard of proof in loss-of-citizenship cases. Terrazas had argued and the 7th Circuit had agreed that the 14th Amendment, as interpreted in Afroyim, had left Congress without any constitutional authority to set the standard of proof for intent to relinquish citizenship at a level any lower than one of clear <b>and</b> <b>convincing</b> evidence. The Supreme Court majority rejected this claim and held that Congress was within its rights to specify a standard of preponderance of evidence (more likely than not) when cases alleging loss of US citizenship were involved.|$|E

5|$|Colleagues urged Charlton {{to stand}} for the state electoral {{district}} of Waratah, and on 5 December 1903 Charlton became the second member for the district in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. His representation of that district was short-lived, as the next year he transferred to Northumberland, replacing John Norton. Charlton became the unofficial spokesperson for the miners, speaking principally about mining matters in parliament. In 1909 a coal miners' strike struck New South Wales and Charlton was called upon by the Colliery Employees' Federation to represent {{it in front of}} a wage board. Charlton was unsuccessful in gaining better conditions for the miners but he did settle the dispute, talking to miners around the state <b>and</b> <b>convincing</b> them to return to work. He resigned from state politics and in 1910 Charlton wrested the federal Division of Hunter from the sitting Frank Liddell. Hunter has remained a safe Labor seat ever since.|$|E
