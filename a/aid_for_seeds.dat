50|$|The Seed Herbarium Image Project (SHIP), is an {{initiative}} of the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University to create a web-based repository of high-resolution digital images documenting the morphology of woody plant seeds and selected fruit structures. Headquartered at the Arboretum’s Dana Greenhouse facility and coordinated and photographed by curatorial assistant Julie McIntosh Shapiro, the Seed Herbarium Image Project supports the work of educators and professionals in horticulture and the botanical sciences, particularly in conservation research and management of rare and endangered species. The digitized images of seeds offer an important new <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> teaching <b>seed</b> identification—a fundamental skill in plant propagation, hybridization, and distribution—and serve {{as a resource for}} nurserymen, horticulturists, botanical curators, taxonomists, ecologists, and the general public. SHIP also provides an online resource for botanical institutions and nurseries to verify their collections and inventories. SHIP is made possible through the generous support of the Stanley Smith Horticultural Trust, Cabot Family Charitable Trust, and the J. Frank Schmidt Family Charitable Foundation.|$|R

40|$|Summary Although {{the concept}} of <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade has quickly gained {{prominence}} among aid donors as well as aid recipients, relatively {{little is known about}} its impact on trade-related performance. We use data on a large subset of developing countries for recent years to examine the extent to which various types of <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade have helped recipient countries' trade performance. We find that <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade facilitation reduces the costs of trading. Moreover <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade has an overall positive and significant impact on exports. This effect is entirely driven by aid to economic infrastructure, while the other main category of <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade, <b>aid</b> to productive capacity, has no discernible effect on exports. Its strong positive association with exports at the sectoral level is due to an allocation skewed toward already well performing sectors. <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade <b>aid</b> effectiveness trade cost of trading exports...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} a range of {{constant}} temperatures (10 - 35 °C) on the germination of Cucurbita pepo var. styriaca seed was investigated to quantify the relationship between temperature and the rate of seed germination and to study the effect of conditioning temperature on the relationship. Seeds were conditioned on moist filter paper either at 25 or 20 °C for 14 days in an incubator. No seeds of C. pepo conditioned at 25 °C, germinated at 35 °C within 312 h. <b>For</b> <b>seeds</b> conditioned at 20 °C, germination occurred at temperatures between 15 and 5 °C within 312 h. The base (Tb, estimated from extrapolation), optimum (To) and ceiling (Tc) temperatures determined were: Tb = 17. 6 °C, To = 28 °C and Tc> 35 °C <b>for</b> <b>seeds</b> conditioned at 20 °C compared with Tb = 13. 7 °C, To = 25 - 27. 5 °C and Tc> 35 °C <b>for</b> <b>seeds</b> conditioned at 25 °C.

40|$|This chapter {{explores the}} {{effectiveness}} of <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade in promoting trade – both exports and imports – and conditions which tend to make it most effective. The review provides abundant {{evidence to suggest that}} <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade is indeed broadly correlated with increases in trade. <b>Aid</b> <b>for</b> trade works best when it is focused on reducing the costs of trading through improvements in infrastructure, trade facilitation, trade-related public institutions (such as customs, standards administration, and export promotion), and polices (including eliminating policy barriers to competition). <b>Aid</b> <b>for</b> trade – in varying forms – directed to low income countries is particularly helpful in promoting trade. Analysis in this chapter suggests that <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade destined to low and lower-middle income countries is likely to have a high pay-off. Typically, one dollar invested in <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade is associated with an increase of nearly USD 8 of exports from all developing countries – while one dollar of <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade to International Development Association (IDA) -eligible poorest countries amounted to US 20 in new exports and to USD 9 for all low and lower-middle income countries...|$|R

House Bill 3646, 81 st Legislature, 2009, repealed the TEC, § 42. 2512, related to additional state <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> professional salaries; § 42. 2514, related to additional state <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> school employee health benefits; and § 42. 2516 (b) (2), related to the salary allotment for professional staff.
