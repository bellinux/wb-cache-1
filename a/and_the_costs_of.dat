40|$|International audienceThis paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between employee stock ownership <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> capital, <b>the</b> main determinant of shareholder value creation computed through economic value added (EVA). By reducing agency conflicts within the firm, we hypothesize that employee share ownership reduces <b>the</b> firm's <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> capital by affecting its two components, i. e. <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> equity <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> debt. We test this hypothesis in France, a leading country in terms of employee ownership, based on a panel of the 120 largest listed companies for the 2000 - 2011 period. We find: (i) no significant relationship between employee stock ownership <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> equity; (ii) a negative curvilinear relationship between employee stock ownership <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> debt; (ii) a negative curvilinear relationship relationship between employee stock ownership <b>and</b> <b>the</b> weighted average <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> capital. These results suggest debtholders regard ESO as positive as long it is moderate because it shifts risk from them to employees and that this effect is still perceptible in <b>the</b> weighted average <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> capital...|$|R

5|$|For many years, the United States {{produced}} more than 90% of commercially usable helium in the world, while extraction plants in Canada, Poland, Russia, and other nations produced the remainder. In the mid-1990s, a new plant in Arzew, Algeria, producing 17million cubic meters (600million cubic feet) began operation, with enough production to cover all of Europe's demand. Meanwhile, by 2000, the consumption of helium within the U.S. had risen to more than 15 million kg per year. In 2004–2006, additional plants in Ras Laffan, Qatar, and Skikda, Algeria were built. Algeria quickly became the second leading producer of helium. Through this time, both helium consumption <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> producing helium increased. From 2002 to 2007 helium prices doubled.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, the Brothers of the Christian Schools (the Christian Brothers) leased the property, {{purchasing}} it in 1945, {{and using}} it for sparkling wine production from 1950 to 1989. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. The Christian Brothers sold the property in 1989 because of declining market shares and vineyard yields, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> seismically retrofitting Greystone. The Heublein Company of Canada purchased the property and marketing rights to the Christian Brothers' brands in 1990, shortly after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake occurred. The earthquake damaged the Greystone Cellars building, rendering the northern portion of the building unusable.|$|E

5|$|Juveniles of some spiders in the {{families}} Anyphaenidae, Corinnidae, Clubionidae, Thomisidae and Salticidae feed on plant nectar. Laboratory {{studies show that}} they do so deliberately and over extended periods, and periodically clean themselves while feeding. These spiders also prefer sugar solutions to plain water, which indicates that they are seeking nutrients. Since many spiders are nocturnal, the extent of nectar consumption by spiders may have been underestimated. Nectar contains amino acids, lipids, vitamins and minerals in addition to sugars, and {{studies have shown that}} other spider species live longer when nectar is available. Feeding on nectar avoids the risks of struggles with prey, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> producing venom and digestive enzymes.|$|E

This relationship (Kirwan left GSA in December 1966, before the letter indicating intention to lease was set to Nassif), and GSA's irregular leasing of the building, became public knowledge in August 1970. An internal GSA audit was critical of the leasing process <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> the lease.|$|E
