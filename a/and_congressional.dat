5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2008 {{legislature}} year, Rice was still in Iraq on his third tour of duty.

5|$|Construction {{accounted}} for roughly 90 {{percent of the}} Manhattan Project's total cost. The day after Groves took over, he and Marshall took a train to Tennessee to inspect the site that Marshall had chosen for the proposed production plant at Oak Ridge. Groves was suitably impressed with the site, and steps were taken to condemn the land. Protests, legal appeals, <b>and</b> <b>congressional</b> inquiries were to no avail. By mid-November US Marshals were tacking notices to vacate on farmhouse doors, and construction contractors were moving in.|$|E
5|$|Gingrich {{and others}} in the House, {{including}} the newly minted Gang of Seven, railed against what they saw as ethical lapses during the nearly 40 years of Democratic control for almost 40 years. The House banking scandal <b>and</b> <b>Congressional</b> Post Office scandal were emblems of the exposed corruption. Gingrich himself was among members of the House who had written NSF checks on the House bank. He had overdrafts on twenty-two checks, including a $9,463 check to the Internal Revenue Service in 1990.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, {{criticism}} {{over the}} Johnson Administration's {{handling of the}} Vietnam War began to grow, with Ford <b>and</b> <b>Congressional</b> Republicans expressing concern that the United States was not doing what was necessary to win the war. Public sentiment also began to move against Johnson, and the 1966 midterm elections saw a 47-seat swing {{in favor of the}} Republicans. This was not enough to give Republicans a majority in the House, but the victory gave Ford the opportunity to prevent the passage of further Great Society programs.|$|E

5|$|Since 1971, {{additional}} amendments {{have been}} passed by the General Assembly {{and approved by the}} voter to conform to provisions in the U.S. Constitution, rulings from the U.S. Supreme Court <b>and</b> <b>Congressional</b> statute. The voting age has been reduced to eighteen, voting residency requirements have been removed, and voter registration conforms to the Motor Voter Act. Additionally, the Virginia Constitution now provides for a General Assembly session following a governor’s veto, and {{the right of the people}} to hunt, fish and harvest game is guaranteed. In 2006, Virginians passed an amendment limiting marriage to “unions between one man and one woman”. That has since been overturned by Obergefell v. Hodges (2015).|$|E
5|$|The U.S. {{position}} that the Baltic states had been forcibly annexed would remain its official stance for the following 51 years. Subsequent U.S. presidents <b>and</b> <b>Congressional</b> resolutions reaffirmed {{the substance of the}} Declaration. President Dwight D. Eisenhower asserted the right of the Baltic states to independence in an address to the United States Congress on January 6, 1957. After confirming the Helsinki Final Act in July 1975, the United States House of Representatives passed a resolution that the Final Act would not affect the continuity of U.S. recognition of the sovereignty of Baltic states.|$|E

5|$|The Welles Declaration {{established}} a five-decade non-recognition of the Baltic states' annexation. The document had major significance for overall U.S. policy toward Europe {{in the critical}} year of 1940. While the U.S. did not engage the Soviet Union militarily in the region, the Declaration enabled the Baltic states to maintain independent diplomatic missions, and Executive Order 8484 protected Baltic financial assets. Its essence was supported by all subsequent U.S. presidents <b>and</b> <b>Congressional</b> resolutions. The Baltic states re-established their independence in 1990–91.|$|E
5|$|The {{debate has}} played out {{across a wide}} {{spectrum}} of media, including newspapers, magazines, web blogs, <b>and</b> <b>congressional</b> research arms like the Government Accountability Office. Each side has presented different arguments on the best approach to the problem, but most of the participants favor the continuation of the DD(X) program or the reinstatement of the Iowa-class battleships to the Naval Vessel Register. The s, the s, and s have entered the debate as options put forward for naval gunfire support, while others advocate the use of specifically designed close air support planes and newer missile systems that can loiter in an area as a replacement for naval gunfire.|$|E
5|$|Brown had {{stated that}} {{win or lose}} in his 2014 New Hampshire Senatorial bid, he planned to remain a New Hampshire {{resident}} {{for the rest of}} his life.

5|$|During the West Virginia Democratic Party Senatorial Convention held at Moorefield in August 1886, White {{proposed}} and advocated the first tariff reform and anti-monopoly resolutions ever passed and {{adopted by a}} West Virginia Democratic Party Convention. Prior to its passage at the convention, White's proposal received strong opposition. Tariff reform and anti-monopoly resolutions similar to White's proposal were adopted by the national Democratic Party {{as part of its}} 1888 platform. White had been among the first Democratic Party members in Hampshire County to openly declare his opposition to the fiscal policies of the administration of United States President Grover Cleveland. Under White's leadership, Hampshire County's Democratic delegation was the first Democratic county organization in West Virginia to hold public meetings in opposition to Cleveland's fiscal policies. As the county executive committee chairman, White was the first Democrat in Hampshire County to deliver a public speech denouncing these policies. By 1897, White had participated as a delegate from Hampshire County to most of the Senatorial <b>and</b> <b>Congressional</b> Democratic Party conventions in West Virginia, and every state Gubernatorial convention with the exception of one.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{implemented}} his own form of Presidential Reconstruction– {{a series}} of proclamations directing the seceded states to hold conventions and elections to re-form their civil governments. When Southern states returned many of their old leaders, and passed Black Codes to deprive the freedmen of many civil liberties, Congressional Republicans refused to seat legislators from those states and advanced legislation to overrule the Southern actions. Johnson vetoed their bills, <b>and</b> <b>Congressional</b> Republicans overrode him, setting a pattern {{for the remainder of}} his presidency. Johnson opposed the Fourteenth Amendment, which gave citizenship to former slaves. In 1866, Johnson went on an unprecedented national tour promoting his executive policies, seeking to destroy his Republican opponents. As the conflict between the branches of government grew, Congress passed the Tenure of Office Act, restricting Johnson's ability to fire Cabinet officials. When he persisted in trying to dismiss Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, he was impeached by the House of Representatives, and narrowly avoided conviction in the Senate and removal from office. After failing to win the 1868 Democratic presidential nomination, Johnson left office in 1869.|$|E
5|$|Marshall's vice {{presidency}} is most remembered for a leadership crisis following a stroke that incapacitated Wilson in October 1919. Because {{of their personal}} dislike for him, Wilson's advisers and wife Edith sought to keep Marshall uninformed about the president's condition {{to prevent him from}} assuming presidential powers and duties. Many people, including cabinet officials <b>and</b> <b>Congressional</b> leaders, urged Marshall to become acting president, but he refused to forcibly assume the presidency for fear of setting a precedent. Without strong leadership in the executive branch, the administration's opponents defeated the ratification of the League of Nations treaty and effectively returned the United States to an isolationist foreign policy. Marshall is also the only known Vice President of the United States to have been exclusively targeted in an assassination attempt while in office.|$|E
