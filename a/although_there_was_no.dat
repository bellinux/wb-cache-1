5|$|A play, The Doom Bar, about {{smuggling}} and wrecking {{was written}} in the early 1900s by Arthur Hansen Bush. <b>Although</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> interest in London it was well received in America, and was scheduled to tour in Chicago and New York. A series of mishaps, blamed on the legendary wrecker Cruel Coppinger, culminating in a fire at Baltimore, caused the play to be considered cursed by America's actors' unions and its members were banned from appearing in it.|$|E
5|$|After San Diego's {{bankruptcy}} in 1852, the State of California took over city government {{and ran the}} city with an appointed Board of Trustees during 18521888.

5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> {{desire for}} a change in the form of {{government}} among most Brazilians, the Emperor was overthrown in a sudden coup d'état that had almost no support outside a clique of military leaders who desired a form of republic headed by a dictator. PedroII had become weary of emperorship and despaired over the monarchy's future prospects, despite its overwhelming popular support. He did not allow his ouster to be opposed and did not support any attempt to restore the monarchy. He spent {{the last two years of}} his life in exile in Europe, living alone on very little money.|$|E
5|$|At one time, one {{hurricane}} researcher {{identified a}} tropical storm over Cuba in late August, <b>although</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> evidence the storm actually existed. There was also a report of a hurricane over Louisiana on October22, although it is unknown if it was related to other storms in the season. There may have been additional unconfirmed tropical cyclones during the season. Meteorologist Christopher Landsea estimates up to six storms were missed from the official database, due to small tropical cyclone size, sparse ship reports, and relatively unpopulated coastlines.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{conflicting}} {{conclusions of the}} first two, a third post-mortem was conducted on 22 April by Kenneth Shorrock {{on behalf of the}} Metropolitan police, and Ben Swift on behalf of Simon Harwood.

The IPCC ruled in May 2011 that Hall had been reckless in making this claim, but had not intended to mislead.|$|E

5|$|Johnson fell {{unconscious}} {{after this}} duel and was dragged from the battlefield; {{in addition to}} his five wounds, twenty other bullets had hit his horse and gear. But the war in the Northwest was over. <b>Although</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> organized resistance to his presence in Canada, Harrison withdrew to Detroit because of supply problems.

5|$|On July22, 1916, a bomb {{exploded}} during the San Francisco Preparedness Day Parade, killing ten people and wounding 40. Police suspected Berkman, <b>although</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> evidence, and ultimately their investigation focused on two local labor activists, Thomas Mooney and Warren Billings. Although neither Mooney nor Billings were anarchists, Berkman {{came to their}} aid: raising a defense fund, hiring lawyers, and beginning a national campaign on their behalf. Mooney and Billings were convicted, with Mooney sentenced to death and Billings to life imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|Only {{one of the}} storms, the second, made landfall, {{doing so}} near Apalachicola, Florida.

The first hurricane killed two people when a ship passed through its winds for 14hours. The third hurricane, located in the western Caribbean Sea, did not affect land, although two ships experienced its strong winds. The final hurricane lasted three days across the western Atlantic, forcing one ship to halt its voyage due to storm damage.|$|E

5|$|Sverdrup's {{main task}} now {{was to keep}} his crew busy.

With the arrival of warmer weather as the 1895 summer approached, Sverdrup resumed daily ski practice. Amid these activities a full programme of meteorological, magnetic and oceanographic activities continued under Scott Hansen; Fram had become a moving oceanographic, meteorological and biological laboratory.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} in the High Court decided that <b>although</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> right at common law to have publicly provided legal representation in all cases, in some cases representation is appropriate to ensure a fair trial.

5|$|A {{large part}} of the {{population}} of the Northern states believed that the Davis government was somehow involved in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, and <b>although</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> evidence of their complicity, it was a political reality that had to be dealt with. One result was that the political radicals were able to force the government to prosecute those who had led the war against the Union. Mallory was one of the Confederate leaders who were charged with treason, among other things; on May 20, 1865, while he was still at La Grange, he was roused from his sleep at about midnight and taken into custody. From there he was taken to Fort Lafayette in New York Harbor, where he was confined as a political prisoner.|$|E
5|$|As objects {{increasingly}} {{closer in}} size to Pluto were discovered in the region, it was argued that Pluto should be reclassified {{as one of the}} Kuiper belt objects, just as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta lost their planet status after the discovery of many other asteroids. On July 29, 2005, astronomers at Caltech announced the discovery of a new trans-Neptunian object, Eris, which was substantially more massive than Pluto and the most massive object discovered in the Solar System since Triton in 1846. Its discoverers and the press initially called it the tenth planet, <b>although</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> official consensus at the time on whether to call it a planet. Others in the astronomical community considered the discovery the strongest argument for reclassifying Pluto as a minor planet.|$|E

5|$|BSR Housewares {{became the}} club's first shirt sponsor during the 1981–82 season. The club's shirts have been {{sponsored}} {{for the majority}} of the time since then, <b>although</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> shirt sponsor at the end of the 1993–94 season, after local solicitors Coucher & Shaw were closed down by the Law Society of England and Wales. Unusually for a Premier League club, Albion were again without a shirt sponsor for the start of the 2008–09 campaign, as negotiations with a new sponsor were still ongoing when the season began. The longest-running shirt sponsorship deal agreed by the club ran for seven seasons between 1997 and 2004 with the West Bromwich Building Society. Other sponsors have included T-Mobile (2004–08), Homeserve (2010–11), Bodog (2011–12), Zoopla (2012–14), Intuit Quickbooks (2014–15), TLCBET (2015–16) and K8 group (2016–2017).|$|E
5|$|Before the Reformation, the {{extensive}} prohibited degrees of kinship, {{up to the}} fourth degree through consanguinity, meant that most noble marriages necessitated a papal dispensation. This could later be used as grounds for annulment if the marriage proved politically or personally inconvenient, <b>although</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> divorce as such. After the mid-sixteenth century the prohibited degrees were reduced to those in Leviticus 13: 4–13, which limited them to relationships in the second degree of kinship. Separation from bed and board continued to be allowed in exceptional circumstances, usually adultery, and under the Reformed Kirk divorce was allowed on grounds of adultery or desertion. Scotland {{was one of the}} first countries to allow desertion as legal grounds for divorce and, unlike England, where divorce necessitated and act of parliament, divorce cases were initiated relatively far down the social scale.|$|E
5|$|In 1856, Joseph Leidy {{described}} two tyrannosaurid premaxillary teeth from Montana. <b>Although</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> {{indication of}} what the animal looked like, the teeth were large and robust, and Leidy gave them the name Deinodon. Matthew and Brown commented in 1922 that these teeth were indistinguishable from those of Gorgosaurus, but {{in the absence of}} skeletal remains of Deinodon, opted not to unequivocally synonymize the two genera, provisionally naming a ?Deinodon libratus. Although Deinodon teeth are very similar to those of Gorgosaurus, tyrannosaurid teeth are extremely uniform, so it cannot be said for certain which animal they belonged to. Deinodon is usually regarded as a nomen dubium today. Additional likely synonyms of G. libratus and/or D. horridus include Laelaps falculus, Laelaps hazenianus, Laelaps incrassatus, and Dryptosaurus kenabekides.|$|E
