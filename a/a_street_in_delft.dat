25|$|Vermeer's {{mother-in-law}} Maria Thins owned Dirck van Baburen's 1622 oil-on-canvas The Procuress (or {{a copy of}} it), {{which appears}} {{in the background of}} two of Vermeer's paintings. The same subject was also painted by Vermeer. Almost all of Vermeer's paintings are of contemporary subjects in a smaller format, with a cooler palette dominated by blues, yellows, and grays. Practically all of his surviving works belong to this period, usually domestic interiors with one or two figures lit by a window on the left. They are characterized by a sense of compositional balance and spatial order, unified by a pearly light. Mundane domestic or recreational activities are imbued with a poetic timelessness (e.g., Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window, Dresden, Gemäldegalerie). Vermeer's two townscapes have also been attributed to this period: View of Delft (The Hague, Mauritshuis) and <b>A</b> <b>street</b> <b>in</b> <b>Delft</b> (Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum).|$|E
