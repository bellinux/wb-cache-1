5|$|After exhibiting {{in small}} {{galleries}} in Shoreditch, London, the Stuckists' first {{show in a}} major public museum was held in 2004 at the Walker Art Gallery, {{as part of the}} Liverpool Biennial. The group has demonstrated annually at Tate Britain against the Turner Prize since 2000, sometimes dressed in clown costumes. They have <b>also</b> <b>come</b> out in opposition to the Charles Saatchi-patronised Young British Artists.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} 2000 champions, who had <b>also</b> <b>come</b> off a disappointing loss the year before, UConn {{returned}} hungrier {{than ever in}} 2001–02. With the TASS force in their senior season and Taurasi emerging as a star in her sophomore year, UConn rolled through its opponents throughout the year. The only close game the Huskies played all year long was a win at Virginia Tech.|$|E
5|$|Birmingham is a snowy city {{relative}} to other large UK conurbations, due to its inland location and comparatively high elevation. Between 1961 and 1990 Birmingham Airport averaged 13.0 days of snow lying annually, compared to 5.33 at London Heathrow. Snow showers often pass through the city via the Cheshire gap on north westerly airstreams, but can <b>also</b> <b>come</b> off the North Sea from north easterly airstreams.|$|E

5|$|Governments {{and private}} {{enterprises}} have <b>also</b> <b>come</b> {{under pressure from}} China to censor media organizations operated by Falun Gong practitioners. In 2008, for instance, French satellite provider Eutelsat suspended its Asian broadcasts of New Tang Dynasty Television in response to pressure from China's State Administration of Radio, Film and Television. The move {{was viewed as a}} quid pro quo attempt to secure access to the Chinese market.|$|E
5|$|Iyo Railway {{bus service}} runs {{up and down}} the peninsula, to and from Yawatahama, and offers express buses from Misaki to Matsuyama. However, {{commuter}} buses run infrequently and, due to the length of the peninsula and the scattered nature of the town's neighborhoods, bus travel remains more expensive and less convenient than in denser areas. Some tour buses <b>also</b> <b>come</b> across the strait from Kyūshū by ferry.|$|E
5|$|Konnan {{is known}} to be outspoken, and in the last decade, he has been openly {{critical}} of promotions that he feels have mistreated either himself personally or the talent in general. He has been particularly outspoken against what he sees as racism against Latino wrestlers in United States promotions – he butted heads with TNA over treatment of himself and Ron Killings, and WWE over issues regarding Latino wrestlers Alberto Del Rio and Rey Mysterio, but he has <b>also</b> <b>come</b> into conflict with AAA over what he alleged was non-payment of talent.|$|E

5|$|Popular {{recreational}} {{activities in the}} Big Butte Creek watershed include hunting, camping, hiking, and horseback riding. Many tourists <b>also</b> <b>come</b> to sight-see. The most heavily used trail in the area is the Blue Canyon Trail, leading to the Sky Lakes Wilderness, and ultimately the larger Pacific Crest Trail. The city of Butte Falls has organized the Butte Falls Discovery Loop Tour, a half-day-long drive through the Rogue River– Siskiyou National Forest. The loop starts in Butte Falls, and has several stops for hiking and viewing the landscape, including Mount McLoughlin.|$|E
5|$|Resin is {{gathered}} by tapping trees including silver-fir and Aleppo pine; the best resin {{is from the}} terebinth. On Mount Ida in Crete the people gather pitch from Corsican pine and Aleppo pine. Gums such as frankincense, myrrh and balsam of Mecca are gathered either by cutting the plant or naturally. Frankincense and myrrh are gathered into the closely guarded temple of the Sabaeans. Cassia and cinnamon <b>also</b> <b>come</b> from the Arabian peninsula.|$|E
5|$|The {{hippopotamus}} {{is considered}} to be very aggressive and has frequently been reported as charging and attacking boats. Small boats can be capsized by hippos and passengers can be injured or killed by the animals or drown. In one case in Niger, a boat was capsized by a hippo and 13 people were killed. As hippopotamuses will often engage in raiding nearby crops if the opportunity arises, humans may <b>also</b> <b>come</b> in conflict with them on these occasions, with potential for fatalities on both sides.|$|E

5|$|The {{tradition}} of kulintang {{music has been}} waning throughout the Eastern Malay Archipelago, and has become extinct in some places. Sets of five bronze gong-chimes and a gong making up the totobuang ensembles of Buru island in Central Maluku have <b>also</b> <b>come</b> to disuse. Kolintang sets of bossed kettle gongs were once played in Gorontalo, North Sulawesi long ago but that has all but disappeared, replaced by what locals are presently familiar with—a slab-key instrument known as a kolintang.|$|E
5|$|Having {{published}} many novels, {{essays and}} short stories, Narayan {{is credited with}} bringing Indian writing {{to the rest of}} the world. While he has been regarded as one of India's greatest writers of the twentieth century, critics have also described his writings with adjectives such as charming, harmless and benign. Narayan has <b>also</b> <b>come</b> in for criticism from later writers, particularly of Indian origin, who have classed his writings as having a pedestrian style with a shallow vocabulary and a narrow vision. According to Shashi Tharoor, Narayan's subjects are similar to those of Jane Austen as they both deal with a very small section of society. However, he adds that while Austen's prose was able to take those subjects beyond ordinariness, Narayan's was not. A similar opinion is held by Shashi Deshpande who characterizes Narayan's writings as pedestrian and naive because of the simplicity of his language and diction, combined with the lack of any complexity in the emotions and behaviours of his characters.|$|E
5|$|In 1835, aged 14, Paranhos {{was sent}} to the Imperial capital, Rio de Janeiro, to {{continue}} his studies. At the beginning of the following year he was admitted into the Naval Academy. To help support his education, Paranhos tutored his classmates. In 1841, when he was 22, he graduated with the rank of midshipman, enrolling in the Army's Military Academy. He pursued a course in engineering and developed a penchant for mathematics. Prior to graduation from the Army Academy, he was promoted to second lieutenant in the Navy and became a substitute teacher in the Naval Academy. In 1842, he married Teresa de Figueiredo Faria, whose family had <b>also</b> <b>come</b> from Porto in Portugal.|$|E

5|$|Lake Chillisquaque {{is owned}} by Pennsylvania energy company Talen. It was {{constructed}} in 1972 and was originally created {{to serve as a}} supply of cooling water for the Montour Power Plant (a purpose which it still serves), but has <b>also</b> <b>come</b> to be used for recreational purposes. Approximately 200 bird species have been observed on or near the lake and more than 50 species of waterfowl pass by the lake during migration. It is also inhabited by numerous species of fish, some of which are stocked by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. Various trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plants live {{in the vicinity of the}} lake as well. The main recreational activities on or near Lake Chillisquaque include fishing, boating, and hiking. The lake is also surrounded by the Montour Preserve, a nature preserve.|$|E
5|$|Mating {{has rarely}} been {{observed}} in sharks. The smaller catsharks often mate with the male curling around the female. In less flexible species the two sharks swim {{parallel to each other}} while the male inserts a clasper into the female's oviduct. Females in many of the larger species have bite marks that appear to be a result of a male grasping them to maintain position during mating. The bite marks may <b>also</b> <b>come</b> from courtship behavior: the male may bite the female to show his interest. In some species, females have evolved thicker skin to withstand these bites.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft is an American public {{multinational}} corporation headquartered in Redmond, Washington, USA that develops, manufactures, licenses, and supports {{a wide range}} of products and services predominantly related to computing through its various product divisions. Established on April 4, 1975 to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800, Microsoft rose to dominate the home computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems. Microsoft would <b>also</b> <b>come</b> to dominate the office suite market with Microsoft Office. The company has diversified in recent years into the video game industry with the Xbox, the Xbox 360, and the Xbox One, as well as into the consumer electronics and digital services market with Zune, MSN and the Windows Phone OS.|$|E
