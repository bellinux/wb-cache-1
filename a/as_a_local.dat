5|$|Another {{important}} theoretical {{idea that}} {{plays a role}} in M-theory is supersymmetry. This is a mathematical relation that exists in certain physical theories between a class of particles called bosons and a class of particles called fermions. Roughly speaking, fermions are the constituents of matter, while bosons mediate interactions between particles. In theories with supersymmetry, each boson has a counterpart which is a fermion, and vice versa. When supersymmetry is imposed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>local</b> symmetry, one automatically obtains a quantum mechanical theory that includes gravity. Such a theory is called a supergravity theory.|$|E

This did not prevent Amenemhat I and Senusret I (c. 1990–c. 1930 BC) from partially dismantling the mortuary complex of Unas for its materials. In parallel to the official cult, Unas may have received popular veneration <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>local</b> god of the Saqqara necropolis until as late as the Late Period (664–332 BC), nearly 2,000 years after his death.|$|E
