5|$|Black & White {{received}} universal acclaim on release; reviewers {{praised the}} <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence,</b> uniqueness, and depth, although the system requirements and bugs were criticised. Black & White won awards from several organisations, including the British Academy of Film and Television Arts and the Guinness World Record for {{the complexity of}} the <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence,</b> selling over two million copies. Later re-reviews of the game considered it to have been over-rated at the time. An expansion, , and sequel, Black & White 2, followed.|$|E

40|$|Since William Gibson {{includes}} a Rastafarian Enclave and a theological compass in Neuromancer, {{this can be}} used to examine the troublesome natures of the two <b>Artificial</b> <b>Intelligences,</b> Wintermute and Neuromancer. The Rastafarian's beliefs and interpretations of Babylon and Zion, the oppressors and the liberated, add political significance to the Tessier-Ashpool's and their enslaved <b>Artificial</b> <b>Intelligences.</b> Since the <b>Artificial</b> <b>Intelligences</b> are both created of Babylon – the Tessier-Ashpools – and also wanting to be free of them, they are something outside of both. In the <b>Artificial</b> <b>Intelligences,</b> then, Gibson collapses the straightforward dichotomy of Babylon and Zion...|$|R
50|$|Taak's {{hunt for}} the Transform takes him on a dizzying journey, partly through the Dweller {{wormhole}} network itself. In a back story, it is revealed {{that he has been}} out of sympathy with the Mercatoria for some time, particularly over their treatment of <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligences,</b> and has in fact been a Beyonder agent. It is also revealed that the Dwellers have been harbouring <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligences</b> from Mercatoria persecution.|$|R

5|$|The team {{created new}} engines {{to satisfy their}} needs for the game. The <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> was created to {{coordinate}} with players; the addition of Ellie as <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> was {{a major contributor to}} the engine. The lighting engine was also re-created to incorporate soft light, in which the sunlight seeps in through spaces and reflects off surfaces. The gameplay introduced difficulty to the team, as they felt that every mechanic required thorough analysis. The game's user interface design also underwent various iterations throughout development.|$|E

40|$|Cinema {{constantly}} {{shows the}} struggle between the men and <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligences.</b> Fiction, and more specifically fiction films, lends itself to explore possibilities asking “what if?”. “What if”, in this case, {{is related to the}} eventual rebellion of <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligences,</b> theme explored in the movies Tron (1982) and Tron Legacy (2010) trat portray the conflict between programs and users.

5|$|In {{between the}} time Scott {{released}} Alien in 1979 {{and returned to the}} franchise with Prometheus in 2012, he directed another notable science fiction film concerning <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence,</b> Blade Runner, in 1982. Contrary to the white-blooded androids of Alien that emulate emotions and recognize a disconnect with humanity, Blade Runner features the replicants- enhanced biorobotic humanoids that may only be identified by their lacking emotions. In order to maintain control, the replicants' human creators install false memories that detail entire lives that give them a sense of identity. Blade Runner, a largely influential film, has prompted a slew of philosophical questions concerning <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> and whether or not an android could truly be considered alive. The film specifically questions whether thoughts, a sense of identity, emotions and consciousness in general, may be something genuine when applied to <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence.</b> Due to David identifying himself as a living entity - similar to the replicants - film critics in 2012 would come not to only question if Prometheus was a direct prequel to Alien, but if the film had a relation to Blade Runner.|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} for <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligences</b> and robotics in achieving {{the capacity of}} consciousness, sentience and rationality offers the prospect that these agents have minds. If so, then {{there may be a}} {{potential for}} these minds to become dysfunctional, or for <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligences</b> and robots to suffer from mental illness. The existence of artificially intelligent psychopathology can be interpreted through the philosophical perspectives of mental illness. This offers new insights into what it means to have either robot or human mental disorders, but may also offer a platform on which to examine the mechanisms of biological or artificially intelligent psychiatric disease. The possibility of mental illnesses occurring in artificially intelligent individuals necessitates the consideration that at some level, they may have achieved a mental capability of consciousness, sentience and rationality such that they can subsequently become dysfunctional. The deeper philosophical understanding of these conditions in mankind and <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligences</b> might therefore offer reciprocal insights into mental health and mechanisms that may lead to the prevention of mental dysfunction...|$|R

40|$|Currently many game <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligences</b> {{attempt to}} {{determine}} their next moves by using a simulator to predict the effect of actions in the world. However, writing such a simulator is time-consuming, and the simulator must be changed substantially whenever a detail in the game design is modified. As such, this research project set out {{to determine if a}} version of the first order inductive learning algorithm could be used to learn rules that could then be used in place of a simulator. By eliminating the need to write a simulator for each game by hand, the entire Darmok 2 project could more easily adapt to additional real-time strategy games. Over time, Darmok 2 would also be able to provide better competition for human players by training the <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligences</b> to play against the style of a specific player. Most importantly, Darmok 2 might also be able to create a general solution for creating game <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligences,</b> which could save game development companies a substantial amount of money, time, and effort.
