5|$|FBI {{special agent}} Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) goes to {{investigate}} the murder. The victim, a twenty-two-year-old backpacker, now shows signs of body decay usually associated with old age. Later, at a pay-phone, she asks her partner, John Doggett (Robert Patrick), to check the X-Files for cases mentioning glycoproteins. While discussing the case with Doggett, the bus passes her, and she follows it to a gas station {{in the middle of}} the desert. <b>A</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> injured hand learns that she is a medical doctor and fills her car with gasoline laced with water. Scully returns to the gas station and is told that rain got into the gas canisters.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the {{investigations}} of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, Doggett, Reyes, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Scully stumble on to a bizarre murder case where the main suspect is <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> unusual obsession for The Brady Bunch. Despite their initial differences—both in investigative style and love of The Brady Bunch—the four of them soon learn that the man's telekinetic ability is the ultimate, undeniable proof of an X-File.|$|E
5|$|Andersen went to sea at age 15, {{and later}} found {{work as a}} mason's assistant. On 7November 1916 he married Lovise Kristine Klausen, {{who worked as a}} {{waitress}} at a restaurant frequented by Andersen. They soon got an apartment at Torshov and had a son. Andersen got a better-paid job, laying the foundation for the headquarters of Oslo Lysverker, but when that job was done he had to seek day-to-day work at the harbour. After an upturn during the First World War, Norway's financial situation again turned for the worse, no-one would hire <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> institutional background, and he was out of work. He made a last-ditch attempt to make money, buying liquor in Tønsberg and selling it on the black market in Kristiania, but this was not enough for his wife, who left him to pursue a more financially secure future.|$|E

5|$|The IRA {{immediately}} began {{making plans to}} break Twomey, O'Hagan and Mallon out of the prison. The first attempt involved explosives that had been smuggled into the prison, which were {{to be used to}} blow a hole in a door which would give the prisoners access to the exercise yard. From there, they would scale a rope ladder thrown over the exterior wall by members of the IRA's Dublin Brigade who would have a getaway car waiting to complete the escape. The plan failed when the prisoners could not gain access to the exercise yard and the rope ladder was spotted, so the IRA began making new escape plans. The idea of using a helicopter in an escape had been discussed before, an idea to break Gerry Adams out of Long Kesh internment camp had been ruled out because of faster and more sophisticated British Army helicopters being stationed at a nearby base. The IRA's GHQ staff approved the plan to break out Twomey, O'Hagan and Mallon, and arrangements were made to obtain a helicopter. <b>A</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> American accent calling himself Mr. Leonard approached the manager of Irish Helicopters at Dublin Airport, with a view to hiring a helicopter for an aerial photographic shoot in County Laois. After being shown the company's fleet of helicopters, Leonard arranged to hire a five-seater Alouette II for 31 October.|$|E

25|$|Six {{men have}} been arrested for varying degrees of {{involvement}} in the crime. However, only three of the six men arrested have been prosecuted. Most of the arrests were {{made on the basis of}} a confession by <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> intellectual disability named John Dylan Adams, who told police he saw his brother, Zach, and another friend, Jason Autry, with Holly at his brother's home after her kidnapping. It is unknown what led police to question Dylan about Bobo's disappearance. Three men, Dylan Adams, Zach Adams, and Jason Autry were charged with especially aggravated kidnapping, first-degree murder and rape. Of the other three men arrested, charges against two men were dropped, and one committed suicide without any charges being filed against him.|$|E
25|$|Scenes {{from the}} Odyssey are common on Greek pottery, the Circe episode among them. The two most common {{representations}} have Circe {{surrounded by the}} transformed sailors and Odysseus threatening the sorceress with his sword. In {{the case of the}} former, the animals are not always boars but also include, for instance, the ram, dog and lion on the 6th century BCE Boston kylix. Often the transformation is only partial, involving the head and perhaps a sprouting tail, {{while the rest of the}} body is human. In describing an otherwise obscure fifth-century Greek bronze in the Walters Art Museum that takes the form of a man on all fours with the foreparts of a pig, the commentator asks in what other way could an artist depict someone bewitched other than as <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> animal head. In these scenes Circe is shown almost invariably stirring the potion with her wand, although the incident as described in Homer has her use the wand only to bewitch the sailors after they have refreshed themselves. One exception is the Berlin amphora on which the seated Circe holds the wand towards a half transformed man.|$|E

A memorandum from the Office of Protocol (OP) of the State Department gave its personnel {{detailed information on}} ceremonial intricacies, such as the correct pronunciation of Diệm's name.

500|$|... "The Simpsons Guy" [...] {{attracted}} controversy {{before it}} had aired. Tim Winter, the President of the Parents Television Council, a socially conservative media monitoring organization and longtime critic of Family Guy, wrote to Matt Groening, Seth MacFarlane and Fox about a joke seen in the trailer for the episode. In it, after Bart's prank call to Moe asking for <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> innuendo name, Stewie makes his own call and tells Moe that his sister is being raped. Winter felt that jokes about rape make it [...] "less outrageous in real life", and that people who watch The Simpsons but not Family Guy would be unfamiliar with the latter show's brand of humor. A Fox spokeswoman {{declined to comment on}} the joke, while MacFarlane, interviewed by Entertainment Weekly, said that although he would be attacked for stating it as such, the joke was [...] "pretty funny... in context". A spokeswoman from the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network said [...] "I think the show is making it clear that rape is not funny by how they are positioning the joke." ...|$|E
500|$|On August 21, 2015, Stone and his {{childhood}} friends Alek Skarlatos and Anthony Sadler, were traveling together during a sightseeing vacation in Europe when they boarded Thalys train 9364 from Amsterdam bound to Paris via Brussel.

A 25-year-old Moroccan man, {{believed to be}} Ayoub El-Khazzani, was in train car No. 12, armed with an AKM assault rifle and equipped with 270 rounds of ammunition.

Skarlatos stated that [...] "I was thinking about survival," [...] and [...] "t was to survive and for everybody else on the train to make it." [...] Stone was transferred to the central hospital in Lille, France and went under treatment in Germany, returning home September 3, 2015.|$|E

Natasha questions Randal about her father's death, but they are discovered by an eavesdropping Van Cleef. Fouchon and Van Cleef beat Randal to punish him for sending them <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> interested family. New Orleans police detective Marie Mitchell (Kasi Lemmons) is reluctant to investigate Binder's disappearance until his charred body is discovered in the ashes of a derelict building. The death is ruled accidental, but Chance searches the ruins and finds Binder's dog tag, which was pierced {{by one of the}} crossbow bolts. Van Cleef's henchmen suddenly ambush Chance and beat the recon unconscious to scare him and Natasha out of town. When he recovers, he offers Mitchell the dog tag as evidence that Binder was murdered. With the investigation getting closer, Van Cleef and Fouchon decide to relocate their hunting business and begin eliminating [...] "loose ends". The medical examiner who had been hiding evidence of the hunt is executed along with Randal. Mitchell, Natasha and Chance arrive moments later at Randal's office and are ambushed by Van Cleef and several of his men. During the shootout Mitchell is shot in the chest and killed. Chance kills a handful of the mercenaries and escapes with Natasha. Fouchon and Van Cleef assemble their mercenary team and five paid-for hunters to continue the chase.|$|E
