A prototype perforated backplane <b>air</b> <b>baffle</b> for a laboratory safety hood was designed, fabricated and its performance was evaluated experimentally. Relative to the historically poor performance of slot baffle design, the perforated metal created better laminar flow through the hood, and decreased turbulence in the form of vortices, ultimately resulting in better hood containment. New performance monitoring techniques were developed to aid in future testing of improved laboratory fume hood designs. Three methods were employed to evaluate the hood's performance: 1) face velocity testing, 2) tracer gas containment testing, and 3) smoke containment. Face velocity data was analyzed to evaluate turbulence and consistency across the hood face with the use of new statistical methods described in this thesis. It was determined that turbulence decreased and velocity uniformity increased as the average face velocity increased and as the open area of the hood face decreased. Tracer gas levels outside of the hood, in the operator's breathing zone, were kept below detectable levels (0. 02 ppm) at all face velocity / sash position settings. In this work, a Hood Protection Factor was developed as a quantitative means to compare hood performance. The Hood Protection Factor is a true ratio of the contaminant concentration inside the hood exhaust duct to that in the operator's breathing zone, as both are measured values. A qualitative assessment of the hood's performance was completed by means of smoke testing. Smoke testing showed that smoke was captured / retained without escaping from the hood at all face velocity / sash position settings. Static pressure measurements were taken at the back panel of the hood. Graphical analysis of this data allowed visualization of the uniformity of suction across the perforated <b>air</b> <b>baffle.</b> The prototype backplane <b>air</b> <b>baffle</b> provided reduced turbulence at the hood face, allowing improved containment efficiency. New performance monitoring techniques and statistical evaluation methods were developed so health and safety professionals may better evaluate and design laboratory fume hoods...|$|E
40|$|The article aims {{to verify}} the {{accuracy}} of a method to simulate the combustion chamber with a low-pressure prototype burner equipped with a specific “mixing element” and <b>air</b> <b>baffle.</b> The burner has an output of 4 kW and combusts methane. In detail, the article evaluates {{the accuracy of the}} final courses of temperatures and CO concentrations in the combustion chamber, which were obtained having combined the mathematical models k-ε, Eddy Dissipation and Discrete Transfer. CFD software CFX was used for the solution and visualisation of the results. The verification measurements imply that the final course of temperature plotted on the vertical axis of the combustion chamber differs from the real course by + 21. 7 % on average. The predicted CO concentrations are relatively satisfactory in the chamber locations with lower temperatures – at the combustion chamber outlet the deviation from the measured value was + 31. 8 %. Overall, the applied method may be considered acceptable to simulate the thermal field in a combustion chamber with the described burner...|$|E

40|$|For the {{prediction}} of convective heat loss from solar concentrating receiver cavities a number of empirical correlations exist. Geometry and the inclination angle determine {{the degree to which}} natural convection can infiltrate the cavity and remove stably stratified hot air out through the aperture.

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{influence}} of pyrite and sand particles on oxygen transfer in a three phase system under turbulent conditions is investigated. The configuration used is an <b>air</b> sparged <b>baffled</b> tank 0. 44 m in diameter, agitated with either a six-blade Rushton turbine or an A 315 Lightnin axial flow impeller. The tests were carried out with particles of about 15 |am at volume fractions up to 15 %. The oxygen transfer coefficient kL^ was determined {{with the use of}} the dynamic measuring method. Also the gas hold up was measured and a method was investigated to measure the bubble sizes in the slurries with the use of a capillary. The suspended sand particles decrease the oxygen transfer rate k^a, down to 60 % of the value in water at a 15 % solids volume fraction. The pyrite particles, however, increase kL^ up to 200 % of the value in water at a solids fraction of 12. 7 %. The gas hold up hardly changes in the case of pyrite particles while it decreases with increasing sand fraction. In addition, bubble measurements show a decrease in bubble diameter with increasing solids fraction for both solids. From the hold up and the bubble sizes the specific interfacial area a through which the mass transfer takes place is determined. From the values for kip. and a the effect of the solids on the liquid-side mass transfer kj^is detennined. The results show that with the sand slurry, the decreasing kifl value is due to a decreasing mass transfer coefficient kL at a rather constant interfacial area a.

40|$|The mock-up {{of a great}} passive {{silencer}} {{used for}} noise attenuation in industrial applications has been designed and tested in laboratory. This mock-up consists of three metal casing containing the noise source and several removable rails and supports, allowing the test of different configurations of parallel absorbing baffles. The output of the silencer radiates in an anechoic chamber in order to simulate free-field conditions. The acoustic attenuation has been measured {{not only at the}} output, but also inside the silencer, with a mobile microphone located at several positions along the axis. Also, the tested configurations include three types of absorbing pillows and several geometrical arrangements. The results show that the maximum insertion loss (dB) measured at the output of the silencer corresponds to frequencies between 800 Hz and 2. 5 kHz and its value strongly depends on the <b>air</b> gaps between <b>baffles.</b> The measurements with the mobile microphone show a linear decrease of the sound pressure level with the distance along the axis (mainly between 100 Hz and 1 kHz), which corresponds to the depth of absorbing material involved in the attenuation.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, {{the effects of}} the {{indirect}} evaporative cooler with internal baffle on the performance of the hybrid air conditioning system are numerically investigated. The hybrid air conditioning system contains two indirect evaporative coolers with internal baffle, one is utilized to pre-cool the air inlet to the desiccant wheel and the other is utilized to pre-cool the supply air inlet to the room. The effects of the inlet conditions of the process and reactivation air and working air ratio on the thermal performance of the hybrid air conditioning system have been analyzed. The results of this study show that in the hybrid air conditioning system for using the indirect evaporative cooler with internal baffle as a pre-cooling unit, the supply air temperature reduced by 21 % and the coefficient of performance improved by 71 % as compared to previous designs of the hybrid air conditioning system at the same inlet conditions. For increasing process air inlet temperature from 25  °C to 45  °C, supply air temperature increases from 12. 7  °C to 14. 2  °C, thermal COP increases from 1. 87 to 2. 84, and supply air relative humidity increases from 76. 7 % to 77. 4 %. Also, for increasing the reactivation air inlet temperature from 70  °C to 110  °C, supply air temperature dropped from 15. 9  °C to 10. 9  °C, supply air relative humidity dropped from 82. 7 % to 71. 8 %, and thermal COP dropped from 4. 5 to 1. 7. The recommended optimal air working ratio in the indirect evaporative cooler with internal baffle should be 0. 15.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Fugitive {{emissions}} {{arising from}} the handling of particulate materials have occurred since these materials were first handled. As the volume of materials handled has increased so has the volume of fugitive materials; the fraction of the fugitive material focused on in this thesis, we generally call dust. In modern operations, dust represents a lost income stream, as the dust is often saleable product; increased cost of operations due to cleaning costs; a public nuisance for those working and living adjacent to material-handling operations; an explosion risk with some dust types; an environmental pollutant, and significantly a multitude of health risks due to slips, trips and inhalation of dust (Hamelmann & Schmidt). Government regulation through various environmental pollution agencies is continually reducing the so-termed acceptable limits for dust emissions associated with different operations and in different environments. As these limits reduce, a greater level of operational care and often cost is required by the operators to comply. Active dust control is often seen as an easy method to reduce emissions. In the simplest form, an air mover is used to pull dust laden air away from the process in question, before air separation and returning the fine product back to the process line. Active measures clearly carry an energy penalty to operate the air movers, but also have high costs associated with duct and pipe wear, air-mover filtration system maintenance and reliability issues. Further, there are many areas where active dust control is impractical. Passive dust control in contrast, through {{an understanding of the}} mechanics of dust generation, aims to reduce the total emissions through a range of mechanisms, without external energy input. This can be achieved for example by embedding the smaller particles fractions deeper within a flowing stream (Wheeler, Krull, Roberts, & Wiche, 2007), or careful positioning of baffles and stilling zones in equipment. Unfortunately with passive control systems, there is a much greater need to ‘understand the system’ before an appropriate passive solution can be implemented. This is unlike a high-cost active system where a simple up-scaling of equipment can often overcome a poor understanding of the system. This thesis presents a volume of work expanding the overall understanding of the underlying mechanics required for passive dust control, particularly related to transient events such as dump hoppers. Air entrained into a falling stream of bulk material under the influence of gravity is known as the main source of dust generation (R. Ansart, A. d. Ryck, & J. A. Dodds, 2009 b). For calculating the amount of entrained air, several researches and formulas have been published. However, the accuracy of different formulas varies under different conditions. To understand the impact of different parameters on the behaviour of a material stream, this research was undertaken in a particular sequence, to enable detailed analysis in a controlled manner. In general, free falling largely contributes to the discrete bulkmaterial-handling case activities. Therefore, research was initiated on free-falling streams to better identify the impact of key influencing variables. This research provided an insight into the free-falling and influencing parameters such as particle diameter, particle solid density, stream diameter and drop height. Resulting from these investigations, a new approach to calculate the magnitude of air entrained into the free-falling stream of particles (AVCF - Air-Entrainment using Volume Conservation Theory in Free-Falling) has been developed (Esmaili, Donohue, Wheeler, McBride, & Roberts, 2013). Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation was successfully applied to different free-falling conditions. These simulations were then verified with Particle Imaging Velocimetry (PIV), high-speed videos and particle-tracking techniques. A close correlation between the provided theory (AVCF), CFD and experimental data was observed. The knowledge obtained from the analysis of free falling was extended to transient bulkmaterial-handling cases. Dump hoppers are known to be one the major dust generation sources within the mining industry (Cecala, 2010), and was selected to extend the work completed on free falling air entrainment research. Scale model tests were conducted to provide air velocity readings, airflow patterns and high-quality footage for simulation verification purposes. The two-phase CFD simulation method is considered as a compromise solution, optimising accuracy, time consumption and ease-of-use considerations. The potential to further improve performance in the scale model tests were investigated using these CFD method. The influences of the drop height, particle size, particle density and the design of the dump hopper geometry, in relation to the air-flow pattern within the enclosure, and subsequently reducing dust emissions are discussed. Moreover, the effects of ‘air cells’, ‘curtains’, ‘baffles’ and introduced new technique (additional section) are investigated. The results reveal that the flow pattern of the air within the dump hopper geometry can be improved and the flow slowed down if <b>air</b> cells, <b>baffles,</b> curtains or any other technique is utilised appropriately. In addition to the above, the introduced theory work for the air-entrainment-magnitude calculation concept has been expanded to dump hoppers by utilising particle trajectory analysis. It has been concluded that this formula provides a close correlation to simulation...|$|R
5000|$|Clark {{describes}} the race {{between the two}} leaders, Flying Fish and John Gilpin, as follows:The fleet was so large in 1853 {{that it was not}} uncommon for two or three ships to be in company at sea, each striving to outsail the others. As we have seen, the Flying Fish won the race this year, and from one of the finest fleets of clippers that ever sailed from New York. The match between her and the John Gilpin was exceedingly close, and taken altogether {{was one of the best}} ever sailed upon this famous ocean course, the Derby of the sea. It was Samuel Hall against Donald McKay, Justin Doane against Edward Nickels, and all against the fleet.The John Gilpin sailed out past Sandy Hook, October 29, 1852, followed by the Flying Fish on November 1st, and before the green Highlands of Neversink had disappeared below the horizon both ships were under a cloud of canvas. The Flying Fish fanned along through the doldrums and crossed the equator 21 days from Sandy Hook, leading the John Gilpin by one day. From the line to 50° S., the John Gilpin made the run in 23 days, passing the Flying Fish and getting a clear lead of two days. The Flying Fish did some fine sailing here; dashing through the Straits of Le Maire, she came up alongside the John Gilpin just off the Horn, and Nickels, ever famous for his jovial good cheer, invited Doane to come aboard and dine with him, [...] " [...] which invitation," [...] the John Gilpins log-book ruefully records, [...] " [...] I was reluctantly obliged to decline." [...] This is perhaps the only instance of an invitation to dine out being received off Cape Horn. Few men have had the opportunity to extend such unique hospitality and certainly none could do so more heartily and gracefully than the famous commander of the Flying Fish. His vessel made the run from 50° S. in the Atlantic to 50° S. in the Pacific in 7 days, leading her rival by two days. From this point to the equator, the Flying Fish was 19 and the John Gilpin 20 days. From here the John Gilpin showed remarkable speed, making the run to San Francisco in 15 days, a total of 93 days, closely followed by the Flying Fish, 92 days from Sandy Hook. Their abstract logs are as follows:Sandy Hook to the equator: Flying Fish 21 days, John Gilpin 24 daysEquator to 50° S: Flying Fish 27 days, John Gilpin 23 days50° in the Atlantic to 50° S. in Pacific: Flying Fish 7 days, John Gilpin 11 daysTo the equator: Flying Fish 19 days, John Gilpin 20 daysEquator to San Francisco: Flying Fish 18 days, John Gilpin 15 daysTotal: Flying Fish 92 days, John Gilpin 93 daysWhen we reflect that this match was sailed over a course of some 15,000 miles, and that the difference of time was only twenty-four hours, one is impressed with the perfection to which the models of the vessels had been brought, as well as the exactness of the data relating to the winds and currents that had been gathered and reduced to a system by Maury, and with the skill of their captains, who were guided by his charts and sailing directions. The average difference of sailing between these two ships was less than six seconds per mile over the entire distance. Few races over thirty-mile courses have been sailed by yachts more evenly matched.Another contemporary account {{describes the}} strategies of the other two vessels in the race, the clippers Wild Pigeon and Trade Wind, and the impact of using Maurys Wind and Current Charts and Sailing Directions, which shortened the voyage between New York and California by 35 days, on average.All sailed from New York in the autumn of 1852. The Wild Pigeon, October 12th, the John Gilpin, October 29th, the Flying Fish, November 1st, and the Trade Wind, November 14th. It was the season for the best passages. Each one was provided with Maury’s Wind and Current Charts. Each one had evidently studied them attentively; and each one was resolved to make the most of them and do his best. All ran against time; but the John Gilpin and the Flying Fish for the whole course, and the Wild Pigeon for part of it, ran neck and neck, the one against the other, and each against all. It was a sweepstakes with these ships, around Cape Horn and through both hemispheres.Evidently the Fish was most confident that she had the heels of her competitors—she felt her strength and rejoiced in it; she was most anxious for a quick run, and eager withal for a trial. She dashed down southwardly from Sandy Hook, looking occasionally at the charts; but feeling proud in her sweep of wing, and trusting confidently in the judgment of her master, she kept, on the average, 200 miles to leeward of the right track. Rejoicing in her many noble and fine qualities, she crowded on her canvas to its utmost stretch, trusting quite as much to her heels as to the charts, and performed the extraordinary feat of crossing, the sixteenth day out from New York, the parallel of 5 degrees north.The next day she was well south of 4 degrees north, and in the doldrums, longitude 34 degrees west.Now her heels became paralyzed, her fortune seems to have deserted her awhile —at least her master, as the winds failed him, feared so; they gave him his motive power—they were fickle, and he was helplessly baffled by them. The bugbear of a northwest current off Cape St. Roque began to loom up in his imagination, and to look alarming; then the dread of falling to leeward came upon him. Chances and luck seemed to conspire against him, and the mere possibility of finding his ship backstrapped filled the mind of Nickels with evil forebodings, and shook his faith in his guide. He doubted the charts, and committed the mistake of the passage.The Sailing Directions had cautioned the navigator again and again not to attempt to fan along to the eastward in the equatorial doldrums; for by so doing he would himself engage in a fruitless strife with <b>baffling</b> <b>airs,</b> sometimes reinforced in their weakness by westerly currents. But the winds had failed; and so, too, the smart captain of the Flying Fish evidently thought had the Sailing Directions. The Sailing Directions advise the navigator to cross the calm belt in as straight a line as the winds will allow, not fearing the land about Cape St. Roque, or the current that is supposed to sweep round it.Nickels, forgetting that the charts are founded on the experience of great numbers, being tempted, turned a deaf ear to the caution, and flung away three whole days and more of most precious time dallying in the doldrums. He spent two days about the parallel of 3 degrees north, and his ship left the doldrums, after this waste of time, nearly upon the same meridian at which she entered them.She was still in 34 degrees, the current keeping her back just as fast as she could fan east. After so great a loss, her very clever master became sensible of his error. Leaving the spell-bound calms behind him where he had undergone such great trials, he wrote in his log as follows: [...] " [...] I now regret that, after making so fine a run to 5 degrees north, I did not dash on and work my way to windward to the northward of St. Roque, as I have experienced little or no westerly set since passing the equator, whilst three or four days have been lost in working to the eastward between the parallels of 5 and 3 degrees north against a strong westerly set"—and, he might have added, with little or no wind.In three days after this he was clear of St. Roque. Just five days before him, the Hazard had passed exactly in the same place, and gained two days on tho Fish by cutting straight across the doldrums, as the Sailing Directions advised him to do.The Wild Pigeon arrived first off Cape Horn; but here she met with a westerly gale which detained her ten days, while her competitors, the Fish and the Gilpin, were coming up fast with fine winds and flowing sheets. The three swung round tho Horn together, as if entering on the quarter stretch.On the 30th of December, the three ships crossed the parallel of 35 degrees south, (in the Pacific), tho first recognizing the Pigeon the Pigeon saw only [...] "a clipper ship"— for she could not conceive how the ship in sight could possibly be the Flying Fish, as that vessel was not to leave New York for some three weeks after she did. The Gilpin was only 30 or 40 miles off at the same time.Tho race was now wing and wing, and had become exciting. With fair winds and an open sea, the competitors had now a clear stretch to the equator of 2,500 miles before them.The Flying Fish led the way, the Wild Pigeon pressing her hard, and both dropping the Gilpin quite rapidly, who was edging off to the westward.The two foremost reached the equator on the 13th of January, the Fish leading just 25 miles in latitude, and crossing in 112 deg. 17 min., the Pigeon 40 miles further to the east.The Gilpin crossed the equator two days afterwards in 116 degrees, and made the glorious run of 15 days thence to the Pilot Grounds off San Francisco.The Flying Fish beat. She made the passage in 92 days and 4 hours from port to anchor. The Gilpin in 93 days and 20 hours from port to pilot. The Wild Pigeon had 118. The Trade Wind followed with 102 days, having taken fire and burned for eight hours on the way.The result of this race may be taken as an illustration as to how well navigators are now brought to understand the winds and currents of the sea.Here are three ships, sailing on different days, bound over a trackless waste of ocean for some 15,000 miles or more, and depending alone on the fickle winds of heaven ... yet, like travelers on the land bound upon the same journey, they pass and repass, fall in with and recognize each other by the way; and what perhaps is still more remarkable is the fact that these ships should each, throughout that great distance, and under the wonderful vicissitudes of climates, winds, and currents which they encountered, have been so skillfully navigated that ... I do not find a single occasion on which they could have been better handled, except in the single instance of the Flying Fish while crossing the doldrums in the Atlantic. And this mistake her own master was prompt to discover and quick to correct.|$|R
