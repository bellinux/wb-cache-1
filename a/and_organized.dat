To be able to learn English well, a learner should master English skills and components. Vocabulary is also taken into account as underlying basic for learning English skills and other English component, namely pronunciation and grammar. Therefore, teaching vocabulary effectively needed to be considered, and one of the ways in teaching vocabulary is using strategy such as grouping <b>and</b> <b>organizing</b> vocabulary. Accordingly, the researcher uses grouping <b>and</b> <b>organizing</b> vocabulary as strategy to teach vocabulary which is intended to improve the student’s vocabulary achievement. The formulation of the research problems are: 1) How is the student’s vocabulary achievement taught before using grouping <b>and</b> <b>organizing</b> vocabulary? 2) How is the student’s vocabulary achievement taught after using grouping <b>and</b> <b>organizing</b> vocabulary? 3) Are there any significant different scores taught before and after using grouping <b>and</b> <b>organizing</b> vocabulary? The objectives of this study are: 1) To know the student’s vocabulary achievement taught before using grouping <b>and</b> <b>organizing</b> vocabulary, 2) To know the student’s vocabulary achievement taught after using grouping <b>and</b> <b>organizing</b> vocabulary, 3) To know whether there are any significant different scores taught before and after using grouping <b>and</b> <b>organizing</b> vocabulary.

40|$|Currently, {{rhetoric is}} {{considered}} a negative term. This dissertation uses rhetoric as a normative term serving simultaneously as both the central story line and storyteller. Rhetoric is both the object of study and the lens through which to study. A field {{study was conducted with}} the Roanoke County administration. The rhetorical patterns of administrative leaders were observed and documented in their day-to-day activities. Rhetoric is the conceptual glue both highlighting and pulling together different layers of understanding. At the level of theory development and application, this includes building conceptual linkages between leading <b>and</b> <b>organizing.</b> In practice, public administrators know that leading <b>and</b> <b>organizing</b> occur as an integrated whole. Methodologically, a new technique to study the rhetoric of leading <b>and</b> <b>organizing</b> is introduced within the Roanoke County field study. At a normative level, the linkages discovered in the rhetorical discourse of leading <b>and</b> <b>organizing</b> reveal a greater understanding of democratic governance. The field study provides insights into leading <b>and</b> <b>organizing</b> that are also constitutive of a normative position regarding democratic governance. DEDICATIO...|$|R
