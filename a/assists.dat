40|$|ObjectiveIt is {{generally}} accepted that patients who require biventricular <b>assist</b> device support have poorer outcomes than those requiring isolated left ventricular <b>assist</b> device support. However, {{it is unknown}} how the timing of biventricular <b>assist</b> device insertion affects outcomes. We hypothesized that planned biventricular <b>assist</b> device insertion improves survival compared with delayed conversion of left ventricular <b>assist</b> device support to biventricular <b>assist</b> device support. MethodsWe reviewed and compared outcomes of 266 patients undergoing left ventricular <b>assist</b> device or biventricular <b>assist</b> device placement at the University of Pennsylvania from April 1995 to June 2007. We subdivided patients receiving biventricular <b>assist</b> devices into planned biventricular <b>assist</b> device (P-BiVAD) and delayed biventricular <b>assist</b> device (D-BiVAD) groups based on the timing of right ventricular <b>assist</b> device insertion. We defined the D-BiVAD group as any failure of isolated left ventricular <b>assist</b> device support. ResultsOf 266 patients who receivd left ventricular <b>assist</b> devices, 99 (37 %) required biventricular <b>assist</b> device support. We compared preoperative characteristics, successful bridging to transplantation, survival to hospital discharge, and Kaplan–Meier 1 -year survival between the P-BiVAD (n = 71) and D-BiVAD (n = 28) groups. Preoperative comparison showed that patients who ultimately require biventricular support have similar preoperative status. Left ventricular <b>assist</b> device (n = 167) outcomes in all categories exceeded both P-BiVAD and D-BiVAD group outcomes. Furthermore, patients in the P-BiVAD group had superior survival to discharge than patients in the D-BiVAD group (51 % vs 29 %, P <. 05). One-year and long-term Kaplan–Meier survival distribution confirmed this finding. There was also a trend toward improved bridging to transplantation in the P-BiVAD (n = 55) versus D-BiVAD (n = 22) groups (65 % vs 45 %, P =. 10). ConclusionWhen patients {{at high risk for}} failure of isolated left ventricular <b>assist</b> device support are identified, proceeding directly to biventricular <b>assist</b> device implantation is advised because early institution of biventricular support results in dramatic improvement in survival...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Assisted</b> {{hatching}} {{can improve}} the implantation rate in cycles with poor outcome. The impact of <b>assisted</b> hatching in embryos from women with endometriosis is not known. Therefore, {{the hypothesis that the}} implantation potential of embryos obtained from women with endometriosis can be improved with <b>assisted</b> hatch-ing was tested. METHODS: In a prospective randomized study, transfer embryos obtained from 60 women with endometriosis were hatched using a laser system and compared to embryos obtained from patients with the same diagnosis which were left intact (n 5 30). RESULTS: The characteristics of cycles were similar between groups. The pregnancy (40 % zona intact, 28. 3 % <b>assisted</b> hatching), and implantation rates (19. 4 % zona intact, 17. 8 % <b>assisted</b> hatching) did not differ in endometriosis cycles regardless of <b>assisted</b> hatching.
