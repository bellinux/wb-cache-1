40|$|AbstractThe {{application}} of minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) in grinding {{has emerged as}} an alternative for reducing the abundant flow of cutting fluids, thus achieving cleaner production. Although considered an innovative technique in grinding operations, its widespread application is hindered due primarily to the high heat generation and wheel pore clogging caused by machined chips, harming the final product quality and increasing tool wear on the machine. This study sought to improve MQL use in grinding. In addition to the conventional MQL injected at the wheel/workpiece interface, a compressed <b>air</b> <b>jet</b> was used to clean the mixture of MQL oil and machined chips from clogged wheel pores. Experiments were conducted using external cylindrical plunge grinding on AISI 4340 quenched and tempered steel, and a vitrified cubic boron nitrite (CBN) wheel. The cooling-lubrication methods employed were the conventional flood coolant application, MQL (without cleaning), and MQL with a cleaning jet directed at the wheel surface at different angles of incidence. The main goal of these experiments was to verify the viability of replacing the traditional abundant flow of cutting fluid with MQL and wheel cleaning. The analyses were conducted by measuring the following output variables of the process: workpiece surface roughness and roundness errors, diametrical wheel wear, acoustic emission generated by the process, and metallographic images of the ground surface and subsurface. Results show {{the positive effects of}} implementing the cleaning jet technique as a technological improvement of minimum quantity lubrication in grinding {{in order to reduce the}} usage of cutting fluids.

The materials tested were six materials whose major constituent was silicon carbide, five cermets whose major constituent was titanium carbide, six materials whose major constituents were metal borides, four cermets containing alumina, and one silicon nitride model. Tests consisted of obtaining weight change and appearance changes for 1 / 2 -inch-diameter hemispherical-nose cylindrical models exposed to the <b>air</b> <b>jet</b> <b>for</b> 30 seconds at a time {{for a total of}} four runs or 2 minutes exposure.

40|$|International audienceThere is {{presently}} very little information available concerning long term operation with group B oxygen carriers for the Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC) process. It is therefore {{difficult to predict}} the attrition at industrial scale based on existing tools and methodologies for the different oxygen carriers available. The CLC process is similar in its configuration to the Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) process with particles circulating in a loop between different reactors. Therefore for the CLC process development perspectives, {{it is interesting to}} compare the different oxygen carriers with a FCC catalyst of which data at industrial scale are available. A method to compare the mechanical resistance to attrition of solids from different fluidization groups was developed in this work. In order to deal with small amount s of particle samples, experiments are conducted using lab scale testing with a Jet Cup rig. Two solids of interest were considered in this study, a Group B oxygen carrier with a density of 3600 kg/m 3 and a mean particle diameter (dp 50) of 180 microns, and a group A FCC equilibrium catalyst with a particle density of 1450 kg/m 3 and a mean particle diameter (dp 50) of 70 microns. First, we defined a new attrition index that does not depend upon a given particle size. This index is based on the total percentage of particles generated by attrition and it is called TPGI (Total Particles Generated Index). This index also gives the possibility to estimate the maximum diameter of particles generated by attrition. It was found that attrition in the jet cup is proportional to the contact frequency between the <b>air</b> <b>jet</b> and the particles. Therefore it is necessary to estimate the particles circulation within the <b>air</b> <b>jet</b> <b>for</b> each solid tested in order to make sure that particles go through the same mechanical stress. For this purpose, a CFD study using Barracuda™ was carried out on the two solids of interest. CFD results showed that in order to have the same circulation of particles in the <b>air</b> <b>jet,</b> therefore the same mechanical stress, tests should be carried out with the same initial volume of particles. It is important to notice that this conclusion is valid for the two solids of interest, another CFD study should be done for solids with different properties. Finally, the particles mechanical resistance is characterized by the TPGPI increase rate with respect to the test duration. This parameter is then be used to compare the solids tested, the oxygen carrier being more resistant than the FCC catalyst in this study case...|$|R

The deflection angle a is determined with an average standard deviation of 10. 6 degrees. The results of the image processing algorithm are in agreement with the criterion of the corrected Archimedes number. (C) 2000 Silsoe Research Institute. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|To provide {{necessary}} {{plant protection}} in orchards, spray drops are transported to {{and into the}} apple tree canopy with an <b>air</b> <b>jet</b> from a fan sprayer. The interaction between the spray <b>air</b> <b>jet</b> and the canopy is central to effective droplet transport, spray coverage and pest control. Converging <b>air</b> <b>jets</b> were introduced {{as a way of}} improving the spray application. In this study, a two unit cross-flow fan orchard sprayer, configured as converging or plane (vertical fan units) <b>air</b> <b>jets,</b> were compared in several experiments. Inclining the top or bottom fans towards the tree created different types of converging <b>air</b> <b>jets.</b> The influence of these <b>air</b> <b>jets</b> on spray deposition, on air velocities and on forces acting on apple trees was measured. Deposition was measured throughout the season with fluorescent tracer on leaf sized filterpaper targets inside canopies. Different types of air velocity measurements were made with the fan sprayer passing the tree. Peak velocities were recorded at positions throughout apple tree canopies, and indepth measurements of several air velocity parameters were made inside, above and beyond an apple tree canopy. Velocity pulse values were integrated over time. Air velocity profiles were measured in stationary situations and compared to existing mathematical models. Forces and moments caused by the <b>air</b> <b>jet</b> striking the tree were measured with a new method, utilizing a multicomponent force transducer, placed between the tree trunk and the ground. Compared to plane <b>air</b> <b>jets,</b> converging <b>air</b> <b>jets</b> resulted in significantly higher deposition values, more uniformly distributed through the canopy. The converging <b>air</b> <b>jets</b> increased the <b>air</b> velocity parameters in the denser parts of the canopy, and resulted in higher air power and energy at those positions. Converging <b>air</b> <b>jets</b> transferred greater forces to the canopy. This could be explained by the ability of the converging <b>air</b> <b>jets</b> to reduce the air flow directed above the trees, thereby concentrate and increase the amount of spray liquid, penetrating into the densest part of the canopy. Finally, an increased air velocity improved deposition prerequisites. The new method for measuring forces and moments has a potential to extend and complement other application technology measuring methods.

40|$|In {{diffusion}} combustion systems, {{fuel and}} oxidizer (usually air) are admitted into the combustion chamber separately {{in the form}} of turbulent jets. Most often, fuel enters the furnace from a round nozzle and air is admitted through an annulus surrounding the central fuel nozzle. Momentum of the fuel and <b>air</b> <b>jets</b> is utilized <b>for</b> directing the flame and controlling the mixture formation which is typically the rate-limiting step of the combustion process. Hence the behavior of turbulent coaxial jets must be well understood prior to any detailed analysis of these systems. In this study, a set of relations is proposed to predict the behavior of turbulent coaxial gaseous jets using curve-fits to the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solutions and the fluid flow governing equations as well as the ideal gas equation of state. A computer program is developed to implement the presented model. Results are compared with existing data and reasonable agreement is observed. According to the results, the presented model makes sufficiently accurate estimates of the flow and concentration fields in a very short time...|$|R
