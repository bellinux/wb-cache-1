5|$|The core game {{is based}} on Hangman. Each round has a {{category}} and a blank word puzzle, with each blank representing a letter in the answer, and punctuation revealed as needed. Most puzzles are straightforward figures of speech that fit within a mostly static list of categories, and this list has evolved {{over the course of}} the series. Crossword puzzles were added to the rotation in 2016. In such rounds, a clue bonding the words in the puzzle is given instead of a traditional category, and contestants win by solving <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> in the crossword. The titular Wheel of Fortune is a roulette-style wheel mechanism with 24 spaces, most of which are labeled with dollar amounts ranging from $500 to $900, plus a top dollar value: $2,500 in round 1, $3,500 in rounds 2 and 3, and $5,000 for round 4 and any subsequent rounds. The wheel also features two Bankrupt wedges and one Lose a Turn, both of which forfeit the contestant's turn, with the former also eliminating any cash or prizes the contestant has accumulated within the round. Each game features three contestants, or occasionally, three two-contestant teams positioned behind a single scoreboard with its own flipper. The left scoreboard from the viewer's perspective is colored red, the center yellow, and the right blue, with the contestants' positions determined by a random selection prior to taping.|$|E

25|$|The {{database}} {{draws upon}} some 4,300 Hebrew sources, from the classic Rabbinic literature period (2nd century BCE) through the Geonic period (11th century CE) to 1947. Literary strata and genres represented include the Dead Sea Scrolls, inscriptions, Talmud and Midrash, Geonic literature, prayer and piyyut, Karaite literature, science, deeds, colophons, amulets, and the like. Essentially a concordance, the online resource accesses <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> {{in the database}} and enables retrieval of citations according to roots, lemmata, and declined forms or combinations, {{as well as of}} specific texts by title, author, date, or literary genre. It is updated as new research becomes available and as more old texts are discovered.|$|E
25|$|An {{issue when}} using n-gram {{language}} models are out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. They are encountered {{in computational linguistics}} and natural language processing when the input includes words which were not present in a system's dictionary or database during its preparation. By default, when a language model is estimated, the entire observed vocabulary is used. In some cases, {{it may be necessary}} to estimate the language model with a specific fixed vocabulary. In such a scenario, the n-grams in the corpus that contain an out-of-vocabulary word are ignored. The n-gram probabilities are smoothed over <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> in the vocabulary even if they were not observed.|$|E
25|$|Traditional phonics {{instruction}} has marked benefits. Early reading {{often involves}} significant expansion of a child's mental lexicon, which includes <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> {{the child has}} been exposed to and their meanings. By focusing {{on the principle of}} linking specific sounds and characters, the child has the ability to recognize new words and derive meaning from them. Being able to adapt what they know about language to new words they experience is crucial to expanding their mental lexicon; this allows for productive reading that is the ability to read new words. It also produces higher achievement for beginning readers and the difference is the greatest for those at risk of failing to learn to read. While some children are able to infer these rules on their own, some need explicit instructions on phonics rules. Overall, children who are directly taught phonics are better at reading, spelling and comprehension.|$|E

25|$|Digraphs are {{distinguished}} in collation (i.e. {{to determine}} the order of entries in a dictionary or directory) from the letters they consist of. For example, cukor is followed by csata, even though s precedes u, as cs is considered a single entity, and follows <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> starting with c. In general dictionaries, contracted forms of digraphs are collated {{as if they were}} written in full, e.g. Menyhért precedes mennybolt, even though n precedes y, because nny consists of nynbsp&+nbsp&ny, and h precedes ny. Short and long versions of vowels are considered equal for the purposes of collation (e.g. ír precedes Irak) unless the words are otherwise identically spelt, in which case the short vowel precedes the long one (e.g. egér precedes éger). Phrases and hyphenated compounds are collated ignoring the space or the hyphen between their elements; lower and upper case don't count either.|$|E
25|$|Chapman's {{experiences}} {{during the}} weekend on which he committed the murder have {{been turned into a}} feature-length movie called Chapter 27, in which he is played by Jared Leto. The film was written and directed by Jarrett Schaefer and is based on the Jones book. The film's title is a reference to The Catcher in the Rye, which has 26 chapters. Chapter 27 premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2007 and received polarized reactions from critics. The film had a limited release in theaters in the United States in March 2008. Chapter 27 was released widely onto DVD on September 30, 2008. Another film was made before the feature film entitled The Killing of John Lennon starring Jonas Ball as Chapman, which documents Chapman's life before and up to the murder and portrays Chapman in a somewhat sympathetic light. The film features Ball as Chapman narrating the film and states that <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> are Chapman's own.|$|E
25|$|As each {{character}} represents {{a single word}} (or, more precisely, a morpheme), many logograms are required to write <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of language. The vast array of logograms and the memorization of what they mean are major disadvantages of logographic systems over alphabetic systems. However, since the meaning is inherent to the symbol, the same logographic system can theoretically be used to represent different languages. In practice, {{the ability to communicate}} across languages only works for the closely related varieties of Chinese, as differences in syntax reduce the crosslinguistic portability of a given logographic system. Japanese uses Chinese logograms extensively in its writing systems, with most of the symbols carrying the same or similar meanings. However, the grammatical differences between Japanese and Chinese are significant enough that a long Chinese text is not readily understandable to a Japanese reader without any knowledge of basic Chinese grammar, though short and concise phrases such as those on signs and newspaper headlines are much easier to comprehend.|$|E

The origins {{of this are}} more {{difficult}} to trace but it does feature in a work by the Irish writer Brian Oswald Donn-Byrne, Messer Marco Polo (1925), p.25, and it is in common usage in Ireland. Trollope asserted on his arrival in Ireland, [...] "I was to live at a place called Banagher on the Shannon which I had heard of because of its having once been conquered, though it had heretofore conquered everything, including the Devil". Interestingly, a John O'Donovan, in an Ordnance Survey letter for King's County in 1838, attempts to trace the origins of the name Banagher. He states: [...] "Of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> which enter into Irish nomenclature Beannchair seems the most difficult of explanation" [...] and goes on to say [...] "This name 'beats the Devil.'" [...] M.F. Kenny in his 2003 book Marathon Marriage uses a story of the devil losing a game of cards to a blacksmith named Banagher at the Black Stile at Garry Castle on the road between Banagher and Birr, as an explanation for the phrase.|$|E
50|$|In papers {{published}} since 2008, ASJP has {{employed a}} similarity judgment program based on Levenshtein distance (LD). This approach {{was found to}} produce better classificatory results measured against expert opinion than the method used initially. LD {{is defined as the}} minimum number of successive changes necessary to convert one word into another, where each change is the insertion, deletion, or substitution of a symbol. Within the Levenshtein approach, differences in word length can be corrected for by dividing LD by the number of symbols of the longer of <b>the</b> two compared <b>words.</b> This produces normalized LD (LDN). An LDN divided (LDND) between the two languages is calculated by dividing the average LDN for <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> pairs involving <b>the</b> same meaning by the average LDN for <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> pairs involving different meanings. This second normalization is intended to correct for chance similarity.|$|R
