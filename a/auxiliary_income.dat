The plant is heavily cultivated around homes, homesteads, and village centers as a preferred reception/meeting point. It constitutes a key <b>auxiliary</b> <b>income</b> source for farmers, women, and vendors alike. The whole plant and/or its parts are associated with several practices and applications amongst the Igbo tribal people. It is preferable to soften the fruit with hot ashes and eat it with maize. The people utilize the plant’s medicinal properties for managing {{a vast number of}} health conditions.
