5|$|The main {{collectibles}} {{available in}} Pokémon Channel are trading cards that display various Pokémon. The trading cards, known in game <b>as</b> <b>Nice</b> Cards, exist in three forms: Single, which simply show a picture; Motion, which are holographic; and Platinum, which are holographic {{and play the}} respective Pokémon's cries. The collectibles can be found by having Pikachu speak with other Pokémon and help them with tasks, or by ordering from Shop 'n Squirtle. There is a virtual Pokémon Mini console hidden under the player's bed that plays six games: Snorlax's Lunch Time (exclusive to Pokémon Channel) and five others previously released for the real-life Pokémon Mini. The games are simple and mainly based on rhythm.|$|E
25|$|Once {{all data}} has been {{collected}} and each case has undergone review, multi-disciplinary chapter writing groups are convened, where the expert reviews of each case are examined to enable key learning themes {{to be drawn}} out for the final report. The lead member of each chapter writing group will then draft the initial chapter, which is then reviewed by the other group members and the Programme Lead before a final version is completed. Where possible, any recommendations by the CEMD are linked to national guidance from organisations such <b>as</b> <b>NICE</b> or SIGN.|$|E
25|$|There are notable {{differences}} between the various LM-1 revisions. The Rev. 1 LM-1 is recognizable by its engraved buttons and lack of Shuffle and Auto-Correct LEDs. The drum buttons were engraved with a small symbol of the drum it represented (the bass drum button had a small engraving of a bass drum on it). These buttons were later discontinued {{because they were too}} expensive to manufacture. Internally it was different as well. It had single chips for the kick, tom, and conga sounds, and double chips for the clap. The Rev. 1 LM-1's did not have the filter on the kick, toms, and congas that Rev. 2 and later machines had. As a result, it didn't sound <b>as</b> <b>nice</b> as the Rev. 2 and later machines, but the toms and congas could be played simultaneously.|$|E

500|$|On 31 August 2016, the {{deadline}} {{day for the}} summer transfer window, {{it was announced that}} Balotelli had joined OGC Nice on a free transfer, after signing on a one-year deal. In an interview leading up to his Nice debut on 11 September, Balotelli told Canal Plus that joining Liverpool in the summer of 2014 was the [...] "worst mistake of his life" [...] and that Brendan Rodgers and Jürgen Klopp (the two Liverpool managers during Balotelli's time at the club) did not make a good impression on him and he did not get along with them. He made his debut for Nice, starting in a home Ligue 1 match against Marseille, converting a penalty in the 7th minute and scoring a header from Ricardo's cross in the 78th minute <b>as</b> <b>Nice</b> won the match 3–2. On 21 September, Balotelli, in only his second Ligue 1 appearance, struck another double in the 30th and 68th minutes <b>as</b> <b>Nice</b> thrashed Monaco 4–0 in the Azurean derby at the Allianz Riviera to go to the top of Ligue 1. No other player had scored four goals in their first two Ligue 1 matches in the last 25 years. On 29 September, Balotelli scored his fifth goal in just four competitive matches for Nice when he fired home a right-footed shot from just outside the penalty area in the 43rd minute after an assist from Malang Sarr in a 2016–17 UEFA Europa League Group I match against Krasnodar in an eventual 5–2 away defeat. That was his first goal in a UEFA club competition since February 2015, when he scored for Liverpool against Beşiktaş in the round of 32 of the 2014–15 UEFA Europa League knockout phase. On 2 October, Balotelli scored the winning goal in the 86th minute by sending a powerful kick {{from the edge of the}} box into the top right corner <b>as</b> <b>Nice</b> defeated Lorient 2–1 in a home Ligue 1 match, during which he received a yellow card for taking off his shirt in celebration of his goal and was subsequently sent off minutes later in stoppage time after receiving a second, controversial yellow card, following an altercation with Lorient's Steven Moreira, where neither player appeared to do anything wrong. Balotelli's red card was rescinded four days later after referee Olivier Thual's admission that he had made a mistake in showing Balotelli the second yellow card and the French Football League's Disciplinary Commission decided to annul his second yellow card, thus allowing him to be available for the following league match. On 21 December, he received his first official red card in a Nice shirt in a 0–0 Ligue 1 away draw with Girondins de Bordeaux for kicking Igor Lewczuk.|$|E
500|$|The {{next morning}} gay leaders convened in a {{committee}} {{room in the}} Civic Center. Supervisor Harry Britt, who had replaced Milk, along with the more militant gays of the Harvey Milk Democratic Club, {{made it clear that}} nobody was to apologize for the riots. Britt informed a press conference, [...] "Harvey Milk's people do not have anything to apologize for. Now the society {{is going to have to}} deal with us not <b>as</b> <b>nice</b> little fairies who have hairdressing salons, but as people capable of violence. We're not going to put up with Dan Whites anymore." [...] Reporters were surprised that a public official would condone the violent acts of the previous night, expecting an apology from Britt. Subsequent attempts to find a gay leader who would give an apologetic statement proved unsuccessful.|$|E
500|$|The {{soundtrack of}} the game was less well received.

Conversely, GameSpot found that the music was [...] "decent" [...] and occasionally [...] "fitting or even catchy", but {{failed to live up}} to the high expectations of the series. IGN felt that while not [...] "quite as bad as importers have made it out to be", the songs [...] "aren't nearly <b>as</b> <b>nice</b> as they have been in past Castlevania adventures." [...] Reviewers also disliked the lack of difficulty with GamePro describing it as the game's [...] "biggest flaw". Other criticism included predictable and easy boss battles, and [...] "a much smaller explorable area and somewhat less compelling map design".|$|E

500|$|As a stop-gap measure, the {{fortified}} vaults in {{the basement}} of the United States Treasury Building were converted into living quarters for the president and his family, to be used in the event an attack came prior to the bunker's completion. Unlike the White House, which was a fragile structure with what was then a shallow basement, the Treasury Building has a deep basement built into a foundation of granite and its vaults are nested into stone. The ten-room presidential suite sat two floors below the cash room behind a steel bank door and was described as [...] "every bit <b>as</b> <b>nice</b> as a suite at the Mayflower Hotel". The tunnel, connecting the White House to the open areaway of the Treasury Building, was excavated to allow the evacuation of the president from one building to the other without the need to make the crossing outdoors.|$|E

[...] Joe learns what a baby learns: the comforting {{presence}} of his mother, the presence of another figure, who does not smell <b>as</b> <b>nice,</b> and who always leaves as soon as he picks up his black bag. [...] Joe is seen as a baby and then not again as a child; the audience takes his perspective. [...] Joe's Grandma notices him trying to walk, calls for Marjorie to witness the first steps, and once he takes them, as the chorus states, [...] "the world belongs to Joe" [...] ("One Foot, Other Foot"). [...] Joe grows to school age, and loses his beloved Grandma. [...] He is comforted by Jennie Brinker, a businessman's daughter. [...] The two grow to high school age and date, though Joe lacks the nerve to kiss her, to Jennie's frustration. [...] As Joe prepares to leave for college, Dr. Taylor hopes that his son will help him in his medical practice, and he and Marjorie wonder if Joe will marry Jennie ("A Fellow Needs a Girl").|$|E
