40|$|Background: In most mammals, sex is {{determined}} {{at the beginning}} of gestation by the constitution of the sex chromosomes, XY in males <b>and</b> <b>XX</b> <b>in</b> females. Case: Here we report an interesting case characterized by ambiguous genitalia and ovotestis in a newborn carrying an apparently female karyotype (46 XX). Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (Array-CGH) revealed an unbalanced rearrangement resulting in the deletion of the distal Xp and the duplication of the proximal Xp contiguous region with presence of the Y chromosome from Ypter to Yq 11. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) showed that this portion of the Y was translocated to the tip of the abnormal X and that the duplicated portion of chromosome X was inverted. Altogether, the abnormal chromosome was a dicentric one with the centromere of the Y chromosome apparently inactivated. Conclusion: The presence within the translocated Y chromosome of the SRY gene explains the devolopment of testes although it is not clear the reason for the genitalia ambiguit...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the historical claims about philosophy, {{dating back to}} Parmenides, that we argue underlie Jacques Lacan’s polemical provocations in the mid- 1970 s that his position was an “anti-philosophie”. Following an introduction surveying the existing literature on the subject, in part ii, we systematically present the account of classical philosophy Lacan has {{in mind when he}} declares psychoanalysis to be an antiphilosophy after 1975, assembling his claims about the history of ideas in Seminars XVII <b>and</b> <b>XX</b> <b>in</b> ways earlier contributions of this subject have not systematically done. In part iii, focusing upon Lacan’s remarkable reading of Descartes’ break with premodern philosophy—but touching on Lacan’s readings of Hegel and (in a remarkable confirmation of Lacan’s “Parmenidean” conception of philosophy) the early Wittgenstein—we examine Lacan’s positioning of psychoanalysis as a legatee of the Cartesian moment in the history of western ideas, nearly-contemporary with Galileo’s mathematization of physics and carried forwards by Kant’s critical philosophy and account of the substanceless subject of apperception. In different terms than Slavoj Žižek, we propose that it is Lacan’s famous avowal that the subject of the psychoanalysis is the subject first essayed by Descartes in The Meditations on First Philosophy as confronting an other capable of deceit (as against mere illusion or falsity) that decisively measures the distance between Lacan’s unique “antiphilosophy” and the forms of later modern linguistic and cultural relativism whose hegemony Alain Badiou has decried, {{at the same time as}} it sets Lacan’s antiphilosophy apart from the Parmenidean legacy for which thinking and being could be the same...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to isolate structural chromosome mutations causing "semi"-sterility which can be used for genetic control of the onion fly Hylemya antiqua (Meigen). For the induction, X-rays or fast neutrons were applied in different doses on males and females. "Semi"-sterile families were screened cytologically for translocations and inversions. It appeared that high doses 0. 5 krad of X-rays) tended to yield complex rearrangements which present difficulties in practical programs, in addition to the useful less complicated rearrangements. They also produce more genetic background damage than lower doses (0 - 5 krad), which still yield acceptable numbers of uncomplicated rearrangements and therefore are advised for a genetic control program. Because of strongly reduced fecundity of irradiated females these are less suitable for induction of rearrangements than males, although older females because of higher fecundity give better results than young females. Fast neutrons on young males were useful and a low dose of 0. 25 krad appeared {{to be as good as}} 1. 0 krad. Seventeen different translocations and two pericentric inversions were observed. Most "breakpoints" are located on the longer chromosome arms. Inversion heterozygous males were as fertile as the control which confirms their achiasmate meiosis. Eight translocation stocks were sibcrossed. In five of these, translocation homozygotes were found as larvae and in three out of these five even as adults. The occurrence of duplication/deficiency (from adjacent I orientation) larvae in the five stocks mentioned was remarkable. From experiments with an X-linked translocation it was concluded that the acrocentric chromosomes are the sex-chromosomes. The alternate and adjacent I orientation frequencies in translocation heterozygotes (X-linked) were shown to be equal in each sex, while no adjacent II was found. In this translocation meiotic numerical non- disjunction occurred in 18. 7 % of the tranlocation heterozygous females but in 2. 0 % of the males. This difference is probably a consequence of the difference in meiotic behaviour between the sexes. A good relationship was found between the degree of chromosomal unbalance and the frequency of late embryonic lethals (brown eggs) which was used as a graduator in the selection for "semi"-sterility. Adult fertile translocation trisomics and adult sterile tertiary trisomics were obtained (both sexes) after meiotic numerical non- disjunction. In translocation trisomic males the X-, Y- and translocated (extra) X-chromosome were shown to disjoin at random. In females the two normal X-chromosomes almost (95 %) preferentially disjoin, while the translocated X-chromosome goes to either one of the poles. Primary trisomic males (XXY) and females (XXX) were obtained from testcrossed translocation trisomic parents. XXY males produced four types of gametes XY, X, Y <b>and</b> <b>XX</b> <b>in</b> equal numbers. XXX females only gave XX and X gametes in an equal number. Succesfull attempts to obtain homozygotes for this X-linked translocation are reported. The theoretical background of genetic insect control is discussed...|$|E
