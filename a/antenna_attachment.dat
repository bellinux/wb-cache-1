5000|$|The {{valley is}} most {{noteworthy}} {{today for the}} recently refurbished Haikū Stairs (also known as [...] "Stairway to Heaven"), a foot trail of 3,922 metal stairs that ascends to Puu Keahiakahoe, a 2800 ft peak above the east valley wall. The stairs were originally constructed {{as a means of}} reaching the radio <b>antenna</b> <b>attachment</b> points high on the surrounding ridgeline. The trail starts at an elevation of 480 ft and covers an approximate horizontal distance of 4500 ft for an average slope of about 30 degrees (however, some sections are nearly vertical).The Haikū Stairs are currently closed to the public, although people still trespass to experience the nearly two-hour climb.|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 204 Ergasilus sarsi, a copepod, were {{collected}} from Tanganyika Killifish Lamprichthys tanganicanus in Lake Tanganyika during March 2010. The prevalence was 86. 40 %, the mean intensity was 7. 56, and the mean abundance was 6. 38. Only 27 of the fish were infested, and the highest infestation on one fish was 29. Proliferation of mucus cells and lamellar fusion occurred. Haemorrhage due to blood vessel compression was noted. This is the first record of E. sarsi from Tanganyika Killifish. This study is also the first to provide {{a description of the}} pathological alterations caused by E. sarsi. During an opportunity to survey in Lake Tanganyika in March (summer) 2010, the copepod Ergasilus sarsi was col-lected from Tanganyika Killifish Lamprichthys tanganicanus, a benthopelagic, nonmigratory fish that is endemic to the shore regions of Lake Tanganyika (Huber 1996). The fish is char-acterized by the intense iridescent blue color and adults reach approximately 10 cm TL rendering the species a potential candi-date for aquaculture; as such, it has been introduced into various parts of the world. Ergasilus copepods occur widely distributed throughout Africa; they are nonhost-specific fish parasites (Wilson 1911; Oldewage and van As 1987) inhabiting fresh, marine, and brack-ish water (Boxshall and Defaye 2008). Four Ergasilus species occur in Lake Tanganyika E. flaccidus, E. kandti, E. megacheir, and E. sarsi Capart, 1944. Only females are parasitic and they at-tach with large modified second <b>antennae.</b> Although <b>attachment</b> and feeding may cause extensive pathological change to the gills, some Ergasilus species simply embrace the gill filament (Oldewage and van As 1987) while others (e. g., E. colomeus...|$|R
40|$|The Acanthopteroctetidae {{are one of}} the first-originated family-group {{lineages}} within "tongue moths" (Lepidoptera-Glossata). The {{purpose of}} this study is to provide a comprehensive account (based on whole mount preparations, serial sections, and Scanning electron microscopy) of the cephalic structure of an adult exemplar of the family, to supplement the sparse available information. Notable plesiomorphies include the retention of frontal retractors of the narrow labrum, a high supraocular index linked to strong development of cranio-mandibular ad- and abductors, and perhaps the unusually short but still coilable (just ca. 1. 5 turns) galeal "tongue. " Notable specializations (probably mostly family autapomorphies) include a complement of large sensilla placodea on the male <b>antennae,</b> an apical <b>attachment</b> of the long dorsal tentorial arm to the cranium, an extreme reduction of the single-segmented labial palps, a particularly strong subgenal bridge and a surface structure of near-parallel ridges on the ommatidial corneae. The presence of sizable saccular mandibular (type 1) glands opening into the adductor apodeme is unexpected, no counterparts being known from neighboring taxa. The same is true for ventral salivarium dilator muscles originating on the prelabium; and tentatively suggested to be homologues of the extrinsic palp flexors (the insertion shift being related to loss of original function due to palp reduction), rather than to the ventral salivarium muscles of more basal insects. A complete "deutocerebral loop"' may or may not be developed, as is true for a mutual appression of the optic lobe and circumoesophageal connective/suboesophageal ganglion, enclosing the anterior tentorial arm between them; a suboesophageal innervation of the retrocerebral complex was not observed. No characters bearing on the monophyly of the Coelolepida were identified. The scapo-pedicellar articulation with a scapal process and a smooth intercalary sclerite is reminiscent of conditions in Neopseustidae, but remains debatable as a synapomorphy of the two families.

40|$|For {{about two}} decades, SWEPOS (the Swedish Permanent GNSS network) pillar {{stations}} {{have been used}} indifferent geodetic and geodynamic studies. To keep continuous measurements of these long lived pillar stationsand {{at the same time}} modernizing the SWEPOS network, it has been decided to install new truss mast stations,equipped with modern and individually calibrated antennas and radomes, capable of tracking all new GNSSsatellites. Installation of mast stations started in 2011. Today, each pillar station in the SWEPOS permanent GNSSnetwork has a close-by truss mast station, mostly in 10 meters distance with individual calibrated Leica chokering <b>antenna</b> and its <b>attachment</b> (LEIAR 25. R 3, LEIT). Due to their closeness to pillars, the modern mast stationsmay provide additional information for the analysis of ground movements in Sweden e. g. to distinguish betweentectonic and geodynamic processes (e. g. land uplift in Sweden). In this study, we have used two datasets from two different seasons for 21 pillars and 21 mast stations andformed different networks. The mast network has been processed using both IGS standard (type) and individuallycalibrated PCV (Phase Center Variation) models and therefore the effect of these two different PCV models onheight components has been investigated. In a combined network, we processed all 42 stations (21 pillars+ 21 mast) to see how this multi-baseline network (861 baselines) combination differs from independent mast or pillarnetworks with much less baselines (210 baselines). For our analysis, we used the GAMIT-GLOBK softwareand compared different networks. Ambiguity resolutions, daily coordinate repeatability and differences betweenheight components in different solutions are presented. Moreover, the GAMIT and BERNESE solutions forcombined mast and pillar networks are compared. Our results suggest that the SWEPOS truss mast stations can reliably be used for crustal deformation studies. The comparison between pillar and mast stations shows similar time series for different horizontal and verticalcomponents and their Normalized rms (nrms) and weighted rms (wmrs) are almost equal. Comparison of standard and calibrated PCV models for mast stations show notable differences in height compo-nents and reach up to 14 mm. These differences are antenna-dependent and are not systematic offsets. Therefore,whenever available, individual calibrated antenna models have to be used instead of standard (type) calibratedmodels. This study is part of the Swedish CLOSE III research project between Lantmäteriet, SP, and Chalmers Universityof Technology...|$|R
