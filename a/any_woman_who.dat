Many officials stated {{that she had the}} most natural ability of <b>any</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> came through their school. In late 2002, Perez auditioned for World Wrestling Entertainment's reality show Tough Enough III, making it through to the final twenty-one, before being eliminated in the final cut of the first episode. After she was eliminated from the contest, trainer Al Snow encouraged her to keep trying to pursue her dream as a wrestler.|$|E
5|$|The Romans did not, however, remove Nabis {{from the}} Spartan throne. Even though Sparta was a {{landlocked}} and effectively powerless state, the Romans wanted an independent Sparta {{to act as}} a counterweight against the growing Achaean League. Nabis' allegiance was secured {{by the fact that he}} had to surrender five hostages, amongst them his son, Armenas. The Romans did not restore the exiles, wishing to avoid internal strife in Sparta. They did, however, allow <b>any</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> was married to an ex-helot but whose husband was in exile to join him.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year the college was officially integrated as A welcomed its first African American student. More change ensued, as, in 1965, the Board of Directors voted to make {{membership in the}} Corps of Cadets voluntary. The same year the Board voted to allow any woman, not just those connected to students and professors, to attend the university. The Board required that Rudder approve each female applicant; he accepted <b>any</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> met the academic requirements. During Rudder's tenure, African-American students were also welcomed, and in 1967, James L. Courtney of Dallas became the first African American to receive an undergraduate degree from Texas A University. He remained at Texas A and, in 1970, became the first African American to receive a D.V.M. degree from the College of Veterinary Medicine.|$|E

30|$|Discussion: In <b>any</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> {{presents}} with {{a history}} of a “lost” IUD and abdominal pain/discomfort, the surgeon should have a high index of suspicion and obtain plain abdominal-pelvic X-ray films. It is prudent to specifically question women about history of IUD. We should aim to remove the lost coli laparoscopically.|$|R
25|$|The forming of a Churel is {{prevented}} by burying {{the corpse of}} <b>any</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> {{is likely to become}} one, instead of the usual Hindu cremation.

25|$|In Panjab, {{if a man}} dies on a bed {{his soul}} becomes a Bhoot (ghost), and a woman becomes a Churel. The Kharwars think that when the soul leaves the body, it becomes air but if it comes in contact with a person, the soul becomes troublesome. In western India {{especially}} Gujarat, <b>any</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> dies an unnatural death is believed {{to turn into a}} Churel, also known as jakihn, jakhai, mukai, nagulai and alvantin. Originally, it was believed that only a low-caste woman turns to a churel.|$|E
25|$|Late-19th-century Utah {{also had}} the most liberal divorce laws in the United States at the time. The laws were {{advantageous}} to women: <b>any</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> insisted on a divorce got one. One of Brigham Young's wives divorced him and launched a lucrative career as a public speaker. The divorce rate in late 19th-century Utah came close to 30 percent. This divorce rate was inflated by people from other states seeking an easy divorce in Utah. In 1896, Martha Hughes Cannon {{was the first woman}} in the nation elected to state senate. She ran against her husband.|$|E

He did remarry a woman named Myra Lake (June Graham), {{who was one of}} Amy's teachers, but the marriage dissolved because the two families didn't like each other, although Amy considered her a mother figure.|$|R
25|$|The {{classical}} {{caesarean section}} involves a midline incision on the uterus longitudinal incision which allows a larger space {{to deliver the}} baby. It is performed at very early gestations where the lower segment of the uterus is unformed as it is safer in this situation for the baby: but it is rarely performed other than at these early gestations, as the operation is more prone to complications than a low transverse uterine incision. <b>Any</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> has had a classical section will be recommended to have an elective repeat section in subsequent pregnancies as the vertical incision {{is much more likely}} to rupture in labour than the transverse incision.|$|E
25|$|Sikhs {{generally}} use {{the words}} Singh ("lion") and Kaur ("princess") as surnames added to the otherwise unisex first names of men and women, respectively. It is also common to use a different surname after Singh in which case Singh or Kaur are used as middle names (Montek Singh Ahluwalia, Surinder Kaur Badal). The tenth Guru of Sikhism ordered (Hukamnama) that any man who considered himself a Sikh must use Singh in his name and <b>any</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> considered herself a Sikh must use Kaur in her name. Other middle names or honorifics that are sometimes used as surnames include Kumar, Dev, Lal, and Chand.|$|E

50|$|On October 25, 1919, Mary S. Lockwood co-founded the American Women's Legion in Washington, D.C., {{to assist}} {{veterans}} {{and their families}} and to engage in patriotic work. The organization swiftly grew into a national one. Lockwood had helped found the Daughters of the American Revolution several decades earlier, and she patterned the Women's Legion on the DAR. Membership in the Legion was open to <b>any</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> was a mother, wife, daughter, sister, or official next-of-kin of a veteran who served in World War I.|$|R
500|$|Militant feminists {{expressed}} their disdain with an inherently sexist and patriarchal society, and concluded {{the most effective}} way to overcome sexism and attain the equality of women would be to deny men any power or pleasure from women. For women who subscribed to this philosophy—dubbing themselves lesbian-feminists—lesbian was a term chosen by women to describe <b>any</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> dedicated her approach to social interaction and political motivation to the welfare of women. Sexual desire was not the defining characteristic of a lesbian-feminist, but rather her focus on politics. Independence from men as oppressors was a central tenet of lesbian-feminism, and many believers strove to separate themselves physically and economically from traditional male-centered culture. In the ideal society, named Lesbian Nation, [...] "woman" [...] and [...] "lesbian" [...] were interchangeable.|$|E
500|$|The album's third single, [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)", {{became its}} {{greatest}} chart success, peaking at number 25 on the Hot 100 Singles and at number {{two on the}} R Singles chart. The infamous music video for [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" [...] helped in boosting the song's appeal, as well as D'Angelo's. Billboard wrote of the video, [...] "it's pure sexuality. D'Angelo, muscularly cut and glistening, is shot from the hips up, naked, with just enough shown to prompt a slow burning desire in most <b>any</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> sees it. The video alone could make the song {{one of the biggest}} of the coming year". It earned three nominations for the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, including Video of the Year, Best R Video, and Best Male Video.|$|E
500|$|On {{the basis}} of such assessments, {{researchers}} such as Cheryl Glenn, Professor at the Pennsylvania State University, argue that Aspasia {{seems to have been}} the only woman in classical Greece to have distinguished herself in the public sphere and must have influenced Pericles in the composition of his speeches. Some scholars believe that Aspasia opened an academy for young women of good families or even invented the Socratic method. However, Robert W. Wallace, Professor of classics at Northwestern University, underscores that [...] "we cannot accept as historical the joke that Aspasia taught Pericles how to speak and hence was a master rhetorician or philosopher". According to Wallace, the intellectual role Aspasia was given by Plato may have derived from comedy. Kagan describes Aspasia as [...] "a beautiful, independent, brilliantly witty young woman capable of holding her own in conversation with the best minds in Greece and of discussing and illuminating any kind of question with her husband". Roger Just, a classicist and Professor of social anthropology at the University of Kent, believes that Aspasia was an exceptional figure, but her example alone is enough to underline the fact that <b>any</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> was to become the intellectual and social equal of a man {{would have to be a}} hetaera. According to Sr. Prudence Allen, a philosopher and seminary professor, Aspasia moved the potential of women to become philosophers one step forward from the poetic inspirations of Sappho.|$|E
5000|$|Subscribers to {{one model}} {{say that some}} {{misogyny}} results from the Madonna-whore complex, which is the inability to see women {{as anything other than}} [...] "mothers" [...] or [...] "whores"; people with this complex place each encountered woman into one of these categories. Another variant model alleges that one cause of misogyny is some men thinking in terms of a virgin/whore dichotomy, which results in them considering as [...] "whores" [...] <b>any</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> do not adhere to an Abrahamic standard of moral purity.|$|R

50|$|The impact {{this plant}} has on Nepalese women and {{children}} is also very positive. It {{is not difficult to}} cultivate this plant, plus it does not require much human intervention, only periodical weeding, or cutting it back, as it grows naturally. So it can be cultivated without a lot of hard labour. This allows <b>any</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> may be growing it to take care of other household matters, such as raising the children. It is also nutritious for children as it contains high volumes of vitamin C, which is needed for growing bodies.|$|R
500|$|James Douglas {{illustrated}} his {{denunciation of}} The Well with {{a photograph of}} Radclyffe Hall in a silk smoking jacket and bow tie, holding a cigarette and monocle. She was also wearing a straight knee-length skirt, but later Sunday Express articles cropped the photo so tightly that it became difficult to tell she was not wearing trousers. Hall's style of dress was not scandalous in the 1920s; short hairstyles were common, and the combination of tailored jackets and short skirts was a recognised fashion, discussed in magazines as the [...] "severely masculine" [...] look. Some lesbians, like Hall, adopted variations of the style {{as a way of}} signalling their sexuality, but it was a code that only a few knew how to read. With the controversy over The Well of Loneliness, Hall became the public face of sexual inversion, and all women who favoured masculine fashions came under new scrutiny. Lesbian journalist Evelyn Irons– who considered Hall's style of dress [...] "rather effeminate" [...] compared to her own– said that after the publication of The Well, truck drivers would call out on the street to <b>any</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> wore a collar and tie: [...] "Oh, you're Miss Radclyffe Hall". Some welcomed their newfound visibility: when Hall spoke at a luncheon in 1932, the audience was full of women who had imitated her look. But in a study of lesbian women in Salt Lake City in the 1920s and '30s, nearly all regretted the publication of The Well because it had drawn unwanted attention to them.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{opinion of}} the music video was {{generally}} favorable. Entertainment Weeklys columnist Jim Farber gave the music video an A rating, and called the close-ups of D'Angelo's physique a [...] "measure of the video's smarm-free joy {{that even though the}} camera puts the viewer in the pleasure-giving position, we feel in no way manipulated or debased". Farber also lauded the video's depiction of sexuality, stating [...] "it feels like a privilege to be part of such a comfortable act of carnality. Was it good for you, too?". A columnist for Billboard magazine shared a similar sentiment about the video, writing that [...] "it's pure sexuality. D'Angelo, muscularly cut and glistening, is shot from the hips up, naked, with just enough shown to prompt a slow burning desire in most <b>any</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> sees it. The video alone could make the song one of the biggest of the coming year". However, David Thigpen of Time magazine criticized the vanity of the video, stating [...] "It's a good song, but I thought he was preening pretty heavily in the video". Thigpen also compared it to the music video for singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette's [...] "Thank U" [...] (1998), which features Morissette appearing nude, and stated [...] "Nakedness is usually an expression of vulnerability — that was the point of the Alanis Morissette video. But in this case, it's really about power, an in-your-face form of masculinity". Douglas Century of The New York Times called it [...] "the most controversial music video to air in years", and favored the video's unconventional concept, writing that [...] "'Untitled' breaks a long-established pattern in hip-hop and R videos in which male artists are often dressed in roughneck gear — baggy jeans, Timberland boots and baseball caps — surrounded by shimmying women in thong bikinis".|$|E
