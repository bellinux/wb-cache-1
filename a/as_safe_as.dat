5|$|The Sultan of Oman ordered six Mercedes 450 limousines in 1977, {{but quickly}} {{discovered}} {{that they were not}} <b>as</b> <b>safe</b> <b>as</b> he had been led to believe. His ex-SAS bodyguards tested one of the cars in the desert in July 1977, by firing at it, but a bullet hit an emergency air cylinder, which led to the petrol tank blowing up, burning the whole car. The remaining cars were immediately sent back, with a demand to refund the money spent.|$|E
5|$|The {{task force}} left Hastings—{{approximately}} 15 minutes' flying {{time from the}} West Side Boys' camp—at approximately 06:15. Downstream from the villages—approximately 15 minutes' flying time, {{just out of the}} West Side Boys' visual and hearing range, the helicopters went into a holding pattern to allow the SAS observation teams time to get into position to prevent the West Side Boys from attacking any of the captives before the extraction teams were on the ground. Once the observation teams were in position, the helicopters proceeded up the line of Rokel Creek, the Chinooks flying low enough that the downdraft tore off the corrugated iron roofs of several huts in the villages, including the roof of the building in which the Royal Irish were being held. As the helicopters approached, the SAS observation team at Gberi Bana engaged West Side Boys {{in the vicinity of the}} captives to prevent any gang members from attempting to kill them before the area was secured. Upon their arrival, the two Lynx attack helicopters strafed the villages to make the landing zones <b>as</b> <b>safe</b> <b>as</b> possible for the Chinooks and destroy the heavy weapons that had been identified by the SAS observation teams.|$|E

25|$|A {{money market}} fund (also called a money market mutual fund) is an {{open-ended}} mutual fund that invests in short-term debt securities such as US Treasury bills and commercial paper. Money market funds are widely (though not necessarily accurately) regarded as being <b>as</b> <b>safe</b> <b>as</b> bank deposits yet providing a higher yield. Regulated in the United States under the Investment Company Act of 1940, {{money market fund}}s are important providers of liquidity to financial intermediaries.|$|E
25|$|As sodomy was {{a capital}} offense, the {{organisation}} of homosexual {{men and their}} activities {{had to be a}} crucial point, {{in order to keep the}} community <b>as</b> <b>safe</b> <b>as</b> possible from prosecution. As a consequence, molly districts seemed to appear, and eventually grow, in areas in which their business could be acknowledged and tolerated at the same time: such connivance could be often found in areas with a high rate of criminal acts such as theft and prostitution.|$|E

25|$|Ares I had a payload {{capability}} in the 25-metric-ton (28-short-ton; 25-long-ton) class and was comparable to vehicles {{such as the}} Delta IV and the Atlas V. The NASA study group that selected {{what would become the}} Ares I rated the vehicle as almost twice <b>as</b> <b>safe</b> <b>as</b> an Atlas or Delta IV-derived design. The rocket was to have made use of an aluminum-lithium alloy which is lower in density but similar in strength compared to other aluminum alloys. The alloy is produced by Alcoa.|$|E
25|$|An unusual {{feature of}} {{valerian}} is that valerian root and leaves are a cat attractant similar to, and <b>as</b> <b>safe</b> <b>as,</b> catnip. Valerian contains the cat attractant actinidine. Cat attractants might mimic {{the odor of}} cat urine, which is caused by 3-mercapto-3-methylbutan-1-ol. Anecdotal reports claim that valerian is also attractive to rats—so much so {{that it had been}} used to bait traps. Stories describe the Pied Piper of Hamelin using both his pipes and valerian to attract rats. Research also shows that valerian root is the strongest chemoattractant of slime molds such as Physarum polycephalum.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{measures}} on the roadmap is to implement higher safety standards like early leak detection with hydrogen sensors. The Canadian Hydrogen Safety Program concluded that hydrogen fueling is <b>as</b> <b>safe</b> <b>as,</b> or safer than, compressed natural gas (CNG) fueling. The European Commission has funded the first higher educational program {{in the world in}} hydrogen safety engineering at the University of Ulster. It is expected that the general public {{will be able to use}} hydrogen technologies in everyday life with at least the same level of safety and comfort as with today's fossil fuels.|$|E

25|$|Hughes vehemently opposed Japan's racial {{equality}} proposition. Hughes recognised {{that such a}} clause would {{be a threat to}} White Australia and made it clear to British Prime Minister David Lloyd George that he would leave the conference if the clause was adopted.

25|$|Distressed {{vessels that}} request {{the service of}} towing vessels have means to make towing <b>as</b> <b>safe</b> <b>as</b> possible. Oil tankers have {{emergency}} towing equipment fixed at the forward and aft part of the vessel that will allow to connect the towing line. The connection of these apparatuses to the vessel's hull is reinforced according with class requirements. Bulk carriers and general cargo vessels {{are not required to}} have a specialized emergency towing arrangement. Depending on the vessel's type and keel laid date, in accordance with the MSC256(84) standard they must have on board an emergency towing procedure manual. This ship-specific manual describes procedures that will allow the vessel to be towed using its own equipment. The procedure should make use of the standard mooring equipment like mooring ropes, bits, rollers and Panama chock.|$|E
25|$|Another theory suggests, that Päts {{knew of the}} outbreaking {{war between}} Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union and was only {{looking for a way}} for Estonia to survive the short period in between. It is {{suggested}} that Päts knew of the difficulty of the situation and tried to keep Estonians <b>as</b> <b>safe</b> <b>as</b> possible by avoiding war with the Soviets and buying time. While trying not to give the Soviet Union a chance to punish the Estonians, he also continuously postponed the mobilization, which eventually never even took place, unlike in Latvia and Lithuania in 1939–1940. Under international law a war would have invalidated the Tartu Peace Treaty. As a lawyer, he also had to understand that his decisions were not valid when forced by an occupying power.|$|E

Mary of Guise was at the castle in the first days of May 1548 and Mary, Queen of Scots was kept at the castle for several months before her embarkation for France for safety on 13 July 1548. The sailing however was delayed by adverse winds till 7 August 1548. Her party including the Four Marys left the Clyde in a fleet under the command of Nicolas de Villegagnon. They sailed around the west coast of Ireland, to avoid English ships commanded by Edward Clinton.|$|E
500|$|Work in {{the early}} part of 1983 was mainly {{confined}} to smaller jobs such as casting various brasses and overhaul of the various parts of the fantail drivetrain and mechanism for controlling the Patent sails.
