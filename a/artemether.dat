5|$|Artemisinin is a {{sesquiterpene}} lactone {{containing a}} peroxide group, which {{is believed to}} be essential for its anti-malarial activity. Its derivatives, artesunate and <b>artemether,</b> have been used in clinics since 1987 for the treatment of drug-resistant and drug-sensitive malaria, especially cerebral malaria. These drugs are characterized by fast action, high efficacy and good tolerance. They kill the asexual forms of P. berghei and P. cynomolgi and have transmission-blocking activity. In 1985, Zhou Yiqing and his team combined <b>artemether</b> and lumefantrine into a single tablet, which was registered as a medicine in China in 1992. Later it became known as “Coartem”. Artemisinin combination treatments (ACTs) are now widely used to treat uncomplicated falciparum malaria, but access to ACTs is still limited in most malaria-endemic countries and only a minority of the patients who need artemisinin-based combination treatments receive them.|$|E
5|$|Recommended {{treatment}} for severe malaria is the intravenous use of antimalarial drugs. For severe malaria, parenteral artesunate {{was superior to}} quinine in both children and adults. In another systematic review, artemisinin derivatives (<b>artemether</b> and arteether) were as efficacious as quinine {{in the treatment of}} cerebral malaria in children. Treatment of severe malaria involves supportive measures that are best done in a critical care unit. This includes the management of high fevers and the seizures that may result from it. It also includes monitoring for poor breathing effort, low blood sugar, and low blood potassium.|$|E
25|$|For children, {{especially}} in the malaria-endemic areas of Africa, artesunate IV or IM, quinine (IV infusion or divided IM injection), and <b>artemether</b> IM are recommended.|$|E
50|$|Absorption of <b>artemether</b> is {{improved}} 2- to 3-fold with food. It is highly bound to protein (95.4%). Peak concentrations of <b>artemether</b> are seen 2 hours after administration.|$|E
50|$|<b>Artemether</b> is an {{antimalarial}} drug for uncomplicated malaria caused by P. falciparum (and chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum) or chloroquine-resistant P. vivax parasites. <b>Artemether</b> {{can also be}} used to treat severe malaria.|$|E
50|$|The Company {{offers its}} major {{products}} under three categories: <b>Artemether</b> series, consisting of <b>artemether</b> injections, capsules, and tablets {{for the treatment}} of subtertian malaria; Sanqi series, {{for the treatment of}} cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, and Gastrodine series, for the treatment of headache and neuralgia.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Artemether</b> (lipid-soluble: for oral, rectal or {{intramuscular}} use) ...|$|E
5000|$|Lumefantrine (or benflumetol) is an {{antimalarial}} drug. It is {{only used}} {{in combination with}} <b>artemether.</b> The term [...] "co-artemether" [...] is sometimes used to describe this combination. Lumefantrine has a much longer half-life compared to <b>artemether</b> and so is therefore thought to clear any residual parasites that remain after combination treatment.|$|E
50|$|Combination {{treatment}} may prevent morbidity due to schistosomiasis. Praziquantel is most active against adult worms. However, {{it has been}} found that <b>artemether</b> prevents the development of adult worms, thus decreasing egg production in the host. If both praziquantel and <b>artemether</b> can be used together, the entire lifespan of S. japonicum would be covered in the vertebrate host.|$|E
50|$|<b>Artemether</b> is an {{artemisinin}} derivative and {{the mechanism}} of action for artemisinins is unknown.|$|E
50|$|<b>Artemether</b> {{can also}} be used in {{treating}} and preventing trematode infections of schistosomiasis when used in combination with praziquantel.|$|E
5000|$|Zhou {{specifically}} {{worked on}} <b>artemether,</b> {{one of the}} derivatives of artemisinin. In 1985 he combined <b>artemether</b> with another drug lumefantrine into a single tablet, which he successfully used {{for the treatment of}} severe malaria. With the support of Novartis, the drug was produced in 1991 under the brand name Coartem, and it became the first artemisinin-based combination therapy. For this invention he and his team were awarded the European Inventor Award of 2009 in the category [...] "Non-European countries".|$|E
50|$|For children, {{especially}} in the malaria-endemic areas of Africa, artesunate IV or IM, quinine (IV infusion or divided IM injection), and <b>artemether</b> IM are recommended.|$|E
50|$|Plasma <b>artemether</b> {{level was}} found to be lower when the {{combination}} product was used with lopinavir/ritonavir. There is also decreased drug exposure associated with concurrent use with efavirenz or nevirapine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Artemether</b> is metabolized in {{the human}} body to the active metabolite, dihydroartemisinin, {{primarily}} by hepatic enzymes CYP3A4/5. Both the parent drug and active metabolite are eliminated with a half-life of about 2 hours.|$|E
50|$|<b>Artemether</b> {{is rated}} {{category}} C by the FDA based on animal studies where artemisinin derivatives have shown an association with fetal loss and deformity. Some studies, however, {{do not show}} evidence of harm.|$|E
50|$|<b>Artemether</b> {{was more}} {{promising}} for clinical drug than its parent molecule artemisinin. In 1981 the National Steering Committee for Development of Qinghaosu (artemisinin) and its Derivatives authorised Zhou Yiqing, {{who was working}} at the Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology of the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences, to work on <b>artemether.</b> Zhou showed that <b>artemether</b> combined with another antimalarial lumefantrine was the most potent of all antimalarial drugs. He worked alone for four years, and was joined by Ning Dianxi and his team in 1985. They found that in clinical trials the combined tablet had very high cure rate of severe malaria, more than 95%, including in areas where multi-drug resistance is experienced. They applied for patent in 1991, but was granted only in 2002. In 1992 they got it registered as a new drug in China. Noticing this, Novartis signed a pack for mass production. In 1999 Novartis obtained the international licensing rights and gave the brand name Coartem. The drug was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2009.|$|E
50|$|Triclabendazole is {{the drug}} of choice in fasciolosis as it is highly {{effective}} against both mature and immature flukes. <b>Artemether</b> has been demonstrated in vitro to be equally effective. Though slightly less potent, artesunate is also useful in human fasciolosis.|$|E
50|$|Zhou {{was among}} more than 500 Chinese {{scientists}} assigned to investigate {{for a new}} antimalarial medication during the Cultural Revolution. Established by Mao Zedong-led government in 1967, the collaborative research was called Project 523. In 1972 Tu Youyou and her team discovered artemisinin (originally known as qinghaosu). The new compound was demonstrated {{to be an effective}} drug against Plasmodium falciparum. A more stable compound <b>artemether</b> was synthesised from artemisinin. In 1981 the National Chinese Steering Committee for Development of Qinghaosu (artemisinin) and its Derivatives authorised Zhou to work on <b>artemether.</b> Zhou showed that <b>artemether</b> combined with another antimalarial lumefantrine was the most potent of all antimalarial drugs. He worked alone for four years, and was joined by Ning Dianxi and his team in 1985. They found that in clinical trials the combined tablet (artemether/lumefantrine) had very high cure rate of severe malaria, more than 95%, including in areas where multi-drug resistance is experienced. They applied for patent in 1991, but granted only in 2002. In 1992 they got it registered as a new drug. Novartis then noticed the new drug and made a deal for mass production. In 1999 Novartis obtained the international licensing rights and gave the brand name Coartem. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2009.|$|E
50|$|Artemether/lumefantrine, {{sold under}} the trade name Coartem among others, is a {{combination}} of the two medications <b>artemether</b> and lumefantrine. It is used to treat malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum that is not treatable with chloroquine. It is not typically used to prevent malaria. It is taken by mouth.|$|E
50|$|<b>Artemether</b> is a {{medication}} {{used for the}} treatment of malaria. The injectable form is specifically used for severe malaria rather than quinine. It may not be as effective as artesunate. It is given by injection in a muscle. It is also available by mouth in combination with lumefantrine, known as artemether/lumefantrine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Artemether</b> causes {{relatively}} few side effects. An irregular heartbeat may rarely occur. While {{there is evidence}} that use during pregnancy may be harmful in animals models, {{there is no evidence of}} concerns in humans. The World Health Organization therefore recommends it use during pregnancy. It is in the artemisinin class of medication.|$|E

50|$|Dihydroartemisinin (also {{known as}} dihydroqinghaosu, {{artenimol}} or DHA) {{is a drug}} used to treat malaria. Dihydroartemisinin is the active metabolite of all artemisinin compounds (artemisinin, artesunate, <b>artemether,</b> etc.) and is also available as a drug in itself. It is a semi-synthetic derivative of artemisinin and is widely used as an intermediate {{in the preparation of}} other artemisinin-derived antimalarial drugs.|$|E
50|$|Carbamazepine and {{phenobarbital}} {{will cause}} the body to metabolize mianserin faster and may reduce its effects. There is a risk of dangerously low blood pressure if people take mianserin along with diazoxide, hydralazine, or nitroprusside. Mianserin can make antihistamines and antimuscarinics have stronger effects. Mianserin {{should not be taken}} with apraclonidine, brimonidine, sibutramine, or the combination drug of <b>artemether</b> with lumefantrine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Artemether</b> is a {{methyl ether}} {{derivative}} of artemisinin, {{which is a}} peroxide-containing lactone isolated from the antimalarial plant Artemisia annua. It {{is also known as}} dihydroartemisinin methyl ether, but its correct chemical nomenclature is (+)-(3-alpha,5a-beta,6-beta,8a-beta, 9-alpha,12-beta,12aR)-decahydro-10-methoxy-3,6,9-trimethyl-3,12-epoxy-12H-pyrano(4,3-j)-1,2-benzodioxepin.It is a relatively lipophilic and unstable drug, which acts by creating reactive free radicals in addition to affecting the membrane transport system of the plasmodium organism.|$|E
50|$|In January 2009, Novartis and Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) {{launched}} Coartem Dispersible, a artemisinin-based {{combination therapy}} developed specifically {{for children with}} malaria. Coartem Dispersible contains the same ratio of <b>artemether</b> and lumefantrine as Coartem. It works {{as well as other}} formulations. The sweet-tasting Coartem Dispersible tablets disperse quickly in small amounts of water, easing administration and ensuring effective dosing.|$|E
50|$|<b>Artemether</b> {{has been}} studied since at least 1981 and been in medical use since 1987. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most {{effective}} and safe medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale cost in the developing world is between 0.38 and 16.47 USD per vial. The combination form cost between 100 and 200 USD for a course of treatment in the United States.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Novartis filed a new Chinese patent for a {{combination}} treatment with <b>artemether</b> and lumefantrine, providing the first artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) (Coartem) at reduced prices to the World Health Organisation. In 2006, after artemisinin {{had become the}} treatment of choice for malaria, the WHO called for an immediate halt to single-drug artemisinin preparations in favor of combinations of artemisinin with another malaria drug, {{to reduce the risk}} of parasites developing resistance.|$|E
50|$|Dihydroartemisinin (also {{known as}} dihydroqinghaosu, {{artenimol}} or DHA) {{is a drug}} used to treat malaria. Dihydroartemisinin is the active metabolite of all artemisinin compounds (artemisinin, artesunate, <b>artemether,</b> etc.) and is also available as a drug in itself. It is a semi-synthetic derivative of artemisinin and is widely used as an intermediate {{in the preparation of}} other artemisinin-derived antimalarial drugs. It is sold commercially in combination with piperaquine and {{has been shown to be}} equivalent to artemether/lumefantrine.|$|E
50|$|Examples of {{practical}} {{application of the}} use of semisynthesis include in the groundbreaking historic case of the isolation of the antibiotic chlortetracycline, and the semisyntheses of the further novel antibiotics tetracycline, doxycycline, and tigecycline.Further examples of semisynthesis include the early commercial production of anti-cancer agent paclitaxel from 10-deacetylbaccatin isolated from the needles of Taxus baccata (European yew), the preparation of LSD from ergotamine isolated from fungal cultures of ergot, and the semisynthesis of the antimalarial drug <b>artemether</b> from naturally occurring artemisinin. As the field of synthetic chemistry advances, certain transformations become cheaper or easier, and the economics of a semisynthetic route may become less favorable.|$|E
50|$|<b>Artemether</b> is a {{methyl ether}} {{derivative}} of dihydroartemesinin. It {{is similar to}} artemesinin in mode of action but demonstrates a reduced ability as a hypnozoiticidal compound, instead acting more significantly to decrease gametocyte carriage. Similar restrictions are in place, as with artemesinin, to prevent the development of resistance, therefore it is only used in combination therapy for severe acute cases of drug-resistant P. falciparum. It should be administered in a 7 day course with 4 mg/kg given per day for 3 days, followed by 1.6 mg/kg for 3 days. Side effects of the drug are few but include potential neurotoxicity developing if high doses are given.|$|E
50|$|Food, in {{particular}} fat, enhances {{the absorption of}} both <b>artemether</b> and lumefantrine, and patients are advised to take the tablets with food {{as soon as a}} meal can be tolerated. Coartem has a potential to prolong the QT interval, so combinations with other drugs having that property can cause irregular heartbeat, potentially leading to lethal ventricular fibrillation. The combination with halofantrine, another antimalarial, can cause a life-threatening QT prolongation. Drugs and other substances influencing the activity of the liver enzyme CYP3A4, including grapefruit juice, can either increase or lower blood levels of artemether/lumefantrine, depending on the sort of substance. This can either lead to more severe side effects or to reduced efficiency.|$|E
50|$|P. coatneyi, {{unlike many}} other species in the Plasmodium genus, is a cause of {{cerebral}} malaria. The symptoms of this severe form of malaria include impaired consciousness such as a coma, seizures, brain swelling, intracranial hypertension, and other neurological abnormalities. While the exact mechanism for cerebral malaria is not known, {{the most commonly used}} explanation is the sequestration of the protozoan infected erythrocytes in the microvasculature of the brain.Due {{to the fact that it}} is species of Plasmodium which only causes malaria in nonhuman primates, no treatment for this form of malaria has been specifically adapted. However, treatment with subcurative levels of <b>artemether</b> has been shown to reduce symptoms. This used to treat P. falciparum, and is grouped into artemisinin-based combination therapies used most for P. falciparum treatment.|$|E
5000|$|For {{their high}} efficacy, safety and stability, artemisinins such as <b>artemether</b> and {{artesunate}} became the drugs {{of choice in}} falciparum malaria. Their combination drugs are advocated by the World Health Organization, and {{are included in the}} World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Among the scientists of the project, Zhou Yiqing and his team at the Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology of the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences, were awarded the European Inventor Award of 2009 in the category [...] "Non-European countries" [...] for the development of Coartem (artemether-lumefantrine combination drug). Tu Youyou of the Qinghaosu Research Center, Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, received both the 2011 Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award and 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for her role in the discovery of artemisinin.|$|E
50|$|Severe and {{complicated}} malaria {{are almost always}} caused by infection with P. falciparum. The other species usually cause only febrile disease. Severe {{and complicated}} malaria are medical emergencies since mortality rates are high (10% to 50%). Cerebral malaria is the form of severe and complicated malaria with the worst neurological symptoms.Recommended treatment for severe malaria is the intravenous use of antimalarial drugs. For severe malaria, parenteral artesunate was superior to quinine in both children and adults. In another systematic review, artemisinin derivatives (<b>artemether</b> and arteether) were as efficacious as quinine {{in the treatment of}} cerebral malaria in children. Treatment of severe malaria involves supportive measures that are best done in a critical care unit. This includes the management of high fevers and the seizures that may result from it. It also includes monitoring for poor breathing effort, low blood sugar, and low blood potassium.|$|E
