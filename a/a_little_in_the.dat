In one narrative, Vishnu and Bhudevi indulge in {{vigorous}} embraces and as a result, Bhudevi becomes fatigued and faints, sinking <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> primordial ocean. Vishnu again acquires the form of Varaha and rescues her, reinstating her in her original position above the waters. Some scriptures state that Bhudevi gives birth to Varaha's son, an asura called Narakasura.|$|E

500|$|On his {{reliance}} on PayPal donations, Adams {{says he is}} content since he feels that people really like his work or they would not pay. Adams said that donations remain stable except during a new version update, {{where there is a}} sudden increase. Their expenses being low, he has maintained that he is happy as long as the game is self-sustaining and will not charge for it. In 2011, Adams refused a job offer from an unspecified major game developer and a $300,000 deal to license the name Dwarf Fortress from another company. Adams felt that this amount would not equate to long-term donations and that he prefers working on his own—not being part of the gaming industry. Adams said, [...] "Barely in the black one month, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> red another month. ... It's a risk I'm willing to take, and really I couldn't have it any other way." [...] He has spent no money on advertising and was happy when bloggers, reviewers like former game journalist Kieron Gillen from PC Gamer and Games for Windows, wrote about his game. In 2015, Bay 12 Games set up a Patreon account to help fund it.|$|E

2500|$|Horse: A large, {{fierce and}} {{practically}} invulnerable tomcat, {{based on a}} cat that lived on Murray Ball's farm. He is a menace to the Dog and the other characters, resisting attempts to be tamed. He has a girlfriend (Fred, first mentioned in Book 9, first appears in Book 11) who has tattooed ears, lives with a biker gang and loves leather. He occasionally fathers kittens. Horse [...] "spoke" [...] <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> earlier comics, but in later ones he communicated via actions and yowls.

2500|$|It also, {{with the}} help of USAID, created a massive {{industrial}} infrastructure, communications, and developed the educational system. Several government bodies were created and four-year plans were also enacted. Between 1952 and 1982, economic growth was on average 8.7%, and between 1983 and 1986 at 6.9%. The gross national product grew by 360% between 1965 and 1986. The percentage of global exports was over 2% in 1986, over other recently industrialized countries, (like South Korea), and the global industrial production output grew a further 680% between 1965 and 1986. The social gap between {{the rich and the poor}} fell (Gini: 0.558 in 1953, 0.303 in 1980), even lower than some Western European countries, but it grew <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 80's. Health care, education, and [...] quality of life also improved. Much of that was made possible through US economic aid, subsidizing the higher cost of domestic production. The flexibility of the productive system and the industrial structure meant that Taiwanese companies had more chances to adapt themselves to the changing international situation and the global economy.|$|E
2500|$|The film {{performance}} of [...] "Let It Be" [...] {{has never been}} officially released as an audio recording. The lyrics in the two versions differ <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last verse. The studio version has mother Mary comes to me … {{there will be an}} answer, whereas the film version has mother Mary comes to me … there will be no sorrow. In addition, McCartney's vocal performance is noticeably different in both versions: in the film version, it sounds rough in certain moments since he is not using anti-pop on his mic; there are also a couple of falsetto vocals performed by him (extending the vocal 'e' on the word 'be'), for instance in the 'let it be' line that precedes the second chorus. Finally, the instrumental progression featured on the middle of the song after the second chorus (that descends from F to C), which is played twice on all released studio versions, is played (or at least is shown being played) only once in the film.|$|E
