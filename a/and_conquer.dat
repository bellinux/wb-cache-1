5|$|Native American {{populations were}} devastated by {{contagious}} diseases, in particular, smallpox, {{brought to the}} Americas by European colonists. It is unclear how many Native Americans were killed by foreign diseases after the arrival of Columbus in the Americas, but the numbers have been estimated {{to be close to}} 70% of the indigenous population. The damage done by this disease significantly aided European attempts to displace <b>and</b> <b>conquer</b> the native population.|$|E
5|$|The {{empire of}} the Tang Dynasty (June 18, 618 – June 1, 907), {{successor}} of the Sui Dynasty, was a cosmopolitan hegemon that ruled one of China's most expansive empires. Raids by the nomadic Khitans and Turks challenged Tang rule, and Tang rulers responded by pursuing strategies of divide <b>and</b> <b>conquer,</b> proxy warfare, tributes, and marriages.|$|E

5|$|Aronofsky {{realized}} that since writing in 2000 the battle scene between {{the armies of}} Mayans and conquistadors, The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, Troy, King Arthur, and other films had featured massive battle scenes. He felt less inclined to mimic the scale and rewrote the battle to be mainly between Jackman's conquistador character and the Mayans. The director {{realized that}}, with one man against the army, the rewrite was a suitable metaphor for his film's theme of a man defying odds to do the impossible <b>and</b> <b>conquer</b> death.|$|E
5|$|Diệm {{had long}} distrusted his generals and {{frequently}} played them {{against each other}} in a divide <b>and</b> <b>conquer</b> strategy to weaken any chance of a coup attempt. The army also contained substantial numbers of soldiers of Buddhist backgrounds, thus heightening skepticism that they would have attacked the pagodas and monks in such a violent manner. The synchronized military operations throughout the country, the speed at which banners were erected declaring the ARVN resolve to defeat communism, and doctored propaganda photos purporting to show Việt Cộng infiltration of the Buddhists suggested that the actions were long premeditated. In an attempt to maintain secrecy, special printing presses had produced propaganda materials only hours before the raids.|$|E
5|$|In 1533 Pedro de Alvarado ordered de León y Cardona {{to explore}} <b>and</b> <b>conquer</b> {{the area around}} the Tacaná, Tajumulco, Lacandón and San Antonio volcanoes; in colonial times this area was {{referred}} to as the Province of Tecusitlán and Lacandón. De León marched to a Maya city named Quezalli by his Nahuatl-speaking allies with a force of fifty Spaniards; his Mexican allies also referred to the city by the name Sacatepequez. De León renamed the city as San Pedro Sacatepéquez. The Spanish founded a village nearby at Candacuchex in April that year, renaming it as San Marcos.|$|E

5|$|In September 1948 Rijadi was {{promoted}} and given control of four battalions {{of soldiers and}} one of student soldiers. Two months later, the Dutch launched a second attack, this time on the nearby city of Yogyakarta (then serving as the nation's capital). Although Rijadi and his troops launched attacks on Dutch forces approaching Solo through Klaten, ultimately the Dutch soldiers entered the city. Applying a divide <b>and</b> <b>conquer</b> policy, Rijadi was able to drive the forces out in four days.|$|E
5|$|Kraken was a clone {{who shared}} Dredd's DNA. He {{had been created}} by rogue judge Morton Judd {{as part of a}} clone army to {{overthrow}} the judges <b>and</b> <b>conquer</b> Mega-City One (though not to restore democracy). Of the survivors, Kraken alone was spared and was rehabilitated at the Academy of Law, with a view to having him one day replace Dredd when Dredd finally retired or died. Having graduated from the Academy, Kraken was due to take his Final Assessment, the test which cadets take to prove they are fit to become a full judge. Dredd was assigned as Kraken's examiner.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt, both appreciating Willkie's talents, {{and seeking}} to divide <b>and</b> <b>conquer</b> his opposition, had been mulling over ways his former {{opponent}} {{might be of}} use. The president's onetime advisor, Justice Felix Frankfurter, had suggested to Van Doren on New Year's Eve that Willkie should travel across the Atlantic to demonstrate bipartisan support of Britain. Willkie had already been planning a visit in support for Britain. Roosevelt believed that the visit of the nominal head of the opposition party {{would be far more}} effective in demonstrating American support than sending one of his advisors.|$|E

5|$|The ancient Egyptian {{military}} {{was responsible for}} defending Egypt against foreign invasion, and for maintaining Egypt's domination in the ancient Near East. The military protected mining expeditions to the Sinai during the Old Kingdom and fought civil wars during the First and Second Intermediate Periods. The {{military was}} responsible for maintaining fortifications along important trade routes, such as those found at the city of Buhen {{on the way to}} Nubia. Forts also were constructed to serve as military bases, such as the fortress at Sile, which was a base of operations for expeditions to the Levant. In the New Kingdom, a series of pharaohs used the standing Egyptian army to attack <b>and</b> <b>conquer</b> Kush and parts of the Levant.|$|E
5|$|When Picard {{returns to}} the Enterprise, he discovers that {{survivors}} from the Borg sphere have invaded the ship and are beginning to assimilate both the Enterprise and its crew.

Picard and a team attempt to reach engineering to disable the Borg with corrosive coolant used in the warp core. The assault fails and Data is captured; he meets the Queen of the Borg Collective, who attempts to turn him to her side. A frightened Sloane ambushes the captain, but he soon gains her trust and they escape the Borg-infested area of the ship by using the holodeck to create a weapon.|$|E
5|$|Command & Conquer {{requires}} the player {{to construct a}} base and to gather resources in order to fund the production of buildings, technologies, and combat units to attack <b>and</b> <b>conquer</b> an opponent's base. The game contains two playable factions: the Global Defense Initiative (GDI) and the Brotherhood of Nod. GDI units are sturdy and powerful, but expensive. Meanwhile, Nod armies {{are made up of}} a mix of cheap and numerous units, mixed in with unusual units such as rocket bikes and stealth tanks. As a result, GDI focuses on large-scale strategic attacks, while Nod creates bigger armies and uses unconventional tactics. There are roughly fifty units and structures in total. Tiberium, the game's sole resource, is gathered by harvester units that carry it to a refinery structure for processing. When the player constructs buildings, additional units and structures become available for purchase. Command & Conquer features two single-player campaigns, one each for the GDI and Nod factions. The objective of most campaign missions is to destroy or take control of enemy buildings. The missions begin with live-action full motion video (FMV) cutscenes.|$|E

5|$|Following the Battle of B-R5RB, Pandemic Legion {{withdrew from}} the Southeast theater and formed an {{agreement}} with the CFC which allowed them to evacuate billions of assets from the B-R5RB system. Other N3 forces retreated in from the south, and in the following few days CFC alliances managed to capture a total of twenty three systems in the regions Immensea, Catch, Tenerifis, and Feythabolis from N3/Pandemic Legion alliances. The CFC then {{withdrew from the}} southeast theater. In the weeks after, the Russian bloc suffered internal troubles, allowing N3 to regain all of the territory lost after B-R5RB <b>and</b> <b>conquer</b> most of the Russian bloc's territory. In the longer term, B-R5RB established CFC, later re-branded as The Imperium, as the predominant superpower in Eve Online, with little serious resistance challenging the coalition for the next two years.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, he led his own {{faction of}} the sect after its various {{military}} leaders pursued their own policies towards the French and Hồ Chí Minh's Việt Minh {{in the wake of}} Sổ's death. At the time, France was in a ruinous financial state following World War II and was experiencing great difficulty in its attempts to re-establish control over its colonies. Ba Cụt had only 1,000 men in five battalions at the time, fewer than 5% of Hòa Hảo forces, whereas Trần Văn Soái had 15,000 men. The French tried to maintain their hold with a divide <b>and</b> <b>conquer</b> strategy towards the Hòa Hảo. They coaxed Soái into joining with them and recognised him {{as the leader of the}} Hòa Hảo. In 1948, Ba Cụt rallied to the French and Soái, but broke away again soon after, relocating to Đồng Tháp Province and resuming his military activities against the French.|$|E

In Britain, General Brigham, head of the UDF, commands Major William Cage, a public affairs officer with no combat experience, to cover a massive assault on France. Cage objects and threatens to put the blame on Brigham should the invasion result in failure - as a result, Cage is tasered and arrested for disobeying orders, and transported to Heathrow Airport, turned into a military base.

5|$|In the First Phase, the Cadet {{is saved}} from a Behemoth attack by Ace, who brings {{them to the}} safety of Akademeia. There they are {{introduced}} to everyday life and sent out on a mission against the Behemoth. Then war is declared against Milites after its aggressive actions against Rubrum and Lorica, and the Cadet learns of Class Zero. Concordia forms an alliance with Milites, severely hampering Rubrum's efforts. Rubrum then musters their forces, including their powerful magical warriors, <b>and</b> <b>conquer</b> all three Crystal States. In the final chapter, Rubrum's victory over the other Crystal States causes the arrival of Tempus Finis, and Miyu is made into a l'Cie and renamed Judge Myuria: her mission is to test the Cadet to see if they are worthy of becoming the Agito. The Cadet is victorious, but it is judged the Agito has not appeared and Tempus Finis consumes the world, resetting it for a new cycle of history.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} years, much of Hereford's {{focus was on}} reconquering his lost lands in the Marches, {{primarily}} through private warfare against Llywelyn. Henry III died in 1272, while his sonnow Edward Iwas crusading; Edward did not return until 1274. Llywelyn refused {{to pay homage to}} the new king, partly because of the military actions of Bohun and other Marcher lords, which Llywelyn saw as violations of the Treaty of Montgomery. On 12 November 1276, Hereford was present at a royal assembly where judgment was passed on Llewelyn, and in 1277, Edward I declared war on the Welsh prince. Rebellion in his own Brecon lands delayed Hereford's participation {{in the early days of}} the Welsh war. He managed, however, to both suppress the rebellion, <b>and</b> <b>conquer</b> lands further west. He then joined up with the royal army and served for a while in Anglesey, before returning to Brecon, where he received the surrender of certain Welsh lords. After the campaign was over, on 2 January 1278, he received protection from King Edward to go on pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela in Spain.|$|E
5|$|Service design {{management}} {{deals with the}} newly emerging field of service design. It is the activity of planning and organizing people, infrastructure, communication, and material components of a service. The aim {{is to improve the}} quality of the service, the interaction between the service provider and its customers, and the customer's experience. The increasing importance and size of the service sector in terms of people employed and economic importance requires that services should be well-designed in order to remain competitive and to continue to attract customers. Design management traditionally focuses in the design and development of manufactured products; service design managers can apply many of the same theoretical and methodological approaches. Systematic and strategic management of service design helps the business gain competitive advantages <b>and</b> <b>conquer</b> new markets. Companies that proactively identify the interests of their customers and use this information to develop services that create good experiences for the customer will open up new and profitable business opportunities.|$|E
