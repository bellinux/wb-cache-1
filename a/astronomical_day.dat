The mean Burmese <b>astronomical</b> <b>day</b> is from midnight to midnight, and represents 1/30th of a synodic month or 23 hours, 37 minutes and 28.08 seconds. The civil day comprises two halves, the first half beginning at sunrise and the second half at sunset. In practice, four points of the astronomical and civil day (sunrise, noon, sunset, and midnight) were used as reference points. The civil day is divided into 8 baho ( [...] ) (3 hours) or 60 nayi ( [...] ) (24 minutes), each baho equalling 7.5 nayi. In the past, a gong ( [...] ) was struck every nayi while a drum ( [...] ) and a large bell ( [...] ) were struck to mark every baho.|$|E
6000|$|As is well known, the {{fundamental}} {{law of the}} mechanics of Galilei-Newton, which {{is known as the}} law of inertia, can be stated thus: A body removed sufficiently far from other bodies continues in a state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line. This law not only says something about the motion of the bodies, but it also indicates the reference-bodies or systems of coordinates, permissible in mechanics, which can be used in mechanical description. The visible fixed stars are bodies for which the law of inertia certainly holds to a high degree of approximation. Now if we use a system of co-ordinates which is rigidly attached to the earth, then, relative to this system, every fixed star describes a circle of immense radius in the course of an <b>astronomical</b> <b>day,</b> a result which is opposed to the statement of the law of inertia. So that if we adhere to this law we must refer these motions only to systems of coordinates relative to which the fixed stars do not move in a circle. A system of co-ordinates of which the state of motion is such that the law of inertia holds relative to it is called a [...] " [...] Galileian system of co-ordinates." [...] The laws of the mechanics of Galflei-Newton can be regarded as valid only for a Galileian system of co-ordinates.|$|E

5000|$|Up to late 1805 the Royal Navy used three days: {{nautical}}, civil (or [...] "natural"), and astronomical. A nautical day {{entered in}} a ship's log as 10 July, for example, in fact commenced {{at noon on}} 9 July civil reckoning, PM therefore coming before AM. The <b>astronomical</b> <b>day</b> of 10 July, on the other hand, commenced at noon of 10 July civil reckoning, and ended at noon on 11 July. The <b>astronomical</b> <b>day</b> was brought into use following {{the introduction of the}} Nautical Almanac in 1767, and the British Admiralty issued an order ending the use of the nautical day on 11 October 1805.

50|$|In 1935, {{the term}} Universal Time was {{recommended}} by the International Astronomical Union as a more precise term than Greenwich Mean Time, because GMT could refer to either an <b>astronomical</b> <b>day</b> starting at noon or a civil day starting at midnight.

50|$|Julian days {{begin at}} noon because when Herschel {{recommended}} them, the <b>astronomical</b> <b>day</b> began at noon. The <b>astronomical</b> <b>day</b> had begun at noon ever since Ptolemy chose {{to begin the}} days in his astronomical periods at noon. He chose noon because the transit of the Sun across the observer's meridian occurs at the same apparent time {{every day of the}} year, unlike sunrise or sunset, which vary by several hours. Midnight was not even considered because it could not be accurately determined using water clocks. Nevertheless, he double-dated most nighttime observations with both Egyptian days beginning at sunrise and Babylonian days beginning at sunset. This would seem to imply that his choice of noon was not, as is sometimes stated, made in order to allow all observations from a given night to be recorded with the same date. When this practice ended in 1925, it was decided to keep Julian days continuous with previous practice.|$|E

30|$|The {{values for}} the Sq {{variations}} were obtained by subtracting from the observatory hourly means, a trend determined by the two local midnight levels {{on each side of}} the quiet day. The local midnight level was computed as a four-hourly mean centred on local midnight. The study was carried out on a monthly basis, based on monthly averages using the five International Quiet Days of each month. This selection was chosen for simplicity and could certainly be improved, as it is well-known (Campbell, 1979; Torta et al., 1997; Janzhura and Troshichev, 2008) that special attention has to be paid to the selection of the representative quiet days for the definition of the genuine Sq variation. Furthermore, the magnetic quiescence is defined for <b>astronomical</b> <b>days</b> (0 – 24 UT), which do not necessarily coincide with the LT days at the given observatories, which are located between 43 ° and 65 ° west of the Greenwich meridian. However, stricter selections frequently give rise to months with very few representative days left, or even none at all (Torta et al., 1997). In addition to the scarcity of observatories, observatory data are not complete, and some important gaps are detected from time to time, so those better selections would have precluded obtaining representative results for the whole seasonal and solar cycle spans.|$|R
5000|$|In the 19th century, an idea {{circulated}} {{to make a}} {{decimal fraction}} ( [...] or [...] ) of an <b>astronomical</b> <b>day</b> the base unit of time. This was an afterglow of the short-lived movement toward a decimalisation of timekeeping and the calendar, which had been given up already due to its difficulty in transitioning from traditional, more familiar units. The most successful alternative is the centiday, equal to 14.4 minutes (864 seconds), being not only a shorter multiple of an hour (0.24 vs 2.4) but also closer to the SI multiple kilosecond (1 000 seconds) and equal to the traditional Chinese unit, ke.|$|E

However, the chamber is preserved in its original position.

5000|$|The {{development}} {{of what is}} now known as UTC time came about historically as an effort which first began as a collaboration between 41 nations, officially agreed to and signed at the International Meridian Conference, in Washington D.C. in 1884. At this conference, the local mean solar time at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich in England was chosen to define the [...] "universal day", counted from 0 hours at Greenwich mean midnight. This agreed with the civil Greenwich Mean Time used on the island of Great Britain since 1847. In contrast astronomical GMT began at mean noon, i.e. <b>astronomical</b> <b>day</b> X began at noon of civil day X. The purpose of this was to keep one night's observations under one date. The civil system was adopted as of 0 hours (civil) 1 January 1925. Nautical GMT began 24 hours before astronomical GMT, at least until 1805 in the Royal Navy, but persisted much later elsewhere because it was mentioned at the 1884 conference. In 1884, the Greenwich meridian was used for two - thirds of all charts and maps as their Prime Meridian.|$|E
5000|$|Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) was {{originally}} mean time deduced from meridian observations {{made at the}} Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO). The principal meridian of that observatory was chosen in 1884 by the International Meridian Conference to be the Prime Meridian. GMT either by that name or as 'mean time at Greenwich' {{used to be an}} international time standard, but is no longer so; it was initially renamed in 1928 as Universal Time (UT) (partly as a result of ambiguities arising from the changed practice of starting the <b>astronomical</b> <b>day</b> at midnight instead of at noon, adopted as from 1 January 1925). The more current refined version of UT, UT1, is still in reality mean time at Greenwich. Greenwich Mean Time is still the legal time in the UK (in winter, and as adjusted by one hour for summer time). But Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) (an atomic-based time scale which is always kept within 0.9 second of UT1) is in common actual use in the UK, and the name GMT is often inaccurately used to refer to it.
