500|$|In 2007, Edwards {{was part}} of a panel that {{appeared}} on CNN's Paula Zahn Now, along with Roland S. Martin and Jesse Lee Peterson. The purpose was to discuss racial segregation in American cities. He told Zahn that white children should seek out those who share [...] "the same values and traditions and heroes," [...] and that [...] "forced integration" [...] was a [...] "march toward totalitarianism." [...] He said: [...] "Crime and violence follow African-Americans wherever they go, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that is racist, then spend some time on the mean streets of south Memphis." [...] Martin described his remarks as unfit for national television. Edwards made a second appearance on Paula Zahn Now in 2009, during which he said: [...] "Whites are in for the fight of their lives. America is becoming balkanized. We are being robbed of having a future in the very nation our ancestors carved from the wilderness." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dayton ran unsuccessfully in the U.S. Senate {{campaign}} in 1982 against Republican Party incumbent David Durenberger. He defeated former U.S. Senator Eugene McCarthy in the Democratic primary, {{and the general}} election {{became one of the}} most expensive in state history. Dayton campaigned as a populist in opposition to Reaganomics and famously promised [...] "to close tax loopholes for the rich and the corporations [...] <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that includes the Daytons, you're right". After his defeat, Dayton returned to the Perpich administration until his election as Minnesota State Auditor in 1990.|$|E
2500|$|Comic Book Resources ranks Victor von Doom {{as their}} fourth {{favorite}} Marvel character. Journalist Brent Ecenbarger cited him {{being able to}} [...] "stand up against entities like Mephisto, the Beyonder, and Galactus and often comes out on top", {{as well as the}} tragedy of any [...] "other number of circumstances could have led to Doctor Doom being a savior, but as it is, instead he remains Marvelâ€™s greatest villain.", a fact that later led to the character's redemption. Fellow journalist Jason Stanhope called his [...] "master of sorcery and technology an unusual combination", and also felt [...] "his inner sense of nobility sets him apart from lesser villains, in a similar manner to Magneto." [...] Von Doom has also been favorably regarded by those who wrote for the character; Stan Lee declared Doom his favorite villain, saying that Doom [...] "could come to the United States and he could do almost anything, and we could not arrest him because he has diplomatic immunity. Also, he wants to rule the world <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about it, wanting to rule the world is not a crime.", that Doom technically isn't a villain. Mark Waid echoed Lee's assessment of the character, stating that Doom [...] " [...] got a great look, a great visual design [...] a dynamite origin." ...|$|E
