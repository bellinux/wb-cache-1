By combining optimality and functional response theories, we show analytically how the optimal movement rate varies with the <b>average</b> resource level (<b>enrichment)</b> and resource distribution (patch heterogeneity).

An intermediate resource level thus maximises movement for type-III responses. Counterintuitively, greater movement costs favour an increase in movement. In heterogeneous habitats predictions further depend on how enrichment alters the variance of resource distribution. Greater patch variance always increases the optimal rate of movement, except for type-IV functional responses.

Isotope enrichment in consumers takes place during the assimilation of carbon and nitrogen from the diet. A review of the literature indicates that the <b>average</b> isotope <b>enrichment</b> during each trophic transfer is 0.5 ‰ for δ 13 C and 3.4 ‰ for δ 15 N, but with large variations in both stable isotopes (Post 2002). These data are largely derived from field studies with many unknown and uncontrolled factors such as food sources (Gu et al. 1996 a, b; Post 2002) and differences in growth rate, age, and food quality, which may affect the magnitude of isotope fractionation. Muscle tissue of fish has been widely used to represent the whole fish isotope characteristic. However, previous and current studies also indicate wide variations in isotope composition among consumer tissues (DeNiro and Epstein 1978, 1981; Tieszen et al. 1983; Pinnegar and Polunin 1999; Miller 2006).

Misloaded fuel assemblies are due to inadequate spent fuel management, such as poor record keeping of important data of the spent fuel such as {{the exact location of}} each {{fuel assembly}} in the spent fuel pool, the cooling period and burnup. These data are essential for deciding whether fuel assemblies will be acceptable for cask loading or not. The cask under study is CASTOR X/ 28 F which is designed for fuel assemblies with a 10 -year cooling period and the <b>average</b> <b>enrichment</b> of 3. 25 wt%. This paper examines the effect of enrichment, burnup, and location, of misplaced fuel assemblies on neutron multiplication factor...|$|E
30|$|Various {{factors have}} been {{proposed}} {{to account for the}} differences in δ 13 C and δ 15 N values between animal tissues and their diet. Earlier studies showed that different individuals of a species differ in isotope fractionation when fed the same diet, but that isotope fractionation differs more between species than among individuals of the same species (DeNiro and Epstein 1978, 1981). Our results also showed differing isotope enrichments or depletions compared with the dietary δ 13 C. However, in general, the δ 13 C enrichment of the juvenile groupers was less than 2 ‰. The muscle tissue of the juvenile groupers was enriched by 0.5 ‰, nearly identical to the reported <b>average</b> <b>enrichment</b> (Post 2002). These results suggest that muscle tissue is the most consistent proxy for carbon isotope fractionation when compared to the findings of many previous studies on fish (Hesslein et al. 1993; Pinnegar and Polunin 1999).|$|E

40|$|The first {{long-term}} concurrent {{measurements of}} trichloroacetic acid (TCA) in rainwater, in cloudwater, and in air (both gas and particle phase) are reported. Measurements were made weekly between June 1998 and April 2000 at a rural forested upland site in SE Scotland. Rainwater TCA concentration {{did not differ}} significantly between two elevations (602 and 275 m asl), with precipitation-weighted mean values of 0. 77 and 0. 70 mu g L- 1, respectively (n> 75). The precipitation-weighted mean concentration of TCA in cloudwater at the highest elevation was 0. 92 mu g L- 1, yielding an <b>average</b> cloudwater <b>enrichment</b> factor of 1. 2, considerably lower than for other inorganic ions measured. Rainwater and cloudwater TCA concentrations did not vary systematically with season. Since wet precipitation depth also did not vary systematically with season, the wet deposition fluxes of TCA were likewise invariant (annual fluxes at the highest elevation of 880 and 130 mu g m- 2, respectively, for rain and cloud interception to spruce forest). Weekly integrated concentrations of TCA in air (gas and particle) were very low (median 25 pgm- 3, range<LOD- 110 pg m- 3). The estimated upper limit for annual dry deposition of TCA at this site was 20 mu g m- 2, assuming a deposition velocity of 2 cm s- 1. Concentrations of TCA in air correlated reasonably strongly with concentrations in rainwater, with a partition ratio approximately equal to the Henry’s law coefficient. On average, only about 23...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis study {{presents}} {{trace elements}} levels in surface and deep sediments of the Toulon bay (SE France) subjected to anthropogenic inputs (navy base, harbors, etc.). The studied elements (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, Zn) {{are defined as}} priority contaminants in aquatic systems. Fifty-five points scattered on the entire bay were sampled, allowing the determination of contaminants distribution with a high resolution. Several approaches {{were used to assess}} the degree of contamination and the potential toxicity of the Toulon bay sediments: comparison to the French legislation, surface-weighted <b>average</b> metal concentrations, <b>enrichment</b> factors (EF), geoaccumulation indices (Igeo), trace element stock calculation and comparison to sediment quality guidelines. A principal component analysis was performed to reveal common behavior of the studied contaminants. Results demonstrated the very high contamination of the small bay, especially in Hg (EF up to 1500), Cu, Pb and Zn, with export to the large bay further governed by hydrodynamics...|$|R
40|$|We herein {{present a}} novel modular inlet system {{designed}} to be coupled to low-pressure gas analyzers for online chemical characterization of semi-volatile submicron particles. The "chemical analysis of aerosol online" (CHARON) inlet consists of a gas-phase denuder for stripping off gas-phase analytes, an aerodynamic lens for particle collimation combined with an inertial sampler for the particle-enriched flow and a thermodesorption unit for particle volatilization prior to chemical analysis. The denuder was measured to remove gas-phase organics with an efficiency > 99. 999 % and to transmit particles in the 100 – 750 nm size range with a 75 – 90 % efficiency. The measured <b>average</b> particle <b>enrichment</b> factor in the subsampling flow from the aerodynamic lens was 25. 6, which is a factor of 3 lower than the calculated theoretical optimum. We coupled the CHARON inlet to a proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-ToF-MS) which quantitatively detects most organic analytes and ammonia. The combined CHARON-PTR-ToF-MS setup is thus capable of measuring both the organic and the ammonium fraction in submicron particles in real time. Individual organic compounds can be detected down to levels of 10 – 20 ng m − 3. Two proof-of-principle {{studies were carried out}} for demonstrating the analytical power of this new instrumental setup: (i) oxygenated organics and their partitioning between the gas and the particulate phase were observed from the reaction of limonene with ozone and (ii) nicotine was measured in cigarette smoke particles demonstrating that selected organic target compounds can be detected in submicron particles in real time...|$|R
