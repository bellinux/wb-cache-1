5|$|Before {{the treaty}} was signed, German {{soldiers}} had already entered {{the port of}} Klaipėda. Adolf Hitler, on board the cruiser Deutschland, personally toured the city <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> short speech. The armada sailing to Klaipėda included the cruiser Admiral Graf Spee, the light cruisers Nürnberg, Leipzig, and Köln, two destroyer squadrons, three torpedo boat flotillas, and one tender flotilla. At the time the Lithuanian navy had only one warship, the Prezidentas Smetona, a 580-ton converted minesweeper. While the Germans were celebrating {{the return of the}} city, European politicians expressed fears that the Free City of Danzig would be Hitler's next target.|$|E
5|$|Comparatively, machinimists using pre-made virtual {{platforms}} like Second Life {{have indicated}} that their productions can be made quite successfully with no cost at all. Creators like Dutch director Chantal Harvey, producer of the 48 Hour Film Project Machinima sector, have created upwards of 200 films using the platform. Harvey's advocacy of the genre {{has resulted in the}} involvement of film director Peter Greenaway who served as a juror for the Machinima category <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> keynote speech during the event.|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} a facility location problem with submodular facility cost functions, <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>an</b> O(log n) approximation algorithm for it.

The hierarchical facility costs model multilevel service installation. Shmoys, Swamy <b>and</b> Levi [18] <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> constant factor approximation algorithm for a two-level version of the problem.

5|$|F. Lee Bowling {{was elected}} Grand President of the {{fraternity}} in 1941 and presented {{a plan to}} hold a national intercollegiate band concert, modeled after the Rocky Mountain intercollegiate bands. The plan was endorsed by the delegation to be executed at the next national convention in 1943. However, due to World War II, the 1943 and 1945 national conventions were not held, and so the first National Intercollegiate Band was formed <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> concert {{on the evening of}} Friday, March 7, 1947. Today, participation in the National Intercollegiate Band is open to any college band member who auditions—membership in Kappa Kappa Psi or Tau Beta Sigma is not required.|$|E
5|$|In 1811, {{when the}} Parisian saltpetre {{manufacturer}} Bernard Courtois made iodine {{for the first}} time from the kelp ash, his discovery was greeted with great interest by experts. Accum was among the first chemists in England to undertake experiments to isolate iodine. In two articles published in Tilloch's Philosophical Journal in January and February 1814, Accum described the iodine content of different kinds of seaweed <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> detailed account of a process for iodine production.|$|E

5|$|In 1934, Spedding {{was awarded}} a Guggenheim Fellowship, {{allowing}} him to study in Europe. To save money, Spedding and his wife travelled to Europe by heading westward across the Pacific. His intention was to study in Germany under James Franck and Francis Simon, but they fled Germany after Adolf Hitler {{came to power in}} March 1933. Instead he went to the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge in England, where he was welcomed by Ralph H. Fowler. Spedding worked with John Lennard-Jones, and attended lectures given by Max Born. He paid a visit to Niels Bohr in Copenhagen, <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> lecture in Leningrad.|$|E
5|$|In 1956 Mikoyan helped Khrushchev {{organize}} the Secret Speech, which Khrushchev {{delivered to the}} 20th Party Congress, that denounced Stalin's personality cult. It was he, and not Khrushchev, who made the first anti-Stalinist speech at the 20th Congress. Along with Khrushchev, he helped roll {{back some of the}} stifling restrictions on nationalism and culture imposed during Stalin's time. In 1954, he visited his native Armenia <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> speech in Yerevan, where he encouraged Armenians to republish the works of Raffi and the purged writer Yeghishe Charents.|$|E
5|$|New York was {{key to the}} election; a Lincoln loss {{there would}} {{deadlock}} the Electoral College. Soon after his return from his Midwest tour, Seward embarked on another, speaking to large crowds across the state of New York. At Weed's urging he went to New York City <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> patriotic speech before a large crowd on November 3, only {{three days before the}} election. On Election Day, Lincoln carried most Northern states, while Breckinridge took the Deep South, Bell three border states, and Douglas won Missouri—the only state Seward campaigned in that Lincoln did not win. Lincoln was elected.|$|E

5|$|The {{elections}} were held on 30October. The Alfonsín–Martínez ticket won with 51.7% of the vote, followed by Luder–Bittel with 40.1%. It {{was the first}} time since the rise of Perón that the Peronist party was defeated in elections without electoral fraud or proscription. The UCR won 128 seats in the Assembly, forming a majority; and 18 seats in the Senate, constituting a minority. 18 provinces elected radical governors, and 17 elected governors from either the Justicialist or local parties. Alfonsín took office on 10December, <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> speech from the Buenos Aires Cabildo.|$|E
5|$|The {{first true}} {{national}} census with exhaustive and broad coverage {{was carried out}} in 1872. The small number of people and small number of towns reported by the census reveal Brazil's enormous territory to have been sparsely populated. It showed Brazil as having a total population of 9,930,478 inhabitants. Estimates made by the government in prior decades showed 4,000,000 inhabitants in 1823 <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> figure of 7,000,700 in 1854. The population was distributed across 20 provinces and the Neutral Municipality (the Empire's capital) with 641 municipalities.|$|E

5|$|Against his wishes, Jabara {{received}} a stateside leave for a publicity tour. The Jabara family {{grocery store in}} Wichita was thronged with people for days, and both {{he and his father}} John appeared on local and national radio and television. Wichita mounted one of its most-attended parades in the city's history. Jabara was even sent on a goodwill tour with his father through the Middle East, <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> speech in his father's hometown of Marjayoun, Lebanon. Film newsreels included footage of his aircraft and other accolades included his own song ("That Jabara Bird") and a ritual rewarding of his Distinguished Service Cross at a Boston baseball game. Jabara returned to the United States in May 1951 for temporary assignment to Air Force Headquarters, Washington, D.C. Two months later he was transferred to the Air Training Command at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois. Upon his request, he returned for another tour of duty overseas, arriving in Korea in January 1953.|$|E

5|$|Fearing Castro was a socialist, the U.S. {{instructed}} Cantillo to oust Batista. Cantillo secretly {{agreed to}} a ceasefire with Castro, promising that Batista would be tried as a war criminal; however, Batista was warned, and fled into exile with over US$300,000,000 on December 31, 1958. Cantillo entered Havana's Presidential Palace, proclaimed the Supreme Court judge Carlos Piedra to be President, and began appointing the new government. Furious, Castro ended the ceasefire, and ordered Cantillo's arrest by sympathetic figures in the army. Accompanying celebrations at news of Batista's downfall on January 1, 1959, Castro ordered the MR-26-7 to prevent widespread looting and vandalism. Cienfuegos and Guevara led their columns into Havana on January 2, while Castro entered Santiago <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> speech invoking the wars of independence. Heading toward Havana, he greeted cheering crowds at every town, giving press conferences and interviews.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, the Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) {{was held}} in Havana, where Castro was {{selected}} as NAM president, a position he held till 1982. In his capacity as both President of the NAM and of Cuba he appeared at the United Nations General Assembly in October 1979 <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> speech on the disparity between the world's rich and poor. His speech was greeted with much applause from other world leaders, though his standing in NAM was damaged by Cuba's abstinence from the U.N.'s General Assembly condemnation of the Soviet war in Afghanistan. Cuba's relations across North America improved under Mexican President Luis Echeverría, Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, and U.S. President Jimmy Carter. Carter continued criticizing Cuba's human rights abuses, but adopted a respectful approach which gained Castro's attention. Considering Carter well-meaning and sincere, Castro freed certain political prisoners and allowed some Cuban exiles to visit relatives on the island, hoping that in turn Carter would abolish the economic embargo and stop CIA support for militant dissidents. Conversely, his relationship with China declined, as he accused Deng Xiaoping's Chinese government of betraying their revolutionary principles by initiating trade links with the U.S. and attacking Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|In England, ruined medieval castles became fashionable {{again in}} the middle of the 18th century. They were {{considered}} an interesting counterpoint to Palladian classical architecture, <b>and</b> <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> degree of medieval allure to their owners. Some keeps were modified to exaggerate this effect: Hawarden, for example, was remodelled to appear taller but also more decayed, the better to produce a good silhouette. The interest continued and, in the late 18th and 19th century, it became fashionable to build intact, replica castles in England, resulting in what A. Rowan has called the Norman style of new castle building, characterised by the inclusion of large keeps; the final replica keep to be built in this way was at Penrhyn between 1820 and 1840.|$|E
