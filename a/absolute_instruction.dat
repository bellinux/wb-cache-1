5000|$|A two-byte {{instruction}} specialized {{for program}} looping {{is new to}} the Z80. DJNZ (Decrement Jump if Non-Zero) takes a signed 8-bit displacement as an immediate operand. The B register is decremented. If the result is nonzero then program execution jumps relative to {{the address of the}} PC plus the displacement. The flags remain unaltered. To perform an equivalent loop on an 8080 would require separate decrement and jump (to a two-byte <b>absolute</b> address) <b>instructions,</b> and the flag register would be altered.|$|R
50|$|SAD is an {{extremely}} fast metric due to its simplicity; it is effectively the simplest possible metric {{that takes into account}} every pixel in a block. Therefore it is very effective for a wide motion search of many different blocks. SAD is also easily parallelizable since it analyzes each pixel separately, making it easily implementable with such instructions as ARM NEON or x86 SSE2. For example, SSE has packed sum of <b>absolute</b> differences <b>instruction</b> (PSADBW) specifically for this purpose. Once candidate blocks are found, the final refinement of the motion estimation process is often done with other slower but more accurate metrics, which better take into account human perception. These include the sum of absolute transformed differences (SATD), the sum of squared differences (SSD), and rate-distortion optimization.|$|R
50|$|While {{embedded}} instruction sets such as Thumb {{suffer from}} extremely high register pressure {{because they have}} small register sets, general-purpose RISC ISAs like MIPS and Alpha enjoy low register pressure. CISC ISAs like x86-64 offer low register pressure despite having smaller register sets. This {{is due to the}} many addressing modes and optimizations (such as sub-register addressing, memory operands in ALU <b>instructions,</b> <b>absolute</b> addressing, PC-relative addressing, and register-to-register spills) that CISC ISAs offer.|$|R
40|$|Prospective {{memory is}} the ability to {{remember}} an intention at an appropriate moment in the future. Prospective memory tasks can be more or less important. Previously, importance was manipulated by emphasizing the importance of the prospective memory task relative to the ongoing task it was embedded in. This resulted in better prospective memory performance but also ongoing task costs. In the present study, we simply instructed one group of participants that the prospective memory task was important (i. e., <b>absolute</b> importance <b>instruction)</b> and compared them to a group with relative importance instructions and a control group. The results showed that absolute importance lead to an increase in prospective memory performance without enhancing ongoing task costs, whereas relative importance resulted in both increased prospective memory performance and ongoing task costs. Thus, prospective memory can be enhanced without ongoing task costs, which is particularly crucial for safety-work contexts...|$|R
5000|$|All 160 systems had a paper-tape reader, and a punch, {{and most}} had an IBM Electric {{typewriter}} modified {{to act as}} a computer terminal. [...] Memory on the 160 was 4096 12-bit words. The instruction set was small and RISC-like. The CPU had a 12-bit ones' complement accumulator but no multiply or divide. There was a full complement of instructions and several addressing modes. Indirect addressing was almost as good as index registers. The instruction set supported both relative (to the current P register) and <b>absolute.</b> The original <b>instruction</b> set did not have a subroutine call instruction and could only address one bank of memory.|$|R
40|$|Does second {{language}} instruction promote {{second language}} acquisition? Some studies conclude that instruction {{does not help}} (or even that it is counter-productive); others find it beneficial. The picture becomes clearer if two distinctions are made. First, researchers may address {{one or both of}} two issues: the <b>absolute</b> effect of <b>instruction,</b> on the one hand, and on the other, its relacive utility. Second, studies need to be sub-classified according {{to whether or not the}} comparisons they make involve controlling for the total amount of instruction, exposure, or instruction plus exposure, i. e. for the total opportunity to acquire the second language. Observing these distinctions, a review of research findings concludes that there is considerable (although not overwhelming) evidence that instruction is beneficiaL (1) for children as well as adults, (2) for beginning, intermediate and advanced students, (3) on integrative as well as discrete-point tests, and (4) in acquisition-rich as well as acquisition-poor environments. These findings have implications for theories of second language acquisition, such as Krashen's Monitor Theory, which make predictions about second language acquisition with and without instruction, and also for those involved in educational administrationl program design and classroom teaching...|$|R
5000|$|Uniquely, the {{object-oriented}} paradigm involves {{dynamic memory}} allocation from heap storage for both object creation and message passing. A 1994 benchmark - [...] "Memory Allocation Costs in Large C and C++ Programs" [...] conducted by Digital Equipment Corporation {{on a variety}} of software, using an instruction-level profiling tool, measured how many instructions were required per dynamic storage allocation. The results showed that the lowest <b>absolute</b> number of <b>instructions</b> executed averaged around 50 but others reached as high as 611. See also [...] "Heap:Pleasures and pains" [...] by Murali R. Krishnan that states [...] "Heap implementations tend to stay general for all platforms, and hence have heavy overhead". The 1996 IBM paper [...] "Scalability of Dynamic Storage Allocation Algorithms" [...] by Arun Iyengar of IBM [...] demonstrates various dynamic storage algorithms and their respective instruction counts. Even the recommended MFLF I algorithm (H.S. Stone, RC 9674) shows instruction counts in a range between 200 and 400. The above pseudocode example does not include a realistic estimate of this memory allocation pathlength or the memory prefix overheads involved and the subsequent associated garbage collection overheads. Suggesting strongly that heap allocation is a nontrivial task, one open-source software microallocator, by game developer John W. Ratcliff, consists of nearly 1,000 lines of code.|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the percent of California's third grade public school children lacking sealants by child and family factors and to measure social disparities for lacking sealants. The study analyzed data from the California Oral Health Needs Assessment (COHNA) 2004 - 2005, a complex stratified cluster sample of children (n = 10, 450) from 182 randomly selected public elementary schools in California. The dependent variable was absence of sealants in first permanent molars. The independent variables included child race/ethnicity; socio-economic position (SEP) measured as child's participation in the free or reduced-price lunch program at the individual and school level; acculturation measured as language spoken at home and school level percent of English language learners; and parent functional health literacy measured as correctly following questionnaire <b>instructions.</b> <b>Absolute</b> differences and health disparity indices (i. e. Slope Index of Inequality, Relative Index of Inequality-mean, Absolute Concentration Index) were used to measure absolute and relative disparities. The percent of children lacking sealants was high in all racial/ethnic groups; no child or school level SEP differences in lacking sealants were seen, but significant differences existed by acculturation (child and school level) and parental functional health literacy. NonEnglish language and poor parental functional health literacy are potential barriers {{that need to be}} addressed to overcome disparities in sealant utilization. Gloria C. Mejia, Jane A.
