25|$|Scott's planning, {{equipment}} and rations had {{been based on}} three sledge teams of four men ascending the Beardmore, with a team turning back every 10 days or so as rations required finally leaving one four-man team to attempt the pole. At the last moment when down to two teams (Scott's and Evans's) Scott decided to send a returning party of three, and take on five. This increased the cooking time for the team of five and affected the fuel supply. It also meant the Evans party of three {{had to try to}} split the ration pack (at a time when they were cold and tired and later when one member was suffering from scurvy) to leave an allowance for the fifth man in Scott's party. This <b>also</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> affected the seepage of fuel from cans which were opened and then re-closed and left for several weeks before Scott's team got to them. Moreover, for some unexplained reason Scott had ordered Evans's team to cache their skis a week before so Bowers (the fifth man) walked to the pole and back to the cached skis (360miles) while the rest of Scott's team skied.|$|E
2500|$|The playing modes are {{wrapped in}} an [...] "overshell", which allow players to sign {{in or out}} of game console profiles, manage players in the band, and jump {{in or out of}} the game with any {{available}} instrument at any point, including while playing a song. Players <b>also</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> the ability to pause the game and make changes in difficulty; when leaving the pause menu, the song rewinds a few seconds to allow all players to synchronize before the scoring restarts. Due to the limitations in the number of local players on this generation of consoles, only four of the five parts (lead and bass guitar, drums, harmonized vocals, and keyboards) can be played in online and local career and competitive modes. The game attempts to provide the option of a local [...] "All Instruments" [...] quick play mode where all five parts are used allowing the full seven-member band to play; to side step system limitations the vocals are not assigned to a console player but instead are based on the input, if present, from Wireless USB-connected microphones, and the vocal results are not scored along with the other playing members.|$|E
50|$|The {{school will}} enjoy its own {{cafeteria}} {{with a hot}} lunch line, salad bar and private faculty dining room.

2500|$|Since 1992, the EMMS {{has been}} {{fundraising}} through bike rides in various countries. [...] The first bike ride that it sponsored {{took place in}} Israel with the Norwood Ravenswood Charity. [...] This bike ride took riders from Dan to Beersheba. [...] The EMMS believes that bike rides {{are one of the}} most opportune modes of fundraising because the participants can not only see the locations which will benefit from their fundraising, but <b>also</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> a [...] "real challenge [...] the mind and body and [...] an unforgettable spiritual experience." [...] The EMMS believes that supporters will see the value of their contributions by visiting these site locations and seeing the effect of their funding efforts. [...] The EMMS tells its potential visitors that the bike treks are not a [...] "holiday" [...] and are actually very challenging. [...] In addition to the bike rides, the EMMS suggests that anyone who wishes to donate can join a fundraiser that other organizations lead. [...] These [...] "open challenges" [...] come from organizations that the EMMS lists on its website that include Classic Tours, Discover Adventure, Travel2Give, and Different Travel.|$|E

6000|$|How the Hohenzollerns {{got their}} big Territories, {{and came to}} what {{they are in the}} world, will be seen. Probably they were not, any of them, paragons of virtue. They did not walk in {{altogether}} speckless Sunday pumps, or much clear-starched into consciousness of the moral sublime; but in rugged practical boots, and by such roads as there were. Concerning their moralities, and conformities to the Laws of the Road and of the Universe, there will much remain to be argued by pamphleteers and others. Men will have their opinion, Men of more wisdom and of less; Apes by the Dead-Sea <b>also</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> theirs. But what man that believed in such a Universe as that of this Dead-Sea Pamphleteer could consent to live in it at all? Who that believed in such a Universe, and did not design to live like a Papin's-Digester, or PORCUS EPICURI, in an extremely ugly manner in it, could avoid one of two things: Going rapidly into Bedlam, or else blowing his brains out? [...] "It will not do for me at any rate, this infinite Dog-house; not for me, ye Dryasdusts, and omnipotent Dog-monsters and Mud-gods, whoever you are.

60|$|Sir Thomas Underwood, whom I, and I hope my readers <b>also,</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> to {{know very}} intimately, {{was one of}} those who are not able to make {{themselves}} known intimately to any. I am speaking now of a man of sixty, and I am speaking also of one who had never yet made a close friend,--who had never by unconscious and slow degrees of affection fallen into that kind of intimacy with another man which justifies and renders necessary mutual freedom of intercourse in all the affairs of life. And yet he was possessed of warm affections, was by no means misanthropic in his nature, and would, in truth, have given much to be able to be free and jocund as are other men. He lacked the power that way, rather than the will. To himself it seemed to be a weakness in him rather than a strength that he should always be silent, always guarded, always secret and dark. He had lamented it as an acknowledged infirmity;--as a man grieves that he should be short-sighted, or dull of hearing; but at the age of sixty he had taken no efficient steps towards curing himself of the evil, and had now abandoned all idea of any such cure.|$|E

60|$|Fourth, the Victorian Age is {{especially}} remarkable {{because of its}} rapid progress in all the arts and sciences and in mechanical inventions. A glance at any record of the industrial achievements {{of the nineteenth century}} will show how vast they are, and it is unnecessary to repeat here the list of the inventions, from spinning looms to steamboats, and from matches to electric lights. All these material things, as well as the growth of education, have their influence upon the life of a people, and it is inevitable that they should react upon its prose and poetry; though as yet we are too much absorbed in our sciences and mechanics to determine accurately their influence upon literature. When these new things shall by long use have became familiar as country roads, or have been replaced by newer and better things, then they <b>also</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> their associations and memories, and a poem on the railroads may be as suggestive as Wordsworth's sonnet on Westminster Bridge; and the busy, practical workingmen who to-day throng our streets and factories may seem, to a future and greater age, as quaint and poetical as to us seem the slow toilers of the Middle Ages.|$|E
60|$|This Eber {{was a very}} godly man, {{the next}} after Shem that vigorously stood up to {{maintain}} religion. Two things are entailed upon him to his everlasting honour: First, The children of God, even Abraham himself, was not ashamed to own himself one of this man's disciples, or followers; and hence he is called Abraham the Hebrew, or Ebrew (Gen 14:13). Joseph <b>also</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> it go there: I was stolen (said he) out {{of the land of}} the Hebrews (Gen 40:15). Nay, the Lord God himself, to show how he honoured this man's faith and life, doth style himself the God of his fathers, to wit, the God of the Hebrews, the Lord God of the Hebrews (Exo 3:18; 7:16; 9:1,13). Secondly, This was the man that kept that language with which Adam was created, and that in which God spake to the fathers of old, from being corrupted and confounded by the confusion of Babel; and therefore it is for ever called his, the Hebrew tongue (John 5:2; 19:13,20), the tongue in which Christ spake from heaven to and by Saul (Acts 21:40; 22:2; 26:14). This man therefore, was a stiff opposer of Nimrod; neither had he a hand in the building of Babel; for all that had, had their language confounded by that strange judgment of God.|$|E
