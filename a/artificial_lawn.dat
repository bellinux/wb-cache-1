50|$|M-Wave (Emu-wēbu) is {{an indoor}} speed skating oval located in Nagano, Japan.Opened in 1996, the arena has a {{capacity}} of 18,000. It hosted the speed skating events of the 1998 Winter Olympics. The M-Wave is equipped with movable stands and an automatically winding <b>artificial</b> <b>lawn</b> machine.

50|$|The Sports City project, {{the first}} phase, started in 2003 with the {{construction}} of the City Stadium. In 2005, the football fields with <b>artificial</b> <b>lawn,</b> behind the stadium, opened. The 19 hectare Leisure Park area started being built in 2007 and was completed for the 2009 festivities of Póvoa de Varzim Holiday. The construction was slow and phased, mostly due to existence of 150 privately owned lands. The funding for the project was from the Póvoa de Varzim City Hall's own funds and the remaining 25% was from the Tourism Fund, which manages the taxes collected from Póvoa Casino.|$|E
60|$|These woods, so {{peculiar}} to certain districts of country, are not altogether without some variety, though possessing a general character of sameness. The trees were of very uniform size, being little taller than pear-trees, which they resemble {{a good deal}} in form; and having trunks that rarely attain two feet in diameter. The variety is produced by their distribution. In places they stand with a regularity resembling that of an orchard; then, again, they are more scattered and less formal, while wide breadths of the land are occasionally seen in which they stand in copses, with vacant spaces, that bear no small affinity to <b>artificial</b> <b>lawns,</b> being covered with verdure. The grasses {{are supposed to be}} owing to the fires lighted periodically by the Indians in order to clear their hunting-grounds.|$|R

40|$|Many {{different}} kinds of plants usually grow in close association {{with each other in}} nature. Woodlands, roadsides, mountain slopes, marshlands-almost all places not closely attended by man have their own complex plant associations. A lawn comprised of only one or a few grass species is an unnatural, <b>artificial</b> situation. Accordingly, <b>lawns</b> can be kept attractive only by diligent efforts to eliminate undesirable plants and to prevent the natural invasion of turfs by unwanted plants. This battle must be renewed each year. Knowledge of the habits and weaknesses of weeds enables the lawnkeeper to vanquish these foes in every encounter, usually with little expenditure of effort...|$|R
40|$|The soil {{properties}} out {{of playing}} areas of golf courses (so-called roughs) {{have an influence}} on the lawn vegetation state. Heavy texture of the soil has the cause of deterioration of the water-air properties of soil which is accompanied by changes {{in the nature of}} addition grass lawn from solid to mosaic. Non-aggressive grass of the <b>artificial</b> <b>lawn</b> has {{one of the reasons for}} renewal of native flora and the formation of a new type of plant association, closer to the natural vegetation of the Don floodplai...|$|E
50|$|It was {{previously}} {{the residence of}} the Ii family and Matsudaira clan. In 1884, Shigenobu Ōkuma, the founder of Waseda University, remodeled the garden into semi-Western style. He placed a vast <b>lawn,</b> <b>artificial</b> hills, and ponds, and grew melons in a hothouse {{for the first time}} in Japan. After his death, the garden was donated to Waseda University. Although it suffered serious damage in the air raid of 1945, it was almost restored and now is a recreation place for students. The garden features an extensive lawn, brooks, seasonal plants and walking paths. There are lanterns, small stone pagodas, statues. Reduced-size replica of “Shotoku-Daiou-Shinkyo” which was donated by the Korean graduates’ association in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the university, now adorns the garden.|$|R
5000|$|The stadium {{was built}} in the area Galadyuzyu in place of old arena. The total area of 2.3 hectares. The draft was {{prepared}} by the Bulgarian [...] "Dynamic Resource", commissioned by the company [...] "General Constructions". The work took place from 2006 to August 2008. At its construction has been spent around US$12 million. The stadium holds 3500 spectators, one-sided platform for VIP-guests, calculated at 181.

50|$|Alphand {{solved the}} problem by annexing {{addition}} sections of land {{at the edges of}} the park, and by creating three smaller parks around the Bois, each with its own artificial lake and picturesque landscape. Lake Daumesnil, designed like a romantic landscape painting, had two islands, and sloping green lawns. The Lac des Minimes to the north included some of the ruins of the original Medieval monastery that once stood there; and the Lac de Saint-Mandė in the southwest completed the park. This last lake was higher in elevation than the others, on the Plateau de Gravelle, and therefore provided water to the other lakes through <b>artificial</b> streams. Trees, <b>lawns</b> and flower beds were planted by Jean-Pierre Barillet-Deschamps, the chief horticulturist of the city, who had landscaped the Bois de Boulogne.|$|R
