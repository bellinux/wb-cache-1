40|$|<b>Alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia</b> of {{childhood}} {{is a rare}} disorder caused by de novo mutations in the ATP 1 A 3 gene, expressed in neurons and cardiomyocytes. As affected individuals may survive into adulthood, we use the term 'alternating hemiplegia'. The disorder is characterized by early-onset, recurrent, often alternating, hemiplegic episodes; seizures and non-paroxysmal neurological features also occur. Dysautonomia may occur during hemiplegia or in isolation. Premature mortality can occur in this patient group and is not fully explained. Preventable cardiorespiratory arrest from underlying cardiac dysrhythmia may be a cause. We analysed ECG recordings of 52 patients with <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia</b> from nine countries: all had whole-exome, whole-genome, or direct Sanger sequencing of ATP 1 A 3. Data on autonomic dysfunction, cardiac symptoms, medication, and family history of cardiac disease or sudden death were collected. All had 12 -lead electrocardiogram recordings available for cardiac axis, cardiac interval, repolarization pattern, and J-point analysis. Where available, historical and prolonged single-lead electrocardiogram recordings during electrocardiogram-videotelemetry were analysed. Half the cohort (26 / 52) had resting 12 -lead electrocardiogram abnormalities: 25 / 26 had repolarization (T wave) abnormalities. These abnormalities were significantly more common in people with <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia</b> than in an age-matched disease control group of 52 people with epilepsy. The average corrected QT interval was significantly shorter in people with <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia</b> than in the disease control group. J wave or J-point changes were seen in six people with <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia.</b> Over half the affected cohort (28 / 52) had intraventricular conduction delay, or incomplete right bundle branch block, a much higher proportion than in the normal population or disease control cohort (P = 0. 0164). Abnormalities in <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia</b> were more common in those 16 years old, compared with those < 16 (P = 0. 0095), even with a specific mutation (p. D 801 N; P = 0. 045). Dynamic, beat-to-beat or electrocardiogram-to-electrocardiogram, changes were noted, suggesting the prevalence of abnormalities was underestimated. Electrocardiogram changes occurred independently of seizures or plegic episodes. Electrocardiogram abnormalities are common in <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia,</b> have characteristics reflecting those of inherited cardiac channelopathies and most likely amount to impaired repolarization reserve.

40|$|<b>Alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia</b> of {{childhood}} {{is a very}} rare and serious neurodevelopmental syndrome; its genetic basis has recently been established. Its characteristic features include typically-unprovoked episodes of hemiplegia and other transient or more persistent neurological abnormalities. We used transcranial magnetic stimulation to assess {{the effect of the}} condition on motor cortex neurophysiology both during and between attacks of hemiplegia. Nine people with <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia</b> {{of childhood}} were recruited; eight were successfully tested using transcranial magnetic stimulation to study motor cortex excitability, using single and paired pulse paradigms. For comparison, data from ten people with epilepsy but not <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia,</b> and ten healthy controls, were used. One person with <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia</b> tested during the onset of a hemiplegic attack showed progressively diminishing motor cortex excitability until no response could be evoked; a second person tested during a prolonged bilateral hemiplegic attack showed unusually low excitability. Three people tested between attacks showed asymptomatic variation in cortical excitability, not seen in controls. Paired pulse paradigms, which probe intracortical inhibitory and excitatory circuits, gave results similar to controls. We report symptomatic and asymptomatic fluctuations in motor cortex excitability in people with <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia</b> of childhood, not seen in controls.

50|$|First, the {{symptoms}} must be observed before {{the patient is}} 18 months of age. Second, there must be frequent episodes of hemiplegia, involving {{either side of the}} body. Third, other paroxysmal disorders including tonic attacks, dystonia, nystagmus, strabismus, dyspnoea, and other uncontrollable disorders are noticed to occur. Although common, the paroxysmal disorders involving the eye, nystagmus and strabismus, may not be apparent in older children and may not have been remembered in childhood so a lack of these symptoms does not rule out <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia.</b> Fourth, all symptoms clear up directly after falling asleep and usually come back after waking during an attack. This occurrence is very indicative of <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia</b> and as such those who display this are usually diagnosed with probable <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia.</b> Fifth, indications of developmental delays, learning disability, or neurological irregularities are present.

50|$|<b>Alternating</b> <b>{{hemiplegia}}</b> {{is a form}} of hemiplegia {{that has}} an ipsilateral and contralateral presentation {{in different parts of the}} body. The disorder is characterized by recurrent episodes of paralysis on one side of the body. There are multiple forms of <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia,</b> Weber's syndrome, middle <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia,</b> and inferior <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia.</b> This type of syndrome can result from a unilateral lesion in the brainstem affecting both upper motor neurons and lower motor neurons. The muscles that would receive signals from these damaged upper motor neurons result in spastic paralysis. With a lesion in the brainstem, this affects the majority of limb and trunk muscles on the contralateral side due to the upper motor neurons decussation after the brainstem. The cranial nerves and cranial nerve nuclei are also located in the brainstem making them susceptible to damage from a brainstem lesion. Cranial nerves III (Oculomotor), VI (Abducens), and XII (Hypoglossal) are most often associated with this syndrome given their close proximity with the pyramidal tract, the location which upper motor neurons are in on their way to the spinal cord. Damages to these structures produce the ipsilateral presentation of paralysis or palsy due to the lack of cranial nerve decussation (aside from the trochlear nerve) before innervating their target muscles. The paralysis may be brief or it may last for several days, many times the episodes will resolve after sleep. Some common symptoms of <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia</b> are mental impairment, gait and balance difficulties, excessive sweating and changes in body temperature.|$|R

MethodsWe conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of triheptanoin, at a target dose corresponding to 30 % of daily calorie intake, in ten patients with <b>alternating</b> <b>hemiplegia</b> of childhood due to ATP 1 A 3 mutations. Each treatment period consisted of a 12 -week fixed-dose phase, separated by a 4 -week washout period. The primary outcome was {{the total number of}} paroxysmal events. Secondary outcomes included the number of paroxysmal motor-epileptic events; a composite score taking into account the number, severity and duration of paroxysmal events; interictal neurological manifestations; the clinical global impression-improvement scale (CGI-I); and safety parameters. The paired non-parametric Wilcoxon test was used to analyze treatment effects. ResultsIn an intention-to-treat analysis, triheptanoin failed to reduce the total number of paroxysmal events (p[*]=[*] 0. 646), including motor-epileptic events (p[*]=[*] 0. 585), or the composite score (p[*]=[*] 0. 059).

While the neurological profile of this condition is well defined, the question whether a recognizable pattern of physical anomalies does exist in this condition is still open. We performed a morphological evaluation of 30 patients at different ages. All patients were evaluated independently by each author and evaluation sheets were compared, discussed, and agreed afterwards. This study started before the identification of ATP 1 A 3 as the causative gene, and the patients were selected upon their neurological picture.

We also evaluated patients photographs taken from the parents in early childhood (6 - 20 months) to delineate a clinical profile possibly recognizable before the neurological signs suggest the diagnosis.
