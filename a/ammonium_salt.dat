Heating this <b>ammonium</b> <b>salt</b> {{in the presence}} of hydrogen reduces it to elemental platinum. Potassium hexachloroplatinate is similarly insoluble, and hexachloroplatinic acid has been used in the determination of potassium ions by gravimetry.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} {{water-soluble}} caffeic acid <b>ammonium</b> <b>salts</b> (compounds 1 – 28) were synthesized by acid-base neutralization. Except compound 21, all the compounds were first reported. The chemical structures of these compounds were confirmed {{by means of}} 1 H NMR, ESI MS and elemental analyses. All of the compounds were assayed for antibacterial (Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Escherichia coli ATCC 35218, Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 13525 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538) activities by MTT method. Compounds benzenaminium (E) - 3 -(3, 4 -dihydroxyphenyl) acrylate (6), dibutylammonium (E) - 3 -(3, 4 -dihydroxyphenyl) acrylate (24) and triethylammonium (E) - 3 -(3, 4 -dihydroxyphenyl) acrylate (27) showed considerable antibacterial activities.

500|$|Bird {{studied and}} {{categorised}} {{the collection of}} stones at Guy's, concentrating particularly on the crystal structures of the nuclei, since stone formation followed {{once there was a}} nucleus on which to form. [...] He considered the chemistry of the nuclei {{to be the most important}} aspect of stone formation. [...] Bird identified many species of stone, classified by the chemistry of the nucleus, but determined that they all fell within two overall groups: organic stones caused by a misfunctioning bodily process, and excessive inorganic salts causing sediment on which the stone could nucleate. [...] In 1842, Bird became the first to describe oxaluria, sometimes called Bird's disease, which is caused by an excess of oxalate of lime in the urine.Lee, p. 27Talbott, p. 599Schmidt, p. 342 [...] This is the second most common cause of kidney stones, the first being uric acid and its <b>ammonium</b> <b>salt.</b> [...] There are several others, such as ammonium oxalate. [...] In his great work Urinary Deposits, Bird devotes much space to the identification of chemicals in urine by microscopic examination of the appearance of crystals in it. [...] He shows how the appearance of crystals of the same chemical can vary greatly under differing conditions, and especially how the appearance changes with disease. [...] Urinary Deposits became a standard text on the subject; there were five editions between 1844 and 1857. [...] In the fourth edition Bird added a recommendation to wash out the bladder in cases of alkaline urine, after an experiment by Snow showed that stale urine became alkaline when fresh urine was slowly dripped into it. [...] Bird knew that alkaline urine encouraged phosphate precipitation and the consequent encrustation and stone formation. [...] The last edition of Urinary Deposits was updated after Bird's death by Edmund Lloyd Birkett.Coley, pp. 371–372Payne and McConnellRosenfeld, 1999, p. 50Vinten-Johansen, p. 109 ...|$|E

40|$|The complex {{formation}} of alkyl <b>ammonium</b> <b>salts</b> by water-soluble carboxylatopillar 5] arene (CP 5 A) in aqueous medium is reported. p-Xylene diammonium salt {{and a series}} of secondary alkyl <b>ammonium</b> <b>salts</b> with various alkyl groups have been prepared and investigated for complex formation. All the <b>ammonium</b> <b>salts</b> exhibit strong host-guest complexation with CP 5 A under neutral aqueous conditions.

2500|$|Candicine is a {{naturally}} occurring organic compound {{that is a}} quaternary <b>ammonium</b> <b>salt</b> with a phenethylamine skeleton. It is the N,N,N-trimethyl derivative of the well-known biogenic amine tyramine, and, being a natural product with a positively charged nitrogen atom in its molecular structure, it is classed as an alkaloid.
