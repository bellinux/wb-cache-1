25|$|The ethnic {{culture of}} each man was important. Among the Core City subjects, 61% of {{whose parents were}} born in foreign {{countries}}, alcoholics were seven {{times more likely to}} have Irish than Italian backgrounds. In general, more alcoholics came from countries such as Ireland that prohibited drinking among children but condoned adult drunkenness. Fewer alcoholics came from countries such as Italy that allowed children to drink, especially at meals, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> on adult drunkenness.|$|E
25|$|The Chinese commanders {{decided to}} agree to the terms. At Kaungton, on 13 December 1769 (or 22 December 1769), under a 7-roofed pyathat hall, 14 Burmese and 13 Chinese {{officers}} signed a peace treaty. The Chinese burned their boats and melted down their cannon. Two days later, as the Burmese stood to arms <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down,</b> starved Chinese soldiers marched sullenly away up the Taiping valley; they began to perish of hunger by thousands in the passes.|$|E

25|$|After {{spending}} {{the rest of}} 1985 and early 1986 competing for New Japan Pro Wrestling, Snuka resurfaced in the American Wrestling Association (AWA), replacing Jerry Blackwell as Greg Gagne's partner, to defeat Bruiser Brody and Nord the Barbarian in a tag team cage match at WrestleRock 86. Snuka split his time between the AWA and Japan throughout 1986 and 1987. His most notable feud in the AWA during that time was with Colonel DeBeers, who portrayed a racist <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> on Snuka because of his skin color. This led {{the way for a}} series of grudge matches in 1987.|$|E
25|$|An {{economic}} transition {{occurred during}} this period, {{due to the}} diversity of the service sector being far greater than any other previous or contemporary society, and the high degree of economic integration between the labour force and the economy. Islamic society also experienced a change in attitude towards manual labour. In previous civilizations such as ancient Greece and in contemporary civilizations such as early medieval Europe, intellectuals saw manual labour in a negative light <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> on them with contempt. This resulted in technological stagnation as they did not see the need for machinery to replace manual labour. In the Islamic world, however, manual labour was seen in a far more positive light, as intellectuals such as the Brethren of Purity likened them to a participant in the act of creation, while Ibn Khaldun alluded to the benefits of manual labour to the progress of society.|$|E
500|$|Castle Rising {{was built}} soon after 1138 by William d'Aubigny II, an {{upwardly}} mobile Anglo-Norman noble {{who owned the}} surrounding manor of Snettisham. William married Adeliza of Louvain, the widow of King Henry I in that year, and became the Earl of Arundel in 1139. This transformed his social position, and one chronicler at Waltham Holy Cross complained how he [...] "became intolerably puffed up... <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> upon every other eminence in the world except the King". With his new wealth, William built Castle Rising and New Buckenham Castle in Norfolk, and expanded Arundel Castle in West Sussex.|$|E

500|$|Ayane {{is officially}} {{one of the}} [...] "faces" [...] of Dead or Alive. In the series' back story, Ayane was {{conceived}} and born {{as a result of}} the evil ninja Raidou's rape of Ayame, Kasumi's mother and wife of Shiden, leader of the [...] ninja clan. Ayane is overshadowed by her half-sister Kasumi and bears jealousy and hatred towards her and her privileged upbringing. The Mugen Tenshin villagers allowed Ayane to stay, but disliked <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> on her. Since they were children, Ayane has secretly admired her half-brother Hayate as a way of increasing her self-esteem. Hayate is portrayed as fond of her in return. Besides Kasumi, Ayame's ire focusses on Raidou who both created and ruined her life. Ayane's envy towards Kasumi is similar to the hatred Raidou had towards Shiden, Kasumi's father.|$|E
500|$|The {{government}} in Montevideo {{was at first}} reluctant to consider Saraiva's proposals. With backing from Paraguay, it saw little advantage in negotiating a close to the civil war or in seeking to comply with Brazil's demands. The main factor, as historian Jeffrey D. Needell summarized, was that the [...] "Uruguayan president had been unwilling to resolve these, particularly because the Brazilians whose grievances were at issue were allies of Venancio Flores, a client of the Argentines, {{and a man who}} was seeking his overthrow." [...] A mutual enmity between Brazil and its Hispanic-American neighbors compounded the difficulties, the result of a long-standing distrust and rivalry between Spain and Portugal that had been carried over to their former American colonies. Brazil and Uruguay exhibited loathing for one another; as Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham put it: [...] "the Brazilians holding the Uruguayans as bloodthirsty savages, and the Uruguayans returning their contempt for the unwarlike ways of the Brazilians, whom they called monkeys, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> upon, for their mixed blood." ...|$|E

Fronto put an uncharitable interpretation of Marcus' [...] "conversion to philosophy": [...] "in the fashion of the young, tired of boring work", Marcus had turned to philosophy to escape the constant exercises of oratorical training. Marcus kept in close touch with Fronto, but he would ignore his scruples.|$|E

She usually wears a white mini-dress with a blue ribbon around her collar and another tied around her waist, back and arms, which has become the character's most defining feature. She also wears a pair of white gloves and usually goes barefoot. Although petite, she has been nicknamed the [...] for her large bust size, which makes some of her deity peers like Loki jealous.

2500|$|The cage {{giving way}} {{completely}} {{was a surprise}} to both Foley and The Undertaker. The Undertaker later said that he thought Foley was dead following the second fall. [...] Foley was genuinely knocked unconscious for a few moments from the impact, but was able to come around. Terry Funk wrote in his autobiography, [...] "Watching from the back, I thought he was dead. I ran out here <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> at him, still lying in the ring where he'd landed. His eyes weren't rolled back in his head, but they looked totally glazed over, like a dead fish's eyes." [...] Foley later said that the only reason he survived the fall was because he did not take the chokeslam properly. In his memoir Have a Nice Day, Foley called it both the best and worst chokeslam he ever took, saying that despite its looks, he would have likely died if he had landed properly. He also cited the fact that the ring he landed in had a harder surface than the modern rings do, which stopped his momentum once he landed. Foley would later explain that the roof of the cell was supposed to sag sufficiently so that Undertaker could kick him through, allowing him to dangle by his feet and eventually fall in a rotation to land on his front.|$|E
2500|$|On March 16, 1991, a year {{prior to}} the Los Angeles riots, {{storekeeper}} Soon Ja Du physically confronted black ninth-grader Latasha Harlins by grabbing her sweater and backpack over whether the 15-year-old {{had been trying to}} steal a bottle of orange juice from Empire Liquor, the store Du's family owned in Compton. After Latasha hit Du, Du shot Latasha {{in the back of the}} head, killing her. (Security tape showed the girl, already dead, was still clutching $2 in her hand when investigators arrived.) Du was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and forced to pay a fine of $500, but not sentenced to any prison time. As a result, relations between the African-American and Korean communities significantly worsened, and the former became increasingly mistrustful of the criminal justice system. Racial tensions had been simmering underneath the surface for several years. Many African Americans were angry toward a growing Korean merchant community in South Central Los Angeles earning a living in their communities, and felt disrespected <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> on by many Korean merchants. Cultural differences and a language barrier further fueled tensions in an already fragile environment. [...] The probation Soon Ja Du received for killing Latasha Harlins combined with the acquittal of the four LAPD officers in Rodney King's trial resulted in the ensuing Los Angeles riots, and much of that anger was directed at Koreans.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the long}} fourth reading ( [...] , aliyah), the angel {{replied that he}} would grant Lot this favor too, and spare that town. The angel urged Lot to hurry there, for the angel could not do {{anything}} until he arrived there, and thus the town {{came to be called}} Zoar. As the sun rose and Lot entered Zoar, God rained sulfurous fire from heaven on Sodom and Gomorrah and annihilated the entire plain. Lot's wife looked back, and she turned into a pillar of salt. Next morning, Abraham hurried to the place where he had stood before God <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> toward Sodom and Gomorrah and saw the smoke rising like at a kiln. Lot was afraid to dwell in Zoar, so he settled in a cave in the hill country with his two daughters. The older daughter told the younger that their father was old, and there was not a man on earth with whom to have children, so she proposed that they get Lot drunk and have sex with him so that they might maintain life through their father. That night they made their father drink wine, and the older one lay with her father without his being aware. And the next day the older one persuaded the younger to do the same. The two daughters thus had children by their father, the older one bore a son named Moab who became the father of the Moabites, and the younger bore a son named Ben-ammi who became the father of the Ammonites.
