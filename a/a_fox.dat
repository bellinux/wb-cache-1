5|$|In {{another of}} her studies, Morgan worked with <b>a</b> <b>fox</b> breeder to {{study the effects of}} diets that {{contained}} low and normal amounts of B vitamins.

Morgan wore the stole on at least two important occasions – her presentation of the study data in 1939 and her Garvan Medal award ceremony ten years later.|$|E

Kitsune may also be exposed while in human form by their fear and hatred of dogs, and some become so rattled by their presence that they revert to the form of <b>a</b> <b>fox</b> and flee.|$|E
