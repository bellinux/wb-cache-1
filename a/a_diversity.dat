5|$|Alkaloids {{are derived}} from various amino acids. Over 3000 known {{alkaloids}} exist, examples include nicotine, caffeine, morphine, cocaine, colchicine, ergolines, strychnine, and quinine. Alkaloids have pharmacological effects on humans and other animals. Some alkaloids can inhibit or activate enzymes, or alter carbohydrate and fat storage by inhibiting the formation phosphodiester bonds involved in their breakdown. Certain alkaloids bind to nucleic acids and can inhibit synthesis of proteins and affect DNA repair mechanisms. Alkaloids can also affect cell membrane and cytoskeletal structure causing the cells to weaken, collapse, or leak, and can affect nerve transmission. Although alkaloids act on <b>a</b> <b>diversity</b> of metabolic systems in humans and other animals, they almost uniformly invoke an aversively bitter taste.|$|E

5|$|Gonopods {{occur in}} <b>a</b> <b>diversity</b> {{of shapes and}} sizes, and {{in the range from}} closely {{resembling}} walking legs to complex structures quite unlike legs at all. In some groups, the gonopods are kept retracted within the body; in others they project forward parallel to the body. Gonopod morphology is the predominant means of determining species among millipedes: the structures may differ greatly between closely related species but very little within a species. The gonopods develop gradually from walking legs through successive moults until reproductive maturity.|$|E
5|$|Grassland on the Helvellyn range {{has been}} heavily overgrazed for many years, yet it {{supports}} <b>a</b> <b>diversity</b> of acid grassland species including sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina) {{on the summit}} ridge, matgrass (Nardus stricta) on the middle slopes, and fescue-bent swards on the lower slopes. The Nardus grasslands are the haunt of the scarce mountain ringlet butterfly (Erebia epiphron), the only alpine species of butterfly found in Britain. Acidic flushes (areas of water seepage) with their carpets of sphagnum mosses are common. Less common are basic flushes, which support a greater diversity of species.|$|E

The Perpendicular style, which relies on a network of intersecting mullions and transoms rather than on <b>a</b> <b>diversity</b> of richly carved forms for effect, gives an overall impression of great unity, in which the structure of the vast windows of both clerestory and east end are integrated with the arcades below and the vault above.
