500|$|I {{have almost}} reached the regrettable {{conclusion}} that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Councilor or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to [...] "order" [...] than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which {{is the absence of}} tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: [...] "I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> methods of direct action"; who paternalistic-ally believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a [...] "more convenient season." ...|$|E
2500|$|Falwell's legacy {{regarding}} {{homosexuality is}} complicated by his support for LGBT civil rights (see [...] "civil rights" [...] section above), {{as well as his}} attempts to reconcile with the LGBT community in later years. [...] In October 1999 Falwell hosted a meeting of 200 evangelicals with 200 homosexuals at Thomas Road Baptist Church for an [...] "Anti-Violence Forum", during which he acknowledged that some American evangelicals' comments about homosexuality entered the realm of hate speech that could incite violence. At the forum, Falwell told homosexuals in attendance, [...] "I don't <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> lifestyle, I will never <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> lifestyle, but I love you" [...] and added, [...] "Anything that leaves the impression that we hate the sinner, we want to change that." [...] He later commented to New York Times columnist Frank Rich that [...] "admittedly, evangelicals have not exhibited an ability to build a bond of friendship to the gay and lesbian community. We've said 'go somewhere else, we don't need you here [...] our churches.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|I think I <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> [...] {{order for}} reading the books more than with your mother's. The series was not planned {{beforehand}} as she thinks. When I wrote The Lion I {{did not know}} I was going to write any more. Then I wrote P. Caspian as a sequel and still didn't {{think there would be}} any more, and when I had done The Voyage I felt quite sure it would be the last, but I found I was wrong. So perhaps it does not matter very much in which order anyone read them. I’m not even sure that all the others were written in the same order in which they were published.|$|E

6000|$|... "Baron Gozelius <b>agrees</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> celebrated pastor, Dr. Cumming," [...] said Theodora, with a {{tinge of}} demure sarcasm, [...] "and {{believes}} {{that the end of}} the world is at hand." ...|$|R
3000|$|... “Maintainers {{have the}} last word most of the time. If the {{conflict}} is about a maintainer not <b>agreeing</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> vision..., <b>with</b> specific technical decision, then it is [the maintainer’s call].” [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{has already}} {{asked me to}} assist him, Iris; and I have refused. I can't <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> change of opinion about Mr. Vimpany." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> terms, Countess," [...] he answered, [...] "but this is {{scarcely}} the place {{or the time}} for argument. Your brother?" ...|$|E
60|$|SURFACE. Now my dear Lady Teazle if you {{but once}} make a trifling Faux Pas you can't {{conceive}} how cautious you would grow, and how ready to humour and <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> Husband.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know {{something}} of Mr. Lloyd; I shall write to him; if his reply <b>agrees</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> statement, you shall be publicly cleared from every imputation; to me, Jane, you are clear now." ...|$|R
5000|$|If you {{are calling}} about {{an issue that}} we have <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> {{community}} will be a neighbourhood priority (listed opposite) and attendance is required, we will aim {{to be with you}} within 60 minutes.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's what I'm {{trying to}} decide," [...] he replied. [...] "Sometimes I feel like renouncing myself altogether; but usually I give myself another chance. I dare say if I hadn't been so forbearing I might have <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> sister about my unfitness for the ministry." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{met this}} {{imputation}} with the quickest amusement. [...] "I beg your pardon. I don't think I shall {{tell you anything}} of the sort. I don't know that I even <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> premiss." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{to thank}} you, ma'am," [...] he would remark on rising, [...] "for a most {{delightful}} conversation. I {{may not be able}} to <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> conclusions, but they afford food for reflection." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “There’s {{a risk of}} your {{doing so}} if you persist in your foolishness. If you had stopped to reason, you would have seen it was your duty to <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> skipper. Misguided pity is a {{dangerous}} thing.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Supposing," [...] he said, {{dropping}} his voice a little, [...] "supposing I were {{to tell you}}, young man, that I entirely <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> friend? Supposing I were to tell you that, possibly by accident, he has stumbled upon the exact truth? What would you say then?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "True," [...] {{said the}} {{official}} person; [...] "a brown short-gown, mutch, red rokelay--that <b>agrees</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> Madge Wildfire, Mr. Butler?" [...] Butler {{agreed that it}} did so. [...] "Yes, there was a sufficient motive for taking this crazy creature's dress and name, while he was about such a job." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A fiddle on your {{constitution}}! How can {{you tell}} what <b>agrees</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> constitution unless you try? You own you are not well; you are subject to headaches; and every physician {{will tell you that}} a tilting motion disorders the stomach and acts upon the brain. Ask old Dr. Kite. I was talking <b>with</b> him about <b>your</b> case only yesterday, and says he, 'Mrs. Magpie, I perfectly <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> you.'" ...|$|R
60|$|RAINA (in {{uncontrollable}} vexation). I quite <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> {{account of}} yourself. You are a romantic idiot. (Bluntschli is unspeakably taken aback.)

6000|$|Peterkin {{shook his}} head, and said solemnly, [...] "Ralph, my boy, don't take to joking. It don't <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> constitution. You'll get ill if you do; and we can't {{afford to have}} you laid up on our hands in these out-o'-the-way regions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think," [...] {{said the}} nobleman, rising and laying down the oyster, [...] "I {{ought to know}} {{something}} more definite about your antecedents before succouring you. If you couldn't <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> mistress, you are probably no better than you should be." ...|$|E
5000|$|In Sura al-Qiyama the Qur'an {{mentions}} [...] "the self-accusing nafs". This is {{the stage}} where [...] "the conscience is awakened and the self accuses one for listening to one’s ego.

[...] Here the nafs is inspired by your heart, sees the results of <b>your</b> actions, <b>agrees</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> brain, sees your weaknesses, and aspires to perfection.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't quite <b>agree,</b> mother, <b>with</b> <b>your</b> {{notions about}} truth. To my mind a warrior {{should always be}} {{straightforward}} and say what he means." ...|$|R
60|$|GRACE. Yes, Leonard; but I'm an {{advanced}} woman. (He checks himself {{and looks at}} her in some consternation.) I'm what my father calls a New Woman. (He lets her go and stares at her.) I quite <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> all <b>your</b> ideas.|$|R
6000|$|... "I profess neither love nor favour to {{the young}} man," [...] {{answered}} Buckingham, whose high-spirited ambition bore always an open character: [...] "but I cannot but <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> Highness, that our dear gossip hath been something hasty in apprehending personal danger from him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well--I don't <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> instinct, Dick!" [...] said Gillingham gravely. [...] "I {{am quite}} amazed, {{to tell the}} truth, that such a sedate, plodding fellow as you should have entertained such a craze for a moment. You said when I called that she was puzzling and peculiar: I think you are!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear, I am {{interested}}--deeply {{interested in}} you. That {{there may be}} some such influence as Destiny in our poor mortal lives, I dare not deny. But I don't <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> conclusion. What Destiny has to do with you and with me, neither you nor I can pretend to know beforehand. In the presence of that great mystery, humanity must submit to be ignorant. Wait, Iris--wait!" ...|$|E
60|$|MRS TARLETON. Well, no, {{not afraid}} of them, exactly; but youve got {{to pick up their}} ways. You know, dear, I never quite <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> father's notion of keeping clear of them, and sending you to a school that was so {{expensive}} that they couldnt afford to send their daughters there; so that all the girls belonged to big business families like ourselves. It takes all sorts to make a world; and I wanted you to see a little of all sorts. When you marry Bunny, and go among the women of his father's set, theyll shock you at first.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{mentioned}} {{the matter to}} Miss Thorpe-Hatton, sir. She <b>agrees</b> <b>with</b> me that <b>your</b> proposed ministrations are altogether unneeded in this neighbourhood." ...|$|R

6000|$|KEEGAN. You cannot {{build your}} golf links and {{hotels in the}} air. For that you must own our land. And how will you drag our acres from the ferret's grip of Matthew Haffigan? How will you persuade Cornelius Doyle to forego the pride of being a small landowner? How will Barney Doran's millrace <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> motor boats? Will Doolan help you to get a license for your hotel? ...|$|E
6000|$|Paynter, {{beginning}} to follow, hesitated a moment, and then said: [...] "Forgive {{me for a}} kind of liberty; as you say, you are an older friend of the family. I entirely <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> suggestion, but before you act on your present suspicions, do you know, I think Miss Vane ought to be warned a little? I rather fear all this will be a new shock to her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{do not see}} it in that light," [...] {{returned}} Mr. Welsh. [...] "I <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> views, {{and think}} our Indulged brethren in the wrong; but I counsel forbearance, and cannot agree {{with the idea that}} it is our duty to refuse all connection with them, and treat them as if they belonged to the ranks of the malignants. See what such opinions have cost us already in the overwhelming disaster at Bothwell Brig." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{submitted}} {{your letter}} to Miss Thorpe-Hatton," [...] he said. [...] "She <b>agrees</b> <b>with</b> me that <b>your</b> ministrations are wholly unnecessary here. I wish you good evening!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I quite <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> you in <b>your</b> sentiments, Mr. Grey. Now what {{character}} or what situation in life would you choose, {{if you had}} the power of making your choice?" ...|$|R
