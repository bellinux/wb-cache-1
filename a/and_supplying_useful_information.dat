Along this goal, the objective of having a “trustworthy image” of the: financial position, assets, liabilities and of the represented performance, imply knowing, understanding and correspondingly applying these in practice. Actually, as instruments of internal control, the accounting procedures, which are adopted for drafting and presenting the financial statements, are applied. Regardless of this, the accounting images obtained in his manner do not always reflect the represented economic reality. In this context, the objective of the carried research has focused on identifying the role of the accounting policies and procedures in treating risks that could affect the utility of the accounting information, respectively the trustworthy image of the financial situation and of the performance of an entity...|$|E

Identifying competence levels among students can help course organizers to improve both academic content and teaching/learning processes. The present study addresses this issue by examining {{the implementation}} of an Internet-based competency assessment tool. We analyze the status and evolution of soft skills among students on the Official Masters program Creating and Managing Innovative Technology-Based Companies at the University of Barcelona, using a tool known as Tricuspoid, specifically designed for evaluating entrepreneurial competences.

40|$|To design {{longshore}} breakwaters, {{the evaluation}} of the wave motion transformations over the structures and of the energy they are able to absorb, dissipate and reflect is necessary. To characterize features and transformations of monochromatic wave trains above a breakwater, both submerged and emerged, we have designed and developed a non-intrusive and continuous-in-space technique, based on Image Analysis, and carried out an experimental campaign, in a laboratory flume equipped with a wave-maker, in order to test it. The investigation area was lighted with a light sheet and images were recorded by a video-camera. The working fluid was seeded with non buoyant particles to make it bright and clearly distinct from dark background and breakwater. The technique, that is based on a robust algorithm to identify the free surface, has showed to properly work also in prohibitive situations for traditional resistive probes (e. g., very shallow waters and/or breaking waves) {{and to be able to}} measure the free surface all over the investigation field in a non-intrusive way. Two kind of analysis were mainly performed, a statistical and a spectral one.

40|$|Calcium {{sulphate}} addition {{has traditionally}} been used in Sherry winemaking to reduce the necessary dose of tartaric acid. It {{is not easy to}} predict the final pH of a mixed tartaric acid and calcium sulphate addition and to determine the necessary doses to reach the final pH required by the winemaker because there are several interrelated chemical equilibra implied (tartaric acid dissociation, calcium tartrate and potassium bitartrate precipitation etc.). To predict the effect on pH, several chemical modeling approaches have been described in the literature. It is noteworthy to mention the simplified model where the acidity of wine is considered to be due to a monoprotic acid. In this work the prediction of pH at industrial scale was confirmed and its practical application was facilitated by linear regression lines prepared with pilot scale data. Additionally, sensory analysis of wines acidified with calcium sulphate and tartaric acid alone and mixed indicates that there are great differences among them in taste and that mixed acidification is the preferred by the tasters. That confirms the good comprehension of the chemical equilibria involved in this practice <b>and</b> <b>supply</b> very <b>useful</b> <b>information</b> for its final approval in OIV...|$|R

40|$|This paper contemplates the Library Management System (MIS) as utility for processing, {{accessing}} and retrieving {{information to}} support scholarship and decision-making process. It contents that without an organised {{approach to the}} Management of Information, {{in the context of}} information exploitation scenario, organisations would suffer from information accessibility and retrieval while the clientele may actually findit equally hard to access and make decisions based on the right packaged information. The library MIS is thus considered a utility in the management of knowledge for access and exploitation. It is therefore argued that the library MIS would provide the means and method to manage multimedia-computer based Information Systems to help gain useful, complete and timely information through its objective of satisfying scholarly, academic and administrative information needs of the University. Given that Moi University is multicampus based, boosting of scholarly, academic and administrative clientele that is objective, analytical and information oriented, with the need for the library operational efficiency and organisational effectiveness, it thus calls for the library MIS integrated Multimedia approach to revolutionise its information provision sector. Since the perception of the library MIS objective is measured through its utility for the creation, process, storage, and retrieval of information and given that such MIS supports the library information management process by efficiently processing knowledge <b>and</b> effectively <b>supplying</b> <b>useful</b> <b>information,</b> it directs this paper to postulate the library MIS strategy as well placed and advantageous for accessing, retrieving and sharing information in technologically oriented University environmen...|$|R
40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} post-mortem autolytic {{alterations in}} the skin at cellular and subcellular levels and identifies parameters which may assist in determining {{the time of death}} in the first few hours post-mortem. Serial skin samples from the ventral surface of the arm were taken at intervals of 3, 6, 9 and 12 h after death in 29 subjects of various ages, with no signs of skin disease; causes of death were various. Three types of tests were performed: cytochemical (hematoxylin-eosin and alcian-PAS), immunohistochemical (S- 100, CEA, Cytokeratin, ASM) and ultrastructural (electron microscopy). Electron microscopy proved useful for identifying transformations which were found to be specific for each chronological step considered: reduction of intracellular glycogen in clear cells and reduction of secretory granules in dark cells are typcial signs of the first stage (3 h) after death; mitochondrial dilatation and rarefaction of cristae in clear and dark cells are typical of the second stage (6 h); rarefaction of microvilli in dark and clear cells is a sign of the last stage (12 h). Cytochemistry <b>and</b> immunohistochemistry <b>supply</b> <b>useful</b> <b>information</b> - not for all the chronological stage considered here, but for individual phases (3 h for hematoxylin-eosin and 6 h for alcian-PAS).

40|$|Decomposition {{behavior}} of {{two kinds of}} high-protein high-ash microalgae, including wild Cyanobacteria sp. and cultivated Bacillariophyta sp., was examined via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). Physicochemical properties of bio-oil were extensively investigated through various techniques. Special attention was paid on transfer {{behavior of}} elements (i. e. C and N) during HTL process. A maximum bio-oil yield of 21. 10 wt% (Cyanobacteria sp.) and 18. 21 wt% (Bacillariophyta sp.) on dry basis was achieved at 325 degrees C for 45 - 60 min, accompanying with the maximum (51. 38 % and 48. 76 %) of energy recovered in bio-oil. Although high HHV (33. 87 - 36. 51 MJ kg(- 1)) and high H/C ratio (1. 37 - 1. 62) were estimated for bio-oil products, high N/C ratio (0. 06 - 0. 09) and nitrogen content (5. 31 - 7. 50 %) negatively affected its quality. GC-MS analysis combining with FTIR and NMR detection revealed that components and functional structure of bio-oils were greatly distinguished from other algae bio-oil. TG analysis showed approximate 72. 32 - 75. 79 % of bio-oils was distilled {{in the range of}} 200 - 550 degrees C. Large fraction of carbon and small fraction of nitrogen were recovered in bio-oils, together with high portion of nitrogen was enriched into aqueous liquid. This study demonstrated the feasibility of applying HTL to produce bio-oil from high-protein high-ash microalgae, and the findings on bio-oil properties and transfer behavior of carbon <b>and</b> nitrogen <b>supplied</b> <b>useful</b> <b>information</b> for downstream utilization.

This study investigates (i) {{the reliability and validity}} of the data yielded by using two new instruments for evaluating the teaching qualities of medical faculty, (ii) the instruments' potential for differentiating between faculty, and (iii) the number of residents' evaluations needed per faculty to reliably use the instruments. Multicenter cross-sectional survey among 546 residents and 629 medical faculty representing 29 medical (non-surgical) specialty training programs in The Netherlands. Two instruments [...] one completed by residents and one by faculty [...] for measuring teaching qualities of faculty were developed. Statistical analyses included factor analysis, reliability and validity exploration using standard psychometric methods, calculation of the numbers of residents' evaluations needed per faculty to achieve reliable assessments and variance components and threshold analyses. A total of 403 (73. 8 %) residents completed 3575 evaluations of 570 medical faculty while 494 (78. 5 %) faculty self-evaluated. In both instruments five composite-scales of faculty teaching qualities were detected with high internal consistency and reliability: learning climate (Cronbach's alpha of 0. 85 for residents' instrument, 0. 71 for self-evaluation instrument, professional attitude and behavior (0. 84 / 0. 75), communication of goals (0. 90 / 0. 84), evaluation of residents (0. 91 / 0. 81), and feedback (0. 91 / 0. 85). Faculty tended to evaluate themselves higher than did the residents. Up to a third of the total variance in various teaching qualities can be attributed to between-faculty differences. Some seven residents' evaluations per faculty are needed for assessments to attain a reliability level of 0. 90. The instruments for evaluating teaching qualities of medical faculty appear to yield reliable and valid data. They are feasible for use in medical residencies, can detect between-faculty differences <b>and</b> <b>supply</b> potentially <b>useful</b> <b>information</b> for improving graduate medical educatio...|$|R
30|$|BI is {{a system}} of data {{conversion}} that ranges from immediate feedback to complex risk management (Wu et al. 2014). The main goal of BI implementation is to facilitate interactions between data management and information sharing to help analysts and managers with both analysis and task execution (Turban et al. 2010; Elbashir et al. 2013). Proactive BI includes real-time data warehousing, data mining, automated anomaly and exception detection, proactive alerting with automatic recipient determination, seamless follow-through workflow, automatic learning and refinement, geographic information systems and data visualization (Langseth and Vivatrat 2003). Consequently, BI systems combine data gathering, storage, access, analysis and knowledge management with analytical tools to present complex internal and competitive information for planners and decision-makers (Watson 2009; Yeoh and Koronios 2010), and thus help them make better and faster decisions (Mikroyannidis and Theodoulidis 2010; Chaudhuri et al. 2011).

40|$|Turfgrass wear {{effects are}} known to be the sum of soil {{compaction}} and plant tissue injury. As such, tissue intrinsic resistance to several mechanical factors, including traction stress, is a decisive in determining the wear resistance of a turfgrass species. Wear simulation in the field can suffer from climate, soil and machinery operator error, and is always inclusive of the soil compaction factor {{that is one of the}} origins of turfgrass wear effects in the field. Lignin, dry matter, starch, sugars and silica are some of the tissue constituents and characteristics that have been associated with leaf and stem mechanical resistance, while little information is to be found concerning stolons and rhizomes. These organs not only enable C 4 turfgrass species lateral growth, soil colonization and injury recovery, but are also key constituents of mature swards. A firsts study consisted in an extensive investigation on the effective leaf, rhizome traction resistance of Cynodon dactylon L.  Pers. var. dactylon x C. transvaalensis Burt-Davy cv. Tifway 419 (Cdxt), Zoysia matrella (L.) Merr. Cv. Zeon (Zm) and Paspalum vaginatum Swartz. cv. Salam (Pv), as measured with a FIFA-approved dynamometer, and correlating these results with laboratory investigations on key tissue constituents. Several aspects emerged from the present work that can be summarized as follows: 1. Tensile strength tests on leaf, rhizome and stolon tissues of Cdxt, Zm <b>and</b> Pv can <b>supply</b> <b>useful</b> <b>information</b> regarding these species’ starch, sugars, dry matter, lignin and silica content. 2. Tensile strength was more influenced by tissue constituents than by tissue dimension. 3. The results of tensile strength tests are in accordance with these species’ wear resistance as tested in previous work, with Zm stronger than Cdxt and Pv. 3. In rhizomes and stolons, tissue breakage usually occurs in the area at the intercalary meristem at the apical zone in the immediate proximity of a node. 4. Older tissues have higher tensile strength thanks to their higher lignification. 5. Starch and sugars content found in tissues is in accordance with the species’ previously observed linear growth rate, with Cdxt faster than Pv and Zm. 6. Starch content is generally inversely proportional to lignin content. 7. Stolon TSS content, and glucose in general, is a clear marker of tissue mechanical strength. 8. Lignin is the principle constituent in determining tissue tensile strength, and as such it could be used as a turfgrass wear resistance predictor in the cultivar breeding stages. 9. Silica is a constituent undermining tissue tensile strength. 10. Leaves are the plant organs with the highest silicization and the lowest lignification of tissues. A second study consisted of testing slabs of mature canopies of the same species for wear resistance in laboratory with a Lisport machine, as adopted by FIFA for artificial turf testing. Worn slabs of turfgrass were then allowed to recover in greenhouse to fathom out percent recovery of shoots. The results of these investigations were once again plotted again laboratory investigations on key tissue constituents. Several aspects emerged from this second work that can be summarized as follows: 1. The Lisport machine can be successfully used in an effective and reproducible way to fathom out natural turfgrass wear resistance, devoid of soil compaction effects. 2. Wear resistance for C 4 species as observed in the field does not necessarily coincide with the relative tissue intrinsic resistance, but rather with the initial canopy density. 3. C 4 species show a wear resistance that is much higher than C 3 species. 4. C 3 species show a virtually nil recuperative capability (mainly due to the lack of vegetative propagation organs). 5. The species with a very high intrinsic (tissue) wear resistance are also the species with the slowest recuperation potential. This seems to be due to lower levels of starch and TSS available for recovery. 6. Starch was a clear marker of wear resistance (negatively correlated) and recovery (positively correlated). 7. Silica was a marker positively correlated with wear resistance. 8. Lignin was the clearest marker found to be positively correlated with wear resistance. 9. A more severe wear induces a higher percentage of shoot recovery, and this particular aspects deserves further investigation...|$|R

The paper evaluates and models four aspects of SPP [...] 1000 performance: scheduling, local-memory, shared-memory, and synchronization. Our evaluation and modeling are intended to <b>supply</b> <b>useful</b> <b>information</b> for application <b>and</b> compiler development. 1 Introduction A distributed-memory multiprocessor is a scalable shared-memory parallel processor that uses a high-bandwidth, low-latency interconnection network to connect processing nodes which contain processors and memory [1]. The interconnection network provides the communication channels through which nodes exchange data and coordinate their work in solving a parallel [...] ...|$|R
