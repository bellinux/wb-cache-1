5|$|F.C. United {{hosted a}} test event on 16 May 2015, staging a short match between their first team and an Invitational XI {{made up of}} past players. This event was {{organized}} to test the facilities and prove that the stadium can hold a large capacity crowd, and took place with 3,241 supporters in attendance. The official opening game was a friendly between F.C. United of Manchester and Benfica B on 29 May, the anniversary of Manchester United's victory over Benfica in the 1968 European Cup Final. The date <b>also</b> <b>happened</b> to be {{the anniversary of the}} death of Ronald Johnson. Benfica won the opening game 0–1 in front of a crowd of 4,232. The ground's first league game was on 11 August 2015, the second match of the 2015–16 season for F.C. United, in a National League North local derby against Stockport County, a 1–2 loss.|$|E

5|$|Hoodwinked! {{was shown}} to {{potential}} distributors throughout various stages of its production. Though a distribution offer was made by DreamWorks, it was turned down as the filmmakers {{did not feel that}} it was a good deal. As the film neared the end of production, it was screened at the Cannes Film Festival. Harvey and Bob Weinstein were also at the festival at the time, screening Robert Rodriguez's film Sin City, which they were distributing through their then newly formed studio, The Weinstein Company. They decided to pick Hoodwinked! up for distribution after it was brought to their attention by Rodriguez's wife, whose attorney <b>also</b> <b>happened</b> to work for Blue Yonder Films.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the growing Confederate activity in the area, Grant decided to dispatch troops from the Vicksburg trenches across the river. The presence of Maj. Gen. John G. Walker's Confederate division on the Louisiana side was of particular concern; its presence could possibly aid a Confederate escape from Vicksburg. Therefore, Brig. Gen. Alfred W. Ellet's Mississippi Marine Brigade and Joseph A. Mower's brigade from Sherman's corps were ordered to the vicinity of Milliken's Bend. Mower and Ellet were to cooperate against Walker's division, which was stationed {{in the vicinity of}} Richmond, Louisiana. Richmond <b>also</b> <b>happened</b> to be an important supply line providing Vicksburg with food from Louisiana. On June 15, Ellet and Mower defeated Walker and destroyed Richmond, Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|The {{meeting at}} Aintree had been beset by {{problems}} before the race. Fifteen animal rights protesters invaded the course near the first fence (as had <b>also</b> <b>happened</b> at the 1991 Grand National) {{resulting in a}} delayed start. A first false start was caused by several riders becoming tangled in the starting tape. Starter Keith Brown, who was officiating his last National before retirement, waved his red recall flag and a second official, Ken Evans, who was situated 100 yards further down the track, in turn signalled to the leading runners to turn around. At the second attempt, the tape became tangled again — {{around the neck of}} jockey Richard Dunwoody — and Brown called another false start. However, this time his recall flag did not unfurl as he waved it. As a result, 30 of the 39 riders set off around the track, oblivious to the recall.|$|E

5|$|In {{the month}} of July, Davis had three home runs robbed from him, {{more than any other}} Major Leaguer the entire year. On July 28 against the Atlanta Braves, Davis hit two home runs and drove in 5 runs. It was his tenth career multi-home run game and third of the 2015 season. On July 30, in a game against the Detroit Tigers, Davis hit his 25th home run of the year, which {{happened}} to be his 83rd career home run at Oriole Park, which gave him sole possession of 6th place on the stadium's all-time home run list. On August 5, Davis hit his sixth career grand slam and second of the season in the tenth inning in a game against the Oakland Athletics, which helped lift Baltimore to a 7-3 victory. Ten days later, Davis hit a walk-off solo home run against the A's in Baltimore. It was his second home run of the night and number thirty-four on the year. On September 3, Davis hit a walk off solo home run to help the O's end a six-game losing skid. It was his thirty-eighth of the year. It was also his 152nd with the Orioles, giving him sole possession of eleventh place on the franchise's all-time list. The home run <b>also</b> <b>happened</b> to be his 90th career home run at OPACY, now giving him sole possession of fourth on the stadium's all-time list. On September 4, Davis became the first Orioles player to have back-to-back multi-home run games since 2009. In addition, he became the first Orioles player ever with multiple 40-home-run seasons (hit 53 in 2013). That game, against Toronto, became his sixth multi-homer game of the year and the thirteenth of his career. Davis led the majors in home runs with 47. This made Davis the only Orioles hitter to ever have two seasons with 40+ homers (53 in 2013 & 47 in 2015).|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, on {{the evening}} of the 10th, around 22:00, French {{reconnaissance}} elements using Panhard 178 armoured cars had started to arrive at the Dutch border, forming a vanguard for the French 1st Mechanised Light Division. This division operated, with the 25e DIM on its left, on the northern flank of the French 7th Army; its mission was to ensure contact between the Vesting Holland and Antwerp. Attempts to coordinate the French advance with Colonel Leonard Johannes Schmidt, the military commander of the Dutch troops on Noord-Brabant, were largely unsuccessful as, apart from the fact he could not be reached that day, Dutch defences there were already collapsing. At Mill, 256. Infanteriedivision at first could not exploit the opportunity offered by having a battalion {{in the back of the}} defenders because it failed to locate it. When a first attack by forward elements had been repulsed, a full assault at the Main Defense Line was initially postponed to the next day because most artillery had not yet passed the single pontoon bridge over the Meuse, which had caused a traffic jam after having been damaged by an incident. In the early evening in a sudden change of plans it was decided to attack even though artillery support was absent apart from one 105mm battery. An unrequested Stuka attack that <b>also</b> <b>happened</b> to hit the Mill sector just prior to the advance routed some Dutch defenders, creating a weak section in the line from which the Dutch troops were dislodged. Though the Germans were slow to exploit the breakthrough, Colonel Schmidt at 20:30 ordered the Peel-Raam Position to be abandoned and his troops to fall back to the west improvising a new line at the Zuid-Willemsvaart canal.|$|E
