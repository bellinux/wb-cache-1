40|$|Abstract: In {{early stages}} of {{speciation}} with gene flow, divergent selection creates genomic regions with elevated levels of differentiation (outlier regions) interspersed by larger genomic regions that are homogenized by gene flow. Ecologically divergent, but interfertile oaks show such a pattern of genomic divergence and thus provide a system to identify outlier regions. The availability of a reference genome in oaks {{in the near future}} will allows us to anchor these outlier regions to the genome sequence and to identify genes with putative role in adaptive divergence and reproductive isolation between species. Current advances in outlier screens in oaks with specific emphasis on <b>American</b> <b>red</b> <b>oaks</b> (section Lobatae), and comparative outliers across oak sections are reviewed. In addition, strategies are outlined to test for associations of nucleotide variation in putative outlier loci with adaptive traits that are involved in adaptive species divergence and reproductive isolation...|$|R

40|$|To {{manage and}} control Phytophthora ramorum successfully, it is {{important}} to know the amount of phenotypic variation within a given pathogen population. Because the pathogen has only recently been described, there are few studies on morphological and pathological variation of isolates from the United States. One study has compared growth rate on agar, aggressiveness to Quercus rubra (Eastern <b>American</b> <b>red</b> <b>oak),</b> and developmental stability of European and U. S. isolates. In this study, the U. S. isolates were significantly slower growing, less aggressive, morphologically more unstable, and had a larger range in growth rates than the European isolates (Brasier and others unpublished data; Brasier 2003; Brasier and others, this Proceedings). However, there is no information on fungicide tolerance, spore production or aggressiveness to hosts from the western United States to U. S. isolates. This study examines these phenotypic characters among 12 isolates from a broad range of hosts, locations within California and Oregon, and AFLP genotypes. We examine variation in aggressiveness of isolate populations from California. Additionally, we determined whether measurement of lesions on inoculated coast live oak stems is a good measure of pathogenicity...|$|E
40|$|Oaks {{provide a}} model system to study {{maintenance}} of species identity by divergent selection since they maintain morphological differences and ecological adaptations despite interspecific hybridization. The genome of closely related interfertile oak species {{was shown to}} be largely homogeneous, with a few genomic areas exhibiting high interspecific differentiation possibly as result of strong divergent selection. Previously, a genic microsatellite was identified as under strong divergent selection, being nearly fixed on alternative alleles in the two interfertile North <b>American</b> <b>red</b> <b>oak</b> species: Quercus rubra L. and Quercus ellipsoidalis E. J. Hill. Further genotyping in two other red oak species—Quercus velutina Lam. and Quercus coccinea Münchh. —revealed a similar bias for the Q. ellipsoidalis-specific allele. To further elucidate {{the basis of this}} differentiation, we sequenced the microsatellite in individuals from all four red oak species. Sequence variability was observed in the microsatellite motif which encodes a poly-Q repeat in a COL gene involved in phenology and growth. Furthermore, in neighboring (parapatric) Q. rubra/Q. ellipsoidalis populations, introgression of the Q. ellipsoidalis-specific allele into Q. rubra occurred at a lower rate than introgression of the Q. rubra-specific allele into Q. ellipsoidalis despite symmetric interspecific gene flow, indicating potential adaptive introgression. Introgression of adaptive alleles can be an important mechanism for rapid adaptation to new environmental conditions (e. g., climate change) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate K, Ca, and Mg immobilization in the stem of species typical of the hardwood forest of southern Quebec. The species examined included American basswood, sugar maple, and white ash from a rich site, and <b>American</b> beech, <b>red</b> <b>oak,</b> and <b>red</b> maple from a poor site. Firstly, rates of immobilization were evaluated over a time span of 40 years. Higher rates of immobilization in the wood only were generally observed on the rich site. Sugar maple immobilized Ca at an elevated rate during 1978 [...] 1997, in comparison to the other species on site. In the case of Ca for white ash, and Ca and Mg for <b>red</b> <b>oak,</b> a low wood element concentration and a high rate of growth was associated with a low rate of immobilization. Mean annual immobilization rates on a whole stem basis were also determined for the life of the tree. These results suggest that <b>American</b> basswood and <b>red</b> <b>oak</b> immobilize significant amounts of Mg and Ca in their bark, respectively. In a second study, concentrations of K, Ca, and Mg across the radial section of the stem (heartwood, transitional, sapwood, and bark) were determined.

40|$|The {{responses}} of rodent populations to acorn masting were examined by reviewing 17 studies from {{the aspect of}} acorn nutrients and defensive chemicals. Oak species were grouped into three types based on their acorn nutritional characteristics by cluster analysis: Type 1 acorns (two North <b>American</b> <b>red</b> <b>oaks,</b> subgenus Erythrobalanus) were high in tannins and high in fat and proteins (and consequently rich in metabolizable energy); Type 2 acorns (two Japanese evergreen oaks, Cyclobalanopsis; three Japanese deciduous oaks, Lepidobalanus; one North American white oak, Lepidobalanus) were high in tannins but low in fat and proteins; and Type 3 acorns (one Cyclobalanopsis species; seven Lepidobalanus species) were low in tannins and had intermediate levels of fat and proteins. These three acorn groups were nutritionally, and thereby ecologically, not equivalent. Rodents, in general, responded differently to acorn masting depending on their feeding habits and the nutritional characteristics of acorns. Granivorous rodents showed positive responses to masting of Type 1 and 3 acorns, whereas rodents with feeding habits intermediate between granivory and herbivory showed positive responses to masting of Type 3 acorns. In addition, for herbivorous rodents, the responses to masting of any types of acorns have not been reported. The present findings emphasize {{that the relationship between}} rodents and acorn masting should not easily be generalized, because there are large variations in characteristics of both acorns and rodents. The viewpoint presented in this review could offer more convincing interpretations to the contradictory observations, found in the studies reviewed, on the response of rodent populations to acorn masting...|$|R

50|$|Today oak {{powdery mildew}} {{is one of}} the most common {{diseases}} in European forests but it is thought to not always have been present in these forests. The first reports of the disease were made in Paris and other regions of France, Spain, Luxembourg and the Netherlands in 1907. By 1908 the disease had spread into many other European countries, becoming an epidemic. By 1909 it had reached Russia and Turkey, followed by Brazil in 1912 and soon after was distributed around the world. The sudden outbreak of the disease puzzled mycologists as they were unsure about the origin of the pathogen. Its anamorph was easily distinguished from Phyllactinia guttata which had previously been reported to cause powdery mildew on oaks in Europe at low intensity. It did however share morphological similarities with Oïdium quercinum, Calocladia penicillata and Microsphaera penicillata which had previously been reported to cause powdery mildew on oaks in Europe. The sudden appearance and high incidence of the disease made it unlikely that it was caused by any of these species however and instead some authors hypothesised that it was caused by the introduction of a new species from outside Europe. Powdery mildew had already been reported from North America so it was thought that the new disease could have been imported on American oaks into Europe. The absence of the disease on <b>American</b> <b>red</b> <b>oaks</b> growing in France however, made this unlikely. Four years after the initial outbreak, a teleomorph was found in south-east France which Arnaud and Fox identified as an American species, Microsphaera quercina (now included in Microsphaera alni). A detailed morphological study by Griffon and Maublanc in 1912 suggested that the species was different from all previously described species and proposed the name of Microsphaera alphitoides, referring to the floury appearance of the abundant white sporulation. This identification remained controversial until the 1940s. The origin of the disease was still uncertain however, in 1927, Raymond suggested that the disease may have been caused by a fungus identified in 1877 in Portugal that had been imported from Portuguese colonies. In 1980, Boesewinkel demonstrated that the same species was responsible for powdery mildew on Quercus robur and on a mango species from New Zealand, supporting the hypothesis that the fungus had shifted its host.|$|R

40|$|SYNOPSIS. We {{have shown}} that eastern gray {{squirrels}} and other animals consis-tently prefer to store intact acorns from the <b>red</b> <b>oak</b> group rather than those from the white oak group. We hypothesized that the ultimate advantage to this behavior comes from the dormancy of <b>red</b> <b>oak</b> acorns. Acorns of the white oak group ger-minate early in the autumn; thus, we hypothesize that avoiding germination is the primary selective advantage to the preference for caching <b>red</b> <b>oak</b> acorns. Here, we test two alternative hypotheses to explain the benefits of this caching preference: 1) storing <b>red</b> <b>oak</b> acorns allows the high tannin concentrations in <b>red</b> <b>oak</b> acorns to decline (making them more palatable), and 2) storing <b>red</b> <b>oak</b> acorns minimizes losses to insects, presuming they are less infested with insects. We also test the effect of germination schedule on squirrel caching preferences directly, by pre-senting them with dormant <b>red</b> <b>oak</b> acorns, and <b>red</b> <b>oak</b> acorns about to germinate. We find no evidence that tannin concentrations in <b>red</b> <b>oak</b> acorns decline, although tannin levels did decline in our white oak acorns. We found high losses to insect infestations in one white oak species, but a second white oak species lost very little mass to insects. Finally, we found that germination schedule directly affects squir-rel caching preferences: <b>red</b> <b>oak</b> acorns that are near germination are treated like white oak acorns. We conclude that the primary advantage to the preference for caching <b>red</b> <b>oak</b> acorns {{is that they are}} less perishable, due to their dormancy. We discuss the effects of this preference on the dispersal of <b>red</b> and white <b>oak</b> acorns, and the subsequent effects of differential dispersal on the ecology and evolution of oaks...|$|R

40|$|Summary A field {{experiment}} {{was established in}} a second-growth hardwood forest dominated by <b>red</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus rubra L.) {{to examine the effects}} of shelterwood overstory den-sity on leaf gas exchange and seedling water status of planted <b>red</b> <b>oak,</b> naturally regenerated <b>red</b> <b>oak</b> and sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) seedlings during the first growing season following harvest. Canopy cover of uncut control stands and moderate and light shelterwoods averaged 97, 80 and 49 %, re-spectively. Understory light and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) strongly influenced gas exchange responses to overstory re-duction. Increased irradiance beneath the shelterwoods signifi-cantly increased net photosynthesis (Pn) and leaf conductance to water vapor (Gwv) of <b>red</b> <b>oak</b> and maple seedlings; however, Pn and Gwv of planted and naturally regenerated <b>red</b> <b>oak</b> seed-lings were two to three times higher than those of sugar maple seedlings in both partial harvest treatments, due in large part to decreased stomatal limitation of gas exchange in <b>red</b> <b>oak</b> as a result of increased VPD in the shelterwoods. In both species, seedling water status was higher in the partial harvest treat-ments, as reflected by the higher predawn leaf water potential and seedling water-use efficiency in seedlings in shelterwoods than in uncut stands. Within a treatment, planted and natural <b>red</b> <b>oak</b> seedlings exhibited similar leaf gas exchange rates and water status, indicating little adverse physiological effect of transplanting. We conclude that the use of shelterwoods favors photosynthetic potential of <b>red</b> <b>oak</b> over sugar maple, and should improve <b>red</b> <b>oak</b> regeneration in Ontario...|$|R

40|$|Oak {{decline is}} a chronic problem inMissouri Ozark forests. Red oak group species are most {{susceptible}} and decline is reportedly more severe on droughty, nutrient-poor sites. However, {{it was not}} clear whether greater decline severity was caused by poor site conditions or is simply due to the greater abundance of <b>red</b> <b>oak</b> group species found on poorer sites. We conducted this study to determine whether oak decline severity in oak-dominated Missouri Ozark forests is related to factors strongly influencing site quality including soil, landform position, and slope-aspect. We monitored the survival of 6606 dominant or co-dominant oak trees for 10 years and surveyed crown dieback on more than 1995 oak trees during a single year to determine if mortality and the presence of decline symptoms were related to site factors. Analysis confirmed that <b>red</b> <b>oak</b> group species had more crown dieback and greater mortality than did white oak group species. We also found greater <b>red</b> <b>oak</b> mortality on upper slope positions and where soils were gravelly and low in base cations. However, the abundance of <b>red</b> <b>oaks</b> was also greater in these same locations. Further analysis showed that if the initial abundance of <b>red</b> <b>oaks</b> was included as a covariate in the model, the site factors no longer were significant effects related to oak mortality. Moreover, we found that frequency of oaks exhibiting crown dieback was the same or sometimes greater on high quality sites. These findings show that <b>red</b> <b>oak</b> mortality is more prevalent on droughty and nutrient-deficient sites because <b>red</b> <b>oak</b> group species are more abundant there.
