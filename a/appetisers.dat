However, she found that her enjoyment of the restaurant was troubled by the sheer expectation of a new Gordon Ramsay restaurant and the media campaign that preceded the opening. She gave it seven out of ten for food, atmosphere and value for money.|$|E
50|$|Morsztyn's {{major works}} are Światowa Rozkosz (Worldly Pleasure or Worldy Bliss, from 1606), Antypasty małżeńskie (Matrimonial <b>Appetisers</b> from 1650), and Summariusz wierszów (Compendium of poems), a {{collection}} of over three hundred poems, written between 1606 and 1613, but never published. Few of his original manuscripts have survived, {{and most of his}} works that we know comes from later reprints. Some of the works considered his are attributed to him based on style analysis, as they were reprinted as anonymous. In many of his trifles and songs, Morsztyn praised the beauty of the world, contrasting it with the burden of sin and with eternal bliss, but occasionally he wrote about other issues, including politics - like in his Konfederacji 1614 nagrobek (Tombstone for the 1614 confederation).|$|E

At the restaurant, the sons unload the metal cauldrons and the women serve wine and <b>appetisers</b> to the waiting guests. The guests, talking amongst themselves, begin to speak both positively and anxiously about the likely success of the restaurant, now concerned that it may draw custom away from the other restaurants in the area. Slimane's son Majid, whilst surveying the crowd, notices a bureaucrat's wife with whom he has had several illicit sexual liaisons and decides to leave quietly. He instructs his brother to tell {{the rest of the family}} that he has gone to help a friend who has broken down on the highway. The women start to heat up the food when they notice the absence of the couscous. Panic mounts when they discover that it is definitively absent and Majid, who has taken the car that still holds the metal cauldron in the trunk, is not answering his phone. Knowing that it will take at least another hour to cook a new batch, they continue to frantically call Majid and attempt to call Souad, who is out searching for an unfortunate in need of plate of couscous.

This was the last Food Truck challenge and also the largest, serving a total of 150 customers, previous Food Trucks only had 100.|$|R
40|$|The European ban of the non-therapeutic use of AGPs {{and limits}} {{in the use}} of other drugs has {{increased}} digestive disorders and mortality in growing rabbits. Researchers and farmers have to find alternative methods to control gut health and productivity of growing rabbits. Herbs, spices and their extracts (botanicals) have been demonstrated to have a wide range of activities, including animal performance and nutrient availability improvement. Plants and their extracts are used in animal nutrition as <b>appetisers,</b> digestive stimulants, stimulants of physiological functions, for prevention and treatment of certain pathological conditions, as colourants and antioxidants. Digestive effects of herbs and spices were reported mainly in laboratory animals and humans, and few studies were carried out on farmed animals. In the rabbit, the dietary inclusion of fennel seeds with oregano leaves improved the utilization of diets. Several studies on plant extracts have shown promising results as growth promoters. In the growing rabbit, the mixture of Lupinus albus L., Trigonella foenum-graecum L., and Cassia senna L. as feed additives can be considered as growth promoter. A large number of plant preparations are used as galactagogues. The most frequently used natural products to increase milk production are the anise and fenugreek in rabbit does. The antimicrobial effect derives especially from the plant volatile oils. In rabbit, a stabilizing effect on the microbiota was observed when diet was supplemented with Digestarom® or thyme oil. When diets were supplemented with thyme and spirulina, an antimicrobial effect on Bacteroides, C. coccoides, C. leptum in the caecum was noticed. The black cumin seeds proved to exert anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial and immunomodulatory effects.

40|$|The European {{ban on the}} non-therapeutic use of {{antibiotic}} growth promoters and limits {{on the use of}} other drugs have increased digestive disorders and mortality in growing rabbits. In addition, consumers demand natural products, and therefore synthetic active compounds should be replaced by natural ones. This has increased the search for alternatives, such as herbs, spices and their extracts (botanicals) as replacers. Plants (whole plants, leaves or seeds, mainly used as feedstuffs) and their extracts (considered as additives) are being increasingly used in animal nutrition as <b>appetisers,</b> digestive and physiological stimulants, colorants, and antioxidants, and for the prevention and treatment of certain pathological conditions. The digestive effects of herbs and spices have been tested primarily in humans and laboratory animals, and few trials have been performed on farm animals. Studies on the dietary inclusion of herbs and spices or their extracts in rabbit meat production are quite scarce, and the overall benefit remains unclear due to discrepancies in results, {{such as the use of}} plant preparations as galactagogues in rabbit does. Some positive results have been shown their potential, however. The dietary inclusion of Foeniculum vulgare Mill. seeds with oregano leaves has been observed to improve diet utilisation, whereas the dietary inclusion of a mixture of Lupinus albus L., Trigonella foenum-graecum L., and Cassia senna L. has acted as growth promoter. Antimicrobial effects are derived especially from plant volatile oils. In the rabbit, a stabilizing effect on microbiota was observed when the diet was supplemented with thyme oil. When diets were supplemented with thyme leaves and spirulina algae, an antimicrobial effect on Clostridium coccoides, Clostridium leptum in the caecum was observed. Black cumin seeds have been shown to exert anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial and immunomodulatory effects. Several herbs and spices (green tea, rooibos, oregano, rosemary and thyme) provide antioxidant effects through rabbit dietary supplementation or inclusion in meat and meat products. Research in the use of herbs or/and spices has demonstrated their potential as feed additives and/or antioxidants, but further research is recommended to optimize effects on rabbits before practical proposals can be drafted...|$|E
40|$|Adding {{value to}} farm produce Cue: What have sunflowers, mushrooms, pineapples and {{sugarcane}} all got in common? Yes, {{they are all}} cash crops, {{but they are also}} crops that can benefit from value addition. For example, sunflower seeds {{can be used to make}} cooking oil. Pineapples and sugarcane can be used to make juice. Adding value can be an excellent way for farmers to earn more from their crops, especially when prices for raw commodities are very low. Pius Sawa sent this report. IN:	?I?m at the Uganda National Trade ? OUT:	? Yes, juice is ready. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 53 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Richard Eboru ending that report from Uganda?s National Trade Fair. The report was compiled by Pius Sawa and comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Sawa	I?m at the Uganda National Trade Fair here at UMA showground, trying to find out how smallscale farmers are trying to penetrate the market. Akol	My names are Anna Grace Akol from Bukedea district. Sawa	Are you a farmer? Akol	Yes I am a farmer. We are growing sunflower. We started as 25 women, now we have moved to 1, 000. We were growing, the market was not there, and we were fetching very little money. So we thought of value addition. So some good project came to our area and gave us ram presses, as women groups. We paid some money for the ram presses. So we started processing. After sometime the market for oil was mad and with the ram presses we could not manage them because they are manually operated. So now we have a motorised mill whereby we are growing our sunflower and processing it into cooking oil. And we are even getting a by-product called seedcake. That seedcake we are giving it to our members, half of it we are selling it. Then this one we give to members. They use it for rearing their chicken, and the waste from the chicken, we are telling our members we should put in our gardens where we have planted our citrus fruits. Sawa	I?m here with the one of the farmers who is dealing in mushroom growing. Constantino	I?m called Omuge Constantino. We grow mushrooms, then after growing the mushrooms we do what we call collective marketing. Sawa	What type of mushroom are you dealing with? Constantino	It is home grown mushroom, the oyster type of mushroom. We sell it both fresh mushrooms, then we also sell dry mushrooms. Sawa	How do you add value to your mushrooms for you to access more market? Constantino	What we do mainly now is we harvest the fresh mushroom, we dry it, then we pack it in kaveeras with our labels. Sawa	Kaveeras are polythene bags. Constantino	Yeah, polythene bags. Malunda	I?m Mrs Malunda Violet from Kiyiinda Agro Food Enterprise. When I grow fruits then I process them. I add value, I pack them. Sawa	What type of fruits are you growing? Malunda	Pineapples, oranges, mangoes, grapes. From them we get wines, we get juices, we get passion fruit jam, we get <b>appetisers,</b> one with chilli without chilli. We pack a lot of things. We do them in season because you can?t do them at once a go. In a week we have to separate them. Some days we process wines, some days we process juices, some days we process <b>appetisers.</b> Sawa	Here on the table I can see some are in bottles, some are in plastic containers and some are in paper bags. Of these kinds which ones are most expensive? Malunda	Yeah, which are very expensive is those ones in the bottles because with the bottles, we don?t have a machine in Uganda giving us glass bottles. Sawa	We don?t have a machine in Uganda producing glass bottles? Malunda	No, it?s exported from outside which is very expensive. So we just collect bottles from Uganda which are already being used. We wash them, we sterilise them so that we can pack our products. So that?s a problem, even some of the materials are got from outside, sealing materials, seasonings. We processors are very many so sometimes you reach there to get the products when they are finished, so you have to wait until they will make another order. Sawa	Now here I?m able to find one of the farmers who has come to this exhibition. Eboru	I?m Richard Eboru. Sawa	What are you doing here? Eboru	I?m producing sugarcane juice. Sawa	Can you tell me how do you do it? Eboru	I first clean the sugarcane, then I roll it through the machine. We try to clean it before crushing out the juice. Sawa	Ok, so I can see now the sugarcane is now clean. Now you are about to take it to the machine. Eboru	This is a machine, it?s called a sugarcane crushing machine. It produces sugarcane juice. It has two motors which use power, yeah and some two stones for crushing the sugarcane which roll. Sawa	So the sugarcane is going through the two stones. So you keep on rotating the process? Eboru	Yeah, to squeeze out all the juice. Until the juice is squeezed out, that?s when I?ll throw this, when I no longer see any juice coming out. Sawa	There?s a saucepan the other end which is just collecting the juice. Eboru	Yeah, that where the juice goes. Sawa	That?s wonderful. So now that one is through you have finished that one. Eboru	Finished that one yeah. Sawa	So is the juice ready for drinking? Eboru	Yeah it is ready. Sawa	Maybe a few times we are going to test it. So for example, one sugarcane can produce how much juice? Eboru	A long sugarcane can make one and a half litres. Sawa	Just one sugar cane? Eboru	Yeah. Sawa	And how long does it take to squeeze one sugarcane? Eboru	Just like two minutes. Sawa	Two minutes. So two minutes, you are ready to make about US$ 2 of juice. Eboru	Yes, juice is ready.

50|$|The {{vegetables}} are usually diced and salted, {{followed by a}} light dressing of sunflower oil (or olive oil, which is less authentic), which are occasionally complemented by vinegar.
