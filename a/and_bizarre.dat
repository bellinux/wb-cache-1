5|$|Branham {{became more}} {{controversial}} {{in his later}} years and this was particularly evident in his development of a theology that emphasized a few select doctrines. His theology seemed complicated <b>and</b> <b>bizarre</b> to many people who admired him personally. Although not always consistent with each other, his primary concerns were eschatology, the denial of an eternal hell, Oneness Pentecostalism, predestination, eternal security and the serpent's seed. Branham asserted that his doctrinal teachings were given to him by divine revelation.|$|E
5|$|The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band (WCPAEB) was an American {{psychedelic}} {{rock band}} formed in Los Angeles, California in 1965. The group created music that possessed an eerie, {{and at times}} sinister, atmosphere, and contained material that was bluntly political, childlike, <b>and</b> <b>bizarre.</b> Representing different musical backgrounds among band members, the group, at times, resembled a traditional Byrds-esque folk rock ensemble, but the WCPAEB also, within the same body of work, recorded avant-garde music marked by multi-layered vocal harmonies.|$|E

5|$|About 1% of school-age {{children}} and adolescents have Tourette's. It was once considered a rare <b>and</b> <b>bizarre</b> syndrome, most often associated with coprolalia (the utterance of obscene words or socially inappropriate and derogatory remarks), but this symptom is present in only {{a small minority of}} people with Tourette's. The condition was named by Jean-Martin Charcot (1825–1893) on behalf of his resident, Georges Albert Édouard Brutus Gilles de la Tourette (1857–1904), a French physician and neurologist, who published an account of nine patients with Tourette's in 1885.|$|E
5|$|In {{retrospective}} {{reviews of}} the Genesis version, Dynamite Headdy has continued to receive considerable praise. Critics agreed that the game is excellent despite not receiving the same legendary status as some of Treasure's other works such as Gunstar Heroes, Ikaruga, and Radiant Silvergun. Lucas M. Thomas of IGN said the game is overload on the eyes, but it makes sense with respect to Treasure's chaotic design. Frank Provo of GameSpot noted the game's impressive graphical effects, large bosses, <b>and</b> <b>bizarre</b> premise providing {{the same level of}} excitement as Gunstar Heroes. Damien McFarren of Nintendo Life called it one of the best Treasure games of the Genesis era {{and one of the best}} platformers on the system.|$|E

25|$|The visual {{nature of}} dreams is {{generally}} highly phantasmagoric; that is, different locations and objects continuously blend into each other. The visuals (including locations, characters/people, objects/artifacts) are generally reflective of a person's memories and experiences, but conversation {{can take on}} highly exaggerated <b>and</b> <b>bizarre</b> forms. Some dreams may even tell elaborate stories wherein the dreamer enters entirely new, complex worlds and awakes with ideas, thoughts and feelings never experienced prior to the dream.|$|E

50|$|The film, written, directed, {{edited and}} {{produced}} by Kumar, is poised between elusiveness and engagement, suspicion and tenderness - at once hilarious <b>and</b> sinister, <b>bizarre</b> <b>and</b> moving, psychedelic and intensely real. A road-movie that drew {{the talents of}} a multi-national European crew whose overly ambitious Himalayan adventure was so fraught with disasters that it nearly failed.|$|R
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1986 the {{behaviour}} of Spacemen 3's drummer, Natty Brooker, {{became increasingly}} eccentric <b>and</b> <b>bizarre.</b> His refusal to wear shoes, even when playing the bass drum, led to arguments and Brooker left the band. Stewart 'Rosco' Roswell, a housemate of Pierce's and Brooker's, was recruited as the latter's replacement. Although Roswell was originally only a temporary appointment and was not a recognised drummer at the outset, he remained in the band for over a year.|$|E
25|$|Subependymal nodules are {{composed}} of abnormal, swollen glial cells <b>and</b> <b>bizarre</b> multinucleated cells which are indeterminate for glial or neuronal origin. Interposed neural tissue is not present. These nodules {{have a tendency to}} calcify as the patient ages. A nodule that markedly enhances and enlarges over time should be considered suspicious for transformation into a subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, which typically develops in the region of the foramen of Monro, in which case it is at risk of developing an obstructive hydrocephalus.|$|E
25|$|Doubts {{were soon}} {{raised about the}} {{authenticity}} of the manuscripts. Questions regarding the remarkably good condition of the scripts, their fortuitous discovery <b>and</b> <b>bizarre</b> script were raised, in particular by the Swedish missionary in Kashgar, Magnus Bäcklund who had also been approached by Islam Akhun. Hoernlé discussed this issue in his 1899 report but decided in favour of their authenticity, recounting Islam Akhun's tale of the discovery of the manuscripts and documents in the ruined sites of the ancient Kingdom of Khotan in the Taklamakan desert.|$|E

25|$|For Flight 93, {{the video}} ignores the {{mainstream}} theory of passengers crashing {{the plane to}} instead allege that it landed safely at Cleveland Hopkins Airport where it was evacuated by government personnel into an unused NASA research center. As evidence, the film contains photographs and eyewitness reports of the crash site, media reports of a corresponding <b>and</b> <b>bizarre</b> evacuation at Cleveland Hopkins Airport, oddities in the transcripts of cell-phone calls supposedly placed from the plane during the hijacking, and the sighting of the tail number of Flight 93 on an aircraft in use at a later date.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the deaths}} {{associated}} with Tasers are given a diagnosis of excited delirium, a term for a phenomenon that manifests as a combination of delirium, psychomotor agitation, anxiety, hallucinations, speech disturbances, disorientation, violent <b>and</b> <b>bizarre</b> behavior, insensitivity to pain, elevated body temperature, and increased strength. Excited delirium is associated with sudden death (usually via cardiac or respiratory arrest) particularly following the use of physical control measures, including police restraint and Tasers. Excited delirium most commonly arises in male subjects {{with a history of}} serious mental illness and/or acute or chronic drug abuse, particularly stimulant drugs such as cocaine. Alcohol withdrawal or head trauma may also contribute to the condition.|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} whether people show retrieval-induced forgetting (RIF) for <b>bizarre</b> <b>and</b> familiar actions that they performed or observed, three experiments were conducted. In Experiment 1, participants performed <b>bizarre</b> <b>and</b> familiar actions with different objects during learning (e. g., pencil: balance the pencil across the cup, sharpen the pencil). They repeatedly performed {{a set of}} the bizarre or familiar actions during retrieval practice. After a distracter task, participants’ cued recall was tested. Participants showed RIF for both <b>bizarre</b> <b>and</b> familiar actions. In Experiment 2, {{half of the participants}} performed the <b>bizarre</b> <b>and</b> familiar actions themselves; the other half observed the experimenter performing the actions. Replicating the results of Experiment 1, participants who performed the actions showed RIF for <b>bizarre</b> <b>and</b> familiar actions. In contrast, participants who observed the actions did not show RIF for either action type. Experiment 3 examined whether this lack of RIF for observed actions occurred {{due to a lack of}} active recall during retrieval practice; it did. Overall, the three experiments demonstrated RIF for both <b>bizarre</b> <b>and</b> familiar performed and observed actions. A distinctiveness account of the results is provided. <br /...|$|R
25|$|In If I'm Lucky (1946), her {{follow-up}} {{film for}} Fox {{when she was}} no longer under contract, Miranda was again fourth on the bill with her stock screen persona firmly in evidence: heavily-accented English, comic malapropisms, <b>and</b> <b>bizarre</b> hairstyles recreating her famous turbans. When Miranda's contract with 20th Century Fox expired on January 1, 1946, she decided to pursue an acting career free of studio constraints. Miranda's ambition was to play a lead role showcasing her comic skills, which she set out to do in Copacabana (1947, an independent production for United Artists with Groucho Marx). Although her films were modest hits, critics and the American public did not accept her new image.|$|E
25|$|Particularly revered among Ballard's admirers is {{his short}} story {{collection}} Vermilion Sands (1971), set in an eponymous desert resort town inhabited by forgotten starlets, insane heirs, very eccentric artists, and the merchants <b>and</b> <b>bizarre</b> servants who provide for them. Each story features peculiarly exotic technology such as cloud-carving sculptors performing {{for a party}} of eccentric onlookers, poetry-composing computers, orchids with operatic voices and egos to match, phototropic self-painting canvases, etc. In keeping with Ballard's central themes, most notably technologically mediated masochism, these tawdry and weird technologies service the dark and hidden desires and schemes of the human castaways who occupy Vermilion Sands, typically with psychologically grotesque and physically fatal results. In his introduction to Vermilion Sands, Ballard cites this as his favourite collection.|$|E
25|$|When {{the reading}} {{audience}} of superhero comic books became predominately young {{boys in the}} mid to late 1950s, the focus of Superman stories shifted toward science fiction inspired plots involving extraterrestrials, fantasy creatures, <b>and</b> <b>bizarre</b> plots. Lois' main interests in various late 1950s and 1960s stories became vying with her rival Lana Lang for Superman's affections, attempting to prove Clark Kent and Superman were one and the same or otherwise getting Superman into marriage. Superman's rationale for resisting her matrimonial desires was that marrying her would put her in increased danger from his enemies and that she could not keep his secret identity hidden. Regardless, Lois married several times in the Superman stories of this era, including to Superman imposter from Kandor, the villainous Zak-Kul and a man from the future. All these marriages were either annulled or otherwise forgotten.|$|E
