5|$|Edward made {{alliances with}} the German king, the Counts of Flanders and Guelders, and the Burgundians, who would attack France from the north. The alliances proved volatile, however, <b>and</b> <b>Edward</b> was facing trouble {{at home at}} the time, both in Wales and Scotland.

His marriage to Margaret in 1299 ended the war, but the whole affair had proven both costly and fruitless for the English.|$|E

On George's return, preparations for Edward and Alexandra's coronation in Westminster Abbey were well in hand but just {{a few days before the}} scheduled coronation in June 1902 the king became seriously ill with appendicitis. Alexandra deputised for him at a military parade, and attended the Royal Ascot races without him, in an attempt to prevent public alarm. Eventually, the coronation had to be postponed <b>and</b> <b>Edward</b> had an operation performed by Frederick Treves of the London Hospital to drain the infected appendix. After his recovery, Alexandra <b>and</b> <b>Edward</b> were crowned together in August: he by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Frederick Temple, and she by the Archbishop of York, William Dalrymple Maclagan.|$|E
