5|$|As America's {{involvement}} in World War II intensified, Motley joined the U.S. Navy in 1944 {{and was sent}} to the Great Lakes Naval Training Station. There he played for the Great Lakes Navy Bluejackets, a military team coached by Paul Brown, who was serving in the Navy during an extended leave from his job as head coach of The Ohio State University's football team. Motley played fullback and linebacker <b>at</b> <b>Great</b> Lakes, and was {{an important component of the}} team's offense and defense. The highlight of his time <b>at</b> <b>Great</b> Lakes was a 39–7 victory over Notre Dame in 1945. Motley was eligible for discharge before the game – it was the final match of the season and the last military game of World War II – but he stayed on to play. Motley put up an impressive performance, thanks in part to Brown's experimentation with a new play: a delayed handoff later called the draw play.|$|E

Collier took notes and hoped to pick up some football knowledge he could use when he returned to Paris. Brown, however, noticed Collier's dedication and brought him onto his staff as a volunteer assistant.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of Carter and Rosas' writing, vision had not been {{directly}} studied, but field observations show the animal primarily hunts by sight; above water, {{it is able to}} recognize observers <b>at</b> <b>great</b> distances. The fact that it is exclusively active during the day further suggests its eyesight should be strong, to aid in hunting and predator avoidance. In other otter species, vision is generally normal or slightly myopic, both on land and in water. The giant otter's hearing is acute and its sense of smell is excellent.|$|E
