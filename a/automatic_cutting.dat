40|$|Following the {{invention}} of an <b>automatic</b> breakbeat <b>cutting</b> algorithm {{in the style of}} early 90 s jungle, further experiments are described. These are namely, the use of more advanced techniques to control choices in the original algorithm, and new algorithms for cutting including methods based on campanology and recursion. <b>Automatic</b> breakbeat <b>cutting</b> can reduce the effort of working by hand in a sequencer with MIDI triggering of a sampler. Furthermore, the parameterisation of the process concedes newtechniques that can be awkward to implement with a sequencer, for example, cutting in septuplet demisemiquavers. To improve the original algorithm, states, whether offsets, cut sizes or repetition counts, canbe governed by Charles Ames'method of statistical feedback. Weight distributions can be changed during a phrase to give more control of cut sequence structure. These processes are investigated {{in the light of the}} output pacing and variation of cut sequences. Campanology, or change ringing, is based on a small subset of a permutation group consistingof permutations that can only swap adjacent elements in distinct pairs. When acting upon offsets into the source a fluid series of undulating cuts can be produced. Recursive cutting is an analytical test of second order cutting. It takes a base sequence of [cut length, offset] pairs and further cuts them up, producing variations on a given cut sequence. The Warp Cutter is inspired by the thought of constant stutters and rolls. Probabilities control the likelihood of simple blocks, even rolls or geometric accelerating rolls, usually at very fast repetition rates.

After that an <b>automatic</b> face <b>cutting</b> algorithm is used to extract the facial areas and then alignment mechanism using eye-brow leveling is used to mosaic them to construct the frontal face image. Lastly eyes are shifted using geometrical transformation to make it almost perfect frontal view of the face.
