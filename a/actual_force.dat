60|$|It is this {{which gives}} {{interest}} to the plans and operation of human governments. They can do little by <b>actual</b> <b>force.</b> Nearly all the power that is held, even by the most despotic executive, {{must be based on}} an adroit management of the principles of human nature, so as to lead men voluntarily to cooperate with the ruler, in his plans. Even an army could not be got into battle, in many cases, without a most ingenious arrangement, by means of which half a dozen men can drive, literally drive, as many thousands, into the very face of danger and death. The difficulty of leading men to battle must have been for a long time a very perplexing one to generals. It was at last removed by the very simple expedient of creating a greater danger behind than there is before. Without ingenuity of contrivance like this,--turning one principle of human nature against another, and making it for the momentary interest of men to act in a given way, no government could stand a year.|$|E

The impulse thus given to the air was re-delivered or passed on, not as I pass the mutton to Dr Lawrence (whose plate is almost empty), but by each particle of air passing the impulse to its neighbour; thus creating an aerial wave, or multitude of waves, which rolled away into space. Those of the waves which rolled {{in the direction of}} Mont Blanc communicated their vibrations to the more solid atoms of the mountain, these passed the motion on to each other, of course with slight--inconceivably slight--but <b>actual</b> <b>force,</b> and thus the tremor passed entirely through the mountain, out on the other side, greatly diminished in power no doubt, and right on throughout space.--Hand me the bread, Lewis, and don't sit grinning there like a Cheshire cat with tic-douloureux in its tail." ...|$|E
6000|$|Wayne easily routed {{a patrol}} of cavalry {{and drove in}} the pickets, who had been ordered to give way readily. The outpost which covered the camp defended itself more obstinately; though {{exceedingly}} galled by the riflemen. Wayne pushed forward with the Pennsylvania line, eight hundred strong, and three field-pieces, to attack it; at the first discharge of a cannon more than two thousand of the enemy emerged from their concealment, and he found too late that the whole British line was in battle array before him. To retreat was more dangerous than to go on. So thinking, with that impetuous valor which had gained him the name of [...] "Mad Anthony," [...] he ordered a charge to be sounded, and threw himself, horse and foot, with shouts upon the enemy. It was a sanguinary conflict and a desperate one, for the enemy were outflanking him right and left. Fortunately, the heaviness of the fire had awakened the suspicions of Lafayette;--it was too strong for the outpost of a rear-guard. Spurring {{to a point of}} land which commanded a view of the British camp, he discovered the <b>actual</b> <b>force</b> of the enemy, and the peril of Wayne. Galloping back, he sent word to Wayne to fall back to General Muhlenburg's brigade, which had just arrived, and was forming within half a mile of the scene of conflict. Wayne did so in good order, leaving behind him his three cannon; the horses which drew them having been killed. The whole army then retired across the morass.|$|E

60|$|Washington, {{in letters}} to the {{governor}} and to {{the speaker of the}} House of Burgesses, urged the impolicy of such a plan, with their <b>actual</b> <b>force</b> and means. The forts, he observed, ought to be within fifteen or eighteen miles of each other, that their spies might be able to keep watch over the intervening country, otherwise the Indians would pass between them unperceived, effect their ravages, and escape to the mountains, swamps, and ravines, before the troops from the forts could be assembled to pursue them. They ought each to be garrisoned with eighty or a hundred men, so as to afford detachments of sufficient strength, without leaving the garrison too weak; for the Indians are the most stealthy and patient of spies and lurkers; will lie in wait for days together about small forts of the kind, and, if they find, by some chance prisoner, that the garrison is actually weak, will first surprise and cut off its scouting parties, and then attack the fort itself. It was evident, therefore, observed he, that to garrison properly such a line of forts, would require, at least, two thousand men. And even then, a line of such extent might be broken through at one end before the other end could yield assistance. Feint attacks, also, might be made at one point, while the real attack was made at another, quite distant; and the country be overrun before its widely-posted defenders could be alarmed and concentrated. Then must be taken into consideration the immense cost of building so many forts, and the constant and consuming expense of supplies and transportation.|$|E
60|$|Take, for {{simplest}} and nearest example, {{this question}} of the stress of wind. It is not the actual power that is immeasurable, if only it would stand to be measured! Instruments could easily now be invented which would register not only a blast that could lift a sailing boat, but one that would sink a ship of the line. But, lucklessly--the blast won't pose to the instrument! nor can the instrument be adjusted to the blast. In the gale of which my friend speaks in his next letter, 26th January, a gust came down the hill above Coniston village upon two old oaks, which were well rooted in the slate rock, and some fifty or sixty feet high--the one, some twenty yards below the other. The blast tore the highest out of the ground, peeling its roots from the rock as one peels an orange--swept {{the head of the}} lower tree away with it in one ruin, and snapped the two leader branches of the upper one over the other's stump, as one would break one's cane over some people's heads, if one got the chance. In wind action of this kind the amount of <b>actual</b> <b>force</b> used is the least part of the business;--it is the suddenness of its concentration, and the lifting and twisting strength, as of a wrestler, which make the blast fatal; none of which elements of storm-power can be recognized by mechanical tests. In my friend's next letter, however, he gives us some evidence of the consistent strength of this same gale, and of the electric conditions which attended it:--the prefatory notice of his pet bird I had meant for 'Love's Meinie,' but it will help us through the grimness of our studies here.|$|E
40|$|In {{the dynamic}} {{formulation}} of holonomic and nonholonomic systems based on D'Alembert-Lagrange equation, {{the forces of}} constraints are maintained in the dynamic equations by introducing auxiliary variables, called Lagrange multipliers.

Different sets of variables {{can be used as}} generalized coordinates and accordingly, the generalized reactions associated with these generalized coordinates may not be the <b>actual</b> reaction <b>forces</b> at the joints. In rigid body dynamics, the generalized reaction <b>forces</b> and the <b>actual</b> reaction <b>forces</b> at the joints represent equipollent systems of forces since they produce the same total forces and moments at and about any point on the rigid body.
