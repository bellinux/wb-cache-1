40|$|Do {{cultural}} differences between lender and borrower affect {{the structure of}} the loan syndicate? Analyzing 8031 syndicated loans to US borrowers signed between 1986 and 2007, we find that lending shares are higher for foreign <b>arrangers</b> than domestic <b>arrangers.</b> Among foreign <b>arrangers,</b> lending shares further increase with cultural distance. We interpret this {{as a result of an}} increased moral hazard problem driven by higher information and effort costs faced by foreign <b>arrangers.</b> However, previous interactions between borrowers and <b>arrangers</b> can reduce moral hazard, hence culturally distant <b>arrangers</b> are able to form diffused syndicates...|$|R

His distinctive compositional style was the product of many influences, Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss being most crucial early in his development. The subsequent inspiration of the English folksong revival of the early 20th century, and the example of such rising modern composers as Maurice Ravel, led Holst to develop and refine an individual style.|$|E
