5|$|At the CFM Mortuary, {{the family}} will view <b>and</b> <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> body of the {{deceased}} {{in the presence of}} a coroner, who reviews the case and determines if an autopsy is required. The family will be informed of the coroner's decision and the time to claim the body for the funeral. If an autopsy is conducted and reveals that the death is unnatural, the police will conduct further investigations into the cause of death with the family's assistance. Once the investigations are complete, {{the family will}} be told to attend a coroner's inquiry at the Subordinate Courts. Only after that will they be able to claim the body.|$|E
5|$|Batman can {{investigate}} crimes such as murders, {{using his}} Detective Vision {{to reconstruct the}} crimes to locate clues <b>and</b> <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> perpetrators, or use his Tissue Scanner to investigate a victim's skin, muscle, and bones for clues. Completing the story mode unlocks a New Game Plus mode, enabling the player to replay the game {{with all of the}} gadgets, experience, abilities, and Riddler collectables that they have obtained. The completion of some tasks is reflected in the Gotham City Police Department, with thugs and supervillains becoming incarcerated, and criminal memorabilia from missions and previous games being collected in the evidence room.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Lobengula {{moved to}} the north-east, now well out of the Company's reach for the {{foreseeable}} future. However, his sickness, {{which turned out to}} be smallpox, sharply intensified and eventually killed him on 22 or 23 January 1894. With the king dead, Mjaan, the most senior of the izinDuna, took command of the Matabele. Mjaan was an old man, and his only son had been killed in the war. He wished to make peace. In late February 1894, he convened an indaba at which he and his contemporaries met with James Dawson, a trader known to them for many years, who offered the olive branch on behalf of the Company. The izinDuna unanimously accepted. They also told the trader what had happened to the Shangani Patrol, and led him to the battle site to survey it, as well as to examine <b>and</b> <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> largely skeletonised bodies of the soldiers, which still lay where they had fallen. Dawson was the first non-Matabele to learn of the last stand.|$|E
5|$|Note, while column {{triplets}} {{are used}} to construct <b>and</b> <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> equivalence classes, the class members themselves are the valid Band1 permutations: class size (Sb.z) reflects column triplet permutations compatible with the One Rule solution requirements. Counting symmetry is a completion property and applies only to a partial grid (band or stack). Solution symmetry for preserving solutions {{can be applied to}} either partial grids (bands, stacks) or full grid solutions. Lastly note, counting symmetry is more restrictive than simple numeric completion count equality: two (distinct) bands belong to the same counting symmetry equivalence class only if they impose equivalent completion constraints.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is played}} from a third-person perspective, focuses on Batman's combat and stealth abilities, detective skills, and gadgets for combat and exploration. Aside from the main story, Batman can help the police deal with crimes, and confront other supervillains terrorizing the city. Arkham Origins {{introduces}} the ability for Batman to virtually recreate crimes, allowing him to investigate the scene <b>and</b> <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> culprit. The game {{is the first in}} the series with multiplayer capability. WB Games Montréal took over development duties for Arkham Origins from series creators Rocksteady Studios.|$|E

5|$|The hybrid {{program has}} been criticized, with one of Sulimov's colleagues {{pointing}} out that in other tests the Laika performed {{just as well as}} the jackal hybrids. The assumption that dogs have lost some of their scent-detection ability may be incorrect, in that dogs {{need to be able to}} scent-detect <b>and</b> <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> many humans that they come into contact with in their domesticated environment. Another researcher crossed German Shepherds with wolves and claimed that this hybrid had superior scent-detection abilities. The scientific evidence to support the claims of hybrid researchers is minimal, and more research has been called for.|$|E
