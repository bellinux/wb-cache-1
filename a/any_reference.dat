5|$|No {{surviving}} list {{of bishops}} or dioceses under the Archbishop of Uppsala from 1164, 1189, 1192, 1233, 1241 or 1248 contains <b>any</b> <b>reference</b> to Finland, neither factual or propagandist. No claim about a Swedish bishop in Finland {{is made in}} any other source from the era prior to the so-called Second Swedish Crusade in 1249.|$|E
5|$|Further {{coordination}} in {{the form}} of a General Managers' Conference faltered after Selbie withdrew in 1911 when the Central London Railway, without <b>any</b> <b>reference</b> to the conference, set its season ticket prices significantly lower than those on the Met's competitive routes. Suggestions of merger with the Underground Group were rejected by Selbie, a press release of November 1912 noting the Met's interests in areas outside London, its relationships with main-line railways and its freight business.|$|E

5|$|Since NASA's Space Shuttle {{program had}} not been launched, Derek Meddings and his miniatures team had to create the rocket launch footage without <b>any</b> <b>reference.</b> Shuttle models {{attached}} to bottle rockets and signal flares were used for take-off, and the smoke trail was created with salt that fell from the models. The space scenes were done by rewinding the camera after an element was shot, enabling other elements to be superimposed in the film stock, with the space battle needing up to forty rewinds to incorporate everything.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, Lugosi was not {{prone to}} fits of swearing, {{particularly}} {{in front of}} women and did not perform his own water stunt in Bride of the Monster. Lugosi is also depicted as dying alone and miserable. Lugosi's wife of twenty years, Lillian, did leave him in 1953, but he remarried in 1955 to Hope Lininger. They were together until his death a year later. This, plus <b>any</b> <b>reference</b> to Lugosi's teenage son, Bela G. Lugosi, were omitted, as is any mention of Lugosi's role in the 1956 United Artists film The Black Sleep. Also, when Ed Wood talks to George Weiss about making I Changed My Sex!, Weiss mentions Chained Girls, implying that Chained Girls was made before Glen or Glenda, when in fact Chained Girls was made afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Lands {{that were}} exempt from taxes were called manya and {{sometimes}} consisted of several villages. They were granted by local chieftains without <b>any</b> <b>reference</b> to the overlord, indicating a de-centralised economy. These lands, often given to heroes who {{perished in the}} line of duty were called bilavritti or kalnad. When such a grant was made for the maintenance of temples at the time of consecration, it was called Talavritti. Some types of taxes on income were kara or anthakara (internal taxes), utkota (gifts due to the king), hiranya (cash payments) and sulika (tolls and duties on imported items). Taxes were collected from those who held the right to cultivate land; even if the land was not actually cultivated.|$|E

5|$|The Communist Party {{strongly}} supported {{the restoration of}} Alexandrov's melody, but some members proposed other changes to the anthem. In March 2010, Boris Kashin, a CPRF member of the Duma, advocated {{for the removal of}} <b>any</b> <b>reference</b> to God in the anthem. Kashin's suggestion was also supported by Alexander Nikonov, a journalist with SPID-INFO and an avowed atheist. Nikonov argued that religion should be a private matter and should not be used by the state. Kashin found that the cost for making a new anthem recording will be about 120,000rubles. The Russian Government quickly rejected the request because it lacked statistical data and other findings. Nikonov asked the Constitutional Court of Russia in 2005 if the lyrics were compatible with Russian law.|$|E
5|$|The Western Ganga {{rule was}} a period of brisk {{literary}} activity in Sanskrit and Kannada, though many of the writings are now considered extinct and are known only from references made to them. Chavundaraya's writing, Chavundaraya Purana (or Trishashtilakshana mahapurana) of 978 CE, is an early existing work in prose style in Kannada and contains a summary of the Sanskrit writings, Adipurana and Uttarapurana which were written a century earlier by Jinasena and Gunabhadra during the rule of Rashtrakuta Amoghavarsha I. The prose, composed in lucid Kannada, was mainly meant for the common man and avoided <b>any</b> <b>reference</b> to complicated elements of Jain doctrines and philosophy. His writings seem to be influenced by the writings of his predecessor Adikavi Pampa and contemporary Ranna. The work narrates the legends of a total of 63 Jain proponents including twenty-four Jain Tirthankar, twelve Chakravartis, nine Balabhadras, nine Narayanas and nine Pratinarayanas.|$|E
5|$|The {{absence of}} <b>any</b> <b>reference</b> to a Davidic son-ship {{in the gospel}} text {{suggests}} that Jesus has been elected to be the end-time prophet, the Chosen One, sent to abolish the Jewish sacrifices. The Prophet-Christology of the gospel text quoted by Epiphanius is more {{at home with the}} Clementine literature than the Christology of the Ebionites known to Irenaeus. According to scholars Richard Bauckham and Petri Luomanen, Jesus is understood in this gospel as having come to abolish the sacrifices rather than substituting for them; thus it is unlikely that it contained the same institution of the Eucharist as practiced by Nicene orthodox Christianity. However, scholars have yet to reach a consensus over the sacrificial significance of Jesus' mission as depicted in the Ebionite gospel.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea of a}} sonic {{weapon was}} one which had been unsuccessfully pioneered by German {{scientists}} {{under the control of}} Albert Speer during World War II. A book that Tintin examines in Professor Topolino's house, German Research in World War II by Leslie E. Simon– a retired Major General in the US Army– really existed and was published in 1947. In the strip, Hergé preserved the English language title of the book rather than translating it into French, although altered the book's cover design to remove a prominent swastika. The inclusion of the book {{is one of the few}} instances that there is <b>any</b> <b>reference</b> to the Second World War within The Adventures of Tintin.|$|E

25|$|The legal {{consequences}} of a civil partnership are identical to those of a marriage under the Marriage Act, except for such changes as are required by the context. <b>Any</b> <b>reference</b> to marriage in any law, including the common law, is deemed to include civil partnership {{in terms of the}} Civil Union Act; similarly, <b>any</b> <b>reference</b> to husband, wife or spouse in any law is deemed to include a civil partner. The law of divorce for civil partnerships is the same as that for marriage.|$|E

50|$|Destroying {{an object}} will cause <b>any</b> <b>references</b> {{to the object}} to become invalid, and in manual memory {{management}} <b>any</b> existing <b>references</b> become dangling references. In garbage collection (both tracing garbage collection and reference counting), objects are only destroyed {{when there are no}} references to them, but finalization may create new references to the object, and to prevent dangling references, object resurrection occurs so the references remain valid.|$|R

25|$|Couples marrying {{in terms}} of the Civil Union Act may choose whether their union is {{registered}} as a marriage or a civil partnership. In either case, the legal consequences are identical to those of a marriage under the Marriage Act, except for such changes as are required by the context. <b>Any</b> <b>reference</b> to marriage in any law, including the common law, is deemed to include a marriage or civil partnership {{in terms of}} the Civil Union Act; similarly, <b>any</b> <b>reference</b> to husband, wife or spouse in any law is deemed to include a reference to a spouse or civil partner {{in terms of the}} Civil Union Act.|$|E
