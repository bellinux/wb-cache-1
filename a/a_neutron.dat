5|$|<b>A</b> <b>neutron</b> star is {{a highly}} dense remnant of a star that is {{primarily}} composed of neutrons—a particle that is found in most atomic nuclei and has no net electrical charge. The mass of <b>a</b> <b>neutron</b> star is {{in the range of}} 1.2 to 2.1 times the mass of the Sun. As a result of the collapse, a newly formed neutron star can have a very rapid rate of rotation; on the order of a hundred rotations per second.|$|E
5|$|Beta decay (and {{electron}} capture): {{these processes}} are {{regulated by the}} weak force, and result from a transformation of <b>a</b> <b>neutron</b> into a proton, or a proton into <b>a</b> <b>neutron.</b> The neutron to proton transition is accompanied by the emission of an electron and an antineutrino, while proton to neutron transition (except in electron capture) causes the emission of a positron and a neutrino. The electron or positron emissions are called beta particles. Beta decay either increases or decreases the atomic number of the nucleus by one. Electron capture is more common than positron emission, because it requires less energy. In this type of decay, an electron is absorbed by the nucleus, rather than a positron emitted from the nucleus. A neutrino is still emitted in this process, and a proton changes to <b>a</b> <b>neutron.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cadmium {{is created}} via the s-process in low- to medium-mass stars with masses of 0.6 to 10 solar masses, over {{thousands}} of years. In that process, a silver atom captures <b>a</b> <b>neutron</b> and then undergoes beta decay.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> {{fission energy}} <b>neutron</b> that has slowed down {{but not yet}} reached thermal {{energies}} is called <b>an</b> epithermal <b>neutron.</b>|$|R
50|$|Fast fission is fission {{that occurs}} when a heavy atom absorbs <b>a</b> high-energy <b>neutron,</b> called <b>a</b> fast <b>neutron,</b> and splits. Most {{fissionable}} materials need thermal neutrons, which move more slowly.|$|R
50|$|Only 57 stable nuclides have <b>an</b> odd <b>neutron</b> number, {{compared}} to 200 with <b>an</b> even <b>neutron</b> number. No odd-neutron-number isotope {{is the most}} naturally abundant isotope in its element, except for beryllium-9 {{which is the only}} stable beryllium isotope, nitrogen-14, and platinum-195.|$|R

5|$|On August 6, 1981 President Reagan {{ordered the}} {{development}} of <b>a</b> <b>neutron</b> bomb. While contentious, this had the desired effect of bringing the Soviets to the bargaining table, and negotiations on limiting nuclear weapons in Europe started on November 30.|$|E

5000|$|<b>A</b> fast <b>neutron</b> is <b>a</b> free <b>neutron</b> with <b>a</b> {{kinetic energy}} level close to 1 MeV (100 TJ/kg), hence {{a speed of}} 14,000 km/s, or higher. They are named fast {{neutrons}} to distinguish them from lower-energy thermal neutrons, and high-energy neutrons produced in cosmic showers or accelerators.|$|R
25|$|LiH, {{especially}} lithium-7 deuteride, {{is a good}} moderator {{for nuclear}} reactors, because deuterium has <b>a</b> lower <b>neutron</b> absorption cross-section than aneutronic hydrogen, decreasing <b>neutron</b> absorption in <b>a</b> reactor. Lithium-7 is preferred for a moderator because it has <b>a</b> lower <b>neutron</b> cross-section and also forms less tritium under neutron bombardment.|$|R
5|$|Pontecorvo created <b>a</b> <b>neutron</b> source using radium and beryllium, as the Via Panisperna boys had, with {{paraffin}} wax as <b>a</b> <b>neutron</b> moderator, and measured {{the absorption of}} different minerals using methods developed by Fermi and Amaldi. By June 1941, he had a device that could differentiate shale, limestone and sandstone, and map the transitions between them. The technique may be considered the first practical application {{of the discovery of}} slow neutrons, and would still be in use decades later for well logging. He filed four patents relating to his instrumentation.|$|E
5|$|The alpha {{particles}} {{emitted by}} polonium {{can be converted}} to neutrons using beryllium oxide, at a rate of 93 neutrons per million alpha particles. Thus Po-BeO mixtures or alloys are used as <b>a</b> <b>neutron</b> source, for example, in <b>a</b> <b>neutron</b> trigger or initiator for nuclear weapons and for inspections of oil wells. About 1500 sources of this type, with an individual activity of , have been used annually in the Soviet Union.|$|E

The sensor system utilizes {{a new class}} of boron-carbide diode that interacts with incoming neutrons. To interface with the boron-carbide diode an integrated front-end is designed in a 1. 5 /spl mu/m standard CMOS technology. With the diode and front-end microchip, <b>a</b> hand-held <b>neutron</b> detection system was realized with an embedded microcontroller for realtime processing. The hand-held detector operation was then tested with <b>a</b> plutonium-beryllium <b>neutron</b> source. Testing results confirm the validity of the approach and the functionality of the design...|$|R
50|$|Using U-235 as an example, this nucleus absorbs thermal neutrons, and the {{immediate}} mass products of a fission event are two large fission fragments, which are {{remnants of the}} formed U-236 nucleus. These fragments emit two or three free neutrons (2.5 on average), called prompt <b>neutrons.</b> <b>A</b> subsequent fission fragment occasionally undergoes a stage of radioactive decay that yields <b>an</b> additional <b>neutron,</b> called <b>a</b> delayed <b>neutron.</b> These neutron-emitting fission fragments are called delayed neutron precursor atoms.|$|R

5|$|Actinium-227 {{is used as}} <b>a</b> <b>neutron</b> source. Its high {{specific}} energy (14.5 W/g) {{and the possibility of}} obtaining significant quantities of thermally stable compounds are attractive for use in long-lasting thermoelectric generators for remote use. 228Ac is used as an indicator of radioactivity in chemical research, as it emits high-energy electrons (2.18 MeV) that can be easily detected. 228Ac-228Ra mixtures are widely used as an intense gamma-source in industry and medicine.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Allison became {{involved}} in defence-related work. He was {{a consultant to the}} National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) from October 1940 to January 1941. In January 1941 the NDRC let him a contract to study the possibility of using beryllium as <b>a</b> <b>neutron</b> moderator. The team he assembled in Chicago would grow into the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} Hanford Site {{started up the}} B Reactor, {{the first of its}} three reactors, on September 15, 1944, Wheeler had been {{concerned}} that some nuclear fission products {{might turn out to be}} nuclear poisons, the accumulation of which would impede the ongoing nuclear chain reaction by absorbing many of the thermal neutrons that were needed to continue a chain reaction. In an April 1942 report, he predicted that this would reduce the reactivity by less than one percent so long as no fission product had <b>a</b> <b>neutron</b> capture cross section of more than 100,000 barns. After the reactor unexpectedly shut down, and then just as unexpectedly restarted about fifteen hours later, he suspected iodine-135, with a half life of 6.6 hours, and its daughter product, xenon-135, which has a half life of 9.2 hours. Xenon-135 turned out to have <b>a</b> <b>neutron</b> capture cross-section of well over 2 million barns. The problem was corrected by adding additional fuel rods to burn out the poison.|$|E

5|$|Heavy metals {{condense}} in planets as {{a result}} of stellar evolution and destruction processes. Stars lose much of their mass when it is ejected late in their lifetimes, and sometimes thereafter {{as a result}} of <b>a</b> <b>neutron</b> star merger, thereby increasing the abundance of elements heavier than helium in the interstellar medium. When gravitational attraction causes this matter to coalesce and collapse new stars and planets are formed.|$|E
5|$|In nuclear {{applications}} where graphite {{is used as}} <b>a</b> <b>neutron</b> moderator, {{accumulation of}} Wigner energy followed by a sudden, spontaneous release may occur. Annealing to at least 250°C can release the energy safely, although in the Windscale fire the procedure went wrong, causing other reactor materials to combust.|$|E
5|$|Lithium-6 {{is valued}} {{as a source}} {{material}} for tritium production and as <b>a</b> <b>neutron</b> absorber in nuclear fusion. Natural lithium contains about 7.5% lithium-6 from which large amounts of lithium-6 have been produced by isotope separation for use in nuclear weapons. Lithium-7 gained interest for use in nuclear reactor coolants.|$|E

5|$|Neutrons {{from the}} fission of {{uranium-235}} are captured by uranium-238 nuclei to form uranium-239; a beta decay converts <b>a</b> <b>neutron</b> into a proton to form neptunium-239 (half-life 2.36days) and another beta decay forms plutonium-239.
