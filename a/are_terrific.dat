500|$|James Poniewozik of Time reacted {{positively}} to the episode, exclaiming that it [...] "paints a thoroughly convincing postapocalyptic world, both visually and emotionally." [...] Variety Brian Lowry avouched that [...] "Days Gone Bye" [...] was [...] "surprisingly fresh", despite having initial thoughts of a stale premise. He wrote: [...] "The Walking Dead draws {{the audience in}} almost instantly with its cinematic 90-minute pilot, then incorporates tasty soap-like elements meant to animate the ensuing episodes. Although we've seen no shortage of zombies and post-apocalyptic stories, producer-writer-director Frank Darabont has deftly tackled the seemingly perilous task of adapting a comic book about zombies into a viable episodic series." [...] In a {{three out of four}} star review, Linda Stasi of New York Post summarized, [...] "The zombies are truly scary and disgusting. The survivors <b>are</b> <b>terrific</b> characters, and the gore is enough for any lunatic to love." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Gizmodo {{concluded}} {{it to be}} [...] "our favorite MacBook to date," [...] {{they did}} claim, at this time, its display was inferior to that found on the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air, alleging a smaller viewing angle, washed-out colors, and dimmer backlighting. Similarly, AppleInsider and Engadget concluded it [...] "may well be Apple's best MacBook to date" [...] and [...] "these <b>are</b> <b>terrific</b> choices—not only from an industrial design standpoint, but in specs as well" [...] respectively, while also drawing attention to a lower quality display {{as compared with the}} MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. Charlie Sorrel of Wired News reached a similar conclusion about the MacBook display, citing its poor contrast and lack of vertical angle in comparison with the MacBook Pro and even the older white MacBook. Peter Cohen wrote an article discussing the loss of the FireWire port for Macworld, saying [...] "The absence of FireWire ports is certainly an inconvenience for some users. But it shouldn’t be considered a deal-breaker for most of us, anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Once More, with Feeling" [...] {{received}} widespread {{critical acclaim}} from media and critics when it aired, during overseas syndication, and in reminiscences {{of the best}} episodes of Buffy after the series ended. Although Salon.com writer Stephanie Zacharek states [...] "(t)he songs were only half-memorable at best, and the singing ability of the show's regular cast ranged only from the fairly good to the not so great", she also asserts that it works [...] "beautifully", paces itself gracefully, and is [...] "clever and affecting". Zacharek's unenthusiastic assessments {{of the music and}} cast's singing abilities were not shared by other writers. Debi Enker in Australia's The Age writes, [...] "Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) and Tara (Amber Benson) <b>are</b> <b>terrific,</b> Xander (Nicholas Brendon) and Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg) struggle valiantly, and Willow (Alyson Hannigan) barely sings a note". Tony Johnston in The Sunday Herald Sun writes that Gellar [...] "struggles on some of her higher notes, but her dance routines are superb, Michelle Trachtenberg's Dawn reveals sensual dance moves way beyond her tender years, and James Marsters' Spike evokes a sort of Billy Idol yell to disguise his lack of vocal proficiency The rest of the cast mix and match like ready-made Broadway troupers." [...] Johnston counts [...] "I'll Never Tell" [...] as one of the episode's [...] "standout moments". Connie Ogle in The Miami Herald calls the songs [...] "better and far more clever than most of the ones you'll hear on Broadway these days".|$|E

500|$|A Billboard {{magazine}} review said Phantasmagoria [...] "lives up to {{the advanced}} billing" [...] and [...] "aims to unnerve and succeeds gruesomely with bloody special effects interspliced in trusty scare-flick fashion with daubs of flesh and hints of sex". USA Today writer Joe Wilson gave it three-and-a-half stars and called it well-produced, visually appealing, frighteningly realistic and [...] "a much-needed change from normal fare", although he said the plot did not start to become interesting until halfway through. Gene Emery of The Providence Journal said the game was [...] "an impressive work, a sophisticated mix of live action and a rich computer-generated environment, coupled with a musical score that's spooky without being overwhelming". He also called the gameplay [...] "elegant in its simplicity". San Francisco Chronicle writer Laura Evenson called it unpredictable and addictive, comparing it to a good mystery novel. A reviewer for Next Generation {{was pleased with the}} story, the production values of the cutscenes, and the way the game mixed in full motion video without resulting in slowdown or poor control. However, he found that the lack of a challenge made it a poor value for experienced gamers, since {{they would be able to}} finish the entire game in a day or two, and recommended it strictly for gamers who were new to the adventure genre. Ric Manning of the Gannett News Service wrote, [...] "The graphics <b>are</b> <b>terrific,</b> but don't play on a full stomach." [...] Steve La Rue of U-T San Diego found the game [...] "visually opulent and interesting" [...] with [...] "dialogue a lot better than I expected, given the trite gothic novel plot", but also said he had to adjust to the [...] "gradual, contemplative pace". Jack Warner of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote: [...] "It's hackneyed, but the art is so good, the acting sufficiently convincing and the atmosphere brooding enough to keep you going", although he said [...] "precious little happens" [...] in the first few discs.|$|E
2500|$|Brantley {{reviewed}} the Broadway revival for The New York Times, writing: [...] "Somewhere {{along the road}} from Washington to Broadway, the Kennedy Center production of 'Follies' picked up a pulse. ... I am happy to report that since then, Ms. Peters has connected with her inner frump, Mr. Raines has found the brittle skeleton within his solid flesh, and Ms. Maxwell and Mr. Burstein have only improved. Two new additions to the cast, Jayne Houdyshell and Mary Beth Peil, <b>are</b> <b>terrific.</b> This production {{has taken on the}} glint of crystalline sharpness."

She resides in the mount Nandi. Modern depictions illustrates swan as her mount.

Despite a few shortcomings here and there, Bart's new cart is a world-beater!" [...] Tribune Media Services also gave it a positive review, writing that [...] "the storyline is great, the graphics, as Bart would say, are 'cool, man', and the action and control <b>are</b> <b>terrific.</b> This version of The Simpsons {{is a lot more}} complex than the first — not harder, there's just more to it." ...|$|E

6000|$|Coming {{through the}} Dardanelles, we saw camel trains on shore with the glasses, {{but we were}} never close to one till we got to Smyrna. These camels are very {{much larger than the}} scrawny {{specimens}} one sees in the menagerie. They stride along these streets, in single file, a dozen in a train, with heavy loads on their backs, and a fancy-looking negro in Turkish costume, or an Arab, preceding them on a little donkey and completely overshadowed and rendered insignificant by the huge beasts. To see a camel train laden with the spices of Arabia and the rare fabrics of Persia come marching through the narrow alleys of the bazaar, among porters with their burdens, money-changers, lamp-merchants, Al-naschars in the glassware business, portly cross-legged Turks smoking the famous narghili; and the crowds drifting to and fro in the fanciful costumes of the East, is a genuine revelation of the Orient. The picture lacks nothing. It casts you back at once into your forgotten boyhood, and again you dream over the wonders of the Arabian Nights; again your companions are princes, your lord is the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid, and your servants <b>are</b> <b>terrific</b> giants and genii that come with smoke and lightning and thunder, and go as a storm goes when they depart! ...|$|E

The degradation caused by its excess is a far more serious subject of thought, and of future fear. I shall examine this part of our subject at length hereafter. There can hardly be any doubt, at present, cast on the truth of the above passages, as all the great thinkers are unanimous on the matter.

And herein, also, is the root of the scorn, otherwise apparently most strange and cruel, with which Homer, Dante, and Shakspeare always speak of the populace; for it is entirely true that, in great states, the lower orders are low by nature as well as by task, being precisely that part of the commonwealth which has been thrust down for its coarseness or unworthiness (by coarseness I mean especially insensibility and irreverence--the [...] "profane" [...] of Horace); and when this ceases to be so, and the corruption and profanity are in the higher instead of the lower orders, there arises, first, helpless confusion, then, if the lower classes deserve power, ensues swift revolution, and they get it; but if neither the populace nor their rulers deserve it, there follows mere darkness and dissolution, till, out of the putrid elements, some new capacity of order rises, like grass on a grave; if not, there is no more hope, nor shadow of turning, for that nation.
