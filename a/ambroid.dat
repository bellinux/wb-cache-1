30|$|Samples {{removed from}} the sixteen qeros listed in Table  1 were {{analyzed}} by X-ray microdiffraction using a Rigaku Dmax/Rapid instrument. The analyses were conducted using Cu Kα radiation, an 800  μm collimator, and a graphite monochromator on the incident beam. Each specimen was mounted on a glass fiber with <b>Ambroid</b> nitrocellulose binder and oscillated about two axes of the goniometer for exposure times between 10 and 16  min. These were found sufficient to yield mostly well-defined patterns between 5 ° and 90 ° 2 θ. The “Giacomo Deposit” ore and comparative synthetic mixtures of cristobalite, anatase, quartz, and rutile were unconstrained by sample size and were analyzed as pressed powders by X-ray diffraction using a Philips PW 3020 open-architecture diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. This approach was designed to provide an improved quantitative estimate of mineral components in the ore. Scans were performed between 5 ° and 90 ° 2 θ as step scans at a step size of 0.04 ° and a scan rate of 1.2 °/min with a graphite focusing monochromator on the diffracted beam. All diffraction patterns were interpreted using Jade 9.0 from MDI Inc. and the current release of the ICDD PDF- 4 + database.|$|E
