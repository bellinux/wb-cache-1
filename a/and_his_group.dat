5|$|Lithium-ion battery {{efficiencies}} – Yet-Ming Chiang <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>group</b> at MIT {{showed a}} substantial {{improvement in the}} performance of lithium batteries by boosting the material's conductivity by doping it with aluminium, niobium and zirconium.|$|E
5|$|Pritchard {{learned from}} local {{residents}} {{that about a}} mile and a half to the north there was a military camp. Not knowing whether this was Davis <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>group</b> or the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry, he approached cautiously. He soon identified the camp as Davis's. At first dawn, Pritchard charged the camp, which was so surprised and overwhelmed that it offered no resistance and yielded immediately.|$|E

5|$|Riker {{gets up to}} {{date with}} the situation, and decides that while Ramsey <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>group</b> are at large and refusing to leave the planet, there is little they can do. Before leaving they find that one of Beata's assistants, Ariel (Patricia McPherson), has married Ramsey, and was {{followed}} by Beata's guards to their camp, where they arrested the survivors and their families. The Away Team attempt to explain to Beata the reason for Ramsey's refusal to leave. Beata and her council reject his reasoning, and threatens to execute them the following day. After failing to convince Ramsey <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>group</b> to leave with them, Riker contacts the Enterprise, in hopes to transport Ramsey <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>group</b> without their consent (despite it being {{a violation of the}} Prime Directive, and almost certainly an end to his career), but Dr. Crusher (while treating an incapacitated Geordi in the Captain's chair) refuses to allow anyone to beam aboard for fear of being infected, but allows Data, as an android, to return. Riker orders Data to take command and get the Enterprise to the Neutral Zone before it's too late.|$|E
5|$|The {{survivors}} {{were found}} {{over the following}} days by the Rhodesian Army and police; Hill and Mr and Mrs Hansen were taken to Kariba Hospital, while MacLaren <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>group</b> were airlifted to Andrew Fleming Hospital in Salisbury.|$|E

5|$|As {{director}} of the Los Alamos Laboratory, Oppenheimer was no longer answerable to Compton, but reported directly to Groves. He {{was responsible for the}} technical and scientific aspects of Project Y. He assembled the nucleus of his staff from the groups that had been working for him on neutron calculations. These included his secretary, Priscilla Greene, Serber and McMillan from his own group, and Emilio Segrè and Joseph W. Kennedy's groups from the University of California, J. H. Williams' group from the University of Minnesota, Joe McKibben's group from the University of Wisconsin, Felix Bloch's group from Stanford University and Marshall Holloway's from Purdue University. He also secured the services of Hans Bethe and Robert Bacher from the Radiation Laboratory at MIT, Edward Teller, Robert F. Christy, Darol K. Froman, Alvin C. Graves and John H. Manley <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>group</b> from the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory, and Robert R. Wilson <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>group,</b> which included Richard Feynman, that had been performing Manhattan Project research at Princeton University. They brought with them a great deal of valuable scientific equipment. Wilson's group dismantled the cyclotron at Harvard University and had it shipped to Los Alamos; McKibben's brought two Van de Graaff generators from Wisconsin; and Manley's brought the Cockcroft–Walton accelerator from the University of Illinois.|$|E
5|$|Elements of the 2nd SS Panzer Division {{arrive with}} {{infantry}} and armor. Although they inflict heavy casualties on the Germans, {{most of the}} paratroopers, along with Jackson, Mellish, and Horvath are killed, while Upham avoids fighting. Miller attempts to blow the bridge, but is shot and mortally wounded by Steamboat Willie, who has rejoined the Germans. Just before a Tiger tank reaches the bridge, an American P-51 Mustang flies overhead and destroys the tank, followed by American armored units which rout the remaining Germans. Witnessing Miller's shooting, Upham confronts Steamboat Willie <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>group</b> {{as they attempt to}} retreat. Steamboat Willie raises his hands in surrender, believing that Upham will accept because of their earlier encounter. Instead, Upham kills him, but lets the other Germans flee.|$|E
5|$|Frank Spedding's Ames Project had {{developed}} the Ames process, {{a method of}} producing uranium metal on an industrial scale, but Cyril Stanley Smith, the CM Division's associate leader in charge of metallurgy, was concerned about using it with highly enriched uranium due to the danger of forming a critical mass. Highly enriched uranium was also far more valuable than natural uranium, {{and he wanted to}} avoid the loss of even a milligram. He recruited Richard D. Baker, a chemist who had worked with Spedding, and together they adapted the Ames Process for use at the Los Alamos laboratory. In February Baker <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>group</b> made twenty 360 gram reductions and twenty-seven 500 gram reductions with highly enriched uranium tetrafluoride.|$|E

5|$|He claimed three Spitfires in two {{missions}} for {{his final}} victories (victories 171–173) on 26 August. His victims most likely belonged to 421 and 341 Squadron RAF. Between 24 May and 28 August 1944, Lang had claimed 29 aerial victories on the Western Front, including nine P-51 Mustangs. On 6 June 1944, his group {{was the first}} to reach 100 aerial victories over Normandy, earning him <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>group</b> a second and final reference in the Wehrmachtbericht on 30 August.|$|E
5|$|Homer <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>group</b> begin {{guarding}} the museum. Grampa {{and his friends}} from the retirement home volunteer to help, but Homer tells them to leave because they are too old. A few minutes later, Homer sees a group of teenagers drinking beer. He leaves his post to intervene and catch them, but immediately ends up getting drunk with them instead. While Homer's guard is down, the cat burglar sneaks past and steals the zirconia. Homer is blamed and pelted with vegetables by the unforgiving townspeople. Later that day, Grampa stops by the Simpsons' house and tells everybody that he knows who the cat burglar is: a resident in the local retirement home named Molloy.|$|E
5|$|Like Nasser, Gaddafi favoured the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>group,</b> Fatah, {{over more}} militant and Marxist Palestinian groups. As the years progressed however, Gaddafi's {{relationship}} with Arafat became strained, with Gaddafi considering him too moderate {{and calling for}} more violent action. Instead he supported militias like the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, As-Sa'iqa, the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front, and the Abu Nidal Organization. He funded the Black September Organization whose members perpetrated the 1972 Munich massacre of Israeli athletes in West Germany, and had the killed militants' bodies flown to Libya for a hero's funeral.|$|E

5|$|Marcinkus and {{the three}} prisoners in his group posing as Lithuanians– Tim Walenn, Henri Picard and Gordon Brettell– managed to reach a train heading towards Danzig (now Gdansk, Poland). Most likely, they {{intended}} to travel to East Prussia, cross the Lithuanian border, and somehow cross the Baltic Sea to neutral Sweden. However, officials at the Stalag had discovered the escape and began manhunts. Marcinkus <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>group</b> travelled further {{than most of the}} escapees, but were captured by the Gestapo near Schneidemühl on 26 March. Marcinkus and his associates were brought to Stalag XXB and spent the night there. On the following day they were handed over to the Danzig Gestapo.|$|E
5|$|On April 19, 1942, Seaborg reached Chicago {{and joined}} the {{chemistry}} group at the Metallurgical Laboratory of the Manhattan Project at the University of Chicago, where Enrico Fermi <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>group</b> would later convert uranium-238 to plutonium-239 in a controlled nuclear chain reaction. Seaborg's role was {{to figure out how}} to extract the tiny bit of plutonium from the mass of uranium. Plutonium-239 was isolated in visible amounts using a transmutation reaction on August 20, 1942, and weighed on September 10, 1942, in Seaborg's Chicago laboratory. He was responsible for the multi-stage chemical process that separated, concentrated and isolated plutonium. This process was further developed at the Clinton Engineering Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and then entered full-scale production at the Hanford Engineer Works, in Richland, Washington.|$|E
5|$|Walt Disney Pictures {{purchased}} the film rights for Who Framed Roger Rabbits story in 1981. Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman wrote two drafts {{of the script}} before Disney brought in executive producer Steven Spielberg, and his production company, Amblin Entertainment. Zemeckis was brought on to direct the film, and Canadian animator Richard Williams was hired to supervise the animation sequences. Production was moved from Los Angeles to Elstree Studios in England to accommodate Williams <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>group</b> of animators. While filming, the production budget began to rapidly expand and the shooting schedule ran longer than expected.|$|E

5|$|After {{leaving the}} Northern Water Tribe, Katara {{continues}} teaching Aang Waterbending while the group searches for an Earthbending teacher. They meet Toph Beifong, a twelve-year-old, blind tomboy and Earthbending prodigy who wants independence from her upper-class family. Pursued by Azula, Zuko and Iroh lead new {{lives in the}} Earth Kingdom as wanderers and refugees {{in the capital city}} of Ba Sing Se. At a library guarded by the spirit Wan Shi Tong, Aang <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>group</b> learn that an imminent solar eclipse could let them stop the Fire Nation before Sozin's Comet arrives. They journey to Ba Sing Se to inform the Earth King of this information. In the city, they find that the Earth King Kuei is being manipulated by Long Feng, leader of the Dai Li secret police. After Aang's group exposes Long Feng's political machinations, Toph is captured but manages to escape by learning to bend metal. The Dai Li join Azula to instigate a coup d'état of Ba Sing Se, and Zuko, who has spent his time in Ba Sing Se trying {{to come to terms with}} his identity, ultimately sides with his sister Azula. During a face off in the catacombs underneath the ancient city, Azula nearly kills Aang, forcing the protagonists to retreat with help from Iroh, leaving the Earth Kingdom under the control of the Fire Nation.|$|E
5|$|After obtaining {{permission}} from the Mexican government to mount an expedition into Indian territory {{to search for the}} legendary silver mine, Bowie, his brother Rezin, and ten others set out for San Saba on November 2, 1831. Six miles (10km) from their goal, the group stopped to negotiate with a large raiding party of Indians—reportedly more than 120 Tawakoni and Waco, plus another 40 Caddo. The attempts at parley failed and Bowie <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>group</b> fought for their lives for the next 13hours. When the Indians finally retreated, Bowie reportedly had lost only one man, while more than 40Indians had been killed and 30 were wounded. In the meantime, a party of friendly Comanche rode into San Antonio bringing word of the raiding party, which outnumbered the Bowie expedition by 14 to 1. The citizens of San Antonio believed the members of the Bowie expedition must have perished, and Ursula Bowie began wearing widow's weeds.|$|E
5|$|Baldwin <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>group</b> {{arrived at}} Tyre on 16 September 1190. Richard did not arrive in Syria until 1191. It is unclear exactly {{why they were}} sent ahead of the king; perhaps it was {{to look out for}} the king's {{interests}} while Richard took a more leisurely route, or perhaps to rid the king's entourage of a family grouping around Glanvill that the king did not trust. Baldwin was not a member or close associate of the Glanvill faction, so most likely he was sent ahead to look after the king's interests, whatever the reasons for the inclusion of his companions. Another concern may have been to get help to the Kingdom of Jerusalem as quickly as possible after the king learned of Frederick Barbarossa's death {{on the way to the}} Holy Land.|$|E
