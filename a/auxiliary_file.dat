If the double-copy method could be applied to the form factor, this would indicate an interesting ultraviolet finiteness bound for N= 8 supergravity at five loops.

40|$|Abstract- Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is {{an active}} {{microwave}} sensor which uses coherent imaging techniques to produce high-resolution images of the ground. One of the essential part of SAR Data Processing is the estimation of the Doppler parameters of the received data i. e., Doppler centroid frequency, Fdc. The methodology involves sequence of coordinate rotations and translations to get the radar beam’s “view vector ” into ECI coordinates. With satellite and target positions and velocities expressed in the same coordinate system, the velocities are projected along the beam vector to find the relative velocity, and then calculate Doppler centroid frequency. The orbit of RISAT- 2 is low inclination non-polar, non-sun synchronous orbit and the image data format is different.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} finding one or more desired items out of an unsorted database. Patel has shown that if the database permits quantum queries, then mere digitization is sufficient for efficient search for one desired item. The algorithm, called factorized quantum search algorithm, presented by him can locate the desired item in an unsorted database using $O(log_{ 4 }N) $ queries to factorized oracles. But the algorithm requires that all the property values must be distinct from each other. In this paper, we discuss {{how to make a}} database satisfy the requirements, and present a quantum search engine based on the algorithm. Our goal is achieved by introducing <b>auxiliary</b> <b>files</b> for the property values that are not distinct, and converting every complex query request into a sequence of calls to factorized quantum search algorithm. The query complexity of our algorithm is $O(P*Q*M*log_{ 4 }N) $, where P is the number of the potential simple query requests in the complex query request, Q is the maximum number of calls to the factorized quantum search algorithm of the simple queries, M is the number of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>files</b> for the property on which our algorithm are searching for desired items.

40|$|Abstract Background Existing {{tools for}} multiple-sequence {{alignment}} focus on aligning protein sequence or protein-coding DNA sequence, {{and are often}} based on extensions to Needleman-Wunsch-like pairwise alignment methods. We introduce a new tool, Sigma, with a new algorithm and scoring scheme designed specifically for non-coding DNA sequence. This problem acquires importance with {{the increasing number of}} published sequences of closely-related species. In particular, studies of gene regulation seek to take advantage of comparative genomics, and recent algorithms for finding regulatory sites in phylogenetically-related intergenic sequence require alignment as a preprocessing step. Much can also be learned about evolution from intergenic DNA, which tends to evolve faster than coding DNA. Sigma uses a strategy of seeking the best possible gapless local alignments (a strategy earlier used by DiAlign), at each step making the best possible alignment consistent with existing alignments, and scores the significance of the alignment based on the lengths of the aligned fragments and a background model which may be supplied or estimated from an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>file</b> of intergenic DNA. Results Comparative tests of sigma with five earlier algorithms on synthetic data generated to mimic real data show excellent performance, with Sigma balancing high "sensitivity" (more bases aligned) with effective filtering of "incorrect" alignments. With real data, while "correctness" can't be directly quantified for the alignment, running the PhyloGibbs motif finder on pre-aligned sequence suggests that Sigma's alignments are superior. Conclusion By taking into account the peculiarities of non-coding DNA, Sigma fills a gap in the toolbox of bioinformatics. </p...|$|E

40|$|Remotely sensed {{data are}} {{affected}} by system (sensor and platform), and scene related effects. For quantitative investigations the spectral, radiometric characteristics {{of the system and}} scene have to be known. The relevant effects and their possible influence on an image have to be specifically determined for every remote sensing system and adequate description parameters need to be updated and reported on a regular basis as they are carried out, e. g., for the AVIRIS system. It is evident that the strength of the influence of similar effects in very dependent on the accessibility of auxiliary information about such sensor systems. Degradation in a spaceborne system can normally be just reported and cannot be corrected. In contrast, an airborne sensor can be evaluated, maintained and improved periodically. Such maintenance efforts are particularly important because airborne systems are exposed to extreme and changing environments. These include tens of takeoffs and landing each year as well as extreme changes in temperature and humidity on the tarmac and in flight. For the AVIRIS system there are environmental stresses such as changes in temperature, air pressure, humidity, vibration of the platform or scene-related reasons like atmospheric conditions, and topography. The information contained in the auxiliary files included with the AVIRIS data can be used to assess these effects and compensate for them. In addition the spectral, radiometer and geometric calibration data contained in the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>file</b> are required for quantitative analysis of the data.

Parallel to the Sagittarius tidal track, but ~ 10 deg away, there is another fainter and more metal-poor stream. We provide evidence that the two streams follow similar distance gradients but have distinct morphological properties and stellar populations. The brighter stream is broader, contains more metal-rich stars and has a richer colour-magnitude diagram with multiple turn-offs and a prominent red clump {{as compared to the}} fainter stream. Based on the structural properties and the stellar population mix, the stream configuration is similar to the Northern "bifurcation".
