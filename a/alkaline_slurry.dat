With the microelectronic {{technology}} node moves down to 45 nm and beyond, {{and to reduce}} the RC delay time, low-k dielectric materials {{have been used to}} replace regular dielectric materials. Therefore, the down force of chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) needs to decrease based on the characteristics of low-k materials: low mechanical strength.

The objective of this project is to demonstrate the use of alkaline reagents injected into the furnace of coal-fired boilers {{as a means of}} controlling sulfuric acid emissions. The coincident removal of hydrochloric acid and hydrofluoric acid is also being determined, as is the removal of arsenic, a known poison for NO{sub x} selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalysts. EPRI, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), FirstEnergy Corporation, and the Dravo Lime Company are project co-funders. URS Corporation is the prime contractor. During the current period, American Electric Power (AEP) joined the project as an additional co-funder and as a provider of a host site for testing. This is the fourth reporting period for the subject Cooperative Agreement. During this period, two long-term sorbent injection tests were conducted, one on Unit 3 at FirstEnergy's Bruce Mansfield Plant (BMP) and one on Unit 1 at AEP's Gavin Station. These tests determined the effectiveness of injecting <b>alkaline</b> <b>slurries</b> into the upper furnace of the boiler as a means of controlling sulfuric acid emissions from these units. The <b>alkaline</b> <b>slurries</b> tested included commercially available magnesium hydroxide slurry (Gavin Station), and a byproduct magnesium hydroxide slurry (both Gavin Station and BMP). The tests showed that injecting either the commercial or the byproduct magnesium hydroxide slurry could achieve up to 70 to 75 % sulfuric acid removal. At BMP, the overall removal was limited by the need to maintain acceptable electrostatic precipitator (ESP) particulate control performance. At Gavin Station, the overall sulfuric acid removal was limited because the furnace injected sorbent was less effective at removing SO{sub 3 } formed across the SCR system installed on the unit for NO{sub x} control than at removing SO{sub 3 } formed in the furnace. Balance of plant impacts, primarily on the ESP particulate control device, were also determined during both tests. These results are presented and discussed in this report...|$|R

The erosive wear tracks were examined, in conjunction with investigation into evidence of corrosion damage, by scanning electron microscopy. The significant, superior erosion resistance of the coating to that of the uncoated mild steel and AISI 304 stainless steel mainly resulted from the exceedingly high coating strength and its stability under the simultaneous corrosion attack.

40|$|Mn based self-aligned {{diffusion}} {{barriers are}} promising for incorporation in the copper interconnects {{designed for the}} â‰¤ 22 nm technology node. However, in the current metallization scheme of chemical mechanical planarization (CMP), the processing of these barrier lines presents a specific challenge, which {{is rooted in the}} intrinsic corrosion characteristics of the Cu-Mn bimetallic couple. Since the Mn component of the self-aligned barrier film is electrochemically active compared to its adjacent Cu lines, the Cu-barrier interface of such a device tends to galvanically corrode in the chemical slurries used for CMP. Employing electrochemical techniques and a model galvanic system of polycrystalline Mn and Cu electrodes, the present work focuses on developing a strategic chemical approach to controlling this corrosion. The results demonstrate that, in the <b>alkaline</b> <b>slurry</b> environment (pH = 9 â€“ 12, frequently used for barrier-CMP), a relatively low concentration (0. 5 mM) of salicylaldehyde can minimize the galvanic corrosion of Mn while maintaining the latterâ€™s CMP-specific surface activity.

40|$|The {{iron sulfide}} mineral, {{pyrrhotite}} (Fe(1 -x) S), {{has long been}} known to be more difficult to recover by flotation from <b>alkaline</b> <b>slurries</b> than many other base metal sulfide minerals. This paper summarizes the results of an electrochemical study of the surface reactions that occur during the flotation of nickeliferous pyrrhotite in the recovery of nickel and the platinum group metals. Mixed potential measurements conducted with natural pyrrhotite electrodes in various stages of an operating flotation plant showed that the mineral potential is positive to the equilibrium potential of the xanthate/dixanthogen couple. Similar results were obtained during batch flotation experiments and in synthetic solutions in the laboratory. Cyclic voltammetric and potentiostatic current/time transient experiments were used to investigate the oxidation of pyrrhotite under various conditions. In addition, the reduction of oxygen, the reaction of copper ions and the oxidation of xanthate ions at the mineral surface were investigated. The formation of dixanthogen on pyrrhotite surfaces is thermodynamically favourable in plant flotation slurries. However the interaction with xanthate at pH values above 7 is inhibited by a surface species formed during the conditioning prior to xanthate addition. In acidic solutions copper ions react readily with pyrrhotite to form a species, possibly CuS that can be oxidized at potentials above 0. 4 V. At pH 9 this species does not form and there is no electrochemical reaction between pyrrhotite and copper ions. The beneficial effects of copper ions to flotation performance appear to be related to an enhancement of the oxidation of xanthate...|$|R

Tests show that temperature and pH of the slurry are two {{important factors in}} the self-magnetization of siderite and its synergic effect on hematite; that the self-magnetization took place on siderite but did not on hematite while a synergic effect of surface magnetization, i. e. the promotion of surface magnetization of hematite {{in the presence of}} siderite, appeared in the mineral mixtures or real iron ore containing hematite and siderite. The infrared spectra indicate that there is Fe 3 O 4 generated on the surface of siderite in the process of self-magnetization; the measurement of VSM confirmed a significant change in magnetic hysteresis loops and increase of the saturated magnetization after hematite was magnetized by Fe 2 + in the slurry; and SEM observed the adsorption of Fe 3 O 4 species on the surface of hematite, which is generated originally from the siderite in an <b>alkaline</b> <b>slurry,</b> resulting in the synergic effect of siderite on hematite...|$|E

Further use of tetraphenylborate ion in the decontamination of radioactive waste may require {{removal of the}} catalyst or cooling to temperatures at which the decomposition reaction proceeds slowly and does not adversely affect processing. Recent tests showed that tetraphenylborate did not react appreciably at 25 degrees Celsius over six months suggesting the potential to avoid the decomposition at low temperatures. The lack of reaction at low temperature could reflect very slow kinetics at the lower temperature, or may indicate a catalyst ''deactivation'' process. Previous tests in the temperature range 35 to 70 degrees Celsius provided a low precision estimate of the activation energy of the reaction with which to predict the rate of reaction at 25 percent Celsius. To understand the observations at 25 degrees Celsius, experiments must separate the catalyst activation step and the subsequent reaction with TPB. Tests described in this report represent an initial attempt to separate the two steps and determine the rate and activation energy of the reaction between active catalyst and TPB. The results of these tests indicate {{that the absence of}} reaction at 25 degrees Celsius was caused by failure to activate the catalyst or the presence of a deactivating mechanism.

The methodology includes dewatering and controlled disposal of bauxite residues, capping with waste rock or treated bauxite residues and, finally, development of a vegetation cover. This methodology is mainly based on bauxite residue properties, which possess low hydraulic conductivity if compacted at optimum moisture content. Several parts of this scheme were investigated at laboratory and pilot field scale. Simulation of an abandoned mine that was planned to be rehabilitated was also performed. Based on the results obtained, the main risk due to bauxite residues disposal is associated with the alkalinity of the material and initially high Na and Al concentrations in the leachate that progressively decrease due to the depletion of these elements.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Glucose, maltodextrin, and sucrose exhibit {{significant}} differences in their alkaline reaction properties and interactions in aluminate/silicate cement slurries that result in diverse hydration behaviors of cements. Using 1 D solution-and solid-state 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), the structures of these closely related saccharides are identified in aqueous cement slurry solutions and as adsorbed on inorganic oxide cement surfaces {{during the early stages}} of hydration. Solid-state 1 D 29 Si and 2 D 27 Al{ 1 H} and 13 C{ 1 H} NMR techniques, including the use of very high magnetic fields (18. 8 T), allow the characterization of the hydrating silicate and aluminate surfaces, where interactions with adsorbed organic species influence hydration. These measure-ments establish the molecular features of the different saccharides that account for their different adsorption behaviors in hydrating cements. Specifically, sucrose is stable in <b>alkaline</b> cement <b>slurries</b> and exhibits selective adsorption at hydrating silicate surfaces but not at aluminate surfaces in cements. In contrast, glucose degrades into linear saccharinic or other carboxylic acids that adsorb relatively weakly and nonselectively on nonhydrated and hydrated cement particle surfaces. Maltodextrin exhibits intermediate reaction and sorption properties because of its oligomeric glucosidic structure that yields linear carboxylic acids and stable ring-containing degradation products that {{are similar to those of}} the glucose degradation products and sucrose, respectively. Such different reaction and adsorption behaviors provide insight into the factors responsible for the large differences in the rates at which aluminate and silicate cement species hydrate in the presence of otherwise closely related saccharides...|$|R

In {{some of these}} wells {{it is obvious that}} these water quality samples are affected by the bleed-water from the cement used to seal the annuli. To gain an understanding as to why cement bleed -water occurs and how it can be controlled, literature from both the cement and petroleum industries are reviewed. Cement is a very alkaline material. When too much water is used to prepare the <b>slurry,</b> <b>alkaline</b> bleed -water can drain through or along the cement sheath surrounding the casing. This results in an increase in the pH measurements of groundwater samples. This bleed-water can separate from the cement in-three ways: it can move into the formation during cementing, it can accumulate within the cement forming pockets and channels behind the casing, and it can remain within the interconnected capillaries that exist throughout the cement sheath. The drainage of alkaline bleed -water from the cement can be greatly reduced by controlling the amount of water used in the preparation of the slurry. The amount of water added can be monitored during well construction by measuring the slurry density. By implementing this quality control procedure during well construction along with specifying the correct amount of mix-water for the slurry, the elevated pH levels in groundwater samples should be greatly reduced if not completely eliminated...|$|R

The tribochemical wear of oxide-free silicon occurred {{in the presence of}} water molecules, and the wear volume logarithmically decreased to a constant with the increase in sliding speed under thoseÂ two environmental conditions. TEM characterizations confirmed that the subsurface of wear scars were free of mechanical damage under a broad range of sliding speed (from 0.08 to 50 Â Î¼m/s). Raman analysis indicated that dehydration and hydrolysis reactions both occurred during the tribochemical wear of Si substrate. The dependence of tribochemical wear on sliding speed under humid air and in water can be modeled using stress/water-associated interfacial bond formation kinetics; interfacial reaction occurs via formation and rupture of Sisubstrate-O-Sitip bond bridges between Si substrate and SiO 2 tip contact surfaces, resulting in the variation in tribochemical wear on Si surface as a function of sliding speed. This study provides further insight into the tribochemical wear mechanism of Si CMP, which is of great significance for improving polishing efficiency. For example, restraining the hydrolysis reaction of Si-O can advance the tribochemical removal of Si materials, which may help to explain why the optimal pH of <b>alkaline</b> <b>slurry</b> is 10 â€“ 10.5 in the CMP process.|$|E

Tank 48 H currently holds legacy material containing organic tetraphenylborate (TPB) compounds from the operation of the In-Tank Precipitation process. The TPB was added during an in-tank precipitation process to removed soluble cesium, but excessive benzene generation curtailed this treatment method. This material is not compatible with the waste treatment facilities at SRS and must be removed or undergo treatment to destroy the organic compounds before the tank can be returned to routine Tank Farm service. Tank 48 H currently contains approximately 240, 000 gallons of <b>alkaline</b> <b>slurry</b> with approximately 19, 000 kg (42, 000 lb) of potassium and cesium tetraphenylborate (KTPB and CsTPB). Out of Tank processing of the Tank 48 H has some distinct advantages as aggressive processing conditions (e. g., high temperature, low pH) are required for fast destruction of the tetraphenylborate. Also, a new facility can be designed with the optimum materials of construction and other design features to allow the safe processing of the Tank 48 H waste. However, it is very expensive to build a new facility. As a result, an in-tank process primarily using existing equipment and facilities is desirable. Development of an in-tank process would be economically attractive. Based on success with Fentons Chemistry (i. e., hydrogen peroxide with an iron or copper catalyst to produce hydroxyl radicals, strong oxidation agents), testing was initiated to develop a higher pH oxidation process that could be completed in-tank...|$|E
40|$|The erosive wear in an <b>alkaline</b> <b>slurry</b> {{containing}} alumina {{particles of}} three typical engineering materials, the mild steel BS 6323 (Fe-C), the AISI 410 stainless steel (Fe-Cr-C), and the AISI {{304 stainless steel}} (Fe-Cr-Ni), was carried out, by means of rotating cylinder, three-electrode erosion-corrosion test, {{with a view to}} investigation into the roles of the typical elements and the mechanical and chemical properties in the erosive wear under simultaneous controlled corrosion. The total weight loss of erosion-corrosion was obtained by precision weighing and the result was compared and interpreted, for each material, by a full microscopical examination of the erosion-corrosion scars using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was found that the overall performance under erosion-corrosion in an descending order was the stainless steels AISI 304, AISI 410, and the mild steel, although the precise difference in performance was dependent upon the process conditions. Such a ranking of performance was not in total consistence with that expected only from the mechanical or the chemical property differences of the materials concerned. The individual contribution of each erosion and corrosion process was thus further separated through corrosion charge conversion using the Faraday's second law and the results were interpreted by discussion, on basis of the experimental and microscopical evidences, of the main factors that influenced the mechanical and wear behaviour, in conjunction with those influencing corrosion and passivity. Finally, schematic diagrams were proposed to outline the typical erosion and corrosion features thus obtained for all the three materials during erosion-corrosion.

30|$|Meanwhile, {{due to the}} {{continuous}} development of the alumina industry, {{a huge amount of}} red mud which is the by-product of the manufacture of alumina from bauxite by the Bayer process is annually generated in Korea with a rate of 200, 000 tons/year [19]. Red mud is a complex material whose chemical and mineralogical composition varies widely, depending upon the source of bauxite and the technological process parameters. It contains six major constituents, namely Fe 2 O 3, A 12 O 3, SiO 2, TiO 2, Na 2 O and CaO and small quantities of numerous minor/trace elements (as oxides) such as V, Ga, Cr, P, Mn, Cu, Cd, Ni, Zn, Pb, Mg, Zr, Hf, Nb, U, Th, K, Ba, Sr, rare earths, etc. Every red mud is composed of as many as 14 â€“ 21 mineral phases [19]. It is generally discharged as highly <b>alkaline</b> <b>slurry</b> (pH 10 â€“ 13.5) with 15 â€“ 40 Â % solids, which is pumped away for appropriate disposal [43]. The disposal of this alkaline waste sludge is expensive (i.e., up to 1 â€“ 2 Â % of the alumina price), as it requires a lot of land and causes a number of environmental problems [11]. During the past decades, extensive work has been done by many researchers to develop various economic ways for the utilization of red mud in the production of constructional materials that enable a potentially high consumption rates. As an alternative to traditional raw materials used in brick production, red mud utilization not only reduces the cost of raw materials, but also has great environmental significance [3]. For the purpose of stabilization material, Kalkan [13] presented an experimental program with various compacted clay samples containing red mud and cementâ€“red mud additives. The results showed a high compressive strength, a decrease in hydraulic conductivity and swelling as compared to natural clay samples. It was concluded that red mud and cementâ€“red mud materials can be successfully used for the stabilization of clay liners in geotechnical applications. The potential use of red mud in the production of special cements (e.g., red mud cement, iron rich cement) was suggested and reviewed in the literatures [30, 38]. Other applications of using red mud in constructional materials such as geo-polymers [7, 10], ceramics and tiles [34, 44], road base material [46] were also addressed in the previous studies. However, until recently, there was no investigation that addressed the economically feasible use of red mud in the production of CLSM. The reactions of pozzolanic materials (e.g., fly ash and ponded ash in CLSM mixture) in high alkaline environment due to the presence of red mud are believed to help hardening and strength development of CLSM. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the feasibility of the red mud utilization in the production of a CLSM made by industrial by-products throughout its engineering properties.|$|E
40|$|Tank 48 H {{return to}} service is {{critical}} to the processing of high level waste (HLW) at Savannah River Site (SRS). Liquid Waste Disposition (LWD) management has the goal of returning Tank 48 H to routine service by January 2010 or as soon as practical. Tank 48 H currently holds legacy material containing organic tetraphenylborate (TPB) compounds from the operation of the In-Tank Precipitation process. This material is not compatible with the waste treatment facilities at SRS and must be removed or undergo treatment to destroy the organic compounds before the tank can be returned to Tank Farm service. Tank 48 H currently contains {approx} 240, 000 gallons of <b>alkaline</b> <b>slurry</b> with about 2 wt % potassium and cesium tetraphenylborate (KTPB and CsTPB). The main radioactive component in Tank 48 H is {sup 137 }Cs. The waste also contains {approx} 0. 15 wt % Monosodium Titanate (MST) which has adsorbed {sup 90 }Sr, U, and Pu isotopes. A System Engineering Evaluation of technologies/ideas for the treatment of TPB identified Wet Air Oxidation (WAO) as a leading alternative technology to the baseline aggregation approach. Over 75 technologies/ideas were evaluated overall. Forty-one technologies/ideas passed the initial screening evaluation. The 41 technologies/ideas were then combined to 16 complete solutions for the disposition of TPB and evaluated in detail. Wet Air Oxidation (WAO) is an aqueous phase process in which soluble or suspended waste components are oxidized using molecular oxygen contained in air. The process operates at elevated temperatures and pressures ranging from 150 to 320 C and 7 to 210 atmospheres, respectively. The products of the reaction are CO{sub 2 }, H{sub 2 }O, and low molecular weight oxygenated organics (e. g. acetate, oxalate). The basic flow scheme for a typical WAO system is as follows. The waste solution or slurry is pumped through a high-pressure feed pump. An air stream containing sufficient oxygen to meet the oxygen requirements of the waste stream is injected into the pressurized waste stream, and the air/liquid mixture is preheated to the required reactor inlet temperature. The reactor provides sufficient retention time to allow the oxidation to approach the desired level of organic decomposition. Typical reaction time is about 30 - 120 minutes. Heat exchangers are routinely employed to recover energy contained in the reactor effluent to preheat the waste feed/air entering the reactor. Auxiliary energy, usually steam, is necessary for startup and can provide trim heat if required. Since the oxidation reactions are exothermic, sufficient energy may be released in the reactor to allow the WAO system to operate without any additional heat input. After cooling, the oxidized reactor effluent passes through a pressure control valve where the pressure is reduced. A separator downstream of the pressure control valve allows the depressurized and cooled vapor to separate from the liquid. Typical industrial WAO applications have a feed flow rate of 1 to 220 gallons per minute (gpm) per train, with a chemical oxygen demand (COD) from 10, 000 to 150, 000 mg/L (higher CODs with dilution). Note that catalysts, such as homogeneous copper and iron, their heterogeneous counterparts, or precious metals can be used to enhance the effectiveness (i. e., to lower temperature, pressure, and residence time as well as increase oxidation efficiencies) of the WAO reaction if deemed necessary...|$|E
