The development of the breed was governed by strict selection for heat tolerance, milk production and cattle tick (Boophilus microplus) resistance to result in the modern AMZ breed.|$|E

Fourteen Holstein and 13 <b>Australian</b> <b>Milk</b> <b>Zebu</b> multiparous cows were used in a 70 -day continuous feeding experiment. lsonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets containing either soybean meal or dried sardines (supplied 40 % of dietary crude protein) were fed ad - libitum. Comparisons between diets were made during the 7 -week experimental period. The experiment was conducted as a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatment, with diet and breed as main factors. Ruminal pH, ammonia N, total and individual volatile fatty acids concentrations were not altered by the feeding of dried sardines. Intakes of dry matter, energy, crude protein, and acid detergent fiber were lower (P 0. 05) in Holstein cows fed dried sardines than those fed the control diet (16. 2 vs 15. 1 kg/d). Feeding of dried sardines did not affect milk composition and compositional yields. Milk production was higher (P< 0. 01) in Holstein than <b>Australian</b> <b>Milk</b> <b>Zebu</b> cows. Effect of diet and breed interaction on milk production was significant (P< 0. 01). Potential of feeding marine proteins may be higher for higher milk producers (Holstein) than lower producers (<b>Australian</b> <b>Milk</b> <b>Zebu).</b> Reproduction parameters, body condition scores, and heat-stress associated parameters were not affected by the feeding of dried sardines. This study suggests that dried sardines could be incorporated into diets of lactating dairy cows without affecting milk production...|$|R

40|$|AbstractEmergence of {{babesiosis}} in {{both public}} health and food security concern in global perspectives cannot be ignored. The dairy farming {{plays an important role}} in food industry that, fulfilling the protein requirement through producing both milk and meat. The farming operations may get hampered due to non-infectious and infectious diseases. Infectious diseases also cause huge production losses in all farming operations in time to time. Babesiosis becomes a major concern in {{public health and}} animal production specialists in recent years both locally and internationally due to severity of out breaks, carrier animals and zoonotic nature. Babesiosis as an emerging zoonotic disease and also causing heavy production losses due to the both clinical diseases and carrier animals. Babesia parasites, mainly Babesia bovis and B. bigemina, are tick-borne hemoparasites inducing bovine babesiosis in cattle globally. Babesiosis is known to occur in tropical and subtropical regions of the world and it is one of the major constraints to the livestock industry which adversely affects economic return and food security by reducing milk, meat production and if not treated leads to the death of the animal. Babesia parasites are considered to be endemic in central Sri Lanka and the prevalence of babesiosis is high in other areas. Carrier cattle infected with babesiosis have low number of parasites in circulation. Babesiosis is difficult to detect and is a challenge to conventional diagnostic methods. However, diagnosis of carrier animals in herd is important for preventing outbreaks by transmission through vector ticks to healthy animals and for obtaining epidemiological data of the disease. Here, we have conducted nested PCR detection of Babesia bovis in carrier cattle (Jersey crosses, Friesian crosses and <b>Australian</b> <b>milking</b> <b>zebu)</b> of selected localities of Sri Lanka. For this study, 30 blood samples were collected from suspected carrier cattle and analyzed using light microscopy and nested PCR. Screening by light microscope indicated that 47 % of the samples to be positive. PCR analysis of samples diagnosed 80 % as positive. Hence, 33 % of the animals appeared to be healthy through routine light microscope diagnosis were in fact carriers posing a threat for the healthy herd population. The high prevalence of babesiosis in carrier cattle in Sri Lanka emphasized that island-wide control and prevention programs against bovine babesiosis are needed to minimize the financial burden caused by the parasites to reduce to production losses. This preliminary study on molecular detection of Babesia bovis in selected localities offers a rapid and efficient screening method for suspected carrier herds while providing new avenues to minimize losers incurred in milk production due to unidentified carrier animals...|$|E

The mean standard deviation and median Sigma PBDE concentrations were 11. 1 +/- 3. 2 and 11. 0 ng g(- 1) lipid, respectively with a range of 6. 1 - 18. 7 ng g(- 1) lipid. The congener profile was dominated by BDE- 47 followed by BDE- 99, - 100, - 153, - 154 and - 183. Regional differences were evaluated, but no trends were observed.

40|$|It {{is widely}} known {{that prior to}} embarking on a {{successful}} international career as a sculptor, Clement Meadmore was an influential Australian designer of furniture and of {{the interior of the}} groundbreaking modernist Legend Espresso and Milk Bar in Melbourne in 1955.

What appears to have been overlooked is that Meadmore designed a second café and milk bar called the Teahouse for Ion Nicolades, the same client who had commissioned the Legend. In its short life the relatively simple interior of the Teahouse embodied a complex mix of competing narratives. Based on the traditional British model of the ladies’ tearoom, it incorporated allusions to colonial mastery over subject peoples and fantasies of empire inspired by the exotic origins of the everyday commodity of tea. Other references include an irreverent recoding of Victorian vernacular style and lingering features of streamline moderne styling that characterised the design of <b>Australian</b> <b>milk</b> bars. It also derived elements of design from Scandinavian and American modernism. This paper brings to light Meadmore’s forgotten interior for the Teahouse and, referring to theories of the commodity spectacle and spectacular space, seeks to explore the way its diverse and competing narratives operated in a quirky melange. It also uses postcolonial theory to explore the way in which it supported continued identification with ‘Britishness’ and allegiance to the British Empire in the female citizens of a former settler colony, while simultaneously gesturing towards a fundamentally internationalist outlook through the language of functional modernism...|$|R
