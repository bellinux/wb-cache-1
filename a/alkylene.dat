40|$|We {{describe}} a novel class of periodically grafted amphiphilic copolymers (PGACs) {{that could serve}} as nonionic functional mimics of ionenes, the primary difference being that the periodically occurring charged units along the backbone of ionenes are replaced by hydrophilic oligoethylene glycol segments. The synthesis and properties of this new class of segmented polymers that carry a hydrophobic <b>alkylene</b> polyester backone with periodically placed hydrophilic oligo(oxyethylene) pendant units are presented. When the length of the intervening <b>alkylene</b> segment is adequately long, 22 -carbons in this case, and the pendant unit is a hexaethylene glycol monomethyl ether (HEG) segment, the polymer chain appears to adopt a folded zigzag conformation, reminiscent of the accordion-type structure formed by cationic ionenes. This transformation is driven by the intrinsic immiscibility of the <b>alkylene</b> and HEG segments and is reinforced by the strong tendency for long chain <b>alkylene</b> segments to crystallize in a paraffinic lattice. Evidence of the formation of such structures comes from the AFM images, which reveal the formation of remarkably flat pancake-like aggregates that are formed by the lateral aggregation of individually collapsed polymer chains; importantly, the heights of these structures match well with the lamellar layer-spacing obtained from SAXS studies of bulk samples. DSC studies further confirm the crystallization of the intervening <b>alkylene</b> segments, especially when they are long (C 22), suggesting the formation of the folded zigzag structures. In a suitably designed PGAC that carries diacetylene units symmetrically placed within the <b>alkylene</b> segment, attempts were made to cross-polymerize the diacetylene units and generate PEGylated nanoparticles.

Its high stability allows operation under aggressive working conditions. Herein is reported the tailoring of the separation performance of these hybrid silica membranes by adjusting the size, flexibility, shape, and electronic structure of the organic bridging group. A single generic procedure is applied to synthesize nanoporous membranes from bridged silsesquioxane precursors with different reactivities. Membranes with short <b>alkylene</b> (CH 2 and C 2 H 4) bridging groups show high H 2 /N 2 permeance ratios, related to differences in molecular size. The highest CO 2 /H 2 permeance ratios, related to the affinity of adsorption in the material, are obtained for longer (C 8 H 16) <b>alkylene</b> and aryl bridges.

The immiscibility of the <b>alkylene</b> and PEG segments, and the strong propensity of the <b>alkylene</b> segments to crystallize, drive these PGACs to self segregate by folding in a zigzag fashion and subsequently organize into a lamellar morphology, which was evident from DSC, SAXS, WAXS, and AFM studies; the interlamellar spacing was seen to increase linearly with MPEG length. Co-grafted PGACs, prepared by grafting a mixture of two different MPEGs (MPEG 350 and MPEG 750), also exhibited a lamellar morphology; interestingly, the interlamellar spacing was seen to depend only on the total PEG content, while {{the presence of a}} mixture of PEG lengths exerted little influence.
