25|$|U.S. rice {{consumption}} {{has risen}} sharply {{over the past}} 25 years, fueled in part by commercial applications such as beer production. Almost one in five adult <b>Americans</b> <b>now</b> report eating {{at least half a}} serving of white or brown rice per day.|$|E
25|$|A growing {{population}} of nearly half million Chinese <b>Americans</b> <b>now</b> live on Long Island. Rapidly expanding Chinatowns have developed in Brooklyn (布魯克林) and Queens (皇后), with Chinese immigrants also moving into Nassau County, as did earlier European immigrants, {{such as the}} Irish and Italians. More recently, a Little India (लघु भारत) community has emerged in Hicksville, Nassau County, spreading eastward from the more established Little India enclaves in Queens.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{suburban}} infrastructure evolved {{during an}} age of relatively easy access to fossil fuels, {{which has led to}} transportation-dependent systems of living. Zoning reforms that allow greater urban density as well as designs for walking and bicycling can greatly reduce energy consumed for transportation. The use of telecommuting by major corporations is a significant opportunity to conserve energy, as many <b>Americans</b> <b>now</b> work in service jobs that enable them to work from home instead of commuting to work each day.|$|E
25|$|A third {{significant}} minority is the Asian American population, comprising 19.4 {{million in}} 2013, or 6.0% of the U.S. population. California {{is home to}} 4.5 million Asian Americans, whereas 495,000 live in Hawaii, where they compose the plurality, at 38.5% of the islands' people. This is their largest share of any state. Historically first concentrated on Hawaii and the West Coast, Asian <b>Americans</b> <b>now</b> live across the country, {{living and working in}} large numbers in New York City, Chicago, Boston, Houston, and other major urban centers.|$|E
25|$|The {{public is}} also quite clear on its {{priorities}} {{when it comes}} to promoting energy conservation versus increasing the supply of oil, coal, and natural gas. When asked which of these should be the higher priority, the public chooses energy conservation by a very wide 68 percent-to-21 percent margin. The public also predominantly believes that the need to cut down on energy consumption and protect the environment means increased energy efficiency should be mandated for certain products. Ninety-two percent of <b>Americans</b> <b>now</b> support such requirements.|$|E

25|$|As a result, {{a series}} of quick fixes {{followed}} to ensure that American forces would not be caught completely off guard {{in the event of}} war. More important was the sensitivity with which American officials now treated the nervousness of their European counterparts; the <b>Americans</b> <b>now</b> became more willing to take steps to boost morale in Europe and ease the now-widespread anxieties there. The coup and the Berlin Blockade that June made clear that constant reassurance was needed to bind the Europeans to the U.S. system; hence, the remobilization of U.S. armed forces began.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} the Native Americans in Baltimore and what is now Baltimore dates back at least 12,000 years. As of 2014, Baltimore {{is home to a}} small Native American {{population}} centered in East Baltimore. The majority of the Native <b>Americans</b> <b>now</b> living in Baltimore belong to the Lumbee, Piscataway, and Cherokee tribes. The Piscataway tribe is indigenous to Southern Maryland, living in the area for centuries prior to European colonization. The Lumbee and Cherokee are indigenous to North Carolina and neighboring states of the Southeastern United States. Many of the Lumbee and Cherokee migrated to Baltimore during the mid-1900s along with other migrants from the South, such as African-Americans and white Appalachians.|$|E
25|$|Active {{recruitment}} {{of students from}} North America first began in 1984, with <b>Americans</b> <b>now</b> making up around 1 in 6 {{of the student population}} in 2017. Students from almost every state in the United States and province in Canada are represented. This is the highest proportion and absolute number of American students amongst all British universities. Media reports indicate growing numbers of American students are attracted to the university's academics, traditions, prestige, internationalism, and comparatively low tuition fees. The university also regularly features {{as one of the few}} non-North American universities in the Fiske Guide to Colleges, an American college guide, as a 'Best Buy'. St Andrews has developed a sizable alumni presence in the United States, with over 8000 alumni spread across all 50 states. Most major cities host alumni clubs, the largest of which is in New York. Both London and New York also host the St Andrews Angels, an alumni led angel investment network, which centres upon the wider university communities in both the United Kingdom and United States. St Andrews has also established relationships with other university alumni clubs and private membership clubs in the United States to provide alumni with social and networking opportunities. For example, alumni are eligible for membership at the Princeton Club of New York and the Algonquin Club in Boston.|$|E

500|$|M. F. K. Fisher, {{writing in}} The New York Times, stated that {{millions}} of American women in the 19th century organised [...] "every aspect of their lives [...]. {{as much as possible}} in imitation of the Queen", and that The Modern Cook sold almost as well in America as it did in England. Admitting that few American kitchens could [...] "follow all its directions for the light Gallic dainties Francatelli introduced to counteract the basic heaviness of royal dining habits", she argued that all the same his two-course approach eventually shaped the way <b>Americans</b> <b>now</b> eat both lunch and dinner. She observed that at Windsor Castle, Francatelli and other royal chefs were assisted by 24 assistant chefs and two [...] "Yeomen of the Kitchen", not to mention a multitude of [...] "servers and lackeys". This did not deter American housewives [...] "as far west as Iowa and then beyond" [...] from doing their best to follow his instructions.|$|E
500|$|While Moros {{rebels were}} still unsuccessfully {{at war with}} the United States, the Japanese {{invasion}} became the new perceived threat to their religion and culture. Some of those who opposed the occupation, and a fighter for Moro nationalism, were Sultan Jainal Abirin II of Sulu, the Sulu Sultanate of the Tausug, the Maranao Moros living around Lake Lanao and ruled by the Confederation of sultanates in Lanao led by Salipada Pendatun. Another anti-Japanese Moro unit, the Moro-Bolo Battalion led by Datu Gumbay Piang, consisted of about 20,000 fighting men made up of both Muslims and Christians. As their name suggests, these fighters were known visibly by their large bolos and kris. The Japanese Major Hiramatsu, a propaganda officer, tried convincing Datu Busran Kalaw of Maranao to join their side as [...] "brother Orientals". Kalaw sent a response which goaded Major Hiramatsu into sending a force of Japanese soldiers to attack him, whom Kalaw butchered completely with no survivors. The infamous juramentados brigands, who were veterans in fighting the Filipinos, Spanish and the <b>Americans,</b> <b>now</b> focused their assaults on the Japanese, using their traditional hit and run as well as suicide charges. The Japanese were anxious of being attacked by the resistance, and they fought back by murdering innocent civilians and destroying properties.|$|E
500|$|Chesbro {{pitched the}} Highlanders' first game. He {{finished}} the 1903 {{season with a}} 21–15 record. Chesbro began throwing a spitball in the 1904 season, which he learned from Elmer Stricklett, {{the inventor of the}} spitball. Chesbro also began working on a [...] "slow ball". That year, he started 51 games and finished 48 while posting a 1.82 ERA, striking out 239 batters, and recording 41 wins and 48 complete games over [...] innings pitched, setting MLB records for wins, complete games, and innings pitched in a season. [...] That year, no other pitcher in the league won more than 26. Chesbro won 14 straight games from May 14 through July 4, a New York franchise record that stood until Roger Clemens broke it in 2001. His 239 strikeouts remained a team record until Ron Guidry struck out 248 in 1978. On {{the last day of the}} season, in a game against the Boston <b>Americans</b> (<b>now</b> known as the Boston Red Sox), he threw a wild pitch in the top of the ninth inning, allowing the winning run to score from third base and causing the Highlanders to lose the pennant to Boston. The ruling on this play was controversial. [...] Even after Chesbro's death in 1931, his widow, with the support of former Highlanders manager Clark Griffith, continued to claim that the pitch was a passed ball, and blamed the winning run on catcher Red Kleinow.|$|E

2500|$|The Economist {{writes that}} many liberal Jews in America {{are opposed to}} the {{occupation}} and distressed by Israel's increasing religious nationalism. The younger generation is therefore gravitating to organizations like J Street, whose dovish members include former officials of President Clinton's and President Obama's administrations. While earlier generations of Americans saw Israel as a plucky David battling Goliath, younger <b>Americans</b> <b>now</b> see a powerful Israel occupying the West Bank.

2500|$|About half of <b>Americans</b> <b>now</b> live in what {{is known}} as the suburbs. The {{suburban}} nuclear family has been identified as part of the [...] "American dream": a married couple with children owning a house in the suburbs. This archetype is reinforced by mass media, religious practices, and government policies and is based on traditions from Anglo-Saxon cultures. One of the biggest differences in suburban living as compared to urban living is the housing occupied by the families. The suburbs are filled with single-family homes separated from retail districts, industrial areas, and sometimes even public schools. However, many American suburbs are incorporating these districts on smaller scales, attracting more people to these communities.|$|E
2500|$|The airfield, the city's main {{prize for}} the Americans, had been badly damaged by their {{bombardment}} {{and had been}} boobytrapped with explosives planted by the Taliban {{in and around the}} property as they left. This created a rift between the United Kingdom and the United States. The former charged that the aerial bombardment had been ill-advised, that the United States had failed to pay sufficient attention to humanitarian concerns and had refused to consult with its allies. The destroyed runways were patched by Afghans. The first cargo plane landed ten days after the battle. The airbase was not declared operational until December 11. While prior military flights had had to be launched from Uzbekistan or aircraft carriers in the Arabian Sea, the <b>Americans</b> <b>now</b> could fly more frequent sorties against the Taliban frontlines, carrying heavier payloads that replace the fuel necessary for the longer flights.|$|E
