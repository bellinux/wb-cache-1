500|$|The {{writing process}} for this album was more {{communal}} {{compared to that}} for Hello Master; Heppner had written much of the band's debut album himself and his bandmates helped him in arranging the material, but the sophomore album featured more contributions from each band member. Nudo once again wrote and sang a song for the record, and although Watchorn did not write the lyrics to an entire song by himself for this album, he and Heppner collaborated on several of them, including [...] "Lady Killer". Watchorn explained that the songs changed drastically between {{the time they were}} first written and when they got recorded, and that the songs [...] "weren't complete until they actually made the record." [...] He also said that the album's protracted production history enabled the group to experiment with the songs and repeatedly alter them to taste, thus ironically yielding a record that was considered better than if they had been able to simply record it <b>and</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> it sooner.|$|E
500|$|Will Harris from The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a B+, {{describing}} it as [...] "relatively strong" [...] while claiming there were [...] "some imperfections in characterization" [...] of Sheldon and that [...] "Raj had {{little more than}} cameo status" [...] in the episode. Harris was [...] "actually moved" [...] when Bernadette arrived at Howard's hotel room in Houston. R. L. Shaffer of IGN gave [...] "The Werewolf Transformation" [...] 6.5 out of 10 and {{described it as a}} [...] "good filler episode"; however, the subplot was criticized as viewers never see Howard experiencing hardships in training, and due to the [...] "sour end" [...] where Howard's mother is revealed to be staying with him in the hotel. Shaffer also suggested that episode would have been a good opportunity for Sheldon to have sex with Amy. Jim Garner of TV Fanatic gave the episode 3.8 out of 5 stars, saying that while it [...] "wasn't the most hysterically funny episode of the season, it did explore some fun areas of our favorite geeks". However, Garner criticized the Howard subplot, saying that it had been [...] "lingering" [...] for too long and that [...] "we [...] go ahead and shoot Howard in to space <b>and</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> it".|$|E
500|$|In addition, Tessa {{shares with}} MacLeod the {{consequences}} of his involvement in the Game. She dislikes the Game and would like to escape from it with him, since she fears for his life. According to Vandernoot, Tessa [...] "...always thought that she [...] die before [...] ", but when he told her about the Game during [...] "The Gathering", [...] "she [...] that he [...] be killed", thus she avoided thinking about it. Another consequence of the Game is that Tessa is sometimes exposed to danger from Immortals who want to use her to pressure MacLeod. Despite being captured by Quince in [...] "The Gathering", by the time of [...] "Band of Brothers", she is able to face Grayson: [...] "If you think [...] will stand by, ...you have misjudged him terribly. So you'd better kill me, now, <b>and</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> it." [...] Grayson releases her and calls her [...] "...a remarkable woman, well worth keeping alive." [...] Consequently, Tessa is fully aware of the risks of their relationship, but stays with MacLeod, explaining in [...] "Eyewitness" [...] that [...] "I know the risks I choose to take... I stay with you because I want to. I won't run. I'm not the little woman and I'll never be barefoot and pregnant. We all have things to face. This is mine." [...] However, she finds it difficult to deal with her fears when MacLeod leaves to fight another Immortal.|$|E

2500|$|James Mossop of the Electronic Telegraph {{called the}} Games {{in an article}} [...] "such a success that any city {{considering}} bidding for future Olympics must be wondering how it can reach the standards set by Sydney", while Jack Todd in the Montreal Gazette suggested that the [...] "IOC should quit while it's ahead.
