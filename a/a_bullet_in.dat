5|$|But by {{the time}} he {{captured}} the position, the rest of his company lay dead or wounded. Singh was left alone to achieve the objective assigned. He advanced towards the second Pakistani medium machine gun post. At this juncture, he was almost blinded by a grenade that blast at his face. His Sten gun ammunition had run out. Singh moved out of the trench and lobbed grenades at the next Pakistani post. Meanwhile, he jumped into another trench, and killed two Pakistani soldiers with his bayonet. Before he was able {{to move out of the}} trench, he was hit by <b>a</b> <b>bullet</b> <b>in</b> his head. As he succumbed to his wounds, Singh hurled a grenade into a nearby Pakistani trench.|$|E
5|$|The {{highest ranking}} {{casualty}} of this engagement was Gen. Heth, who {{was struck by}} <b>a</b> <b>bullet</b> <b>in</b> the head. He was apparently saved because he had stuffed wads of paper into a new hat, which was otherwise too large for his head. But there were two consequences to this glancing blow. Heth was unconscious for over 24 hours and had no further command involvement in the three-day battle. He was also unable to urge Pender's division to move forward and supplement his struggling assault. Pender was oddly passive during {{this phase of the}} battle; the typically more aggressive tendencies of a young general in Lee's army would have seen him move forward on his own accord. Hill shared the blame for failing to order him forward as well, but he claimed illness. History cannot know Pender's motivations; he was mortally wounded the next day and left no report.|$|E
5|$|The two men later reach {{a nature}} reserve {{as the third}} killer shows up. The trio meet their wives, their kids and Kwai's {{syndicate}} during a barbecue. After a tense standoff, they explain that they killed Costello's grandchildren because the children had seen their faces. Not wanting to start a shootout {{in front of the}} three attackers' wives and children, everyone waits until they have left. A moonlit gun battle ensues, with both sides suffering injuries. The three attackers flee, while Costello and Kwai's syndicate take refuge at a run-down apartment in Hong Kong to treat their wounds. Costello reveals that he is a former assassin and has had <b>a</b> <b>bullet</b> <b>in</b> his head for twenty years, which is affecting his memory.|$|E

25|$|The Dutch and English {{army had}} access to a large {{quantity}} of artillery, which had landed via barges landed from the Rhine.

25|$|Ambulances took McCall and Irvin to Waterman Hospital in Eustis. McCall {{was treated}} for a {{concussion}} and facial injuries, and Irvin for his gunshot wounds. At the hospital Irvin met with NAACP lawyers and later told the press that McCall shot him and Shepherd without provocation, as did Yates. In the early 21st century, Gilbert King examined the unredacted FBI files from the case. He wrote in his book published in 2012 that the FBI had located <b>a</b> <b>bullet</b> <b>in</b> the soil ten inches below the blood stain where Irvin had lain wounded, supporting Irvin's claim that Yates fired at him from near point blank range.|$|E
25|$|As {{a platoon}} commander, de Gaulle was {{involved}} in fierce fighting from the outset. He received his baptism of fire 15 August and {{was among the first}} to be wounded, receiving <b>a</b> <b>bullet</b> <b>in</b> the knee at the Battle of Dinant. It is sometimes claimed that in hospital, he grew bitter at the tactics used, and spoke with other injured officers against the outdated methods of the French army. However, there is no contemporary evidence that he understood the importance of artillery firepower in modern warfare; instead in his writing at the time he criticised the “overrapid” offensive, the inadequacy of French generals, and the “slowness of the English troops”.|$|E
25|$|Strohschneider {{was wounded}} by <b>a</b> <b>bullet</b> <b>in</b> the tibia {{early in the}} war, on 28 August 1914. After hospitalization, he was posted to a Guards unit, the 42nd Infantry Regiment on the Russian Front. He went into bitter winter battle at the Chryszcata Heights in the Carpathian Mountains and {{suffered}} a knee wound on 9 February 1915. He returned from hospital after this injury to command a machine gun section. On 19 September 1915, he was wounded for the third time, and captured by the Russians. He escaped to friendly lines. After convalescense, he was then invalided from the army as unfit for further service.|$|E

He spent the next two years in the United States, supervising armament contracts, and became attracted to the country.

25|$|On the day, {{there were}} three {{sections}} on patrol, a total of 24 men, spread out in a head-high cornfield around the compound. Budd spotted four Taliban approaching, {{at a distance of}} 50 metres. With hand signals, Budd led his section in a flanking manoeuvre round to the cornfield's outskirts to try to cut them off, but they were spotted and the Taliban opened fire on the troops. A further group of Taliban opened up fire from a wall further back. The British soldiers took heavy fire, kneeling or lying down trying to take cover. One soldier received <b>a</b> <b>bullet</b> <b>in</b> the shoulder, and another was shot in the nose.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} start of the Civil War, pro-Confederacy factions in Missouri became {{organized}} as the Missouri State Guard, and Slack, with his previous military experience and political connections, was appointed by Governor of Missouri Claiborne F.

In an August reorganization of the Guard, Slack assumed command of the 4th Division, which consisted of both cavalry and infantry. He saw action in the battles of Carthage and Springfield.
