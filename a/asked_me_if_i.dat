She <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was willing to accept either of these crowns. The white one meant that I should persevere in purity, and the red that I should become a martyr. I said that I would accept them both.|$|E

I loved doing the morning show for 2½ years but I am also looking forward to not getting up at 4 am any more. If you've ever had a morning job like this, you {{probably}} know the relief I feel, but I will still miss seeing Liz and Jose every day, having David Lynch as my weatherman, and talking to Timothy Olyphant about sports each morning. These will always rank with the coolest things I’ve ever been fortunate enough to do in my entire life.|$|E
25|$|I {{composed}} the fugue first and {{wrote it down}} while I was thinking out the prelude. I only {{hope that you will}} be able to read it, for it is written so very small; and I hope further that you will like it. Another time I shall send you something better for the clavier. My dear Constanze is really the cause of this fugue's coming into the world. Baron van Swieten, to whom I go every Sunday, gave me all the works of Händel and Sebastian Bach to take home with me (after I had played them to him). When Constanze heard the fugues, she absolutely fell in love with them. Now she will listen to nothing but fugues, and particularly (in this kind of composition) the works of Händel and Bach. Well, as she has often heard me play fugues out of my head, she <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had ever written any down, and when I said I had not, she scolded me roundly for not recording some of my compositions in this most artistically beautiful of all musical forms and never ceased to entreat me until I wrote down a fugue for her.|$|E

25|$|When General Bell first {{sent me to}} Victor I {{offered him}} certain {{evidence}} {{in regard to the}} perpetrators of the Vindicator explosion, which he has failed to follow up, but which would have led to the arrest and conviction of the men who are responsible for the placing of that infernal machine. At about the 20th of January, 1904, by order of the adjutant of Teller County military district, and under special direction of Major T. E. McClelland and General F. M. Reardon, who was the Governor's confidential adviser regarding the conditions in that district, a series of street fights were commenced between men of Victor and soldiers of the National Guard on duty there. Each fight was planned by General Reardon or Major McClelland and carried out under their actual direction. Major McClelland's instructions were literally to knock them down, knock their teeth down their throats, bend in their faces, kick in their ribs and do everything except kill them. These fights continued more or less frequently up to the 22d of March. About the middle of February General Reardon called me into Major McClelland's office and <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had a man in whom I could place absolute confidence. I called in Sergeant J. A. Chase, Troop C, First Cavalry, N. G. C., and, in the presence of Sergeant Chase, he stated to me that, owing to the refusal of the Mine Owners' Association to furnish the necessary money to meet the payroll of the troops, it had become necessary to take some steps to force them to put up the cash, and he desired me to take Sergeant Chase and hold up or shoot the men coming off shift at the Vindicator mine at 2 o'clock in the morning. I told General Reardon that I {{was under the impression that}} most of these men caught the electric car that stopped at the shaft house so that such a plan would be impracticable. He then said to me that the same end could be reached if I would take the sergeant and fire fifty or sixty shots into the Vindicator shaft house at some time during the night. Owing to circumstances making it impossible for Sergeant Chase to accompany me, I took Sergeant Gordon Walter of the same troop and organization, and that same night did at about 12:30 o'clock fire repeatedly into the Vindicator and Lillie shaft house. Something like sixty shots were fired from our revolvers at this time. Afterwards we mounted our horses and rode into Victor and into the Military Club, reporting in person to General Reardon and Major McClelland. The next day General Reardon directed me to take Sergeant Walter and look over the ground in the rear of the Findlay mine with a view of repeating the performance there, but before the plan could be carried out General Reardon countermanded the order, stating his reason to be that the mine owners had promised to put up the necessary money the next day, which, as a matter of fact, they did. General Reardon, in giving me directions regarding the shooting up of the Vindicator shaft house, stated that Governor Peabody, General Bell, he himself, and I were the only ones who knew anything about the plan.|$|E

Moroder clarified that he was not involved in the composition of the track or its use of a synthesizer: [...] "They did not let me get involved at all. Thomas <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> wanted {{to tell the story of}} my life. Then they would know what to do with it." [...] Daft Punk had been in contact with Moroder in relation to a possible contribution for the Tron: Legacy score, but this never happened.|$|E
500|$|David Hill, 18, {{was asked}} to [...] "sit in" [...] at the house, and while there heard Dudson shout [...] "Shut up, you slag!" [...] in the back room. When he asked what was going on, Leigh had shown him Capper. He said: [...] "She {{had a sort of}} cloth over her face, from just above the eyebrows and {{covering}} her nose. She had a bit of dried blood on her lip. She had no hair." [...] Hill also said he had heard them talking about [...] "dentistry work. It was something about pulling her teeth out with a pair of pliers." [...] Later, he was left alone in the house with Capper, who pleaded with him to untie her. He said: [...] "She <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could help but I told her I couldn't. I asked her who she was. She said her name was Suzanne. She <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could untie her. I said I couldn't do anything." [...] He later claimed that he was too afraid of Leigh to intervene or raise the alarm, saying: [...] "I thought they would batter me. If I'd said [...] they'd all have got me, wouldn't they? I didn't know what to do. I was too shocked to do anything." [...] While Capper was being held in the house, Leigh and Dudson met up with her sister's fiance Paul Barlow to help him repair his car. Barlow said: [...] "They could have told me there and then. The door would have been kicked down and I would have got Suzanne out. I did not think they were capable of such savagery. Now all I want is ten minutes with them in a back room." ...|$|E

Gordon drew on her experience with Burkhardt to take on the storyline. Home and Away's producer, Cameron Welsh, approached Gordon about the storyline and asked her if she would be comfortable doing it. Gordon called it an [...] "amazing opportunity to be given". Gordon said [...] "The producer <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> wanted to do this storyline and made sure I was comfortable doing it based on what I had been through, I definitely think this one tops all of them".

500|$|The {{band has}} named the group Melvins as an {{influence}} on its development, but the most-publicized influence is progressive rock pioneer group King Crimson. Longtime King Crimson member Robert Fripp has downplayed any influence his band had on Tool. In an interview, Fripp touched on how the two bands relate to each other, stating [...] "Do you hear the influence? There's just one figure where I hear an influence, just one. It was a piece we were developing that we dropped. And it's {{almost exactly the same}} figure: three note arpeggio with a particular accent from the guitar. So I do not think you could have heard it. That's the only thing." [...] He also said, [...] "I happen to be a Tool fan. The members of Tool have been generous enough to suggest that Crimson has been {{an influence on}} them. Adam Jones <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could detect it in their music, and I said I couldn’t. I can detect more Tool influence in King Crimson, than I can hear King Crimson in Tool." [...] In describing their wide range of styles, critics have noted that they are [...] "influenced as much by Pink Floyd as by the Sex Pistols". Other reported influences of the band include Rush, Helmet, Faith No More and Jane's Addiction.|$|E
500|$|After {{recording}} the second {{version of the}} song, Lennon {{wanted to do something}} different with it, as Martin remembered: [...] "He'd wanted it as a gentle dreaming song, but he said it had come out too raucous. He <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could write him a new line-up with the strings. So I wrote a new score (with four trumpets and three cellos) and we recorded that, but he didn't like it." [...] Meanwhile, on 8 and 9 December, another basic track was recorded, using Mellotron, electric guitar, piano, backwards-recorded cymbals, and swarmandel, an Indian version of the zither. After reviewing the tapes of Martin's version and the original, Lennon told Martin that he liked both versions, although Martin had to tell Lennon that the orchestral score was at a faster tempo and in a higher key (B major) than the first version (A major). Lennon said, [...] "You can fix it, George", giving Martin and Geoff Emerick, the band's recording engineer, the difficult task of joining the two takes together. With only a pair of editing scissors, two tape machines and a vari-speed control, Emerick compensated for the differences in key and speed by increasing the speed of the first version and decreasing the speed of the second. He then spliced the versions together, starting the orchestral score {{in the middle of the}} second chorus. (Since the first version did not include a chorus after the first verse, he also spliced in the first seven words of the chorus from elsewhere in the first version.) The pitch-shifting in joining the versions gave Lennon's lead vocal a slightly other-worldly [...] "swimming" [...] quality.|$|E
