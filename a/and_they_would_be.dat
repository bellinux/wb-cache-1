5|$|Certain astronomical objects {{known as}} spiral nebulae such as M31 {{would later be}} {{recognized}} as conglomerations of stars when the true distance to these objects began to be discovered, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> deemed island universes. However, the word Universe was later understood to mean the entirety of existence, so this expression fell into disuse and the objects instead became known as galaxies.|$|E

Pickford made 13 films for Artcraft of which 11 survive complete.|$|E

5|$|From 1254 to 1257, Edward {{was under}} the {{influence}} of his mother's relatives, known as the Savoyards, the most notable of whom was Peter of Savoy, the queen's uncle. After 1257, Edward increasingly fell in with the Poitevin or Lusignan faction – the half-brothers of his father HenryIII – led by such men as William de Valence. This association was significant, because the two groups of privileged foreigners were resented by the established English aristocracy, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> at the centre of the ensuing years' baronial reform movement. There were tales of unruly and violent conduct by Edward and his Lusignan kinsmen, which raised questions about the royal heir's personal qualities. The next years would be formative on Edward's character.|$|E
5|$|It was {{customary}} on all British mainline journeys {{to change}} engines at convenient locations {{to avoid the}} lengthy process of re-coaling. The Coronation locomotives were therefore strategically stationed at key points between London and Glasgow <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> assigned to the shed at that location. The chosen locations were at London (Camden shed), Crewe (Crewe North), Carlisle (Upperby) and Glasgow (Polmadie). It {{was only in the}} latter days of steam that the mix of shed assignments became more fluid.|$|E
5|$|Breeders {{would choose}} {{potential}} exhibition ducks from among newly hatched ducklings in March and April, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> given {{a great deal}} of extra attention. They would be fed a carefully controlled diet to get them to the maximum weight, and would be allowed out for a few hours each day to keep them in as good a physical condition as possible. Before the show, their legs and feet would be washed, their bills trimmed with a knife and sandpapered smooth, and their feathers brushed with linseed oil. While most breeders would give the ducks a healthy meal before the show to calm them, some breeders would force-feed the ducks with sausage or worms, to get them to as heavy a weight as possible. Exhibition standards judged an Aylesbury duck primarily on size, shape and colour. This encouraged the breeding of larger ducks, with pronounced exaggerated keels, and loose baggy skin. By the beginning of the 20thcentury the Aylesbury duck had diverged into two separate strains, one bred for appearance and one for meat.|$|E

5|$|During {{a cabinet}} meeting {{towards the end}} of April, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi asked Manekshaw if he was {{prepared}} {{to go to war with}} Pakistan. In response, Manekshaw told her most of his armoured and infantry divisions were deployed elsewhere, only 12 of his tanks were combat-ready, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> competing for rail carriages with the grain harvest at that point of time. He also pointed out the Himalayan passes would soon open up, with the forthcoming monsoon in East Pakistan, which would result in heavy flooding. When Gandhi asked the cabinet to leave the room and Manekshaw to stay, he offered to resign. She declined to accept it, but sought his advice. He then said he could guarantee victory if she would allow him to prepare for the conflict on his terms, and set a date for it, and Gandhi agreed.|$|E
5|$|The {{experiment}} was suggested on 1 November 1943 by Robert Serber. The {{idea was to}} measure the spatial and temporal symmetry of explosive compression of a metal sphere. The test measured changes of absorption of gamma rays in the metal of the sphere as it underwent compression. The gamma ray source was located {{in the center of}} a metal sphere. The increase of thickness (of hollow shells) and density (of solid spheres) as the compression progressed was detected as a decrease of intensity of gamma rays outside of the sphere; the lower density explosives did not absorb gamma radiation enough to interfere with the experiment. The gamma rays had to be intense and of the right energy. Too low energy, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> fully absorbed in the surrounding metal; too high energy and the difference of attenuation during the implosion would be too low to be practical. The detectors had to provide high speed and large area; fast ionization chambers, then under development, were the only devices then available satisfying the requirements.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} on 27 May had changed considerably from just 24 hours earlier. The Belgian Army {{had been forced}} from the Leie line on 26 May, and Nevele, Vynckt, Tielt and Iseghem had fallen on the western and {{central part of the}} Leie front. In the east, the Germans had reached the outskirts of Bruges, and captured Ursel. In the west, the Menen–Ypres line had broken at Kortrijk and the Belgians were now using railway trucks to help form anti-tank defences on a line from Ypres–Passchendaele–Roulers. Further to the west the BEF had been forced back, north of Lille just over the French border and was now in danger of allowing a gap to develop between themselves and the Belgian southern flank on the Ypres–Lille axis. The danger in allowing a German advance to Dunkirk would mean the loss of the port which was now too great. The British withdrew to the port on 26 May. In doing so, they left the French 1st Army's north-eastern flank near Lille exposed. As the British moved out, the Germans moved in, encircling the bulk of the French Army. Both Gort and his Chief of Staff, General Henry Pownall, accepted that their withdrawal would mean the destruction of the French 1st Army, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> blamed for it.|$|E

The feet were also soaked in a concoction that caused any necrotic flesh to fall off.|$|E

25|$|The {{process of}} cooling {{involves}} removing internal energy from a system. When no more energy can be removed, the system is at absolute zero, though this cannot be achieved experimentally. Absolute zero is the null point of the thermodynamic temperature scale, also called absolute temperature. If it were possible to cool a system to absolute zero, all classical motion of its particles would cease <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> at complete rest in this classical sense. Microscopically {{in the description of}} quantum mechanics, however, matter still has zero-point energy even at absolute zero, because of the uncertainty principle.|$|E
