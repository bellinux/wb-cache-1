Analysis of IR line scanner properties in band 3 – 5 µm and 8 – 12 µm proved that when applying the <b>aperture</b> <b>diaphragms</b> the {{influence of}} the radiant diffraction upon geometrical resolution may be significant. This influence is stronger for larger f- numbers N in the applied optical systems.

50|$|If no {{automation}} {{of exposure}} is desired, a Manual mode is available.

For use with older lenses {{that do not have}} an automated <b>aperture</b> <b>diaphragm,</b> Stopped-down Aperture Priority AE or Stopped-down Manual can be used; these instruct the camera that the currently set aperture will be the taking aperture, and to therefore adjust the metering calculations accordingly.

50|$|Schmidt was well-aware of {{this and}} had been pondering {{possible}} solutions during the late 1920s. According to Baade, he had abandoned at least one solution already, when finally he hit upon his ultimate design, which involved a novel, indeed bold departure from traditional optical designs. Schmidt realized that by employing a large spherically shaped mirror (instead of the normal paraboloidal mirror of a reflector telescope) and a smaller <b>apertured</b> <b>diaphragm</b> placed {{at the center of}} curvature of the mirror, he could at a stroke eliminate coma and astigmatism. He would be left, however, with spherical aberration which is just as damaging to image sharpness.|$|R

5000|$|E — Electromagnetic diaphragm. The <b>aperture</b> <b>diaphragm</b> of an E lens is {{controlled}} digitally by the camera, and actuated electromagnetically {{by a system}} housed within the lens, rather than employing the F-mount's traditional mechanical diaphragm linkage. This system first appeared in certain Perspective Control lenses, designated PC-E (with designs that preclude a mechanical linkage). E-type lenses aperture control is only supported by all DSLRs with CMOS image sensor except the Nikon D90. For all other cameras the lens aperture stays maximum open with normal autofocus and metering. E Lenses with manual aperture control like PC-E lenses allow manual diaphragm operation on all cameras, with possible unreliable metering on DSLRs without E-type support. Otherwise E lenses are similar to G lenses. Not {{to be confused with}} old AI Series E lenses.|$|E
5000|$|The 135 mm Hexanon for the F had manual aperture, but {{the other}} lenses {{featured}} what {{was referred to as}} [...] "fully automatic" [...] aperture in the 1960s. This is not as automated as apertures eventually became. At that time it meant the <b>aperture</b> <b>diaphragm</b> was held fully open during focusing, to make for a brighter viewfinder and render shallow depth of field, both of which helped with focusing. Once the shutter release button was pressed, the aperture was allowed to snap down to the pre-selected setting, before the shutter opened to expose the film. Further, the aperture re-opened automatically after the shutter closed. All this happened in the instant the exposure was made, while the reflex mirror was also cycling up out of the way, then back down to the viewing position.|$|E
50|$|Strictly speaking, {{it is not}} an <b>aperture</b> in the <b>diaphragm</b> but an osseoaponeurotic opening {{between it}} and the {{vertebral}} column, and therefore behind the diaphragm (Meaning that diaphragmatic contractions do not directly influence the Aorta or aortic supply).|$|R
5000|$|His boldness lies in {{realizing that}} he could {{eliminate}} the spherical aberration by placing a thin, very weakly curved aspheric lens (now called the [...] "Schmidt corrector plate") at the same center of curvature as the <b>apertured</b> <b>diaphragm.</b> This aspheric lens has a complex curve that is convex near its middle and concave near its periphery that creates the opposite spherical aberration of the spherical mirror it is paired with, canceling out the mirror's spherical aberration. In this way, very neatly and simply he could construct a large camera of f/1.75 or even faster, that would give sharp images across a field more than 15 degrees in diameter, {{making it possible to}} image large swathes of sky with short exposures (on the order of a few minutes versus an hour or more with a conventional reflector). His first camera had an aperture of about 360mm or 14.5" [...] in diameter, and a focal ratio of f/1.75. It is now housed in a museum at the Hamburg Observatory. Schmidt's combining of diverse optical elements (a special mirror, a diaphragm at a particular location, and a [...] "correction plate") into a simple catadioptric system, based on reasoning from first principles, was epoch making. In particular, the [...] "correction plate" [...] was like nothing ever seen before in telescope design. After Schmidt a flood of new catadioptric designs appeared in the subsequent decades.|$|R
2500|$|A {{device called}} a {{diaphragm}} usually {{serves as the}} aperture stop, and controls the <b>aperture.</b> The <b>diaphragm</b> functions [...] much like the iris of the eye– it controls the effective diameter of the lens opening. Reducing the aperture size increases the depth of field, which describes {{the extent to which}} subject matter lying closer than or farther from the actual plane of focus appears to be in focus. In general, the smaller the aperture (the larger the number), the greater the distance from the plane of focus the subject matter may be while still appearing in focus.|$|R
50|$|The Mamiya C {{series is}} a line of twin-lens reflex medium-format system cameras {{manufactured}} by Mamiya between 1956 and 1994. It was developed from the Mamiyaflex series of cameras built from 1949 to 1956. The Mamiya C series was initially aimed at the professional market, but some later models were intended for amateurs. Unlike most TLR cameras, the Mamiya C has interchangeable lenses. The upper and lower lenses come off as a unit, and are available in at least seven different focal lengths. The lower lens of each unit has an <b>aperture</b> <b>diaphragm</b> {{as well as a}} leaf shutter. A flash sync terminal is part of the lens unit, and the delay can be set to M or X mode. The camera has an interlocking baffle that enables lenses to be changed without exposing the film. Focusing is done via a bellows system on the front side of the camera. Early models had separate film advance and shutter cocking mechanisms; on later models the shutter was automatically cocked. There is no metering in the camera body, so an external light meter is necessary. Viewfinders with built-in meters were available as accessories with later models.|$|E
50|$|An {{interesting}} forerunner to {{the movie}} camera was the machine invented by Francis Ronalds at the Kew Observatory in 1845. A photosensitive surface was drawn slowly past the <b>aperture</b> <b>diaphragm</b> of the camera by a clockwork mechanism to enable continuous recording over a 12- or 24-hour period. Ronalds applied his cameras to trace the ongoing variations of scientific instruments and they were used in observatories {{around the world for}} over a century. The very first patented film camera was the one devised by Wordsworth Donisthorpe in 1876. Another film camera was designed in England by Frenchman Louis Le Prince in 1888. An earlier 16 lens camera in 1887 at his workshop in Leeds. The first 8 lenses would be triggered in rapid succession by an electromagnetic shutter on the sensitive film; the film would then be moved forward allowing the other 8 lenses to operate on the film. After much trial and error, he was finally able to develop a single lens camera in 1888, which he used to shoot the first sequences of moving film in the world, including the Roundhay Garden Scene and Leeds Bridge. According to Adolphe Le Prince, who assisted his father at Leeds, Roundhay Garden was shot at 12 frame/s and Leeds Bridge at 20 frame/s. His camera still exists with the National Media Museum in Bradford. He shot the film on celluloid with 1¾ inch width.|$|E
40|$|White light {{scanning}} interference microscopy, {{with its}} high axial resolution, is particularly {{useful for the}} rapid 3 D characterization of MOEMS micro-systems. Although this technique {{can be used for}} submicron critical dimension measurement on micron high microelectronic structures, recent tests using a standard system have revealed errors of up to 3 µm in the measurement of lateral position of deep square steps. Thus the 2 µm wide, 75 µm deep teeth of an electrostatic comb structure in a FT MOEMS spectrometer were measured to be nearly 7 µm wide using a Mirau interference objective with the <b>aperture</b> <b>diaphragm</b> of the illumination system fully open in white light. Tests under different conditions show that the error is greatest for the Mirau objective, with the <b>aperture</b> <b>diaphragm</b> fully open at longer wavelengths. In addition, the location of the centre of such structures can vary by up to 1 µm depending on the degree of reference mirror tilt. Investigations of the XZ images of square steps have revealed the presence of "ghost" fringes resulting from diffraction and the conical illumination used. The errors in edge position can be reduced using a Linnik type objective with the <b>aperture</b> <b>diaphragm</b> closed down using shorter wavelength light...|$|E
50|$|As {{in other}} photography, {{the control of}} the exposed image is done in the lens with {{the control of the}} <b>diaphragm</b> <b>aperture.</b> For proper selection, the cinematographer needs that all lenses be {{engraved}} with T-Stop, not f-stop so that the eventual light loss due to the glass doesn't affect the exposure control when setting it using the usual meters. The choice of the aperture also affects image quality (aberrations) and depth of field.|$|R

40|$|Perfusion of the {{fenestrated}} capillaries of {{the intestinal}} mucosa {{of the rat}} with 0. 05 - 0. 1 M EDTA removes the diaphragms of the endothelial cells and detaches these cells from one another and from the basement membrane.

40|$|Mirror systems make it {{possible}} to reduce device dimensions and its weight while preserving high input aperture and these systems are characterized by a number of other advantages. Their significant disadvantage is a central screening of an entrance pupil that leads to lower image quality. The paper contains description of the investigations on afocal systems formed by eccentrically cut-out mirror paraboloids (off-axis mirrors) where <b>aperture</b> <b>diaphragm</b> is displaced in the meridian plane for a defined value and a central field point is located on the optical axis. The canonic Mersenne systems are accepted as base schemas (modules) for these compositions. The paper considers two types of such systems: visible increases – Г > 0 and Г < 0. Algorithms for calculation of centered afocal systems with two and four reflections have been written in the paper and the systems are free from spherical aberration, coma, astigmatism when an input pupil is located in superimposed focal planes of all parabolic mirrors. An aberration in curvature image has been additionally corrected in three-mirror quart-parabolic scheme which is a combination of two classical telescopic Mersenne systems. The paper presents schemes and calculation results. Two-mirror schemes with non-screened input pupil have been studied in the paper and in this case all the system remains centered and an <b>aperture</b> <b>diaphragm</b> is decentered for the distance Cm which is commensurable with the diaphragm size. The paper contains description of the investigated afocal schemes with four reflections from off-axis mirror paraboloids, a prepared algorithm for calculation, the obtained formulas for making combination of canonic afocal systems formed by two mirrors. Computer simulation in software environment Opal and Zemax has been carried out in the paper. Basic description has been prepared while using two alternative methods for the class of decentered systems and aberration characteristics and schematic solutions for telescopic systems without screening with two and four reflections have been ob-tained in the paper. Two-mirror afocal systems with low-powered magnification are of some interest for practical application as accessories for registering object lenses.  </p...|$|E
50|$|In photography, {{the size}} of the {{entrance}} pupil (rather than {{the size of}} the physical aperture itself) is used to calibrate the opening and closing of the <b>diaphragm</b> <b>aperture.</b> The f-number ("relative aperture"), N, is defined by N = f/EN, where f is the focal length and EN is the diameter of the entrance pupil. Increasing the focal length of a lens (i.e., zooming in) will usually cause the f-number to increase, and the entrance pupil location to move further back along the optical axis.|$|R
50|$|By {{adjustment}} {{of the field}} diaphragm, {{the image of the}} field <b>diaphragm</b> <b>aperture</b> in the sample plane is set to a size slightly larger than the imaged region of the sample (which corresponds in turn to the portion of the sample image thrown into the eyepiece field stop). As the field diaphragm, sample, and eyepiece field stop all lie on conjugate image planes, this adjustment allows the illuminating rays to completely fill the eyepiece field of view, while minimizing the amount of extraneous light which must be blocked by the eyepiece field stop. Such extraneous light scatters inside the system and degrades contrast.|$|R
5000|$|In optics, a {{diaphragm}} {{is a thin}} opaque structure with an opening (aperture) at its center. The role of the diaphragm is to stop the passage of light, except for the light passing through the aperture. Thus it is also called a stop (an aperture stop, if it limits the brightness of light reaching the focal plane, or a field stop or flare stop for other uses of diaphragms in lenses). The diaphragm {{is placed in the}} light path of a lens or objective, {{and the size of the}} aperture regulates the amount of light that passes through the lens. The centre of the <b>diaphragm's</b> <b>aperture</b> coincides with the optical axis of the lens system.|$|R
40|$|The foil lens, {{in which}} the voltage is applied between an <b>aperture</b> <b>diaphragm</b> and a {{conducting}} foil, acts as a concave lens and produces the negative spherical aberration. This negative spherical aberration can be utilized for the correction of the positive spherical aberration of a magnetic lens. The foil lens {{has been applied to}} the prefield lens formed by the magnetic field before the center of the strongly excited objective of a standard electron microscope. The spherical aberration of the lens system composed of the foil lens and the prefield lens has been studied experimentally, and it has been found that the correction is possible, at the voltage of 260 volts applied in the foil lens, up to 1. 0 x 10 ' rad in terms of the angle of the beam focusing {{at the center of the}} objective. It has been shown as well that the experi-mental result agrees satisfactorily with numerical evaluations calculated from the third and the fifth order spherical aberrations of the lens system...|$|E
40|$|When {{we measure}} {{the size of}} a fine {{particle}} {{as in the case of}} determining the particle size distribution with the electron microscope whose magnification is given from the objective and projector lens current, it is generally said that the errors can not be expected to be les than 10 ~ 20 %. Those errors are originated from various reasons such as the image distortion, magnetic hysteresis effects in the lens pole pieces, daily changing various electrical conditions, soiling of the <b>aperture</b> <b>diaphragm</b> in the objective lens and some others. In order to minimanize these errors, however, we should be careful so as to choose a series of a good condition in each factor, and only by special precaution we can reduce the error to be less than 10 %. The author scrutinized each of the causes of errors of an electron microscope of (S. M. – U. 5) type, and determined the magnification from the objective and projector lens current, and some other conditions that would give the least possible errors. From the obtained results, the author found that the error could be reduced under about 3 %. Yet, the magnification must be checked at least once a month in order to maintain its accuracy because of some the changeable factors mentioned above...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSurface-generated {{structured}} illumination microscopies interrogate {{the position}} of fluorescently labeled objects near surfaces with nanometer resolution along the z axis. However, these techniques are either experimentally cumbersome or applicable to a limited set of experimental systems. We present {{a new type of}} surface-generated structured illumination fluorescence microscopy, variable incidence angle fluorescence interference contrast microscopy (VIA-FLIC), in which the fluorescent sample is assembled above a reflective Si surface and the incidence angle of excitation light is varied by placing annular photomasks with different radii in the <b>aperture</b> <b>diaphragm</b> plane of the microscope. The variation in incidence angle alters the interference pattern of excitation light, and hence the intensity of detected fluorescence. Quantitative VIA-FLIC is tested by using a set of fluorophore-containing supported membranes separated from the Si surface by SiO 2 layers of variable thicknesses. The resulting fluorescence intensity versus incidence angle curves depends on the separation from the Si surface and when fit with an appropriate model yield precise SiO 2 thicknesses that are accurate with respect to the known SiO 2 thicknesses. Since only a simple modification to a standard epifluorescence microscope is required, VIA-FLIC offers a versatile method to produce z-reconstructions with high resolution {{for a wide range of}} biological systems...|$|E
