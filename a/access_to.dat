5|$|Water {{supply and}} {{sanitation}} in Zimbabwe {{is defined by}} many small scale successful programs but also by {{a general lack of}} improved water and sanitation systems for the majority of Zimbabwe. According to the World Health Organization in 2012, 80% of Zimbabweans had <b>access</b> <b>to</b> improved, i.e. clean, drinking-water sources, and only 40% of Zimbabweans had <b>access</b> <b>to</b> improved sanitation facilities. <b>Access</b> <b>to</b> improved water supply and sanitation is distinctly less in rural areas.|$|E
5|$|A large {{percentage}} of people who live in urban areas have <b>access</b> <b>to</b> parks and gardens in their areas, which are probably the only connections they have with nature.

50|$|In {{grouping}} operation, <b>accesses</b> <b>to</b> the synchronization {{variables are}} sequentially consistent. A process is allowed <b>to</b> <b>access</b> a synchronization variable that all previous writes have been completed. In other words, <b>accesses</b> <b>to</b> synchronization variables {{are not permitted}} until all operations on the synchronization variables are completely performed.|$|R

40|$|Multi-threaded {{parallel}} programs perform <b>accesses</b> <b>to</b> shared variables, {{which require}} {{application of a}} synchronization strategy. Absence of synchronization among threads may lead to error situations, such as data races. Data races, which involve concurrent <b>accesses</b> <b>to</b> a single shared variable, are categorized as low-level. Synchronization strategies to alleviate lowlevel data races do not guarantee freedom from data races on a higher-level of abstraction. In this paper, we discuss some scenarios where <b>accesses</b> <b>to</b> a group of variables may result in data races. Further, we discuss a method to statically detect such situations and describe its integration into Bauhaus tool suite. ...|$|R

5|$|Before the Revolution, New Englanders {{consumed}} {{large quantities}} of rum and beer as maritime trade provided relatively easy <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the goods needed to produce these items. Rum was the distilled spirit of choice as molasses, the main ingredient, was readily available from trade with the West Indies. In the continent's interior, colonists drank whiskey, as they had ready <b>access</b> <b>to</b> corn and rye but did not have good <b>access</b> <b>to</b> sugar cane. However, up until the Revolution, many colonists considered whiskey to be a coarse beverage unfit for human consumption, believing that it caused the poor to become raucous and disorderly.|$|E
