500|$|Burton [...] "loved the idea" [...] {{of playing}} a {{character}} [...] "very different" [...] from Jason Morgan, who was characterized as [...] "Stone Cold". The role of Dylan {{allowed him to}} wear colors other than black, which he was famed for at General Hospital. Of returning to daytime television without Jason Morgan's [...] "uniform" [...] and [...] "black T-shirt", Burton described the experience as [...] "refreshing". Explaining his wardrobe process, he said: [...] "I never had to try stuff on. I'm not used to wardrobe fittings. I had to try on about 20 different outfits! That was really grueling. It was important to shake the leather coat and black t-shirt and do my hair different, because I know people <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> see me as Jason." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Rolling Stone, {{the album}} {{contains}} [...] "raspy braggadocio and sexy rhymes" [...] which complement Queen's raspy vocals. It alternates between reggaetón and hip hop as Queen experiments with Caribbean music, R, pop, electronica, funk, dancehall and acoustic ballads: [...] "I really think this album {{is for people}} to really just sit down and listen to it". She explained that [...] "there are times that the songs will {{make you want to}} dance", but their lyrics are more meaningful. Although Queen said the album has its share of [...] "battles against men", she wants it to demonstrate that she is a well–rounded artist. Describing the songs, she said [...] " [...] <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be real because they are feelings that people have...The hits that I have now, the girls love them because they are real. If I am feeling hurt and need to curse to express that, then I will. I am going to be real all the way because that's what made Ivy Queen".|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers have {{commented on}} {{themes of the}} episode; topics of {{discussion}} included the relationship between parents and children, class relations, the scene in which Logan attacks the perpetrator in Veronica's sex tape case, and the final scene {{in relation to the}} overall moral of the series. According to Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club, the episode contained a role reversal between Veronica and Keith, with Keith violating the law. He noted the scene in which Keith erases the surveillance tapes of Veronica as illustrating the theme that [...] "the two aren't so different after all." [...] Roger Holland of PopMatters thought that the episode demonstrated that Veronica and Keith's relationship was the central component of the show: [...] "it was all about Veronica and Keith. And beyond that, about parents, children, and the myriad ways they can fuck each other up." [...] Stephanie Zacharek, writing for Salon, thought that the final scenes of [...] "The Bitch Is Back" [...] "cement the dour reality, posited {{at the very beginning of}} the series, that the rich ... <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be the ones in charge." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{title of}} the album, The Hunting Party, is a contextual metaphor. The album, {{a return to the}} band's {{original}} harder rock-centric sounds, represents the band's desire to not only create something different from other rock bands, but to also bring back the [...] "energy and soul" [...] of rock itself, and that Linkin Park are the party that will hunt for that energy and soul. Shinoda elaborated on the {{title of the}} album in an interview with Kerrang! explaining: [...] "We got so sick of other bands trying to be other bands and playing it safe the whole time, so the album name comes from a theory about culture becoming too passive, everyone just standing around waiting for opportunities to come to them instead of going out and getting theirs. I'm aware there <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be heavier bands than us, but The Hunting Party is Linkin Park going out and getting it for ourselves." [...] The inspiration for the title came from a news article Shinoda read online about a Japanese writer's concerns about today's growing society. The writer described the young men of today as [...] "herbivores", and explained how they are essentially grazing, waiting for an opportunity to come to them, rather than hunting for it.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} much acclaim from television journalists. The storyline involving Joan's prostituting herself {{to secure the}} Jaguar account for Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce came in for particular analysis and scrutiny among journalists, as related to its execution and use of themes of female sexuality and sexual objectification. Alan Sepinwall fought with himself over {{the execution of the}} prostitution story in this episode, asking, [...] "If you buy that the partners would be willing to sell Joan, and that Joan would feel the same way, then this is an all-time great episode of the series. But if you don't, then it's Weiner and company making the characters act against their natures to fit the theme." [...] Sepinwall described the story as [...] "something that so fundamentally changes the way you view a number of major characters, and the show that uses them, {{that it has to be}} just about perfect to work, and maybe not even then." [...] Todd VanDerWerff opined that,"'The Other Woman' shouldn’t work. It’s so obviously constructed to be a 'message' episode, and the message is far from subtle: No matter what we try to do to make them equal, men <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> turn women into objects on some level, because that’s just how men perceive them." [...] VanDerWerff compared it to the [...] "Employee of the Month" [...] episode of The Sopranos, even going so far as to call [...] "The Other Woman" [...] a stronger episode.|$|E

In Beijing itself, {{there had been some}} brewpubs and German-style beer halls operated by Munich-based Paulaner Brewery since the early 1990s that catered both to expatriates and to Chinese made prosperous by free-market economic reforms that began at the time. But there was nothing like the craft breweries that had sprung up in the U.S. since the 1980s, [...] "places where you knew the service <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> great, where the stuff <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on draft," [...] Setzer said later.|$|R
2500|$|James Morgan Pryse was an esoteric gnostic who saw Revelation as {{a western}} {{version of the}} Hindu theory of the Chakra.

[...] Such diverse theories have failed to command widespread acceptance. But Christopher Rowland argues: [...] "there <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be loose threads which refuse to be woven into the fabric as a whole.

[...] The line, [...] "I may not be Einstein, but I know dumb plus dumb equals you", was largely criticized by music critics. [...] "Standing in Front of You" [...] was {{considered}} a [...] "poetic ballad about imploring a gun-shy guy to take the plunge and commit." [...] The eighth track, the pop punk [...] "I Forgive You", talks about forgiveness and was seen as [...] "a heartfelt postscript to the guy who left her in 'Since U Been Gone'." [...] "Hello" [...] is an uptempo [...] "rugged" [...] track that [...] "finds its groove in the chorus [...] handclaps on the bridge." [...] "The War Is Over" [...] was considered a [...] "post-breakup song" [...] with [...] "pummeling" [...] drums, while [...] "Let Me Down" [...] has Clarkson being [...] "'dumb enough to linger' with a bad boy." [...] "You Can't Win", a punch-guitar song, [...] "reflects on the reality that there <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be critics, no matter what you say or do. It strives to encourage 'the one who doesn't quite fit in' not to internalize criticism too deeply." [...] The closing track on the standard edition, [...] "Breaking Your Own Heart," [...] was named an [...] "acoustic country" [...] song.|$|E
2500|$|As Birds of Prey {{approached}} its hundredth issue, Simone used issues #99 and #100 {{to shake}} up the lineup. She let Black Canary leave the team with her ward, a little girl called [...] "Sin", and used a prison break arc to introduce superhumanly strong Big Barda, pacifist Judomaster and rascally Misfit into the new squad, and with the new Spy Smasher as an ambiguous Jack Bauer-like anti-heroine and Lois Lane cornering Oracle into almost giving away her secret identity. Again, the characters were chosen to provide a foil for each other, and affirmed her love for her characters: [...] "The team {{is a group of}} individuals, quite unlike the friendship between Dinah, Helena and Babs. And any team with Barda on it automatically has a certain bull in a China shop tremble, and I love that... The characters don't apologize for being asskickers, nor for being smart, nor for being sexy, nor for being sexual, for that matter. There <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be some people who find that not to their taste, but at the same time, Birds of Prey regularly brings in people who don't otherwise read mainstream comics, a whole audience that may not pick up any other superhero titles, and I love that niche, that little area between good taste and utter shamelessness." [...] Finally, Simone stated her agony of leaving the book: [...] "I miss the characters in all the books I've worked on. Writing the last issue of Birds of Prey I'm doing was actually physically painful." ...|$|E

60|$|Mr. George went to New York {{to engage}} the passage for the children. And inasmuch {{as many of the}} readers of this book who reside in the country may never have had the {{opportunity}} of witnessing the arrangements connected with Atlantic steamers, they may perhaps like to know how this was done. In the first place, it was necessary to get a permit to go on board the ship. The crowds of people in New York, who <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> and fro, are so great, and the interest felt in these great steamships is so strong, that if every body were allowed free access and egress to them, the decks and cabins of the vessels would be always in confusion. So they build a barricade across the great pier at which the ships lie, with ponderous gates, one large one for carts and carriages, and another smaller one for people on foot, opening through it, and no one is admitted without a ticket. Mr. George went to the office in Wall Street and procured such a ticket, which one of the clerks in attendance there gave him, on his saying that he wished to go on board to select a state room for some passengers.|$|E
60|$|Such was {{the awful}} {{sentence}} that thundered from his lips. What was grammar to a desperado like that? I was glad {{in my heart}} that I had been spared these scenes of malignant carnage. No Bedouins attacked our terrible rear. And none attacked the front. The new-comers were only a reinforcement of cadaverous Arabs, in shirts and bare legs, sent far ahead of us to brandish rusty guns, and shout and brag, and carry on like lunatics, and thus scare away all bands of marauding Bedouins that might lurk about our path. What a shame it is that armed white Christians must travel under guard of vermin like this as a protection against the prowling vagabonds of the desert--those sanguinary outlaws who <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do something desperate, but never do it. I may as well mention here that on our whole trip we saw no Bedouins, and had no more use for an Arab guard than we could have had for patent leather boots and white kid gloves. The Bedouins that attacked the other parties of pilgrims so fiercely were provided for the occasion by the Arab guards of those parties, and shipped from Jerusalem for temporary service as Bedouins. They met together {{in full view of the}} pilgrims, after the battle, and took lunch, divided the bucksheesh extorted in the season of danger, and then accompanied the cavalcade home to the city! The nuisance of an Arab guard is one which is created by the Sheiks and the Bedouins together, for mutual profit, it is said, and no doubt there is a good deal of truth in it.|$|E
