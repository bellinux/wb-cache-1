25|$|The newer concentric-float {{fill valve}} {{consists}} of a tower which is encircled by a plastic float <b>assembly.</b> <b>Operation</b> is otherwise {{the same as a}} side-float fill valve, even though the float position is somewhat different. By virtue of its more compact layout, interference between the float and other obstacles (tank insulation, flush valve, and so on) is greatly reduced, thus increasing reliability. The concentric-float fill valve is also designed to signal to users automatically when there is a leak in the tank, by making much more noise when a leak is present than the older style side-float fill valve, which tends to be nearly silent when a slow leak is present.|$|E

40|$|Prior to Permanently Manned Capability (to be {{achieved}} approximately 21 {{months after the}} First Element Launch), the Space Station will be manned for less than 10 percent of its total staytime on orbit.

40|$|<b>Assembly</b> <b>operations</b> {{are a key}} {{component}} of modern manufacturing systems. Designing, planning, and conducting <b>assembly</b> <b>operations</b> represent {{an important part of the}} cost of a product. Virtual reality provides an efficient and cost-effective solution to manufacturing design, planning, and prototyping. Still there are certain issues (such as data translation, integration of various hardware and software systems, and real-time collision detection) faced while applying this advanced technology to the assembly domain. For example, existing works focus on using virtual reality systems and environments mainly to design new products and to plan for assembly. Little focus has been given to develop virtual reality environments that contribute to train operators on <b>assembly</b> <b>operations</b> and to bridge the gap between design and implementation/execution of assembly. Therefore, the research work presented in this article focuses on developing a fully functional virtual manufacturing assembly simulation system that solves the issues related to virtual reality environments. The proposed system uses a virtual environment to create an interactive workbench that can be used for evaluating assembly decisions and training <b>assembly</b> <b>operations.</b> It is a comprehensive system that provides visual, auditory, tactile, as well as force feedback.

40|$|Significant {{advances}} {{have been made}} in the area of macro planning for <b>assembly</b> <b>operations</b> (i. e., dividing a product into sub-assemblies, determining the sequence of <b>assembly</b> <b>operations).</b> On the contrary, the state of the art in micro planning (i. e., tool selection, path planning for tool and part movements) is rather primitive. To generate a realizable assembly plan, both macro planning and micro planning problems need to be solved. Tooling considerations are an important component of the micro planning problem. Therefore, we present a methodology for modeling assembly tools, selecting tools for <b>assembly</b> <b>operations,</b> and generating detailed tool movements. Techniques described in this paper can be combined with macro planning techniques to result in a complete assembly planner. 1 Introduction Developing high-performance electro-mechanical products is a very challenging task.
