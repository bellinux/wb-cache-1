Performance piece [...] "Thank You for Your Visit, Have a Nice Day", performed on Manhattan's 14th Street during the 2009 event, Art in Odd Places:SIGN, was inspired [...] "by a uniformed attendant holding a [...] "Hold the Handrail" [...] sign in a Taipei metro station". Performers held placards based on signs noticed by Olek that were [...] "emphatic, ironic or amused dialogue with their location." ...|$|E
2500|$|When drunk, Kelly {{would be}} heard singing Irish songs; in this state, she would often become quarrelsome and even abusive to those around her, which earned her the {{nickname}} [...] "Dark Mary." [...] McCarthy said [...] "she {{was a very}} quiet woman when sober but noisy when in drink." [...] Barnett first met Kelly in April 1887. They agreed to live together on their second meeting the following day. In early 1888 they both moved into 13 Miller's Court, a furnished single room {{at the back of}} 26 Dorset Street, Spitalfields. It was a single twelve-foot square room, with a bed, three tables and a chair. Above the fireplace hung a print of [...] "The Fisherman's Widow". Kelly's door key was lost, so she bolted and unbolted the door from outside by putting <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> a broken window beside the door. A German neighbour, Julia Venturney, claimed Kelly had broken the window when drunk. Barnett worked as a fish porter at Billingsgate Fish Market, but when he fell out of regular employment and tried to earn money as a market porter, Kelly turned to prostitution again. A quarrel ensued over Kelly's sharing of the room with another prostitute whom Barnett knew only as [...] "Julia" [...] and he left on 30 October, more than a week before her death, while continuing to visit Kelly.|$|E

60|$|It {{was before}} this solidly-established {{tribunal}} that Dr. Cyrus Pym, after passing <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> the honey-coloured hair over each ear, rose {{to open the}} case. His statement was clear and even restrained, and such flights of imagery as occurred in it only attracted attention by a certain indescribable abruptness, not uncommon in the flowers of American speech.|$|E
60|$|Arnold was {{speechless}} for a moment. Sabatini's manner was incomprehensible. He spoke {{as one who}} alludes to some trivial happening.

Then both went with him to the station, and as the long cars rolled in Dane turned quietly to the lad.|$|E

60|$|The {{punishment}} of their comrade excited neither anger nor resentment {{among the other}} boys, who yelled with delight at his discomfiture, but it made them more careful in approaching the cage, and though they continued to poke the prisoners with sticks they did not venture again to thrust <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> the bars. At sunset the guards again came round, lifted the cage and carried it into a shed. A platter of dirty rice and a jug of water were put into the cage; {{two of the men}} lighted their long pipes and sat down on guard beside it, and, the doors being closed, the captives were left in peace.|$|E
6000|$|The unconcern of {{her husband}} was even more strikingly true, than the simple {{language}} of his wife would appear to convey. Content had not only laid aside his weapon, but he had resumed his seat near the fire, with an air as calm, as assured, and it might have seemed to one watchfully observant, as understanding, as her own. Until now, the stout Dudley had remained leaning on his piece, immovable and apparently unconscious as a statue. But, following the injunctions of one he was accustomed to obey, he placed the musket against the wall, with {{the care of a}} hunter, and then running <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> his shaggy locks, as though the action might quicken ideas that were never remarkably active, he bluntly exclaimed-- ...|$|E
60|$|Adjoining to this I had my {{enclosures}} for my cattle, {{that is to}} say my goats, and I {{had taken}} an inconceivable deal of pains to fence and enclose this ground. I was so anxious to see it kept entire, lest the goats should break through, that I never left off till, with infinite labour, I had stuck the outside of the hedge so full of small stakes, and so near to one another, that it was rather a pale than a hedge, and there was scarce room to put <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> between them; which afterwards, when those stakes grew, as they all did in the next rainy season, made the enclosure strong like a wall, indeed stronger than any wall.|$|E

60|$|There {{where the}} roof had fallen, it roared like {{the mouth of}} hell. Thither Rahero went, {{stumbling}} on senseless folk, And grappled a post of the house, and began to climb in the smoke: The last alive of Vaiau; and the son borne by the sire. The post glowed in the grain with ulcers of eating fire, And the fire bit to the blood and mangled his hands and thighs; And the fumes sang in his head like wine and stung in his eyes; And still he climbed, {{and came to the}} top, the place of proof, And thrust <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> the flame, and clambered alive on the roof. But even as he did so, the wind, in a garment of flames and pain, Wrapped him from head to heel; and the waistcloth parted in twain; And the living fruit of his loins dropped in the fire below.|$|E

6000|$|For {{some years}} the opinion {{in favour of}} an advance grew {{steadily}} among those in power in India. In 1876 a decisive step was taken.

The avowed object was to ultimately secure the effectual command of the passes of the Hindu Kush. [Despatch No.17, 11th June, 1877.] The British Ministry, the famous ministry of Lord Beaconsfield, approved the action and endorsed the policy. Again, in 1879, the Vice-regal Government, in an official despatch, declared their intention of acquiring, [...] "through the ruler of Cashmere, the power of making such political and military arrangements as will effectually command the passes of the Hindu Kush."
