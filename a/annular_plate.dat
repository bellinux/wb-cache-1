40|$|<b>Annular</b> <b>plate</b> {{structures}} {{are commonly used}} in MEMS devices, particularly in pumps and valves. In MEMS applications, large nonlinear deflections are routinely achieved. In this paper, the nonlinear buckling of a thin elastic <b>annular</b> <b>plate</b> under a compressive radial force acting in {{the plane of the}} plate is considered. Although the critical loads at which buckling starts can be determined by solving a linear eigenvalue problem, the large deflection behavior of a buckled plate beyond the critical loads can be described by the nonlinear theory proposed by von Kármán. The buckling loads of the <b>annular</b> <b>plate</b> for various boundary conditions are calculated and the post-buckling behaviors are examined. Interestingly, the buckling of an <b>annular</b> <b>plate</b> exhibits a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation. Thus, the post-buckling behavior is stable and will not collapse catastrophically. Several design implications for microfabricated structures, in particular microvalves, are also given...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Circular and <b>annular</b> <b>plates</b> {{are widely}} used in {{machinery}} as basic components. Their torsional vibration behaviour is studied in this article. An analytical model is developed, and the natural frequencies and mode shapes are calculated for the torsional vibration under different boundary conditions. A physical insight is gained into the torsional vibration behaviour of cir-cular and <b>annular</b> <b>plates.</b> Results show that the torsional vibration behaviour of circular and <b>annular</b> <b>plates</b> is different {{compared with that of}} circular shafts. Torque moment in <b>annular</b> <b>plates</b> is transmitted via ring layers from the inner ring to the outer ring and vice versa. In addition, the torsional vibration magnitude in terms of angular displacement decreases with increase in radius. This {{can be explained by the}} fact that, when vibration energy is transmitted from the inner ring to the outer ring, the circle becomes larger and the energy density becomes lower. It is similar to the situation of a spherical wave propagation from its source. The analytical results are verified using an FEA model. Good agreement is shown between the analytical and FEA models...|$|R

We calculated various impacts of different <b>annular</b> <b>plate</b> parameters on the ultimate bearing capacity. And also, the relationship between of them was summarized. Instruction With the development of economy in China, great demand for power transmission capacity is increased, which has raised several problems for power transmission line. The power transmission tower is of key importance to the whole transmission line. Angle steel tower {{is one of the}} traditional styles in power transmission.

40|$|It is {{suitable}} to reduce thickness of circular saw {{when trying to}} enhance usability of wood raw material, but reducing thickness also causes reduction of permissible rotational speed which reduces sawing speed. If one increase circular saw rotational speed over permissible one the quality of machined surfaces will reduce because of enhanced vibrations.

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{free vibration}} analysis of circular and <b>annular</b> <b>plates</b> is presented via the Chebyshev-Ritz method. The solution procedure {{is based on}} the linear, small strain, three-dimensional elasticity theory. Selecting Chebyshev polynomials which can be expressed in terms of cosine functions as the admissible functions, a convenient governing eigenvalue equation can be derived through the Ritz method. According to the geometric properties of circular and <b>annular</b> <b>plates,</b> the vibration is divided into three distinct categories: axisymmetric vibration, torsional vibration and circumferential vibration. Each vibration category can be further subdivided into the antisymmetric and symmetric ones in the thickness direction. Convergence and comparison study demonstrated the high accuracy and efficiency of the present method. The present approach shows a distinct advantage over some other Ritz solutions in that stable numerical operation can be guaranteed even when a large number of admissible functions is employed. Therefore, not only lower-order but also higher-order eigenfrequencies can be obtained by using sufficient terms of the Chebyshev polynomials. Finally, some valuable results for <b>annular</b> <b>plates</b> with one or both edges clamped are given and discussed in detail. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In this investigation, a generalized Fourier series method is proposed for the in-plane vibration analysis of <b>annular</b> <b>plates</b> with arbitrary boundary conditions along each of its edges. Regardless of the boundary conditions, the in-plane displacement fields are invariantly expressed as a new form of trigonometric series expansions with a drastically improved convergence as compared with the conventional Fourier series.

Unlike most of the existing studies, the presented method can be readily and universally applied to a wide spectrum of in-plane vibration problems involving different boundary conditions, varying material, and geometric properties with no need of modifying the basic functions or adapting solution procedures.
