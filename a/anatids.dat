2500|$|The <b>anatids</b> are {{generally}} seasonal and monogamous breeders. The level of monogamy varies within the family; {{many of the}} smaller ducks only maintain the bond for a single season and find a new partner the following year, whereas the larger swans, geese {{and some of the}} more territorial ducks maintain pair bonds over a number of years, and even for life in some species. [...] Anatidae are remarkable for being one of the few families of birds to possess a penis; most species are adapted for copulation on the water only. They construct simple nests from whatever material is close at hand, often lining them with a layer of down plucked from the mother's breast. In most species, only the female incubates the eggs. The young are precocial, and are able to feed themselves from birth. One aberrant species, the black-headed duck, is an obligate brood parasite, laying its eggs in the nests of gulls and coots. While this species never raises its own young, a number of other ducks occasionally lay eggs in the nests of conspecifics (members of the same species) in addition to raising their own broods.|$|E

5000|$|Subfossil {{remains of}} a small, flightless dabbling duck have been {{recovered}} on Rota in the Mariana Islands. These cannot be assigned to a known genus, but probably are closest to Anas.

50|$|The {{life cycle}} of T. regenti is {{analogous}} to that of human schistosomes. Adult flukes mate in a nasal mucosa of <b>anatid</b> birds (e.g. Anas platyrhynchos and Cairina moschata) and produce eggs with miracidia which hatch directly in the host tissue and leak outside when the bird is drinking/feeding. Once in water, the miracidia swim using their cilia and actively search for a proper molluscan intermediate host (Radix lagotis, Radix labiata, Radix peregra). In the snail, the miracidia develop into a primary sporocyst in which secondary sporocysts are formed and give rise to cercariae later on.|$|R

50|$|The {{relationships}} of the enigmatic Geochen rhuax were long unresolved.

It was another prehistoric Big Island form and remains known only from some parts of a single bird's skeleton, which were much damaged because the bird apparently died in a volcanic eruption, with the bones being found in an ash-filled depression under a lava flow. A presumed relation to the shelducks proposed by Lester Short in 1970 was generally considered highly unlikely due to that group's biogeography, but more recently, bones of a shelduck-like bird have been found on Kaua‘i. Whether this latter <b>anatid</b> was indeed a shelduck is presently undetermined.|$|R
50|$|After Portis, {{no studies}} {{were made and}} the only {{mentions}} of the species in scientific literature were listings in catalogues; most recently, Jiří Mlíkovský placed the species as incertae sedis (position uncertain) among birds in 2002. The only illustration of the fossil was the lithograph from Gastaldi's 1868 paper, which remains an important documentation of the fossil since much of the distal part of the wing has been lost. The first reexamination of the species was made in a paper by Gerald Mayr and Marco Pavia published in 2014. Mayr and Pavia showed the species to have morphological features not present in any other <b>anatid.</b> According to them, it most likely is a highly unusual anatine, falling outside the three main tribes (Anatini, Mergini and Aythini). Accordingly, they placed the species in its own genus, taking the name Bambolinetta from its type locality.|$|R

50|$|Although swans only reach sexual {{maturity}} between 4 and 7 years of age, they can form socially monogamous pair bonds from {{as early as}} 20 months that last for many years, {{and in some cases}} these can last for life. The lifespan of the mute swan is often over 10 years, and sometimes over 20, whereas the black-necked swan survives for less than a decade in captivity. These bonds are maintained year-round, even in gregarious and migratory species like the tundra swan, which congregate in large flocks in the wintering grounds. Their nest is on the ground near water and about a metre across. Unlike many other ducks and geese, the male helps with the nest construction. Average egg size (for the mute swan) is 113×74 mm, weighing 340 g, in a clutch size of 4 to 7, and an incubation period of 34-45 days. With the exception of the whistling ducks they are the only <b>anatids</b> where the males aid in incubating the eggs.|$|E
5000|$|Surveys {{conducted}} by P.

40|$|Anseriformes, or waterfowl, {{are related}} to Galliformes (chickens and kin), {{together}} forming the most basal sister of Neoaves. The order is generally considered to comprise four families: Presbyornithidae (Late Cretaceous - Eocene); Anseranatidae (Paleocene-present); Anhimidae (Oligocene-present); Anatidae (Oligocene-present), but the giant Tertiary flightless taxa Dromornithidae (Australia), Gastornithidae (Eurasia) and Diatrymidae (North America) have also been referred to the order. Australasia presently has a unique waterfowl fauna characterized by low species diversity but high phylogenetic diversity: the Magpie Goose Anseranas (the sole surviving anseranatid), several monotypic endemic <b>anatid</b> genera of uncertain relationships (Cape Barren Goose Cereopsis, Freckled Duck Stictonetta, Pinkeared Duck Malacorhynchus and Musk Duck Biziura), several relatively primitive taxa (the aforementioned plus whistling ducks Dendrocygna and Blue-billed Duck Oxyura). The evolutionary history of this fauna has, until now, not been examined via the fossil record. In this thesis, the literature for the global fossil record of Anseranatidae and Anatidae is reviewed. The Neogene (Oligocene-Pliocene) fossil record of Anseriformes, exclusive of dromornithids, is studied from both New Zealand and Australia. For New Zealand, all materials derive from the St Bathans Fauna, Early Miocene (19 - 16 Ma), Otago. Herein, the first description of this fauna is provided, with four <b>anatid</b> genera (Manuherikia, Dunstanetta, Matanas and Miotadorna) established for five species, with a sixth taxon reported (Chapter 2). The phylogenetic affinities of Manuherikia, Dunstanetta and Miotadorna are examined using parsimony analysis of morphological data (133 characters) in Chapter 3. Miotadorna is a shelduck related to tadornines, perhaps sister to Tadorna, and Manuherikia and Dunstanetta are oxyurines related to the Stictonetta, Malacorhynchus, Oxyura and Biziura). A further species of Manuherikia {{and the existence of}} definite anserines, probably related to Cereopsis, are described in Chapter 4. The fossil record of Australian anseriforms is described in Chapters 5 - 8. The Oligo- Miocene record derives principally from the Etadunna and Namba Formations (26 - 24 Ma) in the Lake Eyre and Frome Basins, respectively, in South Australia. Four taxa are described, with all occurring both in the Namba and Etadunna Formations: a single genus, Pinpanetta, is established for three species and another, Australotadorna, for a tadornine. Phylogenetic analyses (parsimony and Bayesian) of a dataset (150 characters, 61 taxa) show Pinpanetta is an oxyurine and confirm the previously found oxyurine affinity of Manuherikia and Dunstanetta. A monophyletic clade with moderate support is found for an expanded Oxyurinae that has Stictonetta basal, followed successively by Mionetta (Oligo- Miocene of Europe), Malacorhynchus, Pinpanetta, Manuherikia, Dunstanetta, Oxyura and Nomonyx, Biziura and Thalassornis. This same analysis finds anserines the most basal group in Anatidae, so changing position with Dendrocygna, considered by recent authors to be the most basal <b>anatid.</b> A new genus and species of anseranatid is described from a Faunal Zone A (System A, Late Oligocene) deposit at Riversleigh, northwestern Queensland (Chapter 6). This first pre-Pliocene record of the family in Australia is of equivalent age to the youngest European fossil anseranatid, Anserpica from France, but younger than the Eocene Anatalavis of England. Only one of three other waterfowl bones known from Riversleigh deposits is identifiable and is referred to a species of Pinpanetta found in the Etadunna Formation. Mid-Late Miocene deposits containing waterfowl are restricted in Australia to just the Waite Formation (c. 8 Ma) at Alcoota in the Northern Territory. Three bones indicate an undetermined tadornine and an undetermined <b>anatid,</b> different from any known species. The Pliocene record of anseriforms in South Australia is described from the Tirari Formation (Kanunka and Toolapinna Faunas) (Chapter 7). Nine modern species (Anseranas semipalmata, Cereopsis novaehollandiae, Cygnus atratus, Tadorna tadornoides, Biziura lobata, Oxyura australis, Anas cf A. castanea, A. cf A. gracilis and Aythya australis) are represented. A single extinct species, Tirarinetta kanunka, is described and referred to Oxyurinae. From the Parilla Sands, Late Pliocene, at Bookmark Cliffs on the Murray River, a single humerus is described (Chapter 8) and referred to Tadorna cf. T. tadornoides. A total of 11 <b>anatid</b> taxa is described from latest Oligocene-Early Miocene deposits in Australasia, which considerably adds to the global record of seven species previously reported for this period. Considering also the anseranatids, the Late Oligocene – Early Miocene fauna of Australia is thus established as having equivalent diversity to that from similar-aged deposits in Europe, but by the late Early Miocene, the New Zealand fauna was more diverse than any other Oligo-Miocene fauna known. The more limited samples available, compared to those from New Zealand, probably explain the lack of a similar diversity being revealed for Australia from this period. In both Australia and New Zealand, the Oligo-Miocene faunas are dominated by oxyurine taxa, as were those in Europe. The presence of a tadornine in Australia in the latest Oligocene and another in New Zealand in the Early Miocene precede the appearance of this subfamily in the Northern Hemisphere by 10 Ma, implying a southern origin for this group. The Late Oligocene presence of Mionetta in Europe and of Pinpanetta in Australia, and their referral to Oxyurinae, establishes a minimum age for the origin of this subfamily in the latest Oligocene. The establishment of a fauna comprised of modern species by the Pliocene indicates substantial faunal turnover probably in the Late Miocene. This turnover {{is due in part to}} immigration of taxa (Cygnus, Anas, Aythya) and in situ evolution (all endemic genera), as occurred in other Australian vertebrates (rodents, snakes, bats). Thus faunal composition in Australia appears to have been more affected by attainment of some threshold in proximity to Asia being breached by the northward continental drift of Australia, than by aridification, which has been ongoing since the Middle Miocene.

40|$|Zooarchaeological {{evidence}} indicates that birds played a smaller role in the economy of Roman than medieval Britain. Ducks are more common than geese in Roman sites while the opposite {{is the case for}} the medieval period, the change occurring soon {{after the end of the}} Roman period (i. e. the Anglo-Saxon period in England). Documentary, iconographic and archaeological evidence from inside and outside Britain indicates that while the goose was probably already domesticated by the 3 rd millennium BC, a proper system of duck husbandry was only developed rather late and was not yet fully in place by Roman times. Bearing in mind the higher frequency of duck bones in Roman Britain, we must conclude that in this country goose husbandry was also little developed and that all <b>anatid</b> bones found in British Roman sites probably derive from wild rather than domestic birds. Goose husbandry increased in importance in medieval times but most duck bones found in this period may also be wild, particularly in the earlier part of the Middle Ages...|$|R
