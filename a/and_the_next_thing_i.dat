60|$|A {{lull in the}} {{conversation}} followed, but Hasluck was not thin-skinned, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> distinguished was his cheery laugh.|$|E
60|$|At last, I fell asleep, {{dreaming about}} Harry {{fighting}} a duel of dice-boxes with the military-looking man below; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> knew, was {{the glare of}} a light before my eyes, and Harry himself, very pale, stood before me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Get his number? I didn't {{have time}} to get anything. He just slid by, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> knew, I was turning a {{somersault}} in the air and diving right down into the bottom of that hole;" [...] and at this remark the other cadets had to smile.|$|E
60|$|Her window {{commanded}} {{the front of}} <b>the</b> house; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> she saw was a clergyman walk up <b>and</b> enter <b>the</b> door.|$|R
6000|$|Benita sank to <b>the</b> ground, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> {{that she}} could {{remember}} was hearing the soft voice of Jacob Meyer, who said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In the Light Dragoons?" [...] asked Rosamond. [...] "Oh! then I {{knew him}} at Edinburgh! A man with yellow whiskers, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> to a stutter." ...|$|R
6000|$|She fled behind us. He followed, but Seti, crying, [...] "Ah, I thought it," [...] leapt between them, {{as he did}} so {{drawing the}} iron sword which he wore with his {{ceremonial}} dress. At him he sprang <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> saw was the red point of the sword standing out beyond the priest's shoulders.|$|E
60|$|I laughed. She laughed. We {{both looked}} at one another; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> {{remember}} was that I had drawn down Isaline's plump little face close to mine, and was kissing it vigorously, in spite of an acute darting pain at each kiss all along my spine and into my marrow-bones. Poor M. Claude was utterly forgotten.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{began to}} run, but {{something}} in the taste of that sweet caused me to drop it from my lips. Then all grew misty, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> remember was finding myself {{in the arms of}} the younger Eastern, with the nurse and her 'cousin,' a stalwart person like a soldier, standing in front of us.|$|E
6000|$|... "True, true; my sentiments again. Geniality has invaded each {{department}} and profession. We have genial senators, genial authors, genial lecturers, genial doctors, genial clergymen, genial surgeons, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> {{we shall have}} genial hangmen." ...|$|R
60|$|That {{very day}} Henery Walker was shot. Several gentlemen fired at a rabbit that was started, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> they knew Henery Walker {{was lying on}} the ground calling out that 'is leg 'ad been shot off.|$|R
60|$|And--who knows?--the gods may be kind, other drinks may come, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> night {{culminate in}} glorious greatness. <b>And</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> you know, you {{are lined up}} at the bar, pouring drinks down your throat <b>and</b> {{learning}} <b>the</b> gentlemen's names <b>and</b> <b>the</b> offices which they hope to fill.|$|R
6000|$|... "Her little, {{worn-out}} frame {{dropped back}} upon the bed, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> remember is snatching up a pillow, and holding it tight-pressed against Jeanie's face for fear {{the sound of}} her sobs should penetrate into the next room; and afterwards we both got out, somehow, by the other door, and rushed downstairs, and clung {{to each other in the}} back kitchen.|$|E
60|$|I {{know not}} what I stammered, to excuse myself, to explain; but I went toward her, {{to tell her}} I meant no harm. She waved me off with her old hands, {{retreating}} before me in horror; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> knew she had fallen back with a quick spasm, as if death had descended on her, into Miss Tita's arms.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{like that}} myself," [...] assented Ronny Devereux. [...] "That dashed trip from Calais gets me every time. Bowls me right over. I go aboard, stoked to the eyebrows with sea-sick remedies, {{swearing}} {{that this time}} I'll fool 'em, but down I go ten minutes after we've started <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> know is somebody saying, 'Well, well! So this is Dover!'" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> Aaron was {{conscious}} of {{was the sound of}} trumpets. A sudden startling challenge of trumpets, and out of nowhere a sudden rush of grey-green carabinieri battering the crowd wildly with truncheons. It was so sudden that Aaron heard nothing any more. He only saw.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{out of my}} camp, too," [...] said Matlack, [...] "but I'm {{bound to}} report it. The bicycle fellow that you hired a gun to don't know the fust thing about usin' it, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> you'll hear will be that he's shot his pardner, who's worth six of him." ...|$|R
60|$|I did {{not hear}} {{anything}} about it for some time afterwards: I remember them coming in at <b>the</b> gate, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sight of Polly's face, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> that I recollect, was that I was laying on the sofa, with Polly crying softly over me, and Dr. Whitmore standing beside me.|$|R
6000|$|... "All right," [...] says I, [...] "I'll {{wait till}} you're through with this." [...] And I sat right {{down beside her}} on the floor, and set to smooth her hair with my hand. At first she wriggled away when I touched her; then she seemed to notice me no more; then her sobs grew {{gradually}} less, and presently stopped; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> knew, she raised her face to mine.|$|E
60|$|I smiled, groped with my hand, {{opened my}} eyes in the dimness to answer her. But a black cloud came over them; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> recall is waking to find myself being carried along in her arms, cold and half lifeless; and she {{actually}} breaking ever and again into a shambling run, as she searched my face in what seemed, even to my scarcely conscious brain, an extravagant anxiety.|$|E
6000|$|... "It wasn't Taft. He only {{looks like}} him. It was that kid Ogden up where I work. He came butting into the gym, joshing me about--makin' pers'nal remarks till I kind of lost my goat, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> knew I {{was giving him}} his!" [...] A faint gleam of {{pleasure}} lightened the gloom of his face. [...] "I cert'nly give him his!" [...] The gleam faded. [...] "And after that--well, here I am!" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Just {{when you}} think the shit can't get much higher, Miles comes in <b>and</b> hits <b>the</b> wah-wahdown hard on <b>the</b> horn <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> you know, you're slappin' five to the man upstairs ... By the rite of Dark Magus, I can fake the cool in no time flat." [...] —Jason Josephes, Pitchfork ...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Author Jenna Blum {{described}} {{the process of}} creating a character: [...] "It feels like having a string dangle out of thin air and you pull on <b>the</b> string, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> you know, a sweater knits itself out of nowhere and you have a character who is made out of whole cloth." ...|$|R
60|$|There {{was some}} {{consultation}} {{here in a}} low voice, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> Richard heard distinctly was, {{that one of the}} Nobles held up a silver chain and key, {9} saying that they had been found on <b>the</b> Duke's neck, <b>and</b> that he had kept them, thinking that they doubtless led to something of importance.|$|R
60|$|Arter {{that things}} ’appened so quick, I hardly knew whether I was {{standing}} on my ’cad or my heels. Both, I think. They was all on top o’ me at once, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> can remember {{is sitting on the}} ground in my shirt-sleeves listening to the potman, who was making a fearful fuss because somebody ’ad bit his ear ’arf off. My coat was ripped up the back, and one of the draymen was holding up my arm and showing them all the mermaid, while the other struck matches so as they could see better.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{admit that}} the old Berserk blood of the Smiths boiled at that juncture. I picked up a sleep-producer from the floor, as Comrade Brady would say, {{and handed it to}} the big-stick merchant. He went down like a sack of coal over the bookcase, and at that moment I rather fancy the other gentleman must have got busy with his club. At any rate, {{somebody}} suddenly loosed off some fifty thousand dollars' worth of fireworks, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> knew was that the curtain had risen for the next act on me, discovered sitting in a prison cell, with an out-size in lumps on my forehead." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{beginning}} to rain fast. Seeing nothing save what I had seen already, I turned back into the house, and stood just within {{the shelter of the}} doorway, looking out into the night. While I was considering that some one must have been there lately and must soon be coming back, or the candle would not be burning, it came into my head to look if the wick were long. I turned round to do so, and had taken up the candle in my hand, when it was extinguished by some violent shock; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> comprehended was, that I had been caught in a strong running noose, thrown over my head from behind.|$|E
2500|$|One of the 61 {{survivors}} of the Pan Am flight, John Coombs of Haleiwa, Hawaii, said that sitting in {{the nose of the}} plane probably saved his life: [...] "We all settled back, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> an explosion took place <b>and</b> <b>the</b> whole port side, left side of the plane, was just torn wide open." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There, now," [...] growled Galleygo, in Agnes' face, he {{being just}} then {{employed}} in surveying {{her through a}} pair of silver spectacles that were a present from his master, [...] "you see, he has forgotten <b>the</b> old Planter; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing,</b> he'll forget to eat his dinner. It's wicked, Sir Jarvy, to forget such a ship." ...|$|R
5000|$|The blocks {{are also}} marketed as {{potentially}} having utility {{as a way}} to establish disaster relief shelters which can be quickly created and later dis-assembled for reuse in another location. In an interview with Wired Magazine, company founder, Arnon Rosan, stated [...] "You could drop two pallets of these by helicopter <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> you know you have a solid, rigid structure." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{first thing}} I did on {{getting to the}} dining-room was to open the window. I had half a mind to smash it, so as to give an extra bit of local colour to the affair, but decided not to {{on account of the}} noise. I had put my lantern on the table, and was just {{reaching}} out for it, when something happened. What it was for the moment I couldn't have said. It might have been an explosion of some sort or an earthquake. Some solid object caught me a frightful whack on the chin. Sparks and things occurred inside my head <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> remember is feeling something wet and cold splash into my face, and hearing a voice that sounded like old Bill's say, [...] "Feeling better now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have little}} more to say, and it's as well, for I am about done up. I went on cabbing it {{for a day or}} so, {{intending}} to keep at it until I could save enough to take me back to America. I was standing in the yard when a ragged youngster asked if there was a cabby there called Jefferson Hope, and said that his cab was wanted by a gentleman at 221B, Baker Street. I went round, suspecting no harm, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> knew, this young man here had the bracelets on my wrists, and as neatly snackled [27] as ever I saw in my life. That's the whole of my story, gentlemen. You may consider me to be a murderer; but I hold that I am just as much an officer of justice as you are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just {{then the}} dern brute jumped right plum onto the feller and knocked him down, machine and all; {{for a minute}} or two it was just a mixture o' man and lion, then that feller come up top, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> seen he batted the lion with his box, and that kind o' stunted the brute, and he hit him again and glass began to fly; he was game all right, that feller was. When the lion {{stiffened}} out, he turned to where I was a-rollin' on the pine-needles, and says, quiet-like, 'Give me your revolver, please.' I give it to him, and he put it to the lion's ear and finished him. When he got up and looked at his machine he says, 'How much is a mountain-lion skin worth?' ''Bout four dollars, green,' I says. He looked at the inwards of his box, which was scattered all over the ground. Says he, 'You wouldn't call that profitable, would you--a seventy-dollar instrument in exchange for a four-dollar pelt?'" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I figured {{there would}} be no way to get {{approval}} to film on the Marine base," [...] Brown recalls. [...] "Steve McQueen said he’d see what he could find out. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> day he called and was told to contact some General <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> you know we are shooting the beach sequences. It was pretty amazing the doors he was able to open." ...|$|R
60|$|The men {{remained}} quite silent {{when they}} reached <b>the</b> shore; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> audible to <b>the</b> two at the top was the dip of heavy oars, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> dashing of waves against a boat's bow. In a moment the keel gently touched <b>the</b> shingle, <b>and</b> Stockdale heard <b>the</b> footsteps of the thirty-six carriers running forwards over the pebbles towards the point of landing.|$|R
5000|$|Jared Corn {{testified that}} as he was walking towards his friend's house Gonzalez confronted Corn, telling him to [...] "back the 'f' up." [...] Corn asserts that he raised his hands into <b>the</b> air <b>and</b> {{proceeded}} to back up, while Gonzalez continued to advance towards him. Corn told police that Gonzalez fired, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> he remembers was waking up on his back.|$|R
