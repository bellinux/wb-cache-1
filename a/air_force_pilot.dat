5|$|Under severe {{pressure}} from his ministers {{to resolve this}} issue, Field travelled to England in March 1964 to pursue sovereign statehood, but returned empty-handed a month later. He resigned his position on 13 April; this {{came as no surprise}} to many government insiders, but appeared sudden to most sections of the general public. Smith promptly accepted the cabinet's invitation to take over, though he expressed surprise at the nomination. A farmer and erstwhile British Royal <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> <b>pilot</b> from the rural town of Selukwe, Smith was Southern Rhodesia's first native-born head of government.

5|$|Bill Pugh, {{the chief}} {{plastics}} designer at Cascelloid, based in Leicester, and former Royal <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> <b>pilot,</b> created {{a prototype of}} the blown lemon-shaped plastic shaped container based upon Hack's idea sometime in the 1950s, {{as well as other}} types of blown containers. Pugh's experimented with the initial design until he was satisfied with its appearance. This plastic lemon product was then used for Hax lemon juice. Edward Hack, Ltd. produced and marketed Hax brand squeezable plastic lemon containers filled with two ounces of Sicilian lemon juice. Per Edward Hack, Ltd., the juice was unfiltered, had no water added to it, and contained a preservative to prevent spoilage. Retailers could purchase the product in packs of six bags that contained 12 squeeze packs each, totalling 72 units. Upon introduction to the marketplace, Hax juice and the plastic lemon design received some press coverage. The Hax logo used on Hax lemon juice dates back to at least 1935, at which time it was used in advertisements for Hax brand iodine pencils and Hax brand aspirin.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, Simpson and Co. {{arranged}} for a test flight by the first aeroplane in Madras while a flying club was established at the Mount Golf Club grounds near St Thomas Mount by a pilot named G. Vlasto in October 1929. This site was later used as the Madras aerodrome. One of the early members of the club, Rajah Sir Annamalai Chettiar went on to establish an aerodrome in his native Chettinad. On 15 October 1932, Royal <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> <b>pilot</b> Nevill Vintcent piloted J. R. D. Tata's plane carrying air-mail from Bombay to Madras via Bellary. This {{was the beginning of}} Tata Sons' regular domestic passenger and airmail service from Karachi to Madras. The flight was later re-routed through Hyderabad and became bi-weekly. On 26 November 1935, Tata Sons started an experimental weekly service from Bombay to Trivandrum via Goa and Cannanore. From 28 February 1938, onwards, Tata Sons' Aviation division, now renamed Tata Airlines, began a Karachi to Colombo airmail service via Madras and Trichinopoly. On 2 March 1938, the Bombay-Trivandrum air service was extended to Trichinopoly.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis analyzes {{the factors that}} are associated with separation behavior among United States <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> <b>pilots.</b> Additionally, the effect of commissioning source on separation was analyzed. Logistic regression models were estimated for U. S. <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> <b>pilots</b> commissioned between 1994 and 2006. Data records utilized in this thesis were obtained from Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC). Demographics and professional/educational factors were included in the models to analyze their effects on the separation decision. By identifying the determinants of separation, the thesis attempts to suggest ways in which decision makers might reduce losses among <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> <b>pilots.</b> Turkish <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> author...|$|R
5|$|The F-4 {{was used}} {{extensively}} during the Vietnam War. It {{served as the}} principal air superiority fighter for both the Navy and Air Force, and became important in the ground-attack and aerial reconnaissance roles late in the war. The Phantom has {{the distinction of being}} the last U.S. fighter flown by pilots who attained ace status in the 20th century. During the Vietnam War, one U.S. <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> <b>pilot</b> and two weapon systems officers (WSOs), and one U.S. Navy pilot and one radar intercept officer (RIO) became aces by achieving five aerial kills against enemy fighter aircraft. The F-4 continued to form a major part of U.S. military air power throughout the 1970s and 1980s, being gradually replaced by more modern aircraft such as the F-15 Eagle and F-16 in the U.S. Air Force, the Grumman F-14 Tomcat in the U.S. Navy, and the F/A-18 Hornet in the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps.|$|E
5|$|Værnes {{was taken}} into use by the Royal Norwegian Army in 1887. The first flight was made in 1914, and aerodrome {{facilities}} were gradually installed. The first main installations, including three concrete runways, were built during World War II by Luftwaffe. After the war, the <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> <b>Pilot</b> School moved to Værnes, although in 1954 {{most of the other}} air force activities for Central Norway were moved to Ørland Main Air Station. Civilian aviation started in 1951, when half a barracks {{was taken into}} use as a terminal, with the whole building being utilized from 1958. Jet aircraft started serving Værnes from 1963, and the second terminal opened in 1965. The third (the current international Terminal B) was opened in 1982, and the fourth, Terminal A, was opened in 1994, along with the train station. From 1956 to 2004, Braathens was one of the largest airlines at the airport.|$|E
5|$|Balu plays continual pranks on Geetha, {{during the}} course of which he also falls in love with her. She falls in love with him but circumstances, and their egos, prevent them both from expressing their feelings. One day, Balu pretends to suffer from chest pain, which scares Geetha, causing her to finally admit that she loves him. Later, when Geetha and Ramaiah go to Balu to enquire about his health, Balu, exiting from the bathroom, fails to see that Geetha is there. He tells Ramaiah about the prank he played on her, and that he was only pretending to have chest pain. Angry that she has been deceived by Balu, she begins to {{question}} whether or not his professed love for her is real. Hurt, she brings her friends, who are on a holiday trip to Shimla, to the residence and tries to drive Balu out of the house. When her plan backfires and her friends start supporting Balu, she becomes spiteful and tells her parents to move forward with a planned marriage to Sekar (S. A. Ashokan), a relative and an <b>air</b> <b>force</b> <b>pilot.</b>|$|E
