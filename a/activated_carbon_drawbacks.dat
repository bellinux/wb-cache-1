40|$|The {{adsorption}} {{efficacy of}} 16 pharmaceuticals on six different <b>activated</b> <b>carbons</b> is correlated to the thermodynamic work of adhesion, which was derived following the surface tension component approach. Immersion calorimetry {{was used to}} determine the surface tension components of <b>activated</b> <b>carbon,</b> while contact angle measurements on compressed plates were used to determine these for solutes. We found that the acid-base surface tension components of <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> correlated to the <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> oxygen content. Solute-water interaction correlated well to their solubility, although four solutes deviated from the trend. In the interaction between solute and <b>activated</b> <b>carbon,</b> van der Waals interactions were dominant and explained 65 - 94 % of the total interaction energy, depending on the hydrophobicity of the <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> and solute. A reasonable relationship (r 2 > 70) was found between the calculated work of adhesion and the experimentally determined <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> loading. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

2500|$|The {{simplest}} type of aquarium filter consists only of filter {{wool and}} <b>activated</b> <b>carbon.</b> The filter wool traps large debris and particles, and the <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> adsorbs smaller impurities. These {{should be changed}} regularly at suitable intervals. [...] This is particularly important {{in the case of}} <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> filters, which may re-release their adsorbed contents in large (and therefore harmful) doses if they are allowed to saturate. <b>Activated</b> <b>carbon</b> adsorbs toxins on the extended porous surface of the carbon. It cannot be reactivated by boiling in water. The adsorption of <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> can be restored by thermal regeneration at temperatures of 500–900°C (932–1,652°F), electrochemical regeneration, ultrasound, or other industrial processes. For the aquarist, replacing the <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> with fresh material is simple and inexpensive.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{synthesis of}} <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> particles by {{pyrolysis of wood}} fibers and their dispersion in urea formaldehyde with an aim to optimize a stable <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> particles/urea formaldehyde adhesives. All the adhesive hybrids were characterized with X-ray diffractometry (XRD) Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), while the dispersion of <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> particles was studied with Field Emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) shows that <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> particles have little high effect in the thermal stability of the UF adhesive. It is observe in the TGA graph that the thermal stability of the UF based <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> particles is higher that UF only. The scanning micrograph provide confirmation of the smoother surfaces in the UF adhesive made with <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> particles...|$|R

The from <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> was characterized using an Infrared Spectrometer, an X-ray diffraction, an Scanning Electron Microscope, and a gas sorption analyzer. The best <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> for adsorbing phenol was the <b>activated</b> <b>carbon</b> that prodused from the burning of rice husk at a temperature 400 oC and activated with 10 % of ZnCl 2 for 24 hours.
