According to the author, the novel {{set out to}} explore the question: [...] "What will become {{of the human being}} if he keeps living like he lives now?" [...] Döblin would later write that the {{original}} inspiration for the novel was the sight of pebbles rolling in the surf on the Baltic Sea coast during a family vacation in the summer of 1921; this epiphanic vision provoked a sudden and uncharacteristic interest in nature for Döblin, who began taking extensive notes in various Berlin museums and libraries on natural history and science, geology, geography, climatology, ethnography, and other fields. If he had originally conceived of the novel as a [...] "hymn to the city" [...] and to technology, as he got into the project it increasingly became an encomium to nature. In early 1922 he closed his medical practice for a month to further his research for the novel. The section on Iceland and Greenland, which occurs {{towards the end of the}} published novel, was one of the first sections Döblin envisioned and drafted, and an <b>advance</b> <b>publication</b> of this section appeared in the Vossische Zeitung on New Year's Day 1922 with the title Die Enteisung Grönlands im Jahre 2500. Das Zauberschiff (The Melting of Greenland's Ice in the Year 2500: The Magical Ship). In May 1922 Döblin rented a villa in Zehlendorf to complete the draft of the novel, a setting explicitly referenced in the novel's unusual [...] "Dedication". The exertions of drafting the novel provoked a sort of nervous breakdown: as he would later write, [...] "the fantasy was too wild and my brain would not release me." [...] In a 2011 biography, Wilfried Schoeller has suggested that there was an additional reason for Döblin's breakdown—namely, that the temporary move to Zehlendorf was also his unsuccessful attempt to leave his wife in favor of his lover Charlotte Niclas. According to Schoeller, this personal dimension left its mark on the novel, especially on the novel's dedication.|$|E

50|$|In Italy, {{a utility}} model (in Italian: 'Modello d'utilità') is {{considered}} to be new if it does not form part {{of the state of the}} art. The state of the art comprises any knowledge made available to the public by means of a written or oral disclosure, anywhere in the World, before the filing date of the application or the priority date (if claimed). The utility model must also involve an inventive step, i.e. machines, devices or items which are claimed in the utility models must be more effective and/or easier to use than the ones according to prior art. Utility models cannot claim processes or methods. At the time of filing the application a filing fee is due which also covers the maintenance for years 1 to 4. No claim fee is provided. The Italian Patent and Trademark Office (UIBM) does not perform substantive examination of the application in order to assess novelty and inventive step of what is claimed; the examination is limited to formal requirements only. Publication occurs at 18 months from the filing date or the oldest priority date, if any; at the time of filing the application the applicant may request <b>advance</b> <b>publication,</b> which normally occurs within 90 days. In any case only bibliographic data are published after 1 month from the filing. Grant generally occurs within 2 years. The validity of an Italian utility model is ascertained by the Judge and his/her technical expert, during litigation. At the end of the fourth year from the filing of the application, a maintenance fee for the years 5 to 10 falls due. Foreign companies/residents must indicate an address of service in Italy, that may correspond to the domicile of a lawyer or, as always occurs, a chartered patent attorney.|$|E

In {{the spirit of the}} Open Science movement, <b>advance</b> <b>publication</b> of protocols for clinical trials is now being advocated by BioMed Central, BMJ Open and others. Simultaneously, participants are becoming increasingly active in their pursuit and sharing of trial- and health- related information. Whilst access to protocols alongside published trial findings has clear benefits, <b>advance</b> <b>publication</b> of trial protocols is potentially problematic for trials of complex behavioural interventions. In this article we explain, with examples, how this could lead to unblinding, 2 ̆ 018 contamination 2 ̆ 019 between intervention and control groups and deliberate biasing of assessment outcomes by participants. We discuss potential solutions and demonstrate the need for public debate about how this issue is best managed. Conclusion Triallists may still be underestimating participants 2 ̆ 019 interest in information. This needs to change: joint and open discussions with the public are needed to inform how we should proceed...|$|E

40|$|<b>Advance</b> <b>Publication</b> first posted online on 15 July 2016 - Accepted manuscriptThe cyclic nucleotides, cAMP and cGMP, {{are the key}} {{molecules}} controlling mammalian oocyte meiosis. Their {{roles in}} oocyte biology {{have been at the}} forefront of oocyte research for decades and many of the long standing controversies in relation to the regulation of oocyte meiotic maturation are now resolved. It is now clear that the follicle prevents meiotic resumption through the actions of natriuretic peptides and cGMP inhibiting the hydrolysis of intra-oocyte cAMP and that the preovulatory gonadotrophin surge reverses these processes. The gonadotrophin surge also leads to a transient spike in cAMP in the somatic compartment of the follicle; research over the past 2 decades has conclusively demonstrated that this surge in cAMP is important for the subsequent developmental capacity of the oocyte. This is important, as oocyte in vitro maturation (IVM) systems practiced clinically do not recapitulate this cAMP surge in vitro, possibly accounting for the lower efficiency of IVM compared to clinical IVF. This review focuses in particular on this latter aspect - the role of cAMP/cGMP in the regulation of oocyte quality. We conclude that clinical practice of IVM should reflect this new understanding of the role of cyclic nucleotides, thereby creating a new generation of ART and fertility treatment options.

40|$|Abstract Background Spasticity {{of muscles}} {{is a common}} {{consequence}} of central nervous system impairment. Traditionally, neurological rehabilitation for spasticity has involved occupational and physical therapy; however, increasingly Botulinum toxin–A injections may be provided. Injection effects are temporary. Consequently, understanding the effect of adjunct physical therapies will help inform multimodal rehabilitation decisions. Presently, these effects are not known. This systematic review will identify and summarize evidence on physical therapies used after Botulinum toxin-A injection to improve motor function in adults with neurological impairments. Method Systematic searching of seven electronic databases will occur to identify relevant randomized trials. Available trial data will be extracted into a list of pre-defined primary outcomes, including range of movement, spasticity and functional limb use. Pre-defined secondary outcomes will also be reviewed where trials have these data available for reporting. Effects will be expressed as mean differences or standardized mean differences with 95 % confidence intervals (CI). Where possible, comparable results will be meta-analyzed, and {{a summary of the}} available pool of evidence produced. All randomized controlled trials will be rated using the PEDro methodological quality scale. Where possible, study data will be meta-analyzed using RevMan 5 Software. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO international prosepective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO 2011 :CRD 42011001491). Discussion Review results will be the most comprehensive answer available to the following question: Are physical therapies clinically effective after Botulinum toxin-A injections in adults with neurological spasticity? Results will inform healthcare providers and managers who determine who gets access to and provision of Botulinum toxin-A injection and whether this is done with or without physical therapies. Results will inform the clinicians who conduct physical therapy following injection. This protocol provides readers with the scope and depth of a search that will ultimately answer a complex and pressing treatment question. The variability of current practice and high level of expense associated with multimodal rehabilitation means review results will be more useful and less contestable if the protocol is revealed in full through <b>advance</b> <b>publication.</b> </p...|$|E
40|$|Since 1999 Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) {{has been}} {{operating}} J-STAGE (Japan Science and Technology Information Aggregator, Electronic), a system helping academic societies in Japan to create and publish their own electronic journals. J-STAGE supports the entire process of online publishing: submission / reception of research papers, peer review, judgment, editing, and loading articles on the web site. Users can search and retrieve articles by keywords or their bibliographic data, and they can view their abstracts and references, and can also download the full texts in PDF format. Access policy of each journal is decided by its publisher society. Most of the journals on JSTAGE are now freely accessible, but some journals require authentication to read full text. As {{of the end of}} March 2005, about 200 journals and 80 proceedings are currently published and about 130 thousand articles are loaded on J-STAGE. Number of accesses to top page in a year is about 2, 900, 000, and more than 250, 000 PDF are downloaded per month. In 2002, JST launched JST Link Center, which links electronic articles each other by accumulating linking data of electronic journals in cooperation with overseas linking organizations. Using JST Link Center, research papers released on J-STAGE are linked to articles on various worldwide electronic journal sites and bibliographic databases via CrossRef, PubMed link, ChemPort, and JOISLink. Links to the citing articles from the original cited articles have been now available among the articles on J-STAGE and the participating publishers in CrossRef's Forward Linking. JST has released new services like My J-STAGE, <b>advance</b> <b>publication,</b> HTML full text publication, and pay-per-view system. JST plans to collect more academic journals published in Japan on J-STAGE. The immediate target is more than 500 titles by the end of fiscal year 2006.
