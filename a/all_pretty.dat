Some more dance-y things I did about 10 years ago. Experimental things, noise things, weird things. Shitloads of stuff. They're <b>all</b> <b>pretty</b> much ready to go.|$|E

We'd just {{released}} our second album overseas on an independent label; and, spent time in America as an independent act. And that was around about the time where we started our own label, just to, um, release, maybe, release a few, some bands of friends of ours, in bands.|$|E

Krøyer presented it to his new parents-in-law on the occasion of their silver wedding on 17 October 1889. Marie commented on Stenbjerg in a letter to her friends Agnes and Harald Slott-Møller: [...] "I would certainly recommend Stenbjerg to you. It is a really pleasant place for a stay, such nice people; and the nature is impressive — but not at <b>all</b> <b>pretty.</b> Indeed it is rather desolate and saddening." ...|$|E

500|$|By 2015, the {{scheduled}} release dates for the sequels were each delayed by another year, {{with the first}} sequel expected {{to be released in}} December 2017; Cameron called the writing process [...] "a complex job". In June 2015, James Horner, who was reported to be engaged to write music for the franchise, was killed in a plane crash. In December, Cameron stated that he was [...] "doing another pass through all three scripts ... Just refining. That's in parallel with the design process. The design process is very mature at this point. We've been designing for {{about a year and a}} half. All the characters, settings and creatures are <b>all</b> <b>pretty</b> much [...]" [...] The following month, Fox announced a further release delay.|$|E
500|$|Kelly {{said that}} Donen's {{impulsive}} marriage to Coyne showed an emotional immaturity {{and lack of}} good judgment, and stated that [...] "Jeannie's marriage to Stanley was doomed from the start. Because every time Stanley looked at Jeannie, he saw Betsy, whom he loved; and every time Jeannie looked at Stanley, I guess she saw me. One way or another it was <b>all</b> <b>pretty</b> incestuous." [...] Kelly's marriage to Blair ended in 1957, after which he moved in with Coyne. They married in 1960 and had two children together. Coyne died of leukemia in 1973. In November 2012 the musical What A Glorious Feeling depicted both the making of Singin' in the Rain and the love triangle between Donen, Kelly and Coyne.|$|E
500|$|Continuing the band's {{prominent}} use of strings– {{which began}} with the 1982 single [...] "The Back of Love"– they recorded Ocean Rain using a 35-piece orchestra. Lead guitarist Will Sergeant said, [...] "We wanted to make something conceptual with lush orchestration; not Mantovani, something with a twist. It's <b>all</b> <b>pretty</b> dark. 'Thorn of Crowns' {{is based on an}} eastern scale. The whole mood is very windswept: European pirates, a bit Ben Gunn; dark and stormy, battering rain; all of that." [...] During recording De Freitas used xylophones and glockenspiels in addition to his usual percussion, bass player Les Pattinson used an old reverb machine at des Dames and Sergeant's solo on [...] "My Kingdom" [...] was played using a Washburn acoustic guitar which he distorted through a valve radio.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} well {{received}} by {{the cast and crew}} of The X-Files. Producer J.P. Finn praised the episode and Carter's directing, saying [...] "We were <b>all</b> <b>pretty</b> nervous doing that one, because Chris Carter was a new director. It turned out that he directed very...It was a great script, a great cast, and he ended up directing a home run. One of the charming things about it was the end, where we had these alien heads placed on young children. It was so endearing to see them on the set between takes, playing with Chris and everyone". Actor David Duchovny said of Carter's directing [...] "Chris came in meticulously prepared, which is his nature. I think his first episode was great". Carter himself described it as one of his favorite episodes because [...] "it was a chance for me to sort of do it all, and it came out in ways better than I imagined it would".|$|E
500|$|The name [...] "Foo Fighters" [...] {{was taken}} from the {{description}} World War II aircraft pilots would use to describe various UFOs. This science fiction theme is further continued with the name of Grohl's Capitol Records imprint, Roswell Records, a reference to the city of Roswell, New Mexico, known for the Roswell UFO incident of 1947; and the album cover done by Grohl's then-wife, photographer Jennifer Youngblood, featuring a Buck Rogers XZ-38 Disintegrator Pistol. Some reviewers considered the gun on the cover as insensitive, given Kurt Cobain died by shooting himself, but Grohl dutifully disregarded it as just a coincidence. [...] Goldsmith later explained, [...] "It was <b>all</b> <b>pretty</b> much based on the whole Foo Fighters thing—Roswell, the space stuff, an antique Buck Rogers raygun. It's really a completely separate thing. Dave wasn't even conscious of that." [...] Despite Grohl being the album's only contributor, at Capitol's insistence the liner notes included a picture of the full band that Grohl had recruited.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} the first to feature flashbacks with Sayid, an Arab character. The {{producers}} knew they had to tread carefully with the character due to possible prejudices against Arabs. The actor, Naveen Andrews, said, [...] "we were <b>all</b> <b>pretty</b> nervous, {{in the sense that we}} all felt we owed a real obligation, not just to Iraqis but the entire Arab world about how this character would be played." [...] In an early draft of [...] "Solitary", Rousseau told Sayid that she and her research team were studying time. When ABC saw this draft, they asked the producers to remove this line, explaining that they did not want the show to venture into science fiction during the first season. The character of Sullivan, to whose medical woes Jack tended, was created to make the rest of the survivors think that Rousseau's team was killed by an illness. The idea for Hurley's golf course came from script coordinator Brent Fletcher; it was based on a miniature golf course he created in the offices for the television show Angel.|$|E

500|$|Tom Breihan of Stereogum {{described}} the song as [...] "a seriously strong performance, all hard snarls over a bleepy late-'90s-style beat" [...] {{and that it}} [...] "finds Kanye getting surprisingly personal, {{at least for a}} couple of lines, about his long-rumored relationship with Kim Kardashian." [...] Rob Markman of MTV stated that [...] "lyrically, Kanye delivers a fiery performance" [...] on the track, and that [...] "it's <b>all</b> <b>pretty</b> intriguing, considering Kanye has shied away from the media for almost two years now." [...] Alex Gale of BET mused that the song features a [...] "brash Kanye West going in furiously over a schizophrenic soundscape from Hit-Boy, the production maestro behind The Throne's 'Niggas in Paris.' Yeezy's bars are buzzworthy to say the least". DJBooth mused [...] "arrogance is busting through the seams on the record, yet it is balanced enough to sound charismatic in a form that Mr. West has perfected."

[...] The following day, Baffert said that American Pharoah was healthy and came out of the race in good shape. He said he had no regrets, stating, [...] "I'm glad I brought him. Racing needed something like this. He almost pulled it off." [...] Regarding Zayat's talk of retiring the horse, Baffert said, [...] "Mr. Zayat is a very emotional man. We were <b>all</b> <b>pretty</b> disappointed... I know (Zayat) will be going back and forth... He's a sportsman for bringing him up here." [...] Five days later, Zayat announced that the horse would be kept in training with the goal to run in the Breeders' Cup Classic, stating, [...] "I believe there were a combination of factors that prevented American Pharoah from running his absolute best... I have every confidence that he can run to his best again, and he deserves the chance to do so." ...|$|E

He concluded for the album, [...] " [...] hits you with recognizable hit after recognizable hit, and they are <b>all</b> <b>pretty</b> much as perfect as contemporary R gets". Describing the album as a [...] "masterclass in what happens when a great band comes together", Yahoo! Music's Hattie Collins wrote, [...] "Despite the low-points, this is a Destiny's Child must have collection of classics from one of R's most significant talents". A more mixed review came from Fiona Mckinlay from the website musicOMH who felt the album included many [...] "skippable" [...] songs and noted that the material from The Writing's on the Wall and Survivor were the collection's best. She {{felt that the}} progress in the sound of the band was evident on #1's, but offered the opinion, [...] "As far as greatest hits albums go, Destiny's Child show themselves to be pretty ace, but still not quite the incredible force in R". San Francisco Chronicle Aidin Vaziri criticized the songs from Destiny Fulfilled and [...] "Stand Up for Love" [...] and concluded [...] "surveying Destiny's Child's entire career on this set... it's obvious their hearts slipped away around the same time Beyonce's solo album sold its first million".|$|E

[...] Swift explained that she decided to name this song as her album title, as its lyrics encompass the entire theme of the project.
