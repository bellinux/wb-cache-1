25|$|Originally, the Church was to {{be known}} as Church of the Resurrection, but was changed to Church of the Risen Christ as the former term was found to be rather {{abstract}} and impersonal. A quotation from the souvenir magazine published in conjunction with the Church’s official opening cites the following rationale: “The name RISEN CHRIST expresses in a better way the unique character of the Easter event. We believe in a Risen Christ. We believe that He is alive <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a relationship with God through Him. Our Church stands as a permanent witness to such a faith”.|$|E

500|$|The Queensland Military Historical Society set up {{a bronze}} plaque at 304 Montague Road, South Brisbane, where Sing had died. In 1995, a statue of Sing was {{unveiled}} with honour in his home town of Clermont. In 2004, an Australian Army sniper team in Baghdad named their post the 'Billy Sing Bar & Grill.' On 19 May 2009, the 66th anniversary of Sing's death, the Chinese Consul-General, Ren Gongping, along with Returned and Services League of Australia officers and community leaders, laid wreaths at his grave. Ren said, [...] "Billy Sing {{is a symbol of}} the long history of Chinese in Australia, and the great role they have played in your nation's past ... It also reminds us that China and Australia were allies through both world wars, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a long and proud shared past." ...|$|E

"We {{suppose that}} the {{circumference}} and diameter of a circle have been measured with a standard measuring rod infinitely small compared with the radius, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> the quotient of the two results. If this experiment were performed with measuring rods at rest relatively to the Galilean system K′, the quotient would be π. With measuring rods at rest relatively to K, the quotient would be greater than π. This is readily understood if we envisage {{the whole process of}} measuring from the [...] "stationary" [...] system K′, and take into consideration that the measuring rods applied to the periphery undergoes a Lorentz contraction, while the ones applied along the radius do not. Hence Euclidean geometry does not apply to K." ...|$|E
2500|$|Until {{the early}} 2010s, Barcelona had {{mounting}} debts, {{built up over}} the past few seasons, a situation that forced the club to push through an emergency bailout loan of €150 million. The Qatar Foundation, run by Sheikha Mozah, becomes the first shirt sponsor in Barcelona’s 111-year history. The club had previously used UNICEF's logo on the front of its shirts. In 2011, incoming Barcelona president Sandro Rosell agreed the deal for a period of five seasons, with the club receiving €30 million each year, starting on 1 July 2011 and running until 30 June 2016, plus bonuses for trophies won that could total €5m. Writing in his El Periodico column, Cruyff slammed the deal, “We are a unique club in the world, no one has kept their jersey intact throughout their history, yet have remained as competitive as they come... We have sold this uniqueness for about six percent of our budget. I understand that we are currently losing more than we are earning. However, by selling the shirt it shows me that we are not being creative, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> become vulgar.” ...|$|E

2500|$|That same day, Jean {{responded with}} a public statement, saying [...] "I wish to tell you {{unequivocally}} that both my husband and I are proud to be Canadian <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> the greatest respect for the institutions of our country. We are fully committed to Canada. I would not have accepted this position otherwise... have never belonged to a political party or the separatist movement," [...] {{and went on to}} say that in the documented footage she had been speaking about Haiti, and not Quebec. Martin added on his earlier comments: [...] "There is no doubt in my mind that her devotion to Canada is longstanding and resolute," [...] though some critics continued to argue that Jean's response had been too vague. By late August, polls showed that there had been a 20% drop in support for the recommendation of Jean as the next governor general, in response to which the Haitian community voiced their support for Jean, even holding special church services in her honour. Jean reaffirmed in late 2010 that the rumours of her separatist sympathies were untrue and revealed that she had been upset by those journalists who she saw as capitalizing on sensationalism, rather than seeking accuracy through investigation, but she had been advised repeatedly not to respond.|$|E
2500|$|Christianity {{discouraged}} {{the burial}} of grave goods so that, {{at least from}} the Anglo-Saxons, we have a larger number of pre-Christian survivals than those from later periods. The majority of examples that survive from the Christian period have been found in archaeological contexts that suggest they were rapidly hidden, lost or abandoned. There are a few exceptions, notably portable shrines ("cumdachs") for books or relics, several of which have been continuously owned, mostly by churches on the Continent—though the Monymusk Reliquary has always been in Scotland. In general it is clear that most survivals are only by chance, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> only fragments of some types of object—in particular the largest and least portable. The highest quality survivals are either secular jewellery, the largest and most elaborate pieces probably for male wearers, or tableware or altarware in what were apparently very similar styles—some pieces cannot be confidently assigned between altar and royal dining-table. [...] It seems possible, even likely, that the finest church pieces were made by secular workshops, often attached to a royal household, though other pieces were made by monastic workshops. The evidence suggests that Irish metalworkers produced most of the best pieces, however the finds from the royal burial at Sutton Hoo, from the far east of England and {{at the beginning of the}} period, are as fine in design and workmanship as any Irish pieces.|$|E
