5|$|Customs differ as to {{who writes}} the kvitel. In some courts, the Rebbe's {{attendant}} writes the kvitel {{on behalf of the}} petitioner; in others, a specific person is paid to write the kvitelach. <b>Alternately,</b> the petitioner himself writes the kvitel.|$|E
5|$|Mary shrunk back, and was <b>alternately</b> {{pale and}} red. A {{delicate}} sense of propriety prevented her from replying; and recalled her bewildered reason.|$|E
5|$|Order Heteronemertea. Comprises about 400 species. The {{majority}} are marine, but three are freshwater. Their body-wall muscles are disposed in four layers, <b>alternately</b> circular and length-wise {{starting from the}} outermost layer. The order includes the strongest swimmers. Two genera have branched proboscises.|$|E
5|$|The {{standing}} waves <b>alternately</b> {{rise and fall}} in a mirror image pattern, as kinetic energy is converted to potential energy, and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|After the Pangaean supercontinent sundered {{during the}} Cretaceous period, the region {{became part of}} a {{shifting}} transition zone between a shallow inland sea—the Western Interior Seaway—and a band of plains and low hills to the west. A sandy and swampy coastline oscillated east and west, <b>alternately</b> submerging and uncovering the area atop the present Colorado Plateau that Chaco Canyon now occupies.|$|E
5|$|Blackman's {{guilty verdict}} {{led to a}} showing of {{public support for the}} Marine, with people {{creating}} social media groups and online petitions <b>alternately</b> asking that he be given a lenient sentence and calling for his release. The Daily Telegraph supported one Change.org petition for leniency.|$|E
5|$|Edmontosaurus was a hadrosaurid (a duck-billed dinosaur), {{a member}} of a family of dinosaurs which to date are known only from the Late Cretaceous. It is {{classified}} within the Saurolophinae (<b>alternately</b> Hadrosaurinae), a clade of hadrosaurids which lacked hollow crests. Other members of the group include Brachylophosaurus, Gryposaurus, Lophorhothon, Maiasaura, Naashoibitosaurus, Prosaurolophus, and Saurolophus. It was either closely related to or includes the species Anatosaurus annectens (<b>alternately</b> Edmontosaurus annectens), a large hadrosaurid from various latest Cretaceous formations of western North America. The giant Chinese hadrosaurine Shantungosaurus giganteus is also anatomically similar to Edmontosaurus; M. K. Brett-Surman found the two to differ only in details related to the greater size of Shantungosaurus, based on what had been described of the latter genus.|$|E
5|$|Flann {{may have}} had the {{intention}} of abandoning the traditional succession to the kingship of Tara, whereby {{the northern and southern}} branches of the Uí Néill held the kingship <b>alternately,</b> but such plans were thwarted when his favoured son Óengus was killed by his son-in-law and eventual successor Niall Glúndub, son of Áed Findliath, on 7 February 915. Flann's other sons raised revolts and his authority collapsed.|$|E
5|$|From there, the pharynx passes {{food to the}} esophagus, {{which could}} be just a simple tube passing {{it on to the}} crop and proventriculus, and then onward to the midgut, as in most insects. <b>Alternately,</b> the foregut may expand into a very {{enlarged}} crop and proventriculus, or the crop could just be a diverticulum, or fluid-filled structure, as in some Diptera species.|$|E
5|$|In Manitoba, {{an urban}} {{municipality}} may be named a town upon formation. Other than the requirements to incorporate as an urban municipality (1,000 residents and 400 people/km2), the Municipal Act has no minimum population threshold {{to limit the}} naming of them as towns. A town can <b>alternately</b> be named a village or urban municipality under the Municipal Act or a city {{if it has a}} minimum population of 7,500.|$|E
5|$|Initially, shuttle train {{services}} on the branch operated from the through platform at Holborn. At peak times, an additional train operated <b>alternately</b> in the branch's western tunnel {{from the bay}} platform at Holborn. During {{the first year of}} operation, a train for theatregoers operated late on Monday to Saturday evenings from Strand through Holborn and northbound to Finsbury Park; this was discontinued in October 1908.|$|E
5|$|Most bovids <b>alternately</b> {{feed and}} ruminate {{throughout}} the day. While those that feed on concentrates feed and digest in short intervals, the roughage feeders take longer intervals. Only small {{species such as}} the duiker browse {{for a few hours}} during day or night. Feeding habits are related to body size; while small bovids forage in dense and closed habitat, larger species feed upon high-fiber vegetation in open grasslands.|$|E
5|$|Opinions on the sex {{industry}} are diverse. Feminists critical of the {{sex industry}} generally {{see it as the}} exploitative result of patriarchal social structures which reinforce sexual and cultural attitudes complicit in rape and sexual harassment. <b>Alternately,</b> feminists who support at least part of {{the sex industry}} argue that it can be a medium of feminist expression and a means for women to take control of their sexuality.|$|E
5|$|Petiolaris complex: A {{group of}} {{tropical}} Australian species, {{they live in}} constantly warm but sometimes wet conditions. Several of the 14 species that comprise this group have developed special strategies {{to cope with the}} <b>alternately</b> drier conditions. Many species, for example, have petioles densely covered in trichomes, which maintain a sufficiently humid environment and serve as an increased condensation surface for morning dew. The Petiolaris complex comprises the subgenus Lasiocephala.|$|E
5|$|The collar {{was made}} of gold, {{consisting}} of Tudor roses and harps attached with knots. The two roses which comprise the Tudor rose were <b>alternately</b> enamelled white within red, and red within white. The central harp, from which the badge of the Order was suspended, was surmounted by a crown.|$|E
5|$|The {{temperature}} of the asteroid belt varies with {{the distance from the}} Sun. For dust particles within the belt, typical temperatures range from 200K (−73°C) at 2.2AU down to 165K (−108°C) at 3.2AU However, due to rotation, the surface {{temperature of}} an asteroid can vary considerably as the sides are <b>alternately</b> exposed to solar radiation and then to the stellar background.|$|E
5|$|When perched {{or between}} bouts of {{foraging}} on the ground, the flame robin holds {{itself in a}} relatively upright pose, with its body angled at 45° or less from the vertical, and its wings held low below its tail. It impresses as nervous and twitchy, flicking its wings <b>alternately</b> when still. The flame robin's flight is fast, with a markedly undulating character.|$|E
5|$|A {{rapid transit}} route to connect Staten Island (<b>alternately</b> known as Richmond County) to the {{remainder}} of New York City was proposed in 1912, {{in conjunction with the}} Dual Contracts of the New York City Subway. At the time, there were no vehicular or rail connections between Staten Island and the other four boroughs; the only connection was by ferry. Although not funded by the city, the tunnel was expected to help expand the then-sparsely populated borough in a similar manner to the population and development explosions seen in Brooklyn and the Bronx.|$|E
5|$|A villanelle (also {{known as}} villanesque) is a nineteen-line poetic form {{consisting}} of five tercets {{followed by a}} quatrain. There are two refrains and two repeating rhymes, with {{the first and third}} line of the first tercet repeated <b>alternately</b> until the last stanza, which includes both repeated lines. The villanelle {{is an example of a}} fixed verse form. The word derives from Latin, then Italian, and is related to the initial subject of the form being the pastoral.|$|E
5|$|Claiborne {{was born}} the county of Kent in England in 1600 to Thomas Clayborn, an {{alderman}} and lord mayor from King's Lynn, Norfolk, who made his living as a small-scale businessman involved {{in a variety of}} industries, including the salt and fish trades, and Sarah Smith, the daughter of a London brewer. The family name was spelled <b>alternately</b> as Cleburn, Cleyborne, or Claiborne. William Claiborne, who was baptized in 1600, was the younger of two sons. The family's business was not profitable enough to make it rich, and so Claiborne's older brother was apprenticed in London, becoming a merchant involved in hosiery and, eventually, the tobacco trade.|$|E
5|$|During the Permian, Triassic and Jurassic (300 to 150 Mya), further {{episodes of}} desertification, {{subsidence}} and uplift occurred and Wales was <b>alternately</b> inundated {{by the sea}} and raised above it. By the Cretaceous (140 to 70 Mya), Wales was permanently above sea level and in the Pleistocene (2.5 Mya to recent), it underwent several exceptionally cold periods, the ice ages. The mountains we see today largely assumed their present shape during the last ice age, the Devensian glaciation.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} glacial period, ending 12,000 years ago, the sea mink's range may have {{extended}} {{south of the}} Gulf of Maine. It may have even evolved there, as Maine at that time would have been covered in glaciers, although the oldest known specimen only dates back to around 5,000 years; this {{could be due to}} the rising sea levels—older sea mink remains may be submerged underwater. <b>Alternately,</b> the sea mink may have evolved after the last glacial period and filled a new ecological niche.|$|E
5|$|Emergency lights may be {{housed in}} special fittings, {{such as in}} a lightbar, or may be hidden in a host light (such as a headlamp) by {{drilling}} {{a hole in the}} host light's reflector and inserting the emergency light. These hidden lights may not be apparent until they are activated. Additionally, some of the standard lights fitted to an ambulance (e.g. headlamps, tail lamps) may be programmed to flash. Flashing headlights (typically the high beams, flashed <b>alternately)</b> are known as a wig-wag.|$|E
5|$|Following the battle, Santa Anna was <b>alternately</b> {{viewed as}} a {{national}} hero or a pariah. Mexican perceptions of the battle often mirrored the prevailing viewpoint. Santa Anna had been disgraced following his capture at the Battle of San Jacinto, and many Mexican accounts of the battle were written by men who had been, or had become, his outspoken critics. Petite and many other historians believe {{that some of the}} stories, such as the execution of Crockett, may have been invented to further discredit Santa Anna. In Mexican history, the Texas campaign, including the Battle of the Alamo, was soon overshadowed by the Mexican–American War of 1846–48.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{analysis}} of pigeye sharks across northern Australia {{suggest that the}} evolutionary history of this species was affected by coastline changes during the Pleistocene epoch (2.6 million to 12,000 years ago). The patterns of diversity found in its mitochondrial DNA {{are consistent with the}} repeated splitting and merging of its populations as geographical barriers were <b>alternately</b> formed and inundated. The most recent of these barriers was a land bridge across the Torres Strait that reopened only some 6,000 years ago; as a result, significant genetic separation exists between the sharks found off Western Australia and the Northern Territory and those found off Queensland.|$|E
5|$|I {{then got}} some Coal {{from one of}} the Pits nearest thereunto, which I {{distilled}} in a Retort in an open Fire. At first there came over only Phlegm, afterwards a black Oil, and then likewise a Spirit arose, which I could noways condense, but it forced my Lute, or broke my Glasses. Once, when it had forced the Lute, coming close thereto, {{in order to try to}} repair it, I observed that the Spirit which issued out caught Fire at the Flame of the Candle, and continued burning with Violence as it issued out, in a Stream, which 1 blew out, and lighted again, <b>alternately,</b> for several times.|$|E
5|$|In 1907 the weekday {{off-peak}} service was four trains per hour from East Ham to Ealing Broadway, four per hour from Mansion House to <b>alternately</b> Richmond and Wimbledon and two per hour from Wimbledon to High Street Kensington and Ealing Broadway to Whitechapel. Four trains per hour ran from Putney Bridge to Earl's Court, two continuing to High Street Kensington. From South Harrow {{there were two}} trains per hour to Mill Hill Park, and four trains per hour from Hounslow Barracks to Mill Hill Park, two of these continuing to South Acton.|$|E
5|$|In late 1910, she {{sailed to}} Europe {{as part of}} Atlantic Fleet maneuvers, {{following}} which she spent about 14 months off the Atlantic coast, based <b>alternately</b> in Philadelphia and Norfolk, serving as a training ship and conducting operational exercises. In June 1912, she landed a Marine detachment at El Cuero, Cuba, to protect American interests. Following exercises with the fleet, she returned to Philadelphia Navy Yard, where she was put in the First Reserve in August 1912.|$|E
5|$|In {{northern}} and western Africa, the desiccation and humectation {{of the modern}} Sahara desert has led to very fruitful archaeological sites, followed by completely barren soil, only to once again show evidence of population when the aridity of the region was ameliorated. Preservation in these two regions are <b>alternately</b> superb and lamentable, yet the sites that have been uncovered document the adaptive nature of early hominins to climatically unstable environments. Researchers such as Marean and Assefa consider the historic distinction between northern Africa {{and the rest of}} Africa, as though they represent divergent cultural developments, an arbitrary and antiquated distinction.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} when the Qedarites {{ceased to exist}} as a {{separately}} defined confederation or people. Allies with the Nabataeans, {{it is likely that}} they were absorbed into the Nabataean state around the 2nd century CE. In Islam, Isma'il is considered to be the ancestral forefather of the Arab people, and in traditional Islamic historiography, Muslim historians have assigned great importance in their accounts to his first two sons (Nebaioth and Qedar), with the genealogy of Muhammad, the Messenger of God in Islam, <b>alternately</b> assigned to one or the other son, depending on the scholar.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} the first half of the twentieth century that the first women's fraternities were established. The {{university}} first admitted women to graduate programs in 1920, although undergraduate women were not allowed at the university until much later. With these graduate women came several female Greek organizations, referred to <b>alternately</b> as sororities or women's fraternities. The first sorority to establish a chapter at the university was Chi Omega, whose chapter was founded in 1927. A Kappa Delta chapter followed in 1932, and a chapter of Zeta Tau Alpha was established twenty years later in 1952.|$|E
5|$|Morales {{has been}} praised for {{significantly}} reducing poverty and illiteracy in Bolivia {{and has been}} internationally decorated with various awards. His supporters have lauded him {{as a champion of}} indigenous rights, anti-imperialism, and environmentalism. <b>Alternately,</b> a number of leftist, indigenous, and environmentalist critics have accused him of failing to live up to many of his espoused values, while right-wing opponents have accused him of being excessively radical and authoritarian and claimed that his defence of coca contributes to illegal cocaine production.|$|E
5|$|Seasons 1 and 2 (2011–12) {{follow the}} events of A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings, respectively. The plot of A Storm of Swords was split into seasons 3 and 4 (2013–14). Both season 5 and season 6 adapt {{material}} from A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons, novels whose plots run concurrently and each contain different characters. Though the HBO series has <b>alternately</b> extended, abbreviated, conflated and diverged from the novels' plot lines, Tyrion's character and story arc have remained mostly consistent with Martin's writing.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after waking, red pandas clean their fur {{somewhat}} {{like a cat}} would, licking their front paws and then rubbing their backs, torsos, and sides. They also rub their backs and bellies {{along the sides of}} trees or rocks. Then they patrol their territories, marking with urine and a weak musk-smelling secretion from their anal glands. They search for food running along the ground or through the trees. Red pandas may use their forepaws <b>alternately</b> to bring food to their mouths or place food directly into their mouths.|$|E
