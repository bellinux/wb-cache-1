The choice parameters of interest include the product price, the quality of <b>after-sales</b> <b>service</b> and the price to be charged for the <b>after-sales</b> <b>service.</b> We adopt a competitive, game-theoretic (as opposed to single-firm optimization) framework, where there is competition {{for the provision of}} <b>after-sales</b> <b>service</b> between the manufacturer and an independent service operator. The product price and the service quality/price are characterized by an equilibrium to a sequential game.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to analyze whether or not prices of laptop {{computers}} reflect their varying degrees of non-hardware characteristics such as the number of <b>after-sale</b> <b>service</b> center and the inclusion of OS software. For this purpose, we have employed Hedonic Price Model by which the interactions among hardware and non-hardware components could be analyzed. As a result, we have found that the number of after-sales service center and the inclusion of OS have a tendency to increase the prices of the laptop computers. This result is consistent with the following hypothesis: the more the number of after-sales service center is, the higher consumers are willing to pay for the laptop computers, when all other things being equal or held constant. The same conclusion can be applied to the case of the inclusion of OS; consumers are willing to pay more with the inclusion of OS.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is initiated from {{an increased}} awareness within industry {{of the importance}} of services in general and of <b>after-sales</b> <b>services</b> in particular. The scope of this research is to analyse how the specific characteristics of <b>after-sales</b> <b>services</b> affect a company’s manufacturing strategy, which in effect should become an operations strategy not only considering the manufacturing of goods. Considering the <b>after-sales</b> <b>service</b> as a product, consisting of both good and service characteristics, the objective of this dissertation is to develop conceptual models for an improved long-term management of operations where production of both new goods and <b>after-sales</b> <b>services</b> are competing for the same or similar resources. Specifically, the structural decision categories of a manufacturing strategy, process technology, capacity, facilities, and vertical integration, are adapted to include the demands of <b>after-sales</b> <b>service</b> products. The research result is an extension of the existing manufacturing strategy framework, which is transformed towards a more general operations strategy framework capable of providing managerial guidance for a larger set of products than just pure goods. Tools are developed for analysing what processes would be suitable for the <b>after-sales</b> <b>services,</b> and whether the after-sales processes should be merged with, or separated from, the new goods process. An extended long term service capacity framework is also introduced, looking specifically at the needs of <b>after-sales</b> <b>service</b> operations.

40|$|Due {{to growing}} {{complexities}} in business-to-business products, {{the relationship between}} a seller and a buyer usually never ends after the purchase transaction. Customers buy augmented products, expecting bundle of values that come with the product which will satisfy the buyer. Thus, integrating services into the core offerings in manufacturing industries has taken crucial importance. Especially, <b>after-sales</b> <b>service</b> is considered a tool for enhancing a valuable advantage for the customer as well as it is a business opportunity for the company. <b>After-sales</b> <b>services</b> have proven to be of importance, and a strategic after-sales framework is necessary. Three major activities that play a crucial role within the <b>after-sales</b> <b>services</b> in the manufacturing industry are field technical assistance, spare parts distribution and customer care. However, intensive studies regarding after-sales in a specific industry are lacking. This thesis focuses on the Swedish heavy equipment machinery industry organizations of different sizes and thus, {{the purpose of this study}} is to investigate the major activities of <b>after-sales</b> <b>service</b> focusing on customer relationship among three classified sizes of <b>after-sales</b> <b>service</b> providers. A multiple case study has been carried out in the form of semi-structured interviews with three organizations; one small, one medium and one large size <b>after-sales</b> <b>service</b> providers. The study reveals that customer care is the most focused activity of <b>after-sales</b> <b>services</b> in the heavy equipment machinery industry in Sweden. Simultaneously, it shows the most significant differences of offers depending on the size of the company, in relation to the remaining activities.   Field technical assistance appears to be the part of after-sales that produces least profit in the industry. Thus, it might be the reason that small organizations would rather tend to outsource it, in order to avoid high costs.   Spare parts distribution can be considered as the most profitable activity of after-sales. The warehouses and repair centers of companies naturally varied according to firm sizes. Although the organizations do not state formal goals for providing <b>after-sales</b> <b>service</b> to its customers, they are aware of its importance and aim for satisfying customer demands. All organizations are convinced that if <b>after-sales</b> <b>services</b> are not handled properly, they face the risk of losing the customer. Finally, this research indicates that organizations in the heavy equipment machinery industry have a lot of room for improvements to its after-sales activities with respect to their relationship with customers, which can be accomplished in strategic and systematic ways.     Keywords: <b>After-sales</b> <b>service,</b> Field technical assistance, Spare parts distribution, Customer care, Customer relationship marketing, Firm siz...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore how service {{managers}} and their customers perceive the <b>after-sale</b> <b>service</b> quality provided by automobile service centers in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), with a goal to identify the existence of gaps, if any, between their perceptions and how they can impact customer satisfaction level. A qualitative phenomenological method was implemented to gather a description of the participants’ actual experiences, and data were collected using semi-structured interviews with seven service mangers and 20 customers. The structure of the managers’ interview questions was designed to go beyond identifying the most important factors that customers insist on having and focus on the methods that managers use to gather customer data, the obstacles that prevent meeting customers’ needs, frequent customer complaints, and the effectiveness of aligning managers’ and customers’ perceptions to increase customer satisfaction. The questions used to interview customers were also designed to collect in-depth feedback regarding how they evaluate service managers’ understanding of their needs and how that can have a crucial impact on their future transactions. Existing literature on the same topic did not fully address the issues of having different perceptions between service managers and customers. The findings of this study endorse the need for service managers to discover the hidden and underestimated customer requirements that prevent them from having aligned perceptions between both parties. This study makes an important contribution to the literature by expanding and enriching the existing knowledge of the <b>after-sale</b> <b>service</b> quality in the UAE automobile industry...|$|E

40|$|<b>After-sales</b> <b>services</b> {{are a key}} {{strategic}} tool in the durable consumer product market. They allow a manufacturer and a retailer to capture more sales and profit. Less obvious, however, is how {{the uncertainty of the}} customer 2 ̆ 7 s needs for <b>after-sales</b> <b>services</b> influences <b>after-sales</b> <b>service</b> decisions. As an extension of Kurata and Nam 2 ̆ 7 s 2010 (International Journal of Production Economics 127 (1), 136 – 146) work, in this paper we explore the effect of uncertainty on <b>after-sales</b> <b>service</b> decisions by comparing several information structures in a two-stage supply chain.

However, ultimately, uncertainty will never improve supply chain performance. We determine probabilities that such accidental outperformance may mislead the firm into making erroneous <b>after-sales</b> <b>service</b> decisions due to misunderstandings regarding uncertainty. In addition, our analysis shows that a firm 2 ̆ 7 s effort to provide efficient service operations will increase the chance of accidental outperformance.
