500|$|Throughout late November {{and early}} December 2016, PewDiePie jokingly {{expressed}} his desires to delete his YouTube channel at 50 million subscribers. On 2 December, he uploaded a video {{in which he}} discussed his frustration {{with the issue of}} YouTube accounts experiencing an unexplained loss of subscribers and views. PewDiePie expressed, [...] "I find {{that a lot of people}} that work with YouTube, almost <b>anyone,</b> <b>have</b> no idea what it's like to work as a content creator, as someone who's built this for years and really cared about it." [...] On this issue, a Google representative provided a comment to Ars Technica, detailing, [...] "Some creators have expressed concerns around a drop in their subscriber numbers. We've done an extensive review and found there have been no decreases in creators subscriber numbers beyond what normally happens when viewers either unsubscribe from a creator's channel or when YouTube removes spammed subscribers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Graeme Thomson of Uncut {{was not so}} impressed, {{giving the}} album 2 stars out of 5 and stating [...] "You can't fault the raw material, but Collins brings nothing new to these songs. If you have an overpowering desire to hear him gamely plough through {{renditions}} of [...] "Papa Was a Rollin' Stone" [...] and [...] "Uptight", step aboard. For anyone else, Going Back is a heartfelt but pointless exercise in ersatz soul." [...] Terry Staunton of Record Collector was even more negative, defining the album as a set [...] "of 60s soul covers of baffling irrelevance" [...] and wondering, [...] "what possible use could <b>anyone</b> <b>have</b> for weedy-voiced faded Xeroxes of songs readily available in their wondrously uplifting original form?" ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the early}} 19th century, townspeople grazed cattle on the Green, {{although}} it was owned by the College. [...] To protest the townspeople's failure to remove their cattle at night, students regularly would herd the animals into the basement of Dartmouth Hall and hold them hostage. Not until 1836, when the school and some individual citizens funded a fence, did <b>anyone</b> <b>have</b> a sure means of keeping cattle off the Green. [...] The removal of the fence in 1893 prompted students to request that a portion of it be left as a [...] "Senior Fence." [...] Underclassmen were prohibited from sitting on it, with consequences that might include being dumped in a water trough or otherwise humiliated. Over Green Key Weekend, the seniors would pass on their rights to the Fence to the junior class. In 2003 the fence was relocated from two parallel sections of fence {{on the east side}} of the Green to its current location at the southwest corner. [...] The administration decided to use the fence in this way in order to prevent students from cutting across the corner of the Green and wearing away the grass. [...] Although the humiliation of undergraduates is no longer enforced, the fence is still held in some regard by the senior class.|$|E

Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him, there might be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine. And yet, what could have happened? And why could he not write? Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and I can't sleep a wink at night."

But yet she thought that it perhaps was bold, {{and that he would}} be angry. But he came up to her, and placing himself between her and Kate, whispered into her ear, [...] "Bravely done, my girl. After a little I will try to be as brave, but I could never do it as well." [...] Larry in the meantime had moved his mare away, and before the Master had arrived, was walking slowly up his own road to Chowton Farm.|$|E

He then went on: [...] "You see, Rupert, we hoped, your mother and I, at first that we should find out as you grew up, by the likeness one of you might develop to your mother or myself, which was our child; but for some years now, my boy, I have feared rather than hoped to discover a likeness, and have been glad that neither of you took after either of us, as far as we could see. We loved you equally, and could not bear the thought of losing either of you. We had two sons instead of one, that was all; and had one been proved to be ours, we should have lost the other. We intended to tell you in a short time how the matter stood, and that while one was our adopted son and the other our own, we neither knew nor cared which was which, loving you both equally and regarding you both as our own. Indeed we should never have told you about it, had it not been that as the story of the confusion at your birth was known to a great many men who were at that time in India, it was almost sure to come to your ears sooner or later. Had we ever dreamt that it would come like this, of course we should have told you long ago. But how can Edgar have learnt it? Still more, how can <b>anyone</b> <b>have</b> been able to tell him--what even we do not know--that he is not our son?" ...|$|E
