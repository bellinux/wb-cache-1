5|$|Coutances {{was born}} in Cornwall, to Reinfrid and Gonilla. His brother was Roger fitzReinfrid, a layman and royal justice {{during the reign of}} King Henry II of England. Although the medieval chronicler and churchman Gerald of Wales related that his friend was descended from Trojan heroes who escaped the Sack of Troy <b>and</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Cornwall, that was a {{flattering}} invention on Gerald's part. Coutances' family was of the knightly class, and probably from Normandy originally.|$|E
5|$|In North America, King Kong grossed $9,755,745 {{during its}} Wednesday opening and $50,130,145 over its first weekend for a five-day total of $66.1 million. Some analysts {{considered}} these initial numbers disappointing, saying that studio executives {{had been expecting}} more. The film went on to gross $218,080,025 in the domestic market <b>and</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the top five highest-grossing films of the year there. The film grossed an additional $332,437,332 in the international box office for a worldwide total of $550,517,357, which not only ranked it {{in the top five}} highest-grossing films of 2005 worldwide, but also helped the film bring back more than {{two and a half times}} its production budget.|$|E
5|$|Livingstone's {{relationship}} with Kate Allen ended in November 2001, although they remained friends. He then started a {{relationship with}} Emma Beal, together having two children, Thomas (born December 2002) and Mia (born March 2004). At a May 2002 party in Tufnell Park, Livingstone got into an argument with Beal's friend Robin Hedges, {{a reporter for the}} Evening Standard. Hedges subsequently fell off of a wall, bruised his ribs <b>and</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> hospital; the press claimed that Livingstone had pushed him, although he insisted that he did not. Liberal Democrats on the London Assembly referred the matter to the Standards Board for England, who ruled that there was no evidence for any wrongdoing on Livingstone's behalf.|$|E

5|$|He won the 100m at the Commonwealth Games {{trials in}} a season's best of 10.03s, then equalled Linford Christie's record of 10.04s at European Cup, where {{he led the}} British team to victory as team captain. Victories over Maurice Greene {{followed}} at Oslo's IAAF Golden League meeting and in Sheffield with a wind-assisted 9.95s. He was the favourite for the 2002 Commonwealth Games, but Chambers faced stiff competition from British newcomer Mark Lewis-Francis who was finishing fractions of a second behind him. Chambers won all his preliminary races and reached the final, along with Lewis-Francis and Jason Gardener, but he suffered a cramp mid-race <b>and</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> last place. He later revealed that he had feigned injury as the brief hamstring cramp was caused by drug abuse. The English sprinters had the three slowest times in the final, with Lewis-Francis also beset by injury.|$|E
5|$|In 1942 he was {{involved}} {{in the formation of the}} 13th Ustaše Assault Company and by 1943 had attained a seat in the Croatian Parliament. Between 1942 and 1943 he {{was involved}} in recruiting students to join Ante Pavelić's personal bodyguard and was promoted to the rank of major. He held the position of head of the Ustaše University Headquarters and Ustaše Youth until January 1945, when he was appointed Commissioner for Physical Education and Sport. Blažeković fled Zagreb from the advancing Yugoslav Partisans in May 1945 <b>and</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a refugee camp in Salzburg, Austria. In August, he was arrested by American forces who extradited him to Yugoslavia on 12 February 1946. He was tried in Zagreb on 12 January 1947, sentenced to death, and executed the same day.|$|E
5|$|Kim himself {{considered}} his treatise a failure. Films it {{had contributed to}} were enjoyed at home, but abroad they were ridiculed. North Korean cinema could not compete {{with the quality of}} foreign, and in particular South Korean, films. This directly prompted him to kidnap Shin Sang-ok, South Korea's most famous film director, in 1978. Shin and his wife, actress Choi Eun-hee, were kept in North Korea for eight years under cruel conditions. Nevertheless, Shin studied On the Art of the Cinema to please Kim with the kaijū film Pulgasari, which credits Kim as the executive producer. Kim was delighted with the film and allowed Shin and Choi to travel to Vienna, where they were supposed to negotiate a deal for a sequel. The couple used the opportunity to escape, <b>and</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> America.|$|E

5|$|On 20 August 1948, the Jewish National Fund {{called for}} {{building}} a settlement on some of al-Birwa's lands, and on 6 January 1949, Yas'ur, a kibbutz, was established there. In 1950, the moshav of Ahihud was inaugurated on the village's western lands. According to Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi, one of al-Birwa's schools, two shrines for local sages, and three houses remained standing as of 1982. One of the shrines was domed and built of stone. Most of the structures stood amid cacti, weeds, olive and fig groves, and mulberry trees. Most of al-Birwa's inhabitants fled to nearby Arab towns and villages, including Tamra, Kabul, Jadeidi-Makr, Kafr Yasif, and other localities. Some fled to Lebanon, <b>and</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the Shatila refugee camp, in the outskirts of Beirut, where Palestinian historian Nafez Nazzal interviewed them in 1973. Among the refugees of al-Birwa was Mahmoud Darwish, {{who was born in}} the village in 1941 and lived part of his childhood there.|$|E
5|$|On June 7, 2012, Aron Winter {{resigned}} from the club upon refusing to be reassigned from his head coaching role after the team started {{the season with a}} nine-game losing streak, setting an MLS record for worst start to a season. Under Winter in 2012, the club's league record was 1–9–0 and in all other competitions was 3–1–4, including a fourth-straight Canadian Championship. He was replaced by Paul Mariner, but TFC continued to struggle finishing with a 4–12–8 record in league play under him. Toronto FC also failed to advance in the CONCACAF Champions League, finishing second in its group with a 2–2–0 record. Overall, they finished the MLS season on a 14-game winless streak <b>and</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> last place, with five wins and 23 points (both franchise lows).|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of May 30, the 54th Battalion's 1st Company {{attacked}} the area around Isdud's railway station, but was outgunned and had to retreat with four wounded. According to the company's report, the food {{that was given to}} them was rotten and further deteriorated the soldiers' ability to fight. On May 31, the Egyptian radio described the attack as a victory, and claimed hundreds of dead Israelis. The 3rd Company was unsuccessful, as intelligence on precise Egyptian positions was sparse, while the company gave its position away quickly. An Egyptian mortar scored a direct hit on one of the company's squads, which caused casualties and panic. One of the soldiers ran for cover, but lost direction, <b>and</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Isdud. He walked around the village unnoticed and found a chance to return to Givati, and provided the command with invaluable information for the operation.|$|E

5|$|The early {{breakaway}} included four riders. These were Thomas Voeckler (Direct Énergie), Matthew Brammeier (Dimension Data), Florian Vachon (Fortuneo–Vital Concept) and Evaldas Siskevicius (Delko–Marseille Provence KTM). They {{were not}} allowed to build a large advantage, with the peloton keeping them just a few minutes ahead. The main action of the day came on the second-category final climb. In the breakaway, now just a minute ahead, Voeckler attacked and dropped the other breakaway riders. Nathan Haas (Dimension Data) attacked the peloton {{at the top of the}} climb, but made a mistake on a corner <b>and</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a field. On the climb, Marcel Kittel and Arnaud Démare were dropped, with Démare then pulling out of the race. Geraint Thomas was one of several riders to crash on the climb, but he was able to return to the peloton.|$|E
5|$|Wilfrid went to Rome {{after his}} {{expulsion}} to appeal against Theodore and Ecgfrith's decisions, the first Englishman to challenge a royal or ecclesiastical decision by petitioning the papacy. On {{the way he}} stopped at the court of Aldgisl, the Frisian king in Utrecht for most of 678. Wilfrid had been blown off course on his trip from England to the continent, <b>and</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Frisia according to some historians. Others state that he intended to journey via Frisia to avoid Neustria, whose Mayor of the Palace, Ebroin, disliked Wilfrid. He wintered in Frisia, avoiding the diplomatic efforts of Ebroin, who according to Stephen attempted to have Wilfrid killed. During his stay, Wilfrid attempted to convert the Frisians, who were still pagan at that time. Wilfrid's biographer says that most of the nobles converted, but the success was short-lived. After Frisia, {{he stopped at the}} court of Dagobert II in Austrasia, where the king offered Wilfrid the Bishopric of Strasbourg, which Wilfrid refused. Once in Italy, Wilfrid was received by Perctarit, a Lombard king, who gave him a place at his court.|$|E
