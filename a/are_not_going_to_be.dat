500|$|Arguably the {{highlight}} of the year was the defeat of the Centre Praying Colonels by a score of 24 to 0. It was Centre's first loss to a southern team since 1916.

500|$|With polls {{released}} on October 6 showing Roosevelt well ahead, Willkie began to sound an isolationist theme, accusing Roosevelt {{of being a}} warmonger. Many of Willkie's speeches to that point had been on domestic issues, {{but he had been}} advised by Martin, Hamilton, and other advisors that the war was the issue the voters really cared about. Willkie began to argue that Roosevelt would not keep the U.S. out of war, but that he would. He was given room to make this argument by the United Kingdom's increasing success in the Battle of Britain, as it was clear a German invasion was not imminent. The polls showed voters responding positively to this new tack, and Willkie kept on this course {{for the remainder of the}} campaign. Roosevelt reacted by scheduling five speeches for the final days, in which he proposed to rebut Willkie's [...] "falsifications". The president stated, [...] "I have said again and again and again that your boys <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sent into any foreign wars." [...] Willkie was prone to ad lib remarks, which sometimes led to gaffes: addressing steelworkers, he pledged to appoint a new Secretary of Labor, [...] "and it will not be a woman either". This allusion to Secretary Frances Perkins, the only woman to hold a cabinet position in American history to that point, did not aid him among female voters.|$|E

On March 29, 1994, Malone made a career-high 23 rebounds, but the Jazz lost to the Golden State Warriors 116–113.
