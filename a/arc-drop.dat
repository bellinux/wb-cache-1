40|$|A {{rationale}} for increased Federal support of thermionic research is considered and the objectives and milestones of the thermionic {{program of the}} U. S. Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) are examined. The ERDA program is to provide very high specific power systems needed for planned future NASA nuclear electric propulsion missions. Another objective is the enhancement of the overall thermal conversion efficiency of the present utility power plants from approximately 35 % to 50 % or more. Attention is given to key problem areas, taking into account inadequate analytical tools, {{the reduction of the}} plasma <b>arc-drop</b> losses, aspects of hot shell materials development, and the coordination of the participating groups programmatic activities...|$|E
40|$|The NASA applied {{research}} and technology (ART) program for thermionic energy conversion (TEC) is progressing effectively. Current out-of-core emphases allow converter material and design freedoms previously prohibited by in-core nucleonic and geometric restrictions. As a result, potential improvements indicate possibilities for severalfold increases in efficiencies. The new TEC-ART program concentrated initially on low-work-function collectors and interelectrode-loss reduction and revealed {{much in a}} short time. For example, <b>arc-drop</b> studies verified the necessity of stable emitters that operate well {{with little or no}} adsorbed cesium. This new emission capability coupled with improved collectors that maintain performance with emitter-vapor deposit accumulations are requisites for efficient, enduring thermionic converters. The accomplishments and contributors in these areas are discussed...|$|E
