40|$|This thesis {{examines}} whether scramble {{competition is}} associated with social learning. The question is explored via a comparative study involving two species of grassfinches, <b>Amadina</b> <b>fasciata,</b> and Taenopygia guttata. These finches vary in {{the degree to which}} they employ scramble competition while foraging, but are otherwise similar behaviourally and morphologically. General problems associated with the application of the comparative method to the testing of learning specializations are discussed. Functional improvements to previously employed approaches are proposed, and then implemented in a novel methodology and statistical approach to analysing the data, the Manova approach. The results of the study suggest that there is no link between scramble competition and social learning in these two species. When the effects of confounding variables are removed from the interspecific comparison, the species do not appear to differ in their social learning abilities. The results also indirectly suggest that some forms of social learning occur through the mechanisms of general learning...|$|E
40|$|A microspectrophotometric {{study was}} {{conducted}} on the retinal photoreceptors of four species of bird: cut-throat finches (<b>Amadina</b> <b>fasciata),</b> gouldian finches (Erythrura gouldiae), white-headed munias (Lonchura maja) and plum-headed finches (Neochmia modesta). Spectral characteristics of the photoreceptors in all four species were very similar. Rods contained a medium-wavelength-sensitive visual pigment with a wavelength of maximum absorbance at 502 - 504 nm. Four spectrally distinct types of single cone contained a visual pigment with wavelength of maximum absorbance at either 370 - 373 nm (ultraviolet-sensitive), 440 - 447 nm (short-wavelength-sensitive); 500 nm (medium-wavelength-sensitive) or 562 - 565 nm (long-wavelength-sensitive). Oil droplets in the ultraviolet-sensitive single cones showed no detectable absorption between 330 nm and 800 nm. Oil droplets in the short-, medium-, and long-wavelength-sensitive single cones had cut-off wavelengths at 415 - 423 nm, 510 - 520 nm and 567 - 575 nm, respectively. Double cones contained the visual pigment with wavelength of maximum absorbance at 562 - 565 nm observed in long-wavelength-sensitive single cones. Only the principal member of the double cone pair contained an oil droplet (P-type, cut-off wavelength at 414 - 489 nm depending on species and retinal location). Spectral transmittance of the intact ocular media of each species was measured along the optic axis. Wavelengths of 0. 5 transmittance for all species were very similar (316 - 318 nm) ...|$|E
40|$|As {{an attempt}} to keep abreast {{of the variety of}} avian Plasmodium {{parasite}} in Kano State, a total of 218 blood films were made from wild (116) and domesticated (102) bird species collected between January and July, 2009 period. The slides were examined for the presence of Plasmodium parasite (parasitaemia value). Birds examined were six Columbidae livia (pigeons), two Cisticola cantans (Singing cisticola), two Crinifer piscato (Western grey plantain eaters), two Lamprotornis superbus (Buffalo weavers), five Stigmatopelia senegalensis (Laughing doves), twenty-six Ploceus cucullatus (Black-headed weavers), forty-three <b>Amadina</b> <b>fasciata</b> (Cut-throat finches), five Lamprotoni caudatus (Long-tailed glossy starlings), twenty-four Uraeginthus bengalus (Cordon bleu finches), fifty poultry chickens, forty-six local chickens (Gallus gallus), three Nigrita Spp (Negro finches) and four Streptopchia decipiens (African mourning doves). Results of the investigation showed that Plasmodium circumflexicum, Haemoproteus columbae and Plasmodium gallinaecium were present. The frequencies of occurrence in the birds â€™ species were: 19. 56 % for local chickens, 50 % for pigeons, 13. 95 % for Cut-throat finches, 50 % for Grey plantain eaters, 33. 3 % for Negro finches and 0 % for other birds. Overall, 6. 89 % of all the wild birds screened were infected as against 11. 7 % in domesticated birds. Domesticated birds had higher parasetaemia value (100 to 1000) cells per field than the wild birds (10 to 100) cells per field. However...|$|E
