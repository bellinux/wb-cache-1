5|$|Glatter has praised MacLachlan's {{involvement}} in his role, believing that he fully embraced and explored {{the character of}} Cooper; she noted that he was as devoted to the character's comedic elements as to his dramatic side and that the crew had difficulty completing takes featuring Cooper without laughing at his comic delivery.
