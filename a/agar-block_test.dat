40|$|Investigations {{were carried}} out on the {{efficacy}} of extracts from seven Amazonian woods (Bagassa guianensis, Manilkara huberi, Sextonia rubra, Vouacapoua americana, Andira surinamensis, Handroanthus serratifolius, and Qualea rosea) with varying natural durability to reduce soft-rot degradation in a 6 -wk soil-bed test. Six of the wood extracts had shown efficacy against soft-rot fungi. In particular, the preservation efficacies of B. guianensis, H. serratifolius, and S. rubra extracts were highly significant up to retention levels of 23, 25, and 12 kg m? 3, respectively. Three extracts (A. surinamensis, H. serratifolius, and Q. rosea) were then tested against Gloeophyllum trabeum (brown rot) and Trametes versicolor (white rot), in an <b>agar-block</b> <b>test.</b> H. serratifolius wood extract was very efficient at protecting P. sylvestris samples at 5. 1 kg m? 3 against the brown rot. This extract {{could be used as}} a basis for new wood protectant formulations. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} research {{on the effects of}} fungal decay on the mechanical properties of wood-plastic composites (WPC), results were inconclusive due to the influence of moisture absorption. This study was conducted to clarify the contributions of moisture and wood decay fungi to WPC damage. Changes in flexural strength (MOR), modulus (MOE), and weight of two extruded wood-polyethylene composite (WPC) formulations, yellow-poplar sapwood and redwood heartwood, were compared following 3 months of incubation with wood decay fungi. All materials were evaluated using modified agar-block tests in which the white-rot fungus Trametes versicolor and the brown-rot fungus Gloeophyllum trabeum were employed as test fungi. In addition, soil-block tests were performed with yellow-poplar, one WPC formulation, and T. versicolor as test fungus only. It was determined that stiffness of WPC was affected more severely by moisture absorption than by fungal colonization. Strength of WPC was not affected by decay fungi but significantly (p 0. 0001) reduced by moisture absorption for a formulation containing 70 % wood filler. Calculation of weight loss in WPC was based on the wood fraction only. Modified agar-block and soil-block tests were equally suited for determining weight loss in WPC, but agar-block tests could be completed in a shorter time span. Weight loss of a formulation with 70 % wood filler and incubated with T. versicolor was twice as high as that of redwood in a modified <b>agar-block</b> <b>test</b> (6 % versus 3 %); however, only 1 % weight loss was obtained when the formulation contained 49 % wood filler. These results indicate that WPC can be designed to provide high fungal durability by controlling the material composition of the formulation. Weight loss is a more sensitive indicator of fungal decay than strength and stiffness measurements in WPC as well as in redwood...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The use of boron in wood preservatives has been growing since the 1930 s, primarily in various boric acid/borax mixtures. Boron preservatives have several advantages for application as wood preservatives including a broad spectrum of activity against insects and fungi, low mammalian toxicity, low volatility, and cost effectiveness. In addition, they are colorless, odorless and non-corrosive and nonflammable with favorable effects on wood's fire resistance. Boron treatment of wood provides excellent protection for aidoveground uses. However, boron treatment by itself has not been found to give adequate protection when wood is used in ground contact because of its leaching problem. This research examined the potential for decreasing the leachability of boron preservatives using water repellents. Southern pine (Pinus spp.) test samples were impregnated with several types and at different concentrations of borax/boric acid and PEG (Polyethylene glycol) mixture. Leachability performance of these treating solutions was determined. It was found that wood samples treated with boric acid or borax and then treated with PEG- 400 or PEG- 600 by double treatment method showed a significant increase in their water repellency and resistance to boron leaching. Protection performance of these treating solutions on native wood was also determined by soil-block and <b>agar-block</b> <b>test</b> methods. Weight loss by Lentinus lepideus and Poria monticola fungi and toxic threshold retention point for each treatment solution and biological test method were determined. The type of soil effect on the soil-block test was determined. It was found that it {{does not appear to be}} sufficient to choose soils only on the basis of waterholding capacity, pH, and weight as indicated by the ASTM standards. The results found in this research will serve their purpose as far as they are made use of in the wood preservation industry...|$|E
40|$|Phellinus weirianus (Aphyllophorales: Hymenochaetaceae) {{causes a}} white heartrot of living Juglans {{and is the}} major cause of decay in Arizona black walnut. Infection is caused by germinating basidiospores. Tissue {{isolates}} fruit in culture, but single basidiospore isolates do not. The growth of tissue and single-spore isolates is slow to very slow. Cultural morphology is quite variable even among single-spore isolates derived from a single, culturally produced basidiocarp. Single-spore isolates, presumed to be homokaryotic, are derived from uninucleate spores that germinate and develop hyphae with paired nuclei. Lack of fruiting in homokaryons suggests that P. weirianus is heterothallic. Tissue isolates derived from basidiocarps produced in nature {{are assumed to be}} heterokaryotic. Hyphae of tissue isolates have nuclei that are not paired and are more numerous than those in single-spore isolates. Interaction zones are formed in pairings of heterokaryons, pairings of homokaryons, and pairings of homokaryons with the parent heterokaryon. Homozygous matings do not form an interaction zone. <b>Agar-block</b> decay <b>tests</b> show that single-spore isolates exhibit no appreciable differences in decay capacity from tissue isolates. Phellinus weirianus readily decays woods of associated riparian species (Arizona alder, velvet ash, southwestern chokecherry, netleaf oak, and Arizona sycamore) in standard wood test blocks although it is not known on these hosts in nature...|$|R
