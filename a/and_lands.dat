However, given the connectedness of aquatic and terrestrial habitats, stressors originating in one domain may be important in the other. To explore the importance of integrating both hydrological <b>and</b> <b>land</b> use factors, we tested the relative contribution of hydrological factors <b>and</b> <b>land</b> use context as determinants of the dominant riparian tree species, Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehn. throughout wetlands of the Condamine catchment, southern Queensland, Australia.

Validated models which included both hydrological (distance from weir, wetland–river connectivity and groundwater depth) <b>and</b> <b>land</b> use factors (agricultural <b>land</b> cover <b>and</b> grazing intensity) performed better than those developed using only hydrological factors. The study results highlight the importance of an integrated perspective which considers both hydrological <b>and</b> <b>land</b> use factors {{in order to understand}} occurrence patterns of riparian and floodplain tree species in a range of settings.
