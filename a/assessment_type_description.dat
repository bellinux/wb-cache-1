2500|$|Described from {{a single}} worker fossil in Chartense amber, the species has an {{estimated}} body length of , though shrinking of the ant after entombment made accurate measurements difficult. [...] The head has small indistinct compound eyes and no visible ocelli. [...] The antennae are composed of 12 segments and the <b>type</b> <b>description</b> indicated the scape was notably longer than other Cretaceous genera. [...] However, in reexamination the scape {{was determined to be}} shorter than thought, and distortion of the fossil had caused the error with the <b>type</b> <b>description.</b> [...] The mandibles have the typical shape seen in the genus, overlapping slightly when closed, and with apical and subapical teeth. [...] The clypeus sports approximately 32 denticles, though the <b>type</b> <b>description</b> originally placed the denticles on the labrum. While the <b>type</b> <b>description</b> mentioned the lack of a sting, the 2016 review of the fossil suggested the sting may have been missing prior to entombment. [...] The species name was derived from [...] "Cretaceous", the age of the fossil.|$|R
