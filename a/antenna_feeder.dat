40|$|Abstract—This work {{presents}} an experimental study in W band about {{the behavior of}} a plane Fresnel reflector when the feeder changes its position on the surface of a sphere whose centre is the same of the Fresnel plate zones. For this purpose, an experimental system based on seven Fresnel plate zones and two different levels has been developed. The center frequency of the reflector is 96 GHz, the focal length is 100 mm and height between levels is 0. 78 mm. Based on this Fresnel reflector, an experimental set up has been developed. The horn <b>antenna</b> <b>feeder</b> is fixed and situated in far field and the receiver is also a horn antenna located at the Fresnel focal distance. Both the reflector and the receiving antenna have some rotation capability to enable measurements from different angles. The experimental results show a good, stable behavior in gain versus the angular position of the feeder. This special property of Fresnel reflectors is impossible in parabolic reflectors and consequently, Fresnel reflectors could be used in new applications as radar imaging, increasing the radar field of view or improving the resolution by means of several squint feeders working simultaneously on the same lens or reflector. Therefore, the main objective {{of this paper is to}} analyze the behavior of this experimental set up for developing new Fresnel reflector-based applications...|$|E

Using previous results of an-tennas {{consisting of a}} narrow slot on a metallic plane and flanked by two grooves, a further step is given here by reducing the thick-ness of the prototype. A key factor in the approach is the operation in the transversal slot resonance {{instead of the usual}} longitudinal slot resonance. Moreover, by inserting a dielectric material of rel-ative permittivity r 1, the thickness can be further reduced, maintaining and even improving the radiation features of the pro-totype. Reducing the metallic plate thickness has important con-sequences in the weight and profile of the antennas, making them easy to handle and to fit into different structures. In addition, in ranges where the wavelength is of the order of centimeters, a thick metallic plate can be a serious drawback due to mechanical restric-tions. In these cases the design following the rules given in this letter can alleviate this constraint. Index Terms—Corrugated plate, subwavelength aperture, very low profile feeder. I...|$|R
