40|$|For Solanaceae type self-incompatibility, {{discrimination}} between {{self and}} nonself pollen by the pistil {{is controlled by the}} highly polymorphic S-RNase gene. To date, the mechanism generating the allelic diversity of this gene is largely unknown. Natural populations offer a good opportunity to address this question because they likely contain different alleles that share recent common progenitors. We identified 19 S haplotypes from a natural population of Petunia inflata in Argentina, used reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction to obtain cDNAs for 15 alleles of the S-RNase gene, and sequenced all the cDNAs. Phylogenetic studies revealed that five of these alleles and two previously identified alleles form a major clade, and that the 5 ′ region of S 19 allele was derived from an <b>ancestor</b> <b>allele</b> closely related to S 2, whereas its 3 ′ region was derived from an <b>ancestor</b> <b>allele</b> closely related to S 8. A similar evolutionary relationship was found among S 3, S 12, and S 15 alleles. These findings suggest that intragenic recombination contributed to the generation of the allelic diversity of the S-RNase gene. Two additional findings emerged from the sequence comparisons. First, the nucleotide sequence of the S 1 allele identified in this work is completely identical to that of the previously identified S 1 allele of a different origin. Second, in the two hypervariable regions HVa and HVb, thought to be involved in determining S allele specificity, S 6 and S 9 alleles differ only by four nucleotides, all in HVb, resulting in two amino acid differences. The implications of these findings are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the role of common ancestry, and of geographical or reproductive isolation, in genetic divergence in populations of threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Using seven DNA microsatellite loci we compared the effects of habitat type, drainage system and geographical proximity on genetic distance among 16 populations situated in an area in Schleswig-Holstein (Germany) that became deglaciated approximate to 12 000 years ago. Stickleback population structure correlated only weakly with drainage system, whereas the primary divergence was among habitat types. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that lake (n = 7) and river (n = 5) populations formed two distinct clades (Cavalli-Sforza's and Edwards' chord distance, 82 - 100 % bootstrap support) at approximately equal genetic distances to a third clade, comprising putative estuarine (n = 4) <b>ancestors.</b> <b>Allele</b> frequencies in lake and river populations represented different subsets of the genetically more diverse estuarine populations. In nested AMOVAS approximately twice the genetic variance was distributed among lake vs. river vs. estuarine populations as compared with the combined effects of drainage system and geographical distance. Limited gene flow between habitat types must have been established after postglacial colonization, suggesting ecological hybrid inferiority or behavioural mating barriers between ecotypes. Within estuarine and lake populations, population differentiation followed an isolation-by-distance model. Given the high observed heterozygosities within the 16 study populations (H-O = 0. 65 - 0. 87), the mean divergence between lake and river population pairs (F-ST = 0. 18 +/- 0. 007) would be reached after 300 - 6000 generations in a stepwise mutation model, depending on the size of N-e. This demonstrates both the utility of hypervariable microsatellites for detecting recent population divergences and the danger of operating at temporal or spatial scales which are beyond their resolutio...|$|R
40|$|Congenital dyserythropoiesis and {{dyskeratosis}} {{occur within}} certain lines of Polled Hereford cattle. Eighty-nine of 90 alleles in 45 affected calves had a mechanism {{in which they}} could be identical by descent from an identified common <b>ancestor.</b> The line <b>allele</b> may have been a recurrence of the mutation, or the mutation may have occurred earlier in the breed's history and been distributed throughout the breed by the extensive use of several ancestors. No evidence of disease has been identified in sire and dams of affected calves, suggesting that the allele is not acting in a dominant or incompletely dominant manner. Even distribution of cases between sexes suggests that the disease is not sex linked or sex influenced. A higher degree of inbreeding in the affected calves and temporal and spatial features that separated individual cases also suggest a genetic cause.

40|$|Escherichia coli {{sequence}} type 131 (ST 131) is an extensively antimicrobial-resistant E. coli clonal {{group that}} has spread explo-sively throughout the world. Recent molecular epidemiologic and whole-genome phylogenetic studies have elucidated the fine clonal structure of ST 131, which comprises multiple ST 131 subclones with distinctive resistance profiles, including the (nested) H 30, H 30 -R, and H 30 -Rx subclones. The most prevalent ST 131 subclone, H 30, arose from a single common fluoroquinolone (FQ) -susceptible <b>ancestor</b> containing <b>allele</b> 30 of fimH (type 1 fimbrial adhesin gene). An early H 30 subclone member acquired FQ resistance and launched {{the rapid expansion of}} the resulting FQ-resistant subclone, H 30 -R. Subsequently, a member of H 30 -R acquired the CTX-M- 15 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and launched the rapid expansion of the CTX-M- 15 -contain-ing subclone within H 30 -R, H 30 -Rx. Clonal expansion clearly is now the dominant mechanism for the rising prevalence of both FQ resistance and CTX-M- 15 production in ST 131 and in E. coli generally. Reasons for the successful dissemination and expan-sion of the key ST 131 subclones remain undefined but may include increased transmissibility, greater ability to colonize and/or persist in the intestine or urinary tract, enhanced virulence, andmore-extensive antimicrobial resistance compared to other E. coli. Here we discuss the epidemiology andmolecular phylogeny of ST 131 and its key subclones, possible mechanisms for their ecological success, implications of their widespread dissemination, and future research needs.

30|$|In this study, we {{analyzed}} the genetic variation of Gn 1 a, which influences grain yield through controlling {{the number of}} spikelets in rice. The allelic variations in the promoter, 5 ’ untranslated region (UTR) and coding sequence (CDS) of Gn 1 a were investigated in 175 cultivars and 21 wild rice accessions. We found that Gn 1 a showed less sequence variation in the cultivars, but exhibited significant nucleotide diversity in wild rice. A total of 14 alleles, named AP 1 to AP 14, were identified in the cultivars based on the amino acid divergence of GN 1 A. Association analysis revealed {{that the number of}} spikelets and grain yield were significantly different between the different alleles. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the three main alleles, AP 3, AP 8 and AP 9, in the cultivars might originate from a common <b>ancestor</b> <b>allele,</b> AP 1, in wild rice.|$|E
40|$|To {{analyze the}} {{contribution}} of progranulin (PGRN) to the etiopathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we performed a PGRN gene screening in 146 Italian patients (12 familial cases) and evaluated the association of two common variants with risk of developing ALS in 239 sporadic cases (SALS). Progranulin mRNA and protein levels were measured in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} and serum of a subset of these patients and controls. PGRN sequence analysis revealed a heterozygous change (p. S 120 Y), previously observed in an independent sporadic ALS-FTD patient. Haplotype analysis showed a conserved PGRN region among these two subjects consistent with possible common <b>ancestor</b> <b>allele.</b> Two non-coding polymorphisms were not associated to increased risk to develop ALS; mRNA and serum levels were not significantly different between cases and controls. Overall, our data argue against the hypothesis of progranulin as a major risk factor for motor neuron dysfunction, at least in Italian population. The p.

40|$|Background: Rice {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} crops, and it is essential to improve rice productivity to satisfy the future global food supply demands. Gn 1 a (OsCKX 2), which encodes cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase, plays an important role in regulating rice grain yield. Results: In this study, we analyzed the genetic variation of Gn 1 a, which influences grain yield through controlling the number of spikelets in rice. The allelic variations in the promoter, 5 ’ untranslated region (UTR) and coding sequence (CDS) of Gn 1 a were investigated in 175 cultivars and 21 wild rice accessions.

Conclusions: Of these alleles in the cultivars, AP 9 was suggested as the best allele in indica, as it has shown strong artificial selection in breeding high-yield rice in the past. It might be valuable to explore the high-yield-related alleles of Gn 1 a to develop high-yield rice cultivars in future breeding programs...|$|E
50|$|In Drosophila, a mutant form of Clock (Jrk) was {{identified}} by Allada, Hall, and Rosbash in 1998. The team used forward genetics to identify non-circadian rhythms in mutant flies. Jrk {{results from a}} premature stop codon that eliminates the activation domain of the CLOCK protein. This mutation causes dominant effects: half of the heterozygous flies with this mutant gene have a lengthened period of 24.8 hours, while the other half become arrhythmic. Homozygous flies lose their circadian rhythm. Furthermore, the same researchers demonstrated that these mutant flies express low levels of PER and TIM proteins, indicating that Clock functions as a positive element in the circadian loop. While the mutation affects the circadian clock of the fly, it does not cause any physiological or behavioral defects. The similar sequence between Jrk and its mouse homolog suggests common circadian rhythm components were present in both Drosophila and mice <b>ancestors.</b> A recessive <b>allele</b> of Clock leads to behavioral arrhythmicity while maintaining detectable molecular and transcriptional oscillations. This suggests that Clk contributes to the amplitude of circadian rhythms.|$|R

The high frequency rate of this mutation identified in the Sicilian population led us to perform haplotype analysis in all family carriers.

40|$|The all-female Amazon molly (Poecilia formosa) is {{the result}} of a {{hybridization}} of the Atlantic molly (P. mexicana) and the sailfin molly (P. latipinna) approximately 120, 000 years ago. As a gynogenetic species, P. formosa needs to copulate with heterospecific males including males from one of its bisexual ancestral species. However, the sperm only triggers embryogenesis of the diploid eggs. The genetic information of the sperm donor typically will not contribute to the next generation of P. formosa. Hence, P. formosa possesses generally one allele from each of its ancestral species at any genetic locus. This raises the question whether both ancestral alleles are equally expressed in P. formosa. Allele-specific expression (ASE) has been previously assessed in various organisms, e. g., human and fish, and ASE was found to be important in the context of phenotypic variability and disease. In this study, we utilized Real-Time PCR techniques to estimate ASE of the androgen receptor alpha (arα) gene in several distinct tissues of Amazon mollies. We found an allelic bias favoring the maternal <b>ancestor</b> (P. mexicana) <b>allele</b> in ovarian tissue. This allelic bias was not observed in the gill or the brain tissue. Sequencing of the promoter regions of both alleles revealed an association between an Indel in a known CpG island and differential expression. Future studies may reveal whether our observed cis-regulatory divergence is caused by an ovary-specific trans-regulatory element, preferentially activating the allele of the maternal ancestor...|$|R
40|$|Apomixis, or asexual seed development, if {{introduced}} into crop species, {{has the potential}} to greatly improve global food production. Towards this goal, this study focused on uncovering the genetic mechanisms that control the parthenogenesis step within apomixis whereby fertilisation is avoided. In the model apomict, Hieracium praealtum (Asteraceae), parthenogenesis is controlled by the LOSS OF PARTHENOGENESIS (LOP) locus. Previous research showed that in addition to genomic copies of candidate genes at LOP, the genome has at least three other copies referred to as alternative alleles. The main goal {{of this study was to}} investigate four candidate genes, Genes B, X, H and Y, at LOP by generating segregation data of the alternative alleles. BAC clones containing alternative allele sequences were identified and Roche 454 pyrosequenced. These sequences were used to design alternative allele specific primers for genotyping two Hieracium praealtum polyhaploid populations (~ 300 plants). Four major conclusions were drawn from this study. First, the alternative alleles were in fact acting like alleles to the LOP alleles of Genes B, X and Y. Second, allelic sequence divergence (ASD) of the LOP alleles of Genes B and X relative to the alternative alleles, indicated a recent and separate evolutionary history. Third and, unexpectedly, recombination was detected at the LOP locus, in contrast to other apomixis loci reported in the literature. Furthermore, Gene B was found to be very closely associated with parthenogenesis in the polyhaploid population indicating that it may be essential to parthenogenesis and therefore requires further investigation. On the other hand, the absence of Genes X, Y and H, due to recombination, had no impact upon parthenogenesis. Fourth, the sequence data suggested that the LOP and alternative alleles originated from a shared common <b>allele</b> <b>ancestor.</b> It is hoped that these findings have made a significant contribution towards the future goal of introducing apomixis into crop species...|$|R
