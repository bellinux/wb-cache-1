40|$|Serum <b>and</b> urinary <b>Potassium</b> <b>and</b> Sodium levels {{tended to}} be raised in {{patients}} with uterine cancer in general. These patients were divided into groups {{according to the international}} method of classification, and serum <b>and</b> urinary <b>Potassium</b> <b>and</b> Sodium concentrations were measured in each stage of the disease. Serum <b>Potassium</b> <b>and</b> Sodium increased with the progress of disease, whereas urinary <b>Potassium</b> <b>and</b> Sodium increased in the second stage and decreased in the third stage.

5|$|Midazolam {{acts as a}} {{sedative}} {{to render}} the condemned prisoner unconscious, at which time the vecuronium bromide <b>and</b> <b>potassium</b> chloride are administered, stopping the prisoner's breathing and heart, respectively. Florida used midazolam to execute William Happ in October 2013. The usage of midazolam in executions has become controversial after condemned inmate Clayton Lockett apparently regained consciousness and started speaking midway through his execution when the state of Oklahoma attempted to execute him with an untested three-drug lethal injection cocktail using 100mg of midazolam. Prison officials reportedly discussed taking him to a hospital before he was pronounced dead {{of a heart attack}} 40 minutes after the execution began.

5|$|Rubidium is the twenty-third most {{abundant}} {{element in the}} Earth's crust, roughly as abundant as zinc and rather more common than copper. It occurs naturally in the minerals leucite, pollucite, carnallite, and zinnwaldite, which contain as much as 1% rubidium oxide. Lepidolite contains between 0.3% and 3.5% rubidium, and is the commercial source of the element. Some potassium minerals <b>and</b> <b>potassium</b> chlorides also contain the element in commercially significant quantities.|$|E

Removing lithium ions resulting from deprotonation with reagents such as LDA can be especially problematic. Potassium and sodium salt by-products tend to precipitate from solution and can be removed. Lithium ions may be chemically removed by binding to species such as cryptands or crown ethers.|$|E

5|$|The low {{concentration}} of calcium in the cytosol allows calcium ions {{to function as}} a second messenger in calcium signaling. Here, a signal such as a hormone or an action potential opens calcium channels so that calcium floods into the cytosol. This sudden increase in cytosolic calcium activates other signalling molecules, such as calmodulin and protein kinase C. Other ions such as chloride <b>and</b> <b>potassium</b> may also have signaling functions in the cytosol, but these are not well understood.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{quantitative}} {{contribution of}} dietary calcium, <b>potassium</b> <b>and</b> magnesium to blood pressure levels remains unknown {{as does the}} combined effect of dietary calcium, <b>potassium</b> <b>and</b> magnesium. METHODS: The relation between blood pressure <b>and</b> dietary calcium, <b>potassium</b> <b>and</b> magnesium and the combined effect of these minerals on blood pressure was studied in 20, 921 Dutch men and women aged 20 - 59 years. Food intake was measured by a food frequency questionnaire. The data were adjusted for age, body mass index, heart rate, alcohol and energy intake. RESULTS: An inverse association was observed between blood pressure <b>and</b> dietary <b>potassium</b> <b>and</b> magnesium in both men and women. Dietary calcium was inversely related to systolic blood pressure (SBP) in women and with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in men. The relation between magnesium intake and blood pressure was stronger than those between blood pressure <b>and</b> intakes of <b>potassium</b> <b>and</b> calcium. Men and women who consumed a diet with intakes in the upper tertiles of all three minerals had a lower SBP and DBP {{compared to those who}} had intakes in the lower tertiles (men: SBP = - 1. 3 (95 % CI: - 2. 6, - 0. 1), DBP = - 1. 9 (95 % CI: - 2. 7, - 1. 0), women: SBP = - 1. 8 (95 % CI: - 3. 1, - 0. 5), DBP = - 1. 5 (95 % CI: - 2. 4, - 0. 7).
