5|$|Smoke-lifting {{devices were}} not a {{priority}} with the normal single-chimney Pacifics. However, with its double chimney and subsequent fitting of a double Kylchap exhaust in 1937, Humorist continued to pose a problem in this regard and <b>always</b> <b>had</b> small wings {{on either side of}} the chimney. Finally, in the 1950s, it acquired the Peppercorn-type of deflector plates.|$|E

5|$|The genre has <b>always</b> <b>had</b> its {{greatest}} appeal for white males. Most {{of the musicians}} involved were male, {{as was the case}} for most rock music of the time, Female singers were better represented in the progressive folk bands, who displayed a broader range of vocal styles than the progressive rock bands with whom they frequently toured and shared band members.|$|E
5|$|The {{supposedly}} higher {{status of}} cavalry in the 4th century is also open to doubt. This view is {{largely based on}} underestimating the importance of cavalry in the 2nd century. Cavalry <b>always</b> <b>had</b> higher status than infantry in the Principate: {{in the time of}} Domitian (r. 81–96), auxiliary cavalry was paid 20–40% more than auxiliary infantry.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia {{rejected}} Singapore's {{argument that}} the traditional Malay concept of sovereignty was based mainly on control over people and not over territory. It stated that authority in states throughout the world {{is based on a}} combination of control over people and territory, and that this applies to the Malay States as it does to any other state. Since the Johor Sultanate was established in the 16th century, it <b>always</b> <b>had</b> rulers who were recognised as such and who thus commanded people's allegiance and therefore controlled the territory where those people lived.|$|E

5|$|Mardas {{was jealous}} about the control the Maharishi had over Lennon, and {{during one of}} their {{frequent}} walks through the woods he asked Lennon why the Maharishi <b>always</b> <b>had</b> an accountant by his side. Lennon replied that the Beatles (or Lennon and Harrison) were considering donating {{a large part of}} their income to the Maharishi's bank accounts in Switzerland. When Mardas questioned the Maharishi about this, he offered money to Mardas to build a high-powered radio station, so he could broadcast Maharishi's teachings to the whole of India.|$|E
5|$|The fishing market, {{historically}} has <b>always</b> <b>had</b> a porpoise bycatch. In 1981, it was legal to kill 22,500 porpoises {{per year to}} catch yellowfin tuna. This type of tuna {{has been known to}} follow porpoises, and when fishermen find these tuna, more often than not, a porpoise is also entangled in a net. Sometimes, a pod of porpoises are herded along with schools of tuna, and when fishermen cast a seine, the porpoises are trapped in the net, and drown because they can't surface. Today, the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 has enforced the use of safer fishing equipment to reduce bycatch.|$|E
5|$|The plebeians {{had finally}} {{achieved}} political equality with the patricians. However, {{the plight of}} the average plebeian had not changed. A small number of plebeian families achieved the same standing that the old aristocratic patrician families had <b>always</b> <b>had,</b> but the new plebeian aristocrats became as uninterested in {{the plight of the}} average plebeian as the old patrician aristocrats had always been. The plebeians rebelled by leaving Rome and refusing to return until they had more rights. The patricians then noticed how much they needed the plebeians and accepted their terms. The plebeians then returned to Rome and continued their work.|$|E

He expressed pressure due to First Strike being his debut as a director and also elaborated on how difficult was creating the storyboard. Yoshida was given the role of screenwriter in order {{to appeal to the}} female fanbase the series has <b>always</b> <b>had.</b> It was released in Japan on October 3, 2009, as a result of delays in production. Kadokawa Pictures distributed the film. It was released in North America on June 26, 2012, by Funimation Entertainment and in the United Kingdom on December 3, 2012, on DVD and Blu-ray by U.K. Anime Industry.|$|E
5|$|The square has <b>always</b> <b>had</b> a park in its centre, {{which was}} {{originally}} Lammas land. The park's fortunes have varied over the centuries, reaching near dilapidation in {{the mid-19th century}} after changing ownership several times. It was restored {{under the direction of}} Albert Grant, which included the construction of four new statues and a fountain of William Shakespeare. The square was extensively refurbished and remodelled for the 2012 London Olympics, costing more than £15m and taking over 17 months to complete.|$|E
5|$|The {{two main}} {{tertiary}} institutions are the Australian National University (ANU) in Acton and the University of Canberra (UC) in Bruce, with over 10,500 and 8,000 full-time-equivalent students respectively.

There are two religious university campuses in Canberra: Signadou in the northern suburb of Watson is a campus of the Australian Catholic University; St Mark's Theological College in Barton is part of the secular Charles Sturt University.|$|E

5|$|While ducks are {{naturally}} aquatic, swimming {{can be dangerous}} to young ducklings, and it can also restrict a duck's growth. Thus, although duckers would ensure the ducklings <b>always</b> <b>had</b> a trough or sink to paddle in, the ducklings would be kept away from bodies of water while they were growing. The exception was shortly before slaughter, when the ducklings would be taken for one swim in a pond, as it helped them to feather properly.|$|E

5|$|York's {{location}} on the River Ouse and in {{the centre of the}} Vale of York means that it has <b>always</b> <b>had</b> a significant position in the nation's transport system. The city grew up as a river port at the confluence of the River Ouse and the River Foss. The Ouse was originally a tidal river, accessible to seagoing ships of the time. Today both of these rivers remain navigable, although the Foss is only navigable for a short distance above the confluence. A lock at Naburn on the Ouse to the south of York means that the river in York is no longer tidal.|$|E
5|$|Although it <b>always</b> <b>had</b> {{hundreds}} of competitors, Standard Oil gradually gained dominance of oil refining and sales as {{market share in}} the United States through horizontal integration, ending up with about 90% of the US market. In the kerosene industry, the company replaced the old distribution system with its own vertical system. It supplied kerosene by tank cars that brought the fuel to local markets, and tank wagons then delivered to retail customers, thus bypassing the existing network of wholesale jobbers. Despite improving the quality and availability of kerosene products while greatly reducing their cost to the public (the price of kerosene dropped by nearly 80% {{over the life of}} the company), Standard Oil's business practices created intense controversy. Standard's most potent weapons against competitors were underselling, differential pricing, and secret transportation rebates.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} intensity to {{the rivalry}} {{is the fact}} that both Maribor and Olimpija <b>always</b> <b>had</b> support on their matches from ultras groups, called Viole Maribor (supporting Maribor), and the Green Dragons, who support Olimpija. The two groups are the largest in the country, and it is not uncommon that the matches between the two clubs were sometimes interrupted by violent clashes between the two groups or with the police. On many occasions, before or after the matches, the fans of the two clubs would also meet up and fight on the streets. One of the worst incidents, in April 2010 after a match, resulted in a stabbing of a member of the Green Dragons who, with a group of friends, got into a fight with members of the Viole in Ljubljana's railway station. However, to date, there have not been any fatalities in the country related to football violence.|$|E
