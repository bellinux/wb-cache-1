5|$|Dusky woodswallows {{adhere to}} {{seasonal}} migration and movements. The birds are a nomadic species, <b>and</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> move quite spontaneously. However, one certain change of habitat occurs for the south-eastern birds, who migrate northward for Autumn.|$|E
5|$|The orioles are {{medium-sized}} passerines, {{mostly with}} bright and showy plumage, the females often duller plumage than the males The beak is long, slightly curved and hooked. Orioles are arboreal <b>and</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> feed in the canopy. There are 27 species worldwide, {{one of which}} has been recorded in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
25|$|Wolfberry {{species are}} {{deciduous}} woody perennial plants, growing 1–3 m high. L. chinense is {{grown in the}} south of China <b>and</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> be somewhat shorter, while L. barbarum is grown in the north, primarily in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, <b>and</b> <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> be somewhat taller.|$|R

5|$|Earthquakes in Alabama are sporadic, <b>and</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> cause {{little to}} no damage. During a 91-year period, there were 19earthquakes, varying from near-imperceptible to damaging. The first known {{activity}} in Alabama, the New Madrid earthquakes of 1812, registered Mercalli intensities of VII (Very strong) throughout the northern and central portions of the state. On February 4, 1886, the first recorded earthquake from Alabama hit {{the western part of}} the state, jolting people in Sumter and Marengo counties.|$|E
5|$|Hull Creek is a second-order stream. Its {{watershed}} {{is relatively}} narrow. In {{the upper reaches}} of the creek's watershed, residential areas are sparse <b>and</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be somewhat removed from the creek itself. In Blakely, it follows Pennsylvania Route 347 closely and crosses it several times. A gas line crosses the creek upstream of US Route 6. There are several patches of wetlands in the watershed's upper reaches, and two more in the middle and lower reaches. Upstream of Blakely, the watershed contains forested land and pastures on a rolling plateau.|$|E

5|$|In evolution, luciferins {{generally}} vary little: one in particular, coelenterazine, is {{the light}} emitting pigment for nine ancient phyla (groups of very different organisms), including polycystine radiolaria, Cercozoa (Phaeodaria), protozoa, comb jellies, cnidaria including jellyfish and corals, crustaceans, molluscs, arrow worms and vertebrates (ray-finned fish). Not all these organisms synthesize coelenterazine: {{some of them}} obtain it through their diet. Conversely, luciferase enzymes vary widely <b>and</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be different in each species. Overall, bioluminescence has arisen over forty times in evolutionary history.|$|E
5|$|Like the sassabies, {{hartebeest}} produce quiet quacking and grunting sounds. Juveniles {{tend to be}} {{more vocal}} than adults, and produce a quacking call when alarmed or pursued. The hartebeest uses defecation as an olfactory and visual display. Herds are generally sedentary, <b>and</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> migrate only under adverse conditions such as natural calamities. The hartebeest is the least migratory in the tribe Alcelaphini (which also includes wildebeest and sassabies), and also consumes the least amount of water and has the lowest metabolic rate among the members of the tribe.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{their native}} range, escaped birds {{frequently}} establish themselves {{in areas with}} a suitable climate and can then colonize new areas nearby. Escaped cage-birds established in the wild and such populations have been recorded in the West Indies (Puerto Rico since 1971), Hawaii (since 1883), Australia, Japan and southern United States mainly in Florida and California. In Oahu, Hawaii, they compete for habitats with the tricolored munia <b>and</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be rare where this competitor is present.|$|E

5|$|Rainbands are {{cloud and}} {{precipitation}} areas which are significantly elongated. Rainbands can be stratiform or convective, and are generated by differences in temperature. When noted on weather radar imagery, this precipitation elongation {{is referred to}} as banded structure. Rainbands in advance of warm occluded fronts and warm fronts are associated with weak upward motion, <b>and</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be wide and stratiform in nature.|$|E
5|$|Rallidae is a {{large family}} of small to {{medium-sized}} birds which includes the rails, crakes, coots, and gallinules. The most typical family members occupy dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps, or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes which are well adapted to soft uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings <b>and</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be weak fliers.|$|E
5|$|Russula densifolia is a {{mycorrhizal}} species. Descriptions {{have been}} published of the morphology of the ectomycorrhizae that it forms with European beech (Fagus sylvatica), and Norway spruce (Picea abies). Its mushrooms grow on the ground singly, scattered, or in groups in both mixed and deciduous forests, <b>and</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> appear {{in the summer and}} autumn. In Spain, it is common in dune pine forests. Fruit bodies can be parasitized by the fungus Asterophora lycoperdoides. Widely distributed, Russula densifolia is known from Asia (including China, India, Japan, and Thailand), Europe and North America.|$|E

5|$|The Hubble Space Telescope {{has been}} used to provide convincing {{observational}} evidence of this stellar mass-sorting process in globular clusters. Heavier stars slow down and crowd at the cluster's core, while lighter stars pick up speed <b>and</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> spend more time at the cluster's periphery. The globular star cluster 47 Tucanae, which is made up of about 1 million stars, is one of the densest globular clusters in the Southern Hemisphere. This cluster was subjected to an intensive photographic survey, which allowed astronomers to track the motion of its stars. Precise velocities were obtained for nearly 15,000 stars in this cluster.|$|E
5|$|The spiny scallop {{usually has}} a {{symbiotic}} relationship with an encrusting sponge which grows on its left valve. This is most often the orange Myxilla incrustans but is sometimes the purple or brown Mycale adherens. The sponge provides camouflage for the scallop and may deter predators from attacking it as sponges often produce a repulsive odour <b>and</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be distasteful. It also {{makes it more difficult}} for a starfish to get the strong grip with its tube feet that it needs to force the two valves of the scallop apart.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of slimes found throughout the Dragon Quest and Rocket Slime series. These include slimes in different colors, bubble slimes, which look like pools of slime, nautical slimes that wear conch shells, the rare metal slimes, which have high defense, give out large amounts of experience points, <b>and</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> flee from battle, healslimes, which have tentacles, and king slimes, which are very large slimes wearing crowns and come in various versions, such as regular or metal.|$|E

5|$|There is {{controversy}} as {{to whether}} VAD {{is more common in}} men or in women; an aggregate of all studies shows that it is slightly higher incidence in men (56% versus 44%). Men are on average 37–44 years old at diagnosis, and women 34–44. While dissection of the carotid and vertebral arteries accounts for only 2% of strokes (which are usually caused by high blood pressure and other risk factors, <b>and</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> occur in the elderly), they cause 10–25% of strokes in young and middle-aged people.|$|E
5|$|Thirteen {{species of}} fleas in the genera Ceratophyllus and Dasypsyllus {{have been found}} on this bunting, and {{internal}} parasites include Ascaridia galli. The yellowhammer may carry haematozoan blood parasites such as Haemoproteus coatneyi. Males with high parasite levels produced fewer offspring (there is no such effect for females), <b>and</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be less brightly coloured. The striking plumage of the male may therefore have arisen as a signal of fitness to breed. Yellowhammers infected with Haemoproteus may have lower winter survival rates due to a tendency to having shorter wings.|$|E
5|$|A slow-moving {{predator}} feeding {{mainly on}} bony fishes, the sicklefin lemon shark seldom travels long distances and many individuals {{can be found}} year-round at certain locations. Like other members of its family, this species is viviparous, with females giving birth {{to no more than}} 13 pups every other year, following a gestation period of 1011 months. Although they are potentially dangerous to humans and known to respond vigorously to any provocation, under normal circumstances, sicklefin lemon sharks are cautious <b>and</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> retreat if approached. The IUCN has assessed this species as Vulnerable; its low reproductive productivity and rate of movement limits the capacity of depleted stocks to recover. Off India and Southeast Asia, this species has been severely depleted or extirpated by unregulated exploitation for its meat, fins, and liver oil.|$|E
