5|$|Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{decides to}} start {{painting}} her mural in the warehouse, {{but has a}} hard time getting started as she is <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> not being perfect. Meanwhile, bored with having to fill out customer complaint cards (which he finds redundant because the complaints are already in the computer), Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) uses them to build a card tower in the annex with other employees. The card tower takes on a deeper meaning for the employees when Pete points out that it is composed of failures made by every one of them (excepting only Pam), and thus proves that they should not be ashamed of their failures. They decide {{to try to make it}} go all the way to the ceiling, but end up one complaint card short. Not wanting to use a blank card as it would defy the point of the tower, Pam offers to complete the tower by getting her first customer complaint. She calls one of their smaller clients, delivers a yo mama joke, and hangs up. The client, whose mother was actually obese and is now deceased, drops Dunder Mifflin as their paper supplier, leaving them simultaneously excited over getting that last complaint and disappointed over losing a client. After celebrating the completion of the card tower, Pam finally starts painting the mural, saying artists should not care too much in what others think, further asserting this by telling off Hide (Hidetoshi Imura) when he insults her artwork.|$|E

[...] Bono added, [...] "it's a very special song that holds inside of it a lot of strong feelings, and I don't know if we're <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> or something, but we should be playing it more." [...] McGuinness said that U2 found it difficult to play live.|$|E
500|$|On September 15, Delucchi {{continued}} his testimony, saying {{that some of}} his men told him they would obey all orders and perform all work except loading ammunition because they were <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Delucchi confirmed that a cook and a man with a broken wrist were among the 25 men in his division that now sat among the 50 accused. Delucchi added that the cook and a second man were sailors he did not consider [...] "up to par"; the cook in particular was prone to nervous attacks and was seen as a liability at the pier.|$|E

2500|$|AIDS {{was seen}} as a disease of gay, White, North American men. And people were really <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> There were no {{treatments}} available in the Caribbean at the time, so AIDS really was a death sentence. You had people with Kaposi's sarcoma, people with violent diarrhea, who were just wasting away and then dying in really horrible and traumatic ways. To call what was going on here [...] "stigma and discrimination" [...] was really an understatement. In the ghettos they were putting tires around people who had AIDS and lighting the tires on fire. They were killing gay people because they thought AIDS was contagious. It was a very extreme environment, and really horrible things were happening.|$|E
2500|$|At a {{press conference}} at the Venice Film Festival in 1963, Resnais said that his film {{depicted}} [...] "the malaise of a so-called happy society. ...A new world is taking shape, my characters are <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> and they don't know how {{to face up to}} it." [...] Muriel has been seen as part of a 'cinema of alienation' of the 1960s, films which [...] "betray a sudden desperate nostalgia for certain essential values". [...] A sense of disruption and uncertainty is constantly emphasised, not least by the style of jump-cutting between events. [...] "The technique of observing absolute chronology while simultaneously following a number of characters and treating even casual passers-by {{in the same manner as}} the main characters gives rise to a hallucinatory realism." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Ledger and Gyllenhaal {{were asked}} about any fear of being cast in such {{controversial}} roles, Ledger responded {{that he was not}} afraid of the role, but rather he was concerned {{that he would not be}} mature enough as an actor to do the story justice. Gyllenhaal has stated that he is extremely proud of the film and his role, regardless of what the reactions would be. He regards rumors of him being bisexual as flattering, stating: [...] "I'm open to whatever people want to call me. I've never really been attracted to men sexually, but I don't think I would be <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> if it happened." [...] Both have stated that the sex scenes in the beginning were difficult to do. Lee found the first scene difficult to film and has stated he has great respect for the two main actors for their [...] "courage". Ledger's performance was described by Luke Davies as a difficult and empowering portrayal given the environment of the film: [...] "In Brokeback Mountain the vulnerability, the potential for danger, is so great – a world so masculine it might destroy you for any aberration – that [...] real brilliance was to bring to the screen a character, Ennis Del Mar, so fundamentally shut down that he is like a bible of unrequited desires, stifled yearnings, lost potential." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Nava {{wakes up}} the next morning she finds a scalpel in her hand. She is <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> and Athos hides it in his clothing. Athos wants to return to the {{unfamiliar}} village, but when they do, they find it sinking into the water, the process referred to as Overcoming. After the trip to the sinking village, they meet three women, one of whom is Nava's mother who was captured by the Dead Ones before. Athos and Nava realize that the Dead Ones who capture women from the villages are actually droids that serve women who live in The City. These women (calling themselves Glorious Helpmates) consider men (and many other biological species) as useless, a [...] "mistake", since the woman are able to breed non-sexually without men. These women profess control over [...] "little ones", and control the violet fog, which is made up of bacteria {{that can be used for}} diverse purposes including communication and assassination. The Glorious Helpmates are participating in a battle with unspecified enemy. The front of this battle separates Athos from the base. The front is allegedly so biologically active that any living creature (even the Glorious Helpmates, who are protected) are likely to die there. The women take Nava from Athos. During the conversation he remembers several important experiences.|$|E
2500|$|Immanuel Kant in his The Critique of Judgment (1790) further clarifies Burke's {{definition}} of the sublime, mostly {{in contrast to the}} beautiful. He says that the beautiful in nature is not quantifiable, but rather focused only in color, form, surface, etc. of an object. Therefore, the beautiful is to be [...] "regarded as a presentation of an indeterminate concept of understanding." [...] However, to Kant, the sublime is more infinite and can be found even in an object that has no form. The sublime should be regarded as a [...] "presentation of an indeterminate concept of reason." [...] Basically, Kant argues that beauty is a temporary response of understanding, but the sublime goes beyond the aesthetics into a realm of reason. Whereas Burke argues that the sublime arises from an object that incites terror, Kant says that an object can be terrifying and thus, sublime, without the beholder actually being <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> But there is much more to Kant's {{definition of}} the sublime. He claims that the sublime in itself is so great that anything compared to it must necessarily be considered small. And, because of that, an important aspect of the sublime is the work of one's imagination to comprehend something so great that it seems inconceivable; thus, one major aspect of the sublime is the power of mankind's mind to recognize it. Kant transforms the sublime from a terrifying object of nature to something intricately connected to the rational mind, and hence to morality.|$|E
