5|$|M. l. lamberti is the {{nominate}} subspecies from coastal eastern Australia and {{the original}} form described by Vigors and Horsfield in 1827. Unlike other subspecies, {{the head of a}} male in breeding plumage is a more uniform blue, with the crown azure <b>and</b> <b>ear</b> coverts lighter. It also has a blue rather than purple back.|$|E
5|$|The {{common cold}} is {{generally}} mild and self-limiting with most symptoms generally improving in a week. Half of cases go away in 10days and 90% in 15days. Severe complications, if they occur, are {{usually in the}} very old, the very young, or those who are immunosuppressed. Secondary bacterial infections may occur resulting in sinusitis, pharyngitis, or an ear infection. It is estimated that sinusitis occurs in 8% <b>and</b> <b>ear</b> infection in 30% of cases.|$|E
5|$|The {{variegated}} fairywren (Malurus lamberti) is a fairywren {{that lives}} in diverse habitats across most of Australia. Four subspecies are recognised. In a species that exhibits sexual dimorphism, the brightly coloured breeding male has chestnut shoulders and azure crown <b>and</b> <b>ear</b> coverts, while non-breeding males, females and juveniles have predominantly grey-brown plumage, although females of the subspecies rogersi and dulcis (previously termed lavender-flanked fairywren) have mainly blue-grey plumage.|$|E
5000|$|The {{pattern in}} most of the {{following}} sections is that each successive more [...] "advanced" [...] group started with the more [...] "primitive" [...] jaws <b>and</b> <b>ears</b> of its predecessors, then developed more mammal-like jaws <b>and</b> <b>ears,</b> <b>and</b> so on. The evolution of mammalian jaw joints <b>and</b> <b>ears</b> did not proceed neatly in lockstep with the evolution of other mammalian features. In other words, jaw joints <b>and</b> <b>ears</b> do not define any except the last of the various stages into which paleontologists divide the evolution towards the mammalian anatomy.|$|R

5|$|The yellow-tailed black {{cockatoo}} {{is distinguished}} from other dark-plumaged birds by its yellow tail <b>and</b> <b>ear</b> markings, and its contact call. Parts of its range overlap with the ranges of two cockatoo species that have red tail banding, the red-tailed cockatoo and the glossy black cockatoo. Crow species may appear similar when seen flying at a distance; however, crows have shorter tails, a quicker wing beat, and different calls.|$|E
5|$|Within the Maluridae, {{it is one}} of 12 {{species in}} its genus, Malurus. It is closely related to the Australian white-winged fairywren, and the white-shouldered fairywren of New Guinea. Termed the bicoloured wrens by ornithologist Richard Schodde, these three species are notable for their lack of head {{patterns}} <b>and</b> <b>ear</b> tufts, and one-coloured black or blue plumage with contrasting shoulder or wing colour; they replace each other geographically across northern Australia and New Guinea.|$|E
5|$|A 2004 review {{reported}} 46% of bites occurring on distal extremities of the limbs, 25% on proximal {{areas of}} limbs (upper arms and thighs), 21% on the trunk, and 7% {{on the head}} or neck. In some cases the same spider bites a victim multiple times. Historically, victims were often bitten on the genitalia, though this phenomenon disappeared as outhouses were superseded by plumbed indoor toilets. Conversely, bites {{on the head and}} neck have increased with use of safety helmets <b>and</b> <b>ear</b> muffs. Precautions to avoid being bitten include wearing gloves and shoes while gardening, not leaving clothes on the floor, and shaking out gloves or shoes before putting them on. Also, children can be educated not to touch spiders.|$|E

5|$|A 2005 {{survey of}} 10,503 people in England {{over the age}} of 16 found that {{approximately}} 10% (1,049) had body piercings in sites other than the earlobe, with a heavy representation of women aged 16â€“24 (46.2% piercing in that demographic). Among the most common body sites, the navel was top at 33%, with the nose <b>and</b> <b>ear</b> (other than lobe) following at 19% and 13%. The tongue and nipple tied at 9%. The eyebrow, lip and genitals were 8%, 4% and 2%, respectively. Preference among women followed closely on that ranking, though eyebrow piercings were more common than nipple piercings. Among male responders, the order was significantly different, descending in popularity from nipple, eyebrow, ear, tongue, nose, lip and genitals.|$|E
5|$|Measurements for {{the first}} two known {{examples}} are as follows (in each case, the first measurement given is from the holotype, taken in 1904, the second, from the specimen taken in 1966): head and body length 125 and 118mm (4.9 and 4.6in), tail length 115 and 110mm (4.5 and 4.3in), hindfoot length 27 and 28mm (1.1 and 1.1in), ear length 13 and 15mm (0.51 and 0.59in), skull length 29.8 and 29.0mm (1.17 and 1.14in). The 1966 specimen weighed 46.0g (1.62oz) and had testes 11mm (0.43in) long; these measurements were not recorded in the 1904 specimen. Reid, who mentioned the third specimen, reported a maximum head and body length of 128mm (5.0in), tail length of 150mm (5.9in), hindfoot length of 31mm (1.2in), <b>and</b> <b>ear</b> length of 19mm (0.75in).|$|E
5|$|One day, Indra, {{the king}} of the Devas (celestial deities), {{disguised}} as a Brahmin, approaches Karnan and asks for his armour <b>and</b> <b>ear</b> rings in donation to weaken and stop him from overpowering Arjuna. Aware of Indra's intention, Karnan yet donates both the items he was born with and which would make him invincible. Pleased with Karnan's generosity, Indra gives him a powerful weapon, Nagastra, but states that he can use it only once. Karnan, disguised as a Brahmin, becomes the student of the sage Parasurama to acquire the Brahmastra; one day, however, Parasurama realises that Karnan is a Kshatriya, a tribe he opposes. Enraged, he renders Karnan incapable of using the Brahmastra when most needed, and banishes him.|$|E

5|$|The {{adult male}} has a dark grey beak and pink eye-rings. The adult female has a bone-coloured beak, grey eye-rings <b>and</b> <b>ear</b> patches that are whiter and more {{distinctive}} {{than those of}} the male. The feathers of its underparts and underwing coverts have larger white margins {{than those of the}} male, leading to a more barred or scalloped pattern to its plumage. Its legs and feet are a little lighter than those of the male. Moulting appears to take place in stages in late summerâ€”some time between January or February and April or May, and is poorly understood.|$|E
5|$|Well-to-do men {{wore the}} Petha or Kulavi, a tall turban made of silk and {{decorated}} with gold. As in most Indian societies, jewellery was used {{by men and women}} and records describe the use of anklets, bracelets, finger-rings, necklaces <b>and</b> <b>ear</b> rings of various types. During celebrations, men and women adorned themselves with flower garlands and used perfumes made of rose water, civet musk, musk or sandalwood. In stark contrast to the commoners whose lives were modest, the lives of the empire's kings and queens were full of ceremonial pomp in the court. Queens and princesses had numerous attendants who were lavishly dressed and adorned with fine jewellery, their daily duties being light.|$|E
5|$|William Wilde was Ireland's leading oto-ophthalmologic (ear and eye) {{surgeon and}} was knighted in 1864 for his {{services}} as medical adviser and assistant commissioner to the censuses of Ireland. He also wrote books about Irish archaeology and peasant folklore. A renowned philanthropist, his dispensary {{for the care of}} the city's poor at the rear of Trinity College, Dublin, was the forerunner of the Dublin Eye <b>and</b> <b>Ear</b> Hospital, now located at Adelaide Road. On his father's side Wilde was descended from a Dutchman, Colonel de Wilde, who went to Ireland with King William of Orange's invading army in 1690. On his mother's side Wilde's ancestors included a bricklayer from County Durham who emigrated to Ireland sometime in the 1770s.|$|E

5|$|Approximately {{one out of}} one {{thousand}} children suffer some type of congenital deafness related {{to the development of}} the inner ear. Inner ear congenital anomalies are related to sensorineural hearing loss and are generally diagnosed with a computed tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Hearing loss problems also derive from inner ear anomalies because its development is separate from that of the middle and external ear. Middle ear anomalies can occur because of errors during head and neck development. The first pharyngeal pouch syndrome associates middle ear anomalies to the malleus and incus structures as well as to the non-differentiation of the annular stapedial ligament. Temporal bone <b>and</b> <b>ear</b> canal anomalies are also related to this structure of the ear and are known to be associated with sensorineural hearing loss and conductive hearing loss.|$|E
5|$|Like other fairywrens, {{the superb}} fairywren is notable for its marked sexual dimorphism, males {{adopting}} a highly visible breeding plumage of brilliant iridescent blue contrasting {{with black and}} grey-brown. The brightly coloured crown <b>and</b> <b>ear</b> tufts are prominently featured in breeding displays. The breeding male has a bright-blue forehead, ear coverts, mantle and tail, brown wings, and black throat, eye band, breast and bill. Females, immatures, and non-breeding males are a plain fawn colour with a lighter underbelly and a fawn (females and immatures) or dull greyish blue (males) tail. The bill is brown in females and juveniles and black in males after their first winter. Immature males moult into breeding plumage the first breeding season after hatching, though incomplete moulting sometimes leaves residual brownish plumage that takes another year or two to perfect. Both sexes moult in autumn after breeding, with males assuming an eclipse non-breeding plumage. They moult again into nuptial plumage in winter or spring. Breeding males' blue plumage, particularly the ear-coverts, is highly iridescent because of the flattened and twisted surface of the barbules. The blue plumage also reflects ultraviolet light strongly, and so {{may be even more}} prominent to other fairywrens, whose colour vision extends into this part of the spectrum.|$|E
5|$|Petter's big-footed mouse is a {{terrestrial}} rodent {{with short}} forelimbs and long hindfeet. With a head and body length of 150mm (5.9in) and body mass of 105g (3.7oz) {{in the only}} known complete specimen, it is much larger than M.bastardi, and its measurements fall {{at or above the}} upper end of the known range of variation in M.ingens. The upperparts are covered with soft and short, brown fur. Most cover hairs (the main part of the fur) are dark brown for the two-thirds closest to the base, then light brown, with a short dark brown tip. The middle of the back appears darker, because the cover hairs there are entirely dark brown. The hairs are 6 to 8mm (0.2 to 0.3in) long on the shoulders and 7 to 9mm (0.3 to 0.4in) on the back. The guard hairs are gray. Because the flanks lack entirely dark cover hairs, they are slightly lighter than the rest of the upperparts. They are sharply separated in color from the underparts, which are entirely white to buffish. The mystacial vibrissae (whiskers above the mouth) are long, up to 60mm (2.4in), and white or black in color. The pinnae (external ears) are dark brown and covered with fine gray hairs, <b>and</b> <b>ear</b> length is 32mm (1.3in).|$|E
