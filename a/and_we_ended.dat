However, Kazinsky said they {{developed}} a bond while filming, [...] "Because we were working so tight together, we would finish and then we would go out for dinner every night and we would go to the gym together on days off we had… The emotional scene toward the end with the father-son parting, it was very easy for me to play because I had grown to actually genuinely love Max as a man and as a friend." [...] Kazinsky revealed that Herc and Chuck's pet bulldog was del Toro's idea and said, [...] "The dog's name was Max, ironically, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>ended</b> up using Max for so many things. The story was that Herc and Chuck have difficulty communicating, that they communicated via the dog, and all the love that they couldn't show each other they would show the dog." [...] The role was originally written for Ron Perlman, but del Toro decided the scenes between Perlman's Herc and Hunnam's Raleigh [...] "might start to feel like Sons of Anarchy 2.0".|$|E
500|$|During {{the course}} of the production, the {{creative}} styles of Anderson and Parrish came into conflict. Anderson remembered that on several occasions Kanter was called on to mediate: [...] " [...] both knew how important the picture was to our careers, and we both desperately {{wanted to be in the}} big time." [...] During one session, Parrish refused to follow the shooting script, having determined independently that not all the scripted scenes were essential to the plot. When Anderson reminded Parrish of his contractual responsibilities, the director announced to the cast and crew, [...] "Hell, you heard the producer. If I don't shoot these scenes which I don't really want, don't need and will cut out anyway, I'll be in breach of contract. So what we'll do is shoot those scenes next!" [...] Anderson discussed how the production of Doppelgänger presented new challenges, explaining, [...] "I had worked for so many years employing directors to do what I told them... Suddenly I came up against a Hollywood movie director who didn't want to play <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>ended</b> up extremely bad friends." [...] In his 2002 biography, Anderson stated that his sole regret about the film [...] " [...] that I hired Bob Parrish in the first place." [...] Sylvia Anderson comments that Parrish's direction was [...] "uninspired. We had a lot of trouble getting what we wanted from him." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} [...] "Compass Point", a song Frankel wrote in 45 minutes, is a {{reference}} to Chris Blackwell's Compass Point Studios, where numerous popular musicians in the style mixture of funk, reggae and synthpop, that Crime Cutz pays a tribute to, recorded their music. Its working title was [...] "Back to Earth", {{and was the first}} song to be written for but was not included on their second studio album Dynamics. As Millhiser explains, [...] "There was always some indescribable thing about it that irked us, so we went back to that song with the intention of being like, 'Oh, you know, it’s just a matter of re-recording the vocals or the piano, and it’ll be done.' That of course was not the case, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>ended</b> basically just keeping the drums and one line from the song, making a totally different song out of it, essentially remixing ourselves." [...] Frankel called the EP's closer, [...] "Footsteps", to be the least rhythmic of all the tracks. Its original title was [...] "Your Favorite Band/Footsteps". As Frankel described coming up with the name, [...] "I was going the other night to see our friends in Hot Chip. When I was there, I overheard some people saying, 'I thought they were playing, but they’re DJing,' and that’s something that happens all the time now. People go to see their favorite band, and it turns out it’s a DJ set. I thought it was kind of funny, and also kind of sad — but in a funny way." [...] While the version of Crime Cutz that was officially released only consists of four tracks, Holy Ghost! said in their January 2016 announcement of the EP that a fifth track might be included; [...] "We’re still messing around, because {{we have a lot of}} demos from this last year and a half, and we’re sifting through, figuring out if there’s one more we want to finish." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{inspiration}} for the album shifted when Maida traveled to Sudan and Darfur to shoot a documentary with War Child {{in the middle of}} recording. [...] "We were there for a couple of weeks, and we came back from that and went right back into the studio, and it was like: 'God, this song sucks. I’m not saying that anymore.' You start reflecting on lyrics and any message you’re trying to get out there, and it really altered everything again." [...] The band recorded in six-week spurts, traveling between studios in Toronto, Los Angeles and Maui, recording more songs. With no deadline from the record company, they kept recording and gaining more perspective. [...] "We'd get together, write, record, take two weeks off, go back in <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>ended</b> up doing that on and off for the last two-and-a-half or three years," [...] By this time, over forty songs were recorded including [...] "Picture", [...] "Don't Ask Why" [...] (Where Are You), [...] "Holy Ghost" [...] (Angels/Losing/Sleep) and [...] "Vampires", which was briefly considered for the album's title. The sessions became strained at times as the band couldn't figure out where the album was going. [...] "We had so many songs," [...] said Taggart, [...] "and we just started to go crazy." [...] Many songs went through multiple incarnations such as [...] "Boy", which caused the band a lot of stress and took over three weeks to break down and re-record. They were also butting heads with their producer. [...] "There were some fucking horrible sessions," [...] Maida admitted.|$|E

It was our misfortune not to see the magician who compelled all the marvels on which we looked, but for that very reason, perhaps, we have the clearest sense of his greatness. Everywhere we beheld the evidences of his ingenious but lugubrious fancy, which everywhere tended to a monumental and mortuary effect. A sort of vestibule first received us, and beyond this dripped and glimmered the garden. The walls of the vestibule were covered with inscriptions setting forth the sentiments of the philosophy and piety of all ages concerning life and death; we began with Confucius, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>ended</b> with Benjamino Franklino. But as if these ideas of mortality were not sufficiently depressing, the funereal Signor P---- had collected into earthen amphoræ {{the ashes of the}} most famous men of ancient and modern times, and arranged them so that a sense of their number and variety should at once strike his visitor. Each jar was conspicuously labeled with the name its illustrious dust had borne in life; and if one escaped with comparative cheerfulness from the thought that Seneca had died, there were in the very next pot the cinders of Napoleon to bully him back to a sense of his mortality.|$|E

6000|$|Oct. 7, 1862.—Reflected {{further on}} what I should say about [...] Lancashire and America, for both these {{subjects}} are critical.... At two {{we went to}} Newcastle and saw the principal objects, [...] including especially the fine church and lantern, the gem of an [...] old castle, and Grey Street—I think our best modern street. The [...] photographer also laid hands on me. At six {{we went to a}} crowded [...] and enthusiastic dinner of near 500. I was obliged to make a long [...] oration which was admirably borne. The hall is not very easy to [...] fill with the voice, but quite practicable. 8.—Reached Gateshead [...] at 12, and after an address and reply, embarked {{in the midst of a}} [...] most striking scene which was prolonged and heightened as we went [...] down the river at the head of a fleet of some 25 steamers, amidst [...] the roar of guns and the banks lined or dotted above and below [...] with multitudes of people. The expedition lasted six hours, and I [...] had as many speeches as hours. Such a pomp I shall probably never [...] again witness; circumstances have brought upon me what I do not in [...] any way deserve.... The spectacle was really one for Turner, no [...] one else. 9.—Off to Sunderland. Here we had a similar reception [...] and a progress through the town and over the docks and harbour [...] works. I had to address the naval men, and then came a large [...] meeting in the hall. Thence by rail to Middlesborough. At [...] Darlington we were met by Lord Zetland, the mayor, and others. [...] Middlesborough was as warm or even warmer. Another progress and [...] steamboat procession and incessant flood of information respecting [...] this curious place.

6000|$|At any rate, {{it was not}} to be. Raymond had {{identified}} himself with Sellers in the play-going imagination, and whether consciously or unconsciously we constantly worked with Raymond in our minds. But before this time bitter displeasures had risen between Clemens and Raymond, and Clemens was determined that Raymond should never have the play. He first offered it to several other actors, who eagerly caught it, only to give it back with the despairing renunciation, [...] "That is a Raymond play." [...] We tried managers with it, but their only question was whether they could get Raymond to do it. In the mean time Raymond had provided himself with a play for the winter--a very good play, by Demarest Lloyd; and he was in no hurry for ours. Perhaps he did not really care for it perhaps he knew when he heard of it that it must come to him in the end. In the end it did, from my hand, for Clemens would not meet him. I found him in a mood of sweet reasonableness, perhaps the more softened by one of those lunches which our publisher, the hospitable James R. Osgood, was always bringing people together over in Boston. He said that he could not do the play that winter, but he was sure that he should like it, and he had no doubt he would do it the next winter. So I gave him the manuscript, in spite of Clemens's charges, for his suspicions and rancors were such that he would not have had me leave it for a moment in the actor's hands. But it seemed a conclusion that involved success and fortune for us. In due time, but I do not remember how long after, Raymond declared himself delighted with the piece; he entered into a satisfactory agreement for it, and {{at the beginning of the}} next season he started with it to Buffalo, where he was to give a first production. At Rochester he paused long enough to return it, with the explanation that a friend had noted to him the fact that Colonel Sellers in the play was a lunatic, and insanity was so serious a thing that it could not be represented on the stage without outraging the sensibilities of the audience; or words to that effect. We were too far off to allege Hamlet to the contrary, or King Lear, or to instance the delight which generations of readers throughout the world had taken in the mad freaks of Don Quixote. Whatever were the real reasons of Raymond for rejecting the play, we had to be content with those he gave, and to set about getting it into other hands. In this effort we failed even more signally than before, if that were possible. At last a clever and charming elocutionist, who had long wished to get himself on the stage, heard of it and asked to see it. We would have shown it to any one by this time, and we very willingly showed it to him. He came to Hartford and did some scenes from it for us. I must say he did them very well, quite as well as Raymond could have done them, in whose manner he did them. But now, late toward spring, the question was where he could get an engagement with the play, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>ended</b> by hiring a theatre in New York for a week of trial performances.|$|E
