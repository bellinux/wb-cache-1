5000|$|In the mid-17th and 18th century house bonnets worn {{by women}} and girls were {{generally}} brimless headcoverings which were secured by tying under the chin, and which covered {{no part of the}} forehead. They were worn indoors, to keep the hair tidy, and outdoors, to keep dust out of the hair. With hairstyles becoming increasingly elaborate after 1770, the calash was worn outdoors to protect the hair from wind and weather: a hood of silk stiffened with whalebone or <b>arched</b> <b>cane</b> battens, collapsible like a fan or the calash top of a carriage, they were fitted with ribbons to allow them to be held secure in a gale.|$|E
40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} the hills of Maremma located in the municipality of Pitigliano, in a small plant established with the grape variety “Malvasia di Candia aromatica” grafted on 420 A, placed at a distance of m 1 x 1, and bred with typical system supports "according" consisting of crossed reeds (Arundo donax) and trained to a local system “Capovolto Toscano“ consisting of 9 buds per vine (2 on the spur and 7 on the <b>arched</b> <b>cane).</b> The technique of cultivating the grape bunches early thinning of translucent phase, to bring the maximum load of a bunch to branch, and the removal of leaves located in the bunch. The harvest was carried out in October (between 4 and 17 October) in order to obtain a slight over ripeness of the grapes to achieve sugar content exceeding 220 g/L. Winemaking technology has provided the crushing, a brief maceration and fermentation, after static decantation in oak barrels, after the addition of LSA. During their stay in wood barrels (Allier) were periodically (every 15 days) put in suspension the fine grained yeast. Altogether the wine remained in the woods for about 17 months. Have been taken into account for five years (2002 - 2003 - 2004 - 2005 - 2006), of which all bottled except for 2005 and 2006, again in oak barrels, 2005 respectively shortly before bottling and the 2006 still undergoing refinement. The samples were subjected to sensory analysis at the same time by a trained panel using a parametric unstructured description, so you get a sensory profile, on the basis of color descriptors, aroma and taste. In addition were also used hedonistic descriptors (frankness, balance quality and attractiveness). Moreover there were evaluated the correlations between sensory descriptors, the vintage and hedonistic indexes. Physical and chemical analyses completed the picture of the characteristics of the wines which were related to the sensory evaluations. The results obtained are discussed in perspective using the grape on a larger scale, given the promising results obtained...|$|E
50|$|Rubus philadelphicus is an prickly shrub with <b>arching</b> <b>canes,</b> {{slightly}} prickly. Fruit is fleshy and by {{all accounts}} good-tasting.|$|R
50|$|Growing up to 5 m tall by 3 m broad, {{it forms}} clumps of slender <b>arching</b> <b>canes</b> which turn black after {{two or three}} seasons. The {{abundant}} lance-shaped leaves are 4 - 13 cm long.|$|R
50|$|Bramble bushes have long, thorny, arching shoots {{and root}} easily. They send up long, <b>arching</b> <b>canes</b> {{that do not}} flower or set fruit until {{the second year of}} growth. Brambles usually have trifoliate or palmately-compound leaves.|$|R
50|$|Rubus hawaiensis is a {{deciduous}} shrub, typically {{growing as}} {{a clump of}} erect or (when longer) <b>arching</b> <b>canes,</b> 1.5 - 3 m long. The leaves are compound, with three leaflets. The fruit is red, large (up to 4 cm long and 2.5 cm wide), and edible but not often eaten, as it is sour and somewhat bitter.|$|R
50|$|Rosa glauca is a {{deciduous}} arching shrub of sparsely bristled and thorny cinnamon-coloured <b>arching</b> <b>canes</b> 1.5-3 m tall. The {{most distinctive}} feature is its leaves, which are glaucous blue-green to coppery or purplish, {{and covered with}} a waxy bloom; they are 5-10 cm long and have 5-9 leaflets. The fragile, clear pink flowers are 2.5-4 cm in diameter, and are produced in clusters of two to five. The fruit is a dark red globose hip 10-15 mm in diameter.|$|R
5|$|Cottage {{gardens are}} always {{associated}} with roses: shrub roses, climbing roses, and old garden roses with lush foliage, {{in contrast to}} the gangly modern hybrid tea roses. Old cottage garden roses include cultivated forms of Rosa gallica, which form dense mounded shrubs 3–4ft high and wide, with pale pink to purple flowers—with single form to full double form blooms. They are also very fragrant, and include the ancient Apothecary's rose (R. gallica 'Officinalis'), whose magenta flowers were preserved solely for their fragrance. Another old fragrant cottage garden rose is the Damask rose, which is still grown in Europe for use in perfumes. Cultivated forms of this grow 4 to 6ft or higher, with gently <b>arching</b> <b>canes</b> that help give an informal look to a garden. Even taller generally are the Alba roses, which are not always white, and which bloom well even in partial shade.|$|R

40|$|General Description. —Roseleaf raspberry, {{also known}} as wild raspberry, Mauritius raspberry, Queensland raspberry, fresa de montaña, framboisier, and akalakala, is an {{evergreen}} scrambling shrub, freestanding to 0. 75 m, taller when supported on other vegetation, and extending laterally 2 m or more. Individual plants usually have several <b>arching</b> stems (<b>canes)</b> with basal diameters of 0. 5 to 1 cm and have a 3 -mm pith. Stems are green with reddish coloration at the nodes and lower portions. Wood of the lower stems is moderately hard and brittle.

5000|$|The {{procession}} tradition {{began in}} 1949. More recently, the straw skimmers have changed to styrofoam hats, and classmates take bites {{out of one}} another's hats. When the procession reaches College Hall, the students make an <b>arch</b> with their <b>canes</b> to greet the President of the University. The outgoing and incoming senior class presidents then give speeches, and the juniors are [...] "officially" [...] declared seniors. In May 2015, the university commemorated {{the celebration of the}} 100th Hey Day.|$|R
50|$|If an {{observer}} {{stands in the}} archway of the bell tower and looks upward {{you will see a}} series of parallel lines running up from the supporting massive cut stone base {{to the top of the}} arch. The lines were formed by the long ago disintegration of cane which was used to form the stone <b>arch</b> way. The <b>cane</b> would be bent in the desired shape (a gothic arch) and supported from beneath. Then the masons would place the rubble and mortar in shape. The first layer would be allowed to set and then the higher level would be installed, again built with a combination of rubble and cut stone placed at the edges of the structure. The Cathedral before the 1960s was covered in baroque ornamentation from much later periods.|$|R

I want four long bits of cane, {{a square}} of white cloth, some pieces of thin wood, and the gum-pot," [...] said Will, sitting up to examine the little cart, feeling like a boy again as {{he took out his}} knife and began to whittle. Upstairs and downstairs ran Nelly till all {{necessary}} materials were collected, and almost breathlessly she watched her brother <b>arch</b> the <b>canes</b> over the cart, cover them with the cloth, and fit an upper shelf of small compartments, each lined with cotton-wool to serve as beds for wounded insects, lest they should hurt one another or jostle out. The lower part was left free for any larger creatures which Nelly might find. Among her toys she had a tiny cask which only needed a peg to be water-tight; this was filled and fitted in before, because, as the small sufferers needed no seats, there was no place for it behind, and, as Nelly was both horse and driver, it was more convenient in front. On each side of it stood a box of stores. In one were minute rollers, as bandages are called, a few bottles not yet filled, and a wee doll's jar of cold-cream, because Nelly could not feel that her outfit was complete without a medicine-chest. The other box was full of crumbs, bits of sugar, bird-seed, and grains of wheat and corn, lest any famished stranger should die for want of food before she got it home. Then mamma painted [...] "U.S. San. Com." [...] in bright letters on the cover, and Nelly received her charitable plaything with a long sigh of satisfaction.|$|R
