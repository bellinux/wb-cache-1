40|$|Septic {{shock and}} {{pulmonary}} embolism remain {{leading causes of}} death in intensive care units. Recent therapeutic advances have contributed to decrease the mortality rate of septic shock. Among these, early goal directed hemodynamic therapy, corticoid and activated protein C are the most efficient. However, due to the increased incidence of sepsis, the absolute number of deaths remains unacceptably high. In order to improve the prognosis of septic patients, the "surviving sepsis campaign" started in 2002. Its main objective is to decrease mortality rate of sepsis by 25 % {{in the next five}} years. The diagnostic strategy of pulmonary embolism has been improved by the use of validated algorithms using clinical probability, d-dimers, <b>angioscan</b> and venous doppler. The growing use of low molecular weight heparin has also improved and facilitated the therapeutic management of pulmonary embolism while indication of fibrinolysis in presence of right ventricular dysfunction, but without shock, remains controversial.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesPelvic {{arteriovenous}} malformations (AVMs) {{are difficult}} to treat. Arterial embolisation {{is the most common}} strategy but often has poor results. We report an alternative surgical approach of controlled intra-operative transvenous embolisation with long-term results in seven cases. Materials and methodsBetween 1980 and 2008, we treated seven patients (four men, three women, mean age 50 years). Indications were rectal bleeding (one case), urinary tract problems (four cases), oedema of lower limb (one case) and high-output cardiac failure (one case). Four of them had previous operations and three had previous attempts for embolisation. Embolisation of the malformation was performed through the internal iliac vein. This was done after clamping of all the feeding and draining vessels. The agent used was cyanocrylate (one case), Ethibloc (one case) and bone wax (five cases). ResultsMortality was 0 %. Complications occurred in two patients (28, 5 %), one pulmonary embolism and one regressive femoral paresis. Three patients were re-operated for various reasons. The mean follow-up period was 6 years (1 – 12 years). Symptoms resolved in all patients, while control by computed tomography (CT) <b>angioscan</b> revealed one residual shunt. ConclusionComplete surgical excision of pelvic AVMs is not always possible. Embolisation does not offer a permanent cure. Intra-operative transvenous embolisation of persisting complex AVMs appears to be an alternative approach with good immediate and long-term results. Ethylene glycol appears to be the most suitable agent...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{incidence}} of associated vascular lesions in biligamentous cruciate injuries {{of the knee}} ranges from 16 to 64 %, with a mean rate of 30 %. Treatment of ischemic vascular lesions associated with ligaments injury is well established, comprising emergency arterial vascular repair, {{most of the times}} combined to external fixation. In the absence of clinical symptoms of vascular lesion, some authors recommend systematically performing arteriography, while others advocate selectively prescribing this examination in doubtful clinical situations. The present study analyzed data extracted from the prospective series of the 2008 SOFCOT Symposium (dedicated to management of bicruciate knee lesions) and from an analysis of the literature, with emphasis on developing a diagnostic strategy for vascular lesions associated with bicruciate lesions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This multicenter prospective study included all patients treated in the reference centers for dislocation or bicruciate lesion of the knee between January 2007 and January 2008. All patients underwent early objective vascular imaging. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients were included. Mean dislocation reduction time was 2 hrs 45 min (max, 21 hrs). There were nine vascular lesions (12 %). Absence of vascular lesion could be confirmed in 58 of the 59 patients exhibiting presence of peripheral pulses at initial examination. In one case, a vascular lesion was found on early imaging, but with no clinical consequence. In all eight cases with associated clinical pulse abnormality, complementary vascular check-up confirmed the presence of a vascular lesion. <b>Angioscan</b> induced no error of vascular assessment in this series, with no false positives or false negatives. One patient underwent amputation for critical ischemia. Three patients had vascular surgical treatment, two not undergoing secondary ligament surgery. Four of the five patients whose vascular lesion was conservatively managed by simple observation were able to undergo the scheduled treatment for their ligament lesions. DISCUSSION: At initial examination, it is essential to look for the peripheral pulse. In case of ischemic syndrome, the priority is a revascularization procedure associated to intraoperative arteriography. In case of abnormal pulse without obvious ischemia, emergency imaging (usually arteriogram or <b>angioscan)</b> is essential. Where there is no initial clinical vascular abnormality, good practice is less clearly cut. Initially, present pulses are found in a mean 30 % (17 - 55 %) of cases of popliteal artery lesion, according to the series. Different authors draw diverging conclusions from this fact. For some, the absence of frank abnormality on clinical examination is sufficient to exclude not any possible anatomic vascular lesion but any vascular lesion requiring surgery. However, even without pulse abnormality, we consider systematic imaging to be justified, partly by the difficulty of ensuring strict monitoring, and partly by the decompensation risk of clinically asymptomatic intimal lesions during the ligament surgery under consideration in most cases. Although many authors cling to the dogma of late emergency arteriography, recent reports argue against this attitude. Angio-MRI has good diagnostic value, but in practice is difficult to obtain in emergency. We would rather advocate angioscanning, which is easily available in emergency and does not incur the risk of local complication associated with arteriography...|$|E
40|$|Objective. To assess by noninvasive methods degree, {{character}} and relationship of structural and functional endothelium state disturbances in {{different regions of}} vascular bed in systemic vasculitides. Material and methods. 65 pts with systemic vasculitides were examined: 20 with hemorrhagic vasculitis (HV), 20 — with thromboangitis obliterans (TO), 10 — with polyarteritis nodosa (PN), 15 — with Takayasu arteritis (ТА). 30 conditionally healthy persons {{were included in the}} control group. Carotid <b>angioscanning</b> with intima-media complex thickness (IMT) measurement and functional tests on brachial artery under sonographic control using SONOS- 1500 apparatus with assessment of endothelium-dependent and endothelium- independent vasodilatation were performed. Intracutaneous blood flow was examined by laser Doppler flowmetry with functional tests using LAKK- 01 apparatus. Results. Examination of common carotid arteries showed significant increase of IMP in pts with PN and ТА. Pts with HV and TO did not differ from control. Endothelium-dependent vasodilatation was decreased in all groups of pts. The most prominent changes were revealed in ТА and TO. Response to nitroglycerine was normal only in pts with TO. In other groups it was decreased. Endothelium sensitivity to reactive hyperemia was decreased. Hyperemic type of microcirculation prevailed in groups with systemic vasculitides but in HV group microcirculation was mainly normal. Capillary blood flow reserve was significantly lower in PN and TO. Correlation relationship was revealed between main IMP, brachial artery reactivity measures and skin microcirculation. Conclusion. Structural and functional endothelium state disturbances of different regions of vascular bed revealed in systemic vasculitides are interconnected what proves their participation in endothelium damage in these diseases...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Knee {{dislocation}} and bicruciate lesions are rare. Assessments {{of results}} from retrospective series carry an insufficient level of evidence. A prospective multicenter study was therefore set up, {{under the auspices}} of the French Society of Orthopedic Surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The inclusion period covered the whole of 2007. Clinical, imaging (dynamic X-ray and MRI) and vascular (<b>angioscan</b> and arteriography) assessment was performed systematically. In patients over the age of 60 years, ligament lesions were always managed non-surgically; in those under the age of 60 years, surgery was considered in the absence of associated vascular lesion or open dislocation and if there was frontal laxity exceeding 15 degrees or a posterior drawer test greater than 10 mm. The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and peripheral ligament tears were repaired or reinforced under arthroscopy or by arthrotomy. The anterior cruciate ligament was never operated on. In all other cases, management was conservative. RESULTS: Sixty-seven knees were included (55 male, 11 female; mean age: 37 years). Fifteen patients (25. 4 %) had bicruciate lesion, and 44 (74. 6 %) knee dislocation. Mean trauma-to-reduction interval was 3 hrs 50 min. Only one of the nine cases of popliteal artery lesion exhibited discernible distal pulse wave. Only three of these patients underwent vascular surgical repair. Twelve knees (five bicruciate lesions, seven dislocations) had isolated common peroneal nerve damage. DISCUSSION: This prospective study detailed the epidemiology and treatment of the lesions encountered, with the option of PCL and peripheral ligament reconstruction. The results, however, still require long-term analysis...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the benefit of}} arterialisation of the portal vein {{in conjunction with a}} therapeutic end-to-side portocaval shunt, a prospective randomised study, was started in december 1979 comparing these two techniques in Child A and B cirrhotic patients with a hepatopedal portal flow of at least 100 ml per min. Sixty-four patients were included in the study: 33 were submitted to portocaval shunt (NART) and 31 were arterialised (ART). The two groups of patients were similar for clinical and haemodynamic parameters. Arterialisation lowered the operative mortality for the whole group (ART: 6. 5 %, NART: 12 %) and in high risk patients; Child class B patients (ART: 0 %, NART: 22 %) and emergency operation (ART: 0 %, NART: 17 %) but the difference is not statistically significant. Postoperative ascites was more frequent in arterialised patients (ART: 45 %, NART: 18 %; p = 0. 02), with an increased need for reoperation (ART: 26 %, NART: 6 %; p < 0, 05). The mean follow-up time was 56, 9 +/- 28, 1 months (SD) for the 58 surviving patients. The five-year actuarial survival rate was 68 % for ART patients and 60, 6 % for NART patients (NS). In Child B patients the five-year actuarial survival rate was 75 % in ART patients and 22 % in NART patients (p < 0, 05). Actuarial estimation of arterialisation patency - proved by <b>angioscan</b> - was 38 % at five years. There {{was no significant difference in}} postoperative and long-term encephalopathy and liver function. In conclusion, arterialisation of the portal vein in conjunction with a therapeutic end-to side portocaval shunt improved survival in high risk patients (Child class B), without increasing operative mortality, with a higher incidence of postoperative ascites and without a decrease in the incidence of long-term encephalopathy...|$|E
