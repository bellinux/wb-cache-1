This study compares the survey-based regional input-output coefficients and production multipliers published by Statistics Finland, 2000, with estimates obtained by applying location quotients (LQs) to national data. The consequences of using alternative <b>adjustment</b> <b>formulae,</b> the 'SLQ, CILQ and FLQ' are illustrated by an input-output model constructed for the Keski-Pohjanmaa (K-P) region. The results indicate that the SLQ and CILQ both produce highly misleading regional input-output coefficients and multipliers. These <b>adjustment</b> <b>formulae</b> are clearly not good enough for the purposes of making local policy and regional planning. The FLQ formula (β= 1) yields much better regional input-output coefficients and multipliers than the SLQ and CILQ. The FLQ gives very good estimates for regional multipliers in nearly all industries. The difference between the multipliers generated by the FLQ and the survey-based K-P regional multipliers is on average about - 0 · 3 %. The multipliers for the K-P region are typically much lower than for Finland as a whole, indicating that the economic structure of the K-P region is dependent on that of other regions. Hence {{there is a need to}} make proper allowance for interregional trade. In the case of the K-P region, the FLQ with β= 1 was able to offset the tendency of the CILQ to generate excessively large regional multipliers.

Since the late 1980 s, in Germany a series of public pension reforms, all initiated in view of imminent population aging, have happened. In this paper it is looked into the process and content of reforms legislated between 1989 and 2001 {{in order to understand}} the nature of change and its driving forces. The main question to be answered is whether these single reform steps eventually amounted to a “path departure”. Despite the reforms the public pension scheme will continue to be the central component of retirement income for the next decades to come, and traditional features of that social insurance program remained intact. However, it can no longer be regarded as a coherent and undisputed policy paradigm: pension politics has become increasingly conflictuous, and the scope of policy-making has widened from public pension policy (parametric reforms concerning a tighter contribution-benefit link, prolonged working life, <b>adjustment</b> <b>formulae</b> etc.) to retirement income policy.

The rationale of this arrangement is to stimulate the sickness funds to improve efficiency in health care production and to respond to consumers' preferences. To achieve solidarity, all five countries have implemented a system of risk-adjusted premium subsidies (or risk equalization across risk groups), along with strict regulation of the consumers' direct premium contribution to their sickness fund. In this article we present a conceptual framework for understanding risk adjustment and comparing the systems in the five countries.

40|$|The QT {{interval}} is {{a representation}} of the cardiac ventricular repolarization process on the electrocardiogram. QT interval varies as a function of age, sex, heart rate, genetic variation and cardiac and non-cardiac drugs. Some individuals may have "normal" QT intervals, but are more susceptible to cardiac arrhythmias, potentially caused by genetic factors underlying QT variability in the general population. A twin study was conducted in which the genetic and environmental influences on QT and corrected QT interval were compared, based on different <b>adjustment</b> <b>formulae.</b> The current report provided evidence that corrected QT interval heritability estimates depend on the specific correction formula applied, as well as that approximately a quarter of the uncorrected QT interval heritability is due to genes specific to QT interval, while the remainder is shared with genes for heart rate.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To measure {{changes in}} {{socioeconomic}} inequality {{in the distribution}} of family physicians (general practitioners (GPs)) relative to need in England from 2004 / 2005 to 2013 / 2014. DESIGN: Whole-population small area longitudinal data linkage study. SETTING: England from 2004 / 2005 to 2013 / 2014. PARTICIPANTS: 32   482 lower layer super output areas (neighbourhoods of 1500 people on average). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Slope index of inequality (SII) between the most and least deprived small areas in annual full-time equivalent GPs (FTE GPs) per 100   000 need adjusted population. RESULTS: In 2004 / 2005, inequality in primary care supply as measured by the SII in FTE GPs was 4. 2 (95 % CI 3. 1 to 5. 3) GPs per 100   000. By 2013 / 2014, this SII had fallen to - 0. 7 (95 % CI - 2. 5 to 1. 1) GPs per 100   000. The number of FTE GPs per 100   000 serving the most deprived fifth of small areas increased over this period from 54. 0 to 60. 5, while increasing from 57. 2 to 59. 9 in the least deprived fifth, so {{that by the end of}} the study period there were more GPs per 100   000 need adjusted population in the most deprived areas than in the least deprived. The increase in GP supply in the most deprived fifth of neighbourhoods was larger in areas that received targeted investment for establishing new practices under the 'Equitable Access to Primary Medical Care'. CONCLUSIONS: There was a substantial reduction in socioeconomic inequality in family physician supply associated with national policy. This policy may not have completely eliminated socioeconomic inequality in family physician supply since existing need <b>adjustment</b> <b>formulae</b> do not fully capture the additional burden of multimorbidity in deprived neighbourhoods. The small area approach introduced in this study can be used routinely to monitor socioeconomic inequality of access to primary care and to indicate workforce shortages in particular neighbourhoods.

Depressive symptoms adversely affect rehabilitation and significantly increase risk of death in the post-stroke period. One of the theoretical views on the determinants of PSD focuses on psychosocial factors like disability and social support. Others emphasize biologic mechanisms such as disruption of biogenic amine neurotransmission and release of proinflammatory cytokines. The "lesion location" perspective attempts to establish a relationship between localization of stroke and occurrence of depression, but empirical results remain contradictory. These divergences are partly related to the fact that neuroimaging methods, unlike neuropathology, are not able to assess precisely the full extent of stroke-affected areas and do not specify the different types of vascular lesions. We provide here an overview of the known phenomenological profile and current pathogenic hypotheses of PSD and present neuropathological data challenging the classic "single-stroke"-based neuroanatomical model of PSD. We suggest that vascular burden due to the chronic accumulation of small macrovascular and microvascular lesions may be a crucial determinant of the development and evolution of PSD...|$|E

To establish {{whether there is}} a relation between poverty and use of inpatient services. To devise a risk <b>adjustment</b> <b>formula</b> for distributing public funds for hospital services using, as far as possible, variables that can be updated between censuses. DESIGN: Cross sectional analysis. Spatial interactive modelling was used to quantify the proximity of the population to health service facilities. Two stage weighted least squares regression was used to model use against supply of hospital and community services and a wide range of potential needs drivers including health, socioeconomic census variables, uptake of income support and family credit, and religious denomination. SETTING: Northern Ireland. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Intensity of use of inpatient services. RESULTS: After endogeneity of supply and use was taken into account, a statistical model was produced that predicted use based on five variables: income support, family credit, elderly people living alone, all ages standardised mortality ratio, and low birth weight. The main effect of the formula produced is to move resources from urban to rural areas.
