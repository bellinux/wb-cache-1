Over a 2 -year period we {{investigated}} the predictive role of neuropsychological and behavioural variables on the cognitive <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> decline of 43 patients with AD. Slow and fast decliners were defined {{on the basis}} of cognitive <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> indexes of disease progression. We found that cognitive decline was predicted by diffuse cognitive impairment <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> progression by visuospatial deficits.

40|$|Regional volume atrophy <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> {{degeneration}} are key imaging {{hallmarks of}} Alzheimer's disease (AD) in structural <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI), respectively. We jointly explored regional volume atrophy <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> connectivity to better characterize neuroimaging data of AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). All data {{were obtained from the}} Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We compared regional volume atrophy <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> connectivity in 10 subcortical regions using structural MRI <b>and</b> resting-state <b>functional</b> MRI (rs-fMRI). Neuroimaging data of normal controls (NC) (n = 35), MCI (n = 40), and AD (n = 30) were compared. Significant differences of regional volumes <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> connectivity measures between groups were assessed using permutation tests in 10 regions. The regional volume atrophy <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> connectivity of identified regions were used as features for the random forest classifier to distinguish among three groups. The features of the identified regions were also regarded as connectional fingerprints that could distinctively separate a given group from the others. We identified a few regions with distinctive regional atrophy <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> connectivity patterns for NC, MCI, and AD groups. A three label classifier using the information of regional volume atrophy <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> connectivity of identified regions achieved classification accuracy of 53. 33 % to distinguish among NC, MCI, and AD.

40|$|Objectives The aims of {{this study}} were: (1) {{investigate}} relations between pain acceptance, depressive symptoms, catastrophizing, <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> disability in pediatric patients in an interdisciplinary chronic pain rehabilitation program, (2) examine changes in acceptance from pre- to posttreatment, and (3) test if changes in acceptance predict changes in depressive symptoms, catastrophizing, <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> disability from pre-to posttreatment. Methods 112 participants, ages 11 – 18 years, completed the Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire, Adolescent Version, Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression-Children’s Scale, Pain Catastrophizing Scale for Children, <b>and</b> <b>Functional</b> Disability Inventory on admission to and completion of the program. Results Significant and strong relations between acceptance, depression, catastrophizing, <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> disability were demonstrated. Participants demonstrated significant increases in acceptance and de-creases in depression, catastrophizing, <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> disability. Finally, changes in acceptance significantly predicted changes in depressive symptoms, catastrophizing, <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> disability.

40|$|The {{nature of}} the {{relationship}} between structure and function is a fundamental question in neuroscience, especially at the macroscopic neuroimaging level. Although mounting studies have revealed that functional connectivity reflects structural connectivity, whether similar structural <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> connectivity patterns can reveal corresponding similarities in the structural <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> topography remains an open problem. In our current study, we used the right inferior parietal lobule (RIPL), which has been demonstrated to have similar anatomical <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> connectivity patterns at the subregional level, to directly test the hypothesis that similar structural <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> connectivity patterns can inform the corresponding topography of this area. In addition, since the association between the RIPL regions and particular functions and networks is still largely unknown, post-hoc <b>functional</b> characterizations <b>and</b> connectivity analyses were performed to identify the main functions and cortical networks in which each subregion participated. Anatomical <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> connectivity-based parcellations of the RIPL have consistently identified five subregions. Our functional characterization using meta-analysis-based behavioral and connectivity analyses revealed that the two anterior subregions (Cl 1 and Cl 2) primarily participate in interoception and execution, respectively; whereas the posterior subregion (Cl 3) in the SMG primarily participates in attention and action inhibition. The two posterior subregions (Cl 4, Cl 5) in the AG were primarily involved in social cognition and spatial cognition, respectively. These results indicated that similar anatomical <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> connectivity patterns of the RIPL are reflected in corresponding structural <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> topographies. The identified cortical connectivity <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> characterization of each subregion may facilitate RIPL-related clinical research. Hum Brain Mapp 37 : 4316 – 4332, 2016...|$|R

40|$|It {{has become}} {{apparent}} that gut microbiota is {{closely associated with}} cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs), and alteration in microbiome compositions is also linked to the host environment. Next generation sequencing (NGS) has facilitated in-depth studies {{on the effects of}} herbal medicine <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> food on gut microbiota. Both herbal medicine <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> food contain fiber, polyphenols and polysaccharides, exerting prebiotics-like activities in the prevention and treatment of CMDs. The administrations of herbal medicine <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> food lead to increased the abundance of phylum Bacteroidetes, and genus Akkermansia, Bifidobacteria, Lactobacillus, Bacteroides and Prevotella, while reducing phylum Firmicutes and Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in gut. Both herbal medicine <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> food interact with gut microbiome and alter the microbial metabolites including short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), bile acids (BAs) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS), which are now correlated with metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T 2 D), obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In addition, trimethylamine (TMA) -N-oxide (TMAO) is recently linked to atherosclerosis (AS) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks. Moreover, gut-organs axes may serve as the potential strategy for treating CMDs with the intervention of herbal medicine <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> food. In summary, a balance between herbal medicine <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> food rich in fiber, polyphenols and polysaccharides plays a vital role in modulating gut microbiota (phylum Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, and genus Akkermansia, Bifidobacteria, Lactobacillus, Bacteroides and Prevotella) through SCFAs, BAs, LPS and TMAO signaling regarding CMDs. Targeting gut-organs axes may serve as a new therapeutic strategy for CMDs by herbal medicine <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> food in the future. This review aims to summarize the balance between herbal medicine <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> food utilized for the prevention and treatment of CMDs through modulating gut microbiota...|$|R

40|$|Human {{brain is}} {{structurally}} and functionally asymmetrical and the asymmetries of brain phenotypes {{have been shown}} to change in normal aging. Recent advances in graph theoretical analysis have showed topological lateralization between hemispheric networks in the human brain throughout the lifespan. Nevertheless, apparent discrepancies of hemispheric asymmetry were reported between the structural <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> brain networks, indicating the potentially complex asymmetry patterns between structural <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> networks in aging population. In this study, using multimodal neuroimaging (resting-state fMRI and structural diffusion tensor imaging), we investigated the characteristics of hemispheric network topology in 76 (male/female = 15 / 61, age = 70. 08 ± 5. 30 years) community-dwelling older adults. Hemispheric <b>functional</b> <b>and</b> structural brain networks were obtained for each participant. Graph theoretical approaches were then employed to estimate the hemispheric topological properties. We found that the optimal small-world properties were preserved in both structural <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> hemispheric networks in older adults. Moreover, a leftward asymmetry in both global and local levels were observed in structural brain networks in comparison with a symmetric pattern in functional brain network, suggesting a dissociable process of hemispheric asymmetry between structural <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> connectome in healthy older adults. Finally, the scores of hemispheric asymmetry in both structural <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> networks were associated with behavioral performance in various cognitive domains. Taken together, these findings provide new insights into the lateralized nature of multimodal brain connectivity, highlight the potentially complex relationship between structural <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> brain network alterations, and augment our understanding of asymmetric structural <b>and</b> <b>functional</b> specializations in normal aging...|$|R
