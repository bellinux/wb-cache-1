5|$|During that month, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad {{indicated}} {{his intentions}} {{of going to}} war against Israel. Egypt and Syria agreed to coordinate military action via negotiations, and the respective Ministers of War formulated a common military strategy. Egypt enlisted the political support of several more Arab countries, some producers of oil. Sadat discussed {{the possibility of using}} oil as an economic weapon to pressure Western governments into adopting more pro-Arab policies. During the war, oil-producing <b>Arab</b> <b>nations,</b> primarily Libya and Saudi Arabia, initiated an oil embargo, and several sent token forces to the front lines.|$|E
5|$|The Republic of China (Taiwan) was {{expelled}} from the Games after the decision made in the Asian Games Federation's conference held on November 16, 1973, to allow the entry of the People's Republic of China. Mongolia and North Korea also entered the Games for the first time. Athletes from the <b>Arab</b> <b>nations,</b> Pakistan, China and North Korea refused to face Israel in tennis, fencing, basketball and football events, due to political reasons.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the Six Day War, Israel {{held the}} entire Sinai peninsula, with the {{exception}} of Port Fouad. Israel's victory in the Six Day War brought about a sense of security within Israel; the occupied territory added strategic depth to the country's defense. Consequently, Israel and Egypt ignored United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 242, which called for withdrawal from occupied territories in return for Arab recognition, and negotiations between the countries ceased. Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir aimed {{to maintain the status quo}} and believed that her country's military strength would secure peace with <b>Arab</b> <b>nations</b> on their terms. Egypt, on the other hand, refused to recognize Israel or even negotiate with directly, preferring talks via third parties.|$|E
25|$|Since {{colonialism}} is, in all {{its forms}} and manifestations, incompatible with the dignity and paramount aims of the <b>Arab</b> <b>nation,</b> the <b>Arab</b> <b>nation</b> rejects it and will resist it with all the means at its disposal.|$|R
2500|$|... {{that the}} <b>Arab</b> <b>nation</b> is a {{permanent}} entity in history. The <b>Arab</b> <b>nation</b> is considered, philosophically speaking, not as a social and economic formation, but as a transcendent fact inspiring different forms, one of its highest contributions taking the form of Islam. It was not Islam that modeled the peoples of Arabia, the Fertile Crescent, and North Africa, equipping them with Islamic values, especially the Arabic language and the Arabic culture, but the <b>Arab</b> <b>nation</b> which created Islam. This conception of the <b>Arab</b> <b>nation</b> implicitly advantages the Arab contribution to history. On the other hand, Arab decadence [...] can be overcome through a purifying and spiritual action, not religious but moral." ...|$|R
25|$|Al-Arsuzi's central {{thought was}} the {{unification}} of the <b>Arab</b> <b>Nation.</b> He believed that the <b>Arab</b> <b>Nation</b> could trace its roots to the pre-Islamic and early Islamic period of Arab history. The historical link to an <b>Arab</b> <b>Nation</b> {{was more important to}} al-Arsuzi than it was to other Arab nationalists and Ba'athists. The only way to create a new <b>Arab</b> <b>Nation</b> in the Modern Age was to reestablish a link between the Arab people of the past and those of the present through language—the only true remnant of the old Arab identity. In short, language was the key to regain what had been lost (the <b>Arab</b> <b>Nation)</b> and reinvigorate the Arab identity. Al-Arsuzi believed that the Arabs lost their common identity when they allowed non–Arabs to participate in government. The result was that several laws had non-Arab characteristics—these laws, and other changes brought by non-Arabs, weakened Arab identity.|$|R
5|$|Jordan {{is a key}} ally of the USA and UK and, {{together}} with Egypt, {{is one of only}} two <b>Arab</b> <b>nations</b> to have signed peace treaties with Israel, Jordan's direct neighbour. Jordan views an independent Palestinian state with the 1967 borders, as part of the two-state solution and of supreme national interest. The ruling Hashemite dynasty has had custodianship over holy sites in Jerusalem since 1924, a position re-inforced in the Israel–Jordan peace treaty. Turmoil in Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque between Israelis and Palestinians created tensions between Jordan and Israel concerning the former's role in protecting the Muslim and Christian sites in Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|On October 6, 1973, an Arab {{coalition}} led by Egypt and Syria, supported {{with arms}} and materiel by the Soviet Union, attacked Israel in the Yom Kippur War. Israel suffered heavy losses and Nixon ordered an airlift to resupply Israeli losses, cutting through inter-departmental squabbles and bureaucracy and taking {{personal responsibility for}} any response by <b>Arab</b> <b>nations.</b> More than a week later, {{by the time the}} U.S. and Soviet Union began negotiating a truce, Israel had penetrated deep into enemy territory. The truce negotiations rapidly escalated into a superpower crisis; when Israel gained the upper hand, Egyptian President Sadat requested a joint U.S.-USSR peacekeeping mission, which the U.S. refused. When Soviet Premier Brezhnev threatened to unilaterally enforce any peacekeeping mission militarily, Nixon ordered the U.S. military to DEFCON3, placing all U.S. military personnel and bases on alert for nuclear war. This was the closest that the world had come to nuclear war since the Cuban Missile Crisis. Brezhnev backed down as a result of Nixon's actions.|$|E
5|$|Between 1964 and 1975, both Britain and France {{delivered}} significant {{quantities of}} arms, including Hunters, to Iraq. The Hunters {{were far more}} effective in fighting guerrilla activity than the Russian MiG-17s then operated by Iraq. In 1967, Hunters of the Iraqi Air Force saw action after the Six-Day War between Israel and several neighbouring <b>Arab</b> <b>nations.</b> During the War of Attrition Iraqi Hunters usually operated from bases in Egypt and Syria. While flying a Hunter from Iraqi Airbase H3, Flight Lieutenant Saiful Azam, on exchange from the Pakistan Air Force, shot down three Israeli jets including a Sud Aviation Vautour and a Mirage IIICJ. Some missions were also flown by the Royal Jordanian Air Force, {{but most of the}} Jordanian Hunters were destroyed on the ground {{on the first day of}} the Six-Day War. Replacement Hunters for Jordanian service were acquired from both Britain and Saudi Arabia in the war's aftermath. These were used with considerable success in ground attacks against Syrian Army tanks during the Black September Crisis.|$|E

5|$|However, there {{remained}} {{too many}} signs for the Israelis to ignore, chief among {{which was the}} hasty Soviet evacuation from Cairo and Damascus, and the constant buildup of forces on the Syrian front when Egypt, it was assumed, would not enter war. Though the Chief of Staff, David Elazar, was assured that the probability of war remained low, he took precautionary steps on October 5. Elazar placed the entire military on alert, canceled all leaves, and ordered the Air Force to assume a full-alert posture. He also ordered the 7th Armored Brigade to relocate from the Sinai to the Golan Heights. This raised Israeli numbers in the Golan Heights to 177 tanks and 44 artillery pieces on October 6. To replace the 7th Armored Brigade, the Armor School, {{under the command of}} Colonel Gabi Amir, was ordered to activate its tank brigade for immediate airlift; it was in the Sinai by October 6, before the war began. Ultimately though, no orders for mobilization were issued to reservists; Elazar and other senior commanders still expected a 24- to 48-hour warning from the intelligence services if the <b>Arab</b> <b>nations</b> were bent on war.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{proceedings}} of the Parliament of Australia, Parliament of Canada, Parliament of the United Kingdom (usually Prime Minister's Questions and the State Opening of Parliament) and other governments are shown on C-SPAN when they discuss matters of importance to viewers in the U.S. Similarly, the networks will sometimes broadcast news reports {{from around the world}} when major events occur – for instance, C-SPAN broadcast CBC Television coverage of the September 11 attacks. C-SPAN also covers lying in state in the Capitol Rotunda and funerals of former presidents and other notable individuals. In 2005, C-SPAN covered Hurricane Katrina through NBC affiliate WDSU in New Orleans, as well as coverage of Hurricane Ike via CBS affiliate KHOU in Houston. C-SPAN also carries CBC coverage during events that affect Canadians, such as the Canadian federal elections, the death and state funeral of Pierre Trudeau, and the 2003 North America blackout. During early 2011, C-SPAN carried broadcasts by Al Jazeera to cover the events in Egypt, Tunisia, and other <b>Arab</b> <b>nations.</b> Additionally, C-SPAN simulcasts NASA Space Shuttle mission launches and landings live, using video footage and audio sourced from NASA TV.|$|E

50|$|A major {{obstacle}} {{to the success of}} the revolution is the Arab League. Aflaq believed that the Arab League strengthened both regional interests and the reactionary classes, thus weakening the chance of establishing an <b>Arab</b> <b>nation.</b> Because of the world situation, where the majority of Arab states were under the rule of the reactionary classes, Aflaq revised his ideology to meet reality. Instead of creating an <b>Arab</b> <b>nation</b> through an Arab-wide progressive revolution, the main task would be of progressive revolutionaries spreading the revolution from one Arab country to the next. Once successfully transformed, the thus created progressive revolutionary countries would then one by one unite until the Arab world had evolved into a single <b>Arab</b> <b>nation.</b> The revolution would not succeed if the progressive revolutionary governments did not contribute to spreading the revolution.|$|R
2500|$|Within the Arab {{nationalist}} movement are three differentiations: the <b>Arab</b> <b>nation,</b> <b>Arab</b> nationalism, and pan-Arab unity. 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, {{a founder of}} the Arab nationalist Ba'ath Party, claims the nation is the group of people who speak Arabic, inhabit the Arab world, and who have a feeling of belonging to the same nation. Nationalism is the [...] "sum total" [...] of the characteristics and qualities exclusive to the <b>Arab</b> <b>nation,</b> whereas pan-Arab unity is the modern idea which stipulates that the separate Arab countries should unify to form a single state under one political system.|$|R

25|$|Ze'evi later {{advocated}} the population transfer by agreement of 3.3 million {{residents of the}} West Bank and Gaza to <b>Arab</b> <b>nations.</b> He believed this could be accomplished by making life difficult, so they would relocate on their own, through {{use of military force}} during wartime, or by agreement with <b>Arab</b> <b>nations.</b> In July 1987, Ze'evi presented his ideas at a forum in Tel Aviv, describing the plan as a voluntary transfer {{and the only way to}} make peace with the Arabs.

2500|$|Arab nationalists {{believe that}} the <b>Arab</b> <b>nation</b> existed as a {{historical}} entity prior {{to the rise of}} nationalism in the 19th–20th century.

Thus, it rejected [...] "Palestinization" [...] of the conflict with Israel, insisting on the necessary involvement of the greater <b>Arab</b> <b>nation.</b> This occasionally went to extremes, with as-Sa'iqa leaders denying the existence of a separate Palestinian people within the wider <b>Arab</b> <b>nation</b> (quote).|$|R
