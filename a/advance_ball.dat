40|$|Objectives Cricket batting is {{performed}} under demanding constraints, which requires rapid and accurate decision making for successful {{achievement of the}} skill goal. To understand how batsmen negotiate these constraints, the capability of highly skilled and low skilled cricket batsmen to utilise visual information prior to and during sections of ball flight to strike balls delivered by fast bowlers was examined. Method Six highly skilled and six low skilled batsmen faced different types of balls delivered by three fast bowlers. Batsmen wore vision occlusion spectacles and were required to strike delivered balls, while their vision of the bowler's delivery action and ball flight was selectively occluded. Three vision conditions were randomly designed that included temporal occlusion at: (i) a point prior to ball release (providing only advance information), (ii) a point prior to ball bounce (providing advance and ball flight information) and (iii) no occlusion (where all <b>advance,</b> <b>ball</b> flight and bounce information were visible). Foot movements made forward or backward were assessed {{as a measure of}} ball length judgement, while the quality of bat–ball contact was assessed as a measure of interception. Results Results demonstrated the superior capability of highly skilled batsmen to utilise information prior to ball release to judge short ball length. Expert batsmen were better able to utilise ball flight information prior to and post-bounce to attain a superior number of bat–ball contacts. Conclusions Findings demonstrate that the mechanism of experts to deal with task constraints when attempting to intercept a delivered ball is their capability to pick-up visual information to judge ball landing position...|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} types of golf balls on the market, and {{customers}} often face a difficult decision. Golf balls are divided into two categories: recreational and <b>advanced</b> <b>balls.</b> Recreational balls are oriented toward the ordinary golfer, who generally have low swing speeds (80 mph or lower) and lose golf balls on the course easily. These balls are made of two layers, with the cover firmer than the core. Their low compression and side spin reduction characteristics suit the lower swing speeds of average golfers quite well. Furthermore, they generally have lower prices than the <b>advanced</b> <b>balls,</b> lessening the financial impact of losing a ball to a hazard or out of bounds.|$|R

[...] In men's college basketball, the offense must <b>advance</b> the <b>ball</b> to the front court within 10 seconds, the same length used by FIBA and the NBA until they adopted an 8-second limit in 2000 and 2001, respectively.

50|$|In American football, {{the offense}} is the side {{in which the}} players have {{possession}} of the ball. It is their job to <b>advance</b> the <b>ball</b> towards the opponent's end zone to score points. Broadly speaking, the eleven players of the offense are broken into two groups: the five offensive linemen, whose primary job is to block, and the six backs and receivers whose primary job is to <b>advance</b> the <b>ball</b> either running with the ball or passing it. The backs and receivers are also commonly known as skill position players or as eligible receivers (or eligible ball carriers). Offensive linemen are not usually eligible to <b>advance</b> the <b>ball</b> past {{the line of scrimmage}} during a play.|$|R

50|$|The {{offensive}} team begins their possession at the five-yard line, and {{has three}} plays to gain 20 yards and <b>advance</b> the <b>ball</b> beyond mid-field. After they <b>advance</b> the <b>ball</b> past mid-field, the offense has three additional plays {{to put the}} ball into the end-zone. If a team scores a Touchdown (six points), they have the option of attempting either a one-point conversion (from five yards) or a two-point conversion (from twelve yards).|$|R
50|$|The term lateral {{describes}} a short toss from one back to another {{that does not}} <b>advance</b> the <b>ball.</b> (see lateral pass) A ball that goes forward to another player is called a forward pass.

This allows skilled players to use just enough motion to perform <b>advanced</b> <b>ball</b> saves without triggering the tilt mechanism, just as can be done on a physical machine.|$|R

The Hokies were forced to punt the ball away, and Kansas {{recovered the}} kick at its 41-yard line. With good field position and momentum granted by the interception and field goal, Kansas moved the ball quickly. Todd Reesing was sacked by Nekos Brown and Xavier Adibi, but connected to Jake Sharp for 20yards on twopasses, <b>advancing</b> the <b>ball</b> deep into Virginia Tech territory. Passes to Marcus Henry and Dezmon Briscoe advanced Kansas 21more yards into Hokie territory, and Brandon McAnderson rushed for fiveyards on the ground. Capping the Kansas drive was a 13-yard toss by Reesing to Henry for a touchdown. The score, which came with 7:03 remaining in the first half, gave Kansas a 170 lead, its largest of the game.|$|R

50|$|A team {{may still}} lose {{possession}} after a fumble {{out of bounds}} if the fumble occurred on fourth down (third down in Canadian play) and the ball becomes dead short of the line to gain. Because of plays like the Holy Roller, the NFL changed its rule regarding <b>advancing</b> a fumbled <b>ball</b> on offense. If the offensive team fumbles {{in the last two}} minutes of either half, or on fourth down at any time, only the player who fumbled is allowed to <b>advance</b> the <b>ball</b> past the point of the fumble. If any other offensive player <b>advances</b> the <b>ball</b> toward the opponent's goal line, the ball is moved back to the spot of the fumble, and the defensive team gains possession on downs unless the fumble occurred after the offensive team reached the line to gain.|$|R

50|$|When the {{offensive}} team <b>advances</b> the <b>ball</b> by rushing the football, {{the player who}} carries the ball is given credit for the net gain, measured in rushing yards. When {{the offensive}} team <b>advances</b> the <b>ball</b> by pass reception, the player who throws the ball earns passing yards and the player who receives the ball earns receiving yards. The total of rushing yards and passing yards (but not receiving yards) is known as total offense. Although the ball may also be advanced by penalty, these yards do not contribute to total offense. Progress lost via quarterback sacks are classified differently, depending upon the league and/or level of football.|$|R
