5000|$|Back in Nigeria, Teju Oyeleye {{jumped into}} {{a much bigger}} project. The Western Nigerian Television Station hired him in September 1959 as a Development Engineer. This was the first {{television}} station in Africa which meant {{a lot of things}} were required of the company. First, the company needed to provide television service to the general public. They would then have to broadcast channels for the consumers to watch. This required a lot of professionals, many of whom were being called back from their dwellings in England, to come over and establish this new television station in Nigeria. Teju Oyeleye was one of the engineers chosen to fulfill the demand. The television station grew rapidly since Teju's arrival. The shows started in black and white with shows only airing from four o'clock in the afternoon to midnight. The shows that aired included live programs, recorded programs, movies, interviews, outside broadcasts and the radio broadcasting he was <b>also</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>with</b> included the morning news, jingles, and talk shows. Color television arrived in 1975, a few years after the time Teju Oyeleye moved to his next professional challenge Total Nigeria Limited. As West Nigerian Television and Broadcasting Services (WNTV-WNBS) developed and expanded from one city to the entire continent around the time of Teju's arrival, so did Teju's role in the company become much more integral to the company's success. Teju experienced a series of promotions from his initial program as Development Manager to his position as Chief Engineer, and eventually general manager in 1966 which was the equivalent of chief executive officer in North American companies. He was the first Nigerian general manager of the first television station in Africa. Teju's management style was [...] "collaborative in nature and his direct reports were given significant responsibility as well as the accountability that went along with it". In other words, he encouraged his employees and himself to work with each other to get most tasks done and his workers were responsible for the work they were assigned. He would often set goals for his workers and use simple data analysis to measure how close they came to accomplishing these goals.|$|E

For example, journalists were prosecuted by Tunisia’s press code, which bans offending the president, disturbing order, and publishing what the government perceives as false news. The government also restricted the media by controlling the registration of print media and licensing of broadcasters, refusing permission to critical outlets, and controlling the distribution public sector advertisement. Journalists are <b>also</b> <b>charged</b> <b>in</b> courts <b>with</b> vague violations of the penal code.|$|R
