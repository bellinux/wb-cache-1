A new stadium was {{proposed}} to be located at the waterfront at Reknes. There were many local protests, including complaints <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the structure.

5|$|<b>About</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> a rabbit, the tammar {{is among}} the {{smallest}} of the wallabies in the genus Macropus. Its coat colour is largely grey. The tammar has several notable adaptations, including the ability to retain energy while hopping, colour vision and the ability to drink seawater. A nocturnal species, it spends nighttime in grassland habitat and daytime in shrubland. It is also very gregarious and has a seasonal, promiscuous mating pattern. A female tammar can nurse a joey in her pouch while keeping an embryo in her uterus. The tammar is a model species for research on marsupials, and on mammals in general. It is one of many organisms to have had its genome sequenced.|$|E

5|$|Another Tyrannosaurus, nicknamed Stan, {{in honor}} of amateur {{paleontologist}} Stan Sacrison, {{was found in the}} Hell Creek Formation near Buffalo, South Dakota, in the spring of 1987. It was not collected until 1992, as it was mistakenly thought to be a Triceratops skeleton. Stan is 63% complete and is on display in the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research in Hill City, South Dakota, after an extensive world tour during 1995 and 1996. This tyrannosaur, too, was found to have many bone pathologies, including broken and healed ribs, a broken (and healed) neck and a spectacular hole in the back of its head, <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> a Tyrannosaurus tooth.|$|E
5|$|As a star's core shrinks, the {{intensity}} of radiation from that surface increases, creating such radiation pressure on the outer shell of gas that it will push those layers away, forming a planetary nebula. If what remains after the outer atmosphere has been shed is less than 1.4 , it shrinks to a relatively tiny object <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> Earth, known as a white dwarf. White dwarfs lack the mass for further gravitational compression to take place. The electron-degenerate matter inside a white dwarf {{is no longer a}} plasma, even though stars are generally referred to as being spheres of plasma. Eventually, white dwarfs fade into black dwarfs over a very long period of time.|$|E
5|$|By 2009 {{some of the}} {{conditions}} required for a currency war had returned, with a severe economic downturn seeing global trade in that year decline by about 12%. There was a widespread concern among advanced economies <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> their deficits; they increasingly joined emerging economies in viewing export led growth as their ideal strategy. In March 2009, even before international co-operation reached its peak with the 2009 G-20 London Summit , economist Ted Truman {{became one of the}} first to warn of the dangers of competitive devaluation.

5|$|By {{the early}} 1850s, the large cent (<b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> a half dollar) being {{issued by the}} Mint was {{becoming}} both unpopular in commerce and expensive to coin. After experimenting with various sizes and compositions, the Mint decided on an alloy of 88% copper and 12% nickel for a new, smaller cent. After the Mint produced patterns with an 1856 date and gave them to legislators and officials, Congress formally authorized the new piece in February 1857.|$|E
5|$|Considerable debate exists <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> {{the rebound}} in energy {{efficiency}} and {{the relevance of the}} Jevons paradox to energy conservation. Some dismiss the paradox, while others worry that it may be self-defeating to pursue sustainability by increasing energy efficiency. Environmental economists have proposed that efficiency gains be coupled with conservation policies that keep the cost of use the same (or higher) to avoid the Jevons paradox. Conservation policies (such as cap and trade) do not display the paradox, and can be used to control the rebound effect.|$|E
5|$|Crickets are hemimetabolic insects, whose {{lifecycle}} {{consists of}} an egg stage, a larval or nymph stage that increasingly resembles the adult form as the nymph grows, and an adult stage. The egg hatches into a nymph <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> a fruit fly. This passes through about 10 larval stages, and with each successive moult, it becomes more like an adult. After the final moult, the genitalia and wings are fully developed, but a period of maturation is needed before the cricket is ready to breed.|$|E

In fact, it proves only that there is no onto function from the integers to the reals; by itself it says nothing <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> sets. Set <b>size</b> measurement and comparison, like all mathematics, should be chosen to fit the needs of an application domain.

5|$|In this treatise, Archimedes {{counts the}} number of grains of sand that will fit inside the universe. This book {{mentions}} the heliocentric theory {{of the solar system}} proposed by Aristarchus of Samos, as well as contemporary ideas <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the Earth and the distance between various celestial bodies. By using a system of numbers based on powers of the myriad, Archimedes concludes that {{the number of}} grains of sand required to fill the universe is 8 in modern notation. The introductory letter states that Archimedes' father was an astronomer named Phidias. The Sand Reckoner or Psammites is the only surviving work in which Archimedes discusses his views on astronomy.|$|E
5|$|On July 19, 2009, exactly 15 {{years after}} the SL9 impacts, a new black spot <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the Pacific Ocean {{appeared}} in Jupiter's southern hemisphere. Thermal infrared measurements showed the impact site was warm and spectroscopic analysis detected the production of excess hot ammonia and silica-rich dust in the upper regions of Jupiter's atmosphere. Scientists have concluded that another impact event had occurred, but this time a more compact and strong object, probably a small undiscovered asteroid, was the cause.|$|E
5|$|Other {{atmospheric}} observations {{included a}} swirling dark oval of high atmospheric-haze, <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the Great Red Spot, near Jupiter's north pole. Infrared imagery revealed aspects of circulation near the poles, with bands of globe-encircling winds, and adjacent bands moving in opposite directions. The same announcement also discussed {{the nature of}} Jupiter's rings. Light scattering by particles in the rings showed the particles were irregularly shaped (rather than spherical) and likely originated as ejecta from micrometeorite impacts on Jupiter's moons, probably on Metis and Adrastea. On December 19, 2000, the Cassini spacecraft captured a very-low-resolution image of the moon Himalia, {{but it was too}} distant to show any surface details.|$|E

5|$|Permanent brachytherapy, {{also known}} as seed implantation, {{involves}} placing small LDR radioactive seeds or pellets (<b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> a grain of rice) in the tumour or treatment site and leaving them there permanently to gradually decay. Over a period of weeks or months, the level of radiation emitted by the sources will decline to almost zero. The inactive seeds then remain in the treatment site with no lasting effect. Permanent brachytherapy is most commonly used {{in the treatment of}} prostate cancer.|$|E
5|$|The Mint's chief engraver, James B. Longacre, was {{instructed}} to prepare designs for pattern coins. Initially, Longacre worked with Liberty head designs such as were common at the time, but Snowden asked that a flying eagle design be prepared. This occurred as Booth's experiments continued; the first cent patterns with the flying eagle design were <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> a quarter. To promote the new alloy, the Mint had 50 half cents struck in it, and had them sent to Washington for Treasury officials to show to officials and congressmen. In early November 1856, Longacre prepared dies in what {{would prove to be}} the final design, depicting a flying eagle on the obverse and a wreathed denomination on the reverse, in the size sought by Booth.|$|E
5|$|The cent was {{the first}} {{official}} United States coin to be struck at the Philadelphia Mint in 1793. These pieces, today known as large cents, were made of pure copper and were <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> a half dollar. They were struck every year, except 1815 due to a shortage of metal, but were slow to become established in commerce. Worn Spanish colonial silver pieces were then commonly used as money throughout the United States. At the time, both gold and silver were legal tender there, but copper coins were not; {{the federal government would}} not redeem them or take them in payment of taxes.|$|E
