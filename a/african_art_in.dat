Its {{collections}} include 9,000 works of traditional and contemporary African art from both Sub-Saharan and Arab North Africa, 300,000 photographs, and 50,000 library volumes. It was the first institution dedicated to <b>African</b> <b>art</b> <b>in</b> the United States, and remains the largest collection. The Washington Post called the museum a mainstay in the international art world and the main venue for contemporary <b>African</b> <b>art</b> <b>in</b> the United States.|$|E
25|$|The inspirations {{that led}} Csaky to Cubism were diverse, {{as they were}} for artists of the Bateau-Lavoir, on the one hand, or the Puteaux Group on the other. While art historians are divided on the {{influence}} of <b>African</b> <b>art</b> <b>in</b> the distillation of Cubism, they generally agree that Cézanne's geometric syntax was significant, as well as Seurat's approach to painting. Given a growing dissatisfaction with the classical methods of representation, and the contemporary changes—the industrial revolution, exposure to art from across the world—artists began to transform their expression.|$|E
500|$|... 1:54 is {{an annual}} {{contemporary}} African art fair held in London during the October Frieze Week since 2013. It was organized {{to improve the}} representation of contemporary <b>African</b> <b>art</b> <b>in</b> worldwide exhibitions, and is the foremost art fair dedicated to contemporary <b>African</b> <b>art</b> <b>in</b> the primary art market. By 2016, the show had become {{three times the size}} of the original exhibition with 130 artists represented. A spin-off, pop-up show, 1:54 NY, has been held annually in New York City during the May Frieze New York since 2015. Critics have described 1:54 as a highlight of the Frieze event, and wrote that the show's publicity for contemporary African art outweighs the issues of lumping disparate geographic traditions together. The fair's representation from African galleries has improved as the international market for African art expands.|$|E

500|$|The National Museum of African Art was {{the first}} {{institution}} dedicated to <b>African</b> <b>art</b> <b>in</b> the United States, followed by the New York-based Center for African Art (now The African Center) in 1984. The National Museum's collection is larger. As of 2008, it consisted of 9,000 objects and 300,000 photographs. The objects range from 15th-century sculptures and masks to multi-media contemporary art, and the photographs include major contributions from photojournalists Eliot Elisofon and Constance Stuart Larrabee. Elisofon covered major 20th century events for Life, and Larrabee covered World War II and South African life. As of 2004, the museum had 400 contemporary artworks. The museum collects items for both their traditional uses and aesthetic values, and receives an average of 67 gifts annually. The breadth of its collections and special exhibitions made the museum [...] "a solid force in the international art world" [...] and the main venue for contemporary <b>African</b> <b>art</b> <b>in</b> the United States, according to The Washington Post.|$|E
500|$|... 1:54 is a {{contemporary}} African art fair held annually in London, beginning in 2013. As of 2015, 1:54 {{is the only}} art fair dedicated to contemporary <b>African</b> <b>art</b> <b>in</b> the primary art market. Its name refers to the 54 countries that compose the African continent, expressed as a ratio ("one continent: 54 countries"). Moroccan curator Touria El Glaoui, daughter of the artist Hassan El Glaoui, organized the fair to improve the representation of contemporary <b>African</b> <b>art</b> <b>in</b> worldwide art exhibitions. Representation of non-Western countries in the contemporary art world has lagged behind that of other countries. Representation of African countries, in particular, improved alongside the continent's economic growth. El Glaoui said that the continent {{did not have a}} single art scene, and that there was great diversity between African nations. Accordingly, as in the fair's title, 1:54 tries to preserve rather than homogenize the differences between each country's histories and cultures. In starting the fair, its founder was supported and advised by the British Council, the Francophonie, and partners ArtReview, Beaux Art magazine, and Art.sy. For each edition, the 1:54 organizers ask themselves [...] "what is necessary, what can be achieved, how [...] do something different". The fair's organizers choose exhibitors based on proposal submissions and the firms' reputation and plans. Travel visa issues have also affected whether invitees ultimately attend.|$|E
500|$|Musically, Remain in Light {{has been}} {{described}} as featuring new wave, post-punk, worldbeat, dance-rock, and different types of funk, specifically afrofunk and avant-funk. Critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine described the album as a [...] "dense amalgam of African percussion, funk bass and keyboards, pop songs, and electronics." [...] It contains eight songs that possess a [...] "striking free-associative feel" [...] according to psychoanalyst Michael A. Brog, in that there is no long-lasting coherent thought process that can be followed in the stream-of-consciousness lyrics. David Gans instructed Byrne to be freer with his lyrical content by advising him that [...] "rational thinking has its limits". The frontman included a bibliography with the album press kit along with a statement that explained how the album was inspired by African mythologies and rhythms. The release stressed that the major inspiration to the lyrics was Professor John Miller Chernoff's African Rhythm and African Sensibility, which examined the musical enhancement of life in the continent's rural communities. The academic travelled to Ghana in 1970 to study native percussion and wrote about how Africans have complicated conversations through drum patterns. One of the songs, [...] "The Great Curve", exemplifies the African theme by including the line [...] "The world moves on a woman's hips", which Byrne used after reading Professor Robert Farris Thompson's book <b>African</b> <b>Art</b> <b>in</b> Motion. He additionally studied straight speech, from John Dean's Watergate testimony to the stories of African American former slaves.|$|E

2500|$|The Met's mask was {{acquired}} in 1972 {{as a gift}} of Nelson Rockefeller. He founded the Museum of Primitive Art in 1954 after the Metropolitan Museum did not reciprocate his interest in Precolumbian art. The museum collected works for their artistic—and not anthropological—value, contrasting with the earlier history of <b>African</b> <b>art</b> <b>in</b> Western collections. [...] The Queens College art historian Robert Goldwater became its director and recommended acquisitions. His argument to collect the ivory pendant mask was among his longest, {{at the end of}} 1957. He called it [...] "the best object of its kind known, nor will any others ever turn up". Goldwater wrote that the mask was higher in quality than the similar, renowned one owned by the British Museum. The mask, he predicted, would redefine the collection and go on permanent display, on par with the Museum of Modern Art's well-known Sleeping Gypsy (1897) by Henri Rousseau. Rockefeller purchased the mask at a record price and unveiled it in September 1958. The purchase solidified a policy that Goldwater believed the museum should center around permanent collections of masterworks.|$|E
