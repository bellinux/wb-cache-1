5|$|Although the {{essential}} problem of large tribal {{groups on the}} frontier remained much the same <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> Rome faced in earlier centuries, the 3rd century saw a marked increase in the overall threat, although there is disagreement over whether external pressure increased, or Rome's ability to meet it declined. The Carpi and Sarmatians whom Rome had held at bay were replaced by the Goths and likewise the Quadi and Marcomanni that Rome had defeated were replaced by the greater confederation of the Alamanni.|$|E

His plea was supported by President of Turkey Süleyman Demirel when he met Croatian President Franjo Tuđman in the Brijuni Islands the next day.|$|E
5|$|Despite earlier derision, {{a number}} of Militia units went on to perform with {{distinction}} during the Pacific War, especially in 1942, when they fought Japanese forces in New Guinea. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> in the Pacific worsened in July 1942 and the Japanese drove towards Port Moresby, members of the Militia found themselves on the front lines. As reinforcements were brought up from Australia, the Militia units that {{had been sent to}} New Guinea as garrison troops earlier in the war were called upon to fight a stubborn rearguard action on the Kokoda Track to delay the Japanese advance long enough for these reinforcements to arrive. At the same time, the Militia battalions of the 7th Brigade {{played a key role in}} the Battle of Milne Bay, when Australian and United States forces defeated the Japanese in a large-scale battle for the first time during the war.|$|E

At this time, the Army began to rectify the deficiencies in the division's equipment lists and battalions began receiving new machine guns, motor transport and Bren carriers. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> in New Guinea grew worse, {{the decision was made}} to reorganise the 3rd Division and throughout August, four battalions were amalgamated—the 37th, 52nd, 58th and 59th. In September, the 10th Brigade was disbanded and its battalions reallocated to the 4th and 15th Brigades. In October the 29th and 46th Battalions were also amalgamated, leaving the division with just six infantry battalions in two brigades.|$|E

After Cuddy makes a bet to prove House's addiction to Vicodin, House concedes to Wilson {{that he has}} an addiction but says that the addiction is not a problem. It is, in fact, Wilson who usually writes House's Vicodin prescriptions (with Cuddy writing a few merely for leverage in her dealings with House). In Season 3, when Detective Michael Tritter (David Morse) threatens to jail House for his Vicodin addiction after finding a huge stash in his apartment, Wilson {{attempts to}} convince House to go to rehab <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> worsens. After Tritter pressures Wilson to testify several times, Wilson reluctantly agrees, unknown to House. Before this, Wilson watches House punch Dr. Robert Chase, insult Cuddy, and incorrectly diagnose {{a child with a}} condition that would have required the amputation of her left arm and leg.|$|E
5|$|After {{the bloody}} setback at Aspern-Essling, Napoleon took {{six weeks to}} {{carefully}} plan another crossing of the Danube. He launched this operation late on 4 July and, by {{the early hours of}} the next day, he had managed to get a substantial force across the river. Nansouty's division did not see any action during the first day of the Battle at Wagram and at night they camped behind the Imperial Guard. The next day, 6 July, Nansouty was at first directed to support Davout, on the French right, but when it became clear that the latter's sector was not threatened by the arrival of enemy reinforcements, they were ordered back into reserve in a central position on the battlefield, not far from the village of Aderklaa. Then, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> on the French left rapidly deteriorated, they were called into action, when Napoleon ordered Marshal Bessières, commander of the Cavalry Reserve, to launch his men in a charge against the Austrians menacing his left. With time at the essence, Bessières opted not to wait for the Guard cavalry and, with his other two heavy cavalry divisions assigned to other sectors of the battlefield, he decided to lead forward only Nansouty's men. This division was indeed very strong: 24 squadrons, more than 4,000 men, including Brigadier General Defrance's 1st and 2nd carabiniers-à-cheval, Brigadier General Doumerc's 2nd and 9th cuirassiers and Brigadier General Berckheim's 3rd and 12th cuirassiers.|$|E

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> deteriorated, the Brazilian {{government}} mobilized army {{units from}} {{other regions of}} the Empire. On 1 January 1865, one brigade (composed of two infantry battalions and one artillery battalion) with 1,700 men from the Brazilian province of Rio de Janeiro disembarked and occupied the Uruguayan town of Fray Bentos. Paranhos, along with Tamandaré, met Flores in Fray Bentos and decided to launch a combined attack against Montevideo. It was apparent that the Paraguayans would take too long to reach Uruguay and no help would come from Urquiza and his Argentine Federalists. Increasingly isolated, Aguirre hoped that the foreign powers could intervene, but when, on 11 January, he asked the diplomatic corps in Montevideo whether they would provide military assistance to him and his government, none responded positively. João Propício Mena Barreto sailed from Fray Bentos on 14 January with the Brazilian infantry, bound for a landing near the mouth of the Santa Lucía River near Montevideo. On the way, he occupied the Uruguayan town of Colonia del Sacramento, garrisoning it with 50 soldiers.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> for the Swedish army in Pomerania {{deteriorated}} {{during the}} winter of 1675–76, the fleet, with Kronan as flagship, was ordered to sea again {{in a desperate attempt to}} relieve the hard-pressed Swedish land forces. The weather was unusually cold and large parts of the Baltic were iced in. The fleet, now under the command of the seasoned sea officer Claes Uggla, was blocked by ice when it reached Dalarö on 23 January. The Privy Councilor Erik Lindschöld had been assigned by the King to assist with the expedition, and he came up with the idea of cutting the fleet out of the ice to reach the open sea. Hundreds of local peasants were ordered out to open a narrow channel through the ice with saws and picks to the anchorage at Älvsnabben, more than 20km (12mi) away. On reaching the naval station on 14 February, three weeks later, it turned out that most of the sea outside the inner skerries was frozen as well. A storm hit the tightly packed ships and the ensuing movement of the ice crushed the hull of the supply vessel Leoparden, sinking it. A Danish force had managed to reach the open waters farther off and observed the immobilized Swedish ships from a distance. When temperatures fell even further, the project was declared hopeless and Lindschöld gave up the attempt.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> worsened, {{early on}} 9 February 'A' Company, {{which had been}} in reserve, and HQ Company were sent forward to provide further {{assistance}} to the 22nd Infantry Brigade, which was slowly being pushed back towards the tactically important Tengah airfield, via the village of Ama Keng. They took up positions at Bulim, east of the airfield; shortly afterwards {{they were joined by}} 7 Platoon, from 'B' Company, which had been detached from the Causeway sector. The remnants of the 22nd, numbering around only 500 men from its original 2,500, with a further 500 or so isolated and attempting to fight their way through, was pushed further back throughout the day. Orders were passed for a counter-attack around the airfield but as the size of Japanese forces in the area grew to around 20,000 men, they were later cancelled in favour of establishing a line between Bulim and Jurong, to the east of the airfield. Established in the early afternoon, within this line, the 2/4th's 'A' Company was positioned east of Bulim with 7 Platoon, 'B' Company, while the remnants of 'D' Company, amounting to only 47 men, were moved south, where they joined with 'C' Company, which was supporting the Indian 44th Brigade, which although it had not yet been engaged, had fallen back from the south-west coast to avoid being cut off and had established itself west of Ulu Pandan, behind the Sungei Jurong.|$|E

5|$|At around 09:30, {{the four}} CH-46 {{helicopters}} arrived in Ngok Tavak, {{and they were}} able to unload Makowski and about 45 soldiers of the 12th MSF Company. However, the VC demonstrated their domination of the landing zone when the first helicopter was hit with anti-aircraft fire, and was forced to land on the ground, intact, though with damages to the fuel line. Moments later, the third helicopter was struck by a rocket propelled grenade as it turned around to rescue the crews of the first downed helicopter, and it was destroyed immediately. Now, with two downed helicopters blocking the landing zone, the remaining helicopters were prevented from landing on the ground, so the wounded men had to be evacuated while the helicopters were still hovering. As the last helicopter took off, two Nungs and one stranded U.S. soldier grabbed the helicopter skids to get out of Ngok Tavak, but they all fell to their deaths. Shortly after his arrival, Makowski placed the 12th MSF Company under the command of his Australian counterpart, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> continued to worsen.|$|E
5|$|Financially the Militia was {{neglected}} also. Despite the upturn in {{the economic}} situation in the early 1930s there was little financial respite for the Militia in this time. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> continued to improve, however, the defence vote was increased steadily after 1935. Indeed, in 1938 the government decided to double {{the strength of the}} Militia as war clouds began to loom on the horizon, and late in the year a recruiting campaign was launched that saw the size of the Militia increase from 35,000 to 43,000 men over the space of three months. This trend continued into 1939 and by midway through the year there were over 80,000 men serving on a part-time voluntary basis. Nevertheless, there was a serious shortage of equipment and as a result, when World War II broke out in September 1939 the Militia was by no means an effective fighting force and {{the nation as a whole}} was not as well prepared for war as it had been in 1914.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war, the 12th Light Horse Regiment {{remained}} in the Middle East for a number of months, during which time, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Phillip Chambers, they were used to suppress the 1919 Egyptian Uprising. During the uprising, the 12th carried out security operations to protect infrastructure in the Ismailia area. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> was resolved, the regiment handed back its stores and equipment in preparation for repatriation back to Australia and most of their horses were transferred to the Australian Remount Depot at Moascar. Due to concerns about costs, availability of shipping and quarantine restrictions, the decision was made that the horses would not be returned to Australia, but that they would be sold to the British Indian Army for further service, or to local Egyptians. According to Hollis, though, many were also put down by the troopers due to concerns they might be mistreated.|$|E
