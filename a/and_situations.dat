5|$|Ahimsa's precept of 'cause no injury' {{includes}} one's deeds, words, and thoughts. Classical {{literature of}} Hinduism such as Mahabharata and Ramayana, {{as well as}} modern scholars debate principles of Ahimsa when one is faced with war <b>and</b> <b>situations</b> requiring self-defence. The historic literature from India and modern discussions have contributed to theories of Just War, and theories of appropriate self-defence.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{religious}} references in the series, Nakamura stated she used only her personal knowledge and {{some aspects of}} modern society, such as yakuza and blogging, which were {{not intended to be}} critical but were added because they fit the story. Similarly, secondary characters were only introduced in the series if a chapter needed a new character to introduce a topic. The themes of the chapters were created before the situations and jokes. However, if Nakamura had a specific theme, she created several jokes and then connected them to form a story. When creating a simpler chapter as compared to the more elaborate, thematic ones, she wrote without worrying about creating jokes <b>and</b> <b>situations</b> in advance. With the help of her four assistants, on average she took between ten days and two weeks to make a complete chapter.|$|E
5|$|Her {{career is}} marked by an unusually, even spectacularly, high degree of {{interpenetration}} between her publicly available private life and her films. The star phenomenon depends upon collapsing {{the distinction between the}} star-as-person and the star-as-performer. This does not usually mean that the incidents of a film's scenario are taken to be actual incidents in the star's life but rather that they 'reveal' or express the personality of the type-of-person of the star. In the case of Turner, however, not only do her vehicles furnish characters <b>and</b> <b>situations</b> in accord with her off-screen image, but frequently incidents in them echo incidents in her life so {{that by the end of}} her career films like Peyton Place, Imitation of Life, Madame X and Love Has Many Faces seem in parts like mere illustrations of her life.|$|E
5|$|Il ritorno, says Carter, {{is clearly}} {{influenced}} by Monteverdi's earlier works. Penelope's lament in Act I is close in character to the lament from L'Arianna, while the martial episodes recall Il combattimento. Stile concitato is {{prominent in the}} fight scenes and in the slaying of Penelope's suitors. In L'incoronazione, Monteverdi represents moods <b>and</b> <b>situations</b> by specific musical devices: triple metre stands for the language of love; arpeggios demonstrate conflict; stile concitato represents rage. There is continuing debate about {{how much of the}} extant L'incoronazione music is Monteverdi's original, and how much is the work of others (there are, for instance, traces of music by Francesco Cavalli).|$|E

5|$|In {{developing}} {{the character of}} a young boy based on Kurosawa, Bhatia and Gupte explored some possible reasons why he failed in school. Their research led them to groups such as the Maharashtra Dyslexia Association and Parents for a Better Curriculum for the Child (PACE). Dyslexia eventually became the central topic and theme of the film. The pair worked with dyslexic children to research and develop the screenplay, basing characters <b>and</b> <b>situations</b> on their observations. Bhatia and Gupte carefully concealed the children's identities in {{the final version of the}} script.|$|E
5|$|It was a multi-target success, with an {{audience}} {{not limited to}} viewers in their forties as the focus on 1980s nostalgia might have indicated. This countered a contemporary trend in series television to target a specific audience demographic. The plots include characters <b>and</b> <b>situations</b> for all ages, and the series' general tone is family-friendly. Although it includes a number of flashbacks, the scripts did not limit the actors to a 1980s viewpoint; according to consultant Mariela Mociulsky, the show reflects more modern realities (such as men showing their emotions and women having greater autonomy in their lives) than TV shows of the 1980s did.|$|E
5|$|Roswell {{also did}} theater. In 1986 she {{appeared}} in improvisatory shows directed by Paul Sills at Lamb's Theatre, in which the actors were given characters <b>and</b> <b>situations</b> by the audience members.

She played Eunice, a cynical woman who works at a malpractice insurance company and is a colleague to the main character. The company people {{do everything they can to}} dismiss her because they do not want to pay her retirement benefits, which are about to take effect. Roswell reprised this role in a 1992 revival of the play, also at Groundling Theatre.|$|E

5|$|A major {{reform to}} the Court {{happened}} {{soon after the}} restoration, {{with the introduction of}} a right of appeal to the House of Lords from the Chancery. Before this there had been no records of appeals to the Lords, and a committee had concluded that there was no precedent to give the Lords jurisdiction over equity matters, except when problems and cases were sent directly to Parliament (as occasionally had been the case). In 1660 the Convention Parliament claimed for itself the right of appellate jurisdiction over equity matters, and also the right of original jurisdiction to hear equity cases at first instance. After disputes which lasted into the next Parliament, this second measure was dropped, but the right to hear equity appeals was confirmed. Horowitz writes that despite these changes, one of the academic certainties is that the problems which had dogged the court for the last two centuries persisted; Observations on the Dilatory and Expensive Proceedings in the Court of Chancery, written in 1701, listed 25 different procedures, areas <b>and</b> <b>situations</b> which contributed to the problems of high fees and slow processes.|$|E
5|$|All {{his plays}} got {{critical}} acclaim and won several awards on release. Sangeet Debuchya Mulee made satirical {{comments on the}} current communal harmony in India, through the daughters of a saintly social reformer in Maharashtra, Debuji Zhingraji Janorkar, popularly known as Gadge Maharaj. The play's narrative format used Kirtans, call-and-response chanting or responsory, which were popularised by the 13th century Hindu saint, Dnyaneshwar and another 16th century Varkari saint, Tukaram. His 2001 comedy play, Mukam Post Bombilwadi, showcased tumultuous events upon Adolf Hitler's accidental landing in a small village in coastal Maharashtra. The 2004 musical play, Sangeet Lagnakallol, was set in early 1900s referencing the characters <b>and</b> <b>situations</b> from Shripad Krushna Kolhatkar's book, Sudaamyaache Pohe (1910) and Ram Ganesh Gadkari's book, Sampoorna Baalakraam (1925). His other plays like Mangalawarache Mundake (2001) discussed environmental concerns and Samudra (2005), starring Atul Kulkarni, explored a mystery based upon ancient Vedic mythological history.|$|E

5|$|Animals {{will use}} {{different}} gaits for different speeds, terrain <b>and</b> <b>situations.</b> For example, horses show four natural gaits, the slowest horse gait is the walk, {{then there are}} three faster gaits which, from slowest to fastest, are the trot, the canter and the gallop. Animals may also have unusual gaits that are used occasionally, such as for moving sideways or backwards. For example, the main human gaits are bipedal walking and running, but they employ many other gaits occasionally, including a four-legged crawl in tight spaces. Mammals show a vast range of gaits, the order that they place and lift their appendages in locomotion. Gaits can be grouped into categories according to their patterns of support sequence. For quadrupeds, there are three main categories: walking gaits, running gaits and leaping gaits. Walking {{is the most common}} gait, where some feet are on the ground at any given time, and found in almost all legged animals. Running is considered to occur when at some points in the stride all feet are off the ground in a moment of suspension.|$|E
5|$|In {{line with}} Müller's advice, Jovanović avoided {{creating}} a sentimental work and focused instead on depicting characters <b>and</b> <b>situations</b> he observed {{during his time}} in the Balkans. This differentiates the painting from other Orientalist paintings of the day, which were based on travel accounts rather than first-hand experience. The art historian Lilien Filipovitch-Robinson notes that the grouping of the figures and their interactions with one another are reminiscent of images of the lamentation over the body of Christ. The right half of the scene recedes into shadow while the brightly illuminated left, where the principal figures are located, appears to expand towards the viewer. Jovanović thus directs the viewer's eye from left to right, foreground to background, through the circular pattern of the groupings as well as the diagonal lines of the peasants' swords. In line with Müller's teachings regarding light and colour, Jovanović adds touches of bright red to give warmth and movement to the scene, making it appear as though it is unfolding before the viewer. The brushwork is varied, ranging from the smooth broad strokes that define the solidity of the walls to quick short ones that make it appear like the figures are in motion.|$|E
5|$|In the Greco-Roman {{world of}} Classical antiquity, Roman {{agriculture}} {{was built on}} techniques originally pioneered by the Sumerians, transmitted to them by subsequent cultures, with a specific emphasis on the cultivation of crops for trade and export. The Romans {{laid the groundwork for}} the manorial economic system, involving serfdom, which flourished in the Middle Ages. The farm sizes in Rome can be divided into three categories. Small farms were from 18-88 iugera (one iugerum is equal to about 0.65 acre). Medium-sized farms were from 80-500 iugera (singular iugerum). Large estates (called latifundia) were over 500 iugera. The Romans had four systems of farm management: direct work by owner and his family; slaves doing work under supervision of slave managers; tenant farming or sharecropping in which the owner and a tenant divide up a farm’s produce; <b>and</b> <b>situations</b> in which a farm was leased to a tenant.|$|E
