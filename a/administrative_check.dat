40|$|The {{system of}} {{government}} in France {{has been dominated by}} central control, with local-government structure arising largely from historical rather than from current administrative needs. The reforms of 1982 show the first linkage for a century of the local and central political majorities towards a policy of dentralisation. Stimulated by this socialist movement these reforms have aimed to reduce the power of the prefect, to institute general socialist change, to increase the power of local communities, and to decrease central <b>administrative</b> <b>checks</b> and controls. The effect of the reforms has been to strengthen the d�partements and large cities against the prefect, but for the small communities decentralisation will probably remain a pious hope.

40|$|One of the {{objectives}} of the new CAP (Common Agricultural Policy) of the European Union is the enhancement of environmental performance through a mandatory "greening" component of direct payments, which will support agricultural practices beneficial for the climate and the environment. A part of the financial support that farmers receive will be linked to simple, generalized, non-contractual farming practices that go beyond cross-compliance, such as crop diversification, the maintenance of permanent grassland, and the establishment of ecological focus areas. In order to better achieve {{the objectives}} of "greening" and to allow for its efficient administration and control, these practices are implemented {{depending on the size of}} the eligible area declared by the farmer and are compared to the whole area held by the applicant. The compulsory nature of those practices should also concern farmers whose lands are fully or partly situated in "Natura 2000 " areas. The implementation of the "greening" component in the Land Parcel Identification Systems (LPIS) is a challenge to be further analyzed according to their specific conditions. All spatial objects of the "greening" category should be identifiable, measurable, locatable and stable in time, which allow efficient controls. This article addresses the geospatial nature of the LPIS „greening“ component and introduces possible monitoring, measuring and control methods for the related elements and practices.

40|$|Traditional {{international}} law and its instruments are stagnating {{both in terms of}} quantity and quality. New, alternative forms of cross-border cooperation, in particular processes of informal {{international law}}making, have emerged and gained prominence since the 2000 s in response to an increasingly diverse, networked, and knowledge-based society. This transformation impacts on the three axes of actors, processes and outputs in the international legal order. We challenge the assumption that traditional international law is, by definition, legitimate and that this would not be the case for new forms of informal lawmaking: whereas traditional international law is often based on “thin state consent”, a “thick stakeholder consensus” underlies many of the new forms of cooperation. It is submitted that the evolution in the international legal order demands an adjustment of models to keep both new forms of cooperation and traditional international law in check. This paper thereto assesses the legitimacy of international legal processes, tackling also the question whether new forms benefit powerful actors and how to keep activity accountable, both domestically and internationally, towards internal and external stakeholders, through ex ante, ongoing and ex post control mechanisms, involving not only managerial or <b>administrative</b> <b>checks</b> and balances but also political and judicial oversight. The paper furthermore examines whether some of the new outputs of international cooperation could already be seen as part of traditional {{international law and}} how traditional and new forms are (or could be) interacting before international courts and tribunals. To conclude, a redefinition of the academic discipline of international law to keep both the field and its students sociologically relevant is proposed...|$|R

50|$|Until 2008 {{the vehicle}} {{inspection}} {{was limited to}} <b>administrative</b> <b>checks</b> (whether all taxes have been paid) and a visual check if the car matches the documents. In August 2005 the Turkish government decided to introduce a vehicle inspection scheme following the directive 96/96/EC of the European Union. Since there was no technical equipment available for real roadworthiness tests a contract was laid out with the German TÜV SÜD that was presenting itself for the task in syndication with two Turkish corporations. The TÜV Türk trust is given a monopoly on car inspection for 20 years. Beginning with 2009 the TÜV test is mandatory for all cars with the inspection scheme to follow the German inspection scheme - however there is a transition period up to 2013 where established TÜV regulations are not followed as strictly as in mainland Europe. The shift in vehicle inspection policies is nevertheless rather sharp - since the old vehicle inspection service was strickened with corruption no staff members were taken over to the TÜV Süd, the internal inspection protocol is stricter than in Germany as to prevent any corruption. The introduction of the TÜV was accompanied with a strong propaganda program to agitate the requirement for a modern inspection scheme (e.g. the number of fatal road accidents was three times as high as in mainland Europe despite {{most of the country}} to be very rural). Additionally, it is expected that the connection with the German Turks allows for most citizens to have some knowledge how to cope with the TÜV inspection scheme.Also, private vehicle inspection company otorapor.com is inspecting vehicles.

The practical investigations deal with Newspapers or Advertising copy. No thorough stylistic analysis has been made of Administrative English.

A.) or impersonally as for example in 'the claimant (I. A.).

Democracy requires government to be accountable in its use of public money and in providing effective, efficient, and economical service delivery.

50|$|Complex {{services}} involve {{many steps}} and may require paperwork or customer files to be shuffled between contact staff, back office and support departments. The time taken to move paperwork or customers is very costly {{in terms of}} time and efficiency. Tertiary student enrolment provides a great example of complex processes that are often not very customer-friendly. Students must firstly see an academic advisor to ensure that their course progress in on track, then see an <b>administrative</b> advisor to <b>check</b> that paperwork is in order and finally see a cashier to pay tuition fees and pay any fines, such as overdue library books before they can finalise their enrolment. In many institutions, this enrolment process can take half a day - and requires students to run from pillar to post as they complete each step. Locating each stage in close proximity has many advantages. Not only does it improve operational efficiency, {{it has the potential to}} allow service staff to focus on the total process and gain a better understanding of the ways that their actions impact on other parts of the system. In short, it forces employees to focus not just on the activities for which they are directly responsible.|$|R

40|$|Administrative {{agencies}} wield {{a necessary}} but dangerous power. Some {{control of that}} power is constitutionally required and normatively justified. Yet widely discordant views persist concerning the appropriate means of control. Scholars have proposed competing administrative control models that variably place the judiciary, the President, and Congress at the helm. Although these models offer critical insights into the institutional competencies of the respective branches, they tend to understate the limitations of those branches to <b>check</b> <b>administrative</b> power and ultimately marginalize the public interest costs occasioned by second-guessing administrative choice. The “relative checks” paradigm introduced here seeks to improve upon existing models {{in at least two}} critical respects. First, it posits the existence of an optimal control point within the shared values of two sometimes competing missions in administrative law: that of promoting the public interest and that of legitimizing administrative power within our constitutional scheme. Next, the paradigm argues that the optimal control ideal can be best realized by tailoring both the source and degree of administrative control to particular types of administrative actions with sensitivity to the institutional competencies of the respective checking bodies. Prescriptively, this framework seeks to apportion control among the respective branches in a way that capitalizes on each branch’s competencies while democratically promoting the public interest. Descriptively, looking through a relative checks lens may also enhance our understanding of existing administrative practices and the academic critiques thereof...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Registries have {{key roles}} in cancer incidence, {{mortality}} and survival monitoring and in showing disparities across the population. Incidence monitoring began in New South Wales in 1972 and other jurisdictions soon followed. Registry data {{are used to}} evaluate outcomes of preventive, screening, treatment and support services. They have shown decreases in cancer incidence following interventions and {{have been used for}} workforce and other infrastructure planning. Crude markers of optimal radiotherapy and chemotherapy exist and registry data are used to show shortfalls against these markers. The data are also used to investigate cancer clusters and environmental concerns. Survival data are used to assess service performance and interval cancer data are used in screening accreditation. Registries enable determination of risk of multiple primary cancers. Clinical quality registries are used for clinical quality improvement. Population-based cancer registries and linked administrative data complement clinical registries by providing high-level system-wide data. The USACommission on Cancer has long used registries for quality assurance and service accreditation. Increasingly population-based registry data in Australia are linked with administrative data on service delivery to assess systemperformance. Additionof tumour stage andotherprognostic indicators is important for these analyses and is facilitated by the roll-out of structured pathology reporting.
