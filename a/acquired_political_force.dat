40|$|This is an {{electronic}} {{version of an}} article published in Economy and Society. © Copyright 1985 Taylor & Francis; Economy and Society is available online at [URL] paper argues for the possibility of reworking the concept of ideology {{in such a way as}} to depend neither on a problematic of truth and error, nor on a division of the world into two parts one of which is more real than the other, nor on an expressive relation of subjects to meaning. The <b>political</b> <b>force</b> of the concept can be retained if ideology is thought as a provisional state of discourse (a function of its appropriation and use) rather than as a content or an inherent structure. Any discursive system produces a particular configuration of subject-positions which are the conditions of entry of individuals into discourse; but these <b>acquire</b> <b>political</b> significance only through the (historically variable) codification of discourse in terms of a play of relations of power, and the positions available can be refused or undermined. Some implications of this argument for models of the social and for discourse theory are discussed. Open Acces...|$|R

In the feudal society, the <b>political</b> <b>forces</b> of the kings and nobility had their relations with the economic forces of the villages through serfdom. The serfs, although not free, were tied to both forces and, thus, not completely alienated. Capitalism, Marx argued, completely separates the economic and <b>political</b> <b>forces,</b> leaving them to have relations through a limiting government.
